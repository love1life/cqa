20090223135426AAAanPv	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Are there any problems with saving money by flying into Amman or Cairo to get to Jerusalem?	Some details to explain:      I can save $200 and $300 respectively.      I have crossed these borders before many times.      I got on Israel's "list" by taking a picture at the Jordan River crossing once.. and when they looked at my camera I had pictures of "bullets."      Somehow pictures of bullets is bad (even though in the US we hunt and have arms.. its nothing).      I did get into a few arguments at that time.  I get automatically pulled out of line and strip searched entering and leaving Israel since then.         Will they somehow freak out on me? I've done nothing wrong, I just enjoy Arab countries.      Will these Arab flights be unusual somehow?  Does anyone think its worth the money saved?

Do they make as many pounds as I make dollars, or do they (gasp!) get paid the equivalent value of pounds that I make in dollars?

20090223145113AAGa2Bw	Travel;Australia;Other - Australia	Right to refuse medical treatment in Australia?	I'm looking into applying to graduate schools in Australia (I will be there on a Student Visa if that makes any difference). Through basic research I was able to get most of my questions answered except for this one: Can I refuse medical treatment there? The only info I could find was about refusing treatment as a "right to die" sort of thing. I'm talking about basic things like if I get cut but don't want stitches do I have a right to refuse that? If a doctor wants to put me on a certain medication that I don't want to go on can I refuse it? Also I have a type of seizure disorder (its a kind where I don't have convulsions, but causes other symptoms), if anyone notices this and calls an ambulance, would I have the right to refuse transport to the hospital (I've never had to go anyway, they aren't serious as "typical" seizures are).      Sorry, I know it's probably a stupid question. I'm just a very independent person who is used to making their own decisions. I wouldn't take it very well if others did that for me. I'm guessing the answer is that you can refuse whatever treatment you want, but I just want to be sure. Thank you for any info!

20090223155317AAr4pQQ	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	What to do as a tourist in west country (england)?	For the 2nd time in about 18 months, I will be going to the province (pardon me if that's the wrong word) of somerset, specifically the small town of frome.  I get to pick and choose (for the most part or at least suggest ideas).  So far we've come up with Monkey World, London, Bath.  We've done the shopping in Bath and London Eye/Hard Rock Cafe in London.  What other things do suggest are the best to see in those 2 cities.  When I was England in 1998 as a graduation present (with school) i visited both of those cities and loved the both.  Bath has changed so much since then.  It's become a shopaholics dream in some areas, which takes away from the history.  I am a history buff myself.  Any other realistic suggestions would be wonderful as well.  I have about a week to work with and a pretty flexible schedule too.  It helps when you are staying with locals (former neighbors in the states)!  Feel free to email with pictures or extensive info at sabecky450@yahoo.com.  TTFN~
