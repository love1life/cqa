We've rented a limo and plan to hit a club or two that night. I've already bought some tiaras for myself (I'm the one turning 22) and the other b-day girls, and I'll most likely buy some "Birthday Girl" sashes...or maybe I'll make them...Any ideas on how to do that w/out the sashes looking cheap? My main problem, though, is what to give the other girls attending? I've thought about doing a hangover survival kit as sort of a cute gag gift. I'd probably give these to all the girls, and they might include things like bottled water, coffe packet, antacid, pain-killer, sleep mask/eye gel mask, pepto bismol, alka-seltzer, chapstick, energy drink...etc. Any ideas on how to do this or what else to put in?
