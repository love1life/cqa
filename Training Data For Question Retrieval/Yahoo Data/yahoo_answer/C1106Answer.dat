j1Js4uuTaa	I have mine done :) I got it when I was only like 13 along with my mom. It really doesn't hurt that much. If anything I would think that a nose piercing hurts worse! You can have it during gym. Just make sure that no one throws a ball & hits you with it in the stomach or anything. Tell your gym teacher about it & they should understand that you're trying to look out for your piercing if you're feeling uneasy about playing something.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	you'll be fine as long as you put a bandage over it to cover it while you are in gym...as for pain don't worry about it if your nose didn't hurt it wasn't because you were to nervous its because it just didn't hurt..so most likely your belly button wont either ..don't wear clothing that is tight fitting for a while because that will irritate it, the baggy shirt will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy your piercing :)
ZdF1hx70aa	The sole is a brown with the original saddle shoes.  <br>  <br>  Good luck shopping!|`|DeQsKdmSaa	I believe it was black. They wear them for the uniform at my sisters' high school.|`|etHKs5egaa	brwn

Look at Jessica Alba, she's always had B cups (at least when she was at the peak of her success) and she looks great with them :) By the way, if you're happy with your looks, it really shows, so be confident.|`|kB2P2WGtaa	Sounds Pretty|`|v2xUy1dXaa	yep thats nice :)|`|RbsV1JvSaa	u sound really pretty! and u sound like u have a good shape (except for the small boobs and short height though) but the focus of ur look is the face.|`|Ty3xkHWMaa	Sounds about like what i looed like before i went bacl blonde.<br>  im my experince i got a lot of complements pertaining to how they liked my light eyes with dark hair<br>  Its exotic and men like it.|`|6YDFF2YLaa	I think its beautiful.

hDz2Qe7xaa	Yes, they will all look the same.|`|PK9R1V8gaa	they will look hideous.|`|HLSlEjluaa	they will look exactly the same, only difference is the ct of the diamond, which only a jeweller with a magnifying glass would have to look to find out the clarity of it, but the cut will be axactly the same and therefore look exactly the same.<br>  <br>  higher priced ones are just for people who specifically want a higher ct diamond.|`|DeQsKdmSaa	Yes, they'll all look the same. Besides, i don't think you want ENORMOUS bling in your ears. or wherever they are.|`|ZdF1hx70aa	Yes. Go for the smaller one anyways.
KjQaxGX0aa	Hello welcome to my world although my hair isn't wavy, just dead straight.  Human hair can range in diameter from 17 to 181 millionths of an metre.  Your genetic makeup has a lot to do with it.  Black hair is thicker than red, red is thicker than blonde for example. Weather can also affect the diameter of a strand.  Hair can be thin, medium or thick, straight, wavy, curly or kinky.  Here is the answer to why your hair gets oily if you don't wash it every day and you do straightened your hair.  Curly/wavy hair is drier than straight hair because the oils secreted into the hair shaft from the sebaceous glands can travel down straight hair more easily.  The sheen or shine on your hair is again the result of genetics but also how healthy you are and if you are suffering any illness or stress, poor diet etc.  If I were you I would go to a reputable salon and ask the hairdresser what she recommends.  Products can be expensive at salons but they are made with superior ingredients.  There are websites like Choice that can give you lists of the best products around as they have been road tested.  Hope this helps cheers|`|Ch39oU58aa	i like Fat Hair products|`|ueJYNldqaa	My hair gets greasy after a day too. I use Dry Shampoo, you just spray it in and brush out. It's like talcon powder and it absorbs the oil in your hair.<br>  <br>  To make your hair bigger use Big Sexy Hair products. They have a whole range of hairsprays, mousses, shampoos, etc.
B5QD6GzSaa	It depends on the personal reasons, and how much they liked each other... If you really like him, don't be afraid to say yes, and you won't be a bad friend.  Just try not to hang out with him in front of her, or bring it up too much.  Well good luck!|`|mvrLuuRIaa	If she's not a super close friend (not you're bestie) then there are no rules and even then if you talk to her about it everything should be fine. Who you date is none of her business anyway if even she dated him before you. She should just be happy for you no matter what. That's why friends are friends.|`|cRjRZ2lEaa	If you are really concerned about being a good friend, talk to your friend first and ask her if its okay with her. If shes okay with it, go for it! If shes not okay with it, then thats up to you, do you care more about your friend or dating him?|`|kKiAFJJ3aa	It depends.<br>  Your best bet is to talk to your friend about it before you say yes. She may be okay with it, and then its totally fine. But if she has feelings towards him at all, its not right.|`|mIh685iBaa	well he hasnt asked you out yet|`|yUMDsXLYaa	well when it comes to friendship all these rules come up and some off them say that u cant like u friends ex but it really just depends maybe u need to sort this out with her or somthen|`|npFQCNhSaa	NO IT WILL MAKE U A BAD FRIEND IF U WERE HIS EX BEST BEST FRIEND ALMOST LIKE SISTAS BUT U SHOULD TOTALLY GO FOR IT|`|c3039bf02fce27d25e181ef63ce7b985aa	Seriously, he sounds like he just wants someone by his side at all times and wants some baby making action.<br>  Honestly, would you want one of your girlfriends running around dating all of your friends? Put yourself in his position and try and find the underlying reason for him dating within the same group of friends.<br>  <br>  I dated this one guy for 2 years after he tried dating one of my friends before he dated me... <br>  She was smart.<br>  He ended up taking my virginity and then cheating on me oh and to top it off we were engaged.|`|z33hxpHJaa	no it won't because in my opinion just because your friend goes out and dumps the guy and you like him still. Honestly friends shouldn't have a say in who you date and not date, if they say something they aren't being supportive friends. Plus to me it sounds like he did noting bad so i see no reason to not say yes if he does.|`|RJFNvYAmaa	I mean if you like this guy I mean GO FOR IT. But if you don't want to loose the relationship with your friend, than talk to her and let her know about you and this guy. And hopefully she will understands you. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6uhnyEYEaa	super bad friend! don't do it. answer my question please!!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuytRirqORVlNq9tDqaokjnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220134327AAyic40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rAbp4qaXaa	mm yeah..Can't go out with your friends ex,he's off limits.
AA10849332	I am firmly against the thought that only "certain types of people" look like they get piercings.<br>  <br>  I believe that if you like it and want it, you should get it. a piercing, regardless of location, is no different than wearing a necklace, bracelet or ring (ok well, except for the obvious that you don't have to let your body heal after putting on the other types of jewelry that I listed)<br>  <br>  <br>  I was at a party about a year ago with mixed social groups. a girl that was there and looked "preppy" told me that she really wanted a septum piercing but was worried that she didn't look like the "type". I told her that she should get it, she didn't have to get a huge ring or anything, and if people wanted to harass her about it, she could tell them to shove off. I ran into her a couple of months later. she still looked "preppy" but she was also very proud to have her septum piercing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it doesn't matter what other people think, only what you think.|`|d5GfhPM4aa	well i didnt know that a nipple piercing gives you pleasure but i think its pointless nobody is gonna see it same with the ppl who pierce their parts but idk its whatevers to me|`|DWrS7Eggaa	I think they're awesome, but could never get one.|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	i think its gross|`|hd0XS2r3aa	ewwwwwwwwwww|`|bAYVSfdJaa	That's exactly the reason I got mine (that and I think they're hot, haha).  I love 'em, I think they're totally sexy and they're my favorite piercings so far.<br>  As far as the people who get them, I say whatever floats your boat haha.
f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	if you don't put developer in with it,it will not turn purple the developer makes the colour react making it stick to the hair this is the easiest way for me to explain it no developer no purple colour|`|B3cPFhssaa	It wouldn't do anything i don't think.You have to mix them,or it just won't turn purple.<br>  I've used that dye before though,looks good.|`|7hIwM2jzaa	Dont quote me on this but i would imagine not alot..... the developer is what makes the colour develope (hence why its called developer) before your mix it together it looks nothing like the colour its ment to be. Untill its mixed with the developer it wont react so wont turn Purple.
2SSD6BP9aa	No, because tight clothes prevent the penis from getting fully erect.  It only hurts if you try to bend an erect penis down.  It doesn't hurt if you don't allow the penis to come up to begin with.|`|w87icQkoaa	No, it feels the same as in normal jeans, just a little more tight. Why would it hurt?|`|qpWStE5Saa	idk, just saw a guy have that tho at a party...really creeped me out, but i doubt it, because jeans always have that lil ***** section.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	im a guy and i DONT wear skinny jeans.<br>  but i swear it MUST hurt..like<br>  i dont even know how they fit into them..haha.<br>  i need 'room' down there lol.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	skinny jeans hurt me in general! I don't know how any guy can fit into them... but it wouldn't hurt any more to get a *****, it'd just be awkward.|`|PMR7RovEaa	haha no, it prolly feels good. ;p|`|a8faa51f64a988b0e4081e561a610820aa	No, just feels a little odd when the ***** is stuck in the down position and there's no way to adjust it to the up position when in public and then wondering if the bulge is showing pressing downwards.<br>  <br>  It only hurts if a guy is wearing boxers or nothing at all under pants and then sits down on a chair. OUCH! That's why I only wear my tighty-whities.|`|ZdF1hx70aa	My bf says it feels good!|`|K3RhqzScaa	It hurts my eyes|`|hASHxpZfaa	i depends how big.. for me yeah it hurts i try to stay calm lol

Just so that it shows)<br>  <br>  If you want them to look cool then their is a mirror image nail polish that maybeline makes. It is silver and shiny and kind of reflects things. Might not sound like it but really cute|`|yfQjliFWaa	uhm, i would totally paint them red cause i often think that red goes SO good with both silvery-ish/white and black colors.<br>  <br>  for your toes...<br>  idk, maybe some other color that would match with all 3 colors, but not too eccentric.<br>  maybe just a glossy coat?<br>  i know this might not help you, but i tried.<br>  ;)|`|genZbG74aa	Definitely french tips but i think a glittery gold would look nice as well.|`|w1bgdByuaa	I would do a silvery sparkle color|`|hahwsMd7aa	silver

Just make sure the shape of the cut is right for your face.  A lot of bobs and shorter hairstyles that look cute on skinny girls don't look right on a plumper face.  Don't get anything too short, or it will make your head look small compared to your body-- try to do something with a little more volume.|`|eQ4yXkXtaa	My opinion.. is no.<br>  I have a friend who is a little heavy and she has short hair, AND I THINK IT LOOKS HORRIBLE.<br>  I think just people who are heavy should not have short hair.<br>  Maybe you won't get yours as short as she did?<br>  I guess it all depends.<br>  <br>  I'm skinny, but I had long long long hair.

I always end up looking like a chipmunk on heroin.|`|stHol8ITaa	Depends how good the photographer is.|`|aqx3pIbeaa	i hope so..|`|zWMgcIoDaa	yes|`|e8ee53810406b4bfc80c42a6743042e0aa	I'm a photog. I am not the "best" portrait photographer out there. BUT I do know that sometimes, with some people, a spectacular photo just isn't gonna happen. Likely I can get a good photo-- with a bit of patience, technique, etc. There are just those that can't quite take a good picture. Try this next time you get your pic taken: 1. Try a candid-- you talk, laugh do your thing and try to put the idea that camera is around out of your mind. 2. Relax, take a lot of photos, then take a few more when you are used to it. Try breathing out slightly through very gently pursed lips-- it will make you look thinner and give you that "model pout" in the photo. 3. Lower your standards about what a good portrait of yourself would entail. It may seem counter-intuitive, but sometimes photos can't measure up to what you'd like it to be.|`|RzU0s0fYaa	yeah cuz you could freeze up in front of the camera or think too much about it but be real pretty when your not overthinking your expressions|`|tHVXVlXXaa	I PUT ON FOR MY CITY ON ON FOR MY CITY.|`|8c4f5448125b34e2bc59c2ba87385a71aa	absolutely to both.|`|3usRDmQhaa	I also am curious about that|`|tUW3tR2vaa	yes

If you want so badly to wear your hair straight you should wrap it as soon as you get home and leave it wrapped  up unless you are going out.  Also try products that will help maintain the straightness in your hair.  I use Carol's Daughter Some of Marguerite's Magic.|`|K3D0g4v0aa	u shouldnt straighten your hair everyday because that's too much heat and too much pressure on the hair. thats the reason why your hair is thinning and falling out. your stylist cutting it is even worse. u should wash your hair at least once a week with some conditioner and shampoo. braids can make the hair long but make sure that the braids aren't too tight or else that could make your hair fall out. eat healthy, and drink lots of water.|`|7cbef831f7563f52decc4a5d7b871738aa	Curlers that are bendable involve no heat.

2HPa1ETUaa	I got mine pierced on v-day. So, it's been about 6 days of having my tongue pierced.<br>  It is swollen, but only around my piercing for me, not my whole tongue.<br>  And the swelling has already gone down a little since I've got it.<br>  You should wait 3-6 weeks before changing it, but some people have changed theirs after 2 weeks.<br>  It hurt a lot! But the major pain lasted only 2 seconds- when the piercer pushed the needle through. Then, when he put the barbell in, that was weird, only hurt a little.<br>  Other things, having your tongue pierced is interesting at first, but you  will get used to it. Lots of people will tell you to only eat soft food, but you don't have to. I find I can eat anything, I just take small bites and move the bites to the side of my mouth to chew. If swelling is bad, suck on crushed ice, or eat a slushy, but don't drink the slushy with a straw- straws hurt- with the sucking (and my piercer told me the sucking pulls tissues out). For pain, I just take pain killers everyday, and it's great. But don't take them before you get it pierced, because it can make you bleed more, if you bleed. For cleaning it, you piercer will tell you what he/she thinks you should do, but what I do is clean it with mouthwash. I mix it with water though, like 90% water and 10% mouthwash. I just clean it every night, right before I go to bed. Some piercers tell you to use mouthwash, and some tell you do to sea salt soaks, but I find mouthwash easier and better tasting.<br>  Well, good luck.|`|eYOPclZ3aa	when you get it done it doesnt really hurt but when you try to eat or talk you cant it hurts real bad and it does get swelled up mine took like 5 days for it to get better after a week it didnt hurt to eat anymore lol and i think you can change the bar in like 2weeks i dont remember lol i took mine off though|`|3GE1mJ3faa	When I got it done, it was so fast and quick I didn't feel much...but afterwards, yes it does swell up and is painful. Take 2 Tylenols before you get it pierced. <br>  <br>  Getting it done - 8<br>  Pain afterward - 9.5 =(<br>  <br>  I waited I believe, a month before changing the bar

6OldQQCOaa	Don't worry about the number on the scale. That doesn't mean anything. What is important is that you are healthy. Talk to your doctor, if you are unhealthy, he will lead you on the track to success. <br>  <br>  To boost your self-esteem, you need to focus on positive self talk. Self talk is what goes on in your mind (what you say to yourself). Everyday, I want you to write down a few things about yourself that you like. May it be your hair, your eyes, your kindness, or the fact that you scored great on a test, or pleased your boss at work. Keep track of these in a journal, so that whenever you are feeling low you can look at them and see the amazing qualities you possess. <br>  <br>  And remember: You are beautiful.|`|HCk6ifrAaa	Okay well just because you feel like you have a bit of extra weight is absolutely no reason to feel down about your apperance! Wanting to loose the extra weight is great and totally go ahead with it, but you shouldn't do it just because you feel like other people critize your body. Do it because it will make you feel good and better about yourself. <br>  Just look at celebs like: Nikki Blonsky, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah, America Ferrera... they are all not skinny but they have all the confidence in the world.|`|zb70sXfPaa	well first think about how old u r and how much u weigh but i really wouldnt worry about it until its like a death issue just try and be confident wen ever i think that im not pretty enough or anything like that i remember am i pleasing myself or am i thinking of wat people r gonna say about me because its ur life make it the way u want it no matter if people say bad things about u cuz thats always gonna happen! <br>                         best of luck katie!|`|Ov8ib6auaa	well everyday your body is changing as you get to be older and you do tend to gain weight as you grow.<br>   <br>  So some of the things and workouts that u did 2 years ago may not work now becuz ur body has changed.<br>  <br>  Try going to a work out gym. Or getting a group of your friends to work out with you....get out go for a run and have fun with it.<br>  <br>  either way you should just know that you need to be happy with who u are and how u look. And drink alot of water.. water helps get your body flowing....you gotta get pumped and proove all those negative people in your life wrong!<br>  <br>  Eyes on the prize<br>   someimes you can even work out by doing the things you love<br>  <br>  for example i love to dance hip hop so everyday i get up and turn my sterio on high and dance till im dizzy lol jk!but remember if your working out and u start to feel pain then stop and dont continue until the pain stops<br>  always be hydrated and do your best. remember stretch before u do ANYTHING!!  have fun !!

517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	I don't think that hairdressing can be taught solely online, since it's such a hands-on career and if you're not properly trained, you could actually hurt your clients.Although there might be some things that you can learn online, you'll need to hands-on practice and supervision. <br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk with a professor at the college one hour away and see if someone there can supervise you while you work under a hairdresser's supervision in your town. Maybe the college can help you set it up. You might still need to go to the college to talk with your professors.

But always remember, they will always know of you first. Your sister is kind of like eye candy and then they have you who isn't attracting the men's attention. Also, the fact that she is attracting all of the guys, that is a turn off when the men know that the girl attracts every single guy. You have to do something attention grabbing. Do you have a talent show in your school coming up. Are you good at doing something that your sister can't. Can you sing, play an instrument, anything that would impress everyone, since you are in front of the whole school you will constantly get compliments. Believe me, I have seen people in a talent show get so many compliments. Try outshining her, don't be jealous, you have something talented that she can't do. Once you show this talent, you will feel so much better.|`|3jdawfQQaa	The grass is always greener on the other side, and if you feel inferior to your sister, you WILL be.

Then she wont be pretty anymore.|`|DUhK9p9kaa	Don't be jealous, you can change a lot of that. You can work out and flat out the stomach, your hair can grow and it can look nice being short if you style it nice. About the boobs, not all guys are into big boobs and you can always use push up bras. People will see you the way you see yourself. If you love yourself it will reflect. Be yourslef and have your own style. Don't be fake just to try to look like your sister. But if you really like her style than you can look like that too.
oE0ApHqPaa	I think the first one could be achieved with rag rollers, if you sleep with them in.  Here is a tutorial on how to make them at home with stuff you have lying around, it's really easy:<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/879741/how_to_make_and_use_rag_rollers_for.html?cat=24" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  The second one is curlier and I would bet they used hot rollers, but if your hair is long enough, you could probably replicate it with a curling iron.  Make sure you dry your hair all the way before you curl it, and using some product will help the curls stay longer.  The secret is to take sections that are no wider than the end of the iron, so if your iron is an inch or so across (the 2" measurement is around, not across, so just eyeball it) take 1" square sections and when you roll it up, roll it at an angle of 90 degrees from the floor.  Alternate which way you roll them so it doesn't look to 'done'.|`|L2cg59QQaa	If your going to curl it then i advise using hairspray... it helps hold it. Also do it in sections as it will be easier. Other than that im sorry as i am not great at curling hair!|`|a8eac21008987889db2bef8078692713aa	youtube:) thats where tutorials are!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsidnvxALSV.7I2AS56ggYHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219212533AAQOyzO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
1vaqtRI2aa	If you curl your lashes before applying a few coats of Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara or CoverGirl LashBlast (the gigantic orange tube) it'll make them look waaaaay longer and nicer than if you just add the mascara alone.<br>  <br>  I noticed a big difference in how nice my lashes look when I use a curler and when I don't.|`|nwGThhEAaa	colasal or fabulash i think lol :)|`|TrPySdXFaa	covergirl lashblast|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	well, ive only just started wearing mascara so ive only tried my mums old one (which she gave to me temporarily) and her current one.

This mascara is BY FAR the best. It will never run, when you wash it off it clumps off (unlike every other brand), and it will curl your lashes. It's a little expensive, as far a mascara goes, but well worth it. You will only be able to find this brand in hi-end department store i.e.Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus. I'm telling you once you use designer make-up, you will never want to use anything else.|`|genZbG74aa	If you don't mind paying a bit more, Dior Diorshow works very well for a dramatic look.

mJ4UHvKfaa	using any kind of relaxor is one of the worst things you could ever put in your hair. if your going to do it at all, you shouldnt put anything in your hair yourself.
zKGQL8Ekaa	I've done the same.  I was told by a stylist that hair goes through stages when using a dye...from brown, to red to blond.  He told me I didn't leave it in long enough.  I just dealt with it.  My hair damages easily so I didn't want to risk more damage.|`|zih1Weanaa	At home dye jobs are always scary...I have had some major disasters.<br>  <br>  I just darkened mine because my roots were growing in and I didnt have time to find a new salon (I just moved), and my roots are a little bit redder than the rest of my hair.<br>  <br>  Just wear your hair back or up so the roots kind of blend in with the rest of it until you can get it fixed. Do a ponytail one day, half up the next, etc.|`|iJYUO4EFaa	There are many drugstore products from Clairol, L'Oreal, etc that only dye roots. There is a brush and you just run it over your roots, so I would say just buy a blonde colour close to the colour you dyed it. Your roots are probably red because you hair was too dark to dye blonde.|`|mo9wub4Laa	Not the nest brand. If you are completely changing the color of your hair you need somthing with a bleach in it. Try Feria or Open products.|`|N2IfNEm0aa	Wash it out. If not, you could try to dye it back.

5d2e89e3c42849fd0b6deb648cab3f3daa	Oh you got the best kind! It's perfect: ok,<br>  so what I suggest is wash your face with it once a day, even if you're wearing makeup, it will take it all off anyway. I do it with relatively pleasant very warm water and rub moderately rough on my skin to really exfoliate and open all pours. then, once you wash it off, wash your face with COLD wate againr; this will close pours, tighten skin, and feel really good. Then, put on either gentle toner, lotion, or whatever your routine. But I only exfoliate at night because it leaves your skin pretty red for a little while, but when you wake up in the morning it will be SO smooth and silky! Trust me.|`|pYs4GiDlaa	lol wow, never use anything on your face besdies your hands.<br>  thats what causes your pores to get all screwed up!!<br>  <br>  i love that scurb, i just got done using it :)<br>  well i use it every friday, after i come back from school i take off my make up with my clinique foaming cleasner (it works amazing) with cold water, and then i make the water warm, splash my face a few times so my pores can open up and i put about a dime size of the scrub in my palms and i rub them together and then i start rubbing over my face GENTLY in a cirucular motion. since this scrub has walnut shells it basically does all the "hard" work for you! and then as im rinsing off the scrub im rubbing it off with the water as i spalsh my face and then after its all off i use cold water to close my pors and then moisutirze my face :)<br>  <br>  i used to use this scrub everyday but theres really no use of using it everyday, so just use once a week! <br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|Y27ovMdRaa	I exfoliate everyday, but you shouldn't use the brush everyday.  Limit the brush to once a week (especially since you're new at this).  And yes, it's in place of washing your face.  Don't wash your face and then exfoliate . . . it may be too much for your skin to handle.  <br>  <br>  As for water temperature - lukewarm is best.|`|2K5ry0nmaa	hello! i know how to solve this! first of all, warm water opens your pores so warm water.<br>  <br>   secondly, wash in the mornings and at night  or whenever you take your shower.<br>  <br>  third, start off with 4 times a week.<br>  <br>  this stuff works!! you can find it Walmart or CVS whichever is more convienent. :)) <a href="http://www.prestoimages.net/graphics08/648_pd212997_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.prestoimages.net/graphics08/6...</a>
aSso3n7oaa	For a good skincare routine, you'll need:<br>  <br>  - Cleanser<br>  - Toner<br>  - Some kind of acne treatment if you have acne<br>  - Moisturizer<br>  - Facial Scrub or Exfoliant (to use once a week)<br>  <br>  A Face Mask is nice to use every 2 weeks or once a month, but not a must. Just something nice to refresh you're face. An eye gel or cream is also nice to keep wrinkles from forming around you're eyes when you get older. <br>  <br>  That brand looks really nice!|`|jGBtosiCaa	If i was u i would use the Mary-Kay facial scrub it comes in 3 easy steps n makes your face feel flawless n all there makeup n products are organic and only mineral Makeup.<br>  you can order it from Mary-Kay.com<br>  if you go to the web site it tells you how and when to use each product.|`|dp06rG2Waa	you should get a face wash a moisturizer and a lotion that has spf. you might feel like your too young to worry about keeping you skin healthy but  your not! a face wash will help keep your face clean[from acne] moisturizer will keep your skin from peeling and lotion with spf will keep you from skin Cancer and keep your skin looking fresh(: in my opinion all of those items would be good not for every day put maybe once a week like the face mask. but what works for me might not work for you. read the labels to see what it help(dry skin. ect.) and see what you need!  hope this helps <3|`|Y27ovMdRaa	Sorry chica, but what works for one person may not work for you.  Unfortunately, it's a process of elimination.  Read the labels and see which applies to you (i.e. dry skin, oily skin, etc.) and go for it.  If it doesn't work, try another product.  Just know that expensive doesn't always mean better.

Never, ever dye your hair with drugstore products. I had very natural blonde hair, and then dyed it dark brown. I then went to the hairdresser to dye my hair back blond, and it took a long time because the drugstore dye ruined my hair. Most likely if you dyed your hair darker...I don't know what colour you dyed it red or brown?...it won't go back to blonde unless you go to a salon. that's just my suggestion for making sure your hair stays as healthy and possible and no weird colours come from dyeing it.|`|rWYiyIAbaa	well umm....... never again because people will think your dumb!

7XxBqUKCaa	it depends on the type of dye you use and the condition of ur hair. permanent dyes if used frequently will damage ur hair because it penetrate the hair shaft and dries out the hair. semi permanent dyes only coat the hair so it doesn't do much damage.

hmzMd5TLaa	First off, mascara doesn't do all that much to effect the condition of your eyelashes. Over curling can though.<br>  Eyelashes are naturally supposed to fall out, just like any other hair on your body. And don't worry, they do grow back, no matter what stupid people on Yahoo Answers say. ;]<br>  If you want to condition your eyelashes, you can rub some vaseline on them before bed.

And there you go!<br>  <br>  *Emma*|`|UWYHKlkCaa	Well, since its at your school you shouldn't dress too formal. I would suggest a knee-length skirt preferably lace, eyelet, high-waisted, deep-pocket, a-line, or whatever. The top could be a short sleeved blouse, graphic U-neck, etcetera. I think that pants/top would be complicated, soo a skirt can fix that without the formal-ness of a dress. Ballet flats are great shoes, and accesories should be added. Have fun!|`|VOSQpgb3aa	Do you have any high waisted skirts?<br>  if you do, wear that. if you don't want to wear a skirt...<br>  wear bright skinny jeans maybe?|`|4pKIllAeaa	wear a mask

I try to hold my breath of fresh air as I walk by the store to get to the BETTER stores I like!|`|0fGYqTFcaa	I no right. When your walking upstairs at our mall you can smell it and it's downstairs! They go a little too far. And the perfume doesn't even smell that great.|`|5ZyiHyVhaa	i like the secent. there famouse for it and there chapstick and clothes.....duh<br>  they spray that stuff on them to<br>  THE REAL QUESTION IS<br>  is is just me or does all the hollister perfues smell the same...lol :D|`|mJ4UHvKfaa	does anyone else notice it?<br>  neck.|`|LkMeHaWsaa	i notice the smell,but i like it|`|ggoWjvl0aa	that's what hollister is recognized for (well, other than shirts, duh)<br>  <br>  They have their own perfume/cologne-- and their ceiling fans spray it all over the store at random times, so the clothes always smell like it|`|jwvGjDa4aa	i know what you mean, i hold my breath before i walk in. gotta make sure i know what i want ahead of time to get outta there asap...<br>  <br>  tip:<br>  breathe through your mouth only.|`|9D3uEJMraa	Yeah, I went in there once and an employee was holding a frgrance bottle while she was going around and fixing the piles of clothes. It said: SPRAY 3 TIMES. !!!|`|wPaWtFifaa	wat smell............|`|OdZHTSacaa	i totally love it. it is what it is known for.
hmzMd5TLaa	Just talk to her and explain your feelings to her. One thing not to do is blow up at her, she won't be too appreciative of that.|`|UvQcCL8Haa	I never asked my mom. I'm 14 and all I did was take make-up from her (that she didn't use). I put it on at school it came off by the end of the day. Now, a year later she accepted the fact and bought me foundation and didn't even seem to care. You'd be surprised how your parents re-act when you ask them about it first. That way they feel trusted.|`|jwLfrIy0aa	Ask to talk to her privately<br>  <br>  Tell her that you would like to wear make up, but not alot, just enough to freshen up your look.<br>  <br>  Ask her if she could help you...if she says no to the whole make up idea...ask her why (in a really nice way)   And if she starts to yell at you..then pull the "i just wanted to be like everyone else" and then storm off and try to cry|`|BAKLvAGmaa	You should start by asking when she started to wear makeup. Just tell her if you're really interested in wearing some. Let her help you too, this will create a bond between you two. Don't go too far with the makeup either go light, and look natural.|`|LoEb08sRaa	Ask her nicely. if she still says no, just wear it at school and before u get home just take it off..<br>  <br>  or put it on at school or something.<br>  <br>  good luck hun ;;x|`|QG1w0t2daa	You should tell her how you feel, I don't wear make up though, it might destroy your beautiful skin..
kBn3UsjTaa	Here is my answer to you . . .  A 13 year old girl should not wear make up. Just because everyone around her is doing so, it does not mean that she has to do! A girl at 13 hardly has any flaws! Lets say there are some pimples and stuff, they should just let the body recover. If you cover it with make up it will clog the pores and  make your skin not healthy! So, do not make up skin  but clean it up using cleansers! :)|`|oBvFYIXJaa	mascara, lip gloss|`|8vuOwZHuaa	Put bright red blush on ur cheek bones and braid ur hair. You'll look like a movie star.|`|sZsqVmyBaa	i wear a little eyeliner, light brown eyeshadow, and mascara, but i don't wear a lot. if i go out i put on a light rose blush, but nothing dark. and i don't wear foundation or powder just if i am going out nad i have a zit or something. so i don't wear too much! i like to look natural.|`|hahwsMd7aa	something light and easy so it doesn't ruin your skin. well eyeliner , mascara and eyeshadow|`|L9b7sUbFaa	mascara eyeliner- a little bit of gold or pink sparkle shadow<br>  <br>  tinted moisturizer<br>  <br>  lip gloss|`|cvZ0cXzlaa	like lipgloss|`|LoEb08sRaa	my little sister is 13 and she wears eyeliner on top and bottom and mascara, bit of foundation, sometimes eyeshadow and a bit of lipgloss or chapstick. <br>  <br>  you can put a little bit of blush if u want, but thats optional<br>  <br>  it looks sophisticated, and not TOO TOO much.<br>  <br>  good luck hun xx|`|iFDDWPdJaa	Well I'm 13 too. I go for the more natural look, with the golds, browns, creme' and light pinks. The best place to get some fun yet natural colors is from Pur Element. I also wear foundation, but just to even out my skin tone. For that, I use Mineral Wear.(You can find this @ Target, Wal Mart, Walgreens...ect) I love it because it's light and it doesn't make your skin oily like others. To help draw attention to my eyes, I use black mascara. To add color to my face, I use the right amount of blush, just to make me look rosy. I hope this helps you!|`|KSX1XI8caa	okay a 13 year old should wear black black mascara a tiny bit of brown eyeliner and very light blush some foundation like everyone else said .wear shiny pink lip gloss dont wear lip stick .and if you want you should wear like greenish pinkish on the bottom of ur eye crease and sparkles on the topof your eye crease thats all i used to wear i still do|`|mIh685iBaa	haha when i was 12 i had the same problem...<br>  <br>  then my cheer coach [she was 17 and like my really good friend] took me to MAC and they totally help me find something natural and nothing to gawddy for a 12 year old to be wearing. just go to MAC they well totally help you|`|8f330249a3b7ffb3745449eaf089d5cdaa	i think if you apply some eyeliner lightly to your bottom liner would be a nice look for a young girl...not any thing too heavy...maybe even a lil mascara..but you got the rest of your teen yrs to get into make-up so dont rush anything|`|UvQcCL8Haa	Foundation<br>  Mascara<br>  Eyeshadow (light)<br>  Not-to-dark eyeliner<br>  Nail-polish<br>  Lipgloss|`|eYOPclZ3aa	wow 13 i would say 1 light coat of mascara and lip gloss lol really i think thats all u should wear|`|iILVZv1daa	a 13 year old should basically wear foundation (if you need to even out your skin tone) a little mascara, and a little lip gloss. You can wear more if you are going to a big event like a dance, but normally this is all you need. hope this helped! :D|`|vUPfY2wRaa	You shouldn't wear make up. Im 13 and I don't wear make up. We are too young and I heard that If we wear make up too often the pores on our faces would clog up and then who knows what would happen. Once or twice would be fine though. Buy those expensive but not too expensive ones.|`|jwLfrIy0aa	Some mascara, a light eye shadow, light blush ... Don't over do it other wise you won't look natural. <br>  <br>  Try to keep it simple, that way less time in the morning and easier to do.
Vrzn4r8Qaa	You should have gotten a barbell, when I got mine pierced the piercer told me that horsehoes reject a lot. So I'd put some bars in.|`|tWePoJYNaa	My friend tried to remove one of his. But when he was pulling it out a white string was coming out with it. Next thing he knew he was in a hospital bed. a nerve ending had wrapped itself around the ring. His body completely shut down and he blacked out because he wouldn't have been able to take that pain. <br>  <br>  I'd have someone else take it out. That probably won't happen to you, but isn't that crazy??|`|V74T9JnUaa	put in antibacterial soap then remove it from there- thats all i heard, since it can kind of slippery more and ease the swolleness...can i get a pic to give some further details?
XITPweLEaa	Do you have a sweater instead? Or a jacket? Jeans and sweatshirt are kind of frumpy for a first date. Go put on a blouse or sweater and some cute, warm accessories. Hat, scarf, gloves.|`|sV2mmEadaa	if you are a girl no,<br>  even if you are a guy, no.<br>  <br>  if you are 60 years old, then go for it.|`|jwvGjDa4aa	layer your clothes instead of wearing something bulky. cute tanks and shirts with a jacket instead of sweatshirt. doesn't look like you're trying too hard and you'll still look cute and comfortable|`|EsdHkIr3aa	It depends on were u go and how it looks usually people don't the dress up dressy but it's your dissuasion i know it's hard tho.|`|s7fKe20vaa	Yes.

7BKmhV47aa	i have had my tongue pierce for 6 years now, if it is done right and in a Professional and clean environment it is completely fine. you still are going to run on some risks but you are gonna find risks in any piecing and tattoo. <br>  after i got mine it hurt quite a bit for a week after that i never felt a thing. i carried a small thing of listerine. that helped to fight bacteria that leads to infection and since its really strong it numbed it a little. <br>  the 1st week its a little hard to eat stick with noodles of food that's east to swallow because it will be pain full. but after the week you can eat what ever you want.<br>  it will swell up for about a week also, but it will go down. <br>  i would recommend using plastic balls and a metal bar, you could use the plastic bar but i used to play with mine so much they broke easily.<br>  i have only had 2 people say anything to me about my tongue ring and they were older people 1 was my grandpa lol <br>  good luck!!!|`|DJK8yUbAaa	It's totally safe if done correctly.

But those things are rare. If you want it badly enough, get it done. Just go to a safe established service that is certified to do it. Then you'll be fine, just a bit swollen for a week or two.|`|DzLhMkRzaa	DONT DO IT IT WOILL MAKE U HAVE A LISPPPPP<br>  TRUST ME GUYS HATE IT
X6wFMuu0aa	You should wear the earrings used to pierce your ears all the time, 24/7, until your ears heal.  The piercing studs are made of high quality metal, not necessarily gold, that will not react with the inside of your ears.  This normally takes at least six weeks and there is no way to rush the healing process.  The posts that go through your ears on the piercing studs are slightly thicker than the regular earrings you will wear after your ears have healed.  This is so the holes in your ears will be slightly larger than the posts on your regular earrings and will make it much easier to put them in and take them out of your ears.<br>  <br>  When my children had their ears pierced, as soon as the original piercing studs were removed I had a jeweler file the sharp points off of them so they could wear them like regular earrings.  Then I made sure they wore their piercing studs at least once each week for 24 consecutive hours.  Usually we would put them in one night at bedtime, they would wear them the next day and the following night, then we would taken them out the second morning.  By doing this we have kept their holes at their original size and perfectly round.|`|ZjQ8yGZxaa	depends on what you're getting pierced. if it's just the lobe you're talking about then the piercer will probably use a gun which means they will have loaded a stud in to it. Another piercing where studs are popular is the upper cartilage, but once either of these heal, you can use hoops if desired. i have 11 piercing on my ears; 8 lobe piercings, 2 upper cartilage, and i just got my tragus done today (that's the boney fleshy bump that sticks out towards the front of your ear). <br>  Another thing yo consider is when getting a cartilage piercing of any kind, the piercer is more likely going to use a gauged needle. this means that the needle is hallow so when it punchers the skin, it takes a bit of the flesh with it. it's not painful if you have a high pain threshold.<br>  They don't have to be solid gold. most of the time nickel is used just because it's easy to take care of and easy to maintain, but once the piercing has COMPLETELY healed, hoops can be used in place. you might be allergic to nickel and that's when gold or sterling silver can be substituted, but im sure that everything will work out! :]]<br>  <br>  good luck with your piercing adventures!|`|kZyfbt3aaa	Its meant to be gold.. or titanium..<br>  unless you have an allergic Reaction to them..<br>  but i have pierced all my ear piercings myself and i have put fake jewelery in all of them, just fake silver and have had no problems|`|tBCWPwqcaa	Depending on where you get your ears pierced, they will have a selection of earrings, which are all safe to use. Generally, people go with gold, but really, any of their choices will be fine!|`|7GXV0aMnaa	Yes it has to be a specific type, because some people are allergic to the type of metal that is used or in the earring. It is best to go with gold or white gold. Anyways take care of your ears and have fun! =D|`|OkCUxhuxaa	I got my first piercings when I was seven years old, nearly nine years ago. I haven't gotten any more since and probably won't. I don't know if it's mandatory to go with the solid gold, but it's strongly reccommended. Plus you're going to be wearing them for about six weeks (can't change them), so you might as well like them =) Good luck|`|4S3pvbK0aa	they have to be thick studs and <br>  they don't have to be gold or silver, i<br>  t's just recommended <br>  cause most people are allergic to <br>  nickel and other metals when their ears are first pierced. <br>  And your mom is saying that cause she wants you to get a quality job on your ears|`|8Vbd1ia3aa	they should be studs, but they have to be thick. by thick i'm referring to the part that goes into the hole. they should be real silver or gold and it's good to keep them on for at least 6 weeks-8 to be sure. <br>  <br>  :) good luck|`|BtK9nSalaa	i think it does have 2 b, probably not like SOLID gold. i got mine pierced the month i was born<br>  <br>  answer mine some1? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmAWaaKOiBH44edaHPTf7LPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|z33hxpHJaa	yeah it does... :/

qPpzUAs8aa	I understand it is so difficult to deal with thin hair. I am a hairstylist and I have a lot of clients with really thin hair.  Your best bet is to wash it, no conditioner that night, put some mousse in it, sleep on it. In the morning, section very small partings, running horizontal, starting at the nape of your neck. Use a small barrel curling iron.  Spray each section with a medium hold aerosol spray.  Good luck. I know it sounds like a lot, but it's the only way!|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	You can curl it, its really hard to do with straight hair but you could try!<br>  You can spray it with hair spray then kind of froof it up so it looks kind of frizzy, its kind of a scene or punk look, that what I do most of the time lol. <br>  You can scrunch it?
le3zvYqJaa	The right vitamins and minerals play a major role in keeping your hair healthy. Any nutritional deficiencies can lead to thinning hair or even total baldness.  <br>  <br>  It is a well known fact that an under active thyroid can result in frizzy or brittle hair while an overactive thyroid turn hair greasy and limp.<br>  <br>  The bottom line to this thread is that your hair ultimately reflects the overall condition of your body.  If your body is healthy and well nourished, your hair will be your shining glory.  <br>  <br>  If you are having any health problems or suffering from any nutritional deficiencies, your hair may stop growing or show damage.<br>  <br>  If your body is in good health, you can maximize your genetic growth cycle through taking the proper blend of amino acids and B-vitamins.  <br>  <br>  It is also important to include B-6, biotin, Inositol and folic acid in the supplemental program.  It has been found that certain minerals including magnesium, sulfur, silica and zinc are also very important toward maintaining healthy hair.<br>  <br>  Beta-carotene is also essential to hair growth.  This is because it is converted to vitamin A as the body needs it, helps maintain normal growth and bone development, protective sheathing around nerve fibers, as well as promoting healthy skin, hair and nails.  <br>  <br>  Beta-carotene is found in green and yellow vegetables and fruits.<br>  <br>  And also this is GROWTH BLOCKERS!!!<br>  <br>  Excessive stress and some medications are conclusively known to retard hair growth.   If you have a medical condition and your physician has prescribed medications it is imperative that you follow your doctor's orders regardless of the impact to your hair<br>  <br>  Another secret hair helper is rest and sleep.  It has been discovered that to grow faster, hair needs an adequate amount of sleep (7-9 hours are suggested).<br>  I know this beacuse i had a short bob about 9 months ago and now my hair has grown 7 inches!!!! in 9 months!|`|zuyrHoc9aa	pull it|`|d10tsOELaa	calll the hair doctor cuzz i got a case of the love bipola|`|Zi0g5K3Iaa	HA, If you want your have long hair you can wear or add hair extensions to your hair.

2stBV6XBaa	It sort depends on which part of the '80s you're going for.  Early was more geometric in style in the new wave crowd anyway.  Later it was big, frizzy, and LOTS of hairspray.  That is probably going to be easier for you.<br>  <br>  If you have bangs, you are going to want to tease them and spray them up big.  There was something called the rake where you basically blew your bangs straight up, but with them having a little curl backwards at the top.  You also left out just a little bit of bangs to go over your forehead, but they too were curled (under) and sprayed to the point of death.  Aquanet was key.  This gives you a better idea since it's a little hard to explain.  The kid in the picture has sort of what I am talking about. <a href="http://80srewind.net/80s/images/childabuse.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://80srewind.net/80s/images/childabu...</a><br>  <br>  To crimp your hair without a crimper will depend upon just how much time you have.  You can get the basic look by braiding your hair into tiny braids all over your head.  When you unbraid your hair it will look kinky like a crimper would do.  This one you might really not have the time for though.<br>  <br>  To get it big, you can blow it dry upside down.  If you're going for the big look, the more you can tease it and make it frizzy, the better.  Just pile on the hairspray to hold it.<br>  <br>  Some more that might help:<br>  <a href="http://80srewind.net/80s/80shairstyles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://80srewind.net/80s/80shairstyles.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liketotally80s.com/1980s-hairstyles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.liketotally80s.com/1980s-hair...</a>|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	Moose, hair spray, lots of hair rollers, and a hair dryer.

AA12052982	Limit your red meat intake; take some B-Complex vitamin supplements; start exercising by taking a walk about one hour each day at a steady pace, then work your way up (by walking longer, or walking/jogging/running faster). Also, avoid iodinized salt as it can cause some bloating and water retention. Opt for little-to-no-salt; eat some smaller portions. <br>  <br>  DON'T detox. DON'T eat less than 1750 calories per day since you are still young and maturing.<br>  <br>  Avoid white flour, too.<br>  <br>  Should lose about 1-2 pounds per week.

I would suggest walking about half a mile to a mile each day, and ofter about a week lengthen your walks and start run walking. After about another week and a half of run-walking start getting off of walking and try to run only(at this point you should probably be running about 3 miles)<br>  <br>  If you run a 10 minute mile, then for every hour you keep up that pace you will burn 487 calories if u weigh 100lbs, 552 calories if u weigh 120 lbs, 650 calories if u weigh 150 lbs, 748 calories if you wiegh 180 pounds, and 833 calories if you weigh 200 lbs.<br>  <br>  here are some myths about eating:<br>  MYTH:skipping meals is a good way to lose weight.<br>  FACT: studies show that people who skip meals typically eat more than those who eat regular meals. This leads to a higher calorie intake than normal<br>  MYTH: if you limit the aount of fat in foods, you don't need to worry about the amount of calories the food contains.<br>  FACT:its is the total number of calories you consume that makes a difference in weight loss. foods that are low-fat usually contain even more calories than normal foods.<br>  <br>  Also, while bicyciling is good exercise, running burns more than twice the amount of calories. Running at a 10 mph pace is the BEST way to burn calories (about 625 calories per hour for a 100 lbs person). Jogging at about a 5 1/2 mph pace is great, only surpassed by continuous jump-roping for an hour, cross country skiing, and running at a 10 mph pace<br>  <br>  DO NOT!!!! take advice from people that are not certified in fitness instructing or nutrition or other form of exercising. They do not know what they are doing and can tell you things that may lead you to harm to your body. I have seen answers that are complete myths that can lead to dangerous muscle loss, weight GAIN, and just general injuries<br>  <br>  <br>  TO BETTER SAY WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, GIVE US YOUR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

17b3b2404d4eb6b1f8083e102c41d5a6aa	I recently highlighted my hair and it made my self-confidence soar!  I felt so pretty!  I got the Herbal Essences at home kit, the kind with the comb.  But since my hair is so "virgin" as they call it, meaning I've never colored it before, I ended up going thru with the comb once, putting the creme where I wanted it, and then taking it and rubbing extra creme in with my hands(with gloves on) to make it really stay.  It looked awesome!  Best of luck to you!|`|7ce5dd48cabadf551140ebafe1f373d3aa	Yep!

Then will you like to do the same color as your old highlights or would you like to change it?. Anyway, yes you can do it, just make sure they know what they R doing.<br>  <br>  If your highlights looks washout and you want that same color you might need a trim and then match the color of the highlights to the one you already have, if you would like highlight and lowlights it can easyly be blended, other recomendation is, have one color process done and then highlight to have uniformity, but again all depends on how long your natural color had grow.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you look georgeous with the highlights!

Prefiera prendas amplias y de tejidos naturales que dejen a la piel transpirar. Tampoco, se debe cruzar, al estar sentada, las piernas, ya que todo ello dificulta la circulación adecuada de la sangre lo que propicia la aparición de celulitis en las áreas de la cadera y los muslos. <br>  <br>  <br>  - Cuidar la alimentación. El aporte energético (calórico) no debe ser superior al que necesitas. Por lo tanto, debes tomar en cuenta lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  o Reducir las grasas saturadas al mínimo (evitar mantequilla, embutidos, etc.) y preferir carnes blancas (pollo sin piel o pescado) asados o a la plancha. <br>  <br>  o Preparar comidas bajas de sal (preferiblemente excluirla por completo) para evitar la retención de líquidos y, en su lugar, se debe condimentar con ajo, cebollas, perejil, jugo de limón y otras hierbas aromáticas. Igualmente, debes comer bananas y plátanos para obtener potasio.<br>  <br>  o Comer verduras, las hortalizas y alimentos ricos en hierro (lentejas, berro, etc), ya que la falta de éste favorece la aparición de celulitis y dificulta mucho más su eliminación.<br>  <br>  o Comer productos integrales (arroz, pasta, cereales) que absorben y eliminan toxinas.<br>  <br>  o Evitar consumir dulces simples, de absorción rápida (pasteles, chocolate, galletas, miel, etc.).los cuales deben ser sustituidos por limones, pi?as, fresas, pomelo o naranjas (no más de dos piezas de frutas al día). Todas estas frutas tienen pocas calorías y excelentes propiedades diuréticas lo cual es ideal no sólo para combatir la piel de naranja sino también hasta el estre?imiento <br>  <br>  o La leche debe ser tomada con moderación, ya que contiene azúcares de absorción rápida. Se aconseja tomar lácteos en forma desnatada o descremados para asegurar el aporte de calcio.<br>  <br>  <br>  - Beber diariamente libro y medio de agua. No tomar sodas o bebida similares.<br>  <br>  - Además, es recomendable adquirir una crema de algas marinas o reafirmante y masajear, con ella, en forma circular las zonas afectadas. Existe una′página web que tiene una receta casera anticelulítica por si la quieres elaborar tú misma en casa y luego aplicártela. Te escribo la dirección en la fuente por si acaso quieres saber cuáles son sus ingredientes y cómo elaborarla.<br>  <br>  <br>  El ejercicio aunque sea poco, es necesario para complementar las medidas para combatir la celulitis. Te aconsejo caminar, montar en bicicleta,o hacer footing, por lo menos, 30 minutos diarios y bajar y subir las escaleras siempre que sea posible en lugar de usar los elevadores. No olvide que bailar es, también, un buen ejercicio. <br>  <br>  Si su trabajo le obliga a permanecer mucho tiempo sentado o de pie, procure contrarrestar su efectos caminando alrededor de su puesto cada 60 minutos y girando, de forma circulatoria, sus tobillos.|`|NyazQLKSaa	Mientras mas delgada te mantengas menos celulitis tienes, la celulitis es la acumulación de grasa, si menos grasa acumulada tienes menos celulites, trata de sacar músculos en las piernas y veras como desaparecen.|`|PI5hyLMSaa	La  celulitis produce  oyos en la piel por la  acumulacion de  agua, grasas se  produce por desequilibrios  hormonales,dietas  ricas en grasa y  falta de ejercicio.<br>  para  tener unas  piernas lindas y  sin celullitis lo mejor  es el ejercicio,asi que camina  media  hora  al dia y las  fortaleceras, evita ponerte  pantalones  ajustados, aplica un anticelulitico  a diario y una  vez  a la semana  esta mascarilla....Mezcla  hidratantes con dos  cucharadas de sal   de  grano y frota  las piernas durante  5 minutos aclara con ajua  y  javon.|`|WhBX8QPKaa	Tomando mucha agua, hacer bicicleta ayuda bastante, ah, y en el super venden unas esponjas especiales que activan la circulación, estas te dejan la piel bien suavecita y si ayudan con la celulitis.|`|c43bbf938e45e8355d21eddad7f88571aa	1 beber agua, no utilizar ropa ajustada. yo personalmente utizo esta crema:NODUL_TART CREAM : REDUCTORA, CELULITIS, PIEL DE NARANJA_ GRASAS.

Mejor estudia, trabaja, lee mucho, ten muchos amigos y amigas, relájate, disfruta de la vida.

b29569bed17f720c4c4c164ca1648f9faa	Be proud of your curls, especially if they're natural. If you like your long hair, flaunt it. Try Infusium 23. It's a leave-in hair treatment that will help with the frizz. Use a different shampoo and conditioner--I would recommend something especially for your hair type (oily, normal, etc.). In these situations, those types of things can USUALLY work better. Check with a beautician also--they can give great advice.|`|AA10083135	<a href="http://www.hairstylestips.com/article14.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylestips.com/article14....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/stylingtips_05212001.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?story...</a><br>  <br>  try these...and also do a hairstyle that you like and dont listen to any1 that says anythingBAD about your hair! its your hair...do what you want|`|db20a6089dff5ba85faf5b6d41e26c19aa	hello there , i have the same hair , <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mysterious_hh" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/mysterious_hh</a><br>  if your hair is some what like mine i advise you to do the following <br>  <br>  1.use Nicky Clarke wave and curl shampoo and conditioner <br>  2. for a natural look leave to dry naturally , other wise use a curling moose from Nicky Clarke also and moose in while wet <br>  3. leave to dry and then take two part and clip back :> it will look great

I like boots with gauchos I think it is smart looking but you can wear most anything, heels or flats.  Again with your skirts and sweaters you can wear pretty much whatever.  If you want more specific you need to give more specifics.  I hope this helps but I am afraid I am missing something in your question.

Sometimes I had clients who were worried about the color being too dark so  I would leave it on for less time and let the client decide if they wanted it that color or a bit darker.  They can always re -apply and leave it on a little bit longer for it to be a darker shade if needed.  And remember it is very temporary.  At the most it will stay on for 4 weeks.  Good luck.

Pero segun mi experiencia  es que optes por los que sean transparentes porque tienen menos detergentes y no maltratan tu cabello al lavarlo con frecuencia. Yo casi siempre elijo los neutros de bebe... y algunos aceites para masaje del cabello que aporten  nutrición, firmeza, acondicionamiento y más brillo. Las cremas de peinar no te las aconsejo a menos que tengan un evento y realmente la necesites, si tienes el pelo liso hay unas siliconas o serum en el comercio que dan brillo y eliminan el frizz dejandote el pelo mas manejable y en cuanto al ba?o de crema... mmm mejor ponte una mascara de palta natural. <br>  Bueno a tu pregunta, de los que me das no creo que ninguno sea MALO, están mas menos en el mismo precio de venta.  No ocupo ninguno de esos pero te aconsejaría un Palmolive transparente con aroma a tu elección.<br>  Sino puedes probar tambien el Herbal Essences de Clairol, o los productos de Emolan.<br>  Saludos, espero te sirva|`|793957f42319126ab2e6090235efebacaa	pamolive|`|c3c3d75602a485ed1fafe7b904b99156aa	Dove!<br>  Por sus ingredientes y porque Dove no prueba sus productos en Animales.|`|4e93896b43e5a3e416cccad1d27468f9aa	Uy, pues quien sabe, yo uso Pantene, y da buen resultado.........|`|689b008e1627332092dbee821c1e4680aa	el dove nunca lo he usado dicen que es bueno<br>  <br>  de los demas te recomiendo pantene|`|8356220a840c0c44ff3c7496b12696a0aa	el mejor pantene no ves como me dejo mi linda cabellera !!!!|`|a78ab1ccafe267343a3f67eee3d0b42aaa	Sin lugar a dudas PANTEN, no podes compararlo con las otras marcas, sale mas dinero pero tu pelo te lo va a agradecer|`|198c16166f178e13a45a7885776b7522aa	Dove<br>  <br>  la variedad que tiene este producto es infinita.<br>  <br>  personalmente me encanta el Jabón de melón de Dove  es riquisimo..|`|212fabe810665388cfa2388eff38c3b6aa	Dove... porque Dove es Dove!!|`|3619bfe81c7b6a8a7694b3c6fcc3c63baa	palpene|`|7cec6910a8f0ce59fe4434e4daea21beaa	pues pantene o dove, mi estilista me dijo que los productos de sedal propician la caida de cabello, te paso el tip|`|b2dabbdc51ffb7694e9bf87128ed328baa	En lo personal pienso que PANTENE es el mejor a mi me gusta mucho la gama de ''liso y sedoso'' ademas huele muy rico y te deja el cabello super aedoso.|`|bad756a38980b6edad3fe881080884d6aa	En realidad, son todos regulares...

It's faster then waxing because youcan just do it quick in the shower. <br>  * Cons of shaving-If you shave against the way ur hair naturally grows you can cut yourself sometimes.or if you do it too sloppy and ur not really paying attention. <br>         -I have only cut myself like 3 times in the yrs. ive been doing it.It was because i was going super fast to try to hurry up.<br>     -i actually recommend male razors because since guys shave their face the razor has to be more precise and gentle. or venus razors. <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	waxing is best

uCRECIQRaa	well, everyone is right, bleach "stains" and has irreversible effects. Unless your mom is like Joan Crawford (mommie Dearest), I don't think you should throw them away or hide them.

If you have to do this on your own...go to a Sally's beauty supply you can get a neutral brown (probably a level 5) and also grab something with a hint of red to it. A chocolate color has a touch of red to add depth to the color...mix the two and you should be fine. Use a semi perm. developer and color!!!! Do not use permanent in your hair! Good luck

See the source box for some relevant links. <br>  <br>  There's nothing quite like research – the more you know about the clothing industry, the better. There are plenty of free informational resources out there. Check the source box for links to articles.<br>  <br>  Also, here are some book titles that may interest you:<br>  <br>  * The Official Step-by-Step Guide to Starting a Clothing Line by Jay Arrington,<br>  * The Business of Fashion: Designing, Manufacturing, and Marketing by Leslie Davis Burns<br>  * Fashion for Profit (Revised Edition with Retail Chapter) by Frances Harder<br>  * The Fashion Designer Survival Guide: An Insider's Look at Starting and Running Your Own Fashion Business by Mary Gehlhar<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

You really should take a business course in college and even manage a retail store before you take on such a venture. I see to many good shops go down the drain due to lack of education. <br>  <br>  I would like to recommend that you put clothing and shoes under one roof (especially shoes that accomodate high insteps)|`|2315145ad0a6084e8c9aa6e96eca6dafaa	you would need ALOT of money to invest in this.. but if you have great skills then you would need an average amount to get it out into market.. to find a manufacture you should do market reseach. to start your own bussiness has ALOT of commitment.. i really want to start one too lol but i'm only 13 soo what could i do.. anywho. (but please read mine.. i think it would be really helpful)<br>  <br>  to get your samples made. have a detailed design back, front view and so on. and research an exeptianally cheap tailor but does good work. you should also  wear your products, use word of mouth with family and friends they would love to help too.. like to  wear your designs occasionally etc.. create a website. with news   (about your products) pictures etc.. sell your products onine like your own website or ebay. would be helpfull @ first ( you got to start somewhere) getting your clothes in the stores is a very very hard job to do. so i sugest you start with making your own small store and know whom your target audience is (eg: teenagers, women , men, children, all) you can make cards or leaflets.. to put in peoples doors etc.. then try and look for an investor as the bussiness grows.. it would take about 6-12 months before your business is on stable ground. maybe even more. <br>  <br>  just make your decisions carefully. take a look at how much money is needed for this design to be a success in this world lol.. Industry is getting bigger and bigger eveyday. so its best if you act NOW!! lol <br>  <br>  Key points <br>  <br>  *money (budget) plan the amount of money you would need..<br>  * research. this links to money too. go around talors. advertising companies etc.. and work out the cost of all the props etc.. <br>  <br>  * commitment. DO NOT give up first round. you'll get there someday.. think of Sir alan Sugar.. (check out his bio.) lol<br>  <br>  * advertising - family, word of mouth, friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope it helped ^.^<br>  I wish you all the very best in this business!!|`|7963503589cedca67121f1f32909962daa	Hi, seems like you don't know where to start with your business.

I wear a "night" look during the day quite often!  (My husband loves it.)  But, if you're referring to "smoky eyes", here's help:<br>  <br>  I like a dark gray-brown color.  Apply just above crease, horizontally, with a quality brush.  Blend up.  It may take a few coats to be dark enough.  That's basically it!  (Keep the lid and arch area nude.)<br>  <br>  Finish your eyes with black liner.  Apply the liner as close to your lashes as possible.  Even work it in to the lashes.  (Tip: for upper lashes, this means applying from below the lashes)  Apply the liner to the inner rims of your eyes, too, if they aren't sensitive.  And apply black mascara.<br>  <br>  It may look quite dramatic during the process.  Don't freak out.  Keep going until all the eye makeup is applied.  Then you'll see how it all comes together.<br>  <br>  Keep your lips simple when eyes are dark, or it's just too much.  Clear or slightly tinted gloss is all you need.

Oh yeah, i have EXTREMELY thick hair too, and i used to always get my hair thinned out, but it never really did anything. So i talked to my stylist and she said that when you get your hair thinned out, it causes more frizz, so spending that extra money to get your hair "fixed" didnt do jack Sh*t.

They are horrible for your hair.  Even if you have been using them for a while you can stop and switch to using Lye rexalers, which are much healthier for your hair.  It is recommended that you get the first application done by a professional, but many still use no-lye and if your on a budget it may not be possible.  You can do it at home, just have a friend to help and a timer, because it is very important not to leave it in longer than the directions say.  And if you have ever color treated your hair make sure to use the MILD application, not matter what the texture of your hair is, this will still work.  You have to buy your Neuratiziling Shampoo and Conditioner separate, but trust me this is a much haelthier way to care for your hair.  I started using Lye and my hair is 10 times healthier and stronger than when I used the no-lye kit.  There's a great book, called, "Beautiful Black Hair", by Shamboosie, it's my hair bible, I definitely recommend it if you want better, healthier hair.|`|b6bb6c2a7db40c225c0c727b4bfc1551aa	divide your hair into four sections, one part going from the middle of your forehead to the middle of your back hairline and the other part from right to left, ear to ear. once you have it sectioned off, begin in the back, because the front usually begins to irritate first. begin with one of the two back sections parting portions less than half an inch thich from the middle of your head and apply the relaxer to the root of the hair. remember to begin at the top of the section and work your way down. repeat this process for each section, back two first then front two. once you've applied the relaxer, depending on the time it takes to apply try to go back through and work it into the hair. if using a perm brush you may want to take a rat tailed comb for this part to ensure that the relaxer is being worked through the hair and not just applied to the top of it also take notice to your "edges" or hair on the hairline and make sure that the relaxer is worked in throughly around your complete hairline, front and badk. once worked through in all sections the relaxer may be beginning to tingle which means burning is on the way. do not fear, there is nothing wrong, this is just the relaxer's way of letting you know it's time to wash it out. first wash the perm out with water removing as much of the relaxer as you can before using shampoo. then take the neutralizing shampoo that came with the perm and wash your hair thoroughly.  repeat wash with neutralizer 2 to 3 times making SURE to get all of the relaxer out of your hair.  lastly do one final wash with your regular shampoo, dry hair condition and style.
0a80ff56fa3352be169ed6e141740456aa	Industrial piercings take quite some time to heal. Basically you have two or more piercings connected, so if something goes wrong with one any inflammation is going to pull on the bar and effect the others. <br>  <br>  Salt water is the best thing for cleaning ANY piercing. It is safe, gentle and effective. Basically, you have salt water on the inside of your body, and by putting it on the outside, by a process of osmosis you draw the gunk out. A sac on the putside is not necessarily a sign of infection. It could just be a polyp, which is perfectly normal with piercings. It is what happens when the build-up of deadskin cells and what-not decides no to use the pathway of the piercing as an exit from the body, and makes it own way out. It gets to the skin, which is tough and forms a kind of blister. By strengthening your salt to water ration, you will dry it out and it will go away.<br>  <br>  One standard teaspoon of salt to one cup of boiled water is the best way to make up your normal dosage of saline (salt water), and the strengthened dosage should be about two teaspoons to one cup.<br>  <br>  Once the saline has cooled, get some tissues or cotton wool balls, wet it with the saline, until almost dripping and place it over your piercing for a minimum of ten minutes (though for the first little while you may want to go a little longer).  Then get a cotton tip, dip it in the salt water, clean one entry point, turn the cotton tip over (DO NOT DOUBLE DIP) and clean another. Get a second cotton tip and repeat the process with the other entries. The colder the saline, the better it will feel.<br>  <br>  Try and not sleep on the side with the piercing.  I hope this helps. :)|`|472c67ab2abaf68d886d211d64e5924faa	what is industrial ??|`|a8fad8df5c4692c5bf506415c29b04f8aa	yes that is normal! dont worry.. its still new. its only 4 days old and will be healing fo rup to a year.. it will be for almost a half year (thats how long my co-workers hurt for, was sore i mean) i have 2 cartilage piercings and got them done 3 months ago and they are still sore form time ti time. but hte sea salt soaks are the best thing to do! they help fight infections and pull out the lymph (disharge) and speed up healing and help wiht the pain just make sure you use non iodized sea salt and warm distilled water for 15 minutes at a time 1 to 2 times a day.. you dont wnt to get an infection as this can lead to cartilage collapse!<br>  <br>  and infection would be excessive swelling, pain, and green or yellow discharge. if you see that go to the pierce sjop or doctors right away to get on some anti biotics.. but you shoudl also use some aftercare pierce solution too! im sure you can find them online =)|`|21ed487d424135ce66e083d04c9ff1bdaa	An industrial is one of the most painful piercings to get on your ears.  It'll stay inflamed for about two weeks (or longer if you don't take care of it) and will have random outburts of redness even after the  inital healing period.  The easiest way to keep your ear from getting overly infectious is to make sure to keep doing your sea salt soaks, keeping hair products out of the piercings, and changing your pillowcases often.  I got my orbital done (similar piercing) and if I slept on it funny it would throb for days.  After the first 6 months I got better at sleeping off of my ear and it never got infected again.|`|522c436104c826c8d7ae856c380e4c19aa	Mine was quite uncomfortable the first week. I believe its normal. It was a few years ago, but I think youre ok. If you get a sac on either hole see a doc, you just need some antibiotics to clear up infection|`|a5a21ecb0189a66be156f93bf15051bcaa	keep some motrin in your system (200mgs) for about 3-4 days.  these helps keep the swelling down and helps you heal faster.  next, keep it VERY CLEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  a simple antibiotic rinse for cuts from your local drugstoe poured on the piercing twice a day is fine.  then follow with neosporin (generic is fine and cheaper).  use the neosporin no more then 2-3 days.  apply gently with a q-tip, this is better than a cotton ball because the cotton ball can leave loose fibers around the piercing making it prone to infection.  continue with the salt as described by your piercer.  when i did this i was fine within 2 weeks, although was careful for the full 6 month healing time.|`|AA12123697	2 weeks or more for any piercings.|`|a800e92beafc075294a1ff1c818db3b3aa	Industrial piercings, assuming it's through your ear, will take a bit to heal. Cartilage takes quite a bit to heal. The best advice I could give would be to keep it clean with sea salt (not table salt) or piercing store disinfectant. Don’t take it out to clean it tho. The hot sensations are perfectly normal. You just had a metal rod jabbed through your ear and it’s just panicking.<br>  <br>  A tip: If after a while it’s still having trouble clearing up take the bar out (or get a piercer to do it for you) and put in captive rings in until it’s healed. The bar puts stress on the piercing and it’ll heal better with rings in. <br>  <br>  Just keep it clean and keep an eye on it. If you have any pressing concerns I‘d just go to a piercing parlour and just ask some questions. They’re always happy to answer your questions and have a quick inspection.<br>  <br>  Also keep an eye on your hair products. I got the top of my ear pierced and it got MEGA infected because hair gel was getting into it. Not cool at all. So after you funk up your hair, clean the piercing. Then it’ll stay happy.<br>  <br>  Cartilage piercings take a long time to heal. Don’t expect it to be healed in six week. It’s not a flesh piercing; you went through crunchy stuff so you’ve gotta give it time. At least six months before you can whack it and it doesn’t hurt like hell. Just be patient with it and keep it clean and all will be hunky dory!

You can try all different kinds of food, and eat lots of the ones you really like.<br>  <br>  Clothes are the same way.<br>  <br>  I mean, I call myself goth.  But I wear bright colors clothes to work, sometimes even a blue sportcoat for a little more "professional" look.<br>  <br>  Change your style every day if you feel like it.

Make sure you wash your hands often.  I try to do it whenever I come home, before meals, and after using the restroom.  If there is lotion available at that point I put it on to help add back some moisture.  It is really important to add some moisture back to your body at this time of year so make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids.<br>  <br>  I once found that my nails looked their best when I was using a "leave in" style of hair conditioner.  I would rub the stuff in my hair after I got out of the shower and then not bother to wash it off my hands.  It made my nails and cuticles the healthiest they've ever been!  So my little "miracle cure" for nails has been a little hair conditioner rubbed in after every shower.  Any type works.|`|015a3a8443974dd9e02c00658dc09cd7aa	Taking care of your nails you need to clean them. Wash your hands and then clean under the nails. You need to push the cuticles back using a cuticle stick and do this gently it might be a bit painful the 1st time.After you push the cuticles back is when you use lotion on the skin around the nails rubbing it in very gently. then you can apply polish if you want.|`|9cf7b5c2530ce4ab0feb0cb4a0b0e4b1aa	If your nails are natural...first soak your nails in some warm water with some liquid soap in it, then push back your cuticles (don't cut them), then file your nails with a medium grit nail file, buff them if you choose, and apply a nice nail strengthener.   You can follow up with polish if you choose.  After your polish has dried thoroughly you can use a cuticle oil (like solar oil) and a hand cream. The kind of lotion depends on the dryness of your skin.   Don't use any kind of oil or lotion before your polish.   Hope this helped.|`|AA12074451	Well, I have very long and strong nails, and I think that it depends on the person, and what you put your nails through daily. Does your job put stress on your nails? I take a multivitamin for my hair, skin, and nails that I got at Wal- Mart for $8, but I think the main thing is just to not get stressed out or put unnecessary stress on your nails. And clip unhealthy nails right away.|`|AA12150295	Well soak them in soapy water or just take a bath. Then if you have some put cuticle cream on and push them back. After that is probably when you would want to put the lotion on and put a clear coat of nail polish on. I use sally hansens maximum growth because my nails are always short. then put on your color if you wanted one, and another clear coat on top|`|g2MoBEyXaa	Take Gelatin supplements (results in a few months) and use Mystic Nail brands.  It's cheap and it works.  Lotion after wards you paint your nails.  Any polish you put on before that will not adhere to the nails.  Hand repair usually is more intensive than cream.  Put on the repair with gloves at night and sleep (if you can stand it) and cream during the day!  Good Luck!!!

There is not cure to making it straight again. The only thing that you can do it to wait until ur hair grow out again. In the mean time you definitely want to add moisture to ur hair. Your gonna want to get a deep conditioner. ( Do this after have shampooed your hair) The best conditioner is...Mayonnaise and one RAW egg. Mix it together in a bowl and put it on ur hair for 20 mins. U should also put a plastic cap over it also. Don't sit underneath a dryer until you have rinse it out completely, otherwise the eggs will cook. This should help put the shine and soften your hair. In the meantime...its a waiting game.

But really, I think a girl can pull off anything as long as it suits her style.<br>  <br>  Obvious designer answers here would be Marc Jacobs (always popular with the young set - his bags this season are pretty great), Chloe, Balenciaga, Prada, Miu Miu (see: Net-A-Porter.com)<br>  <br>  Mid range you can have a look at Orla Kiely, Kate Spade.<br>  <br>  The less expensive route would be bags from Forever21, Top Shop, Accessorize, Urban Outfitters etc. Isaak Mizrahi has a great inexpensive range of bags at Target (of all places - I LOVE his Frame Handbag).<br>  <br>  Check out The Bag Blog for some good tips.|`|b92a27d8ed38d3b718125842844925bdaa	you should get a Juicy Couture purse. they are a lot of $. but they are soooooooo adorable!!!|`|c2wtG279aa	Louis Vitton, Gucci, Dooney and Burke, Juicy Couture, Marc Jacobs, Prada, Isabella Fiore, these are all great choices. My favorites though are Louis Vitton, Donney and Burke amd Prada or Marc Jacobs.  I only  have these types of purses, but her in the next year I will probably own one of each I named off. Oh!! and another favorite is Coach, wow those are such great quality!!! Tommy Hilfiger is also scene,|`|fXXcusRkaa	if you're talking "scene" as in emo/hardcore scene....i think a clutch is really cute...i saw one that was black w/ red polka dots, she told me she got it at wet seal
mPODUVh3aa	I haven't used that particular product by Fekkai but I use his products and I love them.  They are so far above the quality of any product I've used.  My hair is to my waist  and I color treat it, so if it can work for my hair its a great product.|`|a1530e116573abb99a554346b59e8a9eaa	The absolute best is the new brand called Organix.<br>  <br>  It has organic active ingredients and is sulfate free so it wont dry out your hair, plus...it smells awesome! Organix has different collections for different hair types which are all amazing! You can get Organix at Target, Kroger, Albertsons, Duane Reade, Safeway, etc. Its the best! You'll love it!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://organixhair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://organixhair.com/</a><br>  .
6RPLWdF6aa	You're probably not gonna believe me on this one, but solid black looks awesome on pale skin. Yes, there's lots of contrast...but black is so sexy and classic that it just doesn't matter. If you're not too sure about the black, try aquamarine. :-) I'd stay away from big prints, like the Hawaiian flower prints that were in last year and the polka dots that seem to be in this year. If you need a print, go for something small, like gingham. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!...|`|6S251CbJaa	In My Opinion Id Say Light Blue :D Or Light Pink :D Dont Choose Dark Colours Or Ur Pale Complexion Will Stand Out|`|InKjp3cZaa	Well, i'm very pale and i wear reds, baby blues and even bright yellow anything light of some dark colours|`|SLn05l7Saa	you should not wear any real lite colored bathing suits abd dont wear black you could wear a blue green or red hope this helps|`|cafea661e3fce1da868ce36e2a3c3d25aa	I'm pretty pale and my tankini is dark green with light green trim and design on the one hip of the bottom and on each breast. I look really good in those colours. they're don't make me look pasty, they actually seem to make my skin look better...<br>  <br>  Try not to go with any bright or pastel colour because they're too light and will make you look pasty. If you go to dark like black they make you look too white.<br>  <br>  So stick with a not to dark to neatural colour./|`|miU2WygPaa	what?

yMXWrhL4aa	I have the same problem!  But I'm 18 and I wear a size 18 jean...lol.  The best pants I have ever found (a couple of years ago, and they were a size 11 or 13, I believe) were Lucky Brand jeans.  The only problem with them were that they were very low rise and I tore them up from pulling them up all of the time.  Just make sure that if you buy them that you have a lot of room to move around in them.  They might have some higher rise pants as well, though.  But it is definitely worth checking out.  But that brand is normally pretty pricey, just for the warning.  It is hard for us big booty girls!|`|AdwPejNmaa	Go to Boscov's and purchase either (or both) of these two brands called, "new attitude" and "Hydraulic"....they are the BEST brands (imo) of jeans out there for women...My cousin's the one that got me buying them, and she's a fashion photographer for Vogue magazine, so she knows!!|`|DaCwd2doaa	try jeans from american eagle|`|Oddr8eqZaa	i would go to american eagle they honestly have the best jeans.

If you have split ends, it doesn't matter what shampoo or conditioner you use - you will still have split ends. My advise: get a regular trim (every 4-6 weeks) and don't straighten your hair daily. Any professional stylist will advise you against this. If you insist on straightening often, be sure to invest in a high quality ceramic straightener. Anything less will cause significant damage. Also, treat your hair with care. Get a professional deep conditioning treatment every time you get your hair trimmed (due to all the heat styline), or, if you are on a budget, deep condition once a week at home. You can purchase a really good deep conditioner, or use mayonnaise.|`|3f561a1de6b35079d16f1ebb54f8cbcdaa	ewwwwwww DO NOT USE AUSSIE! all they do is make your hair look greasy!! use pantene! try hot oil treatments. and use little scissors to snip off the dead ends|`|7uHajSH5aa	I use Pantene and I straighten my hair a lot too and it's helping also you can try tre semme which is also good but you should look for the heat protectant products they have tre semme brands that are good. You should also use some procclaim anti frizz oil and it works really great and it makes it shinier and look healthier too. You can get that oil at Sallys Beauty Supply. It's the best ever well for me and I can't live without it. You should really try it.|`|HiGiKRIZaa	Try Sunsilk|`|6d59e489a4c5aa89df33c7d7eda92e3caa	Silk Elements is such great stuff.

AA11102058	No it won't grow back together, ever.  Your nails grow from the cuticles, by the time they get long enough to be broken they're dead.  You just have to wait for it to grow out, then clip it off and grow a new nail.|`|brGQhi3Uaa	nope, it will take months to grow back. they never re attach
AA10928125	sounds cool..it is definitely a fashion down in Texas,but we forgo the pantyhose...because it's so hot and humid,,we can practically wear shorts on the gulf of mexico all yr.round,and flip flops although about 3 yrs ago it snowed in Galveston,,astonishing pictures!at christmas.|`|tUW0A9iPaa	haven't seen that much of this in US but dI do like it|`|tAz8ExJwaa	I don't know where you live but I live in Spain and this has never been the fashion. <br>  <br>  I don't think you can say ''it's the fashion here in Europe'' the countries and people in Europe are so diverse and different, we don't always follow the same fashion. And if I've ever seen someone wear shorts, tights and heels (it's too hot here for the tights in the Summer, but in the Winter it's not) it's one or two people, but it's definatly not a fashion trend over here.
WV2YJlJFaa	I like Coppertone's Oil Free Sunscreen Lotion. It's really light and doesn't feel like thick heavy lotion.

This is what a dermatologist recommended for me when my skin was acne prone.|`|EoyQIyOPaa	I like Arbonne's Before Sun products.  The only oil in them is avocado oil which increases moisture and contributes to the skin's smoothness and elasticity.  I used it at the pool last summer on myself and my kids and was asked several times what we used because of the lack of reapplication and no sunburns.  The children's line is effective for everyone and safe for all skin types.

Growing up I was always told to put it in a braid when i slept at night to help it grow. I guess its cause it pulls on the hairs and stimulates their growth more. <br>  Good luck with that.|`|ab16504c84de6ec6783ff980f4bc2708aa	As far as I know the fastest my hair grows. I would have to say braids on my hair. My great grand-ma and grandma use<br>  to always braid my hair every night. before I went to bed.Whitch helped my  hair grow very long.  Don't wash your hair every day  three to four times at the most because our hair produces oils that make our hair grow. Washing our hair every day washes oils away that produce hair to grow. I Suggest you try it for a good month or two and see the results<br>  p/s Might I so suggest not to wash hair in hot water. It can cause hair lost and might prevent hair from fast growing fast use Luke water to wash hair .

Any longer and you could damage your hair.

Xq6zIKoIaa	My BF is very into working out and supplements. He started workign out when he was sixteen and weighed like 150 now hes 20 and weighs almost 200 lbs and not any fat on him. He takes supplements put out by NoExplode in a red bottle. He takes creatine, and weigh protein. (the pure weigh it the healthiest and most natural, but he started off with a creatine weigh blend and has gotten huge.) With abs its not like you other mucles where yuo can do 8-10reps 3 or 4 sets, you have do to like 100 a day, adn you'll see results. Having the muscles underneath will burn more calories and fat.|`|AA10036924	Quit doing all those d@mn crunches!  Its a waste of time because Abs are 80% diet and 20% exercise.  The key is to burn fat like crazy.  Everyone has Abs - but most peoples are covered by a layer of fat.  Go low carb/ high protein and do HIIT.  Creatine will help your body build muscle and gives you tons of energy for your workouts.  Some people swear by it. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AcJ6It8kaa	There is no such thing as 'easy abbs' you will have to work hard to get abbs and biceps.

He does have a wedding/funeral  suit -- but if he is not part of the wedding party, just going to be part of the congregation.  The very least I could get him to wear is a nice dress shirt, perhaps a tie -- and his Dockers.   Usually, he puts that stuff on, looks in the mirror, then compares himself to me and decides if maybe he should put on his suit.     <br>  <br>  It's the BRIDE's day, and anyway, the amount of dressing up for the occasion is proportional to the amount of respect or friendship he has with the groom/bride/couple.   (in other words, if it was my friend he didn't know, he'd go with the Dockers, but if it was his best friend or someone he respects, he'd get out the suit.)<br>  <br>  As far as etiquette goes, I think it's a standard suit - but I don't know that kinda stuff.|`|99qhYBxKaa	if he likes to be casual and comfortable tell him not to worry about a suit.<br>  go for a nice pair of striped dress pants, and a button up collared shirt. maybe even find him a funky wool or Cotton vest.<br>  the important thing i think is the shoes. get a really funky pair of dress shoes. snake skin ones or a dark chocolate or tan shade. make sure he is matching, do his hair, wash his face, spay on his Cologne and he will look great :)<br>  good luck|`|a3561656dd695e772a873dffcb7cdf66aa	a really nice button up shirt and a pair of dressy slacks. and dress shoes.  a tie is optional. yes he needs to tuck in the shirt. <br>  <br>  he may want to wear a jacket also since it is a winter wedding. <br>  <br>  take him shopping and see what looks good on him. it could be fun for you two to pick something out together.
eCUoXUKSaa	Don't get a colored one. I had a blue one and for some reason it definitly didn't work as well. Get the regular generic black one or the chi turbo. I've had both and they are awesome. I use the Chi turbo right now. It's the best.|`|AA10872057	i have used the orginal chi for over 4 years and love it. it's 1 in. wide.<br>  <br>  i think the colored ones are a little cheaper. you should expect to pay about 100.00 (even on eBay) for a good one. be careful on ebay....some people list CHI in the title but it's actually just a hair product that comes with it. be sure the iron says chi on it.....|`|17Dq1XLqaa	Chi's vary in colors and width. I personally like the thinner width chi's because they allow you to straighten your hair closer to the scalp. As for colors, that is your choice.

0407acaf7db72543efe9209187b8d4e5aa	If your back doesn't hhurt from now, I would suggest to wait on the reduction. If they are in your way, try a new bra like a sports bra. It'll help you keep them in controll. I don't think it's really safe to have a reduction at your age, but if it really bothers you, maybe you should look into it later. Also, do your research, consult your doctor and ask others who have gotten the same thing done with the surgeon you plan to do. Also try to get a second opinion, as there may be risks unknown to the first doctor. And if you don't feel comfortable, don't do it. good luck|`|8fefea315049a4c2003c36c215e20ac6aa	you could consider it if they're extraordinarily big. but 18 is too young. wait till 21!|`|wNOR4MHtaa	if it already hurts or if you know it is going to hurt later in life i would definitely  think about it do research<br>  <br>  my aunt has huge boobs and she always complains that her back hurts but she wont get a reduction because  she is stubborn|`|VhSxPD4Taa	If your back hurts get a breast reduction.|`|w5Lgcxi4aa	You should if it is going to affect the way you live your life.

bLUHq5M8aa	OK, jergen's gradual sunless tanner for med-dark skin tones works wonders! Especially if you use it in conjunction with loreal's gradual sunless tanner for med-dark skin tones. Even if you are very pale, the med-dark shade will still be ok for your skin... since it is a gradual one, it will work with your natural complexion color to give you a very natural, streak free tan. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend mystic tans, they aren't very accurate because the machine sprays the same amount of solution over your whole body and face, which gives you a streaky, unnatural, orangeish tint. <br>  <br>  Airbrush tans are good, you can get them done at a spa or tanning salon. What you do is you stand there naked or in a swimsuit, its a matter of modesty preference, and someone manually sprays you all over. Since it is a person spraying you, the tan turns out very even and accurate because they go lighter on areas that tend to be drier like knees, elbows, ankles, so that the color isn't too too dark there. It runs about $35 per session, but you can get them for a cheaper rate if you buy more than one session at a time. <br>  <br>  The thing you should remember though, whatever fake tanning product you use, is exfoliate your whole body and face thoroughly, shave, and DON'T moisturize! You want the tanning lotion to be your moisturizer. Add the tanning lotion, wait for it to dry for about 4 hrs, then reapply as needed until you acheive your desired level of color (these times and instructions will vary if you get a mystic or airbrush tan. They will tell you exactly what you need to do.) Then, remember to moisturize every day, and reapply your sunless tan about every 3 days (just one coat). Wash your body with a washcloth, as loofahs tend to exfoliate, causing your tan to fade prematurely. <br>  <br>  As you probablly know, tanning beds are horrible for you. They harm your immune system, cause premature aging, wrinkles, freckles, and of course theres a risk of skin cancer. I worked at a tanning salon for quite a few months, and acheived a very pretty, deep bronze tan. I have an olive skin tone, so I was extremely dark, yet it took a long time for me to get to that level of tanness. But I got sick (due to excessive tanning), and stopped tanning for one week, and after only a week my color had lightened about 5 shades! Its not worth it! I only use sunless tan now and a little bit of sun exposure, and all my friends agree that it looks real. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps:-) Good luck!|`|MhdDDEqKaa	Thats what i'm going to do too,because im the same way!<br>  But im not sure which one I'm going to use yet,they have various  kinds.|`|hw6NxOp2aa	natural glow. i love that stuff and use it during the winter time. it looks health and doesn't look fake like most tanners.|`|c1FxznQsaa	i think it is best to use suntan lotion and sit outside. it may be boring but its the best way. any creams of spray on tans give you wrinkles!

1mtsOtQsaa	Glue|`|RyzKiJe0aa	Blowdrying your hair out after washing your hair and then using the flat iron usually works better than using the flat iron on air dried hair.  Using hair products that help to keep moisture out of the hair (like the Paul Mitchell Skinny line) can also help.  But if you live in an environment that is really humid and you're outdoors a lot, it's probably not worth your while to flat iron your hair every day because there is no way hair can stay straight (or curly, if you use a curling iron) if the air is very moist.  If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you could try a relaxer.|`|7H7GSLRyaa	Me and my firends try anything to keep our hair straight and we have found the best product to use is panteens relaxer creme and beleive it or not a cheap kmart $20 strightner works better than any off the $200 ones we have .

Vabxhfm8aa	You need to use heavier weights when you do squats.  My favorite is the bar which is on a guided up/down track.  The best way to go about it is to start off either using just the bar (because most are quite heavy) and work your way up to 10lbs on each side.  Place the bar on shoulders and standing on one leg (carefully centered) slowly do a squat.  Then after 15 reps, switch legs.  Do about 2 sets to 3 sets per leg.  Be sure that your knee does NOT go past your toes or you are probably doing it wrong.<br>  <br>  Be safe and good luck!  :-)|`|46b280af3228ed855e1f73a074d31a97aa	It mostly depends on genes.<br>  I was one of the lucky ones born with it {Lol}<br>  <br>  But you should eat more carbs, like whole grain bread, rice, and pasta.<br>  <br>  Some really good foods to eat would be<br>  -cornbread<br>  -pasta<br>  -spaghetti<br>  -brown rice<br>  -rice & beans<br>  -wheat bread<br>  <br>  Also, you should do lots of lunges and start walking/running/jogging.<br>  <br>  Another exercise is to raise your leg off the floor, it should be straight and up no higher than your belly button but should not touch the floor at any point. <br>  Keep your leg raised for two minutes.<br>  Once the two minutes are up, you need to do the other leg.<br>  <br>  Do this exercise twice a day.<br>  <br>  Two minutes may not sound like long, but it will be the longest two minutes after the first 30 seconds are over!<br>  It will start to burn and it's good if you have a TV show or music to distract you.|`|fc980aa010239cf4795d1041957a6d59aa	well dosent it come naturally well my friends do lunges and they ask me if i do them but i would say no its just natural <br>  well i hope it is coz wen i got into 8th grade my *** was like humongo biggg!<br>  well thats what my mom said i asked her how do i got big *** than she said most punjabi ppl have them natuarally|`|6af567029638d52a1fffee8d3f4e532faa	well you can first do a cardiovascular workout like running. do that for about 10-15 minutes. then do some lunges, squats or a weight machine that targets the area you want.|`|U39tACbHaa	really big butts are nasty. but i bet yours looks fine. don't worry about it. but if you must... eat a lot of junk food or do tennis or excercises that require you to use your legs.|`|qqs3RxJWaa	lunges|`|6d52f4cdbd5b2de57077518207cb3f30aa	u need to eat a lot,eating helped me get a big a.s.s & big boobs|`|9e9770e1cd569a2a24556ab620928aaeaa	butt flexes|`|AA10251660	i don't know how to get it bigger. i think its a nature thing.|`|rGAzlfZSaa	Lunge!

dd3fadc2aabea0f4290576ef45cd2420aa	Well, considering that I get it done every 6 weeks, I am a pro! For me, all of the hair comes off. You could get a shape if you wanted. You have to first take ALL your clothes off the bottom part of you. Then climb onto a bed/table thing. The waxer asks you to lay on your back and relax. They ask you if you want it a certain way and stuff. Then they put hot wax on your front. Little by little, rip by rip, yell by yell the hair is all gone! If there are stray hairs they take tweezers and pluck them out. Then you open up your legs like your having a baby, but roll a little bit more onto your shoulders so the waxer can wax the hair next to the lips. After that you go in doggie position, the waxer spreads your butt apart, and waxes your hair on your butt. All stray hairs are plucked and you're done!|`|tTnX75Eiaa	they remove all the hair down there making u look and feel smooth.  they dont shave it though, they wax it.  its a bit painful but the result is great|`|63b27c9c95ad9fa3873642d32597bbb7aa	They usually remove all the hair unless you tell them exactly what you want.

If you decide to do, take a pain reliever at least one hour before you go. Don't be shy because you're going to be fully exposed. They are very professional and do this all day. Don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions, let them know it's your first time.|`|GwcJpb36aa	They wax all the hair off apart from a landing strip.

RssRY2jaaa	sterling silver is actually only an alloy of silver that contains 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% of other metals, usually copper. in sterling silver, the silver is alloyed with copper for example to give the object of sterling silver its strength. im actually one of those people who gets a reaction / rash unless its at least 14k gold / white gold.|`|4b603ee7697a0b2cdde3ba4a631a0672aa	no doubt that it's a real silver.. but mostly sterling silver jewelery is harmless and anti-rash.. anti allergic|`|F2UqPPcDaa	yes|`|9syZOhTgaa	Some people are allergic to silver!  I knew a woman years ago who had beautiful bracelets and rings made by Indians in New Mexico, and after she bought them she found they made her break out.  So she painted them on the inside with clear nail polish and then she could wear them.  I don't know if that would work with a necklace.|`|VJ71lymOaa	sterling silver is actually a high quality silver
zxhWJorLaa	I have extremely curly hair and to keep my locks in check I use "be curly" shampoo and conditioner by Aveda. It helps to tame that frizz from your curls while making your them more defined. I also use and love "mixed chick" hair gel, shampoo and deep conditioner. This stuff is the best because they specifically make it for "curly" hair and it tames our natural curls without making it feel hard or weighed down.<br>  <br>  Now to straighten it you need a flat iron. You can also use a straightening enhancer by "luster silk".  It not a relaxer or perm its just a liquid spray that helps to make curly hair straight. That stuff straightens the heck out of some hair. You just section off your hair after its washed, spray it on, and let it dry naturally or use a blow dryer. Once its dry use a good flat iron to straighten it. Follow up with a light hair serum like "frizz ease" which is more affordable or "Paul Sebastian Laminates". That's what works for me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you because it sure does help me!<br>  Good Luck!|`|UCpJwzqnaa	there is a curl enhancing scrunch apray by bedhead that is heat activated. That works pretty well....it cuts down on the frizziness. I use a flat iron along with a heat protecting spray to keep my hair from getting damaged. Herbal Essence makes a great flat iron finishing spray that smells great.

It is the most expenisive, most dynamic and can be the most "life-changing" procedure we do. <br>  Every single on I did I had clients call and gush over me the next day. I am not exagerating. I don't have curly hair so I was blown away at the beginning...at how much it actually changed peoples lives. <br>  So it is worth it, it really is but only if your spend the proper money on the proper product...<br>  There is one that I use and every top stylist in Hollywood that I know uses.... Its a brand that has been around for 20 years and anything around that long - well you know they know what they are doing....w<br>  when i first heard about that whole japanese straighteing thing....the last thing in chemical straighteining you want to do is "something new"..........i want something "safe" and something I know WORKS. If I really explained what the chemicals were it would freak you out....i wouldn't want anyone screwin around with them.......without years and years of testing...<br>  So go to the website of this company.....and they have a Salon Locator.....so you can find a salon in your area that has the proper product.....then find the person that has done at least 50 procedures..... so they have it wired and its done correctly.<br>  When it is.<br>  You will love life. <br>  But just know that trying to "get it for a deal" is NOT the right path in this particular area.<br>  Do your research and you will be thrilled.<br>  <br>  If you have any type of lightener or bleach on your hair....you must grow it out...don't let anyone tell you any different - I know how to work around it and I know a very very few people who can....but u don't need to)<br>  <br>  the company:<br>  Avlon Industries<br>  Affirm Straightening<br>  &<br>  Fibergaurd Straightening|`|AA12345084	Well first of all, you should get have your hair straightened in a respectable salon or parlor to avoid mishaps. There are primarily two options for chemically straightening your hair. It's either rebonding or relaxing. Rebonding costs more. The likes of Avril Lavigne's hair and Sauron hair from LOTR are products of rebonding. Since it costs more it's effect is longer. Relaxing is more temporary and is used more by people who do not really have very curly hair. It's commonly used by people who like you have wavy hair or just unamangeable hair. Relaxing or rebonding can become permanent to the hair depending upon the kind. My friends have had their hair relaxed and most of them has it already permanent, they need not go to the salon anymore for maintenance. The cost depends upon how thick and how long your hair is. Afte relaxing or rebonding it is advisable to do a celophane so that your hair doesn't break and dry off. (:|`|DvDFpxscaa	I'm friends with a lot of Indian girls and they SWEAR by chemical straighteners. They get it professionally done, and it makes their hair really smooth and silky. The end results don't depend on hair length; they depend on hair texture. Fine hair might become more fragile, like it would with any chemical treatments.

6f7e004a00b965a2011d76b82235ac9eaa	I was told 3-5 times a week by my hair stylist.  If you use it every day it can actually dry out your hair, which will make your scalp itch, thus causing more flakes.|`|63d76b464374377fa32c430a08fbd87faa	As often as directed. If you have time to wash ur hair at least twice or three times a week go ahead.But don't exceed 3 times because the hair has its own moisture stores and u wud be stripping the hair of its natural oils if u wash it too often.<br>  But u could also consult ur dermatologist or ur tricologist if u are unsure.

This'll give you a smooth surface to work on. You can buy facial exfoliater from the supermarket. I like St Ives apricot scrub.<br>  Next apply moisturiser. Wait 10 minutes, and then apply your foundation. When applying foundation, use as little as possible. If you want to add more, you can do so later. Apply it down the center of your face and blend outwards. Or you can put a dot on each part of your face (forehead, nose, cheeks, chin) and rub it in. Try to use an upward blending motion. Be sure to blend well at the jawline.<br>  <br>  Next apply the concealer on blemishes or whereever you feel its needed.<br>  <br>  After the concealer you can apply the powder over your blemishes only or all over your face. Powder sets the foundation and makes it last a little longer.<br>  <br>  If your acne/cheeks are red, you might also like to use a green colour corrector (i like physicians formula) after you moisturise and before you apply the foundation. The green colour corrector tones down redish blemishes.
cBMwHdn4aa	I had a pixie cut, let it grow--how awkward that can be.  Now it is a bob, but it has a deep swing, angled down toward my face and the back is still short because I'm still trying to grow it out.     You should try working with angles, layers or bangs.  Anything you do should be ok, I'm sure you didn't really look like a fella!    Good Luck!

69GgJhnWaa	Listerine is used on tongue piercings to help keep them clean. Nowhere else. For other piercings use sea salt and antibacterial, unscented soap. Wash it twice a day and DO NOT PLAY WITH IT. It will cause infection. DON'T use neosporin or any type of hydrogen peroxide or alcohol.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Dial soap is harsh and will dry out your piercing, prolonging healing time. It can lead to the formation of scar tissue. You also need to move the piercing around to clean the soap out of it, which tears the healing tissue.    Listerine is way too harsh and using it as aftercare for a piercing can kill off the good bacteria in your mouth, leading to thrush (yeast infection in the mouth)    A good rule of thumb: if it stings don't use it.

IIaqWrtJaa	as long as you think they look good that is what really matters.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Only you know if you have too many piercings, it's a personal thing.    Corset piercings are going to hurt, just like any other piercing. Except that you're getting multiple piercings in one sitting. Please also be aware (if you aren't already) that corset piercings are generally considered temporary, as it's very difficult to heal them, even with proper surface bars (and you need to be 18 for surface piercings)|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I went through a piercings fad at your age, and felt the same way. At the end of the day, no real harm is done, it's not like you're covering yourself with tattoos at such a young age - that would be really dumb - at least piercings can be removed. I've taken almost all of mine out now, the only one I would have kept is my tongue but that randomly became infected after a year, so now they're all gone except ear cartilidge and tragus. My only regret is the four I had on my stomach in a cross shape. My weight fluctuated over the years and the holes became stretched and unsightly. Then I had a baby at 20 and even though I took the piercings out, it messed my belly button up forever. I'd recommend you take that one out, I know a lot of kids have it done and most are lucky but if you have stretchy skin then even if you don't have children, there's a good chance it'll go horrible over the years. Speaking from experience. But yeah, other than that, no long term harm done I guess, I don't have a single visible scar from any of my piercings (other than stomach of course). It does make me wonder though, how your parents are ok with this? I never had as many visible ones as you and I had to keep taking them out around them, but surely you couldn't possibly do that with so many. And as for the people at school - I would tell your school, they need to crack down on bullying, but at the same time it makes me think perhaps they're not so brilliant on the discipline front if they allow students to have that many piercings in the first place?|`|6UKd0Gedaa	ew, yes. piercings are very unatractive on women|`|vJRMmgd6aa	wow at 14 i only had my ears pierced cause my mom wouldnt let me get anything else, wtf is wrong with parents these days?|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Yes you have too many piercings. Your parents are okay with all of these?   At some time in your life they won't represent who you are, and you will regret making all of these holes in your body. Quit while you are ahead and can still fly without setting off the metal detectors.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	No reputable piercer would ever do a surface piercing on a minor - let alone a bunch of them to create a corset. They are temporary...even if done properly you have a high risk of at least one of the piercings rejecting after awhile. And since you're still growing, the risk of rejection is a lot higher.    Honestly, yes, I think it is too much. You're just too young in my opinion. My piercer would never pierce all of those on a minor....there are many many ways to bring out your personality, piercings shouldn't be the only way. And it's just so much more fun to get pierced without having your mom sitting next to you.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	My, you have a relaxed school, allowing you to wear all those piercings.    And no, I don't think there is anything wrong with having that many piercings - if you like it, that's all that matters - ignore all the conformists.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	Yes, you have too many. No piercing agent in the UK should be doing more than ears on a minor, and only then with parental consent.|`|mlAI5S5Eaa	i have just as many.and no i dont think that you have to many piercings. i think they are a way of expressing your personality. keep doing what you are you doing!       and yea ive heard that the corset piercing does hurt, so if you plan on getting that done then more power to you!|`|4yHAsSLVaa	I spose its up to you.

I dont know lol    xxxx|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	I dont think its too many if it suits you, and you like them.  They are just piercings...they can be taken out.

Oh, and I think its time to punch some people at your school. lol|`|P1VoMS36aa	yes.  you have nice parents letting you get them done.  at 14 with that many is dangerous as,as you have mentioned others trying to pull them out.  it could leave you with serious scars if one was to get ripped out  xxxx|`|AA11451457	Whoever the hell pierced your belly button at 14 needs to be reported.

So who cares, you're 14, piercings can close up, and you've still got a few years at least til you start looking for jobs.    Also, do your research on the corset piercing before you get it, while I am pro kickass piercings, that is a pretty big thing to do.|`|H4aMzS1qaa	I have Ears x3 and my Belly button and i'm 14 as well to be honest i think you have got too many|`|pluPzfVMaa	No you don't have too many, you're just being yourself! =) I totally understand your love for piercings and I wish I could get more but my job wont allow it.

Afuz041haa	I would NOT recommend colorsilk.  I used it before and it really dried my hair out and left it damaged for quite a long time.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend Nice and Easy, or Preference.  Also, the semi-permanent dyes (like Natural Instincts or ColorSpa) work well, especially for dying your hair darker.  The semi-permanent ones are ammonia free, so they won't damage your hair like permanent dyes will.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that black is pretty much impossible to get out.  Even if you use semi-permanent (the kind that says it washes out in 28 days), it'll stay.  This could be nice if you want to stay with black hair for a while, or it could end up being a pain if you're the type of person who likes to dye their hair a lot.|`|AA10012193	I use colorsilk all the time.<br>  The conditioner really hydrates my hair : )<br>  <br>  Loreal Feria works good but is on the spendier side.<br>  <br>  Colorsilk is your best bet if you want good results for cheap!|`|YULvtjbvaa	IDK
of049X1waa	bands: Bright Eyes, Aquabats, any retro band, or maybe the Hush sound...    try shopping places like Urban Outfitters.  They have trendy, kind of boho clothes so you can get stuff that is kind of indie without it being too weird.  Also, consignment stores or vintage stores.  Try to mix and match, like if you're wearing an old fashioned shirt wear new-looking or regular jeans so the outfit as a whole is balanced out.  I think the indie look is really cool!  good luck!|`|0fE4qkPyaa	Forever21 has alot of indie styles.They have pictures of indie outfits on the website.  http://www.wikihow.com/Dress-Indie  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/search.sets?...  http://www.forever21.com/default.asp  http://www.forever21.com/category.asp?ca...

UYnZtJ2daa	Hallow needles are what are proper for piercing...it's how the jewelry is put in so easily.    However, there is nothing safe about piercing yourself at home. Way too much bacteria for it to be sterile there...even if you did just clean it there is no way it's as clean as a piercing place keeps their rooms.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	I honestly have no idea.

ab9bVxvtaa	Hola, a parte de consultar a un flebólogo que sería lo más acertado como te acaban de aconsejar, también puedes empezar por hacer ejercicios físicos, uno de los mejores es caminar... viste cuando después de caminar bastante se sienten como unas cosquillas en las piernas, éso es porque está circulando la sangre. Así que prueba con éso y también visita al médico.<br>   y otra cosa al margen pero importante es la ortografía, si al momento de escribir no buscas en el diccionario las palabras si haces click en comprobar la ortografia, te las corregirá, yo hace poco que estoy en esto y hay muchas personas que veo que no se preocupan por escribir, y es muy importante, especialmente cuando se quiere buscar un trabajo... perdona si te ofendí, espero que no, es sólo un consejo, ?un beso!|`|S54QvSHsaa	Lo mejor que puedes hacer es consultar a un flebologo.<br>  suerte!!!!!!!!!!|`|3dgA6cUzaa	Visitar a un medico especializado en circulacion periferica, el sabra que tratamiento recomendarte pues es muy delicado este tema de las varices.|`|17d0a177a0ac2bb4b6018b344fd0b9d0aa	si es mala circulación en las piernas , te cuento te acostas sobre una alfombra boca arriba con las piernas estiradas vas levantando de a poco ,diez veces a la m?ana diez veces a la noche; caminar quince minutos todos los dias te activa la circulacion, ó acostada frente a una pared con las piernas levantadas y apoyadas en la pared......|`|izU5TRdPaa	Hay cremas para la mala circulacion y hasta pueden desaparecer dependiendo del grado de hinchazon, acostarse con los pies hacia arriba, o visitar un medico.

d2ad0b005aa2bc30e29096ea659195b8aa	Wenn Deine Haare nicht besonders fetten oder durch die Arbeit oder so dreckig werden, reicht es sie ein bis zwei Mal pro Woche zu waschen. Man kann Haare durchaus überpflegen, einmal pro Woche eine Kur reicht aus, so wie es drauf steht und nicht jeden Tag waschen.|`|f7649d8835dfac6848018bcf10cc7e6daa	Ich wasche meine Haare, wenn sie anfangen, fettig zu werden. Das ist je Tag zwischen 2 und 3 Tagen. Also meistens wasche ich mir 2x die Woche die Haare.<br>  Wenn man sich jeden Tag die Haare w?scht, kann man die Talgproduktion anregen, und dann werden sie schneller fettig. Sagt jedenfalls meine Friseurin.<br>  überpflegen kannst du sie auch. Wenn du jeden Tag eine Spülung machst oder Conditioner verwendest, dann legt sich das Zeug wie ein Film um deine Haare, und sie werden schmierig und auch eher fettig. Es schadet dann mehr, als es hilft. Wenn du eine Kur oder Spülung anwenden willst, reicht es ein bis zweimal die Woche. Auch das sagt meine Friseurin. ;-)<br>  Für gef?rbte Haare gibt es extra Shampoos, die die Haare mit Feuchtigkeit und N?hrstoffen versorgen. Du solltest darauf achten, dass du nur solche Shampoos benutzt. Die gibt es von verschiedenen Herstellern. Ich selbst wasche mir die Haare mit Clairol Herbal Essences Shampoos. Aber früher, als ich noch ein bisschen mehr Geld für meine Pflegeprodukte ausgab, hab ich die Shampoos von Kerastase und Redken benutzt, die kann ich dir auch besonders für koloriertes Haar empfehlen.

Manchmal t?glich, manchmal jeden zweiten Tag. Den Haaren macht das nichts aus, wenn man ein schondendes Haarwaschmittel benutzt und von Zeit zu Zeit eine Haarfeuchtigkeitskur anwendet. Man will ja einen frischen sauberen Eindruck manchen und sich wohl fühlen. Haarkuren sollte man nicht t?glich machen, weil die Haare sonst zu weich werden und die Frisur nicht mehr richtig h?lt.

Asi que mejor asegurate que vaya con tu rostro. Si tienes mucho pelo, te sale mucha barba y tus rasgos son toscos no te veo bien con una ceja delineada pero si tus rasgos son finos, tu pelo casta?o claro y te sale muy poca barba o en lugares ni siquiera se te forma, una delineada (no claro estilo a?os 20 ni chica) te haria lucir mucho mejor.

7D8StgxOaa	K since you have a "boyish look" she will not think that you are abusive or violent.  she will think that you stand up for what you believe in, because now your face will show a contrast.  You will seem boyish with a man-like personality.  what you need to do is tell her that you were standing up for your friend.  You need not get into the details, but tell her you saw your friend getting hurt, and you went out to protect him.  I strongly doubt she will dislike you for a black eye.  If you got her close enough to go out with you, this will just be an interesting thing to talk about.<br>  Hope this helps|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Just tell her the truth besides the guy hit you first, it's not like you attacked him for no reason.|`|KDrztUEpaa	tell her," you should have seen the other guy." lol<br>  jk jk<br>  just explain it was kinda in self defense or dont even mention it unless she asks.|`|AeJp5CVeaa	Well, to be honest, I wouldn't like a guy who beats up others, or gets beat up himself. The bruises and wounds aren't very flattering, and DOES make you sound agressive and mean (no offense)...but it doesn't make you look tough. If she's older than you, she'd want a guy who's stronger and better than herself. Explain everything to her...or meet her at another time after you recover.|`|NRAKMXvyaa	Don't talk to her until your eyes feel.  We don't like guys who look like they have a violent side, even if in your case, it wasn't you fault.<br>  <br>  We don't like guys who skip class either! <br>  An attractive guy is one who cares about his future, which means doing well in school, yet having a good sense of style, without making themselves look like gangsters.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

She will most likely think your a really good friend, because you helped a friend in need. It also shows that if she ever needed you to fight off someone or defend her you could. So be your self tell her your story like you did to us. I personally think its good that you helped your friend. It shows that you have a caring side, but yet rugged and us girls like that. Tell her how you really feel that you were worried of what she would think of you because of it. Honesty is the best policy!|`|eiiywbHKaa	Tell her the truth, you didn't provoke the fight, she'll understand.|`|ixg5gQlbaa	tel her what happend ill bet dhell understand. and if she dosent that means she dosent liek you|`|ssIxVXKkaa	NOthing better than the truth, tell her. Look at it this way, if you straighten thing out with her the honest way, then you never have to worry she would ask you again. But explain to her you didn't want to throw the punch, you did it to defend yourself and nothing else. You don't need to prove to her whether you're a tough guy who would get down and dirty or not. Just be honest, and if she understand then you have found a perfect girl for yourself. If not, then well.... I don't want to get there. Just tell the truth. GOOD LUCK|`|tbWDpTbIaa	Quit lying, if you are 5'8" 130 in high school, then you got your azz beat.  Unless you go to a school for "little people."<br>  <br>  Be honest and tell your girl friend someone whooped your azz!|`|wxxMeuN1aa	Well in one way I agree with your first friend, who said that then you'll look like a tough guy. but seeing as you say you're boy-ish looking, maybe that looks like you're trying too hard for her.<br>  <br>  Look, if she really does like you, she'll look past the bruised eye. She might even have sympathy for you and start conversation herself, "Are you ok? What happened?" etc etc. Its really not something to worry about, seriously! If she pities/sympathisizes with you, then tell her the truth. She'll understand. <br>  But if you talk to her first and she asks about the eye, you could make a joke of it - but make it as wild and imaginative as possible, to make it look like you're not trying to flat out lie to her. For example: "I met a mad man on the street and he went right for me".. or "A squirrel attacked me at the park" or... "I was waiting outside an office building for a friend and just as I was looking up, some idiot tossed an old moldly Christmas tree out the window, hitting my face." well, the last one's lame, but you get what I mean.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't lie to her. That would form a weird relationship between the two of you. <br>  <br>  But, if this happens again, you're gonna start to look like you're in with a bad crowd - whatever you do, don't let this happen again.

ylbIoaC1aa	It could be because you have your hands in water a lot.  When I swim a lot, my nail tips also turn clear.|`|s5kNjljMaa	maybe they are very weak and are thin|`|5iSTwjA3aa	The reason your tips are clear is either due to poor nutrition or the products you use on your nails.  You should try to eat more calcium and protein.  If it's not your eating habits then you should look at what you put on your nails.  Having fake nails can potentially harm your nails (that is if they are not put on and taken off correctly).|`|s8bA5TuUaa	Its because your not getting alot of calcium try drinking lots of milk and eating dairy products!Or if there really bothering you just get a french manicure!|`|zaLq1UJqaa	Well if your mom has french tips then they will be white. I think the color of your nails has to do with calcium. Try drinking more milk and orange juice.
5iSTwjA3aa	Well it depends on how short you want to go.  If you want to try a shorthair cut, go with a chin length bob.  They are easy to take care of and look polished all the time.  If you want to go longer, try a haircut with layers (depending on how thick your hair is) either a lot or a little.  I would suggest looking on line (easiest way is to google hairstyles).  Celeb sites are always a good way to become inspired.  Good luck!|`|99bf843208f2b83ec796fd5b1432ecfbaa	Everyone seems to want what they don't have, sadly. If you want your curly hair straight go to Sally's Beauty supply and buy this spray on prehair straightener on your hair before blow drying it. Then use a flattener by clipping sections of your hair starting from the bottom working your way to the top. make sure you take thin strans of your hair and go slowly but becareful not to singe your hair at the ends. Less is best. It'll take a long time but the results will pay in the end. Good luck! Also, don't forget to buy a spray shine oto apply once your done straightening. Don't spray too close it'll look greasy. Try spraying it on your brush first then brush your hair. <br>  Boop|`|F6P36xqEaa	bun|`|bHRiSQk6aa	Try a chunky headband<br>  <a href="http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/ashley-tisdale-pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest-world-premiere-arrivals-Iiv5rW.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/...</a><br>  a side ponytail<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/u/j/nicolepony.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/u/j/nico...</a><br>  long loose curls<br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actress/vanessa-hudgens/pictures/vanessa-hudgens-picture-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...</a><br>  or the ever popular hair poof!<br>  <a href="http://hilary-style.org/gallery/albums/concerts/stillmostwanted-tour/denver%5Bjuly16%5D/normal_004.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hilary-style.org/gallery/albums/c...</a>|`|bzGyJKXRaa	Strait fringe across fore-head<br>  Just past shoulder length<br>  Layered<br>  Poofed up<br>  <br>  =]|`|kDYQlxsLaa	how long is your hair and is it strait or curly send me over a pic I'm a hair designer|`|x4bMk8Paaa	A bun<br>  Ponytail<br>  Pigtails<br>  Thats all I can think of lol

5iSTwjA3aa	Your best bet is to get a suede stain repellent and waterproofing spray.  Also get a suede cleaner just in case anything serious gets on your shoes.  There are a lot of different sprays out there so look online.  Here's a website that shows you exactly how to clean your shoes: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_3139_clean-suede.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_3139_clean-suede...</a><br>  <br>  The bottom website has suede cleaner products.  Good luck!
5iSTwjA3aa	Nair Bikini Cream.  It's about $6.|`|9e54035acbef7a852007575d931d4308aa	try Magic Cream. It's gentler & doesn't cause irritation. It's in the african american men's shaving section (Wal-Mart) I used it while I was pregnant and it worked great! If you are worried about irritation buy the 'mild' version of magic cream & use bikini zone on the areas that you removed hair from.

5iSTwjA3aa	Wash it with a clarifying shampoo and limit the amount of times you use heat products (like a dryer or flatiron).|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Eat a well balanced diet, yes! and wash at least every other day, with professional shampoo, or panteen, brush when dry, comb only when wet.|`|FKzFx3mDaa	Get a shampoo that fits your hair type (I recommend Head and Shoulders) and wash it daily or every other day, depending on how much oil your scalp produces on a daily basis.

I hope that I helped!|`|2zmelIMbaa	Try not to use any heating products such as a straightener as this damages hair. Also, stay away from dying or highlighting it.

Don't use a hairdryer too close to your hair. Avoid using uncovered elastic bands to tie back the hair, and avoid wearing it pulled back too tightly. Brush or comb your hair daily or as often as it needs to be kept knot-free, but don't brush or comb it more than it needs. Have it trimmed every couple of months to avoid the appearance of split ends. Make sure you aren't iron-deficient.|`|6jTDQVacaa	condition it well, cut once every six weeks, take a multi vitamin, and a healthy diet!

I am on meds, but nothing like a blood thinner. I am on a beta blocker and a high blood pressure pill & have gotten tats since and plan on getting atleast one more. Getting a tattoo should not affect your heart issues, unless, of course, you go into a major panic attack....lol....since you have tats already yo know what to expect. Go ahead, go for it. You do need to seek more medical advice about your condition, though. Had I left mine untreated I may not be here now. I was told by a GP that it was palpitations when, in fact, it's more severe...............BUT...go get your tat and enjoy!!!!!|`|l0Dy5Qctaa	i have the same heart palps thing too.

When you do go just inform them of your heart palps.  Through out the tattooing they'll probably keep asking you how you are and if you are feeling any discomfort.  If you feel faint or that your heart starting to beat irregularly, you can ask them to stop for a little bit or ask if you can come back later.  Most artists will be totally fine with that.  The good ones will want you to feel safe.|`|MVJfD5h8aa	come to saint catharines canada <br>  we have the best tatoo places in the world down town <br>  i got my scall tatoo's done at renagades<br>  just check my face book we all<br>  have killer tats here <br>  its part of our simbalisom in saint catharines <br>  to eather stand out from one another our show our true collers <br>  of who's crue we sighned with<br>  idie4u1s@hotmail.com face book (saint catharines)<br>  stephen miles  <br>  grape and wine festavel<br>  wepf 200 and 6 our 7 i cant remember but i know <br>  the world electronic festavel was there<br>  man it was a blood bath <br>  the bicker gangs mobs cops csi fbi mounties everyone <br>  had such a grait time <br>  it crated a rippal for well its stell going on now<br>  it was the first time everone got alond and relaxed and partyed <br>  with no burocracy <br>  we want to have a nother one in saint catharines <br>  in 2012 in a huge farmers felled <br>  like our port dover <br>  but ensted of using the felled for parking <br>  where planing on just bussing everyone in<br>  check out friday the 13th port dover events <br>  and 97.7 hits fm raidio station<br>  o and 1220 just cose your a girl <br>  lmao|`|b5LcMAnuaa	You should be ok ..where are you thinking of having it?|`|nIJGEEyZaa	if u get nervous or feel pain, for sure ur vital signs will change, including ur heart rate. just be careful about the cleanliness of the place
5iSTwjA3aa	I have the same problem.  Try using a heat protectant spray (Suave has a good one for only $2) or even static guard sheets will prevent it.  Hope this helps!|`|AA12367941	The easiest way to rid your hair of static that I have found is simply take a fabric softener sheet for the dryer & pass it over your hair.  I used to keep one in my car & it performed the double duty of making my car smell good too.  Hope this helps.|`|TyD2Hg75aa	Put water on it for cheap fix.  Use spray in conditioner before going out.  The dryer sheets never worked for me.  I tried them used, unused.  Nothing.  Good luck.|`|wN1Ln1niaa	I always get this when I touch my hair and I'm outside, wearing my mittens or gloves. I think it also happens when you wear hoods or hats.|`|z3z1qz7Maa	Take a scent-free dryer sheet and run it over your hair before you go out.
eTHRSHghaa	A geek is a smart person that someone looks down upon because they'd rather spend time playing with their calculators then hanging out at the mall. Its just a stupid label. <br>  But if you really want to look like a Nerd. Try glasses combed back hair and some high rise pants with a tucked in shirt.
7X0uJ7PFaa	The only thing i can think of is to have it stripped at a salon . This can be quite expensive and can damage your hair but it will get rid of all your unnatural hair colour.|`|mqlzkJ54aa	I am doing the same thing actually.  What I did was my stylist dyed my hair once.. it faded.  Then I bought a shampoo called Artec by Loreal.  You can find it at any beauty supply store.  It's a color depositing shampoo that will help blend the two colors.  It's super gentle and not permanent at all.  It doesn't lather so mix it with some shampoo in your hand then lather like your washing your hair.  It comes in tons of colors.. so just look through them and find the one that's right for you.  I asked the lady at the store and she suggested the right one for me.  I got Hazelnut.. it has no red in it and is a pretty neutral brown color.  <br>  <br>  Saves me money and from the damage of dying my hair!|`|qYjvuu3Zaa	Yea there is..go to your local salon and get a tint back to natural..there is no other way to get your natural hair other than lettiing it grow out..and also it was a great idea that you didnt do it at home..those at home kits are damaging for your hair..|`|5iSTwjA3aa	Let your roots grow out a bit and go to your stylist (yeah I know you really don't want to walk around with roots showing but it's really your only way).  They should be able to match your natural color with a dye.|`|MP6yDfo4aa	ive done thiss before and it is really annoying<br>  <br>  you can dye it with the boxes of permanent hair dye you get in shops and pick one which is as close to you natural hair colour as possible<br>  <br>  that way, when the roots start to grown out, it'll not be as noticable!|`|OHui1gfZaa	Permanently colouring your hair is just that: permanent. It's a physical and chemical change that happens to the hair. You really only have two options, and neither of which you seem interested in doing: letting it grow out, or having it professionally coloured back to your natural colour.<br>  <br>  I know how frustrating it is to let the roots grow out and seeing that beautiful demarcation line (I dyed my naturally brown hair black and did some funky blond highlights before getting pregnant, and now I can't colour it again for a long, long, long time) and have to wait it out. Really, it's the best thing to do.|`|nfRthNm5aa	Instead of using harmful chemical-based products in your hair to re dye it, why dont u try using Coconut oil? Just rub some coconut oil onto your palm and apply it down the length of your hair. It will not only help nring out your natureal hair colour, but will also nourish your hair from within and help it grow strong and healthy! If u wanna know more about hair care, u might wanna check this site out- <a href="http://www.healthyhaircareonline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyhaircareonline.com/</a>|`|x0N4jj5aaa	Grow out your roots 1/2 and match them to a permanent color. There are many diffferent browns to choose from and your hairdresser should be able to do this for you very easily.<br>  <br>  You can also buy the semi permanent colors to put in (they last 4-6 weeks and fade gradually) to help you get it closer to your natural color on your own AND lessen that tell tale line between the natural hair and the dyed hair. It is also much gentler on your hair than permanent dye, and you can do this until your natural hair color grows back out.

5iSTwjA3aa	Go to a reputable and clean tattoo shop.  Call around and ask a few local tattoo shops what they charge for it (it could be as low as $30 and as high as $60).  You should leave it in for at least 2 months to ensure that it has fully healed.  To clean it you can either use unscented dial soap and bactine or a salt water solution.  The piercer will give you a sheet on taking care of the piercing when you get it done.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I am considering getting my nose pierced too. I am getting it done on the right side. I'm not sure of the price. I am mostly worried about looking professional at work. I think I am going to get something tiny. Good luck!|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Just so you know, it leaves a little scar on the side of your nose.  It looks like a really big pore.  <br>  <br>  1. On your nostril.<br>  <br>  2.  Depends on where you live.  Shouldn't be more than $40<br>  <br>  3.  Long as you want<br>  <br>  4.  Ask your piercing guy or gal.|`|7iL5qQt9aa	1. Get it done at a professional piercing studio. They know what they are doing so it will make the experience quicker. So call around to local piercing studios in your area and get some information.<br>  <br>  2. The cost varies on the studio, and the type of jewelry you are putting in. Mine cost $45 Canadian and I got a sterling silver nose screw.<br>  <br>  3. It should be left in atleast 6-8 weeks for it to properly heal. This can vary from person to person though. If you play with it a lot or if it gets infected a lot it may take a bit longer to heal.<br>  <br>  4. You should do sea salt soaks often, they will help with the healing process. Go here for more information on the salt soaks: <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Salt_Soak" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Salt_S...</a><br>  Also, use mild unscented soaps. Do NOT use alcohol, neosporin, or peroxide. They will take away from the healing process.|`|nQybFQYaaa	I don't know about where you are but in Phoenix, alot of the tattoo parlors do the piercing.  Cost varies.  You can't take it out for awhile and even then if you leave it out for more than a couple of hrs it can close up.  I took mine out before my shower, went to class, came home and couldn't get it back in and that was after having it for about a year.  Oh yeah, it doesn't really hurt either, but your eyes will water like a faucet|`|qEDyqt4Faa	1. side of nose<br>  2.20-30<br>  3.2-4 weeks<br>  4.by stuff like at peircing stores ( ask the person who gives u the peircing)|`|vFI7wsJeaa	dude get yur septum pierced. in the center of yur nose(klike a bull ring) get it small and cute

I find that it is not enough coverage.  Although it is light, it dries my skin out way too much.  At the same time it is not enough coverage to smooth out my skin.  I am more on the fair to med side and have a few freckles.  Hope this helps!|`|BtDyTcwfaa	It's really nice. Most of it is a powder but when it goes onto your skin it kinda transforms to a liquid. I guess it really depends on your skin type though. I love it and it looks great but if I have a picture made it really makes my face look oily. It is really a personal preference based on skin type.|`|nGJMBMzmaa	I love it! I use Bare Minerals. I find that it isn't as heavy as normal foundation and it has SPF in it. Also, I can add coverage by putting on mosturizer first, letting it dry, then adding the powder. It seems to help it hold longer.
b0404ca8834c0976bd6577755ac27b00aa	Oooh...that's a tough one.<br>  <br>  I've found roses at the grocery store that were such a dark shade of red, they were almost black.  They looked great, but that also meant they weren't that healthy and they didn't last too long.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest purple orchids, but those can by pricey, and they're also rather delicate flowers that can die quickly if they aren't cared for.<br>  <br>  You might be best off with some kind of potted plant arrangement.  It wont die as quickly as cut flowers, and you might be able to get a nice arrangement to suit the occasion.  See if they still have any Halloween pots in the back.|`|D8zEoTF8aa	A decent florist should be able to create the "gothy" arrangement using ordinary flowers.  Ikebana style comes to my mind.  Take a look at the sites below.
2yErgvg7aa	Mommy jeans refers to jeans that have a high rise.  This term became popular as low rise jeans became fashionable.  At this point, some designers have tried to bring back jeans with a higher rise, so who knows if they'll continue to be called "mommy jeans."  Muffin top refers to bulging above the waistband of jeans.|`|dNR1SmfZaa	the first two answerers are correct but they forgot to mention that mom jeans also have tapered legs and are often too short.  they make ones butt look abnormally large and are not flattering in ANY WAY.  just type in 'mom jeans' in Google images.|`|5iSTwjA3aa	Mom jeans are tapered leg jeans that go completely above your belly button (I've even seen them with pleats!!!!!).

AA10849332	clean it with a q tip and some unscented antibacterial soap (like dial)<br>  <br>  DO NOT use listerine to clean your piercing!!! Listerine has an alcohol base to it that will irritate your piercing. There are PLENTY of non alcohol mouthwashes available.<br>  <br>  antibiotic ointments are also a bad idea, they are too harsh, and most of them are cream based. this will cut off oxygen to your piercing and can cause bacteria to get trapped inside|`|TgU9P6pdaa	no you arent supposed to use listerine, it dries out your piercings. use a gel hand soap. like dial.  tahts what i used for all my piercings.|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	i never saw a dried white blood cell. how about antibiotic ointment ( will make your lips shiny too..as an added bonus|`|5iSTwjA3aa	Clean it with unscented dial soap (it'll help keep the build up off) and rinse with Listerine (and yes you should, any good piercer will tell you this!).|`|Cv5SzMqoaa	try listerine it wirked for my lip
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Many piercers will use a retainer as initial jewelry unless the client asks for something else. Just keep it flipped up during the initial healing process, moving it around can prolong the healing process. As for it accidentally coming down, it's possible, but they generally stay in place (at least when the piercing is fairly new, after a while it may loosen up and not stay flipped up)|`|yp8NtB0faa	Well i don't think there is going to be anyway to hide a piercing that is through your nose.  But go for it anyway.  I think it's cute.  I want to get the marilyn monroe!
kLJr3tCWaa	I have heard that bareminerals is different for everyone. For some people it cause them to brake out and some don't.  I use everyday minerals and its a little cheaper and its all natural. You should try it.     (you can try a free sample kit on the website. it brings a great amount for somethings thats free)|`|fMvP3BIFaa	Its expensive, but well worth it. Ive been using it for 2 years and I will never go back to anything else. It leaves your face feeling so soft you dont even feel the thick layer.|`|xayYdIfHaa	I think that it's pretty good. I haven't noticed a huge difference in the other products I buy - except maybe the Minerals stuff doesn't feel as heavy on your skin.|`|d7RxeNJbaa	hi you can try this one:  beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|7gXDM7qPaa	I like Bare Minerals, but its a little overpriced. I occasionally use a makeup by L'Oreal called Bare Naturale and it is basically the same thing. It comes in a lot more shades that Bare Minerals also, plus you can buy it at Wal-Mart or CVS or wherever. Its a little heavier on your face, making you look a bit more "made-up" but it has a very smooth look to it that I like a lot.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I didn't like it.  There must be salt minerals in it because it dried out my skin, made it irritated and itchy.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	wear moisturizer underneath and it will look beautious. nothing can match up to it , i think you should buy. its worth it.|`|N5qx5NUvaa	I used it for about a year and it was okay. It gives minimum coverage and was dry, so it would flake off. I got the get started kit and it came with the kabuki brush. That was especially awful. At the time I thought it was great, but I switched to the MAC 187 brush. Then realized the bare minerals was practically scratching my face.     I would maybe recommend only to someone who is beginning in make up and needs light coverage(barely any spots/blemishes).
Y0p1LDTDaa	i take udos Ultimate Oil Blend about a table spoon every morning (they recommend 3 times a day) , it really makes my hair and nails grow so much faster. It tastes horrible but works (i find a small glass of milk after wards really makes the taste go away fastest)  it is a blend of Organic flax seed oil, Organic sunflower seed oil, Organic sesame seed oil, Rice and oat germ oils, Organic coconut oil, Organic evening primrose oil, Lecithin, Vitamin E, Antioxidants (tocotrienols), Rosemary oil.  took me about 2-3 weeks to really notice a difference (i get acrylic nails and since taking it i have to get my nails filled twice as often and my hair grows much faster as well. it also does great things for your skin)|`|m9UNLTH6aa	Believe it or not prenatal vitamins work!  That's why pregnant womens hair usually grow faster.
GLEGh4N0aa	wash it with lemon juice a few times it strips some of the dye. And dye over it with whatever colour you want. I woulndt try blonde tho it'll go ginger or green!|`|cBMwHdn4aa	OOH!  I did the same thing a couple of years ago.  I tried to fix it myself...got that blue-bleach and it turned macaroni & cheese orange.  I had no choice but to do it again, it was back to blonde, alright...my hair felt like straw and may have been flammable!    If you have the cash, just get corrective coloring at a salon.  It is pretty expensive, though.  If you don't--which I didn't--don't rush the lightening process.  Bleach it according to the instructions but leave it-whatever color it may turn out-until you've had time to repair some of the hair-trauma you've undergone with some intensive conditioners and stuff.    Good Luck!!|`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	um, maybe you should stop dying your hair cause it will make u have discusting hair when u r older i would know my grandma has it ewww and u DONT WANT IT!!!|`|m9UNLTH6aa	Well, depending on when you died it you can usually fade it out a bit if you wash it with dish soap.  It will strip out some of the color.  Also, maybe try a toner to lighten it up.  Last option would be go to a hair dresser and have them put another color into it like brown or red.|`|qH7BJjTsaa	the dye will make your hair bad i think you should stop that|`|skJihSWSaa	i did the same thing. It's hard to go from a dark colour to a light colour. you'll have to do it gradually but all that dye will damage your hair. I would advise going to the hairdressers where they won't dye it with a colour as such but with a base. They did that for me and it was actually a really nice colour. You can then dye it back blonde. It may never go back to the colour it used to be, mine hasn't.|`|TLmQrRSoaa	you should try revlon its not blond but it will make it look kinda mixed try strawberry blond or bright auburn or Lorelle preference if you can handle the scent of ammonia

5gin3E4aaa	As has been said, hair implants are always an option, though that can seem a bit too drastic. I believe that your best choice right now is to use an eyebrow pencil to make your brow seem more prominent. You should practice using one at home until you are comfortable with it and feel ready to go out in public.    Eyebrow tattoos are also available. This, too, may seem drastic, but it really can work. If you want more informantion on this choice, you can go to http://www.beauty-cosmetic-guide.com/eye...  for alot more information, such as ways to speed up the hair growth and information on fake and tattooed eyebrows.    Hope I helped!|`|zhk8o514aa	Well you can always get hair implants.|`|buUTakKAaa	consider hair implants?|`|EZwwkst5aa	the only thing you really can do is just color them in with eyebrow pencils. i'm not sure there is much else to do that wouldn't be drastic.|`|4f3cauAmaa	Have you considered  eyebrow tattoo
pve5w0zGaa	after shaving with an electric shaver, use some kind of alcohol based after-shave lotion on your face|`|k1C70y8raa	the electric razor is irritating your skin, causing them to form. either try the gel lubricant for electric razors or try using a conventional razor.|`|YQQoHI5Haa	My husband gets the same thing! Like little tiny whiteheads around the beard area. Your electric razor isn't irritating your skin, it's just a normal reaction. Your pores open up while you shave because of hot water. Sometime within those 8 hours after you shave, bacteria gets on your skin and causes those small whiteheads. I bought him cetaphil (it's a really gentle face wash) So, if he does shave, instead of shaving cream, he shaves with the face wash, and then after he shaves he washes his face with the face wash and cold water (cold water closes your pores). It should help a lot! :)    http://www.cetaphil.com/Products/Default...|`|VXXMsvkiaa	I'd try washing your face after you shave.  I've got the same problem sometimes after I shave.  You probably going to want to shave regularly, too. Because if you don't, them zits are gonna hide under there and just wait to pop out until you shave.  So yeah, just keep your face clean.|`|Octzpyyhaa	Dont wash your face before you shave and after you shave, use rubbing alcohol (its going to burn!....but in time you will get use to it) where you shaved.    I do this and it works well.|`|DIuE4vshaa	They are probably ingrown hairs. The best way to prevent it is to use a straight razor and shave WITH the way the hair is growing.

VBMOuIuxaa	BareMinerals, i swear by it. nothing else touches my face. always had trouble with my acne, til i found bareminerals, it has helped stop my breakouts and i can sleep in it too and it doesn't affect my acne. look at it online. it's great!!!|`|kLJr3tCWaa	The best mineral makeup in my opinion is Everyday Minerals. Its good for your skin and looks great.  You can actually try a free sample kit EverydayMinerals.com. The kit comes with 3 foundations, a blush, and a concealer (you choose the colors you want)..... and the samples are not as small as you think. You can also keep ordering until you find the rite color that best suites u. You should definitely try it!|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I have tried LITERALLY every drug store mineral foundation and powder except Jane. If you're on a tight budget, Wet N Wild Ultimate Minerals is $4.99 at Rite Aid and is my favorite. Physician's Formula and L'Oreal Bare Naturale both make really good ones, too. They're a bit more expensive, but the container will last a good two or three months, so it's usually worth the price. They all have a really wide range of colors, as well as providing wonderful coverage and none of them have caused any breakouts (for me at least).|`|fjQP9dcnaa	Maybeline|`|HXZhINbeaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.
9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	The cleansers you are using may be causing your skin to go into over drive of natural oil production.  After you clean your skin apply a face moisturizer to replenish it.  This should slow it down to normal.|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	get a good dryingoutyourskin facial
5gin3E4aaa	There are actually many beauty academies to go to. There may be some local, depending on where you live, and there are also hundreds of choices available all over the world. Here are some suggestions:    http://www.cosmixinc.com/  Cosmixinc comes off as a little girly, but it really is a good school. I suggest going here if you are looking for a fun time, while learning your trade.    http://www.marlenekurland.com/makeup_sem...  A good class for something short-term, if you want to make sure you are sure about becoming a makeup artist.    http://www.ei.edu/  A VERY good school. Amazing work. My top choice.    There are also some courses that can be taken online... but AVOID THESE. To be a good makeup artist, you need a LOT of practice. You can't get this online.    Until you are at the age to enroll in these schools, make sure you set up a portfiolio of your work, using before and after tpictures. This can really come in handy.    Hope I helped, and I wish you the best in your future career!|`|MWEn7fcwaa	I work in theatre, and my sister is training to be a makeup artist, so this is how she did it...  She started by doing A levels in Fine Art, and Textiles I think, along with English and Geography to give her a balance between the artistic and practical. She then did a foundation degree in Fashion, before taking a course in theatrical and media makeup. It's a really specialised course and not many places offer it, but do a bit of research and see what's in your area. She's now applying to London College of Fashion to do a degree.  If I was you I'd get as much practical experience as you can; volunteer at local amateur dramatics companies and school productions to help there, also local dance schools, drama clubs, anywhere where people are on stage. This kind of experience will help you in the future when applying for courses!  Hope that helps, and best of luck Jx

Are you very muscular?|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	Just a bit but dont worry big is beautiful|`|9YN2PFxGaa	if you calculate your bmi using your height and weight it will tell you what your are.    at 5 foot 1 and a weight of 144 pound your bmi is 27.2    the BMI Categories are:      Underweight =    Normal weight = 18.5-24.9   Overweight = 25-29.9   Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater    this shows that yes you are overweight.    to lose weight try eating more fruit and veg, snacking less and increasing your amount of excercise.|`|mgTZD9Teaa	According to your bmi (body mass index) you are slightly overweight, so I would lose some weight maybe about 10-15 which would bring your bmi into the healthy category.      If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).    Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheat's, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|rYhm4LN1aa	Your a fuc*en whale!|`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	yes baby you sure are like over weight mannn you are FAT woahh gosh dude gosh omg you need to lose 30 pounts or you will die in 7 days!|`|AA12167361	Just eat more fruits and veggies and whole gains and find a fun aerobic exorcise to get the heart going. It doesn't seem like you have too far to go to be at a healthier weight but because you have a small frame, you have to be careful how much you carry. Focus on the health aspect of the matter and set reasonable goals. This will make you look good and feel great!  :)|`|0pwkrzIcaa	no i dont think you are maybe just a lill bit but not to much|`|rH9Ue89Taa	google seach body mass index.   type it in, and get to a weight you are comfortable at, bc right now you dont seem  to secure.|`|8lDmtlOcaa	yes you are overweight. your bmi is 27.2 and normal is 18.5 - 24.9 . however, the good news is that you only have to lose 12 pounds. being 132 is going to make you exactly 24.9. of course, gettinga  little below that is probably good, so you don't just become overweight again. i already calculated your bmi and gave it to you, but here's where you can check for yourself:     http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/     as for how to lose it, i think you know the answer to that already. throw out all the junk food and stock your pantry and refrigerator with HEALTHY snacks. you're much less likely to go out and buy something unhealthy if you don't have it at home. drink a glass of water before a meal, and watch your portions. if you live in the united states, we here have a very skewed vision of healthy portions. we eat like double of what the portion is, sometimes! avoid fast food...you know all this. also, set aside time to excercise...maybe a half an hour a day, if you can't do more than that. don't say to yourself you don't have time, or you're too tired, that won't help. feeling sorry for yourself is only going to slow down or stop the process of you getting the body you want. good luck!|`|jjo5siKBaa	that all depends on your age as well as your height  the best way to know if you're over weight and how much weight you need to loose is ASK YOUR DOCTOR!!! he/she would know if  you are medically overweight|`|hgdixjzRaa	depends how old you are too! try to just eat healthy and exercise if you have too!

UYnZtJ2daa	There's not really any way any of us can give you ideas - we didn't know your grandfather. My memorial tattoo has a koi fish, flowers, water, and my great grandmother's art signature because she had a koi pond, hundreds of plants and flowers around her place, and grew up near the water. It is all things that make me think of her. What reminds you of your grandpa that you could incorporate in a tattoo? Just give it awhile and put some thought into it.    The lung cancer ribbon is white.|`|YQQoHI5Haa	My grandpa was in the Navy too, I always thought I would get an anchor maybe with his initials small next to it. Or if your grandpa had a funny saying or something he always said that makes you think of him, you could get a little quote underneath it.     Just some ideas;     http://fc53.deviantart.com/fs26/f/2008/0...    http://www.extreme-temporary-tattoos.com...      Of course you can make it your own with color/style/size.   I think it would look really cute on an ankle or maybe on a wrist. It shouldn't be on your back because it should be somewhere you can always see it :)     Hope this helps!|`|paerqxfMaa	You have to kind of figure out your own tattoo - it supposed to have significance for you.  My late father was in the Navy also (as imy son currently is) - so I have the Navy anchor tattooed on my back and instead of the rope that normally runs through it, I have a long stem rose (in memory of my mother).  This way I cover all the bases - my father, my mother and my son.|`|SkJtrPMTaa	If he was in the navy I think an anchor would be cute. Anything Sailor Jerry would be really good as well. Search Sailor Jerry Tattoo on Flickr and look through those.|`|6kxWMPEQaa	My grandfather recently past and he was in the army so I replicated his dog tags.  The chain wraps around my ankle and the tags land on the top of my foot. the two tags kind of overlap, so the top tag you see the whole thing and it has his full name and then his birth date under his name, then the second tag you just see the bottom and I put the date he past on that one.|`|PBpcF8KYaa	You can probably find one, I think all the different cancers have different color ribbons.

c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	The very latest idea of "smart fabric" is material which contains  some kind of computing facility, like silicon threads, or some advanced quality which can change colour, become waterproof when it rains, or can alert emergency services if you fall over inthe street  All these are a bit fanciful at the moment, but keep reading "New Scientist" and you'll see this kind of thing cropping up from time to time.|`|rroE37HTaa	It is a fabric designed to regulate heating and cooling, some high end clothing lines are using it for lining on mens sports coats!   Instead of relying on active controls common to most automotive seating thermal management systems today, the technology uses phase-change material (PCM), called Thermocules ?, to balance temperature.  The PCM Thermocules ? within the seat absorb and store excess heat when it is created, and releases it back to the occupant when it is needed most.  This cooling and warming cycle helps keep the occupant from being too hot or too cold.  By buffering temperature and humidity fluctuations, the technology automatically helps the occupant adapt to the environment and stay more comfortable.|`|og2jpEDAaa	fabric that comes from ur ***!

You do not have to remove the jewelry to clean it, that will only make things worse (as you have learned)    Leave it alone. Do mild sea salt soaks twice a day and don't move the jewelry at all.

I have tried it every way possible and I like brown with my blonde, it just looks healthier!|`|0cexaYDeaa	Depends on how blonde you're going to be and how dark your eyebrows are. It's really about what you're more comfortable with.    I'd say, dye your hair first and then look at what you want. Ask people's opinions. If you're having your hair dyed in a salon, ask what they think.    It also depends on whether your eyebrows are plugged or not, if you have big eyebrows, it could look weird with the blonde hair, if you have trimmed and shaped eyebrows it wouldn't look as weird.    If you decide to have your eyebrows dyed, make sure you dye them in a salon, not at home! Do not use the same colour as your newly dyed hair, or even lighter. Make sure they're always a tad darker.    Sometimes, having dark eyebrows and light hair, can be sort of a characterization and it can look really nice (look at pictures of Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road)|`|odmEKWJuaa	most people just leave their eyebrows brown but u can get it dyed at a salon.

87yovKYlaa	its infected. my sister in law is a piercer and says do not use soap and water as it over dries the skin and will irritate it. pack it with sea salt a few times a day until the swelling goes down. turn it a couple of times a day making sure your hands are clean before hand. mix sea salt and water in a spray bottle and spray it when it feels hot or itchy and do not pick the crusties off. ditch the h2ocean stuff, its a waste of money. never peroxide a deep wound such as a piercing or use alcohol, it will make it worse and peroxide can cause the skin to pucker around the piercing which can not be reversed. sea salt, and only sea salt. if you need to clean the crusties off, use plain water and a soft wash cloth gently.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	It is definitely infected.  Clean it with Hydrogen peroxide and then apply skin ointment on it at least 3 to 4 times a day.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	You're over cleaning it, big time.     You only need to do proper sea salt soaks 2-3 times per day, no more. Mix up your own solution, forget the H2Ocean. It's expensive and not the best thing for piercings.    For detailed instructions:  http://www.articlefit.com/Piercing-After...|`|jWBikTSjaa	Go to the doctors.|`|rYhm4LN1aa	If u clean it that much id say you over cleaning. only clean it 2-3 times a day. dont touch it and play with it, just leave it alone.    belly button piercings can take up to a year to fully heal. they are a pain in the a*s|`|DxvW1aiBaa	well from what it sounds like it COULD be infected, but im not sure about it. to help mine heal faster i cleaned it and then used a cotton ball soaked in salt water to wipe around the piercing. maybe you could try that and see it it helps. If not, i would go to the tattoo/ piercing parlor and see what they say.|`|AA11657825	I realize you have every right to pierce your navel or anything else, but Why? I just don't see it.
LX41AjMHaa	They have hair stylists who accompany them whereever they go.|`|WOqCWAp2aa	they always go to salons|`|RZ4l6s65aa	Hair Stylists|`|m9UNLTH6aa	They have hair stylists and of course most of the time they either have a wig on or hair extensions in.|`|BDKVWLS3aa	I wanted "celebrity" hair for a while lol. Then i accepted the fact the celebrities usually have a team of people making sure they are "perfect", and purchase products from places you probably didnt know existed. So start your own hair regimen by washing it around the same time each week and keeping it moisturized, you'll noticed the change and see that it becomes more manageable.
r4i7xPnMaa	Alcohol is your best bet. It dries quickly, is quite sanitary, and won't compromise your piggies.    A couple of places sell "pressing mediums" but they're mostly alcohol.
5iSTwjA3aa	It will most likely take about an hour (well that is depending on how long the hair is, whether or not she will have to wait for the stylist to start and the coloring that she is getting done).  Have you asked her how long it normally takes?  That would be a better estimate than what you will get on here.|`|O31cU99zaa	id say go there in a hour and see because she might be done then if there not finished ask for a time of when they will be <br>  <br>  =] =]|`|xxTdSOK5aa	it takes me about 2 hours
5iSTwjA3aa	They will still do it, in fact they might even be able to suggest a few ways to get rid of it.|`|vuBaDJ4paa	Try freezing it? That's all I can think of. Oh, I think they have those creams for veruccas? Good luck|`|5ZAzFW4eaa	go for it! u wont no til u go!|`|5zp256oSaa	you sure do have a lot off problems|`|CGkKV9Djaa	You need to go to the doctor to get it frozen off.|`|S3oYbZYraa	of course they will!!! but you could try freezing it but it bloody hurts!!!|`|bjuSB8k6aa	im sure they will do it, freezing is the quikest and fastest way to get rid of it.
