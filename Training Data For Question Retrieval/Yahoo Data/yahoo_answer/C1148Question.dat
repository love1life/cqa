I know, I know she pays for food, etc but I need money too. =( 3 times a year isn't that much. Now her friend returned the $150 and now my mom says she going to borrow it (when I say borrow it means actually take it away and not owe me back) what should I do?!?! Should I hide the money?!?!

They're not old marks, and I am using cocoa butter to try and prevent them from getting any worse.  I have very light ones on my stomach that popped up a couple weeks ago and the cocoa butter seems to be helping those.  But the others aren't changing.  I'm losing weight and I'd like to at least lighten those marks if possible so I won't be banned from the beach!

When I wake up in the morning, it is usually flipped out on the ends and looks bad. I straighten it almost every day, but I don't really like how that looks much, either, and it makes the split pieces that are there stand out more. I have some layers that I got a few months ago, but they're not looking so great anymore and just make it harder to straighten my hair. I would love to have curly hair, but I don't want to get a perm because of the damage. My hair is pretty shiny, but it's naturally not straight, and not curly. What do you think I should do with my hair?      Thanks.

20090306172811AAHCfdn	Beauty & Style;Hair	Does anyone know about hair removal? I got a friend who needs it before prom, any ides?	My friend like to call herself the "hairy Italian". Now she doesn't go around telling everyone that, but here is the issue. She has hair on her arms and legs, and regular shaving doesn't work. Most people can just shave and you don't see it, but she is so pale, and her hair is so dark and course, even when she shaves, you can see the black hair like under her skin. It isn't like she is see through and I guess someone might not understand the problem because when you shave it should come off, but you can still see like the hair it is like little black spots where the hair used to be and her hair is so thick you can really notice it. Is there another solution other than the lasers and the nair because the nair does the same thing. Is going to the shop to get a wax the only way?

When she did it she jumped and one of the earring was slightly off.  That wasn't a problem until one of the dogs at her mama's house caught her earring with is nail and ripped it a little.  After that the earring looked really crooked so we took them out and let them grow over.  It's been about a year and her holes have grown over but they are still a little indented (like a scar I guess).  So can we get them repierced and will they be able to make it straight this time (as long as she doesn't move)??

There is a "vintage" bracelet my aunt got from her grandfather (now deceased) when she was my age, and she gave it to me for my birthday. I know it's the thought that counts, and I shouldn't be scrutinizing a gift, but my aunt lies to everyone in the family about lots of stupid things. If this was something my late great-grandfather bought when he was alive, I'd like to know if that's true, but I suspect she bought it at a pawn shop. No one else in the family remembers her getting this bracelet, but they admit they probably wouldn't have remembered anyway.      I've already checked their website. I can't even find this bracelet on the web... all the products shown are recent.

20090306212607AAunHef	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I got my lip pierced a month ago....?	and I changed it from studs to a corkscrew.   Mind you I have viper bites, so I have two holes.  So, my one piercing is fine and dandy, the other feels like the ring is too tight.  I changed it a couple of nights ago and it seemed fine  (then again I wasn't paying much attention, as I was moving).  It's not swollen, no infection, no nothing.  It just hurts slightly.  Is it because I went from a stud to a ring?  Or is it something else?      Please don't say take it out, or that you personally don't like piercings.  I'm not asking for your opinion on my piercing, just why you think it might be hurting.  So don't waste either of our times, to each their own.      Thank you!

I want to know where I could buy yukata's of plain solid color or such a design where the yukata looks as if it were giving off a solid color.   Like this:  http://www.shop-japan.co.jp/english-boku...    (The site is a japanese website and I'm not sure if I could handle that. Plus this design is under Large so it wouldn't fit me.)   I need a light pink one for I am trying to create my first cosplay.      If someone could just suggest some sites, that would be great. I have already checked some sites other people had given people with my same question. Apparently dying a white one is out of the question since white is usually associated with marriage or death. And it's almost impossible to find one unless you are under those circumstances.    (Even though in anime's you see people wearing white under yukata and white bath ones.)      Thank you. =)
