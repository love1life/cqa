If you're investing, not "trading" (which is more of a short term, active business idea), you're looking at long term results, to grow your wealth to take care of future needs (such as home buying, retirement and leaving assets for your family when you die).    First, getting a "good return": You should not expect to do better than "the market" overall.  Some people will do better, some will do worse, and many people who try to pick individual stocks, for example, take more risk than is justified by what they earn on the investments.  You can get a good return by holding a mix of mutual funds that are operated with low costs and no fees. These funds buy a broad mix of stocks (and some buy bonds or other assets as well), and over a long period of time, almost no one (including professional money managers) will do better than you will, if you buy and hold a few low-cost, well-diversified funds. By using mutual funds, you have the important benefit of "diversification", that minimizes your risk. Check out Vanguard, a low cost family of mutual funds, at www.vanguard.com    Second, tax minimization:  You can put money, each year (currently up to $4,000 annually) into an IRA account, and if you choose what's called a Roth IRA, the investments you make can grow tax-free and (unless you take money out too early) you get to take out all the money eventually without any tax on it.  Keep in mind that an IRA is just a type of account that you can open with a broker or a mutual fund, making the same investments (e.g., mutual funds) that you would make in a regular investment account.    Since you might want to invest more than $4,000 in one year, another idea is the use of variable annuities. These are contracts with insurance companies, and allow you to buy a mix of mutual funds, allow them to grow in value with no current tax obligation, and sometime in the future (usually retirement), you "annuitize" the contract -- that is, you exchange the investment value for a lifetime payment of income from the insurance company, based on the value of your account when you annuitize. So, buying a variable annuity is similar in concept to buying yourself a pension that will, when you choose, pay you retirement income for life. One of the reasons these can be a good investment is that, for a cost around 0.5% per year, you can also have an insurance company guarantee that your investments will not go down in value -- they can go up, with the mutual funds, but not go down. That is a pretty cheap cost for "portfolio insurance".  Eventually, when you start taking the income, you do pay income tax on the gains, but it is spread out as you receive the income.    Third, best method: As my previous paragraphs described, I think using mutual funds as the investment method, and either an IRA or a variable annuity as the account type or "holding method" give you the "best method" to grow your investments and minimize the tax burden on your income.    I hope this helps!

AA10529435	As the person above me stated, it is required to attend credit education classed, but there is a lot more to the new law as well!    But the new laws also eliminated the "wipe your slate clean" option - it's all a re-payment plan (Chapter 13) where they garnish a certain amount out of your paycheck, and pay all of the creditors that respond to the bankruptcy notice at a certain percentage. Usually it lasts up to 5 years, depending on the amount of debt you have. You also have to get approval from the courts to obtain any credit or sell any assets you have. It's very restrictive, and takes a lot more work on the person who is filing's end.     The whole idea was to try and get people to be more responsible - have to go through classes and actually repay some debt - instead of just filing and forgetting about it.|`|YJhawzrpaa	From my understanding the only difference is that you have to take a financial education class..costs about $50 bucks and you can do it online....  It's still pretty much the same to file...I haven't filed but did talk to a lawyer bout 2 weeks ago....  Good Luck!    Also, was told that your credit will be wiped clean other than the bankruptcy showing... and in about 2 years you could build your credit back up enough to buy a house...

I would think twice before doing.  It stays on your credit profile for at least 7 years.|`|w9W6Ojmdaa	Will I Have to Go to Court?  August 1st, 2007    In most bankruptcy cases, you only have to go to a proceeding called the meeting of creditors or a 341 meeting to meet with the bankruptcy trustee and any creditor who chooses to come. This meeting will take place about 30 or 40 days after the bankruptcy filing. The trustee is not a judge but an individual appointed by the United States Trustee to oversee your case. Most of the time, this meeting will be a short and simple procedure where you are asked a few questions about your bankruptcy forms and your financial situation. Occasionally, if a creditor or the trustee files a motion or an adversary action or if you choose to dispute a debt, you may have to appear before a judge at a hearing. If you need to go to court, you will receive notice of the court date and time from the court and/or from your attorney.    What Debt will Bankruptcy Not Erase?  August 1st, 2007    * money owed for child support or alimony, fines, and some taxes;  * debts not listed on your bankruptcy petition;  * loans you got by knowingly giving false information to a creditor, who reasonably relied on it in making you the loan;  * debts resulting from willful and malicious harm;  * student loans owed to a school or government body, except if: the court decides that payment would be an undue hardship;  * mortgages and other liens which are not paid in the bankruptcy case (but bankruptcy will wipe out your obligation to pay any additional money if the property is sold by the creditor).    Can I Keep My Home/Car?  August 1st, 2007    You will not lose your home or car during your bankruptcy case as long as your equity in the property is fully exempt. Even if your property is not fully exempt you may still be able to keep your property by filing a chapter 13 bankruptcy instead of a chapter 7 bankruptcy. In a chapter 13 plan you will be required to pay at least the equivalent of the non-exempt equity you have in your home or car and any amount you are behind on your home or car loan over the course of the three to five plan. You also will be required to continue making the regular monthly payments.    What Property Can I Keep After Bankruptcy  August 1st, 2007    In a chapter 7 case, you can keep all the property which is exempt from the claims of creditors. In determining whether property is exempt, you must keep a few things in mind. The value of property is not the amount you paid for it, but what it is worth now. Generally the trustee is interested in the resale value of your property so for most personal effects this is the garage sale value of your property.    You also only need to look at your equity in property. This means that you count your exemptions against the full value minus any money that you owe on mortgages or liens. For example, if you own a $50,000 house with a $40,000 mortgage, you count your exemptions against the $10,000 equity you have in the home. While your exemptions allow you to keep property even in a chapter 7 case, your exemptions do not make any difference to the right of a mortgage holder or car loan creditor to take the property to cover the debt if you are behind. If you are behind in payments and can afford to make the loan payment and to make the amount you are behind over a period of three to five years you should consider a chapter 13 bankruptcy.    In a chapter 13 case, you can keep all of your property if your plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy law. In most cases you will have to pay the mortgages or liens as you would if you didnt file bankruptcy.    What Does it Cost to File Bankruptcy?  August 1st, 2007    An estimate of what it may cost to file. These fees vary based on law office:    Chapter 7 - $200 ($170 filing fee + $30 noticing fee)    Chapter 13 - $185 - ($155 filing fee + $30 noticing fee)    The fee is the same when filing a joint petition with a spouse.    How Often Can I File?  August 1st, 2007    You can file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy again after six years has passed from the date of your last filing. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be filed at any time.    Why Do People File a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy  August 1st, 2007    Generally, people file chapter 13 if they have valuable property not covered by an exemption, like a home or car, but want to keep this property. If a debtor is behind on secured loan payments a chapter 13 bankruptcy can allow the debtor to make up these payments over time while keeping the home or car.    Why Do People File a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy  August 1st, 2007    Generally people file chapter 7 bankruptcy if they have a large amount of unsecured debt such as credit card debt or medical expenses that they are no longer able to pay. Often unemployment, unexpected medical expenses, or divorce prompt the cause the debtor to seek protection from creditors by filing chapter 7 bankruptcy.

xVEOuPikaa	There are several differences between a C and S corporation.    The largest difference is the taxation of capital gains.  A capital gain, no matter if it is short or long term, in a C Corporation is taxed as ordinary income.  This makes it less favorable to hold appreciating assets in a C Corp.  A long term capital gain in an S Corp passes through to the shareholders and retains its character as a long term capital gain; meaning it will qualify for lower capital gains rates as opposed to being taxed as ordinary income.    Another difference is the taxation of fringe benefits in a C versus an S.  Most fringe benefits, health care plans and other perks offered by companies are taxed as wages to the shareholder/employee.  In a C Corp, many of these fringe benefits are deducted by the Corp and non-taxable to the employee.    A huge difference between an S and C is the number and type of shareholders allowed in each Corporation.  An S Corporation is limited to only 100 shareholders; husband and wife is treated as one shareholder, and certain types of entities cannot be shareholders of an S Corporation.  Just about any entity or individual can be a shareholder in a C Corp and there is no limit as to the number of shareholders.    There are differences in how dividends and how accumulated earnings are taxed.  The retained earnings are figured differently.  There are many differences.  Unfortunately, there are not many free resources to explain the differences.  If you are planning to incorporate, at least see a lawyer and definitely see an accountant.    Hope that helps.
xVEOuPikaa	Sounds simple doesn't it.  If I were you, I would invest $60 in a book called "The Corporate Minutes Book", published by NOLO books.  This book has many great ideas on how to run your corporation correctly and how to bulletproof your corporate veil.  There are numerous things to watch out for; mainly keeping and maintaining separate books and records, funding your corporation correctly, no co-mingling of personal and business funds, filing the correct resolutions to go along with the minutes, possibly filing amendments to your corporate bylaws or articles of incorporation, operating under an assumed name and filing the correct documents that are involved in that decision.  The list can be as short or as long as your imagination; it depends on the complexity of your business.  If you are running a one man corporation, please invest the money in the book I mentioned or see a professional; either a lawyer or accountant.  I always tell people to see both if they are financially able to do so.    As far as the tax forms go, you will definitely file a 1120 for the corporation.  If you plan to pay yourself or employees wages, you will file quarterly 941s and a yearly 940 reported wages paid.  If you plan to pay wages, you should contact your state's workers department to find out about state unemployment tax liability.    If you are going at this alone, I don't suggest it, but good luck to you.  There are numerous and highly complex issues, tax and legal, to watch out for.

They can become members of your 'advisory board' together with other talented friends or counterparts that you may have.

You can also get free advice and counsel on their blog or bulletin board  Good luck|`|AA10464818	SBA is government, and government means bureaucracy - which means more paperwork. If you think SBA guaranteed loan is easier to get because it is from the government, think again. And yes -- they want to see that you have money and they want you to put equity investment, meaning your own money (about 20% or even more) into the business    I suggest you go to the SBA financing page to learn more about their requirements http://www.sba.gov/financing    Remember, SBA merely guarantees the loan; a financial institution such as a bank that works with SBA will give the loan to you. SBA considers several factors when applying for a business loan:    - A business plan explaining what the business is    - Your background and experience in the business -- in my experience, this is KEY in the eyes of the bank because they want to make sure that you know what you are doing and that you can make the business work. If you don't have any experience with the business, have someone on board that knows the business to give banks assurance that someone will guide you    - Your credit factors because it shows your dependability and how well you handle credit. They will do a credit check on you and poor credit history may be frowned upon, or even reason for the disapproval of your loan application    - Your collateral. Banks, even SBA guaranteed loans, want the borrower to show collateral. They want to be guaranteed that somewhere somehow they can get payment from you    - Condition or terms of loans. Banks would want to know three important things: "How much money are you requesting? What will it be used for? and For how long will it be needed?" Banks oftentimes prefer to approve loans for items that can be identified, has lasting value, and can be repossessed and sold if things fail.    If you will need less than $30K I suggest you consider microloan providers.

Good Luck in whatever you decide to do! |`|OqnnJcJMaa	well you need to be good at talking to people and manipulating.....you have to show people that if you buy this product or enter this venture it will better your life....but you also have to sound confidant and talk to them like they are your friend....you can not be shy at a sales job.....when you talk you have to smile....do not sound dull or boring...if you do then the person will get bored of you....most of the time when a person buys something from a sales person its because they liked that person.....i highly recommend that you read 'How to win friends and influence people' by Dale Carnegie

JLxzbvRmaa	supongo te refieres a lo que es suplantar a una persona, con autorizacion de la misma para algun acto que tenga efectos legales para ti, ..? si eres de argentina, bueno, subrogar seria sinonimo de suplantar, seria interesante saber exactamente la etimologia de la palabra SUBROGAR.  Judicialmente, en argentina, un funcionario que esta ausente o no puede intervenir en una causa, o tramite o juicio, para que nos entendamos, es "subrogado" por aquel otro funcionario que las acordadas y leyes llaman a intervenir. o sea, que lo suplante en su ausencia o por el impedimento que fuere.    En cuanto a hacer un poder, no es que das a otro la facultad de subrogarte, sino de actuar en tu nombre , y sera quien firme por ti los pedidos o escritos que deban presentarse en el juicio donde eres parte. Pero hay dos clasificaciones de poderes: UNO ES ESPECIAL y el otro es PODER GENERAL.  ESPECIAL: es ese poder o facultad que das por escritura publica a un abogado o alguna persona , para suplantarte en determinado juicio, causa o situacion,Es decir, que en el poder especial mencionas que don Juan Perez ,sera tu representante en la compraventa de un inmueble por ejemplo, o en un juicio donde eres parte y debes pedir o comunicar cosas al juez.Es tu  APODERADO, en el caso este de poder especial, eS LIMITADA la funcion del apoderado, es solo para ESE caso o situacion. NO PARA TODO, como ocurre con el PODER GENERAL, donde tu apoderado te representara y actuara por ti en TODOS LO QUE SEA PRECISO PEDIR, en tu nombre.  En ambos, no es preciso tu firma.  Bueno, no se si fui clara, quizas limitada, pero el concepto esta, si es lo que precisabas saber, algo te dije,no? suerte.|`|vaWAFVvWaa	un poder se le hace a la persona,subrogar es una especie de autorizacion|`|b3DUo90jaa	http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrogaci%C...

Si tu ests en Madrid, y tienes que firmar un contrato en Londres, y no puedes ir, le entregas un poder a alguien que pueda ir, para que actu en tu lugar. Ojo! que lo que haga el "autorizado" tiene que ser aceptado por ti, quieras o no; salvo que le hayas dado un poder limitado a "x".Los poderes se deben hacer ante Notario, con testigos y con fecha de validez.

If you are going to use the money soon to buy another house or a business, stick the money in a liquid asset like the person above mentioned. For longer investments you may look at money market funds, one that is conservative. You really need to talk to a few investment counselors. Just don't go to one that can only sell you their product.     Do not make a decision while you are in their office. Take time to think about it. Also do not do business with someone that will come to your home. It is a sign they are new and getting prospects or work for an aggressive company.
oWLe7TNIaa	This all depends on your realtor, mortgage broker, and lender.  If you're applying for a government loan (VA, FHA) it could take 90-120 days to close on it.  If you're going through a traditional lender (Wells Fargo, Taylor Bean) you could close in as little as two weeks.    I would wait until you're fully approved and have a closing date set to terminate your lease.  If you have a nice landlord, discuss with them your options.  You can never ever set a timeframe on buying a house because you just never know what will come up, especially until the home inspection is completed.   You may find out that there's mold damage in the crawl space beneath the house that makes it unsafe but the sellers won't fix it (can cost up to 15K to get that remedied)... in that case you'd have to walk away from the contract.    Generally 90% of people have a smooth loan process, but I work in the mortgage industry and there is that 10% of loans that is just a nightmare for us and for the borrowers.      Typically 30-45 days will do it from signing the purchase contract to closing, but can take up to 3-4 months dependent on several factors including what lender you use, how picky the sellers are, what your assets are like, what your credit score is like, what your debt ratio is, etc, etc.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Talk to your landlord now to see what options you would have after your lease ends. Its impossible to know if it will take you 3 weeks or 3 months to find the house that you want.     Of course, the bigger question is whether or not youll be able to get a loan at all. With the current limited availability of credit, even people who were considered well qualified 6 or 12 months ago now can't get loan.     I suggest applying for a loan around the 1st of February since pre-approvals are usually valid for 60 days. If you want to apply sooner, just make sure you have the funds to cover both a mortgage & your rent. I started house hunting three months before my lease expired, and found THE house within a couple of weeks. I closed with two months left to go on my lease and since the fee to get out of it was equal to two months rent, I was in the same boat whether I canceled it or not. It was nice to have time to clean & paint the house before moving though.     In the meantime, get your free credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com to make sure that you dont have any old debts that need to be cleared and that there isnt any inaccurate info that you need to dispute. And save, save, save. A down payment is no longer optional and some loan programs expect you to have 10% down.    |`|AA10283296	No one can answer that.    Home sales, on distressed (foreclosed) properties are grinding very slowly, if at all right now.  Banks aren't offering mortgages, the federal government is broke and everything is in turmoil.  I was told by a realtor that she has had two sales, that took so long, that the value of the house dropped and the mortgage company would no longer approve the mortgage.    You have time.  Most leases allow for a month to month renewal after the first year.  And many landlords would rather have a good paying tenant stay, than kick them out because they don't have a whole year lease.    One thing to ask yourself, is do you have sterling credit and a large down payment?  The days of easy lending are over for now, if not forever.    Good luck.|`|pC3ikbTaaa	30 days should be fine. Make sure you have a down payment of at least 3% to put down on the home.    Good luck!

Selecciona a una persona capacitada. Para ello, elabora un examen antes de contratarlo. Si tu no puedes hacerlo, pide que alguien que conozca lo haga.    2. Controla la chequera. Ten una junta semanal con el contador, donde te detalle los movimientos bancarios, entradas y salidas, y te explique muy bien cada una de ellas.    3. Mensualmente exige tus estados financieros y tus declaraciones de impuestos, es decir que se engargolen y se archiven mensualmente.    4. Si tu empresa genera ms de 10 miilones al a?o, vale bien la pena contratar unos auditores, que te hagan una auditoria anual. Te va a costar unos $50,000 pesos, pero vale la pena, pues ellos, te dirn si el contador es capaz y de confianza o no.    Espero estos peque?os consejos te sirvan de algo.
PjQIDFBPaa	You've raised several questions that need to be considered separately.    You don't have to get a business tax ID number. Lots of small businesses run by an individual report their income on the personal tax return, normally on Schedule C.  You could get a copy of the Schedule and use it to identify expenses that you might overlook.    In general, the tax law says that you have to report income from any source, whether you call it a hobby or a business. The IRS' Summertime Tip in the link below notes:  "The IRS isnt trying to spoil your fun but if your favorite activity makes a profit every year or so, there may be tax implications that surprise you. For one thing, you must report and pay tax on income from almost all sources, including hobbies."    If you're selling soap, you also should claim your costs as deductions, so you only pay tax on the net income.    So, how do you keep it simple?  (1) You report the income on your personal tax return.  (2) You keep careful records of your sales and your expenses, as you go along. You don't want to be at year end, guessing at how much you earned or spent on expenses.  (3) Check on your legal obligations: Does your city require that you have a business license? Does your state require you to collect sales tax?   (4) Talk to an Enrolled Agent (tax expert recognized by the IRS) or a CPA (accounting expert) to advise you on how to report your income, records to keep, and planning ideas -- such as expenses you might be able to deduct and not know about.    What you really want to avoid is failing to report income or failing to pay sales tax, if required. Penalties and legal fights can not only cost a lot, but keep you from running your business (adding a greater cost).  |`|Pjm9pg7iaa	DOn't even worry about EIN until you make $30,000 a year.  You do want to declare the income as earned.  That is smart so you never have to worry later if the business gets successful..
PjQIDFBPaa	The W-2 simply tells you how much income you need to report, and how much tax they withheld from your pay, so you get credit for having paid it.  If you move, you should notify each employer you had, to make sure they send you a W-2 at your new address.     If you want to file your own tax returns, you can get the federal tax forms you need from the nearest IRS office, but you will also need forms to report income to the states where you worked. Most states have tax filing information on their web sites.    You probably want to have someone prepare your return for you, and I'd suggest getting started by early February, in case you need to get any additional records. Also, you may get a refund of some tax you paid, so if you file earlier, you'll get your refund earlier. For security and speed, have the refund sent electronically by the IRS to your bank account. You get the refund in a week or two usually.    You may have to file a state tax return in more than one state, but most states don't require a return if your income is below a certain level. You still may want to file, because if they withheld taxes from your pay, you can get the tax refunded.    You can find an Enrolled Agent (a tax expert recognized by the IRS), or a CPA (accounting expert) who does tax work, or go into a tax preparation business like H&R Block, but before you select a preparer, ask them if they know how to prepare multiple state returns and if they have the forms for each state where you worked.    When you're more familiar with it, you may want to do your own return. You can file electronically for free with the IRS, but if you're not sure how to do a tax return, I'd suggest going to a tax pro the first time as a way to learn.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The forms are mailed to you by the employer.  If you have moved, dig out old paystubs and send a letter with your current address to the employer.  Do this before 12/31.    The employer mails them to the SSA.  Around May of next year, the SSA sends the IRS their copy.  There is no magic website to get them from before then (and even afterwards, you have to submit a form 4506-T to get the federal copy).    If you worked in different states and any of these states have income tax returns, it's very important to get the employee copy from your employer.|`|AA10469473	Write to or call all of your employers for 2008 NOW and give them your current address so they can mail your W-2's.  Block prepares returns, they aren't going to contact all of your employers to get the forms - and if they did it would cost you a fortune for them to do what you should have done, and you'd still have to come up with a list of all the employers.|`|SZ5NZ9uaaa	You need to notify all of your employers where you live so they can mail you the W-2s.  If you go to a tax shack they can prepare the taxes with the papers you bring, but cannot get them any easier than you can yourself.  Most employers would not mail papers to anyone except you unless you contact them and authorize them to be mailed somewhere else.    You might be better off finding an independent tax preparer, since the tax shacks often charge more than a CPA.  
fSlZQzS4aa	IRS doesn't care what you do as long as it gets its cut.  They would have the same tax obligations as anyone else based on their income.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Self-employment income.  If it's more than $400, they pay 15.3% self-employment tax.|`|PjQIDFBPaa	Many are probably employees of the establishment where they work, so they receive a W-2 like other employees and report wages on their tax returns.    The income they earn is taxable like any other compensation for services (i.e., wages).    If they are working independently, they may report business income instead of wages, and they type of business probably depends on the service. They could list their business as modeling, entertainment, or if not merely doing performances, perhaps a massage or escort service. Like any other business, they would want to report any deductible expenses, and only pay tax on net income.    If the service is not legal, and perhaps you referred to prostitutes in your phrase "adult entertainers", one problem they may face is that deductions are not allowed for expenses of an activity contrary to public purpose. For example, drug dealers are required to report their gross income, but are not permitted to deduct the cost of the drugs. This allows the authorities an additional method of prosecuting criminals, for tax-related crimes.|`|7z4WFLLvaa	They file a Sch C along with their 1040 tax return. They report their income and deduct their expenses to determine the profit of their business. Like all self employed, it is based on the honor system.

AA11252292	Deja, ca depend ce que tu recherches, si tu veux "jouer" de l'argent comme tu sembles vouloir "jouer en Bourse", honnetement, va faire un tour au Casino tu seras encore plus vite sorti. Apparemment, ce que tu recheches c'est le trading a court terme et la c'est completement different d'une strategie d'investissement qui elle est necessairement de long terme (5 ans minimum).     Si tu veux faire du trading, tu as deux possibilites: les Actions et le Forex. Oublie les Options. A moins de faire des montages hybrides, les options achetees seules sont trop cheres et risquees du fait des commissions + effet de levier. Si tu veux faire de l'argent avec les Options, il faut les VENDRE - autrement dit vendre de la volatilite mais la ca te demande une couverture en capital et/ou actif sous-jacent generalement trop importante pour un petit investisseur. Par pitie, oublie les warrants egalement. La Soge se fait un plaisir de faire un ble monstre sur ton dos a te pricer des options/warrants dont les dynamiques de prix defient tous les modeles de pricing recents - bien entendus a l'avantage de la Soge. Les Warrants sont des Options impures destinees a enrichir ceux qui les vendent. Suivez mon regard.    Maintenant, t'as les Actions et le Forex. Sur les Actions, tu vas avoir a payer les commissions (forfaitaires generalement ca va te faire tres mal si tu trades a petite echelle) et l'horizon court terme est 1 a 3 mois pour couvrir tes frais, tes impots et voir un minimum de gains s'accumuler. Il faut que tu utilises analyse fondamentale ET technique. Sinon, t'as le Forex, pas de commission et faramineux (tres dangereux) effet de levier generalement 100:1, horizon d'investissement entre 1 minute (non je plaisante pas) et 3 jours. Mais la t'as interet de decoincer serieusement en maths et d'avoir un algorithme qui fonctionne. C'est du trading purement quantitatif et generalement un boulot de physicien/ingenieur plutot que de banquier.     Voila, en bref, GO BIG, GO SMART or GO HOME.|`|4dce72aa6fd9b0bcd71fbbfce072d06daa	francesco, t'as exacement la mme tte que moi...coincidence? heuresement t'as les yeux marrons.|`|fe6517334df856c28ecb9e3e6151a3cdaa	En quelques mots tu n'as aucune garantie de gagner de l'argent.  Ce n'est pas parce que la bourse a eu une croissance dlirante depuis 25 ans que ce sera identique pour les 25 prochaines annes.    Si tu es optimiste et pense que ?a va continuer, alors les enseignements du pass montre qu'il faut:    - Un fort placement de dpart pour pouvoir diversifier ton portefeuille. On ne met pas tous ses oeufs dans le mme panier en bourse.    - Un horizon temporel long. On ne doit placer de l'argent que si on peut le laisser au moins 7  10 ans. Donc il faut placer de l'argent  dont on n'a pas besoin.    Aprs si tu te fout de tout ?a et que tu recherches des conseils d'conomie casino, tu peux toujours tenter de placer toutes tes conomies sur les compagnies petrolieres en pariant qu'elles aient mont dans 6 mois ou un an.

Cet engagement rciproque constitue dj une vente ds lors que le bien immobilier est identifi et son prix fix.          Toutefois, depuis le 1er juin 2001, lacqureur non professionnel dun logement  usage dhabitation peut se rtracter dans un dlai de 7 jours  compter du lendemain de la rception de lacte ou de la premire prsentation de la lettre recommande lui notifiant lacte.         Lors de la signature du compromis, il est dusage que lacqureur verse une somme dargent (en gnral 10%) afin darrter laffaire.         Cependant, ce versement ne peut avoir lieu que si la transaction a lieu par lintermdiaire dun professionnel disposant dune garantie financire (ce qui est le cas de lagence A-C-D Immobilier, adhrente de la FNAIM).         Ds lors que l'acqureur n'a pas renonc  son projet d'achat en vertu du dlai de rtractation, cette somme dargent constitue un acompte sur le prix de vente et ne pourra pas lui tre restitue (sauf si des conditions suspensives ne sont pas ralises dans les dlais, et notamment celle qui concerne lobtention dun ventuel emprunt).          Ainsi, le dlai de rtractation pass, les engagements rciproques sont immdiatement irrvocables et, en cas de difficults, chacun pourra contraindre lautre  payer le solde du prix convenu et  rgulariser la vente par acte authentique (chez un notaire) pour quelle puisse produire tous ses effets.          Une clause pnale est dailleurs en gnral prvue dans le compromis afin que chacun respecte ses engagements. Cette clause pnale a pour objet de sanctionner par le versement d'une indemnit (somme dargent) le non-respect par une partie d'obligations qu'elle a souscrites dans le cadre d'un contrat.|`|a10663e39ec0b73b8d77842f41271401aa	aucunes restrictions, toutes closes est bonne  tre indique dans le compromis en prenant bien en compte qu'elle soit bnfique  l'acheteur.  cette procedure permet de palier  tous problmes et il faut lors de la signature de l'acte authentique que toutes les closes soient tombes pour que la vente prnne effet.

Petit conseil d'un fou de pizza.  Si tu es pret d'une ecole et que tu as une forte clientel de passage, la qualite de tes pizza sont pas specialement important. Du momment que c'est pas cher, les gens achetent plus par necessite que pour gouter la meilleur pizza du monde.    Parcontre, si ton emplacement et plus un emplacement de quartier, investi dans de bon produit et applique toi sur la qualite quitte a faire moins de marge. Perso, ca fait 8 ans que je vais toujours au meme livreure de pizza (La Calzonne, saint jean, Toulon) car ils utilisent des produit frais qui font la difference. De la vrai mozza par exemple ca change tous.    La qualite fera venir la clientelle, la competition dans les pizzas est rude donc ne soit pas radin sur tes marges (surtout au debut)    Perso je pense que c est un super plan, mais c est pa un metier facile.    dernier conseil, je connais un camion de pizza qui lui se permet de tourner dans les petites villes du haut var (2 jours fixes pas ville, voir meme un).

You can start by looking at www.dangerzonejobs.com and seeing if any of the companies on their list have jobs available in your field. I'm currently looking for systems administration jobs for a contractor over there, because the pay is about three times what I can get in the states, and I can retire in 5 years (I'm 22, by the way) if I go.

Most the people who have been kidnapped or killed have been working outside, or going out to talk to the locals a lot.

44b01cfffb12fefbd1cf6ed3020c2c11aa	There is much more money in chess than there once was, but it is still very difficult to make a living at chess unless you are a strong master.  A few professionals support themselves  through their tournament winnings, but I believe even the top pros make  a considerable  percentage of their income from teaching and book sales.  If you are not already a master, it may be too late to pursue chess as a career.  If you have an aptitude for this kind of thing, poker is becoming quite popular, and you certainly can make a good living at it.  You can play live "cash" games at legal card clubs and Indian casinos, and tournaments are everywhere.  It is a precarious way to earn a living, but then so is chess.  Good luck in whatever path you choose!|`|125d00670c4e0123ef6748269ea2165faa	"Rooks of it"!|`|d982bd118877d004ed4e95f7a7055f06aa	The only serious money in Chess is through high-level tournaments, unfortunately.

AA12324549	One suggestion is to visit the Staple Center's personnel office and ask for the person in charge of event planning (or visit the local arena where events are held). You'll probably have to make an appointment. This appointment would be in the form of an informational interview where you could ask 6-7 questions on their position. I'm guessing they might hold a degree in marketing or something similar.  Also check the local college web site and see if they offer a marketing degree. Also ask about internships available in event planning. The events I've attended (i.e., job fairs) were staffed by interns from the local college/university.|`|AA11282948	http://www.collegeboard.com/csearch/majo...

If that doesn't work, for public companies, the EIN (or "IRS No.") is printed on the first page of 10-Ks, 20-Fs and other SEC filings, which you can get on the Internet for free (see the Filings section of "Securities and Exchange Commission"). For private companies, EINs are often included in the company's Dun & Bradstreet report (see "Dun & Bradstreet Reports"), they are often printed on the company's invoices, or you can try searching the FEIN databases on KnowX.com http://knowx.com/ , Westlaw (FEIN-ALL) or Lexis (D&B;FEIN), which uses Dun & Bradstreet data. If the company files with a Secretary of State the EIN may be on its annual report. If the company filed for bankruptcy, the EIN may be on the docket sheet as part the company's address.    For non-profits, EINs are often included in the the profile on Form 990, available through Guidestar ( http://www.guidestar.org ). In addition, nonprofit EINs are often included in the records in the Lexis EOTEXT file.    For political parties and other political organizations, EINs are reported on Form 8871, available through the IRS Web site ( http://www.irs.gov/charities/political ).     For insurance companies, the number should be at the top of their annual financial statement, which you can get if you dig deep enough on the NAIC Web site (http://www.naic.org/cis/).    If that doesn't work, UCC filings sometimes have EINs, though they usually don't (see also "Uniform Commercial Code").|`|cbd0d71203a70370e95df111368077b9aa	Go to your state webpage and hunt around for business.

AA11262612	Case Study, History, and Strategic Analysis of Motorola Inc      Uploaded by exonmor on Aug 6, 2005      --------------------------------------...     Strategic Analysis of Motorola Inc     The company that I chose to complete my Strategic Analysis on is Motorola Inc.. Many of us are familiar with Motorola products due to the advent of the cellular phones. Regardless of the carrier of the service, be it Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, many of these companies use a cellular device created by Motorola. However, the company does much more than just producing cell phones. One area that Motorola is trying to focus its current strategic actions in the area of Semiconductors.     History/Financial Portfolio Motorola Inc. started with the founding of the company by Paul V.Galvin (figure 1). Paul and his brother Joseph E .Galvin purchased a battery eliminator business from Stewart Storage Battery Company which made battery eliminators used in operating radios using household current in 1928 and created 'Galvin Manufacturing Company'. The company started with five employees and grew gradually. It expanded its business into automobile industry, by introducing auto radios sold to independent auto distributors and automotive dealers. With Galvin Manufacturing Company entering into the auto industry, Paul V. Galvin coined the word Figure 1 'MOTOROLA' linking motion and radio.     Daniel E. Noble joined Galvin Manufacturing Company in 1940 as Director of Research. As a pioneer in FM radio communications and semiconductor technology he originated the first hand-held two-way radio for the Connecticut State Police. He brought his designs to Galvin Manufacturing Company and developed a two-way radio system for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Because of this, Galvin Manufacturing Company played a significant role in World War II with radio and communications equipment like the "walkie-talkie" (figure 2) and "handie-talkie".     The first public stock offering occurred in 1947. The company's name was officially changed to Motorola Inc. In 1948 Motorola entered into the television business and with more than 100,000 of these TV sets sold in one year, Motorola catapulted into fourth place in the television industry. During the late 1940's Motorola began to supply auto radios to Ford and Chrysler plants for installation in their automobiles.     Motorola introduced dispatcher radios by taking advantage of expanded allocation of radio frequencies and with aggressive marketing and a reputation for reliable equipment earned a leading role in the industry. Daniel E. Noble launched a Motorola Research and Development facility in Phoenix, Arizona. He anticipated the enormous potential of the newly invented transistor and helped Motorola became one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductors.     By 1950 the net sales of Motorola was $177,104,669 and the number of employees had grown to 9,325. Unfortunately, in 1952, Motorola's first color television was short of success due to technical problems, a high price tag, and the failure of broadcasters to offer an adequate amount of color programming. The product was pulled from the market in 1956. Among some of the innovations for which Motorola is famous are a new radio communications product, a small radio receiver called a "pager" that delivered a radio message selectively to a particular individual carrying the device and the "Motrac" with such low power consumption that radios in automobiles were able to operate without running the car engine Motorola was the first company to use epitaxial method to mass-produce semiconductors. It used low cost techniques in making silicon rectifiers, used in automobile alternators. In place of auto generators, the Automotive Products Division began producing alternators, inaugurating the company's role as a supplier of "under the hood" electronics. Motorola, in a joint venture with National Video, developed the first rectangular picture tube for color TVs and with Ford and RCAs designed and made 8-track tape players for the auto industry. Domestic and foreign auto manufacturers soon became customers for tape players and 8-track players became the Automotive Product Division's second major product line.     As the cost of semiconductors continued to decline, their application in consumer electronic products increased and created a new major market. Motorola responded with a full line of low cost plastic encapsulated transistors. The design of these devices was eventually adopted by the entire semiconductor industry. In 1967 the company expanded its international presence by adding six plants around the world. Lunar roving vehicles used Motorola's FM radio receiver to provide a voice link spanning the 240,000 miles between the Earth and the moon. It was 100 times more sensitive than any car radio. Motorola entered into the manufacture of components for battery powered quartz and between 1971 and 1979, the company gained critical experience in producing and supplying integrated circuits, quartz crystals, and miniature motors to manufacturers like Timex, Benrus and Bulova.     The company introduced its first 6800 microprocessor (see figure 3), which used only 5 volts of power for the communication and business machines sector in 1975. In 1979 Motorola introduced its first 16-bit microprocessor, Figure 3 the 68000. Capable of completing two million calculations per second, it used to run and write programs for scientific, data processing, and business applications.     In the 1980's Motorola controlled the emerging U.S. market for cellular phones and pagers but they were not aggressively focused on competing with the Japanese, even after Japanese firms began to flood the U.S. market with low-priced, high-quality telephones and pagers. Motorola, finding itself, pushed into the background heard the call to battle. Managers at first were not sure how t

Check the newspaper ads for domestic jobs like house sitting, child care, maybe walking dogs(exercise never hurt a pregnant woman, it's actually better for you). There are many jobs you could do. Remember our ancestors used to work on farms, etc performing hard labor right up until the birth. They never complained. Unless of course your doctor finds you have a problem with your pregnancy. That is a different story.Best wishes.
AGq9XJTtaa	I'd feel like I made a choice in Dec 2000 that I regret now.    But I'd also feel this - there were some positives in your choice:    You will enjoy the use (and lower maintenance cost) of the new car instead of a used car... and if you still have the car in 2007 it's newer than the used one would have been.    You will have no interest payments or car payments over teh enxt 5 yrs (if you'd financed it).    You can establish credit tomorrow with a credit card as easily as with a car loan.    You can get a job.    You can do all the above, or you can take the $50 you have left and go get drunk (not recommended).    We all make decisions we regret later (I will not call them mistakes). Winners like you and me move ahead and keep trying.    good luck, brother|`|gi9ixnr8aa	I did it once and I can do it again if I start now. I made a mistake but I learned from it.

Il y avait beaucoup de demande pour deux raisons : parce qu'il y avait beaucoup d'argent  placer et parce que les taux taient bas.    Il y avait beaucoup d'argent  placer parce qu'il n'a pas beaucoup d'autre endroit o s'investir, les entreprises n'investissant pas beaucoup. Le krach de 2001 avait dcourag beaucoup d'investisseurs d'acheter des actions. Les obligations ne rapportant pas beaucoup, les investisseurs se sont reports sur la pierre en esprant y gagner des sous. C'est comme les actions en 1999-2000. On peut gagner plein de sous quand ?a monte, il faut juste penser  sortir avant que ?a ne se casse la gueule.     Les taux taient bas (c'est bien fini) parce que personne n'empruntait beaucoup, parce que les entreprises n'investissaient pas.    C'est donc dans tous les cas un effet d'une faible croissance conomique relle.    Pourquoi les entreprises n'investissent pas ? Parce qu'elles ne voient pas o le faire de manire suffisamment rentable.    C'est combien, suffisamment ?    Pour les investisseurs, c'est au moins 10%.

Les investisseurs se trouvaient donc avec de l'argent peu cher et avec peu de confiance pour la bourse. Beaucoup d'actifs se sont donc dirigs vers un secteur rput solide et rentable : l'immobilier, l'investissement dans la pierre. Les prix ont donc mont fortement et continu  monter tant qu'il n'existait pas d'autres alternatives.

Disadvantages: Cost to trade can be expensive. volatility is high, you can loose alot of money quickly.     Mutual Funds:  Advantages: Diversification, you are allowing a professional who knows what they are doing (at least we hope so) manage your money for you. Because you invest the mutual fund invest in a portfolio of stocks or bonds you reduce your risk (don't have all your eggs in one basket). Typically the most common and arguable the best investment for the average long term investor.    Disadvantages: Not as liquid as an individual stock, can be expensive in terms of fees.     Life Insurance:   Advantages: Creates security for you and your family should something happen to you ensures your family is taken care of. Depending on the type of life insurance you purchase it also provides you with a solid idea of what will be waiting for your family when you pass.    Disadvantages: The most expensive of the three, very hard to get out of usually has a surrender charge associated with the cancelation of the policy. In the case of Term life insurance if you cancel the policy you will not have any balance for the premiums you paid. The least liquid of the 3 investments.|`|gi9ixnr8aa	Life Ins is an expensive way to get value. Mutual funds are somewhat expensive but stocks cost to buy or sell and some brokers charge a maintenance fee-otherwise they are free. Life ins takes the risk if the market goes down. mutual funds are stocks like ETF's-which trade like stocks. Mutual funds have commissions to buy or sell plus fees plus taxes if they sell for a profit-and you do not get extra money to help pay the tax. ETF's could be the best buy to diversify a portfolio.|`|AA10515045	(1) You buy insurance before you have the net worth to cover the unexpected. Hence, it is your first investment . . . protect yourself and those you love.  (2) You buy mutual funds when you are funding your 401k, iRA, and starting out your investing life.  (3) You buy a home (you forgot that in your list)  (4) You buy stocks when all your other investments are fleshed out and you are still young enough to withstand substantial risk and have money you can afford to lose. (Some never need to get to this point because all the others above do so well).

The best thing is to talk to your landlord and pay the rent for the time you have lived in the apartment. If you had a lease and your landlord is semi-nice (they're never super nice people in my exp.) the security deposit will cover the fact that you are terminating your lease. If the landlord wants, they can sue you for breach of contract. This is worse-case but it almost happened to me. Also, tenant laws can be different depending on where you live. This was in Chicago for me.|`|5804cff4c97c5ce8cb2b118ff50a50b7aa	It will depend on the wording in your lease, I am a landlord and it states that no security deposit may be used to pay for rent it is for security reasons only.

MsbqwGTqaa	I'm a lender on Prosper, and there are 2 things in your question that cause me to lose interest in your listing before I've even looked at it:    1. You asked people to "donate".  Prosper loans are NOT donations.  They are real loans from real people who are trusting you by investing in you and expect to be paid back.  Referring to them as donations implies to a potential lender that you don't intend to pay it back.  That is dishonest and will also mess up your credit record since Prosper reports late payments and defaults to the credit & collection agencies.    2. You don't know what your Prosper user ID is.  This makes it look like you're disorganized or forgetful which can scare off lenders ("If  they can't remember their user id, how will they remember to make their payments?").    Please take this as constructive criticism.  Remember that even though Prosper isn't a traditional bank and  it's regular people funding your loan, you still need to present yourself well and make sure to pay the money back.    If your Prosper ID is mom_student_23 then your listing should have a chance.  Your record is clean, amount & rate are reasonable.  DTI is high so you should explain how you're going to pay the loan.  Don't worry if you don't get bids for a few days, that's normal.  People like to jump on at the last minute.    I've provided you a link in the Sources section to a thread on the Prosper forums that lists a lot of tips from lenders and borrowers.  Please read it.  Also ask your group leader for advice.  If funded, you're going to be paying him/her an additional 1/2% in interest so make sure he/she earns it.    Best wishes for you and your mom.|`|Y5iALhyNaa	looks great!

qmgUlGKPaa	It definitely depends on your work ethic. When starting off it is very hard to build your client list. If you have good (wealthy) contacts this job will definitely be a lot easier. Most blue chip finance companies don't want to fire Financial ad visors out of college, they want Fa's that have already been successful with other sub par financial companies. I also think that when starting off most companies will ditch you after a couple of years if your not productive, instead of leading you and helping you be more productive.    I would major with a finance or economics degree. After that you will have to take your series 7 to become a stock broker. That is after you have a company to sponsor you.    And also you should definitely be an outgoing social person for this job. Good with numbers and also be very hard working. I'm in college right now and I'm also very interested in this field...

They claim that his wealth has come as a result of selling books and audio presentations about topics he has not personally succeeded in and that he is probably worth far less than the US$50 to US$100 million he once claimed in an interview."|`|3f43024b890acb9ec398f800fe6b3de7aa	Business cycles:  Peak   Trough   Contraction   Expansion (boom)    Timelines for each throughout history:  http://www.nber.org/cycles.html    http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/busi...

Demographics come into play-are you up on that? The business cycle moves but when it shifts to depression what are you going to do?|`|14epsGd3aa	The length in time on how long the cycle last, depends on the diameter of the wheel and the speed it rotate. See, sometimes, like the stock market, the upward trend of the market is too slow that it may reach its top in 3 or more years (of Bull). Sometimes it moves fast that it's over in a year or less. Same as on its downward turn.    The guy you are talking about still don't know  perhaps, whether the market he hopped off have already reach the top of the cycle, when he jumped into another wheel - the commodity market. I only hope he landed on the upward side of that wheel, or else if he landed on the downward side, he must have been flattened on its bottom if he haven't able to hop-off to some other market. Hence, possible reason why you haven't hear anything about him anymore.
LpVwWJVsaa	You as a tenant must respond to this notice by mail within 7 days after receipt of same, otherwise you will forfeit the amount claimed for damages.<br>  <br>  If you dispute these amounts, you must notify the landlord in writing and state specific reasons why you disagree with the charges.<br>  <br>  In Michigan, there is a maximum that landlords can charge for all deposits.  It's equal to a month and a half of rent.  Anything over that is illegal, however, she can charge for damages.  <br>  <br>  The law defines the term “security deposit” and limits the amount that may be collected (not to exceed 11?2 times the monthly rent). Refundable fees are deemed—by definition—to be security deposits.<br>  Nonrefundable fees are not; and they can be assessed in any amount for any reason but the reason and matters covered by the fee must be<br>  clear. A nonrefundable fee may not cover matters also covered by refundable fees.<br>  <br>  What must the LANDLORD do at end of the lease?<br>  If the landlord receives the tenant’s forwarding address within 4 days of move out, the landlord has 30 days from move out to either<br>  <br>  a) Return the entire amount of the deposit by check or money order, OR<br>  b) Send—by mail—an itemized list of damages lawfully assessed against the deposit and a check or money order for the remaining<br>  balance of the deposit (if any).<br>  <br>  The itemized list must also contain the following notice: “You must respond to this notice by mail within 7 days after receipt of same. Otherwise you will forfeit the amount claimed for damages.” (See example, page 49.)<br>  <br>  Q3 What must the tenant do when he or she receives the itemized list of damages?<br>  <br>  If the tenant disputes any of the items on the itemized list, the tenant MUST respond—in detail, by mail—within 7 days of his or her receipt of that list. “Responding in detail” means giving reasons why the tenant<br>  disputes each item of damage and the amount assessed against his or her security deposit, and why he or she should not be responsible.<br>  Simply making a blanket statement that the tenant does not agree will not do; the tenant must address each item on the list individually.<br>  The tenant’s detailed response must be sent to the landlord by mail.<br>  <br>  Q4 What must the landlord do once he or she receives notice of the tenant’s dispute of the itemized list of damages?<br>  <br>  If the tenant disputes all or part of the itemized list of damages, the landlord is left with two choices:<br>  a) Negotiate or mediate an agreement in writing with the tenant<br>  OR<br>  b) Commence an action in court for a money judgment for damages that he or she claimed against the tenant’s security deposit, which the tenant disputes.<br>  <br>  Remember, the security deposit remains the tenant’s property until the landlord perfects a claim to it—either by agreement or<br>  by court order. If the landlord and tenant cannot agree and if the landlord goes to court, he or she MUST prove that the tenant is<br>  actually responsible for the damages.<br>  <br>  Q5 Who must file suit—the landlord or the tenant—for the security deposit?<br>  <br>  Either the landlord or the tenant can be the plaintiff in a security deposit suit. The landlord may file suit within 45 days<br>  from termination of occupancy. If both the tenant and the landlord have followed the security deposit timeline perfectly and there still remains a dispute on the amount of damages assessed against the tenant’s security deposit, the landlord MUST file suit to retain the deposit. If the landlord does not file suit, he or she may be liable to the tenant for<br>  double the amount of the security deposit retained. The tenant may be required to file suit in certain circumstances. The burden of filing suit<br>  shifts to the tenant if:<br>  a) The tenant failed to provide his or her forwarding address in writing within 4 days of terminating occupancy, OR<br>  b) The tenant failed to respond—by mail—to the itemized list of damages within 7 days of receiving it, OR<br>  c) The landlord failed to return the tenant’s deposit after receiving the tenant’s response disputing the amount assessed against it.<br>  <br>  I know that with my property it does not cost $250 to get carpets cleaned.  Air duct cleaning would seem to me to be under preventative maintenance and as for the nail holes, your landlord can charge you for them, however, it is questionable since you (I hope) filled out a move-in inspection form and returned it with the notation that there were nail holes from the previous resident.  Did you take pics of the place before and after you moved in?<br>  <br>  As for the water/sewer issue, most cities around here bill in three month increments.  She might not be able to provide you with a bill for that right away, however, I don't know if she would be able to make a claim against it (if it's gone beyond 45 days). <br>  <br>  Your best bet at this point would be to talk to Legal Aid in your area.  Michigan has very very complex issues regarding landlord/tenant laws, rights and responsibilites.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Dirt is not normal, it is OK to charge for cleaning the carpets.    DId you expect her to rent them out dirty?    250 is about right.    The only reason she would need to clean the air ducts is if you had animals or you smoked.   If you did neither she should not charge you for this.   It will cost her another 50 or so to clean the oven.    Unless she knew it was you that broke the garage door she should not change you for it.   Normally she should, but since it is shared it is hard to say who broke it.<br>  <br>  This house is not "broom clean", the carpets and oven are dirty by your own accounting.

3a712c629b5526665603766b51642687aa	Here's what I have learned from making a very recent career change with a nice salary upgrade:  Never EVER assume your skills are non transferrable!    I had a professional do my resume.  I disagreed with some of the things she put on it.  For one I would have never listed my graduate schooling as I didn't attain a masters.  I quit due to illness.  I looked upon it as a 'failure.'  She assured me it wasn't.   Turns out my new boss was impressed by my education.     She stressed my organizational skills.  I thought that was wasted space.  She assured me it wasn't.  That caught my new boss's eye too.   My new job is pretty much completely based upon organization.    I worked in the family dining industry for 20 years.  My customer service skills translated very well into the postition I now have in HEALTH CARE!!!    Never EVER think that you can't do what you want to "because..."    I once felt like you--locked into things, but no more!  Go for it!  Even if you don't get hired this particular time, you will gain a whole wealth of experience in other ways!  Best wishes to you!  -----    Oh--and one more thing--Never walk into an interview (actually you should call it an "appointment" ) and say something like "I know you're looking for this, but I can..."  On NO!  You tell them how you would "be an asset and fit nicely into their organization because..."      And ask your most reliable and impressive clients if they would mind acting as references for you.|`|AA10033605	You can have a very good resume' by just listing properly what you have mentioned. Under work experience/jobs - list the company, in this case it happens to be your own, where you have worked. Give it an appropriate name if you have not already. Under the education part of the resume', list what you have completed, and another section as "in-progress". Employers looking for a completed degree may not be interested yet, but many will look at what you have accomplished already and perhaps be interested in employing you.|`|6e8dbbb04f91c22189b3dd9a9bb9419aaa	Finding a job when you have so little to offer in the way of what you describe will be tough, but you have to persevere if you want to succeed. All I can say is "Hang in there."|`|SFTB2bg5aa	First of all, you'll never get penalized for working while attending school, that is always looked upon as a positive attribute.  Secondly, being persistent and possibly utilizing a curriculum vitae instead of a resume may be a way of showing off these 'soft skills' you have by explaining them through customer satisfaction figures and references... Unfortunately, recruiters tend to look at experience first ahead of intangible skill.|`|wJ3xEdW1aa	You could put on there some previous volunteer work or you could say that you worked for a friend, family member, church some type of organization basically saying that you like to work with people and you get along great with people and you have no problem with doing what you are asked to do.|`|ad4ae711598f6cda6962f969b306bdabaa	Instead of having the typical resume, you can have a skills section:  Start off with your name, etc, then  list out your qualifications:    Administrative & Computer           bullet some successes you have  Customer service:   Sales: Grew company from XX to YY over 5 years.    This needs to be tailored to the job you are applying for. You need to be able, through your resume, to show that you have the skills required fr the job you are applying for.    Education: BA degree in Business (or whatever), expected  June 2008)  is fine. It shows you are getting it at night and it hasnet interifered with your reent jb success.    What type of job do you want?  You need to find some people who do that job, and get them to refer you into their company.

The tests given for pre-employment target THC, cocaine and opiates.  They are not concerned about things like Zanax, or anti-depressants, or other Rx's.  If the test does flag as positive for something, they would only ask you about it.  Unless you gobble mass amounts of Vitamin Z to cop bizarre buzzz, you're safe.  A simple explanation of "anxiety" or "insomnia" would suffice.  They are not going to shred your application and chances for employment over a half Z... unless it was the size of a grapefruit.

When I worked at call centres, most of my co-workers were college students.  We werent required to have anything more than high school or equivalent; and that was for insurance reasons.    Call centre work can be tedious and stressful...its not as easy as you may think.  Depending where you work, you may or may not be able to study at work.  Try and get an "inbound" call centre job.  That is where people call you.  Inbound is a bit less stress than cold calling people trying to sell things.      One to avoid....Faneuil Group.  I worked for them in Canada a few years ago and they werent able to make payroll.  A lot of people got stuck with that one.  If you apply with Convergys, make sure you have signed for working before you move or turn away another job.  A few people I know were verbally told they had jobs with that company and when they moved, came to the company and were told sorry, no openings now.    Good luck!|`|AA12010102	Yes, but I would highly suggest you find work in an area you're truly interested in.  Note, many companies will help you pay for college if your degree will assist you in your job.  Call centers aren't usually one of them.    Good luck and start your 401K plan as soon as your graduate!!

95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	Not a good idea to lie, you run the risk of being exposed as a liar. This is a small World and you never know if someone from that company knows someone from your previous job.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's better not to mention a job from which you were fired (assuming it was for something bad) but if you can't help it then at least tell your side of the story and hope for the best; avoid sounding rude or mean about the previous company, and don't mention the phrase "I'm going to sue them".<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Then you were "LAID OFF", not "fired"; remember that because it makes a big difference. A "lay off" it's when the company needs to terminate employment because they want to save costs for example, so you have nothing to hide becasue it was not your fault.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Be honest or if they ever find out it will be grounds for termination.|`|23SkYEw5aa	be honest.|`|rxjdovzyaa	I'd go the honest route.  A lot of people are getting laid off these days, so there is much less stigma attached.  Requesting that they not contact your current employer is bound to raise a lot of red flags with a prospective employer and may make it less likely that you will get the job.

7rKUmK0qaa	yes.. because hospitals usually hires RN but you can also try Psych/ behavioral department. They hire a lot of LPNS there.<br>  For doctors office its hard,too because they usually hire Medical assistant. Medical assistants get paid less compare to LPNS thats why clinics hire mostly medical asst.<br>  <br>  My husband is an LPN but he works in a hospital, behavioral health. He sometimes comes home w bruises from crazy patients. Unless you're willing to deal w mentally disturbed patients, then you have no prob working in a psych hospital.<br>  <br>  Although some hospitals hires LPNs but not much as an RN. <br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|UBypaQtFaa	I think it depends on which state you live in.  I wouldn't want to work in a nursing home either but as an LPN I do work in an Assisted Living facility and I love it! The elderly people I care for are very much "with it" and because it is a long term facility, I get to know them very well and form close bonds with many of them.  My responsibilities there include medication administration, home health aide supervision and any treatments needed (but unlike nursing homes, there are not many treatments). Where I live, (upstate NY), the doctor offices hire mostly LPN's so it wouldn't be difficult to find employment in a doctor's office for me. I suggest you look into urgent care settings and actually go to some assisted living facilities for a tour, you may be surprised at what you find.  Good luck to you!|`|cTDHt2WEaa	I agree with Iris first paragraph. Most jobs are in nursing homes. Office jobs are hard to come by and your pay would be closer to a CNA's pay. <br>  <br>  However, there are some other jobs besides psych Hospital jobs. You could work for group homes for the mentally retarded and developmentally  disabled. You can also work in homes through an agency or privately, you can make good money doing that. Some work for employment services. But remember most of the jobs are in long term care facilities.|`|akLD5rHTaa	Know such jobs exact for an LPN.

AA11485984	First question you should ask yourself is "Why do I want to sell insurance"? Do you feel you can compete against some 10,000 other<br>  Insurance agents?If you are looking to buy Life Insurance,would you buy from yourself, and why? Ask 100 of your friends if they would buy from you see how many of them will.<br>  If so, you need to dedicate all your mind and soul. It is a rewarding career if you are successful. I assure you though, it is not a part-time job. <br>  It is like trying to be a "Movie Star"<br>  <br>  Ustun Inan Insurance

d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	In Foreign trade transactions, a pro forma (or proforma) invoice is a document that states a commitement from the seller to reserve some goods to be sold to a certain person, the buyer. The buyer places an order and if the seller agrees, it extend a proforma invoice; when the buyer receives this invoice and agrees to all the terms specified in it, the goods are sent and the proforma is replaced by a commercial invoice (the definitive document). A proforma invoice doesn't establish any obligation of transfering money from the buyer to the seller.|`|AA11527836	For me, proforma invoice is a statement for an invoice that will be settled out in the future depending on the goods arrival. The function of this kind of invoice is to let the receiver understand how much and have the customer keep as a proof of the transaction before the goods arrival.|`|3bf9018dc9795e4dd1ba70abd3fea902aa	You can reference the proforma invoice on the invoice.

One idea is to create your own advertisement to put on your car so you can have an example display.  Furthermore, keep track of where you drve and what demographics see your car... this way you can say that an approximate 30,000 people see your car every day in neighborhoods with people with expendable incomes.  Lastly, research the Internet on strategies and pricing.  Or... you can present the idea to a local investor who will make mnost of the profits from your business but will give you a steady sum of funds.

1JnH9X34aa	You can send him a certified letter for demand of payment--- keep the return where he signed for it... in the letter give him 14 business days (or more) to pay up.  After he doesn't, file in small claims court... you can find a sample letter for demand of payment online...    Side note: I wouldn't hire an attorney.. they charge a lot-- Yeah, you could sue him for the attorney fee, but the catch is that all you get in court is a "judgement."  All it does is says that someone owes you money- not that they have to pay you... he still may never pay up... which means every 10 yrs or so, you have to go to courthouse and sign for the judgement to stay in effect.  That way he can't buy property... the next catch is that if he moves to another parish or county, you have to file in that courthouse too to keep the judgement against him.    I would try the letter of demand first and then small claims... if he doesn't pay up--  $800 is a cheap lesson learned...  atleast you know now not to give your money to boyfriends  (Don't do what I did and make the same mistake twice!!

There is definitely some value to having help with your carerr and I would say paying by the hour is a more safe way to guage it then to pay for a package deal.  Especially the thousands of dollars offered by some of the big name firms out there.    If someone is willing to coach you for 75 an hour, maybe you can agree to get two hours at a reduce rate.  If you don't feel you are getting any benefit then you are only out 150 bucks and you can write it off as job hunting expense.

If you are in an upper income bracket and you feel a coach can help, check references and even ask to speak to previous clients.|`|a66c8cd0738bbcbc054a260899507038aa	I'll offer you this one piece of advice: Find one coach that you like and trust and stick with him/her. The problem most people have with instructors(myself included),is that they listen to too many people. The more instructors you listen to, the more confusion you're likely to get.      So like I said, get just one instructor(coach) and stick with them.If it doesn't work out, then switch.

C'est la premire question  se poser :  quel problme client rpond mon produit ? Quel(s) besoin(s) je vais satisfaire ? Y a t'il une demande ou un march suffisant ? Quels sont les barrires  l'entre ? ...    2- Quelle stratgie ?    Pour dfinir sa stratgie il faut :  - Choisir une cible prcise.  - Choisir quoi proposer  cette cible: dvelopper un nouveau produit/concept ? faire merger un nouveau bnfice ? faire une nouvelle offre ? ...  Pour cela il faut se baser sur les forces actuelles de l'entreprise plut?t que de devoir dvelopper de nouvelles comptences.    3- La "Value proposition"    Il faut ensuite rdiger sa "value proposition" (ou "unique selling proposition" ou son positionnement produit): le que va faire le produit ?  qui s'adresse t'il ?  quel niveau prix ? ....    La value proposition rsume:  1- Quels sont les bnfices clientque le produit satisfait.  2- A quel cible le produit s'adresse.  3- A quel niveau de prix.    Cette value proposition doit tre communique partout et  tous: communiqu de presse, packaging, cartes de visites, fiches produits...    Il faut bien entendu s'assurer que tous dans l'entreprise ont bien compris ce positionnement.      Plus d'infos avec un guide PDF dtaillant les tapes du plan marketing en cliquant ICI.

This can get you with with limited loss potential (depending on how its priced it might cost you nothing...remember stocks out of bankruptcy have no volatility history so the options premiums are more than normal) and you still have the upside.  Just a thought to get some of that money back that you lost without a lot of risk....sorry to babble.

The principal usually stays constant with Canadian Money Market Funds.  The risk tends to rise with the other fixed income funds (like bonds).  Interest rates fluctuate constantly as does the market value of a bond.  (It can sell under or over par value).  A positive return is what the investor finds the most acceptable.  3% might be fine for some, whereas other persons would like to see 7%+.  You have to read up a bit on the different funds and consult an investment adviser to see what is right for you.  If you click on the fund name in the link below, it will give you an investment objective.  This is how you can see what is right for you:  http://www.tdassetmanagement.com/Content...|`|gi9ixnr8aa	all funds even cash can go up and down. the rate of return can very for different types of bonds.|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	All investments carry risk of loss of value and/or interest.

wrFp66KCaa	No.  Although he has certain lee-way to hold it for a short time (maybe a month), I'm not sure why he'd want to if you never even moved in.  Check your State's laws for when a landlord must return a security deposit, what information you must be given about where it is, and what he must do with the earned interest.  If you don't get it back in the statutory time, you can sue in Small Claims Court, often for 2 or 3 times the amount withheld.    So if you can afford it, play the quiet waiting game then slap him with the biggest law-suit your State allows.    I had a landlord try to illegally withhold part of a security deposit from me.  I took 'em to Court.  I bet they'll never try that one again!|`|AA10578359	It really depends on the renters rights in the state you live in.   However, a security deposit is for repairs and cleaning of an apartment.  If you did not live in the apartment, they cannot just keep your money.  Even if you do live in the apartment, they are only entitled to keep the part of the security deposit that they spent on cleaning and re-painting the apartment.    It is unfortunate that you had to go through that, it is landlords like this one who make people hesitant to go forward and try to live someplace.    Good luck!

pwOBOlYIaa	It would certainly move the country closer to socialism.    As a result of the 1929 crash, SEC was established. Social security was established. It was an idea to prevent another crash. People wanted it. The government wanted it. It's done. Today, we know that social security will go bankrupt. We now know that it was a bad idea. It failed. Yet, this will not stop people from wanting more government controls.    If another 1929 would occur, I think, the government would try to INTERVENE and CONTROL the markets in an even greater way to prevent another crash. The government always wants to grab as much power as they can. Tragedies and catastrophes always help the government to grab more power. Another 1929-like crash would make people want government to take more control, and of course, government would be more than happy to do that. :)    Examples of greater government control include : another wave of drastic increase in government spending, raising the minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich, a public healthcare system maybe (?) and who knows what else...    Internationally, a lot of foreign investors would withdraw their money from US stock market! This would definitely not be good for America right now. Another 1929 crash today would hurt more than many people realize. It would put a seal on America's future. As a result, it would make America more prone to have more and bigger bear markets in the future.    I believe it would mark the beginning of a major downtrend in America's economy.    "Do you believe it would be a great time to invest for young and beginner investors?"    No, I don't think so. Victor Sperandeo, a famous trader, says, "Be an investor in the early stages of bull markets. Be a speculator in the latter stages of bull markets and in bear markets." So, if we had a turning point now, it would be better to be a speculator now. An investor is one who buys and holds his shares. A speculator is one who buys and sells often trying to make small profits on each trade.    The American economy does not need a crash right now.  No, thank you!    See Also:  How will I know that another stock market crash is coming or quite near?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|9qU9ojuDaa	....not.....much.....chance.... of....this.....occuring..../..  invest....now.....please..?|`|19f038c651a2b78d2c6a4c16153c1be6aa	It wouldn't.

This happened a number of years back and all trading was stopped.|`|7AqBiRcwaa	First of all it can't happen because of all the safeguards that are in place... if all else fails to stop the fall then can now shut down the market... AND there aren't that many people buying on margin now with all the new rules.|`|AA10394544	In the 1929 crash everyone was buying on margin or basicly pay 10% value of the stock which people aren't allowed to do today at those percentages.  Also like someone else commmented that if the market dips a certain number of points in a certain time frame then it triggers a market cool off time where no stocks can be traded.

lRFCPigsaa	Mr.Raym sounds correct.|`|gi9ixnr8aa	A High Yield Investment Program, or HYIP, is a type of pyramid scheme-most illegal Ponzi schemes. HYIPs typically accept deposits as low as $1 while promising astoundingly high returns. HYIP schemes rarely last for the long term. New investors provide the cash to pay existing investors a profit that is swiftly withdraw. This approach allows the scam only to continue as long as new investors are found and old investors leave their investment in the scheme-So why do you want in one of these-go get a real job and learn to invest you money to make a real profit.

I have 2 years research in PBLS .(Phoenix Associates)    @ .023 it is the best value in the market.   It is my "AMEX Stock in Penny Clothing"  They have more going than 90% of AMEX listed stocks  Put in a few days minimum research .  (yahoo stock financial page is not correct for PBLS)  The reason that this company is selling for less than .03 cents is because they have not filed in over 20 years..  They have PR'ed that they will file in the next 3 weeks.    This Company has a fuel network called "Best Aeronet"  They fuel business class jets in over 600 airport locations in Canada, US and South America http://www.bestaero.com/    They have a Natural Gas company "ProGas Inc" that does over 200 Million in Revenue per year (profitable)    They have a company that is called "BestJet Engines"'  http://www.bestjets.aero/    BestJets Engines has a multiyear multi million dollar contract with a company called Avail that is subsidiary of Boieng,   BestJet Engines is the "Only" certified GE (General Electric) partner that is authorized to perform the solid respooling of the J-85 and CJ-810 Jet engines used all over the world in 55 countries.(More than 10,000 engines still in service and GE supported till the year 2040)  A few months ago they puchased a test "CELL""platform for these motors costing millions  They have a company called "BestJet Airframes" That purchases Lear 20 and 25 series jets. do a 100% overhaul and install 21st century cockpits and sells them ( you can find the jets on respected Jet net sites selling for millions of dollars)   See my video from inside one of their jets flying at 30,000 and interviewing the CEO of BestJets Mr. Steve Woolsenhulme and President of Phoenix .   Mr. Ron Blackburn (This is one of many companies that Pheonix owns).

The company owns Oil directional drilling companies, oil downhole rig assemblies . WMD equipment, Oil operation inspection companies, has large leases in Wyoming and Nevada Oil leases totalling over 11,000 acres and has already pulled drilling permits for a Wyoming lease.    The Company has an 820 acre gravel, sand and soil pit in close proximity to New Orleans and the Mississippi coast.

yKa3U0YDaa	The stock market is generally more suited to long term investment plans, unless of course you want to become a day trader.    Anthony Robbins used to advocate a system called OPA (Outcome Focused, Purpose Driven, Action Plan) to help you reach your goals.  The name was later changed to RPM.    Anyway what that meant was you first of all had an Outcome (Let us say that your outcome is to grow $10,000 into $5Million over the next 15-20 years)    Purpose Driven.  This is what will make you strive towards your goal, taking all actions, and not getting discouraged.  (This is the dream.  What will you do when/if you had $5M.     This is what will kick start your massive action plan, this is what will give you the energy, the stamina, the belief that it is all worth while)    Finally, the massive action plan.  What it will take for you to reach your goal, your $5M.    Having studied many investment funds, read books, and followed the financial press, you will rarely find anyone (who has a proven track record) that will tell you exactly what stocks to buy, when to buy them, and more importantly when to sell them.    Most Mutual funds fail to beat the market average, so even if you chose Mutual Funds, there is no guarantee of success.    So what can you do?  What is the best way to reach your goal of $5M balancing the amount of risk you are willing to take against the chances of reaching your goal within the next 15-20 years?    Unless you have a crystal ball, all investment systems will lose money some of the time, but a really good system will always have more UP months than Down months, and the UP months will generally return more than the down months will lose.    The one system that I have seen, that has a past record, is achievable, and more importantly is easy to understand is the Stocks Monthly system.|`|200889f13237a420635420e8fc84c04eaa	short term gain- invest in a college education or masters program    long term gain- buy a house, no load s&p 500 fund|`|015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	"Best" depends on your long-term goals, and short-term needs.    One simplified  answer is this:    Money for short term needs (under 3 years) should be placed in a high interst cash account like savings, CD, or money market. you should expect to receive 5-5.3% currently on that money.    Money for long term growth should be placed in a few low cost mutual funds. Total Market, S&P 500 wilshire 4500, etc. these should return 9-12% average over the next decades.    For your long term knowledge, you will have to start reading to educate yourself, or find an advisor to help you.

In order to minimize your expense here, plan ahead.    Pull a free credit report and look at what's on it. If there is anything negative, discuss it with the landlord BEFORE you pay the application fee. They should be able to tell you if anything on your credit will disqualify you. Most landlords are looking for evictions & judgements on credit reports. We don't really care about medical collections, or that you were late on your credit card twice three years ago. If they can't give you an answer, look elsewhere.    If your credit is shockingly bad, you could offer to put down an extra months rent for your securty deposit.     Also, you can look for the smaller rentals that don't charge an application fee or check credit. Look for a small house, or any place with 4 units or less.    Good luck|`|aBJDqwq6aa	What landlords usually look for are evictions and failure to pay rent.  If you don't have those on your credit report, you may not have problems.

015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	You've started in the right place with the newspaper ads.  Ask your friends and current landlord for referalls.    One of the best ways to find a place is to drive around the neighborhoods you want to live in.    Also look in the freebie papers from the local grocery store, (penny saver type) and local bulletin boards.    Contact your local Real Estate Investors association.    If still no luck, look for realtors that advertise property management services.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Some Realtors do property management, some do not.  I'd check in the phone book for property management and go from there.    How about checking some of your local websites, like:    http://www.craigslist.org    Or any free classifieds in your area.|`|Qqz0H2hEaa	In North Texas where I work in Real Estate there is a section of the multiple listing that has rental houses in it but the data is not up to date or complete.    If I wanted to find a house to rent I would look in the paper (like you did) and I would call three or four rental management companies asking for information.  I would also drive thru neighborhoods that I want to live in and see what signs may be up.  (I own a few rental homes and rarely advertise because they seem to rent as soon as I put my sign up).|`|Q8t3ofKkaa	It is hard to believe there wasn't anything in the paper.  You could check with a Realtor.  Some landlords do use them to manage their properties.       I am a landlord, by the way.  But, before you decide to take a place and sign a lease, check him/her out---they do you.  Check with your local city/town/village government.  See if they have had any code violations, or are delinquent in their taxes.  This can tell you a lot about how they care for the property and will respond to problems you may have.  If you can find a present or former tenant of theirs, that also helps to know about them.    You can also try to do an Internet search.  Just put +"house for rent" +"[your town name]"  By putting it in that way you limit your search to pages that only contain the words "house for rent" and the name of your town.|`|A6FDX1MFaa	Unless you live in a very small town you should be able to find help on www.realtor.com just check under rentals. If you not find what you are looking for contact one of the agents in your area from realtor.com and ask them to email you as soon as something comes on the market.|`|9fQ0E3RRaa	I think craigslist could do wonders for you.  It's becoming a great database for rentals, and you can narrow the search to show homes only in your specified area at your price range...|`|lBfNhgwsaa	It's quite possible there aren't a lot of rental homes in your area. At least in my area (southern NH) there aren't many. Investors don't buy single family homes here to rent them - the homes are too expensive and there isn't any profit in it. Home owners typically only rent a home when they have trouble selling it and they have already moved to another home. Because of the high cost of homes the rents need to be fairly high to cover mortgage and expenses, and I find most people that call me looking to rent a home aren't willing or able to pay those prices.    A lot of agents don't like to deal with rental because there is too little money involved. A lot of times I may take someone out to see a few rentals but they end up finding something on their own and I make nothing (but still spend time and money on gas and other expenses). Even if they do rent I make just a couple of hundred dollars. I don't turn anyone away because they are a renter, but I don't go out of my way to look for them either.    If you can find a local real estate agency that does advertise some rentals then give them a call and see if they have others, or if they can find some in the MLS (multiple listing service). You may have to call around to several places before you find someone that is really willing to spend a lot of time with you.
6dbc0a3db570380276e5d0eb26477e0aaa	Bonjour, nous venons de vendre l'appartement de mon ami et acheter une maison ensemble. Voil les conseils que je peux te donner :    Promesse de vente : si tu passes par agence tu la signeras chez eux, le document est rdig par eux. Si tu passes par particulier, il faut vraiment prendre un notaire, car il y a plein de choses  savoir, trs importantes, sinon ?a peut vraiment te mettre dans la m....   Mme en signant la promesse par agence, je te conseille vivement de prendre un notaire, et un bon ce qui est rare. Sache que les notaires ont un devoir de conseil. Si le vendeur a dj un notaire, tu peux en prendre un autre, ils se partagent les frais entre eux, toi, tu ne payes qu'une fois.  Ex perso pour notre maison : nous avons sign la promesse dbut mars,  l'agence immo pour avoir la maison disponible  fin juillet (souhait des vendeurs). En gnral, la clause par rapport  l'obtention de ton prt dit que tu dois justifier avoir fait des simulations dans des banques dans les 15j  compter de la signature de la promesse. Et que ton prt doit tre accord dans les 30 ou 45 jours. Ce qui est court comme dlais tu le verras, tu vas devoir courir partout en peu de temps. Vu le dlai entre mars et juillet, notre notaire nous a ngoci 60j pour les simulations et 90j pour l'obtention du prt, nous avons donc pu tudier ?a tranquillement, sans nous hater. L'agence tait pas pour, mais y'avait pas de raison qu'ils disent non vu qu'il y a 5 mois entre la promesse et l'acte.  Egalement, pour tre certains d'avoir la maison  fin juillet, nous avons fait rajouter une clause de pnalit (sache que si on met des dates, ?a n'est pas pour faire joli, il faut vraiment les respecter). Signature de l'acte authentique prvu au 1/08/07 en cas de retard, pnalits qui nous seront d?es par jour de retard. c'est la notaire qui nous l'a conseill.  Le dp?t de garantie que tu verses peut tre de 5 ou 10%. Nous quand on a sign, on a donn que 500euros car on avait pas encore vendu l'appart et on avait pas de sous. l'agence a dit ok, mais c'est encore la notaire qui s'est battue pour nous, l'agence ralait.    Donc nous avons obtenu notre prt qu'on commencera  payer au 1/08/07. Mais, maintenant que notre prt est accord, nous payons depuis 1 mois l'assurance dcs invalidit. c'est  dire que si mon ami ou moi, dcde avant le 1/08/07, la maison est paye. Ca c'est la banque qui doit t'expliquer tout ?a.    Le notaire : je sais pas si tu achtes seule ou en couple, si vous tes maris, pacs ou rien. si tu as de l'apport ou pas... le notaire doit te renseigner en cas de sparation, dcs... comment ?a se passe si un jour ?a va mal.    Pourquoi ne pas prendre le notaire de tes vendeurs ? Parce qu'il dfend LEURS intrts, et que s'il est mauvais, et bien t'auras un notaire mauvais... c dommage    Pourquoi je pense qu'il faut se mfier des notaires ? je travaille avec eux dans mon mtier, et je peux t'assurer que c un mtier de privilges, bien qu'ils aient un devoir de conseils etc. il faut leur courir prs, leur tirer les vers du nez quand t'as des questions, il font  moiti leur boulot et j'ai nombre d'exemples de vente qui ont t reportes etc  cause d'un papier manquant ou autre... c'est chiant, surtout quand tu ne connais rien  tout ?a. donc mfiance mfiance. Evite les vieux, et prend plut?t un jeune, dynamique qui vient d'tre nouvellement associ. il voudra se faire sa clientle, et c'est connu, quand les gens sont pas contents, il reviennent pas !    Voil en gros, j'avoue que je suis bien renseigne  prsent car on arrive au bout, je suis bien chaude, donc si tu as des questions, mme si elles te semblent btes, n'hsite pas  m'crire ! Bonne continuation|`|daIdwg7Taa	Le r?le du banquier sera de financer votre achat selon les conditions qui seront prvues dans une promesse de vente ou un compromis de vente ; si vous achetez de particulier  particulier, le plus simple sera sans doute de signer, avec le vendeur, une promesse chez un notaire ; si vous passez par un agent immobilier, il s'agira plut?t d'un compromis de vente ; les 2 documents contiennent les mmes lments. Dans les 2 cas, l'acompte (ou dp?t de garantie) correspond, au maximum,  10% du prix de vente ; il peut donc tre infrieur. Concernant le financement, le recours  un courtier peut s'avrer intressant ( condition d'tre prt  changer de banque)|`|c48328e082673fe2b0d2c61f46ee87f6aa	Si tu y vas avec un agent immobilier , c'est un formulaire bien prcis qu'ils utilisent , tout est ngociable mais c'est parfois difficile|`|bba418875e054650267a646930d80100aa	En ralit, ca se passe comme ca :   Tu visite une maison qui te plait, tu decide de l'acheter, alors a l'agence (ou devant un notaire si elle est en pap) tu signe la promesse de vente, effectivement tu verse en gros 10 % mais le taux est negociable, c'est comme une assurance pour que le vendeur ne puisse plus le vender a quelqun d'autres.  A partir de ce jour tu as 15 jours pour amener a l'agence une demande de pret (c'est un papier que n'importe quel banque te remet lorsque tu fais la demande d'un pret) mais voila ce n'est pas parce que tu as sign que la maison te reviens, en fait tu as lors de la promesse de vente une condition suspensiva c'est la seule condition pour que tu ne perde pas las 10 % que tu as vers, cette condition c'est le pret voila car aucune banque n'est oblig de t'acord un pret.  A partir de la signature tu as 45 jours pour trouver un accord de pret!  Si tu decide par exemple que tu n'en veux plus alors que la promesse est sign tu perdra tes 10 %, c'est pour cela qu'il faut bien reflechir et qu'une promesse est un vrai engagement!  Je ne sais pas si j'ai t clair si tu veux plus d'info ecris moi|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Attention la promesse de vente est une vente.    En cas de non respect tu peux perdre l'argent avanc. Lire attentivement le contrat de la promesse avant de le signer.|`|i7VVb8lnaa	La promesse de vente quivaut au compromis de vente sign chez le notaire ou dans une agence immobiliere. La signature d'un compromis permet de gagner du temps, en principe si une maison vous plait, vous signez un compromis 2 jours aprs chez une agence, mais chez un notaire le dlai sera un peu plus long et le bien risquerait de vous passer sous le nez.    Les lettres sous seing priv ne se font plus, mieux vaut passer par une agence ou un notaire si il n'y a pas d'agence.    A la signature du compromis, il faut en principe verser 10 % du prix de vente. Cependant, par exemple pour mon cas, je n'ai vers que 400 euros, meme pas 1% car cela se ngocie avec le vendeur, en principe ils acceptent tous. Pour que cela fonctionne il faut s'engager, je m'explique :  Vous ne versez que 400 euros pour permettre au notaire de payer les premiers frais de demande de formalit (certificat d'urbanisme ...), et en plus vous faites une lettre comme quoi vous vous engagez  payer 10 % du prix si vous vous dsistez pour l'achat alors que la banque vous accepte le pret. Si la banque n'accepte pas le pret, vous ne payerez pas evidemment les 10 %    J'espre que j'ai t claire.    Si vous avez d'autres questions n'hsitez pas.    Deplus, vous pouvez prendre votre notaire ou alors choisir le notaire des vendeurs. En principe, j'ai toujours refus de prendre 2 notaires car tout d'abord, je n'ai pas de notaire prfr et de plus le proccessus est ralenti car pour la signature du compromis et de l'acte final (dit authentique) tout le monde doit se runir et les notaires sont trs surchargs.    Deplus les honoraires varient entre les notaires, il est intressant d'appeler 3/4 notaires et de leur demander combien ils prennent d'honoraires par exemple pour 160 000 euros. Et la il y a souvent de bonnes surprises .... des diffrences parfois de 800 euros. ?a vaut le coup non ?

etuedQE3aa	I worked at Bank of America as a teller 2 years ago and worked my way up.      There are times where I hated it but stuck it out because the people there made my time more enjoyable.  There is def. tons of room for advancement and you learn alot about banking and finance which will help you out in the long run for finance careers.  What I didn't like were the mean, picky customers, how repetitive it can get during high traffic times and balancing your cash can.      The difficult part I'd say is balancing your can.  It's an easy thing to do but once you start getting the hang of it and working more quickly, you need to REALLY pay attention to what you're doing, otherwise, it'll screw you up in the end.      Overall, I'd say that it was a good experience.  You do have the bad days and also the good but thats with every job.    Good luck!|`|AA12392814	I worked for B of A back in the late 80's.

Add all the following to the 10K of your belongings: A medium grade condo kitchen can cost $40,000. to replace in the DC area. That would include cabinets, counter tops, sink, faucets, stove, dishwasher, refrigerator. Also, you would have to replace all bathroom fixtures and tile, all drywall for the whole condo, electrical wiring, outlets, switches, carpeting or hardwood, ceiling fans, etc. There is a lot involved. Please call a reputable insurance agency and get a quote. I have always used State Farm and have been very happy with them. I had two claims in the past 20 years and they were great. Good luck finding a condo for 200K in Northern Va or DC. I'm a native and in my neck of the woods things run a lot higher than that, even for a one bedroom.
50ebd67ec62a5f9fa50210cefc9794f1aa	Parce que le syndicalisme a t dnatur. A la base, les ouvriers se rassemblaient pour faire front par rapport  leur employeur qui les exploitait. C'tait un rapport de force qui  fait avancer tout de mme beaucoup de chose. Et puis les gens taient malheureux, ils n'avaient pas grand chose  perdre alors, ils avaient le go?t de se battre.   Actuellement, ou se trouve principalement les syndicats ? dans la fonction publique ou le rapport de force n'existe plus puisque la grve gne surout les usagers qui n'ont pas franchement le pouvoir de quoi que ce soit ! Il faut trouver rapidement des modes d'action plus d'actualit, moins corporatives et si possible europennes voire plus !   Mais n'oublions pas qu'un syndicat, ce n'est pas 1 ou plusieurs personnes avec un mandat syndical, c'est la responsabilit de tout le personnel dans l'entreprise. Il est si facile de raler tout le temps et de ne rien faire le moment venu. Un syndicat, c'est tous ensemble, sinon ce n'est rien. Tout le monde connait la maxime "l'union fait la force". Et bien ce devrait tre cela un syndicat. Malheureusement, on est plus sur le mode individualiste... "je m'en sorts pas trop mal, que les autres se dbrouillent" et puis un jour : le ppin et l, tonnement : "eh, les copins... vous tes o, je suis dans la m....." et tout  coup c'est le grand vide.

4MypYVHYaa	Since you are set on selling this property to your friend, and you want to protect yourself and your friend.    You should draw up a contract with the complete sales price, If there will be a down payment, you will want this to be in the contract.    Once you have determined the sales price, subtract the amount you currently owe on your mortgage as well as any down payment paid you. This will be the mortgage amount you will carry.    How much interest rate you plan to charge your friend. When you expect this contract to end, normally anywhere from 3-5 years. You can amortize your note for 30 years all due and payable in 3-5 years or whatever you decide, it could be 10 years.    Upon completition of the 3-5 years he may refinance and pay you as well as your current mortgage company.    Once this has been done, take your current monthly mortgage and the monthly mortgage note for the mortgage you will carry. This will now become your friends monthly mortgage payment.    Once you get the monthly payment from your friend, send your current mortgage lender what is due him. The rest belongs to you.    Once this contract is drawn up you should take this contract to a closing agent or escrow, where they will prepare escrow instructions for you and your friend to sign, sort of like a reinforcement of your contract.    The escrow closing agent will set up a title company to record the necessary deeds, thus your friend will now own the home and will have to pay his own taxes and insutance.  Make sure the insurance policy list you as a loss payee on the insurance policy. You will want to have your current mortgage company listed also. Look at your current insurance policy to find out the loss payee for your current mortgage company.    You might tell your friend that failing to keep the mortgage, insurance and taxes current is reason for you to foreclose on your property and insure him that you will.     If foreclosure becomes necessary there are firms that handle this type transaction in your city. You will need to find one. They will charge you a fee but it is normally collected throught the borrower or your freind or paid after the foreclosure sale.    Using this method he owns the home with all that goes with it, to include him paying the taxes,insurances and doing all the repairs of home ownership.    You get a monthly payment each month and can legally foreclose on him if he fails to make the monthly payment or pay his taxes or insurance.    I hope this has been of some use to you,good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	First question. Is the divorce final?    If the divorce is final, use a local title company or attorney to help you draft an agreement. (Land Contract or contract for deed)    If the divorce is NOT final, let him lease the property and do the agreement after the divorce is final. If you do anything that gives ownership rights while the divorce in ongoing, dowers rights and dividing mutual assets can cause both of you unintended consequences.
5LJUdnwuaa	Maggie,  a couple of weeks ago I answered your question on how much to bid at a foreclosure auction. I gave a longwinded formula in order to help you understand the mechanics, and I won't repeat it here now because we can jump to "rule of thumb" which I and others use for in buy, rehab and flip.    Take the ARV see note 1) of the prospective property and multiply by 65/70/75% (see note 2) less the costs of the repairs, and this is your maximum offer.    Note 1.The After Rehab value should be the best price you can get for your fixed up property ready to resell. Don't use averages, use comps of all sales in the last 6 months say within a radius of a mile from your location, you can use a reputable database & listing service for this or ask your realtor.   Note2. This factor depends on how much profit you haveset as a goal for your investment. For example, if you want a minimum of 15%, choose 70%. The remaining 15% is to cover your buying/holding/selling  costs to resale. This is the formula one of your other answers refers to, but make sure you use the correct MV.|`|015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	Simplest formula is     Max offer = 70% of the retail sale price - needed repairs|`|6iGdksOXaa	check:: www.rockypointdirectory.com

uMAgjiIbaa	Well honestly I have been there and done that. For 9 mo. my family lived in the Texas Hill Country on 3 acres of undevloped land years ago. We lived in tents. Built an out house by digging the deepest hole we could and hanging tarps around it. For a shower we used one of those camping showers and boiled water we brought from the city on a camp fire. They sell powder milk which keeps without a frig. just mix with water. It is not fun, but sometimes you do what you have to do.

You might be better going with a larger pharmaceutical company like Merck, Glaxo, Novartis, etc.   Without alot of products to market, you will get frustrated because sales bonuses are based on product line and $$ of sales.

There is no fee for setting up a new account.    Once you get paid by your customer the funds are available in your Pay Pal account immediately.  You can have the funds transferred to your own checking account.  Pay Pal does not charge you for it but it takes several days.  You can also get a free Pay Pal debit card that allows you to shop anywhere instantly or withdraw funds from any ATM immediately.    Pay Pal charges you 2.9% plus a 30 cent transaction fee each time you receive money from a buyer.     You will need to verify your checking account with Pay Pal in order to receive money as a seller.  The procedure is very simple.   They will make 2 small deposits into your checking account.  They you reply to their inquiry and tell them the exact amounts of the deposits.    Once you do, you will be verified and will be eligible to receive funds as a seller.  .|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	yes you will have to setup a paypal account ,so the funds can be transfereed to your checking account  and you can get a card that you use like an debit card anywhere   its really worth it too ,makes things to much easier  you get your money really fast this way  you can use it lots of places online too

Also, take into account if you are renting or part of a homeowner's association they usually have stipulations about having consumers coming to your home for business. In Los Angeles County it is illegal to prepare food for sale in a residential kitchen regardless of equipment. In other states/cities the regulations are less strict (e.g. if you have a second kitchen in your home designated for purely commercial use you can prepare food for sale there). A good place to start looking would be googling "Department of Health *insert state name here*" and try to find a site with an official ".gov" ending. It is tough reading all the regulatory mumbo jumbo but it is necessary if you cannot afford a lawyer to do it for you and you dont want to expose your new business to a potentially fatal mistake.

When the time gets closer, work with your lender on current programs, and timing your rate lock.|`|FXyKysyPaa	I have changed my mindset to be less concerned about rates, and more concerned about paying down my loan as quickly as possible, without losing the flexibility of a Home Equity Line of Credit, and I have found it with the "Home Ownership Accelerator", available in Kansas.    This new financial instrument has been in use in Australia and the UK since the early 90s, and is now available here.    Here are the basics:    In a nutshell, it's a 1st Home Equity Loan (no 2nd Home Equity Loan Required), is serviced by a new checking account by GMAC, which has tremendous benefits if you qualify...many people don't due to the requirements, but if you already qualify for a fixed loan and it fits your objectives, it can't be beat.    How does it work?    Instead of depositing your paychecks or business income into a low interest bank account, they are deposited directly into your new line of credit, immediately reducing your principle balance on the loan. You always have access to these funds just like your normal checking account for paying your monthly expenses and your daily needs via ATM Card or check, Visa Point of Sale and of course online bill pay. The beauty of it is that you don't have to change your spending habits to gain the following benefits:    1. Save thousands in interest every year.     Because your income flows directly into the loan account, your principle balance is reduced IMMEDIATELY until the funds are needed for expenes. As a result, your daily principle balance is less, which can save thousands in interest. With every dollar deposited, instead of "earning" 1% in a low interest bank account, you are saving about 6% in mortgage interest!    2. Builds equity faster.      Because less of your money is consumed in interest, more can go towards paying down the principal each month. If you have a pretty typical income with good cash flow every month you will pay off an average loan in 1/2 the time of a traditional loan, WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR SPENDING HABITS!    3. Access to equity.      You always have full access to the funds available in your loan account up to your credit limit for any purpose, such as buying a car, paying taxes, tuition, or if you're like me...for investments. Meanwhile, until you need the money, those funds are working for you every day to save interest, leaving more income available to pay down principal.    This loan is not for everybody but works well for people with decent income or small to midsize business owners who want to free up cash for conventional investment or for people who want to begin investing in real estate, and this is a good time to find opportunities.  The loan is best for people who have positive cash flow every month (savers). If you can qualify for a 30 year fixed mortgage, you will likely qualify for this loan.     What's most impressive is that to achieve a similar interest rate in a conventional fixed loan, you would have to be in the 2-4% range to equal the performance of this loan...which does not and will not exist except in this unique product.    I will send you a video link if you wish to email me, which explains it in full.  Imagine paying off your loan in 12 -15 years without changing your spending habits, or paying it down so fast that in 5-7 years you have enough equity growth to buy another property for investment, or if like so many people you wish to move, you will have a much larger equity position than a 30 year fixed loan for that next move.    If you have the ability I always recomend buying down a loan as long as you know your payback period to recover the buy-down and the loan origination fees. This loan can be bought all the way down to 3/4 over the index...which 90% of the clients do.    Beware of YSP and/or rebates that are actually hidden interest rate increases for the life of your loan, and you should never have YSP.rebates on a loan that you buy down. Instead pay the broker origination fees up front to reduce your APR, and to see exactly what you're paying your lender for the loan.    Also be aware of the fact that banks and direct lenders, as well as brokers who lend their own money do not have to disclose the YSP, and some will actually lie to you about it.    If you want to learn more about this amazing new loan which is the last loan you'll ever need on your home, please feel free to contact me and I will send you the link.

If you simply don't have enough work to occupy your time, that's not your fault.  They are paying you for the work you complete.    That being said, you can do something about it.  Ask for more responsibility.  But why would you that if you're leaving anyway?  Well, that's a good question.  You're going to get a good recommendation anyway, so it may not matter much.  But, it would probably be good to hone your skills and get back into the groove of working hard all the time before you start your next job.  Otherwise, you may be in for a shock when you have too much work and not enough time.    If you're gonna be at the job, you might as well find as much work to do as you can.

umMyGgKJaa	I can only answer for myself, as to what makes me choose to buy from certain eBay auctions.  There are, though, a few simple rules that will make me choose to look at some auctions and ignore others.  I'm just a private individual and I have over a 500 feedback rating, 100% positive, so I know a little bit about it!    1.   No Reserve.  If there is a reserve price, I move on to the next item.  If there's no reserve, say so in the first line description.  One exception would be with a car, of which I have bought four on eBay.    2.  Pictures.  I will buy almost nothing if I can't see a picture of it.    3.   Honesty.  If there's something wrong with the thing that you're selling, say so up front.  If you point out what's wrong, then I am more likely to believe that that's ALL that's wrong.    4.   Low starting bid.  I've seen many products for sale on eBay where the starting bid is already higher than what I would pay if I walked down to the local store to get the item.  I'm on eBay looking for bargains, not to pay too much for the same item I could get cheaper at home.    5.   Reasonable shipping prices.  I understand that shipping the item requires your time and materials, but I've had instances where I paid more than $10.00 for shipping and the actual postage on the item was around $2.00.  That's too much profit in the shipping area.  You should make your profit on the item, not on the shipping.    6.   Make payment simple.  Once I start reading in an auction that I have to use their own checkout system, or something more elaborate and complicated than PayPal, I move on.    7.   Offer a Buy-it-Now price.  Sometimes when I find the perfect thing, I'm willing to just pay for it and be done.  Why wait six days when I'm willing to pay your price right now?    Hope this helps!|`|fe1a69ec9fc7fb7631a59c2ecba7dccdaa	Do you have a store?  Once you have a store you can promote it in the search engines and through PayPal stores.  It is just like any other website as far as promotion goes.      Also, do you occasionally list items at low prices to reach the top of the search?  Do you cross-list your items in your auctions (place actual links to similar auctions in your html for each auction)?|`|nrTAXImQaa	If you trade a lot on Ebay I can highly recommend a course that will answer all your Ebay questions. Just reply and I'll send the link on.|`|AA12200158	try to look for similar items you are selling and contact the highest bidder to let them know that you have a similar item...|`|qdE9hMIxaa	I will only buy from someone on ebay if:    1.  They have reasonable shipping prices  2.  They are selling something I want to buy  3.  There isn't a reserve  4.  They have good feedback (I usually won't buy from anyone with fewer that 20 positive feedback and their percentage can't be fewer than 98%)  5.  Low starting price (prices based on item of course)    Generally those are the standards that I and the people that I know happen to follow, others may have different opinions.  Also you have to remember that many people (like myself) just watch the item and bid on it at the very last seconds.    Take a look at the listings that you have and see if any of those reasons are applicable to your items and that may be part of the issue.|`|hwVYB84Haa	You won't have any problems getting bids if you are selling quality merchandise which is which is wanted by others for a reasonable price with shipping.    Don't expect the bidding to be active until the last couple hours of your auction, That's when it really gets going and usually in the last few minutes in higher dollar (or higher sought after) items    If you have received no bids on your items, search the same items listed in Completed auctions and see if they have been sold recently and how much they brought and do your research as to how to list it and which category.    I research completed items all the time to see if certain items sell better then others as I want to make sure it goes.    I also have an EBay store where it cost a small charge to list an item and a monthly fee and the listing is for 30 day increments. and the store items are promoted at the bottom of the active auctions.

And since there is a potential conflict of interest, you should probably inform the client(s) involved of your affiliations.    I work for the most innovative real estate company in the country (according to Inman News Service) in Washington State.  We have agents who are both Realtors and Mortgage brokers and until recently, they were allowed to do both with proper notice to the principals.  Our company has recently changed that and is asking agents to focus on one or the other.     Either way, remember your fiduciary duty is to the principals you represent and you should be fine.|`|ae35bd9cf31fef968c2f69200ac87ae0aa	You can be agent and do the mortgage but you should not do the insurance and you will need a separate title attorney.

Just be careful about WHAT you're getting into. Some plans, because of their higher APR rates get you into more trouble than you were.     Also, some lenders look poorly upon it later on. Some institutions believe that it really is a black mark. It will depend upon the types of deals that your particular company or lender work out, and of course, your own individual circumstance. For some with absolutely NO way out, debt consolidation is a welcome option.    Take a good hard look at all the options and plans offered, and don't let a single company pressure you into something you just can't do. Make sure that you're comfortable with the plan offered before you commit to it.    In any case, it doesn't hurt to investigate debt consolidation as an option. It doesn't cost you anything to find out more information about it.    If you want a place to start your investigating, there's information and listings for debt consolidation providers on the page listed below. You'll probably find something of use there:    http://axalda.info/debt-consolidation.ht...|`|051a61ff84da1eaf6e18e92cfc44ba4eaa	a consolidation wont do no good if ya just gonna go load up some more credit cards.

Equity of your home is calculated and determined by the difference in the amount you have paid and the amount you owe. If the amount you have paid is more than the amount due, you can use it as collateral. This allows you to borrow money on lower interest rates. Besides, you also get tax benefit on this type of loan. Consult your tax advisor before opting for this loan.
015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	First, get preapproved for a mortgage, and make sure the payments fit into your budget. Normally you want to keep them about what you've been paying for rent, preferably a little less.    Next, you can look for a home on your own, or with an agent.     Third, Regardless of how you find a home, get your own Home Inspection done. It'll be the best $300 (or so) you spend on buying a home. This will take care of all the home questions for you.    Fourth, visit the neighborhood a few times at different times of the day, and especially on Fri and Sat night / eve.    Finally, look at the layout of the home, and your lifestyle. Do they match?

AA10684228	Yes, you may use only one of your credit ratings to apply for a mortgage (and buy a home.)  The problem with that is that you can only use that person's income, however.  So if he has adequate good credit, and adequate income, you are okay.  If you exclude your credit--you have to exclude your income too.  Under almost any scenario, your down-payment (which your income could provide) would HAVE to be 5% of the final purchase price, SHOULD be 10%, and you'd save the PMI (Mortgage Premium Insurance) if you could get it to 20%.  Pay down credit cards--but a few open.  Pay off cars.  Pay all your bills timely.  Start saving aggressively (all your income, if possible.)  Your house payment should be no more than 25% of his total income.  (But the mortgage company will allow you to borrow more than you should--they'd allow a 32% ratio of house payment: Principal, interest, insurance and taxes.)    Don't even consider this until you've got a 10% down payment, or you are asking for financial problems if either of you loses their job for any reason.|`|45ec43f79ebd683fe1959f18db964e0daa	You can use just his credit score, but then usually only his income will be considered as well. One way to help with that is to have as many expenses and debts that you both have transferred to you exclusively, but that may not be possible given your credit situation. Your down payment will be a product of his credit rating and debt to income ratio. Poorer credit and high debt to income will generally require a higher down payment. Besides clearing his credit , the best thing you can do is save money for a down payment and buy a house when it makes sense monetarily rather than when it first becomes possible. Somebody might write you a loan right now, especially with a big enough down payment, but that doesn't mean it would be a good idea.|`|5053f91f5a9b687607c0bae8d3ff12d5aa	Yes, it is very possible! if your husband is the only one qualifying for a loan they will only go on his income and credit score.So instead of qualifying for a loan at 100,000 a year they would only go on what your husband makes,lets say,50,000 a year.The down payment depends on what type of loan you are getting.If your husband is a vetran he can get a VA loan they do not require a down payment.There is FHA I believe they require at least 3% of the selling price,plus closing cost.A Conventional loan is usually a little more.I believe 5% and up,plus closing cost.You can also offer the seller more than there asking price if they pay the closing cost.Goodluck!|`|NJfnqdF8aa	It's perfectly ok to have the loan done in only his name. That will limit you on how much of a house you can buy since they'd now be looking at only his income to qualify you. The down payment will vary, but with more down, the better off you will be. Perhaps you could also be put on the loan depending on your score and some other factors to do with your credit. Understand though that your interest rates will be higher, if you're a higher risk|`|zeN0qA0laa	I'm a REALTOR? and Senior Loan Officer in Northern California and yes, there are options available for you .

If they aren't interested because of your situation, I'll be happy to point you in the right direction.    Hope this helps! Good luck.

It's the terms of the agreement that matter.    eg A typical purchase agreement just says you've agreed to buy, and doesn't effect your taxes until you do something with the agreement.    Is it ownership, investment or lending?    If ownership, are you occuping the property?
de5926afee215d6ac06a65320b0cca1baa	If you take a loan and it is defaulted you have to pay taxes on it and possibly a penalty for early withdraw.  The 27k will be removed from your balance for the loan. As it repays your balance may go back up pending on investments.    You can roll over your 401k at your new job and continue to make payments on the loan if they support such a program.|`|8c44cac7a547e9bbb2bfa16207440753aa	With most 401K plans, if you leave your current employer your loan become fully due within about 60 days! Check the terms of your 401K plan with the administrator. Be sure you get it in writing how long after you leave you have to pay off the loan.    Yes, if the loan is not paid off it is considered a withdraw which will be taxed as ordinary income rates plus 10% (of the TOTAL withdrawn) if you are not yet 59 ?.|`|rUO0BcNoaa	When you take the loan out, you reduce the balance of the account by $27,000.  As you make payments, you're adding the principal and interest payments back to the balance.    I assume it's different for every plan, but my company requires that any outstanding loans be repaid within 30 days of termination.  Any unpaid balance is considered a distribution, and you'll pay VERY hefty taxes as well as penalties on it.      My advice is that you should be very cautious when considering a 401(k) loan, and you should not even consider it if there's a chance of having to take part of it as a taxable distribution.|`|gwFWMF3Yaa	You'll still have the additional 30k.  But you'll also have a tax bill of at least 8k so be prepared for it.  BTW if you leaving your job to go to a new one and they have a 401k with a loan program...might want to see if they'll accept a rollover loan.  It's legal and a way to avoid the tax and accompanying 10% penalty.    You'll have to roll your entire balance in but it would be worth it to avoid the decimation to your retirement account.    Assuming your in your late 20's or early 30's that 30k that you would take as a distribution would cost you over 250k at age 67.  Hardly worth it is it?   Make the effort to see if they'll accept the rollover.

015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	You may need to clarify your question.    In short -   I RE license permits you to represent others during a buy & sell. It also allows you to receive a commission for the transaction.    If you are one of the investors, or an employee, no license required. You may want to use an agent though.    My opinion: If you are a partial owner of the RE or an employee of the investors, do not get the license.  If you are trying to get a "finders fee" (eg commission) you should be licensed.    Mortgage loans are unrelated to a RE license, and are regulated seperately. again, if you are not an owner on the transaction, you probably need a license.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You can get a loan.

If you're an investor, then you don't.  Be careful as you do not want to be caught practicing real estate without a license.    Even if you are formally getting compensated by your own investors, you'd be breaking the law without a state issued real estate license (it doesn't matter if compensation comes from buyer or seller).      Beyond all that, there's really not all that many restrictions.  As long as all parties acknowledge in writing that you're a licensee representing your investors, you'll be fine.  The restrictions are basically making sure you deal fairly with all parties, protect your clients interest, behave honestly, and abide by the REALTOR code of ethics (a good idea anyway)

015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	Personally I like the mass move out answer.     Practically and legally though, you will need to file an eviction with the court. That's assuming she has established residency (mail, address, etc) you will have to do an eviction. You'd likely have to do it anyway if there is no other place she calls home.    It will work the same as any landlord/tenant eviction.    It sound like you may need to do the domestic violence report or at least get a personal protection order. The PPO would keep her out while you do a formal eviction.|`|YwkpgTNlaa	ok, i am not real familiar w cali laws, but in a lot of states, if she has proven residency ( mail, lots of stuff there) that is as good as a lease, so you either have to go through the courts and have her evicted like a landlord would, fees and all, or find some way to get all proof of her living w you gone and then call the cops to have her removed    does your landlord know that she is there? if not, if he happens to be cool, you could have him write an 'official' letter asking her to get  out    or you could just wait till she is going to be out for a while, have a LOT of people come over and move all her stuff out, then when she 'claims' domestic, you will have a ton of witnesses that she is full of it

You are still on hook for the lease, but the landlord must make a reasonable effort to fill the unit. When the unit is rented your obligation ends.    Expect to lose the deposit, but if you leave the place really clean and do everything else, the landlord probably won't pursue the rest.    It beats the landlord going through eviction.

I don't know enough about bedbugs to say if they migrate from unit to unit.|`|cb10962051c0fa6ecaf09ca46640883faa	Move to another apartment and they will move with you... no doubt about that.    I had bed bugs in my own home and got rid of them long time ago.    You have 2 options...  1. get an expensive exterminator that will not warranty you 100% to eliminate the problem.    2. Eliminate the problem yourself cheaply but with its side effects like i did.    The secret: "Diatomaceous earth"  Get the 4 pounds bags (Concern brand) from Amazon at 9 dollars. Get 2 of them.    This product is not toxic, you could actually put some in the food and nothing is going to happen.    Just wear a dust mask when you spread the powder as it is very fine and dry... otherwise you get your respiratory tract very dry or your lungs irritated.   So spread the powder in fine "puffs" all around the bed, crevices in all your furniture, closet, entire room, carpet, small cracks in your bed's wood, EVERYWHERE, specially the places that you frequent the most in your home.    I used a big plastic bottle with a cone tip so just squeeze the bottle to create a cloud of powder that takes a while to completelly fall and set in place.    Now inspect every inch of your mattress for the bug... find pictures of the bug in Google if you don't know how it looks like. The name of this bug is Cimex Lectarius. Just kill them like a roach using some gloves or paper. They actually stink a bitter odor.    These bugs can live without food (your blood) for about 6 months... so make sure you have your diatomaceous earth covering all the place for a long time.  The powder works because it is a mechanical killer. Bugs can't create an hinmune system to it.  The powder is kind of microscopic glass that gets stick to the bugs, and it absorbs moisture, drying them to death.  You can test it by putting a little bit of powder in a glass cup and some bugs alive... in about 48 hours they desecate to death.    The powder must be always dry or it wont work. So keep your home dry all the time... clean the powder and spray new one every once in a while.     Put a lot of powder in the mattress.... A LOT. it will not get you or your pets intoxicated. I actually worked the powder into the mattress with my hands to make sure that any bug walking by to reach my juicy blood, will get really covered in powder and die soon.    So this works 100% believe me. Now my home is free of these bastards.    The problem is to clean the powder later.... it is so fine that is difficult to clean it out.... it takes time. The vacuum filter gets dirty very fast, so you have to clean it over and over again.    Remember... these bugs are where humans are... they don't pick homes because the amount of filth in it, like roaches do. They can be in the cleanest house.    Do not mistake the kind of diatomaceous earth sold at the cleaning pool supplies shop... it is different. get the one i told you before.    I know it is a hard solution living with the white powder around for months... but it just works. Other people are giving up in their fight to kill the bugs, and the bugs just move with them to the new place hiding in the furniture and lugage.     Good luck!
fc3810ac6d84915ab51656e9267dc18aaa	Great question and great timing.     Although there is no official regulatory agency that has hold of the reigns of the "spot Forex" marketplace the NFA (National Futures Association) has regulatory responsibility for the "Forex futures" market.  Since the "spot Forex" market is currently resembling the wild west with some questionable players popping up every day a number of Forex brokers are establishing processes so as to be "compliant with NFA policies and regulations".    There are current rumors that the NFA will soon require a certain level of financial stability and available funds so that brokers are able to support their operations during irregular markets. Currently a broker can simply close up shop and sail into the sunset with whatever money they can.    A Forex colleague of mine has shared with us a government report indicating the financial stability of 170 Forex brokerages. The consensous seems to be that the NFA will require $5M in available funds within the next couple of months and up to $9M by the end of the year.

Then also ask if there are any new homebuyers or 1st time buyer programs you will be elgible for.

A Mortgage Broker rarely charges a fee, as they are paid by the lending institution.  A Mortgage Specialist will walk the borrower through the application and approval process, understanding all the hidden policies that the banks have, and help to protect the borrower from making a wrong decision and ensuring that all options are made available to them.   Banks will not tell you the differences between their bank and others, whereas a Mortgage Specialist has no vested interest in any one bank, and will compare the rates, products, and services of different banks, trust companies and other lending institutions to get you the best mortgage possible for your situation. Broker's can discount the posted rates at chartered banks on any given day. This service is done almost always at no cost to the borrower.

You have no recourse to get it back directly. An ernest deposit need to be something you can get back.      You may end up with the property as a result of other suits and actions.    Definitely a case where professional attorneys and title companies should have been involved.|`|r7ibJOa7aa	You're in a mess. I am sorry. By quick claiming them on they now own a portion and if they file for protection/bankruptcy, then that property becomes part of their assets and can be disposed of in order to satisfy their creditors/debt. Unless you pay off their portion.

xVEOuPikaa	The IRS states that employees/shareholders/directors of S Corporations or C Corporations that perform services for the corporation, must be paid a "reasonable wage".  No where in the code is this term defined.  Reasonable is determined on a case by case basis.    I think that if you file an S Corp return with no officer's compensation, it could get you looked at more closely.  The IRS has started a campaign to examine this very topic.  I know that some states are also looking into officer compensation as well, because they want their cut too.    In my honest opinion, if your S Corp is operating at a loss after paying ordinary and necessary expenses, then it is not "reasonable" to pay an officer's salary.  It doesn't make sense for a company to go further in the hole to compensate the officer/employee.  In your corporate minutes, you may want to write something like:  "Officers will not draw salaries until the corporation is operating at a profit."    On a side note, be careful about operating at a sustained loss.  A couple years in a row for a startup business is completely normal.  If the losses continue, the IRS take a closer look at the way you are running your business.

AA10464818	BUNCH OF BULL    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes. Once you find a grant where you can qualify, apply for it at Grants.gov    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|GRfb81uxaa	Hi,    You can depend on them as they have specific and exact info on availing of grant.

My mom had to file a bankruptcy, and she had the trustee from hell....I know you're allowed a certain amount of "credits", but any cash you have isn't necessarily off limits to them.  They see it as a way to pay off your creditors, and take their fee as well.    Mom's attorney even told a story of some 80 year old man that had moved to another state during the process, he couldn't afford his place anymore, so moved in with his kids.  The trustee was trying to issue an arrest warrant for the guy to get him to come back to the state for some BS....80 year old man....sadly, the trustee is pretty much God and can do whatever they want, and they do.  Good luck!    EDIT:  Your monthly check should be ok, but that lump sum sitting in the bank may not be.  I'd still ask an attorney, so you know what to expect in court, and give you peace of mind until then.  Again, they view that as cash to pay off your bills and add to their trustee fee.  The more money they can get out of you, the more money they make.  They get to keep a percentage, that's their fee, so they're going to try to take everything they can.  You would think since it's from a disability, it would be ok, and they wouldn't take it, but I wouldn't trust them a bit.|`|015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	The lump sum will be vulnerable.

Los contribuyentes pagarn este impuestos por los depsitos en efectivo que se realicen en sus cuentas, hasta por un monto acumulado de $25,000.00, en cada mes del ejercicio fiscal.  No se considerarn depsitos en efectivo, los que se efecten a favor de personas fsicas y morales mediante transferencias electrnicas, traspasos de cuenta, ttulos de crdito o cualquier otro documento o sistema pactado con instituciones del sistema financiero en los trminos de las leyes aplicables, an cuando sean a cargo de la misma institucin que los reciba.

Ahora bien, si tus operaciones de venta son al pblico en General y son en efectivo, y se depositan a tu cuenta de cheques, cuando acumules ms de $25,000 pesos empezaras a pagar este impuesto, reteniendote el banco el 2% de tu saldo acumulado mensual de tus depositos en efectivo.

iL7VxitHaa	Este tipo de preguntas son muy interesantes por sencillas q parezcan y lo que he logrado notar es que no tienen muchas respuestas; ahora bien, para mi los gastos en comento si son deducibles en tanto reunan requisitos establecidos en ley, sean necesarios para la obtencion de ingresos de acuerdo a la actividad y esten debidamente registrados en contabilidad. Si tu gasto no reune requisitos fiscales pero lo consideras en tu contabilidad y es necesario para tu actividad creo q es dificil no considerarlo deducible aun por la propia autoridad; bueno esa es mi humilde opinion.|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Te voy a dar mi opinin.  1. Los gastos de viaticos, incluyendo los pagos de peajes y uso de autopista son 100% deducibles. ISR  Art. 32 Fracc. V  2. Deberan trasladar el IVA por separado por Ley. Art. 1 de LIVA. Por lo que es evidente que si uno se baja del auto y as lo solicita se lo deben de trasladar.  Por tanto es acreeditable dicho IVA y es deducible ese gastos, siempre y cuando se cumplan los requisitos de deducibilidad.  Ahora bien, mucho ojo, un mal contador pblico te har pagar 30% mas de impuestos de lo que realmente te corresponde.  Ojal y te sirva.  Saludos !
Sou9Yk59aa	Este a?o de 2008 cuando cheques tu estado de cuenta, te percatars que el banco te retuvo un 70% ms del Impuesto Sobre la Renta (ISR) sobre los intereses que tu ahorro o inversin te haya otorgado.   A partir del primero de enero de 2008 la tasa de retencin anual del ISR sobre intereses que tu obtengas es del 0.85%, contra el 0.50% que se retena hasta el ltimo da de 2007, de acuerdo a la Ley de Ingresos.  Ahora bien, dicha retencin es efectuada tomando como base el capital invertido que genera tus intereses.  Esto esta dispuesto en el artculo 160 de la LISR, que dispone que,   quienes paguen los intereses a que se refiere el artculo 158 de esta Ley, estn obligados a retener y enterar el impuesto aplicando la tasa que al efecto establezca el Congreso de la Unin para el ejercicio de que se trate en la Ley de Ingresos de la Federacin sobre el monto del capital que d lugar al pago de los intereses.  Un ejemplo sencillo es: Inviertes $100,000 se te retendr $850.00 pesos, en lugar de $500.00 que se venan reteniendo en 2007.  Ojo esta tasa de retencin es anual.   Luego entonces, se te retendr el 0.85% de tu capital invertido y tu debers acumular el inters real generado en el a?o, que corresponde a restarle al inters nominal el efectos inflacionario anual....

XxDadC2aaa	No quiero desanimarlos en cuanto  a sus comentarios, pero veo que la palabra comun en todas las respuesta es "ARIESGADO".    Te dare mi respuesta y espero que te ayude de algo a ti y a todos los que participan en este sitio.    La bolsa de Valores, en este caso la de los Estados Unidos es la mas liquida del mundo, en otras palabras con un peque?o movimiento ya se hacia arriba o hacia abajo puedes hacer dinero pero antes debes conocer algunas cosas:    1. Cuanto Capital estas dispuesto a Invertir  2. Cual es el corredor de Bolsa adeacuado para tus inversiones.  3. Tener un Ordenador, PC o computadora con conexion a internet    Con estas tres cosas entonces puedes empezar a:    1. Aprender sobre el metodo de inversion  2. Tener la mentalidad adecuada  3. Saber aministrar tu capital de inversion o Portafolio    A hora ustedes se preguntaran como se todo eso? bueno la verdad tomo un curso super avanzado en el 2006, y no soy graduado de finanzas o algo por el estilo, soy dise?ador web y programador.    Y quiero decirles que no hay nada oculto en la bolsa de valores solo debes de aprender del que esta en las trincheras, Yo tengo un Mentor Inversionista profesional que ense?a sobre todo lo de la bolsa de valores desde su mecanismo hasta las estrategias que por cierto son (8) las cuales puedes usar para invertir ya sea hacia arriba o hacia abaja,    Una cosa mas cuando la bolsa esta a la baja, como lo esta a hora es cuando mas los inversionista profesionales hacen dinero,,, que te parece? esto quiere decir que no importa para que direccion este la bolsa,,,,para donde sea puedes hacer dinero, pero para ello debes de aprender conocer y aplicar estos conocimiento,,,,,,jajajaj bueno creo que escribi mucho y recuerden algo como dice Robert kiyosaki en su libro el cuadrante del flujo del dinero     ""Arriesgado NO es perder Dinero Arriesgado es no Aprender sobre las inversiones o como administrar tu dinero""    Asi que querido amigo no temas en aprender algo    Estoy por terminar mi pagina   http://www.inversiones-en-bolsa.com/blog    saludos|`|dFlC7PFcaa	LOS RIESGOS SON QUE COMO NI T NI YO SABEMOS NI MADRES DE ESAS COSAS, PUES NOS PUEDEN ENGA?AR FCILMENTE Y QUITARNOS NUESTRO DINERO|`|bff20acacf68c7fcd3cda447a8aad2b2aa	beneficios los rendimientos pueden ser altisimos  riesgos si no sabes de acciones es suicidio y si sabes es ruleta rusa.|`|oRHXy8xmaa	Mira si lo que buscas es hacerte rico de la noche a la ma?ana, o al menos obtener un gran rendimiento,es posible,pero como ni tu , ni nadie conoce la totalidad de la multiples variables que inciden, en la bolsa, seguro perderas dinero.  Si inviertes a largo plazo 2 o 3 a?os el rendimiento que te de puede y seguro sera bueno.  Ejemplos hace 4 a?os la bolsa mexicana tenia 12000 hoy tiene 29000 unidades, es decir en 4 a?os rindio mas del doble del capital.

Por lo poco que detallas talvez te conviene como persona fisica y si tus ingresos son menoresa 4mill. como regimen intermedio, ya quela contabilidad es sencilla de llevar, no te costara el pago del acta constitutiva, puedes deducir las inversiones en un solo periodo,; pero es necesario que alguien vea tu caso especifico.|`|bff20acacf68c7fcd3cda447a8aad2b2aa	1-no pueden facturarte con tus datos fiscales si no estas dada de alta en hacienda. solo contus datos fiscales tiene validez fiscal.  2-como persona moral tienes mayor capacidad de deduccion de impuestos sin embargo tambien estos aumentan y la complejidad de majarla tambien. yo optaria por persona moral pero repito es mas complejo su manejo, sino pues persona fisica con actividad empresarial deduces menos pero es mucho mas simple.
dF05BZMwaa	MMM interezante...    Afortunadamente los contribuyentes que creemos que este nuevo impuesto es violatorio a nuestra Constitucion Politica tenemos el Amparo como una medio legal para evitar el pago del mismo.    Sin embargo apesar de que la Ola de amparos a sido muy grande,  sera dificil que los amparos procedan.    El contribuyente es el indicado en tonmar la decicion y acudir a un despacho para levantar un amparo tomando en cuenta el "Costo-Beneficio"    Existe el maparo y con ella la ezperanza de que proceda y se falle a favor de los contribuyentes...     El IETU tiene serios problemas de inconstitucionalidad, no detalla los elementos esenciales del tributo con un grado de claridad y concrecin razonable, a fin de que los  gobernados tengan certeza sobre la forma en que deben atender sus obligaciones tributarias; es un sistema que no distingue sectores, simplemente aplica a quienes realicen las operaciones de enajenacin, prestacin de servicios y otorgamiento de uso o goce temporal de bienes; no permite la deduccin de la nmina y aportaciones de seguridad social, intereses y depreciaciones, aplica una tasa nica a la totalidad de los sujetos obligados, no haciendo distincin alguna entre las diversas capacidades econmicas de los sujetos pasivos.    No se si los intereses polticos permitan la procedencia de los amparos.    Pero se tienen todavia 15 dias hbiles despues de haber presentado el pago de enero. Hay muchos contribuyentes  que todavia no lo presentan, y todavia tienen esta opcin.|`|Sou9Yk59aa	El medio idneo de defensa para impugnar la inconstitucionalidad del IETU consiste en la interposicin de una demanda de amparo indirecto ante los Juzgados de Distrito competentes.  Asimismo, creo que que diversas disposiciones de la Ley del IETU en sus Artculos Transitorios, resultan violatorios de las garantas de justicia tributaria que consagra el artculo 31, fraccin IV de la Constitucin.

No debes esperar al proximo mes porque la autoridad puede percatarse y requerirte el pago, lo mejor es que lo hagas espontaneamente|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Lo debes de pagar antes del 17 de marzo, con los recargos correspondientes.  Estoy a tus rdenes.|`|isC9XzPHaa	al estar dado de alta por honorarios tienes la obligacion de presentar el IETU mensualmente; sino lo presentaste el 17 presentalo lo mas pronto posible antes de que la uatoridad te lo requiera ya que te pueden multar por ello. La forma en que lo debes calcular es:  Ingresos que precibiste por honorarios menos los gastos que hayas realizado (telefono,papeleria, combustibles (recuerda que solo el 30% lo puedes hacer en efectivo), viaticos, etc, al resultado le multiplicas por 16.5% (tasa para 2008) y a lo que te resulte le restas el ISR que pagaste y elISR retenido, lo que te sale es el impuesto a pagar;sinembargo por presentarlo fuera del tiempo debes determinar recargos y actualizaciones (si lo presentas ahora  de actualizacion es cero, pero de recargos el importe que te haya salido le determinas el 1.13%); si se te complica mucho presentala en ceros en el portal del SAT (www.sat.gob.mx) y despues busca a un contador para que te determine el importe para que presente una complementaria, de esta forma evitaras multas. (te comento que hay otros conceptos que se consideran para el calculo del IETU pero es un poco complicado comentarlos por este medio y sobre todo si no conoces del tema).  La unica duda que me queda es que comentas que solo presentaste IVA ya que la empresa te retiene ISR, te comento que con independencia quelaempresa de retenga tu debes presentar la declaracion de ISR.
Sou9Yk59aa	El inters compuesto es una frmula exponencial y en todas las frmulas derivadas de ella debemos operar nicamente con la tasa efectiva. La tasa peridica tiene la caracterstica de ser a la vez efectiva y nominal, sta tasa es la que debemos utilizar en las frmulas del inters compuesto.     Con el inters compuesto, pagamos o ganamos no solo sobre el capital inicial sino tambin sobre el inters acumulado, en contraste con el inters simple que slo paga o gana intereses sobre el capital inicial.     Una operacin financiera es a inters compuesto cuando el plazo completo de la operacin (por ejemplo un a?o) est dividido en perodos regulares (por ejemplo un mes) y el inters devengado al final de cada uno de ellos es agregado al capital existente al inicio. As, el inters ganado en cada perodo percibir intereses en los periodos sucesivos hasta el final del plazo completo. Su aplicacin produce intereses sobre intereses, conocido como: la capitalizacin del valor del dinero en el tiempo.     La tasa de inters en el ejemplo anterior es 9% compuesto anualmente. Esto significa que el inters paga anualmente. As tenemos que en nuestra libreta de ahorros al final del primer a?o tendremos UM 109 (el principal ms los intereses), en el segundo a?o este saldo aumenta en 9%. Arrojando al final del segundo a?o un saldo de UM 118.81 que puede computarse como sigue:        Como vemos, un modelo matemtico va manifestndose con mucha nitidez. El Valor Futuro de una inversin inicial a una tasa de inters dada compuesta anualmente en un perodo futuro es calculado mediante la siguiente expresin:         Que no es otra cosa, que la frmula general del inters compuesto para el perodo n de composicin. En las matemticas financieras es fundamental el empleo de la frmula general del inters compuesto para la evaluacin y anlisis de los flujos de dinero.    Las ecuaciones derivadas de la frmula [11] (para inversin y recuperacin en un slo pago) son:     El tipo de inters (i) y el plazo (n) deben referirse a la misma unidad de tiempo (si el tipo de inters es anual, el plazo debe ser anual, si el tipo de inters es mensual, el plazo ir en meses, etc.). Siendo indiferente adecuar la tasa al tiempo o viceversa.    Al utilizar una tasa de inters mensual, el resultado de n estar expresado en meses.

Sou9Yk59aa	No es declaracin ciega.  Al tributar como arrendador bajo el rgimen del ISR, se te permite acceder a la deduccin ciega. De esta forma, en lugar de deducir gastos, deduces un porcentaje de tus ingresos como arrendador.  Sin embargo con el IETU, eso quedo atraz. Ahora tendras que tributar disminuyendo a tus ingresos unas cuantas deduccines y a la diferencia aplicarle un 16.5% para determinar tu IETU.    Estoy para servirte.|`|MDqdZifXaa	Para efectos del clculo de ISR hay una deduccin que es del 35% de tus ingresos sin necesidad de tener comprobantes, a eso se le llama deduccin ciega, y pues ver si te conviene depende de los gastos que tengas, aunque por lo regular conviene, si rentas 2 locales en $14500, me tienes que decir si ese monto es con o sin IVA incluido para poder decirte cunto pagas de impuesto|`|XxaZLvALaa	Debes medir que tanto de conviene aplicar deducciones autorizadas, puesto que la deduccin ciega se aplica en un 35% ms el predial, esto te conviene si no tienes deducciones autorizadas, es decir que no hagas mejoras a tu local por ejemplo.

Desde mi punto de vista, el cual esta basado claro est en la ley, no debes pagar el impuesto de la tenencia, pues seguramente el automvil ya fue dado de baja, y por tanto carece de placas de circulacin.  Si no has dado de baja las placas, hazlo a la brevedad.      Saludos!
96oj03dZaa	buenas tardes, para este 2008 el calculo se hace aplicando la tarifa integrada que ya contiene el subsidio(aproximadamente a un 68%) y posteriormente se aplica la tabla del subsidio para el empleo.  el a?o anterior 2007 se aplicaba la tarifa de impueto art 113, la tarifa para el subsidio art 114 y la tabla del credito al salario mensual, por lo tanto este a?o la empresa no calcula subsidio y unicamente se aplican 2 (dos) tablas impuesto y subsidio para la nivelacion del empleo.   espero te sirva esta informacion.|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Cambio el sistema de la aplicacin del subsidio y ahora es ms sencillo el calculo. Sin embargo, a lo que creo te refieres, es a la exencin del impuesto estatal de nominas, por la creacin de empleos. Esto lo debes checar en la entidad federativa en la que vives.  Saludos !|`|2KO9uCdbaa	Hola que tal, en la pagina del sat puede descargar las tablas, dependiendo de como les hagas el pago a tus trabajadores, se aplica el subsidio al empleo, el calculo se hace d ela misma manera que el a?o pasado, solo que en este caso no existe factur de subsidio pues no lo aplicas, aplicas directamente el tabulador de subsidio al empleo, si necesitas hacer el caculo te recomiendo una calculadora que se encuentra en esta pagina  www.tax.com.mx, ahi podras ver diferentes calculadora, si necesitas el detalle exacto y el procedimiento escribeme y te paso un archivo con todo el detalle.

Sou9Yk59aa	Es muy interesante tu pregunta y en principio iba a contestar que no es considerado pago a terceros. Sin embargo, me qued pensando en el asiento contable.

Entonces el revirar  - pues amigo, eso es un pago a terceros.  Saludos!

Sou9Yk59aa	Los Costos  A juicio del investigador, tan importante es saber los orgenes y desarrollo de la Contabilidad, hasta nuestros das, como la de los Costos, parte fundamental de esta propuesta. Para el investigador le pareci tan interesante la narracin de Lorino que decidi insertarla en este trabajo de grado. Como podr verse a continuacin, se detalla en forma pormenorizada los acontecimientos y personajes que gestaron y contribuyeron al perfeccionamiento de la Contabilidad de Costos y los Costos basados en Actividades (ABC).  Segn Lorino (1995:7), afirma que: ?Estos mtodos se fueron elaborando progresivamente entre 1850 y 1910, en particular en la gran industria norteamericana. Bsicamente, el desenlace de este proceso puede situarse en 1907, en Du Ponts de Nemours, aunque despus se pusieron a punto otras tcnicas. En efecto, fue en 1907 cuando Donalson Brown, colaborador de Pierre Du Pont de Nemours al frente del grupo qumico, invent la frmula que relaciona el ndice de rentabilidad de capital, el ndice de rentabilidad de la explotacin y el ndice de rotacin de capital. Por primera vez, los diversos tipos de contabilidad utilizados hasta entonces de manera independiente (Contabilidad de Capital, Contabilidad Financiera, Contabilidad de Costes) estaban enlazadas en un modelo nico, global y coherente, y constituan una imagen econmica completa de la empresa..., todava hoy, sirve de base a la gestin de le empresa y, por tanto, a menudo, a la actividad encargada de vigilar la calidad de esta gestin: el control de gestin.  La invencin de Donalson Brown remataba un largo proceso de innovaciones iniciado en 1902 bajo la tutela de los hermanos Du Pont. As se introdujeron sucesivamente: la asignacin de los costes indirectos para calcular los costos completos de los productos, la contabilizacin de los activos a su valor de adquisicin y el ndice de rentabilidad del capital invertido por divisin. en este trabajo los Du Pont y sus colaboradores se inspiraron ampliamente en las ense?anzas de un hombre que ya haban tenido como colega en la Johnson and Lorain Steel Company: Frederick Taylor.  Taylor fue, en efecto, uno de los pioneros del control de gestin industrial: fue el que desarroll la contabilidad analtica, la asignacin de los costes indirectos, el cronometraje y el seguimiento de los tiempos de mano de obra directa, los estndares, la asignacin de los costes indirectos mediante los tiempos de la mano de obra o de los tiempos de mquina, la gestin de las existencias y de las materias y la remuneracin al rendimiento; y esto entre los a?os 1889 a 1895. Seguramente ejerci una influencia determinante en los sistemas de gestin, no solo en Du Pont de Nemours, sino tambin en General Motors (filial, por un tiempo de Du Pont de Nemours) y en General Electric, donde el concepto de coste estndar se adopt y generaliz inspirndose en estas ense?anzas.?    Los Costos Basados En Actividades  Empero, continua Lorino (1995:3), ?de repente, con una agitacin que poda calificarse casi de febril, bajo el efecto de choques mltiples, una parte de la industria mundial ha emprendido la revisin, e incluso la reinvencin, del soporte de la gestin constituido por las herramientas de control, citemos a ttulo de ejemplo internacional de investigacin aplicada C.M.S. (Cost Management System)[Sistema Gerencial de Costos] de la agrupacin cooperativa CAM-I (Consortium for advanced Manufacturing - International)[Consorcio para el Mejoramiento de la Industria  Internacional]. Esta asociacin fue creada en 1972 por iniciativa de los grandes grupos industriales norteamericanos para organizar y financiar conjuntamente programas de investigacin en el mbito de la prodctica. Fue una iniciativa que condujo a una docena de programas de investigacin sobre temas tales como los lenguajes de programacin de control numrico, el dise?o asistido por ordenador y la generacin automtica de gamas. En algunos de los miembros industriales de CAM-I, ciertas universidades, como Harvard y Stanford, y los grandes grupos anglosajones de auditoria y asesoramiento (los ?Big Eight?) lanzaron un nuevo programa profundamente diferente de los precedentes, puesto que estaba orientado a la gestin y no a la tecnologa: el programa C.M.S. El objetivo perseguido era crear un nuevo tipo de contabilidad analtica adaptada al entorno de las industrias altamente automatizadas e integradas. El xito fue fulminante, porque, en un a?o, el programa haba absorbido l solo la mitad de la totalidad de los patrocinadores y financiaciones de CAM-I. En 1988, C.M.S. public, en asociacin con la Business School de Harvard, los principios bsicos del enfoque propuesto, bajo el ttulo ?Cost Management for Today's Manufacturing?. El libro obtuvo, en 1989, el premio de la ?American Association of Accountants? reservado a la mejor obra de Contabilidad de Gestin. En 1990, C.M.S. reuna a cuarenta empresas, de las cuales un tercio eran de Europa y dos tercios de Estados Unidos, de General Motors a Siemens, pasando por IBM, Boeing, Procter and Gamble, Phillips, Alcatel, Lucas, Aeritalia, Bristish Aerospace, etc. Entonces el programa fue calificado por Peter Ducker como "el trabajo ms estimulante y ms innovador en gestin de hoy en da, en el que nuevos conceptos, nuevos mtodos y nuevos enfoques van tomando forma en lo que poda llamarse una nueva filosofa econmica"?.  El resultado de esta investigacin dio origen al concepto de actividades, al respecto en el prefacio de Brimson (1997:9), Alfred King afirma: ?Nunca antes en la historia de la contabilidad un concepto ha pasado tan rpido de la teora a la prctica como en el caso de la contabilidad por actividades, o clculo del coste basado en las actividades.?

Desafortunadamente son ms las menos, es decir este nuevo esquema fiscal de tributacin ampla el espectro de pago de contribuciones, anticipando el pago del impuesto y difiriendo las deducciones.    Unos cuantos cambios de ltimo momento llevados a cabo en el congreso, suavizaron un poco la reforma fiscal, permitiendo a algunos causantes deducir algunos gastos y a otros no acumular cierto tipo de ingresos, pero la esencia de la reforma fiscal significa un aumento considerable en recaudacin fiscal debido al esquema de anticipacin fiscal del IETU.  Y mientras la ley permite la deduccin de donativos, otorgados a las personas morales con fines no lucrativos, estos los ha topado con porcentajes relacionados a la utilidad neta del ejercicio del donante.    Vamos entonces analizando las 10 ms trascendentes disposiciones de esta nueva Ley del Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa nica ( IETU) que entr en vigor el pasado 1 de enero de 2008.    1. ?Quienes estn obligados al pago de este impuesto? ?Cunto pagarn de impuestos los sujetos?    Estn obligadas al pago del impuesto empresarial a tasa nica, las personas fsicas y las morales por la realizacin de las siguientes actividades:    ? Enajenacin de bienes.  ? Prestacin de servicios independientes.  ? Otorgamiento del uso o goce temporal de bienes.    El IETU se calcular aplicando la tasa del 16.5% para el ejercicio 2008, 17% para el ejercicio de 2009 y de 17.5% a partir del ejercicio 2010 y para ejercicios subsecuentes, a la cantidad que resulte de disminuir de la totalidad de los ingresos percibidos (entindase efectivamente cobrados en los trminos de la Ley del Impuesto al Valor Agregado) por las actividades mencionadas, las deducciones autorizadas en esta Ley (efectivamente pagadas).    2. ?Qu tipo de ingresos se acumula? ?Cules ingresos estn exentos?    Se acumulan  ? El precio o la contraprestacin a favor de quien enajena el bien, presta el servicio independiente u otorga el uso o goce temporal de bienes.    ? Las cantidades que adems se carguen o cobren al adquirente por impuestos o derechos a cargo del contribuyente, intereses normales o moratorios, penas convencionales o cualquier otro concepto, incluyendo anticipos o depsitos.    ? Las cantidades que perciban de las instituciones de seguros las personas que reciban indemnizaciones amparadas por las plizas contratadas.    Se exceptan    ? Los percibidos por la Federacin, las Entidades Federativas, los Municipios, los rganos constitucionales autnomos y las entidades de la administracin pblica paraestatal.  ? Los que no estn afectos al pago del impuesto sobre la renta.  ? Los obtenidos por personas morales con fines no lucrativos o fideicomisos, autorizados para recibir donativos deducibles en los trminos de la Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta.   ? Los que perciban las personas fsicas y morales, provenientes de actividades agrcolas, ganaderas, silvcolas o pesqueras, que se encuentren exentos del pago del impuesto sobre la renta.  ? Los derivados de las enajenaciones siguientes:  a) De partes sociales, documentos pendientes de cobro y ttulos de crdito.  b) La enajenacin de certificados de participacin inmobiliaria no amortizables u otros ttulos.  ? Se incluyen como ingresos exentos los percibidos por personas fsicas cuando en forma accidental realicen alguna de las actividades gravadas por esta Ley (enajenacin de bienes, prestacin de servicios independientes, otorgamiento del uso o goce temporal de bienes).    3. ?Qu se podr deducir?    ? Las erogaciones que correspondan a la adquisicin de bienes, de servicios independientes o al uso o goce temporal de bienes.  ? Las contribuciones y aprovechamientos a cargo del contribuyente pagadas en Mxico, con excepcin del IETU, ISR, y a los depsitos en efectivo, de las aportaciones de seguridad social.  ? El impuesto al valor agregado o el impuesto especial sobre produccin y servicios, cuando el contribuyente no tenga derecho a acreditarlos.  ? Devoluciones, descuentos o bonificaciones, as como de los depsitos o anticipos que se devuelvan.  ? Las indemnizaciones impuestas por Ley, a excepcin de la negligencia.  ? La creacin o incremento de las reservas matemticas vinculadas con los seguros de vida, o de los seguros de pensiones derivados de las leyes de seguridad social.  ? Las cantidades que paguen las instituciones de seguros a los asegurados.  ? Los premios que paguen en efectivo las personas que organicen loteras, rifas, sorteos o juegos con apuestas y concursos de toda clase, autorizados conforme a las leyes respectivas.  ? Los donativos no onerosos ni remunerativos.  ? Las prdidas por crditos incobrables.      4. ?Cmo se paga?    El pago provisional se determinar restando de la totalidad de los ingresos percibidos en el periodo comprendido desde el inicio del ejercicio y hasta el ltimo da del mes al que corresponde el pago, las deducciones autorizadas correspondientes al mismo periodo. Al resultado que se obtenga conforme al prrafo anterior, se le aplicar la tasa del 16.5% para el ejercicio 2008.    5. ?Cuando se paga?    El IETU se calcular por ejercicios y se pagar mediante declaracin que se presentar ante las oficinas autorizadas en el mismo plazo establecido para la presentacin de la declaracin anual del impuesto sobre la renta. Asimismo los contribuyentes efectuarn pagos provisionales mensuales a cuenta del IETU.    6. ?Pagan los peque?os?    Los contribuyentes pertenecientes al R

Si quien te dice que invertir tu dinero en cetes es una sociedad de inversin patito entonces s ten mucho cuidado porque aunque la casa de bolsa no puede quebrar, s podran darte gato por liebre.    Los cetes se compran a travs de instituciones financieras, no directamente en bolsa. Cuida que la institucion financiera que te los vaya a comprar sea seria.    Hay varios plazos para recuperar tu dinero, el mas comn  es a 28 das.    Suerte|`|bff20acacf68c7fcd3cda447a8aad2b2aa	1-los CETEs no los compras directamente sino atraves de las inversiones que hacen las casas de bolsa o bancos.  2-un banco que paga la tasa CETE es inbursa como banco esta protegido por el IPAB hasta aproximadamente $1,500,000.00.   3-los CETEs son seguros (es el instrumento mas seguro, si gobierno quiebra todo el pais se va al ca?o), la casa de bolsa es la que puede quebrar y no esta protegida por el IPAB. como dije no comrpas los CETEs directamente asi que si la casa de bolsa quiebra pues tu inversion se pierde pues no tienes docuemtnso en tus manos que digan CETEs.    ojo aclaro por ahi mala informacion: bolsa de valores en mexico solo hay una, pero hay infinidad de casas de bolsa. las casas de bolsa son intermediarias entre tu y la bolsa de valores. los CETEs no son acciones (una parte del capital de una empresa) son tipo "pagares" de gobierno.|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Los Certificados de la Tesorera de la Federacin (CETES) son el instrumento de deuda burstil ms antiguo emitido por el Gobierno Federal. Se emitieron por primera vez en enero de 1978 y desde entonces constituyen un pilar fundamental en el desarrollo del mercado de dinero en Mxico. Estos ttulos pertenecen a la familia de los bonos cupn cero, esto es, se comercializan a descuento (por debajo de su valor nominal), no devengan intereses en el transcurso de su vida y liquidan su valor nominal en la fecha de vencimiento.    Ahora, si tu crees que la casa de bolsa puede quebrar (lo dudo mucho), pues invierte en una institucin mas solida. Cualquier banco o caso de bolsa te puede ofrecer el servicio.

lJIKr3DSaa	Desafortunadamente, como aval solidario tu respondes por ella, pagas a la empresa automotriz que le otorgo el credito a tu exnovia, como si tu les debieras, y no, el coche aunque tu pagues se queda con tu exnovia, lo que tienes que hacer revisa en la clausula si el coche esta en garanta con la agencia si es asi lo embargan, sino es mejor llamar a tu exnovia y ponerte de acuerdo para que pague, sino tienes que pagar t o te pueden embargar a ti y estan en todo su derecho, pero tienes el derecho tu tambien de demandarla para que te pague lo que tu pagas de su deuda y los costos que te genere por cobrarle a ella. como vez es mejor por las buenas por que despues es cuestion de abogados, suerte y espero te sirva.|`|wYHVAYc6aa	No te preocupes , nadie va preso por deudas . tomalo con tranquilidad y renegocia la deuda. aa y a tu novia,........dale un besito de mi parte decile que todavia la quiero.|`|fuLXmosyaa	Que mal que tu novia te haya metido en este problema, por que tu quisiste ser su aval de buena fe y por ayudarle, pero platicalo con ella, no es justo que por no atender el compromiso que se avento, a ti te quiten tus cosas. As que habla con ella para que lleguen a una solucion y pronto se pueda resolver esta situacin. Que todo salga bien!!!!!!|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Aval es un compromiso solidario de pago de una obligacin a favor del acreedor o beneficiario, otorgada por un tercero para el caso de no cumplir el obligado principal con el pago de un ttulo de crdito. El aval implica la voluntad de una tercera persona inmersa en el ttulo de manera unilateral, a dicha persona se le llama avalista.    En general, el Aval es la garanta que se ofrece sobre el pago total o parcial de una letra de cambio.    Se trata de un instrumento por el cual el tercero (avalista, )se compromete a cubrir el pago del monto del ttulo de crdito y sus intereses, en el caso de que el deudor original (avalado) no cumpliere con lo que le corresponde.    Normalmente, quien quiere recibir un prstamo necesita alguien que le avale si suscribe algn titulo de crdito. Es decir, necesita demostrar al banco o a la entidad que le presta el dinero que, en caso de que no pueda devolver el prstamo en los pagos acordados, dicha entidad podr requerir el pago y an rematar los bienes tanto del avalado como del avalista para cubrir el resto del prstamo que no haya sido devuelto.

Sou9Yk59aa	No entieno muy bien la preguna, pero voy a tratar de explicarlo:    Posibles ventajas:    Las empresas que integran vales de despensa a su previsin social, ahorran impuestos al deducir el gasto y al no incluir dicha prestacin como parte del salario del trabajador.    Alrededor de 40 mil empresas en Mxico otorgan vales de despensa como prestacin social a unos 4 millones de trabajadores, los cuales son deducibles al Impuesto Sobre la Renta (ISR), pero no para el IETU.  Aun con el Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica (IETU) la entrega de vales de despensa a los empleados contina como la mejor opcin para garantizar un mnimo de alimentacin a las familias.    Otra consideracin importante es que desalienta el comercio informal.    ?Cmo hacerlo deducible?    De acuerdo con la Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta (LISR), las prestaciones de previsin social "... debern otorgarse en forma general en beneficio de todos los trabajadores".  Una interpretacin  de forma general, establece que el requisito de generalidad slo se cumple si las prestaciones de previsin social se otorgan a "... todos los trabajadores".  Una segunda interpretacin que se ha hecho, sostiene que el requisito de generalidad implica que los beneficios que se establezcan en un determinado plan de previsin social, deben abarcar a todos los trabajadores que puedan quedar incluidos dentro del criterio que inspira el plan.      En resumen , para que la prestacin de vales de despensa sea deducible, debe otorgarse a todos los trabajadores, por lo menos de un mismo estrato.      No se si te fui util. Saludos!
rxy8Rz5Faa	Santander al igual que otros bancos estan restringiendo la disposicion de efectivo  de las tarjetas de credito para protegerse ya que no se sabe bien lo que este a?o pase con lo de la resecion de Estados Unidos, algunos como imbursa se estan justificando diciendo que, como la vayas utilizando te iran dando credito disponible para disposicion de efectivo, aunque en realidad creo que es lo mismo que las demas, toda mi familia y yo tenemos diferentes tarjetas de credito de diferente bancos y en TODOS esta pasando lo mismo con las tarjetas nuevas, con las que fueron tramitadas durante o antes del 2007 solo estan disminuyendo la linea de credito, No creo que mandar un abogado sea util, ya que pues como dicen anteriormente, las tarjetas tienen restricciones  y el banco puede amparase con eso, y solo gastaras dinero y tiempo, la tarjeta CLICK es buena tiene una taza de interes media (2.8 mensual) y el seguro que viene incluido es Gratis (seguro en caso de accidente en viaje) a menos que te hayan vendido otro al realizar el tramite y tu no te diste cuenta, aveces decimos que si a lo que nos dicen y firmamos sin fijarnos por prisa y en caso de eso puedes cancelarlo sin pagar nada.  Yo te recomiendo que si te urge, paga con tu tarjeta tu despensa y servicios asi como gasolina, y el dinero ocupalo para tu urgencia, o en su caso pide un prestamo efectivo en banco santander  tardan un par de dias en darte respuesta y manejan una tasa de interes muy baja.Mucha suerte y no te enojes con tu banco.|`|bff20acacf68c7fcd3cda447a8aad2b2aa	no hay enga?os cuando lo firmas en un contrato de la solicitud. lo mas que peude argumentar el banco es que el vendedor que te tramito la tarjeta se equivoco y listo. nadie lee los contratos. la cartera vencida de los bancos esta aumentando debido a que la gente no paga las tarjetas, dispone de efectivo que es mas caro e incluso con eso paga otras tarjetas  y transfiere una deuda al banco sin su autorizacion. es raro que no te permita sacar dinero pero lo mas probable es que se deba a la nueva politica por la cartera vencida. no deben cobrarte ningun seguro que no hayas aceptado sin embargo lo mas probable es que lo aceptate sin saberlo. la unica queja procedente seria por el seguro no solicitado y seria ante la CONDUSEF. el resto no corresponde pues en tu contrato debe estar todo. aprovehco para decirte que tambien los contrato TODOS al firmalos le das autoridad plena al banco de cobrar una deuda vieja de cualqueir cuenta que tengas con ellos. ni modo letras chiquitas.|`|im4ecHMvaa	Lee los contratos, saludos!!|`|WbmseiNgaa	Desgraciadamente el banco NO enga?a a sus clientes, simplemente los clientes nos enga?amos a nosotros mismos al no leer detenidamente los contratos ANTES de firmarlos.  La tarjeta Click de Mexicana, COMO CUALQUIER OTRA TARJETA, tiene sus restricciones particulares.  Desafortunadamente el banco no est para tocarse el corazn y abrirte una lnea de crdito por alguna emergencia sin la papelera que ellos requieren.  Lo que s no es correcto es que te cobren la mensualidad del seguro que no autorizaste; puedes hacer la reclamacin (e incluso la bonificacin de pagos anteriores del mismo seguro) SIEMPRE Y CUANDO realmente no hayas firmado nada (de nuevo, checa BIEN tu contrato).|`|UesLH8AFaa	asi son en serfin|`|Sou9Yk59aa	Codusef es el canal adecuado.

Even a property selling for the same price may not be assessed at the same tax as the other. This data is Public record and can be found at your local court house.   Also you don't always have to pay your taxes in your mortgage. Although many lenders prefer it and may charge a higher interest rate if you don't. You can also pay the yourselves quarterly in most places.   I like Bank of Americas Mortgage calculator as it does have the plug ins for Insurance and taxes.|`|bh7mrIrqaa	Not if there isn't a place for you to enter it in.
