If you do this at the top of everest the air pressure is lower and the temperature that the water boils at will get lower; it will still boil, but you won't be able to get it hot enough to cook your egg properly (because once it is steam it will just float off).<br>  <br>  The thing about the gas stove is kind of true, but people who go up everest take oxygen tanks with them which could fix that problem.

AtwxEl9Jaa	Hi, I'm from Texas too, so I've been through the TAKS. This is really good that you're trying to prepare for it now.<br>  <br>  OK, so punctuation: I'll just go through the basics.<br>  <br>  Commas(,): You want to use commas when you've already written something that could be a complete sentence on its own, but you're adding more to it. When you use a conjunction (and, but) you usually want a comma before it. You also use commas in lists: apples, oranges, and bananas. (The comma before the "and" in a list isn't necessary, but you can put one there if you want)<br>  <br>  Semicolons(;): You use these when you have what could be two complete, separate sentences in one sentence. So, for example:<br>  My dog is the best ever; she always brings my slippers to me.<br>  You don't want to use this unless the two parts are related; if they don't really have a connection then just make them into two separate sentences.<br>  <br>  Colons(:): You want to use a colon before a list, so, for example:<br>  My mom asked me to pick up some groceries while I was out: milk, cheese, and eggs.<br>  <br>  OK, so as far as paragraphs, you want to put these in when there's a change in topic. So, if you're telling a story and you're talking about one place, and then you move to another place, that will probably be a new paragraph. I would also suggest that whatever the climax of your story is, it should be in a separate paragraph. So, maybe you've been talking about this birthday party you had, blah, blah, blah, then you get to the part where your sister smashed your face into the cake. That should probably be a new paragraph, because that's what you've been building up to.<br>  <br>  Some common mistakes to look out for:<br>  <br>  their vs. they're vs. there<br>  1. Their: this is possessive, you use it to say something like, "Their mom got fired." "Their dog ran out into the street."<br>  2. They're: this is a conjunction for "they are." If "they are" doesn't fit into the sentence then don't write "they're." Example: "They're my best friends." "They're so annoying."<br>  3. There: refers to a place. Example: "You went to the store? What did you get while you were there?" <br>  "You went there? To their house? They're so annoying!"<br>  <br>  its vs. it's<br>  This one's a little confusing, because usually you use an apostrophe with the possessive, but not here:<br>  1. its: this is the possessive, so: "You stole its toy!"<br>  2. it's: this is a conjunction for "it is." If saying "it is" in place of "it's" in the sentence doesn't make sense then you're using the wrong word, it should be "its." Example: "It's my best friend Kara!" "It's a miracle you weren't killed."<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck, and hope those tips helped!|`|1Bj5nJOfaa	<a href="http://www.geocities.com/turquoise_moonflower/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/turquoise_moonf...</a>

So if you have some education background or a degree, you might have a shot.

However you do not have to go to college to be a substitute teacher or an aide.<br>  <br>  When you go to college you will have to take a math test.

Yes. Four years of more. It will vary by state. In my state you would need to take all your gen ed then apply to a teacher education program. You would then major in Elementary education(if you want to teach elem. and Secondary program or Early childhood). You would then need to minor in another area to get endorsed. Areas such as special ed, music, PE, etc..<br>  <br>  2. In order to get a BA or a BS you would need to pass a college algebra class and take any other needed math classes you will need for teacher education requirements.

Most states only hire teachers who have an education degree, whereas others will hire teachers with degrees in the subject they intend to teach with the agreement that he/she will take additional classes to make up for the lack of an ed. degree.<br>  <br>  I don't think that you have to have a certain level of math, but you will have to take specific math classes when you get to college that fall under the general studies part of you degree (everyone has to complete). <br>  <br>  College is what you make of it. If you allow yourself to have a social life, meet new people, and not take life quite so seriously you will love it.<br>  <br>  The salary of teachers varies from state to state, and sometimes even specific areas within a state. You can check the dept. of education's website for each state to get more info. They usually have it posted.<br>  <br>  As far as a doctor's income.

3OlUzzumaa	I went to k-12 for 8th grade and LOVED it. Then I became a freshman in high school and it all went down hill from there. The work I was doing in 9th grade was work I found out my uncle was doing his 2nd year of college and he went to school to become a math teacher. For middle school like your daughter is going to be I think it's great but I wouldn't use it for when she becomes high school age unless you want her to sit in front of a computer until 11:00p.m. at night trying to figure out how to write a paper on a poem you should be reading about in college and not high school like I was. I still have younger siblings who are going to k-12 but known of them are in high school yet so its all good for them. I am now in 11th grade and go to BSO which is only an online school in Colorado, I find it to be pretty good for me because the work I'm doing is that of an 11th grade level. Because I was so used to doing college level work I find this work easy for me and am now taking college grade classes on the side as well. All I can really say is put her in k-12 for 8th grade then maybe try and find another online school for her to do for her high school years. You don't want to wear your daughter out with the high school work that is in k-12. I know it was the worst for me and I wouldn't want your daughter to have to deal with the same.<br>  Good luck,|`|LsAArkUyaa	I do not have personal experience but know many who use/used K12 with the GA virtual Academy.<br>  <br>  What I have noticed is it really depends on what your child is used to. If she has been attending PS, then the K12 workload will not be overkill.<br>  However is she has been homeschooled using most homeschool curricula, then there will be much more busy work than what she is used to.|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	I'm not sure what K-12 is, but I am in Kaplan on-line school, not because I have trouble, but because I play a lot of sports and have a demanding schedule. The teachers are great, and the work is the same standard that you would get at any private school. However, if your daughter is struggling, she should find it better doing on-line school, where she doesn't have the distraction of other kids. Hope this helped. Good luck :)|`|5CRkCxbwaa	I was using K12 through PAVCS for 2 years for 7th and 8th grades after attending catholic school for 7 years, and, honestly, I hated it. I gained weight, couldn't understand math, and I was depressed and never went out.  Now I'm halfway through freshman year and because I hated K12 so much I didn't do well and it affected my placement in catholic high school.  I am at the top of every single one of my classes and the material is so easy, but with K12 I couldn't grasp. My advice is to stay away from it and keep to the traditional methods of education.|`|6r9qsH8Maa	Why don't you just get her a tutor instead of having her use online schooling?

You made it clear that if someone makes a mistake, does not give you what you want, or just doesn't seem to like you, then they have to be racist since you are black, and in return should be sued.

Q7lvSU03aa	I have taught a computer class to elementary aged children and I had a few techniques I can share:<br>  1.  When you are giving instruction have them turn off their monitors and give you 100% attention<br>  2.  I had a strong firewall system in our lab where it would tell me every site that was accessed, and I had a 0 tolerance for any internet use that was not on task.<br>  3.  In general kids enjoy computer time, so taking it away is the most effective way to control behavior.  I would give students one verbal warning and then they would be off the computer for the class period and sit in the back of the room watching everyone else.  <br>  4.  Also I had a rule that they could not change anything on the computer, like the background.  <br>  5.  Finally if kids were disobedient or didn't do their work, I would let their teacher know and the teachers would help.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is you have to be strict and consistent.  If you stick with it for like 2 weeks kids will know they can't mess around anymore and start doing what they're supposed to.|`|mmgfzl6Saa	I agree with elliesmommie...however I would also add the element of surprise.<br>  <br>  Computers are amazing.

Ask the kids what they think needs to happen in the class so everyone learns, it's safe and everyone feels respected. Write it down on a piece of chart paper and add your own input. You can post it on the wall.<br>  You can let them know you want them to learn all they can so you will stick to the rules. Even though you have already started your class, you can backtrack.<br>  <br>  Like another person said, intriguing the students really engages them. Also, it is amazing how hard they will work if you have a surprise for the last five minutes if things go well. Again, show them something interesting on the computer.<br>  <br>  Perhaps another teacher could come in and suggest additional strategies that would fit the unique dynamics of your group.<br>  <br>  Below is a link with a list of resources.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)

The only disadvantage is if you have a difficult time being self motivated making a schedule for yourself. Just be sure that the school is accredited appropriately. Unfortunately, there are now two different accrediting bodies for nursing schools. It is ridiculous, but either one will be okay. I personally went through Florida Hospital College. It is online, and cheaper than other programs. University of Phoenix is also online, but more expensive. As long as the school has accreditation, your employer will be fine with that. I had worked for a year with my ADN before I finished the BSN.<br>  After I finished, I continued to work part time as an RN while I finished my pre-requisites for medical school. It is tough, because you will find that you have to take difficult classes all together. I took an accelerated general chemistry course in the summer, then organic chemistry, biology, and physics over the next year. Pretty heavy load, but it is do-able. It was nice to have some income from the nursing job, and the experience is priceless!<br>  It is a shame that there aren't some great BSN/pre-med programs. Many doctors would benefit knowing what nurses go through.<br>  Good luck and I hope you stick to it, it is great!

Iwk92vqyaa	How long before your paper is due?<br>  If not left to the very last minute you can read about it, even fictionalized, especially Ellison's book "The Invisible Man," and also work by Langston Hughes; both wrote on this topic and they wrote very well. Both are known authors of classics.<br>  <br>  Other than that, if you waited too long and don't know a single black person who may help you: You've got one = frustration. Explain why there is still frustration.<br>  <br>  Three more might be: 1. poverty. 2. racism, alive and kicking. 3. lack of knowledge of self, ie. "The Invisible Man" --many aren't told much helpful family history these days.<br>  <br>  ADD: Be real. I see your addition now. <br>  Though you can avoid mention of slavery, there's just no way you can get around the fact of discrimination = racism. <br>  People of all 'color' (my American Indian mixed-race kid too) are discriminated against in various ways. <br>  I was often asked if I adopted my kid; she was often assumed to be stupid. <br>  <br>  Here's one interesting thing I've noticed: <br>  People of any particular minority, of any race other than the lump sum of 'white,' will often at least nod to one another without knowing each other. 'Whites' most often don't do that; it also seems to me most are brought up to 'compete' -with each other. <br>  [ADD: I think the 'nods' are in recognition of a similar past regards 'racial-profiling'...] <br>  <br>  (If you mean "thanks" to me,  you're welcome.)|`|SHwuzsPyaa	GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY!!|`|wkceLdVxaa	the inferiority<br>  the inconvienice  (different buildings, water fountain, back doors)<br>  the self esteem issues|`|0853971cb093d5dece221ce25779cb76aa	Thats a really dumb assignment

IdGe1JWyaa	Top Tier depending on Major:<br>  UF<br>  UM<br>  FSU<br>  UCF<br>  <br>  UF is in Gainesville and is no where close to a beach or a major city.  Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville are about 2 hours away and so are the beaches.  The nightlife in Gainesville is over-rated and over-priced.<br>  <br>  University of Miami is a private university but it is close to Miami and the nightlife is like no other in Florida and the beaches and the Keys are close.  It is more expensive than the public universities but it has a good reputation and good programs.<br>  <br>  FSU is in Tallahassee in the panhandle and it is the capital city, beaches are about an hour away.  Good university in the Liberal Arts and Sciences Majors and International Law and Business.<br>  <br>  UCF is right on the outskirts of Orlando and is about 30 mins to an hour to the beaches depending on which beach you want to go to.  Daytona Beach is close by and of course the Mickey Mouse hell that is Orlando.  They have a good Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering program and a couple of other programs.<br>  <br>  USF, UNF and UWF are second tier schools|`|fJ4nYzVWaa	UF<br>  FSU<br>  UM<br>  UNF<br>  USF<br>  UWF<br>  <br>  Univ Florida is #1 party school in several magazines, and have good/great academics. They are also pretty cheap when compared to miami, and is comparable to FSU in price. Florida state is top10 in almost every magazine in terms of partying, and have been getting better in terms of education. Miami is another party school and have better acedmics than most people think but their students tend to stay there later than usual, due to the partying. <br>  <br>  I really dont know much about the other 3, sorry. I applied to FSU and UF so in my opinion there pretty good. But if you plan on going to UF, dont take it the wrong way if you don't get in,  5% of there students are out of state.

yGOmMQP7aa	Yes, you should include any colleges you are considering attending after the spring.  This will get your fafsa in by the schools deadlines so you will have funding ready for you when you transfer. It is possible to add schools at a later time, but the longer you wait, the longer you will have to wait to get your aid packaged.  <br>  It IS possible not to include a school originally, then add it later, but again, the longer you wait the longer into the semester your aid will be given to you.<br>  <br>  You will not be questioned about residency at all when you transfer to OK.  You will automatically be considered an out-of-state resident when you turn in a transcript from CA. You will keep this out of state residency for the entire time in college.... remember that.
c46140f0ed1bdf47a7f332d7d6ea3dc0aa	Your marital status for the FAFSA is based on the date that you file your application.<br>  <br>  So, if marriage would be the only thing making you independent, and you file your FAFSA before you become married, then you would still need to provide your parent info. You CANNOT make changes to marital status after your FAFSA is filed. It is based on the date that you file. That means that, if you file it before you get married, you cannot go back and change your marital status and remove your parent info.<br>  <br>  If you would rather not provide your parent information on the FAFSA at all for 09-10, then you should wait until AFTER you are married to file. This will make you independent and you will have to provide income information for yourself and your spouse only.

H67nCOyHaa	I was so scared when my teacher tried to question me about being abused (which I am). She was really nice about it and even though I  was still nervous I began to trust her a lot more. I would actually not report it immediately if I were you, gain her trust first.I would ask her to stay after class to talk about her work or something like that. If you are a writing teacher you could assign the class to write a poem. If her poem is sad then ask to talk to her. She would probably be very scared and not look you in the eyes for a couple of days but she will more than likely realize she can trust you and come around. Shy and quiet are the two main signs to look for if you are suspicious. If she is on the verge of tears tell her that you care and she is allowed to cry. Does she wear long sleeves? If she does, she may be cutting herself like I am or she might be hiding brusies. My teacher took me to the guidance office and stayed with me when I was talking to the counselor which really made me see how much she cared about me. You know it might not be abuse... it could be adolescent depression like with cutting herself and suicidal thoughts. I was diagnosed with that. I am only 13 and I have no idea how old this girl is but this way worked for me and now I am very close to my teacher and I tell her everything. Since I am so young my advice might be useless to you but if you have any questoins you can email me anytime  at harleylynn@rocketmail.com, Good luck with this girl it sounds like she need you.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Speaking to the student really depends on her age and openness.  Many kids will not admit anything, either because of fear or they don't know of anything else.<br>  <br>  Either way most states require you to inform your principal.  Ask administration your school policies on how to go further.  I have seen this happen in several other classrooms and it is not an easy road to go down.  You could also talk to your school psychologist, or have the student.<br>  <br>  I think it is better if you don't get too involved.  It is a sticky situation that is best to let others who know what they are doing handle, and keeps you from alienating parents or the student.|`|pn3mQqGIaa	if this student views you as a friend, much like i do to a handful of my teachers, and they felt like you were approaching it because you cared, and you handled it in a very gentle and careful manner, i think it would be okay.<br>  make her feel safe, not attacked, while you talk to her.|`|6WjUi3M5aa	You have to be very careful with your questioning. The problem is with leading the girl. If this reaches a higher level, and it was found you drew answers from her by leading your questioning, it can have very negative effects later. At our school, we are not allowed to draw out replies by asking direct questions. You are to report only on what you suspect, or what the child has freely spoken to you about. You can, however, ask questions like, "What did you do last night? How was your evening? What did you have for dinner last night?" <br>  <br>  If you truly suspect abuse, I would just make a list of signs I am seeing, and what I truly suspect, and make the call. I have called twice during my eight years on students I had. One was corrected by the system, and the other I was told there was no evidence of abuse at home. Either way, you would be doing what is within your power to do to protect your children.|`|rhsP7LoQaa	Well don not ask right off the back "are you being abused"<br>  Pay attention to her behavior.. Get close to the student. Show her she can trust you. <br>  And then if things get really bad, try talking to her in private. Get together after-school for tutoring or lunch period. This a very serious subject that should not be treated lightly. This young girl you're speaking of can be a victim of sexual abuse, physical or neglect. Usually Neglect you can tell by her clothing, lunches, or if she looks depressed.<br>  <br>  Physical you can tell by little things like bruises or the girl is always trying to cover her arms, or she looks as if she were in pain.<br>   <br>  Now Sexual Abuse is hard to tell. The victim usually has to confess to these kind of problems, as to you cant tell just by looking at her, hence you should really gain her trust. Let her know she is safe in school..<br>  <br>  Good luck hoped this helped.. and i hope this is just a hunch you have because i really feel bad for children even adults that go or went through these type of things..<br>  <br>  Thats why i want to be a Phycologist. These people dont deserve that. NO ONE DOES.

It became about what you could and couldn't get away with, and students became more focused on finding loopholes in the rules than the original intent. People found ways to wear different cuts of pants, and still critisized other students for what they wore.<br>  <br>  It robs a person of their creativity and indivduality and forces conformity where its not needed. Everyone is not the same. People have different interests and tastes, but that doesn't mean someone is better than someone else. People should be given the opportunity to express who they are as a person without being forced into a mold of what they should be.|`|NFtK8IJCaa	it takes away from the freedom of being an individual. <br>  it can cause teasing because it doesn't fit you the right way<br>  some people go to public school so they don't have to wear uniforms. <br>  <br>  hope i helped.. i might add some later

AA10358331	A women is made up of xx chromosomes while a male is made of xy chromosomes. When meiosis happens in the cells it makes 1/2 cells.. either an x or an x for a women or an x or a y for a male. The female will always give an x chromosome but the male can give either an x sperm or a y sperm. So what ever sperm first enters through the membrane of the egg and fertilizes it the sex of the baby is made. <br>  IF an X hits the egg then its a girl, if a Y hits the egg then its a male.<br>  <br>  If you would like more info on meiosis talk to a bio teacher or look it up on the internet.|`|oTiTwGmdaa	it is all up to the husband. in school I learned that the man decides if the baby is gonna be a boy or a girl.|`|vnOViworaa	It's not random in that the sperm provides the chromosome for the sex.

7b33e2c1f15538f41d073bba8bbeb66aaa	You are doing a very good thing, which is describing your problem. This should be a first step towards getting over your anxiety and your nervousness, with all of the physical manifestations thereof. The next thing you should do is consider talking with that teacher who was concerned for you. She seems to care enough about you that she will take your concerns seriously if you say, "OK, I wasn't being fully honest. Here are the terrible things that have been going on, and this is why I lied." She might have ways to help you feel more comfortable in her class. Finally, if you need more help, speak with an internal medicine doctor or a pediatrician.|`|AtwxEl9Jaa	I think maybe it would be helpful to talk to someone about this. Is there anyone you do trust? Your parents, a counselor? It seems like something must have happened to make you lose confidence, and of course, you probably might not want to talk about it on here, but talking to someone can be helpful. It may even be something that you didn't realize has affected you the way it has. You obviously feel like something is wrong, now it's up to you to find the source. Hopefully from there you can get over whatever it is and go back to being your old confident self. If you're really having trouble going through this yourself, you might consider talking to a psychologist or a therapist. That wouldn't be my first step, but if that's what it takes, it will be worth it. Good luck!
fbc93468a1a2ccd2f309ab9a86de0728aa	yo creo que es bastante personal la respuesta, para unos es una frustracion tener esas barreras y se dan por vencidos por desanimo, o esa misma frustracion puede impulsar a que otros hagan todo para superar esas barreras, o habemos algunos otros que no consideramos la distancia, solo la seguridad de que lo vamos a lograr porque confiamos en nosotros mismos.<br>  <br>  Tambien creo que depende mucho de las metas, y la forma de ser de la persona, pero soy de las personas que cree que para hacerse un objetivo tiene que ser uno muy realista y considerar los pros y los contras y si es que ese objetivo no interfiere o se contrapone con otro objetivo o con el respeto hacia los demas.<br>  <br>  Hay que considerar que para cumplir un objetivo hay que saber utilizar la inteligencia, astucia, virtudes, defectos y libertad con muho cuidado, caer en el libertinaje, fanatismo, capricho y/o similares puede da~nar a otros y a uno mismo, y al rato uno se arrepiente de haber cumplido el objetivo de esa manera.|`|3a6e4923898678e839d3232ae0ec3139aa	depende de la personalidad.<br>  hay gente de gueva que no se esfuerza.<br>  Hay otros que nos gustan los retos.<br>  <br>  pero recuerda SI TODO LO DIFICIL SE HICIERA FACIL, CUALQUIERA LO HARIA.|`|6b93e4fa1da20fe555d7543f6e9a3d80aa	Eso depende del tipo de barreras.<br>  Hay barreras inmensas que a pesar de todo son superables, y barreras aparentemente más peque?as que sencillamente son insalvables.<br>  Procuro no quemarme en causas perdidas, de modo que empleo bastante tiempo en analizar a qué tipo de obstáculos me enfrento.

La salvación del hombre, está en el mismo.<br>  Para lograr entender analizo lo siguiente. Somos todos iguales.<br>  Solo que hay una diferencia entre Inteligencia y razonamiento.<br>  Todos tenemos inteligencia, es la mayor o menor rapidez es dar respuestas a los problemas conocidos o, capaces de asociar a algo conocido mediante el uso de la lógica.-<br>  Todos tenemos la posibilidad de usar el razonamiento, es cuando hacemos uso de todos los recursos puestos a nuestra disposición para encontrar la respuesta a un problema nuevo, o encontrar una nueva forma de dar respuesta a un problema ya conocido. <br>  Traducido lo anterior es = a lograr una mejor calidad de vida para la comunidad.<br>  Cuando las ideas que se nos ocurren son pensadas y razonadas hasta el momento en que vemos anticipada la realidad y, solo si somos capaces de llevar adelante el arduo trabajo de alcanzar a la realidad, si hacemos realidad nuestro ideal, si podemos sacar la idea de nuestra mente y transformarla en algo real, solo así seremos hombres (varón / mujer) ser humano, el ser superior a todas las demás especies.

Lo considero un reto y siempre que me trazo una meta lo logro. Pero hay que considerar que a veces hay barreras que son difíciles de superar como en el amor, por más que luches por alcanzar a esa persona que amas, si no recibes lo mismo o luchan los dos por romper toda barrera que se interponga en la relación nunca se podrá lograr. Pero en otros casos pienso que si, como dije anteriormente con constancia, perseverancia y mucho optimismo y esfuerzo podremos lograr metas que a veces nos parecen inaccesibles. La vida es así, luchar por conseguir lo que queremos y la mayoria de las veces lo conseguimos. Hay que estar claros que otras por más que luchemos no se nos darán por varios factores que puedan adversar ese empe?o o constancia, porque tal vez por  lo que luchamos no nos convenia y no vale la pena luchar a veces, por objetivos y metas que sabemos que no se nos darán por circunstancias o situaciones externas a nosotros que nos hacen entender y madurar que no era el objetivo preciso para nosotros en ese momento. Pero tal vez en otros casos si somos capaces de lograr lo que deseamos. Solo debemos aprender cuando no conseguimos esos objetivos, preguntarnos ?porqué no se nos dió? ?o que hizo que no lo pudiera alcanzar? y así aprenderemos para un nuevo objetivo que desemos alcanzar y superar lo que no pudimos.

You don't need to go to college first, but if you do go to college, you can transfer out after a year or go to community college and transfer in 2 years. Or go to college for 4 years, then go to Miami for graduate school.
sefHy5K1aa	Well, I imagine it's different at different schools, but my expereince is this:<br>  <br>  I could buy the class ring at any time from the college bookstore.  In that case they just send it to you.  I bought mine during "ring week" because there was a substantial discount - this also "included" the ring ceremony.  It was held at the Alumni center and we were called into a room one at a time to put the ring on, the Jostens person made sure that the ring was made correctly, and I shook hands with the President of the University and the President of the Alumni Assoiciation.  They had a small reception afterwards.|`|348884fa42d5cf44fac6a818efb8d3bbaa	A class ring (also known as a graduate, or grad, ring) is a ring worn by students and alumni to commemorate their graduation, generally for a high school, college, or university.<br>  Significance<br>  Today these rings are often personalized by each student, although in years past they were uniform to the school's standard, and only the year would change. A typical class ring depends upon the gender of the person wearing the ring; men's rings are larger than women's. The color is usually gold; however, even that can differ from school to school, and students can order their ring in white gold, silver, or various non-precious metal alloys. The center stone is traditionally one of the school's colors, but the size and cut can be individually customized to the student's desire (as well as the size of the ring). Jostens, Balfour, Herff-Jones, and ArtCarved are four major companies that sell class rings to students. There are also small up and coming manufacturers that produce class rings such as Jecstar<br>  <br>  How to wear<br>  The class ring is usually worn on the ring finger of the right hand, as the ring finger of the left hand is reserved for a wedding band (however, more than a few persons wear their class ring on the same finger as the wedding ring with the wedding ring slightly beveled in order for both rings to properly fit together). The ring ought always to be worn so that the insignia faces the wearer when his or her arm is outstretched (Vanderbilt, Complete Book of Etiquette p. 156).<br>  <br>  Especially in high school, a boyfriend and girlfriend may exchange class rings. The boy usually wears the girl's class ring on his pinky finger, while the girl wears the boy's class ring around her neck on a golden chain.[citation needed]However, in some high schools, the girl wears the boys ring on her right ring finger while the boy wears the girls ring on a chain around his neck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ref: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_ring" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_ring</a> -  for the above  and more<br>  <br>  more reading:<br>  <a href="http://www.ufalumni.ufl.edu/ring/Default.aspx?bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.ufalumni.ufl.edu/ring/Default...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/pendulum/Issues/2005/05_05/features/classrings.xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.elon.edu/e-web/pendulum/Issue...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Ramesh<br>  The Human Search Engine<br>  alluwanted.com|`|e59397a77e16f705abb35b86dee2e44eaa	A.

xkeSwj3Naa	I thought it was actors who coined the phrase. It was considered bad luck to wish someone good luck, so they said "break a leg" instead.|`|6DFhlt4daa	Idioms: break a leg <br>  <br>  1.  Fracture one or more leg bones, as in She fell down the stairs and broke her leg in two places. [c. a.d. 1000] <br>  2.  Good luck! as in Play well, Rob--break a leg! The origin of this imperative to a performer about to go onstage is unclear; it may have been a translation of the German Hals und Beinbruch ("Break your neck and leg"), also of unknown origin. Equally mysterious is the Italian equivalent, In bocca di lupe, "Into the mouth of the wolf." [c. 1900] <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/break%20a%20leg" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/break%20a%20leg</a><br>  <br>  Meaning<br>  <br>  Said to actors for good luck before they go on stage, especially on an opening nights. <br>  <br>  Origin<br>  <br>  Theatrical types are well-known for their belief in superstitions, or at least for their willingness to make a show of pretending to believe them. The term 'break a leg' appears to come from the belief that one ought not to utter the words 'good luck' to an actor. By wishing someone bad luck, it is supposed that the opposite will occur. Other superstitions are that it is bad luck to whistle in a theatre, to say the final line of a play during dress rehearsal, or to say the name of 'the Scottish Play' in a theatre's green room. <br>  <br>  The word 'break' has many meanings - the OED lists 57 distinct uses of it as a verb alone. That gives considerable scope for speculation over what is meant by the phrase. The most common interpretation of 'break' in this context is, 'to deviate from a straight line', as in the cricketing term, 'off break'. That is, unstraighten the leg by bending at the knee, by bowing or curtseying. <br>  <br>  'Break a leg' also means, 'make a strenuous effort'. There are many references to the phrase used that way, which pre-date the earliest theatrical good luck charm meaning. For example, from The Hammond Times, Indiana, 1942:<br>  <br>  "Whatever the army or navy want, the Continental Roll [and Steel Foundry] will turn out ... Or break a leg trying."<br>  <br>  From the Evening State Journal, Nebraska, 1937:<br>  <br>  "With all the break-a-leg dancing there are many who still warm to graceful soft shoe stepping."<br>  <br>  So, it is possible that when an actor is told to 'break a leg', he/she may just be being exhorted to put on an energetic, exciting performance.<br>  <br>  (more.........)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break...</a><br>  <br>  "Break a leg," of course, is how actors wish each other "good luck" before a performance, and has been commonly heard in the theater since the early 20th century. That date of origin, by the way, casts serious doubt on one of the more colorful theories about the origins of the phrase. It has been said that "break a leg" is a reference to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, in 1865. In attempting to flee the scene, Booth jumped from Lincoln's box to the stage, breaking his leg. The fact that actors didn't start wishing each other good luck by saying "break a leg" until more than 50 years after Lincoln's assassination makes this an unlikely source.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.word-detective.com/back-d2.html#breakaleg" rel="nofollow">http://www.word-detective.com/back-d2.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Similar expressions are known from other languages.<br>  <br>  (more.......)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bre1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bre1...</a>|`|OWxEqZCiaa	place in cuba<br>  <br>  where they wear orange|`|krHIiK85aa	Wikipedia has an entry discussing all the debated origins of the phrase.

Supuestamente Cristo es Dios echo hombre, Dios no puede abandonarse a sí mismo.<br>  <br>  La "respuesta" correcta es que en el momento de la Cruz, Cristo recibía en sí a todo el pecado del mundo, para morir con él.

38FQ3YfFaa	Historical events:<br>  <br>  The city was founded La Nouvelle-Orléans on May 7, 1718, by the French Mississippi Company, on land inhabited by the Chitimacha.<br>  <br>  New Orleans became part of the United States when it was sold by Napoleon Bonaparte in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. <br>  <br>  During the War of 1812, the British were defeated in their attempts to capture the city in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.<br>  <br>  <br>  Monuments<br>  <br>  The French Quarter is the oldest and most famous neighborhood in the city. When the city was founded it was originally centered on the French Quarter, or the Vieux Carré ("Old Square" in French) as it was known then. The district as a whole is a National Historic Landmark, and it contains numerous individual historic buildings. It is rich in history and culture.<br>  <br>  The Mississippi River ports made Louisiana one of the wealthiest cities in the country in the mid-1800s because of its use in the slave market, and facilitated trade and transportation from the beginning of the city's history up to today.<br>  <br>  1300-acre City Park, the 6th-largest and 7th-most-visited city park in the country. The Park is very unusual in that it is a public park majority funded by self-generated revenue through user fees and donations with nominal funding by the state. It holds the world's largest collection of mature live oak trees, some older than 600 years. Its founding in 1853 makes also makes it one of the oldest parks in the country.<br>  <br>  The New Orleans Mint operated as a branch mint of the United States Mint from 1838 to 1861 and from 1879 to 1909. During its years of operation, it produced over 427 million gold and silver coins of nearly every American denomination, with a total face value of over $307 million. After its decommissioning as a mint, the building served a variety of purposes, including as an assay office, a United States Coast Guard storage facility and a fallout shelter. Since 1981 it has served as a branch of the Louisiana State Museum. The New Orleans Mint has been designated a National Historic Landmark, and is currently the oldest surviving structure to have served as a U.S. Mint.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck with your project! :)
6sJhoXAAaa	I would take it in the summer, you might regret it later if you have a change in plans.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	They will take you if the rest of your grades are good.  You need to see if chemistry is required for the degree you want to pursue.  I wouldn't think so.|`|jV99kgWbaa	It's really a matter of choice whether you want to repeat your chemistry exam. <br>  <br>  But you may want to add to your qualifications as a whole, and as you've already done the course work and had a try at the exam, it might be a lot easier to get next time around, now you know what to expect :)<br>   <br>  To become a social worker in England, you will need to study for an honours degree or postgraduate degree in social work approved by the General Social Care Council (GSCC). You must then register with the GSCC.<br>  <br>  You will typically need the following qualifications to get onto an honours degree:<br>  <br>  Five GCSEs (A-C) including English and maths <br>  At least two A levels, or an equivalent such as a BTEC National Diploma or NVQ Level 3 in Health and Social Care. <br>  <br>  However, you should check entry requirements with colleges and universities, because alternatives like an Access to Higher Education qualification or substantial relevant work experience may also be accepted.<br>  <br>  Most honours degrees in social work are three-year full-time courses. Some part-time and distance learning courses are also available, although you can often only do these if you are already working in social care and have the support of your employer.<br>  <br>  During your social work degree, you will divide your time between university and supervised work placements. You would be trained to work with a range of service user groups, so that you could offer a range of experience to future employers when you start work.<br>  <br>  When you apply for training, you should ideally have some paid or voluntary experience in a social work or setting. Course providers will be able to advise you how much experience they would prefer you to have.<br>  <br>  If you are not being sponsored through the social work degree by an employer, you may be eligible for a bursary to study. <br>  <br>  You can find out more about a bursary to help you financially here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/Students/825.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/Students/825.as...</a><br>  <br>  And here's some general info you might find helpful:<br>  <a href="http://www.ucas.com/website/documents/progression/health_taster.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucas.com/website/documents/pr...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I can say with confidence they will accept you.

Also, try to pay much attention, do everything your told without arguing, and sort of kiss up to the teacher to let him/her see who you are and as you get attached more, she/he will let you loose on some things.

Capable of being accomplished with no difficulty, as in This crossword puzzle is easy as pie. The first term presumably alludes to consuming pie (since making pie requires both effort and expertise). The variants most likely allude to standing on a log that is moving downstream, a feat in which falling off is a lot easier than remaining upright. Mark Twain had it in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889): "I could do it as easy as rolling off a log." The first colloquial term dates from the early 1900s, the colloquial variants from the 1830s.

Try to get them from your supervisor from that internships as well as from teachers within the field that interest you. You need to have great GPA (4.0) and Test score.

7ZX3Ibz4aa	The pigs.<br>  <br>  There are a few reasons the pigs were accepted as leaders. The visionary of the entire revolution was a pig, Old Major, who outlines his dream of a world free of humans at the very beginning of the novel. After Old Major's death, the pigs, who are described as "the cleverest" of the animals, organize Old Major's thoughts into a coherent belief system they call "animalism". The three most important organizers are Napoleon, Snowball and Squealer. Snowball is the one that paints the seven commandment on the wall. Thus, by taking leadership early, the rest of the animals, who are not used to being leaders themselves, are easy targets for the pigs who seem clever and have the other animals' interests at heart

3A10gSQ3aa	Students and parents who must deal with the high cost of a college education have available to them a wide range of student loans. This article offers details on three general types of student loans. Unlike other student loans, application for a specific Stafford Loan should be preceded by the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA application should be made in the name of the aspiring student.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-loans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...</a><br>  <br>  Like some other student loans, application for the Signature Loan permits the use of a co-signer. In fact, there is a real advantage to applying for a Signature Loan with a co-signer.|`|i2Y16nTTaa	How To Pay For College Tuition Costs and More: Use Student Loan Programs!<br>  <br>  A student loan definitely helped me have a more comfortable college life when my scholarship money wasn’t enough. But how exactly did I go about finding student financing? The first thing I did was familiarize myself with the different types of student loan programs out there. <br>  <br>  1. Federal Student Loan <br>  I wanted to aim for a federal student loan. These loans are funded by the government and offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms. There are even federal student loans that don’t require repayment until you have graduated from college. For that reason, federal student loans are a popular choice among college students.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://loan-house.we.bs/studentloan.html" rel="nofollow">http://loan-house.we.bs/studentloan.html</a><br>  <br>  2. Private Student Loan<br>  Unfortunately, it turned out that I wasn’t qualified to get a federal student loan, so my next best option was to get a private student loan. This type of student loan requires that you have a good credit rating. Banks such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America offer private student loans, which fill in the space between other financial aid forms and money received from federal loans. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://loan--house.blogspot.com/2008/03/private-student-loans.html" rel="nofollow">http://loan--house.blogspot.com/2008/03/...</a><br>  <br>  3. Bad Credit Student Loan<br>  I did not qualify for a private loan either, because I had maxed out my credit card once and am still in the process of repaying it. But despite that, I was still able to get a loan through a bad credit student loan program. When I applied for a bad credit student loan, the lender didn’t even blink an eye over my credit record. Another option I considered was to go for a forgiveness program, which erases your debt in exchange for time you spend volunteering at a charity or serving in the military. But because the bad credit student lender accepted my application, I was able to avoid having to sign up for a forgiveness program.|`|U9ZDtSUcaa	universities.atwebpages.com - try this site.

I might wear both my rings now and look like a pimp, a pimp daddy.” - Ozzie Guillen<br>  <br>  “Everyone has favorite criminals. Mine are pimps. We can all rob a bank; we can all sell drugs. Being a pimp is a whole other thing.” - Chris Rock<br>  <br>  “Hockey is a sport for white men. Basketball is a sport for black men. Golf is a sport for white men dressed like black pimps.” - Tiger Woods<br>  <br>  “The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side.” - Hunter S. Thompson<br>  <br>  “If ballplayers were women, Drew Rosenhaus would be a pimp.” - David Ware<br>  <br>  “The johns use and abuse these young women. And pimps -- you can call them slaveholders, the masters out in the field.” - Deborah Pryce<br>  <br>  “If you're bright as a pimp, and thank God a lot of them aren't, you move them every two to three weeks.” - John Rabun<br>  <br>  “Over the last three years I've been broke, dumped, and pimped.” - Toni Braxton<br>  <br>  “The girls are very vulnerable now. Pimps are selling the bar girls to other countries, because they don't have any work.” - Varsha Kale<br>  <br>  “He's not a pimp. Our position is these witnesses are of questionable credibility.” - Sidney Fleischman<br>  <br>  “I am a handful, ... He should be able to handle me.

11a734d02a61c7fd63fff863ecaae116aa	All AP classes are supposed to be challenging since its a college-level course, so naturally all of them will be hard. It's designed so the people who have the guts and motivation to go through the whole challenging process will be the ones left in the class, kinda like weeding out the people who aren't willing to do the work and just complain. As the saying goes, "no pain, no gain"...if you aren't willing to suffer, then you won't be awarded. Students in AP classes sacrifice a lot, because they know that they will be awarded in the end with college credit.<br>  <br>  And yes, precalc and calculus are related, the way algebra and pre-algebra are related. precalc is just a little bit easier than calc.

If they do not, your insurance may cover a psychologist who can test for learning disabilities as well as your overall ability (IQ.)<br>  <br>  Here are some common learning disabilities. See if any apply to you.<br>  <br>  A learning disability is a neurological disorder. The person's brain is wired differently and though he or she may be as smart as anyone else, they have trouble with reading, writing, organizing and remembering.  Some of the recognized learning disabilities that affect reading (and other things) are deficits in the following:<br>  <br>  Auditory Sequencing - Confusion with number sequences, lists or lists of directions. Hearing ninety-four instead of forty-nine.<br>  <br>  Auditory Memory - Difficulty remembering what was heard, difficulty remembering important items from a lecture. Spells poorly.<br>  <br>  Visual Sequencing - Problems in using a separate answer sheet. Loses place easily. Problems with reading. Reversing or misreading numbers of letters. Reading words incorrectly. Difficulty with equations.<br>  <br>  Visual Memory - Difficulty remembering what was seen. Reading comprehension. Difficulty with math equations. Poor recall of information.<br>  <br>  Visual and Auditory Process Deficits - Difficulty with processing information taken in with the eyes or ears. Most commonly this means that processing info is slow compared to the average.<br>  <br>  Dysgraphia - Inability to form letters correctly. students cannot read their own writing.<br>  <br>  Visual Motor Integration - Mechanical problems in test taking. Difficulty copying from board or book. Spaces poorly. Poor written work. Unorganized.<br>  <br>  Non-verbal learning disability is a neurological disorder which originates in the right hemisphere of the brain, causing problems with visual-spatial perception, intuitive, organizational, evaluative and holistic processing functions.<br>  <br>  Auditory Figure Ground - Trouble hearing sounds over background noises.<br>  <br>  Visual Figure Ground - Trouble seeing an image within competing background. Picking one line of print from another while reading.<br>  <br>  Visual Discrimination - Seeing the difference between two similar objects<br>  <br>  Spatial Orientation - Loses materials. Late to class. Difficulty with oral reading. Unorganized homework. Difficulty judging time.<br>  <br>  Expressive Language - Difficulty expressing themselves. Difficulty with accessing stored information and turning it into language.<br>  <br>  Receptive Language - Appears to be "not listening". Does not respond promptly to cues. Does not understand long sentences or 3 step directions.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|5q7uPqVmaa	You could do either.

Just wondering, because if you get into a battle over this you may have to explain yourself.<br>  <br>  I was sort of in a similar situation when I was in college. My advisor told me that I didn't need to take another language, so I didn't. When I was in my last semester before graduation I found out that I had to take it to graduate. I was furious. I talked to another member of the English dept. (my major) and she immediately contacted the dept. chair. With his help, this course was waved and I graduated without it. <br>  <br>  Good luck...sometimes I think colleges do this stuff just to screw you.|`|IdGe1JWyaa	What is CEE 103 and CEE 135A?<br>  <br>  Can you take another class that closely resembles that class from another department of engineering?

b412254e11519aaa92cbe9efe511c454aa	The University Of Chicago (Hyde Park) is probably the finest medical school in the world, much less the US.  Northwestern University and Loyola university are also fine programs (much better than fine, outstanding).  Consider avoiding what we call academic incest.  Do your pre-medical someplace that is different than you desire to go to Medical School.  Very often schools with out a Medical School will have a premed program and guarantee placement in the Med-School providing you create and fulfill a 'contract' and even if you can't do that, there are all kinds of programs out there, hell I know a few if you know the right person, you can buy your MD.

816fb728b40630c7b46d9cb45eaab212aa	Many, many things working in concert. For a typical child to learn to read, for instance, they use their hearing and their vision. And even small problems with those senses or with the way the brain processes the input from those senses can muck up the process. For instance, to learn to read, it helps tremendously to have the ability to hear and discriminate between the sounds of the letters within words. (The most common type of dyslexia is auditory processing, which is when a person has difficulty discriminating between these sounds.) Some children whose vision otherwise seems fine have trouble controlling their eye movements to scan a line of text. If a child has trouble controlling the small muscles within their fingers, which is quite common, they will have trouble learning to write which can, in turn, hinder their ability to read. Writing reinforces the skill of reading and vice versa. Then there is memory, of which there are many types. And attention. Also, children need to understand how to use language. They need to be able to understand and make sense of what they read.

85f8a04f37d029ea0b3c787369afff6faa	Espero que te sirva esta informacion:<br>  <br>  La Via Salaria es la vía romana más antigua de Italia. La sal era para los romanos un producto comercial de suma importancia. La Via Salaria desde las grandes salinas o salitreras de Ostia, pasando los Apeninos, hasta San Benedetto del Tronto en el Adriático. Roma estaba situada en el punto en el que la Via Salaria cruzaba el Tíber. La sal era necesaria para en Roma como conservante y como antiséptico para desinfectar heridas. La sal tenía una importancia religiosa y social. Se usaba como símbolo y rito para estrechar las relaciones sociales: comer sal en comunidad. Arrojar sal por encima del hombro derecho significaba conjurar una maldición.<br>  <br>  Por la Via Salaria transportaban los mercaderes el preciado producto. Los soldados que cuidaban de la seguridad de la ruta de la sal recibían parte de su paga en forma de bolsitas con sal, lo que se llamaba Salarium Argentum, de ahí la palabra salario. <br>  <br>  En Grecia se intercambiaban esclavos por sal, de ahí el dicho “no vale su sal”.<br>  <br>  La palabra latina sal viene de la raíz indoeuropea *sal- ‘sal’ y es un adjetivo sustantivado que significa ‘turbio’, ‘gris sucio’. Este significado tiene todavía la palabra salo en antiguo alto alemán. Antiguamente la sal que se llevaba al mercado era sal si refinar, sucia.<br>  <br>  El salario es la retribución o recompensa que reciben los obreros, trabajadores o criados por sus servicios, mientras que el sueldo se emplea para designar la remuneración asignada a un individuo de forma periódica por razón de su cargo o trabajo. <br>  <br>  Los sueldos se definen como los pagos realizados a los trabajadores sobre una base por hora, mientras que los salarios son cantidades de dinero específicas pagadas semanal, quincenal o mensualmente. Existen diferentes tipos de sistemas de sueldo y salarios: salario fijo, pago por hora de trabajo, tarifa por unidad producida, sistema de pagos por comisiones o bonificaciones. <br>  <br>  Estos dos términos son hoy prácticamente sinónimos. Ambos están tomados del vocabulario de las milicias: sueldo (soldada, soldado), salario (asignación de sal).<br>  <br>  Hay tres grupos de personas con derecho a cobrar: <br>  <br>  Los que trabajan en régimen de productividad cobran un salario.<br>  <br>  Aquellos cuya relación con el que les paga es de servicio cobran un sueldo o paga.<br>  <br>  Los que cobran por su asistencia profesional reciben honorarios.<br>  <br>  +10|`|15cb0d0b750936d63484c56629f59a19aa	creo que antes se pagaba con sal y de ahi viene el termino|`|b154b9bbf5e0780dbad9908f1f499261aa	en no se que antigua civilizacion, en vez de pagar con dinero, pagaban con SAL<br>  <br>  perdona por dar el detalle a medias... es que mi cerebro no da para tanto, jeje|`|1e8c852e810c8d1309963ec823bbae95aa	viene de egipto, el pago por trabajo era con sal esa era la moneda|`|4f6d20bfecd9d45700f1170dd9c557e7aa	Data de mucho tiempo atrás, en una antigua civilización (no sé cual) cuando el pago por las labores a los hombres se les hacía con sal, pues era muy valiosa en aquel momento.

a1b618eecf5148f01401e7648a5fe69faa	I rewrote your story and hope you don't mind.  It had potential but needed editing.  Here you go, I hope you like it.<br>  <br>  My mother has a fairly rigid routine that she follows everyday before she goes to work.  These are things that you notice when you need to plan a strategy for how best to deceive a parent.  These thoughts whirled around in my brain as I made my way through the student parking lot and onto the too quiet, early afternoon streets of suburbia. The clock was ticking towards 2:00 P.M., and I knew that very shortly, my mom would be walking out the door on her way to work and stopping by the mailbox to get the mail.  My mission today was the same as it had been for the last three; get there before she does!  <br>  <br>  I found myself on this day, in the unenviable predicament of having to prevent my mother from discovering that I had deceived her last term.  You see, I haven’t been doing quite as well in school as she might think I am. This is due largely to the fact that she was presented with a report card that was the creation of my wishful thinking, creative mind and a boot-leg copy of Photoshop.  At the time I gave myself full marks for genius!  The graphic design class I had taken last year had paid off HUGE!  Finally a skill that could help out a moderately intelligent, if somewhat less than ambitious engineering student!<br>  <br>  I rounded the corner to my street, my heart racing and sweating bullets.  The mailman had just arrived!  Quickly parking the car I made tracks to the mailbox and was finally rewarded with that letter that had been haunting me now for way too long.  The letter that would inform my mother in that less than friendly, terse vernacular of academia that her loving son was failing three classes!  An impossibility according to my latest photo shopped report card.   I just had to make it two B’s and three A’s.  Cringing at my stupidity I reached for the mailbox and there it was!  I breathed a huge sigh of relief.  I had managed to beat the system and had dodged another bullet.  Life was good!  I had no other place to put the letter, so I stuck it down my pants to dispose of later and as I turned towards the house, I walked right into good old mom!  There are no good answers for "what did you put down your pants son?"  As you can imagine, this scene did not end well.<br>  <br>  By the way:  writing about what you know is the best way to write.  If by focus you mean plot then the plot is how you are planning to deceive your moms.  Setting is your town in whatever year this happened.  By voice do you mean tense?  I believe this is first person.  I'm no English major though.  Good luck.|`|WiaMtrnyaa	it was good but if this is a exact copy of it you need to fix....... the part where  i can get home in time before>2:00 P.M.< which is when my mom >leaves< <br>  <br>  You can revise your 2nd paragraph 1 sentence... the reason i race to check the mail every day after school is because....<br>  <br>  And the part where u make a fake report card and give it to my mom i have >done< it  a couple times..... <br>  <br>  And 3rd paragraph 1 sentence....

5EGm6ZLhaa	It really depends on what you wish to do when you transfer; do you plan on being a business or business related major? If you do then a general student associates with a business emphasis is usually what most schools what you to do in order to get some of the core classes like economics and accounting completed.<br>  <br>  If you plan to major in a science or liberal arts program like psychology, English, History etc then you may be shooting yourself in the foot by undertaking your business emphasis track and should see an adviser about obtaining a liberal arts general studies education to prepare you for transfer.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Business is not a focused area. However, if you are looking to transfer to a university, get a general degree. Some colleges have info on what universities accept as transfer credits which could save some grief. If you want to be an accountant, get a business AS. If you want to do psychology, get a liberal arts degree. But check with the counselor or the university where you wish to attend. <br>  <br>  I have an associates in accounting and bachelor's in psych. They took a lot of my accounting credits as electives, so I was not really behind. <br>  If a university is going to give a four year degree in a specific major, they want those credits to be taken with them. That is outside of the intro coursework.

aab5e67f3aaf5823052c28da21d4361aaa	La  mononucleosi è una malattia febbrile causata dal virus di Epstein-Barr  (EBV),  appartenente alla famiglia degli Herpes virus. Il nome deriva dal fatto che la malattia causa un aumento dei globuli bianchi, in particolare delle cellule mononucleate. Diffusa  soprattutto fra i giovani, può essere contratta in qualsiasi ambiente affollato, essendo estremamente contagiosa; il contagio avviene attraverso la saliva (è detta anche malattia del bacio) e le urine. Il periodo di incubazione varia fra 30 e 50 giorni.<br>  <br>  MononucleosiSpesso il contagio decorre in maniera asintomatica e può essere confusa con altre patologie (come la tonsillite), essendo il sintomo principale rappresentato dalla stanchezza; solo in una minoranza di casi si manifesta con l'ingrossamento dei linfonodi del collo, della nuca, delle ascelle e dell'inguine, mal di gola intenso (a volte con le tonsille ricoperte di muco verdastro), febbre elevata e prolungata (anche due settimane), astenia, esantema (in un paziente su dieci), lieve ingrossamento della milza. Poiché l'origine è virale, gli antibiotici sono sconsigliati (anzi in pazienti sottoposti a trattamento con ampicillina possono comparire chiazze rosate in tutto il corpo), come pure i cortisonici poiché abbassano l'efficienza dei globuli bianchi che svolgono un ruolo importante nella patologia. Sconsigliato pure l'impiego di acido acetilsalicilico (la normale aspirina) per il rischio di sindrome di Reye, una grave forma di encefalopatia acuta. Il decorso è variabile e può andare da dieci a oltre sessanta giorni. Normalmente l'infezione si risolve da sola; per i casi più gravi è possibile impiegare antivirali dell'ultima generazione (aciclovir).<br>  <br>  Se ciò non ti bastasse puoi sempre fare una ricerca su Internet molto più approfondita, ma quanto ti ho detto mi sembra sufficente, no??<br>  Ciao ciao|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	la malattia del bacio..almeno cosi la chiamano..|`|48d34c1c15ea1db5b08daf845e6415bbaa	la cd. malattia del bacio si trasmette con la saliva e da febbre e infiammazione dei linfonodi....con loro ingrossamento, va tenuta sotto controllo perchè si scambia per semplice influenze..il mio ex fidanzato allìetà di 17 anni l'ha contratta ed è finito allìospedale..e io invece non ho rpeso nulla nonostante ci baciavamo.|`|Fw4NT3nFaa	la chiamano anche malattia del bacio perché si trasmette con la saliva, ma la puoi prendere non solo baciando, ma anche bevendo dalla bottiglia di uno che la ha.<br>  Solitamente provoca gonfiore alla gola e febbre.<br>  La maggior parte guarisce.<br>  In questi giorni, però, un mio amico è morto, per mononucleosi.

Molto più rare sono la rottura traumatica della milza ingrossata, la meningite e l'encefalite.<br>  Non esiste terapia specifica. Misure generali di trattamento sono il riposo e la somministrazione di antipiretici; a volte, in caso di enorme aumento della milza, può essere indicata la somministrazione di cortisonici.

Il virus di Epstein-Barr è stato, infatti, associato con un gran numero di malattie, anche neoplastiche, per molte delle quali è ormai definitivamente accertato il suo ruolo eziopatogenetico. In alcuni individui, probabilmente predisposti per cause congenite o acquisite che alterano la risposta immunitaria contro il virus, l'infezione primaria non è controllata ed il virus di Epstein-Barr continua a replicarsi provocando un'infezione cronica attiva (CAEBV) di cui si conoscono forme molto gravi o severe (SCAEBV). Questa sindrome ha avuto diverse definizioni, anche perché si sovrappone con altre non ben definite come la sindrome da stanchezza cronica e la sindrome da emofagocitosi EBV correlata. Contrariamente a quanto asserito negli anni passati, nei pazienti con CAEBV si segnalano sempre più frequentemente neoplasie linfoidi originate dalle cellule T e dalle cellule NK e non dai linfociti B, come generalmente si osserva nelle malattie linfoproliferative post-trapianto EBV positive.<br>  <br>  In rarissimi casi, e di quei pochi quasi sempre limitatamente alle donne, la mononucleosi può portare ad una sindrome da stanchezza cronica a causa degli squilibri che questa può apportare al sistema endocrino, che è concretamente una malattia invalidante ma comunque diagnosticabile.<br>  <br>  <br>  Consigli<br>  <br>  è importante, se la malattia viene identificata, evitare di fare troppi sforzi per un periodo di almeno 3 mesi per assicurarsi che il decorso sia terminato in quanto il virus tende a far ingrossare la milza, che nei casi peggiori, può rompersi.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nella maggior parte dei casi comunque la malattia decorre in maniera asintomatica come avviene per la maggior parte della popolazione. La diffusione di questo tipo di virus è - secondo le statistiche - maggiore di quello che si potrebbe pensare e si ritiene che il 90% della popolazione adulta sia entrata in qualche modo a contatto con il virus ricavandone una immunizzazione.<br>  <br>  I più soggetti alla infezione - sempre secondo le statistiche - sono i giovani.<br>  <br>  Estratto da "http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononucleo...

Era una persona intelligente perchè cecava di mettere l'alunno a proprio agio nelle interrogazioni. Ogni tanto faceva delle battute e riusciva a mantere viva l'attenzione di tutti. Era riuscito a stabilire un bel rapporto con gli studenti. Sembrava uno di noi. Non faceva quasi mai pesare il fatto di essere sopra di te. Era un Grande! Ovviamente dall'altra parte aveva rispetto. Penso che questo (il rispetto) non debba mai mancare ne da una parte (studenti) ne dall'altra (insegnanti).|`|HtLWCbFFaa	io penso che gli insegnanti dovrebbero cercare di capire un po di piu i propri aglievi cioe non solo al livello professionale in modo che poi si crea un'intesa fra prof e allievo|`|bc496853bed3e0dd54bcecb81e909827aa	Gli insegnanti e gli studenti sono sempre stati su due sponde opposte, il ponte che li dovrebbe collegare è la famiglia ma oggi è un'utopia...|`|iTnXF39Caa	l'insegnante e' stato a sua volta alunno,<br>   capita spesso di incontrare insegnanti <br>  che non sono genitori<br>  gli insegnanti, per loro stare dietro una cattedra  e' l'inizio della fine.<br>  l'arrivo per esercitare il loro egoismo del  conoscere, <br>  io "so' ", tu no.      e ti boccio se non lo sai anche tu.<br>  ed ora tutti a scuola di latino con zaini pieni di fumo da vendere
lA9HL0Ugaa	Ce n'est plus un secret pour personne, le BAC n'a plus la même valeur... Maintenant de dire que c'est plus un manque de travail, l'enseignement ou l'incapacité de l'élève... c'est assez fasctidieux de répondre à cette question puisqu'il faudrait voir au cas par cas... <br>  Je pense que même si on travaille on peut perdre ses moyens à cause du stress, facteur important qu'on a tendance à oublier. Même si le BAC est plus facile qu'il y a, je ne sais pas moi, 7 ans, il n'empêche qu'un dipl?me est à la clé!<br>  Aprés de dire qu'il s'agit d'un enseignement déficiant... des professeurs qui donnent envie d'apprendre, d'étudier, et d'autres qui dégo?tent de la matière qu'ils enseignent, ?a a toujours existé!<br>  Des élèves idiots? C'est s?r que certains ont plus de difficulté que d'autres. Mais de là à dire "idiots", n'éxagérons pas^^ Si à force de travail et de volonté, rien y fait, c'est que la série dans laquelle ils sont n'est pas faite pour eux (dans le cas, par exemple, s'ils sont en série S et qu'ils loupent les maths... idem pour un série Es qui loupe l'éco...)!

DaokQBKhaa	"Yes" is actually a reasonable answer - it certainly would be early or late. <br>  <br>  I guess it depends on the gift giver's reason for giving you the xmas present.

MkpoqZ5zaa	An equivalent expression for y + 8 would be 8 + y.  12 - r does not work.  See below for explanation:  <br>  <br>  The Commutative Properties of  Addition and Multiplication <br>  a + b = b + a       and      ab = ba<br>   <br>  The Commutative Property, in general, states that changing the ORDER of  two numbers either being added or multiplied, does NOT change the value of it.  The two sides are called equivalent expressions because they look different but have the same value.<br>  <br>  Note:  The commutative property DOES NOT work with the operations division or subtraction, ONLY addition and multiplication.

Lei, dopo un pò, le ha detto che aveva visto due suoi compagnetti che litigavano ed uno dei due ha tirato uno schiaffo o qualcosa del genere all'altro. Colui che ne ha prese è andato dalla maestra a dirglielo e quando la maestra è arrivata ha chiesto come era successo. La bambina della collega ha detto che il bambino "1" aveva picchiato il bambino "2". La maestra, invece che punire i due che si erano "picchiati", ha messo in punizione la bambina perché "aveva fatto la spia e si era perciò comportata da cattiva".<br>  Sua mamma ci ha messo una cifra di tempo a spiegarle che aveva sbagliato la maestra e che a volte fare la spia a fin di bene non fa essere più cattive.<br>  Io sono rimasta allibita, prima di tutto perché i bambini non sono mai "cattivi" ma agiscono in preda all'istinto (casomai sono agitati, il termine cattivo mi sembra talmente dispregiativo che mio figlio non sa ancora nemmeno cosa significa) e poi perché la bambina è veramente rimasta sconvolta per l'atteggiamento della maestra, che dovrebbe essere per lei un punto di riferimento...!!!<br>  Dove andremo a finire di questo passo?

gT0Cc9IHaa	Ti scrivo quello che sono riuscita a trovare. Mi sembra una fonte affidabile.<br>  <br>  1.<br>  Il significato è “si divide il conto in parti uguali”.<br>  Il detto si colloca nel contesto del Giubileo.<br>  In particolare, nel corso dell’800, la massa dei pellegrini finiva per riversarsi nelle “Osterie” fuori porta, dove, all’insegna della tipica “frasca”, veniva servito, su lunghe tavolate , un unico “menu”,solitamente composto da portate semplici della cucina tipica locale,arricchito da un buon vino dei “Castelli Romani”.<br>  Tale condizione di promiscuità dell’avventore e di occasionalità dell’evento (in assenza di camerieri e ad evitare di dover fare,cosa ancor più difficile per l’epoca, i conti a ciascuno) induceva l’oste a praticare un prezzo “unico” per tutta la tavolata. E quindi,a fine pasto,considerata anche l’omogeneità del menu , presentava, –tassativamente “a voce”- , il conto di ciascuna tavolata.<br>  Di conseguenza, gli avventori erano costretti a dividere , pagando “tanto a testa” .<br>  Nel ‘900, con l’avvento di trattorie e ristoranti e di un servizio più qualificato,tale usanza è andata via via scomparendo,fatta eccezione per qualche comitiva di “ragazzi” o di quei gruppi di avventori forestieri,i quali, ritenendo che l’origine del detto fosse riferita –come non lo è- alle “abitudini”di comportamento della popolazione romana, continuavano e continuano ad usare tale “modalità di compensazione del conto”, anzichè sottostare a quel vincolo di “ospitalità ”,che, per un vero romano, era e rimane “sacra” , e del tutto estranea al detto di cui trattasi.<br>  <br>  2. <br>  Ho trovato un'altra domanda uguale (e anche le risposte!!) qui su anwers. Dai un' occhiata.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060622033434AAjnOlr">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|i7zEocqbaa	pagare alla romana,signifika ke ognuno paga ciò ke ha consumato,x spiegare qst espressione bisogna rialire all'epoka dei romani,si dice infatti ke qst'ultimi  fossero molto cordiali ed ospitali ma anke molto attenti ai soldi e fiskali....cia ciaaaaaaaa|`|lcLwTvuTaa	ciao... ti sei offeso? bacino :-(|`|HpWDHI4laa	A Roma si paga "alla romana" (ognuno paga esattamente quello che ha consumato) perché gli amici romani sono molto fiscali e attenti ai dettagli. Stranamente, però, a Milano non si paga "alla milanese", a Firenze non si paga "alla fiorentina" e a Napoli non si paga proprio. Alcuni sostengono che in realtà la frase "pagare alla romana" deriva da un'osteria di Trastevere in cui la "Sora Pina" era solita picchiare preventivamente con il bastone della scopa tutti i turisti che entravano nel locale per convincerli a pagare il conto con solerzia, da cui "Meglio pagare la cena alla romana".<br>  <br>  ps. chiedo scusa a napoletani, che per altro mi sono pure simpatici... è una battuta e fateve na ca..o de risata ;0)
ShhSpZjJaa	Well, I am not yet an OT but I am in the occupational therapy program, so i may be able to answer some of your questions. School is not too bad, the hardest courses are gross anatomy and neuro-anatomy, which are extremely difficult, the thing is though, that if you go full time, you are in school basically 4-5 days a week- all day, which leaves little room for work, or leisure. Plus, the minimum to be an OT is now a masters degree. So you'll be poor for a few years until you graduate. It is sooo worth it though, jobs are in demand BIG TIME. I saw an opening for an OT recently that included an $8000 sign on bonus, which is pretty rare these days! The more classes I take the more I enjoy the field, there are soo many settings you can work in, you never get bored. As far as pay goes, I am seeing right now that the average hourly wage is around $28-35 hr. If you have been in the field for a while I'm sure it can go much higher. I hope you got what you were looking for in my answer, best of luck!

4a82252f380573f92eb2ac8bdbd8b46baa	E' una frase illogica (si può dimostrarlo anche matematicamente, come ha fatto Lancan, ma te lo risparmio). L'assurdità sta nel fatto che il cogito non comprende il sum, né in un essere pensante (che non si riduce al solo cogito), né, a maggior ragione in un essere non pensante, come una pianta o una pietra. Se il cogito comprendesse il sum di dovrebbe poter dire anche "non cogito ergo non sum" (come "non sono europeo quindi non sono italiano"), ma se non sono come posso dire di non pensare e se non penso come posso dire di non essere? Però la frase di Cartesio che riduce la realtà alla realtà pensata da un io pensante apre la strada al pensiero scientifico classico, a quella concezione strettamente razionale e meccanicistica della natura (res extensa sed non cogitans) che ha senso solo in quanto esiste un io pensante (res cogitans sed non extensa), in altre parole l'anima raziocinante. In seguito pure questo io pensante diventerà superfluo e resterà la pura azione del pensare (la ragion pura di Kant) e il mondo apparirà solo come mondo pensato, secondo i dettami logici. Ma in tal modo si porranno le premesse per far sparire l'anima stessa dalla scena del mondo affinché il mondo appaia nella sua completa oggettività. Infatti se all'io pensante si riferisce tutto il reale, l'io pensante svanisce oltre l'orizzonte del reale e diviene superfluo. Si aprirà così la strada per quella riduzione matematica, quantitativa e poi tecnica del mondo che inspira il sistema in cui viviamo oggi in occidente.|`|841fdbf09ecfa50c6587a626566a8eeeaa	giusto|`|142f6fe2710f9a412fa5d4403e74ccbcaa	COITO..........ergo sum!|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Che il buon Cartesio doveva essere una persona abbastanza staccata da se stesso sentendosi vivo solo attraverso i pensieri.

Adquisición de conductas prosociales. Desarrollo de la ética social.

mYhuGonfaa	The certification requirements will vary from state to state. You'll certainly have to either take a government and US history class or pass a written test, even to substitute most places.  There are programs like Teach for America in which many of the teachers aren't actually certified, so it might be easier to get into a program like that, but they send you to an urban setting in a likely inner-city school, not sure if that's a task you want to undertake. Good luck!|`|27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	as far as the us goes (i cannot speak for canada) i know you'd probably need to learn us history, because the government is quite proud of it and teaching is a government job. geography, we're not as concerned with. also, if i'm not mistaken the type of degree that's required here depends on the state, all states are different. but in the state i live in the requirements sound the same, a bachelor's degree in education followed by some tests, i don't know if the certification you get there would qualify you here, you might need to take another certification here.
uMbm4Ztjaa	A conceit is a metaphor... only the metaphor is extended and logical.  As you probably already know, a metaphor compares two things that are unlike and creates a comparison or a connection - without using like or as.  (for example: You are my sun.)  A conceit takes the metaphor to another level.  It is no longer just one line.  It becomes several lines - thus the "extended" metaphor. <br>  <br>  Okay, so now you have to compare two processes and create a 25 line conceit poem. (There is a famous conceit poem by Donne that compares lovers to the parts of a compass!)  Honestly, I don't think you should try to get too deep.  Pick something simple like the different times of a day  in the context of the stages of a relationship.  (example: the sun peeking over the horizon is the boy's first glance at the girl.)<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|O1MITmaGaa	I just searched "conceit poem" on Google...here's a site that might help.<br>  <br>  Write about anything you can think of...anything that interests you - maybe that might be easier in making up "vivid images" and "word pictures."

cstW6JLIaa	If you want to go to a CC first, be sure you complete all of the general education courses before applying to IU. This way, you'll enter IU as a third-year junior and not a freshman.<br>  <br>  To make it easier for you, get all of the general education courses out of the way, including ones that aren't necessarily required. For example, at my school, Political Science 1 is not a required GE class, but it is required at a four-year university. I took it at community college instead -- that way, I wouldn't have to take it later.<br>  <br>  See a counselor at your CC as soon as possible to discuss your education plan. You can map out exactly which classes you must take to transfer to IU in a timely fashion.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it is "easier" to transfer from a CC to a four-year rather than going straight out of high school. Here are some of my reasons:<br>  <br>  1. LESS EXPENSIVE!<br>  2. First-hand college experience <br>  3. Less-stressful environment<br>  4. Opportunity to gain work experience<br>  <br>  Four-year universities love transfer students because they're typically better suited for college by the time they enroll. Transfer students have better heads on their shoulders than freshmen and are less likely to drop out OR to constantly be switching majors.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10114970	It is generally easier to get in as a transfer student in any school.
xJoMSkI5aa	"Wisely and slow – they stumble that run fast," a priest warns an impetuous young lover in Romeo and Juliet. But nobody spends much time pausing to think in Romeo and Juliet. Passionate love and passionate hatred propel the characters to immediate action.

11bAlE1qaa	You have two unknowns: the amount of the 5% dressing (x) and the amount of the 15% dressing (y).  So you need two equations.  Think about it like this:  In the final mixture, 5% of x is pure vinegar, and 15% of y is pure vinegar.  So in the total mixture (x+y), the sum of the vinegar contributions from each dressing must equal 13% of x+y.  The second equation you need is simply x+y = 320.  If you use that information to substitute (320-x) for y in the first equation you can solve the problem.  I'll leave it to you to set up the first equation.

r5jPuTleaa	A common theme may be how vaulting ambition can take over a person. In Macbeth, Macbeth used to be a loyal thane, but eventually he sees an opportunity for power and commits treacherous deeds to become king. <br>  <br>  Lord of Flies has two divisions ,Jack and Ralph. They both see a power to lead and they too commit crimes like murder to get to high position. They almost go to war for their ambition to become lead the castaways .<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you. Good luck tomorrow.<br>  <br>  UPDATE FOR PART 2:<br>  There is a quote you could use. The only one that comes to mind is from Macbeth<br>  <br>  "I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself, and falls on the other." - ( Quote Act I, Scene VII).|`|AA11151169	Power overwhelms.

The most useful part of testing is identifying those students who are good test-takers because they are the ones likely to be successful in college, where they will be taking lots of tests.<br>  <br>  The OGT is especially bad, because they set the bar so low, and the teachers teach to the test, instead of helping the kids develop critical thinking skills.    I fear for anyone in Ohio who thinks passing that test is an indicator of potential success in life.

But before you decided to sign up for a online class make sure that they will accept it because some degrees require that you take a speech course and it has to be in class so check with the advisor before applying for the online class.

Call the local school board, they have all of the information and requirements. <br>  <br>  Although you didn't mention why he missed all of those days, he should be more focused simply getting a diploma and not worry about from where. If he was lazy and or didn't go to school that's what happens.  <br>  <br>  The other option would be to have him get his GED and start taking classes at the local community college. The community college classes would at least give him the freedom and responsibility of choosing his own future. If he doesn't want to go to school and miss days he can, but its on him.  If he has no interest in college or going to school in general, don't force him, there no point.

z6I2dW84aa	eccoti versione e traduzione:<br>  Il padrone ha cento occhi<br>  <br>  Cervus, venatores fugiens, caeco timore perterritus, ad proximam villam contendit, oppurtune in bubili se condidit et a bobus auxilium petivit. Huic boves dixerunt:"Quidnam quaeris, infelix? Cui te committis? Ultro ad necem curris, si in hominis tectum intras. Nescisse hominem omnium animalium dominum esse?". Vos, amici, me adiuvate - inquit cervus -; nemo me videbit; fugiam ubi primum potero". Paulo post (poco dopo) bubulcus quidam frondes in bubile infert sed nihil videt. Eunt redeuntque omnes servi nec quisquam animadvertit cervum; venit etiam vilicus nec qicquam sentit. Tum cervus contentus gratias agit bobus, quia quieti fuerant. Respondet unus: "Si salvs fueris, laeti erimus;sed quis hoc dicere potest, antequam venerit (cong. perfetto) ille, qui centum (cento) oculos habet?". Post cenam dominus ipse in bubile venit,accedit ad presepe et, ubique inquirens, alta cervi cornua videt eumque occidit.<br>  Quid haec fabella significat? Nemo plus quam dominus videt.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Un cervo, fuggendo dai cacciatori, terrorizzato da un cieco timore, si affrettò verso una fattoria vicina, si nascose opportunamente in una stalla e chiese aiuto ai buoi. I buoi dissero a questo: “Che cosa mai chiedi, infelice? A chi ti affidi? Tu corri spontaneamente verso la morte, se entri nella casa dell’uomo. Ignori che l’uomo è il padrone di tutti gli animali?”. “Voi, amici, aiutatemi – disse il cervo – nessuno mi vedrà, fuggirò appena potrò”. Poco dopo un bovaro getta del fieno nella stalla ma non vede nulla. Vanno e vengono tutti i servi ma nessuno bada al cervo; arriva anche il fattore ma non sente nulla. Allora il cervo felice ringrazia i buoi, poiché erano stati tranquilli. Risponde uno: “Se sarai salvo, saremo felici, ma chi può dire ciò, prima che sia arrivato quello, che ha cento occhi?”. Dopo cena il padrone stesso arriva nella stalla, si avvicina alla mangiatoia e, osservando in ogni luogo, vede le alte corna del cervo e lo uccide.Cosa significa questa favola? Nessuno vede più che il padrone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://world2.monstersgame.it/?ac=vid&vid=42082672" rel="nofollow">http://world2.monstersgame.it/?ac=vid&vi...</a>|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	greco o latino?

b85dd8b78a83eadb97d845f6045633f7aa	T-lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow, after which they mature in the spleen. There is no fixed site of action, they are present in the bloodstream where they circulate through the whole body and deal with any foreign bodies that might enter the bloodstream. T cells sometimes migrate into the tissues if there is a localised infection. Their main function are to destroy the foreign bodies that might cause disease and to create a sort of 'chemical memory' so that the next time the same 'germ' attacks, the body's response will be faster. <br>  <br>  This is a very generic description of the life cycle of a T cell. Each of your questions fill up a chapter in any decent Immunology book, so it would be a good idea to get hold of one and read up for more info.

mdUY0xehaa	Ohhh, lovely Dial-up. I assume you have AOL. (I feel your pain.)<br>  Well, this is basically something that AOL created to make it easier for you. Some people have it so that they can only use so many minutes a month online to pay a certain rate. However, they may be running late and they need to download a file, and want it to be on their computer, while they go do something else.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  Denise wants her uncompleted Chemistry Lab from her lab partner. Her lab partner sent it to her email. Denise is late for a dance class, so she leaves her file downloading so that when she gets home it will be on her computer. Denise also does not want to keep her phone line tied up, so she wants it to sign off right after it is done.<br>  <br>  Back to the explanation:<br>  If you cilck that box, it will sign off right after the download is completed.<br>  You can unclick and click that box as many times as you want UNTIL that download is finished.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!

Come il suo corpo è immobile dopo aver esalato l'ultimo respiro, così è immobile ed attonita tutta la terra alla notizia della morte di un uomo così potente e resta muta, pensando all'ultima ora dell'uomo che è stato così importante e non sa quando nascerà un altro uomo di tale calibro e che ha sparso tanto sangue<br>  Il mio genio poetico (cioè io stesso) lo ha visto folgorante, vincitore ed in auge, ma ha taciuto e così ha continuato a tacere anche quando, con alterne è caduto ad è ritornato potente e non ha unito la sua voce a quella di altri poeti che lo osannavano o lo condannavano.<br>  Così Manzoni dice che il suo spirito poetico pulito e limpido sia da  servili lodi, che da vigliacchi oltraggi e solo ora, commosso per la repentina morte, scrive un'ode su quest' uomo così importante che forse resisterà nel tempo.<br>  Ricorda le rapidissime campagne di Napoleone, come un fulmine, che coinvolsero tutta l'Europa fino all'Egitto, dall'uno all'altro mare.<br>  Fu vera gloria? Lasciamo ai posteri la difficile sentenza, mentre noi chiniamo il capo al divino valore che volle in Napoleone, dar un segno più grande del suo sfinito creatore.<br>  La tempestosa e trepida gloria di un grandissimo disegno, l'ansia di un cuore che serve impaziente pensando di divenire re e poi vi giunge e ottiene un premio che sarebbe stato una follia sperare.<br>  Egli provò tutto: la più grande gloria dopo il pericolo la fuga e la vittoria; provò ad essere re e anche l'esilio fu due volte sconfitto nella polvere e due volte vincitore.<br>  Egli si diede nome: due secoli così diversi tra loro si rivolsero a lui docili, come aspettando il loro destino; egli fece silenzio e si sedette tra loro come arbitro.<br>  Nonostante tanta grandezza, improvvisamente scomparve e finì la sua vita in ozio, prigioniero in una piccola isola ed egli suscita ancora grande invidia e profonda pietà, grande odio e grande amore.<br>  Come sul capo del naufragio si rovescia e pesa l'onda dove poco prima scorreva la vista del naufragio a cercare terre lontane, così sull'anima di Napoleone è sceso il peso delle memorie.<br>  Oh , quante volte ha iniziato a scrivere le sue memorie! E quante volte su quelle pagine cadde la sua stanca mano! Quante volte al tramonto stette con gli occhi bassi e le braccia conserte e lo assalì la malinconia e il ricordo del passato!<br>  E allora ripensò agli accampamenti sempre spostati da un posto all'altro, alle trincee, lo scintillare delle armi e l'avanzare della cavalleria e i suoi secchi comandi e come questi venivano soddisfatti rapidamente.<br>  Ah, forse a tanto dolore cadde il suo spirito e si disperò, ma valido venne l'aiuto di Dio, che lo trasportò pietroso in un'aria più respirabile.<br>  E lo guidò per i floridi sentieri delle speranze verso i campi eterni, lo guidò verso la beatitudine eterna, che supera qualunque desiderio umano, lo guidò verso quel luogo dove la gloria terrena non vale nulla.<br>  Bella, immortale, benefica fede, così solita a trionfare.<br>  Scrivi anche questo tuo trionfo, rallegrati perché nessuna personalità più grande si è mai chinata davanti alla croce.<br>  Tu, o fede, allontana dalle stanche spoglie di quest'uomo ogni parola malvagia: il Dio che può tutto, che ci dà i dolori e ci consola si è posato accanto a lui, per consolarlo nel momento della sua morte. <br>  <br>  PENTECOSTE<br>  Chiesa, Madre dei Santi, tu che rappresenti il regno dei cieli, tu che sei da sempre la custode del sangue di Cristo, che combatti dolorosamente e preghi da secoli(per difendere e diffondere la parola di Dio) in qualunque parte del mondo, sede di coloro che sperano. Dove eri, schiera dei fedeli di Gesù? Dove eri alla tua nascita, quando Gesù veniva ucciso dai suoi traditori bagnando con il proprio sangue la terra del colle Golgota, quasi un altare alto e sublime. Quando Gesù è re suscitato ed è passato alla vita eterna e quando è salito nel regno di Dio padre portando con se le sofferenze della crocifissione. il suo sacrificio per ottenere il perdono di Dio agli uomini: dove eri Chiesa, simbolo eterno della sua vittoria sul male. tu che sei partecipe nel suo dolore e consapevole dei misteri della fede? Preoccupata solo per le tue paure, rassicurata solo dalla speranza di essere dimenticata, sei rimasta nascosta nel cenacolo fino al giorno in cui discese su di te lo Spirito Santo, rinnovatore del mondo, che riaccese in te l'inestinguibile fiducia della fede; quando ti mise in evidenza come guida dei popoli e fece uscire dalle labbra degli Apostoli il messaggio di Dio.<br>  <br>  Come la luce si diffonde rapidamente su ogni cosa e, dovunque si posa, illumina e mostra i diversi<br>  <br>  colori, così la voce dello Spirito Santo si espresse in molte lingue e sentì la propria.<br>  <br>  Voi che praticate l'iconoclastia, diffiIsi in ogni regione, guardate verso Gerusalernrne e ascoltate la predicazione evangelica: gli uomini stanchi dello spregevole culto degli idoli ritornano a Dio.<br>  <br>  E voi,le spose con in grembo i figli della nuova generazione, destate dall'improvviso muoversi del feto nascosto nel vostro ventre, che siete prossime a liberarlo partorendo con dolore; non rivolgete preghiere a Giunone Lucina, falsa divinità pagana protettrice delle partorienti, perche il figlio che cresce dentro di voi è già consacrato a Dio. Perchè la schiava baciando i figli si preoccupa per il loro destino e invidia la donna libera che nutre i suoi bambini? Non sa che Dio ha riservato il suo regno ai più poveri e che ha sofferto per tutti gli uomini? Dio assicura una nuova libertà ed un popolo spiritualmente nuovo, nuove conquiste non più materiali ed una nuova gloria ottenuta in battaglie più nobili, una nuova pace, che resiste alle minacce ed alle tentazioni, che il mondo disprezza ma che non può portar via. O Spirito Santo, noi tutti tuoi fedeli presso i luoghi sacri a te dedicati, soli in selve inospitali, sperduti in distese desolate, dalle gelide Ande al Libano, dall'lrlanda alla selvaggia Haiti, sparsi in tutti in luoghi, uniti grazie a te nel sentimento della fede. Ti imploriamo di scendere di nuovo sul mondo, o mite spirito,<br>  <br>  benevolo con i tuoi fedeli e con chi non crede ancora in te. Giungi e fai rinascere una nuova vita, rassicura gli animi tormentati dal dubbio e tu sii, vincitore, una divina ricompensa per coloro che si sono fatti dominare da te. Discendi Amore, attutisci l' ira e la superbia degli animi; concedi all'uomo quei pensieri che quando morirai non rinnegherà: la Grazia Divina, generosa con gli uomini, alimenti i doni che ci; come il sole fa rinascere il flore dal seme che da solo non ce la farebbe a crescere perchè lento ad aprirsi; il fiore che morirà non raccolto sull'erba bassa, e non risorgeranno quei luminosi colori della corolla aperta, se, svanita nell'aria la luce nel sole, che crea la vita e che nutre senza stancarsi, non tornerai ad illuminarlo. Noi ti imploriamo! Scendi come un vento piacevole e consolatore nei pensieri degli afflitti; impetuoso come una bufera, scendi per travolgere i pensieri colmi di superbia del violento; infondi in lui un turbamento che gli insegni ad avere pietà del prossimo.<br>  <br>  Grazie al povero alzi gli occhi al cielo che gli è destinato, e nel lamento esprimi la tua gioia nel pensare di essere simile al lui nella sua umiltà, colui al quale furono donate ricchezze in abbondanza, con quel riservato silenzio, che rende gradito il dono.<br>  <br>  Spirito Santo che sei nel sorriso indicibilmente puro ed innocente dei nostri bambini, fai comparire<br>  <br>  sui visi delle giovani donne il rossore che indica modestia e purezza; trasmetti gioie spirituali e pure alle suore rinchiuse nei conventi. consacri l'amore colmo di pudore delle spose.<br>  <br>  Aiuta i giovani coraggiosi a trovare l'equilibrio del loro carattere colmo di entusiasmo. Sorreggi le intenzioni degli uomini adulti in modo di farle giungere a buon fine.<br>  <br>  Ai vecchi ispira desideri puri, risplendi nello sguardo assente di colui che sta morendo nella speranza di far parte di una nuova vita eterna.
