O0AfxH9Eaa	A potato ricer? <br>  Mini icecream maker? I have one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-BH-941P-Ice-Cream-Maker/dp/B000BDGUT6" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-BH-941...</a> and it's fab. I'm assuming she has a freezer.
1qKvCldEaa	I think the first thing you ought to consider is buying a washable Nammor hose. For one thing they are double thick which means more flavor per pull, and for another, they are extremely durable and capable of washing out strong flavors such as coffee. <br>  <br>  When you fill your base, fill it about an inch above where the pipe starts. When you pack your bowl, make sure you take out all stems (thick and skinny), break apart your tobacco with your fingers, and rip any large leaves into smaller pieces, fill it just over the top. <br>  <br>  Put the foil over it shiny side down with as little amount of wrinkles as you can. <br>  <br>  My favorite tool for making holes is a mechanical pencil. Push the led out with one or two clicks, sharpen it flat by rubbing it on a piece of paper, then push the wholes through right up to to the smallest part of the plastic. The smaller the holes, the less ash from the coals. Coal ash gives your shisha a funky flavor. <br>  <br>  I also recommend buying a coal heater for natural coals as they are better for your health and shisha taste than quick light. DO NOT PULL on a quick light coal as it lights up!! This will cause extreme discomfort to the throat and nasal passages.<br>  <br>  If it seems like you're not getting enough smoke, try putting cold water or ice cubes in the bottom. This also may be caused by an air leak, check where the hose connects, a tissue should work fine. <br>  <br>  If you want more flavor, allow your water to warm up to room temperature. If you put anything besides water in the base, make sure that it does not take up more than 1/4 of the base, fill the rest with water (filtration). <br>  <br>  When buying replacement parts and extras for your hookah, I recommend using <a href="http://www.hookah-shisha.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookah-shisha.com</a> It's an awesome site not only because of the large variety of merchandise, but because of the great benefits you get for shopping there.|`|cc3de441467bd3591cbacd40337caeccaa	hummmm. well deff clean it after every use. i used to run hot water through the hoses but i guess ur not supposed to do that but a lot of crap always came out so idk thats up to you. i put ice cubes in the bottom, idk why i jsut do, i like to think it makes the smoke thicker but it probably dosent lol. jones soda is the best thing you can put in the bottom. 2 coals are better than one and make lots of tiny holes in the foil not a few big ones.... but yes always clean it. i cleaned after every single use and a bunch of crap came out each time.|`|F32uPjAraa	Connect your hair dryer to it. This will act the same way a super charger on a motor does.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Why did you waste your money like that?|`|HoHHpwDlaa	first of all, congrats on your new hookah! Also, i love the thorough answerers from ishquab and nick. :] hooray for people who know what they're talking about. <br>  <br>  So yeah, along the lines of what nick was talking about, MOST DEF clean after every use or every two uses. <br>  <br>  How To Clean Your Hookah - Beginners Guide - Part I<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvqnpUcEJ-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvqnpUcEJ...</a><br>  How To Clean Your Hookah - Beginners Guide - Part II<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0VRJp0DUUY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0VRJp0DU...</a><br>  Those helped me a lot when i first got mine. <br>  <br>  Some other things are Coals and Shisha. <br>  Here's a link.

As was seen in prohibition days you will never stop people getting alcohol if they want it but at least it would help some people behave more responsibly.<br>  <br>  As for the government making money out of the taxes on drinking and smoking, what they take in is far outweighed by the cost to the NHS and the police force treating these idiots.|`|v01ly2Ggaa	i hope it does, it will make a nights out much better.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it should be, works out well in the states. 8 0 ) I can't believe other countries let kids drink so young.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	In the UK you can vote at 18,  get married without parental consent and you can also become a soldier and die for your country. At 18 you are considered to be an adult. Being an adult is supposed to mean that you are capable of taking responsibility for your own actions. <br>  Raising the alcohol consumption age to 21, would imply that, you are not mature enough to make the right decisions. You should not be able to vote, marry, drive a car or give your life for your country (or someone else's). You can't have it all ways.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	No way. There's too much money being made from selling alcohol to under 21's. I'm thinking how much my brother and his friends spend a week going out and drinking.|`|AA11685726	No the government makes too much money from it. Just like smoking.|`|u13dNQz5aa	I've done some research into it because i only turned 18 last November so i would have been slightly annoyed if they did after being a legal drinker for a few months only to have it taken away from me for another 3 years.<br>  <br>  From what i found (mainly the BBC) it looks like it won't be happening but instead there might be a higher tax on alcoholic drinks.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that raising the age would stop underage drinking. One example is smoking the age got raised but underage smokers are still very common, there should be better education on alcohol to help prevent it or not make it so bad. making alcohol more expensive would help it but it would empty my wallet faster|`|GrcL8y8Eaa	well they raised smoking from 16 to 18 the government should try sorting out the countrys problems rather than blame it on alcohol and drugs|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Probably not. It's 18 now and we've already got 12 year old having their stomachs pumped for crying out loud. A raise in the legal age won't make one difference whatsoever.|`|gSmrE8scaa	It's highly unlikely that will happen.|`|88a2e933993f652ca67674dcbd1fceacaa	It better hadn't|`|TWm5Smlaaa	I hope not, I can legally buy alcohol there...If I lived there.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	mybe dunno|`|y65a48yuaa	I don,t now when but I think it will a good thing all them children out of our pubs|`|yOsBSqDUaa	From what i've heard recently, it won't be, and as an 18 year old, I can breath a sigh of relief. If it was raised, under 21's would still access alcohol from people old enough to buy it for them, or by taking it from their parents drinks cabinets. The only effect of raising the drinking age would be preventing under 21's from entering bars and nightclubs, which would probably cause most of them to close, especially in university cities. Most pubs seem too relaxed to enforce the laws anyway. In our local pub we've been drinking there since we were 17, they just never bother to check for I.D's.<br>  <br>  Instead of raising the legal drinking age, the government should focus on raising taxes on alcohol, as well as other ''negative'' products, such as tobacco. By increasing prices, people will be unable to afford as much alcohol, reducing the number of drinkers, regardless of age, from getting drunk enough to cause trouble. This would also give the government more money from taxes that could be invested in public services, like health, education, emergency services or reducing our environmental impact......<br>  <br>  Or they could just piss it all away bailing out the next bank that collapses?<br>  <br>  <br>  (Also, i'm not rich, raising the taxes would still reduce my own drink intake. But I'd be happy to pay more for a drink if I knew the extra money was being used well, and not just wasted as so much of it has lately)|`|Pr51yi8vaa	thats just hear say it will never be raised to 21 especially in the current economic climate as the government gain far to much tax and revenue from people between the age of 18-21.  How would clubs/ pubs survive with only people over 21 they wouldnt.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and have travelled to France and was in a French Wine club for many years, because of the laws over there, all sparkling wines from other areas have to be labelled Cremant, Mousseline or other, they are just the local wine either naturally fermented or done in the charmat way in a large tank, Cremant d'Alsace is a local wine that is just carbonated, it is alot lighter than champagne in France or the US, Henkell Troken is nicer, Chopin another french sparkling wine is very nice also.<br>  <br>  I bought my grandparents back in the 1970 a bottle of Mumms champagne, and my grandmother quipped I should have just gotten a bottle of Ginger Ale, not knowning I paid $20 for the one she so callously poo-poo-ed.|`|AA11610779	Well, it depends on the brand. But it's true that it's not that tasty. However, they advise people that it's better to buy a good Cremant than a cheap bottle of Champagne. It's still cheaper, but at least it's good. I still way prefer Champagne, though.

You can use any sort of milk. Whisk mixture. <br>     <br>  Step Three<br>  Add the flour, one spoonful at a time. Whisk well each time to make a smooth batter. <br>     <br>  The batter should have the consistency of single cream. Test it like this --><br>  Add more milk or flour until it looks right.<br>  <br>  <br>     <br>  Step Four*<br>  Add a few drops of oil to the pan. You can use any oil but light oil is best. <br>  I used light olive oil.<br>  <br>  Wait for the pan to become hot on a high heat.<br>  <br>  <br>     <br>  Step Five<br>  Pour two dessertspoonfuls of the batter into the pan and spread it around with the back of the spoon. Or, pick up the pan and tilt it to spread out the batter. <br>     <br>  It doesn't take long for the first side to cook (~1 minute).<br>  <br>  Test to see if the first side is cooked: lift the pan off the heat and shake it. When the pancake comes away from the pan, it's time to toss.<br>  <br>  <br>     <br>  Cook the other side. Toss the pancake to check if it's cooked. Both sides of the pancake should be golden with brown speckles.<br>  <br>  Remove from the pan.<br>  <br>  Add a drop or two of oil to the pan between each pancake. Stack up cooked pancakes so they stay warm.<br>  <br>  <br>     <br>  Step Six<br>  Squeeze a lemon. Pour a couple of teaspoonfuls onto the cooked pancake and sprinkle all over with sugar. <br>     <br>  Eat!<br>  Roll up the pancake and scoff! This amount of mixture will make 10 - 16 pancakes. <br>  Tips & tricks<br>  <br>  1) You need a good non-stick pan, preferably a heavy one. To cook the pancakes properly, the pan needs to be hot. If you buy a new pan, you're supposed to 'season' it before you use it (heat some oil in it, discard the oil, then use fresh oil for your cooking).<br>  <br>  2) Tossing a pancake isn't rocket science but you need to practise. If it's just not happening for you, use a spatula!<br>  <br>  3) For some reason, the first pancake is always rubbish. Eat this one straight away so no-one sees it.<br>  <br>  4) Some people make the batter the other way around - by adding liquid to the flour. But this generates more washing up (bowl + measuring jug) so I do it the other way around.<br>  <br>  5) Some folk think it's essential to leave the batter to cool in the fridge for half an hour or more before you use it. Apparently, this expands the starch molecules and you get a more viscous batter. Hmm. I've never bothered...<br>  <br>  6) Some other folk think it's essential to use a metal spoon. Why??<br>  <br>  7) To make Scotch pancakes (drop scones), use ? pint of milk instead. This makes a thick batter. Scotch pancakes should be smaller (only about 5" across).<br>  <br>  Tasty fillings & topping<br>  <br>  The most basic traditional way to eat pancakes is with sugar & lemon juice.<br>  <br>  Sweet pancakes ('crêpes') are popular for breafast, snacks and as a dessert. <br>  Ideas:<br>  ? Maple syrup or golden syrup<br>  ? Tinned fruit pie filling<br>  ? Ice cream & chocolate sauce<br>  <br>  Savoury pancakes ('galettes') are easy to make for a French-style main course.<br>  Ideas:<br>  ? Beans & sausages<br>  ? Leeks & cheese sauce<br>  ? Ham, cheese & egg ('le complet')<br>  <br>  For more ideas, visit BBC Food's pancake, crêpe and blini recipe index pages.<br>  <br>  Leftovers<br>  <br>  Pancakes are best eaten immediately. Store any leftovers on a plate, covered in clear food wrap, in fridge.<br>  <br>  Reheat them in a microwave - for a stack of six, one minute on high is fine. Or you can heat them in a pan - fold them into quarters and reheat four at a time.

e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I used to do the same, although my motive was to eat! My Mother is still a great cook, even though because she is getting old, some things she just can't manage. However, she made these incredible little tarts. I do the same thing but I truely can't get the pastry right...so I buy phylo pastry or robin hood pie cruse and make this with butter brushed on, then it stuff them with jam. It isn't the same, but one day a friend dropped by just as I was pulling them out, they went on an on about them! Imagine if she tasted my Mother's. So try, but don't be afraid to take shortcuts. <br>  For the simple jam tarts just make the Robin Hood pie crust as directed and but instead of rolling it out, make a ball in your hand and put it in the buttered pan, spread it out with your fingers. If it is crumbly, that is just about perfect. When you have it covering the pan, mix jam with any fresh fruit you have and spread it around till it is a thin pie. Then take the remaining dough and gently pieces on the top in the same way {because when you roll it it gets so tough}. dot the top with butter bits, or if melted brush it on, sprinkle withe a little sugar. Cook until it bubbles and is brown. Broil for a second if necessary. <br>  It is super good.|`|krIGqZ7Yaa	Depends wat you mean by "perfect". If your talking about a sponge cake that is soft then you need to keep an eye on how u combine ingredients so air doesnt get beaten out of it. Or if you mean taste wise then its simply a matter of tasting your cake batter before u cook it so you know if u need to adjust certain flavours... at the very least a good recipe will detail any care needed to produce an awesome cake.

If we got meat in on a truck and it popped up on the computer as "past code date" (in other words, past the "sell by" date) the manager would just change the date in the computer so we  could check it into the warehouse and then send it off on  a truck. This is entirely legal, by the way, and apparently common practice for the cheaper chain stores.

Although the first two are good, GG is as rough as a cob and bitter as sin: it comes in close to the bottom in every blind taste test, but they're marketing geniuses.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Jameson is fine Irish whiskey, ranking right up there with Bushmill's. Corona is a Mexican beer that requires added lemon or lime to kill the skunky taste. I'm curious to learn whether it starts out that way or whether it gets skunked after it leaves the brewery. Grey Goose is a vodka which I've never tried. It is probably not worth the premium price.

FR90XsVMaa	how about throwing a party w/your friends neighbor etc.|`|4c2cb618b8c167d7beb0c2cc5a36fe4faa	I remember my 16th birthday. Had invited only5 friends but still, we all had fun. <br>  <br>  Anyway, lets to make your 16th birthday more special. it depends as to how people u intend to invite. If many, then perhaps you can have a 'theme birthday party' where the decoration, your birthday cake, costumes/dresses, games, invitation card have a theme. I remember someone's birthday which had a theme of a pumpkin. So all the above mentioned things had pumpkin somewhere. <br>  <br>  As far as games are concerned, you will have to figure out what do people of your age grp(teenagers) like. U can create a new game. <br>  I remember one game which I had kept on my 16th birthday. Its called, 'If and then' You will need loads of paper slips/chits/post its to write and pen/pencils and 2 bowls/boxes/containers. Distribute even numbers of paper chits(pair of two) to all your pals. Distribute minimum 3 pairs per person. You can increase or decrease accordingly. Now ask them to write a funny/wacky/weird sentence starting with 'If'. The sentence should be incomplete. Complete the sentence on a separate paper slip and this time the sentence should start with the word,'then'. Its not necessary that the subject of the 'if' slip should match with the 'then' slip. <br>  <br>  For example: Slip 1: "If the birthday cake vanishes..."<br>                      Slip 2: "...then the birthday girl would turn sweet 60!"<br>  <br>  You guys can have many such weird and funny sentences. Collect and keep all the 'If' slips in one container and 'then' slips in another. Mix all the slips in their respective containers and hand it over to 2 different people. Now let one person read the 'if' slips and the other person the 'then' slips.<br>  <br>  For example: Random slip(by you): "If the birthday cake vanishes..."<br>                      Random slip(written by someone else): "...then a Godzilla would enter the room."<br>  <br>  Okay, then example above is not funny but it at least gives you an idea.<br>  <br>  Phew....I hope I have been able to explain you the game properly. <br>  <br>  Have a very Happy Birthday. God Bless! :)|`|VbWhiBAHaa	Help a begger by giving food.|`|7pM7MbCDaa	make a party in your house invite friends and family have fun put a nice music ??<br>  and get some cake and drinks and sweets ??

If you contact the company they will make right the mistake and you won't have to spend your time and money suiting over something so insignificant in the long run.|`|jpMP5p9haa	I agree, far too many people are sue happy. I would very much suggest you switch to a different brand, and if you would go through the trouble of contacting someone, go ahead and call but I recommend you just switch to another brand and forget about it. If you do want to do something about it call the manufacturer, and tell them your experience even if you only want to warn them about what happened.|`|AA11765580	Gross!!

Doubtful. Ask yourself, realistically, "what was the harm done to me?" Not what COULD have happened. You could have been killed in a traffic accident yesterday, fortunately you were not. You can not sue all the drivers in the world who "might have" injured you yesterday.

EMDNVrcjaa	Answer: The United States Department of Agriculture sets a serving size for fruit or vegetables to be equal to about one-half cup. Greens like spinach and lettuce have a serving size equal to one full cup. One serving of sliced fruit is equal to one-half cup; however a single piece of fruit, such as an apple or an orange counts as one serving. How did the USDA decide that one-half cup is a serving size? The decision was based on the portion sizes that people typically eat, ease of use and nutritional content of fruits and vegetables.<br>  One serving of strawberries - about 8 strawberries|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Half a cup.

TzZnsjquaa	It really depends, but generally the liver can filter out about .01 BAC per hour. If you chugged half of a 750 mL bottle of 80 proof vodka, which is my guess, that amounts to probably 13 drinks or so. If you're an averaged-sized male with no tolerance, that's about 14 drinks with the beer, over an assumedly short time period, which puts you at .28, give or take - EXTREMELY drunk. In all likelihood, especially given that this was your first time drunk, you'll feel like crap all day. You should be fine tomorrow, though.<br>  EDIT: that's about the bottle I pictured and described above.|`|KJ3zAtJJaa	They say that your body can dissapate 1 drink per hour.

FicyC2TXaa	No pros as far as I'm concerned - I hated this book. And not because of I have a 'carnivorous lifestyle', I had been a vegan for 12 years when I read it.<br>  <br>  First of all, I hated all the b.itc.h talk - the kind of language my generation of feminists fought to stop men using against women.<br>  <br>  And I don't mean the swearing/cursing - I swear like a trooper and don't object to others doing so.<br>  <br>  I also took exception to its tone, I kept thinking 'just who the ****do you think you're talking to?' - the authors treat the reader like an idiot who just might learn something if they read on and try to keep up. <br>  <br>  That aside, I'm concerned by its premise; its claim is that as long as you're vegan, you'll lose weight. This is NOT true; even if you avoid junk food, a vegan diet will not necessarily cause you to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I'm also concerned by the amount of mock meats, cheeses etc (ie processed food) they recommend; their menus would have you eating it every single day, some days at every meal. While it's fine occasionally, it's not particularly healthy. Having sneaked a look at the recipe book, Skinny B.it.ch in the Kitch, it seems to me a majority of the recipes call for faux meat or cheese too.<br>  <br>  And I find some of their sources dubious. Their thinking seems to be 'if it's in a book, and we agree, it must be true'. <br>  <br>  I have been vegetarian most of my life, and vegan for 13 years, but in my opinion a balanced diet containing a little meat is healthier than the diet this book proposes.<br>  <br>  And they mislead in their claim that the diet will prevent cancer - vegans get cancer too.|`|08ecf8a68a9ab1aa3a103cd77bbf74e1aa	I found the book funny and entertaining too! I did the vegan thing for about 4 months-it was too hard for me (going out to eat, preparing ahead, and I wasn't getting enough protein) I got weak. I think it's great but I think some people need to work w/ a nutritionist or naturopath to make sure you're getting all of the nutrients you need. <br>  <br>  I want to try it again but this time I want to make sure that I'm getting enough iron/protein because I get anemic during menstruation. I think that the authors are trying to convince more people to become vegan<br>  but by appealing to your vanity while also pointing out the cruelty to animals.<br>  <br>  I have been vegetarian and pescetarain but I found being vegan more challenging|`|EkJ5di8daa	I read this book about two months ago and I must say, it did inspire me complete my phasing into veganism.  Granted, the authors have a pretty crude style, but overall, the message was loud and clear.  One of the cons would be not enough information on the importance of exercise and not enough explanation on the nutrients of the foods recommended by the authors.  <br>  I recently read the book "Thrive" by Brendan Frazier and I loved it much more - had great scientifically based information on misc. foods, etc.  However, it is geared more towards raw food diet.  Definitely worth reading!|`|b9uOax0aaa	I feel there is a massive amount of misinformation in this book .  I feel very good about myself and my diet and I do not live a carnivorous lifestyle.

xCbirkdOaa	The whipped cream that comes in a bottle/can doesn't last as long as the whipping cream you get in tubs. This is because of the pressure that it is stored in. Now depending on what you want to use the cream for - if it's just as a side for a dessert, it would be easier to use the stuff from a can. But if it's an ingredient for a dessert, you should use the whipping cream from a tub. This doesn't turn into a liquid minutes after you make it - this is what the canned cream does. Also the canned cream is much sweeter than the ones in tubs. In my opinion, i'd use the  cream in tubs because it's really nice especially in a profiterole. But the canned stuff is good on hot chocolate, but it has to be consumed soon after it is served.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Redi Whip (cans) are quick and easy.<br>  Cool whip (tubs) are quick and just as easy.<br>  Whole cream that you have to make is more difficult, but a hellova lot better tasting.

Marshmallows with gelatin are made with animals.  <br>  <br>  Gelatin is made by boiling skin, bone, connective tissue, and other leftover parts.  <br>  <br>  There are gelatin alternatives like agar-agar.<br>  <br>  A company called Sweet & Sara makes vegan marshmallow products without the use of gelatin <a href="http://www.sweetandsara.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetandsara.com/</a>|`|Q4oPyclQaa	As far as I know, if it says "gelatin" on the box, it's 100% animal parts that they are using as gelatin.

pMFLqU0Yaa	As soon as it starts to develop that characteristic creamy texture, grab yourself a spoon and give it the "tooth test". If it's cooked the way you like, pull it off the heat and you're done. If it's still too crunchy, keep cooking, adding small ladles of your hot stock or juice or whatever liquid you're using as necessary and tasting just a couple grains of rice often.  Actually testing the grains is really the only way to tell if the rice is done to your liking or not.|`|K4rP4A0naa	When you cook risotto you have to stand by the pan the whole time or you might ruin it. It's easy to cook though. All you need to do is add the hot stock when it starts to become dry and keep doing so for around 20 mins. After 20 I'd try some and if it needs more cooking keep going until the texture is to your liking. Some people say it should be stodgy and others like it soupy.<br>  <br>  The key is using hot stock which you should have in a pot on the stove, just below simmer point. This way the risotto pan doesn't have to heat it through first and oversoak the rice.<br>  <br>  A good base for most risottos is to fry a medium onion in olive oil until translucent, then coat the rice and add a splash of white wine. I would do this for mushroom and other vegetale risottos and also seafood ones.|`|427As7NGaa	it is impossible to overcook risotto- the softer the better:-) (that's what I tell my husband!)|`|DoYQeqGhaa	if u do, then add in more stock and cook it for an extra minute. then stir in more hot water|`|hT7BhNamaa	Blablabl, I start of with my finely diced onions and two table spoons of olive oil, saute the onions once translucent add two cloves of freshly crushed garlic, allow to saute for two minutes, add your rice and coat the rice in that oil, here I add a glass of white table wine I drink, not the cooking wine. This is the important stage when you have added the rice and started with the liquids, your going to be stirring basically and adding stock for the next 20 minutes, you only add stock as the already stock in the risotto reduces. After ten to fifteen minutes I add my wild picked mushrooms or the scampi tails, I at times add yellow saffron.<br>  <br>  You should be at the 20 minute mark, taste for seasoning, add pepper only if you need to, as the stock would have salt in it, before you take off the heat, add your 1/4 to 1/2 cup grated parmigiano reggiano, stir and taste there should be that very slight hint of that al dente texture.<br>  <br>  You can now plate it and enjoy, finish that bottle of wine, and open another one.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	The rice in a risotto should be neither crunchy nor mushy. Use risotto or Arborio rice. Add the stock little by little. The pan should sizzle when you add the stock. Keep stirring. <br>  Best tip is: get to know the rice you are using.<br>  As for shows: You can only judge whether the rice is cooked enough by testing it. And of course, personal preferences prevail. I hate a risotto which has the texture of rice pudding. A little crunch is good, but that is my preference.
ILpp3ncYaa	About a teaspoon, so add 40 calories and 5 fat grams.|`|AA10486738	A lot of it depends on how the chicken breast is prepared. If it is breaded you'll retain a lot more of the oil. If you cook it with the skin on that is the most fatty part of the chicken. So if you are concerned about your fat intake cook a skinless breast. You only need a very small amount of oil just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.Non stick cookware helps as you need less oil. Those cooking oil sprays in a can will also reduce your need for larger amounts of oil. So the answer is it depends on a number of factors.

There is an acronym that I learned years ago that I have altered to keep it from being offensive, "K.I.S.S. = Keep It Simple Sweetheart".<br>  <br>  You already know what you eat.  I would hope that you have done research on it enough to know what is a healthy approach to such a diet to keep healthy.  So going from that perspective, cook what it is that you already know.<br>  <br>  You eat spaghetti, so make spaghetti but not with meat.  If you feel the need for meat because that is what your used to, then go for one of the replacements such as the ground soy 'meat' replacements - or better yet, just go with replacing it with veggies such as zucchini, bottleneck squash, bell peppers, etc.<br>  <br>  Stuffed bell pepper.  Instead of meat, try a bread stuffing with vegetables added.  Made the very same way - just no meat.<br>  <br>  Soup.  Instead of a beef or chicken based stock, use a vegetable stock and all the vegetables that you like.<br>  <br>  There are also all the things that you already eat that are totally vegetarian.  Baked potato, pesto pasta, grilled vegetables, beans and rice (that is if you don't use any type of meat with the beans), stir fry (which to be honest, I don't even recall ever having one with any meat in it ever), fried rice (can be made with or without egg depending on if you are going to be eating eggs), fresh veggie sticks, fresh fruits, most breakfast cereals, etc.<br>  <br>  With a small amount of reading, you will find that eating a vegetarian diet is much easier than you think.  It is far from difficult.  And depending upon if you decide to eat eggs and/or milk, the choices are wide and varied.<br>  <br>  I honestly just took the cookbooks that I already had and just altered the recepies in minor ways to adapt them to vegetarian - so I didn't even have to run out and buy any special cookbooks.  Not to suggest that there are not some great cookbooks out there, because there are, but there is no need to run out and spend money when money is so tight for so many at this time.  If you DO decide to buy vegetarian cookbooks, I would suggest to do as I have done and get the best 'bang for your buck' and buy second hand books.  I have gotten several vegetarian cookbooks from a library and they work just as good as the ones that others buy brand new.  There are also websites if you want to go that way.<br>  <br>  As to brands of foods?  All that is pretty subjective.  What is appealing to me very well might not be to you.  I would suggest buying and trying for yourself and see what it is that YOU like and fits your personal tastes.<br>  <br>  I have two cookbooks that I use when I want something 'different' and want to try something new, "Good Housekeeping Favorite Recipes Vegetarian Meals" and "The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen".  I like those two because the one gives total nutritional values to what is being cooked, the other is a known healthy approach to eating for someone that has had heart problems, which is an issue for me personally.  Such may not be your personal choice.  So, take a trip to the library and check out the cookbooks and find what it is that works best for YOU before spending any money on a book that you very well may find that you don't like or won't use.<br>  <br>  Suggestions would be to learn about the use of spices.  They can make or break a recipe that you are making.  Make sure that you have a variety within your diet of foods to meet your dietary needs.  If you have problems, there is no harm in talking to your doctor and asking for a referal to a dietician/nutritionist to help you set up a health diet and with a shopping list.  They also can help you with recipes.  If you have medical issues, they can help you with diet needs so that you won't aggrivate your medical problem.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, take a deep breath and RELAX.  Do everything at your own speed.

AA12239026	This is the definition of the word "vegetarian" from Random House Dictionary, <br>  <br>  Vegetarian <br>  –noun 1. a person who does not eat or does not believe in eating meat, fish, fowl, or, in some cases, any food derived from animals, as eggs or cheese, but subsists on vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain, etc. <br>  <br>  So while I am sure your mother is sincere in her desire and request, a person that eats fish isn't a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  I new word entered the language in the word, "pescetarian" and was seen as such in 1993.

QzGWYFvVaa	I start with a batch of really good chili that won me first prize at a local contest. I then melt a stick of unsalted real butter in a ten inch well cured cast iron skillet that my Grandma gave me years ago. I place a raw corn tortilla in the butter just long enough to make it nice and pliable and roll it up with 2 or 3 heaping tablespoons of the chili in the center. I place these in a glass casserole dish until it's full and pour a cup or two of the chili over the enchiladas and top with a couple cups of good grated cheese. This is popped into a 350 F. oven for about 30 or 45 minutes or until the cheese is a nice golden brown. shoot me an email if you would like the chili recipe or you can use one of your own or out of a bag or can.

After you go a few times you may want to share what you learned with your mom.Also you could talk to a priest or preacher most will help even if you are not a member of their church. And if you believe in GOD you might try saying a  PRAYER daily. Wish I was more help GOOD LUCK.                                                 P.S.

They know what it is like dealing with her and they can understand your problem best, because I am sure they realize it is much more difficult doing it alone.<br>  As far as the jerk who is bringing your mother down, I don't think there is much you can do on your own. You need help from others to get her to realize. I don't know exactly how to go about this but I wish you all the luck, I applaud you for wanting to help your mother even when she has caused you pain.

You should have your "spag sauce" cooking, without the ground beef in it. In a lets say 2" deep baking dish, spread some sauce on the bottom lay your now fried steaks in the dish, sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese on each and some parmigiano reggiano, a little sauce over each steak. place it on the middle rack 300F for 20 minutes max. <br>  <br>  While your meat is in the oven, use a little chicken stock instead of water to steam your broccoli. While the the steaming is in progress (and don't over steam you still want to retain some of the bite) prepare your fennel, take off the stems down to the top of the fennel bulb, the base you can trim that core, and take off the outside leaf you would call it, that can be a little bit much. Give the bulb a good rinse, shake off the excess water, cut the bulb in half from the top to the bottom. From the bottom thinly slice it, you may find that half for two of you may be sufficient.

And how much do you like to cook and try new things?  I've recently become enamored of a tasty El Salvadorian delight called a "Papusa" served with the traditional Curtido. The papusas can be a bit of  work when you are first learning to make them, but man! They are worth it! Of course once you get the hang of it, it goes much faster.<br>  <br>  Papusas<br>  <br>      *   5 cups masa harina flour<br>      * 4 cups water, approximately<br>      * 16-24 ounces canned refried beans<br>      * 3 cups soft white cheese<br>      * light vegetable oil or light olive oil<br>  <br>  In a large mixing bowl, gradually stir water into masa harina until dough forms a ball that can be handled.<br>  <br>  Into another bowl, empty the refried beans. Place the grated cheese into a separate bowl.<br>  <br>  Divide dough into about 25 pieces. Roll each into a ball and flatten between the palms of your hands to about 1/2-inch thick. Put a spoonful of beans and a small handful of cheese into the center of each pupusa. Flatten again with the filling inside. (You can actually stuff your papusas with anything you want. I've used citrus pork, just cheese, cheese and chiles, seasoned ground beef with or without cheese, seasoned chicken with or without cheese, all kinds of stuff... use your imagination)<br>  <br>  <br>  Heat a heavy, wide-bottomed or flat skillet until hot. Brush with oil and cook pupusas on each side 4-5 minutes until a pale golden-brown. The outside should be firm. <br>  <br>  <br>  Curtido (El Salvadorean slaw)<br>  <br>      *   1 medium head of cabbage, chopped<br>      * 2 small carrots, grated<br>      * 1 small onion, sliced<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or paprika<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon oregano<br>      * 1 teaspoon olive oil<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1 teaspoon brown sugar<br>      * 1/4 cup vinegar<br>      * 1/2 cup water<br>  <br>  Place the cabbage in boiling water for no more than one minute.

1EmKBzdvaa	The key to making Brownies is in the baking phase.  Just 2-3 minutes of under baking or over baking will produce poor results.  About 20 minutes into the baking time lightly touch the center.  If there is slight springiness insert a clean toothpick into the center.  If it has wet batter on it cook for another 5 minutes and test again.  When the toothpick comes out with no wet batter the Brownies are done.  At this stage there will be wet crumbs on the toothpick and the toothpick may show signs of being damp.  If the crumbs are dry or if the toothpick has no crumbs then the Brownies are overdone.  Actually this rule applies to all cakes.  Be aware that if the recipe calls for a glass baking dish and you use a metal baking dish the baking time will be less.  A larger pan than specified in the recipe will also result in a shorter baking time.<br>  <br>  The ratios of the ingredients and the mixing method determine whether the Brownies will be cakey or chewy or fudgy.  So pick a recipe, boxed or from scratch, that suits your preference.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Put walnuts in them if you're not allergic to them. They taste great.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Is suggest you use Betty Crocker.

AA10928232	Roman Meal is one example of "brown" bread that is only brown b/c of caramel coloring.  No whole grain wheat in it at all.<br>  <br>  Can't speak to your particular brand w/o the label in front of me, but check the nutrition label yourself.  How many grams of fiber per slice?   Most WW breads have 2 grams per slice.  See how your brand compares.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Article from Yahoo today:<br>  <br>  7-grain, 12-grain, whole wheat, all-natural multi-grain, whole grain whole wheat...  What, what, what? There's too much in the bread aisles to know which one to choose. To help, I've laid out key info on whole wheat versus whole grain breads, and I've compared nutrition labels for some popular products at the market. The choice should be easier to make after understanding which breads really are better for you. <br>  Whole Grain 101<br>  Whole grain products are better for you than refined grains because they use the entire grain kernel, which is where the nutrients are, especially B vitamins, fiber, and iron. <br>  <br>  Whole Wheat Bread vs. Whole Grain Bread<br>  Whole wheat is a whole grain, so what is going on?<br>  <br>  Why multi-grain whole grain breads can be better than whole wheat breads: Each whole grain has a different strength, so breads that use a variety of whole grains help you take in a greater range of benefits. For instance, flax seeds are rich in lignan, an antioxidant that may protect against breast cancer, while barley helps lower cholesterol. If you consume both of these in one slice of bread you get to enjoy the benefits of both. <br>  <br>  Why multi-grain breads aren't always better: First, to be a healthy contender, a bread label that says "multigrains" must also say "100% whole grains" somewhere on the package. Otherwise, the bakery may be throwing a couple whole grains in with a ton of refined grains, which sidesteps almost all the nutritional benefits. <br>  <br>  Second, even those legit multi-grain breads often have nearly the same nutritional profile as whole wheat bread because they use mainly wheat with tiny amounts of those other whole grains (even though they may market those other grains in a big way on the package). Most companies do not list the amount of each whole grain they use on their packages. The best clue is how close to the top of the ingredients list the whole grains are. Look for breads that list their whole grains (such as oats, flax seeds, barley, etc.) as a main ingredient, rather than in a sub-list of ingredients that each contribute less than 2% of the makeup of the bread. This is the best we can do for now because when I called many of these companies, they could not or would not give me these statistics.|`|f7E4FqVfaa	Check the label. If his is "whole grain" and yours isn't, then yeah, it's pretty much brown white bread. :)|`|btX6mM3Taa	Generic wheat bread should be the same as regular. Just look at the ingredients list.

It's already wheat flour, just not whole wheat.  I think that in peanut butter cookies it will be okay.

It mentions crème fra?che as an alternative, and the cream cheese sounds ... interesting. <br>  <br>  CARBONARA SAUCE <br>  <br>  Enough for pasta for 2 <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  <br>  4 slices of cooked ham   <br>  100g of closed cup mushrooms<br>  2 cloves of garlic<br>  1 onion<br>  1 tablespoon of olive oil<br>  1 tablespoon of flour<br>  150ml carton of single cream<br>  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs<br>  Ground pepper to taste<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Cut the ham into 1cm (? inch) pieces. Wipe the mushrooms clean. Cut the ends off the stalks and chop them into slices. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces. <br>  <br>  Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the mushrooms, stir and cook for a couple more minutes. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream, ham and herbs. Season with the pepper. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES<br>  <br>  Use bacon or a gammon steak, cut into 1cm (? inch) pieces and added at the same time as the onion and garlic, instead of the cooked ham. <br>  <br>  Use button mushrooms instead of closed cup mushrooms. Don’t use open cup mushrooms, as the brown underside discolours the sauce. <br>  <br>  Use crème fra?che instead of the cream. <br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>  A dairy-based sauce like this should traditionally be served with long, thin egg pasta, like tagliatelle. However, it is also served with long, thin plain pasta, like spaghetti.<br>  <br>  Always “take the pasta to the sauce”. Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated. <br>  <br>  HISTORICAL NOTES <br>  <br>  This dish was unknown before the Second World War, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by the Allied troops. It also became popular with the Allied troops stationed in Italy. Upon their return home, they tried to recreate the dish, but somehow it lost the eggs and gained the cooked ham, cream sauce and mushrooms. Meanwhile, the Italians just substituted the bacon for home produced pancetta.|`|1c92d07b37f80047838d5bdd01d7ef75aa	As simple as i can give you: <br>  <br>  400ml Whipping Cream<br>  1 Clove Garlic - crushed<br>  2-3 Rashers of bacon - pancetta if u prefer<br>  Good Pinch of finely chopped parsley<br>  Black Pepper<br>  Salt<br>  <br>  Fry the bacon off in olive oil until cooked but not incredibly crispy.<br>  <br>  Add the garlic and parsley, saute for 30 seconds then add cream.<br>  <br>  Reduce slightly before adding your cooked pasta, add seasoning to taste. The more you boil the cream the thicker it should become and when it starts to cling to the pasta its ready to serve.<br>  <br>  Thats you done<br>  <br>  If you wish add an egg yolk for richness at the very end but mix it through thoroughly or it can scramble.

How's about:<br>  <br>  Chimichanga - whatever meaty product you have (hamburger, leftover roast beef, shredded chicken, etc.) well seasoned, add beans, refried or whole, some seasoned rice if you want, shredded cheese, maybe some chiles all rolled up burrito style in a flour tortilla and then fried until hot and crispy. I top mine with homemade guacamole, sour cream and Tapatio hot sauce.<br>  <br>  Fast food at home - A toasted Double Fibre Orowheat English Muffin with a light smear of mustard on one side, a poached egg, a sausage patty and sometimes some cheese. It's a homemade McGagme's McMuffin sandwich. Lower cal, higher in fiber and much cheaper in the long run.<br>  <br>  Dinner Turnover - frozen bread dough (or homemade if you'd like), broccoli florets steamed or nuked until crisp-tender, cheese of your choice, maybe even some cooked, cubed ham. Roll some of the dough into a circle, put fillings (I just used broccoli and cheese as an example - you can use whatever you like) on one half of circle, fold dough into half moon shape and seal well with your fingers or the tines of a fork, enclosing filling. Spray top with olive oil cooking spray (or brush with butter or other oil) Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until golden brown and heated through.<br>  <br>  I'd just rampage the kitchen and start mixing things up.

4a66d12ad0952e5ec7eb7656964ff567aa	If you're going to make meatballs then yes, you need to defrost first as you need to form the mince mixture into balls.  Difficult if its frozen, and your recipe might suggest adding herbs, breadcrumbs, egg or whatever to the mince to get the balls to stay as a ball and to taste good.  <br>  <br>  If its just for mince as in "mince and potatoes" then chucking it in the pan frozen works perfectly well!|`|771aacf2f768bc76138476f792d8ae83aa	Allways defrost first.

u9Q0Ai1uaa	I wish I knew a way to make the smell go away, but a way to help kinda control it is to put your fryer on your stove and turn on the fan that's over your stove. It helps but does not take it completely out. the only other thing I know is to fry out side on a nice day just take it out on your deck or patio or drive way you will have to run an extension cord though but the fryer smell wont be in your home|`|8th9KY1haa	Meg gave here the best answer.<br>  I like to ad also that once in a while when the oil is hot before you fry any thing ,place a slice of white plain bread and let it fry until golden brown. With tongs remove it and that will absorb and clean some of the oil and eliminate some of the smell.<br>  Oil does go bad if kept for a long period of time and depending of how much frying you do you may need to change the oil more frequently. Also depends of witch oil you use, best to use is canola oil.Fryng fish will generate a more profound smell than other foods. And finally when you discard the old oil rinse the inside of your fryer .<br>  Good Luck<br>  Former Restaurant Owner|`|hT7BhNamaa	Lyns, strange you should ask, my deep fryer looks like it's from the days of Noah's Ark. Darn giving my age away. When I have used the deep fryer, I don't think i have ever had the setting above 375F. I do a regular clean, and change the oil, with fries and wedges not so bad, but when your deep frying battered fish, or crumbed meat, then you clean and change the oil more often. As for a bad odor, I can't remember having that problem, when you use your frying pan you get the same cooking smells basically as your deep fryer.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|NRQXmIcwaa	open the window & turn on the exhaust fan.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	changing the oil every couple of months and thouroughly cleaning the deepfryer helps out a lot. i do this often.<br>  <br>  the smell comes from the old greese and the stuff that settles at the bottom...also make sure to wipe the sides if anything drips...<br>  <br>  <br>  i know after i started doing this more often i didnt have the odor anymore ....|`|nOVSf06Raa	I have no idea on what brand do you have but the ones that I saw in stores comes equipped with a filter , I only have an open one and when I deep fry I have the same problem as you , so my solution is to go into the basement open the windows and work downstairs  to keep the smell from going up , deep frying, frying or cooking  in general will always smell, therefore if you have company don't use the deep fryer and after all a house is to be lived in , so let smell it's food after all!

AA10486738	Most people don't add flavoring to the fondant as most people don't eat it. The trick is to glaze the cake with a thinned fruit based or other glaze such a Kahlua/coffee glaze and then crumb coat the cake and then frost it with butter cream before you apply the fondant. Your cake can be put in the fridge. It may also be frozen. defrost it in a cool room in front of a fan to prevent water spots.|`|AA10923010	here is a recipe for fondant.

These are colorless and will not tint the fondant.  These are really strong so add very little and work it in.  <br>  <br>  Also, the tip about brushing the cake with flavored syrups is a good one that most high end bakeries use. <br>  <br>  Another tip is to frost the cake with buttercream frosting before applying the fondant.|`|GJu1LKfyaa	I never added flavoring but have tried the coloring and it just has to be worked in real good.  Have you ever had watched Ace of Cakes on the Food Network ?  He mixes coloring all the time but I don't know about flavoring.  Try getting on Wilton website and see if you can.

AA11977808	Take your pick from lemon/lime juice (citric acid) or vinegar (acetic acid)<br>  <br>  Some supermarket brands call it  'acidulated' cream.|`|AE3lv4pRaa	You can make sour cream or a cream cheese, depending upon your preference.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:-<br>  <br>  1 pint of table cream.<br>  1/4 cup of buttermilk.<br>  <br>  Instructions:-<br>  <br>  Scald out a glass bowl large enough to hold those two ingredients. Allow the bowl to return to room temperature.<br>  <br>  Pour in the pint of table cream into the bowl; then stir in the 1/4 cup of buttermilk. Cover the top of the bowl with cling wrap; then place the bowl in a warm place, around 80 degrees F.<br>  <br>  I use the inside of a gas oven where the pilot light retains a nice even warmth. Let this mixture sit for approximately 24 hours.<br>  <br>  After time has passed, you will have the makings of your sour cream. It should have gone fairly solid - meaning it will jiggle around a bit in the bowl, but it won't be a liquid.<br>  <br>  It will have a consistency similar to a soft jelly... slipping around in the bowl as a soft but solid mass. When the sour cream has reached the above stage, line another bowl with 3 or 4 layers of clean cheese cloth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Spoon the sour cream into the cheese cloth lined bowl. Tie up the corners of the cloth to make a bag and hang it to drain - don't forget to place a container underneath the bag to catch the whey. Let it drain until it reaches your preferred consistency.<br>  <br>  The draining will only take a matter of hours. You may let it drain until it is as firm as a cream cheese, or stop draining it when it reaches a richly textured sour cream.<br>  <br>  If you forget about it and it thickens too much, simply stir a bit of the drained whey back in until it's just right.<br>  <br>  Spoon the sour cream from the cheese cloth into a clean container and store it in the refrigerator. Remember, this is fresh, it will only last a few days.|`|ED5ruJ5waa	may be this can help:<br>  <br>  www.bhg.com/recipe/meat/irish-stew-wit...|`|nOVSf06Raa	here is how to make your own<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Sour-Cream-Substitute-160952" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Sour-Cream-Sub...</a>|`|LBHQkBnkaa	Add lemon Juice to the cream.

(6) skinny rice noodles (py mai fun)<br>  1/2 cup reduced-sodium fat-free chicken broth<br>  3 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce<br>  1 tsp. sugar<br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  Cooking spray<br>  1 tbsp. peanut oil, divided<br>  1 lg. egg, beaten lightly<br>  1/2 cup red bell peppers, cut in strips<br>  1 tbsp. grated peeled fresh ginger<br>  1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes<br>  3 to 5 cloves garlic, minced<br>  8 oz. boneless skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced (I used 8 more oz of shrimp; you could also use cubed tofu)<br>  1 tbsp. curry powder<br>  8 oz. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined<br>  1 cup sliced green onions (1-inch slices)<br>  1/2 lb. snow peas, sliced thinly<br>  1/2 lb. mung bean sprouts<br>  Directions:<br>  Cook rice noodles according to package directions, leaving out any fat or salt that may be called for. Combine broth, soy sauce, sugar and salt, and stir together till sugar dissolves.<br>  <br>  Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; coat pan with cooking spray. Add 1 tsp oil. Add egg; stir-fry 30 seconds or until soft-scrambled, stirring constantly. Remove from pan, and set aside. Wipe down pan with cloth or paper towel.<br>  <br>  Heat remaining oil (about 2 tsp) in pan over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, ginger, red pepper, and garlic; stir-fry 15 seconds. Add snow peas, bean sprouts, curry, and shrimp; stir fry two or three minutes, until shrimp is nearly done. Stir in egg, noodles and broth mixture; cook 1 minute or until thoroughly heated. Sprinkle with green onions. <br>  <br>  Chow Fun  (with beef)<br>  <br>      * 1 lb beef flank steak<br>      * 5 teaspoons dark soy sauce<br>      * 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>      * a few drops sesame oil<br>      * 1 teaspoon cornstarch<br>      * 1/2 pound fresh rice noodles<br>      * 1 8-ounce can baby corn<br>      * 2 garlic cloves<br>      * 1 tablespoon Chinese black bean sauce<br>      * 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons oyster sauce<br>      * 5 tablespoons oil for stir frying, or as needed<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  Cut the flank steak across the grain into thin strips about 1/4-inch thick. Add the dark soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Marinate the steak for 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  While the steak is marinating, prepare the vegetables: rinse the baby corn in warm running water and drain. Smash, peel, and chop the garlic cloves.<br>  <br>  If using refrigerated rice noodles, rinse them in warm water to loosen. Cut the noodles into 1/2 to 3/4 inch strips.<br>  <br>  Heat the wok and add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the beef. Lay flat and let brown for a minute. Stir in the black bean sauce and stir-fry the beef until it is browned and nearly cooked through. Remove from the wok.<br>  <br>  Clean out the wok and add 2 more tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and stir-fry until aromatic. Add the rice noodles and stir fry until browned.<br>  <br>  Push the rice noodles up to the side of the wok and add 1 more tablespoon oil. When the oil is hot, add the baby corn. Stir-fry briefly, then mix with the noodles. Stir in the oyster sauce.<br>  <br>  Add the beef back into the wok. Mix everything together and serve hot.|`|d5abd43b2147ab853d2ec674d4a74280aa	The basic difference is in the size of the noodle.  In mei fun a very thin noodle is used, while chow fun is a wider noodle.|`|sPR3qpTMaa	Well, not sure what your question is but if your referring to the Chinese Noodles, then i might be able to help.<br>  <br>  Mei Fun - Pronounced Mai Fun,<br>  Is basically very very thin glass noodles, or wheat noodles, depending on the brand.<br>  <br>  Chow Fun - Pronounced exactly the same.<br>  Is Fried Rice O.o

Whd6tqLzaa	I think after you pour the jello and cool whip mixture into the pan, they separate as they cool and you get two layers.<br>  <br>  Try the way the recipe suggested. If it doesn't work then you you can pour the plain jello in the pan, let it cool and then pour the other batter mixed with cool whip over it and let it cool. It should come out tasty any way.|`|AA12350023	I remember this recipe from a child.. my mom used to make it in pretty tall wine glasses for parties.. just follow the recipe.. it really does seperate as it cools.. I think the dairy part sort of floats upwards.. its amazing and pretty to decorate with fruit or chocolate curls etc... <br>  my Mom also though used to use spray can whipped cream and do little dollops on top of the wine glass jellos and top with a pretty marachino cherry.. they looked so fancy.. hahaha!|`|nOVSf06Raa	you are doing the right thing ,this is a self layering dessert  just follow the instructions when you put it in the fridge the 2 will separate and the cool whip will come to surface,<br>  <br>  I make these as well .|`|9FxR4khCaa	Just make it as stated-the layers separate as it cools.

Independent. I eat foods I enjoy. I don't enjoy animal meat or poultry, but I do enjoy the by-products: milk, cheese, eggs. I find animal meat difficult to digest & it seemed to weigh me down and lower my energy. I enjoy pastas, beans, grains, nuts, soy, and gluten products, lots of fish, and of course a variety of fruits and vegetables.<br>  2. I think the word is a misnomer. It implies your diet consists mainly of vegetables. Not true.<br>  3. People started calling me a "vegetarian" when I stopped eating animals & poultry.<br>  4. You don't eat at a lot of fast food burger joints. I rarely fry anything, and after 20+ years, I see my health, appearance, energy, and outlook have held up well as compared to my meat eating peers.<br>  5. I have to scrub the grill thoroughly from where the rest of the family has grilled their meats before I can throw on my food, or I must cook my food first (smile). No negatives, it's natural for me.<br>  6. As you can see from my above answers I have a very nutritious diet. <br>  7.It feels fine. People need to eat and we do raise animals, poultry, fish, grains, and plants for food. Nothing wrong with that. I have real issues on many levels with how animals & poultry raised for food are treated. I also have issues with how food grown in the field is treated. The soil is mostly depleted of minerals and they no longer care for the soil, they just throw all the vitamins and minerals back into the food source after it's harvested.|`|YvNCOYZZaa	I feel the need to point out that vegetarians DO NOT EAT FISH, so the answers from people who eat 'lots of fish', are not answers from vegetarians. <br>  <br>  1.  Ovo-lacto. No dead animals, but eat cheese & eggs.  Again, VEGETARIANS DO NOT EAT FISH.  FISH IS MEAT, so I do not eat it.  Nor do I eat gelatin, carmine, meat stocks, and I try to avoid animal rennets. <br>  <br>  2.  Vegetarians do not eat any sort of animal flesh.  Period.  <br>  <br>  3.  I decided that I could no longer take the life of an animal for my pleasure.  The pleasure that I got from 15 minutes of food was not worth the price of an animal's life. <br>  <br>  4.  I have no guilt about what I eat.  I am not a hypocrite who cries over puppy mills while shoving a McDonalds cheeseburger into my mouth.  I am not a hypocrite who 'loves dolphins', but then gorges themselves on all you can eat popcorn shrimp. <br>  <br>  5.  Limited food availability when eating out and traveling.  People being rude and trying to get me to eat meat.  People telling me how unhealthy it is and how I must be anemic with no protein.<br>  <br>  6.  A vegetarian who eats right lacks no nutrition.  Personally, I take a super-vitamin that covers any basis that I might miss, but also gives me all kinds of extras that aren't an FDA thing.<br>  <br>  7.

I avoid all meat, fish and any food that contains anything that was once alive (eg Smarties, jelly, marshmallows)<br>  <br>  2. Vegetarianism is where you believe that animals should not be raised with the specific purpose of being killed in their prime to be eaten when there are alternatives.<br>  <br>  3. When I was about 6, I found out that pigs were smarter than dogs and decided I didn't want to eat them as I didn't want to eat dogs.  It spiralled from there and I went fully veg when I was 12.<br>  <br>  4. My health has benefited, and I lost weight and hardly ever have any skin problems.<br>  <br>  5. Peoples attitudes.  I've lost count of the amount of people who when you tell them you are vegetarian, sneer and go 'why?'  Also the lack of choice in most restaurants is annoying!<br>  <br>  6. I only ever had iron lacking at one point, due to my dislike of green veg, I started eating it a lot more regularly and have had no problems since then.<br>  <br>  7. I'm extremely proud to be a vegetarian, I like that I don't eat things which were once alive so basically, it feels great!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your thesis!<br>  <br>  Jools, Scotland

First of all you do not need a school to bartend, you need to have an out going personality, plus speed and grace, and most important you need to be able to multitask, they can not teach you that at any school, at these schools they put you behind a bar and teach you the most common drinks, which just go get the bartending book for dummies (10.00) and learn the basic drinks, most common: Long island ice tea, sex on the beach, white russian, martinis, manhattans, ect. Most clubs will start you out as a waitress or bar back, then that is where you will learn the drinks and prices, from there work your way up to being a bartender. Managers look for the person who learns fast and and works hard to get the bartending position. Good luck!
b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Awesome! Good for you. Eating natural foods and fresh veggies and fruit will take care of most of your vitamin needs. You need to incorporate a reliable source of Vitamin B 12.  It is available in Tempeh and Red Star or Kal's Nutritional Yeast -- which tastes sort of cheesy, Miso also provides B12 and a good Vegetarian Multi Vitamin is a good source too. I prefer Country Life Vitamins. Be careful of the synthetic vitamins you find in the Supermarkets and Drug Stores. They are a waste of your money. Your body only recognizes and uses natural substances.<br>  The body runs on minerals however, so be sure to include some sea veggies in your diet. You don't need a lot but an occasional vegetarian sushi is a good idea, or sprinkle a bit of Dulse flakes on a salad. I sprout three Tbs. each chickpeas, lentils, sunflower seeds, aduki beans and mung beans together -- changing the rinse water twice a day  for four days and then harvest them and make a simple salad by adding fresh lemon juice, pimento stuffed manzilla olives and dulse flakes. It has always gotten rave reviews from non-veg people as well as the vegetarians and vegans!<br>  The Omegas 3 - 6 - 9  are plentiful in both Hemp Seed and Flax Seed. Nature's Path Cereals are a good source of them and there is Hemp Milk which is a phenomenal source of both the omegas and protein.  <br>  Quinoa is the only grain that contains all seven of the essential amino acids. What that means is that it is important to include beans, legumes, pulses nuts and seeds and products like Tofu and Tempeh or the Faux Meats such as Tofurky's Sausages, Yves Fajita Strips or Hot Dogs, Light Life's Gimme Lean Products which are all 100% vegan and available in the Supermarkets and Health Food Stores along with your grain dishes -- rice, corn, barley, wheat, pastas etc.  <br>  Fresh vegetables and fruits wll provide tons of vitamins and fiber. <br>  Congratulations! You have chosen a life path to health and vitality and not only that but you will soon open the door to culinary creativity and a lifetime of delicious meals.

No need to limit yourself to vegetables. You can enjoy a wide variety of foods and unless you are a picky eater or don't eat good sized portions, you should only need a multivitamin. I enjoy good mental and physical health, clear skin, good hair, bright eyes, and I enjoy good food. There are a variety of foods available to you. Tell me what type veggie you are becoming and I will offer you some more suggestions. For now, the best suggestion I can offer to  you is, don't take yourself or vegetarianism too seriously. It's a choice and it has to fit you. You may find it works for you, maybe there's some things you find you just can't give up right now. Just enjoy the experience and you'll learn a lot about yourself, your likes and dislikes. Good luck.|`|lb1pPyTcaa	I have been a vegitarian all my life, since my mom is and she made me and my dad become them.. and i dont really eat vitamins.. but my mom said i should eat all the colors of vegetables, cus each color is a different vitamin. im glad im a vegitarian because i dont wana eat animals anyway.. dats sorta nasty sounding to me anyways|`|T2IzGMU7aa	no offense but this question has been asked thousands of times before under the catogory vegy and vegan so just look back at some of the answers ive posted about 3 times on the same thin|`|9F3LGHLCaa	nothing really just take a daily vitamin and make sure you eat some protein (beans , eggs, nuts) . the only benefit i noticed when i first started was that my acid reflux went away completely , i would have it all the time pretty much daily before i stopped eating meat. i mainly became vegetarian for the animals .|`|0NYQNr9saa	Eat a balanced veggie diet (lots of green veg especially) and you don't need any vitamins.<br>  When I went vegetarian, I lost weight and my skin became clearer.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	I'm an omnivore, so I can't inspire you with tales of how it helped me but I can tell you this. Vitamins are not going to be your problem. Amino acids are. To get all the essential ones, consume both grains and legumes. They don't have to be mixed together but good examples are succotash, red (or black) beans and rice, or risi pisi. These represent different cuisines: Amerindian, New Orleans, Caribbean, and Italian. Most cookbooks will have at least one example of a dish providing balanced vegetable protein.|`|2RzEaod9aa	A well-rounded diet. Meat only supplies a handful of nutrition, all of which you can find (usually in higher quantities that are easier to absorb) in a vegetarian diet. You just need to eat a well-rounded diet, like I hope you're doing anyway.<br>  <br>  I became vegan when I read that it could help me manage a permanent disability I got in the Marine Corps.

And the grapes don't grow in the Finger Lakes; they grow on shore.<br>  <br>  Now that I've finished rattling your chain, the Finger Lakes region has soils and climate similar to that of some of the great wine regions of Europe. Although winters there can be brutal, the presence of so much water moderates the climate so that you get no rapid changes of temperature. Unlike California, there is a great deal of variation from vintage to vintage, making the wines more like those of France or Italy.|`|hV43wyvJaa	I bet somebody planted some grape seeds there.

Once browned on all sides, add enough water to cover the roast along with the 1 sliced onion and about 6 cloves of garlic. Cook until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours. When done, remove the roast to a platter to cool, reserve the beef broth. Hand shred the meat and set aside.<br>  <br>  To prepare the sauce, remove the tops of the dried chilies and shake out most of the seeds. Place the chilies in a large stockpot and cover them with water. Add the cumin, remaining sliced onion and garlic. Boil for 20 minutes until the chiles are very soft. Transfer the chiles to a blender using tongs and add a ladle full of the chile water (it is best to do this in batches.) Puree the chiles until smooth. Pass the pureed chiles through a strainer to remove the remaining seeds and skins. Pour the chili sauce into a large bowl and add salt, stir to incorporate. Taste to check seasonings, add more if necessary. Add the shredded beef to the bowl of chili sauce, and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br>  <br>  Go through the dried cornhusks, separate them and discard the silk, be careful since the husks are fragile when dry. Soak them in a sink filled with warm water for 30 minutes to soften. In a deep bowl, combine the masa, baking powder, and salt. Pour the broth into the masa a little at a time, working it in with your fingers. In a small bowl, beat the vegetable shortening until fluffy. Add it to the masa and beat until the dough has a spongy texture.<br>  <br>  Rinse, drain, and dry the corn husks. Set them out on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel along with the bowls of masa dough and beef in chili sauce. Start with the largest husks because they are easier to roll. Lay the husk flat on a plate or in your hand with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you. Spread a thin, even layer of masa over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon dipped in water. Do not use too much! Add about a tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of the masa. Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling. The sticky masa will form a seal. Pinch the wide top closed.<br>  <br>  Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up. Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water. The water should not touch the tamales. Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid. Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn't boil away. Steam the tamales for 2 hours.<br>  <br>  The tamales are done when the inside pulls away from the husk. The tamale should be soft, firm and not mushy. To serve, unfold the husk and spoon about a tablespoon of remaining beef filling on top.<br>  <br>  Flan is a traditional Mexican dessert and there are many versions.
