20090310013202AAo3efK	Travel;Asia Pacific;Korea	What percentage of western men in Korea have Korean wives or girlfriends?	I always get a laugh when jealous Korean guys claim that Korean women don't go for foreigners because the international marriage rate is only around 11% in Korea.  And most of those are hapless Korean farmers that import foreign wives from poorer Asian countries like Vietnam and Laos.      In reality there aren't many western men in Korea, but most of the ones that are here have Korean wives or girlfriends.  A  Canadian friend  of mine had a small birthday dinner party last weekend and 7 out of the 9 guys there had a Korean girlfriend or wife with them.  And one of the guys there who didn't probably hasn't had a girlfriend anywhere.      Anyway, based on my experiences with western colleagues, friends and acquaintances I estimate that about 75% of western men who have been in Korea 3 months or longer have Korean wives or girlfriends.      The propaganda that these lonely losers like nice one try to preach in this forum about Korean women not liking western guys is laughable.  Korean women do like western guys.  They always have since I've been in Korea.      I'd like to hear other opinions with some factual material if you disagree with me.      Thanks in advance.

20090227113403AAJZ0cd	Travel;Travel (General);Health & Safety	What are the chances my plane will crash?	I have recently developed an "anxiety" regarding plane travel. This is fairly new; while I've always been a little nervous, I've never be quite THIS nervous (not an actual phobia, just a very real aversion to wanting to fly). I don't fly alot, but last month I had to fly to San diego for work, and I'll have to make several more trips in the coming months (SF to San Diego, SF to Las Vegas, SF to Dallas). The more I think about flying, the more I start trying to devise a way to make the trip by car instead. Plus (and this will make me seem Coo-coo bananas, I know),I've had several dreams about either witnessing or being in plane crashes over the past couple of months. I need some guidance: realistically, what are the chances of me going down in a ball of flames? How can I circumvent this problem before it gets more out of hand? Thanks in advance.

20090310004221AAvY0Tc	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	When should I leave to avoid the worst traffic when going from San Luis Obispo to Disneyland?	I am planning a trip from San Luis Obispo to Disneyland to San Diego. I will only be able to go to Disneyland for one day so I would like to get there by at least 11 am or noon. I am leaving San Luis Obispo for Disneyland on a thursday and I am wondering when I should leave to avoid the worst traffic once I enter Los Angeles? Mapquest says the trip should take 3 hours 45 min but could last up to 6 hours with traffic. I was thinking about leaving at 5 am or 6 am just to be 100% percent sure I make it by noon. But if I should leave at a different time to avoid major traffic please let me know. I will be taking the 101 to i-5 highways. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!

20090310011438AAA5ST5	Travel;New Zealand;Other - New Zealand	New zealanders what is your opinion of this?	Hi I was considering moving my family to N.Z. I came across in answers this LONG comment about NZ, all bad and though i realise everyone has good and bad experiences it has worried me abit. What are New Zealanders take on this article and anyone who has lived in NZ also please. Ok will cut and paste it, it is long to read so be patient. THANKS      NZ has a kind of social complexity that you do not encounter in any other country.   There is a strong bullying culture at work environment especially towards foreigners.   It is a small isolated country. So what you think the major source of income is. Of course it is agriculture and tourism.The problem is because salaries are low most educated people leave for better income overseas. This creates a big problem.. As I said it is a small country.So what do you think people might feel when most young generation emigrate. Well they feel they are invaded by foreigner migrants especially Asians, Indians and others. For many years white people dominated the country and Maories were lower class citizens. When the white young generation is emigrating the country, fear of losing the power and fear of losing the working class (age 16-45) can cause a hostile environment towards new comers….If you spend some time with them you will see how much they adore and admire themselves and their younger ones compared to other nationalities no matter where they are from…..This is a dominant culture…even if a kiwi commits a crime if the victim is not a main stream New Zealander the chances that lawyers and justice protect their own people is quiet high. Because they want to keep their people and stop them from leaving. This culture exists in all of them .Almost all of them…politicians, doctors, lawyers, taxi drivers, farmers…..almost all of them maybe because they want to teach them to value their country and stay….however because tourism is their biggest source of income over many many years of dealing with migrants and foreigners they know they need migrants for their money….I have never seen any other nationality in the world being able to rip off so skilfully as kiwis. They make a slave out of you. They make you work for free. Most skilled migrants are young, motivated, and energetic and have some saving. They come to NZ to make a better life. They spend some of their best years of life, the first five years after leaving their country to work hard to achieve nothing instead. I have seen many families break up; I have seen many of them get depressed. A lot of them leave NZ after a few years of putting up with abuse, some leave for Australia; some go back to their home country. Some of the migrants who have some kind of support network and can stand the abuse or work as self-employed may stay and instead the way they cope with this culture is they turn to be like their kiwi abusive mates. I have seen some of them start cheating, stealing and exploiting others to be able to mentally integrate into the society around them and of course some of them do none of these and stay the way they were but in a less motivated, depressed slavery mood. Ironically when foreigners get ripped off by kiwis they get blamed for not being careful. I have seen young rich Japanese students who get bashed and their money get stolen but instead they will get criticized of being careless. Kiwi students and young generation have this mentality that foreigners are rich, are pain free and they have their money because their mummy and daddy gives them their money and they do not work hard for it so they deserve their money to be taken away from them because this is the kiwi land and if these foreigners want to stay here they should help us with our economy. We are the best people in this world, our country is the most beautiful country in the world, our government is the least corrupted government of the world (of course that is the other way round), our graduates are the brightest in the world, our poo and wee is from gold and because of all these all non-kiwis should adore us and pay us lots and lots of money because we deserve it. New Zealanders are very jealous towards Australians. You just need to tell them how better Australia is compared to NZ. Then you get a sheep thrown to your head and they fart angrily into your face. I have seen some of these kiwis when they come to Australia they brag about their country to other nationalities to encourage them to visit their country and this way to help their highly dependent economy. Some of them say funny lies, For example they say they have lived in many countries all around the world and nowhere else is like New Zealand , The best wheater, the best health system, the best education, the best and most friendly people, no corruption, no crime, affordable and great lifestyle, etc, etc. The funny thing is some of them claim they were Aussies and now live in NZ because Australia had lots of crime, Australians were racist, Australia was this and that and NZ is the best p

I am flying from Edinburgh Airport to London Heathrow Airport and my flight will be landing at terminal five next monday and we're flying Virgin to Miami from terminal 3. My BA flight arrives at T5 07.55 and my flight to Miami on Virgin is 09.40 and I think we have to be at the gate at least 20-30 mins before the flight takes off our bags are going straight through to Miami so we don't have to collect our bags and recheck them and I will check us in online to save time so all we will have to do is go through security how long does it take to get from T5 to T3 once we get off our flight. I am usure whether or not to go my travel agent and ask them to change my flight to the day before which will cost a fortune and stay over night in a hotel or just leave it in the lap of the gods and hope I won't miss my flight. Can anyone help thanks.
