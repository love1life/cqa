20090220084504AAkfNkl	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can i file my son even though he don't live with me?	Need help with this.   I have a son that lives with my parents b/c he refuse to follow my rules.He won't work, all he want to do is hangout with his friends and smoke marijuana.He is 22 years old and don't have a clue what he want in life.I love him with all my heart but i also have too younger kids that i have to rise and they both r on the right track.What am doing is giving my son tuff love   but my parents do everything for him and that's why he want to live with them and not me.   Now here's the big problem.   My mom always say things to hurt my feelings and she even tell my son that i don't care r love him b/c i don't do anything for him.I have tried all i can do to help my son.I have taken him to rehab, i have talk to him about helping himself and i even tried to get him to go back to school.I told my parents as long as they keep doing every thing for him he will never get off his butt and do nothing for himself.      This is the real problem between me and my mom.She is mad at me for filing my son on my return which i have been doing all his life.She tried to file him this year without talking to me first. She feel that since he live with them that she should file him. I understand her point but my parents have money and they r not having any fanatically diffiucty at all.Am a singal mom trying to make ends meet and some times i don't even know where my next meal is coming from.She isn't  trying to help me at all. I don't want her to give me anything out of her own pocket but, by her trying to take the little bet of money that can help me out a lot she think that she deserve it more then me b/c my son live there. My dad tried to tell her that she shouldn't do this to me b/c they don't need the money to let me have it so i can take care of some bills. My question is can the IRS make me give her the money b/c he live with her r am i entilte to file my son even though he don't live with me.Is it different from filing and adult then it is to file a child under the age of 18

20090220091636AAkwPlH	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Why do real estate websites look like they were put together buy incompetent monkeys?	Does anyone agree with me or know the answer to why these sites look like they were put together by incompetent monkeys? Some sites may be worse than others but they all seem to have the same flaws. They camera pictures are always horrible and there description of property features is incomplete and horribly organized.    I'm not saying I am looking to buy a house directly online, but there needs to be a little more description of what the house looks like. These picture do give a good sense of specific features in the house, fireplaces, new appliances and unique features, with few exceptions to the give an idea of the size of the room, the location of the room in the house, or the orientation of the room in the house, and god forbid they actually put some kind of floor plan in the house. I even saw one house listed were the only picture of it was half covered by a tree the photographer ( if you can call them that) could have easily eliminate the problem by moving to the right 3ft.   The list of property features is a good example of how horribly there done.   Year Built: 1964    3 total bedroom(s)    2 total bath(s)    Master bedroom    Total full bath(s)    Approximately 1100 sq. ft.   Four or more stories    Master bedroom is 10x14    Living room is x20    Dining room is 9x11    Family room is 8x8    Kitchen is 8x    Basement level is sq. ft.    Garage    Heating features: Forced Gas Heating,    Forced Air Heating    Forced air heat       Anyone else think that list was put together and written in about 15 min? I know I do. Barley any information and half the stuff is duplicated. It looks horribly unprofessional.   I guess I just expect a little more professionalism from a company that takes 7% of your home’s value to sit on their *** until a buyer comes along. I work in the restaurant industry and if I had this bad of service I would be fired and I work for 10-20 dollars a sale not several thousand. But in the end what do you expect from someone that only has 50-60 hours of pre job training, when a burger flipper gets almost half that.

20090220093952AAkpL1j	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Apartment, Trailer? What should I do?!?	I'm in an apartment now.  It's a very small one bedroom.  The main problem is that there is a major pest problem.  It doesn't matter what I do, they are always there.      $350 for:   1 br, 1 bath, not spacious at all   cable is included   water is included   wood panel walls...multi-colored gray carpet, OLD ("dark" feeling)   roaches included   "central" heating/cooling consists of a wall unit in the living room with a small vent in the wall that blows into the bedroom   poor maintenance   third floor   good neighbors   my cat is allowed         I have been looking around for a new place and have come upon two options.      $450 for:   small trailer in nice park, wooded   2 br, 2 bath   basic cable (1-13 + showtime)   wood panel walls, burgundy carpet, old but not dirty  ("dark" feeling)   washer/dryer   dishwasher   across the street from a cop   central heat/air   my cat would be happy in the forest      OR      $450 for:   large 1br, 1 bath apartment   rent usually $480, but I have a chance to sublease for $450   yellowish stucco walls, wood and carpet floors, all new (bright!)   washer/dryer   no dishwasher   2nd floor   my cat is allowed if no other tenants see her and she doesn't tear things up   cable is included      I'm torn.  Both of these options are things I would have to take within two weeks.  I'm just not happy where I am.  It's tiny and dark and just gross.  If they were better about pest control then I'd be more willing to tough it out with the space.  I feel, though, that the dark surrounding all the time contributes to my mood and makes me feel "blah" all the time.  I like the privacy of the trailer, but the inside of the apartment more.  It's bright and fresh.      What do you think is best?

20090220102732AAQA3Gw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Question regarding Hiring Process & Background Check?	Ok here's the situation. I just got hired at a large national chain gym. I filled out applications, emplyee disclosure papers, w2 form, and the whole 9 yards. I did give my employer permission to do drugtest and perform background and do whatever they need to do. My problem is that last November I was charged with marijuana class c misdemeanor. I completed deferred disposition and it was dismissed. So if it appears on my record it's only a charge, not a conviction. My employer has told me already that I'm hired and I'll start next week because the paperwork needs to process. I technically lied on the app on the part that asks if you hav ever been charged. What's the chance this "processing of the paperwork" will deny me my job? I mean, wouldn't you think that if I've already done the w2 thing and provided direct deposit bank info that the I'm pretty much safe. Serious opinions please...and how does this process work?

I was hired to work 11am-7pm Tuesday-Saturday, 37.5 hours after lunch break of 30 minutes, so they rarely pay OT. I actually get minimum wage $7.15 per hour plus 10% commission, about $50 per day, so my wage actually works out to about $13.xx per hour.   Wednesday I worked 9-5. Today I worked midnight to 8. I didn't even get 8 hours at home! Tomorrow I work 11-7. Next week, I don't even know my days off yet, though it is Friday.   Is this legal? 7 hours off between days stinks. Not knowing when you will be off stinks. I have worked two half days making the work week 6 days.   I can't quit, this is about the best money I could make... I just don't know how they can make such a mess of your work schedule. When I was hired, the employee manual stated you'd be given a set schedule.

20090220114211AAgRMGj	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Can i collect unemployment in NYS for "being discharged for bad attitude and aggresive behavior"?	I started working at this place about 1 year ago, i've been let go once before for misconduct, specifically insubordination. They rehired me about 3-4 months ago.. two weeks ago i was let go again.      it's kind of weird restaurant to work at, its not corporate at all. they have no rules or policies you have to sign. Everyone there back talks each other, even the managers. people tell each other to shutup, people knock things out of each others hands deliberatly, its like being in a mens locker room, almost everyone is consistently disrespectful to each other, but in a joking sort of way. Obviously you cant be late / miss days, but there is no actual rule saying so. they will tell you not to be late, but nothing documented.      one co-worker, the reason i was let to go due to on going disputes with this 50 year old guy (he smokes crack, very unstable). he has threatened me with violence, sometimes wielding a knife, or throwing a 10lb meat hammer at a metal sink, or sometimes just verbally abusive. I've done well at keeping my cool in front of him, being passive-aggresive, but not calling him names, or threatening or anything.      The last dispute before i was let go was because the guy can't read. Because of this i have to tell him what food to make as the orders come up. This is not something ive been trained to do, and the guy flips out when i'm not being as clear and helpful as he wants. After being verbally berated by him, we end up getting in an argument.      I feel its unfair that i have to order this old man around because he cant read, then he gets mad about it. I dont flip out but i ask him to leave me alone and not order me around, and treat me with some respect.      So now i recieve a questionaire from NYS department of labor saying my former employer is contesting my claim.      Did they have just reason to fire me, and if so can i still collect unemployment? considering there is no defined rules and policies shouldn't that work for my benefit?      In a work climate that encourages back talk and disrespectful behavior, can it be considered discrimination towards me, considering i was fired for not getting along with a co-worker (not management) when everyone in the place shares this persona?

20090220120426AAI67hv	Business & Finance;Corporations	What benefits do i get for being a part time ups unloader?	I recently (jan 5th) started working for ups as a part time unloader. The work sucks and i'm only getting 8.50/hr when i do the most work and the hardest work out of any employee, except for maybe the loaders. My last paycheck had a $12 initiation fee for the union, which as a college student, 12 bucks is a lot considering my check is only 100/week. My check was the same amount this time so i'm guessing i have to pay 12 bucks to the union ever paycheck? What benefits will i get being a part time worker, and when will i get them. Also, i asked my supervisor what i get for paying dues to the union and he said he really didn't know. So what does it mean me being in this union? And how does this tuition assistance crap work? Do i actually get anything special from doing all this hard work or am i working for the wrong company?      Sorry if i'm asking a lot of questions, i'm just really confused why i keep hearing this is such a good job when the work sucks, the pay sucks, and so far i haven't gotten anything except for a sore back.

20090220120632AA0Ttpn	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Why am I suddenly being transferred all the time and not given any significant work to do?	I've been transferred twice in the last five years with no reason given. When I asked this last time, they mumbled something about budget cuts. Every transfer is also to a lower ranking supervisor within the department. Since my latest transfer this past September, my new supervisor has given me no significant work to do. Other people there all seem to have assignments are are busy working on them. It's my gut feeling that my last supervisor before this told him that I make too may mistakes and don't work fast enough, a frequent contention between us and a problem when working with people who are roughly half my age. Having nothing to do makes the days long and frustrating, so I tried Internet browsing to fill the boring hours. Now twice within the last week he has told me - no Internet use unless it is work-related. Then I brought in a word puzzle book. He is not happy with that either and said he didn't want be doing any games or puzzles because if someone came in the room and saw it, it would reflect badly on HIM. What am I supposed to do all day - just sit, stare at the ecru walls and twiddle my appendages? I'm afraid if I complain to HR, they will investigate and determine my services aren't really needed and get canned, if I am not on the brink now. After putting in 36 years with this employer, and on the verge of retiring, you think they could treat me a little better. Right now I feel like I'm just treading water until I'm eligible for retirement in 5 years. One of my friends theorizes that since I am near retirement, they may be trying to frustrate me to the point I quit so they won't have to pay my pension. What's your gut feeling? (I know you're only hearing my side of it, but that's all I can tell you).

Today I got a mail from CollectComCredit with a title called "Urgent Notice" It basically informed me that If I don't pay off the rest of $600 in 24 hours they will advise their client of the most efficient method of collecting my account.    I m confused on what that means and what will happen to me. I do plan on paying off the rest of the debt between march-April do I have enough time?

I currently live in a privatly rented property with my 6 year ol daughter, but there has been constant problems with the heating and the wall in my daughters bedroom is crumbling and soaking wet due to a damp problem.  I have been to the council on numerous occassions and they tell me they cannot help me as my house is adequate to my needs - which I cannot see how.  Most nights my daughter has to sleep with me purely because of the smell of damp in her room and she and I are constantly ill.  I am now without heat (in my 2nd week now but was also without heat and hot water for 2 weeks over xmas aswell) as my boiler has packed up (this has been ongoing since I moved in 4 yrs ago) and my landlord is extremely reluctant to sort it.   How can I make the council see that this is a problem and I need help getting housed?   Although I am working I am on a low income and cannot look at renting privatly again!

20090220122558AAlCtaL	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	My landlord is increasing rent for my new lease; is this common practice?	I received a notice in the mail from my landlord regarding the upcoming expiration date of my current lease and renewal of a new lease.  I have to decide before next week, which is 60 days till the end of my current 12-month lease.  The rent is increasing an extra $24/mo for a new 12-month lease.  If I renew before next week, I get a new LCD, plus $288 off the first month.  Am I allowed to negotiate, so that I decline the $288, so my rent is the exact same as it is now ($24 x 12 mo = $288 anyway)?  My current rent is $895, and I want to keep it at that.      Additionally, if I sign a 3-6 month lease instead, it's an increase of $60/mo, and if I sign a 7-11 month lease, it's an increase of $55/mo.. without any deals.        Because I am getting increasingly tired of Chicagoland winters, I was prepared to sign a 6-month lease.  But now with the increase, my younger brother (who pays half) wants to stay 12 months (another winter).  If we do decide to move in 6 or 7 months, would it be fairly easy to find cheaper rent for a nice and safe apartment in a warmer climate?  And do most apartments increase rent and add higher fees for shorter leases?

Now the Wells Fargo guy is telling me that they need to charge my credit card $350 for appraisal before they can submit it to the underwriter. Not necesarilly to have the appraisal done, but if I decide to pull out then they will reimburse me $300 keeping $50 for the trouble. He said this is how it's done now, starting about 2 weeks ago.

The account holder has the same name as mine but the address is in Jackson, Florida. I live in Chicago. I disputed that it was not my account. BoA insists it is mine. I asked for a copy of credit card application but they refused to provide me.       Following advices from the Yahoo Answer, I asked BoA if the account holder used my social security number to open the account.  BoA stated that my social security number is "associated" with the account and read the number over the phone.  It was my social security number.      I was freaking out that my ID is stolen.  I looked up the address of the account on the Duval County (Jacksonville is in Duval County) property appraiser website  to find out the owner of the house.  I used a paid white page serive to find the phone number.   Maria, the owner of the house, was very kind on the phone and informed that there was a person with same name as mine used to rent her house a while ago.  But the person was a woman (I am a man).  She was a visiting professional at Univerisity of North Florida.  Maria said she was good a tenant but did not have social security number when she was applying for rental.  I went to a local social security office to learn that they do not issue social security number to people on visiting visas.      I never had any account with BoA.  Where could BoA get my social security number.  I demanded to BoA for answer: by phone and mail.  NO RESPONSE except to say that "after through investigation, we conlude that it is your account..."  I am writing another letter to BoA.      Anyone know how and where BoA could get my social security number???  How could this kind of things happen????

Since the beginning of this mess, he has lost $42K. He contributed $35K. The account is now worth $35,480, so he's about to be losing what he physically put in. Can they do that? He still has seven years until retirement. If the stocks keep going down, can his account get down so low it won't recover before he retires? What will the TSP say then? "Tough luck, Chuck!

I currently live in an apartment with a far reaching waterfront view and a 5 minute walk from the beach, which is all very nice - but goes unnoticed most of the time if i'm totally honest.      I'm now looking to buy a family house and am looking at an area that has both a very attractive waterfront, but also has a vast forested national park both within a few miles of each other.      I'm looking at houses in between the beach and forest, thinking that i'll have easy access to both BUT i'm starting to realise that by being equally close to both that i actually see neither on a day to day basis.      I can't look out and see the ocean and smell it on the wind nor can i step outside and instantly be among nature.      What do you think?      Is it better to be within 1-2 miles of both the seafront and the forest but not really see either from the house OR do you think is makes more sense to pick one and have it on your doorstep?      Thanks

About 2 weeks ago I sent my resume/cover letter to a local employer that doesn’t have a current posting looking for help. I found out yesterday that there is a current employee that is leaving very soon. It’s unlikely they will post for the new open position so I don’t want to wait for that. They typically hire internally or hire someone a current employee is friends with or related to it seems. What should my next step be? I don’t want to seem to forward or come off as a pest but I want to do everything I can to get a chance at the opening. Should I call, send a letter, or wait for them to call me? I might add I am VERY qualified for the position but it seems that’s not the kind of thing that matters to this employer.

I am a little behind on my house payments, and I've been trying to find info online about what is going to happen.  But I haven't found anything that answers some of my specific questions.  If the foreclosure process starts before I pay what I owe, do I get to catch up to avoid foreclosure?  Or is it too late?  And in the event that it does happen, I can take out a hardship loan from my 401K, and i just wanted to know what happens when I do that.  How much money is the mortgage company going to want?  Do I pay that back to the 401K?    Sorry I'm kinda in the dark about this stuff.  Thanks for anyone who tries to help.

20090220132128AArpfQ7	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question about appraisals on a new construction home?	In May 2008 I purchased a new construction home for $284k. It's about 1850 sq feet. Comparable homes in the area were going for around $30k less than that. The appraiser that the home builder used appraised the house at the sales price . The true market value was obviously less than that due to comparable houses in the area going for less.       I understand that if you apply for a loan and the appraisal comes back as less than sales price they wont give you the loan (FHA) and in most situations the builder would lower the price of the house. Do I have any recourse against the appraisal company who did my house. The appraisal company was picked by the home builder and to my knowledge i didn't have a say in the matter.       Yes I understand that I probably should not have purchased the house at an inflated price based on the knowledge I had. there were some other factors involved that made us purchase the new construction rather than a different house who's price was lower.      My question is, is there any recourse against the appraisal company who obviously falsified their appraisal to get it to the number that the builder wanted it to be?

20090220131849AAZ0wMY	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What would qualify as an adequate middle class income?	I'm an undergraduate college student trying to decide which education/career path to follow in the psychology/social work field. I'm most interested in mental health counseling. The average yearly earnings is between $26,780 and $45,610.        I don't plan on having children anytime soon, and I definitely don't plan on being a single mom, but I do want to be prepared in case I end up in this situation. I'm not necessarily looking to make a lot of money; I just want to make enough to live comfortably in the middle class. (I'm trying to decide if I need to focus on a more profitable psych specialty in order to achieve this.)       So, what sort of yearly income numbers should I be hoping to achieve?

20090220132206AAM3ie8	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	IRS is applying part of our refund to an old tax liability.  How long will this delay our refund?	It was a liability that I've actually paid twice now, but each time I call them they say it's been cleared up but it's not.  I'll argue with them AGAIN after we get our refund.  I don't want to open that can of worms in the midst of getting our refund.
20090220132344AAIFA9W	Business & Finance;Corporations	Why do bank owned foreclosures resell for 3 times or more than what the foreclosure was assumed?	With SO many foreclosures on the market and hundreds more every day, WHY are the REO's so expensive and hard to negotiate with?  Quite often that county's property appraiser's office will show what the note was bought for and the resale price is quite hefty!  I tried to negotiate with Fanny Mae TWICE on 2 different properties and they stubbornly held to their selling price of 3 times over the foreclosed amount!  This was BEFORE the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac collapse!  No pity for them here!

20090220132437AAiiP8U	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I really need job Advise.?	So recently, my company held a meeting, were a very small company.  I always have considered quitting because i hate it here, but I chose to stay because of the economy.  In this meeting our CEO let us know that our company is hurting, and that as a result he was either going to have to fire a few people, or cut salaries by 30%.  He chose to cut salaries by 30%.  I think I would have prefered to be layed off so I could claim unemployment while I searched for a new job.  If I quit I can't claim unemployment right?  Can I ask to be layed off?  I went from 50K to 35K a year.  I am 22, with no expenses, but i dont want to get stuck here any longer, the work i do is painful.  I live at home with my parents at the momment.      advise? similar experiences?
20090220132551AAQ5rHy	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Should I be a medical assistant or RN?	There is an obvious answer to this since RNs make a LOT more money than medical assistants, but hear me out :)  My husband and I are living paycheck to paycheck with me staying home, as we have one son and one due in May.  I know I want to do something in the medical field, and I love the schedule a medical assistant has, but the pay isn't that great.  On the other hand, RNs make a lot more, but have awful schedules.  I don't know what to do, I am going back to school for my family, so we can afford things, but I don't necessarily want to take a job that keeps me from them...help!

20090220133058AAROMWC	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Removing person from deed to refinance but in nursing home?	In dec of 2004 I moved in to help grandma maintain her care etc... She transferred half of her house to me at same time, I paid off her loan through a refi deal took out extra cash to fix place up a bit.   (still needs much more work tho)   In June of 2007 she unfortunetly was placed in nursing home by the County because her condition just got too bad. She was not penalized by the "36" month look back period for medicaid (now it's 5 years I hear) and  I have been maintainging the property on my own entirely.   I would like to take advantage of the lower interest rates and fix up the property even more so as it is falling apart.  My grandmother has made suggestions  to just transfer the entire house to me, but I am hesistant as I do not want to affect her eligiblity. If I can still refinance alone without her on the loan is thier any problems or should I pursue getting the entire house transferred. Thank you   I live in Pennsylvania.
20090220133237AAr3oAr	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What are the first steps to refinance my home?	I still owe 75% on my existing mortgage, am I obligated to stay with my current lender?  If not, what do I do first?     - Call local banks?   - Do the web search and go with the lowest % rates when they list the bigger lending companies in the results?      By the way, we have 6.25% now... should I not fool with all this unless I can get below 5.25?        Thanks in advance!
20090220133437AAS9qJi	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	My FICO scores vary widely - will I qualify to get a loan?	My FICO scores are 616, 682, 734...for the three bureaus. I would like to buy a home but I don't know if my credit is good enough to actually afford one with these scores...  In the past, I defaulted (horribly) on my student loans and I have no credit cards. However, I have rehabilitated my student loan and I'm going to attempt to apply for a credit card to bring my worthiness up.      Should I wait until I increase my score but miss out on a possible deal or should I try to buy something now? I am looking for something in the 150K range and I would put down 10-15%.
