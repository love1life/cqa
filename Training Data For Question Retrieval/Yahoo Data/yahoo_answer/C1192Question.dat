20070612051556AA2BNCQ	Beauty & Style;Hair	I've got damaged brown, shoulder-length hair, how to make it healthy,shiny and cure it?	Hey,      I have experimented with my hair a lot,with all kinds of highlights,different variations of black,light brown etc...I also used to use blow-drying a lot (like every morning).       For the past 5 months have not coloured it,neither used blow-dryer, but had all kinds of hair masks, expensive conditioners etc...now it kinda looks better, but my hair used to b straight,and now is kinda weavy, because its dry now. Is there any way I can keep them always straight without an iron?      I use it when I go partying (like 1-2 times a week),but on the other days just let it dry out naturally, which does not look as good. Or should I just be patient and wait till my natural hair will grow out?It will last for a long time though...and I want to have quiet long hair!      I am also going to Ibiza in 3 weeks, which means my hair will be wavy all the time because of the sea, and damaged more because of the sun and saulty sea...any way I can protect my hair and keep it straight same time?thanks

Had nostril pierced a week ago.All seems fine,but this evening after I had salt soaked it & was drying the inside with a cotton bud,it half popped out.I dropped a couple of drops of salt water from a clean cotton bud on the exposed bar bit & popped it back in.Was this ok to do?...Also the outside looks perfect (touch wood),not red or swollen,but the inside looks a bit swollen,sometimes more than others...Also there dosen't seem to be any muck or crusties,is this ok?...I thought the muck was part of a healthy healing process.

20080111192742AAcfSEw	Beauty & Style;Hair	Does my new hair color look good with my skin color?	I asked this question earlier under an account I use more than this one but pictures weren't showing.   I'm fair but not too light and for another month anniversary my husband asked me what I wanted and I said a new look so he took me to the salon and I told him to help me pick the color. He chose a light auburn with an orange-red tint to it (more orange than red) that looks very light brown or dark blonde with auburn tones to it. Anyway, I don't know if the color is too light for me (They put the Sunberry color 72R but my hair looks more like the 31R Sunny auburn using no bleach)   Do you think I'm too dark to have my new hair color. My hubby likes it but I'm trying to adjust. The good thing is that I can always go darker in the future versus trying to go lighter with dark hair. Thanks      Btw. My hair was a light reddish brown before the change.    http://s251.photobucket.com/albums/gg297...  scroll down

20080311182303AAZw64a	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I keep my hair healthy, while also straightening it?	When I was younger my hair was DEAD straight. I could put as many curlers in it as I wanted but it would just stay straight. Now it is a frizzy, puffy, wavy mess. If I don't straighten it, I will look like I have an afro, but since I started straightening it, it has lost its shine and smoothness. It also has really bad split ends and is frizzy. How can I keep it straight but healthy at the same time?

20080430204453AAf73ZO	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Question about being "pretty"?	Please be nice when answering this question:      Are you still pretty if you have to work a bit at it? I get that some people are naturally good looking. But if you're average and you take time to make yourself look better, are you pretty?      One girl I know looks pretty, but I've only ever seen her with fake eyelashes and lots of makeup... A lot of the time I don't feel pretty unless I'm wearing makeup and straighten my hair. I'm wondering if this means I'm ugly.      Sorry, I'm not trying to be shallow, I've just been thinking a lot lately about attractiveness and how I hope it relates to relationships. (Also, I know it what's inside is important, but 99% of people take appearance into consideration).      Thanks for your thoughts everyone
20080502175315AAofWtp	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	UGGs??????????????	Will U stop buying them and wearing them???      Do u know that so many sheep have been killed that they can't keep up with demand? That’s y there sold out      Will u stop wearing them now?       Do u feel sorry 4 the sheep?      Do you have to really kill the poor sheep just to make a pair of UGG boots?   The answer is YES. The sheep has to be slaughter to obtain their hide and fleece. Now once the sheepskin hides are taken from the sheep then the process of preparing the hide for manufacturers and ensuring the hides are up to export standard begins.       Woolskins are usually preserved with salt prior to being processed by tanneries. At the tannery the skins are processed in large vessels called paddles which vary in capacity from 3000 to 15000 liters. In contrast to hide processing, in woolskin processing mechanical action is kept to a minimum in order to minimize felting of the wool. Rotating blades on the paddles move the skins slowly and gently, and processing is performed at much higher float ratios (typically 20-35 liters of water per skin) than are used in hide processing.       Typically it takes about 10 working days for the skins to be tanned and finished ready to be cut into panels for ugg bootsUGG? Australia uses only the best quality sheepskin exclusively. Twin-faced sheepskin is used in many of our core products. A piece of twin-faced sheepskin has been treated on both the fleece side, and the skin side.      The wool of genuine sheepskin is extremely dense (more-so than any synthetic), which provides for a more comfortable and durable material.      Fleece breathes, wicks moisture away, and allows air to circulate, keeping feet dry.      Sheepskin is naturally water resistant & therefore small amounts of moisture will not seep through or damage it.      UGG? Australia sheepskin is naturally thermostatic & therefore will keep bare feet warm in temperatures as low as -30°F and cool in temperatures as high as 80°F (Sheepskin will naturally insulate by keeping feet warm in the winter & cool in the summer.)      The sheep that we use have finer wool & cleaner skin (skin!)
