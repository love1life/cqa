Hey, I just ran some calculations to prove that space habitation is necessary and I got back scary numbers.       There are 6,706,993,152 (July 2008 est.) people in the world   Source    https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...    There are 148,940,000.00 sq km of land, same source.       That means       (Area of land/number of people) will give us land unit per person or .0222066724 sq km of land per person on earth, about 5 acres.       (Number of people/area of land) will give us person per land unit 45.03151035 people per sq km of land.       At least 1.2 acres of farmland is needed to support a person  http://dieoff.org/page40.htm       Of course this assumes that all land on earth is farmable, but the CIA fact book mentions that only 10.57% of the earth's land can be farmed. 10% of 5 acres is .5 acres of farm land per person. Falling below the min. amount of farmland. But, I think I made an error. Can you check. I'm doing this for the Dupont essay contest. Thank you so much.

I ended up getting another 6 hours of sleep and I'm drinking water, but my headache is still here, though it is not as intense. I'm sure I'm fine, but I just wanted to make sure because I think I might be coming down with a cold.       Thanks!

20090128112711AAi5kDr	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Can you give me a rational explanation for what I think were encounters with the paranormal?	1. There was one night, sometime after my grandmother passed away, that I was putting my younger brother in his crib and then went to my own room to go to bed. As I lay there trying to fall asleep, a light which I can only describe as moonlight dancing on water appeared on my closet door. I heard someone (I thought my grandma) call my first name several times. I was unable to move during this. It lasted a few seconds. When it ended, I ran into my mother's room. To this day, she does not believe me.      2. My brother, now 26 and in the Coast Guard, let out a blood-curdling yell and to this day insists there was a woman in his closet with what he described as a leapord outfit on.      3. I normally used to get home before everyone else when I was in high school. On this particular day, I went home as usual, through the side door as usual and directlly downstairs because I needed to put something in the washing machine in a hurry. While down there, I heard someone call my name from upstairs so I yell to them that i was downstairs. It was woman's voice so I assumed it was my mom. I continued doing my business and the voice called me again. I replied the same. The voice called me again. This time, I ran upstairs still thinking it was my mother and said, "Didn't you hear me say I was downstairs?" No one was there. I booked down to my friend's house IMMEDIATELY!!      4. I lived with my mother and my stepfather after leaving college for half a year. The home was previously the home of his now dead wife, who died from Cancer years ago. Well, one night, I'm either trying to wake up or woke, but I could not move an inch. I felt a very very dark presence near me and something was sniffing at my face like a dog. Some call it Old Hag Syndrome, so i've wrote that off but still not 100% sure about it.      5. After my young cousin died from Cancer, we went to Georgia for the funeral and I slept in her room. All I can say is suffocation. Something was thick in that room and I shudder to know what. I had to sleep in the living room.

20090128114235AA0dsFl	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Hurricanes:  If you research or know because you live in an area, what were some major storms of the past?	I'm curious with all the talk of global warming causing bigger or more storms.  I remember lots of hurricanes when I was a kid and there seems to be less of them now.  I think they are cyclical and people who get wound up about them are young and do not remember the earlier ones like some of us older people do.  I'm 53 and my parents used to talk about tremendous ones.  When I was a baby one ripped the roof off my parents house even.  I include blizzards in this as well.  I have a photo of my dad in the 1940s standing in front of his house and the snow was over the top of a roof (of a first floor level porch).    I remember reading about one hurricane in the Northeast USA in 1938 that caused devastation and tons of deaths.  The point is that there have always been major storms.  What other storms have there been and where were they?  I'll bet someone will come up with a web site that talks about certain ones that would be interesting to read.

20090128115528AA5ZDeP	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Ankle sprain or Ankle fracture?	I was at gymnastics training on Saturday and I landed a flick (flick-flack or handspring) incorrectly onto the side of my ankle. I heard a pop, but nothing major that would normally worry me, my ankle joints are always popping and just assumed it was that.    Since then it has been unbelievably painful to put any pressure on it at times. There are times where I can walk on it and then I'll just put my foot down funnily again and I can't put any pressure on it again. There seems to be no bruising or obvious swelling, although the other first aider at the gym (there's two of us) said she thought the ankle looked slightly larger than the other.    There are indications of both a sprain or a fracture, so I'm not sure where to go with it at the moment. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, but if it's a fracture, I'd rather go to A&E sooner rather than later.    There is slight numbness in the area - indicative of a fracture  There is no lumpyness and my bone doesn't look crooked - indicative of a sprain  The pain is unbelievable when I do walk on it funnily, to the point, where I want to curl up in a corner and die - indicative of a fracture  I can move my ankle to a point, but again it's so the pain is intense, and as a dancer, the lack of mobility worries me - indicative of a sprain  There is point tenderness and my ankle does feel unstable - indicative of a fracture    I can flick, so obviously I don't think the impact was too much, but I know I use too much power to flick and I was on a sprung floor and I know the general rule is the harder and faster the impact and the more it hurts the more likely it is to be a fracture, but I'm still hoping for a sprain.    What do you think? Treat as a worst case scenario or use RICE like I have been since it happened? Wait to see the doctor tomorrow or go to A&E right now?

I recently went home to visit, and pulled it down. Still nothing.     One night, my sister and I got it out again. Nothing for a while, then it started going. She'd lift her hands from it and it would still be going. I'd lift my hands, too so she could see.     I was really really freaked out. We got from it that their name started with a T and they were born in the 1800's [I can't remember the specific year]. It was really crazy!    Has anyone else had anything happen with one?

In case you are wondering how you will get 40 points from this, I will give you the best answer from this question (10 points) and post 3 other (random) questions and give you the best answer for those as well. Please help!         1. Explain the following seeming contradiction: You have two gases, A and B, in two separate containers of equal volume and at equal pressure and temperature. Therefore, you must have the same number of moles of each gas. Because the two temperatures are equal, the average kinetic energies of the two samples are equal. Therefore, since the energy given such a system will be converted to translational motion (that is, move the molecules), the root mean square of the two are equal, and thus the particles in each sample move, on average, with the same relative speed. Since A and B are different gases, they each must have a different molar mass. If A has a higher molar mass than B, the particles of A must be hitting the sides of the container with more force. Thus the pressure in the container of gas A must be higher than that in the container with gas B. However, one of our initial assumptions was that the pressures were equal.      2. Calculate the percent change in volume of air trapped in bread dough when heated from 20 oC to 100 oC.      3. The exosphere is defined as the region of the atmosphere in which molecular collisions are so infrequent that the average distance that a molecule must travel before colliding is at least the radius of the earth. The region begins at about 700 km at which height the temperature is about 1200 K. The density of molecules is 1.0x109 molecules per liter. What is the equivalent pressure?         4. The stopcock between a 3.00 L bulb containing oxygen at 195 torr and a 2.00 L bulb containing nitrogen gas at 535 torr is opened. After equilibration, what is the pressure in the system?

20090225075522AAGgLBv	Science & Mathematics;Biology	If evolution is true, why do we not see any transitional forms?	Surely, the least evidence we could expect would be creatures moving around with partially formed wings, extra set of legs / arms / feet /ears / eyes / teeth...the list is endless. I often think i could use an extra pair of arms myself.

20090225074507AAs6YUw	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Nand gate pin layout question?	Hi, I have a nand gate and I'm not sure my pins are right.  There is a circular dot in the chip over one pin, which I assume to be pin one.  I also believe pin seven to be ground and pin eight to be signal.  If this is correct then my problem is that pin one and two should be inputs with pin 3 being an output.  If I provide charge to one and two, three should not carry a charge.  I can not seem to get this to work.
