VLv3Vzjnaa	Their goal is to intimidate, silence, take away our civil rights and destroy gay American families.  In order to do this, they have to act in secret and sneak around and lie about what they are doing.  Just like they did on the Prop. 8 campaign.  Every commercial they produced was full of lies.  When pro-equality Americans have the audacity to complain, they are called "intolerant" and "violent" by Mormon spokespeople.  It's all part of an evil campaign to deflect attention from what they are doing to undermine civil liberties of gay Americans. They are undoubtedly still lying and probably contributed millions in their effort to redefine morality.  They want all Americans to believe that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "vote away the civil rights of law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans" and they will do anything necessary to accomplish this wicked goal.|`|F7y1BZ4Maa	The value of the Churchs in-kind (non-monetary) contribution is less than one half of one percent of the total funds (approximately $40 million) raised for the Yes on 8 campaign. The Church did not make any cash contribution.    Fox13 (Utah): The documents show the amount spent by the Mormon Church is greater than what was initially stated.     Fact: The Church, like other organizations on both sides of the ballot issue, was required to publicly file these donations by the 31 January deadline. The Church has been filing required contribution reports throughout the campaign. Those earlier donations initially stated were filed for specific time periods prior to this last reporting period, as required by law. Other groups are also filing their final contribution reports to meet the same deadline.     San Francisco Chronicle : Mormon church officials, facing an ongoing investigation by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, Friday reported nearly $190,000 in previously unlisted assistance to the successful campaign for Prop. 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California.   Sacramento Bee : The disclosure comes amid an investigation by the state's campaign watchdog agency into whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints violated state laws by not fully disclosing its involvement during the campaign.     Fact: This filing is in no way prompted by an investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission. Many organizations are filing this week to meet the deadline required by law. We believe we have complied with California law.     KFMB 760 AM (San Diego) :   Mormon Church Misstated How Much It Spent in Prop 8 Fight.   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints previously claimed only about $2,000 was spent in support of the measure.   365Ga y : Mormon Church admits it spent 100 times more for Prop 8 than reported     Fact: Again, the previous disclosure of an in-kind donation was to meet an earlier deadline. In fact, previous filings detailed over $50,000 out of the total non-monetary contribution of $189,903.58.This weeks filing reported donations that fell within a different time period and required reporting by the 31 January deadline. Other groups also made their final contributions reports this week.|`|jbUsd8m9aa	Because it is a church founded on lies, ie, the lie that Joseph Smith is a prophet, the lie that the BOM is a testament of Jesus Christ.|`|PeeIS28Oaa	And the truth comes out|`|IqPz1PZOaa	I don't know why The Church Of Jesus Christ OLDS tries to secretly keep nearly most, if not all of their financial records, completely hidden from not only all of their own members and the government but also the entire general public too.  It seems to only to undermine any more pleasant aspects of a church and perhaps leans the corporation a little bit closer toward appearing as a participant in secret occult-like, hidden behavior.    Perhaps despite how intelligent most members might probably like to believe their organization is viewed, this latest failed maneuver doesn't appear as a very smart blunder at all.  I guess it goes to help prove that what waddles and quacks surely must be nothing more than a flock of quacks.  The truly most disturbing continuation of ignoring the circulation of accessible Internet information, seems to combine with bad leadership skills alongside the horrible LDS guidance given to Mormon members.  Giving help to rapidly turn an otherwise scandalous incident into a far greater disaster, making these latest financial cover-ups much more explosively newsworthy than first ordinarily expected.

School employees, whether teachers or administrators, at public schools (this doesn't apply to private schools, whether they're religious or not) canNOT lead a prayer, tell students to pray, or discuss religion except in the context of a lesson in history or literature.    What typically happens when teachers (or administrators or elected school board members) pull these ill-advised stunts, unfortunately, is that the town or city is obligated to pay the legal cost of defending their employee's action, even though there's virtually zero chance of a court at any level suddenly ignoring all precedent and deciding the first amendment's establishment of separation between church and state somehow magically doesn't apply. So money that could otherwise have gone to making math class easier and/or less boring is wasted.    Shame on your teacher, if s/he did this.

So get your little thumbs down agoing, more mindlessness.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	No. Actually Jesus noted that it is better to pray in private. I doubt Jesus shunned group prayer. There is nothing wrong with group prayer when everyone agrees about it or when people join particularly for prayer, but Jesus says this:    Matthew 6:5-6: "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men....when thou prayest, enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret...."    Also, it depends as far as public schooling goes. Everyone's tax money pays for public school and a lot of people have different religions. To say a Christian prayer is not fair to all of the people who are not Christian, unless of course they are allowed to stand up and say their own prayer also. But then there would be a battle about who gets to pray first probably. Then it would probably start fights in the classroom. In the end the whole idea of school would have been wasted. The kids go there to learn scholastic. Ultimately it is not good in a public school. The US may have been primarily Christian in the past but as time goes by we are becoming a melting pot of different religions. And the constitution and enlightenment philosophy has secured that no one be treated unfairly due to their religion or race in this country. Especially if kids are required to pray in public schools that is not right.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	NO

And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like palms of hands or one eye or both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.)     The First Hadith:    Jareer ibn Abdullaah said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah (saw) about an accidental glance at a woman.

neuprBeGaa	I'm guessing that it was a private high school, not a public school.  If so, they were within their rights to expel the girls.

If a school tried to expel a kid for religion or race, they wouldn't be able to.  But for some reason the school can expel lesbians?  If anyone argues that homophobia isn't the same as racism and the such, tell them that discrimination is discrimination no matter the target.

Because they're not receiving any public funds for their school, they're not required to admit all students regardless of their orientation/gender identity.  If they feel that the student - or even the student's parents in some cases - are in violation of their religious teachings, they can be expelled.    It might not seem right, but it's entirely legal.

Maybe the dumb kids will get hit by the next car and realize that when you get hit by a speeding vehicle it will hurt you, life is not a video game.    This is exactly why I don't want to have kids because they will be exposed to a society that can't even find China on a map. What is even worse is some of these kids get into college.

Sera totalmente distinto si la conquista se hubiese hecho por otro tipo de pas. Principalmente por que, la cultura que los espa?oles vinieron a inculcar era una cultura de odio, enfermedad y muerte. Sera diferente por que no solo se trata de ganar territorio, tambin de inculcar costumbres, por ejemplo, la religin cristiana.

jcK6EXpiaa	yep. I believe in spanking as a last resort, so long as you are level headed while doing so and not angry. If you hit a kid while frustrated, then they learn that violence is how to deal with anger. My dad used to have us go pick out a stick to be spanked with. At first I thought it was becuse he was trying to punish us even more than just hitting us with his hand, but now I know it was so that he had time to calm down before spanking. IT was the same every time. First warning, second warning,then off you go to pick out your stick. If you didn't pick it out within 2 minutes, he picked it for you. then it was three swats accross the bottom. Rarely had to do it, and it wasnt like we didn't have clear warning. With my kids I just have to say "stop ___________" then, if it doesn't, I start the "thats one" "thats two!" "Ok, swat time" they are too little go outside and pick out a stick by themselves yet. But it rarely ever has to get to spanking anyways. But I do not believe in ever striking a child out of frustration. And I don't believe in severely spanking either, or spanking often (it loses its strong meaning when done too often) When they are old enough, I will switch to grounding.|`|PU6gJJ4Saa	Like my parents did me, bend over knee, raise hand, smack buttocks few times, spanking over.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	The key to good spanking is not being angry when you do it and to have a set number of spanks. A very important thing that needs to be done afterwards is to sit him on your lap and explain to him "why" you spanked him and that mommy loves him. You dont want to make a child afraid of you, just afraid of his consequenses for bad behavior.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	You asked this question a couple of weeks ago.  See my answer from then|`|VzvBN4ezaa	Yes I think getting him out of the bath was the right thing to do.  Its also important he listens to you right away with things like baths and playing in the street which can be quite dangerous to young children so in this case I think a spanking is warranted.
4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	I've personally never understood why they're called the seven deadly sins. Sin is sin and all sins are deadly. Yes God will forgive you if you ask.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Sure - if you confess and then repent    Repent is the hard part    The Seven Deadly Sins The Seven Deadly Sins, having come under recent scrutiny at the hands of the 1995 film, Se7en are:     Gluttony   Greed   Sloth   Lust   Vanity   Envy   Wrath     They are, though certainly sins that Scripture condemns, not to be found in Scripture in any such grouping. The seven sins originated in the writings of medieval theologues and have been remarked upon by such noted personages as Pope Gregory the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Geoffery Chaucer, and John Milton.     Also of interest is a Scriptural list that bears at least some similarity to the historical list of seven. Proverbs 6:16-19 reveals:  These six things the Lord hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren.     Now while these are clearly sins despised by the Lord, none of these are able to keep one from salvation if he will only repent and believe.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	"If we confess our sins he is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."   1 John 1:9    Yup! God will forgive you! ;)     PS: check out this video, it pretty much sums up God's love for us and salvation in 3 minutes and 48 seconds. :P   http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?vie...|`|de2AwHpHaa	you shall be forgiven  now continue to sin  you will be forgiven  continue...|`|Lc5FtItDaa	No difference sin is sin.    God will forgive any sin you confess.|`|V8qVsKhRaa	Of course you'll be forgiven. That's the whole point of Jesus dying for us-- if it was a one chance thing after He died, that'd be a waste b/c we're all gonna fail eventually.  God doesn't measure points like "Oh, he just killed someone, minus 10 points for him!" and then "Oh, she stole, only minus 3pts"  It's not about deeds, God forgives us if we ask him and try to change. If you just say "God, please forgive me" then do it KNOWING you're just pushing the boundaries, it's like testing God.  I recommend Battlefield of the Minds by Joyce Meyer. About a week ago, actually, I read the teens one and I honestly am thinking differently, like nicer and stuff.   Even the one for teens is good. I am a Christian, I believe in the Ten Commandments, but as the Bible says if you look at a girl w/lust, it's committing adultery in your heart. Definitely read Battlefield of the Minds and pray about it. Pray God help transform your mind.  Think about what you're thinking about. Joyce Meyer, in the end of the teens book, the conclusion chapter title was "WWJT" aka What would Jesus THINK. She said she thinks WWJD is only half of the battle, b/c our thought effect our actions. I agree completely.   I am no pro. that's for sure, all I can say is pray and read Battlefield of the Minds. Sorry I keep referring back to that, I just KNOW it will work. I promise you, even if it takes a few days, it'll work if you read it and try to do better. Hope it helps(:|`|2Hot9EJiaa	He will forgive, but only through the shed blood of Christ, and also repenting of the sin of lust, or any other sin for that matter, does not mean just to be sorry for it. It means TURNING from the sin of lust and going in God's direction.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	All sins are equal.  God WILL forgive you, though, if you come to Him in repentance! He's a more loving God than most people give Him credit for.|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	All sins is wrong.  The deadly ones are called deadly because of all the problems they lead to.  To be forgiven you have to repent.  To repent means to change your mind and turn from the wrong thing.  In your case, you must admit to God that lust is wrong and ask him to help you not to do it again.|`|AA11788494	Isn't forgiveness why your savior died on the cross?|`|UIvhYXLOaa	yes, but you should also go to confession to confess your sins, because it is thought that if you die without confessing a mortal sin, you go straight to hell.  god bless you!|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Yes he will forgive you even if you sin again...remember God used lust in minds of God's enemies to pay for the travels out of Egypt.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	You were before you came here.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Your sin is forgivable.    Perhaps you are talking about what the Catholic Church calls "Capital Sins",    Capital sins are sins that are especially likely to lead a person to engage in more sins.  The sin of "lust" is definitely such a sin.    I think the best way to accept the Mercy of Jesus Christ when you have sinned is through the Sacrament of Confession and Reconciliation.   Any Catholic priest can explain this to you.  You do not have to be a Roman Catholic in order to accept God's mercy this way.   Call any Catholic Church and ask when confession is available.      If you feel an urgent need, ask if you can make an appointment sooner or come in right away.  If you do not know how it works, ask the priest.  He can easily explain.  .  He was provided for this role to help you receive the Grace and Mercy of your savior. You can receive this sacrament in a face-to-face meeting or with a privacy screen between you and the priest to conceal your identity.  The Catholic Church has absolute confidentiality of information heard by the priest during this sacrament.  The priest can tell no person, and he himself can not make any use of the information you provide for his personal gain or anything else.  The sacrament is for the purpose of restoring the Peace between you and God that you have broken by your sins.    May peace be with you.|`|YaZlaMJWaa	of course, just for you not to be ashamed of it, every man has done no matter how smart they may look or so, i've done it, practically adam and Abraham did it lol|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	Yes you have been forgiven but that doesn't mean that you will not still have temptation. If it starts getting to be an obsession then seek guidence.  I think the 7 deadly are the ones that people fall into and have a heard time breaking out of. Maybe like heroin you get hooked fast. hmmmm don't know though.

Zs200bYRaa	Wow. I live here and this is what I have to say:  Extremely high taxes for towns that barely even provide for their community.  2 examples of this-  1. The education budget dropped from 15% in 2003 to 4% as of 2008 in my town.  2. My town just got a $100k grant to build a skate park. $35k was used, so, obviously, there was $65k left over. But, instead of saving that money for the town or giving it to the schools, we built an ugly hitachi park that nobody has used since its opening in September.

Everything that God created "was good, very good"But soon after creation God had to deal with all kinds of glitches. God created man to till a garden that he planted in the region of Babylon-today's Iraq. Adam was created in God's own image... MALE!  and in that image Adam was very much focused in finding a help meet or mate for himself among ALL THE ANIMALS that God created. Both of them were looking hard for a suitable animal while Adam was naming ALL the animals. Adam must have tried a sheep and who knows what else. Finally God admits a glitch in his creation repeating twice that his original very good idea about creating man alone is "no good" after all.. (Gen 2:18-20) Jesus taught to validate everything on the testimony of 2 or 3 witnesses. Christian theology does that on every Biblical doctrine!      Eve was created as an afterthought after it was found that no animal was suitable for Adam's pleasure. God created Eve under a tremendous amount of pressure a clear move away from his funky male only image. I am sure that God had created a way for reproduction of our human male species in his original plan, but we will never know. I wonder if any Creationist Scientist is taking the challenge to prove that man can make a sheep or any other animal pregnant with a human baby boy! Creationists read the Bible and look around for supporting evidence! This finding would be a simple proof that the Bible is truthful to science! By the time Eve was introduced to Adam, Adam knew a lot about animal sex so he was not acting like a nerd with her!... and so on... This is the honest Bible truth!

I am not religious, but I believe in good and bad, and possibly even a heaven of some sort. I think it is a part of nature, just a spiritual part instead of physical. I think people are numb to nature in general. I was born being sensitive and observant to it, but 99% of modern people are not. They were born with the intention of succeeding in the modern world, nothing more.  My brother watches absolutely horrible films with people getting cut up and to me it is just evil. He even laughs. He says it's his right to watch whatever he wants and that he isn't bad for watching it. But how can you enjoy it?    It frightens me, and I think becoming numb to watching these things, and finding them amusing is wrong and bad for society. I'm glad they scare me, because I'm a good person. I like having nice thoughts about I dunno, nature and sunshine, travelling...not torturing people!|`|AA11475307	Yeah. I've noticed this too. Especially on the street with people's body language    Is it a sign of a selfish 'me me me' society.

giwL7Iozaa	You contradict yourself several times.  You don't love and respect everyone since you hate people as long as you think you have a reason (does anyone hate anybody without thinking they have some excuse? No - that's the problem! The reason is usually false.)  You hate nearly everybody according to your list!  So maybe you need to look into yourself to see what YOUR problem is, and maybe actually read the Gospel of John (go ahead, it won't hurt you) to see actually what Jesus said rather than making false assumptions.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	People mess up their own lives by their own actions , but do not like admitting it ,and love blaming someone else for all their miseries.    You seem to be a person who likes putting the blame on everything that has gone wrong with your life on Jesus.    You also do not like people who are well educated, powerful and wealthy. Looks like you once wanted to be like them, but could not achieve it, hence decided to hate them .    You find it difficult to understand and follow the teachings of Jesus, so you want to hate Him as well.    You also seem to be in love with the word humanity in order to satisy yourself that you can still be good without loving Jesus.    From your question which states teaching, it seems that you want to start a religion of your own based on doing good to humanity and hating Jesus.    If I hated you and cursed you and spread false lies about you to everyone, would you let me enter your house? Definitely not.    After death there are only 2 houses. Heaven and Hell. Heaven is owned by Jesus and Hell is owned by Satan. We only have 70 or 80 years of life on Earth. Choose now where you want to spend eternity.     If you are working in an organisation, what would your manager do to you if you failed to listen to his instructions. He would throw you out.  What would happen if you do not listen to the instructions of the master of the Universe?    You would also hate the verses that I have pasted below ,but Iam still doing it since I follow a master that is Jesus, and I would never deny him before anyone.    Matthew 10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.     Matthew 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.    Matthew 10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.|`|AA12346961	Amen, bro.    I hate myself for having read all of this whiny crap. Just say that you are a pathetic moron who needs to re-assertain his love for himself because deep down he deeply believes that no one loves him -- including himself.    (I know how you feel. I've been there. But the real shitty truth is that Jeebus here is trying to make you feel bad about yourself by being too good to be true. Kill Him, I say.)    Alternatively, you can start believing that YOU are Jeebus and well, die at the cross. At which point, you'll declare that you genuinely pity every person on this planet.    Then you sort of grow bored of it all. And then you know that the whole Jesus loves you routine is just something that the smart-*** rulers of the society made up to keep to downright depressed about your self-image.    Because you were always good enough to love yourself. And you didn't even notice it.|`|AA11756151	whatever|`|5ab3665dd0c477ad8d7d745ebc949f38aa	Love is from God    A Christian ought to love  like a fish ought to swim, like a bird ought o fly, like a dog likes to chase cars,  It ought to be in their nature.

XPN3WI26aa	Well, giving in Christianity is for the purpose of glorifying God and showing how good of a Giver He is. Giving in Christianity is not for self-glorification. A lot of the world strangely mistakes Christian giving with giving for self-glorification. Giving by self-glorification is when you give because it makes you feel "good inside" and it's good to see "the smiles on people's faces."    Anyways, in the Hebrew Tanakh, throughout the Captivity of the Jews by the Babylonians, Assyrians, and etc., the Prophets spoke of giving to the poor and supporting the weak. One of the Five Pillars of Islam is to give alms. In some Muslim cultures, a great huge pot is set out in a place for people to donate their things. Giving in Buddhism and Hinduism is seen as good, because it shows you living a good life - and thus, possibly you can live a happier afterlife.    So, "giving" (although there are different ideas of giving among different religions) is a great central theme among religions. For Abrahamic religions, it can promote how we should be giving items for the sake of God. For religions of the Asian regions, giving can show the purity of a person's being.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	It is not a Christian theme.  Generosity is praised in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and most others.  Frankly, I can't think of one where it is NOT.    Why do you assume that Christianity has a monopoly on virtues?|`|AA11440210	it's pretty much a universal theme.  I n Buddhism, it's called karma, so you want to give good so that good will come back to you.  I think it's the same in Hinduism.  I was reading a book about Jewish values and they quote the Talmud and talk about giving not only money but blessings as well.  So it's most major religions.|`|ZDikOxXDaa	I think that theme has a lot more to do with age and maturity than with any religion.    You will have difficulty teaching a child at Christmas that it is more blessed to give than to receive.  While an adult has more joy from the giving of a gift.    I think the giving of a gift without anticipation of anything in return is not the actuality in all religions.  Many Christians put their offering in the basket as a requirement for salvation.  How do you let the basket pass by without putting something in while you have people on either side of you who will "notice".  I don't know how that works in other religions, it's just what I recall from my youth in a "Christian home".

I am very creative and artistic, that's a gift.    oh and I am good at managing money.    and sometimes, being kind to another person and dealing nicely with difficult people can be construed to be a gift as well.|`|e9bNJQ4Vaa	GIFT no a curse. i enjoy making people happy and laugh.

I've seen my friends act similarly, and I personally believe they're just trying to call attention to the fact that someone seemed interested in them.  Many girls are going to be suggestive and rude, pretending they didn't come to a bar to get attention when in fact that's the only reason they're dolled up and out.  Women just like to acknowledge that they've been acknowledged in a round-about way.  At least that's the way I see it.|`|p6XPhIxnaa	yea I think they were just stuck up and full of themsleves what abunch of bitches, at least you said excuse me!|`|J36FKvkHaa	When women are convinced they are the most attractive people in the room (and, generally, when they doll themselves up to go out to, say, a bar, then they will be so convinced), then they will assume that every guy who talks to them is hitting on them and will assume they have the right to be condescending.|`|J2gBU0NDaa	Not everything a woman, or anyone does is a personal attack on you.  When I was younger I was offended very easily, when someone was rude, or disrespectful.      Now I know in general most of the time its the other persons problem.   With the unemployment on the rise, 1/3 of women have been abused,  and lets not forget people have bad days at times could be the reason she was rude.   And maybe she was drunk and that was her way of flirting with you.      I am not saying I have not had a bad day before, and acted rudely to someone.  And I am not saying I was not tried badly and got upset  with that person , But I try to remember the times I had a bad day, and let others rudeness go most of the time.  In the long run I will benefit much more then the rude person will if I let it go, and not take it personally.  Just assume they had a bad day and make it your good deed of the day to forgive them.  If they continue to act rudely they will eventually meet someone who had a worse day then them, and will get the rudeness back.|`|be5JvtsVaa	i dont know,Ive never done that before..|`|LPKSUNv1aa	no,|`|pfkLEWRGaa	your gonna meet girls like that at a bar : /|`|uGbyYWixaa	noo!  she just sounds really desperate tbh.|`|LtwOF6Bdaa	either they were drunk, or didn't like you or something?|`|QHoJAPVUaa	Well did you say exuse me becuase they were in your way or becuase you wanted to talk to them.

MvZMA5BGaa	The Bible declares that it is appointed to man to die once and then face the judgement.  Jesus Christ is God incarnate. That is much, much different than reincarnation. Jesus Christ has always been in existence as He is God the Son.      The laws of karma and reincarnation are man made and wretched.  If you travel to a places in the world where people truly believe, you will find the true nature of it and how it holds people in it's grip.  Thanks to lack of education and with the help of men like Deepak Chopra,   Westerners have a very watered down idea of it.  Take for example a person that has caused much destruction - Hitler, for example, as his name always comes up. Karma and reincarnation teaches that upon his death, the bad karma he accumulated goes on into another life but the recipient has no idea of the weight they are carrying. Hitler's soul could be reincarnated into another person, animal or insect. There are some people that wear mouth and nose coverings to avoid breathing someone in. (I'm not joking.)  In countries where karma rules the day and homeless children roam the street, other citizens do nothing to help them. Not because they are cruel but because the child has accumulated bad karma and they believe the sooner the child dies he can begin again. I saw a news article a few years back about a heartbroken mother that had lost her 13 year son to an early death. Just after the funeral, an iguana walked into her home. The photo showed her with tears rolling down her face as she held it - because she was convinced it was her son reincarnated.   I stronly suggest the book by Ravi Zacharais called "Jesus Among Other Gods". He was raised in India and has a clear understanding of these things - and he takes strong offense to the tripe dished out by Deepak Chopra  |`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	No way.  You die once then comes the judgment.      Jesus was resurrected (not reincarnated) into a perfect body.  These are the same bodies Adam and Eve had when they were created.  They lost them when sin entered the world.  We all get them back at death.  At that point that perfect body (that can never die again) will either suffer in hell for an eternity or live in perfect harmony in heaven for an eternity.|`|AA10447614	There's a difference between Ascension (which involves Jesus' Glorious Body) and reincarnation. Reincarnation means living again, literally being in the flesh again. Jesus' Resurrection meant he was no longer in the mortal flesh but in the eternal flesh, so strictly speaking there was no reincarnation.|`|wUMDl0Gvaa	"everlasting transmigration"  Although my foundation is Jodo Shu (Pure Land) and not Jodo Shinshu (New Pure Land), I am a no-boundaries Buddhist. Therefore, I allow rebirths as a valid lesson to consider from Shakyamuni (sage of the Shakya clan). There is a bit of medical and scientific research supporting this thought. The Dolly Llama could have been reborn. Lowell Thomas thought so. That's not to say it is so. If we have all been here before then many, if not most, of us will be here again. Not necessarily in the 1880s or the 1500s, but TODAY - maybe. That is not to say we couldn't have been here in the 1880s or 1500s, I honestly do not know. I just think it is one possibility.    The whole past-life regression industry will almost always determine that you were great - a prince/princess or king/queen or knight/lady - and never scum like a pickpocket, a starving gutter slut or the inmate of a rat-infested asylum.    Likewise, in the sweat lodge experience, everyone wants to be an eagle or bear and not a mouse or fish. Ego.    Oh well, you decide. |`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	No reincarnation    jesus rose with his resurrected body that was transformed from flesh to eternal.    We die once physically and that is it our soul then goes to face judgment.|`|9390fcfcbe0f7ddb8fcc0e7c0bd0d6c8aa	According to the bible, I would say yes, there's a scriptural indication that so-called "resurrected" Jesus had a different body - his disciples didn't even recognize him when he appeared to them "post mortem." Jesus was an Essene rabbi as well as a supposed messiah, and he certainly would have taught reincarnation and karma (which of course he did, e.g. 'truly, literally, you must be born again.') Essenes were devout believers in reincarnation, which is an historical fact, and even the pope has admitted that Jesus was a practicing Essene: http://www.rosicrucian.org/publications/...|`|OIuiZv3maa	I do not.

What we are commanded to do is worship. To gain closeness to Allaah is only by his grace and mercy on us. We cannot dictate who Allaah will choose to be close to but we can strive to come close to him by doing whatever he has said that is a means of approach and closeness to him.     WE can delude ourselves into thinking we are close to Allaah when in fact, that is only a delusion and an illusion we have trapped ourselves in.    HAVING said that, we should all strive to realize Allaah as he ought to be realised, and fear him as he ought to be feared, and love him as he ought to be loved, and have hope in his mercy and reward as we ought to have hope in him.....    And to clear ourselves from any act of shirk, whether major or minor, and to strive to clear ourselves from all sins, whther major or minor, and be in constant remembrance of him and repentance...    Can't get close to God by committing shirk, can we ? Can't stay away from shirk if we do not understand it right ? And we can't understand it if we do not put in serious effort to study it ?    so that is one aspect of the knowledge of the Qur'aan.. arguably the single most important thing in our life and in gaining closeness to Allaah.    Allaah loves those deeds which he has made obligatory. Then those who desire further nearness to Allaah can strive for it in doing extra good deeds, eg, praying 'nafl' salaat, fasting more, etc... whatever has been legislated by Allaah and taught by the prophet who has sent by Allaah.    There is no secret or shortcut. Just using your intellgence in understanding the truth, and then submitting to God Alone, and then striving as much as you can for his pleasure and hoping to gain closeness to Him.    May Allaah have mercy on us and grant us closeness to him.
JnXmSLDfaa	I understand what you are asking and I think that he would not have been elected with a white wife nor with a black wife at his side.  People in the USA are very very prejudiced , probably everywhere they are, and it is  startling  to see couples of very different colors together, they just don't ''match'' and they stand out, no matter what anybody has to say about it.      The blacks would have voted for him, no matter what, nothing else mattered to the over  whelming majority of them, but the whites are a different matter and so are the other groups in the country.  I'm not so sure about the blacks either.  We have adopted several ***** children and they are outraged when a black professional or political or famous black man teams up with a white - usually it's a black man who marries a white woman.  Like Tiger Woods and his very blond wife, and back when it was Sammy Davis Jr and his white bond wife, and so on.  Even in school, some of the handsome boys were dating white girls and my daughter used to be furious with them.  She told me that she even asked the black boys, '''Can't you find a black girl beautiful and smart enough for you that you have to go to the whites ?''  There are so many nice, pretty black girls in our school, what are you doing ?  Saying that none of us are good enough for you ? ''  She got various responses but most just said they were dating the white girls because they could and wouldn't marry them when the time came.  But the white boys did not date the black girls.  The standard of beauty is not the same for the races either .      I'm not talking about exceptions here, but about the rule and major statistics.  I believe that Obama knew just what he was doing in choosing a wife close to his own color and having matching children also.  They look like a true family unit where ever they go and they don't offend anybody in doing so. I believe that Obama knew what he was doing and planned to go for the big time and was smart enough to know what would get him there so his wife is also of a similar background, highly educated and highly intelligent also.  They match, simply put.      Is anybody still kidding themselves, still ! ,  that it's not all about race ?  This last presidential election was not about politics or Obama would not have gotten elected.  The people who voted him in office have no idea what politics are or even know what our foreign policy is, or domestic policy either,  nor do they care.  All they cared about was that Obama's father was a black man from Kenya.      The best, and the worst, is yet to come for the usa. I, for one, hope for the best for all our sakes, and that Obama raises the aspirations of the blacks in  our country so that they educate themselves, use correct and respectful language, like he does, dress in an accepted way, like he does, and pull their pants up, like he does, go to the universities instead of the prisons, like he did, and marry and stay home as a husband and father, like he does, being respectful and loving to his family.  If the blacks in the usa follow Obama's lead and do as he has done, what a celebration for our whole country.  We would be so happy to stop the lawlessness, violence, porn, and filthy language now associated with every black ghetto in our country.      Back to your question, for all the above considerations, no, I don't believe that Obama would have been elected if he had a white wife nor a dark black wife.  No.|`|4Te5gVvDaa	Why must we indulge such inane conjecture. We can ask all the "what ifs" in the world and you still be denied any one definitive answer.

Mixed race couples stand out and not in a good way for most of the population.  To most of us, humans are all humans, but like needs to be with like or it looks weird.  Un-natural.     Animals are all animals, but do tigers mate with sheep ?  or Giraffes mate with zebra ?   No, they do not and should not.  They may be all animals but they have their own different species, just like we have our different races of humans.        The blacks came to the usa a mostly pure race from Africa but many of the children of the black women during slavery were fathered by the white owners and that accounts for the rainbow of shades of skin that we now have in this country.  It was all about race then and it's all about race now.  Everywhere in the world.      Most Japanese families mandate to their sons and daughters that they marry Japanese or be banished from the family totally.  And so it goes for most peoples.  They may not openly acknowledge this, but there it is.|`|srIv25b9aa	:newsfash:    his wife ISNT matching color to him!    shes 100% black.    he's biracial.|`|ca4ed140a6433f60bc05c2d63b2e498eaa	I hate what if questions.    His wife is darker than him already.    I honestly dont think it would matter though. I dont know of any president wining an election because of how the people felt about the wife.     Even Hillary lost the primaries when her husbands popularity was throught the roof.    Who you marry doesent affect if you will be voted into office.|`|HHRrlqhwaa	In all honesty I didn't hardly notice his wife except for the campaigns against others. She is a very outspoken woman. Race never played a factor, but it probably hurt his campaign for her to speak so much.

You may be wrong. The book you seek is called the lost books of the Bible. Each book is for sale if you have the money.|`|5081448bbeb27ad3f04aeb43905762e6aa	How do you know they aren't true?  The Gnostic's were some of the first followers of Christ and his teachings before Christianity really got big.  The church didn't want these books in the bible. The church doesn't want you to know a lot of things.  Do you know why priests are not allowed to me married?  Because in the old days you had to be a nobleman with money to be a priest or pope.  When the priests died they left their estates to their families, not the church.  Then the rules changed, that's the reason that they cannot be married now.    If you do your research, you'll find that Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute, and that Jesus wasn't the first child of  and Mary's.    I ask you all to do your research.  Which bible is the oldest, how come we have some many different versions of the christian bible?  Man is older than religion, find out what there was before organized religion.  Look up the true meaning of Paganism.  Read about the Christian Crusades.  Question the different interpretations of the bible.  Who wrote the bible?  Man did hmmmm....    I believe in a divine being, however I don't believe in organized religion.  If you read the different bibles, some say Jesus died on a cross, some say he died on a stake with his hands above his head, overlapping with a nail driven through them both ( one nail,two hands).  where does that leave the Father the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  People, don't just believe what you're told or what you read and take it for granted.  Did you know that when they restored the the original version of the Last Super that it had been painted over and when they took off the old layers of paint it was Mary Magdalene that sat to the right of Jesus.  Do your research.  I could go on and on but I won't.  I'm 53 years old and I've had organized religion shoved down my throat for years.  Then I started questioning older wiser people of the church, and they couldn't give me logical or reasonable answers, so I began to do the research on my own.  I have my own mind and so do you, so use it.  I am a very spiritual person, but not a religious person.  I don't mean to disrespect anyone's views on religion etc.  Think about this.  Do you know that some religions, and I won't mention which ones are the biggest money making and land owners in the world, and also have the biggest archives of paintings and antiques,writings that dispel their beliefs or what they want you to believe in their possession.    A mind is a beautiful thing to waste.      Love and Light to all of you.....   It's all very fascinating research.|`|0b5c129bd7ab21e274d85e4f78ec608baa	They are Gnostic Scriptures.  You can buy them at some bookstores, or check out university libraries.    In regard to the long answer above, these books were named after followers of Jesus, but I'm pretty sure they were written by other people long after their deaths.  In fact, I'm 99.9% sure.

It is also called Yom Truah (the Day of Blowing), Yom haShofar (Day of the Trumpet), etc.    As far as it being the "New Year", it is generally taught that this was the time of the creation of the world (or the creation of man, depending upon the sect of Judaism).  However, at the time of the Exodus it was commanded that the month of Passover would now be considered to be the first of the year.  And the Torah command of Yom Truah is that it be held on the first day of the 7th month.  So there are really 2 New Years days that occur on the Jewish calendar.|`|AA10744085	Well, we listen to a shofar blow...we eat apples (representing fruitfulness) dipped in honey, representing a sweet year.

90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Yes it is a prayer. Prayer is simply talking to God. There are different forms of prayer. In prayer of petition or intercessory prayer, we ask the Saints to pray WITH us and we can ask Mary to pray with us. Since she is Jesus' mother she has some special clout.     Also the Hail Mary is used in the Rosary as a simple form of meditation to put one in a state of mind necessary for peace and meditative reflection on the life of Jesus.    My favorite is the Angelus which is said in the morning. It has 3 Hail Mary's in it along with other phrases that remind us of the Incarnation of Jesus. It is very beautiful and when done at the monastery we kneel and the bells are rung. It is done at dawn. We rejoice in the Word made flesh, and show respect to the woman who agreed to be his human mother.    I am a High Church Anglican.|`|AA11581131	"when i read it, it sounds to me like it is a prayer." - Yes - it is a prayer, a request for Mary - the Mother of Jesus (GOD) to ask GOD to bless us by answering our request. Very same mentality as a request to a human king. As Kings were something people are familiar with, but no so much anymore in 2006. Jesus is the King so people pray accordingly. Mary is the mother of the King.  I don't know from Kings or how to talk to them, so that's all I know. Americans have no daily training on dealing with royalty. We are in for a shock when in the presence of them. Royals are not millionaires or "celebrities" that we are used to.  The second part of your question: "I've always believed that even after we go to heaven we will still be worshiping in heaven. and a part of worshiping God is prayer" - this also correct - we will worship GOD in heaven, and do as instructed, rotate down to be guardian angels, or whatever else GOD needs.|`|8dc838a9e2fb8480656d2a076f4f3137aa	It is a prayer, that requests that Mary "intervene" with God on the behalf of the person that recites a Hail Mary/ rosary.

(Lk. 1:28)  Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. (Lk. 1:42)  Pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, Amen.  Here we ask Mary to intercede for us.   Protestants have a hard time with this, but then they turn around and ask their friend to pray for them.   We are asking Mary, who is much closer to God than just an average person, to pray for us. Don't you think he'll listen to her even more than he will listen to your friend?  I have no idea why Protestants have a problem with this prayer!|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	Sams said it best - the first part if from Luke and teh rest the Catholic church added to conclude the prayer.  God chose Mary to raise His Son - what a wonderful gift of giving back to God then by loving Her -- after all -- she was the bearer of the greatest Gift we could ever receive -showing her respect and love is agreeing with God saying -- right on, you did the right thing  :)|`|44c61ebbdf1b1abb39472ef3706acb43aa	well, people love a HOOK UP....and Jesus' mother is a good hook up for us sinners...|`|9ff60ac9f9d64bf7201944b6105d0b55aa	Its a football term, and a prayer term.|`|AA11485673	The angel Gabriel did appear to Mary and told her that she was to be the earth mother of a child of promise.

Welche Folgerung daraus zu ziehen ist, geht aus den Versen 36 und 37 hervor.  Die Stra?e von Jerusalem nach Jericho fhrte durch eine wilde, einsame Gegend, die oft der Schauplatz von Raubberf?llen war, weshalb dort schlie?lich zum Schutz der Reisenden eine Garnison stationiert wurde. Jericho lag ungef?hr 23 km on?. von Jerusalem. Um zu zeigen, wer der ?N?chste war, der nach dem Gesetz geliebt werden sollte, sprach Jesus von der Reaktion eines Priesters und eines Leviten gegenber einem Mann, der ausgeraubt und halb tot liegengelassen worden war. Die Priester waren beauftragt, im Tempel in Jerusalem Opfer darzubringen, und die Leviten halfen ihnen dabei. Die Samariter erkannten das im Pentateuch niedergelegte mosaische Gesetz an, aber die Juden waren ihnen gegenber nicht freundlich gesinnt, ja sie verkehrten berhaupt nicht mit ihnen (Joh 4:9). Sie blickten ver?chtlich auf die Samariter herab (Joh 8:48); es gab sogar Juden, die die Samariter ?ffentlich in ihrer Synagoge verfluchten und t?glich darum beteten, da? ihnen kein ewiges Leben zuteil werde. Dem Verletzten wurden ?l und Wein  damals h?ufig verwendete Heilmittel  auf die Wunden gegossen. Die zwei Denare, die der Samariter dem Herbergswirt gab, damit dieser fr den Mann sorge, entsprachen ungef?hr zwei Tagel?hnen (Mat 20:2).|`|f2c595f687c7e1b0065368a18ecc1fa4aa	Jesus meinte damit den Verwundeten.

Wir denken nur an uns und fr die Hilfe einem anderen ist oft der Aufwand zu gro?. Nun findet sich in dieser Parabel doch einer, der Samariter, der an dem Hilfebedrftigen die N?chstenliebe erweist.     Der Gesetzeslehrer, der sich mit der Frage ausredet, will ja nur den Kreis seiner zu liebenden N?chsten einschr?nken. Er meint vielleicht, dass er nur seine Familie, Freunde, nur die Menschen, die zu ihm gut sind, lieben soll. Die Bibel sagt aber auf einer anderen Stelle, dass unsere Liebe mehr als solche sein soll.     Mit dem Vers 36 haben viele Verst?ndnisprobleme. (Du hast ihn au?erdem falsch zitiert, es hei?t sinngem?? so: Wer von diesen dreien hat sich als N?chster AN dem berfallenen erwiesen.) Die oft gestellte Frage ist:   Soll der N?chste nun lieben oder geliebt werden?     Unter N?chstenliebe verstehen wir: den N?chsten lieben.   Man kann es aber auch so verstehen: als der N?chste lieben.     Der Samariter hat den berfallenen ja so behandelt, als ob er sein Freund oder Verwandter w?re, in der Wirklichkeit war er aber einer aus dem Volk, mit dem die Samariter l?ngst Feinde waren. Das ist die N?chstenliebe!     Jesus fragte: Wer hat als N?chster gehandelt? Der Gesetzeslehrer fragte aber vorhin: Wer ist mein N?chster? Hiermit lenkt Jesus die Aufmerksamkeit dahin, dass man selbst ein N?chster sein soll... Fr wen? Fr alle. Es gibt genug Menschen, denen wir helfen k?nnen usw.     Die Menschen wollen da oft eine Grenze setzen: die N?chsten seinen nur die, die ich kenne, die es von mir auch erwarten, die mich auch lieben... Genauso, wie der Gesetzeslehrer. Kannte der Samariter den berfallenen? Nein. Jesus setzt da keine Grenze. Er wrde auch niemals sagen: Diesem Menschen sollst du die N?chstenliebe erweisen, und dieser ist nicht dein N?chster. Wir sollen ja auch unsere Feinde lieben, wer kann denn dann noch ausgeschlossen sein?     Also, wenn man die Frage des Gesetzeslehrers beantwortet, so ist der berfallene der N?chste. Die Antwort auf die Frage von Jesus ist: der Samariter, der sich als der liebende N?chste erwiesen hat.

Guilt - you're going against their wishes    What do you do:    You're living with your parents so I'm guessing that you're not that old... regardless of age though, stop seeking a relationship online and get back into reality... It's easy to talk to some "nice guy" online and think you want to meet him etc.. but you don't have any clue who they are. :S|`|30c9752c6e0e5ebbf629a6751abdbb20aa	You should trust that your parents know what they are talking about.

Now go do your homework!|`|36a2ca2cda49f2a176568dfd146486e5aa	Well, you feel bad because you broke a promise to people close to you. In my opinion, talking to strangers online isn't that bad, unless anything creepy or illegal happens, or they make you feel uncomfortable. Don't tell them any personal information such as address, phone number, where you attend school. And don't meet them in person unless someone is with you, in a very public area. Your parents are just worried that something bad could happen, but that's not always the case!|`|4cbec051ea118ad3edf24ab93ff6ac87aa	Talking to others, there is no problem.

Many people act like their true selves, while others may be pedophiles just looking to find young kids as naive and trusting as you. Listen to your mommy and daddy when they tell you not to talk to strangers.

Even if you were 200% unattractive - who cares?  Go out, love life, be who you are - no one wants to be around a gorgeous bimbo that spends 2 hours a day on her looks, and such people are never happy anyway.

ad74e7491b536479d345332ea8fcc00daa	I wouldn't worry about it.  To dream about your own death may be due to you experiencing a transition in life.  Are you becoming more spiritual?  Have you formed new beliefs on something?      P.S. You have some wild dreams!  You should write them down. :)|`|if0c4KsLaa	It kinda sounds like to me that you feel trapped and that you are trying to get away from something that might seem to good to be true, the whole dieing thing is really creepy but what you have to think about is who that globular figure represents in your life that you have in the past been close to, that has the capability to hurt you, and mostly that you wouldn't be surprised if they did something like that... you would almost expect it, if there is no one like that in your life then i would say don't worry about it i had a freaky dream that was like a prophecy once when i was young and almost all of it came true except that last event which was the only tragic one in the dream, so like i said if you don't have a person in your life that you think that figure could represent then i wouldn't worry about it, and if you do have somebody in your life like that then its probably still not a big deal but just keep on the look out just in case you can never be too careful |`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	2 escapes:  1/ hang around the other 4 heros, they'll take care of you  2/ don't give up on the math puzzle. post it here if you need help to get past it and the monster|`|YlnWT9oMaa	I don't think you should worry about it, it's just a dream, maybe a meaning of something else rather than you dieing.

God is interested in your life, who you marry, where you work, so study  the Bible to get to know God and ask Him to help you live and have all that you need. God Bless|`|1251439840536e74f6d7b721cab71471aa	Reading the Bible will draw you nearer to God's heart and His will. You will get to know Him better. Prayer will also help in this area.

Reading the bible on a regular basis is a great way to enhance your spiritual life. And once that becomes stronger, everything else will fall into place. That DOES NOT mean that life will be easy or you will always have lots of friends. But it does mean that the things that matter will become a bit clearer to you. If that happens, i think your priorities will be straightened out.     About saying something "of revelance or charismatic", the Bible says that if you begin to share the Gospel, the Holy Spirit will speak thru you.|`|AA11456696	It seems like you want bible knowledge for the wrong reasons, therefore it may not be granted. With bible knowledge, as in "true" bible knowledge, many worries and concerns melt away. A study proved that people who attend religious services regularly live 20% longer than the rest. Also, you avoid bad situations more frequently, and you react differently to outside influences which may save your life someday. I'm tough but I don't feel as though I have to show it (for example).    The greatest reward for me is having the ability to show my appreciation to Jehovah for the life I have, the food I eat, the home I own, and the health of my brain and limbs. Just as I feel good when I show my mother appreciation for her love that she freely gave to me even when I didn't deserve it. The bible teaches me how to show appreciation to God, my family, and my neighbor. It teaches me that my hope does not lay in the hands of presidents and kings. My hope is in the greatest hands of all, Jehovah's.|`|ce394cc3237a1b9e9ba8b97e22c195dfaa	Well, it's a book.

Your world view and how you view and value your own life is changed as you learn to see yourself and others the way God sees you and those around you.      One of the results of the daily disciplines of reading the bible, having an active and consistent prayer life and regularly giving praise and thanksgiving to God is that His light of life and love is clearly seen by others in you and they will be drawn to you.  It is in working at and building your one on one personal relationship with God by doing the above that brings about this kind of result.  It is important to remember that God will not be mocked and knows our heart.  It is when we reflect, represent and honor God with our thought life and our actions that we are able to live life abundantly.|`|e1144a79023f8b92f841de8ed5398a26aa	The bible can help you in lots of ways mainly spiritually .|`|11cc1a0523673265afb0e1a2a24b9defaa	Pray to God, get on a rountine of praying every day, thanking God for everything he's given to you, then ask HIM for help, ask him to guide you to HIS will.  Read your Bible daily too, even if it is just a verse.    What you may think help is may not be what God thinks help is.  So don't expect something to come quickly.  It may take a while, It's in God's time!|`|e9eb72c87296f9c21e1d9d76f60d023faa	I started reading the Bible about 2 years ago, and I didn't think I was soaking much in, but now I can hold a conversation and understand all the jokes and what not.

Reading the Bible will not give you automatically relevant knowledge or make you charismatic in your personallity.  Being a Christian means that you are forgiven of your sins, and that you have certain promises from God.   For instance, you have this promise from Jesus:  John 14:3   "If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also."  and  John 14:28   "You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I."

8cc37859e920febbe17e6f0d0364bbf7aa	Western society has reduced the breast to an impliment of sexual desire.  Though the deep-rooted attraction to them springs from the perception that any offspring sired with a female with large breasts will be well fed, and thus more likely to survive.

He would fulfill all the prophecy in the scriptures to prove He was who He said He was. In order to do this He had to be becomes a prophet, priest and king. He was baptized for the following reasons:  1.To be identified with believing Israel. Luke 3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, Luke 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. Luke 3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, Luke 7:29 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. Luke 7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.  2.To be manifest to Israel: John 1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. John 1:31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  3.To submit himself to fulfill all righteousness: Matthew 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.  4.To be Prophet, Priest, and King: To hold these office He had to be washed and anointed: (1) Prophet: Luke 7:16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. (2) Priest after the order of Melchisedec: Exodus 40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. Hebrews 6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. (3) Made a King to fulfill the scriptures: Isaiah 32:1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.  5.To be ordained to preach the gospel: Luke 4: 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are burdened.     In the age of grace, where there is only one baptism, we are not baptized because Jesus was baptized. The Holy Spirit baptizes us into His body. Ephesians 4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 1 Corinthians 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, We are baptized into His death when the Holy Spirit baptizes us into His body. Romans 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?|`|2c53ebcb41047be67a1df892969e5128aa	Symbolism, dude.|`|5c2429961f182571e20217736632b861aa	Matthew 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.

As long as you're not worshiping Jehovah, you're making him happy. Jesus said, The Father is greater than I. He was baptized because He came down to be a sacrifice for mankind's sins. By being baptized, He showed what we shoud do-devote our life to serving his father, Jehovah God.

They were very rude and made it quiet clear that they were not happy that "another white woman was taking another black man away from them".     Some white men consider a white woman as "damaged goods" if she is "with" a black man.    I say if you can ignore the idiots, racist, and hypocrites in this world then go for it.     P. S.

Niemand kann diese Frage ernsthaft beantworten.  Aber jeder hat so viele Jahre Zeit um sein Leben zu fhren und sich auch eine Lebenshaltung zu erarbeiten, mit der er dann zufrieden auf das gelebte Leben zurckblicken kann.   Dann, am Ende des Lebensweges,  wird es egal, was danach kommt, denn wer sein Leben gelebt hat, der kann es dann auch loslassen, wenns ans sterben geht.|`|cea6d5298a87e8cf4877fbd94de55a43aa	Das ist denke ich gleich wie enn Du bewustlos bist, Du weist einfach nichts mehr.|`|79f10a48c22bb368891905eacf27075aaa	Nach dem Tod sind wir im Himmel ode in der H?lle, das ist deine Entscheidung.

110fac4bc67ff5172a65fb72a8be24dfaa	yes. theres the bonus (down below). do atheists knwo what bigotry is? i'm sure hitler loved other religions in his country (insert sarcasm here). tolerance and acceptance are not the same thing.    A bigot is a prejudiced person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own.    The origin of the word bigot in English dates back to at least 1598, via Middle French, and started with the sense of "religious hypocrite", especially a woman. Bigot is often used as a pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to their prejudices even when these views are challenged or proven to be false.    Forms of bigotry may have a related ideology or world views.    Contents [hide]  1 Etymology   2 See also   3 References   4 External links          [edit] Etymology  The exact origin of the word is unknown, but may have come from the German bei and gott, or the English by God. William Camden wrote that the Normans were first called bigots, when their Duke Rollo, who receiving Gisla, daughter of King Charles, in marriage, and with her the investiture of the dukedom, refused to kiss the king's foot in token of subjection, unless the king would hold it out for that purpose. And being urged to it by those present, Rollo answered hastily, "No by God", whereupon the King turning about, called him bigot; which name passed from him to his people [1]. This is likely fictional, however, as Gisla is unknown in Frankish sources. It is true that the French used the term bigot as an abuse for the Normans.[2]    The 12th century Anglo-Norman author Wace claimed that bigot was an insult that the French used against the Normans, but it is unclear whether it entered the English language via this route.[3]    According to Egon Friedell, "bigot" is of the same root as "visigoth". In Vulgar Latin the initial v transformed into b (phenomenon today encountered in Iberian languages, such as Spanish language and Portuguese language; visi had truncated into bi in Vulgar Latin (phenomenon common in French and Portuguese). Certainly the Visigoths did behave in a manner which might have given birth to the expression; after they established a highly tolerant citizenship open to any religion, either Arian, Catholic, Jew or pagan, they converted from Arianism to Catholicism and adopted harsh restrictions against all others religions, even their own Arianism. This conversion to Catholicism was the occasion for Wisigothic rulers to become real "Spanish" as their roman compatriots, but they went into a serial of measures against pagans, pricilianists, heretics and Jews. The Spanish word bigote means moustache, probably because Visigoths had moustaches. Since both Normans and Goths were Germanic peoples, the Franks as a Romance nation might well have referred the Normans as "Visigoths" with the expression bigot. This claim is also supported by the fact that the word bigoth for Visigoths appear in Medieval Latin language|`|AA10953883	Yes, they know what it is.  In fact, a lot of them practice it on a daily basis.  "Bigotry" originated in Flimflam Flats, Alabama.  It was first coined by a guy named Bubba Ray who hated anyone who wasn't exactly just like he was.  He'd chase his victim around with a 12 gauge shotgun and he'd holler "If you don't find yo'self a big ol tree, I'm gonna shoot you dead!"      Over the years, "big ol tree" became "bigotry".

What's so wrong w/ people having their own religion...i hope you realize that your question merely expresses your own bigoted beliefs.|`|AA12003094	Bigot/ry - A person who is rigidly devoted to his own group, religion race or politics and is intolerant of those who differ. bigotry - The attitude, state of mind or behavior characteristics of a bigot; intolerance.    To answer your question on bigotry, what you see as intolerance by a few or by a lot of individuals is based on exclusiveness and how they view their group as exclusive and inclusive and chosen by whatever means that gets you into that group. It does not matter which group you belong to, there is a level of so called intolerance in all of them. The reasons for this abounds ad absurdum, however it borders in one root - sin. Man whether you wish to believe in it or not, is born with sin and a sinful nature wich is the cause of his sinning. Man can not have just sin in their lives without something that is the root of sin i.e. the sinful nature. This nature is the cause of all bigotry, intolerance and exclusiveness and segregation that you want to blame on religions and your number one problem with the Christians as they are in "your eyes intolerant" of others.     It seems that the world is trying to push this word down the throats of everyone. You have to tolerate everythng and if you don't allow for toleration then you are just wrong. Well that in and of itself is an "intolerant" viewpoint. That view point says that if you do not agree with my position or the position of the majority, minority, the popular or unpopular position you are labeled as "intolerant"! A bigot, racist, hate monger. All the while they slander your view point and make derogatory remarks about you telling all that you are "intolerant". Thus while they in the same breath demand tolerance of all are being intolerant of others.     This "tolerant" "respecting all viewpoints" is a smokescreen approach, a bandaide on a hemorrage,  an aspirin for a cancer that is spreading the whole world over. When it comes full circle what will come of it is not "tolerance and well meaning" it will be an ideology that says, "you will do what they say you will do or you will die for it! It has happened before - be prepared - it is going to happen again -                                    I GUARNATEE IT!     Hey but don't listen to me - just open your eyes! See it for yourself - if you are truly wise and discerning as you think and believe that you truly are!!!!!!!!!!!    I believe in Jesus Christ, the LORD God Almighty and am filled with the Spirit of the Living God, I do not promote bigotry and can not stand bigotry, if you knew me which you don't you would find that out very quickly. The Word of God says that unless you believe and follow Christ you cannot be saved, you will die in your sins, and you will go to Hell, this to some would say that this "intolerance" of other religions and viewpoints. It would be if for one very dynamic reason - He is God, YHWH - His will is Supreme and His way is Perfect - argue with Him when you see Him if you charge Him with intolerance - but also remember - He sent His Only Begotten Son to die in your place for your sins and your sinful nature and your intolerance and your hatred - remember He is God and He will always have the last Word - For He is the First and the Last!|`|e82aeea5867c69b5cf6e08d0cc961f6faa	sho' do! fun stuff!!|`|sFpqug2laa	dress it up any way you want to bud, the truth is that JESUS is LORD and HE is the ONLY way to heaven.

But if you ask with "If You want me to move to Alabama and worship You in a Southern freak-show snake-tossing congregation, then that's what I'll do" determination, you'll definitely get an answer.

I personally rowed the boat that he stood in and looked ahead as we approached the shore.  When we hit the banks, he said, "Hey I think we're in India."  I said, "No, I think this is Cuba, lets go see if we can find some cigars, man, or maybe we can find some good grass here."  He slapped me on the back of the head, and told me to put my hat on straight and pull up my pantaloons, and he reminded me that cigars hadn't been invented yet.

If you are not attracted to guys, then you are not gay. Its that simple. a LOT of people tend to develop little crushes on the same sex sometime in their life. It's normal, and it doesn't mean you want to have sex with them.  If you do want to have sex with them, then maybe you're gay.    As for not liking two girls you dated. BIG DEAL! You'll date lots of people you'll end up not liking. its part of dating.

Does Imacculate Conception have anything to do with "VIRGIN BIRTH"?    Google Imacculate Conception and learn that is NOT.     What else do you falsely believe?    Jesus, the basis of Christianity? .    If Jesus died, he could NOT have been God.    Can Gods die?    If Jesus 'died' on Friday and 'undied' on Sunday, what else besides Saturday was sacrificed?     Did Jesus give up Saturday for us?     No Eternal sacrifice, big deal for a day!    If Jesus died for our sins, there should not be any more sins, else why go through with it?.    If Jesus really DIED, he should be dead, dead, dead!     Life after death is like virginity after childbirth.    If the flesh of Jesus died, what was seen walking and talking on Sunday?     If you believe this stuff, you are not going to like the folks who don't. You want them to believe it too to validate you.

That church was and is currently the Catholic church.  In the bible they said that there should be NO DIVISION WITHIN THE CHURCH.  That is what Martin Luther did.  Martin luther also took out books of the bible and in revelations it was said that you should NOT ADD NOR TAKE AWAY FROM the books of the bible.  If you were really a christian then how can you say the catholic church is wrong when Jesus told someone to start a church and your not gonna be apart of it.  Your not gonna be a part of it because of what happened in the middle ages.  Or you THINK(because we don't) we worship dead people, mary, and angels.  Go to a catholic church and talk to REAL CATHOLICS.  Not what you read on the net.  and of lutherans and muslims (gal1:6-9)  let no man talk to you about a different religion or teaching.  For if he does then he is condemmed.  For even if it was AN ANGEL IN HEAVEN to tell you different then he is condemmed too.  I think that sums it up.

AA10411531	Yes it's good to be an organ donor. All things must be done wisdom and order as King Benjamin teaches in the book of Mosiah. Read the October New Era or Ensign, there's an article about a girl, whose life was saved because of donated lungs. a man from her ward gave some of his lungs to her after much praying, fasting and having a consent from his wife. You can read the Ensign, new Era or other church publications from www.lds.org  I know they are inspired and answers our prayers    By the way, I'm glad to hear that you know the church is true and I admire your desire and courage to join God's church. You're still young and your mother is your guardian at the moment. She can tell you where to go to church etc for now, but your immortal spirit is free to believe in your Heavenly Father, who created you and you have the right to join His kingdom. Just keep reading the scriptures, praying for your mother that her heart might be softened soon enough. You are very brave and faithful, Keep up the good work. I'm not sure if I could do the same thing when I was 14. I'm the only member in my family as well. but I'm 22 haha, joined the church when I was 18. My family tested my conviction first then now they support me because they can see it's not something bad. hopefully they won't be that opposed when I tell them I wanna go on a mission ;-p I'll pray for you Megan.|`|AA10637643	I am LDS - we view it as a personal choice.

I think people are too paranoid.     That said, you probably could eat off that floor. Since floors are dry, germs don't really flourish on them all that well. I have read the statistic that most people would be better off licking the sidewalk than using the silverware from their own house- and I believe it. Most of us aren't as careful as we think that we are.    Bottom line- don't worry about it. We're a hardy species. (Although i'd point out to her that while it might be SAFE to eat off the floor- it certainly isn't very polite!)

Fr mich ist das nix Besonderes. Ich kann mich noch sehr gut und mit G?nsehautfeeling an den 9. November 89 erinnern, wie ich heulend vor dem Fernseher sa?, weil mir das so naheging- diese unglaubliche Freude und unglaubliche Nachricht, dass tats?chlich die Mauer gefallen war (bzw. noch nicht, aber so gut wie). DAS w?re h?chstens noch ein Tag zum Feiern gewesen, wenn man sich dann immer wieder an dieses Gefhl und die Fernsehbilder erinnert h?tte. Aber so? Mmmmm. Ich glaube, es muss noch eine Menge Zeit vergehen, bis das fr uns Deutsche so was wie ein "National" feiertag wird. Vielleicht erst in der n?chsten oder bern?chsten Generation. Fr mich (ich bin fast 39) ist da einfach noch zuviel im Unklaren mit der ganzen Wiedervereinigung und mit der Situation, wie sie heute ist. Da ist noch soviel im Argen, und es braucht noch soviel Geduld, bis wir wirklich in West und Ost ein Volk sind... da muss noch eine Menge wachsen.

November war eigentlich der Tag, an dem die Grenzen  fielen, war und ist in Deutschland jedoch negativ besetzt.  An diesem Tag haben die Nazis die Synagogen in Brand gesetzt  und viele Menschen umgebracht. Deswegen ist dieses Datum  meiner Meinung nach ungeeignet fr diesen ja erfreulichen   Anla?. Der 3.

a8a5f519f06319ffc35e3558b06e11daaa	Un enseignement n'est pas transcendal.     Mais, il peut diriger l'tre vers la transcendance de son tre (comme la mditation, certaines formes de prires ou les koans zen)    Il faut distinguer cela des croyances qui permettent de dclarer , dieu est immanent, dieu est transcendant.     En gnral, dans l'orthodoxie des religions du Livre, la divinit est considre comme transcendante mais non comme immanente, luxe qui fut arrache aux cultes fminin avec l'apparition de l'agriculture, mais qui font aujourd'hui un retour en force. (comme les wiccans par exemple)    Il ne faut cependant pas oublier que chaque religion a eu des dbats vifs et des vues trs diffrentes sur ce sujet.     Ainsi , la Bagdavad G?ta (quel gemme ! ) dcrit le divin comme transcendant et immanent, mais c'est aussi le cas pour la cabale juive, le no platonisme et sa thorie d'manations, le soufisme en islam, les traditions contemplatives chrtiennes,ou encore l'hermtisme.    Encore une fois, tout dpend de l'angle par lequel on aborde la question. Il y a grand danger de dclarer : SEULS LES... qui denonte qu'un angle de vision est omis, ou tout simplement ignore.

It is called 'The Buddhist Bible'; it is given an important place in the Buddhist home, and is even treated with veneration. In most houses where there is a small shrine, this book is kept there so that they may refer to it during their devotional hour. Some have committed to memory the three well known discourses - Mangala, Ratana and Karaniya-metta suttas. Even children are familiar with these discourses; for they learn them from their parents and elders or from the 'dhamma school'.    Now what does this book contain? It is a collection of twenty four suttas or discourses almost all delivered by the Buddha, and found scattered in the five original collections (nikayas) in Pali, which form the Sutta Pitaka, the 'Canonical Discourses'. These discourses are preceded by an enunciation of the Three Refuges; the Ten Precepts and the questions asked of a novice|`|AA12073355	Mike and Steve?|`|0SMmj1uLaa	Sorry, never heard of it, which surprises me because I've read a lot of sutras, provide some info please?

Era un nome di moneta conosciuto gi all'epoca di Shakespeare, citato, ad esempio, nel Macbeth.    Il nome  connesso con quello di un'altra valuta antica, il tallero (tolar in Boemia, thaler in Germania e daler in Svezia). Secondo alcuni linguisti, il nome tallero proverrebbe dal tedesco thal "valle". Si tratterebbe di una denominazione del Guldengroschen (grande fiorino, in argento ma con valore pari al fiorino d'oro), una moneta che veniva coniata con l'argento proveniente da una ricca miniera sita nella Valle di San Gioacchino (St. Joachims-thal) in Boemia (ora nella Repubblica Ceca). Sembra per improbabile che una parola tedesca con un suono iniziale [t] abbia dato come esito [d] in altre lingue germaniche, mentre  pi probabile un passaggio inverso, di una parola germanica con [d] originario, in seguito alla seconda rotazione consonantica del tedesco.|`|gYdsCvtaaa	E' stata un'idea di Paperon de' Paperoni...|`|Wpb6fnE6aa	http://www.biblit.it/paroliere_dollaro.h...|`|b357449fde02f3669eca623866223a7faa	perch chi ha pensato al simbolo del dollaro aveva un po' pi di fantasia|`|j4YovRBhaa	forse per la esse finale nel plurale, dollars.... ma non saprei, i centesimi di dollaro sono con la c barrata, come da noi.....

t8WHxnCjaa	Antes que nada, por lo que he leido quiero hacer una aclaracin, quienes habitan dentro de la tierra se llaman INTRATERRESTRES, pese a que su origen es EXTRATERRESTRE.    Las bases o ciudades intraterrenales se encuentran por todo el planeta.-    Las ms conocidas son:  a) en Latinoamrica: en Per, donde est Machupichu; en Argentina en la zona de Crdoba y en Uruguay en el departamento de Salto;  b) en Norteamrica: en la zona del ca?n del Colorado.  c) en el Tibet (Shambala);  d) en Egipto.    Algn autor tambin habla de la existencia de otra en Roma.-    Las que ms conozco por haber leido sobre ellas son las de Latinoamrica. El autor que ha escrito muy bien sobre el tema y tiene un libro para cada ciudad intraterrena latinoamericana, donde te explica que la misin de cada una es diferente es: Trigueirinho (es autor brasilero pero sus libros estn traducidos al espa?ol).

LgEFYjFuaa	That's easy. If there were no haters, then people wouldn't get things accomplished. And this being Black History Month, here's a good example: White people couldn't stand us back in the day or last century, and some still can't now. They wouldn't let us play sports, they told us we couldn't drink from their fountains, they told us we were stupid, we weren't capable of donig anything. Look at us now. We've accomplished more than they ever gave us credit for. We basically dominate they top pro sports, and some of the blower ranked sports too. We are millionaires, doctors, lawyers, judges, and so many others. my point is, we need haters. If we didn't have people telling us we can't and we aren't, we wouldn't advance as much.

b71afd7d6d91826d852cf03908df8357aa	Oi querida!.   um pensamento t?o anacr?nico que parece piada, e de mau gosto.  Passou na record a inaugura??o de uma igreja universal do reino de Deus na frica, onde no prprio culto, as obreiras distribuiam camisinhas aos fiis. Isso uma semana antes da vinda do papa. Claro, uma inteligente estratgia e provoca??o.  Acho legal do catolicismo a radicaliza??o contra o aborto, a sim, mas dizer que se deve fazer sexo s depois do casamento,  mostrar que n?o disp?e de dados estatsticos atualizados desde a idade mdia.Tenho filhas, e se me aparecer no futuro, um pretendente  adulto e virgem eu desaconselho o namoro, pois ele teria algum problema psquico.  O celibato  outra coisa que desqualifica e distancia o papa e a prpria igreja de poder opinar em assuntos de famlia.   O homossexualismo e pedofilia na igreja, s?o outros entraves  moral que eles proconizam.  Ou catolicismo muda e muito, ou estar condenado  extin??o ou se pulverizar em muitos catolicismos regionalizados e com diretrizes distintas.  Bjs e bom final de semana.|`|b2bc89065be62569fc72c38aada2273baa	Ol Gypsy!    Quero, antes de tudo, deixar bem claro que a minha resposta n?o  dirigida aos nossos querido irm?os catlicos e nem  Igreja Catlica.   preciso que as pessoas saibam exatamente o que se passa no nosso planeta. Fiquei surpreso com as declara??es do Papa, que resumidamente quer diminuir o tamanho da Institui??o, pretendendo com isto ficar com os "verdadeiros" catlicos. N?o se deu conta que a cada dia a Igreja Catlica perde os seus fiis para os evanglicos e principalmente para os espritas. Alguns meses atrs a revista poca divulgou que o Espiritismo possuia aproximadamente 30 milh?es de seguidores, dos quais a grande maioria vem da Igreja Catlica. Ou seja, 25 milh?es!  um nmero para fazer a Institui??o pensar sriamente, j que o Brasil  o pas que possui o maior nmero de catlicos do mundo.  Do que adianta as clausuras se os conceitos n?o se renovam? Acontece o que voc disse: Os jovens catlicos s?o iguais a qualquer jovem de qualquer religi?o, e ficam expostos  AIDS e outra coisas.  N?o estamos falando de libertinagem e sim do desejo natural que existe entre os namorados que j est?o juntos h algum tempo.  Em respeito  Institui??o que nos deu verdadeiros exemplos como S. Francisco de Assis, Santo Agostinho, Madre Tereza de Calcut (que simplesmente ignorava as ordens de n?o interferir com os hindus) deu um exemplo avassalador de amor ao prximo e tantos outros  que penso que:Ou a Institui??o muda, acaba ou perde a importancia.    Fique com Deus!!|`|4cd37511a307eec6ae46566ad5b9f1d2aa	A Igreja  terminantemente contra o sexo fora do casamento, tendo em vista que um dos mandamento : N?o pecar contra a castidade esse mandamento tem o mesmo peso, para a Igreja, que aquele que diz: N?o matar! Pois quando os mandamentos foram feitos ningum disse: Olha esse  mais importante que aquele. Todos s?o iguais.  O uso da camisinha s se justifica pelo sexo antes do casamento, ent?o  lgico que dentro das normas da Igreja ela vai ser contra.   Ser a favor  o mesmo que apoiar o sexo fora do casamento. Seria como apoiar o ato de se matar algum se um dia matar virar algo natural.  N?o estou com isso dizendo minha opini?o s estou dizendo o porque da Igreja tomar essa posi??o.  Que bom te ver de novo! Beijos!|`|c7Rj1Rs7aa	A nossa Igreja t atrasada porque tem lderes atrasados. Alis at mesmo Galileu Galilei quase foi queimado na fogueira p causa de idias at mesmo loucas de alguns que entravam pra nossa igreja e n?o tinham a menor voca??o espiritual. Em particular, falta elei??o para papa - com participa??o de 50% dos fiis e contados os restantes 50% dos clricos. Eles ainda vivem c idias antigas e que n?o d?o certo na prtica - Deus me perdoe, mas essas idias s?o ultrapassadas. Sexo  bom e todo mundo gosta e tem q ter camisinha mesmo. Amados catlicos, n?o fa?am sem camisinha. Deus inventou o amor e a inteligncia p us-la - as doen?as s?o consequncias de ausncia de cuidados. Vamos nos cuidar. AIGREJA TEM QUE CUIDAR DA PARTE ESPIRITUAL - A PARTE BIOLGICA DEUS CRIOU A MEDICINA E CINCIAS BIOLGICAS PARA NOS ORIENTAR - N?O VAMOS TROCAR AS COISAS.

O uso da camisinha, de acordo com a igreja Catlica, serve como estmulo  rela??es sexuais ilcitas. Esse tipo de rela??o  um dos fatores mais relevantes na propaga??o da aids e de outras doen?as venreas, bem como, a principal causa da gravidez indesejada e o grande nmero de abortos clandestinos. O Papa, me parece, chegou at mesmo, pedir ao Presidente, que fosse suspensa a distribui??o de camisinhas pelo Estado. O pedido,tambm me parece, foi regeitado pelo Pres. Lula, sob alega??o de tratar-se de um problema de sade pblica. A condi??o  a mesma para a quest?o do aborto induzdo.   Diante dos dois argumentos, dira o velho Vicente Mateus: "A camisinha,  uma faca de dois legumes", que vai ser enviada para o Congresso decidir, junto com voce e os que s?o favoraveis; E tambm  os que s?o contra, sob alega??o moral,religiosa, etc, etc.|`|00e52497d6731e38e01f3339d9ca1672aa	Eu j disse antes aqui e REPITO: O INSS deveria fazer um levantamento de todos os aidticos que s?o catlicos, alm dos filhos indesejados de catlicos e enviar as respectivas contas de tratamento dos primeiros, alimenta??o, moradia , roupas e educa??o dos segundos para a Igreja Catlica. Garanto que o Papa ia mudar de posi??o rapidinho!    Acho o cmulo que um grupo de pessoas que optou por n?o ter vida sexual queira ditar os hbitos e comportamentos sexuais dos demais.

Essa Comunidade de seres anglicos e perfeitos, da qual  Jesus um dos membros divinos, ao que nos foi dado saber, apenas j se reuniu, nas proximidades da Terra, para a solu??o de problemas decisivos da organiza??o e da dire??o do nosso planeta, por duas vezes no curso dos milnios conhecidos.  A primeira, verificou-se quando o orbe terrestre se desprendia da nebulosa solar, a fim de que se lan?assem, no Tempo e no Espa?o, as balizas do nosso sistema cosmog?nico e os prdromos da vida na matria em igni??o, do planeta, e a segunda, quando se decidia a vinda do Senhor  face da Terra, trazendo  famlia humana a li??o imortal do seu Evangelho de amor e reden??o.    A CINCIA DE TODOS OS TEMPOS    N?o  nosso propsito trazer  considera??o dos estudiosos uma nova teoria da forma??o do mundo. A Cincia de todos os sculos est cheia de apstolos e missionrios. Todos eles foram inspirados ao seu tempo, refletindo a claridade das Alturas, que as experincias do Infinito lhes imprimiram na memria espiritual, e exteriorizando os defeitos e concep??es da poca em que viveram, na fei??o humana de sua personalidade.  Na sua condi??o de operrios do progresso universal, foram portadores de revela??es gradativas, no domnio dos conhecimentos superiores da Humanidade. Inspirados de Deus nos penosos esfor?os da verdadeira civiliza??o, as suas idias e trabalhos merecem o respeito de todas as gera??es da Terra, ainda que as novas express?es evolutivas do plano cultural das sociedades mundanas tenham sido obrigadas a proscrever as suas teorias e antigas frmulas.  Lembrando-nos, porm, mais detidamente, de quantos souberam receber a intui??o da realidade nas perquiri??es do Infinito, busquemos recordar o globo terrqueo nos seus primeiros dias.    OS PRIMEIROS TEMPOS DO ORBE TERRESTRE    Que for?a sobre-humana p?de manter o equilbrio da nebulosa terrestre, destacada do ncleo central do sistema, conferindo-lhe um conjunto de leis matemticas, dentro das quais se iam manifestar todos os fen?menos inteligentes e harm?nicos de sua vida, por milnios de milnios? Distando do Sol cerca de 149.600.000 quil?metros e deslocando-se no espa?o com a velocidade diria de 2.500.000 quil?metros, em torno do grande astro do dia, imaginemos a sua composi??o nos primeiros tempos de existncia, como planeta.  Laboratrio de matrias ignescentes, o conflito das for?as telricas e das energias fsico-qumicas opera as grandiosas constru??es do teatro da vida, no imenso cadinho onde a temperatura se eleva, por vezes, a 2.000 graus de calor, como se a matria colocada num forno, incandescente, estivesse sendo submetida aos mais diversos ensaios, para examinar-se a sua qualidade e possibilidades na edifica??o da nova escola dos seres. As descargas eltricas, em propor??es jamais vistas da Humanidade, despertam estranhas como??es no grande organismo planetrio, cuja forma??o se processa nas oficinas do Infinito.    A SOLIDIFICA??O DA MATRIA    Na grande oficina surge, ent?o, a diferencia??o da matria pondervel, dando origem ao hidrognio. As vastid?es atmosfricas s?o amplo repositrio de energias eltricas e de vapores que trabalham as substancias torturadas no orbe terrestre. O frio dos espa?os atua, porm, sobre esse laboratrio de energias incandescentes e a condensa??o dos metais verifica-se com a leve forma??o da crosta solidificada.   o primeiro descanso das tumultuosas como??es geolgicas do globo. Formam-se os primitivos oceanos, onde a gua tpida sofre press?o difcil de descrever-se. A atmosfera est carregada de vapores aquosos e as grandes tempestades varrem, em todas as dire??es, a superfcie do planeta, mas sobre a Terra o caos fica dominado como por encanto. As paisagens aclaram-se, fixando a luz solar que se projeta nesse novo teatro de evolu??o e vida. As m?os de Jesus haviam descansado, aps o longo perodo de confus?o dos elementos fsicos da organiza??o planetria.    O DIVINO ESCULTOR    Sim, Ele havia vencido todos os pavores das energias desencadeadas; com as suas legi?es de trabalhadores divinos, lan?ou o escopro da sua misericrdia sobre o bloco de matria informe, que a Sabedoria do Pai deslocara do Sol para as suas m?os augustas e compassivas. Operou a escultura geolgica do orbe terreno, talhando a escola aben?oada e grandiosa, na qual o seu cora??o haveria de expandir-se em amor, claridade e justi?a. Com os seus exrcitos de trabalhadores devotados, estatuiu os regulamentos dos fen?menos fsicos da Terra, organizando-lhes o equilbrio futuro na base dos corpos simples de matria, cuja unidade substancial os espectroscpios terrenos puderam identificar por toda a parte no universo galxico. Organizou o cenrio da vida, criando, sob as vistas de Deus, o indispensvel  existncia dos seres do porvir. Fez a press?o atmosfrica adequada ao homem, antecipando-se ao seu nascimento no mundo, no curso dos milnios; estabeleceu os grandes centros de for?a da ionosfera e da estratosfera, onde se harmonizam os fen?menos eltricos da existncia planetria, e edificou as usinas de ozone a 40 e 60 quil?metros de altitude, para que filtrassem convenientemente os raios solares, manipulando-lhes a composi??o precisa  manuten??o da vida organizada no orbe. Definiu todas as linhas de progresso da humanidade futura, engendrando a harmonia de todas as for?as fsicas que presidem ao ciclo das atividades planetrias.

J que quando morremos viramos p, o contrrio tambm pode ser verdade, ou seja, podemos ter sido criados.( esta  a minha resposta)    Mas embora seja um assunto longo, acho que vale a pena voce le o artigo abaixo.  Nos informa sobre a polmica que  a cren?a na evolu??o. Considere a resposta da pergunta abaixo.    Tenho de crer na evolu??o?    NOS anos recentes, algumas juntas estaduais e escolares nos Estados Unidos suscitaram obje??es a que a evolu??o fosse ensinada como fato nas escolas pblicas. Um destes estados  a Califrnia.    A Junta Estadual de Educa??o da Califrnia decide o que deve ser includo nos compndios das escolas pblicas. Mas, recebe recomenda??es de grupos de peritos de vrios campos. Um destes grupos  o Comit Consultivo Estadual Sobre Educa??o Cientfica. Este enviou um esbo?o para a instru??o cientfica nas escolas pblicas estaduais.    O Comit Consultivo recomendou que o assunto da evolu??o fosse ensinado como fato, e n?o apenas como teoria. No entanto, a Junta de Educa??o n?o concordou. Ordenou que a evolu??o fosse ensinada como teoria, ao invs de fato. Tambm ordenou que os compndios mencionassem a cria??o como outra explica??o para a origem da vida que tem algum apoio cientfico.    O comit cientfico reagiu de forma explosiva, afirmando, com efeito: N?o h dvida de que a evolu??o  um fato. Vemos exemplos dirios dela. Nenhuma pessoa responsvel a questiona.  tanto um fato como o  a gravidade e o s?o os tomos! Um membro do comit at mesmo assemelhou a cren?a na cria??o  cren?a em supersti??es tais como a astrologia, ou que a lua era feita de queijo verde ou que a cegonha traz os bebs.    Sem embargo, h muitos que realmente questionam a validez do ensino da evolu??o. Uma de tais pessoas que jamais considerara as provas oferecidas a favor da evolu??o como sendo finais decidiu entrevistar pessoas que crem na evolu??o. A seguir se acham as suas observa??es, junto com as conversa??es reais que teve na enquete que fez com os crentes na evolu??o.    Por Que Muitos Crem Nela?    Creio na evolu??o, disse-me um distinto cavalheiro, porque a cincia investigou cabalmente o assunto e  unanime em aceit-la como um fato.    O Sr.?confia muito nos cientistas, observei.    Sua folha de servi?os testifica a sua fidedignidade, n?o acha?  respondeu ele.    O motivo de ele crer na evolu??o foi ecoado muitas vezes durante minha entrevista. Descobri que a maioria dos crentes na evolu??o s?o crentes nela porque lhes foi dito que todas as pessoas inteligentes tambm crem nela.    Uma senhora obviamente bem-instruda, de seus quarenta e poucos anos, me desafiou com a pergunta: Quais s?o suas habilita??es para questionar as descobertas dos cientistas profissionais?    Inicialmente, respondi-lhe, deixe-me inform-la que eles brigam entre si. Discutem quando aconteceu, por que aconteceu, como aconteceu, qu?o rpido aconteceu, e at mesmo se de fato aconteceu!    Da, continuei, respondendo  sua pergunta sobre minhas habilita??es. Quais s?o as habilita??es dum juiz que tem de julgar um caso envolvendo quest?es mdicas sobre as quais n?o esteja instrudo? Se for inteligente e objetivo, ouvir os argumentos dos peritos a favor e contra, e ent?o decidir  base do testemunho deles. De que outro modo poderia uma pessoa fazer uma decis?o sobre os vrios campos de conhecimento nesta era de especializa??o?    Mas o assunto da evolu??o  t?o tcnico, redargiu ela.    Respondi-lhe: Theodosius Dobzhansky [cientista evolucionista] afirma que grande parte do trabalho dos cientistas est alm da compreens?o do leigo mediano, mas que a evolu??o n?o est. Ele afirma que isso  uma quest?o de biologia elementar. E George Gaylord Simpson [outro destacado evolucionista] contende que  imoral ter f cega, quer numa doutrina religiosa quer numa teoria cientfica. Tambm afirma que  a responsabilidade do homem testar as descobertas dos especialistas e ent?o decidir, e que a pessoa n?o tem de ser um bilogo pesquisador para avaliar a evidncia sobre a evolu??o.    Demasiadas pessoas, conclu, simplesmente aceitam as opini?es de outros e repetem as idias deles como papagaios, ao invs de tomarem tempo para examinar os fatos.    Visto que ela n?o comentou nada mais, adicionei: A senhora ficaria surpresa de ver quantas pessoas crem na evolu??o sem saber praticamente nada sobre ela.    Intimida??o e Lavagem Cerebral    Antes de eu dirigir minha enquete de casa em casa com pessoas que crem na evolu??o, li cerca de vinte livros escritos por evolucionistas. Mesmo antes disso, contudo, por muitos anos desde meus dias de faculdade, empenhei-me em me manter em dia com os acontecimentos cientficos nesse campo. Mas agora, examinei de modo especfico os recentes escritos de destacados evolucionistas.    Ao assim fazer, fiquei surpreso com o tipo de intimida??o ou lavagem cerebral que usavam. Isto  tipificado pelo seguinte resumo breve de doze livros de autoria de onze diferentes evolucionistas:    A evolu??o  universalmente aceita pelos cientistas competentes para julgar.  reconhecida por todos os cientistas responsveis. Todos os bilogos de grande reputa??o concordam em que  um fato estabelecido. N?o existe mente informada hoje em dia que negue que o homem descende dos peixes. N?o  mais uma quest?o duvidosa.

Quando as formas de intera??o entre o bicho homem e o resto da natureza chegarem a um ponto insustentvel tornando a destrui??o mais rpida que a constru??o.   o esgotamento indubitvel de um modelo de sociedade, quando a nica alternativa ser o abandono de velhos padr?es de comportamento e a adapta??o  nova realidade.

O que significa a palavra cus neste caso? Este termo  s vezes aplicado  morada espiritual de Deus e de seus filhos anglicos. (Mateus 6:9; 18:10) Cus pode tambm referir-se ao Universo fsico. (Deuteron?mio 4:19) E?a Bblia usa este termo para se referir  atmosfera da prpria Terra, onde os pssaros voam e os ventos sopram. ?Salmo 78:26; Mateus 6:26.      A qual desses cus subiu o profeta Elias? ?evidente que ele foi transferido atravs da atmosfera da Terra para outro lugar no globo. Elias ainda se encontrava na Terra anos depois, pois escreveu uma carta ao Rei Jeor?o, de Jud. (2?Cr?nicas 21:1, 12-15) Que Elias n?o ascendeu  morada espiritual de  Deus foi mais tarde confirmado por Jesus Cristo, que declarou: Nenhum homem ascendeu ao cu, sen?o aquele que desceu do cu, o Filho do homem, quer dizer, o prprio Jesus. (Jo?o 3:13) O?caminho para a vida celestial foi pela primeira vez aberto para humanos imperfeitos aps a morte, ressurrei??o e ascens?o de Jesus Cristo. ?Jo?o 14:2,?3; Hebreus 9:24; 10:19,?20.

Como se explica que o homem tenha sido levado a crer que tais coisas pudessem agradar a Deus?  Principalmente, porque n?o compreendia Deus como sendo a fonte da bondade. Nos povos primitivos a matria sobrepuja o esprito; eles se entregam aos instintos do animal selvagem. Por isso  que, em geral, s?o cruis;  que neles o senso moral, ainda n?o se acha desenvolvido. Em segundo lugar,  natural que os homens primitivos acreditassem ter uma criatura animada muito mais valor, aos olhos de Deus, do que um corpo material.    Foi isto que os levou a imolarem, primeiro, animais e, mais tarde, homens. De conformidade com a falsa cren?a que possuam, pensavam que o valor do sacrifcio era proporcional  importancia da vtima. Na vida material, como geralmente a praticais, se houverdes de oferecer a algum um presente, escolh-lo-eis sempre de tanto maior valor quanto mais afeto e considera??o quiserdes testemunhar a esse algum. Assim tinha que ser, com rela??o a Deus, entre homens ignorantes.    a) - De modo que os sacrifcios de animais precederam os sacrifcios humanos?  Sobre isso n?o pode haver a menor dvida.    b) - Ent?o, de acordo com a explica??o que vindes de dar, n?o foi de um sentimento de crueldade que se originaram os sacrifcios humanos?  N?o; originaram-se de uma idia err?nea quanto  maneira de agradar a Deus.    Considerai o que se deu com Abra?o. Com o correr dos tempos, os homens entraram a abusar dessas prticas, imolando seus inimigos comuns, at mesmo seus inimigos particulares. Deus, entretanto, nunca exigiu sacrifcios, nem de homens, nem, sequer, de animais. N?o h como imaginar-se que se Lhe possa prestar culto, mediante a destrui??o intil de Suas criaturas.    670. Dar-se- que alguma vez possam ter sido agradveis a Deus os sacrifcios humanos praticados com piedosa inten??o?  N?o, nunca. Deus, porm, julga pela inten??o. Sendo ignorantes os homens, natural era que supusessem praticar ato louvvel imolando seus semelhantes. Nesses casos, Deus atentava unicamente na idia que presidia ao ato e n?o neste.  propor??o que se foram melhorando, os homens tiveram que reconhecer o erro em que laboravam e que reprovar tais sacrifcios, com que n?o podiam conformar-se as idias de Espritos esclarecidos. Digo - esclarecidos, porque os Espritos tinham ent?o a envolv-los o vu material; mas, por meio do livre-arbtrio, possvel lhes era vislumbrar suas origens e fim, e muitos, por intui??o, j compreendiam o mal que praticavam, se bem que nem por isso deixassem de pratic-lo, para satisfazer s suas paix?es.    671. Que devemos pensar das chamadas guerras santas? O sentimento que impele os povos fanticos, tendo em vista agradar a Deus, a exterminarem o mais possvel os que n?o partilham de suas cren?as, poder equiparar-se, quanto  origem, ao sentimento que os excitava outrora a sacrificarem seus semelhantes?  S?o impelidos pelos maus Espritos e, fazendo a guerra aos seus semelhantes, contravm  vontade de Deus, que manda ame cada um o seu irm?o, como a si mesmo. Todas as religi?es, ou, antes, todos os povos adoram um mesmo Deus, qualquer que seja o nome que lhe dem. Por que ent?o h de um fazer guerra a outro, sob o fundamento de ser a religi?o deste diferente da sua, ou por n?o ter ainda atingido o grau de progresso da dos povos cultos? Se s?o desculpveis os povos de n?o crerem na palavra daquele que o Esprito de Deus animava e que Deus enviou, sobretudo os que n?o o viram e n?o lhe testemunharam os atos, como pretenderdes que creiam nessa palavra de paz, quando lhes ides lev-la de espada em punho? Eles tm que ser esclarecidos e devemos esfor?ar-nos por faz-los conhecer a doutrina do Salvador, mediante a persuas?o e com brandura, nunca a ferro e fogo. Em vossa maioria, n?o acreditais nas comunica??es que temos com certos mortais; como querereis que estranhos acreditassem na vossa palavra, quando desmentis com os atos a doutrina que pregais?    672. A oferenda feita a Deus, de frutos da terra, tinha a Seus olhos mais mrito do que o sacrifcio dos animais?  J vos respondi, declarando que Deus julga segundo a inten??o e que para Ele pouca importancia tinha o fato. Mais agradvel evidentemente era a Deus que Lhe oferecessem frutos da terra, em vez do sangue das vtimas. Como temos dito e sempre repetiremos, a prece proferida do fundo da alma  cem vezes mais agradvel a Deus do que todas as oferendas que lhe possais fazer. Repito que a inten??o  tudo, que o fato nada vale.    673. N?o seria um meio de tornar essas oferendas agradveis a Deus consagr-las a minorar os sofrimentos daqueles a quem falta o necessrio e, neste caso, o sacrifcio dos animais, praticado com fim til, n?o se tornaria meritrio, ao passo que era abusivo quando para nada servia, ou s aproveitava aos que de nada precisavam? N?o haveria qualquer coisa de verdadeiramente piedoso em consagrar-se aos pobres as primcias dos bens que Deus nos concede na Terra?  Deus aben?oa sempre os que fazem o bem. O melhor meio de honr-Lo consiste em minorar os sofrimentos dos pobres e dos aflitos. N?o quero dizer com isto que Ele desaprove as cerim?nias que praticais para lhe dirigirdes as vossas preces. Muito dinheiro, porm, a se gasta que poderia ser empregado mais utilmente do que o . Deus ama a simplicidade em tudo. O homem que se atm s exterioridades e n?o ao cora??o  um Esprito de vistas acanhadas. Dizei, em conscincia, se Deus deve atender mais  forma do que ao fundo.|`|69694aa28968d0770327a953d0a59841aa	Deus n?o aceita ou exige sacrifcio humano para apaziguar sua ira. Mas Saul (2 Samuel: 6,9,14) havia quebrado juramento sagrado (v. Js 9). Seus crimes contra os gibeonitas n?o s?o mencionados em nenhuma outra parte das Escrituras; nossa nica informa??o encontra-se no versculo 2. Assim, agora Deus usa uma fome para chamar a aten??o para essa injusti?a  mas n?o sem antes permitir a Israel tempo suficiente para corrigir o erro.    Os gibeonitas achavam que a restitui??o era necessria. Em certo sentido, a morte dois dois filhos e cinco netos de Saul pode ser considerada condena??o divina para a crueldade de Saul, seguindo os princpios do vingador do sangue. Veja em Nm 35.19. e o que fazia o vingador de sangue em Js 20.3. Nesse caso, entretanto, a justi?a foi executada por Davi a favor de Gibeom, mais ou menos como hoje em dia os juzes s?o agentes de Deus no cumprimento da lei e da ordem (v. Rm 13.4).    Infelizmente, os filhos muitas vezes sofrem pelos atos dos pais, em muitos pases, as crian?as s?o vtimas da guerra e do terrorismo da gera??o anterior.

Imaginam que este planeta, apesar de 6.000 anos de histria em registro, fabricou todos os seres humanos, na mesmssima fbrica de rob?s, construida pelos idealistas comunistas, que nada tinham de mais salutar para ocuparem seus infants pensamentos utpicos, a n?o ser disseminarem sua infeliz filosofia poltica de estado igualitrio.  Ensinamos, ha anos atrs, capitalismo na Sibria e alguns tupiniquins ainda consideram a possibilidade de um regime ditatorial como algo maravilhoso, malgrado todos os esfor?os histricos neste sentido.    Aprendi, quando crian?a, que Deus fez as pessoas, mas percebi ao longo de meu precrio crescimento intelectual que Ele n?o dividiu igualmente inteligncia entre elas.  Percebi que a quantidade de pessoas imbecs  incomensuravelmente maior que as de alguma sabedoria.  Como tratar a todos como sendo imbecs?  A reside o nico grandioso dilema do comunismo.   Nada mais injusto que impor um tratamento igual a desiguais.   Outra aberra??o  a ausncia da propriedade privada como sendo um desejo sagrado e inerente a todos desde o ber?o. Imaginar que j no ber?o desejamos tais idias  defender que j nascemos com idias inatas.   Um hilariante despautrio!   N?o conheci nenhuma crian?a que n?o desejasse ter sua prpria boneca ou biclicleta, e que n?o a defendesse com unhas e dentes das demais.   Propriedade privada.  exatamente a essa idia que me referi ha pouco.   O comunismo baseia-se na idia de que todos s?o iguais aos mais pobres. Jamais vi um comunista defender a idia de que a humanidade deveria ser igualitariamente milionria.  ( Tal ideal est na base do capitalismo, que defende essa possibilidade na individualidade.)   Sabemos que se retirarmos o dinheiro de todos os bolsos e o dividirmos igualmente entre todas as pessoas do planeta, em poucos anos o dinheiro haver retornado aos seus antigos bolsos.   O comunista n?o leva este "aforismo" em considera??o, apesar da larga ratifica??o histrica nos quatro cantos do mundo.  Fazer o que?

Porm, eu percebi que o objetivo de sua pergunta foi querer atingir ateus porque esses regimes de alguma forma pregavam o atesmo e  pblico e notrio que ateus criticam muito todas as mortandades que foram feitas em nome de Deus. Eu te respondo que muitos comunistas n?o acreditam em Deus mas eram fanticos por uma idia. A idia do poder absoluto em m?os do Estado para o Estado promover a igualdade total. Muitos tinham f nessa idia e morreriam por ela enquando que os cabe?as do comunismo se preocupavam mesmo,  em ter poder. A mesma coisa acontece com religiosos. Alguns morrem por sua f enquanto suas lideran?as se preocupam em ter poder. Nesse caso, os comunistas ateus e os religiosos tambm podem ser cegos por uma cren?a que necessariamente n?o tem que ser relgiosa. Pode ser filosfica, poltica e etc. Talvez esses professores sejam comunistas t?o fanticos como muitos religiosos.|`|862615f2cee99165e074e6c57fdcd0aeaa	N?o s os comunistas que matam em tempo de guerra ou de revolu??o, mas democrticos  capitalistas que matam o tempo todo sem a gente perceber, vc acha que o maior lucro dos estados Unidos vem d onde?

Existem dois problemas com essa lgica:    1) POSTULOU-SE que um ser supremo, perfeito e infinito criou X e deu-se o nome a esse ser de Deus. Isso  obviamente arbitrrio.    2) Invocar um Deus para explicar o surgimento de alguma coisa complexa na natureza (que seja improvvel que tenha surgido por acaso) requer que Deus seja t?o ou mais improvvel do que a coisa que ele demanda explicar, porque ele, sendo criador do universo,  mais complexo do que qualquer coisa no universo. Portanto, Deus seria mais improvvel do que qualquer coisa do universo! E surgiu do nada!!!!!!!!!    Esses argumentos s?o lgicos, mas os crentes acreditam que n?o. E tentar?o te convecer com os argumentos mais absurdos, arbitrrios e ilgicos.|`|kYO1Psc0aa	iih cara voce de novo?  ninguem aqui tem capacidade de te convencer nao, mas  atraves de pessoas como voce que a Palavra de Deus serve de grande testemunho.

Vou lhe dar um exemplo prtico: eu mesmo. Eu sou espiritualista, acredito na reencarna??o e na lei do carma. S que eu nasci numa famlia catlica praticante, estudei por quase 10 anos em colgio catlico, fiz 5 anos de catequese e nada disso me convenceu sobre os dogmas da Igreja. A minha cren?a "espiritualista" foi bem mais forte do que qualquer argumento.    Olha, n?o se preocupe, n?o vou tentar te convencer sobre minhas teorias espirituais. At porque, como eu disse, nada iria lhe convencer.    Portanto, os evanglicos, catlicos, espritas e cia podem gastar os dedos tentando te conquistar que nada ir adiantar.     Seria a mesma coisa ao contrrio. Tente convenc-los de sua (des)cren?a. Tente me convencer que espritos n?o existem, que  tudo inven??o da nossa cabe?a. Voc passaria a noite escrevendo e nada do que voc postar iria me convencer.     At porque a cincia (ao contrrio do que os ateus acreditam) ainda n?o tem respostas para tudo. Portanto, mesmo baseado nela, n?o se pode dizer com convic??o que o universo  apenas esse "lado" material que enxergamos aqui na Terra.|`|7e541725c9cb0870efe9d374c209dd9eaa	Voces acham muito ignorante que acredita em Deus,mas por acaso  muito "esclarecido" que acredita que o "nada e os acaso" podem fazer o Tudo e o Todo ?

Abra?o|`|cETksEZlaa	Filosoficamente falando, como voc deseja, o mal n?o  nada alm da ausncia do bem ou do amor.   O amor  uma energia viva que est por todo o universo, assim como a luz.  Mal e trevas n?o existem, n?o possuem energia ou vida prpria, sendo somente a ausncia do amor e da luz, respectivamente.   por essa raz?o que intuitivamente associamos o mal s trevas, e o bem  luz.    Se entendeu at aqui, poderemos ent?o concluir que o mal a que voc se refere e que nos causa sofrimento,  a ausncia de Deus, ou do amor em nossos cora??es.  Quanto menos amor irradiamos, mais sofremos.    Na minha humilde opini?o, o mal simplesmente n?o existe, assim como n?o existe a sua personifica??o, o diabo.  Tudo depende da energia que carregamos conosco, em tudo aquilo que fazemos e pensamos.    Por isso a necessidade ntima que sentimos em seguir o bom caminho, mesmo que tudo em volta nos tente o contrrio ou nos pare?a sem solu??o.  Mesmo o pior dos bandidos tem a conscincia ntima do mal que pratica, mas n?o tem for?as para mudar o rumo de sua histria pessoal.    Por isso acredito que todos e n?o apenas alguns eleitos, caminham em dire??o a nica coisa real que existe, ou seja, o amor ou se preferir, Deus.  Em nosso mundo de ilus?es e vida limitada, temos dificuldade para ver isso, mas o Universo n?o tem pressa e nem conta o tempo como ns fazemos.    De uma forma ou de outra, leve o "tempo" que levar, todos, sem exce??o de um nico que seja, chegaremos l, mas n?o posso afirmar como ou quando. S tenho convic??o de que tudo que foi criado com amor n?o se perder, pois essa  uma energia eterna e infinita.   aqui que termina meu conhecimento e come?a a minha f.

Foi exatamente a quest?o que foi levantada no jardim do Eden.  Satans questionou a legitimidade do governo de Deus, insinuou ao primeiro casal de humanos que sem Deus seria melhor. Deus tem dado um tempo (a maniera de contar o tempo de Deus  diferente do nosso) para que o homem e Satans provem que vivem melhor sem Ele.  Durante sculos tem-se testado todo tipo de governo humano: ditadura, comunismo, democracia, socialismo... e outros. Todos um verdadeiro fracasso.

N?o h nada que aconte?a que Ele n?o tenha ativamente decretado  nem mesmo um simples pensamento na mente do homem. Visto que isto  verdadeiro, segue-se que Deus decretou a existncia do mal; Ele n?o o permitiu meramente, como se algo pudesse se originar e acontecer aparte de Sua vontade e do Seu poder. Visto que temos mostrado que nenhuma criatura pode fazer decis?es completamente independentes, o mal nunca poderia ter come?ado sem o decreto ativo de Deus, e n?o poderia continuar nem por um momento aparte da vontade de Deus. Deus decretou o mal, no final das contas, para a Sua prpria glria, embora n?o seja necessrio conhecer ou declarar esta raz?o para defender o Cristianismo do problema do mal.     Todavia, aqueles que vem que  completamente impossvel desassociar Deus da origem e continua??o do mal, tentam distanciar Deus do mal dizendo que Deus meramente permitiu o mal, e que Ele n?o causou nada dele. Contudo, visto que a prpria Escritura declara que Deus ativamente decretou tudo, e que nada pode acontecer aparte da Sua vontade e do Seu poder, n?o faz sentido dizer que Ele meramente permite algo  nada acontece por mera permiss?o de Deus.

Tenho selecionado em graus de importancia segundo a constru??o de meu juzo de valores, os ensinamentos morais que Cristo nos deixou e um deles trata especificamente  deste assunto.   Os fariseus eram zelosos pela exigncia do cumprimento da lei mosaica e estavam incessantemente importunando o Mestre para coloc-lo em contradi??o sobre seus sagrados ensinamentos e a letra que mata do Velho Testamento e percebendo Jesus pregar para uma multid?o sobre a unidade da famlia, Lhe questionaram sobre o repdio  mulher:  Mateus, 19  "...3. Os fariseus vieram perguntar-lhe para p?-lo  prova:  permitido a um homem rejeitar sua mulher por um motivo qualquer?    4. Respondeu-lhes Jesus: N?o lestes que o Criador, no come?o, fez o homem e a mulher e disse:    5. Por isso, o homem deixar seu pai e sua m?e e se unir  sua mulher; e os dois formar?o uma s carne?    6. Assim, j n?o s?o dois, mas uma s carne. Portanto, n?o separe o homem o que Deus uniu.    7. Disseram-lhe eles: Por que, ent?o, Moiss ordenou dar um documento de divrcio  mulher, ao rejeit-la?    8. Jesus respondeu-lhes:  por causa da dureza de vosso cora??o que Moiss havia tolerado o repdio das mulheres; mas no come?o n?o foi assim.    9. Ora, eu vos declaro que todo aquele que rejeita sua mulher, exceto no caso de matrim?nio falso, e desposa uma outra, comete adultrio. E aquele que desposa uma mulher rejeitada, comete tambm adultrio.    10. Seus discpulos disseram-lhe: Se tal  a condi??o do homem a respeito da mulher,  melhor n?o se casar!    11. Respondeu ele: Nem todos s?o capazes de compreender o sentido desta palavra, mas somente aqueles a quem foi dado."    Cristalizei em minha mente os versculos 8 e 11 e tenho-os como princpio irredutvel de que Jesus dizia que  t?o somente pelo amor  que se edifica a unidade de uma rela??o conjugal, n?o aquele amor impregnado de paix?es, de egosmo, mas aquele amor do amar ao prximo como a ti mesmo, o amor perd?o, compreens?o, aceita??o das diferen?as peculiares inatas a todo ser, aceita??o da pessoa como ela , enfim, Cris, aquele amor puro, singelo e indelvel por afinidade imanente,   que uma m?e sente pelo seu filho, os la?os fraternos que unem espiritualmente o casal, pois nossa uni?o matrimonial tambm  uma oportunidade que temos para progredir nossas virtudes.  A dureza de nossos cora??es s?o nosso latente orgulho, dio, intolerancia, e outras falhas de carter que devemos trabalhar e construir em nosso interior o amor t?o necessrias para o entendimento da mxima prescrita no versculo 11.  Portanto, carssima irm?zinha Cris, o aamor  o pilar da sustentabilidade de todo casamento.  Obrigado pela oportunidade concisa que me foi dada para expressar minhas impress?es sobre os sagrados ensinamentos do Divino Mestre, Cris e continue fazendo perguntas como esta que certamente  muito construtiva para refletirmos profundamente sobre quem verdadeiramente somo ns em nosso interior e o que estaamos fazendo para contribuir com a felicidade de nosso par na rela??o conjugal.

f133c927ee8d4a5b7706ee8efa0462f8aa	*** g95 22/10 pp. 4-8 Projetados para uma vida eterna ***    em seu livro How and Why We Age (Como e Por Que Envelhecemos), o Dr. Leonard Hayflick reconheceu as maravilhas da vida humana e do crescimento, e escreveu: Depois de realizar os milagres que nos levam da concep??o ao nascimento e da ao amadurecimento sexual e estado adulto, a natureza preferiu n?o arquitetar um mecanismo, aparentemente mais elementar, que simplesmente perpetuasse esses milagres. Essa vis?o intriga os biogentorologistas h dcadas.    Voc tambm fica intrigado com o envelhecimento e a morte? A que objetivo servem? Hayflick observou: Virtualmente todos os eventos biolgicos, da concep??o ao amadurecimento, parecem ter um objetivo, mas o envelhecimento n?o tem. N?o  bvio por que o envelhecimento tenha de ser obrigatrio. Embora tenhamos aprendido muito sobre a biologia do envelhecimento . . . ainda ficamos com o inevitvel desfecho do envelhecimento sem sentido seguido da morte.     possvel que n?o tenhamos sido feitos para envelhecer e morrer, mas sim para viver eternamente na Terra?    O desejo de viver    Sabe-se que praticamente ningum gosta da idia de envelhecer e morrer. De fato, muitos temem essa perspectiva. Em seu livro How We Die (Como Morremos), o mdico Sherwin B. Nuland escreveu: Nenhum de ns parece psicologicamente preparado para aceitar a idia de estar morto, com o conceito de inconscincia permanente, sem vazio nem vcuo  em que n?o existe simplesmente nada. Conhece algum que gostaria de envelhecer, adoecer e morrer?    Se a velhice e a morte fossem naturais e parte de algum plano-mestre, n?o seriam bem-vindas? Mas n?o s?o. Por que n?o? A resposta est na maneira em que fomos feitos. A Bblia diz: Deus tambm p?s no nosso cora??o a idia da eternidade. (Eclesiastes 3:11, Brasileira) Por causa desse desejo de um futuro infinito, as pessoas h muito procuram a chamada fonte da juventude. Desejam permanecer eternamente jovens. Isto leva  pergunta: temos o potencial de uma vida mais longa?    Projetado para consertar a si mesmo    Escrevendo na revista Natural History, o bilogo Austad apresentou o conceito comum: Tendemos a pensar a respeito de ns mesmos e de outros animais o mesmo que pensamos a respeito das mquinas: que o desgaste  simplesmente inevitvel. Mas n?o  assim. Organismos biolgicos s?o fundamentalmente diferentes das mquinas, disse Austad. Eles se autoconsertam: feridas saram, ossos emendam, doen?as passam.    Da a intrigante pergunta: por que envelhecemos? Como Austad perguntou: Por que, ent?o, os [organismos biolgicos] est?o sujeitos aos mesmos tipos de desgaste que as mquinas? Visto que os tecidos do organismo substituem a si mesmos, n?o poderiam fazer isso perpetuamente?    Na revista Discover, o bilogo evolucionista Jared Diamond discorreu sobre a maravilhosa capacidade dos organismos fsicos de restaurar a si mesmos. Ele escreveu: O exemplo mais visvel de controle de danos aplicado ao nosso corpo  a cura de ferimentos, pelo qual reparamos o dano causado  nossa pele. Muitos animais conseguem resultados muito mais espetaculares do que ns: lagartos regeneram caudas decepadas, estrelas-do-mar e caranguejos seus bra?os ou membros, pepinos-do-mar seus intestinos.    A respeito da substitui??o dos dentes Diamond declarou: Os humanos desenvolvem duas sries, os elefantes seis e os tubar?es um nmero indefinido durante a sua vida. Da, ele explicou: A substitui??o regular acontece tambm a nvel microscpico. Ns substitumos as clulas que forram o nosso intestino a cada poucos dias, as da bexiga a cada dois meses e os glbulos vermelhos do sangue a cada quatro meses.    A nvel molecular, as nossas molculas de protena est?o sujeitas a uma renova??o contnua num ritmo peculiar a cada protena especfica; desse modo evitamos o acmulo de molculas danificadas. Assim, se voc comparar a aparncia de um ente querido seu hoje com a de um ms atrs, talvez pare?a o mesmo, mas muitas molculas individuais que constituem o organismo dele agora s?o diferentes.    A maioria das clulas do corpo s?o periodicamente substitudas por outras recm-formadas. Algumas, porm, como os neur?nios do crebro, talvez nunca sejam substitudas. Mas Hayflick explicou: Se todas as partes da clula forem substitudas, ela n?o ser mais a mesma velha clula.  possvel que os neur?nios com que voc nasceu pare?am hoje ser as mesmas clulas, mas, na realidade, muitas das molculas que os compunham quando voc nasceu . . . podem ter sido substitudas por novas molculas. Portanto, no fim das contas, clulas n?o-divisveis podem n?o ser as mesmas clulas com as quais voc nasceu. Isto porque os componentes das clulas s?o substitudos. Assim, teoricamente, a reposi??o de materiais do corpo poderia manter-nos vivos para sempre!    Lembre-se de que o Dr. Hayflick falou de milagres que nos levam da concep??o ao nascimento. Quais s?o alguns destes? Ao examin-los brevemente, pense na possibilidade de implanta??o do que ele chamou de mecanismo, aparentemente mais elementar, que simplesmente perpetuasse esses milagres.    A clula    Um adulto se comp?e de uns 100 trilh?es de clulas, cada qual de impenetrvel complexidade. Ilustrando isso, a revista Newsweek comparou a clula a uma cidade murada. Usinas geram a energia da clula, disse a revista. Fbricas produzem protenas, itens vitais do comrcio qumico. Complexos sistemas de transporte conduzem agentes qumicos especficos dum ponto para outro, dentro e fora da clula.

O cristianismo surgiu antes mesmo do nascimento de Jesus Cristo como revela a Bblia em vrios livros do Antigo Testamento. O mundo est vivendo um verdadeiro caus, onde tudo o que est escrito na Bblia  real, pois ela relata a cria??o do cu e da terra at os ltimos dias de vida do ser humano registrados no livro de Apocalipse.                      Agora pra qu duvidar da Bblia se ela  verdadeiramente a Palavra de Deus. Os crentes ou evanglicos de qualquer denomina??o, que de fato crer e pratica o que nela est escrito, simplismente est?o tentando conscientizar as pessoas para esse fato real, com a preoculpa??o das vidas que de alguma forma foram contamindos pelo pecado para que as mesmas n?o percam a salva??o, ou seja, Jesus  a nica solu??o do mundo.            Veja o seguinte! Se voc n?o viver de acordo com a Bblia, significa que o meu amigo n?o est interessado na salva??o de sua prpria vida, quero lhe dizer que a vida aqui na terra  passageira e que viver eternamente s aps a primeira morte, veja o seguinte, a primeira  n?o viver mais na terra, a segunda, se voc n?o entregar a sua vida para Jesus ante de perder a vida, certamente passar para a segunda morte que  a perca da Salva??o, ou seja, viver eternamente no lago que arde com fogo e enxofre, mas se ante de morrer voc passar a sua vida para Jesus e viver conforme os ensinamento bblicos, n?o existir a segunda morte para o meu querido amigo. Tudo isso est escrito na Bblia. Voc crer?                Eu quero dizer ainda mais que os crentes n?o s?o superiores a ningum, somos todos iguais, mas vivendo de forma diferente por causa do reconhecimento de que Jesus Cristo veio ao mundo n?o para que julgasse o mundo e sim para que o mundo seja salvo por ele.               A Bblia ainda diz no livro de Romanos no captulo 3 vesculo 23, que por causa do pecado todos ns ficamos de fora da Glria de Deus, ou seja, n?o tendo mais nenhuma oportunidade de voltar para l, mas o mesmo livro no captulo 5 e no versculo 8 diz que Deus prova do seu prpiro amor para conosco pelo fato de ter Cristo morrido na cruz sendo ns ainda pecadores, Deus entregou o seu filho Jesus para dar esta que  a nica chece para todos ns, que outrora estavamos sem solu??o, mas que agora poderemos aproveitar esta oportunidade de n?o sermos condenado, por meio de Cristo o Filho do Vivo.                Agora entrega a tua vida para Ele hoje antes que seja tarde dimais.             Jesus te ama e eu tambm.

Tempo e espa?o, s?o no??es humanas e tridimensionais, j relativisadas pelo gnio da fsica Albert Einstein, portanto a pergunta de quem criou Deus, tendo necessariamente que passar por algo situado no tempo e no espa?o, deixa de ser condizente com a prpria cincia e lgica humana.

Ele sempre existiu, existe hoje e sempre vai existir. Deus nunca vai morrer!       O mais importante para ns  sabermos que Jesus morreu na cruz, para que eu e vocs tambm possamos ser como Deus um dia, isto , possamos viver para sempre e nunca mais morrer.       J pensou que legal voc ter tempo pra fazer tudo o que gosta, sem medo, nem dor, nem choro, nem morte? Pois  isso que Deus vai dar para todos os que aceitarem a Jesus em seus cora??es.       Em Apocalipse 1:8, a Bblia nos diz o seguinte:       "Eu sou o Alfa e o ?mega, diz o Senhor Deus, aquele que , e que era, e que h de vir, o Todo-Poderoso."       Ent?o entendemos que Deus  hoje, ou seja, vive hoje. Era antes ou seja, sempre viveu. e tambm H de vir, ou seja, Ele vir para nos buscar para que ns vivamos para sempre junto com ELE.       Somos criaturas de Deus, e n?o conseguimos entender muito do que Ele . O que sabemos a respeito dEle  porque Ele revelou na Sua Palavra, a Bblia.

Meu ex marido nasceu em uma famlia que n?o era crist?, os pais dele n?o tinham religi?o e n?o falaram pra ele de Deus, mas ensinaram sobre como ser uma pessoa honesta e integra, ent?o meu marido n?o cresceu em um lar ouvindo sobre milagres ou sobre uma virgem q deu a luz ao salvador do mundo, ele cresceu lendo livros e criando suas prprias expectativas do mundo, sabendo que tudo que ele fizesse seria responsabilidade dele e que ningum poderia ajud-lo a ser melhor ou responsvel pela felicidade ou atos deles alm dele prprio.    Ele simplesmente n?o cr pq n?o foi criado dentro de nenhuma religi?o e acredita em sua for?a de trabalho e em seus atos para realizar o que quer.    Nunca se interessou por religi?o e  de longe a pessoa mais integra e inteligente q eu conhe?o, nunca o vi julgar ningum (nem aparncia nem atos), nem fazer nada que fosse ferir o direito de outro, ent?o nao acho que ele seja anormal, pra mim ele  ateu e eu respeito isso, respeit o fato dele crer em algo diferente do que eu creio e mesmo asim ser algum t?o humano como ele .

Unidos a corpos materiais, eles constituem a Humanidade que povoa a Terra e as outras esferas habitadas; separados do corpo, constituem o mundo espiritual ou dos Espritos que povoam os espa?os. Deus os criou perfectveis; deu-lhes por objetivo a perfei??o, e a felicidade que dela  conseqncia, mas n?o lhes deu a perfei??o; quis que a devessem ao seu trabalho pessoal, a fim de que lhe tivessem o mrito. Desde o instante de sua forma??o, progridem, seja no estado de encarna??o, seja no estado espiritual; chegados ao apogeu, s?o puros Espritos, ou anjos segundo a denomina??o vulgar; de sorte que, desde o embri?o do ser inteligente at o anjo, h ma cadeia ininterrupta, da qual cada elo marca  um grau no progresso.    Disso resulta que existem Espritos em todos os graus de adiantamento moral e intelectual, segundo estejam no alto, embaixo, ou no meio da escala. H Espritos, por conseqncia, em todos os graus de saber e de ignorancia, de bondade e de maldade. Nas classes inferiores, h os que est?o ainda profundamente inclinados ao mal, e que nele se comprazem. Querendo-se, pode-se cham-los de dem?nios, porque s?o capazes de todas as a??es feias atribudas a estes ltimos. Se o Espiritismo n?o lhes d esse nome,  porque se liga  idia de seres distintos da Humanidade, de uma natureza essencialmente perversa, votados ao mal pela eternidade e incapazes de progredirem no bem.    Segundo a doutrina da Igreja, os dem?nios foram criados bons, e se tornaram maus pela desobedincia: s?o os anjos decados; foram colocados por Deus no alto da escala e desceram. Segundo o Espiritismo, s?o Espritos imperfeitos, mas que se melhorar?o; est?o ainda na base da escala e subir?o.    Aqueles que, pela sua indiferen?a, sua negligncia, sua obstina??o e sua m vontade permanecem tempo mais longo nas classes inferiores, disso carregam a pena, e o hbito do mal torna-os mais difcil de sair dele; mas chega um tempo em que se cansam dessa existncia penosa e dos sofrimentos que lhes s?o a conseqncia;   ent?o que, comparando a sua situa??o com a dos bons Espritos, compreendem que seu interesse est no bem, e procuram se melhorar, mas o fazem por sua prpria vontade e sem serem  constrangidos a isso. Eles est?o submetidos  lei do progresso por sua aptid?o em progredir, mas n?o progridem apesar deles. Para isso Deus lhes fornece, sem cessar, os meios, mas s?o livres para aproveitarem ou n?o. Se o progresso fosse obrigatrio, eles n?o teriam nenhum mrito, e Deus quer que tenham o de suas obras; n?o coloca nenhum na primeira classe por privilgio, mas a primeira classe est aberta a todos, e a ela n?o chegam sen?o por seus esfor?os. Os mais elevados anjos conquistaram o seu grau como os outros, passando pela rota comum.    Chegados a um certo grau de depura??o, os Espritos tm miss?es em rela??o com o se adiantamento; eles cumprem todas as que s?o atribudas aos anjos das diferentes ordens. Como Deus criou de toda a eternidade, de toda a eternidade se encontram Espritos para satisfazer a todas as necessidades do governo do Universo. Uma nica espcie de seres inteligentes, submetidos  lei do progresso, basta, pois, para tudo. Essa unidade na cria??o, com o pensamento que todos tm um mesmo ponto de partida, a mesma rota a percorrer, e que se elevam por seu prprio mrito, responde bem melhor  justi?a de Deus, que a cria??o de espcies diferentes, mais ou menos favorecidas de dons naturais que seriam tantos privilgios.    A doutrina vulgar sobre a natureza dos anjos, dos dem?nios e das almas humanas, n?o admitindo a lei do progresso, e vendo, contudo, seres em diversos graus, disso concluiu que eram o produto de tantas cria??es especiais. Ela chega, assim, a fazer de Deus um pai parcial, dando tudo a alguns de seus filhos, ao passo que imp?e aos outros os mais rudes trabalhos. N?o  de se admirar que, durante muito tempo, os homens n?o tenham encontrado nada de chocante nessas preferncias, ent?o que as usavam do mesmo modo em rela??o aos seus filhos, pelos direitos inatos e os privilgios de nascen?a; poderiam crer fazer mais mal que deus?    Mas hoje o crculo das idias se alargou; eles vm mais claro; tm no??es mais limpas da justi?a; querem-na para eles, e se n?o a encontram sempre na Terra, esperam ao menos encontr-la mais perfeita no cu; e aqui est porque  toda doutrina onde a justi?a divina n?o lhes apare?a em sua maior pureza, lhes repugna a raz?o.|`|WKi3xPYQaa	Porque Ele  o prprio...

Mas exatamente por ainda poderem apresentar desvios, s?o ambas consideradas como teorias, e para confiar na sua veracidade exigem uma parte de f. No caso de Darwin bem menos que no caso de Kardec, visto que as evidncias s?o mais fortes, tambm por se ligar mais s cincias naturais que s cincias humansticas (como em Kardec), onde tudo  logicamente muito mais complicado.

Em 1998 os gelogos da Universidade de Columbia William Ryan e Walter Pittman elaboraram a teoria de que o Dilvio na verdade seria um mito derivado de uma fantstica catstrofe natural, ocorrida por volta do ano 5600 a.C., nas margens do atual Mar *****.    Segundo as proposi??es dos dois pesquisadores, o evento regional teria provocado a migra??o de diversos grupos sobreviventes - o que explicaria o carter dito universal (que se encontra em vrias culturas ao longo da Terra) do Dilvio.    Para os gelogos, o evento foi provocado pelo degelo ocorrido ao final da ltima glacia??o. Em suas pesquisas analisaram as forma??es geolgicas e imagens submarinas, concluindo que uma grande quantidade de gua marinha rompeu o atual estreito de Bsforo, com a eleva??o paulatina e excessiva do Mar Egeu e dali para o Mar de Mrmara, ocasionando a abrupta inunda??o do Mar *****.    Aditaram, com muitos contraditores, que a agricultura, ent?o incipiente na vida humana, tambm se propagara a partir dessa migra??o, pela Europa, sia e Oriente Mdio. O meio cientfico considera plausvel o cataclismo, mas n?o as conclus?es de que esta tenha sido a origem do mito do dilvio.    Outros pesquisadores tambm consideram o fato como podendo ter sido real, e o relato bblico seria, portanto, autntico. A hiptese de que uma grande inunda??o local tenha tomado lugar na Mesopotamia, com uma inunda??o causada pelos rios Tigre e Eufrates que tiveram uma enchente acima do normal (estipula-se que as enchentes naturais da agricultura sazional daquela regi?o seriam em torno de 9 metros, e nessa poca os rios encheram-se 5 metros  mais, isso : 14 metros) o que causou uma devasta??o total de toda a regi?o em algum momento, for?ando a constru??o s pressas de embarca??es para abrigar os sobreviventes, parece n?o transmitir corretamente a vvida descri??o de caos que os relatos parecem mostrar. As propor??es da catstrofe parecem ter sido mundiais. O relato bblico do Dilvio chega a dizer: "Assim foram exterminadas todas as criaturas que havia sobre a face da Terra, tanto o homem como o gado, o rptil, e as aves do cu; todos foram exterminados da terra; ficou somente No, e os que com ele estavam na arca" Gnesis 7:21-23.    Alguns acreditam ainda que a prpria arca poderia ser encontrada em algum ponto do Cucaso, possivelmente no Monte Ararat, onde diversos relatos de pilotos que sobrevoaram a regi?o durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial afirmavam ter visto um imenso barco no meio dessa cadeia de montanhas|`|PgitbiWlaa	Sim  realemnte aconteceu pq est na biblia

Ou que comunh?o, da luiz com as trevas? Que harmonia entre Cristo e o Maligno? Ou que uni?o, do crente com o incrdulo?"  Esse texto  em geral, entre evanglicos, aplicado ao casamento. Mas n?o se refere necessariamente ao casamento, pelo menos, n?o somente ao casamento!   Note que na primeira Carta de Paulo aos Corntios, todo o captulo 7  dedicado a quest?es sobre o casamento. E nesse captulo n?o se recomenda a separa??o entre c?njuges, no caso de um ser crist?o e outro incrdulo. Mais ainda, "porque o marido incrdulo  santificado no convvio da esposa, e a esposa incrdula  santificada no convvio do marido crente. Doutra sorte, os vossos filhos seriam impuros; porm, agora, s?o santos" (v. 14).   Creio que o fundamental no casamento  o amor! Lutero, o famoso reformador protestante, n?o se opunha que um crist?o (ou crist?) se casasse com uma (um) mu?ulmana (o). Mas  necessria que haja amor e respeito ao outro!  Quanto ao casamento entre crist?os de diferentes igrejas, entre catlicos(as) e evanglicos(as), por exemplo,  necessrio o respeito ao outro, o ideal seria quos c?njuges sejam ecumnicos! Eu sou pastor presbiteriano e minha mulher  catlica e isso nunca foi motivo de briga!  Fique na Paz de Cristo!

JE N'ARRIVE PAS A CROIRE QU'EN 2007 IL PUISSE Y AVOIR (CF en dessous) autant de rponses antismites comme ?a !|`|bd674f23949a2991b8e2edd026f9bfdbaa	Quand tu apprendras  bien pleurnicher pour arriver  tes fins, tu comprendras pourquoi...|`|ed4577b505387058eefa897dbe91a81aaa	les armniens, cambodgiens et les esclaves n'ont pas t br?ls/gazs par gnrations entires, dans des usines de la mort, avec un programme politique qui organisait ?a officiellement et de manire mticuleuse voir administrative.  Poser ce genre de question c'est vraiment mconnaitre cette poque de l'histoire.  et quand je vois les rponses de certains je comprends pourquoi les juifs ont toujours peur que ?a recommence......... :-(  et pour ton information le gnocide armnien a t reconnu par la france, et la question de l'esclavagisme est largement traite en france, mais certains ont l"ouie trs slective et n'coutent que lorsque l'on parle des juifs apparement.|`|89c3764b8ae1d433ea2dc5c677189ea4aa	on parle aussi du gnocide arminien sa reconnaissance ou sa ngation (par les descendants de ses auteurs) est mme une question d'actualit.  C'est vrai que l'on parle moins du gnocide Kmer, est que l'on oublie le gnocide rawandais.  L'holocauste possde toute fois une particularit, il a concern des personnes vivant dans des pays Europens donc a marqu notre histoire, c'est aussi la premire fois que l'on avait des images d'un massacre organis et que nous avons jug les bourreaux.  Quand  l'esclavage aboli une premire fois en France lors de la rvolution et dfinitivement en 1948, il figure dans les livres d'histoires et a sa journe commmorative, par contre on oublie les pays qui n'ont aboli l'esclavage que dans la seconde moiti du vingtime sicle (arabie saoudite, mauritanie...) ou ceux qui le pratiquent encore comme le soudan mais l faut dire qu'il ne s'agit pas de "mchants fran?ais"|`|39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	tu es pour le championnat de nombres de victimes?

Mais quand demandera-t-on galement  pardon pour tous les Africains dports, humilis, traits comme des marchandises ? Ca on dirait que c'est plus difficile  faire... Et aussi puisqu'on y est, demander pardon  tous ces gens qui ont t coloniss-mpriss...   Je n'en fais pas directement partie, seulement en temps qu'etre humain..|`|VCa1AZvMaa	par ce que l'holocoste est une fa?on pour les juifs de tenir en otage les occidentaux. ils dnigrent toutes les autres victimes car ils se prennent pour des victimes suprieures. n'as tu pas remarqu que dans toute l'histoire, on n'a "jamais" eu l'explication du pourquoi de l'hollocoste: pourquoi quelqu'un d'aussi intelligent a pu vouloir tuer des millions de gens? qu'est ce qui a pu nourir cette haine vicrale? moi j'ai la rponse, mais sa solution a t la mauvaise. il fallait les virer d'europe, comme sarko avec les immigrs, et les interdire de sjour en europe, interdiction de commerce avec l'europe, mais surtout pas la mort, car on a hrit de cette culpabilisation, et ?a va durer encore des centaines d'anne car c'est trop bon pour eux|`|ae2ba51e7aac92e2eb8b179099653a42aa	Tous les peuples de la terre ont subi la torture mais la ruse des ce peuple lu comme le plus sale de tous c'est qu'il n'arrte pas de pleurer. un bourreau en apparence d'une victime.|`|62a254f87d0f2b49e49f3022faf20fc5aa	en dehors de tes fautes d'orthographe, c'est une bonne question: a propos du genocide juif, hitler disait:  "trente ans apres, personne ne se souvient des armniens; dans trente ans personne ne se souviendra de ce que nous faisons maintenant"  on se souvient de l'holocauste mais pas du gnocide armnien; ni des millions de noirs a qui on a vol la vie en les faisant esclaves; ni du massacre des aborignes, ni de celui des indiens d'amerique..  l'extreme droite israelienne a besoin de ce battage mdiatique pour rapatrier l ' aalyah en Israel de maniere a poursuivre le programme de colonisation..  des fran?ais de religion juive ont re?u un dpliant les invitant a s'installer en Israel pour une bouche de pain; en arrivant la bas, apres avoir tout quitt en france, ils se rendent compte que la maison etait tres peu chere car en territoire palestinien..et ?a arrive tout les jours; eux obligs de se dfendre contre les palestiniens, les palestiniens obligs de se battre pour ne pas laisser tomber une terre qui est  eux..|`|f1d1e6d84afe07963197e03fb71aba60aa	Ce qui choque dans l'holocauste, c'est qu'un tel projet ait t form  une poque si rcente. Un tel massacre 50 ou 100 avant aurait t dans la normalit historique de l'poque. C'est un peu comme si Mireille Mathieu se mettait  faire du rap.    Auschwitz, c'est le secteur A du crime historique.      Ensuite, il y a le fait que les Juifs ont t mal aims depuis longtemps, et puis qu'ils ont toujours tout fait pour (intgrs sans jamais se dissoudre, ils pratiquent l'usure). Le peuple lu n'est pas forcment lu pour la belle vie : leur histoire est leur destine.. C'est ce qui a fait leur force, et c'est ce qui les a condamn  tre sans cesse accabls.    Si Hitler avait une descendance, elle serait un peu dans la position des juifs : innocente, mais condamne soit  l'exclusion, soit  la dissolution (changement d'identit, mariage, etc).|`|6155d68772dbbd0c22de55ac178ddc21aa	Ecoute un peu plus l'actualit, le gnocide armnien est assez d'actualit...    Il faut admettre que les sionistes utilisent et abusent de la Shoah. Des politiques isra?liens utilisent mme le nombre de morts dans les camps et affirment que ce sont des juifs, niant ainsi le massacre des homosexuels, tsiganes, communistes, handicaps mentaux...  Evidemment qu'il y a une utilisation  fin politique de ce gnocide, ce qui est profondment dgueulasse. Et ce n'est ap qu'en France.    Pour l'esclavage, le sujet est assez sensible car certains veulent aussi politiser cela pour faire n'importe quoi (Dieudonn?). Et on ne veut stigmatiser que l'esclavage europen, alors que les africains s'esclavaient entre eux et que les arabes ont crs le systme en Afrique noir. Ce sont d'ailleurs eux  avoir aboli l'esclavage en dernier (1962 et non pas y a 1400 ans comme el croient certains)|`|205b8b37700a3a15b9cb2b4058f130bdaa	Comment ne pas tre coeur par certaines rponses donnes ici???

A quoi sert de faire la comptition entre atrocits? C'est de la connerie pure et simple. Effectivemnt je suis pour qu'on parle plus de ce qu'il s'est pass au Rwanda (la france n'aurait elle pas aussi sa part de reponsabilit la dedans), au darfour ou partout ailleurs.

Deuximement, l'esclavage tait quelque chose de tragique qui a exist depuis des milliers d'annes aussi bien en Afrique qu'en Europe ou en Asie.  Troisimement, le gnocide des juifs pendant la seconde guerre mondial est la premire  (et esprons dernire) tentative de tuer systmatiquement et industriellement une ethnie particulire.  Quatrimement, il existe encore des survivants du gnocide juif, alors que l'esclavage est fini (en ce qui concerne la France en tout cas), depuis plus d'un sicle.    Il n'y a pas  chercher de complots sionistes dans tout ?a, c'est plut?t simple et clair.|`|45396a0d0f294e871b5b455d3f371dc3aa	Parcequ'en France on ne parle que de ce qui nous arrange.

39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	"Poser un lapin" signifie de nos jours ne pas aller  un rendez-vous, sans prvenir la personne qui nous attend. Cependant, le sens tait autrefois diffrent. En 1880 par exemple, cela voulait dire "ne pas rtribuer les faveurs d'une jeune fille". En effet  cette poque, le "lapin" dsignait un refus de paiement. Par la suite, il a galement dsign un voyageur clandestin. L'expression, sous sa forme actuelle, serait apparue vers 1890 chez les tudiants, et pourrait provenir de "laisser poser", qui signifie "faire attendre quelqu'un".|`|042fbae5b5366fc00895d2e47d609289aa	quand on donnait rendez vous  un chasseur dans la garrigue et qu'il ne pouvait pas venir, il posait un lapin fraichement tu pour demander  celui  qui il faisait dfaut de bien vouloir l'excuser !|`|21caafb09b19d3e19f526105b1680f34aa	Parce qu'on a essay avec un canard, mais il s'est envol !|`|a6ab9b67fdb7d4f449fc577e4c3ede9daa	Parceque le lapin ?a coplule a la tire la rigot  et qu'on peut pas chasser plusieurs lievres  la fois    alors si une etait soit disant indispose on allait voir ailleurs...

C'est comme le renouveau dans l'esprit"groupe charismatique existant dans  nos paroisses de l'Eglise catholique Romaine.  Jusqu' prsent,il n'y a aucun renouveau Africain.  Si nous voulons un renouveau Africain,il faut qu'on demande aux occidentaux de nous aider.  Tout seul,on n'en sortira point.  Ceux qui gouvernent notre continent aujourd'hui avaient tous etudis chez les occidentaux,y compris moi qui vous parle.  Rien ne peut changer en Afrique sans l'assistance volontaire de nos frres et soeurs occidentaux.  En ma qualit de libre penseur et chercheur,j'aimerai vous dire que l'homme blanc etait cr en premire position,l'homme noir en second lieu et enfin,vient l'animal.  Ce qui existe au ciel:(pre,fils et saint esprit),existe aussi sur la terre(l'homme blanc,l'homme noir et l'animal).  Le contraire egare celui qui l'accepte.  Ce sont des cours que j'ai suivis bonnement chez les occidentaux.  Pendant que la solidarit est difficile  pratiquer en Afrique,ne parlez pas du renouveau.  Qui avait dj dirig son peuple ici en Afrique sans l'assistance volontaire des occidentaux?Personne.  Est-ce qu'on invente ici en Afrique?Non,monsieur.  Si l'Eglise catholque Romaine evolue mme chez nous en Afrique,c'est parce qu'on pratique bien la solidarit.il y a l'homme noir et l'homme blanc au sein de l'Eglise mre.L'Evque peut tre un noir Africain mais,il est qu' mme respect par les prtres blancs.Le cur peut tre un Noir Africain mais,il est qu' mme respect par les prtres blancs.Voila ce que Dieu veut pour les Noirs Africains.  Nous souffrons parce que nous ne voulons pas suivre l'exemple des clergs qui se respectent.  Avant l'independance,les noirs Africains et les blancs travaillaient ensemble.Tout le monde mangeait  sa faim.Nos parents avaient fait de bonnes etudes.On vivait dans la solidarit.On se respectait.Aujourd'hui, c'est la misre.  Les clergs et moi sommes toujours heureux parce que nous savons vivre en societ.  Je sais que dans d'autres diocses de l'Eglise catholique Romaine existant en Afrique Noir,ils ne beneficient plus des dons mais,ils se debrouillent qu' mme pour scolariser les futurs prtres.Ce sont nos politiciens qui nous crent tous ces problmes.  Continuez toujours  fonder vos eglises(sectes) dans vos parcelles avec vos pasteurs et vos faux prophtes et faites la politique comme vous voulez.Continuez  se moquer de nos prtres, ngliger nos colonisateurs et  commander les armes.  Vous verrez ce que ?a va donner dans 1O ans.  Vous aurez grandement besoin des clergs et des occidentaux et,ils vous demanderont de vous debrouiller.  Les Chinois ont des coles secrtes chez eux.Leurs savants venaient de dire aux autorits Chinoises d'entrer en Afrique pour chercher fortune afin que la Chine devienne une trs grande puissance mondiale.Vous verrez dans 5ans,ce que deviendra la Chine.Moi aussi,j'ai fait l'cole secrte.Qui va m'ecouter ici en Afrique?Nul n'est prophte dans son pays.

Elle a besoins des contradictions, des doutes et des changes pour progresser, alors que lareligion n'admet qu'une vrit (mme si le contenu de cette vrit donne lieu  des contradictions infinies entre fidles), la foi comme remde au doute et la dlivrance du message, sans vritable dialogue.    La division entre le comment et le pourquoi est une conception religieuse.  Pour la science, le pourquoi lient des causes et des effets particuliers, dans un domaine prcis. En religion, le pourquoi revient  chercher la cause premire,. Or l'affirmation d'une cause premire est dj un acte de foi, et l'on ne recherche donc que ce que l'on a dj affirm comme existant: raisonnement circulaire    Bien videmment, la religion recherche aussi le pourquoi de faits particuliers, mais c'est pour les ramener  la cause premire, pour les reconduire dans l'unit premire comme disaient les gnostiques.     Tu dis que la science fait des erreurs? Il y a en effet des tentatives qui n'aboutissent pas, des reculs, des recommencements. On teste les thories, on limine les plus faibles, on intgre dans des quilibres les plus stables possible, on volue.    La ralit fait pareil,  et la science, ou en tout cas une pense athe, est donc seule apte  expliquer les erreurs, les essais et les slections qui se produisent dans la ralit, alors que le mythe d'un Crateur, et d'une cration unique en est incapable.

A portion of givings of course goes to the pastors salary and insurance.  Some goes to up keep of the church itself (cleaning, repair) and so goes to givings which support church projects such as missionary work at home and abroad.  A person elected by the church takes the money and counts the givings...a SECOND elected person is the treasurer, who provides a second line of check for the monies and deposits it in the bank.  A person in the bank, not a church member, then verifies all amounts are correct.  It works much like any business.    PL|`|fdd829938c07d94d14fd05d7f4292551aa	Many denominations are different.

Roga ao Senhor que afaste de ns essas serpentes. Moiss intercedeu pelo povo, e o Senhor disse a Moiss: Faze para ti uma serpente ardente e mete-a sobre um poste. Todo o que for mordido, olhando para ela, ser salvo. Moiss fez, pois, uma serpente de bronze, e fixou-a sobre um poste. Se algum era mordido por uma serpente e olhava para a serpente de bronze, conservava a vida." (Nmeros, XXI, 7-9)     A Bblia diz que:     1.  preciso fazer penitncia dos pecados, alm de arrepender-se; era preciso olhar - cultuar - a serpente;     2.  muito til pedir intercess?o dos santos, no caso de Moiss, pois Deus atende;     3. Pode-se fazer imagens; no caso, da serpente;     4. Pode-se colocar a imagem (serpente de bronze) em destaque, elevando-a num madeiro;     5. Pode-se olhar para a imagem com a esperan?a de ser atendido por Deus: o povo olhava para a serpente, e ACREDITAVA QUE ESTARIA SALVO; e todos se curavam.    Quando mostramos aos protestantes que a Bblia permite fazer imagens, eles ent?o dizem que os catlicos idolatram as imagens porque se prostram diante delas. Mas de novo vemos pela Escritura que prostrar-se diante de algum n?o  idolatria, mas reverncia e venera??o:     "Jac, levantando os olhos, viu Esa que avan?ava com quatrocentos homens. Repartiu ent?o os filhos entre Lia, Raquel e as duas servas. Colocou as servas com seus filhos na frente, depois Lia com os seus, e, por ltimo Raquel com Jos. E ele, passando adiante, prostrou-se at a terra sete vezes antes de se aproximar do seu irm?o. " (Gnesis, 33, 1-3)     Por fim, os protestantes v?o dizer que  um absurdo ter relquias, que a sim  a prova de que os catlicos praticam a idolatria. Contra eles, novamente, a Bblia:     Deus fazia milagres extraordinrios por intermdio de Paulo, de modo que len?os e outros panos que tinham tocado o seu corpo eram levados aos enfermos; e afastavam-se deles as doen?as e retiravam-se os espritos malignos. (Atos, XIX, 11-12)     Portanto, a proibi??o bblica  de fazer imagens para idolatria. A Bblia mostra que se podem fazer imagens, e que pode haver venera??o e que as relquias dos santos produzem milagres.     isso o que a Igreja faz, seguindo a Bblia. E o que os protestantes - antibblicos - n?o fazem.|`|xdJOJh7baa	Na realidade mts pessoas n?o se d?o conta doq est?o fazendo!

E os seus dicipulos chegando a Jesus disse:         __Sua m?e esta ai te procurando, e Jesus respondeu:         __Quem  minha m?e?

Porque a mulher que some para o homen senitr saudade, s se ele gostar muito dela ou ent?o simplesmente ele vai procurar outra para preencher o vazio e a "saudade"que a outra deixou. Acho que tudo em exesso sufoca e faz mal.|`|uBBA58aRaa	Na minha opini?o as mulheres mais carinhosas,meigas e femininas .  O contrario, tem alguns ate que se arriscam , mais no futuro este relacionamento vai acabar, pois quem vai gostar de passar uma vida com aguem que n?o tenha estas qualidades. Eu como mulher n?o gostaria de ter um homem  do meu lado que n?o tivesse estes comportamentos carinhoso, sensvel e etc...  Bjs!!!|`|h5qCprRYaa	Sinceramente, isso varia de homem pra homem. Tem homem que gosta de mulher com a qual ele se sinta o protetor. Tem outros que gostam de uma companheira de farra, que n?o seja melosa. Eu acredito que a maioria dos homens n?o gosta de mulher muito melosa, grudenta, mas que tambm tenha seus momentos carinhosos. Acho que  sempre um meio termo, nunca um extremo.

8OkzxkClaa	Com todo prazer, lhe respondo sua pergunta: Falar em lnguas  um dos muitos dons do Esprito-Santo, que  dado  a todos que servem a Jesus Cristo (Deus), e buscam este dom de todo cora??o assim como se buscam os demais dons atravs tambm do jejum e ora??o. O dom de falar em Novas Lnguas ou tambm chamado de "Lnguas estranhas", s?o linguagens faladas intimamente entre a pessoa e Deus, como intermedirio o Esprito Santo. Na hora em que a pessoa fala em lnguas estranhas com Deus, fala grandes mistrios com Deus, e s a pessoa e Deus sabem o que est?o conversando. O diabo n?o compreende essa linguagem falada entre Deus e os homens, e por isso ele tem muita raiva do dom de lnguas Estranhas e faz de tudo para impedir que os crist?os recebam. Para mais informa??es, recomendo que procure o auxlio e orienta??o de um Pastor de uma Igreja Evanglica Pentecostal, pois as Igrejas Evanglicas, de linhagem Pentecostal s?o as que mais buscam o dom de lnguas e mais se aprofundam neste assunto.

Mas, pelo que estou entendendo da sua pergunta, voc quer saber da pronncia, n?o ?  Pois bem, existe uma tendncia no portugus brasileiro (principalmente nas regi?es Sudeste e Centro-Oeste) de fazer uma abertura na vogal para fazer diferen?a entre verbo e substantivo. Isto n?o  percebido pelo falante,  inconsciente.    Alguns exemplos (vou usar acentos s para mostrar pronncia. Os acentos n?o se escrevem na realidade):    Eu aplo  O aplo - o verbo fica aberto para diferenciar do substantivo  Eu blo  o b?lo (o verbo bolar vem de bolo ou bola).  Eu mlho  o m?lho  Eu tro  o t?ro (que  um tipo de madeira. Lembre-se que  sem acento na escrita)  Eu fcho - o fcho    A tendncia n?o muda. A regra continua a progredir. Na atualidade, dentre os verbos que est?o nessa transi??o, est o verbo "roubar". Apesar dos gramatiqueiros de plant?o considerarem um erro, trata-se apenas de uma tendncia muito forte do portugus.    Como ningum pronuncia "um roUbo", mas sim "um r?bo", para fazer a diferen?a, fala-se o verbo como "eu rbo". O verbo endoidar  outro exemplo (eu endido).    Muitos dos verbos continuam ainda na forma tradicional nas regi?es Nordeste e Norte, mas com uma visvel tendncia  modifica??o, assim como j ocorreu com mais for?a no Sudeste. Enfim,  uma tendncia no pas inteiro, por isso, n?o se pode dizer que  errado.|`|00b10a47a6213a7ca5716a354e6c2821aa	Eu roubo  Por exemplo: Eu roubo um sapato|`|e10bc36d1b62ee0486114e0b349f54e3aa	Roubo; o verbo  Roubar, n?o Robar.|`|5ee2ced374f4d7784c8a9c7e4aaa680faa	roubo  o mesmo que assalto , com violencia cara a cara autor e vitima.  quando se pega algo escondido a noite ou abrir janelas de automoveis e levar algo,  furto. roubar  com u  roubo|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Eu rob?  nome de filme.|`|GZ8vqIjLaa	Roubar  errado mesmo escrito certo!

d06b686d844dd7e0134a05b12aafe965aa	Io vivo a Palermo, citt storica per eccellenza.  Dire che ha avuto un passato burrascoso  niente: nel corso dei secoli ha subto diverse invasioni e diverse influenze: dapprima I Fenici, poi i Greci (da cui il nome di Palermo, "Panormos" = tutto porto), Arabi, Normanni (questi ultimi insieme agli arabi hanno "lasciato il segno", nel senso che grazie a loro abbiamo un fantastico, un po' rovinato certo, centro storico: la Cattedrale arabo normanna, Palazzo Reale noto come "Palazzo dei normanni", varie chiese in stile arabo...), poi la contesa fra Angioini ed Aragonesi, entrambi hanno influito sulla nostra citt...e per un breve periodo anche dai Savoia...quanto a fattori artistici, non possiamo lamentarci: Palermo  ricca di arte: barocca, rococ, liberty...ad esempio i vari chioschetti e le ville costruite da Ernesto Basile; il "Teatro Politeama" e il "Teatro Massimo" esempi architettonici stupendi, la "via della libert" in stile liberty..."ovviamente non poteva mancare anche l'influenza fascista di mussolini, come il palazzo delle poste in via Roma e la stazione dei Vigili del Fuoco in via Ruggiero Settimo.Proprio negli ultimi anni si stanno attuando dei progetti di restaurazione e di ripresa di monumenti in via di degrado per portare alla luce il bello di Palermo;altra particolarit sono i mercati: Cassaro, Vuccira, il Capo e Ballar,i cui nomi originali derivano da varie lingue: il Cassaro (dall'arabo Al-Kasr), la Vuccira (dal francese Bouchere che adesso significa "baccano, confusione").Dal punto di vista gastronomico, siamo famosi per la cassata siciliano, fatta di pasta reale, frutta candita, ricotta dolce e gocce di cioccolato; siamo fra i pochi a fare le brioches col gelato; le famose arancine al burro o alla carne (e adesso con tanti guisti in pi); il nostro tesoro pi grande sono gli agrumi: "le arance rosse di Sicilia" e i limoni e infine gli uliveti.Passando all'enoteca, famosi sono il Nero D'Avola e il   Marsala Florio, che troverai nella citt di Marsala.

E' una citt piena di fascino e suggestioni e, fino a qualche anno fa, era anche una citt a misura d'uomo e pulita. Purtroppo ora  molto sporca, trasandata, inquinata, piena di microcriminalit e degrado.

Morfologicamente molto caratteristica: divisa tra mare e monti: quelle poche volte che nevica puoi passare in mezz'ora dal passeggiare sulla spiaggia a pestellare sulla neve. Artisticamente ricchissima, mite e ventosa. Praticamente la nebbia non esiste.   Qualche neo?  Poche strade, strette, inerpicate e caotiche.  Un po' troppo ottusa e chiusa, come persone.   Molto diffidente alle innovazioni come possibilit lavorative.  Ma  non la cambierei con nessun'altra citt al mondo!|`|5Mc62ynuaa	pi che citt ti parlo del paese...

E' abbastanza grande per potersi perdere, ma non troppo per non ritrovare la strada. Anche se spesso soprattutto d'inverno con la nebbia sembra il posto pi triste di questa terra, non lo . E' divertente, incasinata, e piena di vita. I milanesi non stanno fermi un secondo; sempre in giro per la citt a fare chiss cosa durante il giorno e a divertirsi la sera (ormai anche le 11 di sera sono diventate ora di punta).

Praticamente ci conosciamo tutti e siamo tutti amici.  Io abito in periferia e dalla finestra di casa mia vedo sia il torrente Belbo che un'enormit di campi coltivati.  E' molto tranquillo come posto, non  affatto isolato (abbiamo sia gli autobus sia la linea ferroviaria che in 20 minuti ci portano al capoluogo di provincia) e inoltre puoi praticamente fare quello che vuoi perch in determinate ore non c' mai nessuno in giro (io quando parto alle 3 del pomeriggio con la mia bici da corsa posso passare in paese come voglio che non trovo nessuno).  Personalmente la citt non mi  piaciuta mai pi di tanto, ma forse  perch ho sempre vissuto in campagna.  Come economia non siamo messi male:abbiamo una carpenteria metallica, un panificio e addirittura un hotel a 5 stelle (lo so che non ci crederete ma  vero...) in un ex castello reale.Poi abbiamo anche dei negozi e la SOMS, dove ci si ritrova al bar per farsi raccontare ci che succede in paese.

Nel mio autobus ci sono zingari che, diciamo, non si lavano certo tutti i giorni, la loro fermata, peccato,  la penultima, la mia  l' ultima, scendono ed entrano in delle case abusive costruite sulla discarica.

43db8849f5fa8bd5d41584dc68f95e34aa	It was 11:35 pm two days before Christmas in Las Vegas.  I had just started walking home from the grocery store with a gallon of milk a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, and a can of cat food.  As I finished walking across Boulder Highway I heard a boy shout, "Shoot that one!"  I spun around and saw they boys face and the shot gun barrel sticking from the car window.  I saw the flash and heard the explosion of the report.  It felt like to fists punched me hard at the same time in the chest, and knocked me off my feet. My head cracked down hard on the pavement and everything went black.       I woke to the feel of cold milk squirting in  my face, and saw the manager from the apartment complex standing over me.  "Oh God I think he's alive!" I heard him exclaim.  I stood up and noticed that the windshield of the car parked behind me had been blown out and that milk was steadily squirting out of tiny holes in the gallon jug.  I didn't have a single wound other than a large throbbing lump on the back of my head.    Later that night when I was washing my jacket I had worn I found several shot gun pellets in the bottom of the washing machine.  This entire story is documented by the Las Vegas Police Department.|`|334528cdd9e0bf5b6f028b1a39daada0aa	Whatever is called a miracle, isn't.

The doctors told us there was nothing they could do for her and that we needed to prepare for her to die. A pastor walked in as my family and I were around my grandmother. He prayed w/ all of us and there was something in his prayer. . .you could simply feel it. I had given up hope and was really thinking you can pray all you want to but the doctors said. . . . Well, after the preacher prayed he said he felt something happening. I left and went home that night and laid on my bathroom floor and cried and prayed and cried and cried. The next morning I got a phone call bright and early telling me that my grandmother was sitting up and talking and the doctors were speechless. This year my grandmother is turning 87 years old. . .Praise God. :)|`|fZ6mWzZtaa	I've been born again, filled with the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues. I'm telling you I went from darkness and deception into Jesus' wonderful light. I am free.  Well I know that I have had my share of failing and falling,but I have come to understand,one thing remains.  By all He's done I have been made holy worthy of serving the One, the One who wrote eternity so deep in my heart.  Open your eyes and see the wonder of a life so wonderfully free.   Lift up your head believe there is more, There's so much more to see.  I've seen miracles since I was 6yrs old.  Most interesting was a man who came to our church when I was around 12 yrs. He had been released from his life sentence in prison... God had completely changed his finger prints.  For myself when I was 14 I was in a car wreck, the car had a blow out and it rolled five times. When I arrived at the hospital the neurosurgeon felt my neck and said I should have died. Anytime I have to have an X-ray through out the years the Dr's. and Radiology Techs. get alarmed and ask me this stupid question..." do you know you have had a broke neck?" The location and the severity of the break I SHOULD BE DEAD.  I pity those who hate on God. When they hate on us it is He who they are hating on.|`|AA10514893	First off, let me say that I have always believed in God and Jesus , since I can ever remember,,,,,,but have only seriously been with faith for the last approx. 10 years.  I have always asked for protection, not only from evil spirits but from any criminal activity as well.    One night, very late, I had to go to the main post office, to mail something.  Well, I saw these four guys standing on the street corner but didn't think twice about it.  I was the only car in the parking lot and the only person at the post office at that time of night.   When I came back out of the post office, those four guys were in the parking lot and walking straight at me.  There was nothing else in my vicinity that these guys could have been going for , but me.  Well, you know how fast your brain works and in a millisecond, I thought of God's protection.  Those four guys , literally , stopped in their tracks, turned around, and started walking away from me.  Of course, I got in my car and left as quickly as I could.  What did they see that made them turn around, I do not know.  Believe what you will, but I have always thought they saw an angel or who knows standing or floating behind me.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	I don't just believe in miracles - I depend on them. My life is full of miracles, too many to tell.     If you just google miracles you would get your fill of them surely.     There is this fantastic miracle of  a man who died for three days, rigor mortis having set in already. Nope, not talking about Jesus, even if the Season we are in is so apt.    This guy is Stanley Villacencio in the Philippines. Praying to Jesus as the Divine Mercy, whose Feast is this coming Sunday, the first Sunday after Easter.     If you say, bullshit! Then know this: his case is documented by the hospital where he died, after excessive bleeding in a weird phenomenon they could not explain. The hospital attendants went screaming down the corridors when he woke up in his coffin. The doctor who was in charge of his case, a non-believer in anything, was so shaken, he resigned and became a priest.     The Philippines government believed in it as it was in all the newspapers, so that now, they promoted stopping work every day, in a nation-wide programme, to say the Divine Mercy prayers at 3 p.m. as Jesus requested.    You can read all about it at    Divine Mercy Miracles   http://our.homewithgod.com/divinemercy/m...    Remember, if you want to read about miracles, at least look out for a date when it happened, where it happened, real names of those who saw it or experienced it, and if their mental health has been assessed.     Those sweetie stories being passed around by e-mail cannot be believed because they read like someone made them up. And the author of these accounts didn't admit to them either.    Here's a website on miracles too. Miracles by John Hardon    http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/...     Especially that of the Miraculous Medal which you can buy in any Catholic bookstall and wear, giving stories like this one:    http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/...    Look up all the websites for the apparitions of Mother Mary, including the one that is on-going (happening right now) at http://www.medjugorje.org   You can try fatima.org, and lourdes.org and .. voila! Even the Coptic church and the Muslims have this one in Egypt:    http://members.chello.nl/~l.de.bondt/Zei...    In the days when Jesus was on earth, he worked miracles. He shows his presence again in our day and age, with the same miracles.    You can trust the God who created the Universe and is the author of all scientific laws to suspend them when He wills.|`|BY4u3kQtaa	When i was a teenager myself and 2 friends were walking to my house at night after running up to the store for some soda and stuff. On the way back about 2 blocks from my house, a guy puts a gun in my face and tells me to give him my wallet, I said "No" and he pulled the trigger....*click* nothing happened. He pulled again *click* nothing happened. My friends came out of shock and jumped the guy and held him while a neighbor called the police.

Q4ssIJwuaa	A maior prova de insanidade do chefe da igreja do imprio romano  se declarar igual a Pedra Angular, j que seu apstolo Pedro declarou com muita clareza que ele n?o  o Filho de D-us, est escrito: "esse Yeshua(Jesus) Pedra que vs edificadores  rejeitaram tornou-se a Pedra Angular.

N?o sei que milagres limitados s?o esses. Milagre  milagre n?o pode ter limita??o.    Olha s essa:  Voltei de uma viagem que fiz ao RJ a servi?o e aqui nas redondezas s o que falavam era do milagre que tinha acontecido com uma amiga nossa que estava quase cega.  Ela n?o enxergava direito e tinha vindo um pastor, n?o sei de onde, e esse pastor era milagreiro. Nos cultos dele vrias pessoas eram curadas.   Pois bem, essa amiga nossa foi ao culto e aps o culto ela disse estar enxergando perfeitamente. Eu pensei comigo: Agora eu me converto a essa religi?o. Vou ter que dar meu bra?o a torcer. O marido dela no outro dia me contou a fa?anha todo animado. E eu pensando: , agora n?o tenho pra onde correr.  Passando uns dias o assunto que estava na boca de todo mundo, era s no que falavam parou derrepente.  Ningum mais falava nada. Eu tambm n?o perguntei nada.   Semana retrasada esse meu amigo me disse que ia pedir uns dias de licen?a para cuidar da esposa que havia sido operada da vista. Ela n?o tinha sarado coisa nenhuma, foi tudo coisa da cabe?a dela a dita melhora.|`|QebGccXJaa	N?o.

Milagres sempre aconteceram por a.  H milagres na igreja Universal (que alis  de seu cunhado Edir), na Deus  amor com o Davi Miranda, e at na igreja romana.  O Senhor Jesus disse que isso iria acontecer: - Porque surgir?o falsos cristos e falsos profetas, e far?o t?o grandes sinais e prodgios que, se possvel fora, enganariam at os escolhidos. Mateus 24:24   A obra de Deus n?o  apenas baseada em milagres, mas em frutos do Esprito Santo e nos ensinamentos que o Senhor Jesus passou a seus discpulos e chegaram at nossos dias.  Os milagres impressionam, mas  existem mais sinais que provam que  a obra de Deus verdadeira na terra, veja Marcos 16:16 em diante e I Corintios 14:24.|`|GH01a6Jqaa	Um estudo da Bblia revela vrias diferen?as cruciais entre as curas relatadas na Bblia e as relatadas pelos curandeiros atuais. Jesus e seus discpulos, por exemplo, nunca cobraram por suas curas. De gra?a recebestes, de gra?a dai, ensinou Jesus. (Mateus 10:8) Assim, eles seguiram o exemplo de Eliseu, que n?o aceitou uma ddiva de um homem chamado Naam?, a quem curara de lepra. (2?Reis 5:1,?14-16) Portanto, quando os curandeiros cobram por seus servi?os, eles violam este precedente bblico.     tambm digno de nota que as curas realizadas nos tempos bblicos eram, quer instantaneas, quer realizadas dentro de um curto perodo de tempo. Quando o apstolo Pedro viu um homem coxo desde a madre de sua m?e, ele lhe disse: Em nome de Jesus Cristo, o nazareno, anda! O relato revela: As solas dos.?.?. ps [do coxo] e os ossos dos seus tornozelos foram instantaneamente feitos firmes; e, pulando, p?s-se em p, e come?ou a andar. (Atos 3:1-8) Leia outros exemplos em Atos 5:15,?16 e 14:8-10.    Nem os profetas de Deus, nem Jesus, e tampouco os discpulos de Jesus, tiveram alguma vez de dar a desculpa de que, o doente n?o foi curado porque n?o tinha f.  verdade que a falta de f talvez tivesse limitado o nmero de pessoas que se apresentaram para ser curadas. Mas, no caso dos que se apresentaram, ocorreu sempre uma cura completa! ?Marcos 6:5,?6.    Realmente, em alguns casos foram curadas pessoas a quem obviamente faltava f. Naam?, o chefe do exrcito srio, por exemplo, n?o cria plenamente que poderia ser curado de sua lepra da maneira como lhe fora prescrita pelo profeta Eliseu. S depois de curado  que ele admitiu: Ora, eis que sei ao certo que n?o h Deus em parte alguma da terra a n?o ser em Israel. (2?Reis 5:11-13,?15) Assim, as frgeis desculpas dos curandeiros se tornam totalmente infundadas.    Por fim, a Bblia adverte que o prprio Satans persiste em transformar-se em anjo de luz, na tentativa de enganar. (2?Corntios 11:14) Em 2?Tessalonicenses 2:9,?10, Paulo explicou adicionalmente: A presen?a daquele que  contra a lei  segundo a opera??o de Satans, com toda obra poderosa, [toda a sorte de milagres, A Bblia de Jerusalm] e sinais e portentos mentirosos, e com todo engano injusto para com os que est?o perecendo. Portanto, acautele-se! A cura pela f muitas vezes envolve poderes demonacos! Eu n?o quero que vos torneis parceiros dos dem?nios, advertiu Paulo. N?o podeis estar bebendo o copo de Jeov e o copo de dem?nios. ?1?Corntios 10:20,?21.|`|omNzUApkaa	Se fosse mentira a Rede Globo ja teria enviado uma pessoa pra fazer uma reportagem e desmascar-lo pq a Rede Globo detesta os evanglicos, a persegui??o religiosa  muito clara e a respeito do assunto, s?o muitas pessoas, n tem como ele ter o controle de todas que receberam a cura caso ele fosse um charlat?o, isso claro se ja n mandaram e comprovaram que era verdade.

God is holy, eternal, perfect, love. God loves us all and wants us all to go to heaven to be with Him forever after we die. But, we aren't perfect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, to be a model of how to live  in this world and to be the sacrifice for our sins . We need to accept Jesus into our life to be a born-again Christian. When we do that, we receive God's blessing and guidance, forgiveness and protection plus go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever, In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing.  God bless.|`|aCdya2qkaa	Chas follow your heart and soul.

How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah. They either claim that all men are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination.  Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that Allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation. False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!  Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India. He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of worship. Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be God and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.   By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear. As God said in the Our'aan:  " That which you worship besides Him are only names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority: The command belongs only to Allah:  He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understand ".  (Soorah Yoosuf 12:40)  It may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow. The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the the Quran:  " I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me " (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)  Consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man.  The following criteria can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the Quran) as words of God:  1. Rational Teachings: Since our Creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish the TRUTH from falsehood. True, undistorted revelation from God must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.   2. Perfection: Since our Creator is all perfect, His revelation must be perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity of versions. It should be free from contradictions in its narration.   3. No Myths or Superstitions: True revelation is free from myths or superstitions that degrade the dignity of our Creator or man himself.   4. Scientific: Since our Creator is the Creator of all knowledge, true revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at all times.   5. Factual Prophecy: Our Creator is the Knower of the past, present and future. Thus His prophecies in His revelation will be fulfilled as prophesied.   6. Inimitable By Man: True revelation is infallible and cannot be imitated by man. God's true revelation is a Living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove for themselves its authenticity or veracity.  read these books:  1- Dr. Maurice Bucaille is a french scientist converted to Islam and write this book "The Bible,The Qur'an & Science" it is amazing book you can download it here http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/The_...  2- Dr. Gary Miller is a scientist also converted to islam he wrote this book "Amazing Quran" you can download it here   http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/Amaz...  3- Dr. zakir Naik wrote this fantastic book it show you the truth  "Concept of GOD in major religions" you can download it here  http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/GOD_...  http://www.islamreligion.com/ provide live help (online) by chat you can ask any question you want about Islam|`|YK3fJSCHaa	join the Islam  english.islamway.com  www.islamhouse.com        note: i m muslim  may i help u|`|AA10066888	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|`|roimOz0Jaa	ARE YOU SERIOUSLY LEAVING THIS UP TO RANDOM PEOPLE TO ANSWER!!?!??!?!??!?!? okay for one its not really there decision and two it really is totally up to you obviously your to blatantly stupid to understand you dont have to be religious and most people only find religion becuase they need a crutch or its what there parents believe.|`|1LTvtdnHaa	I am a Christian and Jesus is my Savior.

qgMnPuBpaa	You and I are alike, I have a ghost who warned me about my favorite aunbts death 2 days before she passed away, i shouldve takin it seriously and went to visit her before she passed on. I get these realistic veiws of things as preminitions. You can tell if they are premonitions rather than reality. My abilities rotate all the time, sometimes I am psychic through dreams, feelings, dejavu, thoughts and you name it, so now I can never really tell if if they are premonitions anymore.

Do you mean a Psychic Medium who can see dead people, or a psychic who can tell fortunes?? Or both...??  Because EVERYTHING is made of energy and are we, it is a case of having the same vibration that souls have. This means raising our vibration to the same level.  Also for a psychic who can see the future your vibration is raised to that of the person who's forward energy you can see.  You would know in many different ways... but the main two..    You would know things were going to happen before they do, I advise people to keep a book on this to watch how many of your thoughts would actually happen.  And for contacting the dead, you would see, hear, smell or feel spirit around. Because we all have this talent, and we just don't know it, you can go on to train, here in the Uk (don't know where your from sorry) we actually have courses available online, just search for one in your area.

Some to pride, some to profanity, some to hate, some to idolatry, some to spiritism, murder, theft, adultery,  drunkenness... etc.    Whilst everyone could commit the sin of spiritism, some are particularly drawn to it as you are suggesting you may be.    Psycic 'powers' are a turning to powers that are not of God and indeed are opposed to God but they are particularly dangerous since by your consent they can gain a power over you and bring you into a bondage.    You really do not know what you may be touching.

Female drivers tend to be at one extreme or the other.    That's partly to do with the way roads are organised.  Lanes, signs, maps and priorities are boys games.  It's also to do with why women drive.  Professional drivers tend to be better than people doing the school run (something to do with having a car full of kids).  Women professional drivers are just as good as men, but more men do it.  Men on the school run are just as awful as women, but more women do it.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	No, it's not a gender thing there are good and bad in both sexes.|`|FrZkfexqaa	I think you who say  it's been proven better go back and check your "proven" records, that's why in at least the United States boys have higher premiums then girls, why do you think that is?

I'm not saying I agree either way, I personally think it depends on the person, but if you want my opinion since the cell phone craze I think it's pretty even I see just as many boys talking on there ***** box and not paying attention to the road as I see girls, and I'm a woman and I"ve never ever put my make-on while I was driving: my lipstick as a passenger yes, but never at the wheel, and I can't tell you how many guys when I was younger that loved to race other guys with there little sports cars, I don't ever re-call my girlfriends and I on a friday night saying " hey ya think we can get some chicks to go and race?"  yeah I didn't think so, maybe Danika Patrick, but I'm pretty sure she stayed on course!!!|`|7jM9Ghchaa	of course we are?|`|VncSMLMpaa	I think women do not take quite so many rash decisions or want to race like some men.

YS3E6Pz2aa	For the most part, gay relationships aren't different.  It's pretty much just the sex that's different, and not even that! Straight people have anal and oral sex too.   I don't think my relationship is any different than a straight couple's.  I still argue with my girlfriend over who pays the check at dinner, I get a little jealous when other girls hit on her, and I spend as much time as I can figuring out small ways to make her happy.  I was nervous when she took me home to meet her mother.  We talk about what we'll name our children and how many we want.  We talk about the future, where we want to live, where we want our careers to go.  We still hold hands in public and steal kisses in the line for coffee.  We talk about getting another puppy and we talk about what our wedding will be like.  We watch tv and cuddle on the couch and make fun of the weather man because he looks so happy telling us about all the cold weather we will be having.  It's wonderfully boring and normal.  -Sam|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	It depends on how you look at it...and mines sucked =( i'm back 2 girls 4 now|`|BD8O7RR3aa	hmm - you tell me:    I am a lesbian:    I go home to my girlfriend  we make dinner  we watch tv  we play wii  we go to bed  on the weekends we hang out with friends...    nothing to crazy different from straight people huh?|`|grYkoDaraa	the only difference is that in a straight one there is a man and a woman and in a gay one there is either two men or two women.   haven't had a first relationship yet.|`|zVzFrgTHaa	i think its pretty much the same, on how you look at it.  my first relationship lasted 3 years. it ended because she was a *****, but i cheated on her and dont regret it. but we had a good run.|`|AA11589320	Yes.    In having a gay relationship the people involved don't receive the same social support and recognition that a straight couple do.

I did read one that said that he had, like, eight removed. I know that something like that might irritate me enough to migrate somewhere else. Or, it could be a non-Y!A thing. Some of his questions gave me the impression that he was struggling with something or was upset by something. I hope he's okay. He seemed like a cool person.

W0rcm3awaa	I think the term Karma is often miscontrued in the west as a 'an eye for an eye' concept, or more physical. For example if you steal something and then later on something is stolen from you, most westerners would equate this as karma when in reality its more irony than anything.    Karma is an internal thing and could actually be compared to the christian soul (although they are different things i think explaining it this way makes it a bit more clear) The idea with Karma, much like a soul, is that if you do bad things it causes bad karma (or weighs down your soul) and if you do good things you get good karma (or your soul is lighter).    Then when we die Karma, much like a soul, determines what happens nexts. However what happens next does vary in each religion. Hopefully this makes sense to you, have a good day!|`|vvCMZkgiaa	In a nutshell + easy to understand manner for newbies,  karma = reward/punishment for your thoughts/deeds/words    So, if you do something good, you will get good karma and vice versa.

Through the law of karma, the effects of all deeds actively create past, present, and future experiences, thus making one responsible for one's own life, and the pain and joy it brings to him/her and others. The results or 'fruits' of actions are called karma-phala. In religions that incorporate reincarnation, karma extends through one's present life and all past and future lives as well."|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	karma is the effect that comes from the cause of attachment and ignorance.  it is a very specific kind of ignorance. it is ignorance about the fact that the true nature of everything is that everything is interconnected.  like a blanket of jewels, where each jewel is reflected in every other jewel.  when we forget that, we get attached to things and people and outcomes, because we think that things are separate.   that attachment creates a cycle of cause and effect. that cycle is what causes us to be reborn, instead of achieving liberation.    karma is the law of cause and effect. we are who we are because of previous causes. everything in buddhism is about cause and effect.    there is no such thing as good karma. all karma is attachment, all karma is bad, all karma keeps you tethered to the physical world.    and non-attachment doesn't mean being cold or unfeeling. it means that you can't really possess anything, and you can't really lose anything, because we're all part of one interconnected system.    the what-goes-around-comes-around view of karma is based on western christian morality, and isn't really accurate. at best, it's an oversimplification.

The bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. You were born with sin. and separated from God. But God didn't leave anyone in that state. He sent His son Jesus to died on the cross to take that sin and every sin you will ever commit away from you that you will never be judged for them again. The thing is, in order to receive that peace you must put your faith and trust in Jesus death and what He did for you on the cross. So according to the bible yes you deserve hell and its up to you, to not go there. Its your choice. Ask God to forgive you and start living for Him. Pray read a bible go to church and serve others. This has to be a heart thing not a act of deceit. God knows His own. God can not be fooled. So be serious and accept Jesus as your savior. Its what the Bible says not me. The bible is God's word.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Nah.

If peace is your motive in life, then I don't see what anyone would have to worry about.  Being nice to those who oppose you eventually leads to peace.      So, what's the cat's name?    Ironically, when I was an Atheist I had a cat.  His name was Macaroni.  I miss our bonding moments.  Saturday nights were the only time in college that I had the house to myself.  My roommates always headed out of town for the weekend.  I'd give Macaroni some catnip while I drank a beer and shared pizza with him.  Aw, the good old days.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You do deserve some punishment for mocking God as if He had to answer for the stupid people that talk in His Name.

From what I understand being in denial or having ignorance does not exempt me. Just as ignorance of the law doesn't protect me from receiving judgment in a court of law.    So it would seem to come to what do you really believe?   Are you sure enough about what you believe to bet your life on it?    For me I felt that their had to be more to life than that you exist and then you die.  I just wanted to know the truth and I was not invested in what I thought the truth should be. I did not care what the truth was I just wanted the truth. I was not interested in a concept an idea or a system of beliefs that could or would change due to an increase in knowledge. What I learned is that when I was serious about finding out if God was real He revealed Himself to me in real and tangible ways that I can never deny. As a result I am no longer who I was and life today has purpose and meaning.     I encourage you to go to the source and find out for yourself what the truth is and not depend upon your own wisdom or the conjecture of others. If God is real then He is big enough for you to ask Him if He really exists.
xyIZv6iiaa	I thought this was very interesting in view - so I started by looking up the definition of ethnicity -     "Definitions of what constitutes an 'ethnic group' or an 'ethnic minority' are subject to much discussion. In fact, there is no consensus on what constitutes an 'ethnic group' and the terminology used to describe these groups has changed significantly over time.     This is because membership of any ethnic group is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and can be based upon a combination of categories such as:    country of birth   nationality   language spoken at home   parents' country of birth in conjunction with country of birth   skin colour   national/geographical origin   racial group   religion "  http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/ethni...    notice religion is one of the categories used to define ethnicity.    I would have said no, but based on this if one was LDS (religion) and was born in an area predominantly LDS (nationality) and came from an LDS family (parents...)and could define three or more LDS specific word/phrase/abbreviations ------then I guess yes.     Oh my Gosh!  I am LDS ethnic!|`|jdRKZe18aa	Interesting concept - had never thought of that before or looked at it that way.  Don't think most mormons DO - but if you follow your noted definition I guess we could be at that huh? : )|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	hmm, interesting perspective...

Mormons are from all over the world.  Over 1/2 of the members are outside the USA now.  Also, we have more adult converts each year then children being born into a Mormon home.|`|JWjlyztBaa	I consider it to have grown into a distinct culture.  I wouldn't call it an ethnic group however.  For those of us who are 5th or 6th generation Mormon, Mormonism is the dogma, but Mormon culture encompasses the History, traditions, myths, folklore, music, schisms and so forth.  It is precisely because of this, that it is so hard for some people to just leave them alone when they stop believing in the dogma.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Yes.  In fact in the church we have to be sure we do not become complacent and keep within ourselves and belief system.  What does us good is continuous reminders that to be healthy we must go out into society, try to spread the gospel, seek and make friends not members and not just to convert them.    It is comfortable to be within the group.  But the Jews had the same problem:    Titus 2:14   14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.   1 Pet 2:9   9 But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:   Ex 19:5   5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth [is] mine:  Deut 14:2   2 For thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that [are] upon the earth.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	I used to be a Mormon, and I have always lived in the UK.  We used to get the missionaries come over to our wards for a bit, often they'd be British, occasionally other europeans (there are more and more of these all the time, sadly), and mostly they'd be American.  Amongst the Americans, even, you could easily tell the Utah ones from the non-Utah ones (some of the Californian ones seem a little Utah-like, to be fair) so there is a strong argument that an element of Mormonism has become a culture as much as a religion.  But certainly not all of it.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	I don't know the answer to your question but I do applaud you asking it, it is perhaps the first "real" question I've ever seen in almost 3 years and 2 months of using yahoo answers|`|AA10410743	I don't consider Mormons to be an ethnicity. I think we are too young for that. This dispensation of the church is not even 200 years old yet. I think it took thousands of years for the Jewish people to begin to consider themselves an ethnicity, and from my own perspective that only began when some religious Jews ceased to be religious. I'm not sure how that would work within the LDS culture. Usually Mormons who don't believe in the LDS religion anymore do one of two things, go inactive, or have their names removed from the records of the church. In both cases,most do not want to have anything to do with anything Mormon related (except possibly by a small minority, some may want to remain in contact with their family). Although some who are inactive come back (I did), it can be difficult, and my thought is that you either are a religious Mormon or you don't associate yourself as a Mormon.    To me, to be considered both a religion and an ethinic group (where one but not necessarily the other exist), requires a lot of time (thousands of years), and changes in the basic premise of the religious doctrine.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	Personally, no; though I can see why it would be suggested.  If we were considered an ethnicity, I wouldn't have any particular problem with that, I just don't view us in that way.    But I guess it depends on one's definition.  If you take the genetic/ancestral component out of the definition, then perhaps so.    But even if you do take out the ancestral component, there's one aspect of Mormonism, however, that still keeps from from referring Mormons as an ethnic group: the way our membership grows.  When I think of ethnic groups, I think of growth through bloodlines, through successive generations, like the Jews (yes, one can convert to Judiasm, but bloodlines is still very important to them).  To me that's why Jews might be considered an ethnic group and Mormons not.  We have no geographic/genetic/cultural barriers; anyone can join us.  In my mind, this keeps me from viewing Mormons as an ethnic group.  Mormons definitely have a distinct culture, or sub-culture if you will, but to me that's not enough to be an ethnicity.    I'd like to see other opinions though.|`|QDM3Y28laa	Well, I am Japanese/French/German and Mormon.  And my ward has a lot of Spanish people and a few Western African members.  And I know a lot of Polynesians who are Mormon...  So I don't think so.|`|AA10031161	Mormonism as an ethnicity? Uh, not by a long shot. Isn't ethnicity about genetics and region of origin?    Although... from the more modern definition you provide, we may just qualify.    I am well aware we are a peculiar people. That's a fun word to look up- it doesn't just mean odd or different, although those descriptors do apply. It can also imply ownership, as we are peculiar to God, in a sense, we belong to Him.    Actually, that new definition is kinda cool! In a race-obsessed world, at least something is becoming less wrapped up in genetics and appearance.|`|zQyslfHKaa	That would seem tough on face value considdering all the Samoans in Salt Lake.

I love listening to Utah accents, I miss the mountains, I don't smoke or drink, even coffee. I'm fascinated with my genealogy and the things my ancestors did in the church. I am careful in my speech.    I just can't swallow the doctrine anymore.|`|yakmXr5Jaa	I think it's important that Mormonism NOT become an ethnicity.    One of the challenges Mormon missionaries always face is learning what not to ask people to change.  Yes, it's good for people to accept Christ's gospel.  But you have to teach them Christ's gospel without mixing in culture.    When someone joins the Mormon church, they always make changes in their life based on Mormon teachings.  They stop smoking or drinking.  They have to marry their live-in girlfriend.  Things they didn't think were wrong, but when they accept the gospel they accept the fact that God wants them to change certain things in their life.    So missionaries teach a person "You shouldn't drink coffee", but lots of times they also end up telling a person, "You shouldn't use so much profanity."  And a missionary that has grown up in the church often thinks all kinds of things are related to the gospel, just because they have been told it was right or wrong all their lives.  Like "You shouldn't eat right before bed, because it's bad for your digestion."  Sure, maybe that's true, but it's not part of the gospel.  It's just what that kid's mother taught him.    People should maintain their heritage and "sociological traits".  When someone in Tokyo becomes a Mormon, they should keep their Japanese ethnicity and not become Americanized by the American missionaries.  When a black person joins the church, they should keep their blackness, even if the rest of their congregation is mostly white.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	I agree with P. Hurlburt.  This is how I see it. The Mormon church *molds* the members. It molds the youth, through classes and through the way it expects the parents to raise and influence their children. IMO...General conference is molding the members. Talking to them like little children.     The LDS church molds converts too, but does not have quite the head start as those born and raised in the religion.  These are people that are taught, people need to be successful in their efforts if they ever hope to attain exaltation.    Salvation?  They are programmed to analize the difference between, general salvation and individual exaltation. That is the mentality the leaders want. To believe in a sense of religious supremacy. IMHO.   This kind of changes that way you present yourself is you daily life. You get nice upstanding people from it.   BUT...      Take the Brigham Young mentality+ a goody better than you attitude+Rules that Must be followed+ the us VS them factor = (the average, NOT every) modern day temple attending mormon.    **This plus a central location= a "peculiar" people.

UmjJmYsjaa	Some have identified this symbolic harlot with ancient Rome. But Rome was a political power. This harlot commits fornication with the kings of the earth, and this evidently includes the kings of Rome. Besides, after her destruction, the kings of the earth are said to mourn her passing. Therefore, she cannot be a political power.    Rev 18:9 - "And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived in shameless luxury will weep ..."    Additionally, since she is mourned also by the worlds merchants, she could not picture big business.     Rev 18:15 - "The traveling merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of [their] fear of her torment and will weep and mourn, ..."    However, we read, however, that by her spiritistic practice all the nations were misled.     Rev 18:23 - "..., for by your spiritistic practice all the nations were misled."     This makes it clear that the great harlot must be a worldwide religious entity.    Which religion? Well since it says all the nations , this gives a clear indication that it is not just one religion but a lot of them as one entity. She is, in fact, the entire world empire of false religion. Her origin in the mysteries of Babylon is shown in that many Babylonish doctrines and practices are common to religions around the earth. For example, belief in the inherent immortality of the human soul, in a hell of torment, and in a trinity of gods is to be found in most Oriental religions as well as in the sects of Christendom. False religion, spawned more than 4,000 years ago in the ancient city of Babylon, has developed into the modern monstrosity that is called, appropriately, Babylon the Great.    About the wild Beast Rev 17:10, and 11 will give you the answer  Revelation 17:10,11 - And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet arrived, but when he does arrive he must remain a short while. 11?And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also itself an eighth [king], but springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction.    The beasts represent Kings and Kingdoms. The Five kingdoms meantined there are the ones that has some impact with Gods people the Isrealites. Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persian Empire, Greek Empire, those are the 5. The one that is, is the Roman Empire, because when the Apsotle John wrote this in 90AD the roman empire was the One. And so the Seventh and Eight Kingdom will come from the Roman Empire as said by Daniel in his Second Chapter. The Seventh Kingdom that has World power is the Anglo American world Power, also Known as the British Empire and The United States. You cant deny that they dont have world power. The Eight Kingdom comes from the Seventh. The Eight kingdom is the United Nations unify all the Nations .  Rev 17:8 - And when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present, those who dwell on the earth will wonder admiringly  The United Nations is designed to act like a kingdom with Laws and Military for but is not, and that will be present when the Seventh Kingdom is still active  The Beasts are the Nations.

But in a nutshell the Beast is identified as the kings of the earth collectively all in one...    ...And the harlot represents religions that teach false doctrines and teachings of demons....    The teachings are different among different "Christian" faiths but truthfully here is some things that the Harlot is not...she's not an actual harlot thats going to influence the entire world by fornicating with everyone....    The Beast isn't an actual Beast that will rise from the sea...good example to remember is the visions that Prophet Daniel saw where each "Beast" that came out of the sea represented a coming powerful kingdom like the Winged Lion represented the nation of Babylon....and The Winged Leopard with four heads represented the nation of Greece...so the Wild Beast of Revelation represents something of the sort...    Here are two links: ( I know people hate reading links but hey I do it and its a good way to be well informed of both sides of the coin)    The information regarding the Wild Beast: http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040401/art...

The beast has seven heads and ten horns. (Revelation 17:1-4) Whom does the harlot represent? She exerts influence over the kings of the earth. She dresses in purple, uses incense, and is exceedingly wealthy. In addition, by means of her spiritistic practice, all the nations are misled. (Revelation 17:18; 18:12, 13, 23) The Bible helps us to see that this harlot is a worldwide religious entity. She depicts, not any one religion, but all religions that produce rotten fruit.    The beast that the harlot rides pictures the worlds political powers.* (Revelation 17:10-13) False religion straddles the back of this political beast, attempting to influence its decisions and to control its direction.    Soon, though, an amazing event will take place. The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire. (Revelation 17:16) In a sudden, shocking move, the worlds political powers will turn on false religion and completely destroy her! What will prompt this action? The Bible book of Revelation answers: God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought. (Revelation 17:17) Yes, God will call false religion to account for all the despicable acts she has committed in his name. In a stroke of perfect justice, he will use her political paramours as his instrument of execution.    What must you do if you do not want to share the fate of false religion? Get out of her, my people, urges Gods messenger. (Revelation 18:4) Indeed, now is the time to flee from false religion!     The Bible book of Daniel sheds much light on the meaning of symbolic beasts. Chapter 7 contains a vivid tableau of "four huge beasts"a lion, a bear, a leopard, and a fearsome beast with big teeth of iron. (Daniel 7:2-7) Daniel tells us that these beasts represent "kings," or political kingdoms, that rule in succession over vast empires.Daniel 7:17, 23.    Regarding the beast of Revelation 13:1, 2, The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible points out that it "combines in itself the joint characteristics of the four beasts of Daniel's vision . . . Accordingly, this first beast [of Revelation] represents the combined forces of all political rule opposed to God in the world." This observation is affirmed by Revelation 13:7, which says of the beast: "Authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."*    Why does the Bible use beasts as symbols of human rulership? For at least two reasons. First, because of the beastly record of bloodshed that governments have accrued over the centuries. "War is one of the constants of history," wrote historians Will and Ariel Durant, "and has not diminished with civilization or democracy." How true that "man has dominated man to his injury"! (Ecclesiastes 8:9) The second reason is that "the dragon [Satan] gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority." (Revelation 12:9; 13:2) Accordingly, human rulership is a product of the Devil, thus reflecting his beastly, dragonlike disposition.John 8:44; Ephesians 6:12.    This does not mean, however, that every human ruler is a direct tool of Satan. Indeed, in one sense, human governments serve as "God's minister," giving structure to human society, without which chaos would rule. And some leaders have protected fundamental human rights, including the right to engage in true worshipsomething that Satan does not want. (Romans 13:3, 4; Ezr 7:11-27; Acts 13:7) Still, because of the Devil's influence, no human or human institution has ever been able to bring lasting peace and security to the people.  John 12:31.

The quran tells us "god" wants something else from us, so which is right?  Or both?  Or none?      You're absolutely right, by the way -- the bible "miracles" can't be explained by science.  Which means, absent any real evidence other than a book of fables, that they never happened.    No, Josephus doesn't mention jesus -- the mention of jesus was added at a later date by christians trying to prove his existence.  This is a well-documented fraud, and is accepted as a fact by all honest christian scholars.    Reading about miracles in a book doesn't mean you've "witnessed evidence."  It means you've read a book.  Magic things happen in the Harry Potter books -- does that mean they're real?  Of course not.  Neither are the bible stories real.      Besides, your own bible makes all sorts of promises of things god will do:  you'll get anything you ask for from god if you have faith, you can (literally) move mountains, you can do miralces, etc.  Yet there are no such things going on today, ever.  So there are only two possibilities:  nobody today has faith, or nobody ever could do those things because there's no god.    Try some education, it'll help with your critical thinking skills.    Peace.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Because you're the ones saying Christianity is a "truth".    God existing is a "truth".    If it's a truth then there should be evidence to support that.    Otherwise we can assume you're delusional and unable to comprehend that this is nothing more than a relative truth, not an absolute one.    Does it not seem stupid to claim that you're supposed to have "faith" meanwhile your claiming your God is the one and only "true" god?    Edit: Are you aware that there are multiple documentations of mermaids? Does that make them exist? (These writings are found over long periods of years, on different continents as well)|`|YyEEAJBkaa	They do not believe in your god, isnt that obvious to you, by now?|`|JUviY9hoaa	Lol - Yes but other then the bible... where in history does anyone see Jesus?  You can not cite a biased book. Especially the book that is the basis of all Christianity... of course it's pro-Jesus!|`|zkETPA8waa	*Yawns* That's it, Poe's law declares you a troll. Your posts are simply too bloody stupid to be serious.    There's as much 'documentation' for Jesus raising the dead as there is for Dracula raising the undead. Moron.    EDIT: Even if we accep Josephus as legitimate (and generally, he ISN'T accepted as legitimate) there was not a single verification of ANY supernatural events written by someone alive DURING THAT TIME. The first mention of any 'miracles' come over 40 years after Jesus was reputed to have died. In other words, you got squat.|`|BtFbHjHZaa	You act like the Bible is your proof. It can't be proof because no one is still alive to say that GOD wrote it (dicated it).    If you would merely say that you beleive what the Bible says is true, and admit you have no proof that it is real, then we could move on to more meaningful subjects.    If my wife asked for that I would say: FACT, I moved halfway across the world so you can attend school after knowing you for 4 months, I support you financially and emotionally as you try and better our lives.    If that is not love then call it what you will.    "The Bible historically documents people seeing Jesus raising someone from the dead and using his powers to make fish appear to feed the masses."    Lord of the Rings HISTORICALLY documents people seeing two mighest with hairy feet running into mordor to destroy a ring, but yet you do not believe it is real.    PS, the words DOCUMENTED imply a FACT, yes you can't have FACTS from the bible.    We won't brush off evidence, Were just waiting for you to provide us with some|`|WalnRzfGaa	The ONLY place this is DOCUMENTED is in the Bible, Which is what we are asking for proof of. please PROVE to us that it is accurate and NOT the work of a man.    thank you.    Edit   Josephus was not born until at least 100 years after Jesus was supposed to have died. not the best source for accurate information.|`|WcxrnINvaa	The NT was written several generations after Christ, so those miracles were stories handed down by word of mouth not documented by eye witnesses.  Probably why you need faith since the evidence is so flimsy.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	This is a very confused post.  You decry atheists because they ask for evidence, then you try to provide some, then you say it isn't really evidence after all.    If it were the case that "the Bible historically documents people seeing Jesus raising someone from the dead", you would have a strong case.  Can you really not see that the word "historically" is completely question-begging in this context?  The Bible tells a story.  Does that make it historical?  Hardly.  It proves at best that people were prepared to believe that Jesus was the sort of person who, if he had wanted to, could have raised someone from the dead.  Without further independent testimony that's as far as you can go.    I agree that atheists are wrong in their insistence on evidence, because they think that religious statements are on a par with scientific theories or hypotheses.  But they aren't; they are expressions of commitment, declarations of intent to live by a certain code.  The only "proof" you can provide is that living in the Christian way "works", whatever that means: makes you happy, motivates you to help other people, stops you wasting your life, makes you part of a community of people who value each other regardless of social status, achievement, income or IQ and who offer one another unconditional mutual support.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Could it be 'cause we aren't stupid?|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I ask for evidence because he didn't give me faith and as for food appearing out of thin air ...  I'm still waiting to see the manna from heaven feed the starving children of this world.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	your beyond ignorant|`|8Iqci2tNaa	I trust what i can see.|`|Z0I5Qvk7aa	Just because something is documented doesn't mean it isn't exaggerated, or just completely fabricated. When I say I need evidence, I need evidence that I can see. Not from a book.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	It seems you worship a book more than a god.  Faith is (often) a mind killer.  The bible has been rewritten many times, it is not a reliable source of history.  I ask for evidence because reality is very important to me.  I won't settle for what sounds good or promises that cannot be investigated.|`|4sUek7ugaa	You think God wants you to have faith?  Isn't it more likely that the church pushes faith because it knows it can't produce any evidence?    Your question contradicts itself.  First you say God wants us to have faith and not ask for evidence, then you claim he produced evidence for us.  Which is it?  Do you think we're supposed to have faith or believe the stories of miracles?    If you accept the "documentation" of stories passed on orally for decades before they were written down, you must also accept similar documentation of miracles from other religions.  After all, their case is just as well-supported as yours is.  Why should someone believe your stories but not those of other religions?|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Because atheists do not have any faith.|`|mLYFbStGaa	I beg to differ with you on this point.  God also leaves sufficient evidence for His existence which can be logically and intellectually discerned.  Nowhere does the bible command "blind faith".  If it were so, the bible would not say the following:    Rom 1:20  For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,   Rom 1:21  because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.       I believe you do Christianity a disservice by insisting people believe in God without evidence.  Our faith is based on trusting in the evidence.|`|d265DZbHaa	Because with out evidence any person could tell me to believe in anything, and that is obvious stupidity. I am just applying commonsense to religion.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	FAITH is blind and  I will not stoop down therefore into the darkly splendid world and put my life in the hands of foolery and fairy tale entities. I would rather see TRUTH and insurmountable evidence in fact of being and the evolution of mind, for we have the ability to think with reason and not be swayed by fear.|`|c91032f4386f0b1ceea8747a91b30331aa	God knows what's right for us to do, not people. Heck, if we let people run us over and tell us what is "right" then this world would go down quick. I have seen many miracles during my Christian life time and would not go back for ANYTHING. Have faith, we don't need science to prove anything. Scientists weren't even alive during the "big boom" so how do they know it exists?    :)God bless|`|dcfce3e99b39f77803362d8f96deaa4faa	I think you've taken a few missteps.  One is you're equating faith with trust.  If I ask you why you believe in God, and you respond with "faith" -- you've really only said "I trust God exists because I trust he exists."  This is obviously unsatisfactory to a non-believer.    But then you mention, SOME people have seen evidence and still don't believe.  One, you're obviously relying on the Bible, which is circular ("The Bible is true, it gives this story that proves atheists are irrational").  And two, you've implicitly admitted that some people are convinced by evidence and you've admitted God is willing to supply some people with that evidence.    Lastly, the authorship of the Bible is unknown but most scholars date the writings of the NT to be around 60 AD.  Additionally, Josephus was born after Jesus died.  None of these accounts can be presumed reliable.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	"when God wants us to have faith".  That is the assumption you make with which I dispense.    The rest of your argument is extremely ignorant.  Undoubtedly, you believe it to be wholeheartedly true, and backed by evidence; probably, you've been egged on by unscrupulous creationist propaganda, or you deduced for yourself your opinions to be logical.  Either way, your argument is false.|`|tGkFPA82aa	And yet you can't see how this is your own fault?     If you only accepted that the works of All Father Odin is historically documented, completely true, and that it can not be explained by science, you wouldn't have to deal with people being trained to reject the existence of gods.    But no, Christians are worse then atheists. At least atheists have the balls to deny all gods, and not just 'most' of the ones they don't like.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Edit:  Why bring up Josephus if faith is enough?    Sounds like you may not entirely buy your own argument.    That is,     if faith is all you need, why do you need the Bible?    If faith & the Bible are all you need, why bother with Josephus?    If faith, the Bible, & Josephus are all you need, why didn't Josephus become Christian?|`|FbOkPyEpaa	If there is no God, there's absolutely no reason for faith.|`|saDjgQkxaa	Oh yeah. Who needs evidence to prove something?!      I'm glad that on every episode of Mythbusters, they prey for an explanation....oh wait, Jamie Hnyemen and Adam Savage are atheists.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	Faith is for gullible people.    I could scientifically prove to my wife that I love her.  I would have an MRI or EEG performed while I look at pictures, including pictures of her.  My mental and emotional responses would register when I saw pictures of her, which would be comparable to the brain patterns of others when they see pictures of people or things that they say they love.    Other books historically document people fighting dragons and visiting Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean Harry Potter is a real person.  Those events can be explained using science: someone wrote down some words and authored a fictional story, or exaggerated real events with supernatural "miracles" in order to make a point.    The evidence that has been brushed off was not credible.  Atheists are asking for legitimate evidence, not myths and personal anecdotes.|`|CU6qk70haa	You can't use the bible as prove of biblical beliefs- atheists are above circular logic.|`|cYQnjZDfaa	Define faith, please.    Admit that you didn't get it what you thought.  Try again, sorry.|`|gEOVHZcVaa	you cant use a 2000 yr old book to document anything.  thats like 2000 years from now someone using the neverending story as a bible saying theres a secret book somewhere in the world that takes you to never never land.  plus, who was there to document eve being born out of a rib.  and who documented the great flood?  if you use just a teensy bit of reason and logic youll realize how stupid the bible is.|`|vnWuOLgMaa	The bible was written a long time ago. No one has seen anyone resurect a dead person during the last decade, so... of course they're not going to believe that.    Also, I personally am not certain that the Bible is the Holy word. If you study the history of Christianity, you'll notice that it has been changed countless times, because some people (NOT God, but regular humans), were bothered by certain passages.|`|4yJ4oKF2aa	They ask for evidence because simply saying "I have faith in something" doesn't make it any more believable.|`|exRfWIRKaa	My wife knows that I actually exist...but your god is a completely different story..

And the place of worship, there is a purely pagan worship and that have no basis in truth and not based on the teachings of the Bible, and I was puzzled by Imre any of the communities is the right religion and any religion is right, and I would like to share with you what reached through Qroti in the Bible. and is as follows   The Bible teaches the following   That the Trinity is heresy and pagan Roman Catholic purely   God and one does not have a partner   That Jesus is the Son of God, the living creature and not the Prophet or   The cult of the Red Cross is forbidden   And also the worship of images and statues   Eating pork and drinking alcohol is haram also   And also to recognize the evil of human beings is great as the recognition of the unity of God   And I do not want to go on, but the problem is that all Christians, taking the priests with God and this is the biggest in writing, as all the priests and the popes are not working today in the work of God in their actions and their actions purely satanic.

T8ksKCWCaa	Firstly, you will get few answers from your point of view in this section.  Secondly, if your son does not share your value system at 15 years old, you are too late.  Thirdly, since no laws were broken, you cannot press charges.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Honestly your best bet would have been a "lewd conduct" charge if you had any evidence of the action.  Even then you don't really have a case.  If you had a police officer on hand I'm betting the most (s)he could have done would be to ask them to take it somewhere else/more private.    Other than that get over yourself.  To paraphrase Goonies:  you're wound so tight if you put a lump of coal somewhere specific in your anatomy you would form a diamond within a week.  You can watch the movie if you want the direct quote.  ;)|`|FpMS47sXaa	firstly - get over yourself.    secondly - DEAL with it.    no laws are broken. if you don't like it - that's YOUR problem.|`|ZNE4rdByaa	hahahahaha what exactly are you going to press charges about..?  two men being happy together and expressing it?  because you're disgusted by someone's lifestyle doesn't mean its wrong just means you're close-minded and they haven't done anything wrong  you really should let him discover his opinion about this himself    hahaha oh man you're ridiculous|`|1LxK1Grcaa	HaHa    Lucky for the two loving men YOU CANT DO SH*T    It is not a sin to love someone and show affection to that person in public.  If you don't like it dont look.|`|e0lfV7skaa	He's 15?  And you need to explain the birds and bees to him???  Was he kept under a rock until now??    You cannot press charges.  You'd be laughed out of the police station, but please - be my guest and try.|`|5ypdHLtGaa	you can't press charges. freedom of speech. while i don't think that homosexuality is a sin...i'm not a fan of pda by anyone, gay or straight..you can explain to your son that there is a time and place for everything and making out and other such activities are best done in private.|`|q9H1JmRjaa	Your just jealous because no one wants to kiss you.|`|u3KhqAVvaa	You can't press charges I don't think.    If your son is of faith, and believes in God, then showing homosexuality is a sin isn't difficult.  I'd be glad to help you in that.  If he doesn't believe in God's way about the matter, it won't matter to him.    I can also give you a number of secular reasons that homosexuality is a bad idea if you like.|`|ssWXHoYjaa	Oh my damn, Being gay is not a sin.  and you cant press charges for two men being perfectly happy and wanting to share with others.  Whats the difference between straight people kissing in public than gay people?    Your and ignorant jerk :]|`|ezNSyvqeaa	Im personally against too much PDA in general, but hey if u dont like it dont look.  Im glad that they are confident enough in who they are that they feel free to love eachother in public.
ZNE4rdByaa	only the butch ones do  majority of the femmes don't  thats just a stereotype|`|qHCtBq07aa	Its all just a matter of what people want.   I had short hair once upon a time, and it was so much easier to handle but within a day I was regretting it and now its down to my bra strap and I'm much happier. So it just depends on the person.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	They want to look like a boy. Actually, that's mostly girls who are butch. I don't really like butch women. They are totally turn me off.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Most?  How bout why do some have short hair?  Some have short hair because they like it short.  Just like some straight girls have short hair because they like it.|`|po4j4xhAaa	They don't.  You only see the ones who do because they fit the stereotypes.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	Im lesbian. My hair is loooonnnng and pretty. Go to my profile and see. =]|`|vKvNDPbDaa	the same as why straight girls do, they like it.|`|H7MSxgZ7aa	they kinda act like guys like how gays act l;ike girls|`|AA12110929	That's generalizing. Not all lesbians have short hair. It's just based on preference.|`|cbY6NoHSaa	You look at stereotypical crap alot right?|`|aWPmvPpfaa	those are the only ones you see. just like femmy gay guys, and transexuals that don't pass very well. its just the tip of the lesbian iceburg...:)|`|N86vHKxtaa	I don't.  Granted, shoulder length isn't really that long but it's not "boy" short either.  None of my gal pals have had short hair either although one did say she liked it when it was short because it was easier to wash and dry.  Personal preferences dictate how long my hair is, not my sexuality.|`|T2WJPtSKaa	I'm a lesbian with short hair. I do not want to fit the stereotype, hell...I had short hair before I confirmed myself as a lesbian.    To me, longer hair is harder to care for, and all that pizazz. I'm growing my hair out now because it's really annoying short. >.>|`|rZhGa5VCaa	it is a style, not for lesbos specifically.|`|TqEx117yaa	Because th3 disese makes them into a guy, but with brests! IT NEEDS A CURE!|`|BD8O7RR3aa	what lesbians do you know?      almost every single one i know has hair to their shoulders and longer!|`|Vo6YukG2aa	A lot don't actually.... It's just that the ones with short hair are just easier to notice|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Only the Butch ones do that|`|e5VUwaRsaa	It's part of their identity. It helps them be recognized by other lesbians too.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	well I have short hair because I had to shave my head for a surgery.  I didn't have to but the way they were going to cut it, it would have made me look like a old person balding lol.  It has been about 4 years since the surgery but I kept it short because people said it really opened up my face and it grew back with kinky curls that stayed on my head like a Little curly fro.  But now I am growing my hair back out, because I would like a different look.  so you see not all lesbian have short hair because they want it, but because they have to.|`|27U5NFcuaa	I have short hair because its low maintenance.|`|grYkoDaraa	most don't some do.  its what they want.|`|mxZUt1iMaa	I have medium length hair. My last 2 girl friends have had long hair.  I tried having short hair. It was nice =] Much easier to manage. But I grew it back out. I look more girly with longer hair.|`|AA11589320	I did not know this.      When was this study done?      Who did it?      Did it cover a select section of society (uni students) or did it cover a complete cross section of society?     Did it cover north, south east and west or just a single area?     What other things did they discover.     Are their findings available on line?     If not then where?|`|W545hqrpaa	why do u figure "most" lesbians have short hair. Show me some statistics.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	This "cartoon" as you say, was produced by an ex-communicated Mormon who, with an unrepentant heart and anti Mormon agenda, fabricated many falsehoods and deceptions in this bucolic diatribe against his former faith.    To call it "banned by the Mormon Church" is also a falsehood, as the Mormon Church does not officially "ban " any anti Mormon literature.  We simply ignore it.    Sometimes they are so warped out of proportion it would be hilarious, if it weren't for the fact that many non Mormons come to believe that is what we believe.   Seems anti Mormons are good at deception.  And deception as we know, is the tool of whom...?   Satan.    We are taught by Paul, in the Bible, to seek after things that are pure, virtuous, lovely and of good report.  Things to the contrary, we ignore.|`|NxPPdCSjaa	First, I know of no such thing or any other being banned by the LDS Mormon Church! I watched and listened to the entire thing, some twice! so it must not be banned! I have been a Member for 73 years and attended church today. Now let me tell you about today: It was pretty much a normal Sunday, The service started with prayer, some announcements, a song. This was followed by a Sister, An African American, being confirmed a member of the Church following her Baptism yesterday evening. She was then voted on (Unanimous) to be a member in our ward. Two others that moved to the area were also voted on and accepted into the ward. There were then a couple of speakers, one by "Dark Skinned" man from American Samoa ( for you football fans, he is a first cousin of Via Sikahema) and one by his wife who is not Samoan but white! ( Via BTW served as a Mormon Bishop for 5 years in this area! for those not familiar, he is a former NFL star and now a Sports Anchor and a dark skinned Samoan! Another song , the Sacrament, the Closing Prayer! Not in this exact order but that is the LDS Mormon Sacrament Service. There were in attendance several African Americans and Latinos with whom I spoke as well.    Now back to the Cartoon: Yes it was just a propaganda Cartoon that contained a little truth and a lot of misinterpretations. Then there were some outright lies and completely made up stories! But what would you expect from an "Anti Mormon" group set out to discredit us! This can and is used to discredit many groups religous or Political. That is why it is called propaganda! Church officials are often quoted out of context! Now anyone knows that quotes on anything taken out of context can be completely turned arround to be something different than what was intended.    And Lastly, I have never, Never known of anyone who has been pressuered by the Chuch to get a Divorce! I married a Catholic Girl and was married by a Mormon Bishop! We had many friends in the Church and she later became a very strong Member. She passed away 12 years ago after being married 25 1/2 years. No one asked me or even suggested I not marry her or that I should divorce her! I re married 8 years ago to another Catholic Girl who was widowed. She is still Catholic because of her family (very strong Catholic)  ( Her very Catholic Brother in law who studied for the priesthood at the Vatican was my best man for the wedding) and I understand that! She was  at Church with me today, She makes sure I go and comes with me. No one expects us to get divorced! The Ward members and leadership treat her with the utmost respect. I have been a member of this ward since it was organized 32 years ago! Where do people come up with this? I tell you where, it is people with an axe to grind  have not a grindstone so they fabricate this stuff to try to justify their own actions! Oh, I forgot, they take some of the Teachings of the FLDS and try to pin it on the LDS Mormons. Won't work as they are not the same nor is the RLDS or any of the other renegade groups anymore than the Ex Mormon groups that produced this cartoon! Notice how they had the wife in heaven wiggle her behind! Pure propaganda!    I wonder if the same people would take time to read and study the "Truth"? I have no fear of reading their propaganda because I have the truth!    Edit--for Oceanwoman----You quote the "Mellennial Star" as being a current LDS Mormon Publication when in fact it is not:    Product Code: UP002   Title: Millennial Star Vol. 1-7   Author:    Publisher: Utah Lighthouse Ministry   Price: $80.00   Date: 1840-1846   Pages: 1528   Additional Info: Photocopies of Original Ed.     The Utah Lighthouse ministries is in fact a very Anti Mormon publication and group run by the Late Gerald Tanner and is wife Sandra Tanner! It seems that much of your education comes from that sorce as I read your posts, not from your teaching while a member of the the LDS Church! I hope you read this so I will e mail it as well!        Proud Vet|`|AA11713693	Maybe because some of it or all of the cartoon is not true and that is why the mormons banned it.|`|gRObakpZaa	I don't think there are any Black Mormons.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	The LDS church didn't "ban" this cartoon.      I know lots of black Mormons who love the church and are very satisfied with their membership and understand the history of it.     Why do you tell lies about the Mormon church and tell Black's which churches they can or can't join???|`|7VJcd5YLaa	You are throwing all these things out there without sources - besides the holy grail of the underinformed - youtube.  Really reliable.    And you are saying threatening things about blacks?  I really think you have some issues that are unresolved.    Simple - Mormons did not ban this cartoon.  Blacks - whether LDS or not are protected by the same rights you are and no one deserves to get their butts kicked.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	because cartoon characters are used you call it a cartoon?  all ethnicity's are welcome|`|AA10637643	Who *supposedly* banned it??    And that cartoon is full of bull crap.  Sorry to burst your bubble.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Most of it is very accurate. The statements about many Gods, the battle between Jesus and his supposed brother Lucifer, and blacks were less valiant, all true. But now the LDS church claims the curse of cain were those who did not fight as *much* in the battle pre-life.    IN Mormon scripture: God curses bad races with black skin. See..  2 Nephi 5:21, Alma 3: 6, 3 Nephi 2:14-15, Moses 7:22, Abraham 1:21-24,27 and much more...    Teachings..  From this it is very clear that the mark which was set upon the descendants of Cain was a skin of blackness, and there can be no doubt that this was the mark that Cain himself received; in fact, it has been noticed in our day that men who have lost the spirit of the Lord, and from whom His blessings have been withdrawn, have turned dark to such an extent as to excite the comments of all who have known them.  - Juvenile Instructor, vol. 26, page 635    AND    For instance, the descendants of Cain cannot cast off their skin of blackness, at once, and immediately, although every soul of them should repent,... Cain and his posterity must wear the mark which God put upon them; and his white friends may wash the race of Cain with fuller's soap every day, they cannot wash away God's mark;...  - LDS Publication, The Millennial Star, vol. 14, page 418    "Their skin is quite black, their hair woolly and black, their intelligence stunted, and they appear never to have arisen from the most savage state of barbarism.  - The Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 3, page 157    QUOTES...    http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?c...    AND    NOTE:  Mormon apostle Bruce McConkie, in perhaps the most explicit denial of the virgin birth, wrote,   Quote...  "Christ was Begotten by an immortal Father in the same way that mortal men are begotten by mortal fathers." (Mormon Doctrine, 1966, p. 547)           The LDS Church's racism isn't just from some isolated quote from one or two church leaders. The racist teaching from the Mormon pulpit is prolific and consistent over time. If God didn't agree with his prophets teaching these things in His church, then why did they continue over generations?      No matter how you look at it, racism is awful, but the Mormon church has taken it to a new level.     What makes Mormon church's racism so awful are the following two points.   They justified racism in the name of God.   They still refuse to apologize.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Oh this cartoon. I've seen it before. So not really a shock.  Made by the excommunicated Ed Decker. I've read up on him to know that he has an ax to grind against the members and leaders of the LDS faith.     Watch these instead   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JB_BUrNg...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwJDADdAX...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiBGlFyMb...    A lot of the stuff shown in the cartoon are LDS beliefs taken out of context and warped to the point that it makes things positively weird and unusual, which is of course it's job.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	The non-member or former member who created and named the cartoon is the one who banned it. I would be highly surprised if any of the general authorities have ever seen it let alone heard of it.   It is something created by someone who has let hat govern his life and/or has nothing better to do with his time than to make up and publish lies.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	That video is a long lie and the fact that it starts out by saying "banned cartoon" implying that we banned it is the first lie.|`|q5lreoiWaa	Obviously this was written by another adherent of the Youtubeite religion! Well, it is difficult, but since you are so obviously WRONG , it makes it rather easy for me to respect your religion and defend your right to be wrong!!! This is just ridiculous!!|`|udn4euPYaa	I'm worried, because you're using a cartoon as a source of "truth". I pray and ask God for the truth on spiritual matters. People can tell you whatever they want, but at the end of the day God knows everything. So, if you have a question regarding our beliefs, don't go to yahoo answers, why don't you ask Him.|`|s37fnYJ4aa	Something you need to know about the LDS church... they do not BAN their members from any kind of learning.  I've been a member of the Church my whole life (30 years) and I have never heard of anyone saying, "You absolutely must not read this book."  According to my memory, none of the LDS prophets have ever banned anything while speaking at General Conference.    However, what we are taught is to use good judgment and the Holy Spirit to read from the best books.  I have seen that cartoon before.  It is full of distortions and half truths.  It's not worth watching twice.      Your claim that Mormons banned the cartoon is untrue.  I believe the cartoon is an attempt to discredit the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saitns - a religion that teaches its followers to strive to repent of all of their sins, in humility.  I think that is why people make up these lies - they don't want to know what is good and true, because then they would feel conscience-bound to give up their own sins.    "... put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do goodyea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously..."
wjCJhxPZaa	Island A would build boats and return to civilization    Island B would be content and make the best of it     Island C would die waiting to be saved|`|QnH9QuQwaa	They would all have similar results.  Mankind is just flesh and bones in the end.    But island A would become much more religious and have some divisions because of it.  I've never seen so many Atheists pray when a tornado is bearing down on our building, or after 9/11.  When disaster strikes, many Atheists quickly change their mind.  A minority stick to their guns.    Island B and Island C would be very similar.  When people are stuck together in survival situations, they quickly get over their own beliefs and try to survive.    P.S.  I got the conch!!!!!!  No thumbs down until I'm done with it!!!!!!  :)|`|56dfvnwmaa	the atheists A would be the most advanced    the christians C, would have further divided into EVEN MORE denominations(as if there arent enough already. protestant, lutheran, evengelical, fundemental, catholic, JW, mormon, presbyterian, etc). most likely they would turn on eachother and have their own civil war    those of us who are agnostic(like moi) wouldnt be able to make up our minds on anything. we'd probably still be deciding what we should do and wouldnt be able to make up a plan.    so yeah definitely the atheists(even though I myself am an agnostic). no offense to any christians but the way some act here I really dont think you guys would do very well. I mean you guys cant even agree on whether the bible should be taken literally or metaphorically. not to mention the whole "protestants vs catholics vs mormons vs jehovas witnesses". you guys all have very different ideas as to how to reach heaven|`|h1eBWehMaa	Christians will be more civilized and make the most improvement out of the groups  Atheists will probably argue and start fights with each other, probably end up murdering each other  Agnostics will just do whatever|`|dvY6UfiYaa	C would pray to god for salvation & deliverance.. probably starve to death cause they're too damn lazy too use their own brains & fend for themselves.    B.. I have no idea. I DON'T KNOW.    A would most likely survive & multiply.. cause you know.. we use our heads & know that drinking water, food & shelter isn't going to fall out of the sky.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	There are 2 different kinds of Christians. The ones that live by love thy neighbor as theyself & the ones that see things dualistically. So the Christians would be divided by that.    Atheists who knows. I know some very intelligent atheists who are atheists because of careful thought. Others are atheists because they are a mess like the Jerry Springer type. Usually those kind call themselves Christians though. So depending on if this would be the group it would be divided up.    Agnostics are live & let live people. I am agnostic & I think there is a humility in being able to say I just don't know & I am not going to pretend I do so I can be in with the crowd. I think these group is very loving & would be together.|`|DArAz67Caa	Island C would be flourishing in peace and harmony-----Island B would have half the population dead and the rest in arguments----and Group A would have "evolved" into dust and sand by the time a year ended----oh yes---I would imagine--|`|uz9GtV9vaa	What you're really asking is which group is more evolved-more fit to survive.  Based on historical evidence, I wouldn't bet against the Christians.|`|aNycRVC9aa	I would be in group A. We would most definitely come out on top because we would be responsible for our actions. We would depend on ourselves and our team mates instead of expecting a god to grant us prosperity, strength, and wisdom. We would kick ***. :)|`|yscczOhsaa	I would say island C would be best, because all the people on the island have one big thing in common. So would probably find it easier to work together and get along. I'm not sure about islands A and B, because they might all have very different personalities and beliefs (not neccessarily religious beliefs) which would make it more difficult.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	To be fair, under such extreme circumstances I imagine all three groups would act much the same - the societies would need to arrange themselves to divide the labour, and to fight for survival.  Once a comfortable working environment was established, their theologies might begin to show through.  The Christians might at that point start to become schismatic, and form independent communities, but equally might the atheists/agnostics divide on political issues, or simple decisions regarding the leadership of the islands.  If these divisions became excessive, to the point where each unit was too small to survive or worse, war were declared, the community on the given island would destroy itself.  I daresay the Christians would be most likely to fall into this one.|`|pahrtdsgaa	Using the island I found http://www.australiaadventures.com/image...    I would think that no one would survive a year due to either a lack of fresh water or storms that would completely flood the island.|`|7R3pNDJEaa	Everyone would probably come together for survival with those who know more about the environment coming forward to help and lead those that don't. Being divided into the different belief systems means nothing when your survival is on the line.    Or it would just turn into "Lord of the Flies." Either way.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Lol, that's funny just to think about it! I'd say the Atheists would be better organized and in better harmony. The Agnostics would be in denial and queston whether or not they were really even on an island. The Christians would be sneaking around doing dirty deeds while claiming to be forgiven, bickering over tithes, and arguing over when Jesus would be coming to the island to save them. I'm being facetious, but if I had my choice of which group I'd rather be with it would be the Atheists. Then again I might utter "OMG" and get booted off the island...lol!

FhHklqkhaa	the 8th answerer is a bigot and the type you we're targetting    the bigots never see what is in the mirror when you show them what they are like    many christians think you have to have god and be christian to do good then they claim it's only about  faith and not helping others, doing good is not required to enter heaven|`|bVJDV6QPaa	Of course, you can and anyone that says differently, is lying to you.

Using homeless people to bash obvious idiots.     If you really want to help them help them.    You just don't want to say that anything is wrong that you yourself personally don't think is wrong.     Talking about homosexuality I always quote Socrates. Why because you evil clods always make it religious issue as if one can't have a thought on the topic unless it's religious. How perverted.     From the Gorgias     Socrates But what if the itching is not confined to the head? Shall I pursue the question? And here, Callicles, I would have you consider how you would reply if consequences are pressed upon you, especially if in the last resort you are asked, whether the life of a catamite is not terrible, foul, miserable? Or would you venture to say, that they too are happy, if they only get enough of what they want?    Callicles Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of introducing such topics into the argument?    Socrates Well, my fine friend, but am I the introducer of these topics, or he who says without any qualification that all who feel pleasure in whatever manner are happy, and who admits of no distinction between good and bad pleasures? And I would still ask, whether you say that pleasure and good are the same, or whether there is some pleasure which is not a good?    Callicles Well, then, for the sake of consistency, I will say that they are the same.    Socrates You are breaking the original agreement, Callicles, and will no longer be a satisfactory companion in the search after truth, if you say what is contrary to your real opinion.    Callicles Why, that is what you are doing too, Socrates.    Socrates Then we are both doing wrong. Still, my dear friend, I would ask you to consider whether pleasure, from whatever source derived, is the good; for, if this be true, then the disagreeable consequences which have been darkly intimated must follow, and many others.    ===== AND THEN WILD THING BREAKS IN That, Socrates, is only your opinion.|`|WalnRzfGaa	i am an agnostic atheist and server at a soup kitchen 4 times a year.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	My mum forced me to help the needy when I was young and I have been roped into helping out  many times since.

AA11634944	Here here!    As long as the point gets across, Super Athiest, then it doesn't really matter to me!    And for those against gay marriage, your opinion is fine. Think what you want, but why should those who will never have to deal with being discriminated against for being gay decide how homosexuals should live their lives? Is it really any of your business if two gay people want to get married?    We all know that since the begining of time marraige has been defined by the joined union between a man and woman. Whose to say that union is the only correct one? When this country was founded slavery was acceptable, but that doesn't mean it was right. Change is bound to happen, get over it!|`|TDo1EMJkaa	Wow, that's  the best example of sarcasm I've ever witnessed, good job!|`|n9PUzlhzaa	Indeed you are right.|`|C5jqKAXpaa	No problem with Gays or their sexual orientation/practices...just not my personal cup of tea.    That said, I sincerely believe in the Man/Woman traditional/legal definition of marriage (we need look no further than nature for what is the natural order). I am in full favor of so-called civil unions for same-sex relationships that grant full recognition of the relationship. Why do we need to tamper with a long-standing institution (whether one agrees with it or not)? There are extreme "what ifs" that will no doubt come into play if we change the definition of marriage...believe me, it just human nature to do so.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I'm not going to argue any of your sarcastic questions, and i'm going to point out that I did in fact vote NO on prop8.

The question should really be what image homosexuality created that would make a usually progressive California vote in the way that they did?|`|2LsR22g9aa	LOL.

LuN1unJ3aa	Tell the sisters that it was a donation and that is how you view it. And as far as guidelines are concerned, clothing isn't a concern, particularly when there is a need. Jewelry and material things that have no value on a mission are another matter, but in your case, you're fine.     If you are really concerned, ask for the number to the mission home and speak to the mission president or one of his counselors. The guidelines for gifts are largely a matter of local policy.    My son served in Brazil, along the amazon, and he felt bad going to members' homes for meals, simply because the people were making sacrifices to feed them, often amounting to going hungry themselves. Your gift (I prefer donation) is nothing in comparison to that kind of gift.|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	give a man a fish....teach a man to fish...    you should've taught them how to knit some sweaters, hats, and gloves.|`|NI8D46J0aa	I don't think it was inappropriate at all.

The sister seems wrapped up in rules (and quite possibly jealousy) instead of in Christ-like love.|`|ApyKiltXaa	There isn't any church guidlines in regards to hats.

Sometimes people should just listen first before they broadcast their ignorance.|`|2QuGuphYaa	Were they not wearing their magic underwear?|`|YF8Tv5Ezaa	I totally wouldn't feel bad about giving them hats, it's an act of charity to somebody in need.

As long as you don't give them something that is not necessary. Good for you for being so nice!!!|`|I71x2a8eaa	Guidelines? Do you really care about guidelines?

Plus, way to impregnate society with the idea that EVERY black person is from Africa.  Which isn't true.    If what you say is true, he seems like a disenfranchised pseudo-racist.  Which will never allow society to be race-blind.  In the same way a white person might look at another white person and not think twice about it, that's the way it should be with any race (see: England & black people).  Of course, there's your variety of factors impeding such progress...      P.S.

We still have people very high in office who hate black but by law cant refuse them to work if they fit the qualities but wont let them get higher in any position.. I think thAT some black people are still made that theyre ancestors and other people died so that we can be equal to whites and for what?? And some white are mad because we are getting closer and closer to being as equal. Black people have contributed alot  to thisand alot we dnt get as much credit as we should or would if we were white...People talk about how ignorant and crazy  and all this other crap but you have to do your background research first its only so much a person can take  and if im black and im a reserch doctor and for all the studies i find a white man gets credit eventually i will lose my mind...thats why VOTE FOR OBAMA ...CHANGE IS COMIN A CHANGE THE WHOLE WORLD NEEDS !!!

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Gotta love Rene O.  hehehehehehe    The Catholic church has a program called RCIA, check into it.    Rite of Catholic Initiation or RCIA are classes for adults (and possibly teens over the age of 16 I think) which want to learn more about Catholicism. They are usually held in the evenings once or twice a week because obviously, most Adults have day-jobs.    Obviously the majority of the people in there want to become Catholic, and so that is the MAIN thrust of the class,  but I've heard a FEW people taking it merely to learn more about Catholics and then quitting towards the end.     During the course of the class, in addition to learning about Catholicism you will go thru the Sacraments which children usually go thru but in an accelerated process.   Confession, Communion, Confirmation, etc.     If you were Baptized in your other church, you are considered baptized and so you don't have to go thru that.  However, if you received Communion,  like in the Lutheran church, I think you STILL have to go thru communion in the Catholic church..because it is different.     At the end of the classes, your group will atttend a normal church service, and during that, will be formally accepted as Catholics and introduced to the rest of the general congregation.  Kinda like how a Priest/Pastor often times says, at the end of a wedding, " I now introduce to you,  Mr. and Mrs. ____ "  -- Well the Priest will do the same at that mass,  he'll introduce the group in a general sense to everyone there.     There might be some SLIGHT variation to this, depending on the size of the church and their local customs.       But generally speaking,  you just find out from the Church Receptionist when the RCIA classes start up and how you sign up for them.  VOILA!  the rest is just like taking a class in school.    You might check out your Husband's church's website, they might have a schedule online.  You could also have your husband call for ya, if you are embarrassed or shy.    ::NOTE::  You might here mention of the term "CCD"  which stands for "Confraternity of Christian Doctrine" which is a fancy term for the classes that kids go to.  Often times the RCIA classes are considered part of CCD , so you might hear the 2 terms used together.|`|AA12059478	You'll have to take classes.   Speak to your husband's parish priest.  best wishes.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I always get thumbed down from the Catholics for saying this, but I will anyhow (their thumbing me down is just proof they don't agree and therefore don't follow Christ).    Learn what Christ taught. He was/is the real teacher. Learn it and live it. You don't need a religion to do that.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	You have to download Catholicism Pro.  Before installing, run a firmware update and you might want to save all your drivers to a CD or another drive partition.  Just a precaution.    Rolling back to Catholicism Home or Pro from Protestant (any version) isn't a huge system change but there's been known to be issues with some plug-n-play devices.    (sorry.  couldn't resist.)

elVryMQUaa	Well, actually you're confusing what a fact is. Evolution is a theory (but not "Just" a theory.) The facts are that we have found fossils dating back billions of years, and that these fossils show different time periods, branches of animals etc. Evolution through natural selection is the theory on how that came to be. Fossils are the facts, evolution  is the theory, and the only good theory we have that fits and it has mountains of evidence behind it such as genetics. Same as gravity, we observe that masses in space are attracted to one another, and gravity is our theory on how that happens. General Relativity is our theory on how gravity works. Evolution is observed, and is true, but it's not a "fact" per say. But remember a theory in the scientific sense doesn't mean make **** up, a theory is a model based on observations that have been carefully made.    Here's what Stephe" Hawking said about theory in his popluar science book "the universe in a nutshell":  :Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by Friedrich Hayek and Karl Popper and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes."|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Evolution is a theory. It is the best explanation that 99.999% of the biologists in the world have for the diversity of life on earth, but it isn't like the three rules of thermodymaics.    The Creationist logic is:    If one line in the Bible is false, all of the Bible comes into question.  If the Bible is false, we have no reason to live moral lives.  Thus evolution has to be denied.    (That is simplified considerably, and I'm not really qualified to delve deeper, considering I'm an agnostic and a Unitarian Universalist. I can expand on it, though.)    They are not completely whacko. Auditors do this; if you find someone cheating on one line of one expense report, the rest of his reports are suspect too. Scientists do it too; if one fact in a scientific report is wrong, the rest is suspect. Historians mistrust their fellow historians if they get a fact wrong. Auditors, scientists and historians don't usually have a strict zero tolerance policy, though; they know people are fallible. If you miss a fact here and there, that doesn'tmean your cure for cancer or revisionist biography is completely worthless, just that your peers will look at it more closely.    If the Bible is false, there is no reason to live moral lives, because your hope of a heavenly reward is suspect. So, spend your days in rape, murder, pillage and arson. You don't have to read to the kids after dinner while your wife washes the dishes, either.    As a related side note, and a subject that comes up here constantly, fundamentalists don't believe atheists can be moral. If there isn't the carrot of heaven and the stick of hell, why would anyone be anything but cruel and selfish?      > . . . evolution is accepted fact?    It isn't really accepted. Ask any high school biology teacher how many students and parents dispute it. The other day I read that 44% of all Americans believed in flying saucers and 42% believed in evolution.     There is an infintesimal chance it isn't a fact. It would be physically possible for an omnipotent God to create the world molecule by molecule, putting fossils into the rock strata to tempt people into doubt.    Hope I helped. You can understand something without believing in it. You aren't going to convert your so-workers, and they aren't going to convert you. Talk about your favorite Super Bowl Commercial instead.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I am in neither camp. Evolution is pure bull.    Let me just correct you on a couple 'facts'.    2) "became widely received it was 'fact' that the earth was flat."  This is a sign that you are not educated. DOn't you know that fact was actually concocted by evolutionists !!! I put the material out there for all to see....   Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians  by Jeffrey Burton Russell   "Russell conclusively shows how the 'flat earth' myth was concocted and popularized by Washington Irving and a French erudit and how the 'flat error' was declared by Darwininst historians, who compared the denial of Darwin's theory to Columbus's struggle for acceptance by his scholastic religious contemporaries."     1) According to the study "The Hollow Core" very few college graduates for the last 30 years have had more than a smidgen of the necessary science to even understand evolution -- unless it was their major.   Follow this and look for 'science'  http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:VKsf...    ====> Yet 38 percent of the institutions we examined fail to require a natural or physical science  and these are the best schools in the country !!|`|dvY6UfiYaa	It hurts their head to think god isn't the reason we're here.

The definition of a "fact" in scientific terms is something that actual exist and is measurable and provable.  A process is not considered a "fact".  It is considered a "theory".  That does not mean that it is not "real". which is what you are actually trying to argue.

Evolution is a FACT, Natural Selection is the scientific theory.    Nobody in biology disagrees that all life evolved; that is proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.  The debate is whether or not Natural Selection is the sole, primary, or partial driving force behind evolution.    Not, creationists are egged on by unscrupulous creationist propaganda.|`|m6IZpNJLaa	It is NO scientific fact,, theory, not fact! Darwin wasn't even a biologist. Because they are finding fossils of several types of human like creatures found in the same strata and dated to the same age. When these creatures were supposed to be separated by millions of years.  I hardly call that proof.  If evolution is true that everything evolved from lower life forms cause they were inferior then why are they still here, the single cell creatures. The man who came up with carbon dating said his method was flawed and questioned its validity.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Obviously not. Bring him the definition of a scientific theory- it is essentially a collect of facts. They argue about how evolution works but this imagined debate only occurs in the media and by some cranky parents trying to force it into science classes. In the scientific world, evolution is it!    And we do watch it happen. Think about drug resistant infections. We observe it. How is that not natural selection and evolution?    Some try and set the line between "microevolution" and "macroeveoltuion", saying they believe in evolution within species but not turning into other species. It is nonsense.    ADD: My first Bio professor said "Evolution is FACT, Natural selection, the mechanism for it, is the theory!" There is NO argument that evolution happens.      So to the person saying that in Universities they will tell you it is a theory, you are wrong.     And anyways, a scientific theory is NOT just a guess, it is a collection of facts! Creationism and ID are NOT theories.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Science is an allegory, man, a metanarrative, a "way" of speaking.

Prove that you are not a "brain in a vat" hooked up to a computer program that you perceive to be "reality." You guys are really hung up on this "facts" nonsense, aren't you?

Evolution is theory! thats why its called "the theory of evolution"! Its not a fact!"    What they leave out is that its not "The theory of Evolution", its The Theory of Evolution by means of Natural Selection. That is the theory. Evolution itself is a fact. It is observable. Its a fact. Its the mechanism that causes evolution that is the theory. Natural Selection is the theory that Darwin came up with, not evolution.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Evolution is a theory, not a fact.  In science a theory is not just a "guess" but is an explanation based on facts.  Evolution is perhaps the most factually supported scientific theory that exists.  Facts that support evolution include a mountain of circumstantial facts from such disciplines as paleontology, ecology, population genetics, comparative anatomy, biogeography, systematics, etc. , supported by mathematical algorithms of natural selection and proved by hard forensic evidence from molecular genetics.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Technically evolution is theory not fact, it does make more sense than a talking snake though.|`|YfbC1m3haa	It would make their book that has a talking snake in it seem even less believable.|`|7GWSZcFIaa	Actually the FACT is that evolution is not a recognized scientific fact. Try studying at a proper University, or ask a proper university, it's not called the THEORY of Evolution for nothing.|`|eUEgi111aa	Lets just not bother. It's their ignorance, not ours.    'it's not called the THEORY of Evolution for nothing.'    DO YOU PEOPLE NOT KNOW WHAT 'THEORY' MEANS?    Ffs..    Evolution is a FACT with a scientific THEORY behind it. Douche bags.|`|JP1o1ggZaa	Point of fact if "Evolution is scientific fact" it would not be called" The Theory of Evolution. I think it is time for you to get your facts strait.|`|373KJjiOaa	Are you really uneducated enough to mistake a theory for a fact? Evolution is a theory not a fact, stating otherwise indicates that you need to educate yourself before attacking the presumed lack of knowledge of others.    Note, however, that being a theory in no way diminishes the fact that evolution is the best current explanation for the development of different species on Earth. Just don't attempt to sound "intellectual" and then go and make a fool of yourself in a question.    edit:    Oh dear, so many other self styled "intellectuals" are making the same mistake. This may help you lot get started in the proper direction:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_a...|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Evolution is only a theory. A very good theory. Most of life is nothing but theories, nothing can actually be proven, "Nothing is Real." (Lennon)     All the great thinkers and philosophers of the world knew that Knowledge is knowing you actually KNOW nothing at all and that you can only make educated guesses.|`|90J1C8VYaa	Actually, it is both.    The Theory of Evolution explains how it happened/happens.    The fact of evolution is that it happened/happening.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	There is a difference between the observable changes in species over time and the idea that evolution by natural selection is the cause. Are there observable changes over time, yes. Does the theory of evolution have a possible explanation as to why these changes happen, yes. Is the theory of evolution the only or best way to explain these observations, maybe. Evolution is not infallible truth, it is the best current explanation for the available facts. It can be changed or even abandoned if sufficient evidence were shown to disprove the idea or provide a better explanation. Intelligent Design is an attempt to do this but is also merely a model and not fact and will be changed and updated accordingly to reflect new data. Both have hidden philosophical underpinnings, most notably evolution working from a closed system and Intelligent design working from an open system.    Screaming that your way has to be right, now who does that remind me of. Oh that's right, the very creationist's you are trying to say are wrong.|`|oo1jL45Baa	Have you ever seen macro evolution at work?  Of course not.  No one has seen the kind of scientific changes that allegedly occurs over millions of years.  The reason why scientists keep insisting on calling it a "fact" is because they refuse to open up their minds to the possibility of a Creator.    It's a theory, that's all...with no evidence --> show me millions of transitional fossils which should exist if evolution were true.    Better yet...just show me ONE that is uncontested.
2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	The only reason incest isn't legal in this country is that there are cultural taboos against it. The SAME reason that homosexuals are denied marriage rights.

Since there is a very real danger of deformity, it is simply safest not to allow it.  Of course, if you wish to establish your own 'law', under which marriage to your sister is allowed, go for it.  I am sure, though that you can see that it would be dangerous for the state to recognise such a marriage.  There is no danger at all in recognising gay marriage.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	i don't know why i'm going to answer you respectfully and seriously, as your question is neither.    but family marriages lead to coercion. people are forced to marry within their family in order to preserve wealth.     that has absolutely nothing to do with gay marriage, a topic with which you are clearly obsessed. gee i wonder why. maybe you should take an intro psychology class, you'll learn a lot about yourself.|`|8tF9Py9Daa	Because you know you can't satisfy her?

It's wrong because family is sacred and when you violate that bond you take something that should be pure (love) and deform it into something that fights nature (don't pull the whole gayness isn't natural shiz because if they didn't belong they wouldn't be here, which makes sense if you think about it). There is a reason family members don't marry each other, that is a violation of the sanctity of marriage like nothing else.|`|NGKwsawdaa	go for it why don't you go ahead and marry your dog and grandmother at the same time.|`|YfbC1m3haa	Abraham married his sister, Sarah.

Incidentally: The verse "Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged" is used by the Bishop, Priest and Deacons of the Orthodox Church after they receieve Holy Communion from the Chalice.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	an appendage of great mirth.|`|AA12044219	Isaiah 6:6 With tongs

He took his stand above the people and said to them: "God says, 'Why are you transgressing the LORD'S commands, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have abandoned the LORD, he has abandoned you.'"   21   But they conspired against him, and at the king's order they stoned him to death in the court of the LORD'S temple.

The followers of Islam call themselves Muslims. The three religions share the same God. Christianity and Islam have different views on profets. While the Christians consider Jesus the son of God, the Muslims consider him a profet like Mohamed but claim God can have no son. Abraham, the hebrew biblical figure, was the father of Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael, his firstborn son, is considered the Father of the Arabised Arabs, and Isaac is considered the Father of the Hebrews. Thus Abraham  is a major figure in all three religions and considered one of the most Important profets in Islam as well.

I'm a teenager, so I don't know how it would be to wait that long, but I don't think I'm sexually repressed at all.  It's not a matter of being cautious and protected, it's a matter of staying pure because thats what God designed for us.  Hope that helps!|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Your entire premise is laughable, unprovable, editorial and baseless.|`|AA11598520	I didn't "patiently wait until I found someone special" simply because I was in my late 30s to have sex. I wasn't waiting for a husband. I hadn't found anyone I wanted to have sex with. There's a big difference. I didn't have "sexual misery" and I wasn't "sexually repressed." Why is it that simply because I decide to wait to have sex with someone I wanted to have sex with that I had to be so "sexually repressed?" Couldn't it be possible that I just didn't do it with just anybody?     I met someone, we had sex. That's it. I didn't "wait all those years" in desperation. Please! You're making way too much of a big deal out of sex. It isn't the only part of a relationship. In fact, it's a very small part.

SYFnuCavaa	My biggest one apart from tickling is inflation. I love the sound of balloons being blown up, and it really gets me if something's being blown up (especially a person that's enjoying it) that can't pop. I find it an extreme turn-on to blow up an air mattress underneath me. It feels so good. =w=  I also love backrubs, foot rubs and footsies. They feel amazing, and there's just something about the slow, soothing, repetitive rubbing motion that drives me crazy.  I loove PVCs on guys. The tighter/shinier, the better.  I love shiny, oiled skin on guys also (and sometimes on girls- it makes them look like human balloons and I end up picturing myself as one...and getting inflated.)  Those under-the-table clips of women rubbing between the guy's legs...? Add some rope to tie his hands behind the chair and keep his legs apart and I'll just about die. X3  So basically all of mine involve a person (whether it's me or a guy) being absolutely helpless to stop something that feels really wonderful that's going on for a really long time... and loving every second of it. Yet strangely enough, none of them involve intercourse in any way. Despite everything I said up there, I'm actually kinda prude. xD  Thanks for having this question; I needed somewhere to vent. And as you can see, there are some freaking weird people out there, let alone fetishes. What I'll say is that as long as they're safe, harmless fetishes, you have the safety of your room and-if you choose- you have someone to enjoy them with, go right ahead and enjoy them. x3|`|vJqPsEsWaa	I like being the sex slave =)|`|p2PQZvTzaa	I like legs|`|qHCtBq07aa	Don't know if its weird but I love being a Dominatrix, and love playing with weird sex toys.|`|JbKerMCkaa	I get aroused when I hear steel bending (screeching) on movies.

Tcu0NWkUaa	No worries about this issue.  Dress comfortably as the above posters have mentioned.  Okay, don't go in your pajamas. LOL    I'm happy for you to be learning about our Church.  May God bless you as you study with the missionaries so that you may discern the truth of their message.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Where whatever it is that you're comfortable wearing. :]|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Wear what you want.    In Italy sometimes in the summer we would have problems with people not wearing enough (I can't tell you how many times women came to the door naked or topless and spoke to us for a minute THEN realized that they were naked - shouldn't you think about that when the doorbell rings?).    So if it's -20', then whatever you would choose to wear is just fine.    Your question does show respect; I think you'll have a great meeting with them tonight.|`|vDIBCj1vaa	Were brothers and sisters in Christ. I dont even see the need for formality here. When we meet missionaries we invite them with a hug, and sometimes if they show up real late at night, we usher them in wearing pajamas. But then Im in Indian and I guess the culture is different here. And you were right you dont have to worry too much about it, I think. Maybe advice from someone who lives in your country would be more suitable for you. :) wish I kinda helped|`|8jhACvtlaa	I would just dress warmly I would think.    It is certainly not wrong to wear pants and a shirt to meet with the missionaries--at least it wasn't when I was a missionary.    If you decide to visit the church, you might feel more comfortable in a skirt or dress, because that's usually what most of the ladies at church wear.  The guys usually go in shirts and ties.    I hope you have a good discussion with the missionaries!
zPfgFXU5aa	Mary Magdalene's image became distorted when the Roman Catholic Church merged into her story the stories of several less distinguished women whom the Bible either did not mention by name, or referred to without a last name so that while we know in some cases the woman  was a "Mary" we don't know which "Mary" she was.      "Mary" (Miriam) was a very popular name in Biblical times, every Jewish family would have had at least one Mary in it (probably more) , which adds up to hundreds if not thousands of Marys being around at that time.     One is the "sinner" in Luke who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears, dries them with her hair, kisses them and anoints them with ointment.      Others include Luke's Mary of Bethany (sister of Martha and Lazarus) who also washed Jesus' feet at a different time and place.      The "trash Magdalene conspiracy" was made official by Pope Gregory the Great in 591 who said:  "She whom Luke calls the sinful woman, whom John calls Mary [of Bethany], we believe to be the Mary from whom seven devils were ejected according to Mark,"     The Bible never said it, there was no evidence anywhere - it was just Gregory's belief, a delusion, a figment of his imagination!    Perhaps it irked Gregory that in the New Testament Mary Magdalene seems a more important figure than the Mary whom the Church promoted to Queen of Heaven/Co-redemptrix status.  It was Mary Magdalene  who was in Jesus' inner circle during his 3 year ministry, and she was the first to discover the empty tomb, first to see the resurrected Christ, and first to tell the other believers, even though in that society women were kind of second class citizens and not considered to be as good a witness as a man.  Therefore in order to have their immaculate virgin Goddess it was necessary for the Roman church to trash all her potential rivals.      In 1969 at the Second Vatican Council the Roman Catholic Church corrected  Pope Gregory's mistake and the church officially separated Luke's sinful woman, Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and the resurrected Lazarus, and Mary Magdalene,  back into separate and unrelated women.      Therefore the very flimsy scriptural evidence that Gregory misunderstood and the "Church tradition" used for centuries to blacken Magdalene's name no longer exists and has been reversed! (So much for Popes being infallible and tradition being as good as scripture!)      At the Second Vatican Council , the Church also took a long look at all the saints on its calendar to see if there was historical evidence that that saint existed and lived a life of holiness. In taking that long look, the Church discovered that there was little proof that many "saints", including some very popular ones, ever lived and to correct that error those doubtful Saints were dropped from the universal Church calendar.        The Roman Catholic Church falsely teaches that their "Church Tradition" has equal authority with the Bible but here we have their own admissions that "Church Tradition" had several things all wrong.      Based on that, would it not be logical to dump Church Tradition about everything and just go by what can be historically proved combined with what it says in the Bible and have the Bible as their one and only authority on God's word?     I guess they can't do that because they are wrong on so many other and as yet unadmitted things that they would be put out of business if they admitted them all and the Church is a business, a very big business.     However while it was very wrong to trash Mary Magdalene, it is also wrong to make Mary Magdalene more than she was like the DaVinci code does, just as it is wrong to make Mary the mother of Jesus more than she was like the Roman Catholic Church still does.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	a different woman, some say a rich woman, some say another wife|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Please refer to the complete article cited below... but I pull quote from it... oh.. and it's spelled, "Magdalene"...    Mary Magdalene witnessed most of the events surrounding the crucifixion. She was present at the mock trial of Jesus; she heard Pontius Pilate pronounce the death sentence; and she saw Jesus beaten and humiliated by the crowd. She was one of the women who stood near Jesus during the crucifixion to try to comfort Him. The earliest witness to the resurrection of Jesus, she was sent by Jesus to tell the others (John 20:11-18). Although this is the last mention of her in the Bible, she was probably among the women who gathered with the apostles to await the promised coming of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:14).      Have a blessed day.|`|bsyeJmqIaa	Like most, a troubled soul.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	I think she was the sister of Lazareth.   I know he had 2 sisters and one was named Mary, but I am not 100% sure they are the same.|`|AA11156135	Mary has been given a bad rap, - simply because her appearance in one of the gospels occurs right after a verse that talks about a prostitute.    No other reason than that to think she was a prostitute.    I saw a documentary on TV that talked about the Catholic church wanting to down-play the role of women in the church, -and made her into a prostitute.
zPfgFXU5aa	The ancients were aware of decimals and fractions, in fact the use of decimals has been traced back as far as 2600BC AND they were also aware that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle is a fraction over 3.    However the passage in the Bible that people claim is giving the wrong formula for PI was simply giving a description of what the temple and its "furnishing" objects looked like.  No where does it say "This is the mathematical value of Pi...."    The Measurements in that text were therefore given in round figures which is the common and accepted practice in non-technical literature meant for general consumption.     For example, to an astronomer a day is twenty-three hours, fifty-six minutes, and 4.09054 seconds, but to everyone else it's 24 hours - which is a near enough approximation for most purposes.     Should we destroy all the non-technical books in all the libraries that speak of 24 hour days because they rounded it off  to 24, the nearest whole number instead of taking it to 5 decimal places?    A supercomputer in Tokyo once calculated pi to more than 2 billion digits. It could not, however, reach the final decimal place because as every mathematician knows, that lies somewhere beyond infinity, so if the Bible were to give the exact figure for Pi then the Old Testament scribes would still be writing and would by now have used up every sheet of paper and  parchment on the planet!    But like I said, no where does the Bible say that it is giving the precise mathematical figure for pi. It does not even claim to be giving the approximate formula. Why would it need to when the ancients already had an adequate working knowledge of pi that more than meet their needs?    Seems to me that the people who want to tear down the Bible are making a mountain out of a molehill here.      But if you want to get really technical then the Bible gave sufficient information for you to be able to calculate Pi if you really felt the need...  The bowl described in the Bible is said to have had a circumference of thirty cubits and a diameter of ten cubits. The diameter is said to be "from one rim to the other", so this would be the outer diameter; that is, the diameter of the outer mold used to make the bowl.       The circumference is not specified as being the inner or outer circumference, but since using the outer circumference would give us the "ideal" bowl (with no width or thickness), let's instead use the inner circumference, which also, reasonably, would have been the circumference of the mold used to form the inside of the bowl. That is, we will use the two measurements which were necessary for the casting of the piece.      Using eighteen inches for one cubit, we have the following:    outer diameter: 10 cubits, or 180 inches   outer radius: 5 cubits, or 90 inches   inner circumference: 30 cubits, or 540 inches     To find the "Jewish" or "Bible" value for pi, we need to have the inner radius.   Once we have that value, we can plug it into the formula for the circumference and compare with the given circumference value of 540 inches.    Since the thickness of the bowl is given as one handsbreadth, then the inner radius must be:    90  4 = 86 inches    Let's do the calculations:    inner radius:  86 inches   inner circumference:  540 inches         The circumference formula is C = 2(pi)r, which gives us:    540 = 2(pi)(86)   540 = 172(pi)     Solving, we get pi =  540/172  =  135/43   = 3.1395348837..., or about 3.14.    Um... Isn't "3.14" the approximation we all use for pi?|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	very interesting. good question|`|4Mg2sSdkaa	22/7  (Well, 22/7 actually exceeds .)|`|212F2EO0aa	3.14159......or call it 3 and be done.

I use PI everyday to calculate surface footage    Diogesis: If you worked for me and wasted company time carrying out 10 decimals places you might be fired as well.      Some of us actually workout side a lab and text book.

I don't know anything about that, but all rational numbers can be expressed without decimals, so that's not going to cause a problem until you try to use a non-rational real number like PI, which still causes a problem to this day. You can't actually express PI properly even with decimals, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist!    EDIT: I should add that while PI cannot even be expressed as anything other than an approximation with decimals, you don't need decimals to express it. PI is the number of a circle's diameters it takes, without overlap, to form that same circle's circumference. See? I didn't use decimals, and I defined it perfectly. I just figured I should add that because a lot of answerers are focusing on the fact that decimals did exist, but that's really beside the point.

I suppose you are now going to ask about the accident your christian friend had yesterday.  You see not all that profess to be Christian are real Christians.  And if your friend was Christian maybe God allowed him to come in contact with the other person so he/she could witness to them  Now you are chuckling!  that is o.k.

g54tGcRvaa	Evolution is a buzzword for at least 4 separate arguments: Microevolution, Macroevolution, Human Primal Descent, and Abiogenesis.  Microevolution is easily provable, and is compatible with Abrahamic dogma.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with the origin of life.  In fact, Charles Darwin himself along with the rest of the most prominent naturalists and biologists who have contributed to the theory all agree that they haven't anything but the most rudimentary dart-throw in the dark on explaining origin.    Never forget this: anyone who speaks as though it's "Evolution vs. God" doesn't know what they're talking about, UNLESS they are a Creationist.  The only theological stance that is interrupted by evolution is Creationism.    God bless you.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Evolution doesn't explain the origin of life, only the diversity of life.

We have hints like RNA being used as protein and that points to something 100 times more primitive than modern lifeforms.  Before that, there were self replicating systems but the exact nature of them will probably never be known.      I believe in a higher being involved in our lives because of personal experience but I don't believe in a creator of the universe involved in our lives.  The number of stars and age of the universe make that beyond unlikely.  We are without question physically related to other animals.  The evidence for that is actually mathematically stronger than any other theory on earth. The odds of a thousand DNA bases occurring in a particular order is such a small number that it would have many hundreds of zeros after the decimal point.      1. The fossil record clearly demonstrates in an unambiguous way that animals have been changing over time.  It clearly shows speciation and evolution.  The dating of rocks is verified by several different methods.  We would have to throw out the book on nuclear physics, chemistry, and geology to deny the ages.  2.  There are several types of evidence involving genetics beyond the ones I listed.    a.  Humans have a different number of chromosomes than the other great apes but the evidence is very compelling that one of our chromosomes is the result of fusion of two ape chromosomes.  It is beyond difficult to explain the fused chromosome without admitting that humans and apes share a common ancestor. http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome...    b. Mitochondrial DNA studies have been done on thousands of different species.  There is a section of DNA on the mitochondria that doesn't code for proteins and is free to randomly accumulate mutations.  It is used as a sort of clock to show evolutionary relationships.  When they sequence a few hundred base-pairs as is common, the odds of one of those sequences occurring randomly is one over a number with hundreds of zeros.  The sequences show humans are 91% similar to chimps.  We are less closely related to gorillas.  They are not just randomly different.  They are different in a way that suggests a common ancestor of humans and chimps.  Chimps and humans share many of the differences between themselves and gorillas but have had enough time to accumulate many separate differences.  That pattern is consistent with all other animals.  It is powerful mathematical proof of evolution.       c.  Many genes and genetic markers are shared by closely related animals.  Some genes are maintained by virtually all animals but the number of genes that are similar or the same increases as they are more closely related.  That also applies to non-coding regions so the argument that a similar animal will have similar genes is just distortion of actual data.    3.  The logic in the writings of Darwin was so persuasive that it is impossible to ignore without just ignoring the evidence.  We can see it in our domesticated animals and it is silly to think that nature can't select desirable characteristics.  We know the time frames involved and we see how animals, including people, are adapted with regional differences.  If there are persuasive arguments about errors in Darwin's simple logic, I haven't heard them.    About the most persuasive argument against evolution is that we don't know how life first started.  That may be so but we know that the life equivalent to modern bacteria started about 3.5 to 3.9 billion years ago.  If God created life, he create bacteria almost 4 billion years ago and humans have only been around a tiny percentage of that time.  The same egocentric view believing humans are the center of the universe falls flat on its face when you consider the hundreds of billions of other galaxies and the vast time they have been around.|`|YfbC1m3haa	Evolution is change over time.  It makes no suggestions regarding origins of life.    Many hypotheses have been tested and found to agree with the theory that the desirable variations in a species over time, produce changes in the population.    So, does evolution = the big bang?  no.    Only religious folks tend to think that.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Absolute forensic evidence is found in molecular genetics.  We can now look into the genome, even individual genes, and looking at nucleobase differences in interspersed junk sequences, actually determine how long ago a mutation happened that led to an adaptation that helped to create speciation.     Other disciplines, such as paleontology, biogeography, ecology, comparative morphology, population genetics, developmental biology, immunology, etc., offer circumstantial evidence, although the mountainous volume of such supporting circumstantial evidence is also good proof.    Now the study of evolution is different from the study of life's origins, which is abiogenesis.  Many laboratories have made fascinating finds about various biological precursors formed by chemical reactions under a range of conditions.  Complex biochemicals can form so easily that most scientists believe that wherever in the universe that you find liquid water, you are likely to find life.  There are many unanswered questions remaining in the study of abiogenesis, such as what came first: phenotypic RNA or information carrying proteins (either way is chemically possible).|`|756012ab0251e75276bfcdb01caf9285aa	it would be better to ask a real biologist then people on here. most of these people know what evolution is, but don't understand exactly how it works. though i may be wrong and a bio major is on here.    agnostic atheist|`|gfwK3SWIaa	First of all, evolution doesn't disprove a creator. Science can go back till like.0000000000000000000000001 seconds before the big bang happen, but still don't know how the matter got here. That's about the only place you can add a God of the Gaps, which is what he is. To add, there's no saying evolution doesn't happen. Farmers use artificial selection to make crops better, which is evolution. A change over time. The concept isn't hard and isn't foreign it just doesn't co-inside with the belief a magical man in the sky snapped his non-existent fingers and the universe, possibly dimensions (quantum theory) into existence.

I find no compelling examples that this process is insufficient to explain the rich variety of life forms present on this planet. While no one could claim yet to have ferreted out every detail of how evolution works, I do not see any significant "gaps" in the progressive development of life's complex structures that would require divine intervention. In any case, efforts to insert God into the gaps of contemporary human understanding of nature have not fared well in the past, and we should be careful not to do that now."    sorry about the cut and paste, but I think you'll find it helpful...|`|zWj6HXHNaa	Fruit flies, whales, Darwin's bird, and Italian wall lizard are all equally good.

In the Bible it says that there is evidence of God in nature and everything around us. If people who have never heard of God see that there is evidence of a Creator all around them, it doesn't matter if they take upon the title of "Christian" or ask specifically Jesus into their heart. God knows their heart. God is loving & will not send someone to hell because they were not informed of everything there was to know about Christianity. As long as they believe there is a Creator, even if they don't know everything, I really believe they will go to Heaven.   & as far as you being an Atheist. Isn't it easier to believe that you are here for a reason, not just by chance? But let's say you're right... then after we die we won't go to Heaven or Hell... we'll just die. But let's say I'm right... then after we die those who believe will go to Heaven. Wouldn't you rather your chances be better?  I don't judge anyone based on what they believe or how they live.

"Romans 1:20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."    which leads us to this...    "Revelation 20:12And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. "|`|b0IYXTcBaa	Paul makes clear in the first chapter of Romans that this line of thinking is false. He declares that God has provided natural revelations of aspects of his glory and instead of seeking this out man has provided their own ideas about it and started to worship false gods of their own creation. Thus they spiral deeper into their sin because they consciously trade the idea of God and instead engage in rebellion. Because of this God has handed them over to their sin. It is the responsibility of Christians to go bring the Gospel to them that they might hear, but it is not a requirement of God to give them special exception because they have already decided to engage in a cycle of sin. They are being given what they deserve.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	First of all when you die it is just you at the Judgment.    When the village person dies it is just them.

If you burn your hand on a stove, did it feel good? Of course not. But if the kitchen was cold and you stood by the heat and flame and was warmed by it you would feel good, right?  We are born with the knowledge of positive and negative. Physically we know what these are first with feeling and touching. Second is our sense of smell. The smell of our mother, then other family members. Third is hearing. We know when sounds are pleasant and which ones are not. Fourth is our sight. If we are lucky and have caring and loving people to care for us, we will learn beautiful things like colors, smiles, and the difference of day and night (dark and light). We learn all these things at the first 6 weeks of birth. There was no bible study, no religious dogma, just human nature. As we get older we learn what is positive in our lives and what are negative. What makes us feel good, what makes others feel good, and what makes us feel bad or self concious. We learn this from interaction with others.   The Tarzan story is also based on a theory going around at the time the story was written. Could man actually survive without human contact and still be able to survive? Would he have a conscience? An understanding of morals in his secluded world? Would he develope a religion or false understanding of how life should be? (the false understanding was based on Christian religions values) Would he be able to live among the wild beasts and actually live his life according to natures laws? The answer was always yes. Of course the theologians disagreed due to the need of a set laws given by " God " and the dogma that they believed was needed to live a rightous life. Hence, the author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, wrote the book Tarzan the Ape Man which spurred on the debate.   The conclusion is, we learn from our environment and those that are in that environment whether it be human or beast. We are born understand good and bad, positive and negative. We do not need a book or religion to teach it to us. Even today, we have thousands of copies of the bible and other religious books to help us work our lives as good as we can. We even have thousand more self help books, videos, and cds to help us cope with this world. It is not in these books and words, but our own actions and reactions that make this understanding so important. The best quote I can give to reverberate this understanding is "A man is not known by his faith but by his actions".|`|BOKyHQUhaa	Well, although I'm an atheist, I still have to disagree with one comment-    "If it comes from religion, it's surely wrong."    As you said, religion does cloud ones mind of scientific facts, but it also set down moral codes and laws.    Ex. "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."        "Thou shall not steal."        "Thou shall not murder."    Of course, if there wasn't religion, people would still have common sense, moral ethics, and the government would still have laws.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Everyone is born with the Light of CHrist which is what gives ALL MEN a conscience.

If humans were so good, there wouldnt be abortion, murder, rape, robberies, war, genocides, etc.  There wouldnt be porn, homosexuality, adultery.    But that's not where it ends.  You are right, we cant earn God's grace.  This is why it's called grace.  God loves us, in spite of our failings.  Dont be motivated by the fear of Hell, although one should fear Hell, but be motivated by God's love.  He loves us so much that He died for us, to pay our penalty.  Beat that.

Remember that God is just God and gave humans the values and principles that we should follow.     Humans created religion.  They each take what the Bible says and put their own influence on it in some way where all of the stuff above comes from: humans twisting the Word of God.    They ignore that Jesus taught to love; not to hate.    If you want to know what God really says and not what religion says I'd suggest picking up the Bible. But if that makes you skeptical then pick up a book by Donald Miller such as Blue Like Jazz. He'll explain what God is all about without all the religious stuff hindering what He wants us to know.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	No. Without God and the studying of His Word and without accepting Jesus free gift of salvation, you will not learn the difference between right and wrong and you will not be able to resist temptation or receive forgiveness or passage to heaven. Religion is the problem not the answer.    Religion is what people did that God specifically told us not to do which is not to be divided in what we are teaching that is supposed to be the true Word of God, but it is not. It is lies, the lies of man and satan and not of God.     1 Corinthians 1:10Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.    Religion and Christianity are not the same thing and are not on the same side of  God. Jesus started Christianity and the first church.    Acts 11:26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
8PjHFUdfaa	Saint Nicholas: aka Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Kriss Kringle, and so on...     The stories of Saint Nicholas date back to the 4th century, when he was a bishop in modern-day Turkey. Historical accounts of his life are a swirl of uncertainty, exaggeration, and speculation. Their commonality? Every tale of Saint Nicholas describes him as a kind, generous man who devoted his life to helping children.     Perhaps Saint Nicholas was born into a wealthy family and, to lead a pious life, joined the church. Having taken a vow of poverty, he might have given his fortune to children and families in need. Perhaps he roamed the countryside helping the sick. One story, popular in European folklore, tells how St. Nick saved three sisters from being sold into slavery by giving them each money for a dowry. Another accounts him surprising needy families by leaving gifts at their homes late on Christmas Eve and filling their stockings (hung to dry by the fire) with food.     A lesser known story explains why Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors. On a trip to Jerusalem, he prophecied and later prayed to end a maelstrom of catastrophic proportions. The sailors, certain they would have died had Nicholas not performed this miracle, began telling the story of this would-be saint. Other sailors claimed Saint Nicholas came to them in dreams, saving them from poverty and disaster. Because of the various miracles St. Nick performed, he is known as the patron saint of children, virgins, merchants and sailors. (He is also the patron of Russia.)     After his death on December 6th, the Catholic calendar reserved that day to celebrate the generous life of Saint Nicholas. In predominantly Catholic areas, there are often parades or feasts with ornate cakes and breads on December 6th.|`|wFsE6eqiaa	i heard he threw gold coins in people windows one night|`|047IPSovaa	is this a homework assignment?|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	He is Santa Clause.|`|0Qu4KJR8aa	well its farther christmas int it he went round giving kiddies gifts in the coldest of winters squeezing down chimneys if that ain't enough to get a saint hood what is|`|kY03DGeLaa	he became a saint when he started to deliver toys to all the poor children in town.. but then a cop stopped him & arrested him but they let him out a few years later when they new he was doing it for good.     he then became known as santa claus.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	He was a Turkish bishop.

Saint Nicholas, who rides on the rooftops, is the pagan god Wodan [Odin]. . . . Saint Nicholas was also the leader of the wild chase in which the souls of the dead visit the earth.  Yes, the Teutons believed that Odin, or Wodan, their chief god, led the souls of the dead on a furious cross-country ride during the twelve bad days between Christmas and Epiphany (January 6). The resulting gale carried along the seeds of the produce of the fields, stimulating fertility. The apples, nuts, and other autumn produce given around St. Nicholas Day? These were symbols of fertility. Ancient people believed that they could appease their gods by giving them presents during the cold, dark winter days. This would result in increased fertility for man, animal, and soil.  Odin was accompanied by his servant Eckhard, the forerunner of Black Peter, who also carried a rod. As recently as the Middle Ages, it was the popular belief that certain trees and plants could render humans fertile and that merely striking a woman with a branch of such a tree sufficed to make her pregnant.  The book Feest-en Vierdagen in kerk en volksgebruik (Holidays and Celebrations in the Church and in Popular Customs) mentions a few other similarities between Odin and Saint Nicholas: Wodan, too, filled the boots and wooden shoes placed by the chimney but with gold. For Wodans steed, hay and straw were also placed in the wooden shoe. The last sheaf of the field was also for the horse.  The book Sint Nicolaas, by B. S. P. van den Aardweg, points to a few other striking similarities:  St. Nicholas: a tall, powerful figure on a white horse. He has a long white beard, a crosier in his hand, and a miter on his head . . . with a wide, flowing bishops cloak.  Wodan: a person of tall stature with a white beard. He wears a wide-brimmed hat pulled deeply over his eyes. In his hand he holds a magic spear. He is clad in a wide mantle and rides his loyal gray horse Sleipnir.  There are more of these apparent similarities: Wodan rode his gray horse through the air and shuddering people offered cakes with filling in addition to meat and produce of the fields. St. Nicholas rides on the rooftops and children prepare hay, carrots, and water for the horse. Gingersnaps and the rod were symbols of fertility long before the beginning of the St. Nicholas festivities.  Jesus Christ said that true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth. (John 4:23) For sincere worshipers, Saint Nicholas customs present a real challenge: Will these worshipers continue to perpetuate the ancient practices of the Odin cult, or will they break free from vestiges of heathenism?    Greeting. Rapha?l.

Dios     Soy el Ocano del Amor;  Te muestro el camino del amor.  Mi amor permanece intacto y constante.  No me olvido de ninguno de vosotros.  Tengo tanto amor por vosotros,  y Mi amor es incondicional e ilimitado.  Soy el Bienamado.    Hace mucho tiempo que Me ests clamando.   ?Quin es Dios?  Estamos acostumbrados a conocer las cosas vindolas, oyndolas, probndolas, tocndolas y olindolas. La mayora de nosotros hemos crecido en una cultura materialista de ?si no lo veo, no lo creo? y estamos acostumbrados a percibir las cosas de este modo. Puesto que no podemos ver, or, probar, tocar u oler a Dios, surge la cuestin: ?de verdad existe Dios?  Uno puede llegar a Dios con pensamientos puros y as estar conectado a l. El alma experimenta como respuesta sentimientos puros y fortaleza espiritual. Dios es la verdad en s misma y, por ello, puede reconocerse con el ojo de la verdad.    Dios: El Alma Suprema  Igual que nosotros, Dios tambin es un alma. A diferencia de nosotros, se Le llama el Alma Suprema la nica alma que nunca adopta un cuerpo (fsico o sutil, humano o anglico) para S mismo. Est por encima de los efectos de las acciones y nunca est sometido a las dualidades de nacimiento y muerte, placer y dolor, xito y fracaso. Yendo ms all de los lmites del tiempo de este mundo fsico, l retiene el conocimiento absoluto del universo y todas sus dimensiones.    ?Dnde est Dios?  Dios vive, no en todas partes sino en algn lugar. Pensar en Dios casi siempre nos hace mirar hacia arriba, igual que si uno tal vez estuviera a la expectativa de que apareciera una cara milagrosamente por detrs de las nubes o que brillara por detrs de la luna. Los pensamientos son poderosos. Vinculan a un alma con otra. Si se canalizan correctamente, los pensamientos pueden llegar hasta donde slo el alma puede viajar ms all de la luna y las estrellas, a una dimensin de luz dorada y rojiza, el hogar original de todas las almas. Sumida en la experiencia del calor de esta luz, el alma se siente como si por fin estuviera en el hogar, con Dios.    Dios: el Sol Espiritual  Igual que el sol fsico, que da luz y vida indistintamente a todos los seres, Dios es el Sol Espiritual, que irradia luz a todos, sin importar con quin o dnde puedan estar. l ayuda de forma altruista, sin motivos egostas, recordando a cada uno sus cualidades innatas de amor, paz y felicidad. Por esto se Le ha recordado en algunos pases y culturas con el nombre de Shiva, el Benevolente.    La sabidura, el amor y el poder de Dios  La gente se pregunta por qu, si existe Dios, no agita una varita mgica y arregla las cosas  haciendo, o al menos influyendo en todos para que hagan, exactamente lo que ?deberan? hacer Dios nunca despoja a nadie de su libertad de eleccin. La sabidura de Dios consiste en reconocer y respetar la identidad individual, la libertad y la bondad inherentes de cada alma. Dios comparte el conocimiento una comprensin profunda de las dualidades y dilemas de amor y odio, felicidad y tristeza, victoria y derrota, etc.  pero no toma las decisiones por nosotros. El alma es libre de elegir ?ser o no ser?, ?amar o no amar?. El amor de Dios refuerza la voluntad del alma de liberarse de las angustias ocasionadas por malos hbitos como el deseo egosta, la ira, el miedo, el ego y el apego. El poder de Dios ayuda al alma a reconocer su potencial ms intenso y a buscar el objetivo de la perfeccin practicando el arte de la vida sencilla y el pensamiento elevado. Esta prctica llevada a cabo por un nmero significativo de almas finalmente aportar un cambio positivo en toda la humanidad.  Durante la meditacin, cuando aprendas a que tu mente est en sintona con la mente de Dios, entonces, sea cual sea tu situacin, siempre contars con una fuente de ayuda y fortaleza una reserva infinita de poder y virtudes a tu alcance, a la que podrs acceder con slo un pensamiento.|`|VK4yKGbuaa	Eu creio que sim.

015d777851f52f81334e18811eedbe24aa	Sim, mas quando Jesus aplica sua filosofia ele n?o estava fazendo nada de novo em rela??o aos seguidores da escola filosfica criada por Anthistenes seguidor de Scrates, a idia que a felicidade n?o  encontrada em bens materiais.  Entre seus seguidores temos o exemplo de Crtes de Tebas, Filsofo Cnico discpulo de Digenes de Snope,era conhecido como o abridor de portas pois todos gostavam de ouvir seus conselhos.    Vendeu tudo o que tinha para viver na pobreza de acordo com o modlo Cnico e ao lado de sua esposa. Caso seus filhos o acompanhassem, todo o dinheiro seria distribuido aos pobres.    Lucas 12 : 33  Vendei o que tendes, e dai esmolas. Fazei para vs bolsas que n?o se envelhe?am; tesouro nos cus que nunca acabe, aonde n?o chega ladr?o e a tra?a n?o ri.     Digenes de Snope foi discpulo de Anthstenes o fundador da filosofia Cnica. Tendo escrito a algum que lhe arranjasse uma casinha, e como tardasse a faz-lo, tomou como casa um tonel.    LUCAS 9, 58  E disse-lhe Jesus: As raposas tm covis, e as aves do cu, ninhos, mas o Filho do homem n?o tem onde reclinar a cabe?a.      Se a igreja vai contra esse tipo de filosofia, n?o estaria ela indo contra os ensinamentos de Jesus ?    Ainda em Lucas 11 22  E disse aos seus discpulos: Portanto vos digo: N?o estejais apreensivos pela vossa vida, sobre o que comereis, nem pelo corpo, sobre o que vestireis.   23  Mais  a vida do que o sustento, e o corpo mais do que as vestes.   24  Considerai os corvos, que nem semeiam, nem segam, nem tm despensa nem celeiro, e Deus os alimenta; quanto mais valeis vs do que as aves?   25  E qual de vs, sendo solcito, pode acrescentar um c?vado  sua estatura?   26  Pois, se nem ainda podeis as coisas mnimas, por que estais ansiosos pelas outras?   27  Considerai os lrios, como eles crescem; n?o trabalham, nem fiam; e digo-vos que nem ainda Salom?o, em toda a sua glria, se vestiu como um deles.   28  E, se Deus assim veste a erva que hoje est no campo e amanh?  lan?ada no forno, quanto mais a vs, homens de pouca f?|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	A verdade liberta.|`|31f6fa3ccfe85c7ee511bbdc00933245aa	PERFEITAMENTE APLICVEL NUM MUNDO CADA DIA MAIS ANTI-TICO.|`|cETRSkRZaa	sou

On the other hand, I've never given my dog chocolate, but he still wants to eat it every time he sees it, even though it would make him very sick and possibly kill him.

Prove it was designed then.  Without proof, what you think is irrelevant to the discussion.    You guys all seem to miss the point that for "intelligent design" to have any merit, there must be evidence FOR it -- to show that it's real.  It's not enough to poke a hole in evolution (though you do very poorly at that), because even if evolution is wrong, that doesn't mean ID is right.  It just means evolution is wrong, nothing more.

It is getting harder to tell the difference these days.  You appear to be a troll but I have seen honest questions of this caliber so I am reserving judgement.    Cats having a sense of smell is the reason they can differentiate food.    Edit:  I've seen some of your questions now and I am beginning to think you are for real.  The deciding factor for me was the question where you use the very common believer's misconception that evolution says man evolved from apes (which it doesn't).    Additional:  If the ability to detect food is 'god'-given and not evolutionary then animals would not be fooled by plastic chew toys which have food tastes and smells built in.  Evidence shows that they are fooled, which means that either the ability does not come from 'god' or your 'god' has made an (in your own words) FLAWED DESIGN.  Either way disproves intelligent design.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	You seem to have forgotten the cheeseburger is made of out red meat. The cat obviously knew that just by the smell.

Human anatomy has all the appearance of a fish which has been jerry-rigged as an upright walking mammal.  It's design is anything but intelligent.|`|g4nlUfmeaa	I'm not sure how to respond to this one, except by invoking Poe's Law.    Edit: OK, so it looks like you might be serious.    "living creatures know how to survive, our drive for survival couldn't have just evolved out of nowhere, hence why it is an indication that our ability to recognize food in all shapes and forms is from God"    You are correct to reason that instinct for survival couldn't have evolved out of "nowhere," but what you don't seem to realize is that nobody proposes that anything like that happens.    Every trait an organism has stems from a modification of a preexisting structure or feature.  The idea behind the theory of evolution is that when a creature reproduces (even very simple creatures, including viruses) it always doesn't produce a perfect duplicate of itself (in fact, it seldom does).  There is variation, due to DNA copying errors.  A structure is a little longer, or a little shorter, or manifests itself earlier or later in the creature's development, operates a little differently, or it's located in a slightly different spot relative to the rest of its body, or there's an extra one, etc.    If the change is detrimental to the creature's survival, it is more likely to die, and so it's less likely to pass on the gene for that trait.  If the trait is beneficial to its survival, the gene is more likely to occur more frequently in the population.  Over many generations, these changes accumulate and build on top of each other to eventually (over millions of years, or even briefer spans) generate a host of adaptive functions, and great complexity.    That is natural selection.  A creature which is ambivilent about eating, or lacks the necessary sensory apparatus to detect food or predators would quickly be removed from the gene pool -- unless the creature's environment changes in such a way that those traits are of less value.  A good example would be subterranean creatures that are blind, but still have eyes.  Since their eyes weren't helping their survival, and since it costs (in energy) to maintain all of the stuff that goes into a functioning eye, they gradually became blind (but the useless vestigial eyes remain -- it would be bad/stupid design to give a creature eyes that can't see and yet in nature we see many examples of that kind of suboptimal design).    This is not mere conjecture.  Natural selection is a well-observed law of biology.  Natural selection is so effective that human engineers sometimes incorporate it into their design processes (look up genetic programming).    There's a reason why pretty much every biologist, zoologist, geneticist, anthropologist, etc. subscribes to the theory of evolution (without muddling it up with ID), and it has nothing to do with social or political pressure.|`|SuWMjQOXaa	i can has chzbrgrz now?|`|R5IAmQAVaa	As evolution progressed, species with the best ability to survive did survive, and carried their traits on to their off spring.    Animal species that have no eyes would have a difficult time finding food, animals with no toungue would have a difficult time finding food, animals with no nose would have a hard time finding food, animals with no ears would have a hard time finding food....    There are animals that have no tongues, no noses, no ears, or no eyes, evolution has alowed those animal to exist because in their particular instance those features are not required.    In the cats case, evolution has led to the cat having all of those sensory features, because it can better survive with them.  They all play a benefit.  Over time, I'm certain that there have been cats born blind, deaf, and without the ability to smell and taste.... those cats died off becuase they didn't have the ability to survive.      Evolotion has led to all cats having eyes so they can see if something is food...and not something dangerous.  Evoloution has let to cats having a sense of smell so they can smell if something is food or something dangerous.  Evolition has led to cats haveing a sense of taste so they can taste if something is food or dangerous.  Evolition has lead to cats having ears so they can eat while being aware of nearby dangers.    Because of evolition, cats have acquired all of those abilities.  If intelligent design were the cause cats were what they were, then they would have adapted into so many different species.      It is well known that certian species of cats can not survie under all climates and under all conditions.  It is well known that the climate of this planet and its environmental conditions have changed drastically over time.  If Intelligent Design is responsible for cats, then once the environment changed, the cats would have become extinct.  But they havn't.  Because of evolution, they have became what they are today.|`|affb92500c4092ec6665779d8a952b58aa	You are really saying that because all of the animal world, including humans can smell if something is edible, is the reason a god must exists.

If a woman wants to have surgically enhanced breasts just to look bigger, this is not permitted; if she has had both breasts removed due to cancer and wants to have cosmetic reconstruction in order to look "normal", this is permissible.  Liposuction is not forbidden in and of itself.  Sometimes a person loses a lot of weight in a short time and needs to have excess skin removed and lifted.  A person might have a cleft lip and need surgery to repair that.  There are many instances where these "cosmetic" procedures are actually necessary.    Also, a woman  might have had something unnecessary done previously, but she repented of what she did.  What if when she was younger she had a nose job when her nose was perfectly fine, but she wanted her nose to look like Madonna's?  This is a vanity thing and would not have been permissible. But if she repents when she is older, she can't go get her old nose back.  There's a lot you have to know and one case will not be like another.    It is a personal situation and if a loved one is considering having a procedure, you can discuss it with her and see if it is of the permissible kind.  Then you can figure out what to do from there.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|hFxJ02NSaa	I can't think of any reason my wife would need to have cosmetic surgery unless it was to correct some sort of disability.

35bD2A1iaa	Estimado Karllus  A Igreja Catlica  a maior Igreja no Brasil, e chegou com os portugueses.    A segunda maior denomina??o religiosa, numericamente,  a Assemblia de Deus, que se organizou em 1911, com dois missionrios suecos que aqui chegaram em novembro de 1910.  Em 1910 foi constituda a Congrega??o Crist? no Brasil, sendo pioneiro Luigi (ou Louis ) Fracescon.  Mas voltemos ao sculo XIX, com a inser??o do chamado protestantismo histrico:  Luteranos - a partir de 1824 - A primeira comunidade luterana no Brasil foi organizada em Nova Friburgo (RJ) em 3 de maio de 1824. A partir de 1824 organizam-se comunidades luteranas no Rio de Janeiro (1827), em S. Leopoldo (RS), 1824,  em Santa Catarina (1850), etc.  Os Anglicanos organizam-se como denomina??o a partir de 1890.  As Igrejas congregacionais - a partir de 1855, chegada de Kalley ao Brasil.  As igrejas presbiterianas a partir de 1859 - chegada de Simonton - mas a denomina??o IPB se organiza em 1888 e a IPI (Igreja Presbiteriana Independente) em 1903.  A Igreja Metodista - segunda metade sculo XIX,  Igreja Batista - idem, mas a Conven??o Batista Brasileira foi organizada em 1907 e em 1967 formou-se a Conven??o Batista Nacional, um grupo de igrejas batistas pentecostais.  Voltando ao pentecostalismo e sculo XX.  Igreja Evanglica Avivamento Bblico - 1946.  Igreja do Evangelho Quadrangular - 1951.  Igreja "O Brasil para Cristo" - 1956.  Igreja Pentecostal Deus  Amor - 1962.  Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus - ,1977.  Igreja Internacional da Gra?a de Deus - 1980.   Igreja Renascer em Cristo - 1986.

259cf839be9e6e36b09a8d6aafd484f7aa	A rvore ser conhecida pelos frutos  N?o falo das Igrejas da Reforma, nada contra elas.  Falo das seitas milenaristas, sub-sub-produto da reforma prostestante.  A quest?o toda se prende  autoridade, S Sei, e  inten??o.  Nenhuma profecia  de particular interpreta??o,  o que nos alerta S.Pedro e ele completa dizendo, a n?o ser quando vinda de homens de Deus.  Os "homens de Deus" que Pedro se refere n?o s?o exatamente e exclusivamente os santos, mas aqueles que buscam o Cristo na sua essncia e em sinceridade, que  Amor e liberta??o.  Donde se conclui que toda autoridade decorre do Amor e n?o do dio e  exercida na liberdade e na mansid?o.  As seitas evangelicas se multiplicam atravs do livre exame.  Cada qual se julgando inspirado pelo Esp>Santo e apto para interpretar um Livro que de sentido explicito tem muito pouco.  A Biblia , em especial o Velho Testamento  uma coletanea de experincias de um povo com seu Deus, que agiu na Historia judaica de 5 milenios atrs de forma que ns n?o podemos compreender poque nossos olhos n?o viveram aquelas realidades.  E toda revela??o do Antigo s tem validade se puder ser lida a luz do Novo Testamento, que  Jesus na sua vida de amor e obla??o.  Entretanto algumas pessoas se julgando no direito de interpretar e ser anunciadores do evangelho cometem o erro basico que anula toda sua pseudo miss?o.  Agem com arrogancia, que tambm  prepotncia, baseados num fundamentalismo sem sentido que desconsidera a a??o de Deus  luz da miseicordia e do acolhiemnto do outro, veja o exemplo de Jeus acolhendo os publicanos e as prostitutas.  Alguns fazem da ideia de Deus ser uma mera proje??o de seus proprios desejos Humanos e escravo de suas vontades e interpreta??es.  A inten??o  que conta aqui, n?o a verdade por si s.  Ai v?o propalando suas verdades como se fossem as verdades de f.  O problema  que Verdade n?o  contraditria. Ela  unica e evidente por si s.  Mas n?o  isto que vemos na multiplicidade das seitas , vemos cada uma interpretando de forma particular a Verdade e induzindo seus crentes a fazer o mesmo.  Ai temos varias verdades cada uma dependendo n?o da sua Verdade, mas da inten??o , no destino para que  usada.  E a rvore ser conhecida pelos seus frutos.  E os frutos que vemos soltos por ai, n?o falam nada de bom da rvore que os produziu.  S?o frutos de discordia, de agress?es gratuitas e pessoais, de ofensas graves  liberdade humana ao bom senso e  inteligncia.

However the percentage that have read more than a couple of chapters (not even whole books but chapters) is much less.  The need for a theologically educated person to help these people understand difficult concepts is still there.    3) There is NO barrier to anyone wanting to obtain a theological education and becoming a theologian.  It's not like there is some form of discrimination preventing anyone from being educated.  One can be theologian without being a cleric.|`|ZIlUpooRaa	If by spiritual leaders you mean "apostles" or "prophets" then yes, the time for them has passed.  Before the Bible was written, God would raise up men and women to speak His word.  As evidence of their authority, He also gave them the ability to perform miracles.      We now have the complete revelation of God so there is no more need for people to let us know His will.  We have the Bible and that is sufficient.  There are still preachers and teachers, but nothing like the prophets of old.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Maybe...they all seem to be congregating on Y!

86218b3eee8a27ac46cd66ace3e43a3daa	If this be your reference of Rev. 13:, then the commentary is focused on your question:    (Re 13:1-2) .?.?.the sea. And I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and upon its horns ten diadems, but upon its heads blasphemous names. 2?Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were as those of a bear, and its mouth was as a lions mouth. And the dragon gave to [the beast] its power and its throne and great authority.    *** it-1 p. 267 Beasts, Symbolic ***    "From time immemorial, mankind has observed the characteristics and habits of animals and has applied them in a figurative or symbolic sense to persons, peoples, governments, and organizations. The Bible makes good use of this effective means of illustration. Examples pertaining to the figurative use of the qualities residing in an animal, or suggested by its characteristics, are listed in the accompanying charts.    --Beasts as Symbols of Governments.   Certain major world powers of history appear directly in the Biblical record, and all of these, as well as other nations, have used animals as symbols of their governments. In Egypt, the serpent figured prominently, the uraeus, the sacred asp, appearing on the headdress of the Pharaohs. However, Egypt was also represented by the bull, as was Assyria. Medo-Persia used the eagle (the shields of the Medes bore the golden eagle; the Persians bore an eagle fixed to the end of a lance). Athens was designated by the owl; Rome, the eagle; Great Britain is designated by the lion; the United States, the eagle. From the most remote times China has been symbolized by the dragon. Well known are the Russian bear and the German two-headed eagle.    --The Wild Beasts of Daniel and of Revelation.   That the beasts described in these books represent political kingdoms or governments, exercising rulership and authority, is clearly stated. (Da 7:6, 12,?23; 8:20-22; Re 16:10; 17:3, 9-12) A consideration of the Biblical passages reveals that, while these political wild beasts vary in symbolic form, yet all have certain characteristics in common. All are shown as standing in opposition to Gods rule by the Messianic Kingdom over mankind. They are also depicted as in opposition to Gods holy ones, his covenant people, first the Jewish nation, then the Christian congregation. Those specifically named (Medo-Persia and Greece) were major world powers, and the great size attributed to the others or the description of their actions indicates that these too were not minor kingdoms. (It may be noted that subordinate kingdoms are symbolized by horns in some cases.) All the beasts are represented as very aggressive, seeking the dominant position over the nations or peoples within the reach of their power.Compare Da 7:17, 18,?21; 8:9-11, 23,?24; Re 13:4-7,?15; 17:12-14.    Many commentators endeavor to limit the fulfillment of the visions of the beasts in the book of Daniel so that it does not extend beyond the time when Jesus Christ was on the earth, at which time the Roman Empire was the dominant power. The prophecies themselves, however, make plain that they extend beyond that time. The final forms of the beasts are shown as reaching down to the arrival of the definite time for Gods holy ones to take possession of the kingdom in the appointed time of the end. Then the Messiah destroys such beastly opposition for all time. (Da 7:21-27; 8:19-25; compare also Re 17:13,?14; 19:19,?20.) It may be noted that Christ Jesus expressly foretold that opposition to the Messianic Kingdom would continue into the time of the end, so that his disciples then preaching that Kingdom would be objects of hatred by all the nations. (Mt 24:3, 9-14) This obviously does not allow for any nation, particularly world powers, to be excluded from possible identification with the final forms or expressions of the symbolic wild beasts".|`|g54tGcRvaa	Wow, nobody mentioned C'thulu yet.

cHfz7iPDaa	you saw how stupid they were on the last question so that should explain it|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	Hello,  Very often it is necessary to refer back to the original Manuscripts to  get the fuller thought.      The "House of Israel" consists of the ten tribes of Israel (that would  mean MINUS Judah with Benjamin, and the Levitical Priest line).  These ten tribes after release from their captivity with Assyria, migrated  North over the Caucus Mountains being known as "caucasions"; they  settled the Isles, Europe and then made their way eventually to the United States, Canada -  they basically make up the free Christian  Nations in existance today.  Example: The Tribe of Dan settled in a   place they called the "Mark of Dan" or Danmark; however, you might  recognize it by its modern name: Denmark.    Jeremiah 31:27 begins by saying that the day will come when God  will bring all of the Tribes back together once again like they were  in the beginning, but this is FUTURE to where we are today.  These verses all the way through verse 40, all describe the 1000-yr  millenial period that Christ ushers in upon his return; it is at that time  that all the Tribes will be joined, all souls will be back in the spiritual  body and Christ will be present -  so, you won't have to ask someone  if they know Christ because everyone will know who he is.  At that  time, the Ordinances of God be followed or else you won't exist -  and remember: this 1000-yr period is the final time to straighten up  before the Great White Throne Judgement.  All those who don't make  it at the Judgement will be destroyed in the Lake of Fire.  The final  age that we call the "eternity", does not come in until after that millinium and after the Judgement.    The valley of the dead bodies in verse 40 refers to the fact that when  Christ returns we change back into Spiritual bodies; all that flesh will  be the Supper of the great scavenger birds.    There will be nothing left for the eternity, that offends.   God is preparing and forming the final Great Family of God.     This Covenant bringing both Houses back together  does not occur until the "Day of the Lord" or "The Lords Day"  which is a 1000 year period that begins the day Christ returns.      The very word "denomination" means "division".  In this generation  there is so much that is NOT Biblical that is being taught and labeled  "truth" and yet it simply isn't written.  People are told that the New   Testament replaces the Old: FALSE.  They are told that the Passover  is for Jews: FALSE.  They are told that the Book of Revelation is a mystery not meant to be understood:  FALSE  (the word "revelation" itself means to "uncover, unveil and make known").  They are told  they don't need to understand the Book of Revelation anyway, or the  Prophets for that matter, because after all, they're gonna be raptured:  FALSE.  What is being taught in the Churches today is very, very little of what  is actually written in the Scriptures, and its being beaten to death - taught over and over again to where many people don't know whats  really in the Scriptures and what isn't.  In Revelation 1, Gods sends a message to each of 7 Churches; out  of the 7, only TWO of them are approved by God, and both those churches teach the exact same thing: "Who are they who say they  are jew but do lie and are of the Synagogue of Satan"?  After searching for over 35 years, I have found ONE SINGLE CHURCH  that teaches the answer to that question;  yet, God doesn't even approve of any of the ones who don't teach it.  Right there is prophecy  come to pass in this generation.  And guess what:  if you don't know  the answer to that question, then I guarantee you that you do not  have an understanding of the rest of the Scriptures; its THAT important.  You would think people would want to be in a Church that is at least  approved of by the very God they worship, but many don't have any  idea what I'm even talking about.  The Great Deception is coming and  most people are already set-up to be deceived because the Churches  do not have a teacher for the congregation who can handle the languages and the Manuscripts and so the majority of people are  simply not being taught.  THATS WHY WE HAVE that millinium   period of teaching.  Christ is fair and so anyone who honestly had  no chance in hell of learning the truth, will have that chance before  the Judgement.

I wondered why I had to go through some things I went through. I felt it seemed harsh and I wondered if anyone else went through it even though it was for my own good. But as I was thinking I thought about Job and how righteous he was. Yet he suffered physically and spiritually even worse than me for nothing. When I look at how my righteousness stacks up against Job and the fact that I suffered because of my own actions, I thought I dare not question God's actions or authority. Its tough to understand because we dont think on God's level. Its almost like when you put your son on punishment or give him a spanking. It seems harsh but later on he may understand why you did it. But he's staying in your house and under your roof. Who is he to ask you questions about how he is to be disciplined? So likewise when I dont listen to God sometimes I get disciplined, but it does say those he loves he disciplines. So Im not a illegitimate child at least.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	no way!  He is God .

yHSREpVLaa	 porque j numa poca remota, a igreja de Roma tornou-se a maior, a mais rica e a mais respeitada de toda a cristandade ocidental. Outro fator que contribuiu para a ascendncia da igreja romana e do seu lder foi a prpria centralidade e importancia da capital do Imprio Romano. Ao Bispo de Roma foi concedida a precedncia honorria simplesmente porque Roma era ent?o a capital poltica do mundo, ele foi considerado "o primeiro entre os iguais".   O Papado como conhecemos, desenvolveu-se gradativamente, sustentado a princpio pelo Imprio Romano; n?o teve data de nascimento, n?o foi institudo por Cristo nem pelas igrejas,  intruso no Cristianismo e n?o se enquadra na Bblia  conseguiu com sutileza manter-se na posi??o que ocupa.  identificado na Bblia como " Ponta Pequena " (Daniel 7.8). A igreja romanista recebeu o nome de catlica no Concilio de Constantinopla, presidido pelo imperador Romano Teodsio com o decreto "Cunctos Populos" no ano de 381.  Apostlica ela n?o ; Os apstolos nunca rezaram para santos mortos e nem recomendaram esta prtica. Os apstolos nunca saram em prociss?o carregando esttuas de barro. Tambm n?o sabemos como ela pode ser Universal e Romana ao mesmo tempo. .   Igreja Catlica significa "Igreja Universal". E apesar deste apelido ter sido usado pela primeira vez em 170 pelo bispo de Cartago, referindo-se a todas as igrejas crist?s, ela n?o tinha a idealiza??o que tem hoje. Este nome come?ou a ganhar for?a a partir de 313 quando as igrejas erradas aceitaram ser servas do imperador. O catolicismo romanista come?ou a tomar forma quando no ano 325 o Imperador Romano Constantino, convertido ao Cristianismo, convocou o 1o Conclio das igrejas que foi dirigido por Hsia Crdova com 318 bispos presentes. Os historiadores viram nele "O papado emergindo das runas do imprio romano que desintegrava herdando dele o autoritarismo e o latim como lngua." A palavra "Papa" significa pai, assim como Padre.; Mas a Bblia diz: "A ningum sobre a terra chameis vosso pai; porque s um  vosso Pai, aquele que est nos cus." (Mateus 23.9). O Vaticano n?o  igreja, mas sim um organismo poltico-religioso que arrogando certas prerrogativas se interp?e entre Deus e os verdadeiros crist?os, conservando-os sob sujei??o; certos telogos vem no Vaticano "O esprito do imprio romano com roupagens do cristianismo."

Dimi8By2aa	Let's see a picture. You probably don't look THAT bad. But I felt the same way you did when I was 13 - I HATED Valentine's day. At school, all the girls were walking around with tons of flowers and candy. And what did I get? Nothing at all. It killed me inside. :/    I just looked at your myspace - and you're gorgeous. Don't listen to people. :)|`|gsw5uCw4aa	Honey, 1st off i want to start by telling you, you are as Beautiful as anyone else.  I didn't look at your my space pics and i have no in tensions too.  You have soooo many more Valentines ahead of you to get a date. 2nd, You need to have more self confidence, how you perceive yourself is how others will see you too.  Walk with your head up, shoulders back; no one can see your face if you walk around looking at the floor.  And last, if your too shy to talk to a boy right now, i have news for you, its ok, you along with every other 13 year old boy and girl right now are going through the same thing...believe it or not!  i have 2 teenagers right now that are going through the same thing and i once was there too, even though im a generation older than you doesn't mean i didn't feel the same way. yes times have changed but the feelings of growing up dont.   Im not saying put yourself out there by all means, thats a big mistake, im saying is that you have plenty of time to grow up!  kisses and i wish you all the best of luck!!|`|jtjISk6qaa	i didnt have a valentine until i was a sophomore in high school. its depressing i know. =[|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	WOW WORLD'S TINIEST VIOLIN!|`|e158WyFGaa	YOU ARE VERY PRETTY F*** ANYONE WHO HATES HER!|`|M3CsxF2jaa	NO YOU ARE PRETTY AND WHO CARES WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS

Yep, I know, it's a whacked-up religion.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Unfortunately that is what is being preached just call on the name or believe on Jesus and you will be saved,the Bible does not advocate this.We have to do the works of Christ,we have to show through our deeds and actions that we are his servants.  One command that he gave is to Love one another John 13:35  Another was to Preach the Good News of his Kingdom Matthew 24:14  John 14:21  He who has my commandments and observes them,he is the one that loves me.  Hordes of people claim they are going to heaven,not so it takes more than saying I believe.Revelation 20:4  You have to repent turn around and do the works that he did.Not an easy thing.That is why so few truly are followers of Christ,but in name only.

But, your sins are not forgiven until you accept Jesus Christ into you life. Simply believing in God will not take away your sins nor get you to heaven. You have to accept the Son before you can get to the Father.      John 14:6  Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	I think you did never read HEBREWS 12:14. Go there and read.|`|AA10902132	Jesus never had a life to give up, he's a fictional character.|`|9btru19waa	Rom 7:4 So this is the point: The law no longer holds you in its power, because you died to its power when you died with Christ on the cross. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, you can produce good fruit, that is, good deeds for God.         Rom 7:5 When we were controlled by our old nature, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced sinful deeds, resulting in death.         Rom 7:6 But now we have been released from the law, for we died with Christ, and we are no longer captive to its power. Now we can really serve God, not in the old way by obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way, by the Spirit.         Rom 7:7 Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is evil? Of course not! The law is not sinful, but it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, "Do not covet." [fn]         Rom 7:8 But sin took advantage of this law and aroused all kinds of forbidden desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power.         Rom 7:9 I felt fine when I did not understand what the law demanded. But when I learned the truth, I realized I had broken the law and was a sinner, doomed to die.         Rom 7:10 So the good law, which was supposed to show me the way of life, instead gave me the death penalty.         Rom 7:11 Sin took advantage of the law and fooled me; it took the good law and used it to make me guilty of death.         Rom 7:12 But still, the law itself is holy and right and good.         Rom 7:13 But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my doom? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God's good commandment for its own evil purposes.         Rom 7:14 The law is good, then. The trouble is not with the law but with me, because I am sold into slavery, with sin as my master.         Rom 7:15 I don't understand myself at all, for I really want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do the very thing I hate.         Rom 7:16 I know perfectly well that what I am doing is wrong, and my bad conscience shows that I agree that the law is good.         Rom 7:17 But I can't help myself, because it is sin inside me that makes me do these evil things.         Rom 7:18 I know I am rotten through and through so far as my old sinful nature is concerned. No matter which way I turn, I can't make myself do right. I want to, but I can't.         Rom 7:19 When I want to do good, I don't. And when I try not to do wrong, I do it anyway.         Rom 7:20 But if I am doing what I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing it; the sin within me is doing it.         Rom 7:21 It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.         Rom 7:22 I love God's law with all my heart.         Rom 7:23 But there is another law at work within me that is at war with my mind. This law wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me.         Rom 7:24 Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin? [fn]         Rom 7:25 Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.
r8qJecrMaa	Whatever!  However, whether consensual sex or not, it cannot be denied that, having stuck a bun in her oven, the dirty old bastard then buggered off leaving Mary to bring up the kid with poor old Joseph picking up the tab!  Then where is he when the boy gets into trouble with the law?  F***ing nowhere in sight!  What sort of parental example is that to set?  What a crap father!|`|gQqO1sPxaa	Hi,   Actually, she did not give consent because at first she didn't even know she was pregnant. She had done nothing to get herself pregnant, hence she was called the Virgin Mary. However, it is said in the bible that God chose her as the one to carry his son so he (with his godly powers supposedly) made her pregnant, which in turn made her family and village shocked and angry with her, thinking that she had lost her virginity, while in fact, she had not, she was just chosen by God to carry his child. I've heard that she actually had a vision where she talked with God and he informed her of what he had did--but she is fully consented once realizing what was inside of her as they were extremely God-driven and religious back in that era. I believe the term for it is Virgin Conception. Also, a quick side note if you are interested, scientists have discovered some species of tree frogs that are female that can become pregnant without the male sperm and thus, without having sex! In other words, this topic has been being discussed for decades! Hope this helps!|`|2sxiHRvzaa	yes it is a shocking slur on the lord god.true though|`|06Z3fh4laa	It wasn't rape, it was just surprise buttsex.|`|cLgghhuXaa	She gave consent...Luke 1:38... the angel came to tell her about it and she replied saying, "May it be as you have said."|`|IHa6FxE6aa	God raped her.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You haven't read the pericope.

An angel visited her and explained to her that she would conceive a son by the power of the Holy Spirit. She would carry and give birth to this child and she would name him Jesus.  At first Mary was afraid and troubled by the angel's words. Being a virgin, Mary questioned the angel, "How will this be?" The angel explained that the child would be God's own Son and, therefore, "nothing is impossible with God." Humbled and in awe, Mary believed the angel of the Lord and rejoiced in God her Savior.     If you'll notice at first Mary was afraid and troubled, being a virgin...Then as she understood the words of the angel, she was humbled and awed and rejoiced......  To answer your question...Yes, God came to her by an angel..and yes, she did agree to have the baby named Jesus....if you want more particulars...by her rejoicing..that was her agreement. By God sending an angel, he was asking...Mary had not been impregnated yet....your next question should be....Why did God pick Mary?|`|LzldiWLraa	Your name is seasnake so you are working with the devil?

MDKvwLT1aa	I have had many personal experiences,,,I think we have a spirit in our home now.  I do not feel scared by them , I usually  speak gently when I feel it around,  I was touched yesterday on the back while I cleaned, very gently...I believe its an older female,  My daughters and I experience smells out of nowhere as well.  I have seen many flashes of light, where there is no explanation.  The other members of the family are freaked out by such stuff, my eldest the most bothered,  She has experienced door slamming and voices that were not friendly, mostly in our last house.

All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...    I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...    About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...    I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...  In Light... )O(|`|7bd794308643a48ae46003172864a1f5aa	I have stayed in two supposedly haunted houses, nothing inexplicable happened in either of them.|`|YGvKisOoaa	No i don't. In elementary school I did and I was convinced this ghost was following me around everywhere. I saw it once in my house hallway, and again at the playground at school. I thought it took one of my stuffed animals, and I was trying to find out how to get it back lol. I obsessed over the "ghost" for like three weeks. Then I found out the stuffed animal was at my cousins haha. I was an odd child ;) But I do enjoy writing and reading ghost stories :D|`|DlvVvckcaa	I might have.  I've heard scratching sounds inside my walls before, at two different apartment complexes.  And I can pretty much assure you the sound wasn't rats.|`|LLqTeW70aa	Yes  My mother stayed with us  at her father in laws vicarage. That house built 1697 is situated on an old Viking grave site and is haunted.  When i was about 2 years old my mother and a friend of her heard someone walking in the gravel on the front yard.  Next they heard somebody walking upstairs to the bedroom where I and my twin brother slept.  When we suddenly started to scream she and her friend with a frying pan as a weapon run upstairs they found us hysterical.  My memory of the incident is that there were something in the room that was breathing.  And I was  terribly afraid.   My mother who before that din did not  believe in ghost  told what has happened some days later to one of my uncles. His answer was-. Did you not know that this house is haunted? Later we heard that our grandfather( a vicar) that passed away some years before had experienced some odd things earlier on another vicarage.  Another odd experience was when I was about 15 years old. O lived a bit outside downtown and one night after a cinema i decided to Take shortcut over a big graveyard. I was not afraid of ghosts. The I saw some lights and decided to see what it was. The lights were by and opened grave. By it a funeral car has stopped.. Four men went out and took out a coffin which was sunk down in the grave. After they had left i looked down in the grave and there was a brown coffin.  I thought that it was a secret burial and was curious. Just in order to find the place next day I chekced the surroundings and saw that the grave beside had a big white angel as a gravestone.  Next day I went back to the grave with the angel. But there were no sign av a burila or a newly opened grave. I looked for several days but with no results. Still today I have not found any explanation. May be there was a secret burial but qwhyno signs what so ever?|`|bMuwuAVOaa	My story is a bit long for this format so I will give you a link to the story of my ghost encounter...http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-GbKj1XQ8e...
wRiVVOwnaa	In Anne A s version are still mistakes. Here is the entire corrected text:    Ich besuche ein Gymnasium nur fr M?dchen. Es hei?t AGGS, und es befindet sich in der Stadtmitte nicht weit von den Gesch?ften; das gef?llt mir, weil die Stadt echt sch?n ist. Auch finde ich, dass das sehr praktisch ist, weil ich in der Stadtmitte wohne. Es gibt 1500 Schlerinnen und 80 Lehrerinnen; das hat mir nicht so gut gefallen, weil das ein bisschen zu gro? fr mich ist. Aber AGGS ist ziemlich altmodisch. Es wurde 1901 gegrndet. Ich glaube, dass es wirklich alt ist, und das gef?llt mir, weil es Geschichte hat. Meine Schule beginnt um sieben Uhr und endet um halb vier Uhr. Ich finde, dass das nicht so schlecht ist, weil ich gern zur Schule gehe, aber meine ideale Schule wrde um 10 Uhr beginnen und um 2 Uhr enden. Es sollte weniger Hausaufgaben geben, weil ich zu wenig Zeit fr Hobbys habe. Jedoch verstehe ich mich gut mit den Lehrern und meinen Klassenkameradinnen, denn sie sind so freundlich und lieb. Ich finde es auch gut, dass es viele gute AGs nach dem Unterricht gibt; man kann alles machen: Musik, Theater, Kunst, Sport und vieles mehr!    Frher gab es eine furchtbare Turnhalle. Das hat mir gar nicht gefallen, denn sie war zu klein und zu alt. Auch gab es ein gro?es aber schmutziges Schwimmbad. Jetzt gibt es eine neue, moderne Turnhalle und ein sauberes Schwimmbad, und das gef?llt mir, weil es besser als vorher ist. Auch ist es toll fr die Sport-AGs!    Ich lerne Naturwissenschaften, Mathe, Deutsch, Kunst und Geschichte. Ich finde, dass es ziemlich toll ist, weil Englisch und Kunst meine Lieblingsf?cher sind, obwohl ich Naturwissenschaften schrecklich finde. N?chstes Jahr werde ich die Mittlere Reife machen, und ich freue mich darauf, weil ich auf die Uni gehen m?chte.    Meine Schuluniform gef?llt mir, weil sie bequem und nicht zu h?sslich ist. Sie besteht aus einem blauen Pullover, einem wei?en Hemd und einem blauen Rock mit schwarzen Schuhen. Das finde ich ausgezeichnet! Die Schule ist auf Sport spezialisiert; es gibt eine moderne Turnhalle und ein gro?es Schwimmbad, und es gibt auch viele Sport-AGs. Ich finde es gut, dass AGGS so sportlich ist.

JMOLRKRraa	Fear of God is the beginning of Wisdom, fear is a respect, He is awesome and powerful, and all powerful and He is God.  Now, He is also a loving Father. You accept Him as Your God, let Him accept you as His daughter. How would you treat your daughter. You have to embrace yourself, your child part to you as well.   Forgive and forget about your physical father.  Would you want your daughter to ask you for a pretty dress, a doll a toy? Would you like to see the delight in her face, the joy and laughter when you are able to give her her hearts delight. And you would give her what is good for her, what would not hurt her. You would not give her a sword, or knife set at age four. But you would give her a doll. You would want her to talk to you, love you, hug you, visit you. Tell you what she wants for Christmas, for her birthday. How she feels, what makes her happy, and sad. What she is afraid of. Would you yell at her, punish her for coming to see you?   This is what God wants to do for you, his daughter, whom he loves very much.  I think at times I go sit in His lap, rest in His arms, or say hi and give Him a kiss on the cheek. We can walk boldly into our Father's throne room, that's Dad.    I just heard Joyce Meyers preaching on this yesterday. She said the first message God told her to preach was God loves you. She told God she wanted to preach a more powerful message. God responded, but they don't know I love them. She even had trouble with it. She told herself repeatedly over a year God loved her. looked into the mirror and said to herself, God loves you. Eventually it went from her head into her spirit. Truly God loves you. You don't do anything on purpose to hurt or offend or curse God. you do your best. You are good., If your child makes a mistake, then what. Are you going to cast the child into the depths of the forest. No , you are going to teach her, and let the child try again.|`|yMqWvG8naa	Brian is critically hit by wall of text    Brian dies|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	My best advice to you is to get into bible study.  Why?  This is where you come to know the character of God.  You feel the way you do about God because you have misinformation about the way He relates to us.  You need to see God as the way He is; loving and kind, merciful and compassionate, eager to give good things to His children.  But you cannot know this until you come to know Him.    Study the person of Jesus Christ.  "If you have seen me," Jesus said, "you have seen the Father".  You have really got yourself in a straight jacket with regard to who God is, and you have no need to be there.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	im doubting what youre saying....relax  pray for salvation....and repent|`|DRSv6SOLaa	He also said to "Fear Not"!

It is good to have a healthy fear and respect of the Lord Our God.  He is Our King and we should come before Him as such.

If this is true, what are you afraid of? How can you use the wrong "words" if he sees whats in your heart? In fact, why BOTHER to use words of any kind since he simply knows your thoughts and feelings ahead of time? Doesn't that make sense? I mean this is getting ridiculous. God either knows your mind and heart and intentions etc, or He DOESN'T. If he does, then what are you worrying about? If he DOESN'T, then he's not an all-knowing god to begin with, right?    You don't need prayer, you need to talk to someone about your insecurity and lack of self-esteem.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	Scripture teaches that Christians have the Holy Spirit to guide there prayers and interpret them for God.

You have a misconception of who God is. You said you believed that God is caring and loving, but I don't think you really believe this. Would someone loving and caring condemn you for saying something wrong. No way! Be free to express what you are going through with God. He wants you to be free and comfortable with Him. You have a relationship with Jesus and this means that you can talk to Him what you are going through. This is the very reason why He came and died for our sins. Be free to be who are before your Lord and Savior. chalinesheart@yahoo.com|`|alweKUW9aa	next time write less!!!  praying is a way go get a connection with God or in supernatural spirits o whatever...it helps you in facing you life and your mind fees opend, free, empty....|`|yugLcDE2aa	When our focus is on God and not on self, it becomes much easier to pray. Spend time praising Him and worshiping Him. Make Him the center of prayer... He sends His Holy Spirit to teach us to pray, and what to pray for.    26 And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say; 27 And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.   Romans 8:25-27 (BBE)
UmjJmYsjaa	Biblicly speaking, no, there is no after life, despite what Christendom says the bible says that there is no afterlife    (Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.

iHDYncuXaa	Sure. I did! I was baptized twice before believing, once as a Catholic at infancy and another time to join a church before I became born again. The third time I did it for the right reason. To make a statement of my faith in Christ.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	The Nicene Creed:    I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.    And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.    Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.    And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.    And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.    This says on baptism for the remission of sins...you don't need to be re-baptized, just repent and re-dedicate your life to Christ.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Ugh! Jeez.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I don't see why unless you are formally looking to follow with a denominational church. You've been baptised, so if you consent to the one that was done, I see no reason to do it over.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Baptist should only be for those who believe.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Yes.  Do it right this time.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Acts 2:38 Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.    That is the proper order.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Baptism is the outward expression of an inward decision. If you didnt decide to be saved when you were baptized then it was for nothing.|`|d1372da2f003c93deb4aa8328efee51eaa	yes|`|stAeoUeSaa	Hmmm...   If you're weren't really saved at the time then it was no different from your average bath or swim I think.  Doing it again couldn't hurt.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	You can be.  But just understand what water baptism is not.  Water baptism cannot save, water baptism is not required for salvation, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation. Water baptism also cannot wash away any sins.      Water baptism is a celebration that a person is ALREADY saved by Jesus  :)     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|LG1IkLUJaa	I guess you should because you really didn't know the meaning of  being baptized. talk to your pastor or head of your church.|`|luwBPdE8aa	I think it would be ok to get rebaptized.  Many people do.  Also read about baptism in Acts chapters 2, 8, 10, and 19 and find a preacher that will baptize you that way.  The first century Christians never used Matthew 28:19 for a baptismal formula (Peter was right there with Jesus when he gave the commandment about baptism, and people today think they understand Jesus better than Peter did; I don't.)|`|RermzbWgaa	No.  Baptism is a sign of Christianity.  If baptized as a infant it was your family declaring you a Christian.  It was a mark of your religion much like circumcision is to the Jew.    Even though you went other directions....you came back to your root.    If men had to be re-baptized every time they sinned or fell away...don't you think the Bible would say so clearly?  And would that not require us all to be daily re-baptized?  Does Christ need to be put back onto a cross continually or is just once enough for our sins?|`|pakIAYWoaa	for sure ..I was reading about Jesus being baptized yesterday and found it so cool that Jesus set the example though He was sinless for us. He had the Holy Spirit descend and the Father called out from heaven this is my son in whom I am well pleased...We are now sons of God redeemed with a price and have the Spirit of God in us, the same voice calls out to you ,this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.. baptism is an outward sign of your death to sin and ressrection on the newness of life; that which is born of Spirit is spirit.

Baptism is hardly the first step... regularly snacking on Jesus is the second... and finally the most important step is PAYING your tithes and offering on time, as promised and in FULL -- NO RAIN CHECKS... or God the Holy Ghost will get real p*ssed off at you!    You probably heard the name of "SLAUGHTER HOUSE RELIGION" given to Christianity. ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the salvation package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have eternal life     John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.    It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the host and wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL meat and blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews!      1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died).    The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldnt stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit as the dignified spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world while grotesquely hanging nailed to a Holy Cross! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus spit flavored meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die!|`|IGDfhp3naa	If you feel lead to get re-baptized then you should if not, then dont worry about it.|`|04eaa3b707fecc377d89a52d2fb4afa9aa	Regretting your past is not a reason to get baptized. Are there any other reasons? What has changed other than you have learned more about life through your experiences?|`|zUlkZ1Jqaa	Baptism in the Bible- is an outward obediance that indicates to all present that you have decided to follow Jesus as your Saviour and that you have made a change in the direction of your life.If you have done this then you need to be baptized, because until a cognitive decision on your part to follow the Lord, baptism has no real signifigance. You can be baptized til the fish know you on sight, but until you decide to take and apply your head knowledge into true heart-knowledge then it reall has no meaning. May God bless you|`|Q2aikWjUaa	Roman Catholic Christians among other denominational Christians, e.g., Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans, etc., believe in the efficacy and practice of baptizing infants.   Acts 2:38-39   Peter (said) to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the holy Spirit. For the promise is made to you and to your children and to all those far off, whomever the Lord our God will call."   The New Testament speaks of the baptism of "whole households" which in the normal Greek usage of the time included children.   1 Cor 1:16   I (Paul) baptized the household of Stephanas also ...   Acts 11:13-14   He related to us how he had seen (the) angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.'   Acts 16:15   After she (Lydia of Thyatira) and her household had been baptized, she offered us an invitation...   Acts 16:30-32   Then he (the jailer) brought them (Paul and Silas) out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you and your household will be saved." So they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to everyone in his house.   Acts 18:8   Crispus, the synagogue official, came to believe in the Lord along with his entire household.   To the Colossians, Paul paralleled baptism and circumcision. Circumcision was normally administered to children eight days after birth.   Col 2:11-12   In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not administered by hand, by stripping off the carnal body, with the circumcision of Christ. You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.   To the Corinthians, Paul recalled that just as all the Jews of the Exodus (including children) were baptized into Moses by passing through the Red Sea, they were actually being blessed by Christ.   1 Cor 10:1-4   I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, and all of them were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the Christ.   In Mark's Gospel, we have Jesus' own teaching on children.   Mk 10:13-16And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." ... Then he embraced them and blessed them, placing his hands on them.   The Roman Catholic Church teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation after the promulgation of the Gospel for everyone, both children and adults.   Jn 3:5   Jesus answered (Nicodemus), "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."   It is frequently asked by non-believers how an infant is capable of making an act of faith in order to receive baptism. The response of the Catholic Church is to follow the Biblical example of Christ. Jesus accepted the faith of others as an occasion of salvation, forgiveness and healing of another. The Church has always done likewise. In infant baptism, the faith of parents and sponsors is required.   Mk 2:1-5   When Jesus returned to Capernaum ... They came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. Unable to get near Jesus because of the crowd, they opened up the roof above him. After they had broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven."   Mt 8:5-13   When he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him and appealed to him, saying, "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering dreadfully." He said to him, "I will come and cure him." The centurion said in reply, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof; only say the word and my servant will be healed." ... When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Amen, I say to you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith." ... And Jesus said to the centurion, "You may go; as you have believed, let it be done for you." And at that very hour (his) servant was healed.   The constant teaching of the Church attests to the baptism of infants.   Pope Zosimus (417 - 418)   Approved a teaching of a local council at Carthage which condemned those who denied baptism to newborn infants.   Pope Celestine I (422 - 432)   Taught that both children and infants need the sacrament of regeneration.   Pope Innocent II (1130 - 1143) and the Council of Lateran IV   Condemned those who denied the baptism of children.   Pope Innocent III (1198 - 1216)   Condemned those who said that baptism of children was useless.   Pope Clement V (1305 - 1314) in the Council of Vienne   Defended the necessity of baptism of children.   Pope Eugene IV (1431 - 1447) in the Council of Florence   Defended the necessity of baptism of children.   The Council of Trent (1545 - 1563)   In a number of related canons, defined the absolute necessity of baptism for both children and adults.|`|G3vJ5eflaa	I was the same. I was baptized and received all the sacraments, except sick, from catholic church. In mid-teens, I questioned my faith and turned away from God. Fortunately, I kept some belief that He was there and spoke with Him on occasion. OK, usually when I screwed up but I talked with Him. After my 1st marriage tanked, I was given my present wife by God and came back to my faith.     It is stronger now than it ever has been! I can honestly say that I am happy in my current situation- no job, wife, 2 kids, gonna lose the house, but at complete peace. We receive what we need to survive and nothing more, and I still have enough to give to God.     Yes, I would get re-dedicated to God by a second baptism. I did this when I moved to CA and became stronger in my faith. The Holy Spirit convicted me to rededicate myself to God.|`|73n1SExgaa	Yea only if you did not mean it when you were baptized. Other than that repent and change get right with God again and live for him.

I'd make sure it's a real commitment for life this time though, because otherwise you may as well get dunked every week or whenever the mood hits.  Who says you won't fall away again...and again?    If God is in charge of your baptism, then I think He would have been effective enough the first time around.|`|tg8QzDv4aa	that all depends on how you look at it. if you think that you should get re baptized then you should do so. but that is a personal decision you have to make.|`|MZ9UaIYEaa	No sir, baptism was only for early Christians, mostly Jews. People do it today as an act of performance to try to earn salvation. The ceremony itself is blasphemous because it suggests that Christ's sacrifice wasn't good enough and we need to "add" to it. Just cultivate a relationship with God and forget religion. Forget ceremony. Forget doctrine and tradition. Bless you, my friend.
UmjJmYsjaa	Well by definition Witchcraft is a religion, Merriam-webster.com says about Relgion:      2: a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices  3. scrupulous conformity : conscientiousness  4: a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith    By the last three definitions Witchcraft is a Religion. It is a set of Beleifs.     To clarigy your problem, answer me this what is the Difference between Wiccans and Witchcraft? Because from what i remember alot of the things that are practiced by Wiccans, are the same things that Witchcraft does. If you're wiccan what do you think about Alister Crowley? Email me if you want, but i got to know.    PS: dont pay attention to the Christians above me, the majority of Christiandom follow alot of Pagan (Roman & Celtic )beliefs, Hell, the Trinity, afterlife, etc, so they by definition Follow Satan, funny how that works...There is only one Christian religion i know that follows the Bible in detail.    Im christian, and my wife was Wiccan! Well|`|vx4QvCosaa	Its not. Its a cult. and it deals with the underworld, and you worship the unknown. By thinking being a witch gives you power over people. It don't do nothing. Witches think they can put curses on people, or look into their future. Well they can't. they only think they can. What do you think Wiccans are?|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I am guessing it is just a major misconception about paganism and witchcraft. Many people in my town assume all pagans are Wiccans and they assume all do witchcraft. i even had a christian tell me I wasn't a real pagan since I don't do witchcraft (i do on occasion but not regularly...so I don't consider myself a witch).    I wish more people would just ask instead of making assumptions about something they don't know about.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	I don't know it clearly is not a religion.

It just makes other people confused - and it's up to people like us to set the record straight.  My problem is actually the opposite - I'm sort-of Wiccan (or at least Neo-Pagan) but I don't consider myself a witch as I don't practice the craft.|`|vHFnUq3Caa	its considered a way of life and as such is widely considered to be a religion in the same vein as buddhism (more a way to live your life than an organised religion in the sense of christianity)|`|Xtqq71KGaa	most people know very little about religions aside from their own, and it is pretty common for a witch to be wiccan, tho not necessary.  most people just don't know.  when wicca regains popularity maybe people will be more educated.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	i believe some forms of witchcraft are legally recognized as a religion by the Us government, but i am not  a legal expert, consult other sources|`|S4rUEGpsaa	Merry Meet,  You are correct Witchcraft is *not* a religion.   Wicca is.   They had changed the word witch  to wicca to make witchcraft more acceptable  and less frigtneing. Because most christians are very fearful of witches as well as it was  changed to protect us from christians and Witch hunters.      All witches do *Not* have to be wiccan. there are several forms of witch craft.  Gardnerian (Wicca founded by Gerald Gardner)  Alexandrian (Alex Sanders)   Dianic (only for goddesses worshipers)   Traditional (Passed from generation to generation)  Pecti (Scottish)    just to give you a small example of which witch is which.     I myself am a witch,  I am solitare and use a dab of this and a dab of that to become my own  kind of witch.   Hope this helps   Blessed Be|`|NxL4C1DMaa	Too many confuse Wicca with Witchcraft, claiming it's a "reborn" version of Witchcraft. Which it is not.     Witchcraft has no deities...no prayers to say, no honoring of anyone. Witchcraft is a practice...a set of skills, like a trade. Knowledge of herbs and their uses, and creating of items from them to enhance ones life and health. Taking a personal role in how their lives are directed, working personally with the energies that surround them and others to produce a desired result, all basically make a Witch.    A wiccan follows a God and Goddess, tenants of belief, and divine rules. They perform (generally, but not always) with others in raising energy to honor their deities, and ask them for assistance when needed.     The confusion lies in that many wiccans choose to practice Witchcraft alongside their Wiccan rituals. They incorporate it so that it blends in so well, people believe that Wicca IS Witchcraft. You don't have to be wiccan to be a Witch, and you don't have to be a witch to be Wiccan. I myself am not a Wiccan. I may have started my path that way, but my path has led me away from there and is leading me somewhere new. I don't believe in the Wiccan Rede, I don't believe in the Threefold Law. I am a Witch, but not Wiccan, therefore one CAN be a Witch and not Wiccan.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	It's mostly newbies to the religion who think that Wicca and witchcraft are the same thing. I just try to be patient with them, because they really don't mean any harm. They'll eventually catch a clue...hopefully!    Many new Wiccans go through this stage, especially solitaries who are trying to learn the religion on their own. They often end up with some books that give misinformation (Silver Ravenwolf comes to mind) and end up having a very messed up idea of what Wicca is. Many newbies actually think it is an ancient religion that believes in never harming anyone for any reason.     I've tried to explain to many of them that some Wiccans don't even practice magic or follow the "Harm None" interpretation of the Wiccan Rede and that Wicca is not even a century old yet, but I just get tons of thumbs down. Oh well, some people have to learn things on their own and in their own time.|`|rCNRcF5waa	I just thought I'd give this a shot.  I'm an ex Wiccan (As mpcotk says above) and while I can't say what other forms of "witchcraft" believe, I can say that I find the idea of Atheist Witches pretty ridiculous. The entire belief of Wiccans was that when practicing your craft, you were putting your faith in the Goddess to make it manifest. So thinking of someone practicing the craft, without belief that some entity will make it manifest, seems somewhat absurd to me. It just seems to me that they are claiming a title that does not belong to them. Where exactly do they believe the source of their power is coming from? If, like many Wiccans, they believe the source of power comes from Earths energies. Well, my friend, that still counts as a belief system. Therefore qualifies as a religion. So I hope I answered your question. But once again I can only tell you what I myself know.  Edit  After reading what the woman above me wrote, I decided to add a bit more to this. While it's true that many Wiccans don't realize their religion has only been around for less than a century, most DO follow the "harm none" belief. But as I said before, there are many different branches of Wicca and Witchcraft. That's like a Christian coming in and saying that all Christians as a whole follow the trinity belief. This isn't true, obviously. Not ALL do. So I thought I'd point out the fact that there are many different forms of Wicca before you get your head filled with other people's bullshit. Some people just need to stick to their own branches of belief. Like you said, you know Athiest Wiccans. And while I might find that idea rediculous. It's probably true. I'm not trying to disprove anyone or anything. I'm just telling you what I know from my expirence.|`|sfRv5wY4aa	Witchcraft is a religion in a since your serving Satan, by allowing you to trick yourself into a denial that you need God, first and foremost when you do something supernatural its not you doing it, for you to be able to do something like this you would need help, if your doing witch craft your letting Satan into your life and he hates Humans, he wants us all to go to Hell,    When Jesus Healed the sick, and cured the Blind why was this ? because he is the son of God thats why,   when the prophets of God would tell us what is going to happen in the future how did they do this? Because God showed it to them.    So you see Witch craft is just another attempt at confusion from Satan to tempt man into thinking they have some power to hopefully cause them to lust after this power so much that they would continue in sin till they die and end up in hell.      This tells you how to become a Christian, and how to go to Heaven       John 9:31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.        John3:5     Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .        Acts 2:36-38    36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.     37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?     38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost

Try talking to your best friend and asking her whats wrong and what you can do to make things easier, but also be firm and tell her you're in this relationship with your girl friend and that means a lot to you too. And if she really is your best friend, she'll understand and be happy for you.

Em nome do Pai e do Filho se alcan?a perd?o, pois eles perdoam n?o que Eles s?o mais bonzinhos, mas quando estamos em desespero com quallquer coisa que nos levou a tal,  algumas pessoas geralmente falam o nome de Deus em v?o , por estarem desesperadas, ent?o Eles n?o levam em conta o que foi falado, ex:  quando se perde derrepente em acidentes que n?o eram esperados algum que amamos ent?o procedemos de forma que as vezes cometemos o pecado no terceiro mandamento onde nos diz que n?o podemos tomar o nome de DEus em V?o, PORQUE O SENHOR N?O TER POR INOCENTE QUEM TAL FIZER.  Este pecado se for para levar em conta quando dizemos, ai meu deus, meu cabelo t caindo, ou ai meu deus minha unha quebrou, ai meu deus como estou gorda... todas e quaisquer frases  como estas s?o blasfemar, ou ent?o ... deus podia ajudar que ela morresse isto  no caso de uma pessoa que tem inimigo e n?o gosta desta pessoa ent?o ela comete pecado. Mas como muita gente n?o sabe o que est fazendo um dia prestar?o conta deste mandamento onde Deus n?o ir ter por inocente.

N?o  assim? desta forma o Esprito Santo tambm  tenta nos mostrar a verdade dos mandamentos de Deus , os dez mandamentos que o ser humano teve a coragem de mudar para ficar mais fcil para s, e olha que o sbado  do  Senhor|`|hJc6O5CFaa	Se voc relmente est interessado na resposta, sugiro que leia o texto do livro de Marcos  3. 22-30 (Bblia), antes de continuar a ler minha resposta. O perd?o para este pecado foi vetado  pelo  prpio Jesus , atavs do qual somos perdoados.Este pecado se caracteriza por atribuir ao diabo(esprito imundo , belzebu) as obras que s o Esprito Santo  faz , dessa forma  pode-se concluir que se est chamando o Esptito Santo de diabo.Esta  a maior blasfmia contra  Deus pois equivale dizer que Deus e o diabo pertencem ao mesmo reino.O Esprito Santo  o responsvel  pela a??o de covencer o homem  do pecado, do juizo e da justi?a , ou seja   Ele quem  leva o homem at Deus atravs de Jesus . Se  Ele   quem  tem esta tarefa de conver??o , e Ele   ofendido  sendo chamado de diabo,  h um afastamento  irreverssvel  da pessoa   que cometeu o pecado. Sendo este afastamento irreverssvel , o  Esprito  Santo  n?o vai agir para convencer  o dito pecador  para que tenha  o  arrependimento  para a salva??o. Fica claro    que quem  n?o  cometeu  este pecado  est  apto para ser  perdoado  toda vez que  cometer um pecado.   importante  dezer que quem  comete este pecado  n?o tem  mais arrependimento  de  absolutamente  nada de errado  que  praticar , o pecador blasfemo  n?o  tem  vontade de pedir perd?o( o Esprito Santo  n?o o convece  mais  da necessidade de ser perdoado). Chegamos a conclus?o que  o blasfemador ent?o  n?o poder ter os seus pecados cometidos  perdoados por Deus nunca mais , pois o  perd?o s  ocorre quando  h  arrependimento.  Fica  claro ent?o o porqu  de todos os outros pecados  serem  perdoados ,  pois  o Esprito  Santo   ter acesso ao cora??o do homem  enquanto esste terrvel pecado n?o for cometido..Uma  evidncia  que este pecado n?o foi  cometido    o fato da pessoa   se arrepender  de qualquer pecado  cometido .A    preocupa??o  da possibilidade  de se ter cometido este  pecado j   uma  prova incontestvel  que o pecado   de    blasfmia  contra o Esprito Santo n?o  foi cometido. Espero  que  minha resposta  seje satisfatria. Um abra?o.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Na verdade tudo  obra de Deus.

Recuai, por favor, cada um do seu mau caminho, e tornai bons os vossos caminhos e vossas a??es. cada um do seu mau caminho, e tornai bons os vossos caminhos e vossas a??es.    Deus n?o forjou o mal, mas ele disse que traria puni??o aquele povo ingrato que andava no caminho torto. Ele na qualidade de Criador tinha o direito de trazer calamidade ou o "mal" contra aquelas pessoas que de maneira perniciosa insistiam em manter uma conduta errada. Por isso ele disse :Recuai, por favor, cada um do seu mau caminho, e tornai bons os vossos caminhos e vossas a??es..  1 Se ele deu o aviso antes  porque n?o queria que as pessoas fossem punidas injustamente.  2 Observe a express?o "Por favor."

O oleiro e o barro (Jeremias 18:1 a 19:15). Deus ordena a Jeremias que v  casa do oleiro. Ele observa ali como o oleiro transforma um vaso de barro que est estragado em outro vaso segundo o seu agrado. Deus declara ent?o ser o Oleiro da casa de Israel, tendo o poder de demolir ou de edificar. A seguir, diz a Jeremias que leve uma botija de oleiro ao vale de Hinom e anuncie ali a calamidade que Deus far vir, porque o povo encheu esse lugar de sangue inocente, queimando seus filhos como holocaustos para Baal. Da, Jeremias precisa quebrar a botija para mostrar como Deus destro?ar Jerusalm e o povo de Jud.    Tal Julgamento se cumpriu em 607 AC, quando Babil?nia veio contra Jerusalm.

TANTO a cincia como a religi?o, nas suas formas mais nobres, tm como objetivo a busca da verdade. A cincia desvenda um mundo em que h espantosa ordem e harmonia, um Universo com claras evidncias de projeto inteligente. A?religi?o verdadeira d significado a essas descobertas, ao ensinar que a mente do Criador est por trs do projeto manifesto no mundo fsico.    A religi?o aumenta minha admira??o pela cincia, diz o bilogo molecular Francis Collins. Ele continua: Quando alguma coisa nova  revelada sobre o genoma, experimento um sentimento maravilhoso de satisfa??o ao perceber que a humanidade agora sabe alguma coisa que s Deus sabia antes.  uma sensa??o incrvel e emocionante, que me aproxima de Deus e torna a cincia ainda mais gratificante para mim.    O que ajudar algum a conciliar a cincia com a religi?o?    A busca continua    Aceite os limites: Nossa busca por respostas sobre os infinitos Universo, espa?o e tempo n?o tem fim. O bilogo Lewis Thomas disse: Essa busca nunca ter fim, pois somos uma espcie dotada de insacivel curiosidade: sempre explorando novos horizontes, investigando e procurando entender as coisas. Jamais teremos todas as respostas. N?o consigo imaginar chegarmos a um ponto em que todos suspirar?o aliviados e dir?o: Agora entendemos tudo. Jamais atingiremos esse estgio.    A verdade religiosa tambm  infinita. Paulo, um dos escritores da Bblia, afirmou: Agora vemos em espelho e de maneira confusa .?.?. O meu conhecimento  limitado. ?1?Corntios 13:12; Bblia Sagrada, Edi??o Pastoral.    Mas o conhecimento parcial ou limitado sobre quest?es cientficas e religiosas n?o nos impede de chegar a conclus?es coerentes com base nos fatos que conhecemos. N?o precisamos de conhecimento detalhado sobre a origem do Sol para termos certeza absoluta de que ele se levantar amanh?.    Deixe que os fatos falem por si: Na nossa busca de respostas, precisamos ser guiados por princpios slidos. A menos que nos guiemos pelas evidncias mais id?neas, podemos ser facilmente desencaminhados na nossa busca da verdade cientfica ou religiosa. Falando de modo realista, nenhum de ns tem condi??es de avaliar todo o conhecimento e conceitos cientficos que hoje enchem enormes bibliotecas. Por outro lado, a Bblia  um compndio de ensinamentos espirituais, de fcil manuseio. A Bblia  comprovada por fatos estabelecidos.    Concernente ao conhecimento em geral ?tanto na cincia como na religi?o ,? preciso um esfor?o sincero para distinguir entre fato e especula??o, entre realidade e engano. Conforme alertou o escritor bblico Paulo, precisamos rejeitar as contradi??es do falsamente chamado conhecimento?. (1?Timteo 6:20) Para conciliar a cincia e a Bblia, precisamos deixar que os fatos falem por si, evitando conjecturas e especula??es, e examinar como cada fato apia e amplia outro.    S para citar um exemplo, quando entendemos que a Bblia usa o termo dia para representar vrios perodos, compreendemos que os seis dias criativos em Gnesis n?o entram em conflito com a conclus?o cientfica de que a Terra tem cerca de quatro bilh?es e meio de anos. Segundo a Bblia, a Terra j existia por um perodo n?o especificado antes de come?arem os dias criativos. (Veja o quadro Ser que cada dia criativo teve a dura??o de 24 horas?) Mesmo que uma revis?o de conceitos cientficos atribua uma idade diferente para o nosso planeta, as declara??es bblicas ainda s?o verazes. Longe de contradizer a Bblia, a cincia, nesse e em muitos outros casos, na verdade fornece amplas informa??es suplementares sobre o Universo fsico, tanto no presente como no passado.  Evidentemente, assim como ocorre com a cincia, falsidades e prticas prejudiciais se infiltraram na religi?o. De forma que existe a religi?o verdadeira e a falsa. Isso explica por que muitos abandonaram as institui??es religiosas tradicionais para se tornar membros da congrega??o crist? das Testemunhas de Jeov. Eles se decepcionaram com o fato de sua religi?o anterior preferir ater-se a tradi??es humanas e mitos, desconsiderando as verdades descobertas ou reveladas.|`|c23d55c0d71b88f2d2058b1137b63edeaa	n?o . a CINCIA busca as RESPOSTAS ; e  a PRIMERA a RECONHECER quando ERRA e CAPITALIZA isso como INCENTIVO para buscar a VERDADE ; quasquer que seja ela . a RELIGI?O  ANTAG?NICA ;  pos SOBREVIVE da CREN?A SISTEMTICA e INFLEXVEL naquilo que SE JULGA VERDADE ABSOLUTA . e aos FIIS n?o  PERMITIDO QUESTIONAR a "verdade" .|`|e17222dd4d0d7bbcd945ce95f6533765aa	A Cincia e a Religi?o s?o as duas alavancas da inteligncia humana: uma revela as leis do mundo material e a outra as do mundo moral. Tendo, no entanto, essas leis o mesmo princpio, que  Deus, n?o podem contradizer-se. Se fossem a nega??o uma da outra, uma necessariamente estaria em erro e a outra com a verdade, porquanto Deus n?o pode pretender a destrui??o de sua prpria obra. A incompatibilidade que se julgou existir entre essas duas ordens de idias provm apenas de uma observa??o defeituosa e de excesso de exclusivismo, de um lado e de outro.

N?o existe indcio algum na Bblia de que Deus alguma vez prometesse ao primeiro casal humano, Ad?o e Eva, que seriam transportados para o cu, a fim de se tornarem anjos, caso continuassem fiis a Deus por algum tempo na terra. Com efeito, em todas as Escrituras inspiradas, de Gnesis a Malaquias, n?o foram feitas quaisquer promessas do cu para os humanos; nem qualquer pessoa foi para o cu.    Temos a palavra de Jesus Cristo neste sentido. Disse: Nenhum homem ascendeu ao cu, sen?o aquele que desceu do cu, o Filho do homem. (Jo?o 3:13) Pedro, apstolo de Jesus, disse o seguinte sobre Davi, fiel servo de Deus: Ele tanto faleceu como foi enterrado, e o seu tmulo est entre ns at o dia de hoje. Realmente, Davi n?o ascendeu aos cus.  Atos 2:29,?34.    A esperan?a celeste n?o foi apresentada aos que viveram antes da morte de Jesus Cristo.  por isso que Jesus disse que entre os nascidos de mulher n?o se levantou ningum maior do que Jo?o Batista; mas aquele que  menor no reino dos cus  maior do que ele. (Mat. 11:11) Todavia, se uma esperan?a celeste n?o foi apresentada aos servos fiis de Deus antes de Cristo vir  terra, por que Deus promete levar certos crist?os para o cu? O motivo se relaciona ao propsito original de Deus de ter um paraso global, povoado de humanos felizes e saudveis.    Para cumprir seu propsito original, Deus introduziu algo novo  um novo governo para reger a terra. Deus designou seu Filho, Jesus Cristo, para ser o rei deste governo, que  chamado na Bblia de reino de Deus ou reino dos cus. (Luc. 8:1; Mat. 4:17) E desde os dias de Jo?o Batista, que batizou Jesus, Deus tem selecionado dentre a humanidade pessoas para serem co-regentes de seu Filho naquele governo celeste. Afirma a Bblia: Reinar?o sobre a terra. (Rev. 5:9,?10) Um regente prospectivo, o apstolo Paulo, escreveu a outro, o homem Timteo: Se perseverarmos, havemos tambm de reinar juntos.  2?Tim. 2:12; Luc. 22:28-30.    Assim, o motivo de Deus levar pessoas para o cu  formar um governo celeste para reger esta terra. N?o  povoar o cu, colher crian?as  lindas flores  para si mesmo. N?o, pois aqueles a quem Deus escolhe para a vida celeste s?o pessoas provadas e testadas que se habilitam para ser co-regentes de Cristo. (Rev. 20:6; 2:10) Apenas um nmero limitado ser levado para o cu, para constituir este governo celeste, a Bblia fornecendo o nmero como sendo de cento e quarenta e quatro mil.  Rev. 14:1,?3.    Qu?o grandioso ser, no futuro, quando Cristo e seus 144.000 associados do Reino regerem a terra! Entre seus sditos terrestres estar?o bilh?es de mortos ressuscitados, inclusive homens fiis dos tempos pr-crist?os, tais como Davi e Jo?o Batista. A segura promessa  de que ent?o n?o haver mais morte, nem pranto, nem clamor, nem dor. As coisas anteriores j passaram.

LuN1unJ3aa	I understand your predicament. My experience has sadly shown that for a person to be helped, they have to want help.    I'm not saying give up on them, but I might ask them (individually) if they want any help. "Do you want me to help you?"    The other thing to consider is the approach you might use. I'm no psychiatrist, but I suspect that might have a lot to do with "getting through" the barriers they've built up over the years.    Since alcohol is a problem, visit an AA group's headquarters and explain your situation. They may be able to offer some advice or at least, some reading material. Religion may or may not help in this matter, so I would not attempt to start there. Seek some professional advice, first, even from your local police department, making it clear that you want to help, but aren't sure where to go next.    I wish you the best in your endeavors.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Hon, there has to be a time where you say " I can't help you if  you don't help yourself."|`|NlzlBV8Haa	Sigh.    I hear you, I'm there too.  With my husband's family :(    We do our best, we pray for them, but you (especially as the member of the family it is harder for you) yes, you need to find some healthy relationships and separate yourself from the drama.    Move to another state if possible.    We have realized over the years that advice is rejected even when it is offered time and time again, they see the problems they refuse to change even after multiple arrests, court dates, counselors etc.      You *can't* help someone who doesn't want to be helped.  You can ask God to help them, you can offer support when asked but try to get some physical and/or mental distance between you and them.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	They may not want you to see their faults. Perhaps they need an outsider to help them. You can give your advice to that other person to give to them without your family knowing  you were behind it. Hope it helps...|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	Generally, addicts don't stop until they hit bottom or something happens in their life where they get a real wake-up call.  (like drunk driving arrests or accidents, losing their jobs, etc)    Of course, every person is different, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to convince them that they need to change.  It has to come from them.|`|WL7nKDplaa	Tell them that you want to help, but if they won't let you then there's nothing you can do. You could try telling their friends, if they drink and drive you could call the police. I know you don't want to do that, but if you did it might get them the help they need. Good luck.|`|nxMi4adjaa	Pray for them or just record them and let them see it over and over again until they see it your way.|`|l5wziiicaa	Honestly you can't really help someone that does not want to be helped.  They have to want to help themselves.  If anybody stops drinking for another person and not themselves, it won't last.  Trust me, I've experienced this before and the only time that person stopped drinking was when that person did it for themselves and not for me.  You are not wasting your time trying to help though, I think a little bit of help here and there can at some point make someone realize that they do need help.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	You can't help someone who doesn't want it.  I know there are groups for people whose parents or close relatives are alcoholics.  You might want to find one in your area and check them out.    As for your family, all you can do is offer them help if they want it.|`|3lCeMP2Gaa	Hiding your feelings can create its own set of problems. Acknowledging feelings of anger or resentment, even if it's just to yourself or a close friend can help protect against this. Recognizing the emotions that go with the problem also can help you from burying your feelings and pretending that everything's OK.    You're not betraying your parents by seeking help. Keeping "the secret" is part of the disease of alcoholism  and it allows the problems to get worse.    I'm not sure how old you are, but the longer you keep this to yourself the longer it's going to affect you, especially if you are constantly on edge if you say something and one of your parents flips because of the alcohol.    Because alcoholism is a disease and not a behaviour, chances are that you won't be able to change your parents actions. But you can show your love and support and, above all, take care of yourself. Good luck.    Message me if you ever need to chat x|`|KMcUHkpgaa	well, don't fix it if it ain't broken.  just lay off their problems and let them handle themselves, but don't shut yourself out either. remind them you're there for them and show lots of love and affection. nobody likes people in their business so just let it be, but remind that the love and respect is always there.  i personally don't like help if i don't want it and it just pisses me off when people get involved, even if they mean well and are (usually) right.    just take care of *yourself* and maybe have a drink or two with them, as an alcoholic myself, nothing builds bridges like a few drinks (or a fattie)|`|b8pd8EdAaa	Alcoholism is a disease. A sickness that destroys every one it touches. I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. I have been clean and sober for 2 and a half years.  I have also been in love with a practicing alcoholic and addict that doesn't want help. I know how you feel. You feel really powerless. And you really are powerless over their addiction. the only think you can change is the way it affects you. I've put it in Gods hands. I don't know if you believe in Him but that is what i do. I pray and ask God to help them. Just try not to be angry at them bacause it is a disease. They can't help it and probably don't even realize thay are hurting you. I would recomend an al-anon meeting for you. I am in A.A. but it wouldn't help them unless they really wanted it. Find an al-anon meeting and go. find an a.a. meeing (an open meeting). They will help you too.

Mas a hora vem, E AGORA , em que os verdadeiros adoradores adorar?o O PAI em esprito e em verdade; porque O PAI procura a TAIS que assim O ADOREM. Deus  Esprito, e  necessrio que os que o adoram O ADOREM em esprito e em verdade." Jo?o 4:21:24    Importa  o que o nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo disse. . . assim como ele, os verdadeiros adoradores adoram O PAI em esprito e verdade.    Fique na paz    >>>>>>>>>!!!  Srgio M    As vezes voc parece que "adora" mesmo  a Vers?o Almeida, pois desconsidera que outras vers?es da Bblia (trinitrias) diferem muito em algumas tradu??es. . .   o caso em 1Jo?o 5:20 e tambm 2Pedro 1:1 veja . . .    "Sabemos que o Filho de Deus veio e nos deu inteligncia para conhecer o Verdadeiro. Estamos com o Verdadeiro e com o seu Filho Jesus Cristo." - Bblia do Peregrino.   "Sabemos que o Filho de Deus veio e nos deu inteligncia para conhecermos o Deus verdadeiro. E ns estamos com o Verdadeiro, gra?as a seu Filho Jesus Cristo." - Edi??o Pastoral.     Percebe a men??o de duas pessoas em 1 Jo?o 5:20? Qual destas duas pessoas  o Deus verdadeiro? Seguramente  aquele para quem o prprio Jesus orou certa vez: "E a vida eterna  esta: que te conhe?am, a ti s, por nico Deus verdadeiro e a Jesus Cristo, a quem enviaste.   " (Jo?o 17:3, JFA) Notou a incrvel semelhan?a entre estas duas passagens? Se Jo?o 17:3 e 1 Jo?o 5:20 foram escritos pela mesma pessoa,  de se esperar que esses dois versculos concordem entre si. Ambos os textos est?o dizendo que o verdadeiro Deus  o Pai de Jesus.   Se ainda tem dvida que a estrutura de  1Jo?o 5:20 permite entendimento descrito aqui, leia atentamente 2a Jo?o 7:    "[Pessoas] que n?o confessam a encarna??o de Jesus Cristo. Este  o enganador e o anticristo."     Segundo o versculo acima, quem  o enganador e o anticristo? Diria voc que  Jesus s porque ele  a pessoa mais prxima da conclus?o do argumento? Claro que n?o! Tal conclus?o se refere a quem foi mencionado antes de Jesus, ou seja, certas "pessoas" que duvidam que Jesus existiu qual ser humano. Qualquer um que se enquadrar dentre elas  anticristo. A mesma estrutura frasal ocorre com 1 Jo?o 5:20:  "Estamos com o Verdadeiro, gra?as a seu Filho Jesus Cristo. Este  o Deus verdadeiro e a Vida eterna."    2Pedro 1:1,2  Sim?o Pedro, servo e apstolo de Jesus Cristo, queles que, pela justi?a do nosso Deus e do Salvador Jesus Cristo, alcan?aram por partilha uma f t?o preciosa como a nossa, gra?a e paz vos sejam dadas em abundancia por um profundo conhecimento de Deus e de Jesus, nosso Senhor! Bblia Ave Maria    De modo que uma interpreta??o bblica, que n?o se harmoniza com as Escrituras em todo o seu conjunto,  o caminho mais fcil para torn-la um livro de contradi??es. . . e muitos s?o os que assim a consideram, simplesmente por que  muito mal interpretado em todo o seu contexto e at traduzido conforme as convenincias de seus tradutores (ou forma??o religiosa). . . Alguns, mesmo defendendo Jesus como sendo O Deus Todo-poderoso (ao menos nestes vs por mim expostos) n?o permitiram que suas cren?as interferissem na tradu??o destes versos.

Mas  vamos ao real e a verdade ....  A frase Deus-Filho n?o aparece em nenhum versculo das Escrituras Sagradas. Como pode o Filho ser Deus e ao mesmo tempo ser seu prprio Filho?     Se a Bblia quisesse transmitir-nos a idia de que Jesus e o Pai fossem exatamente iguais, n?o utilizaria a palavra Filho que  um qualificativo que nas Escrituras se outorga exclusivamente a Jesus Cristo e nunca a Jeov. Se a igualdade entre o Filho e o Pai fosse a no??o correta, a Palavra de Deus n?o teria nenhum inconveniente em chamar a Jeov de Filho de Jesus, tal como Jeov chama a Jesus de Filho de Deus.   AO CITADO POR VC ... RESPONDO ...  Depois da terceira tenta??o, Jesus deu uma resposta enrgica ao Diabo:     Vai-te, Satans! Pois est escrito:  a Jeov, teu Deus (o Pai), que tens de adorar e  somente a ele que tens de prestar servi?o sagrado. ( Mateus 4:10 )   Jesus cita aqui  DEUTERON?MIO 6 : 13  Note que de maneira alguma ele direciona para si mesmo as palavras de Mateus 4:10.  Em certa ocasi?o Jesus pergunta diretamente  Pedro ;  Mateus 16 : 15 - .....E vs , quem dizeis que eu sou ?  Mateus 16 : 16 ...E Sim?o Pedro respondendo disse : ' Tu s o Cristo , o Filho de Deus vivo  (almeida)  Ser Jesus inferior ao seu  Pai, n?o o torna um ser insignificante, pelo contrario, Jesus  jamais expressou  desaprova??o a isso. Ele mesmo reconheceu, a superioridade do Pai.  Ver JO?O 14:28.   JESUS  IDENTIFICADO NAS ESCRITURAS, COMO SENDO O "FILHO DE DEUS", E N?O O PRPRIO DEUS, JEOV.

Pregai o evangelho  toda criatura" e voc sabe quem saiu por a queimando gente na fogueira, se apossando do novo continente em nome de Deus e destruindo civiliza??es inteiras.

Cavalo  criatura tambm. Os crentes pregam o evangelho a eles? Os crentes praticam a verdadeira religi?o que, segundo Tiago, cap. 1: "26 Se algum cuida ser religioso e n?o refreia a sua lngua, mas engana o seu cora??o, a sua religi?o  v?.  27 A religi?o pura e imaculada diante de nosso Deus e Pai  esta: Visitar os rf?os e as vivas nas suas afli??es e guardar-se isento da corrup??o do mundo" ou s sai por a falando sem refrear a lngua e esquece o principal?

1096a593aed597ef7e3ccb4316139fb8aa	A herldica refere-se simultaneamente  cincia e  arte de descrever os bras?es de armas ou escudos. As origens da herldica remontam aos tempos em que era imperativo distinguir os participantes das batalhas e dos torneios, assim como descrever os servi?os por eles prestados e que eram pintados nos seus escudos. No entanto,  importante notar que um bras?o de armas  definido n?o visualmente, mas antes pela sua descri??o escrita, a qual  dada numa linguagem prpria  a linguagem herldica.    Ao acto de desenhar um bras?o d-se o nome de brasonar. Para termos a certeza de que os heraldistas, aps a leitura das descri??es, est?o a brasonar correctamente, criando bras?es precisos e semelhantes entre si, a arte de brasonar segue uma srie de regras mais ou menos estritas.    A primeira coisa que  descrita num escudo  o esmalte (cor) do campo (fundo); seguem-se a posi??o e esmaltes das diferentes cargas (objectos) existentes no escudo. Estas cargas s?o descritas de cima para baixo, e da direita (dextra) para a esquerda (sinistra). Na verdade, a dextra (do latim dextra, -?, ?direita?) refere-se ao lado esquerdo do escudo, e a sinistra (do latim sinistra, -?, ?esquerda?) ao lado direito, tal como este  visto pelo observador. A raz?o porque isto sucede prende-se com o facto de a descri??o se referir ao ponto de vista do portador do escudo, e n?o do seu observador.    Embora a palavra escudo seja comumente utilizada para se referir ao bras?o de armas no seu todo, na realidade, o escudo  apenas um dos elementos que comp?em um bras?o de armas. Numa descri??o completa, o escudo pode ser acompanhado por outros elementos, como suportes, coronis, listis com motes (ou lemas).    No entanto, muitos escudos apresentam por vezes duas formas distintas: uma complexa, e outra simplificada, reduzida ao escudo propriamente dito (o que sucede por vezes quando h pouco espa?o para inserir o bras?o de armas maior). Inmeros pases apresentam assim as chamadas armas maiores e armas menores (veja-se o caso de Portugal).|`|28749a2aa1495b1966482c64c48696f2aa	hereditaria....|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	A herldica refere-se simultaneamente  cincia e  arte de descrever os bras?es de armas ou escudos.

Sobre a mesa, da qual se vem apenas trs pernas, h diversos objetos: copos, pequenos discos amontoados, dados, uma bolsa e uma faca com a lamina descoberta ao lado de sua bainha.      O prestidigitador est s, no meio de uma campina rida com trs tufos de erva; no horizonte, entre as pernas da figura, uma rvore se desenha contra o cu incolor.

Tar? de Marselha  [www.krishadar.com]                  Fsico: Muita vitalidade e poder sobre as enfermidades de ordem mental ou nervosa, neuroses e obsess?es.

Histria e iconografia          Desde a antiguidade clssica s?o bem conhecidos esses personagens que ganhavam a vida com suas habilidades. Seu ofcio se combinava freqentemente com a dan?a e o charlatanismo  passavam o seu tempo a vagabundear pelas feiras.       N?o h muitas marcas literrias de sua passagem pela cultura europia, mas, em compensa??o, foi um personagem de prestgio nas artes grficas desde os primeiros tempos. As grava??es medievais costumam mostr-lo no desempenho de suas mgicas frente a um grupo de espectadores absortos.      O Tar? suprime as testemunhas e acrescenta detalhes originais (a mesa de trs pernas, a posi??o das pernas e dos bra?os do protagonista, entre outros), mas o seu parentesco com os registros sobre as feiras  evidente.              LEscamoteur  Pintura de Jerome Bosch (1453-1516)                  Pode-se acrescentar que, no mundo islamico, o Prestidigitador foi tambm um personagem de vasta popularidade.       Num sentido mais geral, o Prestidigitador  smbolo da atividade originria e do poder criador existente no homem. Como ponto de partida do Tar?,  tambm o primeiro passo inicitico, a vontade bsica no caminho para a sabedoria, a matria primordial dos alquimistas, o barro paradisaco do qual ser obtido o Ad?o Kadmon.               Tar? de Oswald Wirth             Se o mundo visvel n?o passa de ilus?o  pergunta-se Oswald Wirth  o seu criador n?o ser o ilusionista por excelncia?       Neste plano, o Prestidigitador identifica-se com a materialidade do ser criado, at que o demiurgo e a criatura tornam-se o mesmo: certamente h aqui um sentido psicolgico, para o qual a identidade  produto da experincia pessoal (o homem  o resultado das suas prprias a??es). Desta maneira, pode-se interpretar a supress?o da quarta perna da mesa como representativa do ternrio humano no mundo (esprito-psique-corpo).      Uma das especula??es em torno do personagem do Arcano I pode ser estabelecida a partir da sua atividade intensa, de seu dinamismo sem repouso (produto de seu carter de intermedirio entre o sensvel e o virtual), atributo que o relaciona de modo estreito ao simbolismo de Mercrio.          Nesse sentido, a vareta que traz na m?o esquerda seria a simplifica??o do caduceu, assim como seu estranho chapu corresponde quase exatamente ao capacete alado da divindade. Seu nome grego significaria intrprete, mediador, o que confirmaria essa hiptese.

Os carrilh?es s?o normalmente alojados em torres de igrejas ou conventos e s?o dos maiores instrumentos do mundo    Os carrilh?es apareceram no sculo XV na Flandres quando os construtores de sinos conseguiram aperfei?oar a sua arte de modo a conseguirem que cada sino reproduzisse um tom exacto. A maior concentra??o de carrilh?es antigos situa-se na Blgica, Holanda e nas regi?es do norte da Fran?a, Alemanha e Polnia, onde eram colocados como smbolos de orgulho das cidades mais ricas e como demonstra??o do seu status.    Como cada nota  produzida por um nico sino, a amplitude musical do carrilh?o  determinada pelo nmero de sinos que este possui. Com menos de 23 sinos (2 oitavas), o instrumento n?o  considerado um verdadeiro carrilh?o. (chime) Em mdia, os carrilh?es tm 47 sinos (4/5 oitavas), enquanto os maiores possuem 77 sinos (6 oitavas)      Sentado numa cabine por baixo do carrilh?o, o carrilhonista pressiona as teclas com a m?o protegida ou com o pulso. As teclas accionam alavancas e fios que ligam directamente aos badalos dos sinos; tal como no piano, o carrilhonista pode fazer variar a intensidade da nota de acordo com a for?a aplicada na press?o da respectiva tecla. Em conjunto com as teclas manuais, os sinos maiores, possuem tambm pedais que oferecem a possibilidade das notas graves, serem tocadas de duas maneiras diferentes.

Em ti se faziam os teus tambores e os teus pfaros; no dia em que foste criado foram preparados. Eu te coloquei com o querubim da guarda; estiveste sobre o monte santo de Deus; andaste no meio das pedras afogueadas.

9ee8dcc2934057939567eae607a331c6aa	This is a good question.    It is my opinion, that many who have interests in 'DADDY' type of guys, are usually those who may have unresolved issues with their own fathers.  Many have or have had fathers who 'man-handle' them in rough ways and in a disciplinary manner (leather queens love this kind of man) so they fulfill what they may continue to want this type of domineering type person so they can relive what it was like when they were young.      On the flip-side of this token, there are those who enjoy 'twinks' for the same purpose.      I myself have seen young guys prey on the older men and the old men (who usually get the worse from Society because these young guys [usually hustlers] prey on these men) and never really understood it.      But in the end, 'to each their own' and in all honesty - it's none of my business who chooses who.    cheers  bga|`|OPOIQhvyaa	Quite honestly I think most people have something 'wrong' with them.  Either they are looking for a daddy or they are manic-depressed or they are an alcoholic.........peel back the layers of ANY person and you will find something 'dysfunctional' .|`|AA12034267	No, there is a security thing that goes with that. I don't think it's weird or strange at all. They are gay and looking for the father figure that they might not have had while growing up. I'm 35 you need a daddy? LOL|`|QWMPWia4aa	It's possible that younger gay guys who like a "daddy" or older man to take care of them are compensating for something lacking in their real fathers.  Some might just want someone older and experienced to guide them and teach them about being gay.  Some like having an older, wealthier man to spoil them and spend money on them.    It's also possible that they're just attracted to older men...|`|K6cHlzAkaa	Im guessing that anyone looking for a 'Daddy' lacks self guidance and is looking for a father figure with benefits|`|N4APv37Gaa	DADDYS?????!!!!!!!!!ok....|`|o9cAl8xhaa	I wouldn't call it a complex.

This is a Freudian theory that many psychologists prescribe to.    It is difficult, without proper analysis, to know for sure if the person has a complex or not.|`|alweKUW9aa	why should it be?  not at all...  this feeling may call back the unpresence of someone's father  in his life..  or just because...you like them more?|`|863D1b94aa	Hey there,  I love daddies...I think you do too as you are asking this question!! ;)    So,I hope what my answer would be..but am still telling..No dear gays who like daddies aren't complex,stupid or disgusting at all!!

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	A grotesque, elfin creature of folklore, thought to be more prone to mischief than any evil'    On the other hand the hobgoblin is an object or a source of fear, dread, or harassment; a bugbear.    A bugbear is a fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten children.    Again it is Humankind that is seeking fear and excitement that increases the infamy of a Magickal creature.|`|TOTFTdJRaa	No a elf is a youthful creature like a child or pre teen similar to peter pan that has magical powers and is usually associated with fertility or nature as in trees forests etc the metaphoric element is that of the holy spirit filled individuals that are forever young filled with love     A goblin is a gnome like creature phantom in origin and usually grotesque looking and very old they are said to be nomadic and are metaphorically associated with the devil as a minor demon they are to keep the will of the divine that aligns with necessary evil although then can twist what is necessary|`|bMuwuAVOaa	A goblin is an imaginary evil, crabby, and mischievous creature described as a grotesquely disfigured or gnome-like phantom, that may range in height from that of a dwarf to that of a human. They are attributed with various (sometimes conflicting) abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin. In some cases, goblins have been classified as constant annoying little creatures somewhat related with the brownie.  These creatures are known by a verity of names:hobgoblin,hob-thrush,billeeboinker... gooseys, Scottish hobgoblins are often called brags or boggart.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Pictures of goblins:    http://images.google.se/images?sourceid=...|`|9vTWgiGgaa	Yes. It's big, hairy, with yellow an green teeth. It has a receding hairline with dingy long nails for grabbing and scratching. The under arms of a goblin smells like an union shop. It has a muffin top (over pouring belly) The eyes are filled with crust from never bathing and cleaning his face. It is seven feet tall...and it's breath smalls like a pile of cow droppings.|`|eYwzlsk4aa	Elves, fairies, dwarves, goblins, and their kind have been written about and spoken of in every part of the world for hundreds of years. They have many names in many different languages, but still prefer to be called The Little People, The Good Neighbors, or The Helpers. They can be gentle, and generous, or dark and dangerous -- but even the most friendly can be unreliable.     Some little people choose to live with humans, they are known as redcaps in Holland; nis in Scandinavia; brownies or hobgoblins, or piskies in Great Britain; kobolds in Germany; and domovoy in Russia. Their names differ, but their behavior is similar. Each one will work loyally for his household, for little reward, as long as no one upsets him.     Brownies and goblins are small and raggedly dressed. They help with domestic chores, often at night. Brownies especially like to live on farms so they can work with animals. Piskies are similar, but less reliable.     Payment is always the same -- a bowl of the best milk or cream and some freshly baked cake or bread left for them to find. They are insulted if the offering is given to them directly. A gift of new clothes will send them away forever -- possibly because it offends them or because they consider themselves paid off. If you criticize or annoy them, they will play spiteful tricks on you. In fact, it is said that if a brownie is mad angry he could turn into a boggart. (A shape-shifter that will turn into your worst fear.)    Boggarts and goblins are evil creatures that fall within the wide and varied group of elvish beings called the Little People. Imps are somewhat different. Their names come from an Old English  word meaning, "young shoot" especially one that can be cut and used to grow a plant. It can be used affectionately for a mischievous child, but in fantasy it usually means an offshoot of the devil himself.     Sorry it's so long, there's quite a lot you need to know. Well, I hope I helped!

That's why we're doing so badly ;)    While nature tells nature how to live, humans have separated themselves from nature. Nature is not on the same wavelength as us anymore. We have virtually not communication with nature anymore.    So basically, nature keeps itself in balance by telling each and every member of this Eco system how to act in order to keep it balanced. Us humans have long since separated ourselves from it, at least we've stopped listening to it. We are basically trying to take control of it, we are trying to tell nature how it should live, but we are miserably failing!|`|SRFfK0BPaa	good question...    how do birds know how to fly south when it gets cold?

They are here to procreate..... we are here to evolve in society, procreate and make life better everyday. Plants grow-they dont think. Animals think to an extent, but not the way humans do.  Wouldnt it be cool if we had the same way of life- or- would it be?  I would choose to learn as we go.  With out that, we are really no more than any animal on earth.|`|AA11042354	Great question! I think to compare us to plants and trees isn't relevant as we're a higher and more complex life form. Regarding animals I'm pretty sure the vast majority of mammals are taught many things by their parent(s) or by instinct. Different mammals also have enhanced senses and different gifts such as being able to smell water, seeing in the dark etc. Considering this we can understand why different animals need less time to be independent. We are a weaker species compared to other mammals however, our brain and intelligence is our greatest gift. Mind you, some of my friends don't utilize that great gift. LOL|`|2yUQiKlvaa	well to be honest, how do you know this? you cant understand animals, so like maybe they are taught by their mothers before they are let go
rUgC7SPsaa	I don't think you should jump to any conclusions.  If the only evidence you are experiencing to suggest that you may be developing (discovering?) bi-sexual tendancies are your dreams, well, that's hardly evidence.  How do you feel in your waking life?  Do you have a desire to sexual connect with a woman?  How does your husband feel about that?  Would he be upset if you breached the marriage line, even if it were with another female?      These are all questions you will need to answer for yourself.  Don't be too hasty while trying to label yourself.  It's natural to feel attraction to other people, regardless of their sex.  Whether or not you take it to the next level, well that's up to you and your husband.|`|qUbVuwBeaa	I wouldn't say that it is unhealthy. Our dreams are like a gateway to our subconscious. Maybe deep down you'd like to have a girl-on-girl experience.

You don't have to do anything about it...enjoy the dreams, and if you want to take it further...talk to your husband about it.|`|j7rakyLmaa	It's very healthy, especially if you can talk about such dreams with your husband and get some mutual enjoyment out of them (it's just a dream after all, whether or not you're bi-curious, be open about it and don't leave your hubby wondering why you're suddenly jumpy and paranoid about the topic)|`|zsiuJbnuaa	Nooooo- it's normal. Trust me.  It's kind of like a phase.|`|6Cqj7D8zaa	I think there is nothing wrong with it.  You may be bi-curious and should tell your husband about it and explore the possibility of a controlled 3-some to find out.|`|7XUzSepRaa	Only you can know if you're becoming Bi-curious, imagine yourself sexually with a woman and see if it turns you on and if it does you could possible be bi-curious, nothing wrong with that but you should share it with your husband. Dreams are just dreams, yes sometimes the subconscious tells us something in our dreams but when you wake up it really is just a figment of your imagination.|`|7TJ2bkv3aa	your being weird. most straight people do not have homo dreams. i never have, nor have any of my close friends.|`|9q95w6vyaa	Any dream that isn't a nightmare (ie leaves you freaked out) is healthy in my books. I once dreamed I was a member of a penguin harem (my own dream, and I didn't even get to be the king!). Doesn't mean I want to have an orgy with penguins...    If you want to be with a woman, it won't be because of a dream you had. But because you consciously want to do it. If it feels right, go for it. If it's going to mess up your marriage, then cue the nightmare|`|dNF0fZrSaa	I think its natural for anyone to be curious, especially when its something taboo like that. (I say taboo because if you're a woman married to a man, and never been with a woman its something different and...well, taboo)    anyways, I don't think there is anything wrong with it, its happened to everyone, and anyone who says they haven't dreamed or thought about the same sex in that way is a liar.|`|gkoX68Awaa	Same sex dreams are very common in people who define themselves as "Straight" (Heterosexual). This does not mean you are a lesbian or are even going to "turn into one". If you were a lesbian or bisexual, you would already have a pretty good idea about it and your information would not have come from a sex dream.    Would a gay man, upon having a dream of sleeping with a woman, suddenly become straight ? The answer is no. Relax and enjoy your dreams. I notice, however, you called it a dream and not a nightmare. You won't "turn gay" from enjoying it, either.|`|zgBPtQXraa	No, u'r definitely not changing yr sexual orientation, it's completely normal thinking 'bout that, as long as it stays as a fantasy, u hav nothing 2 worry 'bout; now the question u should b doing yourself is: am I willing to bring those fantasies to reality? Do I want to experience this sexual practices? and only if u'r planning 2 do this, then u hav 2 talk it over with yr partner, otherwise u can keep it by yourself is yr right...|`|j5k0VRbPaa	its just a dream just ask your self do i like women and hopefully the answer is no  but its just a dream|`|7fpPupNraa	I think it's perfectly normal. What happens in your dreams, stays there. If you do fall in love with a woman in real life though, that's a bit of a different story...

Lk4aCBACaa	Ghosts? Undecided. I do think there are some paranormal phenomena that science can't explain yet, but will be able to one day. Until then, I remain open-minded to the possibility.    Aliens? Also undecided. I think it's illogical to assume that we're the only intelligent life in the universe, or that our planet is the only one in the entire universe that can support life. Do I think there's any "proof" that aliens have made contact? No. Do I think seeing a UFO automatically makes you a crazy person? No. People have seen a UFO have done just that: saw a flying object that they could not identify. That doesn't necessarily imply any belief in little green men. :)|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Yes|`|dL4x119gaa	i've really got no reason to think they're not real.|`|8tF9Py9Daa	GHOSTS:  No.    ALIENS:  The jury is still out, but if push came to shove I would say no.|`|JqHkgWROaa	I believe  in space snails...

I believe there is a 100% probability of aliens though.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Yes.  There is evidential proof for both.  A lot of people here are still in denial of them, why I don't know.....even after all the evidence.  It seems these folks haven't done the research but merely assume and come to their own conclusions.  But no matter how much evidence is produced if someone doesn't want to believe then they will not.    I have experienced the spiritual realm on ocassion ever since I was a little girl.  Not to the extent of 'A Haunting' however, but more subtle experiences, ones that I couldn't dismiss because some came true,others were messages that really helped me.  I don't know how that can be explained away by the imagination or delusion, unless the imagination can predict future events!  :)    http://www.youtube.com/v/5zYjvQ7OtVc&hl=  This is a very interesting clip from the History Channel about Unidentified Submerged Objects.

I mean... theres so many other galaxies out there why would we be the only ones?|`|OxuLUCX9aa	If you read the Old Testament book of Kings the Hebrews speak about the Ghost of Saul emerging and appearing to them so ghost are real also if you read the description about the angels and Yahweh from the ancient Hebrews all you get is the Hebrews describing alien beings who looked like 'men'. The Hebrews believed their leader Yahweh and his group flew in a 'chariot of fire' which is a flying vehicle which can easily be interpreted as a UFO.

No true prophet of God said this.  You must listen only to the true prophets when you hear a prophecy.  Be very careful not to listen to false prophets; there are many in the world.  Jesus said when the gospel has been preached in all the world to all nations, then the end will come.  We have not reached all nations.  The translators still have a lot of work to do as well as the Jesus film workers, and all evangelists, missionaries, pastors, and intercessors.    To get a little more wisdom on prophecy, read "Thus saith the Lord," by John Bevere.  This will help you understand what is true and what is false, and what we need to be aware of.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	No one does expect for God himself.

Ever since 1914, everybody conscious of trends in the world has been deeply troubled by what has seemed like a fated and predetermined march toward ever greater disaster. Many serious people have come to feel that nothing can be done to avert the plunge towards ruin. They see the human race, like the hero of a Greek tragedy, driven on by angry gods and no longer the master of fate.Bertrand Russell, The New York Times Magazine, September?27, 1953.

" that you are referring to, but I can tell you what the bible says..  2 Samuel 6:14-15 (King James Version)     14And David DANCED before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.      15So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with SHOUTING, and with the sound of the trumpet.    2 Samuel 22:30  For by thee I have RUN through a troop: by my God have I LEAPED over a wall.  Mark 9:15  And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.  1 Corinthians 9:24  Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.  1 Thessalonians 4:16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:    I know that some of these scriptures are referring to running spiritually, but why not run or dance or move when you get excited about what God has done for you?  People do not think it is strange when people get all excited at concerts or football games or whatever "idol" people are going crazy over, when people jump up and down or dance til they fall over, but when people worship God with all their might, some think it strange.  The God is serve is worthy of more worship, praise and adoration than any idol out there, so I will praise Him in any way that I can! The God that I serve is not quiet, and neither should we be.  1 Samuel 4:5  And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.  And just one more scripture    Acts 2:13-16 (King James Version)     13Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.      14But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:      15For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.      16But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;    So, when the Holy Ghost was poured out, people looked at the way these people were acting and thought that they were drunk.... obviously they were not sitting quietly with their hands on their laps.    When one truly feels the presence of God, you will move, you will react!      =)|`|nHizaTiDaa	And to think that those same "good Christians" probably WOULD condemn someone for taking a toke on their weekends!!!

I know most of those people will actually use cuss words to talk about the Catholic Church and i know this will get me ton's of thumbs down but it is the truth and that the girls in those churches not all mind you but a considerable amount were extremely interested in SEX. In fact True Channel just did a story about a murder and the Church all was attending a Apostolic Church and the killer Murdered his wife who the pastor had told them they should marry and the husband was having wild sex with his sister in law and while in Jail it became known him and the Pastors wife were engaged in wild sex. This all happened in Longmont Colorado.just a few short yrs back.

I am married to a woman, I am a male, I wear woman's clothing and am very happy in my marriage. Am I straight or gay or bisexual ? You decide. I know I am in love, I am loved, the person I am with loves me, knows me and supports me in every way (yes, I work too). And we have the cutest baby girl every bit her mother's daughter.    I think the terms gay, bi and hetero have finally worn themselves out in our language, especially since they are used to categorize and hurt so often.    If you "must" have a label for it, I am straight. But I prefer the label "husband" or "married" if you need to call me something when you see me in a dress, I prefer "Sindee".    The best label for your father would have been "Dad" or something along that line. He probably was a good father since he was in touch with his feminine side, at least, I hope he was.|`|SnW6xiC2aa	Cross dressers cut across all spectrum's of sexuality.  They can be conventional, and unconventional sexually.  Don't think linear.  Think in terms of a "smear".|`|AA11454904	Polls and surveys taken over the years indicate that 90% of all crossdressers are totally heterosexual and have no desires or intentions to be anything else. The other 10% are those which others have already mentioned.    Crossdressing is probably the most misunderstood point along the entire spectrum of the 'trans'  community. Most crossdressers actually prefer the term "crossdresser" as opposed to "transvestite" since the latter is all too often misinterpreted with such terms and descriptions as transsexual. The typical crossdresser began in adolescence, usually between the ages of 6 and 12. Bear in mind that at these ages, there is no knowledge of sexual activities so it is in error to associate crossdressing with such. With the same polls and surveys indicating that approximately 10% of the entire male population crossdress to some extent on a regular basis, it isn't as uncommon as most might believe. For some it only involves an item or two of feminine attire while for others its everything from head to toe. Regardless as to whatever the scenario, it is becoming more evident as time goes on that it is something that a person is BORN with as opposed to something that they take an interest in and volunteer to participate in. The biggest problems that crossdressers face is the general public's complete lack of knowledge about what crossdressing really is - but even more importantly what it ISN'T. About the only thing most people know about crossdressing is the erroneous information they are 'fed'  from programs such as Jerry Springer and those who are ACTUAL crossdressers will tell you very quickly that what you see on such programs is about as far from the truth as the north pole is from the south pole.    For some factual information about crossdressing, see the web site listed below.

Or when they see people calling themselves "Christians" walking around with pickit signs saying "God hates fags" etc. They think Christians are hateful and preach a message of hate.     That's not the purpose of Christianity. Our duty as Christians is what it says in Mark 16:15, we are to preach the Gospel to every living creature.     Bad News is:   You are a sinner, you need to be forgiven in order to go to heaven when you die. If you don't repent (turn away) from your sin, there is no possible way you can be saved. Saved from what? Saved from eternal torment in hell, saved from everlasting separation from God     Good News (Gospel) is:   Jesus came to earth 2,000 years ago in order to make a Way for us to enter heaven. Because no matter how much we try we will always mess up. That is why we are saved by the grace and faith of our Lord Jesus. We are saved by faith, not by works.     Ask Jesus to forgive you of all your sins, and follow Him as long as you live! Confess He is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead and you will be saved!    God Bless you!|`|jdRKZe18aa	SHOULD?  Well that's a pretty over stated question I think.  PEOPLE just naturally judge, whether they should or shouldn't, right or wrong they/we all just do this.  We judge all things based on our own personal life experiences and perspectives - it's that simple.    So a non-christian will obviously judge a christian based on his own experiences with christians and his own knowledge, or lack thereof about christianity and what they were raised to believe or not believe about god as well.  No rocket science here - it's pretty basic with all of us.  JUDGE NOT that ye not be judged wouldn't be a part of a non believers perspective - so why not do it?

People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|eBKJRmEgaa	If God wanted us to believe in him he would have given evidence of his existence.|`|cNniG2L0aa	If you don't question, you end up with religion.  ~|`|c91032f4386f0b1ceea8747a91b30331aa	Why should He have to forgive us for anything if we don't first ask for it, and mean it.

Why would a god who has made himself invisible to us then throw us into everlasting torment for not believing in him.  It is a misconception that as humans we are meant to worship a god.  We are here to get to know self.  Just because the universe created us does not mean that our purpose is to dedicate our life to prayer, church and what not.  We are here to find happiness.  God does not need recognition.  God needs nothing.  He gave us a brain, he would want us to use it.  God (the universe) communicates to us through feeling and thought.  The highest thought is the answer you need.  If you gut says there is no god and says so strongly, then that is 'your' truth and so it is.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	God doesnt punish you for not believing in Him or doubting Him.

Even through science.  But, if you're as much into science as you say, you would know that even a hypothesis cannot be 100% true. Ever.  It can either be disproved completely or true.    Therefore, if God cannot be DISPROVED, what else is left to conclude but that he does, indeed, exist?      Anyway, to answer your question, God does not intend to punish us for questioning, nor denying. In order to find him, one must seek him.    I'll just leave you with this. Faith is being sure of what you hope for and certain of what you cannot see. So, have a little faith. He is out there.    But, if you were to die tomorrow as a non-believer, could you really blame him for not letting you into the gates of heaven? It just doesn't work like that. You get in, if you have the desire to go there after death.    Hope this helps, and best wishes! =]|`|OQdPzl15aa	I don't think God expects blind faith from us; after all, he gave us brains, critical reasoning skills and amazing scientists.  God doesn't punish people for doubting or for seeking the truth with the tools they have.    However, what do you mean "lack of evidence"?  Perhaps there is evidence all around, but you choose to not accept it as proof.  I feel that the complexity of a human body is evidence enough, that there is a God; whether he created us in a day or via millions of years through evolution.    "If" God is real, and you feel you need more evidence, just ask him to reveal himself to you in a way you can understand.  He isn't going to hide from those who are seeking him.|`|N4ZQhklSaa	Hey, chick I love science too, but I also listen to my friend the mushroom. Your taking the Bible way too literally, if the Bible isn't your thing then look into like Hinduism. The Bhagavad Gita is a great text, so are the Vedas. I like to ask that same like question, if the world is all determined then why can I question my own existence? I think if you want to understand the concept of god and spirit, I think it would best to take some mushrooms and squeegee your third eye, the late saint Bill Hicks commands you to. I do not think you can ever find god from reading a book or hearing what someone says. It has to come from your experience, that is all what you know really.|`|DS9NLiaBaa	WOW! iv never actually thought about that!

I think you are right that we don't have ANY evidence at ALL but Oh well!|`|AA11225089	Those who know God would say that there is plenty of evidence. The Bible is evidence in itself, but it also says that creation is evidence, so that nobody has an excuse to not know God. Possibly every culture has a concept of God and eternity inbuilt because we know that we aren't meant for death, the soul is eternal.    Science can tell us many things but it can't explain how life started (the bible can), why we are here (the bible can) and what we are made for (the bible can). The Bible gives us the answer to every philosophical mystery along those lines.    God is forgiving yes, but only to those who ask for it. It's a free gift but you first must believe that you need forgiveness and believe that Jesus can give it. Harder than it sounds, especially if, like me, you were brought up to believe science has all the answers.     I became a Christian when I had a real encounter with Jesus/holy spirit/God, on the beach at a baptism service. I only went because a friend invited me! God had been calling me, I hadn't heard him. If you truly want to know God, ask Him to be real to you, He has never turned any true seeker away.    Or try an Alpha Course, to ask any question.    The Bible does tell us to use our mind and reasoning to understand these things, so don't believe anyone who tells you that faith is 'blind' or 'brainwashing.'    Keep asking questions, it's a good thing.|`|5ljN0M2Caa	God will punish all those who do not embrace His only Begotton Son the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour whilst they are here living their life on earth.     When your life is over and you stand before a Holy and a  Just God and you have not repented of your sins, believed in His Son who died upon  the Cross to save people from Hell, then He will punish those who rejected His Son.    God will reject all those who will not turn to Him and be saved.   All of us know that we are created by God. His laws and Truth are written upon everyones hearts. Men and women try their utmost to surpress the truth and forget it. But as the sky is blue and no one can deny that , So is God true.   God will only forgive a person when that person comes to God will a willing heart, repenting and a sorrowful heart over their sin against God. God looks at the heart. If He sees a repenting, humble heart, He will give much needed grace for the sinner to beg for forgiveness.    If this does not take place the sinner will remain in his sins and will die that way. With no more chance of being redeemed.

So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.         Rom 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks.

Many faiths encourage people to examine these very questions. We won't necessarily find the answers but it can help to understand the mystery of God.    As a person of science, can you accept the existence of electrons without seeing them? Even science involves a degree of faith. Love is another example. You can't see it, touch it, taste it or smell it yet no-one denies it's existence. We cannot PROVE love exists but we can see the results from acts of love; parents caring for children, etc. Similarly, we cannot prove God does or does not exist in scientific terms, but we can see  the wonderful products of God-in the happy accident of the wonder of creation, the joy we experience through friends and family and the freedom of free will itself. Personally I don't think this wonderful world could have all happened by  a happy scientific accident. For me, that is the evidence  I need that something (God) meant all  this to happen.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Like yeah.    The whole bit where he goes (--imagine this bit in a really deep voice--) "I am an angry and vengeful God, you shall worship me and only me and no other god" , kind of suggests he isn't all that big on being merciful towards those who question him.    So, um, I would watch out. Or that big jealous, angry fella will smite you. Since he's really into all that smiting stuff.|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	    No there are lots of evidence surrounding us ... could u imagine that anything in your home was made by itself ... the chair , it's made by the carpenter... the computer ,was made by the engineering .. the lamps, the mirror, the TV.. the radio ...the carpets ...everything must be made by someone ...so ...    who made the trees, th mountains, the sees , the planets, the human beings, the animals, the insects, the ...the ...the... of course there must be some one who made them .....     All of the things surrounding us tell us about God ... also God sent us The Holly Qur'an Which gives us lots of evidence about God's True ... such as the earth creating ...    Maybe u don't read The Qur'an ...maybe u don't know about It from trusted resources ... maybe u don't like to know ...maybe u don't like to hear or think seriously .... so if any of these reasons , It would be from yourself not from God ....    so don't say that there is a lack of evidence ....|`|zYixEacraa	this is a joke that our modern fellowship was fallen down, in lies, in corruption and interesting by the religions part's...

Forgiving is only possible when the transgressor is truly sorry. As for science, it always goes by the evidence of imperial data. In other words, when conducting an experiment, whatever the data shows as the outcome is the accepted answer. God's existence has been accepted and proven many times throughout all generations. Whereas evolution has not been proven. Over 700 scientists have signed a statement saying they are skeptical of random mutation and natural selection forthe complexity of life.|`|8XqfYG2Baa	Yes its called faith for a reason, but with out questioning the existence of god it will just be blind faith.

But if you are against me then you  believe there is. if you agree with me and if someone tells you how was Jesus born say Mary cheated. Also if they say how was the earth created say Evolution dahh and walk away. GOD is not real and he will never be. religion has a way of destroying things. because of all the wars we have on the subject. Our world would be different without religion but better. i used believer in  god before i learned the facts it helped me . what my boyfriend always tells every one do you believe in Hairy Potter being real with Magic and everything no i hope so then just don't care what people say GOD is not real. If her is not real then there is no WORY FOR FORGIVNESS FRON SOMETHING IS NOT REAL sorry caps lock was on.

Such Joy in the face of all unholiness is the lot of the Believer.    Have a great day!|`|Z6TNsJluaa	As for me, True Christianity is when a born again believer has been empowered by the Holy Spirit of Almighty God and being anointed by the Lord Jesus Christ,Himself. For one, not only be Christ-like in mind, spirit and body but also to do the works of Christ by casting out devils, laying hands on the sick, restoring sight to the blind, allowing the lame to walk again and raising the dead to life again. This is only one part of the Christian walk as in fulfilling their calling as a true king of the Lord Jesus. The other part is their Priesthood..Every born again spirit filled Christian has the rights and authority as a king but as in their priesthood, they are able to go into the most holy place of God, where divine relationship and fellowship takes place by true worship, praise and thanksgiving..Christians who have not experienced this anointing from Christ, are missing the mark of true Christianity.. Christians are to be Christ-like..To be just like Christ and when they are anything other, they are carnal, self indulged, self willed, self ruled, and some, even used by Satan Himself. The holy Scriptures clearly state that those who are lead by the Holy Spirit of God, they are the children of God. The Holy Spirit leads us to Jesus, glorifies Jesus on our behalf and teaches us just how to be more like Christ in both works and deeds but those who are not being lead by the Holy Spirit are in fact being guided by an unholy evil spirit of Antichrist, and displays it's carnel fruit and nature and in the same sense to do evil instead of that which is good.. There are only two types of people in the world at large. Those who belong to God by the Holy Spirit of God and those who belong to Satan , by the unholy spirit of the Antichrist. One type is being lead to heaven and the other being lead into hell and world religions doesn't change this fact at all.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	There is indeed a LOT more to it than that. The Bible is our wellspring, to train us and refresh us in God's Holy Word. But beyond that some of us are called to teach others, some are called to care for and administer to the needs of others, some are called to inspire others, some are called to expose the darkness and draw the savable out of the shadows.  But above all, we are all of us called to share the Gospel of Christ with the world. Being a Christian is not at all sit down and wait job, it is a...     Go Out and Do Something for God Job     There is so much to do and so little time left to do it so we all need to get busy.|`|xPeIvywdaa	if you do the process just to go to heaven, then you wont really become what you should become|`|MIyMPgC4aa	i hear ya brother. im a christian, and im as confused as you are. sometimes it just makes NO sense|`|blgRK8Ebaa	Our overall goal is to glorify Christ though our lives.  By living out of an overflow of our love for him, we show others the joy that can be had by trusting in him.  So no, we don't live to die.|`|wig4qCeJaa	For me, it is to live by the teachings of Christ.    To have ones' faith based only on salvation, heaven, or some other reward-based religion, is evil.|`|yugLcDE2aa	No, our goal should be to be surrendered to God's will, allowing Him to change us into the likeness of His Son, who went around doing good. We should be reflections of His love to the world, as we surrender to Him, and His Holy Spirit fills us with His love it overflows to all around us. Complete surrender, death of self, and total dependence upon our God who will then work His will of love through us should be our earthly goal. Loving is what it means to be a Christian..|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	We are to love like Jesus loved!  We are to help others in need, and bring more to Christ, so that they can know God's love.  We are to glorify God in everything we do.  It's tough, but we must strive to do this.      Sure, read the Bible, it's God's Word.  Have an intimate relationship with God, pray to Him constantly and read His Word for wisdom.|`|ERqP6TgOaa	....lol....i can see you got a kick outta asking this soo....not trying to be critical....    The Original Faith of Christianity...  ...in general christians believe in following the commandments, honoring sacraments, going to mass every weekend, and to try to be a morally good person to everyone they meet.    ...the goal is that after "life"...there is life in heaven where there will be everlasting peace for eternity...    ...thats about it....but there is the Holy Bible to consider, church doctrines...    Other types...  .... "depending upon the hundreds of Christian denominations"...like for real the Klu Klux Klan and satanists...considers themselves a Christian organization lol...so however one interprets different churches of the wide variety of christian denominations...theres alot to choose from.... =)....|`|0JE41mXsaa	Christianity is dynamic and powerful, a well-spring of life eternal, a source of consolation in sorrows and a cause for great spiritual joys.    It allows the reformation of mankind and freedom from sins that have him enslaved.  It is a way to become Christ-like, like God!  And to be heirs of the promise... to become the sons and daughters of God.      So what does all that wonderful stuff actually mean?  Through becoming a member of the mystical Body of Christ - the Church - we gain:  a) A community of like-minded believers for our family and friends  b) Access to Divine Grace and the Mysteries of God through the Sacraments  c) Strength to overcome our personal weaknesses and flaws irrespective of whether it has come to us from our environment or from our family history  d) The promise of an eternity of ascending from "glory to glory" and beholding God face to face.    Does anything good come without cost?  Of course not.  God will help those of us that help ourselves and make use of the tools that He has given us.  e.g. If we want freedom from the sin of greed, it will require God's help and our own actions of giving to the poor.  If initially we fail, then we confess, partake of the Holy Gifts and try again.  Eventually by the grace of God and our efforts in cooperation we will become better people.  A worthy goal in and of itself.|`|oo1jL45Baa	I believe you are asking two questions.  The purpose of our salvation is to that we are freed from the rightful judgment that God would place upon us for our sin.    Our purpose here on earth is made clear in Matthew 24.  As believers we are left here on earth and given our "marching orders" by Jesus to "go out and make disciples".  In other words our job while here on earth is to spread to everyone we possibly can the good news of the Gospel --> that salvation comes from repentance and faith in our Savior, Jesus.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	Interesting question.    1 Corinthians 4:20 says, "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power."    Jesus made it very clear when He said, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."

You also need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and this will put a fire in your bones and start you going forward at lightning speed for Christ.  There is much much more to do and to learn.  The Lord will give you gifts of the spirit when you are baptized in the Holy Ghost.  Members of the Kingdom of God are not just floating around wondering where it's all at.  We have assignments.  Read Luke 3:16, Acts 1:5, 8 and Acts 2:4, then the whole book of Acts and ask Jesus to baptize you in the Holy Ghost.  God needs each one of us in his army.  He needs strong soldiers to fight.  We are in a spiritual warfare.    The whole world is in wickedness.  There are masses of confused miserable people waiting for someone to care.

We should spread the good news to others and reflect it in our behavior.  Acts of kindness and other "good works" are also a part of living for Christ, but they do not indicate salvation.  It was a free gift of eternal life in God's presence purchased by the blood of Christ who saved us from our sins.  We can do nothing to earn our salvation.

A matria  o pensamento de Deus, uma cria??o mental do TODO conhecido no Egito antigo e de Moiss,  ou o "Todo Poderoso" do cristianismo.|`|GH01a6Jqaa	Conforme registrado na Bblia, Jesus disse que Deus  Esprito. (Jo?o 4:24) Isto quer dizer que o Criador n?o possui um corpo fsico de carne, assim como ns. Isso n?o deve ser difcil de ser aceito por aqueles que est?o familiarizados com realidades invisveis, tais como a gravidade, o magnetismo e as ondas de rdio. Uma grande diferen?a com Deus, porm,  que ele  uma Pessoa viva e inteligente, com qualidades que podemos discernir. Quais s?o algumas delas?     J observou alguma vez enormes ondas abaterem-se contra uma costa rochosa? Ou j observou a tremenda for?a dum vulc?o? Estas s?o apenas indica??es em pequena escala do poder que o Criador deve ter, porque foi ele quem fez a terra e suas for?as.     Os cientistas explicam, com a famosa equa??o de Einstein, E=mc2, que toda a matria n?o  nada mais do que energia encerrada em tomos bsicos. Os homens mostraram que isso  assim por meio da explos?o de suas bombas at?micas. Mas, sabia que essas tremendas explos?es liberam menos de um por cento do potencial energtico dos tomos? Imagine o espantoso poder do Criador, que juntou todos os tomos no universo. Milhares de anos antes de Einstein nascer, as Escrituras reconheceram que o Ser Supremo  a fonte de enorme energia. (Isaas 40:29)  com boa raz?o que as Escrituras o chamam repetidas vezes de Deus Todo-poderoso.  Gnesis 17:1; Revela??o 11:17.     Deus tem usado muitas vezes o seu poder de maneira a afetar diretamente os homens. Um exemplo disso  o xodo, quando Deus libertou Moiss e os israelitas do Egito. Talvez queira ler em voz alta o breve relato disso em xodo 13:21 a 14:31. Imagine-se entre os que estavam sendo protegidos por uma espantosa coluna de nuvem, de dia, e por uma flamejante coluna de fogo  noite. Como se teria sentido quando parecia que o exrcito perseguidor o tinha encurralado contra o Mar Vermelho? Imagine, porm, observar Deus usar seu poder para formar a gua em altas muralhas em ambos os lados, para que voc pudesse escapar. Que Deus!  xodo 15:1,?2,?11; Daniel 4:35.     O xodo mostrou tambm a capacidade de Deus de realizar coisas  distancia. Para isto, ele usa sua invisvel for?a ativa, seu esprito, ou esprito santo. Embora esta for?a ativa seja impessoal, ela pode exercer poder, igual a uma forte brisa de ar. Deus usou seu esprito para criar o universo material. (Salmo 33:6; Gnesis 1:2) Mas ele tambm pode us-lo para fortalecer e ajudar pessoas.  Juzes 14:5,?6; Salmo 143:10     Quem projeta e depois monta certa mquina certamente tem conhecimento de sua estrutura e funcionamento. Portanto, n?o nos assegura aquilo que vemos na terra e nos cus que Deus tem um vasto conhecimento? Os qumicos passam a vida toda procurando entender a constitui??o das substancias naturais. Quanto conhecimento deve ter Aquele que criou estas substancias! Tambm, os cientistas estudam a clula e as formas minsculas de vida. O Criador tinha de conhecer estes campos cabalmente para poder produzir a vida em primeiro lugar!     O conhecimento de Deus abrange toda a extens?o do universo. Ele pode chamar por nome todos os bilh?es de estrelas que criou. (Isaas 40:26) Depois de falar apenas sobre parte do vasto conhecimento de Deus, o homem chamado J confessou humildemente: Fiquei sabendo que s capaz de fazer todas as coisas, e n?o h idia que te seja inalcan?vel. (J 42:2) N?o temos amplos motivos para pensar o mesmo?     Deus  tambm a personifica??o da sabedoria, porque aplica seu conhecimento com bom xito. Por exemplo, projetou as plantas para que possam combinar gua e bixido de carbono do ar na forma de a?cares e amidos, necessrios como alimentos para homens e animais. As plantas podem tambm fabricar complexas gorduras, protenas e vitaminas, que usamos para manter-nos com sade. Todo o nosso alimento depende dum espantoso ciclo que envolve o sol, a chuva, os relampagos e as bactrias no solo. (Jeremias 10:12; Isaas 40:12-15) Ao passo que se chega a aprender os tratos de Deus, chega-se a apreciar no cora??o por que certo escritor bblico exclamou:  profundidade das riquezas, e da sabedoria, e do conhecimento de Deus! (Romanos 11:33) N?o  assim que gostaria de sentir-se a respeito do Deus que recebe a sua adora??o?|`|xermJg6Eaa	Desde que voc n?o confunda o Universo com Deus, como fazem algumas filosofias muito em moda, como a Nova Era, por exemplo, pode pensar no problema pelo resto da vida.|`|4MqPMwxtaa	O Universo  Deus.

A alguns anos atrs conheci um padre que de vez em quando freqentava a zona. Hoje ele  muito querido na sua comunidade e n?o se envolve com ningum. Isso acontece devido a regras impostas pela igreja e na minha opini?o vai contra aos dogmas pregados por Jesus Cristo.

Esta posi??o, nos tempos antigos, freqentemente era ocupada por um escravo fiel. (Veja Gn 24:2; tambm o caso de Jos, em Gn 39:1-6.) Na ilustra??o de Jesus, o mordomo, no come?o, s foi encarregado da supervis?o e do fornecimento no tempo apropriado dos alimentos ao corpo de ajudantes, ou servos, do amo, e, depois, por ter cuidado fiel e discretamente deste ministrio, sua designa??o foi ampliada para abranger a supervis?o de todos os bens do amo. Quanto  identifica??o do amo (gr.: kyrios, tambm traduzido por senhor), Jesus j mostrara que ele mesmo ocupava tal posi??o com rela??o aos seus discpulos, e ocasionalmente estes se dirigiam a ele como tal. (Mt 10:24,?25; 18:21; 24:42; Jo 13:6, 13) Resta a pergunta sobre a quem se aplica a figura do escravo, ou mordomo, fiel e discreto, e o que representa distribuir ele alimentos aos domsticos.    Comentadores, n?o raro, consideram isso como uma exorta??o geral a todos os que ocupam cargos especficos de responsabilidade na congrega??o crist?. O requisito de fidelidade no desincumbimento das responsabilidades claramente se aplica a todos estes. (Veja Mt 25:14-30; Tit 1:7-9.) Todavia, a impossibilidade de cada uma destas pessoas ser colocada ao mesmo tempo sobre todos os bens do seu amo, por ocasi?o da chegada dele,  bvia. No entanto, isto n?o exige que o escravo prefigure apenas uma determinada pessoa com tal privilgio. As Escrituras contm exemplos do uso de um substantivo no singular para se referir a um grupo coletivo, como no caso em que Jeov se dirigiu ao grupo coletivo da na??o israelita e lhe disse: Vs sois as minhas testemunhas [plural], .?.?. sim, meu servo [singular] a quem escolhi. (Is 43:10) De modo similar, a figura de um infiel escravo mau pode aplicar-se a um grupo coletivo, do mesmo modo em que se mostra que o anticristo  uma classe constituda por anticristos individuais. ?1Jo 2:18; 2Jo?7.    Aqueles que constituem a congrega??o crist? s?o chamados pelo apstolo Paulo de membros da famlia de Deus (Ef 2:19; 1Ti 3:15), e o mesmo apstolo mostra que o fiel servi?o de mordomo entre tais membros da famlia envolve a distribui??o das verdades espirituais de que se alimentariam aqueles que se tornassem crentes. (1Co 3:2,?5; 4:1,?2; compare isso com Mt 4:4.) Embora esta fosse uma das principais responsabilidades dos designados como pastores do rebanho (1Pe 5:1-3), o apstolo Pedro mostra que tal administra??o das verdades divinas foi realmente confiada a todos os escolhidos, a todos os ungidos pelo esprito, da congrega??o crist?. (1Pe 1:1,?2; 4:10,?11) Assim, a inteira congrega??o crist?, ungida, devia servir numa administra??o unida, distribuindo essas verdades. Ao mesmo tempo, os membros individuais que constituem esse corpo composto, ou os domsticos que constituem a casa de Deus (Mt 24:45; He 3:6; Ef 2:19), seriam tambm os beneficiados com o alimento distribudo. (He 5:11-14; compare isso com 1Co 12:12, 19-27.) Manter a fidelidade at a prometida chegada do amo resultaria em maiores responsabilidades. ?Mt 24:46,?47; Lu 12:43,?44.

FlZPVNE7aa	A voz da conscincia no ntimo    Sempre que pessoas das na??es, que n?o tm lei, fazem por natureza as coisas da lei, .?.?. s?o quem demonstra que a matria da lei est escrita nos seus cora??es, ao passo que a sua conscincia lhes d testemunho.  Rom. 2:14,?15.    HOJE em dia, o que  certo ou errado est num estado de constante mudan?a. Num discurso sobre a Moralidade Pblica, o Dr.?Emanuel Demby declarou: Um motivo importante pelo qual nos  t?o difcil especificar a natureza moral exata de nossos tempos  que s?o um perodo de grande transi??o. Aquilo que apenas h poucos anos atrs foi amplamente seguido como normas aceitas j foi alterado ou substitudo. E, visto que a vida se torna cada vez mais difcil, quem pode dizer qu?o vlidas s?o as novas normas ou por quanto tempo durar?o? Que orienta??o  que temos?    Esta situa??o confronta especialmente a ns, os que vivemos desde 1914?E.?C. Por que especialmente desde ent?o? O Dr.?Archibald Chisholm observou: T?o grande tem sido o transtorno em pensamento e moral, que alguns tm sugerido que devemos considerar-nos como vivendo no ano [61] A.?B. (anno belli [o ano da guerra]), indicando assim seu ponto de vista de que come?ou uma nova poca com o irrompimento da Primeira Guerra Mundial. O mero fato de ter havido tal transtorno em pensamento e moral desde 1914 salienta nossa necessidade duma voz orientadora, de dire??o correta.     Muitos dos que se apercebem desta necessidade expressam o ponto de vista de que, afinal, cada um devia estribar-se na sua conscincia. Dizem: Deixe que a sua conscincia o guie. Com conscincia querem dizer que cada pessoa parece ter no ntimo uma voz, um senso ntimo que lhe diz o que  certo ou errado. Mas, d-se isso em todos os casos? Sabe qual  a fonte da conscincia e qu?o ampla ela ? Tambm, sabe qu?o fidedigno  tal senso ntimo? Mesmo que outros possam depender de sua prpria conscincia, poder voc, leitor, fazer o mesmo?    A CONSCINCIA  DONDE PROVM?    Se buscasse dos intelectuais e dos filsofos uma explica??o da fonte de sua conscincia, talvez fosse informado de que ela  apenas o produto social da evolu??o. A opini?o do evolucionista Charles Darwin era que qualquer animal, dotado de instintos sociais bem acentuados, .?.?. inevitavelmente adquiria um senso moral ou conscincia assim que suas faculdades intelectuais ficassem t?o bem ou quase t?o bem desenvolvidas como no homem. E Sigmund Freud achava que podamos rejeitar a sugest?o duma capacidade original  como se poderia dizer, natural  de discriminar entre o bem e o mal.    Mas, representam tais conceitos a verdadeira explica??o? O registro mais antigo e mais coerentemente fidedigno da histria e dos tratos do homem responde: N?o! Em primeiro lugar, a Bblia diz corretamente aquilo que tem sido confirmado pela observa??o cientfica, que todas as coisas vivas se reproduzem segundo a sua espcie. Assim, o homem n?o  mero produto da evolu??o, nem o  sua conscincia. (Gn. 1:21-26) Alm disso, a Bblia identifica com exatid?o a fonte da voz no seu ntimo, a sua conscincia, leitor. Ela mostra por que  apesar dos esfor?os de homens tais como Hitler, que se gabava de libertar o homem da degradante quimera conhecida como conscincia  os homens, em toda a terra, continuam a ter conscincia. E ela pode ajudar-nos a usar e a tirar proveito da conscincia.    As Escrituras nos dizem que o Criador fez o homem  Sua prpria imagem, com inteligncia e senso moral, assim como o prprio Deus os possui. (Gn. 1:27) E logo desde o come?o, o primeiro homem possua uma conscincia dada por Deus; n?o era algo que simplesmente se desenvolveu com o aumento da sociedade humana. Isto se pode ver no relato sobre as a??es e atitudes de Ad?o depois de ele ter violado a ordem de Deus a respeito da rvore do conhecimento do que  bom e do que  mau. (Gn. 2:17) O registro diz que Ad?o e Eva, ent?o, foram esconder-se da face de Jeov Deus entre as rvores. E quando Jeov falou, Ad?o n?o respondeu prontamente. Por que n?o? Porque sentia sua culpa; era como se houvesse no seu ntimo uma voz que o condenasse, acusando-o e testificando que ele havia pecado.  Gn. 3:7-10.|`|41462fd531ff15751bbfc44f4543d3e0aa	TICOLELE...

430ab7a92c08b372044b762a697eb09aaa	N?o  necessariamente dessa forma.  Na escala do tempo da histria da Terra a vida de um ser humano  um mero piscar de olhos. Nascemos, vivemos e morremos - e ent?o n?o mais somos "lembrados". A morte  como um sono sem sonhos do qual nunca acordamos - nossa conscincia suprimida para sempre. Se esta vida  tudo o que se apresenta, qual  o seu sentido? Se estamos todos fadados a morrer de qualquer forma, que diferen?a faz do que fazemos nossas vidas?    Podemos influenciar as vidas de outras pessoas, mas elas tambm est?o condenadas  morte. Em algumas poucas gera??es a maioria de nossas realiza??es ser totalmente esquecida, a memria de nossas vidas reduzidas a um mero nome entalhado numa lpide ou escrito numa rvore genealgica.    Em alguns sculos at nossas tumbas se tornar?o ilegveis pela a??o do tempo, restos de ossos ser?o tudo o que restar de ns. Exceto pela fossiliza??o, at estes ossos ser?o desintegrados e nada de ns restar. Tudo do que fomos feitos ser absorvido por outros organismos - plantas, animais, e at outros seres humanos. Novas espcies aparecer?o, florescer?o, e desaparecer?o, rapidamente substitudas por outras que preencher?o o nicho deixado pela sua extin??o. A humanidade tambm sucumbir  extin??o. Toda a vida na terra ser varrida quando nosso sol moribundo tornar-se uma gigante vermelha, engolindo finalmente a Terra. Finalmente, o universo tornar-se- incapaz de permitir a existncia de qualquer tipo de vida devido  sua eterna expans?o, deixando apenas calor residual e buracos ******, ou sen?o se contrair novamente unindo toda a matria e energia num nico Grande Buraco *****. De qualquer forma, toda a vida no universo desaparecer para sempre.   Estas considera??es uma vez levaram Bertrand Russell a concluir que qualquer filosofia da qual valesse a pena falar seriamente teria de se fundamentar numa "funda??o firme de incontrolvel desespero". A morte torna a vida sem sentido? Apesar de muitas pessoas acharem que sim, um momento de reflex?o ir mostrar que a morte  irrelevante para a quest?o do sentido da vida: se os seres humanos fossem naturalmente imortais - isto , se n?o houvesse nada parecido com a morte - ainda assim a quest?o sobre o sentido da vida persistiria. A afirma??o de que a vida  sem sentido porque termina em morte relaciona-se com a afirma??o de que tudo o que tem sentido precisa durar para sempre. O fato de muitas das coisas s quais damos valor (como o relacionamento com outras pessoas) e atividades que achamos valiosas (como trabalhar numa campanha poltica ou educar uma crian?a) n?o durarem para sempre mostra que a vida n?o precisa ser eterna para ter sentido. Podemos mostrar tambm que a vida n?o precisa durar para sempre para ter algum sentido atravs de exemplos de vidas que duram para sempre e s?o inteis. Na mitologia Grega Ssifo  punido pelos deuses por ter dado conhecimento divino aos humanos. Sua puni??o  ser for?ado a rolar uma enorme pedra at o topo de uma montanha. Assim que a pedra chega ao topo, ela  rolada novamente at a base da montanha. Ssifo est condenado a repetir esta tarefa intil por toda a eternidade. A dura??o de nossas vidas nada tem a ver com elas terem ou n?o sentido.  ir?nico que tantas pessoas n?o tenham atentado para este ponto j que a puni??o eterna contida em O Mito de Ssifo de Albert Camus  o arqutipo da existncia intil.   A morte aparenta significar a falta de sentido da vida para muitas pessoas porque elas sentem que n?o h motivo em desenvolver o carter ou aumentar o prprio conhecimento se nossos progressos ser?o em ltima instancia tomados pela morte. Entretanto, h um motivo para desenvolver o carter e desenvolver o conhecimento antes da morte nos alcan?ar: dar paz e satisfa??o intelectual s nossas vidas e s vidas daqueles com quem ns nos importamos, porque perseguir estes objetivos enriquece nossas vidas. Partir do fato de que a morte  inevitvel n?o implica em dizermos que tudo o que fazemos n?o faz diferen?a. Pelo contrrio, nossas vidas tm grande importancia para ns. Se elas n?o tivessem, n?o acharamos a idia de nossa morte t?o desesperadora - n?o faria diferen?a se nossas vidas iriam acabar ou n?o. O fato de irmos todos morrer algum dia n?o tem correla??o com a quest?o de nossas atividades valerem ou n?o a pena aqui e agora: para um paciente doente num hospital os esfor?os de um mdico em aliviar sua dor certamente importam, independentemente do fato de tanto o paciente quanto o mdico (e em ltima anlise todo o universo) acabar?o morrendo algum dia.   Mas o que  que faz com que tantas pessoas sintam que suas vidas em ltima anlise s?o inteis? O fato de que todos ns um dia iremos morrer  uma raz?o para este sentimento, mas n?o  a nica. A outra raz?o para que tantas pessoas sintam que a vida n?o tem sentido  que, at onde a cincia pode mostrar, n?o h nenhum propsito maior para nossas vidas. Uma vis?o cientfica do mundo retrata a origem dos seres humanos como "o resultado da coloca??o acidental de tomos". Tanto individual quanto coletivamente, seres humanos vieram a existir devido a probabilidades. Como indivduos nossa existncia foi possvel devido ao sucesso reprodutivo de nossos ancestrais; como espcie nossa existncia foi determinada pelas muta??es que acabaram por conferir uma vantagem adaptativa a nossos ancestrais evolutivos no ambiente em que se encontravam. Devido ao fato de n?o podermos discernir qualquer indica??o de que fomos postos neste planeta para servir a um propsito dado a ns por um ser inteligente, nossa existncia n?o parece fazer parte de nenhum plano maior. Se a ausncia de um propsito maior  o que faz a vida ser em ltima instancia sem sentido, nossas vidas seriam igualmente inteis se fossem eternas. Da mesma forma, se fazer parte de um propsito maior desse a nossas vidas um senti|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Veja o filme o sentido da vida do monthy Phayton.|`|ezA0P1Pdaa	A Incerteza,  a nica semente que vinga na existencia Humana.

Aten (Minerva) ensinou-lhe a arte da tecelagem, Afrodite (Vnus) deu-lha a beleza e o desejo indomvel, Hermes (Mercrio) encheu-lhe o cora??o de artimanhas, imprudncia, ardis, fingimento e cinismo, as Gra?as embelezaram-na com lindssimos colares de ouro... Zeus enviou Pandora como presente a Epimeteu, o qual, esquecendo-se da recomenda??o de Prometeu, seu irm?o, de que nunca recebesse um presente de Zeus, o aceitou. Quando Pandora, por curiosidade, abriu uma caixa que trouxera do Olimpo como presente de casamento ao marido, dela fugiram todas as calamidades e desgra?as que at hoje atormentam os homens. Pandora ainda tentou fechar a caixa, mas era tarde demais: ela estava vazia, com a exce??o da "esperan?a" que permaneceu presa junto  borda da caixa....perdendo a esperan?a, depois foi morta.  Pandora  a deusa da ressurrei??o. Ela por n?o nascer como a divindade  conhecida como uma semi-deusa. Pandora era uma humana ligada a Hades. Sua ambi??o em se tornar a deusa do Olimpo e esposa de Zeus fez com que ela abrisse a anfora divina. Zeus para castiga-la tirou a sua vida. Hades com interesse nas ambi??es de Pandora, procurou as pacas (dominadoras do tempo) e pediu para que o tempo voltasse, sem permiss?o de Zeus elas n?o puderam fazer nada. Hades convenceu o irm?o a ressuscitar Pandora, devido os argumentos do irm?o Zeus a ressuscitou dando a divindade que ela sempre desejava. Assim Pandora se tornou a deusa da ressurrei??o. Para um esprito ressuscitar Pandora entrega-lhe uma tarefa, se o esprito cumprir ele  ressuscitado.

Que nunca souberam quem era seu pai, que sua m?e Maria foi estrupada por mais de 30 soldados romanos quando ela tinha apenas 11 anos e foi obrigada a casar com Jos de 46 anos somente para n?o morrer apedrejada? Que Maria nunca dormiu com Jos e sim com 2 sacerdotes do templo, e por isso que vivia sempre l no templo, ate Jesus vivia no Templo. Disseram que Maria ficou gravida do espirito para que nao vivesse rejeitado pois nao sabia quais dos 30 soldados era o pai. Uma vez Jesus fez passarinhos de barro, Maria recolheu tudo e colocou um monte de semente no lugar. No outro dia o mesmo lugar estava cheio de passaros e o bobo menino jesus pensou que os passarinhos de barro transformaram em passaros de verdade.   Assim jesus disse que tinha espitrito e tinha poder de transformar barro em vida. Pegou uma pedra e matou seu melhor amigo com varias pedradas na cabe?a.  Tirou o cerebro do coleguinha e consertou com barro, e queria que revivesse. Como n?o reviveu, jesus matou mais 2 garotos e fez a mesma coisa. Assim ele descobriu que n?o tinha poderes. Por isso a Biblia n?o diz o que ele fez dos 13 aos 30 anos. Outros dizem que um cardeal conseguiu apagar essa parte.  Depois jesus colocou amoras na mao e espremeu dentro de uma cuia de agua para dizer que havia transformado em vinho. Tambem andou em cima de peda?os de gelo, para dizer que andava sobre a agua. E muitas outras farsas, ate a crucucifacao foi uma farsa. Depois, ele se curou dos ferimentos, casou com Maria madalena, uma prostituta de quem ele era cafetao e teve 2 filhos homens. Os seus descendentes existem ate hoje. Mas ele havia mudado seu nome e eles, o verdadeiro sangue do seu sangue nem sabem disso.  Os apostolos eram apenas 7 homens e 14 mulheres. Resumindo, nunca foi 12 homens, o resto, foi inventado 100 anos depois pelos cristaos. Nenhum dos apostolos sabia ler ou escrever. Entao todos os evangelhos (at os apocrifos) s?o todos falsamente atribuidos aos discipulos.

Como devo tratar uma jovem que se interessa por mim?    Susan deu o primeiro passo, e isso n?o foi nenhum problema para mim. No meu caso deu certo. ?James.    Se um homem n?o for honesto ao lidar com as mulheres, os resultados poder?o ser desastrosos. ?Roberto.    UMA jovem disse recentemente que queria perguntar-lhe algo. Vocs geralmente se vem em grupos de amigos, e  divertido conversar com ela e fazer coisas juntos. Mas o que ela disse o deixou perplexo. Ela tem interesse romantico por voc e quer saber se voc corresponde.    Talvez isso o deixe surpreso, se na sua opini?o  o homem quem deve pedir a mulher em namoro. Embora geralmente seja assim, lembre-se de que ela n?o est violando nenhum princpio bblico por dar o primeiro passo. Esse fato talvez o ajude a reagir da maneira correta.    Depois de pensar no assunto, voc talvez chegue  conclus?o de que  muito novo para namorar ou que no momento n?o se sente atrado a essa jovem. Pode ser tambm que se sinta culpado, imaginando se de algum modo deu a ela uma impress?o errada. O que fazer? Primeiro, deve levar em conta os sentimentos dela.    Tenha considera??o pelos sentimentos dela    Pense no que se passa com uma jovem nessa situa??o. Ansiosa para causar uma boa impress?o, ela talvez tenha ensaiado por dias o que ia dizer a voc. Depois de combinar as palavras certas com o sorriso certo, ela sofreu ao pensar na possibilidade de voc dizer n?o. Finalmente criou coragem, venceu o nervosismo e disse a voc o que tinha no cora??o.    Por que ela se colocou nessa situa??o desafiadora? Talvez tenha uma paix?o passageira por voc. Ou talvez admire excelentes qualidades suas de um modo que poucas pessoas fazem. Assim, as palavras dela provavelmente foram um tipo de elogio que voc n?o recebe todos os dias.    Esses pontos foram includos aqui, n?o para influenciar sua decis?o, mas para lembr-lo de ser gentil. Uma jovem chamada Julie diz: Mesmo que n?o sinta nada por ela, o homem deve sentir-se lisonjeado de que algum reparou nele. Por isso, em vez de simplesmente dizer n?o, ele deve pelo menos ser agradvel e dizer a ela com jeito que n?o est interessado. Vamos supor no momento que voc pretende fazer exatamente isso ?achar uma maneira bondosa de dizer n?o.    E se no passado voc a rejeitou? Agora talvez se sinta tentado a responder de modo grosseiro. Resista a essa tenta??o. Provrbios 12:18 diz: Existe aquele que fala irrefletidamente como que com as estocadas duma espada, mas a lngua dos sbios  uma cura. Como voc fala com a lngua dos sbios?    Voc pode simplesmente agradec-la por ter expressado seus sentimentos e por ter voc em t?o alta estima. Pe?a desculpas por ter dado uma impress?o errada, mesmo que tenha sido sem querer. Diga de modo claro, porm bondoso, que n?o corresponde aos sentimentos dela. Se ela n?o entender sua resposta e voc tiver de falar de modo mais firme, ainda assim deve evitar um tom de voz rspido e palavras duras. Voc est lidando com os sentimentos delicados dela; por isso, seja paciente. Se voc estivesse no lugar dela, n?o gostaria que ela o tratasse de modo gentil?    No entanto, talvez ela insista que voc a iludiu de propsito. Pode ser que ela mencione certas a??es de sua parte que mexeram com os sentimentos dela. Lembra-se de quando voc me deu aquela flor?, ela talvez diga. Ou: E aquilo que me disse enquanto caminhvamos juntos no ms passado? Agora  hora de voc fazer uma auto-anlise sincera.    Encare a realidade    No passado, os exploradores muitas vezes consideravam as terras que descobriam como objetos de conquista e explora??o, e  assim que alguns homens consideram as mulheres hoje em dia. Gostam de relacionamentos romanticos, mas n?o querem ter a responsabilidade do casamento. Sem se comprometerem, eles tentam conquistar as mulheres brincando com os sentimentos delas. Um homem que age assim ganha a afei??o da mulher iludindo-a. Um anci?o crist?o diz: Alguns rapazes v?o de uma jovem para outra. N?o  justo brincar assim com as emo??es de uma mulher. Em que resulta esse egosmo?    Igual a um louco que atira projteis ardentes, flechas e morte, assim  o homem que logrou seu prximo e que disse: N?o me diverti? (Provrbios 26:18, 19) Quando um homem se envolve com uma mulher por motivos egostas, ela por fim perceber a verdadeira motiva??o dele. Ent?o, o fato de ter sido enganada pode machuc-la profundamente, como mostra o caso a seguir.    Certo jovem se envolveu num relacionamento romantico, mas n?o tinha inten??o de se casar com a jovem. Ele a levava a restaurantes finos e a festas. Ele gostava da companhia dela, e ela gostava da aten??o dele e achava que ele a estava conhecendo com o interesse de se casar com ela. Quando descobriu que o interesse dele era simplesmente social, ela ficou muito magoada.    O que fazer se, mesmo sem querer, voc tiver dado uma impress?o errada  jovem que acabou de falar com voc? Ficar na defensiva e tentar se justificar s vai faz-la sentir-se amargurada. Considere este princpio bblico: Quem encobre as suas transgress?es n?o ser bem sucedido, mas, ter-se- misericrdia com aquele que as confessa e abandona. (Provrbios 28:13) Por isso, seja sincero e reconhe?a sua parcela de responsabilidade em qualquer mal-entendido. E se voc intencionalmente brincou com os sentimentos dela, reconhe?a que cometeu um erro srio. Pe?a desculpas sinceras.    N?o espere, porm, que seu pedido de desculpas seja o fim do assunto. Talvez a jovem fique com raiva de voc por algum tempo. Pode ser que voc tenha de explicar seu comportamento aos pais dela. Alm disso, poder enfrentar outras conseqncias.

HORe9vDtaa	O principal interesse dos Portugueses no Brasil eram ouro e especiarias (produtos mais valorizados no mercado internaconal na poca). Entretanto, assim que chegaram ao brasil, pelo menos no primeiro momento, n?o encontraram nas terras metais preciosos nem especiarias.    A nica coisa que chamou a aten?a? dos portugueses foi o pau-brasil, rvore valorizada por sua caracterstica corante utilizada para tingir tecidos, anteriormente importado do oriente a elevados pre?os.    Como Portugal, apesar do pau-brasil, pemanecia muito mais interessado no comrcio com as ndias, e n?o tinha uma m?o-de-obra suficiente para controlar o comrcio com as ndias ao mesmo tempo que a extrata??o do pau-brasil, adotaram o sistema de feitorias.    As feitorias eram entrempostos comerciais instalados ao longo do litoral brasileiro. Os ndios exntravam na mata, abatiam, cortavam e levavam o pau-brasil at o interior dessas feitorias. Ao longo do ano, embarca??es portuguesas com destino as ndias, aportavam na costa brasileira, carregavam o interiori dos navios com as toras de pau-brasil e deixavam em seu lugar artigos manufaturados para os ndios. Essa troca direta de mercadorias recebe o nome de escambo.    At 1930 a economia de Portugal permaneceu nesse cenrio. Em 1930, contudo, o pre?o das especiarias da ndia desabaram, tornando as viagens muito caras e pouco lucrativas.    Portugal ent?o, decide, de fato, colonizar o brasil para faz-lo gerar lucros.    A primeira medida foi a implanta??o da cana-de-a?car. Os portugueses j tinham esperincia no plantio e produ??o do a?car de suas ilhas colonizadas no Atlantico e das terras do norte da frica.    A cana-de-a?car adaptou-se bem ao solo e ao clima, e logo todo o litoral brasileiro, em especial no Nordeste, estava tomado pelos Engenhos (fazendas de planta??o e produ??o de a?car).    O Engenho era completamente dependente de m?o-de-obra para funcionar. Foi apartir de ent?o que o incio do trfico de escravos come?ou no brasil a fim de dar suporte a economia a?ucareira.    A produ??o de a?car gerou muitos lucros para os Senhores de Engenho e principalmente para a Coroa portuguesa.    Os holandeses tambm tiveram muito lucro com o a?car brasileiro, uma vez que a cana aqui plantada era transportada para as refinarias holandesas para ser processada antes de poder ser consumida.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Cana de a?car.|`|UhLcdxzeaa	A base da economia colonial era o engenho de a?car. O senhor de engenho era um fazendeiro proprietrio da unidade de produ??o de a?car. Utilizava a m?o-de-obra africana escrava e tinha como objetivo principal a venda do a?car para o mercado europeu. Alm do a?car destacou-se tambm a produ??o de tabaco e algod?o.  As planta??es ocorriam no sistema de plantation, ou seja, eram grandes fazendas produtoras de um nico produto, utilizando m?o-de-obra escrava e visando o comrcio exterior.  O Pacto Colonial imposto por Portugal estabelecia que o Brasil (Col?nia) s podia fazer comrcio com a Metrpole, n?o devendo concorrer com produtos produzidos l.  A sociedade no perodo do a?car era marcada pela grande diferencia??o social. No topo da sociedade, com poderes polticos e econ?micos, estavam os senhores de engenho. Abaixo, aparecia uma camada mdia formada por pessoas livres (feitores, capatazes, padres, militares, comerciantes e artes?os) e funcionrios pblicos. E na base da sociedade estavam os escravos, de origem africana, tratados como simples mercadorias e responsveis por quase todo trabalho desenvolvido na col?nia.  Era uma sociedade patriarcal, pois o senhor de engenho exercia um grande poder social. As mulheres tinham poucos poderes e nenhuma participa??o poltica, deviam apenas cuidar do lar e dos filhos.  A casa-grande era a residncia da famlia do senhor de engenho. Nela moravam, alm da famlia, alguns agregados. O conforto da casa-grande contrastava com a misria e pssimas condi??es de higiene das senzalas (habita??es dos escravos).|`|40UeBBUTaa	pau brasil Esta  a rvore da qual foi derivado o nome do pas.

A minha ficha caiu que l n?o passa de um comrcio para quem trabalha l... As pessoas que frequentam na verdade, est?o l porque necessitam de estar na presen?a de Deus e em ora??o. Quando um pastor veio de SP e ele levava multid?es aos cultos.. Ele era mesmo muito aben?oado! Mas apesar de tanta gente, os valores q ele arrecadava n?o satisfazia os grand?es de la..Porq ele pregava e dizia q se o nosso cora??o fosse tocado a fazer algum tipo de doa??o a casa de Deus q o fizessemos. Mas s se fosse de cora??o! Eles correram com ele de l.. Os outros, s?o instruidos a leiloar a f das pessoas que al est?o..  um absurdo! Eles chamam as pessoas com envelopes coloridos, onde cada um representa um valor a ser doado. Eles chamam de voto a Deus. Vc n?o tem o $ mais vai arrumar custe o q custar porq vc se comprometeu com Deus.. Eles encenam...dizem assim:  Eu quero ver quem tem a f suficiente para pegar o envelope de 50,00, quem tem mais f .. o de 70,00 ,o de 100,00.. 150,00 e enquanto aparece gente q vai l e pega.. o leil?o continua...  Eu fiquei indignada d ver essas cenas, de v-los dizendo as pessoas que tirem todo o $ que vc possui, se for o unico para comprar o leite do seu filho, se for o da sua passagem de onibus.. vc tem que ter f...Deus est olhando sua atitude.. bla bla bla  Hoje fa?o parte de outra congrega??o e sou muito feliz l.. Vejo as pessoas se ajudando, os louvores e as prega?oes s?o abeno?ados!  Mas religi?o  assim.. cada um escolhe a que lhe convm!  E independente da congrega??o ou religi?o... Somos todos irm?os! E quem tem preconceito, olha torto para quem quer q seja.. n?o  digno de estar na presen?a de Deus!!  Eu creio que um dia, esse comercio acaba!As pessoas que l frequentam , s?o vitimas dessa gente inescrupulosa.

Sendo assim, n?o havia um "antes da Cria??o"!  como se fosse o nada absoluto antes! Tudo come?a, inclusive o tempo, a partir da Cria??o! Pode-se dizer que Deus nunca surgiu, sempre existiu, infinitamente ao passado, mas apenas num nico instante... O infinito temporal contido em um nico instante, nulo!  complicado tentar entender isso e impossvel de se compreender na totalidade porque estamos padronizados ao tempo... N?o tivemos nenhum exemplo de algo atemporal, por isso nosso crebro n?o consegue conceber isso!    E Deus n?o foi escolhido por ningum... Se admitirmos que algum  Deus, Ele n?o pode ter um Criador...

4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	You sound intelligent for a 12-year-old.  I mean, it's impressive that you're reading Poe at that age.  Most kids your age wouldn't even know who he is.  I'm a 21-year-old goth and I don't have a problem with those younger than me considering themselves goth as long as they know what they're talking about.  Now if a 12-year-old got on here and was talking about Twilight and how they're so goth because they love vampires or something like that then I would think they're an idiot.  But to see someone young who appears to have some knowledge about things, I have no problem with that.  As far as being Wiccan at your age, I don't see a problem with that either.  I was exploring various beliefs when I was like 11 or 12, including Wicca.

A simple Google search will turn it up.  So I am not sure what is "wrong" about finding it.  Believing that it is real is another issue, since it is a drawing, and not a photograph.  If you were to believe it based on the picture, I might be tempted to speculate that there was something "wrong" with you.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	I think people are missing the whole point about that picture..    He's cuddling a creature.  To me, it says that Jesus loves everyone and everything that ever existed in this world at one time or another.

AA11008046	There isn't any one book that is considered the "gospel of forgiveness"  However, let me give you some passages that speak to forgiveness:  Matt 5:44,45  Matt 11: 25,26  Romans 12:20  Luke 6:35-38  Proverbs 20:22  There are many more but these will get you started.  God bless your studies.|`|KmULmT7Baa	I'm an atheist so this is not my strong suit. I have only read Revalations.|`|2LAKDPc7aa	Matt, Mark, Luke, John.|`|XpZumlkwaa	Right now, I like Forgive us our debts, as we forgive us our debtors.  Obama can ask that the House make some more money on that money machine up there to pay everybodys debt off, only in the America, and we could all start fresh.  When it comes to giving themselves money, Its just money, but let be for the real people, then its thats too much money!  Those GREEDY Bastards!|`|AA11849917	In all four gospels, there is ongoing instructions to forgive you enemies, forgive those who harm you, "forgive us as we forgive others", etc, etc.  It's one of the most basic concepts of the Gospel - God forgives us, and we are to forgive others.|`|k03dYskYaa	Gospel means good news,     Gods forgiveness is not extended toward those who refuse to forgive others. "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;?whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."  However, Christians are not required to forgive those who practice malicious, willful sin with no repentance. Such become Gods enemies.Heb 10:26-31; Ps 139:21,?22.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Forgiveness is in all of the gospels. In fact forgiveness is throughout the entire bible.|`|AA11220299	There are only 4 gospels. Each has its own slant but they are all about God's forgiveness of mankind.     Matthew presents Jesus as the King and so He has the authority to forgive us.    Mark presents Jesus as the servant and so he has the means to forgive us.    Luke presents Jesus as the son of man so He has the understanding to forgive us.    John presents Jesus as the Son of God, so He has the power to forgive us.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	all of them are about forgiveness

It seems you really like this girl, good luck     x    p.s. both are really good choices!

Therefore, discipleship should take precedence over everything we do.

Our church is 2000 members strong and its main growth is attributed to small groups of about 5-8 once the group gets too big they train up a leader and split the group in half. once the church gets really big they try to send out familys to grow more churches. I am not a methodist I was just using the denomination to show how small groups can cause a movement.

There are bad people that come from every race and religion.  It is incredibly dangerous to start pointing fingers at large groups... this is how genocides start.  Just as you wouldn't want someone to question what you are at large, it's unfair and unethical to do this to any other group.  There are non-Muslim people who fund terrorism and who support extremist ideas and fundamentalism.  The point is, that in this day in age, you can be suspicious of anyone and that's your right, but give people a chance, especially in the way you talk about large groups of people to others... what you say has a large effect on what others think.

Give him a break and see what comes in the future with both of you.|`|KcHhLsCAaa	Ask him to hang out with you and then tell him you like him "more" than a friend.  His response will tell you what you want to know.|`|j5y1pONfaa	Sometimes just because a guy acts gay doesn't necessarily mean he is. I have a guy friend who is very feminine and I thought he was gay too. Come to find out he definitely IS NOT gay. He just happens to be a little girly sometimes. For the longest time though, I teased him that he was gay.    Remember just because "walks like a duck, talks like duck" doesn't always necessarily mean it is a duck!|`|C2h2f4cdaa	Be careful. Even if the guy is gay he may be in denial. He may become aggressive and violent as a way of defending himself and his 'masculinity'.    I recommend that you develop your friendship with him first. Once you get to know him a bit better, you will find out more about his sexuality and inclinations.    Best wishes

Find a picture of the two of you to keep in her room, put it in a cheap black frame and write something sweet on the frame with a gold or silver pen.  That is inexpensive but will mean a lot.  Write her a poem, sing her a song that captures the way you feel about her or is special to her.  Slow dance with her for no reason, even if no one else is dancing, hold her hand, open the car door, hold the hotel doors or room door if applicable.  Just treat her like a lady.  She will notice those things and be happy that she wants to do things for you, I'm sure once you get a job again, you will repay the favor.  Have a great V-Day!|`|hRE3wcDyaa	well, ill say just enjoy what she has to offer to you. guys dont have to spend money on their gurl all the time. its the love that matters.   and dont bring up the idea of being broke, because it will just ruin everything and make her feel bad about spending money on you.  just tell her you appreciate all her effort and enjoy your day together!|`|DlMOcK4caa	Considering the money issue, you could do everything you can to help HER enjoy the hotel room she got for you two. :)  you know, give her a foot massage or back rub. I don't know what she likes, but show her that you're all about her. whether it's dim lighting and foot massages, or eating doritoes and watching an old gore flick. Just make the evening easy on her. Since she put out expenses for the physical place, you can make the environment more romantic through your behavior and efforts :)  I wish you success :)|`|Mw3jiTlpaa	crown is right, but she forgot to mention a few things. you should at least have money to buy her a single rose, then hang out all day and make sure it's just the two of you, then take her to watch the sunset and during the sunset, let your eyes meet and kiss.    But, I'm 13, and I don't know much about love but that what i just said would be very romantic.  Take my advise and use it.
lkxFy681aa	You don't EAT when you fast.    Water is not a food.|`|KOecCLjLaa	I don't like to drink anything when I fast.  If I drink water while fasting I become hungry, but if I don't I am rarely hungry.  To me, as a guy (it may be different for women since they cycle), drinking drives hunger.  I also believe that a lot of the water fad is driven by bottled water and utility companies (bottled water is a huge industry)|`|AA11058044	You should never drink water at any time.  Do you have any idea what fish do in there?    For a proper fast, you should only drink Jamieson's neat between the hours of 6 am and 5am.

AA11724685	It's not just about the girl...a day to show your sweetheart that you're glad they are in your life. Honestly, you can really do that any and every day of the year, so it's really not as huge a deal as some girls make it out to be. Go to dinner the day before or mail him a card so that it will arrive to him on VDay. As long as you both know you care about the other, that's what it's all about.

OugNf0x6aa	"God" is a figment of our imaginations to explain things we don't know, or claim something completely ridiculously impossible as a "miracle".|`|6bC1HnyHaa	Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-  Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists).  Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens  and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His  Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what  will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His  Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kurs? [1] extends over the heavens and the  earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most  High, the Most Great. [This Verse 2:255 is called Ayat-ul-Kurs? ]|`|rlgb5pRGaa	Hello!    God is the creator of the universe.  He's a person.  The Bible defines Him in three words:  "God is love."    He loves his creation enough to give us the free will to choose to love Him back or not and go our own way.  Unfortunately, many choose to live apart from God.  The result:  evil and sin (like your example, the Holocaust).      But, still, God keeps calling us back -- gently and lovingly -- to rejoin Him and live in love, joy and peace.    Hope that helps!    For more Bible-y stuff, check out http://getupwithgod.com|`|LG1IkLUJaa	HE'S THE CREATOR OF US.|`|yKA70D41aa	God is Light. Only people with eyes can detect him.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	God calls himself "I AM".  God has the power of being within himself. Everything else is dependent on him for their existence.  God evens up all injustice on Judgment Day, on his own time schedule.|`|JBkB1ZLJaa	God is not someone, it is existence, life and energy.    Everything exist so God is everything and in everything.  Infinity exist so God is infinite.    Since God is infinite, it results in knowing everything for all things are his parts.  Love, peace, joy, illumination and good will exist so it's God too.  Hate, bad, envies and negativity is also God, because God is everything.    Now we have the power to think and choose, it is up to us to choose the good for it makes us radiate more of the same stuff. Consequently we live a full and happy life.  When we choose bad we harvest the fruits of negativity and we suffer.  God is the life principle within us and it doesn't care if we pick good or bad because it is the same for it.  The best way to deal with this concept of God is to always look toward the positivity for it is like going with the flow and the result is more interesting.  Being negative, on the other hand tend to destroy our attitude and discourages us to live.|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	I believe in the God of the Bible, the Creator of heaven and earth. God is perfect, holy, eternal, love. God loves us all and wants us to be with Him in heaven forever after we die. But, we aren't perfect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, as the bridge to God. Jesus came to earth to show us how to live and to be the sacrifice for our sins. Jesus took on all our sins at the cross when He died, even though He was sinless Himself. Now, when we accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior to be a Christian, we receive God's blessing and guidance, forgiveness and protection as well as go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God: I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out)  and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing. God bless.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	He IS Love!!

First time at the rodeo, eh? ...;-)  -|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Satan does evil and man does evil.  Blame man.     The truth is that Jesus is God, and He loves you so very much, that He died on the cross to pay for YOUR sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead!  You must simply believe this to be saved and be in heaven with Him!  :)   Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)
nXSpS3Axaa	What tao said... They blindly believe that the bible is true and hope it is.. Some people know that the bible seems skeptical, but force themselves to believe it for the sake of there religion.. Willfully ignorant..    There's nothing wrong with faith (outside of religion), but to believe in something that you know is false and hoping it's not, is wrong..|`|lkxFy681aa	We can't.|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	Pray,study and do research.  There are many books that claim to have the truth but do not. Be careful of books.  The Bible has been tested through out the ages. many people have tried to condemn it with proof. No one has evr been able to do that. We are continually finding more and more proof of the validity of the Bible.|`|JMOLRKRraa	It is child like faith, for such is the Kingdom of God.  I tell you true, the more I believe with child like faith, the more spiritual power I receive, and the more more spiritual truths and insights and revelations I receive.

Remember all power in heaven and earth has been given to Jesus by God, and Jesus gives all power in heaven and earth to those who believe on Him. And the things He did and greater will we do, because Jesus goes to His Father on our behalf.   I tell you true, the people that need enerything explained, and rationalized, ARE SO MISSING IT!!!  The true stories I could tell. The abilities and powers God so freely gives.

He was never born.  He does not have wife.  He does not have son.  There is nothing like him whatsoever  He created everything from the tiny electron to the huge galaxies.   He created humans to worship him & ONLY him.  He does not want or need any thing from humans except that worship voluntarily.  He has the power to make all humans worship him as the Angels do.|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	For something to get their poor, measly lives going every day. How else would they get out of bed and face the world? (sarcasm) It's just something for them to have faith about and believe in and "know deep down" that something good will happen if they believe and go by the Bible, etc.  There's no guarantee it's all real OR fake, but makes people not so scared.     But yet they are "fearing" the Lord (which the actual "Lord" could still be made up, from the Bible for all we know)... and they are scared if they do something wrong like "Oh goodness, I'm going to hell now!!!"  So yeah, its kind of ironic, but it's been passed down generations (one thing if you live with someone you will most likely inherit) and it makes people that believe in all that feel good.|`|0F8hauikaa	It's called having faith. Just like when you see a house. Did you have to see someone actually build it, or is the house itself evidence enough that someone did, someone you will never know or see. By evidence of the house, you have faith that someone created it without having to witness it in person. The Bible also has a lot of good advice regardless whether one is a believer or not, advice about the importance of things such as being clean, honest and loyal.  My faith doesn't really come from the Bible but rather from beauty and perfection in nature. It's hard for me to believe that flawless design was an accident.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Blind faith/Willful ignorance.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	They can't.  They CHOOSE to believe it.

About 40 men wrote as they were inspired by God.|`|v7Wflu78aa	We each set our standard for determining what is true and what isn't.    People who believe the bible is literally true have low or warped standards for determining what is true.    "If I ask the next person I see what college to go to, and that person is wearing green, then I will follow whatever advice that person has."  That's a low standard of truth.|`|luwBPdE8aa	The Bible is the most reliable book of ancient history in existence.  Archaeology has proved many things in the Bible.

Mb5YUZMwaa	"Dichotomy" won't suffice for the reason that: "Dichotomy" is any splitting of a whole into exactly two non-overlapping parts. Which would mean Batman & The Joker were split from one source although they maybe enemies. Compared to "Dichotomy", I would rather go with "Binary Opposition"    You could also try "antithetical" opposition between.....    Hope it helps.....Ciao|`|AA10067344	Scratch "binary opposition" and go with "dichotomy"|`|sbKWMMv9aa	That's incorrect usage.    Binary and opposition don't go well together.  "Binary" indicates dualism, like having two of something.  That doesn't go with the word opposition because it sounds like you have something that is self opposing.      Perhaps you can say "mutual opposition".
AA10339450	The Bible doesn't say that people sent to hell do not get a chance to be saved.  In fact, Jesus after he was crucified went to the after-life and preached there.  This would indicate that one could still be saved.      The only people expressly said to remain in the fiery pit of burning sulfur are Satan, the Antichrist and the false prophet and those who receive the mark of the Beast.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I'm sorry to break this to you but you just aren't bright. Really.   There is a loving God and there is a Hell The same One who died on the Cross to give us back our lost inheritance is also He who can say :  And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.     Read about Jesus weeping over Jerusalem.     4 Indeed, before you the whole universe is as a grain from a balance, or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth.   23   But you have mercy on all, because you can do all things; and you overlook the sins of men that they may repent.   24   For you love all things that are and loathe nothing that you have made; for what you hated, you would not have fashioned.   25   And how could a thing remain, unless you willed it; or be preserved, had it not been called forth by you?     You simply cannot see and then you cannot conceive that both are true.|`|zfZiXQ3Oaa	Could you torture your worst enemy forever?   Not forever... I'd get bored after a while.    How about your own family?   See above.    Is torturing people evil?  Perhaps, but fun too.     Is God evil? ?  God doesnt exist.    Has religion lied about God?  Yep.|`|A8kFFduNaa	Um, you may want to narrow down your question.|`|VmGcNErkaa	I would torture my worst enemy over and over if its all I ever did.. Damn, this is heaven..|`|ulwXFrrJaa	yes.      fortunately more and more people are seeing through this logical fallacy every day.  how in the world could every person in the world be more compassionate than God?      they couldn't.  Religion has lied again and peddled eternal damnation on the demographic most susceptible to fear.|`|pakIAYWoaa	if you have a friend at a party and he wants to drink tequila shooters one after another and you tell him not a good idea there are consequences but he starts with a few and you say hey  you are going to get sick if you keep it up and he has a few more and you try to cut him off but he becomes belligerent and curses you for messing with his fun and assures you he is cool ; he has in fact taken responsibility for his own consequences when they fall on him.  God has been saying to man i will receive any and all who come to me; i love and forgive you of all; if you turn from your ways i will receive you if not these are the consequences; how is that Gods fault? Who are you to equate what is fair just and Right and then try to hold the Lord accountable to your standard? Look at the universe the creation of God nature is beautiful wonderful the marvel of life is delightful.  this is my God who in infinite wisdom made the foundations of matter gave them form and order and created abundant life.  God is righteous; there is mercy for you if you choose to accept it; the creation is a marvel consider God verses chance...|`|73n1SExgaa	Are you tha creator of this world???|`|472e38086de52f52e7089f1f29ef15ddaa	God of scriptures is in there..but mostly people only see the lies men told about him.

No, I don't have it in me.    How about your own family?  Again, no.    Is torturing people evil?  Yes, it is.    Is God evil?  It depends on what "god" is your god.    Has religion lied about God?  Again, it depends on what religion and god you are referring too.|`|tYCZcn7uaa	"Forever" (aeon) doesn't literally mean forever. No one is tormented forever. If aeon meant forever, then why is there a plural version? Forevers? Ridiculous. Aeons and aeons means for a very long time, but not forever.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	Religion has in fact lied about God. Jehovah (Psalm 83:18) is described as being just, loving, compassionate and kind, so that would not merit the "teaching" that there is a hell. In fact, hell is a false teaching that was used to get more people into the churches of false religion. If one did an in-depth study of the Bible, they would find that "hell" actually means "grave" or "pit" when translated from the original Greek and Hebrew renderings. Besides, if God is loving, why would he torture his creatures for eternity? Don't be fooled by false religions; follow the scriptures instead in order to find the truth.|`|d62e178b99999cb7342212115b30d5bfaa	Religion has not lied about God, people have misinterpreted His words and put it into religion.    I would never torture my worst enemy. Neither God would. God gives us all another chance through reincarnation. There is no eternal torture. God doesn't punish us either. All the afflictions and hardships in life were attracted to us by our own mind and actions. God is just the Supreme Intelligence that observes our own development, He sees us tumbling, falling and succeeding. He can help us, when we ask for help, but He doesn't intervene on whatever is necessary for our own growth. Therefore, He can give us strength to climb the Mountain, but He doesn't take the mountain out of the way, if the mountain is what we need to build up our muscles and if we need to get to the place in the other side of the mountain.    We make our path. God allows us to do that. We bring the consequences to our path. God allows us to do that too.    Peace!|`|n0pt3w5Laa	if my worst enemy were a human, then yes. my family would torture me before i got around to them. yes torturing people can be evil but evil is too broad of a word. god is not real.|`|SrUzS8guaa	You cannot torture your worst enemy forever because God will punish you back. Also, when you die, God will probably send you to hell, where you will no longer torture your enemy. The same goes with torturing your family.     Yes, torturing is wrong and evil. God is not evil, He is a Judge. God punishes a person on Earth out of love in order to correct your thinking and behavior. Once you learn your lesson and overcome obstacles, you will see He was trying to help you out after all. I think many people think God is evil because He is allowing the world to have crime, violence, wars, famine, poverty, and diseases. God is punishing the world because our modern way of life is not right in the His eyes. Until we start thinking and behaving right, then we will see God's "punishment" was for the good.|`|XPnIjCoEaa	this is a rather deep question that im sure has crossed the minds of many.  but the answer depends on what religion you believe in.  i am a Muslim, so my answers are going to be in the favor of God.  torture is never a nice idea, and forever is a long time. revenge only makes you equal the person who caused you harm. forgiving and forgetting is hard but it will make you a better person in the eyes of God.   family? would you really hurt the woman who gave birth to you? as for brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. they are still your blood, and hurting any other human will not solve anything.  listen to your question: is torturing people evil? i believe you can answer that yourself. is burning someone to deah "nice"? does shooting someone show how good of a person you are?  and is God evil? How can someone who has made you and every single thing around you be evil? Look up at the clouds. could you ever make something so magnificent?  Once again, these are my personaly beliefs. Religion is a personal subject and you must find these answers in yourself and find your own answers to these questions. No one can force you to believe in something.|`|sGojEWOxaa	No I couldn't, No, yes and NO.  God is just, His ways are far above our ways.  God shows mercy to people over and over again.  We are not capable of putting up with all that he tolerates from people, He continues to show people love and compassion, and yet they spit in His face and walk away.  He is not willing that any should perish, but He has given us free will  to do what we want, He will never force anyone to serve Him.    2 Peter 3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.    Hell was originally created for the devil and his angels, but the bible says that the wicked will go there also.  Psalm 9:17  The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.  Isaiah 5:14  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.    2 Peter 2:3-5 (King James Version)     3And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.      4For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;      5And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;    "Religion" may lie about God, but His Word never lies!  Hell is real, and I do not want to go there, I do not want to find out what it is really like.

T4QxQNUbaa	When I first realized I was gay I felt very guilty.  I thought something must be wrong with me and tried very hard to set myself back into a heterosexual lifestyle throughout junior high and high school.  It never took and when I finally relented to my urges and dated a guy I had met I loved it, and have never looked back.  It took about 10 years but I am completely comfortable with myself and love who I am.|`|HAHDipTAaa	Being gay is just another fellow feeling|`|T1kJUotZaa	let me put it in simple terms: the celestial year of which the sun churns unicornally compares not to thy love of adams and the moon's that shall hang by thys hips.

Actually, for me, dating a girl is like having sex with your best friend. We go to the spa and go shopping and hang out and stuff, and do the couple thing(holding hands, smooching and all that) at the same time.     No, I have never felt guilt about being with another woman. I love who I love, and I am comfortable with myself enough to not care what other people think. Those that do feel guilty about their choices probably have some deep underlying issues.|`|EoF8agF0aa	i've only felt guilt once for being gay and that was when my little sister came home crying because people made fun of her because of her lesbian sister (me obviously). that was devistating. one reason i am 17 and living on my own in the city. that small town stupidity and closemindedness was too much for me. but besides that i've never felt guilty. infact it is the most wonderful feeling in the world. having the ability and chance to be myself and not try to hide who i am or be someone else. its absolutely glorious and amazing. i feel free. free of my shell. free of myself to be myself. if that even makes sense :)

So consider the kids...please!!!  I look Native but can tell I'm not full-blood although I've been asked that so I hang with the Natives mostly but do have white friends but find out I am actually on the "Red Road" which makes my white mom angry!!

In the interest of life being precious, more people are dying via abortion that the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That might have a lot to do with why this radio station is prioritizing abortion over war.    It also might simply be a matter of the radio station programers decision to focus on national politics rather than international politics.      >    Given the election of Obama, and his intent to reverse Bush's pro-life policies, abortion is a more timely issue than war for now.      >    Self-defense is the only justifiable reason to engage in armed conflict.      >    Abortion is so rampant because so many people are morally mislead.

Same reason that they do not talk about remarriage when the ex-spouse is alive being adultery.  There are too many so called Christians that think remarriage is OK.   Mark 10:11 "And he saith unto them, Whosoever (Same whosoever in John 3:16) shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her" V11 " And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."    They do not have a problem talking about gay marriages at least for now.  Maybe that too could eventually affect the $$$$ coming in.  They have to be careful what sins they talk about.    The Churches have the same problem.  They do not want to preach on the remarriage/adultery issue. It is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Because christians believe in war.

xWi4ua0Iaa	I don't think that abortion should be used as a manner of social engineering...maybe you don't realize it, but that's what you are proposing...besides, the vast majority of even abortion-opponents do not agree that abortion is "un-necessary" - they will almost always agree that abortion should be legal in cases of the mother's life being endangered, and even in cases where rape produces a pregnancy.  Their issues are usually couched in the idea that an individual should not be able to have an abortion "on demand" - because they think that encourages a society to give less meaning to the culture of life (sorry, the "it's a human life" argument is contradictory - so too then is the fetus in the womb of a mother who's life is endangered; so to is the fetus inside a rape victim, even if it's your daughter)...I don't think this argument is born out, as it is usually the same people on the Pro-Choice side of the abortion argument that are also against the culture that produces and sustains military aggression.  Conversely, it is often the opponents of abortion who find nothing wrong with killing a live, breathing baby thousands of miles away if it keeps them safer.    Welcome to America....|`|2RzEaod9aa	Because abortion shouldn't be used for population control. You make it seem as if the only two options are to have the kid or abort the kid. How about not getting pregnant in the first place? The reason we have overpopulation in the first place isn't because people don't get abortions, but because people don't use contraception and continue to have sex despite knowing full well the consequences.    As for drinkable water and jobs, that's a rather flimsy argument. Much of the world's population lives in an area where living is their job (farming, raising animals, etc.), and we can certainly always come up with ways to make things like seawater drinkable.|`|DArAz67Caa	we cannot sink to China's level----Human life is PRICELESS----water and other basic resources are not--|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Murdering babies is never necessary.

Don't you see, you've made an artificial cut-off point out of the arbitrary number of 6.5 billion.    At 6.5 billion, the human race is still increasing. Does this not suggest that there is sufficient resources for everyone? I think it does.      >    That's nice rhetoric but it doesn't really mean anything.    It's a matter of opinion whether or not the world is, objectively speaking, "over-populated". History has proven that slavery has existed LONG BEFORE world-overpopulation has.    With that in mind, does slavery have anything at all do to with over-population, alleged over-population?      >    Given the fact that the population continues to increase, doesn't that seem to suggest sufficient jobs and water?|`|hjxsX4liaa	Exactly  : )    There should be a one child per person law in every country.

NOTHING should take it away... before it even begins is definitely included! God knew us before we were even born. He knew us from the moment we were conceived, and even before.

I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well." Isaiah 44:2 "Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from thy womb..."

"When a woman gets an abortion, for the most part it is not changing the total number of children she has; rather, it is shifting the timing so those births come later in life. This is an important fact to remember. One in four pregnancies ends in abortion and this has been true for 30 years in the U.S. But the impact of abortion on the overall birth rate has been quite small."  http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/20...|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Think ostrich.

Humans do not get their morals from the bible.  If they do then their moral behaviour stems solely from the fear of god's punishment - implying that without god they would be unable to control their immorality.  This makes such people little more than immoral cowards.    Thinking humans act in a moral manner because they have learnt correct and appropriate behaviour in society.

New flash, if someone is a TRUE Christian, they wont attack you, so don't feel the need to attack us! Just as you stand firm in your disbelief, we are just as much allowed to stand firm in out BELIEF! And besides, almost ALL of you know that when you die and you go to heaven you're going to be clinging to the leg of saint peter begging him to let you in, crying like babies wishing you believed, but it'll be too late by then!

If you're trying to regulate your period, etc. try visiting a naturopath, or other holistic health care professional. He/she can help you adjust your diet, find exercises, etc. that will do wonders with that and don't generally mean too drastic a change in your lifestyle.

Nowadays Christian couples can decide to use birth control... because it is NOT killing a fetus... only simply preventing a fetus from forming which is not the same thing as killing one.    There's NO bible law against it... so there's nothing wrong with it.  Many women don't have the ability to bear children... so them having sex would be "wrong" if this were true.  God made sex for 2 reasons only.  1. procreation  2. enjoyment for married couples.    i hope this answers your question :)|`|qveHYKNmaa	If the woman was not sexually active, it could be ok. However, the health risks associated with the pill are great reasons not use the pill for any reason. ALSO, the conditions you mentioned are treatable through methods other than the pill.  Go to http://www.popepaulvi.com/ to find out.     Catholics do not use birth control for a number a reasons. We do not believe that sex should only be for procreation, we just believe that procreation is God's loving plan for marriage. But,  there are plenty of couples who cannot have children, but they should have sex.  Sex is holy when it is unitive. The marital act is very beautiful and encouraged! It strengthen a couples bond, as long as sex is an expression of love, not mere self satisfaction.  Condoms and other barriar methods of BC  should not be used because they come between  and disrupt the unitive nature of sex between husband and wife. Non barrier methods of BC, such as the pill, are forbidden because the pill does not prevent fertilization, but merely implantation. At the moment of conception (fertilization) the human baby embryo has its own DNA. Therefore the pill is not preventing pregnancy, but making survival of the embryo impossible. The baby is flushed out with menstruation and the mother never knows.   Another thing to remember that a Catholic wedding includes the promise to accept children as God sends them. In this promise we are acknowledging that God will do all the family planning, and we trust Him with that.  NOW! NFP is learning when a woman is fertile or not and should be used with prayer, for spacing (not limiting) children. And should only be used when there are serious reasons to space children.   I would like to add that there are studies out there that claim that the pill causes more cancer than smoking.  There is a lot to learn!http://www.lifesitenews.com/
LuN1unJ3aa	Convenience with respect to the general species.    "Though belonging to the order Carnivora, the Giant Panda has a diet which is 99% bamboo. The Giant Panda may eat other foods such as honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, and bananas when available."    Classification by order is for convenience' sake, more than anything else.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivore, the Giant Panda has a diet that is primarily herbivorous, which consists almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the Giant Panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore and does not have the ability to digest cellulose efficiently, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. The average Giant Panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 pounds) of bamboo shoots a day. Because the Giant Panda consumes a diet low in nutrition, it is important for it to keep its digestive tract full. The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. The Giant Panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain in order to limit its energy expenditures.    Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and its round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Panda researcher Russell Ciochon observed that: [m]uch like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allow the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo. Similarly, the Giant Panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.        Panda eating bambooTwenty-five species of bamboo are eaten by pandas in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala and Fargesia rufa. Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.    Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the Giant Panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the Giant Panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth, and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the Giant Panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	the Giant Panda is almost exclusively an herbivore but will take fish, eggs and insects.

It and other members of the Bear (Ursidae) family are generally Omnivores in that they can eat both vegetation and meat.    In Taxonomy, the Ursidae belong to the Order Carnivora; an historical term applied when it was believed that all the animals within the grouping were meat eaters.

But as David pointed out below, those of us who know our history know that Christians who disagree with the theocratic ruling party would suffer, too. One has only to look at the theocracies in the world today to see that many adherents of the dominant religion do not fare well, much less the adherents to minority opinions.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I'm a lawyer, and THAT is a VERY interesting question.    It would depend on the exact wording of the law that enacted same sex marriage, and the wording of the statutes that define common law marriage.    In many states The essential elements of a common-law marriage are: (i) an express or implied agreement to enter into marriage, (ii) cohabitation as husband and wife, and (iii) holding themselves out to the public as being married.    Unless the law was carefully drafted, it could possibly have that effect, depending on how the common law marriage statute was worded, and if you had an express or implied agreement to be married and/or had held yourselves out to be married. I don't know if "being a couple" would count or not.     It could easily be avoided by putting in a non-retroactivity clause.    The interesting question would be if two heterosexual men were sharing an apartment, say as college students, and they wound up discovering that they were "common law married".     Sounds like the plot for an Adam Sandler movie.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Hmm.   (you mean if same sex marriage was NOT made legal)   I think your saying - that if there is no marriage for homosexuals then everyone under one roof would be 'common law' married.  So, per your deductive reasoning ... marriage must be available for gays.    Common law marriage would apply in many domestic issues requiring legal/law intervention such as abuse or estate issues.  But common law marriage can be established legally and documented just as you would marriage.    You said you support 'love'.  That is poetic, and beautiful.  Do you also support love between one man and 10 women?  How about one man and his dog?  One woman and her son?        If you have no limits and marriage is a free-for-all, then marriage isn't a sacrament to you and you should leave it alone for those whom it means a great deal.    If you think there should be some limits (excluding gay marriage) then who should determine the limits?  If you think it should be left to votes, then so be it.  But will you leave it alone when the vote comes thru?      Gay people don't want a ticket to ride the bus like everyone else.  They want to ride the bus ... on the hood.|`|DArAz67Caa	NO----common law marriage is much much different-------isn't it time you find a wife to start a family with anyhow--??|`|BtFbHjHZaa	As far as the legal issue, Yes of course.    If you lived in a state ( and were residence) which legalzied homosexual marriage you would be entitled to all benefits that went alogn with that.    Unless a specific clause or ammendment directly stated that common law marriage (in your state) had to be between a man and a women.    If you are only wanting to know this to get a tax break, be warned. If you say that you and him are "Married" if you ever call him your husband or he does to you. Then you are liable for all the things associated with marriage.    He is entitled to half of our belongings, income and so on.    ps. urban naturalist is quite wrong. No law canadian or not, can make you have sex.  That would be saying that you are not legally married (to anyone) unless you are having sex, that is not the case, and if it is canada is stupid.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	huh???????????      noooooooo|`|pYimIJAWaa	I'm not sure which country you live in, but in Canada, to be considered a common law couple, you not only have to be living with the other person, you also have to be having intimate relations - sex - with him/her.     None of my business what you and your roommate are up to, but I'm sure you can work it out from there on your own :) .|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Just because you are roommates and cohabitating together for a prolonged length of time, that does not quality for a common law marriage.    "Cohabitation alone does not create a common-law marriage; the couple must hold themselves out to the world as spouses; and     There must be mutual consent of the parties to the relationship constituting a marriage."|`|AA11264399	It's not really any different from opposite sex roommates, so no.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	It could only apply if you were living together as a married couple; joint accounts, sharing a bed, making love, raising kids...but common law marriages are generally meaningless now.|`|ad6XOMliaa	In most states "common law" marriage is applicable only if you present yourself as an "item" so to say. Well, if that is the case for same sex couples it would apply.    Pondering: Now I think you have hit on something (maybe by accident), If a same sex couple does not get married because it is illegal through the front door (so to say), what if they present themselves as an "item" for 7 years?  In some states they would be legally married even if the state had outlawed same sex marriage ceremonies in that state?     I know you are smart enough to figure out what I was saying/thinking. -- smiles (I am no very clear expressing myself today)|`|b4c9e2b92e1f026eefef2790f5184d75aa	I don't have an answer to your question but I hope to see the day when two people, regardless of their sexual orientation can express their love through marriage (a legal contract) and receive the benefits written into law that goes along with marriage.|`|fitsd4FGaa	I see what you're saying.  Suppose two people of the same sex lived together for a few years and one of them dies.  The living roommate could petition the court to take the assets of the dead roommate under a common law marriage statute.|`|AA11737190	Are you having sex with your roommate?|`|qmG7q823aa	nope|`|GrBpZNllaa	if u and ur roomate are gay, and the you get married, then yes you would be married|`|jtcf6xd4aa	Marriage, in a legal and emotional sense, is more than just sharing a house. It requires a caring relationship that is proven in many different ways. The relationship must be one in which you view yourself as a couple and plan to spend your time strengthening that couple. Requirements for citizenship as a spouse will give you more specific ideas on what creates a relationship in the legal sense.|`|14JVQP9Paa	I've thought of that.  That situation is a product of common law marriage being a stupid idea from the get-go.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Common law marriages were recognized in the past, yes, but only under the definition of what a marriage consisted of. So, same-sex relationships (call them roommates) did not qualify. Common-law marriages are quite uncommon in today's society. They were originally a way to get around the demands of a dowry.|`|TOTFTdJRaa	Possibly its difficult to know I suggest you post this in the law and ethics board they might be better equipped to answer your question as this is a legal issue not a religious one|`|PWankIUpaa	Yes!    I find it interesting that YOU call God a Hater! Christan simply follow God we live by His Laws above the laws of mankind and America was built on those Laws found Leviticus!     The Very Definition of God is Love and we follow His example!     We do not discriminate we call a sin what it is  sin! We tell you that if you do not stop sinning and turn to God you will have eternal torment in hopes of helping you to escape that fate.     We do this out  of love and caring for souls who do not know or refuse to acknowledge that Truth is Truth and it is absolute!    All  we do is try to  stop a man from jumping into a Burning Fire that will give torment for an Eternity and Never let up day and night is your Definition of hate ! May be a look at Webster's dictionary might help you a bit then I suggest that you actually Read the Holy and Inerrant Word of God the Holy Bible!|`|AA11946554	I think the two of you would not only have to share bills but SAY that you are married.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Would I be common law married to my son? hum.    It might do away with the concept of "common law" marriage.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Not really, but in the state of California, you can call yourselves domestic partners after only six months for most things (health insurance, etc.).  Some insurers and such only require one month.    Heck, my own sister could be covered by me if I live w/ her long enough I think!    EDIT:  I just spoke w/ our benefits manager here at work and the person must presumably be romantically involved w/ you, not just a family member.  Common law takes seven years, but again, domestic partnership is much shorter.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	That would be kinda cool if it was, I mean you get all kinds of benefits.    Losasha: that's offensive.  Not everyone gets married and has a family.  I'm childfree by choice.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Well, presumably you could claim it, but it's no more automatic than it would be for different-sexed flatmates.

kq1RIDEoaa	curiosity, appreciation of each others looks, closeness emotionally spilling over into physical closeness, Why do any two people kiss!|`|RSv2E2KNaa	It's just probably flirt and doesn't mean anything serious.|`|52VDjbNTaa	I have lots of straight friends that kiss girls.  Perhaps, because you are so close, she has felt attracted to you, & she wanted to try it out. Perhaps she is seeing if you are comfortable.  You will never really know unless you talk to her.  Politely ask why she did it, saying you don't mind.  It is a perfectly normal phase to go through.  I'm bisexual, & I've had urges to kiss my best friend before.  It passed for me though.  If you are uncomfortable, distance yourself slightly, so that you're not spending too much time together, as you don't want her to get the wrong idea.  But, if you're OK with it, it seems harmless enough, so just go with the flow!|`|THJCWCoMaa	probably because you like to eat tacos.|`|65B842gaaa	because you wanted to, OMG was this a hard question?|`|1otDoagkaa	how was it like.. will u do it again?|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	Because both of you wanted it at that moment.    Don't worry too much about it, that doesn't make you anything. People like to experiment and have fun, it's totally normal. If it keeps happening frequently, then you should ask yourself why.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|uD1UFdRsaa	Idk people accidently kiss all the time. I did it on new years cause our mouths slipped Lol. Or there could be some unknown attraction there. Don't stress.

M6U7jVoQaa	yes|`|MMImKRAgaa	yes, it is said|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	Angel Gabriel talked to Zachariah, Mary & to Joseph (dream). That the child born is conceived of the Holy Spirit and shall be named Yeshua for He shall save His people. And also the birth of John the Baptist.    Fallen angel of Tyre is the angel who talked to Muhammad. But he falsely claimed to be Gabriel. Since he said a bit of truth & added deception. Even denying Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Lamb of God, the Resurrection & the Life.  And it is written in the bible that the prince of Tyre wouldn't be himself anymore, but a terror.    So? Terrorism is rooted in the prince of Tyre.|`|0gNKRdmiaa	Yes it was the angel Gabriel (Jibreel in Arabic) who visited Muhammad and Jesus and Mary.|`|0yTM98Odaa	The Archangel Gabriel is Gods messenger and Jesus is God incarnate.  Mohammed was never visited by the Archangel Gabriel, what ever he was visited by was demonic.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	What BrotherM said.|`|BtFbHjHZaa	Please say "According to the Bible" when asking such questions. Otherwise you portray it as fact, and it is far from fact.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Muhammad started a false religion.  He was only called by Satan.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Muhammad pinched the name from Jewish tradition; which is kind of strange, why should a Hebrew spirit approach an Arab? It goes with this Islamic idea that their revelation caps and completes all previous ones.      As for Jesus, I think you will find that it's his mum who had the alleged chat with the winged being.  Who I think was imaginary in both cases.|`|iNn9mmOtaa	Gabriel is a man, familiar with night visions,  the high flying touching sort in Daniel 9:21,   and also the touchy sort in Luke 1:21, even  the sort who takes advantage of in Luke 1:28;  so then obviously an angel of a Ghostly Law God.  For there is no respect of persons with Grace God.|`|95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	In the Scriptures, Gabriel only appeared to two people, Zacharias (Luke 1:19) and Mary (Luke 1:26). I highly doubt Gabriel appeared to Muhammed. If he did, he would have spoke of Christ and told him to worship Him as God.
CfZn9kK5aa	There are plenty of people in similar situations. I would suggest looking for another bisexual.      It is NOT cheating as long as the partner knows and consents to it. Cheating involves lieing and doing it behind the other persons back.    --    It IS called polyamory. Polyamory is being in a relationship thanh more than one person. Polygamy is being married to more than one person regardless of gender. Polyandry is when a woman has more than one husband, and polygyny is when a man has more than one wife.|`|uky2nsh8aa	it's called polygamy, and no, i would not.|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I do think it can be possible to be in love with two people at once. In fact, it happens quite often. However, I think most of the people who experience this end up choosing one of the people they're in love with to start a relationship.    Personally, I wouldn't date a girl who is already involved with someone else (girl or boy). I'm not a selfish person, but a partner is something I do not want to share.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|XjLvbfTZaa	No.  It's cheating.  Call it what you will, it's still cheating.  And yes, a woman who's with a man is just not appealing.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	you cant have the best of both worlds....you can but it does come with consequences.    i believe its wrong what your doing,you should be happy with the partner you have.  i see it as weakness or a relationship that aint working out if you have to get affection from somebody else.|`|t8WpznW4aa	I dated a girl that was with a guy and it was really just not that great because she was more into him, if you choose to do this you might want to make sure this girl doesn't want to be serious with you because if you have a husband its just unfair to the woman unless shes truely ok with it.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	its called polygamy.  and no i wouldnt.|`|rKXf85ipaa	Here is a rather simple solution, date other bisexuals, you don't have to date homosexuals to have a same sex relationship.  This is pretty much what I came up with as a plan for myself since I want a similar relationship in the future.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	Definitely not, because it's cheating. I'm really open to sexuality and think it's okay to be gay,bi,straight, etc. But once you've chosen someone, you gotta stay commited to them for life, regardless of their gender. If you're already thinking of cheating on your fiance with a girl (or other man), then he's probably not the one for you.|`|mq7X8j4Kaa	No, it's not called polygamy - that's a man having more than one wife. This is polyamory - the capacity to love more than one person at once. Not everyone agrees with it, but it is not cheating if both partners are willing.    It can be very hard to find other polyamorous people, I've had the same problems in the past. I would date a woman who was involved with a man, provided he had no problems with the situation and everyone was honest about their feelings to avoid jealousy.

The most important thing to note is that 'Oh God', 'For God's sake' or 'Jesus Christ!' etc. are all figures of speech that many people use in their everyday vocabulary. Most people don't even think about what they're saying; it's just a natural reaction that comes when they are surprised or shocked. For example, maybe you would say 'ouch' or 'ow' if you stubbed your toe, or 'darn' or 'damn' if you made a mistake, but you wouldn't think about saying these things, would you? They just come out!  Likewise, for these people, they don't mean any offense - they're not even aware they're causing any! Similarly, this doesn't mean they believe or don't believe in God - it's just a figure of speech.    As regards the biggest protester being the biggest doubter - this would often be true, but this does not mean they're thinking of changing their minds on the topic any time soon!    Hope that helps
76cb1cf3a7a4bfc0568e1cf3818afbc0aa	maybe you should have payed more attention to what they were teaching in preschool because it wasn't "analogy."    I've read and reread your "question" several times now and I'm still not seeing your point.  To answer the only question there, yes I'm a Christian and yes I know what an analogy is.  To speak to what little I can make out from the rest of your ramble, true satanists know perfectly well why they are compared to Satan; because they worship Satan.  What i don't actually understand is why... Satan is a Biblical reference... if someone believes the Bible enough to believe in Satan they should already know that they lose.  Either the Bible is all wrong, in which case how can they believe in Satan, or it's all right, and they need to pay closer attention to the script for the end of the world... God wins, Satan and his followers get tossed into the fiery pit.  The sad part is, Satan will take worship if he can get it but he wants is for us to be "good people" to be kind and loving... and to think that that's enough.  I makes no difference to him if we are "good" or "evil," he gets the souls of every person who does not trust Jesus Christ as their personal savior.  A christian understands that "Christian" means "Christ like."  It is what we should strive to be, not to earn salvation (we can't) but as a response to our salvation.

Then i eventually realized god was something invented by humans and there is no proof whatsoever and everything can be explained scientifically without a god.    So basically, No proof|`|2rJwgk40aa	No proof.None.|`|2QuGuphYaa	Do you believe in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, or gnomes?    Same reason, we just apply that same logic to all gods as well.|`|p1nZmNcOaa	Why dont you believe in Zues? Or Allah? Why? Because it doesnt work for you. It doesnt make sense to you. Same thing. Now get off your high horse.|`|n1hvdsSxaa	Why do you?      If everything has a source and god is that source, then god must have existed without it before he created it. So if god created time and space, he must live outside of time and space. Thus he is non-existent. If all life must come from something and that is god, god is not alive and hence non-existent. If moral must come from god, god lacks moral. If logic comes from god, god is illogic. If nature comes from god, god is unnatural. If existence comes from god, god is non-existent. If god is the cause of everything, god is void.    The conception of God that most people around the world have simply cannot exist. First, let me define what most people think of as God: An all-powerful being, who created the universe, who is all-good. Now, you would think that a universe created by such a being would be a wonderful place to live in. Of course, as we all know, this is not the case. Innocent children get raped by pedophiles. Criminal CEO's rob people of billions and get away with it. People in third world countries work their asses off and yet they live horrible lives. If God is both willing and capable of stopping these perversions of justice, then why doesnt he? The answer, of course, is that he doesn't exist.    There is a test, based on the ontological evidence against god, that you can do to try the existence of god. Pray, and ask god to provide you with a clear proof for his existence within a week. After that week, if you have got a proof that god exists, send me the evidence. If not, there are only three reasons I can think of that are plausible: (1) God does not exist, (2) God does not want to or (3) God can't give you this evidence. Because of the ontological evidence, alternative (2) and (3) are not worth your worship and thus they equal alternative (1). So if you get no response there is no god....            Yep. Its Proved. The Bible... Is A Fiction Book.|`|HDeUYCnXaa	i'm agnostic, but do you believe in the tooth fairy/Zeus/the flying spaghetti monster/Vishnu? oh, is that a no? well why don't you?

God (and I'm only capitalizing that word because it's at the beginning of a sentence) was invented because of man's arrogance. "OH, there's GOT to be a god - how else do you explain us being here??"  Well, I don't explain us being here - I leave that to the scientists.   In all honesty, I can't believe anyone with half of a brain WOULD believe in a god. It's utter and complete nonsense.|`|TnquzeM5aa	Because.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	because I can't.      I once did, but then I learned too much, especially how to think, logically.    I lost the ability to pretend hard enough to fool myself.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|uxfacsgmaa	No proof.|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	Absolutely no evidence.

Actually, I don't believe in all of them equally, except for maybe the FSM who is definitely more fun than any other god except possibly Krishna.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Plenty of reasons.  If you take a good hard look at the universe, you can see how the possibility of God is greatly reduced.  If you take a look at religion, and all the differences between them, this conclusion is only enhanced.  Science and Mathematics are absolute.  What is true here on Earth is true on Mars, or on some as of yet undiscovered planet 6.8 trillion light years away.  God isn't even the same here on this small planet.  He differs from religion to religion.  A belief is a Deity simply does not make sense.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Lack of evidence.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Lack of a soul.    Lack of evidence (not proof, just evidence would be nice).|`|yHfsHp6naa	No credible evidence and the fact that the concept of a supernatural being is irrational.|`|d8XND5ngaa	There is insufficient empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of a god and/or gods.|`|ATsdSM7saa	All other gods are false, I'm sure you have no trouble swallowing that one.    So what makes this God any more real, nothing!    There is no more evidence for your God than there is for Zeus.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Which God?|`|0qhRIKpSaa	The stories of the Bible are not actual history. Adam and Eve did not exist. The earth was not created in six days. Noah didn't build a boat that could hold 2 of every creature. People don't speak different languages because they built a tower that was too tall for God. These stories were told as actual history until science proved them wrong. The Bible is just the Hebrew creation myth. Every culture has their myth as a way to explain the unexplainable. We know that evolution is reality. We are related to monkey's. And there were no prophets that declared this to be the case, so there's no supernatural humans who can see the future.   And the argument that someone had to create the world doesn't make any sense. Believers say this life is too complicated to just come into existence. But isn't God infinitely more complicated? And most Christians believe that he just popped into existence. I don't believe it.
zOX3bunMaa	I think this Christianity is a load of hooey.    Scientists have more reasonable explanations, too. And, they say God created the animas, including mammals- The first mammals were rodents!    And there's no proof of God creating a sabre-tooth cat, or a deinosuchus, or any of the other extinct animals. There's PROOF of these animals, and yet, no proof of God.    I think I read a book that had the creation theory in it, I'll edit it in :)    EDIT: The earth was formed from dust and gases floating around the sun.The gas cloud becomes extremely hot and turns into an enormous liquid sphere. The sphere slowly cooled down, and a layer of rock formed over it. The first living things were incredibly tiny and no more complex than a tadpole. Slowly, they changed, growing and evolving to the animals we know of today.|`|9j4L8Iqfaa	I know what you mean... I honestly don't believe it's possible.  My entire family is Christian, but I'm not in on it because I'm with Science on this one.|`|jI652qbYaa	light doesn't only come from the son, the dome is heaven, not the sky, and time is probably wrong, so he didn't create humans five days later.  that or when he sent them out, he sent them out at a time where he could have made something evolve so that it turned into humans when we came out.  Hope that makes sense.|`|M6U7jVoQaa	It is not real like this. The error is that Bible had been so changed during translations, that words were mis-translated, and diverged over thousands of years to give us this story.|`|4NV4bew9aa	The creation story in Genesis is a myth. It's not "Real" or "True" in a scientific sense. Myths are not theories. They are stories.      Humans did not evolve from monkeys either. Monkeys the greater apes and primates ALL evolved from earlier forms.    Evolution is a process. It is a theory based on observed data.    Do not confuse evolution and science theories with myths.    Myths and science are two different ways of looking at the world.    They do not necessarily contradict or oppose eachother!      If your Scripture or Biblical Studies teacher or group leader is a creationist fundie loon ignore them since they probably also blindly parrot church doctrine without thinking about it?    Go down to the Library and read more science books and think about what you read.     BUT also Study the Bible with a good commentary with no doctrinal biases that focuses on explaining the differences between the original Hebrew or Greek and English translations.    Faith is about experiencing the Divine.    Science is about explaining Creation.     Genesis is not a science text book!    It's your responsibility to learn to balance faith and reason!|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	The story of Genesis is a METAPHOR, which means like Jesus saying you have to be 'born again' to enter the 'kingdom of heaven', he wasn't just talking about crawling back into ole mommy and popping out again.    Because there is a strong metaphoric tradition that underlies most religious tenents, many non-believers (and believers, for that matter) forget how suggestive these stories are meant to be. They are meant to convey spiritual truths, not scientific ones. The seven days of creation are really a metaphorical link to the multiples of seven that refer constantly throughout the bible. The bible, actually, is one great big numerological codex, a metaphorical fragment of existence that contains existence (like a strand of your hair contains your entire genetic code within it.) There are scientific truths in it, but the stronger truths are spiritual/moral, and not all of them are as obvious as they may appear.    The bible is a strand of hair taken from the head of existence, it is not existence itself. Remember that and the rest will come to you.
EmOnt7FIaa	Well, i'm sorry but your just going to have to keep asking your family members or you can go to dnaancestryproject.com and get a test there, those are your only two options. Nobody can tell somebodies nationality by looking at them.    NOBODY in your family is willing to talk about your family history?    Ask your parents for your grandparents phone number and they might know or remember one of their parents tell them about their backround.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Yes you look like the light haired irish.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	well you look Irish to me but i can't tell who were your ancestors just by looking at you.

I feel really sorry for you guys, your ancestors really cheated you out of an identity when they came over and stole my country. At least we still have our identity...good luck! Its always good to know where you came from.    edit:ancestry.com is free for one week.|`|Um52yp60aa	yeah u do look irish. maybe scotish ?|`|iUV1v87baa	In my opinion you look very Irish. But that doesn't mean you are.|`|i5mjNiPsaa	I think there are some sources you can trace your ancestry from like ancestry.com although I'm not sure it's free but have a look around and see what you find :) hopefully you might get a good deal.    You look Irish/Scottish with Nordic blood possibly Norwegian or Finnish. You certainly don't look as if though you have any influences from outside of Europe so if you want a more accurate result in discovering your ancestry by other means like research from books etc, keep in mind the sources of your genetics are definitely deriving from Northern and Western Europe and you will find the answer I'm sure :).  Good luck!
eRT4d6hvaa	My husbands family are beautiful and wonderful people.  They are the family I would have chosen if Allah allowed us to chose our families.  Vibrant, passionate, warm , loving with sincerity, morals and the wisdom of God in their hearts.     They were this way when I met them as a non muslim and are the same people to me since my conversion.    I have known many muslims by name, but few by name and their  nature and in their treatment of others.     I see what it is to be a good muslim through them.    SubhanAllah!  A great blessing and role model for me and my son.    We are from different cultures and places.. morrocco and england.  But one family now.    May Allah bless them all.|`|zBqt99avaa	We're not married yet.    He lives with his sister here in Canada.  She and I have a difficult relationship.  They have always lived together and she isn't particularly happy about him finding love.  It's gotten better over time, since even a blind man could see that he adores me, and by opposing me, she'll be the person out in the cold.      She has a rough manner and flies off the handle sometimes, when he's not around, of course.  I'm not supposed to say anything, although I recently won the concession that it's unfair that I should have to adapt to her, but she is not in any way required to adapt to me.  All that said, I like her, and she had a lot of good points, and she seems to like me, in her own way.  She seems to be going through early menopause, which may explain her behaviour.    Yes, the culture clashes.  She tries to run my home when she's here.  She also likes to interfere in our arguments, when we have them, telling me how and what I'm "allowed" to say to her brother.    I have very good self restraint.  I simply either joke with her, (watch it, or you'll be getting it next!) or I very sweetly tell her I need to discuss this issue with her brother.  More like, sweet acid...    Finally, although he worships his sister and thinks she's an angel, I've explained that this behaviour doesn't work for me, and that even if she doesn't mean anything by it, I can't live with it.  So he can control her, or I will.  He's done a good job lately of stopping her when she gets too aggressive.    IMO, if she respected him more, she would treat me better, but this is not a theory he would care to hear.  For my health, I limit my contact with her, which unfortunately limits my contact with him, since they live together.  Inshallah we will get married soon.  I live 100 kms away and that should make it easier.    I have had limited communications with his family overseas.  They seem very nice, however, and he assures me his mom and his sister are not alike.  The last thing I want is to separate him from his family.  I love that he cares so much for them.  But that doesn't mean I should be abused, either, intentionally or not.      In contrast, my ex boyfriend was also Muslim (from Yugo) and I became so close with his family that his sister is still my best friend.  All types of relationships are possible, but everyone has to be willing to be polite and work hard at overcoming the barriers.    E-mail me, if you want, if you have specific issues you don't want to post.    EDIT:  Mohammad, I suggest you read the Quran, since it clearly states Muslim men can marry women of the book, no conversion necessary.|`|3E2EQH12aa	for the first few months of being married, i actually was not muslim. from day 1 when they met me , they were extremely extremely kind to me, very accepting (although i am sure this isnt the norm, to be fair), even tho i was their son's gf. and they still are to this day we've been married almost 6 years|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	I honestly dont know how you can get on by with a Muslim husband for long -IF you can that's okay but in my view, with their views on life, the way you should live etc - not my cup of tea.|`|Q3WweuOCaa	What?|`|vnty8yOgaa	A true Muslim Husband is a blessing for Non Muslim wife.

Choose any field of science from anatomy to genetics and one cannot legitimately argue that a human fetus is less than a human being.  A human fetus needs what a human adult needs to survive, an appropriate environment and nourishment.  Fetus itself is a generic term, like the term adolescent, it is dishonest to argue that a fetus is a fetus and hence worthy of death.  The fetus in the womb of a human being is 100% human being.   Biblically, Luke, the inspired doctor, used the exact same word to describe a baby in the arms as he did a baby in the womb.    Pro-choice, is against any choice for the unborn.  It is a clever attempt to condone murder.  Many US Supreme Court decisions (including those stating that a black person is less than a person) have been rightly overturned.  Now that Roe v. Wade decides that a human fetus is less than a person, it also must be overturned by those who hate the murder of innocents.|`|AAAw24KOaa	There are secular implications.

Right?|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It really isn't a matter of separation because there are valid positions on either side of the issue (that have nothing to do with religion), but like all controversial issues, the real solution lies somewhere in the middle.

I have yet to be presented with such evidence; therefore, the original position stands.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	You're listening to the wrong atheists then. Saying "there is no god" is a statement of faith just like saying "there is a god." There's no evidence for or against gods existing so any statement implying certainty about gods is a statement of faith. See, atheists just don't believe, period. They don't select the optional extra of wasting their lives hoping something might be true. Atheists are content with knowing and learning and keeping an open mind allowing for the discovery of new information.|`|W3GC6aBMaa	That' s what I am keeping saying; I mean, I tried to point this out quite a few times but nobody listen to me..|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I have no evidence to believe there is an afterlife.  Why would I have to defend not believing in something for which there is not one shred of credible evidence?   I assume you're a Christian.  Buddhists believe in reincarnation.  Why don't you?  Prove to me that there is no reincarnation.    Until there is evidence to the contrary, I believe that non-existence after death is exactly like non-existence before birth.    Your reasoning, if you can call it that, is seriously flawed.  Edit:  "Soon," you're wrong.  We're all dying.  Every day brings us closer to death.  It's not like I'm going to be surprised one day and say, "Damn, I'm dying.  Better start believing in god now.  Gee, I thought I was going to live forever."    Religion exists because humans know they're going to die.  They don't like the idea, and they're afraid of it.  Some may find comfort in myths, but myths do not change reality.|`|AA11620976	One of the basic rules of life is that it's impossible to cover all of the things that can happen to you  ,so what you try to do is to divide them up into three broad classes of Probable ,Possible .and Unlikely   I think that the real difference between Atheists and Theists is that Atheists file the idea of god under Unlikely and therefor don't devote too much of their time worrying  about it and Theists file the idea of god under Probable and of course spend a lot of their time worrying about it.|`|YQMCVuFiaa	The religious depiction of God does not exist, at least not this benevolent, perfect, and all-knowing being that seems to be so revered. Religion is creation of man, religion created god, man created god.    Some atheists may argue that god does exist, just way far beyond what anyone was originally hoping. God is an idea, and exists only in the minds of the people that still believe. Much like the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, or the Easter Bunny. They all exist, the catch is only in the reaches of one's imagination.    I wont deny there is no God, as that is absolutely impossible. It's like two people arguing over a blank piece of paper: one sees a picture, the other sees it as blank. How would one side 'prove' the other wrong? They can't -- it's something they see and created, or something they recognize to be what it is. It exists to them, which is the problem.    I recognize that I do not know everything, far from it actually. My explanation for what I cannot explain is not 'Goddidit', but 'I don't know'.     "aren't BOTH sides often guilty of being absolutely certain they know which way is right?"    There is always a right and a wrong, both may actually be wrong, who knows. Though I do know, religion is wrong, and source for the same corruption they seem to 'believe' they are the only ones without.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	I agree that logic holds the burden of proof on the positive assertion that there is a god and/or afterlife.    But, let me also posit that you are missing the difference in the underlying theory of truth between believers and atheists.    Believers are inclined to see evidence as adding to the strength of what they believe.  Atheists are inclined to see evidence as a prerequisite to form a belief about what is true.    That is, atheists are not certain about the afterlife without proof of the afterlife.  The more proof, the stronger the belief.  The less proof, the weaker the belief.    In particular, (fair minded) (honest) atheists are less likely to make absolute claims about anything that lacks decisive, clear proof:      For example, ask one of us privately about "a god" and define him very loosely outside logical proof.  Such a god might exist.  While unlikely, the lack of positive proof cannot be used to rule out all possibility.    On the other hand, define God with the Christian context of a personal, creator God with the Bible as a working definition and the same fair minded atheist will have a field day.  From the purely scientific game of piles of repeatable evidence and correct prediction, the theory of evolution looks as solid as the theory of gravity next to the theory of Biblical accuracy.|`|X548yCR6aa	Oh, I'm not saying gods absolutely certainly don't exist, I'm just saying they all have a roughly equal chance of existing and there are thousands of them.    Why would I favor one god over the others?|`|eCp0ERSCaa	You are mistaken. Atheists aren't making assertions. They are just pointing out that there is absolutely no evidence for the existence of gods, so there is absolutely no compelling reason to accept claims of that sort. If I say that a body decays after death, that is a fact supported by evidence. If I say that a soul ascends to heaven after death, that is a wish at best, a delusion, a fantasy, etc, unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.|`|5eGE4AkLaa	Both sides often make that same error in judgement.

Dawkins discusses a sliding scale with those at both ends executing similar amounts of faith in something they can't prove.

I accept the possibility that I am wrong, thus sidestepping the faith thing.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	I'm not an ATHEIST, just an atheist.

Humans have a long track history of making mistakes so I would not read too much into it.|`|iWlNDrLGaa	One key difference between the two views is that atheists (myself included) do not believe in something because they see no proof for it, and that theists believe in something despite lack of proof. I'm not saying that I know there are no gods, but I know that I have never seen proof of the existence of a god and have never felt the faith that causes people to believe in a god. It's the same reason that most people don't believe in unicorns and leprechauns.|`|od8VeRTDaa	Saying that there is no god (lower g) is not a statement of faith.     This is the burden of proof fallacy.    For instance, I could tell you right now that I sincerely believe that there is a floating pink teacup revolving around the moon, and that it alone is responsible for all weather phenomena as well as tides and seasons. However, without proof, that is a statement of faith. Someone who does not believe in said teacup is not making a statement of faith, they are merely rejecting your own statement as valid.  I could then go on to state that the reason the pink teacup has not been detected by scientists is that it is invisible.  When asked how I know that the pink teacup exists, I could claim to be psychic.    Here, the burden of proof is on me. If you say, rightly so, that there is no teacup, then you are not making a statement of faith, as it is up to me to prove my claim.    You could argue that (Occam's razor) the moon causes the tides, and that I fabricated this teacup to be in close proximity to the moon in order to add validity to my claim.       Similarly, a long, long time ago, someone claimed that there was a god ,or several gods and goddesses (lower g). The reason everything exists was because of said gods, and the reason the person knew this is because they were a prophet.....and you know the rest.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I see very few atheists who say they KNOW that no God of any kind exists.     Most simply say they don't have enough evidence in favor of a deity; Especially a specific one.    So while there may be some atheists who say there is no God, they aren't the majority.    When it comes to believers, it's the opposite.    I bet you'd be hard pressed to find a believer, Christian or not, admit the possibility that they could be wrong, and either believing in the wrong deity, or that no God exists.    So in general, no, I don't think both sides are equally guilty of "absolute certainty".|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	atheists don't necessarily not believe in an afterlife, they believe there is no god (and the certainty you are referring to usually comes into play when distingusing between atheists and agnostics...who just profess to not know and have doubts)|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	I have never said I'm 100% certain there isn't a god.|`|WcxrnINvaa	I'm not certain either way, I just don't think there's enough evidence to conclude there is a god.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	It's fine that christians "know" that god exists and so on.    it's fine that atheists "know" that god doesn't exist and there is nothing.    It's not hypocritical. The only thing they can be guilty of is trying to convince others that they are wrong. Not all christians or atheists do this, but some do and that is the hypocrisy.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Christians are the problem, because they claim that a magical fairy exists, and they require that a complete lack of evidence for their fairy be considered proof. Atheists, on the other hand, use basic logic. You are right that atheists should not claim to know for a fact that the tooth fairy does not exist, since it would be a waste of time to deny each and every fairy and ogre.
mFsM9AgPaa	100% agreed, its an idiotic argument...i mean there are pro choice arguments that make sense but  ur rite this one has nothing to do with anything, im pro life, and ill debate anyone on it, but not if someone is going to say crap like that|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Great question I completley agree.|`|4LYasBGXaa	it is a relevant argument-    the reason bieng that unlike drugs, the direct use of the drug does not have a high risk of death.    abortion is a balancing act- the life of the mother, and the life of the fetus.  in law- even christianity recognizes the mother's life and value of it- so as a real consequence if we see real deaths balanced against potential lives it is a concern.      as for your example- you picked a bad one- you realize that drugs were made illegal and the war on drugs was due to the political backlash against nixon-    so the "war on drugs" is a bunch of hooey.     cocaine was outlawed due to racial fear of black dock workers bieng given cocaine in order to work faster raping white women.    opiates were made illegal becasue of fear of what was going on in the "opium dens" of china towns popping up in the us.    the "war on drugs" is also personal choice. and a poor example for you.    EDIT:    as for your "baby girl" example- thats predicting the past once you know the outcome.     if her mother had a miscarriage or complications during birth your "baby girl" would also not be alive- or if she was a premie or any other number of reasons.    that statement is like saying that i should bet my life savings on the steelers to win the superbowl AFTER the fact.    essentially, monday morning quarterbacking.    EDIT2: also that argument worked and was valid with prohibition.  drug use just isn't as widespread and has become an "evil" rather than an out of the ordinary social activity like alcohol- and the fact that most people drink, but most dont do drugs is a big factor.  if men could get pregnant and had to carry children around and give birth i guarantee you the ranks of the pro-life movement would dwindle to near zero.|`|affb92500c4092ec6665779d8a952b58aa	Grow up!    What if your daughter was raped and left pregnant, how would you feel, would you really expect her to go through nine months of pregnancy and a birth, after her ordeal. To have her whole life ruined because of some male who couldn't control his baggage between his legs. What happens to the rapists, how many of them have to live with the outcome of rape the rest of their lives. Get real.|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	The legality of abortion issue also pertains to health issues.  The argument that you've cited is not a matter of "people are going to do it anyway, so it should be legal."  It is a matter of "people are going to do this and we would rather that, if they choose to go this path, a sterile, medically safe environment is used in order to cut down on possible public health issues."  Granted, it's not the best of arguments, but you're not really taking the entire argument into account.    However, with regard to your statement, if we go the route of definitions and decide that the ultimate argument against abortion is that of the humanity of the fetus, this leads us into other ethical problems.  I think that what we need to realize in this debate is that both the unborn child and the mother are people (one more developed than the other).  We cannot discount the emotional struggle of a mother who is potentially choosing abortion.  I think that we're sometimes to quick in our condemnation of the action and we want to paint with broad strokes to wipe out a problem.  Our bigger problem is unintended pregnancy and caring for people, both mothers and children, who don't have the means to care for themselves.|`|DXXpHKupaa	Actually, the argument is valid.    The term, "back alley", though not specific, is imagery for a seedy place-where you won't find a qualified doctor.      On top of that, there have been cases of botched abortions in back alleys and other unsafe places (leading to the term).    I understand that you love your daughter, and I believe that life begins at conception as well.    I'm not here to say that it's not killing-it is-so please try to understand that I'm not heartless.    I'm here to say that it's going to happen whether we want keep it legal or not.  I'd rather a woman have a safe alternative if she needs an abortion (in the case of rape, incest or if the birth could kill her).    If abortions become illegal-only criminals would preform them.    If a woman had to pick between a qualified doctor or a criminal in a dark alley-she'd be insane not to choose the doctor.    But if abortion is illegal-she could only choose the criminal.    Abortion is like war-they're both horrible things-but they are also at times necessary and as such-need to be understood.    The question of when life begins will never be solved, and in fact-only makes the matter more difficult to solve.    Both sides seem to want to keep arguing whether or not the fetus is a living being or not.  This is purely emotional and ethical, and does nothing to aid either side in winning.  I choose necessity and practicality with a touch of logic when looking at a problem.    Never have I seen an occurrence where a problem could be solved with emotion-but I've seen many in which it made the problem worse.    I'm pro-choice, but I'm very much against any but the most necessary abortions.    Of course there are women who just can't control themselves and have an abortion so they can't deal with the responsibilities.  However, there are also women who without an abortion would most certainly die.  Should a woman be forced to keep a child if she was raped?    You can't outlaw abortion and expect much good to come of it.  Granted, morally you'll feel much better, but in reality-you only make the situation far worse.    When alcohol was outlawed (prohibition), not only did people not stop drinking, they were forced to go to the mafia to get alcohol.  This led to the rise of organized crime in the United States.    As you can see, outlawing abortion, just like prohibition-will not solve the problem-it will make it worse.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Fetus is not "innocent baby" and it cant be murdered. Human rights go over fetus rights.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Yes a fetus is a human being. A masterpiece of God. He doesn't need our help protecting it.

If they don't die, they will likely not be able to conceive again.  This is a little off your topic, but in countries (Nicaragua in particular) where abortion is banned, doctors will not perform abortions on DEADLY ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies are where the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.  The doctors feel that it's better to let the woman die than risk spending time in jail for performing an abortion, if they can't prove the mother's life was at stake.  Please keep that in consideration.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	There is no abortion debate.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Thanks for sharing.    My mother wanted to abort me.

And since I am not a god/dess I have no business judging what other people do in their life. In your scenario you could fight for her life. But you have no business telling anyone else what to do.     That is why I am pro-choice.|`|AA12194228	I agree with you!

It WAS illegal and abortions continued and both the fetus and the woman died. What you're advocating, then, is punishing women who dare to have abortions with death. Very pro-life of you.     Why do you refer to the mother of your child as such and not your wife? Christians aren't supposed to be having children out of wedlock, either. Indeed, if ANY mother had had an abortion, their children would not be born. What's the point? It rather an immature argument since it has no bearing on the issue.     I would venture to say that if you had seen the mess made out of the women who had back alley abortions, you might be pro-choice NOT pro-abortion, too. Wouldn't it be sad if your baby's mother or your daughter, frightened and scared that you wouldn't approve of a pregnancy or for whatever other reason, had to resort to having a knife shoved up inside her because she wasn't allowed to have good medical care and ended up as a mess?     THAT'S the REAL issue. That's my opinion.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	That argument DOES work. Because no matter what you do, abortions will happen. They have been happening for centuries.

Keep your petty, controlling "morality" to yourself. I am a human being with more potential and value than a fetus.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	You are ignoring some basic facts.  It is not the fact that women will still get abortions, it is that those abortions will be unsafe, done by non-professionals or done by the women themselves.    The problem is that these abortions are unsafe, and women die.  You may say that this is their issue, etc. etc.  The fact of the matter is that women who are desperate will do this.    Do they deserve to die?  Do the resultant unwanted children deserve the life many have?  Does the fetus have more rights, inherently, than the mother?    You are quite incorrect to say that "The debate should only focus on the real issue, is a fetus a human individual?"  There is a lot more to it than that.|`|X548yCR6aa	Drugs should be legal too, this will make it better for everyone.

(Mat.5:11)  Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. (Mat.5:3)|`|Rc9SNllPaa	I don't try to perceive the difference. We are meant to act according to guru sastra and sadhu, not the mind.  In Bhagavad-gita the Lord states: 'Engage your mind in always thinking of Me, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me, surely you will come to Me.' and ' To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I will give the understanding by which they can come to Me.'  The mind can be the greatest friend or the worst enemy. The mind absorbed in the Lord is the greatest friend but otherwise is the enemy.  There are many things that can and do influence the living beings. There are three modes of material nature. Goodness, passion and ignorance. These three modes are aspects of the material energy of the Lord and the influence the living beings in different ways. There are also seeds of material desire stored in our hearts from the past, and they fructify at certain times and have a great effect on us and our thinking, feeling and willing. Idle mind is the devils workshop.   The material energy is known as the Maya prakrti or the illusory energy of the Lord. So it serves to keep all the living beings in this material world in illusion. To get out of that illusion we must follow the directions of Guru, Sastra and Sadhu. And engage fully, body, mind and soul, thoughts, words and deeds in the service of the Lord as desired by the Lord Himself. It is recommended that one chant the holy names of the Lord in order to control the mind and re-awaked our dormant spiritual consciousness. Hari nam Hari nam Hari nam eva kevalam, kalau nastyeva nastyeva nastyeva gatir anytah. Just chant the holy name, chant the holy name, chant the holy name, there is no other way, there is no other way,there is no other way in this age of hypocrisy and quarrel for self-realisation and God consciousness.   Scripture recommends chanting the Maha mantra which contains thre names of the Lord. Maha mantra means the great deliverer of the mind. When chanted attentively it controls the mind and all the voices and allows the eternal soul to re-awaken it's dormant pure love for the Lord once again.   I will leave it there. There is much much more. But if anyone is interested in taking it further they can contact me.

Let's get YOU "Enlightened"! You've been meditating and doing your program, doing good deeds, and eating your vegetables. You've given up meat, chicken and sex (in that order) and now you're thinking about going to an ashram, probably in India, or Germany or somewhere the Sattva is "high", and the teachers are disciplined and dedicated.    You've sworn to evolve and finally be free of all your ignorance and unhappiness, and maybe this time it will last - unlike all the other times when it turned into the same-old, same-old. That's why you saved all your money again, didn't pay your school loan, skipped Christmas with the family, chartered a plane to the Himalayas, because evolving, is more important to you than life itself.    Darlings, I'm here to save you A LOT OF MONEY, and and a lot of needless concern over your constant searching-itch that's led you to years of unfulfillment & useless tears. You plead with God, the Divine, Buddha, Jesus, the Guru, Mother Mary and your favorite lucky charm, to SAVE YOU from the torments of your own mind and fabricated stories of possibilities & spiritual success. So Let's DO IT already! Let's get YOU Enlightened, OK?    First let's start with one of the first concept you have about Enlightenment:    1. Enlightenment is a goal. I will only get there after I've climbed the mountain of samskara (world of misery, karma, Haagen Das, chocolate and videos). After I get really disciplined, the truth/the Self will be revealed to me.    FIRST OF ALL - enlightenment is not a goal, IT'S YOUR NATURE. You don't have to climb Mount Everest or get rid of your psychological traumas or clean your chakras. It is your Nature, everything else, and I mean EVERYTHING ELSE is a thought, a concept, an idea, something you read somewhere, something someone told you, something you believe. You can still be the "normal/bad" person you think you are and be "enlightened".    Enlightenment means finally recognizing your Nature, what you've always been RIGHT HERE in front of your nose. YOU ARE the silence and the thoughts and images that appear to "override" the silence that you long for. YOU ARE EVERYTHING.    Karma, Misery, the world of pleasure and pain are all ideas projected from the mind, which loves playing and seeing and sensing and feeling everything it can. It is not your Nature, yet you are THAT TOO. If you want to "get enlightened", RELAX with everything you're doing to get there and take a breather from all that feverish doing. Enjoy your programs & processes instead of technique-ing them into misery.    Your feverishness is not going to get you there any faster. Why? Because enlightenment is a "tweak" in perception. You suddenly get it, and even after you get it, you sometimes have to get it again and again and again. WHY? BECAUSE IT SO SIMPLE. You are enlightenment right NOW and you're still searching for it. Honestly, it's ridiculous how hard you work to get a little "enlightening" experience just to plummet into misery again. UP & down like a yo-yo, hoping the Divine will take mercy on you and cut the string.    THIS IS IT! Right here and right now. The chair you're sitting on, the dog you're petting, the letter you're writing, the music you're listening to, the socks you're wearing - everything that you're doing, looking at, thinking about is IT at this moment. If you sit down right now and close your eyes you will sense a quietude, a space inside you. There may be thoughts, but inbetween those thoughts, you'll notice some stillness - and that IS YOU. THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.    IN meditation or activity, when there are no thoughts and the silence is thick within, THERE YOU ARE. And when you get out of meditation and you start thinking again and the world comes in again (problems, duties, your mother) and the activity is appearing on the screen of your silence-KNOW THAT the silence HAS NOT GONE AWAY. IT IS STILL THERE. Silence and thoughts - all of it is YOU! A constant Happening on the screen of silence.    That Silence, that space, that emptiness (no thought, no feeling no nothing) is YOU. That is your Nature. That is your God, your Buddha, your Christ, your Guru. Right there, always right there. Do you Get IT? Or will you continue to look for it and refuse to believe the simplicity of it?    Why not take a chance and see where it leads you. Sit down, Be the Silence and watch the thoughts, your world, the universe come up again on the screen of Silence - all of that is YOU - YOU ARE EVERYTHING.|`|CmHLKKODaa	I don't really know How it happened other than it was totally Un related to what I was dealing with at the time !

The Small Silent Voice is either Deity, personal guide or my soul. It cannot be heard when chatter is going on.    To reach that voice, I meditate, applying the discipline of silence, breathing, attention. Once I get past all the chatter about what this and how that, I am able to focus on the inner life. The Voice comes to me as a knowing, not as a voice. Some solution, answer or idea will come to consciousness, and it is usually fully formed. It usually has an atmosphere of specialness, in spite of the "of course!" nature of its presentation.|`|A01w1dHqaa	this is the same as continual prayer. Fear brings up the analytical mind or chatter. Peace is God's thoughts.    Decisions come through out the day. Some are automatic and others you feel some uncertainty about. The right thinking can't happen in that atmosphere of conflict. Peace is necessary for the right decision or the answer will be fear or ego based. That peace comes by looking to God, always.   Peace comes through forgiveness and with forgiveness is always correction. God does not take away fear, but gives you the knowledge to do so.    The times without conflict, when you are happy, can be shared with God internally and with God in all life. Just being aware of that is prayer. This is actually called communion.    The "how" comes by listening. Then you know it works.    The analytical mind works for judgment, deciphering the physical world, but not decision making, that's when it goes into a fear mode because it separates instead of seeing things whole.. It's a good servant but a poor master.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	It is tough to explain in words.    I have meditated at length on many occasions as to how my conscious mind, subconscious mind, and spirit mind/connection to the universe sound. Which one would be drawing my mind to certain perceptions? When am I getting an answer and when is it just noise?    One thing that I have found is that when I can hear more than one voice say the the same thing, then I am on the right track.    Another thing I have been doing is saying "thank you" to "myself" for good advice even on the little things. We so often criticize our selves for even little mistakes, but we forget to give out the compliments. If it is an outside personality, I am sure they appreciate the acknowledgment.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Still voice usher in peace, relaxation, confidence.

We may not be so familiar with the Buddhist approach, which is to listen to the inner promptings of the Eternal.    Instead of asking what God can do for us, we need to ask what we must do to put ourselves in harmony with the Eternal.     Most of the time we are not quiet enough to hear anything other than the noisy demands of our greed, anger, worries, fears, frustrations.    Our culture encourages a constant input of noise: the music in elevators or while waiting on the phone, car radios, cell phones, television, radios, and headsets to wear while exercising.     We have a difficult task to find a quiet time when there is not a major input of external noise.    Even when we have established a time in our day for meditation, when we can listen to the silence, it is usually anything but silent.    It takes time to let go of the internal noises we generate for ourselves.     If we establish a regular practice of meditation, we create a situation where the noise and busy mental processes can settle, if not completely, at least a little.|`|AA11894640	That still small voice never participates in internal chatter....It speaks suddenly,  quietly...and is heard above that constant cacophony...silencing every voice,  for the moment...

While there can seemingly be much difference in all these voices, i tend to listen to them as equals, with no "voice" holding more bearing and power than the "others."  And, all together as one, i hear a universal voice that speaks within and throughout every aspect of life.  :-)|`|QJwOhM0qaa	I'm still getting there but I can recognize the difference between the dialogue and the story lines and the "still voice" as you call it. The major difference for me is that the voice does not necessarily speak a language, I don't rightly know how it communicates but it does so far faster than the drama voices that are driving down memory lane or creating the fictional future. I suppose the closest difference would be between reading something aloud to an audience and reading a book by yourself.     How is a still ongoing process of mindful meditation and right living. The better I live the less chatter and the more mindful I am, the more I'm in tune with the "here and now awareness".

After a little searching, I found an article about a person, "Thomas Parr, who was borne in the yeare 1483 in Rayne of King Edward IV being 152 years in ye yeare 1635 near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. His birth and death are well-researched and he is buried in the south transcept of Westminister Abbey, in London.  He is sketched here, a few months before he died, by famous artist Peter Paul Rubens.    Thomas lived a pastoral life in Winnington, his home, and was a bachelor for 80 years. When he finally married, he fathered 2 children; both died in infancy. Before his first wife died, he was punished by the vicar of Alberbury Parish Church for fornication, at 105 years old!    At 122 years old, he married the young lady in question, Catharine Milton, and fathered more children."    ====    The events are really back so far as to be untrustworthy, since the "oldest" man to live is Japanese, and his age at death is questioned. At any rate, hopefully, this answers your question sufficiently. There were no lists, that I could find on the subject, so this article (see the link in the Sources) was the best I could do.|`|gyhVnBN9aa	Abraham

Context - historical, social and cultural circumstances of the authors and the communities for whom they were writing are needed to understand and interpret.The impact of the literary genre which exceeds more than 100 styles, under the headings of narrative and poetry.   Understand it as a straight perfect narrative of historic events would leave it flat, irrelevant and lacking insight into who God is. He cannot be boxed in like a character in a novel.  Then the question of inerrancy.  An example would be the story of Job. The beginning starts with God allowing Satan to test Job. The ending is the Hollywood Happy Ever After story. The beginning and ending was added on my some scribe much later and is not consistent in anyway with the original poet.  The Bible has to be relevant now. The homosexuality of old which was viewed as a distorted sexuality ought to be embraced as being sanctioned by more current teaching in the Bible.|`|8FWq4XS5aa	apparently the bible was/is very hard to translate to english therefore all the different versions and interpretations. oh... and dont forget the books that were purposly left out of the bible.. wonder what they say?|`|tpn7iR48aa	supposedly its the word of god and god is "perfect" so then wouldnt it be perfect? that seems implied to me.

The reason they go into heat is biological/physiological - not because they get all horny when they watch their offspring get killed. It is a natural instinct - to pass along the genes. If your offspring gets snuffed out, the body immediately goes into mating process again... It has nothing to do with morals.     On the other hand, when some monkeys see one of their close relatives being beat up on, stolen from, or starving, they tend to come to the rescue... those are SIGNS of moral behavior.     Understand the difference now?|`|pYimIJAWaa	A) this is only one type of chimp - not all of them behave this way - the matriarchal ones are quite peaceful.    B) disagreeing with your moral view does not necessarily equate to 'having no morals'.

Edit:  I don't know that anyone calls them "moral" (by human standards) rather they might claim they are capable of moral actions, immense difference.|`|14JVQP9Paa	You have just described how their morals are a product of evolution.

XJ9oSR2daa	Of course...    The mind can do incredible things.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	Yes they can.  In fact, although I've never seen it documented, I wouldn't be surprised if a person could stop their own heart, if they truly wanted to die.    But regardless, I've had two grandparents that basically said, "I'm outta here..." and died a few minutes later.    Edit- I wouldn't say such a thing, no, because I would be lying.|`|AA11297267	...or maybe they were both just old? :)    Yes, the mind can certainly influence health or lack thereof.  And a will to fight off sickness goes a long way to helping a person get better, so if there's little or no will then it's easier for sickness to be fatal.  Many people married for a very long time get extremely depressed and lose the will to live when their lifetime partner dies, which is natural.    As far as "willing themselves to die," though -- I'd have been much more impressed with that possibility if the father had been completely healthy, said that to his wife, and died the next day.  I'm not trying to be insensitive, but an old person taking 3 years to die isn't very remarkable...    Peace.|`|sfRv5wY4aa	This could of been meant many different ways, we will all die some day,    but sometimes we can grieve ourselves to death ( grieving puts A lot of stress on our bodies )          This tells you how to become a Christian, and how to go to Heaven       John 9:31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.        John3:5     Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .        Acts 2:36-38    36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.     37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?     38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost|`|kEWknILEaa	I guess it depends on what one means by 'soon'.  Maybe when he gets to heaven (or wherever) his deceased wife will read him the riot act for being so late!|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I guess that people can will themselves to die. It is said often that when a spouse dies the other one soon follows. My grandmother died on the 6th anniversary of her husband's death. A neighbor of mine died 3 months after his wife. I guess the time is only relevant to the individual. I know if my husband died I would seriously have a hard time moving him on, I could see myself dying of a broken heart.    I don't know of an atheist who would say that since the ones I know beleive that death is final.

So:  if an atheist says, "George Bush, a Christian, says that "Waterboarding is not torture" all Christians are responsible for and accountable for what George Bush says?    This Christian happens to believe that waterboarding IS torture and that George Bush/Dick Cheney/Donald Rumsfeld and others in the Bush administration authorized the torturing of people.      Likewise, I doubt if you're going to find one atheist on this board who agrees with Dan Barker.|`|AA10578359	What atheist said that?

I do know that without belief in a higher power such as God, then there is no absolute authority to say that anything is wrong. It would mean get what you can when you can and only care for yourself. So without God rape is only bad to the person being raped. Since God does exist and is a rewarder of those that seek Him we know that rape is wrong and sinful because it would fall under fornication (sex outside of marriage).

Most likely, though: Dan Barker is a rapist.|`|KhJwOurLaa	A little context, maybe?|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	He was referring to instances in the Bible when God commanded his people to rape in His name.|`|WbaN6osZaa	I haven't a clue who he is.    And I feel sick reading Marj's 'answer'.|`|tjAW9raEaa	First, I, like Dan Barker, am a former minister turned atheist.  Second, the Bible says RAPE is NOT a sin!  See Deuteronomy chapter 22.  At the end of the chapter, it specifically says that if I rape a married woman, I get stoned because I committed adultery.  But if I rape a virgin, I must marry her, and pay the dad 50 shekels, and I can never divorce her.    Thus, according to the Bible, raping a virgin is NOT a sin.  The rape victim must marry the rapist, and God did not predict inflation, because 50 shekels today is a measily 10 bucks, back then it was a college education price, pretty much.    Dan Barker is right, most christians do not know or read their own bible enough before they ask questions, which only in the end show ignorance of scripture on their part.|`|79e9a287ff6eb2f7c6fd92bfd1a963caaa	Explanation: Dan Barker does not believe that rape is absolutely immoral.  Also, Dan Barker cannot distinguish between an adjective and an adverb.
2wUvFmrhaa	A big part of my leaving the LDS church is these statements and teachings.    Note, some LDS have not heard all the quotes.    About skin getting whiter it wasSPENCER W. KIMBALL HERE..Half way down, talkiing about indian converts.  http://nowscape.com/mormon/*****.htm      No matter how you look at it, racism is awful, but the Mormon church has taken it to a new level.     What makes Mormon church's racism so awful are the following two points.   1. They justified racism in the name of God.   2. They still refuse to apologize.    (they point the finger at other racist history)    Even the Southern Baptist church (which was founded on racism) has apologized. http://www.allianceofbaptists.org/racism...     QUOTES...    In the Mormon Sunday School publication, Juvenile Instructor, the following statement appeared:       We will first inquire into the results of the approbation or displeasure of God upon a people, starting with the belief that a black skin is a mark of the curse of Heaven placed upon some portions of mankind. Some, however, will argue that a black skin is not a curse, nor a white skin a blessing. In fact, some have been so foolish as to believe and say that a black skin is a blessing, and that the ***** is the finest type of a perfect man that exists on the earth; but to us such teachings are foolishness.     We understand that when God made man in his own image and pronounced him very good, that he made him white. We have no record of any of God's favored servants being of a black race...every angel who ever brought a message of God's mercy to man was beautiful to look upon, clad in the purest white and with a countenance bright as the noonday sun. (Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 3, page 157, October 15, 1868)    "Not only was Cain called upon to suffer, but because of his wickedness he became the father of an inferior race."     -Joseph Fielding Smith, The Way to Perfection, p. 101    "It was well understood by the early elders of the Church that the mark which was placed on Cain and which his posterity inherited was the black skin. The Book of Moses informs us that Cain and his descendants were black."     -Joseph Fielding Smith, The Way to Perfection, p. 107    "According to Brigham Young, Joseph Smith classified these people as "The seed of Cain. Young said the "Joseph Smith had declared that the Negroes were not neutral in heaven for all the spirits took sides, but `the posterity of Cain are black because he (Cain) committed murder. He killed Abel and God set a mark upon his posterity."     -Joseph Fielding Smith, The Improvement Era, ...    WHY BLACK SKIN???  "There is a reason why one man is born black and with other disadvantages, while another is born white with great advantage. The reason is that we once had an estate before we came here, and were obedient, more or less, to the laws that were given us there. Those who were faithful in all things there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less.... There were no neutrals in the war in heaven. All took sides either with Christ or with Satan. Every man had his agency there, and men receive rewards here based upon their actions there, just as they will receive rewards hereafter for deeds done in the body. The *****, evidently, is receiving the reward he merits."    Joseph Fielding SmithDoctrines of Salvation, Vol.1, pages 66-67      I believe there is record of only two blacks being ordained to the mormon priesthood (PH) pre 1978, one was Elijah Abel, and Abel's PH was eventually suspended, in Smith's lifetime.     The seeds of the black PH ban were laid by Joseph Smith. Young and many other mormon leaders kept up the racism and crazy teachings about it.

Some older past leaadewrs may have suggested or speculated on their own about this, but it was not then, nor now, offical dosctrine.     The doctrine can be found in our scriptures:  these are the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.  In these you will find the doctrine.    Anywhere else is the writings of people which is just that, their writings.    I think it really irriates non Mormons espcecially anti Mormons, when they come across some old writings, they think, "aha, I have you now" and try and formulate a bias against us.   However, old writings are just that.  Old writings and old opnions.  The doctrine is found within the scriptures.      You can find the doctrine here:  http://www.mormon.org and http://www.lds.org|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	The notion that blacks were "on the fence" has been official denounced by the church.

They can even call it doctrine - but unless the church officially accepts it as such - it is not.  This is not.

You have been presented with the most common anti-Mormon tactic.  And it's a dishonest one.  Take an obscure quote from a church leader.  Make sure it's something that never became official Mormon doctrine.  Then show it to the world and proclaim loudly "This is what Mormons believe!! (gasp!)"    That doesn't mean there wasn't any racism in the Mormon past, though, because it's obviously there.    Current Mormon leaders have apologized repeatedly for racist views of past leaders.  If you watch the documentary "Nobody Knows: The History of Black Mormons", it includes interviews with Martin Luther King III and Pastor Chip Murray where they both talk about meetings with the leaders of the church and how they feel like their apologies are sincere and sufficient.  http://www.untoldstoryofblackmormons.com    But of course, it's not sufficient for some of the anti-Mormons here because it's really important to these folks that it NOT be sufficient.  It CAN'T be sufficient because then what would they do?  That would take away one of their precious complaints, and they NEED to complain and whine about the Mormon church.    Of course, if you think oceanwoman is a better expert than MLK III on black civil rights when she says "They still refuse to apologize", then take her word for it.|`|jdRKZe18aa	That is absolutely NOT accurate in any way.  NOT everyone will be WHITE in heaven.............. Your notions are completely lacking in anything remotely close to true or accurate LDS Doctrine!  God loves diversity too obviously - look at our world.  And people aren't black, white, yellow or tan because of sin - it becomes a matter of genetics.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	That is not Mormon doctrine. :/    Oh. So now Desiree is the authority on how to answer properly? Ah ha! Ah ha!   Ah, Desiree, you make me smile. :]    I never said that there haven't been Mormons who have speculated on that idea.   But it is not, nor has it ever been, official doctrine of the LDS church.     There you go.  Will that suffice?|`|T5ztIAZbaa	I'm not black or Mormon but I do know a lot about it :)    They believe a combination of that and that being black was the curse that God placed on Cain for murdering Abel.

According to fairlds and their wiki this is the following information that we have according to the subject.     Blacks neutral in the "war in heaven"?    This idea was repudiated well before the priesthood ban was rescinded. President Brigham Young rejected it in an account recorded by Wilford Woodruff in 1869:     Lorenzo Young asked if the Spirits of Negroes were Nutral in Heaven. He said someone said Joseph Smith said they were. Presidet Young said No they were not. There was No Nutral spirits in Heaven at the time of the Rebelion. All took sides. He said if any one said that He Herd the Prophet Joseph Say that the spirits of the Blacks were Nutral in Heaven He would not Believe them for He herd Joseph Say to the Contrary. All spirits are pure that Come from the presence of God. The posterity of Cane are Black Because He Commit Murder. He killed Abel & God set a Mark upon his posterity But the spirits are pure that Enter their tabernacles & there will be a Chance for the redemption of all the Children of Adam Except the Sons of perdition  The First Presidency under Joseph F. Smith also rejected this idea:     there is no revelation, ancient or modern, neither is there any authoritative statement by any of the authorities of the Church  [in support of the idea] that the negroes are those who were neutral in heaven at the time of the great conflict or war, which resulted in the casting out of Lucifer and those who were led by him.    I hope this helps. Yes, I do realize that this comes from a Mormon Aplogetics website. However it has the information from past LDS leaders that explains our position.    Edit: p.hurlbut. That scripture comes from a similar circumstance. The Lamanites came into existance because the founders of that nation were planning to kill their brother and so God put a curse, a dark skin upon them for their actions.     God removed this curse from these Lamanites because they were in no way responsible for the actions of their ancestors. They chose to live righteously and so God removed the curse that was given to them.|`|AA10637643	WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT.    Not doctrine.

TOTFTdJRaa	The quote is actually to state what plato has said and the book the  animal farm makes of stating that if your in control your a person that must state things your not sure of and make choices that can seem brutal this is anyone and more often than not you find yourself lacking humility it's a idea of conflict and not entirely accurate but it has some truth to it|`|yOK32PM9aa	I guess Christians would say that the statement is false.  Most of them would prefer the word of the Bible to that of a second-rate British historian who produced just one memorable quote.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I just hate to see someone make an *** of themselves, publicly, and of such magnitude.     Lord Acton said that, he was an extremely devout Catholic all this life,  and he used God as an example of the right use of power,    WHAT A SAD PATHETIC PERSON YOU ARE !!!    "When he died in 1902, Lord Acton was considered one of the most learned people of his age, unmatched for the breadth, depth, and humanity of his knowledge. He has become famous to succeeding generations for his observation learned through many years of study and first-hand experiencethat power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Lord Acton, a loyal Catholic, made his famous observation while observing the deliberations of the First Vatican Council as it took up the question of Papal Infallibility.|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	The Christian doctrine on the nature of God is that God is holy, which is to say that there is no corruption in him.    The adage that power corrupts is a human philosophy, which tends to fall apart when applied to a concept that is beyond human nature.  The general idea is that God is beyond human comprehension and by nature is holy.|`|G15dXNlKaa	That quote sounds very catchy but I think in the real world that is not always true. There have been some outstanding leaders in history who had tons of power. There have also been some supremely corrupt people who had next to no power. I think there have definitely been people who have been corrupted by power but that is not an automatic result. The xtian god does not always exercise his power as evidenced by his refusal to end the evils of the world that openly oppose him so this proves that he has not been "corrupted" into exercising the power to make everything into his will.
JwAUeExQaa	Yeah, I like the idea of spending time with him doing what he loves, that's always good. After his surprise, go back to his, chill out?  It's nice that you haven't said 'i love you' yet that's going to make it so special - I wish I could resist from splurting out my feelings like you!  So yeah, once the day has ended, say it then. Don't be nervous!

WJZbpI9raa	Don't worry too much about how he kissed someone else- Poor guy probably never gave much thought to HOW he was kissing- he was probably thinking more about WHO he was kissing- and that was you!

Let the past be. The future is yours.|`|wLLzL8Traa	Deary just grin and bear it.

A dull or narrow-minded person, to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding, may be improved by tuition, even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned. But as such persons frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgment.Some people are like that they lie it is very common in us humans.But not everything that shines is gold as for there are a lot of good people out there that risk there lives for others,in this world that we are living anything and everything is possible so remember until we can find a cure for Stupidity we just have to live with them.|`|AA10929751	I don't get it either, to be honest.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	It explains one of the reasons why people become involved in religion.  My wife and I recently started going to church after we moved across the country just to meet some people, even though I'm an atheist.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	The Bible itself gives the reason (or what should be the reason) for gathering in meetings.    Hebrews 10:23, 24 and 25 say -    "Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to incite one another to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another , and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near."    Social interaction? Yes, but with a definite purpose. To encourage others, and to be encouraged to remain an active Christian and to share that hope with others publicly.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I enjoy going to church because I catch up with people I only see on Sunday's, especially in Sunday School. The Pastor gives 45 minute sermons which I like. He will give usually 2 verses and will explain how we can exercise the meaning of the verses to everyday life, sort of like how Jesus taught- using parables. My children also look forward to going to church as well. But, my 15 year old daughter has a crush on a new student in Sunday School and seems to be obsessed with him, but anyway I hope that she is learning something in Sunday School.;)|`|DDFgKxcaaa	10% of pretax income is a hefty price to pay for social interaction.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Yeah, I'm sure social reasons make up some of the reason that people perpetuate religious nonsense.|`|VIfKSTq1aa	that's how it has evolved, anyway|`|lh8Tn02Naa	There are the beginnings of several trains of thought here.  Needs more work, as they say.    The social interaction is a vital part of church-going, sure.  But there is or should be more to your religion than attending services.    The hook may be the story, crazy or not (some bits of it are crazier than others) but it might also be the music - which is what kept me in church at one vital period of my life - or some shared ritual.  For Catholics, obviously, it's the Mass.  Catholic preaching can sometimes be quite perfunctory, so you don't really "learn" much; everything is centred on taking part in the liturgy, the religious theatre if you will.    "If you talk in the middle of church, people get upset."  Not necessarily, it depends on the style and formality of the proceedings.  Some services are much more like showbiz than others.  You ever been to a black service?  Everyone talks, the whole time!  If I'm preaching I sometimes like to get a conversation going, then quieten people down when I get to the deep bit!    What your thoughts all point to is that religion has to be understood in terms of people's behavior in groups and crowds, at least as much as beliefs.  This would be the approach a social scientist would take, which is fine by me.  The fundies will hate it of course.|`|saDjgQkxaa	People have religion to have hope. I can see why a man who has been in jail for 30 years would be praying to a God. That's perfectly understandable to me. I just don't see why people in the real world who barely have any problems pray to a higher power.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	The purpose of religion is to control the population through a combination of guilt and threats from an imaginary being (often whilst extracting enormous sums of money from them)|`|TOTFTdJRaa	yes it explains that most people are not religious who go to church and rather are their for the social institution it offers as a fad or Fashion for organizing a social group|`|rb53GPZLaa	Part of religion is being part of a faith community-people who share common ideals and goals.

He does not want or need any thing from humans except that worship voluntarily.  He has the power to make all humans worship him as the Angels do.  He sent Prophets to teach humans how to worship him   The first prophet was our father Adam  But the humans forget, change & loose the correct way.  So GOD sent other prophets with the same message. There is only one GOD  Other prophets were sent as: Noah, Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Solomon, Jacob, Jesus and Mohamed.  Moses was sent by Torah  Jesus with the Bible  Mohamed with the Quran  All came with the same message as they are sent from the same GOD  There is only one GOD for the whole universe  The first couple of lines are just a chapter from QURAN|`|Om2xjC08aa	I think you're right on the money. Naturally, some go because they are very devout believers, but I think the average Joe go mainly for social reasons.|`|bNl7VlIEaa	likes attracts a like|`|sfRv5wY4aa	The purpose for the Chruch to meet is to worship God.    There is a big problem when someone thinks they need to be intetained when they are supose to be worshiping God.    And for those of you who think there is a certain amount of money you need to Give then you need to reread the new testament, since there is no set amount for Christian to Give.

John3:5     Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .        Acts 2:36-38    36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.     37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?     38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost|`|AA10712251	The propose of religion was to control the masses by giving the poor an distitute something to believe in.

To me, it's a day to share your love for your significant other and family and friends. You know just to make someone smile.  To me it's not just for lovers, it's for everyone who has love in their hearts, and want to share a little bit of it with people they know.  So enjoy your valentine day and tell someone you love them,  on valentines day tell someone how much you appreciate them, that always makes me feel good inside.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

LuN1unJ3aa	Unfortunately, your argument that you can't rely on "people on television to tell you that they've had an 'out of body' experience" is flawed by the "on television" part. Many, many credible physicians, particularly those who are in emergency wards of hospitals, have witnessed transformations of people who have claimed NDE and also witnessed the medical "death" of the person who came back from such an experience.    There have been books published on this and studies made of NDE claimants, resulting in the classification of such experiences. Do a Amazon book search on the subject "Life after Life" and look for Raymond Moody as the author. He is a physician who became interested in the phenomenon many (including he had observed) and has done a survey of people who had near death experiences. I've provided a link to one of his more recent books.    Good luck with your debate. It helps knowing some of the evidence for the other side so you won't make a major mistake in your own arguments.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Exactly.  No one knows.  But one can make an educated guess that in order to have "life", in order to have brain function, there must be a vessel, such as a brain, to support such functions.  Though many that subscribe to the alternative belief that somehow your body's essence (i.e., your "soul") holds all your thoughts and lives forever, it happens to be conveniently "invisible."  I can't disprove little green men live on an atom in interstellar space, or that there is not a alien teapot in orbit between Jupiter and Mars, but the same kind of common sense one would apply to such propositions goes right out the window when you question religious dicta.      We do understand much about how the brain works, how thoughts are transmitted through electrochemical impusles between neurons in the brain, what parts of the brain control motor functions, vision, etc.  So one has to ask, what part of "brain dead" don't people understand?  I do not begrude people their belief systems even though I reserve to right to consider them delusional, but when such belief systems cause so much violence, they are not only delusional, but dangerous.  This is why people, such as myself, feel compelled to speak out against wishful notions like eternal life.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead,how is it some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead neither has Christ been raised up.  But if Christ has not been raised up,our preaching is certainly in vain,and our faith is in vain.    Moreover we are also found false wittnesses   of God because we have borne witness against God,that he raised up the Christ,but whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up.  For if the dead are not to be raised up,then the Christ has not been raised up,further if Christ has not been raised up your faith is usless,you are yet in your sins.  also those who fell asleep in union with Christ perished.  If in this life only we have hoped in Christ we are of all men most to be pitied.    1 Corinthians 15:12-19  1Corinthians 15:20-26     Paul wrote these words but he was eyewittnes that the Christ had been raised up.

So maybe you should put something in there about that.|`|rLc1QeVbaa	"This is my opinion so if you don't like it then it's your problem"        lol, my my u seem a little defensive        anyway....like you said...nobody knows since the only people who do know are dead!!|`|MMImKRAgaa	I believe that the only out of body experience that can be proven is the one that you yourself has, other than that it takes a stretch of the mind to be others in their experiences|`|7SNe6SKTaa	On the other hand, No one knows that there is not "life after death". There is absolutely no scientific evidence to disprove "Life After Death" either. Kind of a stalemate.

I have had both, and I have never used drugs, and have not written any books on the subject, and don't stand to gain (materially) from the subject.  Just because frauds exist, doesn't mean every case is a fraud. That is the fallacy of the professional skeptic's reasoning.   Proving one case, or a hundred cases as fraud, doesn't mean all cases are frauds. Countless ppl are arrested each year for impersonating medical professionals or police, but that doesn't mean that doctors, or cops don't exist.|`|TOTFTdJRaa	Well most spiritual experience's are emotional concentrations of meditations that experience emotional metaphoric states the most common  understanding in a belief in a Deity or spirituality is that it has three elements a prima or nature of embodiment describing elements of metaphorical composition that comprise the Deity that exist in the nature this is a out of body expedience as any abstract idea is not a empirical verification now the second is a spiritual place encasing the spirit of what the place brings to mind the third is the full embodiment of the Deity this is used in all religions even Wicca and Shamanism Now as far as proving life after death well this is not possible because all elements of spirituality are abstract and their for not empirically verifiable but if your a verifications you can also through out the ideas of love and morality since we can in no way empirically verify their existence Now as far as life after death experiences I have to ask don't you ever dream this is actually the composite of how most religions view spirituality through dreams and visions and their interpretations and the meditative states in which a person can act as a medium between the two parallels Now if you think this is all insane look at artists like Picasso and see how they universally communicate this has been mainstream for a long time and perfected by artists of all types further evaluated by philosophers especially during the Renaissance Then also contemplate the idea of innate knowledge and laten wisdom and ability and tell me life does not exist after death|`|b7e2d313c9843c48b8664c2b0a6b7e76aa	There are those who make a big deal out of the fact that dead bodies are often marginally lighter than their living counterparts, and use it as evidence supporting the existence of the soul.    Then there are those who point out that one of the first things a dead body does is to crap itself, resulting in a slight loss of weight.    I guess you could summise this point as "the soul is crap".|`|rtFkwelQaa	There is one way to find out.  Study the Bible.  The Bible explains what happens after you die.  It tells who will have eternal life and who will have eternal death.|`|afripzVJaa	The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 9:5: "for the living are conscious that they will die, but as for the dead they are not conscious of anything at all". "For in the day of their passing, there thoughts do perish".     The bible agrees that there is NO AFTER LIFE.  But it does say a select 144,000 go to heaven  Revelation 14:1....  once you go to heaven as one of the 144,000 you don't come out... many of those "out-of-body" experiences are fake like u said.  you can't disprove that people can't go to heaven.... u can only prove it with God's word which has been proven scientifically accurate in many areas.

IVy35SE2aa	when you think about it, we have no records or events of his life for an 18 yr period.  A blackout.  Everybody thinks they know a lot about Jesus, but they mainly know what he was reputed to have said  in a three year time period.  And even that was not written down  for about 50 years and that probably was not written by anybody  that knew him.  He didn't die for a sacrifice and he didn't die for our sins.  He went through that experience to show that sin has no effect and death  is not real.|`|zHwlGhIAaa	your reasoning makes no sense to me.  granted you have the right to believe anything you want but your argument is flawed.  you say that Jesus did not give his life for everyone.  The Bible did not say Jesus was coming to give his life for those who believe in him it says that Jesus died so that we may have life and have life more abundantly.  God knew that people were going to be against Jesus and will continue to be against Jesus. So he did sacrifice his life for everyone.  He did not die for himself as he was only in flesh to be a living sacrifice.  And although he was resurrected, he was not resurrected to live some great life.  His only purpose of coming to earth in physical form was to spread the gospel and to die for our sins.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	Jesus gave His life for everyone. God offers everyone eternal life because He did.|`|GTjkWZPlaa	First all read your Bible before you make such statements.    True Christians are not self-rightious, but admit to being sinners.  Jesus was not self-rightious.  He always gave the glory to the Father, not himself.    As far as you considering Jesus' death not a sacrifice because he resurrected, again read your bible before making such a statement.  The means in which Jesus died was horrific physical torture (a sacrifice in itself).  Do research on flawging and crusifiction.  He also had the entire world's sin's place upon him as the sacrificial lamb, which was also torture.  You know the feeling of guilt you have when you have done something wrong.  Feels pretty terrible doesn't it (unless you are someone without a consious).  Imagine feeling that for the entire world = emotional torture.  So did Jesus sacrifice - absolutely!

Look what Paul said about women in church!|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	A practical answer from the Culture of the time.    She would not have been allowed intothe temple to teach and preach at age 33.    She would have had to have a father or brother accompany her in all her travels, as women could not be unaccompanied.    There was not public crucifixion of women.  It was acceptable to stone them to death in the public squre, but unacceptable to beat them, scorge them and rise them up naked on the cross to die of crucifixion.    Jesus Christ opened up the world of worship to women.  This is not studied much at all, but before Jesus Christ, women were allowed in the temple courtyards, but never into sermons or inner courts of the temples and synagogues.    Men had trouble with the concept of allowing women into church right from day one, and Paul spent much valuable time writing letters to these guys to help with the integration of women into worship houses and churches.  So, if Jesus had been female, there is no way a man would attend a church with a woman inside it, no matter what miracle she may have shown to them.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Well, according to many Christian faiths Jesus was both man and divine, as he was filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, Sophia, is female, so, in a sense, God did give a daughter too.|`|5eGE4AkLaa	Well, Jesus would be Jessica, lol. And we probably wouldnt have heard of her because women weren't taken seriously back then. Their probably would be no christianity.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	The Western World would be split between Judaism and Islam.|`|wnGpAVGFaa	It would be better!

BevylvVSaa	$1.00      The more relevant question is what is the max you can make living in the house of another (essential person rate) - $338.00.  Not enough to live on.    Cmouterpot: Please don't claim to know about SS benefits when you definitely don't. The current amount for an independent individual is $674, if you are living in the home of another it is $338. While they do take out some of your earnings - it is not 50% - the first $85.00 you make each month is yours free and clear, than for each $2.00 you make they take $1.00. So if you made $200.00 you would get to keep $142.50. And if you made $400 - you would keep $242.50.  You also cannot have more than $2,000 in assets except for a car and a place to live.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I believe it is like $653 or more|`|PvyYiy9baa	The Minimum is 5.00, yes, five dollars|`|bjPUEbsyaa	This shows your ignorance of the SSI program.  You should really research it more on your own.    Who are you living with  do they -or anyone else still claim you as a dependent  is it just a roommate situation  do you pay yur fair share?  is the person you live on SSI    Finanicial eligibiity is based on family income-including parents if you are a dependent or a spouse.    are you in a common law state--if you are living with someone of the opposite sex--they may consider you married for SSI purposes--you would need to ask about that-    and if you are considered married--their income will be held against you--and you may be financially disqualified all together      If you understood what SSI was-you should ask 'what is the maximum SSI benefit?'  which is about $650/month-    this info is available on the SSI website    this benefit is reduced if you earn any income through employment (unless if is only a few dollars)    for example--if you earn $200/month--they will reduce your benefit by $100    if you earn $400 they will reduce it by 200    ...and could be reduced all the way down to $1    I didn't know the exact amount offhand--that is why I referred to 'above a few dollars'    that amount is $85--so the reduction is based only on the amount over 85      It is something like $400 income-$85 allowable=$315--and your benefit would be reduced based on the 315--something like taking away 1 dollar for every 2 you earn (the 315)  EDIT__CHILI YOU MADE A MISTAKE__YOU DON"T KNOW IT ALL-    I DID SAY ABOUT 650 which indicates I wasn't giving the exact amount only a ball park figure-    I added teh link with the standrad amount 674    AND  I added a link that says it would be reduced up to 1/3 which would make teh payment 449.33-    NOT 338    AN ESSENTIAL PERSON is a perosn needed in a house to take care of teh diabled person-it is based on the pre SSI prgram that was in place in 1973    the 338 is the amount the essential person is eligible for--not the amount the SSI eligible individual would receive......
vuAD59egaa	In Christianity, we have a weekly Holy Day. It is on the seventh-day of the week.The Holy Bible calls that day "Sabbath."   It applies to all mankind. We are called to Keep the Sabbath day Holy.  Saturday,not Sunday.    Exodus 20:8-11
LJznhiLEaa	be discerning about who/what you answer, because we are warned not to get involved in foolish arguments, but to always be ready to give a reason for the hope you have in Christ.  Some people will not listen, but just want to argue.  Try to avoid those (though it's not always easy).  Instead, look for those who genuinely want to hear Truth, those who are close to the Gospel and open to Christ (even if they seem not to be).    And when you find those, sprinkle some salt.  you are the salt of the earth.  The Holy Spirit lives in you (if you are truly a born again Christian) and He will help bring to mind what to say.  Speak the truth in love - don't EVER give in to angry rebuttals or sharp dialogue.  That does nothing to help people see the Truth.    Don't worry about being deep though.  Study your scripture, but you'll never really know "enough".  Start with what you know.  Start now.|`|SZTm6mwmaa	The best thing you can do is share your own life experiences and what God has done for you personally. There are those who need someone who they can relate too.

Then obey ! Most of the time you will know more about stuff than the person reaching out for help. You can always look the answer up in the Bible. Find yourself a good on line bible where you can do searches of verses and other things up ! I actually have lots of computer bibles and books loaded on my computer for this reason.     It would help you also if you have a booklet or outline on how to lead someone to the Lord.

Easier said than done.  I would urge you to find a church in your area that offers BSF bible studies.  You will find these studies offered at a multitude of different denomination churches because the studies encompass all Christian worship styles while still holding fast and strong to biblical truths.    You will NOT find any Catholic churches hosting BSF, not sure why, as they seem to assert left and right that they are Christian around this forum.    By attending the BSF studies, it forced me to do my "homework" of reading and thinking about the questions at hand.  You cannot be a part of the discussion unless you have a written answer on your "homework".    There are seven separate years of studies in the BSF program, my personal favorite is Genesis.  All churches around the world are always on the same BSF lesson, so you could be traveling anywhere and still attend your BSF class in the town that you are in.    I am  not sure of website, but if you goole BSF in texas you will get the headquarters and be able to find local groups in your area.

People do not respond positively to that, unless they are vulnerable and 11 years old. If you want to send a good message to someone, have a desire to become their friend. Don't give your testimony within 5 minutes of talking to them.     And most importantly, do not threaten people with hell as a means of witnessing. Everyone knows about hell and god and Jesus. Most Americans know bible stories, how to be "saved", and about the day of judgment, so don't waste time telling them these things    Again, Jesus dined with people in their homes, was non-aggressive, non-threatening and gave them hope in a non-patronizing and non-condescending way.|`|si3eq11haa	you can start by asking God to help you answer in the right way. ask Him what He wants to say to each post. remember to listen to what He says. be kind and courteous. never be rude or demeaning. answer as honestly as you can and if you don't know something, either say so and just be encouraging or look it up in your bible. get a concordance to help. but remember, people don't want a barrage of scripture, they want someone to listen , someone to care, and some one to be honest. that's if they're being honest themselves and not just out to wind others up. well done and God bless. x
2pvtnd0gaa	Having the love with other people shows a glimpse of how he loves us,. mind you it is a very small glimpse...   God loves you unconditionally.  That is a hard concept to grasp. He loves you when you are good, and when you are bad, when you make wrong choices and right choices.   He wants a relationship with you, don't get freaked out its not weird, He is the creator of the heavens and earth and you, he is proud of you, he made you.  pray and talk to him, thank him and ask him about things, having God in your life is amazing.

It's more like a one way trip to hell. You have no right to take your life, because it belongs to God, and only He may take it.

tQsxsuNPaa	Sanctification = becoming holy or making holy  Justification = making excuses for something.|`|jdRKZe18aa	To me the difference is subtle but distinct.    We are justified - saved, forgiven - redeemed through the blood and atonement of Jesus Christ    We become sanctified through the Spirit of God through repentance and becoming perfected, also through Christ's infinite atonement & mercy.     Justification is the Gift  Sanctification is the process|`|3m00lxxuaa	To me theyboth sounded accurate to me, I'll say both have truth to them. The way I've been taught is that sanctification is basically the work in progress before you are completely purified, but yet, you are also set aside as well.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	I agree with your definitions. Another way I have heard it put is this, justification is the work of a moment and sanctification is the work of a lifetime.    edit: Wow, I actually agree with CJ.|`|JWjlyztBaa	Justification is God saving a sinner before Him by His grace.    Sanctification is another word for theosis, divinization or deification.      There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.    So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Justification is the work of a split second whereby we are saved and put back into a right relationship with God.    Sanctification is the work of a lifetime whereby we are conformed to His image.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Justification is a free gift only given by faith alone in Jesus without any of our own works added. Justification is salvation, and never includes sanctification.  Justification occurs in a split second when a person believes in Jesus alone for salvation, without adding any of their own works.  The perfect righteousness of Jesus is IMPUTED to the believer's account in heaven, while the believers sins were already poured out on Jesus on the cross.     Sanctification is a separate and not required for salvation process where the person is changed to be more like Jesus.     Both are by the Lord's grace.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	sanctification = cleansing from sin or state of being totally cleansed  jusfitication = being approved of God FOR becoming sanctified.     when a person says the sinners prayer and asks for forgiveness a man becomes justified immediately. but the sanctification process needs understanding to know what sin is and can the rest of one's life, but at the same time a few people come to understand how to forsake sin of all kinds. even before they die|`|si3eq11haa	justification is being made right with God  sanctification is being set apart for God,|`|mAjyNjV5aa	your answer questioner is spot on!  Don't let anyone else give you their strange version when yyou already have got it right!|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	CJ and Gail have it right.  Your second definition is pretty good, but it does not point out that sanctification is a "setting aside" work.
WsdFOGKMaa	YOU have NO moral obligation whatsoever.     Whoever is plotting against another is amoral to say the least and capable of evil that you are way out of your depth to try to halt.

And sometimes, just having a sounding board can let you look at your situation in a different light.  I too, enjoy YA, mostly for fun but I have also helped a girl find a job - from CV through to interview and she is still asking the odd question!  So it has a serious side as well.  We are all human beings regardless if we are next door to each other or just typing like this in the Internet.  I'm not sure about 'not wanting to be saved' - how does this manifest itself?

ICYHLdraaa	LOL what a question , well being a male myself , when under the influence of booze ,when were drunk we want to do anything and everything , i used to be like that when i had a girlfriend its the excitment of having sex with sum1 other than ur girlfriend and getting away with it , its that naughty mischievous feeling , hope this helps|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Well, like they say;    What's the difference between a straight guy and a gay guy?      A bottle of bourbon.        Unless he's a sailor, then it's just a six pack.    And of course you aren't gay either are you?        Edit.....      Your little troll giveaway was in calling women 'chicks', as well as the way that you use their periods as an excuse for supposedly not having sex with them. Gay men do not use women's periods as an excuse to not have sex with them, It is simply that we are not sexually attracted to them. And the only time we refer to women as 'chicks' is when we are around straight guys - 'chicks' is a straight term, not a gay one.|`|qIEhu6uxaa	Well he's definitely gay or bisexual.  I'm sorry but no straight guy would have sex with another guy, no matter how drunk he is unless he wanted to.  And he's only going to want to if he's gay or bisexual.    Just to add to your additional info...I think it's a little out there to call us disgusting.  Usually people of the gay community aren't so ignorant, so I hope you were joking.    *I TOTALLY AGREE WITH LIZ.  She said it all perfectly!|`|rLQjapibaa	Well i don't know why he wanted to, to begin with but i now why he continued.

And believe me, anal gets better after a couple times :P|`|JAqeuAjoaa	He did it because he wanted to be close to someone. Sometimes the boundaries of gender seem to shift when we're lonely; as is with all creatures of the Earth.     Don't read too much into it and make sure that you don't start haunting him for it. He will probably be confused and not sure of what he has done.  You did your part. Now, my advice is to let him be for a while.    Be Well.|`|4HClQObFaa	When I was in the navy I reckoned that at least half the other men would enjoy sex even though they would say they were straight and most of them had girlfriends.    I just can't understand how a girl could marry a man who was going to be away from home for weeks at a time.    I think the navy at least (but maybe all the armed forces) ought to recruit homosexuals selectively and refuse people with girlfriends.    So the simple answer to your question is that obviously he enjoyed it.    Just as gay men enjoy sex in gloryholes and so on when they can't tell the sex of their partner.    Some of it, you know, is a matter of attitude!      I was amused by your name. I used to know a Reverend whose initials were J R P. He's dead now!

Dead eggs come out of us? Where did you go to school? That's as immature as saying that you squirt tadpoles out of your dick.    First of all. If you took advantage of a drunk guy for sex then shame on you. If you were both smashed and he came onto you then he's probably closeted gay or bi. Of all people a gay person should know that you can never be sure of somebody's sexuality. People lie all the time about being straight.    Also, when you're that drunk, sex with anybody can feel good. Particularly when you can't see them. How many people wake up with an ugly **** next to them and can't believe they had sex with them? He might have been thinking that after he finished with you.    Edit: Seriously, "I think chicks are disgusting", that doesn't sound a little bit hateful to you? It's rude and insulting. Not being physically attracted to women doesn't constitute being repulsed by them. Either you're exaggerating because you want people to know just how "extremely" gay you are, or you're just being a rude jerk. Maybe both. lol, you even had to emphasise just how disgusting you think women are by adding "so gross" at the end, just to top it off.  I bet all of your women friends you find so great wouldn't be very happy with you saying that about their bodies.  What you said was rude. Yeah, you're entitled to your opinions, just like racist people are entitled to theirs, but, just like racists, nobody wants to hear your rude, irrational and immature opinions.

AA11923447	I am doubting my faith. I have been a devout Christian all my life and have always been extremely active in church, but there are many things about Christianity that are simply not adding up for me these days. I am sickened by people who use Christianity as an excuse for homophobia, misogyny and bigotry, and they seem to be growing in number every day. I do not accept my church's ban on birth control. I support the ordination of women. I do not accept Creationism or Biblical literalism. I do not understand the concept of a God who creates flawed beings, gives them some cartoonish notion of "free will", stands back while these beings make bad choices, refuses to give them any logical scientific proof of His existence, and then threatens to burn them forever for not believing in His son, for whom there is also not exactly an overabundance of empirical proof. I do not believe in a literal devil. I do not believe that people outside of my religion are damned to Hell. And there's a lot more. Some days, I feel very much like remaining a Christian, and other days, I'm about ready to hang it up. I am very torn by this, and have never experienced doubts on this level before. Still, as agonizing as it can be, I am regarding at it as a learning experience.|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	There is not one Christian who has never doubted their faith.

Talking about issues with a parent, trusted adult of the same religion, or even your priest works wonders.  I could break down in tears sometimes over feeling glad that I am the religion I am...lol I'm probably not making much sense.  But if you're going through a period of doubt, please, jsut keep muddling through it.  =]|`|5CoJZut4aa	I guess that all of us at one stage or another in our lives! Doubt is a natural part of faith. I doubt because I don't see Jesus in churches. Ii am burmed by the amount of time and energy we dont spend loving each other. I doubt when I see fellow Christians attack others for having different beliefs that they themselves aren't willing to consider because their traditions have been the same ever since they were young. I doubt when I see  suffering in the world and christians keeping all the wealth for themselves and investing in things that don't matter like $10.000 church signs. I doubt when I see people like Robert Mugabae who calls himself a Christian, but inflicts so much suffering on his people.  I doubt when I see that so many people are living better than I am, having everything that they ever wanted and I am stuck in ministry with nothing struggling to survive.     But then I remember:  Thats not all Christians hate each other. that there are some christains who obey the greatest commandment of love. Then I am reminded of people I know at bible college that are tolerant of other peoples beliefs and debate these beliefs respectfully, wihout attacking  but then I remember the people that I know who hold churches in bars, and cafes and bowling alleys and don't need $10,000 signs to spread the gospel. Then I remember the Christians leaders that we do have that make a difference to suffering because of their faith like Mother theresa. And finally I remember that God is the creator and owner of all things including money, and that its all temporary anyway!     Then I look through the bible and see the doubters that there were. Abraham, Moses, Jacob, Joseph, Gideon, Elisha, David, Jerimiah, Job. Not to mention the disciples , what a doubting lot they were! and remind myself that im allowed to doubt because i am human    Ahh I feel much more faithful now!    Peace|`|7cLYgf2raa	35 years and still going strong. because I believed IN MY HEART, and that can never be taken by whatever man or the devil can do to me.I remember when I didn't believe in my heart but only in my head, and their is a vast difference between the two.
TTfTTlcCaa	Think about your sexual feelings growing up, and what triggered them.  Don't force it.  It will come to you.  You don't have to decide now.  I know it's comforting to try to "label" yourself, but it's not necessary, and it's not helpful.  Yu are right on the edge of a very exciting time in your life, part of that includes your sexual awakening.  Keep your mind and your heart open.  You may surprise yourself.      EDIT  lol  I just realized I said exactly what your magazine articles have said.  I didn't mean the same thing, though.  I don't think you are "just experimenting" if you feel things and act on them.  Keep in mind that "wanting" to be bi because it's "alternative" or guys think it's hot is not the same as genuinely being bisexual.  Also realize that you will get a lot of flak from both gay and straight people who don't acknowledge that you don't have to pick a side.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	In recent years it has become 'fashionable' to be gay/bi. Which is a double edged sword, it makes it easier for people like me who have been out for many years, but sadly it encourages people to 'want to be gay/bi'   I would bother putting a label on yourself ever, or at least untill you are sure.

A woman can also be attracted to males sexually and females romantically but consider herself a lesbian.    Remember there is a difference between admiring the female figure or admiring another girls' body and wanting to have sex with her. You want to find someone who fufills you in all ways. If that "someone" is a man who encourages you to experiment with girls, fine. If that "someone" is a female who likes to add a man into the mix, fine.|`|1UtVRoFHaa	First you can call yourself anything you like, but it's all in the relationship you have.   If you date girls and guy and never have sex then you're in a none sexual relationship.   Now if you have sex with guys and girls then you can say you're "bisexual".   If you are in a relationship with a guy it will be a gay relationship and if it's a girl then it will be a straight relationship.   That you label yourself as bisexual is a way for others to know you'll have sex with guys and girls.|`|X8bbWEpfaa	seek thearapy.

You wouldn't want to go against a god now would you?|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	Well, as you stated yourself, you're a Catholic and attend church.  Therefore you understand (at least to a degree) what God's word to us says about sex.    For someone to be saved, they have to repent.  That means to recognize and turn from their sinful ways.  That is how someone becomes a Christian and a child of God.  We are not saved by works, but our works are evidence of what is really in our hearts - and evidence or whether or not Jesus is our Lord.    You state that you are bisexual - I suppose you mean that you have bisexual urges.  We all have sexual urges that if acted upon are sinful.  Temptation is not a sin, falling to the temptation is.  To live in that sinful way is evidence of the true condition of our salvation or lack thereof.    So, yes.  We need to love all people and treat them as we want to be treated - warned when we're about to pick up a hot-handled frying pan, warned when we're about to open a gate where a dangerous dog lives, etc.  That also includes warning sinners (and believers who don't understand) that God has standards and is loving, but also just.    I believe scripture, so I do react a certain way to gay people.  I see them as sinners in need of a savior.  In love, and obedience to God, I warn them.|`|UWKF7x4faa	I wish the religious were more like the gay community.

If the bible says that something is wrong then it IS wrong because it is God's Word. The bible clearly says that homosexuality is wrong, therefore it is NOT wrong for me to say that homosexuality is wrong.     By telling homosexuals that God hates their lifestyle I AM loving them because, if they do not change and obey God and behave in the natural way that God intended them to behave, they will spend eternity without Him.  I would be causing them harm by not making them aware of that.    Love does not always mean telling people that they are wonderful and that everything they do is right.Sometimes we have to correct and discipline people out of LOVE.|`|AA11521494	Firstly, there is no such thing as the gay community.  There are people who are gay, but apart from that we don't necessarily have anything else in common.    As a catholic I'm sure you know the bible as well as anyone - there are some references to homosexual sex, which is forbidden, but nothing about being homosexual.  Celibate homosexuality is surely biblical.    I can't answer your question as my own beliefs are not those of a traditional religion, but just wanted to acknowledge the question!|`|isZ8eb98aa	I do not have a problem whatsoever with the LGBT community.  I don't understand when people say that Gay people are sinning against God, or whatever.

As far as people whom are said to be Gay or have declared themselves gay. I really have nothing personal against them, for it is not me to condemn them, for it is between them and their creator whoever they declare, and that is as far as I care. As far as marriage, I say the more the merrier, for we need the moral decline that we hear preached if thats what it takes for Christ's return instead of rejection condemning ourselves as judges|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	If your religious does it affect the way you react to Gay people..?    Yes ..because God tells us that this is a sin .. and who does this must be punished ... also this is against the nature which God creates people on ..that the man and the woman only can be married to each other ... and the human beings must be above all the bad behaviours which mustn't be done ...    U say that God say      Yes ..but He doesn't mean to do sin with the others because u love this ... that means to be good to the others ...and if u love another one , and u see him (or her) do bad things ... u should treat him as u like him to treat u ... of course in this way , u would like to advise him to obey God and not to do bad things ... don't u ?|`|2u5m2MnTaa	on the gay 'community' - horrendous. i'm afraid to say. i am bisexual and all the gay people i've met as individuals are great people. but as a large group... horrendous. but that has nothing to do with sexual acts, but rather the way people behave in public.    i am catholic also, and i ignore the church's teaching on most sexual matters. on all other matters the church is reasonable and good. but on sex, the church is living in cuckooland i think.
1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	There are bible verses about 2 kinds of sin,   I can't recall the verse off hand, but it essentially says "if your brother's sin does not cause death, then say a prayer for him and he can be forgiven, BUT if his sin is the kind which causes death, then a prayer can not merely forgive it."    The Catholic faith differentiates sins which  harm our relationship with God and those that destroy it.  Mortal sins or "grave" sins are considered those which immediately separate us from God because they destroy the very foundation of our salvation.  Venial sins are those which over time, break us down and tempt us and errode our relationship with God.     Venial sins can be forgiven by saying a prayer to God.  Mortal or Grave sins can only be forgiven thru, prayer, penance, and being humble enough to admit them to a Priest.   Only thru the sacrament of Confession can your relationship with God be restored to how it was before hand.     For ANY kind of sin,  you must stop doing it to be sorry.      Examples of Venial sins are: lieing, dishonoring your parents, gossip, saying bad words, not paying your taxes, etc.     Examples of Mortal or sins of the body are: Pre-marital sex, stealing, murder, Pornography, Blasphemy against God, Physical abuse, Rape, etc.     Unfortunately, if you aren't sorry you had pre-marital sex (separate from your love of your child) and continue to do that, then you aren't really seeking forgiveness.    In either case,  I don't believe God is punishing you with infertility.    Make sure your Doctor checks for Poly Systic Ovarian Syndrome and Endometriosis.  ALSO if you were on birth control, then often times these have some lingering affect on the women's reproductive system.    I would caution you to look into the Church's view on Invitro Fertilization  if you are at all contemplating that as a next step.  My wife and myself have been trying for 7 years despite her having a severe case of endometriosis and we briefly contemplated Invirtro. -- Before realizing it is very similar to abortion.|`|c5b880da7d9196767dda343ec793570aaa	No.  It may be that you really can't have children.  Just be thankful for the one that you have!|`|cQUT6llpaa	well this is a hard question to answer. i would pray to God and ask for forgiveness.  i wouldn't say its really huge but is in the 10 commandments..|`|TSCfQTw3aa	There is no such thing as a small sin or a big sin. Sin is sin. God hates sin. But you believe in Christ! Christ's blood has covered us. Christ took our punishment (the punishment for sin is death). Maybe God is waiting for a reason, or maybe he's just waiting for you to trust in him. Maybe he wants you to stop worrying about a sin you have already been forgiven for, and start remembering the love of Jesus Christ when he erased your sins. Remember you can not be punished for something that God has already forgiven!!|`|1L1AxWoXaa	Oh sweetheart you are not being punished. I am an atheist but god is suppose to be a loving god not a spiteful god. Not to mention he is forgiving if that is what you believe. These things happen. It is so hard for you and your family but you will get through it. I have a friend that went through 6 invitros with out a baby. I am not going to lie it was heartbreaking but she made it through. You have a beautiful baby girl. Sometimes having another takes years. Be patient.|`|M6U7jVoQaa	Yes it is a sin. and a big Sin. but since the result is there, and the result is not culprit, but an innocent child, you have to love it.    a for your infertility, i don;t think that is a punishment, it could be purification, or test.  Follow medical advise, repent to GOD, and move on .. God is forgiving    btw, i am muslima, i can feel how a christian sister would feel in such situation.|`|Y5pi0E1naa	First of all, sin is sin. there is no great or small sin. it is all disobedience to God, and it is all forgiven.  If you have accepted God's gift of salvation, you are no longer held by the bonds of your sin, past, present or future.     As for punishment, I don't believe God punishes us, I believe he lets us deal with the consequences of our sin, but He does not punish you for your sin.  there is only one punishment, death (Rom. 3:23), but Jesus, in His love for you, took that punishment in your place.    I don't know why you can't have a baby now, but it's not because your first child was out of wedlock.|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	God sees no degree of sin.    Mat 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  Mat 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Mat 5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.    There is NOTHING we can do to completely keep the law. That is why Jesus had to do what He did.    It is not the individual sin which gives us a place in hell or punishment.(besides, God doesn't punish individual sins).  It's the turning down of the gift of the Cross which guarantees our spot in hell.    Whatever 'punishment' we receive in the here and now is not really punishment, but the consequences of our own actions.    Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Sin is sin. It is not measured in degree. I also believe that God does the creating in His time. You just didn't get married soon enough :-) As far another? Well in His time. Pray for it. He is not punishing you.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	All that matters is that you love your child and her father. God only knows whether you are married in his sight, but he loves you anyway.    You've noticed how many women who get pregnant before they're married never have another child, have you?  Because God's punishing them?  I don't think so, which means he isn't punishing you either.  Fertility treatments sometimes work, sometimes don't.  I'm not being flippant, but it really is the luck of the draw whether they work for you, but - here's hoping ....|`|rLc1QeVbaa	since you're catholic i wouldn't worry about what the church says about it.  they are too busy with those pesky little law suits!|`|xNaN3VkJaa	Sin is sin before the Lord. There is no HUGE sin and little sin. You can thank God for your daughter and repent of the sin. God took your sin into account when He made plans for your daughter, of course she is a gift from God. God is not punishing you by not giving you another child, but He may be leading you down a different road. It's OK to tell God what you would like, but at the same time, its better to pray for His will to be done. If it were me, I would pray, "Lord, you know how much I want to have another child, but if you don't give me another, I will still love you. I trust you and your plans for me and my family."|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Why are you worrying now ? It's a little late isn't it ?  Are you implying that you still haven't married and trying for number 2 ?   Children deserve a father and a mother and that requires commitment. If a couple is together "unless we have problems" then it is only a matter of time before they break up.  Why are you wondering about this now ? You didn't care what God or society thought before getting pregnant the first time and now wondering if God is "punishing you" when you are again doing what you want to do by having fertility treatments.  Have you considered that maybe it is God's will that you only have one ?  Have you prayed about that ? Or do you only pray after you do what you want to do and have problems ?

uKTVCuOXaa	But their isn't and if religion did not exist neither would the state and/or vice a versa it purposely keeps everyone divided and controlled.    I personally don't care if people have a belief system but they use it to dictate and justify how anothers harmless way of life should be, when theirs is really the issue.   Different cultures should be free to think what they like, its only the actions of forces that want to destroy them that do the harm. Like when the Catholics and Christians went to places like eg; Australia to abuse the Natives and convert their way of life, we all know an Aboriginal was a perfectly harmless hunter/gatherer now many of them are addicts, because of neglect and abuse. They have lost most of their land and way of life, since very few are free if at all, as someone will be controlling them and are told what land they can have.   If a persons culture is not to their liking and their regime is too strict for them to handle then they should seek someone they trust to help remove themselves from it. However if many people such as like an over-whelming majority of the population are not happy, then together they should over-throw the dictatorship by all means necessary.  Today this is not as easy because the dictators are so oppressive they have a gun to our head, and because they are realistically fronts for mafia run enterprises, US and Britain are the most extreme cases to name a few. They have too much power and should not be encouraged.   I hope this helps.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	I think Im in love!

AA11946812	Honey, there is no such thing as a vampire.  It's folklore, pure and simple.    While it's fun to read about these creatures - and many authors have written vampire stories over the years - it's still fiction.    You obviously have a pale complexion.  I'm guessing you're of northern European descent.  However, it could also be that you're anemic - that would explain the pallor, the coolness of your skin, and the circles under your eyes.    I would check with a doctor to make sure that you're getting enough iron.    And relax.  You're not a vampire.|`|64d77l4qaa	There's no such thing as vampires.    The people who claimed to be vampires and who told you you physically change into one are idiots.    You say you are chalk white.   How much sun do you get? Are you eating correctly? There are several nutritional deficiencies that can cause pale skin.    If your skin is cold and people have trouble getting a pulse, that would have something to do with poor circulation. You should go see your doctor if you haven't already been diagnosed with anything that can cause circulatory problems. Poor circulation can also result in pale skin.    Everyone can smell blood, and it smells exactly like how you described. It also tastes the same, as anyone who has ever had a cut mouth can tell you.    Your best bet is to go to your doctor for a blood test to determine if you have any mineral or vitamin deficiencies, or other conditions.     But you are not turning into a vampire.   Vampires are not real.    It's not even debatable, they simply don't exist. The only "vampires" around are foolish delusional individuals who wish they were one, so they start acting like one to live out that fantasy. My sister is extremely pale with constant bags under her eyes, yet she eats healthy as well. Just because you eat the proper foods that doesn't mean your body is able to absorb what it needs.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	ACK!! *covers jugular*|`|QWsnxVlYaa	same thing happened to me   its sooo freaky  and Im freaked out because I read twilight and same thing...  just if I was beatiful...|`|mTPRzkBaaa	Wow, um. Hmmph. I think you should talk to your doctor to see if he/she has ever heard of such a change. Then, look around online to see if there are any other symptoms you could expect. I hope you are okay! And if you are a vampire, it's not the end of the world. At least not for you...|`|WCFp0ODKaa	You just sound like you need to be out side more and get some Vitamin E Vampires are not real for proof walk out into the sun if dont poof into a pile of ashes then u are not a vampire|`|GuBF5xhDaa	You are not crazy, just misinformed. There is no such thing as an immortal vampire. Since you are having your puberty, I am willing to say your body is just changing. Nothing out of the ordinary. If you are worried, however, check with a doctor, and have them do a full check up. There are a lot of people with the same physical appearance as you. Check your heritage, and I'm sure it will match. As for the purple under your eyes, excessive salt intake is a likely culprit.

How then would one fulfill the law, but to abolish it as Christ did.  The law also says be perfect, but it can't make anyone perfect,  because the law is imperfect (wrongfully convicts) itself: faulty.  So going on unto perfection is as going on to grace void of law.  The grace (only) of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all.

Learning is good.    Not if the person who the statue represents believes in what the plaque states, then it is an extension of their depiction.    The intention of the Church and State Clause is not to restrict beliefs of public officials but just the opposite, to protect them. This a point that people who aren't religious mysteriously can't comprehend.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	"Do you think that symbols of faith shouldn't make any appearance in public places?"    If by "public" you mean taxpayer supported, then yes.    "What about in schools, if religion is talked about but never directly preached?"    Schools are not churches.  Religion doesn't belong there unless it's being taught in a history class, and only if ALL religions are treated equally.      "If a statue's plaque honors God, is the plaque a violation of the Establishment Clause?"    Depends on the statue, where it is, who paid for it and why.      "Does Barack Obama taking the Presidential Oath on the Bible violate church and state?"    No|`|A7mAUaxgaa	The fact of the matter is the United States was founded on a strong belief of God and the Christian religion and we have since (in order to accommodate immigrants and others) amended our Founding Father's guidelines to make exceptions for these people.  Since the government was founded on this belief of God all of these things should remain as they are.

But I hate listening to the same people who supported Bush and called us all Anti-American, now bashing Obama and telling us how this country is going straight to hell.

Sure the fundies are hilarious, when they're not being aggravating; but I've been to worship services in United Methodist Church in Baltimore, a black Pentecostal Church in Mississippi, Sunday School at a mega Baptist Church in Memphis, visited Washington Cathedral and dropped in at the Sojourners Community.  Riverside Church and the Cathedral of St John the Divine in Manhattan?  What's to laugh at in any of these things?     Sojourners in particular are awesome and I count it a privilege to have shaken Jim Wallis' hand.

g4nlUfmeaa	"Playing god" is usually a term people throw around when someone is doing something they don't understand, or that threatens to radically change the status quo.  It's a emotional appeal that sounds scary and condemning but has no real meaning.    If an omnipotent god does exist, then how are we dependent upon him?  The answer is that we are dependent upon him for EVERYTHING.  We literally could not do or say anything that allows us to become independent of him, so the accusation of "playing god" is utterly vacuous, because playing god is is impossible by definition.

Being an athlete you are fit and tone.  You have stretch marks because you are thin, and the skin stretches for your curves or your weight gain. When you are naked in front of him, he is not looking at your stretch marks, he is thinking, wow, there is a naked woman in front of me. when you look at him, do you stare at one patch of skin on his body, or do you take in the whole man?

ixFbNr4taa	Both men are involved in several conflicts throughout the story. Man versus man, man versus the gods, and man versus nature.  Both Odysseus and his son, Telemachus, must overcome very similar  hardships.     Both Odysseus & Telemachus struggle together and separately against the suitors.  Even when Telemachus travels to Sparta & Pylos - the suitors plot against him in case of his return to Ithaca.  Both men are attempting to aid the same woman, Penelope.  Both men serve as the agent of a God's will (Athena).  Athena is greatly against the  suitors & their abuse of the concept of Hospitality.. Athena greatly helps Telemachus and Odysseus plan how to defeat them. She even joins in the last battle while disguised as Mentor. Athena is against the suitors from the very beginning and gives Telemachus and his father advice on how to kill them whenever possible.  Odysseus has many battles against nature (the sea) while Telemachus does not suffer that fate.      Both men start out impatient and impulsive -- but in the end of each of their respective stories -- they have learned patience.

Regardless of whether you like it or not, there are clear reasons why abortion (a medical procedure) should _not_ be made illegal.    If a woman's life is endangered and she will die by carrying a child to term, it is a logical necessity to end the pregnancy and do everything possible to save the lives of both the mother and child.    By making abortion illegal, you are guilty of committing murder one (premeditated murder) by association of an innocent woman by basically condemning her to death if you do not allow an abortion to be performed.

According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitlers holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) So it will be when Jesus comes back a lot of the wrong Churches will loose ALL their CHILDREN The Jewish Messiah Jesus Christ will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed into believing that Jesus doesnt do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam can match Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new sins like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the newly elect President Obama honors the Most Reverend Pastor Dick Warren damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on! In fact, soon the Clergy will visit Obama to force him to comply with some popular Christian dogmas, or else he wont be re-elected!     Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they cant beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children to announce his expected return and at the same time teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political PRO-LIFE stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus REVELATION!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.    Im the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies!     Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Israel) --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.    That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to dash the infants against the rocks after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all!     Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and kill them in front of me.    I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say...!!! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today...!!!!    The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. Turning the other cheek is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6) The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in Gods Law Be fruitful and multiply, but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today dont pay attention to Jesus gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the Kingdom Sake. See Wikipedia castration. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!|`|bNl7VlIEaa	it wont happen, sadly|`|a7282602981644d2fff09b1a41ac653faa	Overthrow the government and introduce theocracy like in Iran.

G02cCLXJaa	Manifest Destiny was a term used to describe the belief of the American Government that God had given them the right to conquer the lands that were occupied by the Indian nations.    It was coined because Americans wanted access to the west coast. However the Indian nations occupied the land in between. It was hard to justify the massacre or movement of these nations on a purely humanitarian scale.    So they looked at the model of Israel. God had destined them to take the land away from the nations that had turned their backs on and sinned against God. In this action, the government found a reason to conquer.    If Indians were cursed by God for their lack of Christian faith and America was destined to great success then they had a right to eliminate all who stood in the way.    It was not the brightest moment in our nation's history.    I just read the source listed below. Every thing I have said is accurate. However, it appears the Puritans and particularly John Winthrop had a sense that God had destined them to convert the heathen in America.

I'm not saying that you need to just sit back and be passive and say that everything is okay with you.  However, you need to remember that God is God and you're not (something that I think we all could do well to remember).  We lose the message of Christ when we decide that we need to make people believe.  That's not what we're called to do.  We are called to be witnesses and to share what we know.  That doesn't mean beating anyone over the head with it.  It really concerns me when I see other Christians going full bore with messages of being "soldiers for Christ" and using this as a justification to steamroll over people.    I think that Micah 6:8 has some good advice for life,  "He has shown you what is good, oh man.  And what does the Lord require of you?  To do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."

If we walk in love, we are more cautious about how we approach even an antagonistic enemy.  And if we walk in love, we can look at atheists not as enemies, but as people who have chosen not to believe in God, people that we can show respect for despite our different choices.      Much of the church history is full of violence.  I believe that it was a church that strayed from the true meaning of the law, and that is to love one another.  There is no love in converting by the sword.  That is not apart of the Gospel that we follow.

A full examination of all the scriptures reveals some basic flaws in the "the Raptured will meet Christ and go to heaven with him" thinking.    From the wikipedia article (well worth reading, since it covers various views of the events called the rapture): "In 1957, John Walvoord, a theologian at Dallas Theological Seminary, authored a book,The Rapture Question, that gave theological support to the Pre-Tribulation rapture; this book eventually sold over 65,000 copies. In 1958, J. Dwight Pentecost authored another book supporting the Pre-Tribulation rapture, Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology, which sold 215,000 copies."    While I don't believe the article will answer your questions, the concept of "born again Christian" is that a person becomes without sin or at least will not be held accountable for any future sins they commit. I could be wrong, but that's the impression that I'm left with concerning that piece of man-made dogma.    But, it is a good question for those who believe that the "born again Christian" will be Raptured.

o9cAl8xhaa	The main problem is that the issue has been vastly over-inflated in the secular press, far disproportunate to the relatively small number of victims involved.  Children are far less likley to be molested by a Catholic priest than a teacher, coach, caretaker, relative, or aquaintance.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	they should have total openness about it and prosecution of the guilty ones, then people would believe that it was not being condoned|`|FGcwxZz0aa	The truth is that Catholic priests are less likely to be involved in sexual abuse that any other clergy, school teachers or family members. Most of the time the pedophile priests are just another excuse to attack Christ's Church. What most people do not realize is that the problems happened generations ago and most of these molesters are dead. But the Church has a no tolerance policy for molestations and helps any way we can in the prosecution of errant priests. Certainly they are not allowed to be in ministry. The Church has even compensated the victims without any proof of molestations so not to make errors. Many of the priests have been kept from defending themselves from allegations.    It is interesting that many of the Church's sharpest critics are the Baptists who have a current problem fifteen times as great as the Catholics in the past. The same is true for the Churches of Christ and of course the Jehovah Witnesses who have the greatest problem of all. It would seem that a lot of people are throwing stones who live in glass houses. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph

John 1"40-41      But Daniel refers to the "Anointed One" (Messiah in Hebrew) in his vision, and He is clearly talking about Christ:    " 25 "Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.'

The ancient Hebrews called this person a teacher, prophet and prince. Christians have added so much to the Old Testament to try to make it fit with thier false Gospels and New Testament when it really doesn't.|`|BAaf9NKdaa	The term "Messiah" comes from the Hebrew root verb "ma- shaha'   meaning "to smear"  and so to "anoint'  as to "chose".  The Hebrew word Ma-shi-ahh means "chosen one."  This word applied to many   men in the Hebrew scriptures. In the Christian Greek scriptures the  transliterated form Mes-si-as occurs in the Greek text at John 1; 41  with the explanation which means "Kris-tos" or Christ as in the chosen one of Almighty God.        The word "Messiah" was used by those men in the old testament that were  aware of Jehovah's arrangement in providing a seed or   anointed one who was to rule in the kingdom of his father and God.  This term applied to him (Jesus) and those chosen my God prior to his coming.   Once he arrived and was proclaimed the "Messiah" by baptism, being anointing, it applied to Jesus and Jesus alone since he was the first and the last.   When he approached John the baptizer the day after his being baptized in the Jordan, two of John's disciples followed him after hearing John proclaim him the son of God. After following a ways Jesus turned to them and ask, " What are you looking for" and they replied, " Rabbi", which means teacher, "where are you staying" and Jesus told the two to follow him and he would show them  and they stayed with him that day. The next day, Andrew, who had heard what John the baptizer said, and was one of the two that followed, went to his brother, Simon Peter and said, "we have found the    Messiah." which means when translated "Christ or Chosen One anointed" of Almighty God, Jehovah.  John 1; 35 thru 42.....        Hope this has been some help......

vJqPsEsWaa	My dear, if a homosexual is what you are & you have a problem accepting it, then you either have a problem accepting yourself, or you're living by the "social norm." The number of homosexuals should not matter, beacuse we are unique like everyone else. Only thing we have in common is our attraction toward the same gender. It's our right to be whatever we wanna be. You don't see heterosexuals running around asking us to accept them, do you? Until you learn to be comfortable in your own skin, you'll always feel "guilty."|`|e1GCbGrXaa	Look back in history. They thought less of women who worked and tried to think.

The guilt you feel can only be forgiven by you.     You cant hide from yourself, theres now where to hide.|`|kVTryKlBaa	I understand how you feel.   Now you may not like this, but in truth, the guilt you feel is not due to being 'unaccepted'.  You may like chicken and no one else at the table does, but you would not feel guilty due to it.    You may be the only one in your group to either drink or not drink, but once again you would not feel guilty over it.    You feel guilty because you have not hardened your heart to the point where it no longer feels the pull of truth.    I know know.  I am right there as well.  Sure you 'love' the pleasure that you feel when in the arms of the 'one' you want.  You feel the freedom and joy.  But all the while you know its, just not right.  There's no reason to get all upset and offended over me telling  you this.  I know.  I have dealt with those feelings for almost thirty years.    We can make any excuses we want to 'justify' our actions,  but our heart knows better.  Sure, if you ignore it long enough, if you numb your mind with enough drugs or alcohol you can live with it, or maybe not.   There a reason that the suicide rate is so high among us.  Yes I know they say its because we are unaccepted.  That's bull.  EVERYONE has something that is unacceptable, but it doesn't make people kill themselves.  Our guilt comes from the core root that we have accepted what we know is not right.  I have resisted the desire to 'be held' for many years.  I have had many lonely nights.   But I have, on occasion gave in, and I can say with all confidence, the loneliness ends, the guilt of given in goes on.    I am so sorry.  I mean you no insult,  I am right there with you.

Uhh...there is no one way...it isn't like american women and a european woman have sex differently...sex is just sex and that's all there is to it. Have you never had sex before or like, only with one person?    Each sexual experience is unique and where a person is from does not determine how sex is with that person.  I mean, perhaps cultural influences...like in arabic countries where women are always covered or like, are sexually suppressed... but the way you experience sex varies from person to person.

wLLzL8Traa	it seemed like he liked you at first, but you kept turning him down so you were sending him mixed signals.  you probably confused him and he did'nt know what to think so maybe he has moved on.  So now since he moved to a different store, maybe you can ask brandon to give him a message for you. or get his number from brandon. or give him your number.  So deep inside you really care about him. get in touch with him the best way you can.  good luck
3SbceHi3aa	You can't choose your sexuality, but you can choose your religion.  Become a transcendentalist.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	Oh wow! First, you are obviously a devout Muslim, so I won't go into the "does god exist" debate. So I'll address you assuming I'm a theist. If you believe god created you & you are very sure that you are a homosexual, then ask yourself: "Why did god make me gay but still said that it's a sin?" Second, the fact that you are depriving yourself from the simplest joys of loving, even the same gender aches me! 9 years! Man, that's torture! Third, you are saying that you'll most probably end up in hell, so why don't you enjoy your life & forget about all that religious BS? Fourth, you are not the culprit if you have been sexually abused as a child, you're the victim! Plus, you say that you are given a larger reward if you're gay & marry a woman. Doesn't this statement make you doubt the authenticity of any religion? And I though homosexuality is a sin!? Conradictions :/ However, I'm very proud of you for standing up to your parents, who by the way should be stripped of their parenthood, because you refused to live a lie by marrying another woman. I believe that you, especially as a Muslim, shouldn't have come out. But what's done is done, right? My advice to you is the following: stop therapy, cause you're paying money to tell a stranger your secrets :/ I dunno why people think that's a cure! And I want you to get all the religious restrictions out of your head & go out there & live your life the way you are, which am assuming should be simple if you're in the UK. I'm sorry, I couldn't address it in a more religously-sensitive manner; I'm an atheist. Anyway, good luck to you. Take care :)|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	They are showing more and more cases that people are born gay, so that is something you cannot help and was decided in the womb.  Did you know in some places in the middle east, women are just for childbirth and men are for pleasure(ie men hold hands and kissing)?  You are who you are because you are.|`|wxO3eatxaa	well the fact that you posted this question on the homosexuality forum and not the muslim one tells me what kind of answer you are looking for so there is probably no point for me to say anthing.     good luck.|`|FlhJxOl1aa	how did you know you have some years to life? being a guy with own admittance if facing reality Allah will not disown you. your faith in Allah is great. just do not do untoward things control your sexuality|`|ifdNUvwbaa	Right, let us get one point clear before we continue. Your not a British Asian. Your either Asian or British and not a combination of the both.    A British person is white and has traditional Christian beliefs. Since, your not white and are Muslim your not British but an immigrant.    Now to your issue. If your gay then there is nothing or no one that can do anything about it. You need to accept who you are. As for the religious element, Islam is a religion of destruction and death, so which seems worse.    Who will be punished?    Someone who likes someone of the same gender?  Or an evil, backstabbing religion causing global destruction and death because of its wild beliefs?    You should do the following:-    1. Abandon that disgustingly evil religion of yours.  2. Accept yourself for being Gay.  3. Enjoy your life!|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	Do you kill? Do you plunder? Do you worship the devil? If it's "NO" to all the questions, then you really shld not think so poorly of yourself. What is so bad in being a gay? You are born that way. It was not your choice. Remember that God creates us. So, if you are created in this likeness, then there is nothing bad about it, is there? If your family disowned you, then they surely does not deserve a good man like yourself. Most important thing is, be true to yourself. Do you think living alone without anyone in your life is going to make you happy? You wl feel the strain later. Take care, ok.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	Okay, first of all, you are gay and you will never become straight. Secondly, you are a devoted Muslim, and judging by how you phrased your question, you will stay a devoted Muslim until you die - you will not convert to any other religion or to atheism. You have also said that you think you're on the right path.    Then all I can say is: "Stay as you are now."  Be celibate. (Commit yourself to Allah instead of thinking about sex or sexuality in general.)  Follow your heart. (Following your heart is most important in everything you do!!!!!)    Good luck!    PS: MikeyD is right, you're the VICTIM of sexual abuse.

YuLAYK4Iaa	That's not how it is going to work.  Money is going to the individual states, & they can use it to stop further job loss instead of creating new jobs.

7fHsyHYraa	I do not support euthanasia.  You can dress it up any way you want to but it is still murder.|`|ogLHkR0oaa	Yes,after seeing friends and family dying lingering deaths. In one case the doctor gave a dear one an injection of morphine, an hour later they passed on, at peace at long last ! If I could be sure that the Doctor helped things along I would be forever grateful to him. My family are all aware of my views on this, I do not want to linger and undergo intense pain !|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No    Thou shalt not kill|`|jjt2enntaa	I don't believe in taking steps to directly kill someone.  BUT, i think people should have the right to take those steps to end their life with full knowledge of what they are doing.      I also firmly believe in allowing a natural death to occur.  I work with Dementia patients and too often I see families wanting feeding tubes, IV's, invasive procedures, etc. when to allow a natural occurring death to happen would be so much kinder and humane.  I think 100 years ago...even 50 years ago, before we had so many options to prolong a persons life, death was much more dignified.  I don't see any sense in artificailly prolonging someones death.    after reading many answers I get the sense there is a difference in what people are naming euthanasia.  My thought about euthanasia is someone makes a decision as to whether a person should live or die and if they decide that person should die, they kill them.  That is MUCH different than assissted suicide or not taking steps to prolong dying.|`|ToztjpAsaa	An ethical  minefield.  In spite of the completely valid arguments about  the humane treatment of people with debilitating, incurable disease, the opportunities for abuse, and the pressures that might be placed on the patients, are enormous.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	For me, no. Deu 5:17  Thou shalt not kill.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	No.  But I think people should be allowed to die.  What I mean is, people who are dying should not be hooked up to ventilators, feeding tubes, etc.|`|R534McNOaa	NO! is the simple answer, only a "Natural Death" where no life is taken by anyone, either the person nearing the end of their life or the "Carer", because it opens a can of worms to go down the "Euthanasia" Road!|`|G4vFjh0yaa	No  I too feel as MishMash does.   Only the individual themselves can define quality of life.   There are many variables here as to what types of support are given.  Having been one who sat at that bedside and held many hands during this process, I still firmly think it is not our decision. Keep them comfortable and cared for.  Just my opinion|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	You all have good points on each side of the question.I know the suffering is horrible and I have been in that position wanting to administer a good dose of morphine after all he was dying anyway.It is heart rendering and he did die 3 hours later.On the other hand I have strong religious convictions that lead me to leave our exit up to God.I did once ask a doctor to relieve my grandma's suffering with drugs not knowing once she went to sleep that would be it.She had emphysema and I hated seeing her suffer.So It is a hard situation.I hope I never walk in those shoes again. I don't believe in euthanasia as bad as I want to.I can't question God's reasons.|`|9RvOhmY1aa	I think if I was living in a vegetative state I would not want my life to go on, but who is to say if I would have no chance to come out of it.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Yes, for my mother-in-law. She was so horrible she needed to be put down. OK, give me TD, I can take it.   Poppy|`|2R3iJnFPaa	The individual should make that decision and the option should be available.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	I definitely support it.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	NO!|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I totally support it.  My Father is currently dying a horrible slow death... and will soon not recognize me due to dementia.  He currently lives in a world of his own, where all dead relatives are alive again.  Ghastly way to die.... we are kinder to our animals in relieving them of pain and suffering....yet we think it's ok to let humans suffer.|`|oP3VVW5raa	No.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Yes I do support it.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Yes, definitely. I 've seen too many people die a lingering death, suffering for no good reason. I hope that by the time I get to that stage (if I get to that stage), euthanasia will be legalised and I won't have to ask someone to break the law to help me. If a loved one asked me to help them in that way, I'd do it in a heartbeat.|`|fyrj50Braa	I totally support it, the vet tried to put my dog down because he thought he would have brain damage after a fit. I didn't and he's fine so why do humans have to suffer?|`|O9FojdEMaa	it's still murder same as abortion. i'm dead set against it only God has the right to take a life.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Not being a 'bible thumper' makes me see things in a wider spectrum in terms of life and death. If a person is terminally ill, or in agonizing pain with no cure in sight, and the person's life has come to the point that they are in perpetual agony, then euthanasia is by all means a good choice. We all have to die someday. Why make someone live as long as possible when their life is to them a living hell and death would give them peace and relief. It's just a short cut to the inevitable..........With out the pain and suffering.|`|1gsRGfJ1aa	I used to support it, however, not too long ago there was a discussion about this on a local radio show.    The problem is that people may feel pressured to agree to euthanasia.  It could be from a relative who wants money.  It could be from a relative who is tired of having to visit and show concern for a very ill loved one.   I am having a difficult time explaining the reasons, but it really made a lot of sense to not allow euthanasia.    I think the best thing is to have a living will.  If you are totally incapacitated and have to be fed through a tube and are being kept alive with machines, then all that support is removed and you are allowed to die with dignity.|`|XVZMXBwNaa	Sometimes they treat animals better than they treat humans.  The hospitals and doctors will drain you dry, financially, to keep you alive. If you are to ill to have a good quality of life, or your mind is not able to comprehend what is going on around you. I say pull the plug,|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	I say we have no say in how we're born, we earned a say in how we die.  In any unbearable situation it's dignity in choice.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I absolutely do support it and so does my friend.  I have just been diagnosed with a chronic lung disease and I dread the thought of fighting for my breath.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Yes indeed my friend! No Human should be allowed to suffer as much as others have. Peace.|`|JIATcwW6aa	As the daughter of a mother (and all her siblings) who had Alzheimer's, this is one area I've given a great deal of thought to.      Fortunately, my mother had all her advance directives in place.  2 weeks before she passed away, she was screaming to me (in the Alzheimer's Unit) to please let her die.  I told her I couldn't do that, to which she screamed, "then find someone who will."  As a retired director of the American Cancer Society, death was not a stranger to her.  She knew absolutely what she wanted, she did not want to suffer as her older siblings did.      So my answer is unequivocally, yes.  As long as the person has presence of mind and advance directives in place so that it is their wish and not someone else's wish.  I have no doubt that I will also suffer their demise and I pray to God that someone can end my life before I get to the stage where all my dignity has been robbed.    This is an appropriate question for me tonight, as it marks the 1 year anniversary of my mother's death.|`|35BLOIgOaa	no I do not   that word is one of the three thing that came out of what the nazi done in germany before and during the second world war if you Start letting the governments of the world decide who should  live and who should die it would start with incurable illness then after a few years it would some poor soul that's in a coma AND HEY PRESTO we would have an officially condoned Holocaust on our hands because we voted them into power you should never allow your feeling to get in the way of common Sense what you are saying that you condone legalised murder there is Always an alternative I am sorry but ido not believe in EUTHANASIA IN ANYWAY OR FORM  aly mac|`|7eLFBoSOaa	Yes. I totally support euthanasia. I'm not thinking only about myself in case I become ill, but  it would be terrible for the ones who love me .I wouldn't like to give them trouble.|`|h3eVtPNzaa	Yes i do , i would want to die. what is the point in living ? you cant really do anything and if your in constant pain all the time , what is the joy in that ?!  also it not only affects you but it affects everyone around you. you will have to depend on your family friends etc and they may have no life because they are looking after you. If that happend to me i would want to die i wouldnt want to stop my relitaves from having a proper life.    if someone hates life so much why make them do other things such as suicide becuase no- one will let them die. So they have to carry on being upset and hating life wouldnt you want them to stop suffering. i think the only person who can say they want to comitt euthansia should be the person needing it though.    it should be made legal in the UK!|`|oCMrcnu0aa	Yes, even from before my mum suffered a lingering, painful death from cancer.  She was virtually blind, nearly deaf, suffering with arthitis and diabetes even before cancer spread from her badder to her bones.  For her last months she was doubly incontinent, suffering dementia and was tortured by pain and by hallucinations.  Can you imagine anything more isolating and terrifying.  It would be illegal to keep an animal alive in those conditions.  Before she became ill, she always said she wouldn't want to live without dignity.  Sadly, that is exactly what was forced on her.  A civilised society would allow those who still had full mental capacity to express a wish for euthanasia and for that wish to be carried out when necessary.    Some will argue that life is a sacred gift but it is not.  I can refuse a gift whereas life is thrust upon us without choice.  It is not a gift of life but a life sentence.  Even those serving life get released when they've done their time.  Why not people we care about who are tormented and beyond recovery?    EDIT:  People in this position, like my mum was, are incapable of doing ANYTHING for themselves so the option to take personal action to end their life is impossible.  They need caring help.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	I certainly support it.    If the mentally-capable human chooses death then who are we to prevent him/her from it? Who are we to decide that they must suffer? who are we to decide their life?    In case of people with dementia or other metal illnesses, I think they can chose what they wish later on in their life in the early stages of their illness, because then they are still mentally capable.|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	For you and others, yes.    For me, no.|`|tCxUEartaa	Some brutish people advocate euthanasia.

LgYRrucuaa	AT your age you should not be stressing over that. Wait until your later teens then think about it again, at this point in time you should be thinking about school, family and other usual teenage stuff, leave the intense emotional stuff til you are old enough to cope with it.  Persepctive and understanding yourself improves as you get older.|`|56cff59988c261d32f8f72f598469ba2aa	Well if your not bi, then you don't want to sleep with a woman once your old enough to do so. If you want to have kids and marry a woman, you either have to sleep with her to have kids or adopt.  Well you could always use a turkey baster. You either have to accept it that your gay or go bi to be with a woman and marry and have kids. Your going to have to be honest with the woman. I think you have plenty of years ahead of you before you have to decide what you want. Go out and date when your old enough with woman and men. Experiment, but be safe and see what you like.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	Don't worry too much on it and follow your heart. Having kids and marrying is an issue for later when you're older.|`|UT9UfrRcaa	your 13 its to young to worry about it but if u are worried this is how u find out  suck a **** then eat a *****   if u like both u are bi   **** u r gay   ***** u are straight|`|NMi1AZbqaa	Well no one can really tell you if your gay or not, and it seems although you've made up your mind.    It's normal to want to have what everyone else has, but there are ways to have kids with your gay partner. Don't stress, you'll be happier if you don't.    Hope this helped.|`|px2TpM9qaa	? you like guys but you want girls you are bi or you don't know what you want in that case just take a break from all sexual desires and wait a while|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Well, than you already have your answer|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Just because you want to marry a women and want to have kids doesnt make you a straight person, it makes you want to be like everyone else. Most gay people want to get married and have kids. If i had a choice I would marry a women and have children too, but it doesnt matter, because at the end of the day...Im still gay|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Ummm... welll... go straight then.  We're not in charge of your personal life!  :]|`|r9s0VyJgaa	You already know you're gay.  So your question is silly.    If you know you're gay and definitely not bi, that means you have NO sexual or romantic feelings for girls or women.  Therefore, if you marry a woman, you'll be living a lie, because you won't love her the way she wants, needs and deserves to be loved.  You'd only be using her for your own selfish interests, and make her miserably unhappy.  You'll be miserably unhappy, too -- because you won't be with a man the way you really want to be.     If you want to marry and have kids, there's no reason why you can't simply marry the man of your dreams.  Its currently legal in 2 states, and civil unions are legal in several other states - and by the time you're ready to marry, same-sex marriage will have become legal in several other states.  Then you can adopt children, or find a surrogate mother willing to bear your child.     You can be gay and still have everything you want in life.  Don't sell yourself short or make some innocent woman miserable.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Well do you find women attractive?  Or men??    Could you see yourself spending the rest of your like with a man?? Or does it have to be a women?  You can still marry, and adopt kids and stuff|`|u8CFwtyMaa	There were times when I was 13 that I was convinced I was gay, but as I got older, I began to get feelings for girls as well as guys, and I eventually discovered that I am bi.  I'm now happily married with 2 great kids, and although I still find guys attractive, I have been 100% faithful to my wife.  You may well find yourself following the same path, your outlook on life will change during puberty, maybe several times, but it's what you are at the end that you have to live your life as.  Don't rush into deciding your life just yet, live a bit, have fun with friends of both sexes, and see who you are most comfortable with.  Good luck, and I hope this helps you.|`|R2mNsqSHaa	well there seems to be a lot of gay marriages and gays adopting now, not a problem for me, but, if you want children, yu seriously have to conisder that childs life.

I also believe that 13 may be pushing the limit for when you make up your mind but that is just my opinion.    Get a girlfriend and see how it goes. You might learn something about yourself. If you are still only attracted to men, just marry a man when you're older and adopt a child with him.    Just because it's not the same future that you envision doesn't mean it can't be perfect in its own special way. Hope remains.    Be Well.|`|4HClQObFaa	What rot! At 13 you just cannot know what your sexuality will turn out to be. You can't control it and you can't choose.     So you might be bi.    And you say you have been gay but all you can tell for sure is who you love and there is no knowing whether the sex of the person you will love next will be the same as the last one or different.    Lots of people grow up and get married and have children before they realise they are gay and it may happen when they fall in love with a person of the same sex and that is a very difficult situation for the married couple.    And there are a great many gay men who are happily married (I mean to a woman) and I am one of them. And bringing up children is the most important thing anyone ever does, gay or straight or bi.    Maybe it is hard to see, from the perspective of a 13 year old, just how that can happen. Please just accept for the moment that it can.

I went to my first concert the other day to see the Jonas Brothers, and when they came out on the stage, I am like yeah I am defiantly straight. But yeah, it may just be a phase or you might be gay, either way it doesn't matter and good luck

Physically this universe is one: there is no difference between the sun and you. The scientist will tell you it is only a fiction to say the contrary. There is no real difference between the table and me: the table is one point in the mass of matter, and I another point. Each form represents, as it were, one whirlpool in the infinite ocean of matter, of which not one is constant. Just as in a rushing stream there may be millions of whirlpools, the water in each of which is different every moment, turning round and round for a few seconds, and then passing out, replaced by a fresh quantity, so the whole universe is one constantly changing mass of matter, in which all forms of existence are so many whirlpools. A mass of matter enters into one whirlpool, say a human body, stays there for a period, becomes changed, and goes out into another, say an animal body this time, from which again after a few years, it enters into another whirlpool, called a lump of mineral. It is a constant change.     Not one body is constant. There is no such thing as my body, or your body, except in words. Of the one huge mass of matter, one point is called a moon, another a sun, another a man, another the earth, another a plant, another a mineral. Not one is constant, but everything is changing, matter eternally concreting and disintegrating.|`|gsWha0wTaa	See  below|`|525bf6ca8430a6de68b5b4e9508476d2aa	You    Me...    People!!!
bWl17S3waa	i think that that is a fantastic idea and im sure she will love it too. we girls love the idea of homemade gifts and the fact that u r giving multiple handmade thngs show u really love her|`|BJERgbM5aa	Sounds very nice and from your heart.  She's going to say "Oh, how sweet".  BUT, that's the end of it.  If any one asks her if she got anything from you, she'll just say "oh, he sent me some personal stuff".  BUT, send her a dozen roses, she'll talk about it for months.  Why?  Flowers, real flowers, especially roses, ALWAYS work.|`|6lmFyr2maa	aww bless id really like something like that its a present that money cant buy, maybe you could write a message on one of the cards that says i" cant wait to take you out to dinner when we next see each other". kind of like 2nd part of the present.    shes one lucky girl!    xxx|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	That sounds sweet. She will appreciate the thought you put into it rather than just going out and buying the first thing you've found. You can't put a price on love. I love the fake rose! it puts the point across that you will love her forever!|`|VvUxR6qRaa	sounds really sweet!  i would love to recieve something that well thought out.  happy v day to you both, good luck with the relationship mate.|`|nM8tyaUyaa	no its not cheap.If i were to get such a gift i would like it very very much.It will be a wonderful gift to show your love, and the wonderful times you have spent together.Infact i am also planning something like this for my valentine. All the best. I think your valentine will be happiest to get such a sweet gift and having such a caring boyfriend.|`|DO7lDtqxaa	I would think you are the most romantic guy in the world!!...... Could you give my husband some tips?(lol) You have proven to me you care enough to take the time to make her feel loved and thought of.Love is the most precious thing.

I love when guys are men enough to be cheesy.|`|9fWdey5baa	if i were your girlfriend i will love you much more. and i will hug you big time. that may look cheesy but surly it'll melt her heart.|`|JwAUeExQaa	It doesn't matter about it being cheap - it's really cute! And as you're currently in a long distance relationship a little selection of things is really really nice.   But I think on the rose you should just put, 'I love you until it dies' - short and sweet.  I think she'd prefer that any day to a expensive pretty necklace. After all, with the distance that's between you she's going to be missing you and these are some really nice things that can remind her of you and allow her to reflect a little.  Good luck! :)|`|wLLzL8Traa	I like all your ideas are good ones and it sounds like you really care and to me that really is what Valentines Day is all about.  Showing people that you care about them and that you appreciate them and that is just what you are doing.  It would be nice if people could act warm and friendly everyday.  But having one special day is good, I believe it brings out the best in people. too bad it's just one day. I hope your day is very special, because you sound like such a good caring person. and also thoughtful. Have fun and enjoy.|`|AcKNABixaa	That's very cute gift, and personal, everything from ur heart...i would be very happy if i would get it...dont forget that u are the biggest gift for her...and let her feel that she for u too...good luck to both to u...
FmazIF6Maa	Patron/Matron are basically the same thing.     There's no one way to find your Patron Goddess. Sometimes you just feel drawn to one very strongly for a period of time because you need Her energy. Sometimes one will come to come to you, in a dream, or meditation, or through some undeniable signs.    It doesn't even have to be permanent, it could be for a few years during one period of your life, and then you grow and change and enter a new cycle and a different Goddess comes calling.    And don't forget Patron Gods... I had a friend who was a Witch for over 20 year; in the beginning she worshipped the Goddess almost exclusively, until she got a very clear calling to be a Priestess of Herne.    I agree with Devo though; you don't need to rush it or force it or go on a search for your Patron Goddess. It is something that will come naturally.|`|UxooffHZaa	Meditate. Dream. Write down bits and pieces, and eventually you'll know just who it is.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Research the goddesses of many cultures, and find a culture that feels right to you.  For example, I found my matron goddess by reading up on Greek mythology, and I found Athena, and I liked what she represented.  Then later on I found Durga, from Hindu mythology, and added her as another favorite.    Some of my friends prefer Hekate, the goddess of witchcraft, as their matron goddess.  Others, Gaia, also known as mother earth.  It all depends on who or what you are comfortable with calling your goddess.  Some don't even worship deities in their craft.  There are even people who do not practice magic and only worship the goddess.    You could try meditating to see where you should look next.    (Matron is a feminine version of patron.)|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, it depends on what school of thought you subscribe to.   Some people will tell you that you'll feel a pull to a certain goddess or pantheon, and that you should pick based off of what your gut tells you is right or good.   The other school of thought says that you should wait until your god or goddess comes to you- either through vision, meditation, or a dream. I personally picked my deity because he came to me in multiple dreams. I feel that this version is most accurate.   If you're new to the craft, I'd tell you to wait. You don't have to have a patron deity right off the bat. It'll come to you in time- who you should follow.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	If you research the Goddesses of different pantheons until one seems to catch your attention more often that's one way.  Another way is to just practice your faith.  If you have a patron Goddess, She will make Herself known to you.  Now, doing it this way doesn't mean you aren't also researching.  You are, but for a different reason.  You are researching in order to design your rituals (which Goddess and God fit the need), or just because you enjoy reading about the different cultures.|`|Y0V5qH7Waa	i once worshiped selene the greek goddess of the moon i was drawn to the moon and it controlled my emotions so for me it was easy to find my goddess    just meditate on it
yBZlTzWLaa	LOL No, but I will now.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	No|`|uD1UFdRsaa	Why'd you have to be soooo hetro. Geez.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	Yeah, all the time.  I say it when I want to point out that something is lame, pointless, boring, poor taste etc    In fact, I use it instead of most negative words.|`|80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	Yes I do, but never with a negative feeling. I believe that "That's so gay" is not a  bad phrase if you use it to compare something with such a lifestyle without criticism. So, I use both phrases according to the case.    This question is so gay!|`|FpMS47sXaa	no, gay people are more imaginative than to use some label as a way to call something stupid or silly.|`|t8WpznW4aa	I do sometimes just because people say thats so gay|`|RSv2E2KNaa	lol no.|`|6pjmQ4d7aa	I say it loads!!    My friend also says it to me as she uses 'thats/you are so gay' as an offence to others but when she said it to me I would say I know i am and so she changed it for me.    Now when I annoy her she says 'your so straight!!!!)|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	More people should. It makes straight people feel the way we feel when they say "you're so gay"|`|1LxK1Grcaa	No....I say "that's gay"  just like all you straight people.  OMG were almost the same, haha|`|iysNEtBnaa	I do|`|ZaX48XpDaa	No, not the way "That's so gay" has been used.    Just a little note on the side though, a lot of people who say that "Hey, that's *so* gay", are often not homophobic, and does not mean to be insulting gay people. It's just that the phrase is so embedded into the community, and we haven't shook it off yet.|`|yJHu9Mdlaa	naaah .......... it is not fashionable. *gives a grin*|`|Ox9PAq9Saa	i do after someone says that's so gay... just to prove a point
vUh11UXxaa	Well  if he plays guitar you could get him a cute little heart shaped guitar pick. I'm pretty sure he must have something planned out for you so in the end if you dont have anything for him you'll feel guilty. Get him like a little toy or something. Guys usually dont get toys and he'll find it humerous at first but it's something that he can look at and think of you. It'll make him smile. Dont worry about if it's not good enough becuase it is! xox Hope it goes well!|`|wLLzL8Traa	Just write him a letter and tell him how you feel about him and decorate it with a picture  and valentine decorations on it. just a little something to let him know you care.  Happy Valentines day to you both.|`|JwAUeExQaa	Then just simply get him a valentine's card and write a cute message in it, just a few feelings or something?  That way you don't need to go out and buy him anything but you're still making a point that it's valentine's day.
KWhKwgsSaa	http://fashion.about.com/od/specialoccas...    Question: What to Wear to the Opera    Answer: There usually isn't a dress code for attending the opera, unless you're attending opening night, which is when the big arts patrons dress to the nines. In a sophisticated metropolitan city, there will likely be people more dressed up than other parts of the country. I'd suggest you do what most of us do when in doubt -- go for the little black dress. If you have something sleeveless or short sleeve, just add a shawl, wear your hair and makeup just a little more special than usual and choose appropriately dressy shoes and handbag. If it's like most events, you'll see people wearing everything from jeans to tuxes.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	i wear my long floaty black skirt with a black lace camisole and a couchet cardigan on top. Managed to get away with wearing my black PVC Doc Martins! haha    Wow i love the opera. Last one I went to was Die Fledermaus, loved it!
7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	CNY is a cultural event that mark the turn of the Lunar calendar. Its a new year, as the name implies. Chinese has a cultural way of celebrating the turn of a new year.    Of course Taoism may have certain thing that is related to CNY, but its not because its a CNY event, its because its a new year in the lunar calender. But this is a different discussion    CNY itself is to celebrate the new year, it is traditionally a cultural event. They have their own ways of celebrating the new year, such as visiting relatives and friends, having reunion dinner on CNY eve, giving off money in red packet as a symbol of good fortune.    But theres nothing religious to all that, all chinese celebrate it, Christians, Buddhist, Taosim, even Islamic if their religion allows, I don't know about Islam.     Its a cultural celebration, nothing religious.|`|AA12158034	The Chinese New Year is also called /, the Spring Festival. We celebrate it because it is the coming of the spring and the new year in the lunar calender. We welcome the new year and bid goodbye to the past year.    There are several traditional Chinese folklores about why we celebrate the Chinese New Year, and here is the most popular one:    Once there was a monster named Nian (, meaning "year". In other versions it's called Xi, meaning "sunset"). It sleeped in the ocean for 364 years, but on the 365th day of the year, it would get up to near-by villages to eat people. The village mayor would evacuate the villagers before the 365th day.       One year an old beggar came to the village and found everyone gone except old Mrs. Ding, whose son was eaten by Nian in the previous year. She was sharpening her knife, hoping to avenge her son. The old beggar told her that he knew how to get rid of Nian. He told her to prepare some red clothings, some red paper and some dumplings so that they can celebrate getting rid of the monster. The old beggar then posted the red paper on the doors, put on the red clothings and began to burn his bamboo walking stick.       When Nian approached, it heard some creepy cutting sounds (of Mrs. Ding who was preparing the filling of the dumplings) and piercing sounds. When it saw the red paper on the door and the red clothing on the old beggar, it ran immediately back to the ocean and never dared to come out again because the reverbrating red light from the paper and the clothing made it unable to open its eyes. When the dumplings were ready, Mrs. Ding found the old beggar gone and realised that he was indeed a Xian (, immortal with maigcal power and great virtue).      The villagers were suprised to find Mrs. Ding still alive, and Mrs. Ding shared what she and the old beggar did, and this is the origin of posting , red paper with graces, and wearing new clothes on Chinese New Year's Eve. And from that day on, the 365th day of the year is called  (the day to get rid of Xi) and with the following days of celebrations it's called  (passing of Nian/passing of the old year).
LuN1unJ3aa	Conflict is at the heart of a good story. Therefore, even C.S. Lewis wrote of dark forces in his Chronicles of Narnia stories.    To dwell on such, though, to the exclusion of the positive side of life, can be destructive to those prone to depression.    My advice is to avoid such.|`|kjAQj3i7aa	Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it. They are stories and I don't think that writing them is any way incompatible with Christian beliefs. As for the people who try to tell you you're going to Hell, I'm afraid you are just going to have to ignore them - if they believe you are going to Hell for that, I doubt they would listen to reason. Any author is going to be faced with criticism for all sorts of things - you just have to take them with a pinch of salt. I for one certainly don't think there is a special place in Hell reserved for the fantasy writers! Good luck in your writing career! :)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You might want to get the long Anne Rice interview from Focus on the Family.

This would require the Christian to have dark thoughts to write such a story. Dark thoughts cannot exist alongside the Holy Spirit because they are evil thoughts.    A person doing this could not be a real Christian, but only a professing false Christian.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Well, Dark is a relative term.  Have you looked into Frank Peretti's stuff?  He is a wonderful example of how you can write fantasy type, dark things.  If you look though, his work has a point.  It has "take-a-way value.  As Christians, we need to read our Bibles, so we can see what God has to say about things, we need to pray, so we can hear what God has to say about things, and we need counsel, so we can make sure we are hearing things correctly.  So, instead of asking a group of unknown people the answer, go do those things I just suggested.  And talk to your parents and pastor...candidly, before moving on.  Dark really is a relative term.|`|h21PoIcraa	Writing about loss, sadness, turmoil does not change how you feel about God and you believing in Jesus. Unless you write porn stories and poems I highly doubt it will change your relationship with God.

And if that doesn work .. lol ..    Go into profile and  click on the question you asked, sometimes YOU cant see it yourself but there will already be several answers !

TinNG7k7aa	Religion = Stupid sandbox politics + the "not from my tribe" syndrome. Religious people claim they worship God but they're just worshipping their own religion and traditions as a god.    Bring on the thumbs-down, you know I'm right!|`|HG5Smxkjaa	Where in this person's post did they proclaim to be a Christian?  You yourself are being rather petty for pointing fingers....|`|wuPTBIIuaa	if a christian is not a true disciple of christ, it is because they are either servants of mammon and work for a paycheck or they do not take up their cross, even until death. they go through the motions and thump their chest and say I am a christian, no one else is saved!   it is very possible that everyone of these types is a carnal and a worldly christian.   but you have to add leadership into that too    secret combinations is a book of mormon term and priestcrafts is a greater example of christianity today than even the mormons themselves are guilty of     just my opinon, but i have to admit that many christians are spiritual according to "their" understanding" NOT everyone is born a saint nor are they all True apostles with miracles and signs following.|`|UcH6NZYRaa	What scares me is that you think every Christian is like the ones you don't like.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Hey, you.

N4ORX2fZaa	To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.     II Corinthians 10:16    Being boast-full about your assumed destination does not exhibit the Fruit of the Spirit.      Gal 5:22-26  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.     Please ask yourself this....  Does the fruit you display on YA reflect the fruit of the spirit and does it edify the thoughts or spirit of those who are reading your comments?  Do your words bring conviction to those who need the Lord or do they push them away through judge mental and flippant comments?    Just think about it a little.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Well, now, aren't you a sweetheart?  What a fine example of Christian love and charity.

4vfDveiZaa	don't say bless me, it is not polite.  pardon me is used for interrupting or if you step on someone's feet (instead of saying sorry)  but excuse me is perfect for after you sneeze.|`|nPrqnd8eaa	whoow! that was a wet one! no really you should just wait for someone to "god bless" you, and if no one does say excuse me|`|fFObxgxuaa	At work I usually say...."ah sh*t!!

Excuse me is correct.    But if some one says 'bless you', 'good health' or anything else, just smile sweetly and say thank you.  .|`|AA11598210	~~I always say excuse me. I use pardon me when I want to get by someone, step on them, etc :)~~|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You don't technically have to say anything first. The 'proper etiquette' way this happens is like so:    1. You sneeze  2. Nearby people say "bless you"  3. You say "thank you."      If you want to add an 'excuse me' in there, that's fine but not necessary. 'Pardon me' is not a bad thing to say, but it's got a slightly different connotation and it doesn't quite fit here. "Bless me" is not appropriate to say.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	I say "excuse me."|`|16128eb9f03958951303e1cc4301c224aa	I say "excuse me."

8ipxhmNTaa	There are roughly equal numbers of men and women on this earth. When a man takes 4 wives, that means 3 other men can't find a wife, or have a family.    Polygamy is only good for the alpha male. The kind of guy who has more than everyone in all areas of life and still wants more.    Polygamy is degrading to women. It puts them in a position where they have to compete with other women for scarce resources, like affection and money for their kids' shoes.    Children of polygamous families get very little one on one time with their father. They are mostly brought up by a bunch of women - only one of whom doesn't resent their presence. Or they are brought up by older children.    Polygamy is associated with societies with bad economies. Those excess men without families are not motivated to work as hard, and the women are generally denied the right to work since that would make them too independent.    Polygamy is associated with poor education levels that contribute greatly to the bad economies. Men have bigger families than they can afford, so education isn't funded. Women are denied educations.    There are a lot of reasons that Western civilization rose and became dominant - one is certainly that they stamped out polygamy.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Um....The men have more than one wife and that is illegal. It teaches bad habits. Its gross.|`|oxeAYFGzaa	OK i am going to play devils advocate on this one just for fun. I really don't think polygamy is a good thing.      Polygamy isn't bad it is a great thing it allows you to have a different lover ever night or ever week with out worrying about any one getting jealous. It also ensures that the human race will continue to populate as you will be reproducing ( if  male with multi female partners). There are also multiple folks around so house work and every day chores are easier to do, and if everyone works then you can be a millionaire in no time as well think of the tax break you could get.    Good Luck with the project.|`|diCASlUXaa	Having multiple partners is being disloyal to them, and is considered cheating on them.  A romantic relationship is a committment to one person.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	Polygamy it self can cause a LOT of legal problems. Polyamory how ever (having multiple partners, but not being married to them) is perfectly fine and acceptable.      It is NOT cheating at all so long as all people involved are knowing and consenting.     I have seen, and been apart of poly-amorous relationships where every one truly loved every one else.  Love between knowing and consenting adults is never bad, or wrong.|`|emvIYyufaa	Polygamy by itself, without bringing and moral, emotional, or religious reasons in it because that varies from person to person, has a few legal issues. In some communities, there are also people that take the legal issues to a whole new level.    One thing that happens in some communities is that under age girls (as young as 10 or 12) are forced to marry older men. Some consent, others don't but either way, it would be considered statutory rape in most states (I don't know the laws of every state so it could be in all states but I'm just giving the benefit of the doubt.)    Also, In some communities, the wives are expected to stay home, take care of the house, have tons of children and basically live off of government funding, which is a drain on the economy.    Also, not to mention that I heard of one case in, I think it was florida, where a woman was marrying a bunch of illegal immigrants who paid her (I think.) so they could come to america. That was last year or something so I don't really remember the details too well. She was charged with polygamy and something else I think.|`|1UtVRoFHaa	People just don't like what they don't understand! Look at all the people that hate gay people.  I wouldn't say that polygamy is bad it just not understood.  I say this is a free country and they should be able to do what they wish.  I know I have been put down because I'm gay and some people even hate me, some laws will even put me in jail and I don't have the freedom to marry the person that I could fall in love with.  The world is just a crazy place and one at a time we add to it.
d9RW1XTqaa	When the Pope lands, he is always glad to arrive on the TERRA FIRMA.    On early maps everything unknown is labeled TERRA INCOGNITA.    In A.D. 1492 Columbus set sail for the new world.

CzNxbsmsaa	He has already received the best gift possible,his sobriety.Please pass my congratulations to him.Since God has already given him the best gift possible,try contacting the local Alcoholics Anonymous inter group(should be listed in phone book) and see about getting him a special medallion.If he goes to A.A. a good leather book cover for his Big Book is nice too.A hobby shop can do a personalized one for you with one of the quotes stamped onto it.Don't forget the cake!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Maybe get him a plant, or plant a tree with him to commemorate the occasion.  Then every time he looks at it, he'll remember that there are people who care and want him to continue to succeed.

1f2movZZaa	Use white or official sage. White is better, but both work well. Salt has been used for protection for centuries, and I highly recommend it. :)    Any type of water will work.    A good type of incense to use would be lavender or patchouli. Or both, since they compliment each other very nicely.    One of my favorite ways of cleansing/blessing involves sprinkling lavender around the house, on top of dressers and anywhere you feel appropriate. You could also substitute white sage or mint leaves. Play some nice music, something soothing, and try to leave the windows open as much as possible. Keep doors open for the most part (bedroom doors, bathroom doors, etc) so that the house is one wide, open space. Also, just something I do personally that seems to help, is that I wear silver. I regard it as being a very pure metal. I have certain pieces of jewelery that are very sentimental to me, because they were given to me from someone I love, and wearing them both helps to protect me and seems to protect me very effectively.    If you have access to any stones, fluorite and amethyst work the best at removing negative energy and restoring balance.    Good luck!|`|D2xDzZyFaa	get yourself blessed.   A blessed house with no faith in its ppl living inside could only attract them in your way.   By then, u should resort to the scriptures.   Change inside out. that's why inside's in the front :)|`|4rLdaCNHaa	Forget the sage, it's not at all necessary, that came with Native cleansing and everyone else copied, makes things more exciting i guess, nor did they use sage at least not before the 70's, they used sweetgrass.    The only thing that can be used with or without anything else is prayer, it has been used since Lucifer was first ousted, a cross as a symbol of strength, the cross is actually to give you strength of faith/courage...and the power is in the words and the depth of ones beliefs.     And don't believe everything you see on tv, as they seem to get rid of all spirits, poltergeists, evil, etc all the same way, there does happen to be a difference you know, if it were that easy, why the heck do ppl even bother calling for help if that's all there is to it.     Any holy man will and always has blessed a house if one asks, one doesn't need a reason, cleans it or bless it all the same thing.|`|e3gZsCsgaa	If you can't find sage, get an amethyst crystal for every window in the house. It traps and removes negative energies.|`|7QERhhRJaa	Use peanut butter tarts.|`|n53HeORBaa	get a priest to bless the house that would surely work|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Put salt on your window sills and in the doorways.    Sprinkle holy water in all the corners of the house and smudge with sage in those same places.    If you choose to go the Bibles and crosses route, skip the rest.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	As all people who are concerned about their welfare, I think you should get an amethyst cluster for each window in the house. It traps and removes negative energy for ever and as long as those clusters are there, your house should be evil-free.
