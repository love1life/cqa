20090227140804AA6CtpZ	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Is this a good S.A.T. score?	There is a new program at my school that allows both seventh and eigth graders to take the S.A.T. test. Just last week I got my scores back and received a total score of 1590 (If you want to know the details: 480 in reading, 520 in math, and 590 in writing). I was just wondering if you think that is a good score for a seventh grader? Obviously in high school it would not get me anywhere, but I just wanted to see what you think. And I didn't study for the test or anything; just went and did it. Thanks!! Be honest, please.

Before Tesla, all motors ran on direct current only, and that gave Thomas Edison and his "d.c. only" system the edge. Then Tesla created the alternating current motor, giving a.c. the final edge it needed. A.c. was superior because of the easy transformation of voltages. A.c. could be generated remotely at very high voltages, then "stepped down" to accommodate local distribution and home use. In comparison, Edison's system depended on the generators being close to the users, and depended on very large conductors between the source and destination to avoid large power losses.

20090227141118AAF9fVW	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should Tattoo Art Be Taught In Grade School?	I just heard of an art teacher that one of her projects she teaches her 4th graders about an African tribe and then one of their choices of "hands-on" activity is to draw a tattoo design because the Africans have tattoos. I immediately wondered if some of the parents might find this objectionable that their 4th grader is role playing a tattoo artist or in any way glamorizing the process. Then I asked myself if my child came home one day from school and showed me their "artwork" that they made and wanted it to be permanently embedded in them, I would be highly upset. I understand that they are attempting to teach the kids about culture and art, but I would assume their would be a plethora of things in the African culture as far as art goes that could be focused on besides tattoos. No matter how slim a chance it may be, if a grade school art project ends up being the thing that "planted the seed" in a youngsters mind to get tattoos, I think would be a shame and not what our educational system should be about.

20090227140508AAa10Cn	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Have I taken the right approach?	Lately I spoke to a career's advisor about wanting to pursue a career in medicine. She asked me for my predicted grades. I'm predicted: Chemistry- B (although my chemistry teachers are always telling me I am fully capable of achieving an A in this subject), Biology- B, (my biology teacher tells me i'm between an A and a B) English Literature- A, Sociology- A. The career's advisor said I really need to get my science predictions to A's which I sort of knew already. Ultimately, its what I get in my AS exams that's important but she did urge me to improve my predicted grades as university's look at them. She advised that I talk to my teachers about how I can improve in their subjects.      For sociology I didn't bother as I know what they think of me and my progress anyway - they are always telling me lool      For english I just asked her how she thinks i'm doing.      For the other two I felt a little reluctant to ask because in essence I was basically asking them how can I improve my predicted grade to an A.      I avoided phrasing it like this and just asked them how I can improve in the topic, for some help and guidance etc. But I feel like an idiot. Not because i'm too proud to ask for help or anything but just because I feel like I was being "extra" or "OTT".      Do teachers think this or do you think they're more pleased that you want to ask them how you can maximise your success in their subject?

I have tried to solve these two equations, and find their complex number roots in standard a + bi form, but I can't seem to figure out what to do.

One is cubic and one is quartic.      x^3+2x^2+11x+22=0       and      x^4-16=0      How do I solve these using the Quadratic Formula? or do I need to solve them a different way?

I have to write a speech about Canad's shortage of physicians, and I want to make it more interesting instead of just talking for the entire time. I have to pretend I am the Prime Minister of Canada (so, the President) and create some way to solve the issue of the physican shortage. I want to do that abreviation thing where you have a word and you make a sentence out of it (ex. C=cute A=annoying T=thing...I know that was a terrible example, but you get the idea). I'd like to use a word that is related to the topic "physican" or "doctor". So far, I got the word "medical" which stands for "More Enrollments of Doctors Increasing Clinic Availability L....." I can't think of a word for L. Oh, btw...in my speech I talk about creating a law that will increase the number of enrollments of training physicians and also creating a scholarship that will pay for most of the student's tuition, but they must sign a contract that says they'll stay in Canada once they graduate.        I know that's a lot, but basically, if you can think of a word for L, that would be great. Or if you can think of something other than the word medical. that would be good too!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =)

In my Freshman Year, I had a really hard time making friends. I stil do.    I personally dont think I do anything wrong to keep people away from me (I'm laid back and very respectful towards everyone). The problem is, is that so many of my peers do drugs, or drink, or have 'it.' However, as corny as it might sound, I live above the influence. I have never and never plan to do drugs or the stupid stuff my peers do.    But living above the influence comes with its hardships. I often have to eat lunch ALONE, I can't go to dances (who would want to go with a 'loser?', according to them), and I spend my weekends alone with no one to talk to but my parents and my dog (well, playing with the dog...talking would be rather difficult. wouldn't it?)   The Big Question: Where do I go from here?       Thank you to all contributors for any given advice.

20081029192236AAwAL2T	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is this a good essay??????????????????	"Bigger is better" that is what most people think when it comes to population. Most people think that having a big population helps the community but for the most part it hurts us. This is a very big concern to our soceity.it hurts our community, economy and most of all our wallets.  Over populated areas have a capacious affect on our society today. Population in general has a colossal influence on our civilization. The population of a certain area does have an effect to our society but, how dose it affects us? Thus increasing gas, shipping, and supply prices for everyone else, But most people have received improved salary or anything in that perspective. So few people have to declare bankruptcy and receive help form the government such as welfare.  When an area is over populated usually few people turn to crime to help them in their times of need that is why the crime rate is so high in such areas. Are they just in certain areas such as "country" area or "city" or is it just over populated areas in general?   Well, when people fear that they will not "survive" like they want to they turn to crime to try to get what they really want. Most of the time anyone can do a crime to survive but, city areas are more predicted to have a higher crime rate than any other area.      How dose it affects us the taxpayers directly? Well most of the time it just increases the amount of tax we have to pay. But for some that is a little to much. Some people's pay and have little money after. Some people don't pay at all!     Most over populous areas have a lot of poverty in that areas. What is poverty and how does it happen? Well poverty is deprivation, the denial of access to those things which make a life of dignity possible, including not only food, shelter and safe drinking water, but also such as 'intangibles' as the opportunity to learn, to engage in meaningful employment. Some people think that poverty doesn't affect the "average Joe,"But there wrong. The taxes that they have to pay go to the people in "poverty."How can we help with those in this position? We can help out by just paying our taxes on time, or you can help find more jobs for people.    In the year 2026, it is estimated that the world's population will leap too twice its size now. If we don't do something about this then we will face bigger problems like pollution less space for people, less food, clothing, and shelter. Most of all we would lose most of our resources, nonrenewable and renewable.

My nose starts bleeding all over the place so I excuse myself from class and wipe it up. I come back to class and realize that I got a referral and 3 in school suspentions. It sucks because I got the same punishment as the boy who punched me. Now does that seem fair to you?! That i the one with the bloody nose got the same punishment as the one who punched me?

A senior quote    I have everything except for my senior quote and I'm stuck between these three quotes by Eleanor Roosevelt.    1.You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.    2. Life must be lived and curiosity kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life.    3. One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.    - They are all amazing quotes by an amazing figure so I'm having a really difficult time deciding. I would really appreciate it if you can give me valid reasons as to choose a certain quote. I'm really looking for a quote about struggle, adversity and triumph. So if you guys can recommend anymore then that would be great. Thanks so much!

And I've written about fashion, that I wanna move to NYC and become a stylist.   The end of the text is like this:      This might sound superficial, but it isn't.   Fashion isn't superficial, it's art, and it's a fun way to express yourself.      I'm 13, is it proper for a 13 year old girl to write this?   and when i write this, do the teacher expect me to dress fashionable every day?   What could I change? I wanna write something that tell the teacher that i'm not just dreaming about fame, and fashion, and things that many people think is superficial....      HELP ME, cuties <3

20090307104336AAZMoii	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Charter Schools...What do you think?	I'm in 9th grade right now at a private high school. I don't really want to go there next year. I toured this charter high school that starts at 10th grade. I'm thinking that I might go there next year.      The thing is, it is COMPLETELY different from what I have ever been used to (I went to public school until 8th grade). It is right next to a really small college campus, and for classrooms they have about 10 portables. You do take classes in the classrooms in the college, though.      What really interested me was the early college program. I can get my associate's degree by the time I graduate high school if I go there.      It's extremely small (about 250 kids), but I'm going to a school about the same size.      What is your opinion on this? Do you think I would be able to adjust easily? What do you think about charter schools in general?      Thanks so much!

Back in the Spring of 2008 I had my Financial Aid canceled due to dropping below a 70% successful completion ratio. Now, my reason for failing in my classes was due to the fact that I became highly malnutrition, while I worked this minimum wage job, that did not offer me a break even though I had an eight to ten hour shift, additionally, management would assign me shifts which schedule would change daily, so I would end up staying up late one night working and then had to be back at work less than 4 hours later. I am trying to appeal using the schedule conflict as the cause since I cannot prove the malnutrition part. What are my chances of getting my appeal approved?

Unfortunatly, I did not know what I wanted to do or why I was going.  I ended up taking about 11 classes which I stopped going to but I didn't know I needed to formally withdraw from.  My transcript show a bunch of F's.  Years later, I figured out what I wanted to do & started going to a school online where I hold a 3.8 GPA.  I am finishing my AA in June now want to transfer to a local university to finish my bachlor, but it seems like i need to redo all those class from the community college otherwise they won't accept me.  Is there another way around this?  Should I retake all those classes?  Are there any school that will accept my current AA grades and not make me redo my past mistakes at the community college?
