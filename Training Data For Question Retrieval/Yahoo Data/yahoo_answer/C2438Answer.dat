2eT7T2fKaa	Interesting question. Personally, I don't think I had to fight for some oppurtunities in my life (for example, I used to be a software engineer, and my career growth and opportunities came relatively easy - note: relatively easy - not like just fell in place). but there were some i had to fight (for example, i have had goals that were out of my daily life, like some research I want to do, and it is a struggle - i had been struggling for months now). <br>  <br>  I think it has to do with two concepts - whether things just fall in place or not<br>  <br>  one: often you don't see the doors that are open or that just opened as you are looking at other closed doors or doors that just closed - meaning in this context, you might have oppurtunities you're ignoring but you only are focused on a few you think are opportunities. happened a lot for me, everytime I struggled for getting things in my life, i look back after a while and I go... "haa... i could have done that instead of this - that was given to me in a platter but i only wanted this"<br>  <br>  two: you could be looking for opportunities that are not falling in place given what you do now. as i mentioned, me having been a software engineer in one particular field, i had a lot of opportunities but there were a lot i had to work really hard to get because where i was that time, they didn't have to come easily for me - for example, i still remember applying for a company, got a job, i was supposed to become a manager and i was fighting for a highly technical position - the reality was the people who hired me that i was qualified for what they gave me and they needed me in that where us i was headstrong on what i wanted and it was so bothersome that i didn't get it.<br>  <br>  anyway... i guess what i said was useful to you. but beyond that if you truly think you have to fight for everything (after discouning for the above two points), i hope things will become easier - to make it easier, you might want to start making yourself better at a few things, before different opportunities show up before you - like learn you stuff really well, by spending extra time now itself.|`|M5E4Wx03aa	Both dear, just when you fight, they fall faster...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Good for you!|`|ok21L0nmaa	I have spilled plenty of blood,sweat,and tears in my amazing journey and I'm a better person for it.|`|3vez2ZiJaa	well, Ive been sitting online since i was 16 waiting for my life to change... it hasn't changed.<br>  <br>  i don't believe it will change until i get desperate enough to change it myself.
2eT7T2fKaa	I assumed i understood your question somewhat but after I read your additional info confused me - looks like there are two different things you're talking about.<br>  <br>  Good and bad, positive and negative, and a lot of other binary things like this have some basic rules (like you do something that makes someone else happy, it is good. you do something that hurts someone, that is bad) and also driven by perceptions and defintions.<br>  <br>  Now, about this positive and negative attritude - it is highly perception based in my opinion (compared to good vs bad). and I am not sure what you're exactly talking about - an example would have been better. <br>  <br>  let's generalize it with two examples - these aren't perfect examples - but let's go with the flow.<br>  <br>  let's say you have an argument with a friend - you continue to be nice, polite, want to think that the other person has the right perspective just like you do, bla bla and approach it that way, i guess that's a positive attitude. a negative attitude might be getting caught up in anger/frustration and fighting. <br>  <br>  let's life is pretty bad for you. a positive attitude would be keeping high hopes, believe in your confidence, whatever, right. And similarly, negative attitude might be, just losing hope, take a break from whatever it is, say life sucks, and figure out what next. <br>  <br>  i know my examples aren't coming out nice - but i guess I am coveying myself well enough.<br>  <br>  yes, positive attitude can be good. and negative attitude also works in many cases - it depends on your definition of negative attitude - if when, a friend who's meaningless arguing, being upfront, getting frustrated that he is stupid is a negative attitude (i think it would be considered negative attitude), hey, it works in that case sometimes. i could have also kept a nice calm, patient posture for hours, it might not have worked better there.<br>  <br>  a negative attitude with long term implications can (or i would say always) is bad. short term, with consequences known clearly, sure, why not? it works.<br>  <br>  that said, the added detail, confused me because looks like you're talking about yin and yan or stuff like that - you hit the bottom, it is good because now you see that you can go up. you are sad, that's ok, because now you see life is beautiful and stuff. if that's what you meant, i don't have enough thoughts to talk about it - i guess i don't buy much of the ups and downs theories in life. you don't have to be sad sometimes to know when you're happy some other times - that's just my philosophy.|`|3d9315f34265f3ee09c7266dc91245f8aa	Always be positive because being positive gives off the greatest energy.

After reading Dee Brown's Book Bury my heart at Wounded Knee it talks about the settleres pretty much treated the Native Americans like crap and said "we need a place to go and you're just going to have to deal with what we do."  But what really bites is that they would put the reservations in the worst spots with the worst treatment it was mostly like a concentration camp but a few years earlier.       I have also been to the Oglala Lakhota Rez. in Pine Ridge and the elders told me the same thing so I know it's true.  Did you know that scalping actually came from Europe?

The family that moved in after the murders, George and Kathy Lutz, in 1976 quickly moved out stating that they had experienced paranormal activity, and said that the murdered family was haunting the house.  Jay Anson then wrote the book the Ammityville horror based off of what the Lutz' say they experienced.

KtdlJbrOaa	Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in the jurisprudence of the United States, upholding segregation and the constitutionality of the "separate but equal" doctrine.<br>  <br>  After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, during the period known as Reconstruction, the federal government was able to provide some protection for the civil rights of the newly-freed slaves. But when Reconstruction abruptly ended in 1877 and federal troops were withdrawn, southern state governments began passing Jim Crow laws that prohibited blacks from using the same public accommodations as whites. The Supreme Court had ruled, in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to the actions of government, not to those of private individuals, and consequently did not protect persons against their or private entities who violated their civil rights. In particular, the Court invalidated most of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, a law passed by Congress to protect blacks from private acts of discrimination.<br>  <br>  In 1890, the State of Louisiana passed a law that required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on railroads, including separate railway cars. Concerned, several black and white citizens in New Orleans formed an association dedicated to the repeal of that law. They persuaded Homer Plessy, who was one-eighth black (an octoroon in the now-antiquated parlance), to test it.<br>  <br>  Plessy legitimized the move towards segregation practices begun earlier in the South. Along with Booker T. Washington's Atlanta Compromise address, delivered the same year, which accepted black social isolation from white society, Plessy provided an impetus for further segregation laws. In the ensuing decades, segregation statutes proliferated, reaching even to the federal government in Washington, D.C., which re-segregated during Woodrow Wilson's administration in the 1910s.<br>  <br>  William Rehnquist wrote a memo called "A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases" when he was a law clerk in 1952, during early deliberations that led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued that "I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think Plessy v.Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed." He continued, "To the argument... that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minority are."

0xfVyxxIaa	Russia's contribution to the first world war was very important. They fought the Austro-Hungarian empire to a standstill and gave Germany a 'second front'. Although they were largely unsuccessful against the Germans their fatal invasion of East Prussia in 1914 caused the German high command to dispatch an army from the western front that helped the demise of the Schleiffen plan.    For the US it stirred some negative support for the Entente from some ethnic communities from Eastern Europe.    Russia exited the war early thanks to the revolution and the rise of the Bolsheviks.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Try these two links:    http://www.slideshare.net/robsmith3000/r...    http://www.naval-history.net/WW1Campaign...|`|IGUUzBBraa	Russia was protecting Serbia from Austrian attack. When Austria accused Serbia of assassinating Franz Ferdinand and attacked them, Russia attacked Austria to protect Serbia.  Then, because of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, France (and the French empire) and Britain (and the British empire) helped Russia, and Germany and Italy helped Serbia.  (Highly simplified.)  And Russia stopped fighting halfway through the war, because Russia was having a revolution.|`|EU8EkDJaaa	Russia was tied into the war via alliances. When Russia began losing and a revolution took hold, the Bolshevics pulled out.    This allowed the US to enter a war on the side of "the democracies," as Britain and France were being worn down by the "evil" German Kaizer. And a "war for democracy" took hold. Thus, neither the US or Russia was involved the full course of the war. Once Russia pulled out, the US entered, and when the doughboys came, the allies and the U.S. (the U.S. was not an ally, but an "associate" of the allies) were able to win. U.S. men and material won WWI, while the Russians were the driving force behind WWII.|`|iq6fo6SRaa	Russia involved because it alliate with France and England in the "Entente Cordiale". they weren't in the whole war because Russians were in something similar to a civil war, so they wanted to pay attention exclusively to that fact, so they retired. as Russia retired, The United States enter "replacing" Russia (this could be an effect). the main cause was the fact that Germans attacked one of their submarines whithout a valid reason.    if you want to understand better what i just wrote you should read this:    first of all WWI took place since 1914 to 1918 in europe.  the main cause was imperialism, which was when powerful countries "took advantage" of "weak" countries. This powerful countries looked for raw material in such weak countries, so they colonized them and this way, they had free raw materials ready to be industrialized.    as this fenome grew, powerful countries wanted more and more, so a rivalry between them was created. one of this countries was England which dominated world's economy with France; there were others that followed them they were Germany, The United States, and Russia. all of these countries had huge pieces of land and stable economies.    at first, France and England "fought" for power but as German economy grew France and England allied forming what was called the "Entente Cordiale" (Great Brittany also belonged to this block).    mean while Germany also created its own alliance with   Austria-Hungary and China. the event that made the war explote was the attack to Germans when they pretended to attack Frech.    Another cause of WWI was the rivalry between Balkans.|`|0pwkrzIcaa	Causes 1. In February 1917 there were shortages of bread in Petrograd and prices were very high. 2. Tsar Nicholas II was weak and did not keep his promises. 3. The effects of the First World War on the Russian army. 4. In Russia there were big differences between rich and poor. 5. The Russian Parliament (the Duma), which was set up in 1906, was not given any real power. The Tsar still ruled as an autocrat (like a dictator).    effects    A wide range of actors, such as foreign governments, financial spheres, big political parties (radicals and socialists in France, social-democrats in Germany, etc.), public opinion and the international press, European and Asian revolutionary movements or the Russian Diaspora, many of whom returned to Russia, reacted with vigour, enthusiasm, fear or embarrassment to the Russian events and frequently attempted to instrumentalise them. The spread of information about the Revolution and the manner in which revolutionary events were represented in Russia and in other countries also remain little studied.

However, it could have been a little more advanced, vocabulary-wise.I found that his way of explaining things were child-like, and it was too easy to read.

Meyer used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because she loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil."

You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythologylook how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, Meyer loved the beautiful simplicity of the picture.

Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So she dosn't know what the tulip meansShe didn't have anything to do with this one."      - Eclipse -    The thread represents Bella's life and how she's torn between her current life, and her future life with Edward. If she stays with Jacob she can have her family and a chance at a happy normal life. If she chooses Edward she realizes she'll have to give up a lot of things that are important to her like her family, and she finally for once looks at the other human things she'll be missing out on. So basically it's showing how "torn" she is about her life and being with the one she loves.       -Breaking Dawn -    "Breaking Dawn's cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga. She began as the weakest (at least physically, when compared to vampires and werewolves) player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen. In the end, it's Bella that brings about the win for the Cullens."|`|9HCypvHJaa	Twilight- The forbidden fruit.    New Moon- Stephenie Meyer had no intentions for the cover of New Moon. It was chosen for her by her publishers and editor.    Eclipse- The ribbon represents Bella being torn between Edward and Jacob, and also her not being able to tear herself away from her human life completely.     Breaking Dawn- The red pawn represents Bella at the beginning... small and the weakest player on the board. The queen represents her at the end... the strongest player on the board. The red and white colors are also symbolic of her human life (red), and her vampire life (white).|`|kAqjxDHaaa	In an interview, Stephanie Meyer said that they didn't mean anything, and were chosen by someone else.

Stephenie Meyer has stated that the flower has no significance to the story, as she had no part in choosing its design.      in eclipse the book jacket features a torn red ribbon.  The broken ribbon represents choice, as in the book Bella must choose between her love for vampire Edward Cullen, and her friendship with werewolf Jacob Black. Meyer also stated that the ribbon represents the idea that Bella can't break away completely from her human life|`|fIrUiD1zaa	The apple represents the forbidden fruit, it symbolizes the love and the relationship between Edward & Bella. It also represents Bella's knowledge of good/evil and the choice that she is partaking in the choice to choose between seeing Edward or not.    Stephenie Meyers states that the flower has no significance to the story, and she had nothing to do with the choosing of that cover.    The broken ribbon represents choice, Bella's choice between friendship with Jacob or her relationship with Edward. Stephanie also stated that the ribbon represents the idea that Bella's can not completely break away from her human life.    The chess themed cover is suppose to represent Bella's progression from a pawn to the most powerful player on the board.
qt9rrk6xaa	The argument for being a criminal is that he killed his father to assume power. It's still debated, but there's enough evidence to get to a jury.    There is no question that he was a brilliant military strategist. But he didn't use force as a defense. He used it to conquer other peoples and countries. In today's world, that's seriously frowned upon (e.g. Sadam Hussein in Kuwait, Hitler in Poland, Belgium, France, etc., Stalin in Czechoslovakia)    The Macedonians were scary. They were actually barred from participating in the first Olympics held in Athens because it was understoond they were bigger, faster, stronger, and meaner than everyone else.|`|AA10729675	It is totally irrelevant for an historian to judge a historic figure with our moral standards.  It is not professional for historians to do that.  Yet a lot do it.  Including a certain Badian who was not American but taught at Yale or Harvard, and wrote many things about Alexander that were not flattering.  I call him Badian the bad-mouth.  You see, at the time of Alexander, there already were two sides: those for Alexander and those against.  So they are the ones who recorded things in a bias way.  The pro Alexander went too far sometimes in the flattery, and so did those who were anti-Alexander.  We have to analyze what were the reasons and the interests those last had to criticize Alexander.  There is a fable by Lafontaine which says: he is a fool the one who thinks he can please everyone.  No one can please everyone.  Some were displeased at Alexander.  If we analyze their reasons often we find that they were not intelligent enough to grasp Alexander's ideas.  For instance he killed the Brahmans.  But if he had lived, he would have been the Shah of all the Persian Empire and he knew the Brahmans were his enemies.  And in fact, it is possible that he was poisoned by a Brahman, Bagoas who could well be Chanakya, the one who wrote the Arthashastra just for Chandragupta Maurya after Alexander's death.  In the Artha shastra you have one or two chapters only on POISONS.  There is a rule in India:  no one can write a shastra unless he is a Brahman!  He killed Philotas who was a hipparch, a great general, with much power and popularity, and he killed Philotas' father.  But he had read letters written by the soldiers to their family, prior to those killings.  The soldiers who were against him were put in one special batalion not to infect the other soldiers:  so there was indeed a plot to kill him.  Alexander was defending himself.  He was the king, therefore, all alone!  As a king he would receive news about everything... except plots.  He managed to learn about this one.  He did not manage in Babylon.  Since his best friend, Hephaistion had died (maybe poisoned too), he was even more alone.  Maybe he did not seek recovery.  Who knows?    He was a hero, that is for sure.  I wonder how Badian looks.  Since Badian, we have all those bad rumors about Alexander and his alledged genocides.  Research has proven that in Bactria there were a lot of Greeks after Alexander's death and even after all the killings of the Greeks ordered by one of his Successors, Perdiccas.  And there were a lot of Bactrians, Sogdians, Indians, etc.  And a lot of Brahmans too.  So where is the genocide?      Alexander is a hero, the favorite of all times.|`|783Ve5Pnaa	Hero for sure!

Todos tendríamos acceso a sus obras al instante, el autor recibiría una peque?a cantidad de los lectores a los que el libro le gustó (aunque parezca increíble con la licencia CC se han conseguido ganancias poniendo las cosas libres.Y lo más importante: sería el auténtico due?o de su obra y tendría independencia absoluta.<br>  Y lo mismo digo para los músicos, los cineastas y todo el que quiera vivir de la cultura valiéndose de su propias fuerzas con el fin de no venderse a las editoriales y multinacionales.|`|ttOHd8xcaa	La sociedad necesita oir lo que dice un presidente   de club de fútbol, lo que dice un corredor de fórmula uno, un portero de fútbol, un negociante, un malhechor, un ladrón, un asesino, un torero y poco más  ... pero ... un escritor nooooo .. ni un artista tampoco, los científicos también están incluidos en los apestados y luego en el último lugar tenemos a los músicos, los de verdad, a los televisivos si les escucha ... la sociedad ... en fín .. el destino de los apestados está en manos de la sociedad y por lo que se vé van de culo ... saludos|`|yTAkeSq3aa	pienso que si; ya que muchos retratan su época, su sociedad, el medio donde se desenvuelven, lo que ven, escuchan, sus reflexiones, sus estudios acerca de algo.Siento que leyendo a diferentes autores podemos llegar a ser mas objetivos ya que entendemos diferentes puntos de vista. No hay un solo autor del que no aprendas, por lo menos a ver su mundo y con eso podemos elegir que podemos tomar para el nuestro

Ele e seu irm?o Epimeteu foram incumbidos de fazer o homem e assegurar-lhe, e aos outro animais, todas as faculdades necessárias à sua preserva??o. Epimeteu encarregou-se da obra e Prometeu, de examiná-la depois de pronta. Assim, Epimeteu tratou de atribuir a cada animal dons variados, de coragem, for?a, rapidez, sagacidade; asas a um, garras a outro, uma carapa?a protegendo um terceiro etc. Quando, porém, chegou a vez do homem, que tinha de ser superior a todos os outros animais, Epimeteu gastara os recursos com tanta prodigalidade que nada mais restava. Perplexo, recorreu a seu irm?o Prometeu, que, com a ajuda de Minerva, subiu ao céu e acendeu sua tocha no carro do sol, trazendo o fogo para o homem. Com esse dom, o homem assegurou sua superioridade sobre todos os outros animais. O fogo lhe forneceu o meio de construir as armas com que subjugou os animais e as ferramentas com que cultivou a terra; aquecer sua morada, de maneira a tornar-se relativamente independente do clima, e, finalmente, criar a arte da cunhagem das moedas, que ampliou e facilitou o comércio". <br>  <br>  No entanto, como castigo pelo "furto do fogo", PROMETEU foi condenado a ter seu fígado devorado, e tal opera??o se repete todos os dias, indefinidamente.<br>  <br>  Pois bem... indo para a Antropologia filosófica o homem é um dos animais mais frágeis da natureza... ele nasce pelado, n?o consegue alimentar-se sozinho, precisa do constante cuidado da m?e. No entanto na medida em que vai crescendo e desenvolvendo sua racionalidade (e usando o fogo, segundo a Mitologia) o homem passa a dominar técnicas (e a criá-las) e com elas obter facilidades para sua vida.<br>  <br>  <br>  Portanto, tudo é difícil no come?o primeiro pela culpa de PROMETEU (ainda bem que aquele maldito tem seu órg?o devorado todos os dias até hoje), depois porque n?o nascemos sabendo... devemos desenvolver habilidades para tornar nossa vida mais agradável!|`|f41128ffe659728d370f4af0861ac7e9aa	filosofo,<br>  <br>  Desculpe-me se n?o concordo, eu acho que tudo é muito fácil a maioria do seres humanos é que complica.<br>  <br>  Veja bem; nascemos de uma m?e maravilhosa que nos acolhe em seus seios e nos nutre, crescemos em torno a ela e toda sua ternura. <br>  O que acontece quando temos a compreens?o do mundo?<br>  <br>  A primeira coisa que acontece é contestar o colo que nos acolheu, e por ai vai toda uma conduta que só trará dificuldades de relacionamento e de vida.<br>  <br>  Quando acontece do ser humano  nascer em um lar em que ele aceita a orienta??o de seus genitores e existe um diálogo, para estes tudo na vida será mais fácil. <br>  <br>  Sabe porque?

WQlNNHuXaa	I have to say Mr Rochester but not in his ennervated castrated state by the end of Jane Eyre. The dynamic and audacious Rochester at the start of the novel. He is a little less scrupulous then Darcy but he is very much an Alpha and a whole lot more interesting. I have always related to Jane and her reserved, taciturn yet deeply passionate personality latent beneath the surface and Darcy is like that too so it might be awkward. Darcy, is too similar to my own ways. I would rather the compliment of Rochester as I am a little shy and I enjoy the subtle sado masochistic dynamics of their interaction.Rochester all the way!|`|NbjYOULjaa	Mr. Rochester|`|W8iDn9hhaa	niether!!! edward!!!<br>  <3|`|uYqQAhJuaa	I would say Mr. Rochester.|`|d5cea12346bfdd117d7e1fd0cf52731baa	Mr. Darcy is much more forgivable.  He makes mistakes and is sometimes rude and proud but he also admits he was wrong and works hard to correct the damage.  We all have some pride and prejudice in us.  Mr. Rochester orders Jane around and may be terribly harsh.  He is only gentle when the mood seizes him.  He also deceives her and I am surprised that she forgives him so easily.|`|I9Jd3tCdaa	Mr. Darcy because:<br>  <br>  1) I am exactly like Elizabeth Bennet, so... yeah.<br>  <br>  2) He is sensitive and polite. Mr. Rochester is polite... only.<br>  <br>  3) If I chose Rochester, you'd probably think I'd be like Jane Austen. And Jane Austen is creepy, at least in that one book (I forgot the name, I despise it so much...)|`|AA10097649	Darcy, no hands down. I prefer his personality style, and I see myself more as an Elizabeth Bennet than a Jane Eyre. Both are very good leading men, but Mr Rochester is missing a bit of the charm that Darcy has.|`|u0zEutf1aa	Hard choice...Mr. Darcy.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, to be honest I don't think I'd get along that well with either.  Mr Rochester I frankly consider very dodgy, a man who keeps his wife chained up in the attic, and tries to get married bigamously to someone else, is capable of anything in my opinion.  And he's very strange and moody.<br>  <br>  Mr Darcy, although he is more normal than Mr Rochester, is very reserved and silent, and since I am a quite reserved and silent person myself I don't think we'd really hit it off, we'd both just sit and stare at each other, neither of us saying a word.  Very awkward.<br>  <br>  However, I'd rather have silence than Mr Rochester's sinister past I think, so I'd pick Mr Darcy.|`|70jNDiIiaa	Oh, Mr. Rochester, hands down! Yum.

Posso citar mais um como o Duque de Caxias, a história que nos contam na escola é da Caroxinha!<br>  <br>  <br>  *Foi a República - ou mais exatamente, os ideólogos positivistas que presidiram à sua funda??o - que buscaram na figura de Tiradentes uma personifica??o da identidade republicana do Brasil, mitificando a sua biografia. Daí a sua iconografia tradicional, de barba e camisol?o, à beira do cadafalso, vagamente assemelhada a Jesus Cristo e, obviamente, desprovida de verossimilhan?a. Como militar, o máximo que Tiradentes poder-se-ia permitir era um discreto bigode.

Nada há que estranhar porque - e está mais que provado - que 12 pessoas que tenham assistido a um detrminado acontecimento e a quem se lhes pediu que o relatassem, textos com 12 vers?es diferentes.<br>  Mas sobre o "Tiradentes" é evidente que normalmente s?o os mais Fracos que s?o os Lesados e assim sendo nada há que estranhar. <br>  Há quam possa assacar culpa à ent?o "coloniza??o portuguesa" mas pessoalmente acho que a maioria dos Portugueses n?o estavam contra o acontecimento e entendo que n?o podemos julgar um facto condenando um Todo ou seja dizer linearmente que foi a Coloniza??o Portuguesa. "Talvez" alguns portugueses que iriam sentir-se relegados para um plano inferior; tivessem promovido tal coisa ? isso aceito.<br>  Temos na História de Portugal um caso ainda mais Flagrante que foi e Extermínio dos "TAVORAS" que faziam frente ao Marquês de Pombal e porquê? simplesmente porque o Marquês - se bem que tivesse muitas qualidades, vinha de uma camada social Baixa e o maior prazer dele era mostrar que tinha poder.

O problema de seguran?a brasileiro n?o é o crescimento do número de bandidos, mas a criminaliza??o do estado. Quando Rodolph Giuliani, prefeito de Nova York, estabeleceu a opera??o "Break Windows" ou "Zero Tolerance", sua primeira medida foi descriminalizar a polícia de Nova York demitindo os policiais corruptos. Ent?o a nossa inseguran?a é um subproduto da nossa corrup??o. N?o há como combater a criminalidade sem debelar a corrup??o do aparelho estatal extorquidor do crime organizado. Pena que a imprensa n?o fa?a cobran?as mais veementes em cima de um estado que, ao invés de reprimir, se associou ao crime organizado na pessoalidade de alguns dos seus agentes graduados que se promiscuiram em troca de altos favores econ?micos.

Mas eu tenho uma liga??o mental muito forte com a minha m?e. é impressionante: ela vem falar comigo sobre um assunto q eu já ia conversar com ela e vice-versa; eu penso em ligar para ela e ela imediatamente me liga (e vice-versa tb); uma vez fui fazer um prato super diferente q eu nunca tinha feito antes e ela me chamou na sala e perguntou se eu n?o estava afim de fazer justamente aquele prato (parece bobagem, mas foi impressionante na hora. ela nunca tinha pedido aquele prato e eu nunca tinha feito e a gente pensou nele ao mesmo tempo); quando ela me liga eu sei q é ela, qdo eu ligo pra ela, mesmo pro tel fixo, ela tb sabe q sou eu. As vezes até atende já dizendo meu nome (n?o, ela n?o tem bina); a gente as vezes se esbarra em um local no centro ou no shopping sem combinar nada; mas o q me dá raiva mesmo é qdo ela parece q tá lendo meus pensamentos.

Exames isolados e em série provaram que existe transmiss?o de pensamento. Excluem-se daí todas as histórias de espíritos e fantasmas de ocultismo duvidoso bem como idéias inspiradas em fanatismo religioso. Consideram-se exclusivamente fen?menos capazes de serem investigados em laboratório. Em agosto de 1959 concluiu-se a experiência "Nautilus". Comprovando-se n?o só a possibilidade da telepatia como a de que as transmiss?es de pensamentos entre cérebros humanos s?o mais intensas que as realizadas por meio de rádio-ondas. A experiência foi esta: - a uma distancia de vários milhares de quil?metros do "emissor do pensamento", o submarino "Nautilus" mergulhou algumas centenas de metros sob o nível do mar, todas as liga??es de rádio ficaram interrompidas, pois n?o penetram à níveis profundos de água. Mas funcionou a telepatia entre o senhor X e o senhor Y. Após tais testes científicos, pergunta-se quanto mais o cérebro humano é capaz?

ftGZfeDyaa	Coincido con la mayoría de los usuarios. El 12 de Octubre debe ser un día de reflexión, no se si de duelo. El choque entre culturas "avanzadas" (y remarco las comillas) y otras menos "avanzadas" da como resultado la absorción de la primera hacia la segunda.<br>  Creo que la reflexión debería ser, existía en ese momento otra manera de avanzar por sobre las cultiras originarias de América que no fuese la aniquilación de estas últimas de manera tan brutal como fue hecha?<br>  Una vez expulsados los espa?oles, portugueses, franceses y demas de America, los gobiernos autoctonos, como trataron a los habitantes originarios de nuestras tierras?<br>  Me remito a mi país Argentina, donde los gobiernos posteriores al Virreynato del Río de la Plata no mejoraron en nada las condiciones de vida de los indígenas argentinos, por el contrario, hoy por hoy figuran entre nuestros próceres verdaderos genocidas de esta cultura (En especial Julio A. Roca).<br>  Y lo más importante, que hacen los gobiernos de nuestros países el día de hoy por los pocos indígenas que sobrevivieron y luchan por no perder lo poco que les queda?<br>  Yo puedo dar testimonio de lo que ocurre en mi país, donde siguen abandonados, viviendo en la extrema pobreza, reclamando que por lo menos les sean devueltas parte de sus tierras.<br>  "No había entonces enfermedad,<br>  no había pecado,<br>  Había santa devoción en nosotros.<br>  Saludables vivíamos.<br>  No había enfermdad,<br>  no había dolor de huesos,<br>  no había fiebre,<br>  no había viruela.<br>  No fue así lo que hicieron los extranjeros<br>  cuando llegaron aquí.<br>  Ellos ense?aron el miedo,<br>  y vinieron a marchitar las flores.<br>  Para que su flor viviese,<br>  da?aron y sorbieron nuestra flor.<br>  ?A Castrar el sol!<br>  Eso vinieron a hacer aquí los extranjeros" (Poema maya del Chilam Balam)<br>  Que el pasado nos sirva para mejorar el futuro...<br>  <br>  PD: Para "jaimepece" y sus secuaces - Que te parecería a ti si te ponen cadenas al cuello, te alejan de tu familia y te llevan caminando cientos de kilometros sólo a pan y agua para que trabajes en las minas de oro y plata hasta que te mueras de cansancio, hambre o enfermedad.

Los Mayas, los Aztecas,los Incas, fueron artesanos, agricultores, arquitectos q aplicaron a sus ciudades ingeniosos sistemas de defensa y de riego.Todas esas culturas respetaban a los seres vivos, no practicaban la caza deportiva y cuidaban el medio ambiente, los ancianos y los ni?os eran los mas respetados, unos eran la experiencia y otros el futuro.<br>  Para los europeos del siglo xv, que se sentian el centro del universo, las cosas comenzaban a existir cuando ellos las conocian: las "descubrian".<br>  Para los Americanos seria el tragico descubrimiento de que se terminaban los tiempos en que podian decidir por su cuenta su vida, su forma de pensar, su modo de producir y su religion."<br>  De ninguna forma puedo estar de acuerdo en que el 12 de Octubre sea un dia de celebracion, creo mas bien que es un dia en que debemos recordar con tristeza la exterminacion de los indigenas y de su cultura.|`|58f124a9a7e2cc0488256d88571928acaa	Que bueno tenerte de vuelta!!<br>  Coincido con vos, habría que, al menos, cambiarle el nombre.<br>  Pero, por suerte, la mentalidad de la gente ha ido cambiando; antes no se hablaba de esto, se conmemoraba y listo.

Más que un encuentro, aquello fue un terrible “choque” de culturas, en el que una de ellas terminó llevándose por delante a la otra, por considerarla primitiva y al nivel de los animales.<br>  <br>  El día de la raza es un mamarracho ya desde su nombre ?Acaso hay palabras tan horribles en nuestro idioma como RAZA? Un término que induce discriminación, intolerancia, y que hasta a llegado a reforzar todos estos malos sentimientos dentro de la gente.Una de las cosas que deberíamos intentar desde nuestro lugar de americanos, es por todos los medios que tengamos a nuestro alcance quitar esa idea que los latinos tienen acerca de los indios, eso que inculco Sarmiento y que todavía dura en nuestra sociedad. No nos olvidemos que uno de los libros más vendidos de nuestra literatura nacional es “Facundo”, y en el mismo Sarmiento vislumbra un país dividido en dos partes: Lo que él llamaba “Civilización” (Europa y Buenos Aires) y lo que también él veía como “Barbarie” (El interior, los gauchos y los aborígenes).Tal vez si le diéramos otro significado al 12 de octubre la cosa sería distinta, porque podríamos utilizar este día (trascendental dentro de la historia de la humanidad) como una jornada de reflexión en la que recordar a las víctimas de la conquista. En lugar del espantoso nombre de “Día de la raza” se lo podría llamar de una manera diferente, conmemorando a los indígenas. O tal vez por qué no, llamar directamente “Día de los aborígenes” al conocido Día de las Américas.<br>  <br>  Sea como sea creo que la cosa no terminó. La lucha de los nativos continúa hoy contra las contaminaciones y lo peor de todo sucede cuando deben defender sus tierras de los inversores extranjeros que llegan a arrancárselas por unos Euros. Algo muy parecido a lo que los conquistadores hicieron a la fuerza con sus antepasados.A lo mejor encontraríamos un poco más de razón si en vez de recordar el 12 de octubre como un festejo por la sangrienta llegada de los espa?oles a nuestro continente, conmemoráramos el día anterior (11 del mismo mes) como el úLTIMO DíA DE LIBERTAD AMERICANA; una idea que está sonando desde hace ratos entre los intelectuales del continente y constituye una base para una memoria más sólida y más justa.<br>  <br>  Espero que te haya servido mi comentario Y NO OLVIDES QUE HOY (11/10) REECORDAMOS EL úLTIMO DíA DE LIBERTAD AMERICANA... te invito a comentar mi pregunta al respecto...<br>  <a href="http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag0asthYSS36kvEd.kSV6keA9gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20071011093612AAjPYCZ">http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ba43f273f730ad296258d821001f750aaa	Estimada Patry estas son dos respuestas que di a preguntas similares:<br>  <br>  Las conquistas siempre han representado un acto de fuerza,de violencia contra otras poblaciones generalmente mas debiles.Los "otros" tantos sean aborigenes de Australia,o las poblaciones de Africa "conquistadas" y luego mandadas como esclavos al nuevo mundo.<br>  "Los otros" ,entonces ,son aquellos pueblos sin historia que occidente se siente con el derecho a civilizar,evangelizar,conquistar,para convertirlos "en similares a nosotros".<br>  La conquista de America es la mas notable.En 1492 se inagura una de las mas cruentas invasiones de la historia que hara sentir sus efectos por al menos cuatro siglos.La invasion cometida por espa?oles y en mEnor medida portugueses,franceses,flamengos,ingleses y otros,para apoderaese de nuevas tierras para explotar en nombre de la civilizacion europea e incluso de la fe cristiana.<br>  En veinte a?os los europeos logran destruir las llamadas "civilizaciones precolombianas."<br>  No es una exageracion hablar de sometimiento,exterminio de dimensiones nunca vistas anteriormente.Los historiadores estan de cauerdo en considerar la poblacion del continente americano -antes de la llegada de los europeos- entre sesenta y cien millones. !

Es cierto que la llegada de los europeos provocó un holocausto de millones de amerindios por causa de la viruela y otras enfermedades causadas por virus y bacterias transmitidas por nuestros ganados ovinos y bovinos y para los cuales los europeos estabamos parcialmente inmunizados, pero ?no hubo intención de exterminio, todo lo contrario!.  Las Leyes de Indias favorecieron los matrimonios mixtos de americanos y espa?oles.  Además, los aborígenes nos transmitieron la sífilis, que para ellos era una enfermedad benigna y para el viejo continente fue una plaga hasta el descubrimiento del Salvarsán a principios del siglo veinte.<br>  Uno de los motores de la exploración y la conquista fue la búsqueda del oro y la plata, pero la corona de Castilla y la Iglesia se tomaron muy en serio su labor civilizadora y la cristianización.  Más de un millar de gramáticas y vocabularios de cientos de lenguas indígenas son testimonio de lo que afirmo.<br>  ?Qué hubiera pasado si los europeos no hubiésemos llegado a América en 1492?  Los amerindios hubiesen seguido en la Edad de Piedra, pasando hambre y peleándose en guerras contínuas ocasionadas entre otras razones por la falta de proteínas debido a la falta de grandes herbívoros que pudiesen ser domesticados (excepto los camélidos de los Andes que sólo lo son parcialmente).<br>  Los latinoamericanos a diferencia de los angloamericanos, dejáis que vuestro sentimiento de culpa -puesto que parcialmente sois descendientes de los conquistadores-, os impide ver la grandeza cultural y moral que significó la labor de Espa?a en América.<br>  Por citar sólo un ejemplo, los jesuitas realizaron en el Paraguay el primer ejemplo de que una sociedad socialista es posible  ?Nadie puede decir que el socialismo es un Utopía imposible, despues de su experiencia con los abipones que en pocos a?os sacó a unos indígenas que vivían en la Edad de Piedra y los llevaron a un alto grado de civilización.<br>  Como sefardita me niego a rechazar la Biblia,    por lo que hcieron los antiguos judíos hace 3.500 a?os en Canaan:  "Consagraron [los judíos] al anatema (herem) todo lo que había en la ciudad  [de Jericó], hombres y mujeres, jóvenes y viejos, bueyes, ovejas y asnos, a filo de espada"<br>  ( Josué 6, 21)<br>  Como espa?ol asumo que el camino de la Civilización europea, no sólo la espa?ola, se hizo con una cruz en una  mano y una espada en la otra.<br>  Pienso que sí tu Patry, te preocuparas más de como ayudar a los palestinos a tener un estado propio y como argentina te sintieras más orgullosa de tus antepasados espa?oles serías más feliz.<br>  Un abrazo y perdona mi vehemencia.<br>  Tu amigo<br>  Jaime<br>  Nota para Valenciano:<br>    Yo no he cambiado de ideas.  La despoblación de América en los siglos dieciséis y diecisiete es un hecho no discutido ni discutible.  Lo que afirmo es que los espa?oles no fueron en general los culpables, entre otras razones porque como encomenderos les interesaba el aumento de los amerindios.  Mis argumentos están respaldados por miles de documentos que puedo aportar.

Sin embargo, no olvidemos que nuestra historia es la historia de pueblos mestizos del sincretismo de la cultura hispana con los vestigios que quedaron de la cultura indígena. Eso es lo que conforma en la actualidad a nuestros pueblos y nuestra identidad. Es bastante difícil entonces reconocer que somos un pueblo netamente mestizo, ni indígena, ni hispano. Mestizos.  No hay tampoco que olvidar la fuerte contribución de la cultura africana y de otros pueblos europeos sobre nuestras actuales culturas y poblaciones latinoamericanas.<br>  Saludos!|`|eOAXPiVBaa	Los historiadores son un poco exagerados, por ejemplo aqui en Colombia nos dieron la independencia supuestamente que porque rompieron un florero, yo no creo que los espa?oles con lo grandes y poderosos que eran hayan dicho "Esta gente nos rompio un florero, mejor demosle la libertad e independencia"

Cuando Rama se entera dibuja un círculo protector a su alrededor y le pide que no salga de el bajo ningún pretexto. Un día el demonio Ravana se disfraza de mendigo y le pide comida a Sita, y ella se compadece de él, sale del círculo y es cuando Ravana la rapta. Cuando Rama se entera se va a buscarla al reino del demonio y junto a un grupo de monos "guerreros" la rescatan y matan a Ravana. Al final, el hermano que ocupaba el trono que le pertenecía inicialmente a Rama, decide devolverselo como premio a su valentia.

First you need some very good grade colored pencils: Lyra or Prismacolor are both good.  Then you need paper that is tough enough to take some layering, erasure, and that has enough tooth (smooth paper doesn't do well) to take up to 12 or more lightly applied layers of color.  (Canson Mei Tientes and Stonehenge Rising are two good ones.)<br>  <br>  I bet all the friends in the group image are not the same color.  I bet some have paler complexions, some pinker, some more tanned and you may even have ethnic friends with beautiful and exotic, deep skin tones. . . . DO NOT try to create them all with the same colors!  If you are working from a photo, take a piece of plain paper or a note card and punch a hole in it with a paper punch.  Now use this by placing it over the face of one of your subjects and study the color you see through the hole. . . isolating the skin  without the hair or eyes or other colors interfering.  Then, on a test piece of paper see which of your pencils (a combo of at least three colors will give a more realistic appearance, so don't just look for one "flesh" color) gets you the closest to the color of each face.   <br>  <br>  Next, make sure you have shadows in the picture you are using as reference, because shadows give depth and form to figures and faces.  If the photo was taken with a flash all of the faces will look flatter compared to one taken with the light off to the side, casting some shadows over the nose, under the chin,  and into the eyes.   Then study the colors of the shadows.  You should see that they are not just darker versions of the skin tone, but rather have reds, purples and blues in them, even if in tiny quantities. In fact, study faces on television and you will see that all sorts of colors belong in skin-tones!    You don't have to draw perfect likenesses of your friends if you are able to capture their personalities through the use of position, colors, and other expressive means.  <br>  If you are not going for hyper-realism, but rather caricatures or more simplified cartoon-like images for this piece,  then you can limit your colors to just a few for flesh tones: pale yellow, pale gold, muted orange, pink, a soft orange-red, red, maroon or burgundy, rust or terracotta, some peach, and some dark brown, dark red, even dark violet . . . and black.  Use the black only for accents and emphasis (eyes and darkest points in shadows) . .  otherwise make your darks out of two or three layers of dark blues, reds and greens . .  . which will render a near-black dark without it becoming overwhelming.  A realistic face takes a good deal of time, but a simplified more stylized face can be done in peach, pink, orange, red and brown.  If it gets too pinkish, a light layer of golden yellow will warm it and tone it down a bit.  <br>  <br>  One thing I forgot to mention . . . get a couple of french greys, like a light, medium, and dark.  Use them for things that you think should be white, like teeth and eyes, otherwise your portraits will look funny, because the teeth and whites of the eyes, if done in WHITE, will jump off the paper at you!  Because the eyes and teeth are almost always in shadow, they should be done in a soft, but lighter, shade of grey.  If they sparkle you can put a dot or splash of highlight on them and they will look more real. In fact, shadows and highlights will do more (if used cautiously) to make your work look great than almost anything else.  Stay away from making everything the same shade or value . . . that spells boring and it just too easy to avoid! <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Post it when you get done.  <br>  <br>  There are several colored pencil artists online with good tutorials.  Just google "colored pencil portraits and you will find many.  Ann Kullburg is a good one; I have taken her workshop on portraits.  Compare several who do portraits, and you will see what I mean about depth and form, as even though an artist has a fancy website, some of them do not really go beyond copying exactly what they see in the photo, and their images go flat.  <br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|D4kf47swaa	You can try the mail order end of Hobby Lobby which is  Crafts Etc. They carry a useful set of colored pencils by a German company called LYRA  the set is #934w12 (LYRAS #). In 12 pencils they have a full range of skin tones. Take 2 of your lower value pencils as undertones. 1 or 2 as your middle values for the surface of the skin and 1 as your high value or highlight. You should be able to render any skin tone with these and they sell for under $20.

Por eso la mayor parte de los hombres la temen tanto".<br>  <br>  De acuerdo con el gran Bernard Shaw, la libertad conlleva gran responsabilidad tanto a nivel personal como social, estamos tan acostumbrados a vivir en nuestro circulo de conformidad que nos da miedo salir y tomar nuestras propias decisiones asumiendo las consecuencias de nuestros actos.<br>  La libertad se ejerce mejor cuando va acompa?ada de responsabilidad. La fórmula es sencilla: a mayor libertad, mayor responsabilidad. En otras palabras, sólo se es libre mientras los demás son libres. La libertad de uno supone, entonces, la libertad de los demás. Para lograrlo, es preciso actuar con responsabilidad tanto en el uso de la palabra, como en la acción personal y colectiva. <br>  Porque la libertad implica el respeto por los sentimientos ajenos....por eso pensar y actuar con libertad implica responsabilidad...después de todo la responsabilidad evita que la liberdad se vuelva libertinaje....<br>  <br>  "No busquemos solemnes definiciones de la libertad. Ella es sólo esto: Responsabilidad." George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) Escritor irlandés. <br>  <br>  "El verdadero buscador crece y aprende, y descubre que siempre es el principal responsable de lo que sucede." Jorge Bucay (1949-?)

amo1xUG4aa	Hola Monique!<br>  Me da gusto tenerte entre mis amigos. <br>  Gracías!<br>  <br>  Tu pregunta no es para responder, livianamente, pues merece una profunda reflexión acerca de nosotros mismos en tanto sujetos, y qué significa ser "libres", desde el punto de vista filosófico.<br>  <br>  En primer lugar qué somos?<br>  Conformamos una Unidad, cuerpo-mente - Alma-Espíritu . <br>  Somos seres Poderosos, sabios, Inteligentes, con una perfecta biología<br>  Pero nos visualizamos e identificamos más por el lado material, cuerpo-mente, pues  IGNORAMOS  cuál es nuestra Verdadera Naturaleza, de donde provenimos y hacia donde nos dirirgimos.<br>  <br>  En la conformación de nuestro aspecto material intervienen factores genéticos y hereditarios, y en la personalidad interactúan tanto el contexto familiar, como Social, económico y político.<br>  Este último contexto nos da pautas de comportamiento que van conformando una estructura sistemática egoica en crecimiento.<br>  <br>  Desde el punto de vista de la estructuración de la personalidad , desde el "ego", suponemos que elegimos conforme a nuesros gustos. Y como tú muy bien lo se?alas diciendo "Alguien nos lo ha ense?ado... ideas creencias, modos de vida" todo dentro de ese mismo sistema que nos "amolda" a fin de poder dar sustento al mismo sistema del cual emergemos para sostenerlo en una espiral contiunua que se retroalimenta.<br>  <br>  De este modo las elecciones que hagamos están sujetas a los aprendizajes previos, que sin darnos cuenta, sin ser concientes de ello, caemos en la creencia que somos "libres" de elegir.<br>  Vivimos en un mundo donde lo habitual es competir en lugar de compartir, mezquinar en lugar de solidarizarse,  apropiarse de la misma Tierra en lugar de respetarla, atropellar y destruír a otros matándolos o arrasando  distintas culturas para que un selecto grupo se sienta importante y poderoso.<br>  Todos éstos, actos movidos por injusticias y falta de empatía provenientes de nuestro "ego" .<br>  <br>  Así las cosas.......... CREEMOS, que "elegimos" y que somos libres.<br>  NO. Nada más desacertado que eso!!<br>  <br>  La razón de nuestra existencia NO ES MATERIAL. Es ESPIRITUAL, eso ignoramos.<br>  La evolución del ser humano no está relacionada a la cantidad de bienes ni de posesiones, eso nos ata a los aspectos más densos que son inherentes a la materia.<br>  <br>  La Verdadera LIBERTAD, es poder desprenderse de todos los aspectos materiales , es abrir la prisión en la que estamos encerrados. Es tomar la decisión de abrir esa puerta, saber que la llave de esa puerta la tenemos y la tuvimos siempre en nuestro poder, y que lo ignoramos.<br>  <br>  La verdadera Libertad, se alcanza al elevarse a los aspectos más elevados de nuestro SER, de nuestro núcleo interior, desplegando nuestro verdadero Poder, todos los conocimientos y la sabiduría que por eones fuimos acumulando, es expandir nuestra consciencia, descubrir sentidos que no sabemos que tenemos, ampliar la consciencia para despertar nuestros aspectos dormidos de nuestro cerebro, que usa un porcentaje ínfimo 3-7%. Lo desconocemos!! No sabemos quienes somos. Tenemos que descubrirlo. Desarrollarlo. Estimularnos, Confiar en nosotros. Saber qué somos. <br>  Esto mi querida Monique es evolución.<br>  <br>  Darnos la oportunidad de abrir la puerta y animarnos a conocer la LIBERTAD es desplegar las alas para lanzarnos hacia las alturas para poder realizar un bello y  majestuoso vuelo que nos lleve por fin al lugar al cual pertenecemos sin regresar nunca más a la prisión material............

Sin embargo, Modi, como le llamaban sus amigos, dejó su país en 1906 y se marchó a París, epicentro del arte europeo e imán que atrajo a muchos artistas extranjeros hambrientos de fama.<br>  Modigliani se instaló primero en la zona de Montmartre y después en el bohemio barrio de Montparnasse, no muy lejos de otro artista "buscafortunas" que respondía al nombre de Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), con quien mantendría a la postre una famosa rivalidad.<br>  Pese a su salud ya frágil desde la adolescencia, Modi se embarcó en una vida disoluta marcada por la bebida (no en vano, solía cobrar en alcohol sus cuadros), las drogas, las broncas y una larga lista de deudas en bares y burdeles que le acabarían pasando factura.<br>  Modigliani descubrió en París el arte africano, muy influyente en su carrera, pero rechazó corrientes como el cubismo argumentando: "No voy a usar ninguno de los peque?os trucos de Picasso".<br>  Cuando otros artistas pintaban bodegones y paisajes, Modi apostó por la forma humana y creó un estilo único caracterizado por el vivo color y los ojos almendrados, las bocas peque?as, las narices torcidas y los cuellos alargados de sus retratos.<br>  Apuesto y con vocación de donjuán, Amedeo tuvo muchos amoríos hasta que conoció a la escritora y poeta británica Beatrice Hastings, quien fue su novia durante dos a?os y le sirvió de modelo.<br>  Un ejemplo de esa relación es el óleo 'Beatrice Hasting en frente de la puerta' (1915), un retrato apacible que refleja el momento más dulce de un idilio salpicado de borracheras violentas que terminó en 1915 y al que siguió a?os después el suicidio de la musa.<br>  Después de otras aventuras amorosas, Modigliani se casó con Jeanne Hébuterne, una estudiante de arte a quien su familia repudió por contraer matrimonio con el "artista maldito".<br>  Modi, quien dijo una vez que "pintar una mujer es poseerla", retrató a su esposa una treintena de veces, como en el cuadro "Jeanne Hébuterne" (1919), en el que la joven aparece con un largo camisón blanco después de dar a luz a su primer hijo.<br>  La muestra también ofrece la oportunidad de contemplar una decena de sus desnudos femeninos, tan provocadores por la mirada lasciva de alguna modelos, sus pechos redondeados y la presencia de vello púbico, que escandalizaron al París más conservador de la época.<br>  Asimismo, el espectador puede ver retratos de algunos contemporáneos de Modi, como el de Picasso y el del también artista espa?ol Juan Gris (1887-1927), pintados ambos en 1915.<br>  Tras una vida de excesos, Amedeo Modigliani murió el 24 de enero de 1920 a la edad de 35 a?os, víctima de una meningitis tuberculosa.<br>  Dos días más tarde, Jeanne Hébuterne, embarazada de nueve meses, se suicidó arrojándose desde el quinto piso de un hotel. Modi y Jeanne descansan hoy en el cementerio parisino de Pére-Lachaise

Uft26WqXaa	Veramente non saprei, comunque è stimolante. Io sono un'amante dei fiori, puoi provare quanlche decorazione con graminacee secche che trovi sui margini delle strade, da legare con fili di rafia natuarle. Farti mettere da parte delle spighe di grano o di orzo da legare con nastri colorati a quadretti o a strisce. Poi a settembre dovresti trovare le infiorescenze secche del cardo dei lanaioli (Dipsacus fullonum), che riconosci benissimo per essere una sorta di carciofo sfiorito, molto pungente, alto anche due metri. Ti assicuro che è molto decorativo. <br>  Per non buttare il tutto sul "foglie secche e colori autunnali" puoi ravvivare con sacchetti, cache pot, portamatite molto colorati, magari smaltati, in modo da ottenere un effetto provenzale. Magari una vecchia sedia impagliata, un cappello di paglia con un nastro di pizzo, chessò, roba così. <br>  Oppure che ne diresti di stendere libri e quaderni sui fili della biancheria, facendo pendere anche un vecchio oblò di lavatrice? <br>  Credo che per settembre sarà uscito il film su beatrix Potter, forse i coniglietti saranno di moda. <br>  Oppure puoi far fare delle sfilate ai piccoli oggetti, travestire i compassi da ballerine, scrivere delle lettere con i temperini o le gomme. <br>  Puoi dipingerti da te un quadro astratto tipo mondrian e mettere libri che facciano contrasto...e boh, non mi viene in mente altro....|`|d4vlazXhaa	Ad Amsterdam pui trovare dei buoni spunti|`|8qNgdbA9aa	potresti utilizzare del materiale di uso comune tipo cornici per quadri, ruote di macchine e tutto ciò che è possibile colorare con una pittura di colore molto accesa...

gtd6ob2eaa	I think the idea is that physical laziness will lead to spiritual and moral laziness. Lazy people might be "too tired" to go to church or pray regularly. Laziness is also selfish and self-indulgent; selfishness is most often at the base of the "deadly sins" because by being self-centred we cannot be God-centred.|`|734JWQhxaa	I like the linking of the sloth (laziness) with economics, but it is not entirely relevant. That is, they are opposed to virtue rather then action. That is, simply looking at a young lady and going ‘oh she’s hot’ is possibly lust but not the mortal (deadly) sin of lust. Sitting there fantasizing about having sex with her is. <br>  <br>  In the case of sloth it is not just simply laziness, but sort of like a ‘spoiled brat’ attitude. That is, that ‘everything should just be given to me’, ‘I do not want to have to put any effort into anything’.  Therefore it does have an economic link, the anti-laziness focus of the puritans was one of the major developing ideas which created capitalism.  The idea was that, if I love you then I should work to the best of my ability so I will not be a burden on you. (of course the puritans where not known for their love, but that was the ideal anyway)<br>  <br>  However, it did not apply only to working/not working, but in the importance of doing yu work well, or not being lazy in it. That is, a warrior at their post who is being lazy and not performing their duty with effort places their entire unit at risk. A coworker who is always goofing off and rarely works, may be able to avoid being fired, but their coworkers have to work harder then they should have to and typically builds up ill feelings.  <br>  <br>  As for gluttony, it is not simply eating too much, it is a focusing on your own needs to the point they are an idol. It is an obsession of food if you will. A person who orders a meal and then only eats half, making a show of it, can very well be a glutton as well. <br>  <br>    With all this said, your questions of ‘ Is being economically useful considered moral from a Christian standpoint? Are people who make more money then considered more moral?’ Is very insightful. While the biblical answer would be that they are not related (in fact, Paul speaks against the favoritism the church shows to the rich), however, the puritan influence on American theology has more or less united ‘economic usefulness’ with morality. Because someone is smart enough (or lucky enough) to have navigated the world in a way in which they have accumulated wealth does equate to many that they must know what they are talking about when they speak of spiritual things. And there are even some churches that teach that it ‘proves’ their faith in God. <br>   <br>   Basically, the answer to your question is that the link which was formed between economics and Christian morality goes back to the fifties and such when the main-stream culture tried to make being a ‘good Christian’ and a ‘good American’ the same thing. And so the line between what was best for America got blurred with what is best for our faith.|`|JEXRA10Haa	Kindof on a weirder track think about Full Metal Alchemist the anime.  The Homunculous that the Elric Brothers ended up creating from the transmutation of their mother was Sloth.<br>  <br>  Now lets run through the others in the anime so you get my point that we know the reasons why they were created.<br>  <br>  Pride: Is Dante's masterwork, a Homunculus that ages.<br>  <br>  Lust:  The product of Scar's brother's transmutation of his lover.  If he really loved the woman he would have let her go and not sacrificed all those people.  On a side note, notice what he lost in the transmutation sacrifice.<br>  <br>  Wrath:  Created from the child that the Elric's teacher had.  Her feelings of hatred towards herself are manifested in the child's attitude.<br>  <br>  Avrice/Greed:  Dante and Hoenheim's wishes for greater power and longer life can easily explain his creation, with similar ideas behind Gluttony.<br>  <br>  Envy:  Probably jealousy over not being able to keep his child while others in the world were able to keep theirs is an explained for Envy.<br>  <br>  Which leaves Sloth.<br>  <br>  Sloth:  The reason that Ed and Al believe they failed in the transmutation is twofold.  1.  They initially think that they must not have studied hard enough.<br>  2.  They did not have the wisdom to listen to others and accept the change that their mother was dead and there was nothing they could do about it.<br>  <br>  The first is clearly and act of sloth and the other, because of their lack of acceptance, kept their lives at a stagnate point in which there was no movement.|`|b2d2004dec765febfc0780f19334a6f0aa	I remember a lesson in Sunday school a while back and was pretty surprised to hear this, but EVERYTIME you do not do your best, it is a sin.

b1mFenX2aa	He was a tea smuggler. <br>  <br>  Hancock organized a boycott of tea from China sold by the British East India Company(later Boston tea party).  By 1773, the company had large debts, huge stocks of tea in its warehouses and no prospect of selling it because smugglers, such as Hancock, were importing tea without paying import taxes. <br>  <br>   I can tell you more about him. He was one of the protesters. In 1768, Hancock's ship Liberty was seized by customs officials, and he was charged with smuggling. He was defended by John Adams, and the charges were eventually dropped. However, Hancock later faced several hundred more indictments.|`|4nHWMbdYaa	"At first only a financier of the growing rebellion, he later became a public critic of British rule. On March 5, 1774, the fourth anniversary of the Boston Massacre, he gave a speech strongly condemning the British. In the same year, he was unanimously elected president of the Provisional Congress of Massachusetts, and presided over its Committee of Safety. Under Hancock, Massachusetts was able to raise bands of "minutemen"—soldiers who pledged to be ready for battle in a minute's notice—and his boycott of tea imported by the British East India Company eventually led to the Boston Tea Party.<br>  <br>  In April 1775 as the British intent became apparent, Hancock and Samuel Adams slipped away from Boston to elude capture, staying in the Hancock-Clarke House in Lexington, Massachusetts (which can still be seen to this day). There Paul Revere roused them about midnight before the British troops arrived at dawn for the Battle of Lexington and Concord. At this time, General Thomas Gage ordered Hancock and Adams arrested for treason. Following the battle a proclamation was issued granting a general pardon to all who would demonstrate loyalty to the crown—with the exceptions of Hancock and Adams. On May 24, 1775, he was elected the third President of the Second Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph. He would serve until October 30, 1777, when he was himself succeeded by Henry Laurens.<br>  <br>  In the first month of his presidency, on June 19, 1775, Hancock commissioned George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. A year later, Hancock sent Washington a copy of the July 4, 1776 congressional resolution calling for independence as well as a copy of the Declaration of Independence."<br>  <br>  so, I think his opinion was "get out of town" before you get noosed in the town.|`|bmCa09TIaa	he didnt like it

Dante ,Camoes e Shakespeare ,para so' citar os maiores mestres dessa forma que sobrevive quase sem alteracao ha' 700 anos .<br>  Soneto e' uma composisao poetica de14 versos,em general rimados e dispostos em quatro estrofes,duas de quatro e duas de tres versos.<br>  Admite numero restrito a forma e segue normas rigorosas quando ao conteudo e tema .<br>   A rigidez de seus tracos possibilitou que atingisse o fim do seculo XX intacto , tal como o praticavam aqueles que o fixaram :Dante ,Petrarca ,Shakespeare,Camoes e outros classicos.<br>  Ao que tudo indica ,o soneto foi criado na Sicilia, onde era cantado na corte de Frederico II da mesma forma que as tradicionais baladas provencais. Na primeira metade do seculo XIII,porem ,Giacomo da Lentino inventou o soneto como especie de cancao ou de letra escrita para musica . <br>   Tinha um principio par ,o da oitava, seguindo por um principio impar,o dos tercetos ,devido a mudanca da melodia na segunda parte . Lentino deu assim uma forma fixa concisa e breve ao soneto.<br>   O numero de linhas e a disposicao de suas rimas ,no entanto, permaneceram variaveis por algum tempo. No fim do seculo XIII ,sua forma foi sistematizada por Guittone d'Arezzo e experimentada por Dante e Guido Cavalcanti . Foi Petrarca ,contudo, quem difundiu o soneto em toda a Europa .<br>  Essa composicao poetica aderiu,nos seculos seguintes ,ao humanismo e tambem a devocao barroca. Na Franca do seculo XVI,esse formato tornou-se um dos principais meios de expresao de Ronsard,  Du Bellay e Etienne Jodelle ,do grupo da Pleiade. No Sglo de Oro espanhol, que se estendeu da segunda metade do seculo XV ate o fim do XVII, marcou as obras de Garcilaso de la Vega , Gongora ,Lope de Vega e Quevedo. Chegou em Portugal trazido por Sa' de Miranda e foi levado a perfeicao por Camoes.  Na Inglaterra,consagrou-se a variante de tres quartetos e um distico final , o chamado soneto ingles ou shakespeariano , sempre em decassilabos .O soneto resistiu ao desprezo dos iluminaristas e foi cultivado,no seculo XIX ,por romanticos, parnasianos e simbolistas. No seculo XX sobreviveu a revolucao do verso livre modernista<br>  e se destacou na obra de modernistas  radicais como Guillaume  Apollinaire , Rafael Alberti e Fernando Pessoa.<br>   O Brasil teve sonetistas de primeira linha em Manuel Botelho de Oliveira ,no seculo XVII, Caudio Manoel da Costa ,no XVIII , e Alphonsus de Guimaraens e Cruz e Sousa,no XIX . Modernistas como Manuel Bandeira e Crlos Drummond de Andrade tambem demontraram algumas vezes maestria no soneto. O soneto voltou a aparecer em obras de Vinicius de Moraes ,Jorge de Lima e Mario Faustino ...<br>  <br>  espero ter ajudado ... nao esqueca os 10 pontos ..ok|`|70dac6098818e6db9f11390b4fb8f134aa	dois quartetos(4 versos)<br>  doi tercetos (3 versos)|`|IRELMIszaa	O soneto é formado por catorze versos que formam quatro estrofes sendo dois quartetos(estrofes de 4 versos) e dois<br>  tercetos(estrofes de 3 versos).|`|0lqPq30gaa	é formado por uma oitava e dois tercetos.|`|26F4bVjUaa	q isto?|`|yceG4nFxaa	Oi Guilherme<br>  Modernamente, o soneto vem assumindo formas bem mais livres, como, por exemplo, escrito em versos brancos ou sem rimas ou até sem metrifica??o.

Apesar do vasto espa?o de tempo que os separa, eles guardam uma semelhan?a que vai muito além da submiss?o ao formato clássico: para Vinicius de Moraes, os sonetos eram uma via de acesso ao sublime, mesmo quando essa eleva??o se processava por meio da linguagem prosaica do cotidiano aparentemente banal.<br>  Este é um atributo que sempre acompanhou o poeta: o poder de vislumbrar transcendência nas pequenas coisas. Nas m?os de Vinicius, os sonetos tornam-se um instrumento exigente e delicado, manejado com firmeza para sensibilizar a crista de banalidade que envolve o mundo real. Tornam-se ainda um recurso sofisticado que permite ao poeta contactar, com mais eficácia, a alma de outros artistas que tinha em alta conta, como Katherine Mansfield, Otávio de Faria, Candido Portinari e Sergei Eisenstein.<br>  Esta edi??o do Livro de sonetos reúne também nove sonetos inéditos, pescados no baú de raridades que Vinicius de Moraes deixou com a família e que hoje está sob a guarda competente do Museu de Literatura da Funda??o Casa de Rui Barbosa, no Rio de Janeiro.

La mayoría de las veces, es la atracción personal la que influirá para formar una pareja. Algunas características de la atracción son: <br>  <br>  La personalidad <br>  Nivel socio-económico <br>  Nivel cultural <br>  Atributos físicos <br>  Edad <br>  Valores y filosofía ante la vida <br>  Seguridad y apoyo <br>  Expectativas concientes e inconscientes. <br>  El problema es que no pensamos conscientemente en estos factores y mucho menos los hablamos. No decimos qué esto es lo que esperamos de nuestra pareja, solo damos por hecho de que así será; casi siempre queda solo en nuestra mente y pareciera que mágicamente así se dará. Lo cual desencadena muchos de los fracasos y separaciones de las parejas.|`|lxVbqMBRaa	Bueno creo que la respuesta tu la tienes, es una ley universal, todos la hemos experimentado inconcientemente, es como tu pregunta, atrajo nuestras respuestas, asi todo lo que tu piensas con sierto temor o deseo, pueden venir a ti, y ademas si tienes una actitud negativa atraes eso, o al contrario, pero no debes estar temiendo que no funcione o revisando si en realidad pasa, porque eso lo cambia...

HpbTetUJaa	Hi, I'm an animator too, or I'm a newbie to animation at least. I've been only doing it around 10 months now, and I must say Maya is not the program you need to use. <br>  Maya is a very high end 3D software, the likes of which is used by animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks etc. <br>  You need to start small :)<br>  What I've done is get a lightbox, and some economy standard A4 animation paper. I didn't learn anything at first and started doing a walk cycle of how I thought it would look, and when I scanned it in it was awful haha. Then I looked at movement (it was a cat you see) and I watched footage of how cats walk, and I created a new one, which was this:<br>  <a href="http://ditto9.deviantart.com/art/Walking-kitty-cat-71056614" rel="nofollow">http://ditto9.deviantart.com/art/Walking...</a><br>  <br>  You dont need a style first. The most important thing in animation is do get your movement first. The whole idea of animation is to not make something look real, but to make the viewer believe it is alive. <br>  Drop the anime, I only do anime for still illustrations. Watching anime, you can see most of them are barely animated frames. Most are just still graphics with moving eyes and mouths. <br>  <br>  Also, whilst you're starting small, aim for advice from those at the top. Read books such as<br>  'The Animators Survival Guide' by Richard Williams<br>  and even stuff like 'Understanding Comics' by Scott McCloud (who is a genius in the art of the psycological way we read comics etc). <br>  Reading books by these people will help you gain the views that Animators must take to create the animation. <br>  <br>  Get Adobe Flash, if you want to do a computer themed animation or programs such as ToonBoom Studio. <br>  If you do like 3D animations and thats the way you want to go, still start off on paper and cel before tackling the big boys tools. I'm still avoiding Flash until I start my Animation Degree in september this year. <br>  <br>  I hope you get far with your animation :) I've always wanted to be an animator since I was about 5-6 (seeing the Lion King). But do not dive in the deep end before you learn to swim :).<br>  <br>  If you wanna ask me anything, email me on here if you want :) I dont mind. I'm only a newbie too, but now I've started reading properly about things, it puts my mind ahead of people that havent. Trust me, it helps loads!!|`|KIuvcO4Baa	hey.. well do be honest iam only 12 yrs old....i've been working on photoshop for 2 yrs now and i guess iam an expert.... i too have started with Maya (unlimited) and the only solution is to really put in ur efforts for this software...nothing comes easy....i hope u've heard of Final Fantasy the movies...well i really admired part 7( advent of Children) the animation inspired me even more!!! coz u can see how much the field has improved...i've never taken any animation or graphics classes in my life .... so i think u can master this software and future ones with just hard work.. there r soo many websites on how to learn maya...

HORACAnlaa	Karma was imagined in the first place to justify the caste system. If your on top of the dog pile think what a great advantage it must have been to tell those below you, politically, that it was because of karma. You get to say I was a great person in my past life and you were not so that's why I am on top. <br>  <br>  The reason people believe in it today is it's mystical junk food. It appeals to our notions of fairness and makes them into a metaphysical certainty. Of course, it is all in the mind of the person believing it but it solves, in their own minds, the problem of evil. Evil people will get it in the end because morality, karma, is build into the foundations of the world. Sadly it is not true and there is no easy answer to the problem of evil. |`|BZIscz2Qaa	I don't believe in Kharma, b/c I don't believe that life is fair.

She has two options:<br>  <br>  either she can spend her life using all the energy in her to hate, or she can be better than the ppl who raped her and try to spread love and peace.  She sounds like a great person who bad things have happened to, and I'm really sorry for her.  I hope this helps.  |`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	God doesn't give you more than you can handle.  (joke)<br>  The fact is, **** happens and **** happens to good people.  So, I am with you that karma is a load of bollocks.  I am sorry for your friends misfortune.  Hope the rest of her life is beautiful.|`|dl97DmmYaa	I pray to God to heal the wounds of your friend. <br>  <br>  Karma is an Indian philosophy of reincarnation of souls.  It is not a Christian belief.  In Karma, life evolves since the beginning of time until it finds a body good enough to finish the job of the soul reincarnate.  <br>  <br>  Thus, a cow is holy and a rat is venerated.  To them these animals are the reincarnation of their grandparents.  Silly it may seem though, but Indians accept them as true.  <br>  <br>  In the case of your friend, I am distressed by her life tragedies.  Why does she or you report the incident to the police?  Since the suspects are known to her let them be apprehended and jailed and pay the consequences of their acts.<br>  <br>  Please E-mail me at renecaparas@yahoo.com for more.|`|gDHsx5I3aa	I do believe in karma because i see it occur in my own life. However, i am also a strong believer in 'everything happens for a reason'. That is a pretty sensitive issue to talk about and i certainly don't know your friend at all, but i'm sure it's changed her as a person. Maybe 10 years down the road she will become a volunteer counsellor at a women's shelter and help other women who have gone through similar traumatic experiences (in relation to the everything happens for a reason saying) but i don't know.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you can say to your friend, i don't think talking to her about karma is going to change her frame of mind at all at this point in time. Your friend needs to talk to a professional, perhaps a psychologist. I'm sorry to hear about your friend, we do live in a sad world.|`|opQVE4UWaa	The whole idea of 'karma' is rubbish. The fact is you're either born lucky or you're not. For a lot of people, life is just one piece of sh!t on top of another. There's no explanation. Trying to find answers through 'karma' is pointless.<br>  Some people sail through life, they get all the lucky breaks, they have the good job, wife/husband, kids, house, car etc. Other people, such as myself, get heaps of sh!t thrown at them everyday. <br>  Life's a ***** and then you die. And I for one am hoping there's no reincarnation. Because once around on this frigging planet is more than enough for me.|`|db4364cbdfee80cd73b4e6424bc57dfdaa	Sorry I do not speak English well, I am Brazilian.<br>  <br>    <br>  To believe in  karma implicates in knowing the reincarnation.  It is a mistake to think that the law of the karma is the law of the eye for eye, tooth for tooth, her friend has to have the sublime capacity to pray God asking for forces to support their pains and not to ask to HIM revenge and yes the fair feather for who offended her.      <br>  You should pray God and to ask for her but above all who hurt her it, they planted and they will pick.       <br>  The planting is free, the  the crop is obligatory.|`|q57P8uJbaa	I would not call it karma, but eventually the wicked will reap what they sow.<br>  <br>  For those who believe, there are two gifts from God that break the philosophy of karma; mercy and grace.  Mercy is God not giving us what we deserve as far as punishment, and grace is God giving us what we don't deserve as far as salvation.|`|cLlY0pE5aa	karma is simply the cause and effect of many lives. If you were evil in a previous life, you have bad karma built up that will "find you". If you were good in a previous life, you will be "rewarded". But no matter what happens to you, just remember whatever you send out will come back. Those guys will suffer in other lifetimes probably....thats the law of karmic effects.|`|OhoWOeDraa	I am a Buddhist and believe strongly in Karma and my theory is that what those men did will put them in many horrible lives and your very unfortunate friend will reach nirvana or have a very good next life. karma isnt always based on the past but what you do now.|`|UBdLtCleaa	how about instant karma (great song btw)|`|XaL7cAqNaa	experience.|`|83oDxEepaa	People often wonder "why me?" and they might feel that the universe picks on them. I thought about this before when i first got into the concept of karma. Anyway, the conclusion I came up with is that sometimes the bad comes first, but the universe has its way of balancing things out. Rest assured those horrible men will get what is coming to them and your friend will get what she deserves somewhere down the road. It seems like a very shitty deal but maybe she will end up finding the love of her life, someone who is perfect who can treat her right and make her very happy for the rest of her life. that's the way i see it. Sometimes people have to suffer but it all works out in the end. I used to think that i got the crap end of everything (nowhere near what your friend had to go through, and i couldn't imagine what that would be like) but i took a good look at all of the good that has happened to me also. I hope this helps!|`|Q8etYn60aa	That definitely sounds really rough.  I'm a believer in Karma though, and I think a lot of things are all about how you view them.  I'm sure that right now it probably seems to her like the whole world is out to get her, but years down the road, she'll realize what all this BS has done for her.  She'll be an incredibly strong person for all that she's been through and she'll truely gain from it some day, even if it's decades from now.  And trust me, those terrible people who have done her wrong... everything will come back and haunt then- again, even if it's years down the road.<br>  <br>  Karma has a lot to do with the concept of reincarnation.  I'm not sure if she believes in that or not, but I do.  In her next life time, she'll move so far up from where she is now, and these wrong-do-ers are going to regret everything when they are the doormat that everyone walks over... literally :P|`|5HyuJ3Bwaa	Do you believe in past lives? I'm not saying that it is real or not but that is one explanation. there is also the belief that she will one day be rewarded for all the crap she has to put up with. Or my theory is that her purpose in the next world demands a strength that can only come through suffering. And hey look at the bright side at least she has family and friends who support her and love her. Remember you are only as good as the people that hold you up.|`|AA10406018	I agree with you.I don't believe in Karma either.We simply can not offer any explanation for the happenings here.Call it 'will of God or Karma'.In a limited sense one may say you are responsible for what happens to you.It saves you from self pity and helps to develop a robust attitude to carry on.|`|1a0238d3b13ee2953fca8fa323eed7f0aa	its always darkest before the dawn|`|2Dgor1PCaa	if it dosent exists what keeps the world in balance|`|0dn9A2Esaa	because of EARL     hey crabman|`|WIbWermLaa	i dont believe|`|9dTsrcL2aa	As tragic as these events are, and I am truly devastated to hear of such treatment, I'm not sure Karma is a belief in vengeance or revenge. Now the idea of "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord" is more the belief that the ultimate power will see to it that all "sins" are punished appropriately. Karma, as far as I understand it and believe, is the idea that the energy you put out not only affects the people in the world but that that energy will return to you. So, if you strive to put out positive energy, at some point, that energy will be returned to you. So what I would say to your friend is this: Even if you believe in Karma it doesn't mean that when bad things happen to you it's because Karma. Your friend had no say in what happened to her and honestly, those men may never get what she or any other human feels they deserve. However, I believe that people who act in such a way will always be punished for it. Now, does that mean those men will be heinously beaten or locked away forever? Not necessarily. But... energy like that will eat a person up from the inside out. And while they may enjoy what they are doing... they won't always. They are sick people who, I believe, will eventually become overpowered by that sickness and the eventual revelation of what they did. All that if they are not punished first. But just try to comfort your friend and let her know that it's not her fault. We don't know why bad things happen to good people. But it is said that those who can handle the most are given the most which means your friend is probably a very strong soul.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|l4Pprcnbaa	YOu reap what you sow <br>  <br>  what goes around comes around<br>  <br>  Karma she'll get you every time<br>  <br>  curses return tenfold<br>  <br>  an eye for an eye <br>  <br>  I think it's a commonplace concept among all cultures religions and belief systems.....What I find fascinating is to watch it happen to people and they still deny they don't deserve....but then again who am I to judge? And I have also heard it said if you enjoy another's misfortune karma will get you too....hmmm it's interesting though huh...great question....and yeah I think it does happen just not often enough or quick enough.....it sux that this has happened to her and honestly those horrible people who allowed and did this I have faith that Karma will get and when she does I truly hope it's the worst...with that said I think that is a just and fair judgement considering the circumstances.

NSXPDySgaa	Hola poeta dulce! Muchas Felicidades!<br>  Tienes la maravillosa capacidad de fundir la naturaleza con gestos y sentimientos humanos... eso me encanta!<br>  Cuando leí tus palabras me puse a pensar en los besos más allá de mi sentimiento actual, más allá de hablar sobre la experiencias que una ha cosechado... Me transporté a la infancia, a esos momentos donde un beso era "robado", donde recibir un beso era una experiencia nueva, un lugar aún desconocido y con tanto por explorar. O aquellos momentos de ni?as en donde simplemente daba asco con solo pensar tocar la boca del otro (aunque deseabas que suceda). Esa época en que un beso era sinónimo de mejilla y si algún nene "por error" lo daba en la boca, la primera reacción era limpiarse con el brazo. <br>  También me acordé de aquellos momentos de adolescente cuando una deseaba con todas las ganas bailar el tema lento con el chico que te gustaba para estar cerquita de su boca... Me di cuenta, recordando todo esto, que el beso tenía una importancia muy grande, muy esperada. Tanto como luego en la adultez fue el momento del sexo.<br>  En fin, besos, recuerdos, momentos, canciones, aromas, adolescencia, infancia. Instantáneas que se suceden en mi memoria. El primer beso, el primer rechazo, el primer lento, el primer acercamiento. Las primeras rupturas, las primeras discusiones, las primeras lágrimas de "amor adolescente".<br>  <br>  Toodo mi cari?o Rafa!|`|u27eTO0waa	Siiiiiiiiiiiiii pibeeeeeeeee creo que llego esa hora para mi, y me hace feliz muy pero muy feliz... es tanta la felicidad que me estoy permitiendo recibir que ya no tengo tanto el monitor de una pc frente a mi sino la mirada del amor...<br>  <br>  No hay una completa desnudez<br>  en tus miradas hacia el deseo despierto del amor.<br>  <br>  Con esta me quedo!<br>  Beso pibe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0WNAF2OFaa	He escuchado que hay un planeta X, o de nombre Hercolubus, y lo que sé es que se acerca a nuestro sistema solar y que tiene una fuerza gravitatoria increible, y referente al tama?o dicen que es más grande que jupiter.

X1iLNBjuaa	El intelectivo depende de la ciencia... herramienta con ya probados límites... el conocimiento es precario en tanto a su consecución absoluta... no tanto en cuanto a su utilidad... en cuanto al conocimiento sensible... está simplemente allí... a disposición de quien lo desee...<br>  <br>  Suerte.|`|rUnVYvsLaa	Querida Pau,<br>  <br>  Para mi ciertamente que si.....me basta plantarme ante una noche con su ***** manto estrellado, viendo a lo lejos las estrellas fugaces pasar y darme cuenta cuan peque?a soy y como en muchas ocasiones me siento el centro del universo y ante el universo cuajado de estrellas percibir que no soy nada y comprender que tampoco se nada y es entonces cuando mi cuerpo y mi mente se desnudan de las vestiduras de la soberbia tanto tiempo llevada....me doy cuenta que tan solo soy una gotita más que forma parte del universo.....<br>  <br>  "El universo no fue hecho a medida del hombre; tampoco le es hostil: es indiferente."

En modelos matemáticos y fórmulas conocemos muy bien el universo, sobre todo a partir de la teoría de la relatividad de Einstein. Ya lo había dicho Galileo, que el universo habla en caractéres matemáticos. Pero fue el mismo Einstein quien en una frase irónica nos dijo "Dos cosas son infinitas, de la primera no estoy seguro, el universo y la estupidéz humana.Un abrazo,Pau,,Orlando,,,|`|4hfNPeWOaa	Hola ....ciertamente es así, en un sentido..hay una narración que grafica mi resp. de autoría desconocida para mí.... En sí una historia particular. <br>  "La historia dice que hubo una vez un hombre, un hombre común y corriente sin ningún atributo especial. Era, como todos los demás, un conducto del espíritu y por esta virtud, como todos los demás, formaba parte del espíritu, parte de lo abstracto. Pero él no sabía. El mundo lo mantenía tan ocupado que carecía del tiempo y de la inclinación para examinar el asunto."<br>  "El espíritu trato inútilmente de ponerle al descubierto el vinculo de conexión entre ambos. Por medio de una voz interior, el espíritu le reveló sus secretos, pero el hombre fue incapaz de comprender las revelaciones. Oía la voz interior, naturalmente, pero creía que era algo de él. Estaba convencido de que lo que él sentía eran sus propios sentimientos y que lo que pensaba eran sus propios pensamientos."<br>  "Con el fin de sacarlo de su modorra, el espíritu le dio tres se?ales, tres manifestaciones sucesivas. Tres veces el espíritu, de la manera más obvia, se cruzó físicamente en el camino del hombre. Pero el hombre permanecía inconmovible ante cualquier cosa que no fuera su interés personal."<br>  <br>  Mira si bien eso trata sobre manifestaciones del espíritu que otros conocerán para desarrollar, solo concluyo ..que, somos "razón -voluntad-espíritu", nuestro intento es la fuerza y aunque con la inteligencia, no podamos acceder muchas veces, el espíritu eleva ,supera,significa el conocimiento sin palabras; el conocimiento que queda fuera de nuestra comprensión racional.|`|6sZvxLzsaa	no..en absoluto, ya que la ciencia ha podido detectar que existe la cuarta dimension, es decir la trascendencia de los limites del universo,,,y los albores de la gran explosion.....suerte....|`|xYCmFtgaaa	Pienso que si ya que a medida que pasa el tiempo vamos conociendo cosas nuevas y nos cambia todo lo conocido<br>  saludos la yoli|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Tan precario que cuando empezamos a resolver algo, surgen cien mil preguntas más sin resolver al respecto =)
rUnVYvsLaa	Querida Pau,<br>  <br>  Nop!!! nunca he querido ser otra, aquí la importancia de aceptarse uno mismo y amarse ya que dicen por ahí que para amar a los demás primero debemos amarnos a nosostros mismos para poder dar amor....con nuestras virtudes y defectos aceptandonos tal cual somos.<br>  <br>  NO CULPES A NADIE.<br>  Nunca te quejes de nadie, ni de nada,<br>  porque fundamentalmente tu has hecho<br>  lo que querías en tu vida.<br>  Acepta la dificultad de edificarte a ti mismo<br>  y el valor de empezar corrigiéndote.<br>  <br>  El triunfo del verdadero hombre surge de<br>  las cenizas de su error.<br>  Nunca te quejes de tu soledad o de tu suerte,<br>  enfréntala con valor y acéptala.<br>  De una manera u otra es el resultado de tus<br>  actos y prueba de que tú siempre has de ganar.<br>  <br>  No te amargues de tu propio fracaso<br>  ni se lo cargues a otro, acéptate ahora<br>  o seguirás justificándote como un ni?o.<br>  Recuerda que cualquier momento es bueno<br>  para comenzar y que ninguno es tan terrible<br>  para claudicar.<br>  <br>  No olvides que la causa de tu presente es tu pasado<br>  así como la causa de tu futuro será tu presente.<br>  Aprende de los audaces, de los fuertes,<br>  de quien no acepta situaciones, de quien<br>  vivirá a pesar de todo, piensa menos en tus<br>  problemas y más en tu trabajo y tus problemas<br>  <br>  sin eliminarlos morirán.<br>  Aprende a nacer desde el dolor y a ser más grande<br>  que el más grande de los obstáculos,<br>  mírate en el espejo de ti mismo y serás libre y fuerte<br>  y dejarás de ser un títere de las circunstancias,<br>  porque tu mismo eres tu destino.<br>  <br>  Levántate y mira el sol por las ma?anas<br>  y respira la luz del amanecer.<br>  Tu eres parte de la fuerza de tu vida,<br>  decídete y trunfarás en la vida;<br>  nunca pienses en la suerte,<br>  porque la suerte es :<br>  "el pretexto de los fracasados".<br>  PABLO NERUDA <br>  <br>  ...pero siempre es necesario renovarse.....sacudirse los viejos hábitos y costumbres........para abrir la puerta al cambio y ser mejores tratando de alcanzar la perfección....<br>  <br>  EL áGUILA <br>  El águila es el ave de mayor longevidad de la especie, llegando a vivir hasta los 70 a?os. Pero para llegar a esa edad, a los 40 a?os deberá tomar una seria y difícil decisión. <br>  A los 40 a?os, sus plumas están deterioradas, y sus alas envejecidas y pesadas. Volar ya se le hace pesado y su maniobrabilidad es reducida. Sus garras están gastadas y débiles; y su pico ha crecido demasiado largo y curvado hacia su pecho. Todo esto le dificulta capturar a sus presas alimenticias. <br>  El águila tiene solamente dos alternativas: morir o enfrentar un doloroso proceso de renovación que dura 150 días. <br>  Ese proceso consiste en volar hacia lo alto de una monta?a para quedarse en un rincón del acantilado a salvo de ser molestada y donde no tenga necesidad de volar. <br>  Una vez que se ha instalado, el águila comienza a golpear con su pico en la roca hasta conseguir arrancárselo. <br>  Luego espera, sin posibilidad de comer, el crecimiento de un nuevo pico. Cuando este ha crecido lo utiliza para desprender una a una sus u?as. <br>  En tanto que las nuevas u?as lo permiten, arranca una por una sus plumas viejas. Y pacientemente, espera las nuevas. <br>  Todo el proceso lleva cinco meses. Luego, aunque hambrienta, sale el águila renovada a volar y cazar y vivir 30 a?os más. <br>  <br>  En nuestra vida, debemos siempre estar alerta a la necesidad de una reconsideración de quién somos y a dónde vamos. No debemos dudar en resguardarnos por algún tiempo y atravesar un proceso de renovación y re-alineación hacia nuestra vida deseada. <br>  Para continuar nuestro vuelo de vida con mayor fuerza, debemos tomar tiempo frecuentemente para desprendernos de hechos, costumbres, tradiciones. Debemos quitarnos los recuerdos dolorosos. <br>  <br>  Libres del peso del pasado, y renovando nuestro SER y cargando nuevas visiones de qué queremos que se trate nuestra vida, podemos volar más rápido y más alto y más acertados.<br>  <br>  "El verdadero progreso consiste en renovarse." Alejandro Vinet (1797-1847) Literato y teólogo suizo. <br>  <br>  Saluditos Cari?osos, feliz fin de semana, RoseBud.|`|4821d4b7fd50007f7a9589446be624cfaa	Qué buena pregunta. Claro que sí. En realidad, creo que todo el mundo , de pronto, se encuentra no sólo ante el deseo de serlo pero ante la disyuntiva de, en realidad, no reconocerse como uno se concibe a sí mismo. En mi caso, me sucede cuando escribo poesía. Pareciera que percibo de otra forma lo que me rodea pero también emerge, de vez en cuando, como mecanismo de defensa. Frente a una situación en la que uno se encuentra a disgusto, resulta mejor enfrentarse presuponiendo que no eres la afectada. En fin, que este deseo o propensión esta íntimamente ligada a la imaginación.|`|ZXFk4V3Xaa	De peque siempre quise ser diferente, totalmente diferente de lo que era, y algunas veces, ser otra persona: cabello lacio, color claro o güero, tez blanca, ojos de color, gran estatura, etc. Ser la ni?a del andador que tenía el auto para salir a la calle y conducir (o sea, ser mi prima), ser la ni?a a la que su madre dejaba pintarse las u?as, maquillarse, etc (o sea, mis "amigas"), ser la ni?a a quien todos los peque?os miraran y dijeran que es la más bonita (o sea, la archirrival de la escuela); ser la ni?a a la que un cico guapo e inteligente besaba en algún lugar romántico (o sea, la chica en la película), entre un sin fin de cosas.<br>  <br>  Creo que alguna vez todos hemos querido ser alguien más o ser diferente a lo que somos.<br>  <br>  Ahora volteo y recuerdo todas esas cosas de mi infancia, y me río, porque gracias a que deseaba ser diferente, ser el estereotipo, no pude ver mi propia individualidad, mi propia belleza, que en verdad soy atractiva aunque los ni?os volteén a ver a la chica güerita y quepara mi sorpresa, mi lista de seguidores y fans es bastante larga! <br>  Y doy gracias que eso haya sido sólo en mi infancia, porque si hubiese seguido así, pocos me tendrían en el concepto en que me tienen actualmente: una chica guapa, inteligente, madura, atractiva y un largo etc.<br>  <br>  En la actualidad simplemente soy lo que soy, me da gusto y siento orgullo por ser así, porque no soy ese estereotipo, ese común denominador, sino un individuo con indentidad, personalidad y características propias, únicas, originales que no trata de ser como todos los demás piden que sea o quieren que sea.<br>  <br>  Saludos!<br>  =)|`|1uKh00VBaa	Otra no, pero hubo un tiempo que pensaba que me hubiera gustado ser hombre, en ese tiempo sentia que los hombres tenian mas libertad de experimentar, se les permitia ser como quisieran, y muchas cosas mas,,, Ahora se que es cuestion de madurar para poder ser tu misma, y tomar tus responsabilidades respecto de lo que quieras hacer.

6K1lZ4Hhaa	Querida Paulette: <br>  A proposito de nuestro intercambio quiero transmitir que  me suceden algunas cosas desde hace un tiempo con mi participación aquí y voy después a  la pregunta-<br>  <br>    Estos amigos virtuales que sacaron de adentro mío una destreza-<br>  ( mas allá de que tenga algún interés o sea mediocre, incompleta o errónea en su elaboración, no sé nada acerca de criterios de evaluación, normas elementales de construcción etc)-  destreza o empecinamiento que sé yo,  que les entrego con dedicación, pues de aquí  proviene la motivación, es una pregunta cada relato, en el que pregunto y me pregunto a través de la ficción en las múltiples voces <br>  <br>  de PERSONAJES DIVERSOS Y ME RESPONDE GENTE DIVERSA Y DESDE LA DIVERSIDAD APRENDO, NO ME VA LA VIDA SI ESTOY EN LA VOZ DE UN DIFERENTE. y ESTO, Y PERDONA QUE GRITE-  me resulta apasionante. Primer rédito.<br>  <br>   AUNQUE LILAS SE PUEDE LLEVAR UNA SORPRESA RESPECTO A ESTE TEMA, CUANTO TOLERAMOS AL QUE SENTIMOS DIFERENTE? PODEMOS RECONOCERLE ALGúN MéRITO.<br>  <br>   SI ES NO: SOMOS MáS ENANOS AUTORITARIOS QUE LO QUE CREíA.<br>  <br>  Segundo asunto, los amigos se  encuentran  en una distancia óptima, están muy cerca como para estimular y lo suficientemente lejos como para no invadir, de hecho esto me resulta ideal.Estoy  viviendo prácticamente aquí, porque cada escrito me lleva unas horas...y me hace muy feliz gracias, pero no podrá ser siempre así porque me comerán los albatros. Pero llegar a definir para mí misma cuáles son mis criterios valorativos en lo estetico y en la expresión artística y en la comunicación es más que importante.<br>  <br>  Como  dice una  amiga mía, del borde del bosque te fuiste a la espesura.

El Diccionario de la Real Lengua de la Academia Espa?ola dice que: "La Belleza" es el conjunto de cualidades de las personas, las artes, la naturaleza y las cosas que nos provocan un sentimiento de amor, infundiendo en nosotros un deleite espiritual hacia ellas....por lo que ese sentimiento hacia una creación artística es muy subjetivo, pertenece a cada quien de acuerdo a su percepción de la belleza de la obra, de tal manera que a mi me puede gustar una obra que quizás para ti sea horrorosa, depende mucho del gusto.<br>  <br>  Tu sabes que yo soy amante de la pintura y yo pinto y te dejo este link.....ojalá y puedas ver algunas de mis obras; pues la pintura es mi fascinación....no hay nada que se compare a tomar en tus manos la paleta y el píncel y crear.....crear.....y recrearte en el juego de los colores.....las luces y las sombras.....????Exquisito!!!! pues te pierdes en un mundo mágico sin igual....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25176929@N06/?saved=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/25176929@N0...</a><br>  <br>  Mis pintores favoritos son Vincent VanGogh, Monet, Velázquez y Goya....aqui te dejo algunas de sus obras que me fascinan....<br>  <br>  Venus del espejo, Diego Velázquez, Hacia 1647-165:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/VelazquezVenues.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Con ella alguna vez me paso que estando en la National Gallery of London todos los que rodeabamos y mirabamos la obra eramos de habla hispana y de repente todo me empezó a girar y girar y girar.....creo recordar que alguna vez hiciste una pregunta sobre el Síndrome de Stendhal.....creo que eso fue lo que me pasó.....<br>  <br>  Vincent VanGogh, Los Girasoles:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Van_Gogh_Twelve_Sunflowers.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  El quitasol, Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, 1777:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/El_Quitasol.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Claude Monet, Los Nenúfares (Les nymphéas), 1920-1926:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Claude_Monet_038.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deseoaprender.com/Monet/galleries/El%20estanque%20de%20los%20nenufares.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.deseoaprender.com/Monet/galle...</a><br>  <br>  "El ojo recibe de la belleza pintada el mismo placer que de la belleza real."

Para mi lo bello de la creación artística es cuando el artista por medio de su obra trasciende a los demás expresando algo que hace que los espectadores tengan un sentimiento.|`|mCT60hRRaa	Desde mi punto de vista el arte es estilo,,el cual cada quien lo crea o mejor dicho es creado por él, en un proceso de entrega y trabajo sin tregua."El estilo es el hombre" (Lacan),,Un beso mi querida paulette,,Orlando,,,|`|wyH4zdNuaa	la viveza del dise?o...|`|zcfAfJewaa	Creo que ambas cosas amiga.Sin subestimar que lo feo tiene su belleza y puede ser muy valioso.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rafael|`|J9sJz46Eaa	a mi me pasa algo similiar, como que aveces siento la pasion que el artista empe?o en su obra.
mCT60hRRaa	No creo que todos los hombres melancólicos sean extraordinarios, de todas formas habría que preguntarse cual es valor que le da Aristóteles, al concépto de extraordinario. De todas formas la melancolía tiene grados de "gravedad", desde la psicósis hasta una neurósis grave, o los llamados estados melancólicos.Freud estudió profundamente el asunto en un ensayo llamado "Duelo y Melancolía".En los estados melancólicos el sujeto sufre de tristezas cíclicas, en los casos graves el sujeto es acosado por la culpa y el autorreproche.Es un trastorno con los duelos y el atravesamiento de un amor infantil no resuelto.Es por eso que los sujetos que no caen en un abatimiento paralizante, es posible que se vean acicateados por una busqueda, que los puede hacer destacar en "algo" que los causa, a lo cual el melancólico le puede ser muy fiel y perseverante.Pueden destacarse en las artes, pintura, literatura y música, ya que poseen una sensibilidad muy especial. Tal el caso de Chopin/Kafka/ Becquer y una pleyade de sobresalientes creadores.De todas formas el concepto de melancolía que se tenía en la época de Aristóteles, difiere del actual,  en aquella época se creía que era un trastorno humoral, llamdo de "bilis negra". Te recomiendo un libro recientemente reeditado "Anatomía de la Melancolía" de Robert Burton, que es muy exautivo y analiza el tema a través de toda las épocas. Eso si te interesa el tema.Podria profundizar más pero,,, bueno es un tema complejo y podría resultar cansador. Un abrazo Pau,,Orlando,,,|`|kCEKdjKYaa	Pues es interesante tu pregunta, y ahora que nombras araristotélicae remontare solo a esa epépocalos esescépticoso cocoincidíanon la bubúsquedae la felicidad (o bien supremo), por que esta solo hace esestúpida la gente, (la felicidad perpetua se llama estupidez), ellos buscaban la ataraxia (o la suspencion de todo juicio), para impedir que las emociones afectaran su juicio.<br>  <br>  al estar vaciado de emociones es mejor apreciar los entes, los fenomenos, y las categorias.<br>  <br>  los melancolicos estan vaciados de las emociones fundamentales que entorpecen la utilidad del juicio, digamos que disfrutan una atmosfera especial y aparte de la emociones que nublarian los juicios, me gusta el pensamiento de ortega y gasset que dice que los intelectuales los artistas y demas creadores son como minerva, la que nace vestida de la frente de zeus, y con los ojos de lechuza, pues necesitas otros ojos para ver las cosas desde tu propio centro.<br>  <br>  suerte|`|K083kOQVaa	Porque el sentimiento es lo que nos ha llevado a lo largo del pensamiento y explorar el porque de las cosas.

mCT60hRRaa	Ahhh,,llegue tarde a todas las preguntas sobre Benedetti,,?por qué tan rápido las cerraste,,,?. Bueno como es un homenaje a Benedetti, sólo diré que coincido con él, enamorar/ enamorarse, es cuestión de cada uno con su cada una, no digo culpa, aunque entiendo en el lenguaje coloquial en el que se expresa el Maestro.En realidad y hablando como él, es culpa de cada quien lo que le sucede o no en la vida, lo que uno quiere o ama, eso es cosa de llevarlo adelante y soportar su proceso, no excénto de gozar sus parabienes. Un abrazo,,Orlando,,,|`|b0ef788418ada6be2a5fc104c503e39daa	El enamoramiento es mutuo,y tampoco se puede forzar a nadie para que se enamore de otro,es mas, enamoras a algunos sin proponertelo y no enamoras a otros haciendo lo imposible y es porque no depende tanto de uno mismo,sino de los sentimientos que surjan en los demas.Ademas el amor,como tantas cosas en la vida,no se busca,se encuentra.|`|aad001ad10642673cf3af27e07a206a8aa	Que buenas palabras, pero creo que uno no tiene la culpa por enamorarse! mas bien creo que la culpa es del amor.|`|dF1dcgPgaa	No, la culpa es de uno mismo, porque tu haz estado mucho tiempo con esa persona.

89f7ab617c0687b79dfdda41dad40071aa	Cade um tem seu método de estudo.<br>  O meu método sempre foi o de estar atualizada com as matérias, nunca deixei para estudar na vespera da prova. é muito mais fácil e tranquilo e além de atualizar cada matéria passada, prestar muito aten??o nas explica??es do professor.<br>  <br>  Num concurso para o Magistrado fui reprovada numa prova que eu tinha certeza que estava tudo certo. Na revis?o da prova o Juiz FDP me disse que as respostas estavam certas, mas n?o era aquilo que ele queria de mim...esperava muito mais. VIU COMO AS COISAS EST?O ANDANDO?<br>  <br>  Baseado(a) neste exemplo, estude, atualize todos os dias suas matérias no horário de estudo. N?o precisa ficar horasssss estudando mas é essencial ficar por dentro de tudo que foi dado.

Uma leitura pode dar uma boa imagem inicial do tema, mas é necessário algo mais. <br>  <br>  Para tal é necessário um esfor?o voluntário, o reconhecimento de que é necessário e útil para que os conhecimentos possam ser adquiridos com uma maior eficiência. Tem de ser uma pessoa por si própria a decidir aprender para que qualquer esfor?o seja recompensado por um resultado final. <br>  <br>  Muitas vezes n?o se resume tudo apenas à memoriza??o. Certas matérias realmente requerem uma grande dose de memoriza??o de termos, rela??es e reac??es. Mas outras, de natureza bastante diversa exigem a compreens?o, como é o caso da matemática, dado que é impossível decorar a resolu??o de um exercício, antes é necessário compreender como se atinge a solu??o para que se consiga reproduzir o mesmo tipo de processo mas adequado a uma situa??o diferente. O mesmo acontece com muitos outros ramos e áreas. <br>  <br>  Na maior parte dos casos, podemos dizer que em todas as profiss?es é necessário decorar em primeiro lugar algumas no??es e rela??es básicas e posteriormente é necessário compreender as excep??es, os casos que se apresentam diariamente e que requerem mais do que uma simples récita do que se aprendeu. Exigem uma interpreta??o e uma adapta??o. Daí que para o estudo de todas as matérias se comece sempre pelo mais monótono para depois se atingir o que se verifica ser um desafio. <br>  <br>  Por isso, n?o é talvez correcto pensar que exista um dilema entre a memoriza??o e compreens?o relativamente ao melhor método de estudo pois, na verdade, é necessária uma combina??o de ambos para permitir o sucesso da aprendizagem<br>  |`|x8KgFwmtaa	fazer um supletivo para recuperar o tempo perdido que fiquei sem estudar..|`|Sgt37RO1aa	Pego o livro e vou estudar ué Oo<br>  <br>  |`|g9HUkTCpaa	Gra?as a Deus já passei desta epoca mas quando estudava procura decorar.|`|0dJLP4a6aa	Ambos.

23e1a9cbaedf542e485ef7f525a00d04aa	Creo que Alejandro Magno fue alumno de Aristoteles.|`|Njj8OvXWaa	Nació en la ciudad de Estagira, no lejos del actual monte Athos, en la Calcídica entonces perteneciente al reino de Macedonia (la zona correspondiente a la actual Macedonia griega), fue apodado El Estagirita, y tuvo por madre a Faestis y por padre a Nicómaco.las tradiciones biográficas relativas a Aristóteles pueden parecer numerosas. Pero los documentos de la época son muy escasos, y no se encuentra, en las obras de Aristóteles, ninguna alusión directa a las circunstancias de su vida: incluso la ?Política? parece ignorar la actividad del filósofo y, circunscribiéndose a ella, no se hubiera sabido nunca que fue el preceptor de Alejandro.Nicómaco era el médico personal del rey Amyntas III de Macedonia, quien por su parte era padre de Filipo II, padre de Alejandro Magno.Durante su temprana juventud Aristóteles viajó a la corte del basileos o rey Hermias de Atarneos, su suegro, junto a su condiscípulo Xenócrates.Descendía de una familia de Asclepíades, una de las dinastías médicas que pretendían ser descendientes de Asclepios. Este origen explica simultáneamente el interés de Aristóteles por la Biología y sus relaciones con la corte de Macedonia. Se dirige a Atenas hacia el 367 ó 366, con el fin de estudiar, a los dieciocho a?os. En la Academia, se ha de convertir en uno de los discípulos más brillantes de Platón. éste lo llamaba, por su afición a los estudios, ?el lector?.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Fue así discípulo de Platón y luego preceptor y maestro de Alejandro Magno. Antes de fallecer en Calcis en el a?o 322 a. C. a sus 62 a?os, Aristóteles se había convertido en uno de los filósofos de mayor renombre de su tiempo, durante el cual también su pensamiento científico gozó de enorme prestigio.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Su influencia, empero, fue mayor aún desde la baja Edad Media hasta el Renacimiento europeo.En el a?o 335, Aristóteles funda su propia escuela en Atenas, el Liceo (denominado así por estar situado dentro de un recinto dedicado a Apolo Likeios), donde dictaba clases sobre amplios temas a sus discípulos. A los discípulos de Aristóteles se les llamó ?peripatéticos? (peri pathos) porque solían recibir clases alrededor de los jardines y el paseo que rodeaban al edificio del Liceo.<br>  <br>  |`|N7m8tB2eaa	Ambos son del siglo IV ac y como dice el compa?ero<br>  Alejandro Magno fue discipulo de Aristoteles,<br>  de hecho la expansiòn de AM, fue novedosa politicamente hablando, <br>  conservò en cada lugar "conquistado" las autoridades, las religiones, no impuso una forma nueva o un nuevo regimen.

9n3rdbuyaa	i would definitely read it. <br>  it sounds interesting.|`|4MYJpkZcaa	Well, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that Sebastian is Jewish...so how would he join the war effort? How would he get to the allies without being caught or persecuted? (Or does he join some sort of underground and wait until the allies get there?) I'm not sure if Germany would be the best choice to set it if those are your thoughts... <br>  So far your doing pretty well for thinking of it yesterday, right now I have no idea if I'd read it though. Maybe, it depends on if you work out everything else. Do some research on WWII, that will always help.  <br>  Oh, and if  you want to give a good perspective of him fighting (scenes of him fighting) read Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose ( I read it, loved it and learned something from it) I don't know how serious you are about writing this book right now (how much research you'll want to do or if you just want to start writing it...), but those are my (long winded) thoughts...<br>  Good Luck, I hope it turns out great.|`|aOYZ7kcMaa	Yeah I like it heaps!<br>  I would definately read it and it sounds interesting considering you only thought of it yesterday.<br>  Well done and good luck :)|`|yKWPdilQaa	What's the title?

Apparently there is no way in hell he enlisted in the German military, it would of be forbidden and he would of been carted away to a camp or executed.  Do you mean he would become a dissident fighting against the Germans?  Cause he would have no way to join the Allies, that is not possible when Austria and Germany is under German control.  Clarify the "war effort" he becomes involved in.  Then it would be more believable.  Also study some history of Jewish revolutionaries against the Germans during WW2 so you can find what place and group he would most be involved with.   The conflict could be she is a "german" citizen and prohibited to be with or aid jews.  Her love could cause her and her families execution, thats conflict enough for a person.  <br>  <br>  But the plot does not sound bad.  It needs some tweaking like you say, but it could work and be interesting.  WW2 love stories are often great.  One can find, humanity, love and compassion amongst so much pain and destruction.|`|cc2bf89e6ea2be2b3ba1bb9f8a1f0567aa	Sorry, I only read nonfiction.

So I'm in the middle.|`|DFJGwDljaa	loathe is a better word|`|V1cFeiUuaa	My vote -- despise.  Twilight has no full, round, real characters, no truthfully depicted relationships between the characters, not even rich vampire lore to make it an interesting if mediocre story.  Nope, all it has is a "dangerous" attraction between PMS-ing Edward and swoony but stalwart Bella.  The plot of a romance novel --without the sex. Not that I don't appreciate safe, cheap amusement for thirteen-year-old girls but Twilight is not for me.|`|2vQ5AOoqaa	Well, i am sort of deciding whether to like it or not, i have read all of the books in the series but its not really a excellent series. so i would say im neutral with the whole series.|`|j7juI4iXaa	Twilight deffinatly.

V7RCbfCyaa	el ultimo libro que me hizo llorar fue el de "Mil soles explendidos" un super  libro que te deja un sabor de lo que es el verdadero significado del amor.<br>  <br>  La novela comienza con la presentación del personaje de Mariam, una ni?a de cinco a?os que vive con su madre, Nana, en una peque?a kolba (covacha). Mariam es hija ilegítima de Yalil, un hombre adinerado y un reputado ciudadano de Herat que dejó embarazada a su sirvienta. Al conocer el embarazo de Nana, Yalil ordenó a sus hombres construir una kolba a las afueras de Herat para que allí ésta pudiera dar a luz y criar a su hija. Desde que Mariam es tan solo una ni?a, su madre no para de recordarle que ha nacido siendo una harami (bastarda) y que está destinada a sufrir durante toda su vida, igual que había hecho ella. Mariam, sin embargo, pasa toda su infancia esperando ansiosamente la visita de su padre cada jueves. Ella sabe que su padre está casado y tiene otros diez hijos que viven con él en su casa de Herat, pero nunca ha ido a visitarlo por la desgracia que supone, para la sociedad en la que viven, ser una harami. Aún así, sue?a con vivir con él y sus hermanos en aquella casa, pero no se atreve a contárselo a su madre porque es consciente de la aversión que ésta siente hacia su padre.<br>  <br>  El día que Mariam cumple quince a?os, le pide a su padre que le lleve al cine del que éste es propietario a ver Pinocho. Nana se opone y ruega a su hija que no vaya con su padre, sin embargo, Yalil le promete que pasaría a buscarla. Mariam espera durante horas a la puerta de su kolba, pero su padre no aparece. Es, entonces, el momento en el que Mariam decide ir a Herat para encontrar la casa donde Yalil vive con su familia. Una vez allí, después de haber hecho todo el camino a pie, éste no le da permiso para entrar en su casa y le exige que vuelva con su madre. Mariam, en un arrebato de obstinación decide pasar la noche en el porche a la espera de que Yalil le dé permiso para entrar.<br>  <br>  A la ma?ana siguiente, el chófer de Yalil insiste en llevar a la ni?a a su kolba, pero Mariam, que se siente traicionada, decide volver caminando junto a su madre. A su regreso a casa, Mariam encuentra el cuerpo sin vida de Nana, quien, sumida en la desesperación, había decidido suicidarse. Mariam, rota por el dolor y desolada, tiene que ir entonces a vivir a la casa de su padre, donde en lugar de encontrar apoyo, recibe desprecio por parte de sus hermanos. Yalil y su mujer deciden casar a Mariam con un viudo mayor que ella llamado Rashid, un zapatero de clase media de Kabul. A pesar de la oposición y el rechazo de Mariam, Yalil la obliga a contraer matrimonio y a irse a vivir con su marido a la capital afgana. Antes de partir definitivamente de Herat, Mariam le pide a su padre que jamás vuelva a visitarla y que, desde ese momento, jamás podría reconocerle como padre.<br>  <br>  Ya en Kabul, Mariam empieza a adaptarse a su nueva vida de casada junto a un hombre al que apenas conoce. En un primer momento, Rashid le deja tiempo para que se acostumbre, pero enseguida le deja claro que tiene que ejercer su papel de esposa y tiene que empezar a hacer las tareas de la casa y a cocinar. Del anterior matrimonio de Rashid nació un ni?o que falleció ahogado en un trágico accidente; por ello, está entusiasmado con la idea de volver a tener otro hijo. Aunque Mariam queda pronto embarazada, sufre un aborto natural y su relación con Rashid da un giro drástico; éste deja de ser cordial con ella, la maltrata física y psicológicamente y la viola durante muchos a?os en los que Mariam sufre sucesivos abortos.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Son 4 partes y no dejas de leer,solo lo dejas para poder respirar.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Arcángeles, de Paco Ignacio Taibo II, en algunos pasajes son realmente impresionantes =)|`|hko5xsH4aa	Waaa...

kJ6YJkvTaa	Contradiciendo un poco a lo que muchos te han dicho, tengo la convicción que hay valores que vienen grabados en el corazón (incrustados si así lo quieres ver) de cada quien, que salen y se fortalecen a pesar de haber vivido circunstancias adversas.  Por ejemplo, si no tienes un buen ejemplo de algún familiar es como si eso te diera alientos para hacer lo correcto (lo contrario  a lo que ves).<br>  <br>  Las situaciones contradictorias hacen que te afirmes más en el valor.<br>  <br>  Esto te lo digo por experiencia personal, ya sabes porque.<br>  <br>  Hay otros valores que se ense?an con el ejemplo y estos también se incrustan en la persona.  De cualquier manera puede suceder que alguien tenga un buen ejemplo y que le ense?en los valores, pero a la hora de la verdad se necesita algo muy interno da cada quien para VIVIRLOS, hacerlos respetar y ense?arlos, eso es disposición.<br>  <br>  <br>  EXITOS  PARA  TI  CONCIENCIA  y  FELIZ  2009|`|SWk6VIRZaa	el tema de los valores es muuy complejo y más bien estos son implícitos o explícitos y definitivamente son adquiridos, es decir el ser humano los toma o no como parte de sí mismo de acuerdo a la percepcion q dentro de sus diversos sistemas (familia, amigos, comunidad, entidad, país, etc.) tiene de estos <br>  <br>  pueden ser desarrollados muchos valores o ninguno dependiendo lo q la persona y su entorno interpreten como tal un valor, o sea q lo q para alguien es un valor para otra persona puede no serlo; existen valores entendidos como UNIVERSALES y son los más conocidos como honestidad, amor, tolerancia, etc xq también son los q más fama y/o promoción se les ha dado <br>  <br>  dudas????

Los valores humanos son relativos, en algunas culturas en normal casarse con ni?as de doce a?os en otras esto es inadmisible, por citar sólo un ejemplo.

Es como expresar un deseo que sientes, es como un anhelo que nace de tu sentir, de que viva lo que amas. Me sucede mucho cuando pienso en la mujer que amo y también me sucede en la a?oranza, cuando pienso en mi familia o mi patria que tengo lejos de mi. Pero sea amor o a?oranza, creo que es la expresión misma de la fé, de creer en algo y que deseas que nunca muera porque es lo que siempre quieres tener a tu lado.<br>  <br>  Hasta pronto Alisha,<br>

Es el vano anhelo de llenar el espacio que nuestro corazon reserva a su elegido!<br>  aaahhhhaaahhh!!!|`|YyiuYoMBaa	Alisha, subo una explicación y un poema....<br>  Un suspiro es una forma de alivio casi siempre temporaria. Suele suceder al final de una serie de pensamientos o sensaciones que producen una especie de tensión. Antes del suspiro estamos tristes, preocupados, emocionados, excitados, ensimismados en algo que nos contractura el alma. En un momento dado toda esa tensión se resuelve, encuentra la salida, y el suspiro permite el desahogo. Perdidos en nuestros pensamientos, sin darnos cuenta de lo que está pasando, de pronto hacemos una inspiración profunda, seguida por una expiración quizás acompa?ada por un "aaah..." o un "mmmm..."; el suspiro. <br>  Más o menos largo, más o menos corto. <br>  Y toda la tensión desaparece, y el aire que sale de los pulmones funciona como un bálsamo, y el cerebro se alivia, se relaja. <br>  Sentimos el consuelo de unos pulmones vacíos y una mente en blanco y nos quedamos en paz.<br>  Pero más allá de las explicaciones, está el poeta que de él se nutre<br>  <br>  "Aquél Suspiro" <br>  Aquel suspiro que se escapa de aquella boca caprichosa<br>  y sale airado ante las cosas, dice, condena, hiere y mata,<br>  aquel suspiro que cual rosa en su belleza me arrebata<br>  aquella fe que me era escasa, envenenándome sin fin...<br>  <br>  Aquel suspiro de armadura, cual caballero de escarlata,<br>  irrumpe en el escueto escudo de aquel mi corazón poeta,<br>  irgue su lanza y cual saeta vuela a mi pecho que desnudo<br>  espera impávido indefenso el mensajero del sentir...<br>  <br>  Aquel suspiro que en el aire quedó como en el mismo olvido,<br>  y que el recuerdo trae consigo como un testigo de la afrenta,<br>  deliberadamente acaso, con las excusas de un motivo,<br>  en el silencio en el que escribo... vuelve conmigo, cual tormenta.<br>  <br>  Dos respuestas distintas..... yo, me quedo con el poema<br>  Un beso<br>  Marta|`|bu8hj8aZaa	Es un deseo contenido...

faRQPKXYaa	No de ninguna manera, es sumamente díficil que podamos realizar todo a la perfección, siempre vamos a necesitar de algo, de alguien que nos ayude a lograr nuestras metas, propósitos, y hasta hacer realidad nuestras ilusiones, si esto fuese cierto, estaríamos ante un mundo maravilloso, cero problemas, todos en gran armonía, pero.... lamentablemente no es así, incluso hay personas que acaban sus vidas, hasta llegan al suicidio, porque no pudieron, o no supieron como y que hacer con sus vidas, los problemas le abrumaron tanto, que acabaron con ellos, todos, debemos tener un cierto grado de preparación, hasta para los cosas que consideremos más ínfimas, y tratar de hacer todo lo mejor que podamos, pero a sabiendas que solo, se nos hace muy díficil, vemos casos, de personas que han quedado lisiadas pero han salido adelante, no dejan de trabajar, mientras que otras en el mismo caso, se abandonan a su suerte, comienzan a sentir lástima de si mismos, y así van acabando con toda la ilusíón por la vida, todo depende de lo que uno quiera o no hacer, si decidimos que aquí se viene a luchar, para triunfar, perfecto, pero si perdimos el interés por todo, sabemos lo que va a suceder, por algo somos tan diferentes los unos con los otros, incluso hasta los hermanos, siendo hijos de un solo padre y una sola madre, actúan en forma distinta, y enfrentan sus problemas también diferentes, porque somos seres individuales, que actuamos por si mismos, pero que para muchas de las cosas que nos toca hacer, vamos a necesitar ayuda de otros. saludos.|`|0Tp3IhoHaa	absolutamente no,podemos con poco,y casi siempre nos quedan cosas que atender y resolver correctamente.|`|2RQYduq6aa	Podemos, con lo que podemos.

Mi respuesta es que no sería difícil ser uno mismo cuando se está seguro de sí mismo, cuando sabemos que queremos hacer de nuestra vida y cuál nuestro lugar en la vida. El problema es mantener una postura ante diversas situaciones que se nos presenta la vida. Debemos recordar que el ser humano es un animal social y por lo tanto las normas básicas de convivencia nos lleva a realizar acciones o tomar decisiones que no están de acuerdo con nuestros principios. Muchas veces debemos sacrificar ese "ser uno mismo" para poder adaptarnos a la sociedad que nos rodea y de la formamos parte. Sin embargo, en la medida en que defendamos nuestros principios con convicción, más fácil es ser uno mismo.|`|uYScumVyaa	PUES SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII,,,,,   = )<br>  <br>  <br>  Aunque trato de sobrellevarlo,,,,,,,,

Pero creo que el como vemos la vida, o mas bien como es la vida (puesto que la vida es como cada uno la ve,la vida es como la vemos, no existe realidad objetiva) depende de nuestro estado de animo. <br>  y de que depende nuestro estado de animo? <br>  existen dos posibles reacciones:<br>  - de fuera a dentro: determinados azares de la existencia, que te salen las cosas bien por suerte. LA sensacion de haber conseguido algo tal y como lo imaginamos produce la secreccion de DOPAMINA a hormona de la felicidad, de manera que influye en nuestro modo de ver el mundo haciendonoslo de colores.<br>  - De dentro a fuera: determinados procesos hormonales, pueden afectar a la secreecion de determinadas sustancias. Y de esto pueden dar fe las mujeres ya que durante el ciclo menstrual se producen grandes cambios en la concentraciond e determiandas hormonas, produciando cambios de humor, estres y irritabilidad. De manera que nuestro propio cuerpo puede hacernos ver la vida de un modo distinto.

mCT60hRRaa	Querida,,,bueno me mandaste al frente,,,tengo que recoger el guante. Es una frase que se presenta como una paradoja invertida. Si se dice que el amor dura para siempre,,,yo digo,,,mientras dura, el amor es para siempre,,ya ves lo que produce, cambiar una palabra de lugar, cambiando el contexto. Representa una verdad indubitable,,,sobre el tema de fondo: "Nada es para siempre". Creo que  en ese contexto,,,  lo dije. Si en la vida, ni aún nosotros los amantes,  existimos para siempre, el amor real, en tanto suplencia en la civilización, de algo que se ha perdido, tampoco tiene porqué serlo,,, y de hecho no lo es. Salvo en la ilusión...pero eso es otra cosa. Cuando hablo del amor,,, hablo del amor humano, real. El amor divino o el llamado platónico es otro cantar. Inclusive el amor filial o el amor "philia" de los amigos,,,tolera otros desgastes. Mi frase está referida fundamentalmente al amor de pareja,,, al amor erótico o sexual. Por eso los Griegos,,,muy listos,,, usaban tres términos para referisrse al amor: Eros,,, Agape,,,Philia,,,en diferentes contextos. Bueno hasta aquí,,,gracias por tu pregunta,,,aunque me haya mandado al frente,,  ja ja ja.

mCT60hRRaa	Bueno,,, es una forma de aforísmo retórico,,,se me ocurrió en el mismo instante de responder una pregunta, justamente sobre los grafitis y una forma muy actual, de dar a leer deseos o felicitaciones o expresar estados de ánimo, cuando no improperios o insultos eróticos. De manera que relevo a paulette, a quien agradezco su coraje de levantar un decir/Otro y proponerlo a la opinión, de las consecuencias ante otros, de ser tildada de preguntar raro,,, ja ja ja. Ella ya lo ha hecho, pero en su exquisita discreción, prefirió soslayar en ese momento la fuente.Debo tomar un sesgo y aclaro que mi decir es absolutamente espontaneo. Debajo de mi respuesta a Noemí sobre los grafitis, una dama de apodo "pola",,, ha dejado testimonio diciendo que mi decir es raro, rarisimo, que no parezco ni porte?o ni del interior,,,y me pregunta si soy Argentino.Bueno acá contesto,,, de alguna manera hago mi grafiti ja ja ja, para seguir en tema: Nací, se?ora en la República Oriental del Uruguay,,,lo cual con orgullo llevo,,, el ser un "hijo de Artigas". Pero soy también Argentino por adopción, ya que hace muchos a?os que vivo en este hermoso país, que me brindó la posibilidad de estudiar, trabajar y desarrollarme, bajo una insignia sanmartiniana, de la cual también me siento honrado.Sobre mi forma de decir o preguntar y sus rarezas,,,bueno en tanto mi infancia es Oriental es posible que esos trazos infantiles, distingan en mi un decir/Otro de arraigambre montevideano,,,que después de todo es esa la ciudad que me "vió nacer". La gente se pregunta hoy, porqué están de moda los tatuajes, de una forma creciente en la juventud. Bueno yo respono así : ?No es un tatuaje de alguna forma un grafiti,,,?? No se escriben logos o leyendas o nombres o mensajes sobre la piel, de una forma dolorosa y permanente que desnudan, un sentimiento de pertenecia hacia Otro/otro?.Desde mi punto de vista, es esto una manera, de que una verdad escrita en el cuerpo sutil, el cuerpo del amor, el cuerpo en relación a lo inconsciente, se haga visible en el cuerpo físico real,,, para ser leido por otro. Es en este sentido que desarrollo el aforismo,,, de alguna manera fundamento, porque digo que somos grafitis del decir del Otro. Como los grafitis ocasionales o no de de la ciudad y sus barrios o rincones,,,tambien nos damos a leer, ya sea por nuestros actos, palabras, escritos y ahora tambien por los decires escritos en nuestro cuerpo. Gracias se?ora paulette por darme esta ocasión de desarrrollar a mano alzada un pensamiento que aquí mismo ha nacido.

Claro los sentimientos, en tanto del lado del signo, representan algo para alguien, pero la escritura en tanto es discursiva es significante. De manera que el trabajo del poeta es transformar signos en significantes, desplazar "sentidos", palabra cuya pregnancia remite a lo sentido.Abrir los sentimientos, metaforizarlos, mostrarlos de otra manera, esta es la taréa del poeta, aprender este arte. Transformar imágenes en palabras, para que vuelvan a reconstruirse en imágenes en el lector. Por eso para mi la poesía, más debe mostrar que decir.La poesía de mucha palabra no es mi estilo,porque esta sobreabundancia de ellas, desde mi punto de vista diluye el efecto de mostración.

En los últimos a?os de su actividad, el estilo del Bosco cambió y creó cuadros con un número inferior de figuras y de mayor tama?o que parecen sobresalir del cuadro y acercarse al observador. El Bosco no fechó ninguno de sus cuadros y sólo firmó algunos.

jKdIMEjYaa	Desde su nacimiento, la filosofía carga con la sospecha de ser una disciplina sin utilidad. A lo largo de los siglos, los pensadores han arriesgado varias justificaciones. En este informe, se ponen en tela de juicio los distintos aportes que la filosofía podría hacer tanto en el ámbito público como en el individual, el de la vida cotidiana<br>  <br>  Según Aristóteles, la filosofía nació con Tales de Mileto en el siglo VI antes de Cristo, porque fue Tales el primero que buscó respuestas a sus preguntas acerca del mundo sin recurrir a la mitología. De Tales se sabe que fue matemático, astrónomo, ingeniero, estadista, meteorólogo y uno de los Siete Sabios. Y sin embargo, entre sus contemporáneos no despertaba siempre reverencia.<br>  <br>  Una vez —cuenta Platón— Tales se cayó en un pozo y una esclava se burló de él: por mirar el cielo —se reía la joven— no advierte lo que tiene bajo sus pies. En otra ocasión —cuenta Aristóteles—, Tales tuvo que mostrar que los filósofos también pueden, si quieren, ganar dinero, porque él estaba cansado de recibir toda clase de cargadas "tanto por su pobreza como por la inutilidad de la filosofía". Como sus conocimientos le habían permitido calcular una buena cosecha, Tales arrendó, fuera de estación, todos los contenedores para olivas a bajo precio y cuando llegó el momento los alquiló más caros. <br>  <br>  El punto es que desde que existe la filosofía quienes no la practican se preguntan para qué sirve o, más bien, hacen explícita su sospecha de que no sirve para nada. Quizá haya algo muy sensato en esa sospecha, considerando que desde hace veintiséis siglos los filósofos vienen proponiendo sistemas, teorías, doctrinas, hipótesis o dogmas acerca de las cuestiones más variadas —?qué es el hombre? ?por qué hay universo y no "nada"? ?existe dios? ?cuál es la relación entre el lenguaje y la realidad? ?cómo hacer justicia?— sin resolver definitivamente ninguna o pocas de ellas. Debería llamarnos la atención, sin embargo, que —como se?ala Manuel Comesa?a— "a pesar de tratarse de discusiones interminables sobre problemas sin solución", el interés por la filosofía no ha desaparecido nunca. <br>  <br>  En todo caso, la pregunta por la utilidad de la filosofía no puede entenderse de una única manera. "Para qué sirve" se dice en muchos sentidos. Puede ser una pregunta retórica —que ya presupone una respuesta negativa—, una pregunta ingenua —por ejemplo, la de un padre preocupado porque su hijo acaba de anotarse en la carrera de filosofía—, una pregunta decepcionada —la de un profesor o un investigador con crisis de identidad—, o una pregunta que tiene la expectativa de encontrar en las respuestas apologéticas un nuevo sentido para encarar la propia tarea o la propia vida. El francés Gilles Deleuze dice que "cuando se pregunta para qué sirve la filosofía, la respuesta debe ser agresiva, ya que la pregunta se tiene por irónica y mordaz". Pero algunas veces, es la propia filosofía la que se formula esa pregunta; entonces es posible que de esa reflexión surja una transformación fructífera o una revolución en el modo de pensar y de actuar.|`|0ztvOjzOaa	segun yo , sirve para ponernos a pensar un ratito de todas las cosas supuestamente importantes k existen y despues para traumarte cuando descubres k todo lo k pensaste k era bueno  o malo dejo d serlo|`|AnATN7Pnaa	la pregunta es gigante. no se pde consultar a la filosof. toda , ya que como toda " ciencia " va por epocas .en su comienzo fue y es griega . luego fue subordinada a razon y fe en el medioevo , y actualmente a ciencia vs. razon , lo que dice laciencia " es " . la angustia , pde ser porque no nos asumimos frente a los avatares cotidianos , juvenud , trabajo , estrias ; etc.  para que sirve ? fijate que hace 2650 a?os que esta , y sin embargo nos preguntamos por ella , hay que buscarla , como en la matrix 1 . no en las otras  , quizas cdo seas viejo te des cta.|`|JjsOrBOIaa	La Filosofía (amor a la sabiduría) responde al deseo de saber. El de saber es un deseo que brota naturalmente del ser humano. Aristóteles decía que el alma es deseo (orexis). No es sólo eso, desde luego. Ni todo en la vida consiste en saber. La vida es también praxis, acción. Y, como el ser humano es tanto deseo de saber como deseo de praxis, un saber que no sirva para nada no interesa nada. A algunos filósofos les gusta repetir que la Filosofía no sirve para nada, pero esto es falso, a no ser que se trate de una falsa filosofía. Todo saber sirve para mucho. Quizá no de una manera inmediata, y desde luego, no para construir puentes, levantar edificios o descubrir nuevas fuentes de energía.<br>  <br>  La filosofía no pretende ense?ar a hacer zapatos, pero es capaz de descubir el más profundo por qué es conveniente fabricar buenos zapatos. Sin filosofía no conoceríamos el "sentido" último de la fabricación de zapatos, ni de nada. Porque no es algo que se pueda "ver" u "oir" en modo alguno.|`|VnVanEKmaa	nunca ,nos introduce cada vez mas en  la incertidumbre y por consiguiente mas angustia.|`|p0ZrElDSaa	No ni se te ocurra, cotejarla toda, terminarìas sin saber donde estàs parada, no te olvides que cada uno de los filòsofos tenìan su propio estilo de pensamientos, lo cual hace que no todos sean iguales, por lo tanto lo que uno veìa de una forma el otro de un plumazo te lo cambia.<br>  La beduina|`|TSNYm6sqaa	No si seguimos copiando a otros.

Donde un lienzo pintado, remeda lo real de atras, de la misma forma que en el link,,, aparece el lienzo y el mar en la foto a la derecha que ilustra.No acuerdo prima facie con Noda, aunque es posible que una ulterior y más profunda lectura de su su artículo en algo me hiciera cambiar de opinión. De todas maneras habría que ver como se sustenta la proposición, que vos consignas en el epígrafe.La angustia dice Lacan no es sin objeto, en el matema consignado aparece el objeto a, y ese es el objeto irreal de la angustia. De manera que la filosofía no lo es, en tanto es que si el hombre fiosofa es por su angustia. Por eso el chimpance de Morris no filosofa,,,?porqué habría de hacerlo,,,?,,para el lo real no es un enigma.

En mi caso, de chico quise ser médico y leía "Los cazadores de microbios" a los 6 a?os, y me fascinaba con Pasteur  el carbunclo y el virus de la hidrofobia.Luego ya de adulto, bueno el psicoanálisis, vino a ocupar ese lugar, ya que en él tambien emprendo curas. Pero tal vez, lo que lamento en una proporción análoga es no haberme animado, a desarrollar mi carrera de cantante lírico. Se que tenía muchas condiciones y que llegué a hacerlo con no pocos elogios. Pero ahí me traicionaban los nervios y cierta "fobia escénica", que sólo después de muchos a?os de análisis pude vencer. Ya emprendí luego otros rumbos ,porque no pedemos hacerlo todo, ya que el arte lírico requiere, de una entrega casi total. Aún canto y a veces ense?o,,,en otro nivel, pero de alguna forma siempre hay en mi una nostalgia al repecto. No estoy arrepentido,,,,es que bueno,,, así pude con mis cosas.

Y considerando el desarrollo de la civilización en el mundo occidental también podríamos asegurar que uno de sus logros es la eclosión de la tinta ante cada acto violento: el análisis, la reflexión, el arte, el pensamiento de los intelectuales.

e6104d6cfc6a57134c2deb916f0d67f4aa	Me gustó, es personal y de intimidad pero en territorios abarcando infinito que compartes a quien amas a fondo sin dudas, es un cari?o que no se pierde por el ayer, ni ma?ana..<br>  <br>  Tienes imágenes de rompimientos logradas que atrapan (en el tiempo hay transformaciones de apariencia fìsica donde vence el verso fuerte, segura va esa de "te voy a encontrar" con "más joven") y definitiva la del "tus últimos días" ligando "el paraíso", por cierto, ?así es? o sea, ?"hazme de esperar" no debiera leerse "hazme esperar"? <br>  <br>  En cuanto a forma, si el verso libre te permite fluidez en el desarrollo de esa intimidad de ideas, como que todavía buscas la rima y así pasa al final con "esperar", rima con la última "estar", me atrapó mucho más otra resonancia verbal. <br>  <br>  Primero, empiezas dirigiéndote a alguien con pregunta y el llamado es ya, de por sí, una complicidad que convidas, obliga al lector entrar en ella, predipuso a identificarme con la o el destinatario, y contigo, algo de entrada que intrigó para introducirme hacia el poema y en mi caso, inconscientemente quise saber de ese alguien que "inspiró"  tu mente dedicar palabras que redactaste. Y de ti, como si también me cuestionara en mí mismo una onda por ejemplo, ?quién será el o la receptora a quien escribe?, o, ?porqué lo hizo la poeta, qué quiere decirle, quién es? Debe importar lo que hayan vivido, si no, ?para qué los versos?<br>  <br>  Pero de vuelta a forma y fondo...  Dos palabras se me hicieron formidables y a partir de ellas decidí leer el resto que jalaron el conjunto. Dos expresiones calificativas de algún sentimiento o suceso con tinte de infelicidad, que no debió pasar ni estar hoy, nunca (lo anuncias de salida, al inicio, con tu propio "dolor"); situación o lo que haya sido le atribuyes dos nombres en participio, tú como autora me refirió a lo que pensé sería: el amor. O cierto amor por demás, las dos palabras, amor "Prohibido, castigado".<br>  <br>  Después volví a leerlo completo, porque me había seducido en doble intensidad y tal vez ya era otra cosa lo de ese cierto amor (frases sobre lo "amado" y "no te dejaré de amar" aparecen luego, más abajo, podía tratarse de otra razón y no aquel amor abstracto, algo tangible, ?qué?). Como ves, estaba enganchado. <br>  <br>  Perdona si aquí aparto hilos en el aspecto formal o técnico del poema ya que, por cierto, a su vez "amado" y el verbo "amar"  dan pie a rimas verbales posteriores como: "abandonar" e igual, las que cierran la poesía en el mero final: "esperar" y "estar" confluyen. Miré bien que lo de "verso libre" era relativo, al encontrar más rimas que en la interpretación primera, donde generalmente se trata de "entender" más que "sentir" o "escuchar" ritmo, melodía, contar sílabas, etc., para una segunda vez la rima se detalló mejor. <br>  <br>  Aquí me detengo y como en éste análisis me he metido y ya acepté que me gustó tu poema, debo explicar por qué o cómo supe que llegaría a "averiguar" más de lo que dijiste, o menos,  tal vez a momentos que no disfruté del todo y, por lo mismo de este ir y venir aprendí, son concepciones mías y rebasan los versos en una extrapoética que creo, serán útiles para intercambio. No justifico, la poesía es difícil y si la intento, que te confieso no me siento así con las herramientas para publicar poesía pero a veces sí, aquí de cuando en cuando trato, resultan poemas de momento y sin demasiada rima porque luego me pierdo y es lo que no pretendo en prosa, se me da o prefiero redactar textos narrados sólo que en ocasiones resulta muy engorrosa, barrocona, prosa que se alarga, complica y no quiero eso, ya trato de limpiarla, usar sinónimos, evitar gerundios o los mismos verbos y términos difíciles, cacofonías, en fin, intento pulir la claridad por el aspecto exterior o de sonoridad y...? me complico!, por darme a entender entro en laberintos yo mismo, si hallo terminaciones excesivas en infinitivos (que sólo son tres:"ar", "er" o "ir"), pienso que no debo usarlos pues a menudo desde ni?os los usamos, cambio posición del verbo, final de una frase al comienzo de oración y por ganar, pierdo naturalidad, es un defecto y obsesión de mis hábitos o (malas) costumbres de lectura y peor si aplica en la ajena peor, que no te importe si hallé sugerencias...<br>  <br>  Y es que al ir al fondo del ?qué sucedió con carga prohibición/castigo de tu poema?, yo que siempre trato de no de rimar verbos repetidos, asombroso: no me molestó la inmediata de "Prohibido, castigado",  los "ido"/"ado" porque funciona, hasta sirven dos veces, retumban lo opaco, pero desdoblan un rigor extra que da tu carácter en lo poético.<br>  <br>  èste juego en choque de evocaciones enriquece contrarios, se?ala a un hecho que preocupa a la poeta y me provoca, ante la dureza que resuena y la sustancia que las amalgama, ?consigo asir qué me gustó, lo entendí el poema? Me di cuenta que esas dos palabras tenían, tal vez, una anterior que pudiese generarlas, ?es "pasado"?, la rima ?es eso que busqué? Por tanto eso de "no dejamos el pasado", creí que era lo "prohibido, castigado" de ayer. Combinar imágenes y rimas internas te sale bien y en tercera lectura, ritmos internos de vocales "ue" ("buenos" y nuestro") y "ía" con "aí" ("días" con "paraíso"), no los creo accidentes sino a propósito cuidando la voz tuya, es intención poética deliberada conjugar fondo con lo demás: imágenes de choque, formatos de armonía o ritmo igual que quiebras con rima; pero siempre conduces coherente el desarrollo de esa paradoja (vida/muerte) donde deseas y no se te escapa el poema. Tampoco hay trucos obvios para perder al lector. <br>  <br>  Lo único, pues, cosillas... Ya puse una en confusión de la línea penúltima "hazme de esperar". También y es sólo mi objeción, la rima de "hazme de esperar" con "allí yo voy a estar", ?necesaria? Y sí creo que expresa el final en cuanto a que es suficientemente la verdad ùltima, así, el "he dicho y se acabó, punto final", posee contundencia. Ahora, si la imagen final requiere también en la forma, equilibrio de terminaciones en rimas "ar" (que den balance a la armonía de ese paraíso), tal vez esa repetición no te suene forzada. Yo, no sé,  perdona mi crítica y sugerencia pero es tu verso, finalmente e imagínate si haces caso a todo el que quiera que cambies cosas; pero no descalifico nada (eso sí horror), recuerda que es importante el final y se me vino a mi mente por la inseguridad de que realmente fuera "hazme de esperar" o querías decir otra cosa y bueno, mi prejuicio...<br>  <br>  Alguien dijo que es triste, pues sí por aquello de "Dijiste que te iban a abandonar" (aquí ni modo, "dijis-te" y "te iban" no hay de otra), sólo que cierras con algo que también me gustó porque no esperaba: habrás de acompa?arlo (aun si lo abandonaron otros, así no eres tú) y cuando él toque el paraíso él podrá contar contigo (precioso ésto, sorprende por lo extraordinario que es "tocar" en su asociación de ya no tocar fondo como se toca una meta o un nadador llega a la final y toca el límite de la piscina en una competencia, sino también que es sentir o incluso, de acariciar; en tanto que hay el significado agregado de sonar y no sólo sería una campana sino algo como ?el paraíso!, pues magnífico, música in crescendo ad infinitum, algo grandioso que está fuera del tiempo y espacio aquí y ahora, por tanto inalcanzable o rara experiencia, porque en la tierra no hay así, se nos ofrecen parecidas muy contadas ocasones y si son permanentes o continuas, creemos ser felices, como cuando son las que proporcionan un amor seksual mucho muy intenso o no sé, espiritual en el cari?o a una madre o amor a una causa, a la humanidad, a toda la naturaleza, son sublimes y daríamos todo por tener esa capacidad de amor e incluso de sacrificio y sí, el poema habla de algo que muere, así antes leímos eso de sus "últimos días" (visión nada fácil, tampoco un pensamiento trivial). Es un poema que conmueve a quien lee, crea o no en el paraíso, lo interprete religiosamente, para mí es muy padre la verdad de la poeta no por lo que dice, sino cómo. Y sólo se me ofrece sin revelar qué pasó, así que en síntesis: <br>  <br>  Redondeas en unidad el poema (arranca con sencillez unos como toquiditos casi sordos, de puntitas cual temer despertar su (en) sue?o al o la persona que es objeto de tu escritura); si va de  como quien pregunta muy bonito en una ventana pero, quedo: "?estás?", concluye hasta algo inmenso al grado superlativo, va del microcosmos destinado al macrouniverso, alcanzar estados de abstracción futura en intercambio de tiempo, fuera un sue?o doble de los dos y al revés, reencuentro fìsico con esa persona juntos por tu voluntad, es decisión mayúscula, tu credo y será así, abarca amplio territorio donde no tienen temor para ninguno y tú lo ya no con miedo a despertar a nadie, en fidelidad total y merece contundencia: "allí voy a estar".  <br>  <br>  Cierre magnífico. Otra vez, para mí un tanto formal pero no me hagas caso, son formulismos míos, ha de ocurrir es como arcaico y sucederá conlleva confianza, ahí estáré  directo. Lo que cuenta es que a través de versos con éste poema manifiestas el amor, es la guía que te da poder para trascender el mundo, o los mundos del pasado impuesto, un rigor aquel que si aun está latente se olvidará porque lo que te une con la persona a quien versificas es un hoy que no murió, acaso has muerto pero lo que existe en ti es una promesa tuya, real como si dijeras lo juro, nada de buenos buenos deseos porque es tu ideología, tu fe, nada menos menos que profecía y esta es cierta, convicción última pero no sólo para ti, involucra a quien cantas y es el mundo que no cambiarás pero que tampoco puede cambiar porque tú estás creándolo, es una visión pero más,un destino, te pertenece en el poema aunque también es de quien te acompa?a, pues así tú lo imaginas en los versos, real, un mundo más allá pero igual de verdadero. El que al fin son ustedes dos en un poema, el poema y por un instante, al leerlo, mío y de quien acuda a su verdad.|`|17dead0ee678a04cc4e5b47e1c6e23c9aa	exelente y una gran forma dwe darlo a conocer suerte|`|3a77ce93b6a1400fdcedbc3a8838339caa	MUY BUENO...<br>  TE GANASTE UNA STRELLITA...<br>  SUERTE!!!|`|9Gf6hBTRaa	Es muy lindo, me gusta porque habla de un amor eterno.

Malargüe era peque?a de calles pedregosas y acequias que acompa?an con agua muy fresca proveniente del níveo y rocoso suelo monta?oso. Malargüe viene de malal hue , corral de piedras. cuando vas caminando para Chile pronto te vas internando en un sendero que rodea el ascenso al chihuido,(seno de mujer). sigues caminando y 192 km de monta?a llegas a una altura que ya no recuerdo, allí hay un valle. el Paso del Pehuenche. Porque te cuento esto? Porque los lugare?os de las distintas zonas cordilleranas dicen que San Martín cruzó a Chile por ese paso, y todos los 18 de enero suben los gobernadores de Mza. Rio *****<br>  y vienen de Chile y festejan esa fecha como muy ciertga. La gente que va lleva productos argentinos y los chilenos de ellos y se hacen intercambios, aunqu sea una simple cajita de fósforos. ponchos, chambergos, monturas de llamas etc. y sabes que se hace? un partido de futbol, así como te lo comento ponen unos palos de argo y los argentinos jugamos hacia Chile, y los chilenos hacia Argentina. además se hace un riquisimo asado, la carne es de nuesstros ganados, y el vino de sus vi?as chilenas.  <br>  Me tocó estar allí No me la quería perder (verano1968).

La parte inferior se atornillaba a la base de la cámara, en el adaptador para el tripie, y se ajustaba la posición para que el otro extremo quedara encima del botón disparador. En ese extremo se colocaba el extremo de un cable disparador mecánico. Al oprimir el botón del cable, se oprimía el botón del disparador de la cámara. No eran eficientes dado que el botón del disparador en la cámara es muy liso y cada vez que sale la punta del cable disparador, se movia ligeramente el soporte, hasta que llegaba el momento en que resbalaba sobre el botón y no se hacía el disparo.<br>  <br>  Considera que te presten una cámara con retardo de disparo o con la opción de disparador electrónico o mecánico.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Con un tequila encima, mejora el pulso de maraquero!|`|gvurfza2aa	en un espejo?????|`|6c15966c94fdd0a41d78fc5c9e326e04aa	Con el autodisparador de la cámara.<br>  <br>  También se le conoce como retardador de disparo.<br>  <br>  El autodisparador es:<br>  En las cámaras anaoógicas la palanca del frente, que retarda el disparo.

Por supuesto que desde la perspectiva que me manejo de la física cuántica pues los milagros como tal no, lo que si existen, y es la base de la película "El Secreto 2" la cual te recomiendo ampliamente y a todos los que lean esta respuesta, como te decía lo que si existe es la materialización de todo cuanto pensamos. Todo Ate, todo cuento pienses se materializará porque como el simil de la película, en el universo existe algo así como el genio de la lámpara de Aladino, esperando a que tu tengas un deseo para decirte: "Tus deseos son órdenes". He hablado mucho de esto en el área de teología. Creo que ese es tu fuerte. Por fa, a ti y a los demás amigos de YR, no abandonen este plano sin ver esa película o la de "Conversaciones con Dios".<br>  Besitos, Ate.

La razon y la logica son instrumentos de la ciencia: nos proveen de conocimiento. El conocimiento cientifico nos da la sensacion de control sobre lo conocido. Nos ensancha el ego nos da una sensacion de falsa seguridad y nos alejamos del milagro de la vida. <br>  <br>  De seguro, en el futuro, el lenguaje la ciencia caminara complementariamente a nuestro lenguaje del corazon. La logica y el corazon estan en cada una de las personas solo que, por cuestiones de genes y educacion familiar y social, se encuentran en distintas proporciones e intensidades. <br>  <br>  Entonces lo milagros estan mas alla de toda logica y razon. Para saber de un milagro, se tendra que ir mas alla del obstaculo de la logica y la razon.  <br>  <br>  Hay dos caminos de "soltar" la logica y la razon: una es ir por debajo de la logica y otra es ir por encima de ella. Estar por debajo es regresar a nuestros instintos, manejandonos, en reaccion, ante los estimulos de la vida.<br>  <br>  Siguiendo en la respuesta a tu pregunta, estar por encima de la logica y la razon es ir depurando y purificando cada vez mas nuestros sentimientos. Purificar nuestros sentimientos es crear, el clima necesario, acorde a nuestra personalidad, para que floresca en nosotros mismos, niveles cada vez mayores de atencion, receptividad, aceptacion,entrega, entendimiento y comprension de los estimulos que nos va ofreciendo la vida: Me da la sensacion que es ahi donde pueden manifestarse los milagros.  No tiene nada que ver con el conocimiento, la memoria, la picardia, la astucia: tienen que ver mas con la inocencia, con la ingenuidad y con la gratitud.<br>  <br>  Un abrazo.|`|MsJ6z5nQaa	La creación de la vida es un hecho milagroso, la creación del universo es un acto milagroso, es un fenómeno con muy pocas probabilidades de que acontezca, o casi nula, tal como el hecho de que se hayan dado las condiciones exactas, precisas, para seguir con vida en el planeta, digamos distancia al sol por ejemplo, si variase la distancia, quizas no estaría aqui escribiendote esto, asi que es un "milagro" que haya vida en el planeta, ahora ?quien es el que hace posible que esa infima probabilidad se cumpla? <br>  Si eres religiosa, bien,ya sabes quien, Newton una vez afirmó: " Me basta con ver un arbol, un pajaro volando, para saber que dios existe" , si no eres religiosa, se lo puedes atribuir al azar, la suerte .

La Verdad está sencillamente allí, a la voluntad de quien desee encontrarla. Al nacer del sol todos los días se?alando, son sus rayos cuanto debemos saber.

Viene en los vientos que arrullan bosques y monta?as donde duermen los cansados que despiertan. Yo la veo al caer las hojas y gotas de rocío significando La Vida que viene y va. En esas aguas: fuentes, ríos y mares de edades tiempos de encarnaciones y aprender. La Verdad la ven mis ojos y palpita en mis sentidos con la Creación que me rodea.

9uimM9znaa	Yes it was destructive, but it saved his government.  In the summer of 64 Early charged up the valley and would have reached Washington had not Lew Wallace taken too long to be defeated on the Monocacy by superior forces, long enough for the rest of the VI Corps to arrive up from Petersburg and man the forts.<br>  <br>  The defenses of Washington had been stripped to provide Grant with bodies to throw as cannon fodder -- like First Day on the Somme -- against impregnable positions, so all Washington had left to man its formidable defenses were the remnants of garrisons and some federal clerks.  How could Lincoln have been other than grateful for an end to this threat?|`|yyay0UlEaa	President Abraham Lincoln was determined to preserve the Union by winning the war.  In order to do that he was going to have to win the election in November of 1864.  He was opposed by a Democratic candidate, General George McClellan, who favored a negotiated peace.  Lincoln needed victories, so he instructed his commanders to take whatever measures were necessary.  In August Admiral David Farragut captured Mobile, Alabama, and in September General William Sherman captured Atlanta, Georgia.  In the meantime, General Phil Sheridan was defeating the Confederate forces in the Valley and using scorched earth techniques to destroy the primary source of food for the enemy armies.  To Lincoln this destruction was as necessary to eventual military success as were the heavy casualties General Ulysses Grant was suffering in his slow approach toward Richmond.

O la puedes haber preparado antes. No importa. Escribe. Una vez que terminaste dedicate unos dias a otra cosa. Luego revisa el escrito con un corrector ortografico. Ve modificando, ampliando, suprimiendo aquello que ves que es susceptible de ser cambiado. Luego revisalo otra vez, y luego otra y otra hasta que lo que has escrito te deje conforme. En ese momento, revisalo de nuevo. Escribir escriben todos. Escribir algo interesante, cuidado, prolijo... solo unos pocos.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Si piensas hacer un libro, debes empezar por lo principal que es el tema o lo que quieres plasmar en ese libro. Si son historias de amor, etc. Como empezarlo, haz una introducción, por ejemplo, Acá encontrarán historias de amor que son parte de mi vida y otras no, o en este libro encontrarán historias de amor que....etc y empiezas con la primera hoja de redacción, es decir con el primer tema que escogiste para la redacción del libro. <br>  <br>  Debes redactar lo mejor que puedas y luego cuando lo hayas terminado. Vas y sacas el derecho de autor para que no te roben el libro o tu idea. Luego debes dirigirte a la biblioteca Nacional de tu país donde te dirán los pasos a seguir para poderlo editar y buscar una Casa Editorial que te lo publique.

Claro que hay muchos "chantas" que "malescriben" pavadas y hasta copian descaradamente y publican porque se ocupan prioritariamente de su promoción con la complicidad de los mass media, si no... acordate de Bucay, el exponente más reciente de los chantas, que no sólo se jactaba de saber sobre algo en lo que apenas "tocaba de oído" sino que podía llegar a perjudicar a mucha gente con sus absurdos consejos y además... jajaja se copió páginas enteras de otros.

zfRH859aaa	Hola NENE...<br>  ... es Natural...cambiar es sinónimo de desprenderse de algo por otra cosa...nueva o vieja ...no solo se cambia por cosas nuevas se cambia por otras cosas y punto...osea de cualquier forma estas dejando algo para darle o poner en su lugar otra...que pasa conla que estaba?...generalmente al ocupar un segundo plano no es atendida como antes ...esto significa y conlleva a un estado de abandono temporal o parcial y de alli que proviene el deterioro e inclusive la muerte de "X"...por ejemplo ...un Jarron muy lindo en un lugar de cuidado y muy especial donde no le pase nada ni tenga peligros de romperse verdad?...luego de un tiempo fue colocado en otro llugar por X motivo...nisiquiera por colocar otro en su lugar ...vamos a suponer que sea por el cambio de posicion de todos los muebles de la sala...resulta que el porron ya no está tan seguro como donde estaba...pasa un tiempo y ′′′′PRASSS¨¨¨′ se acabó ...se pertio...se murio todo por un cambio...Una flor fue arrancada de su jardin para colocarla en un florero muy lindo ...aguita y azucar...unos dias mas y listo !!!  se acabo murio...porque ? por el cambio a asi hay muchos ejemplo muchos más radicales...pero en fin eso es lo que sucede por lo general...NO preveemos las consecuencias ni estudiamos el estado a posteriori d estos cambios...|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Por la intolerancia!|`|d242c69a06284d001db22d40e58a5a7faa	Porque traen grandes cambios emocionales.|`|8489e4b68640f8bced138229f20c911daa	Porque todo cambio, aún los más beneficiosos para nosotros, llevan implícito un duelo. EL duelo que significa dejar atrás algo, a lo que ya estábamos acostumbrados; sea bueno o malo...y dar un giro absoluto, en nuestra vida, o decisiones...es un duelo. o solo se lamenta lo bueno perdido, lo malo vivido hay que elaborarlo como duelo, para poder enfrentar el cambio a venir.<br>  <br>  Es que a todo ser humano, nos cuesta "cerrar círculos", para poder formar otros.<br>  <br>   Siempre y casi generalmente, quedamos enganchados de alguna hilacha del pasado...y cuesta sacársela de encima, aunque pese más que salvavidas de plomo.|`|MhPmRbM6aa	El primer reto que se convierte en duelo es; el cambio de tu propia vida por todos los cambios que se generan constantemente; de nino a adolescente y seguido a hombre que te convertiria en esposo y despues en padre de familia; los cambios sociales son los mas dificiles de asimilar ya que; casi nunca estamos preparados ideologicamente para los mismos por la razon de que; en ocasiones pensamos una cosa del regimen o gobierno y, no le podemos encontrar la quinta pata al gato; que decir de los cambios ecologicos que constantemente estan deteriorando este bello y maravilloso universo en que vivimos; en mi opinion, estos son los cambios que tantas veces nos enfrentan en duelos.|`|uLxmhxAcaa	Porque cada movimiento que uno hace, afecta la vida de una o varias personas, emocional o fisicamente.

El ser humano es un animal de costumbres. <br>  Te voy a poner un ejemplo facilito: Cada día te levantas, desayunas, te duchas...Nos acostumbramos a una rutina, pero ?Que pasa cuando esa rutina se rompe por x circunstancias? Pues que nos cuesta aceptarlo, ya nos ponemos de malhumor... Eso cuando es un cambio peque?o y con poca trascendencia.<br>  Cuando es un cambio más profundo, es mucho más difícil y el proceso de adaptación es mucho más largo.<br>  Nos cuesta adaptarnos a los cambios, porque la rutina, en cierta manera, nos da seguridad y es por eso que cuando esa rutina es trastocada por un cambio nos cuesta aceptarlo y adaptarnos. El cambio nos quita la seguridad, nos hace dudar, nos hace plantearnos las cosas...<br>  Espero que esta respuesta te sirva.<br>  Por cierto, muy buena pregunta.|`|EVMzFXVEaa	Por que muchos cambios conllevan a terminar ciclos, a dejar ir personas de nuestra vida , el cambio quiere decir que empiezas cosas nuevas asi que dejas otras cosas atras, para que lleguen cosas novedosas a tu vida renaces y abres espacio pero mueren otras, algunas veces duele dejarlas por lo que se siente como su algo de uno muriera y cosas murieran gente muriera por que ya no va estar presente en nuestras vidas, entonces es equivalente a cuando alguien muere y por bienestar y aceptación se pasan por unas etapas de duelo( cuando se cambia o deja un trabajo, cuando cambias de ciudad o residencia, cuando cambias hasta de vestir o te mandas cortar el cabello),,, pero hay cambios que son mas fuertes como por ejemplo dejar la casa de los padres orte avivir solo o casarte, tener hijos, cambiar una vida de confort por otras cosas que quieres hacer en tu vida... dejar cosas duele por el sentimiento de apego que muchas veecs es mas fuerte en otros sere shumanos que se resisten al cambio entre mas apego alla mas doloroso es el proceso de duelo.<br>  <br>  Saludos desde Bogotá!|`|FWEosu2taa	considero que para que los cambios que realizas desde tu interior, y que suelen ser profundos, tienes en cierta manera que matar, lo que consideras es la razón del cambio, tienes que modificar, toda tu estructura, mental, moral  y Espiritual, eso implica un duelo, pues para que nazca algo bueno tienes que matar lo malo, digo matar en sentido de transformar, transmutar, olvidar.<br>   Es un proceso arduo y generalmente dolorosa, pero siempre piensa que será para tu bien, y tu evolución. Te deseo la mejor de las suertes.|`|WqOgN80paa	porque no todas personas estan  dispuestas a tomar riesgos.|`|e8d48f4f0221ece82df0af92598a99c6aa	xq es producido por una decision q a veces resulta ser mala|`|skmkvanAaa	Se convierten en duelos porque los cambios significan cerrar un capítulo en tu vida, todos los cambios llevan el sentimiento de desprendimiento, y sabemos que son para siempre.

The United States, caught by surprise by the dual invasions, was more concerned with the Soviet war in Hungary and the Cold War than with Britain and France's dealings involving Suez. The last thing President Eisenhower wanted was a wider war over Suez. The war itself lasted for only a week, and invading forces were withdrawn within the month. As a result, Egypt now firmly aligned herself with the Soviet Union, which armed Egypt and other Arab nations for the continuing struggle against Israel."<br>  <br>  If you need more info you will find loads and loads of it on the net.|`|yyay0UlEaa	For many years the Suez Canal in Egypt had been owned and operated by the British and French.  In 1956 Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the canal.  Israeli troops invaded the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt and British and French forces then occupied the Canal Zone.

fa6e0b6297e7e184947dc2477a900a48aa	Actually it is more proper to refer to it as "critical theories", since all are arrived at by two different branches.Social theory and literary theory.<br>  <br>  In respect to Orientalism, Orientalism is "a manner of regularized (or Orientalized) writing, vision, and study, dominated by imperatives, perspectives, and ideological biases ostensibly suited to the Orient." It is the image of the 'Orient' expressed as an entire system of thought and scholarship.<br>  <br>  Edward Said's ( Who's work is central to the theories at the present time.) evaluation and critique of the set of beliefs known as Orientalism forms an important background for postcolonial studies. His work highlights the inaccuracies of a wide variety of assumptions as it questions various paradigms of thought which are accepted on individual, academic, and political levels.<br>  <br>  His focus is on how English, French, and American scholars have approached the Arab societies of North Africa and the Middle East. He has nothing on the other areas that traditionally comprised the field such as Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Indian, and Far Eastern cultures, nor does he discuss the attitudes of German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese Orientalists. The period he covers is more restricted than the scholarly field, too, extending only from the late eighteenth century to the present, whereas European scholarship on the Orient dates back to the High Middle Ages. According to Keith Windschuttle.<br>  <br>  His evaluation has recently come into question by Keith Windschuttle. (1999) But has also been questioned by others such as, George P. Landow a professor of English and Art History at Brown University who is critical of  Said for ignoring the non-Arab Asian countries, non-Western imperialism, the occidentalist ideas that abound in East towards the Western, and gender issues in Orientalism.<br>  <br>  Other critics discuss Said’s background when considering his point of view and his ability to give a balanced academic assessment of Orientalism. <br>  <br>  Bernard Lewis, in his publication “Islam and the West”, highlights what he considers to be many historical and ethical errors and omissions from Said’s book and also highlights the political undertones, citing examples of imperialist administrators' publications being referenced as Orientalist academic work to portray Said’s hypotheses. Lewis and other critics of Said’s work feel that omissions and inaccuracies are an attempt by the author to convey his “attitude” and feelings on Orientalism as academic study to underpin his personal beliefs and causes.|`|e8d387d128f1084b73000d45f1315d10aa	not a question - should i report you as i was reported by another?
e8915beec26ac27ee52b8ac0cbbaae90aa	Place: Saratoga on the Hudson River in New York State.<br>  <br>  Combatants: British and German troops against the Americans.<br>  <br>  Generals: Major General John Burgoyne commanded the British and German force. Major General Horatio Gates and Brigadier Benedict Arnold commanded the American army.<br>  <br>  Size of the armies: The British force comprised some 5,000 British, Brunswickers, Canadians and Indians. By the time of the surrender the American force was around 12,000 to 14,000 militia and troops.<br>  <br>  Uniforms, arms and equipment: The British wore red coats and headgear of bearskin caps, leather caps or tricorne hats depending on whether the troops were grenadiers, light company or battalion company men. The German infantry wore blue coats and retained the Prussian style grenadier mitre with brass front plate.<br>  <br>  The Americans dressed as best they could. Increasingly as the war progressed regular infantry regiments of the Continental Army wore blue uniform coats but the militia continued in rough clothing. Both sides were armed with muskets and guns. Many of the Pennsylvania and Virginia troops and militia, particularly Morgan’s men, carried long, small calibre, rifled weapons.<br>  <br>  Winner: The Americans forced the surrender of Burgoyne’s force.|`|yyay0UlEaa	The battles were fought in different New York locations on different days.  The first battle, at Freeman Farm, was fought on September 19, 1777.  The next battle was fought at Barber Farm and at Freeman Farm on October 7.  On October 8 General Burgoyne retreated to Saratoga, where his army became surrounded by the growing American forces.  Realizing that reinforcements were not going to arrive from New York City, he surrendered on October 17, 1777.

yyay0UlEaa	In 1977 United States Representatives Frank Horton and Norman Mineta and Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga proposed resolutions asking President Jimmy Carter to declare the first days of May as Asian/Pacific Heritage Week.  That period was chosen because the first Japanese immigrants had arrived in the United States in May of 1843.  President Carter made the week an annual event in 1978.  In 1990 President George H. W. Bush made May Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

The other Confederate armies surrendered on subsequent dates.|`|yyay0UlEaa	As the Confederate capital of Richmond fell to the Union military forces under the command of General Grant, President Jefferson Davis and the other civilian leaders of the Confederate States of America dispersed and there no longer was an effective government able to surrender.  Also, President Lincoln had not recognized the Confederate States of America as a separate political and legal entity having the capacity to surrender.  The only surrenders were those of the military forces.  As the remaining commanders learned of the loss of Richmond and the surrender of General Lee, they began arranging the surrenders of their forces.  The last major unit surrendered in June of 1865.|`|8b4d77d91392e6f8e9dbf5710098461baa	General Lee gave the surrender to General Grant at Appomatox Court House in 1865. Interestingly, the house the surrender was signed in belonged to a family who also owned the property that the first battle of the Civil War was fought on, four years before.|`|cqld4DZfaa	There has never been a formal Confederate surrender issued to date; The Confederacy fought until late 1865 when the CSS. Shenandoah was captured at sea.<br>  <br>  Robert E. Lee was not the President of the Confederacy, and only had the power to surrender the Army of Northern Virginia; heck Lee did not even have the power to surrender on behalf of the State of Virginia. Thus anything that was agreed upon at Appomattox was only relevant to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and had no bearing upon the 15 States and Territories of the Confederacy, nor did it have bearing upon the Central Government of the Confederacy. <br>  <br>  Thus with this FACT in mind, the "War of Northern Aggression" is still being fought today; however it is a war of occupation in which the Yankee's are trying their darndest to wipe every single symbol and ounce of Confederate culture off the face of the planet.<br>  <br>  The Southern States are not part of America, and remain a colony of the United States - i.e. an Occupied Foreign Nation no different then Poland or the Ukranie during the years of Soviet occupation during the Cold War.<br>  <br>  In order for the Southern States to be readmitted to the Union they would of had to renter on their own accord which did not occur. The Confederate States were invaded, and militarily occupied by a foreign government and remain so to this day.<br>  <br>  When the Southern States requested re-admittance to the Union shortly after the War, they did so not by the will of the people but by the will of the Union generals and their Union appointed politicians running those occupied States.<br>  <br>  Thus in summary, since there was no surrender by the Confederacy, and the States did not request re-admittance to the Union on their own authority, the Southern States remain occupied by the Union, and remain part of the Confederacy and are foreign soil.|`|wrxR6YkNaa	General Lee gave to General Grant at Appomattox Court House.

Z47ETMZxaa	Primera hipótesis<br>  <br>  Los vándalos se establecieron en la región sur de la península pero llegaron a pasar al norte de áfrica, y ocuparon las costas del actual Marruecos. Los habitantes de esta zona los vieron llegar desde el estrecho, dándole el nombre a las tierras del otro lado del estrecho como tierra de vándalos. No queda constancia alguna de que la región se denominara Vandalucía; sin embargo, una evolución de la denominación árabe sería lógica al observar el idioma local. En la lengua que hablaban los habitantes de las zonas ocupadas de Marruecos (bereber o amazigh) los genitivos se construyen a?adiendo la partícula "u" al principio de la palabra. La pronunciación de "vándalo" era en realidad "uándalo", lo que provocaba confusión al decir "la tierra de los uandalos" que en tamazight sería "tamort uandalos", llevando al error de entender "tamort u-andalos" o tierra de los ándalos. Pudieron usar esa denominación durante dos siglos, afianzando así el error y al cruzar el estrecho y darle nombre a la región a?adirle la partícula Al- y dar lugar a "Al-ándalus".<br>  <br>  <br>  Segunda hipótesis <br>  <br>  El término Al-ándal?s proviene de la degeneración lingüística de Landahlauts, nombre en lengua germánica del sur de Hispania con los visigodos y cuya pronunciación era "lándalos". Landahlauts viene de "Landa" (= "tierra, tierras") y "hlauts" (= "sorteo") y significa "tierras de sorteo" o "lote de tierras". Al oír los araboparlantes la palabra "lándalos", por a?adidura del artículo árabe "al", queda explicado el origen del nombre "al-ándalus" o "al-ándal?s" (en alemán "landlos" significa "sin tierra", por ejemplo).|`|1442304c8e04fdde391f0dbcd173f050aa	Me parece que de Al Andalus,<br>  de la época de los árabas en la edad media.<br>  Salu2|`|e3YYWHeqaa	pregunta para catalafu: como q toda hispania conkistada x lo arabes??? no wapa, q yo soy asturiana y aki no pisaron, jajaja ademas, lo q dices d los pueblos vandalos estoy basicamente en contra, n se de donde lo sacaste pero es la primera vez q escucho algo parecido, godos todavia, celtas tb pero alemanes...en mi vida lo escuche... el termino viene de Al- Andalus, osea, tierra fertil, antes llamado la Bética x los romanos, lo d tartessos fue un reino q exisitio en esa zona pero no era tda andalucia ni muchiisimo menos; una adivinanza: sabeis cual es la palabra heredada del idioma arabe q hoy en dia utilizamos foneticamente e igual q los arabes en significado?? ojalá, q significa alá lo kiera... q cosas jeje|`|fj20TsqPaa	del al-andalus arabe<br>  <br>  espero que esto te sirva de ayuda<br>  <a href="http://www.andalucia.cc/adarve/nombreandalucia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.andalucia.cc/adarve/nombreand...</a><br>  <br>  te lo dejo aquí tambien<br>  Andalucía ha tenido diferentes nombres a lo largo de la historia aunque estos nombres se hayan referido, según la época, a un territorio mayor o menor de la actual Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía. El primer nombre que aparece en la historia y que menciona al actual territorio de Andalucía es el de Tartesos ( de las fuentes griegas) o Tarsis (de las fuentes hebreo-fenicias). Lo que significan estos nombres no lo sabemos. En la época fenicio-púnica se le conocía como Ispan, nombre que los romanos generalizaron a toda la península latinizándolo como Hispania. Pero en el caso de Andalucía, los romanos supieron ver a un pueblo diferenciado que vivía en torno a un río y sus afluentes: el Betis, por eso les llamaron béticos a los pobladores y Bética al territorio. Entre Tartesos y la Bética hubo un período en el que Andalucía vivió una especie de desmembración del reino unitario de Tartesos y surgieron reinos que agrupaban a varias ciudades o comarcas más o menos identificados con pueblos que tenían, dentro de la unidad andaluza una identidad diferenciada. Entre ellos destacan los Oretanos, los batestanos y los turdetanos. <br>  <br>  Pero es un misterio la procedencia del actual nombre de Andalucía. Ha existido una versión, ya desechada, que lo hacía provenir de los vándalos -vandalicia, tierra de los vándalos. Lo que sí queda claro es que el nombre de Andalucía viene de Al-Andalus, pero no sabemos que puede significar el término Andalus al que se le ha a?adido el artículo árabe "al".<br>  <br>  La primera referencia que tenemos al nuevo término "al-Andalus" es en las primeras monedas bilingües que se acu?an en latín y árabe pocos a?os después de la derrota de D. Rodrigo en el 711. En estas monedas se identifica el término latino "Hispania" con el árabe "al-Andalus".<br>  <br>  Una versión del significado de al-Andalus nos la da A. Medina en el boletìn "La identidad andaluza" que edita la Yama'a Islámica de al-Andalus que nos dice que Andalus es de origen beréber y viene a significar "tierra labrada y surcada por rios o por un gran rio".<br>  <br>  Otra posible etimología de al-Andalus nos la da Joaquín Vallvé en "El nombre de al-Andalus", Revista Al-Qántara, Madrid. que cree que los vencedores de Rodrigo pusieron el nuevo nombre por una especie de arrebato romántico identificando Al-Andalus con la Atlántida. Isidro de las Cagigas también ve un "cierto olorcillo, sabio y pedante" en la voz al-Andalus.<br>  <br>  El término al-Andalus nunca llegó a ser un concepto geográfico definido si no que fue variando a lo largo del tiempo en función del territorio dominado por el poder central. El uso del nombre se extendió desde su núcleo central -Andalucía- hacia las zonas o marcas bajo su dominio cultural y militar. Es un fenómeno comùn a todas las grandes potencias de la historia. Por poner un ejemplo, el concepto de Grecia en la antigüedad era mucho más amplio que en la actualidad. En la propia península Ibérica se produce el mismo fenómeno con el nombre de Espa?a.<br>  <br>  Está claro que el nombre de Espa?a viene del latino Hispania y que este nombre se impuso entre los romanos después de un periodo dubitativo entre el "Hispania", de raíz supuestamente fenicia, y el "Iberia" de los griegos. Estos nombres fueron variando con el tiempo su contenido geográfico.<br>  <br>  Algunos estudiosos, entre ellos A. García y Bellido, creen que la voz Hispania de los romanos viene del término con que los fenicios denominaban a la península; la voz "saphan" equivalente a conejo, designando "la tierra de conejos".<br>  <br>  Con tener cierta verisimilitud esta teoría creo más acertadas otras explicaciones para el término "Ispan" que es el que nos queda despúes de quitarle el ropaje latino a Hispania. Existe un palabra Hitita -y por lo tanto relacionada con el mundo fenicio- "Ishpant" que literalmente significa noche pero que figuradamente puede ser el sitio donde cae la noche, es decir, el occidente. Otra explicación podría ser que Ispan esté compuesta por dos sonidos, el genérico "an" que en muchas lenguas antiguas viene a significar "tierra" tanto en sus variantes "tan" de Asia como en "lan" del norte de Europa. Por lo que podríamos ver en "Ispan" la tierra de Is (el dios Is era el dios solar adorado en Andalucía).<br>  <br>  Pero lo que nos interesa de todo esto es ver como un nombre que en un principio designa a una zona determinada, va imponiéndose para designar a otros territorios por diversas causas. En el caso de al-Andalus ya hemos visto que este nombre se extiende por la conquista militar y por la gran influencia cultural que ejerce el al-Andalus metropolitano. En el caso de Ispan en un principio corresponde al territorio con el que mantenían relaciones los fenicio-púnicos y pasa a los romanos por sus contactos con aquellos a través de las guerras púnicas. Los romanos van extendiendo el término Hispania para designar a toda la tierra peninsular que van conquistando. Pero de hecho, hasta avanzada la edad media, la voz Hispania no llegó a designar etnográficamente a toda la península, y cuando lo hizo, fue ya con otro contenido etnográfico diferente al original. En los siglos IX y X se identificaba Hispania con al-Andalus y no con los incipientes reinos cristianos del norte .En concreto, la Crónica de Alfonso III, que relata la formación del principado de Asturias durante los siglos VIII y IX, el cronista deja claro que toda la zona norte no era Hispania; incluso uno de los reyes Asturianos, Silo,"tuvo paz con Hispania". A partir del siglo XI Hispania es la negación de al-Andalus. Como dice Menéndez Pidal en "Orígenes del Espa?ol", Alfonso VI de Castilla y León "combatió el sentimiento hispano".<br>  <br>  Otro caso parecido ocurre con el nombre "Iberia" con el que se conocía a la península en el mundo griego. Hiberia, para los griegos del siglo IX y VIII a. de C. era la región de Huelva, y el río Hiberus se identificaba con uno de los ríos onubenses (el Tinto o el Odiel, sin descartar el Piedras). Eso es lo que se deduce la la Ora Marítima de Avieno, que dice beber en fuentes antiquísimas griegas, y del Pseudo-Escimno de Chio, fechado en el siglo V a. de C.<br>  <br>  Como Se?ala A. García y Bellido, no es casualidad que sea en Huelva donde se han encontrado los más antiguos vestigios arqueológicos griegos de la península pues sería esta Iberia la primera que conocerían los griegos extendiéndose este nombre para designar todo el litoral mediterráneo hasta el Ródano. Estrabón, geógrafo del siglo I a. de C., se?ala que "Con el nombre de Iberia los antiguos designaron a todo el país, a partir del Rhodanos (Ródano)....mientras que los de hoy día colocan su límite en el Pyréne (Pirineos). (A. García Bellido. 25 estampas de la Espa?a antigua. pág. 209).<br>  <br>  Pero ?Cómo se extiende el nombre de Iberia por todo el litoral mediterráneo?. Manuel Bendala Galán, catedrático de Arqueología de la Universidad de Madrid nos da la clave en "Introducción al arte Ibérico, Cuadernos de Arte Espa?ol, de Historia-16.<br>  <br>  "Esta expansión del concepto de Iberia, tal como en la documentación literaria se presenta, puede ser bien vista a partir de los resultados de la investigación arqueológica última, mediante la que se comprueba lo que acabo de decir: la expansión de las culturas más evolucionadas del Suroeste peninsular, de timbre tartésico, hacia la alta Andalucía, el Sudeste y el Levante mediterráneos."<br>  <br>  Vemos como esta expansión de lo ibérico coincide con la expansión de la cultura tartésica desde su foco inicial del Guadalquivir hacia el sudeste y levante. También podemos constatar la existencia de varias poblaciones que coinciden en el mismo nombre como el caso de Iliberri (Granada) y Iliberri (Colliure), Iluro (Alora) y Iluro (Mataró), quizás podemos ver en ello, además de la estensión de la cultura también una emigración de parte de la población.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  suerte!!|`|PHrBrVTBaa	Del pueblo germano de los vándalos que se asentaron allí<br>  <br>  Vandalusia (tierra de los vándalos) - Al Andalus - Andalucía (en lo que ha derivado)|`|XS33LFBgaa	el nombre Andalucia proviene del dominio de los arabes en Espa?a y al hacer grandes proezas en esas regiones, en su honor le pusieron andalucia.

Pensemos un poco en las actividades que realizamos hoy en día y vamos a ver, muy, pero que muy esquemáticamente, cómo hemos llegado a la situación actual. <br>  <br>  Un poco de evolución tecnológica <br>  Tenemos varias tareas que hacer a diario como comprar mercancía para nuestra empresa, cerrar un contrato con el banco, atender la reclamación de un cliente, etc. Si los grandes avances tecnológicos que tenemos a nuestra disposición actualmente no existieran, el orden a seguir sería: ir a ver a nuestro proveedor de material y cerrar el acuerdo en su oficina. Más tarde, dirigirnos a un banco para resolver ese contrato que tenemos pendiente y finalmente acudiríamos a nuestro cliente para atender su reclamación. Mucho tiempo invertido. <br>  <br>  Después llegaron los teléfonos y podíamos atender más rápido a nuestros proveedores, clientes y bancos. Más tarde hizo su aparición el fax y empezamos a tramitar documentación de una forma más automática. Seguimos avanzando y llegamos al punto en el que aparecen los ordenadores y comenzamos a escribir la documentación en ellos con programas como Microsoft Word, ahorrando muchas horas de trabajo, aunque todo lo teníamos que imprimir para poder sacarlo del ordenador. <br>  <br>  Posteriormente ese ordenador que no comunicaba con nadie ni con nada, se le a?adió un aparato que se llama módem, capaz de establecer varios tipos de comunicaciones, entre ellas enviar faxes sin necesidad de imprimirlos en una impresora. <br>  <br>  Los teléfonos comienzan a hacerse móviles y los ordenadores son capaces de comunicarse con otros a través de Internet. Los tiempos avanzan rápidamente y las redes de ordenadores se convierten en mara?as que crecen y crecen. <br>  <br>  Llegados a este punto, el intercambio de datos que podemos hacer hoy en día hace que las tareas iniciales de realizar una compra en un proveedor, cerrar un contrato en un banco y atender la reclamación de un cliente se realicen hoy en segundos (incluso existen programas de gestión que automatizan procesos empresariales como éstos para no tener que hacerlos ni en persona). <br>  <br>  El problema de la movilidad <br>  Miramos la tremenda evolución tecnológica que hemos conseguido en muy poco tiempo y nos damos cuenta de un "detallito" sin importancia. Los teléfonos son móviles, ?por qué los ordenadores no lo son? Para ello se empieza a desarrollar tecnología de movilidad como ordenadores portátiles, PDA’s, etc., pero esta movilidad tiene algunos achaques. <br>  <br>  Toda la tecnología anterior se creó sin tener en cuenta el concepto de movilidad y, por tanto, todavía existen demasiadas trabas como para que esa información sea realmente móvil. Hoy en día existen varias soluciones a este problema, sin embargo, nuestra preferida por su sencillez y eficacia es conseguir hacer que un ordenador (con todos sus programas) esté disponible desde cualquier rincón del mundo donde exista Internet. <br>  <br>  Imaginemos que queremos hacer un viaje a la provincia de al lado, bien porque tenemos una delegación allí, bien porque estamos interesados en ir allí por cualquier motivo. ?Cómo podemos acceder a toda la información que tengo almacenada en mi ordenador? Es más, ?como puedo realizar las tareas (atender a un proveedor, contratar con el banco o atender la reclamación de un cliente), si estoy en otra provincia?<br>  <br>  Cómo estar en dos sitios a la vez o por menos parecerlo <br>  La respuesta a ello es conseguir que el ordenador se encuentre accesible desde cualquier lugar con conexión a Internet. Configurando su equipo de una forma muy sencilla para que use los servicios de Terminal Server, por ejemplo, y llevando consigo un portátil con conexión 3G, usted podrá realizar las tareas que realiza normalmente en su ordenador pero estando en cualquier sitio del mundo, incluso en una provincia cercana a la suya. <br>  <br>  Con esta sencilla configuración, usted tendrá el don de la ubicuidad, es decir, podrá estar en varios sitios a la vez o por lo menos manejar uno o varios ordenadores desde donde usted se encuentre. Claro, si hoy hacer cosas, significa realizar actividades en un ordenador, pues pudiendo acceder a los ordenadores desde cualquier punto podría llamarse "don de la ubicuidad". <br>  <br>  Espero que sirva !! , saludos !|`|ITiR5R3saa	Abuelita de Batman.|`|TSRu6oURaa	De ser posible sólo lo es en Dios Creador; ninguna de sus criaturas es capaz de ello.<br>  Saludos.|`|ylX4po9Caa	La ubicuidad o bilocación por la cual estaría en dos lugares al mismo tiempo, es un don de orden sobrenatural ,concedido por Dios para un fin especial  de la Voluntad divina.

Todo don significa regalo, por lo tanto si es regalo está sometido a la liberalidad del eterno, mi función es recibirlo y agradecer en el caso de tenerlo y usar de éste, ya que ma?ana tendré que rendir cuentas del bien que hice y del que pude  haber hecho.En la vida de algunos santos podemos tener una idea de lo que significa el poseer algunos dones como éste; siempre un don es para el bien de otro, esa es su finalidad, decir otra cosa sería desconocer la obra de Dios.

Mientras la nave navegaba cerca de la isla, las sirenas lo vieron y entonaron una suave canción para Ulises y él desesperado por ir con ellas, ordenaba a sus tripulantes que lo desataran pero ellos siguiendo las ordenes que les dio al principio, no lo hicieron y en vez le apretaron más las cuerdas. Los otros navegantes no escuchaban las canciones así que no experimentaban tentación alguna.

En mi vida hay rutinas que me gustaría que fueran eternas... a veces no apreciamos este tipo de rutinas hasta que por algun acontecimiento de la vida dejan de ser algo rutinario y las echamos en falta.

Al menos asi es como yo tambien lo veo. No estas siendo libre pq libre es aquella persona q tiene la capacidad y el acceso a disfrutar y hacer lo q quiera en su vida, no atarse a una rutina el cual lo encierra y practicamente lo vuele un esclavo de si mismo y sus nesecidades. <br>  <br>  Si las nesecidades no nos hacen libre y eso es algo q en la mayoria no se puede evitar. Es algo muy normal. Nesecitamos comer, respirar, etc. Por lo tanto somos esclavos a estas nesecidades las cuales el cuerpo humano automaticamente han vuelto una rutina. Pero cuando se habla de una rutina diaria, como levantarse, darse un ba?o, ir a trabajar, salir de el trabajo ir hacia la casa, etc... ya es un caso diferente pq apesar de q trabajar es una nesecidad y una rutina obligatoria, no tenemos q ser esclavos de la misma y el trabajo no necesariamente nos tiene q hacer esclavos de la rutina. Siempre podemos cambiar lo q hacemos todos los dias. Igual q como por ejemplo, usamos diferentes ropas y estilos todos los dias, estamos rompiendo la rutina. Pienso yo q la rutina te hace esclavo y no te permite ser libre solo si tu provocas y permites q sea de esa manera.|`|ef739a92001b0647107db5b6b9574f21aa	No sé si libres pero por lo menos activos y atentos a todos los percances que puedan surgir.

Yo opino que difícilmente uno puede ser felíz cuando vive una vida forzada y que él no ha decidido, no imagino la felicidad sin libertad, pero la libertad no necesariamente trae felicidad, a veces todo lo contrario.<br>  <br>  Todos deseamos la felicidad para nosotros y para los nuestros, pocas veces le deseamos a alguien libertad.<br>  <br>  Vivimos prisioneros del mundo, del entorno y de nosotros mismos, y buscamos una felicidad inducida que tal vez no sea ni la que nos haga felices.<br>  <br>  Ser feliz para mí es un camino que se halla dentro de uno mismo, sabiendo apreciarse y apreciar lo que tienes alrededor, sabiendo decidir de forma coherente con uno mismo, con sus creencias, principios y valores (esto es la libertad), así uno llegará a ser lo que siente que quiere ser, casi sin darse cuenta de cómo ha llegado a serlo, y entonces es posible que encuentre la felicidad, aunque no sea seguro, es algo que no puede medirse por logros, ni por posesiones, ni por lo que uno hace o deja de hacer, es un estado y como tal hay que mirarla.|`|9d938ce353df376b34dc4d617e4ebc8faa	Son aspectos de un Todo, si eres libre eres feliz, y eres feliz por que eres libre.<br>  Besicos.|`|DlHrw5e5aa	feliz|`|FM0ky4Qqaa	pues las dos cosas|`|G4IhLZNIaa	YO CREO Q SER FELIZ UNA CASA T LLEVA A LA OTRA<br>  <br>  <br>  SALUDOS =)|`|OOgpn1QLaa	No es posible ser feliz no siendo libre<br>  <br>  Bru|`|Pj9Njasuaa	L I B R E !|`|Rt3aJqmRaa	conseguir ser feliz,<br>  porque primero, la vida es mas interesante con eso como objetivo,y segundo, no podes ser feliz sin libertad:)|`|XG1VxPG8aa	Si no eres libre, no puedes ser feliz.|`|cWpp10Ksaa	Al ser feliz ya eres libre.|`|gZeKgcfXaa	Prefiero la felicidad ya que nunca seremos libes hasta que nos desagamos de ese concepto de libertad al que estamos atados|`|kIpkQN6Daa	La verdad os hara libres<br>  y la liberta trae felicidad<br>  <br>  <br>  no el libetinaje|`|ngHVmMDXaa	No entiendo porque no se que es la felizidad pero si la liberta y ningunas me gustan... mientras este trankilo nada me molestara.|`|pRLt6Sgoaa	Se puede ser Libre y ser Infeliz<br>  Y se puede ser Feliz siendo libre o no|`|um8PiSluaa	La libertad trae la felicidad.

Pero tarda periodos larguísimos de tiempo.

Y la mayor parte de las veces, simplemente con los detalles del trato diario, sin necesidad de llevar a cabo grandes cosas.<br>  <br>  También creo que ello, muy frecuentemente, ayuda a hacer de este mundo un lugar más agradable para todos. <br>  <br>  Pero no diría que tengamos capacidad para hacer felices a los demás. Ni grande ni peque?a. Yo creo que sólo cada uno de nosotros es capaz de permitirse o no a sí mismo ser feliz, y es responsable de cómo se gestione sus dificultades en este asunto, las ayudas que busque y los caminos que ande para ir mejorando. él, y no los demás.<br>  <br>  Habrás observado que hay personas capaces de ser felices por encima de tragos muy duros, aparentemente en situaciones en las que la vida está siendo con ellas muy poco generosa, y que entresacan las oportunidades y alegrías que el momento les ofrece, sean los que sean y del tama?o que sean. Y seguro que te habrás dado cuenta de que, también, hay otras personas que, por más que los demás se esfuercen en atenderlas y cuidarlas, y la vida en ofrecerles oportunidades, continúan sintiéndose carentes y desgraciadas, y cuando se comparan con los otros, encuentran que lo propio es peor, y que lo que necesitarían no ha llegado, o si ha llegado, por lo que sea, no vale.<br>  <br>  La vida nos ofrece. Las personas nos ofrecemos, nos damos las unas a las otras, incluso en simples encuentros casuales con desconocidos, como dices.<br>  <br>  Lo que nos hace felices no es el hecho de que nos den, sino la capacidad de tomar lo que hay con alegría, y de hacer de lo que damos un alegre y gozoso intercambio, en lugar de una muestra de bondad que nadie recompensa como merece. <br>  <br>  Quien se orienta hacia la felicidad podrá disfrutar de la belleza y de la abundancia, aun en el caso de que, paradójicamente, "escaseen". Quien se orienta hacia la infelicidad hasta del amor más grande puede sacar motivos de amargura.<br>  <br>  Un abrazo.<br>  <br>  PD.- Y te agradezco mucho que nos recuerdes cómo, con nuestras actitudes, podemos contribuir de un modo tan poderoso a la calidad del ambiente de nuestro peque?o mundo.|`|9scsm6LNaa	Hola, amiga!<br>  Pues en realidad no me había dado cuenta hasta que conocí a mi alma gemela.<br>  Creo que tengo una asignatura pendiente: intentar extender esa capacidad a los demás ámbitos de mi vida.<br>  <br>  Besos!|`|K083kOQVaa	Hago lo posible, por hacer feliz al infeliz.

Tal vez podríamos articularlo con la cuestión del reciclaje de la basura. Hay un arte que se funda en reciclar lo inútil para transformarlo en "algo".Hay en Lacan el elogio de la práxis de la tontería. Hay en Freud la valoración de lo excremencial,y su relación con el ni?o socializado y su prohibición,,en tanto si hay algo que caracteriza nuestra cultura y lo humano es esto mismo de lo residual en tanto peligroso o pecaminoso. Para el animal los excrementos son algo de lo cual nada hay de intocable y además les sirve para marcar sus territorios. Si hay algo que funda nuestras sociedades, es que debe de haber lo intocable o lo fuera de discurso.Por eso dirá Wittgenstein al respecto en su Tractatus "De lo que no se puede hablar es mejor callar" Como último, y tomé creo demasiado en serio tu pregunta ,a pesar de haber comenzado por tratar de ironizar.,"disolvernos es morir". Si hay un reciclaje via reencarnación lo ignoro, por eso acá me detengo.

(comienzo a llorar.)<br>  He finds me weeping (El me encuentra sollozando)<br>  He shouts ugly words, (me grita palabras feas,)<br>  He says its my fault (dice que es mi culpa)<br>  That he suffers at work. (por lo que sufre en el trabajo.)<br>  He slaps me and hits me (Me abofetea y golpea)<br>  And yells at me more, (y me grita cada vez más,)<br>  I finally get free (finalmente me libero)<br>  And I run for the door. (y corro hacia la puerta.)<br>  He's already locked it (El está ya encerrado)<br>  And I start to bawl, (y comienzo a gritar,)<br>  He takes me and throws me (me agarra y me lanza)<br>  Against the hard wall. (contra la dura pared.)<br>  I fall to the floor (Caigo al suelo)<br>  With my bones nearly broken, (con mis huesos casi rotos,)<br>  And my daddy continues (y mi papi continúa)<br>  With more bad words spoken. (diciendo más malas palabras.)<br>  "I'm sorry!", I ! scream ("Lo siento!", grito)<br>  But its now much too late (pero ya es demasiado tarde)<br>  His face has been twisted (su cara se ha torcido)<br>  Into unimaginable hate. (en un odio inimaginable.)<br>  The hurt and the pain (El da?o y el dolor)<br>  Again and again (otra vez y otra vez)<br>  Oh please God, have mercy! (Oh, por favor, Dios, ten piedad!)<br>  Oh please let it end! (Oh, por favor, has que termine!)<br>  And he finally stops (Y finalmente se detiene)<br>  And heads for the door, (y se va hacia la puerta,)<br>  While I lay there motionless (mientras quedo inmóvil)<br>  Sprawled on the floor. (tirada en el suelo.)<br>  My name is Sarah (Mi nombre es Sarah)<br>  And I am but three, (y sólo tengo tres a?os,)<br>  Tonight my daddy (esta noche mi papi)<br>  Murdered me. (me ha asesinado.)<br>  <br>  Me permito a?adir algo más. No me cabe ninguna duda de que la actitud ante el abuso ha de ser la de actuar desde nuestras situaciones personales y hacerlo de dos maneras: No callar y denunciar, si tenemos una mínima sospecha de que en nuestro entorno se está produciendo una situación así. Creo que hay situaciones privilegiadas para detectar el abuso y los malos tratos.<br>  <br>  El asunto me recuerda una libro que apareció en el a?o 2002, Los patitos feos de Borys Cyrulnik, quien analiza este problema habiéndolo vivido personalmente pues sufrió una historia de abuso y violencia colectiva. Internado en un campo de concentración se escapó a la edad de 6 a?os, el resto de su infancia fue un ir y venir por la asistencia pública.<br>  <br>  En el libro el autor nos relata toda una serie de casos que son historias de abuso, violencia física y psíquica. Me emocionó el análisis sobre la vida de María Calas y el origen de su personalidad artística.<br>  <br>  El autor elabora el concepto de resiliencia o lo que es lo mismo la capacidad de los seres humanos de restablecer o recuperar el sentido de sus propias vidas pese a haber sufrido malos tratos, abandonos y abusos.<br>  <br>  La tesis que el autor defiende es que la recuperación del sentido y tono vital de esos ni?os heridos en sus profundidades depende en muchos casos de la recuperación de lazos sociales significativos, coherentes, sinceros, donde el ni?o no se sienta manipulado ni objeto (como fue objeto de la violencia física o tácita del otro). Relaciones de respeto y que restablezcan la confianza tanto en sí mismo como en el otro.<br>  <br>  Lo que me interesa resaltar es que hay una puerta de salida para quien ha sufrido ese infierno y que esa puerta de salida somos nosotros mismos, de una manera muy concreta.<br>  <br>  Los espacios sociales que rodean a un ni?o son la familia y la escuela, cuando la primera falla queda la segunda. Sin embargo hoy, la escuela parece una fábrica de futuros talentos que alguna vez estarán en el mercado, más que un espacio para aprender a ser, para vivenciar y crecer humanamente.<br>  <br>  publicado por JuanBM <br>  <a href="http://cantodeespumas.blogspot.com/2006/04/contra-el-abuso-infantil-psalo.html" rel="nofollow">http://cantodeespumas.blogspot.com/2006/...</a>|`|1e1c3afb910f8fac0247d66894e73118aa	Excelente !!!! hermano y amigo querido !!!!!!!|`|6fa1fbe222f1748e53295397dd95e93aaa	Perrito mojado<br>  Siempre te leo y siempre me emocionás hasta las lágrimas.

Porque para llegar a esa liberación, hacen falta muchos días previos de sufrimiento, que la sociedad permite y recomienda sin más, y esto es exactamente lo que está ocurriendo ahora mismo en los colegios. Por otro lado la educación, que es la excusa para que nuestros hijos reciban esa dosis diaria de violencia, según informes internacionales es la peor .. Pero hemos ocultado los informes de la vergüenza, esperando sacar algún truco de la manga para ver si subimos un puestito la próxima evaluación ?no?<br>  <br>  ?Qué esperamos, a verlos muertos para dar la noticia por la tele? .. La semana pasada hubo una manifestación contra la ense?anza en la calle alcalá en madrid .. y sólo fueron 4.000 seres humanos .. de lo que se deduce claramente que la ignorancia e indiferencia del resto de espa?oles hacia sus propios hijos, es la chispa de la violencia en nuestros colegios .. en los que se educa a los ni?os  para besar el culo al conde, quien les convence de que no se preocupen por nada que él lo sabe todo y dispone de una tecnología que les vá a liberar de todo, por lo que ya se pueden matar los unos a los otros que la tecnología, que es nuestro próximo dios ya arreglará nuestros cerebros .. al igual que ahora los cirujanos plásticos nos arreglan el pito .. yo cada vez estoy más avergonzado del ser humano .. <br>  <br>  Los últimos avances técnicos radiomagnéticos, dicen que se podrá operar los cerebros, y que la humanidad está a merced de que prospere esta técnica, y todo porque no queremos educar bien a nuestros ni?os .. y encima al genio que propició estos avances FARADAY, la sociedad lo trató con despotismo y violencia y murió pobre y enfermo debajo de un puente, donde han puesto un cartelito .. Hemos llegado a un nivel de violencia tan alto, que no nos damos cuenta de ella hasta que alguien querido cae a golpes delante de nuestros ojos .. <br>  <br>  Vergonzoso .. Hay que ir a las manifestaciones .. Ningún noble tiene derecho a robarnos nuestro cerebro, mediante su educación y arreglarlo con sus máquinas a su antojo y conveniencia<br>  <br>  saludos|`|B3GWZsGFaa	me quede sin aliento sin palabras es tan bonito.. a todos los maltratadores violadores los deverian encerrar de por vida y tirar las llaves a mar.....|`|FaBIVARxaa	Gracias por esta última poesía. Por fin, una con final feliz.<br>  Tienes razón, aunque esta campa?a haya finalizado, está en nuestra mano evitar que se sigan cometiendo este tipo de abusos.

Aún queda gente maravillosa por el mundo con la que se puede contar y hacer amistades, e incluso alguna de la que te puedes enamorar y que te haga la persona más feliz del mundo sin juzgarte por el pasado ya vivido.

Kcfz0s45aa	Hola!<br>  <br>  Cierto es que cuando uno se propone algo lo puede conseguir, obvio es que ello va a requerir mucho mas esfuerzo que si lo hubieses iniciado a temprana edad para que tu crecimiento mùsculo-esquelètico se moldeara de manera acorde... el por què inicio diciendo esto es porque si bien es cierto que a nivel de la carrera profesional de bailarìn y maestro de danza clàsica de la Escuela Nacional de Danza Clàsica del INBA ya no tienes oportunidad pues la edad tope màxima es 12 a?os, hay opciones de academias donde màs que clàsico imparten lo denominado contemporàneo y/o jazz que son excelentes opciones, ya que parten de la misma esencia aunque la gran diferencia estriba en la metodologìa y el hecho de que la clàsica no rompe la rigidez de las 5 famosas posturas y el otro estilo (cuya innovadora e impulsora fue Isadora Duncan) parte del principio de permitir al cuerpo se exprese como siente y vibra, no habiendo mas limitaciones que el deseo mismo.<br>  <br>  Lugares los podràs encontrar en la UNAM, la del Centro Cultural Ollin Yoliztli (que inicia su curso de verano y si quieres comunicate a los tels 56 06 0016 y 56 06 85 58 a la brevedad) algunas casas de cultura delegacionales y academias "de prestigio" que obviamente tienen altas colegiaturas (la de Milton Gio, la de Emma Pulido, en la Escuela de Danza de Polanco ubicada en Campos Eliseos y Bernard Shaw, etc. ), por la web puedes encontrar muchas màs).<br>  <br>  Lo importante es que estàs convencido de querer hacerlo y especialmente que estas muy seguro de que su pràctica no tiene ligue paralelo con la sexualidad, por lo que sinceramente te felicito.<br>  <br>  No desistas y que tengas èxito.|`|ELotq5FZaa	NO ERES GRANDE! el baile no tiene edad!!!<br>  si te gusta y l pones empe?o podras llegar muy lejos... aunq tb t digo q no es nada facil!! <br>  lo importante es q seas feliz y estes agusto con lo q aces... yo q tu m pondria a buscar escuelas de baile ya!!! jajaja!!<br>  trabajo y constancia... <br>  muuxa suerte|`|p5Pz5juwaa	Ya varias preguntas al respecto de eso en el foro, he contado como 4 en este ultimo mes, no las conteste yo, no se nada de ballet ni danza clasica.
