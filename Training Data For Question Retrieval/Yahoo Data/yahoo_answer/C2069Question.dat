We had a big argument we made up after that & i didnt hear from him & i didn’t contact him either & 2day he called me after a few weeks & he was acting like nothing is happened he was just asking me how am doing & i told him to call me back later cos i was busy. Why is he calling me(don’t say sex cos there’s no way am having sex with him) after we argued & made up & everything was fine & ignored me 4 such a long time.. Am soo confused.   ? WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?   ? WHAT DO I DO NOW?   ? WITH HIM HE DOESNT TALK TO ME MUCH LIKE I WOULD WANT TO.    (He was like a close book)         After a few months he changed & became very distant, went calling me much & he would argue and yell at me all the time. When we made up everything was ok then he went very distant again and wasn’t calling me at all & i ring him and said ive miss him & that i wanted see him he wasn't straight forward on when i would see or he would yell at me on the phone.       He said i was cheating on him when ive been totally devoted to him he said i was taking him for granted when i wasn’t. I felt really bad that he didn’t know how much he meant to me. he wanted reassurance all the time.
