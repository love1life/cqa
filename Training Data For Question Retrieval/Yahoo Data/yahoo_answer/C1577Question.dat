20090205155827AAKGDgq	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Man dies after being rejected from 14 Tokyo hospitals?!?	Why does this keep happening?-it's a total disgrace. I realize ER docs in Japan are overworked and underpaid-but how about some sort of reform? All that's is needed is for the ambulance dispatchers to know which hospitals are actually able to handle a given patient, and for there always to be a hospital of last resort that will accept any patient regardless. Why is that so difficult?  A little bit of triage please-it's the driving around in an ambulance that is killing people, not the fact that any given might not have a bed at any given moment.

I'm a West Coast gal, but had some thoughts of moving there. I've been told so many bad & hardship stories of people who were born & raised in New York. But do you know of any good websites where I could find more information so I can decide whether I want to live there or not. I know the standard of living there is beyond the roof so what is a reasonable apartment price, say in the $1000+-$2000 range? I feel like this price range would be located in a bad neighborhood. But around here in the West Coast, this price range is pretty good for a decent, working-class neighborhood. The economy is soo bad right now & the unemployment rate keeps rising so I'm trying to make sensible decisions here ---work & to take more classes. If you have any good advice, please post here. But if not, don't bother posting at all.

I'm coming from a wintery climate and know that it's pretty hot where I'm going.  But I imagine that the offices will be air conditioned (it's a very large company in a very large city) and I'm not sure whether I should be taking out my summer clothes for the office?  Or will i freeze?  In particular do I wear light summer shoes or the kind of boots I'm now wearing in the cold weather at home?   I don't know whether they tend to over-chill the offices like they do in some US locations - I imagine power shortages make that more difficult to do?      Any pointers appreciated!   Thanks.

20090205211418AA64kuY	Travel;Australia;Canberra	Should Australia reconsider building the Bradfield Scheme?	Should OZ consider the Bradfield Scheme?  Its crazy that the GOV of OZ is not considering building this scheme in these tuff times.    To all those who don't know what the Bradfield Scheme is read this:    Bradfield Scheme was devised by Dr John Job Crew Bradfield (1867-1943), a Queensland born civil engineer, who also designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Brisbane Story Bridge. The inland irrigation project that Dr Bradfield proposed, was designed to irrigate and drought-proof much of the Queensland interior, as well as large areas of South Australia. The scheme would require large pipes, tunnels, pumps and dams.    The scheme involved the diverting of water from the upper reaches of the Johnson, Tully, Herbert, Burdekin and Flinders rivers. These Queensland rivers are fed by the monsoon, and currently flow out into the ocean. The water would enter the Thomson River on the other side of the Great Dividing Range and eventually flow south west to Lake Eyre.    Basically building huge dams to hold the flood rains from the monsoon and clyclone rains and diverting to rivers so that they flow inland to lake Eyre.    The benefits of this scheme would be huge it would turn inland deserts and dry plains in to lush grasslands and would in-cease our farming production and potential.    Do you agree or have any more info?

20090205212926AAeLEfM	Travel;Cruise Travel	Do you know anyone who has gone on a cruise alone or with their child?Please help.Quick decision needed.?	So basically here's the deal... I want to go on a cruise with my 21/2 yr old son in March. Tomorrow I can book it once I determine whether I'm going or not. I asked everyone I knew to go on the cruise with me including my grandmother who all said the timing was off. This is the only time I can go on a cruise this year but there are a few issues. My 2 yr old is extremely active and doesn't listen and he often runs from me. My grandmother has been on several cruises and said that he can't run on the deck. I wouldn't let him run, but I am terrified of him running off and falling over the deck or something.       My grandmother also said that she went on cruises with her friends and that it might not be fun unless I go with someone. If I do go my son will be at Camp Carnival(child activity care) for a few hours without me. Although Carnival swears their sitters are licensed and deg reed it bothers me alot. Will my son be depressed without me there? Will that make me a bad mom? Is it safe for us to go alone? We are going to cozumel and progresso yucatan. I'm scared and nervous. What should I do? Please help me. Who will I talk to or be with when there? What was you're experience??
