20090304143324AAg9Dt9	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How do the manufacturers of that assemble-at-home furniture (mainly desks, I guess) make the pits that the __|?	cam connectors sit in where they get spun around the cam bolts, without drilling the kind of small holes all the way through that I'd end up drilling with one of my spade bits because of the tip in the middle?      The kind of pit the manufacturers drill or cut has a flat bottom and doesn't have any spot that pokes all the way through or even indents beyond that. I need to recreate those pits because part of the board wall around the perpendicular pits--where the cam SCREWS sit--got torn out. As deep as the wider cam pits have to be to accept the cam connectors, the spade bit would be guaranteed to poke its little tip all the way through the board. Yes, I could do this with one those, but I'd prefer to avoid the poke-through hole if I can. How would I do that? What kind of bit does that? Or is it a whole different kind of tool?      Even an extra-big traditional twist bit would leave a cone-shaped dip in the bottom of the hole. This wouldn't be noticeable visually (from the other end of the board or from the cam end once the cam is inserted), but it might make the pit less stable mechanically, because I think the cam prefers a flat surface to rest against. Agreed?      Wouldn't even a Forstner bit drill a little tip hole all the way through in the center? Even that kind of bit has a little screw tip in the middle that I think might poke all the way through.      Even a hole saw doesn't work its magic without having to cut all the way through, because there's no way to cut across the bottom of a pit with one of those. Even those do have twist bits in the middle, anyway.      So... what in the world do these guys use?         Will you come back and see my responses to your answers, please?      Thanks,   Mike Christensen

20090304152535AAQKkRv	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Remodeling Kitchen Need Counter Top Help?	We are remodeling our kicthen and have been looking at granite counter tops best price was around 6 grand thats more than our cabinets. My mom really likes granite but if we could find a good look alike of laminate(in the colors we want) or some other that would also be good. I was elected to look online for some pricing but cant really find any. We are looking at space black granite or chicory mosaic granite. Is there anywhere to find a better price than lowes or home depot. The only good thing about lowes is my dad gets a 10% military discount but it is only up to a certain amount. Anyone a counter top specialist? pro's and con's of granite?

20090304153922AAG9aJG	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Washing machine faucet leaking...?	We just moved in to our first house and have encountered our first issue.      Where the washing machine hoses hook into the wall for the hot/cold water faucets we have a leak. If you screw the hose all the way on then turn the water on it drips around the faucet. It still drips even with the water turned all the way on. Our set-up is weird because the turn knob is actually on the bottom of the spout so it drips down from the knob.      Someone seemed to mention a rubber washer would be the fix, but then someone else mentioned we may need the whole faucet replaced which means calling a plumber, woo lol.      Any ideas?
