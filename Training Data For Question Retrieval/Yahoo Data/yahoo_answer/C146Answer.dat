irHF6CBPaa	Where I live it is 4,500 for a vaginal birth for a C-section is a 6,500 or so but you can appyl for medical if you don't have a ny insurance most family's qualify for full or pacial coverage  it cover prenatal care and hospital|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If you don't have insurance and you let them know before hand you will be a cash payment they can usually keep costs down and get you and baby on your way home a couple hours after birth. But it will still cost you at least $5000.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I was told that it would cost about $12,000 to give birth if I didn't have insurance.|`|alJA3jyCaa	I paid for my daughter in cash in advance the hospital was $2900, OB doctor was $1500, the anesthesiologist was$ 280, lab bill $800 (she paid) so for her alone $5480. After the baby was born she qualified for aid  beforehand she made a little to much. So the state paid for the baby's bill and bills after wards. Oh, she didn't have any complications.|`|hAuemuWTaa	Well where i am from medicare covers the costs. And being in a health fund will give u more benefits. Am from Australia. Where r u from?|`|By2ZR1lfaa	free thank god i boy if i laddy girl womean my but i payy yoo upp g i kool|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Are you guys serious? It costs 1000s? I am so thankful that it is all free in Canada.|`|cO9sxO9raa	It depends on where you live but I know at the hospital I go to it is just a little over 8,000 for a birth without complications, but prices skyrocket if there are problems. Also they charge for each day you stay in the hospital so it gets CRAZY expensive.|`|qJaKF24naa	You can call the hospital and they will probably be able to tell you. Because it will be thousdans but there may be one hopsital cheaper than another.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	my hospital bill without compilations was 30,000 and for my son it was 10,000|`|RjdrO7DVaa	thousands ... if you dont have health care...then apply for state health care...usually, the state will cover all of the pregnancy and birthing costs. if the mother is uninsured|`|xrNzLYhAaa	Depends on the Hospital.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	In the UK : FREE<br>  <br>  At least the NHS is good for something!
W1p6LetFaa	Talk to your doctor about some other medications if it is seriously interfering with your everyday life.  My doctor finally agreed to put me on a prescription for Protonix, and it has been a lifesaver!  Otherwise, if you'd prefer to stick with the over the counter meds, you can take up to 150mg of Ranitidine (I think that's how you spell it.  It's the generic name for Zantac).  That helped me as well, it was stronger than the Tums, but after a while it just wasn't strong enough for my heartburn.  Talk to your doctor about your options!|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	i know this is going to sound funny....but i had bad and i mean BAD heart burn with both of my pregnanacies....and my mom told me this old wives tale......to eat a raw potatoe......and honestly it worked......i would cut up a potatoe.....and eat it...with abit of salt....it worked for me!!!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Talk to your doctor.  When I was pregnant I had such terrible heart burn that it made me throw up.  My doctor prescribed some heart burn medicine that I took twice a day every day.  It really really really really helped!|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Ask your Doctor if you can get a prescription for Nexium. Its amazing, way better than Zantac and all the other stuff that does not work well.|`|OYjZM4Pjaa	I feel your pain sweety. I am having a serious heartburn attack right now. I could never get relief from tums, with my first pregnancy, and when milk stopped helping I started taking Zantac. This time around I try milk if it is a mild case. When it is more severe, I just go for the Zantac (or the generic form I should say). I wish I had not left my pills at home.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	drink a glass of milk at the beginning of the day to coat your stomach...and if you get heartburn by dinner, just try drinking a little before each meal.  you can always use the calcium!  dont exceed the 3-4 a day though because too much calcium could lead to kidney stones.|`|T62wmtv5aa	You can buy apple pectin capsules at a whole foods store. They are all natural apple pectin that will help absorb the stomach acid and make you feel much better. Or you can just try eating a couple of apples per day but I found the capsules worked better.|`|qJaKF24naa	Try tums, if that doesnt work try to follow the pattern of what foods your eatting and when you get heartburn after that because maybe your eatting something to cause it. Other than that may be time to speak with th doctor for alternative ways to get rid of it|`|E0SJx3Csaa	omg! don't drink milk with heart burn !!!! it soothes it for a minute and then makes it worse!!! look it up ! water is the best acid neutralizer. <br>  i am preggers too and i take pepcid ac, it works good. and even though it says on the box "ask if pregnant", the doctor said it was safe.|`|ePpgWES6aa	How far along are you?  My doctor actually put me on prilosec but she wouldn't do it until I was 30 weeks.  It worked wonders and is not harmful to baby.  You should ask your dr about it.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	milk will help.|`|d1cd0572dd4557d60be55e79d8e77e9baa	MILK!! was a great helper for me ;)|`|ErCHGVsTaa	Saltine crackers are a great help for me. wash em down with a little milk and your good to go|`|1s3nddaYaa	milk does me good when i have heartburn|`|dPULl5hjaa	If tums doesn't work, then it's time to see a doctor.

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Whatever you eat and drink passes into your breastmilk. As well as being full of additives and sugar or sweeteners, this type of drink will keep your baby awake for hours! When the baby's feed pattern has settled down and you get a couple of hours between feeds, then you'll be ok to have one now and then. Until then, avoid them if you can.|`|AA11903503	I have done it a few times now and it seems to have had no effect on my baby boy. It did not keep him up at night, did not make him sick, and he didn't get the jitters :-)<br>  I wouldn't drink more than one at a time, then you might get a gassy or wide awake baby.<br>  Just because it passes through your breastmilk doesn't mean it has the same effect as it does on you. You'll be fine, you don't have to stop living your life or enjoying the things you like because you are breastfeeding, just use your head and think.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	when in doubt don't. i heard it's not good to. bc of the high amount of caffeine and taurine etc. even adults shoudlnt be consuming that stuff let alone babies even though it would be in trace amounts as it is only in your breast milk.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Hey hun!  When I was born my mom was drinking coffee like crazy and breastfeeding.  She was going crazy because I wouldn't sleep LOL!  This was 30 years ago and in all honesty she didn't know any better.  You are not alone and no one should make you feel stupid for asking a question.  Good luck hun
DvWGTzLUaa	It got me from 0cm to 4cm in 6 hours with only strong period like cramping. Wasnt really in labour though as things didnt progress any further. So they broke my water and had my daughter 8 hours later! Good luck!
j7fzuDxgaa	around mid cycle is the best when your ovulating. you will notice you have a discharge of what looks like raw egg whites it will be stretchy. that is a sign of ovulation|`|AIJgbvIcaa	Its usually right around the 14th day of your cycle. So in the middle :)|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Halfway between when you are ovulating|`|sqbuYfJQaa	When you are ovulating about 2 weeks after you start your period. That's when I got pregnant anyway.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	later on.  Get an ovulation kit and follow it right after your last period day.|`|hAuemuWTaa	Any time but its rare. They say u r most fertile two weeks appox from the time ur period starts.|`|TvuILSmYaa	both, I guess...?|`|AA10015577	Everyone is different as well as every cycle.  It is best to try about two weeks into the first day of your period.  It is possible to concieve anytime but best in the middle.  Again, if you have a 28 day cycle or regular cycle there is still a chance that you may ovulate earlier or later for no particular reason.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	You become pregnant during ovulation. It is possible to become pregnant before you ovulate as the sperm can stay in you for a while. The closer to the time you ovulate, the better your chances at the end of the month.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	You are most fertile during ovulation, which is approximately 14 days before your period begins. If you have regular periods this is easy for you to calculate, if you are irregular, then it requires more guess work.|`|qJaKF24naa	Usually you ovulate mid cycle, so that is when you are most likely to get pregnant, But it is possible for some women to get pregnant right after their cycle or right before.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	10-14 days from when your period ends is the best time.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Later on when you're period stop. Most likey you would become pregant|`|0NwZPBgQaa	your right...later on! you if try after you period then you wont be releasing any eggs and the chances that a sperm will ferilize your egg is slim... so wait|`|RuuQWpFLaa	its easier to become pregnant around your period date.<br>  i learnt it in health last year|`|qe3NQIwgaa	the way my anatomy teacher explained it was....<br>  <br>  there is a hormone in your body and they are at their peak just after your period. it is only released then. and as the days go by, the hormone level decreases, and the layers of skin inside you start to die. (the hormone is what keeps things inside you healthy for a baby.) <br>  <br>  now when you have sex, if the sperm and egg join, the baby releases that same hormone.. but constantally. the baby has to be able to bring that level up to 100% healthy to survive.. if she/he cant bring it up in time, it is flushed out with your period...<br>  <br>  sooo.. its easier right after.. and best when ovulating. but not impossible at the end.<br>  <br>  but remember everybodys body is different.<br>  if your trying for a baby good luck to you, and be patient.<br>  and if not dont take anyones advice and not protect yourself at the end of your period.<br>  <br>  hope it helps.|`|wZtv16syaa	The best time to get pregnant is when you are ovulating. When you ovulate depends on your cycle length and the date of your last period. Try this website <a href="http://www.ovulation-calculator.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ovulation-calculator.org/</a> . Good luck.|`|eIspYL3Waa	Its easier when your ovulating...Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the day the last menstrual period starts or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period.|`|JI1EpWX6aa	10-14 days after your period ends|`|hrJOMHNmaa	later on.|`|VbEDYw7Gaa	it is easier to become pregnant after your period.|`|vD2CUvq8aa	From what I know, it is usually before your next one.|`|ErCHGVsTaa	either or, doesn't really matter. strive towards the middle more or towards the end. beginning, not so much|`|CdQYCQx4aa	I think later ons best but try keeping it around the days of your next period|`|KbcdLsz3aa	yea lter on cuz the process is fresh and just starting over so the egg can easily gt fertilized then|`|sHHZttxlaa	yeahh later on but get a shedule down for your time of the month to be most ready to be preganant|`|AA10312653	when ever you ovulate
1oJ1qokjaa	it depends. half my school is mature and the other half is sooooo dirty.  i'm one of those good girls who is waiting 'til marriage. im never taking a study hall again after this semester! (I'm only a freshmen) our study hall is really big (like 2 classes together) and i sit in the back. unfortunately, these low-class straight-d freshmen students sit all around me. the whole time they talk about all that stuff. they are mostly guys but talk freely with the dirty girls about it. like they take it wayyyyyyy too far! they have been talking about making a porn video and like plan it out and are asking girls in my study hall to be in it! and how theyll have nicknames for the girls and what they are going to do in the video. ewwww! i hate listening to them. they are such jerks and they just look at your chest all the time and treat girls really badly. like objects.  im prob going to have to switch seats. literally, not a single convo they've had has been un-related to sex in some kind of way.  they go up to girls and are like, "your my breast-friend." it's sick! what they talk about is sick and they are sick and i hate them!  i'm not racist, but most of the people who are having sex are mexican.  my school is like 45% white 45% mexican 10% asian or black or indian or other.  they always call me "white girl" in my study hall because there are like 3 white girls in my whole study hall and i sit closest to them.  today they called me 'girl with the purple pencil' when one asked if they could borrow my calculator if i had one. i had one but like i would give it to one of them! ha! my school is like half-disgusting and half-okay.  it is soooo annoying. i wish i went to christian school. like everyone is so immature at my school. honestly, i mean come-on, get some class.  they are so retarded and are going no where in life.|`|5tqh0akYaa	im in middle school. Yeah i hate a lot of the people there , they are thugs and idiots. They will be working at taco bell lol. They are always cussing and girls are slu*s. There has been abortions, sex with 18 year olds, pregnancy scares. The world is going to hell =p|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Not really, I go to a Catholic School and a lot of the people there are waiting until marriage to have sex.<br>  You do get the occasional "she had a threesome with ____ and ____" or "did you see that video of ____ and ____ having sex behind the water tanks" but other than that, no.|`|bkgyzCdOaa	starting to think all schools are like that...<br>  hell, i'm in jr high with flippin 12, 13, 14 and the occasional 15 year old.<br>  it's sad, really. <br>  school police officer said there's already been 7 pornography cases...this year. not school year. as in 2009. it's FEBUARY!!! one just last week, like 12 kids got suspended. ONE WAS TWELVE! what is this world coming to?|`|5faMERXXaa	no one talks about people having sex, since i'm in middle school.|`|2QvIM81Haa	Nope, mines not like that.|`|zkPaAXlmaa	same here this one grl had sex in the woods and another had sex with a guy that she didnt go with for no reason
7at1Hyn8aa	It is wrong, because you cannot force another persons love.  He has to want to be with you of his own free will.  If you are still minors, than you will have to wait until both of you become of age, so you both can say that you made that decision on your own accord.<br>  If you get pregnant for the purpose of forcing the situation, he will eventually figure it out and he will resent you for it.  And you will have some resentment feelings towards the baby, because the child could not do for you what you were hoping for.|`|1s3nddaYaa	just cause you have a baby, it will not keep the father with you.|`|t0mb150gaa	A child is not meant to hold people together. You have children because you want to add to your already loving family ..not as a way to start a life with someone.  You need to be emotionally and financially ready and with a partner that is the same. If your a minor do you really have any plan as to how you would pay for a baby?an apartment?food?clothes?<br>  bills?a wedding? And could you give a baby the best out of life? Would you finish school? what would you do if your boyfriend left you after you had the baby? I know you don't want to hear that you are very immature but you are just look at the reasons you want a child at your age..they are selfish reasons! To be a good parent you cannot think of yourself first, your child comes first and until you can answer these questions and have a better reason then just being selfish then you are not ready for the responsibility a child brings.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	Whatever we say on here, you are going to have your baby one way or another, so just get on with it.<br>  <br>  But you sound like an I want, I want, I want, it's all about me type of person.<br>  <br>  You should never bring a child into the world until you have enough money to give it all the good things in life.  Good parents, good home, good education.<br>  <br>  The conceiving bit is usually the easy bit.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Yes. Think of this. You do get pregnant. The daddy decides he's not ready and leaves anyway. Now, you're stuck raising a child alone and can end up resentful that the "glue" that was supposed to keep you guys together failed. <br>  <br>  You have a child because you want one, not to keep someone with you. That usually ends badly for everyone.|`|G4wEL4qoaa	It is morally wrong.  This is a bad idea.  DO NOT DO IT.  Unless you have your parents blessing(doubt it) DO NOT DO THIS.  You ARE too young and immature.  Im only 18 and I can see that.<br>  <br>  I don't care if you made a decision, that doesn't mean its a good one.  You are too young to make this decision.|`|BTuFtui3aa	Having a newborn is rewarding, but it's also difficult and stressful. It actually is likely to split apart a relationship that isn't strong enough to stand on its own. Babies don't fix things in the real world like they do in books and movies.<br>  <br>  A baby won't keep you together. If you want to be together... be together. Make the commitment, and do it. If your relationship is shaky enough that you think you need to have a baby to make it last, it won't survive the stresses of parenthood.<br>  <br>  If you and your partner want a baby because you're ready to be parents, then have a baby for that reason. But having a baby to try to cement yourselves together will only end up hurting your relationship. Your reason for wanting a baby isn't realistic. Sorry.|`|Ld5Mooujaa	That does sound like a wrong reason to have a child. It doesn't sound like you're prepared to bring a child into this world (either of you) and this decision should not be about you or him but about the child. You should be stable in a relationship together (and preferably in the same state) before you have a child together.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	just because you get pregnant doesn't mean that the father will stay around. and it is wrong to just get married because of a baby, you may end up wondering later on in life if he married you just because he got you pregnant.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	I got pregnant when I was 16...Dad took off and slept with all of Baltimore City. I had another child when I was 19 with a man I was with for several years. He took off. Having babies chases most men away. I say dont get pregnant and you will have him 4 life|`|EVcqB9ehaa	It sounds like you've already made up your mind.<br>  <br>  But I still think this isn't a good idea.  Just enjoy being a kid. <br>  Really.  Waiting isn't a bad thing.|`|YVgIshUJaa	i dunno|`|jIyvb2OOaa	yes but i do it all the time|`|2zMtWFnNaa	Sometimes we don't have a pat answer as to why we want children.  I AM a mother, that is who I am.  It is my career, my destiny.  Some people grow up and want to be a doctor.  Problem with society today is that if your daughter says that they want to grow up and be a mother, there is someone there to tell her that she needs a real job or career.<br>  <br>  As far as getting married, moving in together and spending a wonderful life, this is what all of us dream (most of us anyway), but it doesn't always work out that way.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to take care of yourself and your baby without someone in your life in case your dreams don't pan out.<br>  <br>  All young folk want to grow up, but you have to look at all of the grown up things that you would be responsible for.  There is no one to fall back on once you take that leap.<br>  <br>  Parents are responsible for their children, so you must be responsible for your own self first.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how old you are, but take a hard look at why you want to be out on your own.  The rules are actually tougher when you are an adult.  The consequences of mistakes go far beyond having your cell phone taken away or being grounded for a week.|`|bc70e3a16900c4dd03ebe4dc89b0161daa	Well it is going to be difficult for you to get a well thought and educated answer because you limited the responses by saying what you dont want to hear.<br>  Well, speaking from experience, it is hard for a teenager to make such a life changing decision, because you simply do not have the experience or even the maturity required for this decision.  You see, if you get a dog and it doesn't work out, you can give him away or take him to the pound.  A child will change the direction of your life forever.  There are no do-overs, no turning back.<br>  So you should wait.  Wait until you get a taste of life, real life outside of school, and living home with your parents.  Go to college and live a little because you definately have the rest of your life to have children.<br>  Sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear but it is from an adult who has been there.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless!|`|wZtv16syaa	It is not a good idea. Having a baby is not going to help a relationship work. In fact it only puts everyone under more stress and will probably lead to the relationship ending sooner. If it is the only reason that you want a baby do yourself a favor and get on birth control.|`|T0Kg2IHSaa	I would go with what my heart tells me.<br>  (sorry for the bad answer its all i could think of)
aJLx0nhNaa	Well, this is a tough one.  I doubt they are doing it on purpose to trouble you.<br>  <br>  Why not just say what you've said here: "I want some time where you give my kid your undivided attention."<br>  <br>  We have a somewhat related issue - my MIL is incredibly possessive of my son as he is her only grandchild.  My parents have several grandchildren and so when we are all together my MIL hogs my son.  I think she thinks its sort of her right because they have other grandkids.<br>  <br>  When we are all together with my niece, my niece (she's a preschooler) hogs my mom.  We try to arrange some time for my parents to get to just hang out with my baby, because otherwise they'd never get to hold him.<br>  <br>  I think there's a way to present this really nicely and get what you want.  It's actually kind of a compliment, so emphasize that.  Baby needs his grammy!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I don't think selfish is the word at all. More like "hurt" and rightly so. But also I don't think you're seeing the whole picture here and all angles. I mean, think about it: your mil had to fuss over the 16-month-old bc they demand to be fussed over, even though she shoudlve been watching her other grandson's play/perfrmance. and maybe ti woudlve beenn better if the mother actually was taking care of him during the show. also, mothers tend to be closest to their daughter's children, not their son's. It isnt fair, but the way it is, bc it's somebody else who had the child in your case, and you aren't her daughter, so it's a different dynamic. And your sil is the aunt to your kids---maybe she wants to see her nephews, her babies to see their cousins? and she has every right to want that. and maybe it's too hard for her with two small babies to come by herself ever, and it's probably fun for them to all go out together---your mil is apparently a huge support system to your sil, and shes her mother she should be. and it probably gets your sil out of the house as with two babies it's hard to. they probably have no clue you feel this way. <br>  <br>  It makes me wonder if that's how my sil feels about me and my baby though lol. i try to see my brother his daughter and her as often as possible so i almost always go with my mom. my niece is 10 mons and my daughter is 7 mons. sometimes my mom ends up paying more attention to my baby than my niece her other granddaughter but only bc she is so used to my baby and just does it out of second nature.<br>  <br>  I do however think it's a little silly that your mil has to bring them ALL the time. I mean, the only reason why I go often whenever my mom goes is bc they live 3 hrs away and i would never see them and i want to see my niece more as they grow so fast if it weren't for my mom going. but even then, like last time she went, id dint go. i go about every other visit, bc i do want to give my mom alone time with her other granddaughter. but maybe this has never occured to either of them that you want that for your kids. Maybe your mil would like to see your children alone sometime, but doesnt have the heart to turn her daughter down. <br>  <br>  Maybe one day you could just subtly give a hint? I agree your mil should give one-on-one time with your children as they are her grandkids too. and I agree it's a little excessive to have the sil and her kids ALWAYS come along. I'm sure it's bc she just wants to see her nephews too, and have her children see their cousins, but your children do deserve that alone time with their grandma.<br>  Invite your mil over for dinner. Say specifically "just her" that your husband and you just want to make "Grandma feel special".<br>  <br>  edit---reading this over i feel i come across like i'm defending them, i'm not...it's just im just trying to help you see why they're doing this and that it's not on purpose or to hurt you...but i do think it's wrong of your grandma but she just doesnt know, nor does your sil.|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	Is your SIL having problems?<br>  If she is always working than I suppose I see why the MIL would take them.<br>  If the MIL is just taking the kids for the heck of it, and your SIL is available to watch them herself, than it is not fair!<br>  When your MIL comes to visit you, she should you and your family.<br>  She can see the other kids any time.<br>  Though it is bringing cousins together, it is not fair to neglect your children.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i'd sit down and explain to them exactly what you said here, it's the best way to make them understand how you feel, good luck. i have the name issue in my in laws, they all want to be called by their first names and i think children should call adults by ms. sarah or grandma or aunt sara etc, good luck.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I dont think you are being selfish. If you SIL was invited and came, you would expect her to bring her children but that wasnt the case. If I invite my aunt, I expect her to bring my 4 year old cousin but she would call and ask before bringing any other tagalongs. I think its kind of rude that she would never consider just coming out to see your kids kind of like they are just not enough for her. Sorry I dont have any great advice. Maybe your hubby could just casually mention next time there is an event that it is limited seating and only she and her husband can come or something like that. Good luck!|`|iwtetdBoaa	you sound like me 100% we need to talk more lol<br>  <br>  my mom & dad live like 5 mins from me they never hardley ask to help me out or even watch my kids & it hurts<br>  <br>  my mother n law never even seen my kids or even ask to see there photo i have  sent some in the past but i feel like why should i send if they never even ask for a photo<br>  they live in india tho so thank god for that lol<br>  i feel like eveyone is missing out but oh well we or great moms dont worrie about it   , time gos to fast - one day i might not be there for them!   <br>  <br>  i love my kids   3 & half ur old little girl - 13 month old little boy- 2 week old little girl    just think there missing out there lost! <br>   i also love my fam to death  just seems like they dont do to much-but its not there place but dont they want to see there grandkids (ever)?|`|NEPUONqyaa	i would probably feel the same as you do. maybe try having a sit down conversation and explain how important you feel it is for your kids to have a close bond with them and explain you feel your kids should get undivided attention too. you could probably also talk to your sil and explain your kids arent able to even spend one on one time with them. expressing your feelings always helps. good luck!
S7vNqiOpaa	I still do lol. I'm 6 weeks and 4 days. I dont think theres anything wrong with it. It will be harder to do once your belly grows bigger, obviously.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything hun!|`|OCTvfDsxaa	You can keep shaving as long as you can reach it!!! Check the hair removing creme you use though.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	hair removal creams are not recommended for pregnant women .. but shave until you cant see it anymore|`|AA10015577	It's perfectly fine, do it until you can't because it gets very difficult.|`|AA10331655	Yes its safe but i wouldnt use the hair removal just use shaving cream or soap
hh5E9n4Oaa	Your not the only one, actually when I was a child I took my brothers diaper off and smeared it on the wall.  Children are fascinated with feces, I wouldn't make a big deal of it, or say it's gross after all it's a natural human thing, and your children are just curious about it but just explain kindly that we don't play with poopy because it's unhealthy.  Explain that poopy goes in the potty or in a diaper than the trash but not on the walls.|`|dFereHE6aa	I did that when i was little. My dad's parents told them to sticky tape my dipper on with packing/gaffer tape whilst i was in bed, then they can't get off the dipper until you take off the tape for them during the day.<br>  <br>  Worked for my parents. :)<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, do try to explain it's bad, but that barely ever works.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i'm sure you've probably thought of this but how about putting those plastic underpants over the diaper when she's in the crib.|`|M2yERqNSaa	3yrs old and 17 months is really not that close in age<br>  <br>  your kid needs her butt whooped if she does it again|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	they are artists...all kids do that at least once|`|Hl7OvXruaa	omgsh... that gave me a good laugh.. kids will be kids but you need to start doing timeout because this is dangerous.. as you probably know feces carry many bacteria that can get the children very sick.. make sure you wash all the poop down with a good soap and water!
W1p6LetFaa	I guess I cannot truly answer your question because I haven't had my baby yet, but I am due on Monday.  I will just say that yes, it will definitely change your relationship with your soon to be husband, because even just being pregnant has produced some MAJOR changes.  I can only imagine how different it will be when our little girl gets here!  And I have been told that yes, labor is probably the most painful experience that you will have in your entire lifetime.  But all of the women who have told me that have also told me something else, that it is WORTH EVERY SECOND of the pain.  Don't worry about it too much, sweetie, you still have plenty of time before you have to start thinking about this.  You will probably feel a lot better about it after a few years with your husband, you'll see.  In fact, I was never too keen on having a baby until I got married, then it was ALL I could ever think about!  We originally planned to wait 4 or 5 years before starting a family but only lasted a year and a half into our marriage before getting pregnant.  You'd be amazing how quickly you might change your mind.  And it will all be amazing, and it will all be worth it.  I promise!  Good luck, sweetie!  Congrats on your future marriage!|`|dNlCfhD2aa	Fearing the pain of child birth is very common, but remember, women have been doing it for thousands of years.  After the pain is gone you will have a new baby to show for all your hard work.<br>  As for children being exhausting, yes they are, but it is different when it comes to your own.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	The pain will be the worst you'll ever experience in your life (barring any major accidents), but its a different kind of pain. Its totally manageable. Everyone gets through it. I didn't have an epidural and I managed although there was a point I was crying telling the midwife I couldn't do it anymore!! lol. But 2 secs later I was back pushing for all my life was worth! I don't deal well with other peoples children, even nieces and nephews. I have limited patience for them and I find them exhausting. But when it comes to my daughter my patience is limitless and while shes awake I have all the energy in the world for her! Everybody worries about these things. As long as your having a child for the right reasons it will always turn out good! Good luck!|`|OYjZM4Pjaa	my hubby and I were married for 4 years before we started trying. Honestly we didn't expect to get preggo on the first try, but lucky us. We were so not ready for it financially (stupid to assume it would'nt happen right away I know). But we got through it ok. As far as the pain is concerned... yeah it was pretty bad. For me it didn't feel like bad menstral cramps like I had heard. To me the best I can describe the pain would be like getting really aroused and no release (I guess the equivelent of a guys "blue balls" TMI). Also a tightening in my abdomen. It was barable to deal with (yoga breathing helped), but when it got to the point were it was one right after another, that is when I thought I would loose my mind. The epidural was a wonderful thing. To be honest... I really did not feel much pain when they put the needle in, only when the medicine was put in at first. Once it started through my body... I didn't feel a thing.

RjdrO7DVaa	theres been a recent case, its actually been advertised on the discovery health network.  A woman was pregnant with quads and they were identical and all attached to the same placenta.  This is very risky because the placenta can't provide for all four babies.  Its just very uncommon for them all to be identical.|`|2stBV6XBaa	Yes, they are possible and have happened, but it is very rare.  There is even a famous set of identical quints.  This was before IVF, so they were natural.  I just can't remember the year.|`|nXcr5kzpaa	<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23471625/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23471625/</a>|`|iwYu32N2aa	<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/14/earlyshow/main4520555.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/1...</a><br>  <br>  there is a ton of things if you google it|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	It is possible to have identical triplets but it is very rare. The egg would have to split into three separate embryos, this is not unheard of but triplets and quads are more often made up of a pair (or two) of identical twins and/or a separate, fraternal baby.
bmoCpcdraa	don't give in or he will get worse cut his door in half, lock the bottom half up high . that will keep him in his room , i seen it on dr. phill or get child proff handles to put on his door they look like a round piece of plastic they go over doorknobs,and if he destroys his room waite a awhile then go in and pick out some of his favorite toy ,put them in a box on top of frigator don't give them back till he cleans up his room,he will need to be taught to not to act up ,or he will go to school in a few years and hit and bully the teacher and others, no im not being mean all kids go threw this he is testing you ,to see what he can get by with, i hope i helped|`|6EbDYWNEaa	I don't know if this would work for a child this young, but I remember when I was a child my mom used to make my sit on my bed when I was bad. She would leave the door open so she could hear/see me. This way I couldn't play with my toys since I was being punished for a wrong behavior. I had to sit as well, "Indian style" so there was no throwing my self around, laying half off the bed or whatever else kids do. I don't know how she managed to make me do it, but I just remember I did it.|`|J5TbYvVZaa	A good friend of mine, who is also a behavior analyst, turned me on to the Extinction method of behavior modification.

It seems to me that the worst part with my daughter was between 2 1/2 to 3...she was the most stubborn, biggest, and defiant at the age and I also felt like I was the most discouraged at that point.  One thing I did was to take most of her stuff out of her bedroom, which at the time seemed slightly ridiculous because what was the point of her having a bedroom if I was just going to put her toys and stuff in the basement storage room?  She ended up with mostly just soft stuff that wouldn't break and that I didn't think she could hurt in there.  I'm not a big believer in spanking but I just figured that at some point, I was the grown-up and I was darned if I was going to lose a battle of the wills with her!  I wanted her to stay in the room in time out if that was her punishment and just determined that one day was going to be spent in making her learn to stay in her room in time-out.  Ended up taking two days but things got better soon afterwards.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	What is "his way?" What do you think is the genuine need behind his loud/destructive behavior?<br>  <br>  Understanding what he needs and meeting that need in a way that also works for you, the parent, is one of the ways to bring peace.<br>  <br>  Trying to change his behaviors without understanding what he is trying to achieve will result in an ever-escalating war.<br>  <br>  Some examples of genuine needs that children his age can not communicate clearly are: autonomy (being independent, doing what he wants, not what you tell him) , attention (your attention), play and exploration (touch and experience everything, including items and situations you see as dangerous), acceptance (you accept him as he is, not in terms of pleasing or displeasing you).<br>  <br>  Also, know that when he has big feelings, the rational part of his brain is not functioning. You can not reason with him at that moment and there's nothing he can do about it. What *you* can do is accept him and be present with him when he has big feelings, keeping your connection with him alive as much as possible for you. <br>  <br>  If his big feelings trigger you, then maybe you can take a break and calm yourself down before you reenter the situation.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, you are an adult and he is a child in its early development. His brain is far from fully developed at this age and his view of the world is very different from yours. Trying to understand what he is experiencing is much better than trying to thrash him into something more comfortable (which is the offering of spanking, time outs and rewards/punishment in general)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

4YfehneDaa	Cramps can be a sign of your period or pregnancy, its hard to tell the symptoms apart sometime.  Its very unlikely that you would have any pregnancy symptoms this soon.  I often get slight period like cramps before and during ovulation.  Some people can get them after ovulated so that might be what your feeling.  Hopefully you'll get a positive, but your going to have to just wait.  I know it sux to wait, whenever we are ttc that 2 weeks after my period is the longest ever!! and i find my self overanalyzing every symptom. Good Luck!|`|p4edQD9Vaa	I cramped like i was gonna get my period about a week after i ovulated and i was pregnant so you could be. I'd wait a week and take a test if you haven't gotten your period.|`|AA11724307	it could be either.  I just got 4 positive tests on tuesday and I had wicked cramps leading up to them like my period would start any day.  It never came.  Even now I'm still having mild cramping and some lower back pain which my doctor said is perfectly normal.  so keep your fingers crossed.  good luck
ECTPfxJNaa	i started having fainting spells and dizziness from 6 to 11 weeks. i get dizzy every once in a while now. i had cramping since day one of my pregnancy and now i am on bed rest for other symptoms. whenever i got dizzy i would just have to stop what ever i was doing and go lay down in bed or else i would blackout (even in the shower). my doctor said it was normal but you know how doctors think everything is normal :) just be careful and let your doctor know whats been going on|`|W1p6LetFaa	Very normal, don't worry!  The cramps are just your uterus growing, exactly as it should be!  You are probably light-headed because more of your blood is flowing to your baby.  Be sure to stay hydrated and eat a healthy snack every one to two hours and you should start feeling less light-headed.  Congrats, and best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	the dizziness could be because of the hormones or low blood sugar.  Try drinking orange juice or another fruit juice.  if that doesnt help, then lay with your legs elevated. <br>  <br>  cramping is common.  its usually just your body adjusting to the pregnancy and growing to accomodate your bundle of joy.<br>  <br>  if the dizziness and cramping is too much, call the doctor.<br>  <br>  best of luck

I live In Canada.<br>  <br>  :)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I wouldn't hire two 11 year old girls to babysit together. I'd worry you two would be too busy giggling and not paying attention to my children.|`|BTuFtui3aa	Unless you were told a specific way to prepare in advance, everything you need to know will be taught at the course.<br>  <br>  Eleven is a bit young to babysit, but some people may be willing to hire you. One option would be to offer to help out the parents for free while they're around so they can see you're responsible, before you are left alone with the kids and get paid for your services. Be sure to ask before bringing your friend along, and make sure the parents are alright with it.<br>  <br>  Things like the best way to get into business and the amount to charge depends a lot on your area. These would actually be better questions to ask at the course than on the internet, because it deals with your specific location and won't be the same in other places.
W1p6LetFaa	To me it just sounds like it's your period because implantation bleeding usually occurs between 5-10 after conception, so BEFORE your period is due.  But yes, it could technically have been a miscarriage and you would never know.  Apparently about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage this way, but because they are so close to the time a woman expects her period, she never knows it was a miscarriage.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	take a pregnancy test.  if you miscarried, the hcg hormone would be present in your urine.|`|whYlVR2saa	well, i would have said you were simply late to start your period, except for the blood clot.that is a clear sign of miscarriage. early on in pregnancy it is too easy to miscarry without your body realizing it. please call your doctor to see what he/she thinks about it. i hope everything works out. i am very sorry.|`|ECTPfxJNaa	as horrible as it is, most miscarriages happen in the first weeks. go to the store and get another pregnancy test. i pray everything works out for you.|`|AA11029380	It could be either.  I understand that it's common to miscarry early and you might not even realize you had been pregnant for a short period of time.|`|7q64GhcUaa	you need to wait for another two weeks but be careful

TE7foNwMaa	I personally love Remi for a girl. It's on my list, also. Partially because I'm in love with Remy from Ratatouille...haha, but I really love the name also. <br>  <br>  I don't think she would be made fun of. Kids aren't as harsh and opinionated about names as we are...they really don't know what names are "weird" and "abnormal" or anything... I grew up thinking Metney was a rather normal name because of my friend. Plus, Remi really doesn't seem easily made fun of to me. I think it's one of the better names out there. It's great, and gets a 10 / 10 from me. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|qTWIoVEraa	Remi is the name of a popular musician for children/clown in my country. He was nominated for a Latin Grammy, though (no joke). Just make sure she never travels to Latin America, and it will be a fine name. <br>  <br>  Also, as another user suggested, Remy is the name of the rat from Rattatouile. A couple of things to keep in mind ;)|`|AY1h0mlfaa	I think Remi is the rat's name from the Disney movie Ratatouille. Other kids would know this and make fun of the child for having a rat's name.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like a Lady Remington razor.<br>  <br>  Too bad because it does sound pretty cute otherwise.|`|ea325e13e7dc9a824f29fe89faa7edafaa	I think it's a great name for a girl! I wouldn't worry about being picked on for that name- it's both cute and mature.<br>  <br>  cheers!|`|BjDJfagmaa	I think it's very cute and girly! :)|`|NnatPbU7aa	You should use Remington as the full name.|`|NzezdETKaa	no,sorry. jus,my opinion.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think it would be cute.|`|y9TVkzQYaa	I myself like names that are different. I dont think that you would get picked on at school for having that name. Its very cute!|`|NTqokGn0aa	i think it's really really cute<br>  like Remi Louanne or Remi louise.<br>  a middle name with an l.<br>  i don't think they'd get picked on. honestly kid's don't really get made fun of for their names. i'm in school now and no one even looks sidewards at this girl "Tanjinizia"|`|6EbDYWNEaa	I knew a guy with that name, he was about my dad's age (born in the mis 50's) but I think it would be a cute name for a girl. I like Rory for a girl, yes like in the Gilmore Girls. I also have a male friend with the name Rory.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Aww! That's adorable! Unique! Remielle is cute too if you wanted to make it longer and use Remi as a nickname.|`|5y9kJjDdaa	So adorable.
5IPZ7w2caa	If you had sexual intercourse with a man then yes, you could be pregnant. <br>  <br>  ..|`|W1p6LetFaa	I doubt you are pregnant, I think your body is just confused because you took two packs in a row.  It's fine to do that once in a while, but sometimes your body doesn't always get what's going on.  I tried to skip my period by continuing my birth control just like that cuz I didn't want my period on my honeymoon, but about halfway through the second pack, I got the WORST period I had ever gotten in my entire life even though I wasn't to the placebos yet.  So I don't recommend skipping the placebos to skip periods.  Try another pill like YAZ if you don't want your period every month.  But to answer your question, no, I don't think you are pregnant.  Good luck!
IM7nzdjbaa	Definitely Celexa Valtrex.  Ahaha, I think it would be ironic if you named your baby something like Trojan or Durex.|`|zGjZG1wSaa	Ok people, he's just joking. Nice! It's kind of sad though, that many people were already thinking they were real names. Sometimes I wonder how stupid people can be for naming their children outrageous names. My least favorite name: Anything that ends with '-den' (ie. Braden, Hayden, Caden, Jaden..)|`|JfrBedpJaa	Celexa Valtrex|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	I do hope you know Celexa is a anti anxiety medication lol!|`|7XIWtNr6aa	those are names of medicines|`|rY5hhcVMaa	UHM neither<br>  unless you want her to be a freaky loser|`|tHVXVlXXaa	they sound like names for cell phones!! maybe ur daughter will get free mobile to mobile.|`|EPIpgw2Gaa	i hate you|`|2OKWokOuaa	Man you are cruel. <br>  CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Go be stupid elsewhere.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I agree with the others go elswhwere to get your jollies|`|34VXCyvVaa	Seriously, Claritin is a much prettier name.|`|6EbDYWNEaa	This has to be a joking question. No one names their children after medical terms. <br>  <br>  Funny, haha.   :o(|`|JpuWdGLRaa	do you want to embarress the girl? nice names but WHOA she will totally be made fun of for that.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	neither.<br>  <br>  but the first one is slightly better.
6Knhikr1aa	My kids have been to the one at Disneyland several times. They did enjoy it! They get to stand up and dance around and sing and stuff. It's great for little ones who can't sit still ;-)|`|wZtv16syaa	I would never take my two year old. He is way to active to stay in his seat. He would try to run on stage or up and down the stairs. My niece is three weeks older though and I would take her so it depends on the child I think.|`|Zpsrad3Faa	we took my 22 month old to watch Disney on Ice and she loved it, my 11 year old not so much :). We plan to go again in Mar. to watch Mickey and Minnies Adventure
Q5BM2POnaa	Time flies, and at that age, they are changing constantly and will never be the same again.  Yes, it's OK to be sad.<br>  <br>  It's definitely sad to watch them move out of one phase and into another and know that your baby is growing up and nothing you can do will change that.<br>  <br>  It's also an amazing time to watch their growth and change and see them becoming the person they will eventually become.<br>  <br>  Take lots of pictures, cherish each moment and enjoy everything while you can.|`|mCbe2a67aa	My son hasn't reached a year yet. He's only 9 months, but even now I do feel sad about him growing up. Like you, I'm excited about the new things he does everyday and how much he's learned in the past 9 months, but I still remember when he was teeny tiny and I sometimes get weapy. I see newborn babies on tv or at the Ped's office and I always think about when my son was that age. I'm also sad because I honestly don't remember the first month or so of his life. I was so hormonal, sleep deprived, and in the throws of the baby blues that it all sort of runs together, and I wish it wasn't like that.|`|6EbDYWNEaa	I don't know how my sister felt, but when my nephew turned 4 I was sad. I miss having him be so young and innocent. He now can LIE and tattle on friends and other things that he never used to do! I miss him being a baby. I can only imagine how parents feel!  :o)<br>  <br>  But I guess you can take pride when they turn out to be outstanding people!|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	I think you miss it even more when they really start doing more for themselves. It really is sweet to see them grow up and potty trained and making their own snacks!|`|TczFL0p0aa	awh! of course it's normal to be sad! everyone is when they're baby grows up! i'm gunna be 16 in 6 months and my mother can't believe it, i think it gets her upset cuz shes getting older too :p<br>  i dont have a baby, but i babysit and everytime i see those kids even though they aren't mine i hate when they've changed since i've seen them last they either learn to do something new, they're face changed or they've talked or walked its :(.<br>  Have another one! :P best cure!|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	I know how you feel, my son turned 1 this month and yes, I am happy but I also miss my little red alien looking baby, lmao.. But most of the time I am just happy :) it's amazing watching him grow and learn, he's such a wonderful boy <3<br>  <br>  Anyways I'm braggin' now, hehe.. Have a great day and enjoy your kid, she'll grow up soooooooooooooo fast!! .. As you can see~|`|tQVBDx5Paa	I wasn't as sad when Emma turned one b/c I was already pregnant with out next little baby.  I am more sad looking at her now at 16 months.  She has changed so much since turning one.  She seems so much more "childlike."  She can express her needs, she talks, does pretty much whatever she wants.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Aw its normal to be sad, She's getting bigger and Im sure you remember like it was yesterday that she was pretty much as big as the palm of your hand.<br>  Happy Birthday to your little girl.|`|kYtZqeIaaa	Of course you should be sad. Its weird how they grow up so fast. One moment later though...she'll be six, then she'll be 16...and then she'll be 60|`|AA11210211	I was all of the above,my daughter just turned 1 a couple weeks ago and I just sat there looking at her thinking,WOW where did all the time go.I did the same with my son too.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son is 8 months but I was just thinking about this recently.  He's been sleeping through the night - awesome, right?  Then he got a cold and was cutting two teeth so he and I were up a lot.  He was so fussy, and it reminded me of when he was a newborn.<br>  <br>  I should have been miserable being up so much at night again, and obviously it's not the world's best time.  But I was also kind of happy and nostalgic.  My body and mind are so much more together now!  I could really appreciate that amazing, weird feeling of being up at 3 AM soothing a baby.
I64JOuMKaa	Yep<br>  I spent like so many hours on it<br>  and i passed by 1 one mark<br>  I was so pissed<br>  the teacher told me I didn't make enough eye contact when presenting it and I was given a chance to redo the project all over again T_T .|`|qz7c0deYaa	Yup! It happens. Even though you can work really hard on a paper sometimes teachers avoid quality and focuses more on quantity. <br>  Some reasons this happens is because you don't do what the rules for the paper are and instead go on about a different topic then what you are suppose to. There are cases where it can be just the teacher and if it doesn't exactly satisfy them then they lower the grade. This has happened to me a few times and it's quite saddening when you receive your hard-work paper back thinking you got an A++! I'm sure it happened to everyone at least once.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	yea i spend long hours on one project and got a D for it i was mad|`|ySjHowZqaa	That was the same thing that happened o me this year.  And it was also in math
ihS1d5Ftaa	Depends on the sex chromosomes.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Well, I've had a girl.<br>  Not sure whether I want another kid, I'll wait until I'm older. If I did though, I'd like a boy =).|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I dont know :O<br>  I would like a boy, then a girl another girl, that would be nice!|`|VUKDrd2taa	boy! due july 13th! = )
34VXCyvVaa	Dude, you need to put a raincoat on that bad boy!  How come none of your multitudinous spawn have your last name?|`|YgzpSbxdaa	It's because it doesn't flow properly. I got the joke, it's just not funny.|`|9g734Pjaaa	Aren't you a riot.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Still not funny.|`|qTWIoVEraa	Ha ha ha, dude you have another similar question on here...Sirius X. Offindir and Cardia Acarest? You seem like you're just bored today :P<br>  <br>  The sad thing is, I know of a girl who is really named Cardiac....>.>|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	Mistake #2|`|BOJEbnCtaa	That makes less sense than the rest. That sounds like Cardio arrest.|`|Elxuvon8aa	your names are not funny to me I wish you would find a comedy site

But because it is a one syllable name, I think it sounds better to have a longer middle name. My suggestions would be<br>  <br>  Tye Anthony<br>  Tye Alexander<br>  Tye Jackson<br>  <br>  Can't think of any others off the top of my head but hope that helped!|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	Kai for sure love that name!!!!<br>  <br>  Kai Landon<br>  Kai William<br>  Kai Braedon<br>  Kai Dominick<br>  Kai Alexander<br>  Kai Nathaniel<br>  Kai Nicholas<br>  Kai James<br>  Kai Michael<br>  Kai David<br>  Kai Parker<br>  Kai Hunter<br>  Kai Austin|`|zih1Weanaa	I like Kai better<br>  <br>  Kai Alexander<br>  <br>  <br>  Save Tye for a girl and use Thai. I have always loved that.|`|zGjZG1wSaa	Neither. It's the trend right now, and you should try somthing a little more unique, and more thought out. Sorry, but that's just how I feel.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Kai Matthew<br>  Kai tyler<br>  Kai david|`|LId3qnI1aa	Tye Jackson<br>  <br>  <br>  =]
imFpyj7Gaa	I never knew dr's gave women clomid without starting a period but anyway. First thing first, u should go to the store and get a hpt to see if ur regnant or not. If it comes back positive then I would say go to the ER to get checked out. But if it comes back negative, it's probably just a really bad period starting. I hope I helped in any way good luck.|`|afDDiHbXaa	i'm no expert but i think its just a period coz clomid makes you ovulate.then if the egg isn't fertilized it becomes a period.you may be having pains because everything is working properly again i no when i took meds to start my cycle off i had pains and heavy bleeding.but if you really are concerned give the doc a call.|`|Titeaouhaa	I think you are heavy because it's been a long time since you have had your period, but I say you see a doctor to be on the safe side.|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	Sorry sweetheart. I really think if you are cramping and having pains, you really need to go to the emergency room.
YgzpSbxdaa	I don't think that Jezel or Latoya are trashy names and I live in Australia. I know someone named Jezel except she spells her name Jazelle and she lives in Bondi, a 'well off' area in Sydney. It's never affected her with getting a job, sometimes she needs to spell her name for people. Some of the names that celebrities name their children these days, you've got to wonder what's considered a normal name.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Names make a great impression on people expecialy if they have never met them(like on applicaions) It can affect things like getting certain jobs getting into certain colleges it can even give the person an impression of who you are:<br>  <br>  case and point My philosophy teacher named his daughter charlie when she applied at a large engineering firm(All men worked there) she got an Interview, In the interview the man confessed he thought he was going to be interviewing a male.<br>  <br>  Its not just enthlicly biased its also gender. It shouldn't make a diffrence but it does.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	From personal experience people look at me crazy or confused when I tell them my real name. I'm getting it officially changed this year without a doubt. You can't make me keep this name.|`|NGFgKGeLaa	I'm not sure. I mean if your name is ridiculous, like, Broomquisha (broom-kee-shah) then yes, because kids will make fun of you. But if your name is reasonable, then no|`|zGjZG1wSaa	My friend used to live in the south for a few years and worked in a day care center. And HONEST TO GOD, he said that there was a little boy who was named, "Sexy". He had to call the kid by his last name because it was so embarrasing. Seriously, people can go be ghetto on another planet. And no, I'm not racist, I am a black person myself, and I would never even imagine to do something so detrimental to my child.|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	Wow your teacher is racist!  What a jerk.  Eh i dont like the over the top ghetto names just cause everyone makes so much fun of them but honestly if something like Shanaynay has special meaning LOL go for it.|`|uSpHh1NPaa	i love the name Latoya :)<br>  haha.<br>  <br>  um your teacher sounds kinda... rude !|`|BOJEbnCtaa	everybody has their own definition of a trashy. I think it isn't the name of a person that makes them trashy but how they act and so forth.|`|dE8RxZMwaa	yeah because there are tons of racist people out there and they obviously are going to make mean comments on their name... i don't get your story about your teacher and all that
fZGcufB7aa	That is a beautiful name! I love it. I think it flows very well, and I love Kate for a middle name. Adelyn is one of my favorite girl names. You could also try Madelyn. Which is also very cute.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|2u3ze0Asaa	I think its beautiful and unique. :)<br>  good name|`|LWwGW48Daa	Very unique and pretty|`|ot0TqzSvaa	its really good but i prefer Adalyn Rose.|`|34VXCyvVaa	It's okay, but there are already too many Maddies and Addies out there.|`|zGjZG1wSaa	No. Every girl that is going to be in this new generation is going to have a name like that. I've already heard Brynlyn, Jaylin, Ashtyn...ugh! Why are people doing this to their children, that's what I want to know.|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	It is very cute :)<br>  <br>  I like Adalyn and that spelling of Adalyn. And Kate compliments it nicely.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Adorable.|`|JfJIFCMkaa	Very cute|`|aJRP6WWYaa	I love it. It's different. Is it an old family name or did you just make it up?|`|m6EUv8zgaa	Like it =]<br>  Kate goes well with quite a few first names|`|AA10136343	Like it|`|uQEM0fIKaa	i like it :)|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I don't like Adalyn, it's made-up. <br>  Adelaide or Adeline are much nicer, with the nickname Ada especially.
W1p6LetFaa	I didn't get my first definite positive until I was 6 days late for my period.  I took a test in the afternoon 5 days after it was due and the plus was so faint that I threw the test away thinking it was a negative.  Not until I tested first thing in the morning on the 6th day did I get a clear positive.  First morning urine is always better than in the afternoon, so take a test again as soon as you wake up tomorrow.  You still might be pregnant.  I sure was!  Best wishes to you!
op3KYhpPaa	Getting your friend 16 things for your friend will be expensive, no matter what you buy. I suggest that you give her a gift card from her favorite thing, that way she can get something that she really likes.|`|JV0i77uiaa	I think you can give her a pair of earring or a little bracelet with her name on.|`|TKrPbbrzaa	well maybe get her a charm bracelet, since you know the whole sweet sixteen. that's what my cousin got and she loves it, we got her a charm to add on it every year until shes was like 21.|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	a set of encyclopedias and a websters dictionary...and a book on how to pass the SAT test so this person can enter college ...now thats a great present|`|AXh7WLSJaa	Perfume maybe?<br>  <br>  From Victoria Secrets.<br>  It's not to expensive there.|`|vNprxduNaa	fishes =]|`|45lUwgAmaa	get her a necklace, balloons or flower
5y9kJjDdaa	Its good. But i never heard of it, and its kind of abnormal for me. But sounds good. Jr. Cardea? lol cute|`|Sky9MrdCaa	it's okay. before i read the comment, like when i just saw the question, i pronounced it to myself as car-dee-uh. so maybe people will pronounce it wrong?? then again, if he is a junior, you could always call him june, junior, carr, or dee as a nickname...<br>  if you really dont like the name, try googling baby names and see if there is another boy name your bf likes..<br>  hope i helped :)|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Ive never heard it before, its very unusual but very nice.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	I initally pronounced it Car- Dea (DEA as in Madea). and thought that maybe it was a name for a female. I think that it's okay.
sFGgPTk3aa	I think it is when they turn 1.  That's when we started with my 4 yr old and I also have a 9 month old and am planning to start at 1.|`|TJezsCkHaa	I started giving regular milk at 8 months,even though their pediatrician always asked me to stay on baby formula for 12 months.|`|X0B8P8Yiaa	well the DR. will tell you about 1 but a have a baby sis  10 months old and has been drinking milk for about 2 months now my mom says i drank milk at 5 months old and im still alive so i gess its ok <br>  <br>  p.s dont give the baby fat free milk (just because there is no fat not a big deal if you do)|`|wZtv16syaa	It is recommended that babies drink formula or breast milk until twelve months old.
ACyrJQHOaa	hi,the pain you are having could be your body is stretching or could be that your baby is laying on a nerve which is hurting your hip area.I was told when i had this pain and also on my lower back, to try danca rub.Its not harmful to your baby and its the only thing that gets rid of the pain and makes it easier to walk.Its a warm sensation on your body, so try not to use it when you don't have too.Good luck and congrats on your bubs<br>  <br>  p.s. you can get danca rub or deep heat from any supermarket or chemist.Its 100% safe to use and takes away ALL pain! best stuff i ever had.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	pinched nerve maybe?|`|dCVVP3hmaa	Could be baby sitting on a nerve.  I have the same problem, but in my left leg on the outside of my thigh.  The pain is so excruciating (burning, ripping, pins and needles) that I am having a nerve block on Monday to stop the pain.  If it isn't a nerve, it may be sciatica (coming from your back).  Massaging with sorbolene cream and heat packs and cold packs (whichever you prefer) often help. The good news is, once baby is born, the pain should instantly go away!  Good luck.|`|mItsW20naa	Often caused by pressure to the sciatic nerve, had that with both my kids...
ACyrJQHOaa	Pinworms are small white intestinal invaders and it is believed that may specifically target humans. Pinworm eggs move along the small intestine where they hatch and mature. Adult pinworms travel to the colon where they can live for several months.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of pinworm infestation include anal itchiness, insomnia, and poor appetite. Because the eggs are laid around the anus and it's itchy, the re-infestation in children can recur repeatedly when the child scratches and then transfers them to their mouths on unclean hands.<br>  <br>  Pinworms can live for as long as two weeks outside the body. And if someone touches a contaminated surface and puts unclean hands in the mouth, it's very likely they may become infected.<br>  <br>  To limit the chances of getting pinworms or of spreading them to others: <br>  <br>  Wash your hands carefully and often. <br>  Avoid scratching around your anus. <br>  Keep your fingernails short. <br>  Wash clothes and bedding regularly. <br>  Bathe and change your underwear every day.<br>  <br>  If family members get pinworms again, all family members will need to take medicine to kill pinworms. <br>  <br>  <br>  it is safe to use in pregnancy. Others suggest ingestion of pumpkins seeds and garlic for a period of ten days to two weeks. It is important for all family members to be treated and this includes bathing every morning to wash away ova that have been deposited outside the anus. Snug fitting underwear and regular handwashing as well as washing of bedsheets will also reduce reinfestation."<br>  <br>  They also advise not sharing baths or towels and warn about toilet seats.<br>  <br>  Also the medication can be very dangerous to your unborn child and can pass on alot of defects.<br>  <br>  p.s.I have heard that if you put Vaseline outside your anus during the night, when the pinworms come out to lay eggs, the eggs will die because of the Vaseline....|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Yikes! Its sounds like it would be harmfull to anyone. These come out of the anus at night and lay eggs i wouldnt sleep in the same bed as him or even lay in the bed he did intell he gets rid of them and the bed is cleaned very well. But i am sure there has to be something U can take to get rid of them if U were to have them. Also even if U know U dont have them i would get checked often just in case. Does Ur hubby have meds to get rid of these?|`|d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	Your going to have to go see your ob. They will have meds there that they can give you since your pregnant. I would definitely not have sex with your hubby until they are gone..
SxPhldhhaa	I picture Tessandra to be very sweet and pretty. I imagine her to be someone who is sensitive and kind to those who are kind to her, and speaks only when she has something of value to say. She doesn't seek attention or attempt to look pretty, yet she captures the attention of many boys anyway.<br>  <br>  I see Leandra to be a very elegant and motherly person. She is generally friendly and welcoming, but also fusses over trivial things and is protective of her daughter. She's pretty and holds herself up confidently.<br>  <br>  Kai seems to be a very handsome and sweet boy. He isn't one to upset others or try to cause havoc, and tries to woo Tessandra in subtle but sweet ways. I think of him as having dark hair and being thin and average height.<br>  <br>  Leeta seems like a very energetic character to me. Her intentions are always good, but she's a bit clumsy and her plans sometimes backfire. She's talkative and sometimes may appear to be annoying to the other characters. In general, she is good-natured, but not always appreciated.<br>  <br>  Nikkai and Nukkai seem to be mischievous and very clever. They never try to harm anyone greatly, but they do seem to cause havoc and are exceptionally good at it. They appear to be a little bored and sarcastic when conversing with others.<br>  <br>  Aqtei would seem to me like a very gallant and proud king. He is strong and handsome in a very royal fashion, although can be a little arrogant at times. He has a booming voice and the other characters may sometimes feel a little uncomfortable around him.<br>  <br>  Lysistra sounds like she might be a very sinister and secretive person. I'd see her as someone who is constantly on the move, and operates alone, having her followers but dismissing them all carelessly. Her voice is cold and she seeks dominance over all of the others. She is very beautiful yet heartless.<br>  <br>  It sounds like an interesting story you're working on here! I do think that a lot of the names you've chosen sound fitting for their roles, especially Lysistra - it just sounds very cold and evil. Some other name ideas I have in mind are Avlea (you can pronounce this as either Av-lee-a or Av-lay-a), Azyra, Delika, Islana, Adelyna, Japhessa, Viana, and Jariena for females and Zeadom, Hobane, Ailux, Jyron, Fescan, and Garron for males. I don't have any ideas for a plot, but best of luck!|`|sCBR7Acyaa	tes. shy<br>  Lea. sick/old<br>  kai. young<br>  lee. tiny<br>  niks. haha idk yingyangs?<br>  aat. powerful<br>  lys.

It looks really awkward.  <br>  Lysistra is nice enough, though on first glance I thought it was Lysistrata misspelled.|`|dE8RxZMwaa	tessandra-uh like really snobby<br>  leandra- rich and fancy<br>  kai- a gay guy<br>  leeta- pretty<br>  twins- like twins that never leave eachother's side<br>  aqtei- i can't pronounce these what are they indian<br>  lysistra- evil
Yx5GlOJDaa	Sometimes your water will break and that's how you know your gonna go into labor and when your water breaks on its own usually they have you go in but labor pains are menstrual like cramping and it feels like your having your cycle, or really sharp pains in your lower abdomen or lower back and you feel lots of pressure in your vaginal area that's another sign too!!! At least that's how it was with me, not every woman is the same.|`|wZtv16syaa	I was induced with my first baby and had an epidural. With my second baby the only time that I wanted the drug it was too late! It was a completely different experience. You do have the pushing sensations both ways, and I was so much more aware of everything with second baby if you feel like you can do it without the drugs I recommend it highly. Good luck.|`|AA11427561	contractions is your stomach fell tight and you have a lot of pressure
TE7foNwMaa	Francesca Cassini -- I love Francesca! Cassini is also a great last name, but it sounds a bit odd with Francesca. Plus, I'm not totally sure how to pronounce it... But (if I'm pronouncing it right), the ending of Francesca kind of clashes with it... the "francesCA CAssini" sounds are rather odd... But I do love Francesca. <br>  <br>  Monroe Alpert -- Is Monroe a boy or a girl? I know it's a last name...but I'm not totally sure of the gender here. I think Alpert's great! It's amazing, and I think it's a keeper. <br>  <br>  Ian Abbey -- Well, I'm not a fan of Abbey either... since it's a bit too much of a first nickname, it just doesn't seem like a last name.. Ian is great though.<br>  <br>  Liam Abbey -- Again, same opinion about Abbey. Liam's a great first name too, but it is pretty similar to Ian... I still like it.<br>  <br>  Casey Willow -- Is Casey a boy or a girl? Yeah, I'm not much of a fan of Willow... It's not bad, but it does give the name a very tree-like flair. I like Casey for a boy or a girl, they both work. <br>  <br>  As for last names (these are most likely last names of characters in my own stories or last names of people that I know)...<br>  Dunn <br>  Hundson<br>  Leningrad<br>  Stayman (heh, my neighbors)<br>  Bret / Brett<br>  Huffaker (HUFF-ay-ker)<br>  Andreason (anne-DRAY-son)<br>  Jardine (jar-DEEN)<br>  Strom<br>  Carlow (CAR-lo)<br>  Boothby (the last name of a Casey that I know)<br>  Nix (the last name of another Casey I know)<br>  <br>  <br>  You're welcome to try out any of them that you want...

dCLnLlsCaa	Why is this in the pregnancy section?  It should be in religion.  Sorry about that though, just stare them down back!|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	I personally feel very offended when I see a woman who is draped from head to toe in swathes of cloth. From what I understand, some Muslim women aren't allowed to show themselves in case it inflames the passion of men. Which insults not only our men, but also all the suffragettes who fought so hard to give women the right to walk unmolested down the street, to own their own property, to not be regarded as the "property" of their husband and to vote in democratic elections. I don't give Muslim women hateful stares though, I'm not a racist, just an educated, tolerant woman, who lives in a civilised, multi-ethnic society.|`|VmpkLLKJaa	I wouldn't make a generalization like that, but some people just don't like or fear what they don't understand. <br>  I think Muslim women are beautiful. They represent an outward commitment to something higher to me. I'm not Muslim, but I can appreciate it anyway. Don't internalize it. They don't know you and that's the problem, not who or what you are : )|`|AA10312653	if I saw you i wouldnt give you a hateful look...and perhaps they arent Christian.....Christians arent suppose to be hateful(although i admit that alot of people that claim to be Christians arnt saved at all..)...I'm sorry for any true Christians that have given you a hatful look...also this probally is in the wrong section considering this is pregant section|`|E0SJx3Csaa	because of 9-1-1 . think about it, if it were the asians who attacked us and murdered thousands of people and children , wouldn't you look at them like they look at you ?<br>  <br>  im not saying that's its right to do, but if you know anything about social psychology then you will understand that acting this way (being prejudice) is part of our human traits. we are not perfect, and those of us who are educated enough and make a good effort not to be like that still feel that way deep down inside.<br>  <br>  its part of nature, just moe on with your life and don't let it bother you, there is not much you can do to stop it, other than going against your beliefs and removing the cover up on your head.|`|b457ca42a84d649f207ac8de710d5a89aa	I am a white Christian woman who is very interested and curious about Muslim culture.

C0K3Bo2Aaa	My doctor suggested that I walk, walk walk, so I did, I did, I did.<br>  Don't know if it helped but it didn't hurt:)|`|ACyrJQHOaa	Natural Ways to Induce Labor<br>  <br>  First and Most Important—Relax!<br>  <br>  Labor will not begin if you’re tense, worried or trying hard to start labor. Try a warm (not hot) bath in candlelight. Get a professional massage with the only goal being relaxation. Acupuncture and acupressure, because of the focus on key areas of the body, have also helped inspire labor. In addition, some women rely on aromatherapy, specifically the soothing scent of clary sage, to relax. <br>  <br>  Try to do something special for yourself every day—especially if you’re past your due date. Get a manicure, try dinner out at a new restaurant, see a favorite movie or go out for ice cream with your partner. <br>  <br>  You could also try visualization or meditation. <br>  <br>  Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths-in through your nose and out through your mouth. <br>  Get in touch with your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your face. <br>  Imagine a flower opening slowly as you breathe in and out. <br>  Imagine what your baby looks like and imagine her being born, gently and peacefully. <br>  Not only is this technique relaxing, but it uses the mind/body connection. A visual of being open and the baby being born might be the natural way to induce labor that you need. <br>  <br>  What Gets the Baby In, Gets the Baby Out<br>  <br>  Sex is the most well-known trick to begin labor. Semen has natural prostaglandins—-a hormone involved in the start of labor. If you use this technique, don’t get up right away and elevate your hips to help the semen stay on the cervix. This will help to thin and dilate it. <br>  <br>  However, in late pregnancy, many women are not in the mood for intercourse. Simple loving activities that are part of your normal foreplay can help, too. Female orgasm has been known to open the cervix up to two centimeters. You can also ask your partner to gently stimulate your nipples, or heat up a towel in the dryer for a minute or two and place it over your breasts. This prompts the release of oxytocin. Do not do this constantly, however. For some women, contractions started within 20 minutes of doing this. If a half hour or so goes by, stop and maybe try it again another day. <br>  <br>  ”Bump” or “Swing” Your Way into Labor<br>  <br>  There are also tricks that involve “bumping” or “swinging” the baby into the pelvis or into a better positing for birthing. These include finding a park with a swing and swinging on it. You can also try driving down a bumpy road. Make a date out of it with your partner or a friend. Take a picnic lunch and do some light hiking. <br>  <br>  Walk the Baby Out<br>  <br>  Taking a gentle walk or slowly pedaling a stationary bike might start contractions. Being upright puts pressure on the cervix, which may prompt it to dilate. Make sure to drink lots of fluids, maintain your body temperature below 100.5 degrees and listen to your body. If your body is tired or telling you stop—listen to it! <br>  <br>  Talk to Your Baby<br>  <br>  Recent studies have found that the baby begins the complex hormone cycle of labor. As silly as it might feel, talk to your baby and make sure she feels welcome. Tell her about her room, about her grandparents, about your hopes and dreams for her. If nothing else, it creates some wonderful memories and gives you a chance to bond with your baby while you are trying out natural ways to induce labor<br>  <br>  Herbs and Oils<br>  <br>  Castor oil, evening primrose oil, or blue and black cohosh can be used to begin labor, but proceed with caution. These supplements have side effects and possible complications. <br>  <br>  There are concerns about castor oil, which is primarily a strong laxative. While bowel spasms may cause contractions, they may also do nothing more than, well, stimulate the bowel of both you and baby. <br>  The most common application of evening primrose oil is directly on the cervix, not on the belly. Like other lotions and oils, there’s no telling what reaction your body will have externally, much less internally. Since pregnancy can cause adverse reactions to the most common things, this may not be the best choice. <br>  There are few medical studies to support the safe and guided use of blue and black cohash, and finding an herbal professional experienced in the application is rare. <br>  If you’d like to integrate alternative therapy into your health care, it's advisable to check with your health care provider and an herbal professional before using these or any supplements to discuss pros and cons and determine the correct dosages. <br>  <br>  Ask for Your Doctor’s Help<br>  <br>  Doctors can induce labor as well, even without using pitocin, which is a synthetic oxytocin. A slightly painful but effective way is to ask the doctor to “scratch” your membranes by going into the cervix. The doctor can also insert prostaglandin-based gel packs into the vagina to stimulate the cervix. Labor often occurs within the next 24-48 hours.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	sex semen softens the cervix and helps you go into labor faster.<br>  <br>  dont eat mexican food, you dont want to have heartburn and labor pains at the same time!!!<br>  <br>  I'm serious sex.

qz7c0deYaa	Awe-- yeah, it doesn't seem all that good. But don't let that put you down! There are many other guys out there too! It's odd how he keeps dodging the question-- BUT-- he already has a girl friend. There's no point on being with someone who likes another girl. So it may benefit you if you got over him. He obviously can tell that too which is why he's saying he doesn't want to hurt you. He's probably trying to not tell you the truth of him already liking his girl friend and that he doesn't want to be with you. It sounds to me that he wants to just avoid hurting you by avoiding the question. I'm so sorry about this, but that's growing up! Like I said, I am sure there are many other guys out there of course! Crushes happens, and they end. He sounds like a kind guy, so I don't see why you guys can't just remain good friends then! But I do wish you the best of luck, dear!|`|5tqh0akYaa	he has a girlfriend he is off limits? What you want him to dump his girl for you? That will anger a lot of people, just get over it.

I would advise you not to talk to him, to avoid him giving you the wrong impression and you giving him the wrong impression that you are 'desperate'|`|aL0OCQG3aa	I think that you should probably back off since he has a girlfriend.

I know you like him and all, but in the long run doing the right thing and respecting their relationship will make you a better person.|`|2KqklP0Saa	Either he's really trying to not hurt your feelings or likes you but doesn't want to hurt his girlfriend's feelings.

KNxs4PrZaa	normal, she will have ups and downs through out the pregnancy, her hormones are ranging and she will feel all sorts of emotions for the next 9 months.  however if she seems to become very depressed for a long period of time and is not taking care of herself then seek proffesional attention, in some rare cases women can become deeply depressed and need medical intervention, but i wouldnt really worry about this yet i am sure she is just feeling like the rest of us did at one point or another during pregnancy.|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Worry!<br>  <br>  Pregnant and unmarried.<br>  <br>  What do her friends and relatives think?<br>  <br>  If remaining unmarried  - when the child is older  - sometime - someone - will call the child a bastard.<br>  <br>  How should she act?|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Mood swings are normal.

AA10196172	As long as sperm gets onto her wet bits, it swims in those fluids until it reaches inside the uterus to wait for the egg. There's really not much difference between a little outside and a little inside once the juices are spread all over; especially if we mean right along the opening to the vagina.<br>  <br>  Sperm doesn't die for a while. In the warm, wet uterus, it can wait 2-3 days, possibly up to 5. In open air, it would probably dry up and die in 5 to 30 minutes unless it's hot and humid. Depends how big and wet a glob it is and how much time elapsed. Sperm dies when it cools off, is heated too hot in really hot water, dries up so it dehydrates, or is exposed to the wrong pH (base like soap or acid like lemon juice or vinegar)<br>  <br>  Once he reaches orgasm, some serious cleanup with soapy hot water is recommended before any more horseplay. Or, have a wet cloth with some slight acidity like lemon juice or vinegar.  The sperm doesn't care if you didn't have any fun, as long as it can swim to where it's going.

Sperm can survive in the genital area, if they get close to your vagina, they can swim their way up, and if you are not on birth control pills (or another type of protection) then there is a slight possibility. Use condoms or other birth control next time, or try Plan B.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Girl if you don't know the answer to this, you don't need to be doing anything you mentioned above because you are obviously very young.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	no .. the sperm can't survive outside of the body like that.|`|W6w6J9zPaa	actually the chances are really small but still theres a percent it may make a girl pregnant.<br>  U know, sometimes even cuming "inside" wont help it! but sometimes a situation like u said would do it!<br>  the safe way is to talk to a doc before it gets late!!<br>  taking meds on ur own is not recommended!!<br>  next time make it safer!! dont mess around!!<br>  cheers|`|71dd9f0355fb0b1dcef766dec7939c0caa	unlikely

bmoCpcdraa	do you watch stuff on t.v. that he shouln't be seeing? if not does he take naps for long periods durring day? if so shorting them, you could also try reading him a happy book with ,happy pic. before he goes to bed, does he have a fish tank in his room or something that makes noises? i hope i helped ofcourse he is having bad dreams but you need to find out why , do you have a pet he is affraide of ? like a big dog,|`|Kpn4xceEaa	it sounds like night terrors - they are different from nightmares - often their eyes are open and they may even be up and walking around some<br>  My son may have had them at one point, so I did a lot of research. There is so much info I would suggest looking it up - it looks scary but they don't remember having them, and the more you try to soothe them the worse they get - just hold him but don't talk. With a nightmare your mind is active while your body is at rest. With night terrors it's the opposite. My son had them for a few (terrible) months and then they just stopped. Good luck!|`|j0xfBk5Caa	Welcome to the world of toddler night terrors. They are common enough but terribly frightening for us parents. Read up on them. Don't try to wake him up, just keep him out of harms way and gently guide him back to sleep when it is over. You will know when it's done when he falls back to sleep naturally or starts to recognize you again. They suck but aren't anything to really worry about.|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	its sounds like night terrors. here is a web sit. <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/sleep/terrors.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/sle...</a> maybe this will help. good luck if u need more info u can google night terrors and get more info about it good luck<br>  <br>  night terrors that is what they do when you try to wake them or they wake up on there own crying and screaming and they don't recognising anyone|`|X0B8P8Yiaa	well he could have a reacoring nightmares of something and when he is awake he could be confused
cDVAEHgCaa	I got a beautiful card with a photo of my daughter (taken minutes after birth) and her footprints on it.  It was signed by the maternity staff, and I thought it was so cute!  <br>  <br>  (It also had her full name, date and time of birth, weight, head circumference.  I will treasure it always!)<br>  <br>  But no, I didn't get any sort of birth certificate with a foot print on it.|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	My hospital did.  I was at a smaller hospital, so that could have something to do with it.... You can try, but now that your son is 15 months old it might be kind of late.  You can always do it yourself though, or make a fun handprint in the clay|`|jYPeis3Saa	i got one!!!! <br>  they gave it to me the day we were released. <br>  <br>  <br>  if you didnt get one, maybe they didnt do it, so yes it would be too late now at 15 months|`|rj3Zp9okaa	No I didnt get one like that but I got something seperate a certificate with his footprints on it.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Nope...I didn't get one like that. But, They did put my Daughters foot prints on a Hospital Uniform (My husband had to wear it when I had my C-Section) So, I thought that was pretty neat!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Nope.|`|4ztXoIDKaa	they take there foot prints but don't put them on the birth certificate|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	yes, they do but i believe there's an extra charge for that..|`|AA11210211	I didn't get one with either of my children.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	mine didnt i was disappointed<br>  its never too late! his feet still have lots of growing to do, esp being hes male and will likely have huge feet lol. im planning on getting some non-toxic watercolor paint at a crafts store in the kids section and then dipping my daughter's feet on them like that.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Some do some don't...  The hospital in my community still gives them as of January 21,2009 when my neighbor gave birth...

I like it, it is very unique.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Luna|`|fSKQSXBvaa	name her kelsie elizabeth i love that name|`|ot0TqzSvaa	i dont like either name, but if i had to choose, i'd go with Elizabeth.<br>  <br>  WHAT ABOUT Lisabeth or Lena<br>  <br>  Lisabeth is less common than Elizabeth, and bit more modern.<br>  <br>  Lena means 'The bright one' in 2007, Lena was ranked 857th in the common/popular name chart.<br>  <br>  *Lena is my FAVE<br>  hope i helped :)|`|miFe45quaa	I absolutely love the name Elizabeth.<br>  I plan on using it in honor of my close friend's mom (her middle name is Beth). <br>  <br>  I've never been a fan of Luna. However, I like the name Lena (lee-nah).|`|98cJg2pCaa	Elizabeth<br>  <br>  Luna means moon and if she gets chubby she could get picked on and called "moony" because she blocks out the sun, for example.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Luna. It's fun.<br>  Elizabeth seems stuffy.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Elizabeth but spelled Elisabeth.|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	I like Elizabeth more because Luna reminds me of the moon and I just really don't like it for a baby name.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	elizabeth.|`|UriE3wN6aa	elizabeth|`|SxPhldhhaa	I'd have to say that Luna does. I'll admit that I'm rather biased, as it's a nickname I've used for a while now. My friends began calling me Luna when we were in the 7th grade, and now everyone calls me that anyway. I like it because it's unique, pretty, and simple.<br>  <br>  I love the name Elizabeth as well, because it's a beautiful, timeless, classic with many cute nicknames (such as Liz, Lizzie, Beth, Ella, Ellie, Eliza, and so on). The only thing that's getting to me a little is the popularity of the name. I know 13 people named Elizabeth, so the name Luna just seems to stand out to me more. I do have to say that I love Luna Elizabeth as a combination, though!|`|lWcejimgaa	Elizabeth appeals to me more.<br>  You can call her Ellie Lizzie Liza Beth Bethie Bonnie<br>  or any other variation of the name.<br>  My daughter has the name.<br>  I think it is elegant and tasteful and classic.<br>  You could always call her Elizabeth Luna<br>  or Luna Elizabeth<br>  They are both nice.<br>  Good Luck!|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I prefer Elizabeth for a middle name, but Luna for a first name.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I really love Luna so much. I also love the moon. Hmmm.... Luna Elizabeth?|`|4URp7Ew6aa	I actually think that you could use Luna as the first name and Elizabeth as the middle name. They sound really good together! And Luna is way more original!|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	Elizabeth|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Elizabeth|`|zGjZG1wSaa	Elizabeth. Any time i've heard the name Luna it's been the name of a dog.

6b2c780c41a3648dc5ae321eec588c0caa	Well on the rare occasion that this has happened we just cover up and see what they need.  I mean it's not like you were doing anything wrong!  Married people have lots and lots of sex and it's okay!  When questioned about it later I just replied that we were doing Mommy and Daddy hugging stuff.  He was four and I really didn't want him going to daycare the next day and saying I saw Mommy and Daddy having sex!  That way he went to daycare and said "I saw Mommy and Daddy hugging last night."  <br>  <br>  We now have four children and are physically incapable of having sex with the door unlocked!|`|50ff413578e759e56bcbe1f228ea315baa	i would be in a lot of shock.. but that would never happen to me cause i would lock my door|`|AA11205539	Oh man,I have so thought about that during having sex.LOL!I don't even know what I would say.|`|AA11839085	If etall it happens donot loose your cool wrap your self and your spouse with bed sheet. If sheet is not there & both of you are naked and you are in the process of doing the strokes of just inserted or on climax GOD only can help!|`|AA12358900	This has happened to us on more than one occasion as we have more than one child and none of them has the common courtesy to knock. It's pretty much the same thing every time. Snatch up the blanket if you're not already covered, act as if nothing was going on, deal with the reason they came in, rush to lock the door again (my doorknob only needs a little jiggle to unlock it, the piece of crap) and hope they didn't see too much. If they ask about it later, I usually say we were giving massages, depending on what they walked in on. Luckily they haven't walked in on any oral yet (that would be a hell of a massage lol), and they're not old enough to know what we're really doing. We will definitely get that doorknob fixed before that lol. And yes, most times we have finished :)
VKQzj4Pmaa	As long as your baby is still young enough to not turn, roll over, or sit up, I see no reason why not. Just be sure your baby is always strapped in and never on an elevated surface. <br>  <br>  I would stop once your baby is able to not roll over, but before that when he's able to simply turn his body to the side. However, I will say that it is recommend that you never leave your baby in a bouncer unattended.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Are you there the whole time?  When my son was that age, he was pretty much constantly asleep.  So it basically wasn't possible to put him anywhere without him napping there.  Bouncer, swing, bassinet, boppy pillow, car seat, stroller.  I never left him alone, but I never left him alone during that period anyway.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no it's fine i used to do that with my baby when she was that small esp if she was congested bc it promotes drainage as opposed to lying flat, dr.s actually recommend that when your baby has a cold.<br>  edit: to the silly person above me, most bouncy seats have head and neck support with their little pillows, bouncer seats were MADE for newborns/young infants, so the manufacturers specifically DESIGNED it for babies w/weak neck muscles. maybe YOU should go do some research.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I thinks your son will be fine in a bouncer, just make sure he is buckled in good. I let my Newborn (back when she was a NB) nap in hers, she loved it, it was the only way to calm her down sometimes, she was kind of colicky. I say let them nap where they fall asleep, bouncer, car seat, swings, crib or even mama's or dada's arms. My 6 month old doesn't use her bouncer chair that much anymore, but she is napping in her swing right now. What every you put them down in, just make sure the are buckled in and they should be fine.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	My cousin always did it with hers...Like if she had to be in the back or something he always stayed in there.He pretty much was in that chair all the time for about 5 months,except when he was out on the floor,and at night.He's 2 now and perfectly fine.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter would nap in her papasan chair occasionally when she was a newborn. Most of the time she was in my arms though, or she'd go to her crib once in a while.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes, if he is laying back some and won't fall forward and make sure his head is supported.|`|TWCskV2aaa	I always let my daughter nap where ever she would fall asleep, well as long as she was safe and secure that is. I think it is more than fine. I have even had to have mine sleep in hers overnight b/c she had a bad cold and couldn't breathe when she would lay flat.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I never put my Daughter in a Bouncer until she was about 3 months. I always put her in her Bassinet when she took a Nap and for bedtime.  I just felt it would be more comfortable for her, plus, I didnt want her near the cold floor.|`|wb8WwWMNaa	A nap is fine, the baby prolly won't sleep long, seeing as it's a bouncer.. but I wouldn't make it habit.  Then your baby may ONLY fall asleep in the bouncer which isn't good.  Be sure to keep he/she in the crib. :D|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I did with my twins but I made sure that I was in the room with them.  I always made sure they were strapped in even though they could not roll over at that stage.  Once they started to roll it was back in the cot for their naps.|`|4ztXoIDKaa	I think it's just fine, my daughter is 12 wks and she's been doing since she was a new born.  She also sleeps in a car seat at night.  ONly way she'll sleep.  She HATES to lay flat!|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	If the bouncer supports the head well... Put it on an incline so there won't be any neck problems later.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	everyone is going to have their own opinion on this one... but i think its okay.... isabel did.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	as long as their secure I don't see the big deal|`|37MvN4YJaa	I think if you swaddle her in a few large sheets and be sure that the straps are on she should be fine.  Not to sleep overnight of course but if she is napping and you are in close proximity my opinion is that its okay.|`|64ef40bfea69a52c85daf6104a54abbfaa	My niece did.
QHf2Ov6yaa	OMG yes, take a look at the religion section. pretty much nothing but trolls.|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Lol yeah I know what you mean but they just want attention..... I hate the stupid questions they post like "My gf is pregnant, should I push her down the stairs? I seen couple of these....lol<br>  They're just looking for attention!|`|eNulfbs7aa	Life is full of Trolls...you just have to step on them and keep on moving...|`|6cc543542598d9c7bc967e59c411667aaa	I know what you mean, but some times you just gotta love them damn trolls.   lol|`|VmpkLLKJaa	I don't know why but EVERY "Do you think I'm pregnant" question makes me automatically think 'Please go pee on a stick.' I know there are some valid inquiries, but really...|`|AA11513689	maybe they just need to put in a troll booth and make em pay!<br>  You know, For who the bell TROLLS<br>  they're all TROLLops anyway<br>  sigh...this is taking such a troll on my mood.....|`|SxxXBC4vaa	it def. annoys me too! us pregnant women have serious questions and they have nothing better to do than ask made up questions or try to act intelligent and answer our questions.|`|1qKvCldEaa	Stupid questions... LIKE THIS ONE?!?!|`|AA11210211	Ignore them|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Just report them.   My questions get deleted and they are serious questions, so why can't a not-so- serious question get deleted?   It is annoying but you have to brush it off and move on.
BWVDKixeaa	Hey better late than never!  You say you have spoiled them and they are brats.  So basically you have inadvertently taught them that they deserve everything for nothing. To be honest it's going to get worse before it gets better and you need to be prepared for that.  You will need to be calm, clear and consistant. This is long I know but this is what I would do..<br>  <br>  I would actually start by having a private talk to the 10 year old on their own first.  All at once will be too difficult at this stage I think. Explain that you love him/her but that sometimes things have been hard for you as a parent.  I would acknowledge that things must be hard for them too with dad being away so much.  Explain that you want to make things better but that you will need their help.  Be frank and say that you worry that maybe you haven't been the best mother to them.  Again say you love them all very much but that you believe that things should be better in the house but they aren't because you haven't been doing your job properly. You want to talk to them first before the others because he/she is older and understands better.<br>  <br>  Explain that things are going to change in the house.  That they might not like some of the changes but it will be for the better.  Have a frank and open discussion about the problems you see (discussion and not just you telling them).  Listen but stay firm.  Say that as the eldest you would like them to help be a part of this change but it will happen whether they like it or not (if they have a grumble).  <br>  <br>  If it is working so far then maybe sit with them and make up some simple rules for the house and write them down together HOWEVER you are the parent and you have the ultimate say in what rules are fair for everyone.  Have some fun colourful markers, stickers as pointer marks and a large paper ready.  <br>  <br>  Maybe come up with some ideas together to help make sure the rules are followed (eg. a rewards chart, stickers for the younger ones etc) Then talk about what might be a consequence if the rules aren't followed for him/her. Since he/she is older the consequences will be different.  Eg I will miss out on watching The Simpsons, the TV goes off, playstation taken away for the day, they don't go to their friends house etc.<br>   <br>  If they walk out on you or get very upset, then again explain CALMY that this is going to happen with or without their help.  Then walk away. If they are difient then you explain that they won't choose and that you will choose.  NEVER GET INTO A VERBAL SLANGING MATCH WITH YOUR CHILD EVER! EVER! EVER! You are the parent. They can work with you or not.  You say it once and if they don't like it you move on or you move away. <br>  <br>  With the youngest there say that you love them all very much and that starting from now mum is going to start doing her job properly.  That sometimes they won't like what mum says or does but that it will happen if they like it or not. In between talking see if you notice that they are listening or trying hard and PRAISE THEM for it. Tell them that you can already see that they are trying. If not keep talking calmy and ignore them.<br>  <br>  If it's worked well so far then maybe you could have the 10 year old explain to the youngest children what's going to happen and show them the cool new rules (you might even want to come up with a great name for them together).  They probably won't listen but persist. You might have some stickers ready if they are being good listeners and maybe your eldest could give them out if the youngest are listening.  They might even want to add another rule. <br>  <br>  You are going to talk to them nicely and you expect them to talk nicely to you. Be clear on what the consequences are for the eldest and then for them.  Show them where they will sit for time out and how long for (maybe get a large sandtimer that they can see from where they are but is far away enough so they don't touch).  If they are silly in time out then you start it again.  If they don't go to time out then you explain that until they go to time out the TV will stay off and there will be no playing.  If need be favorite toys are removed and placed in a bag to be put away for a day. If a toy goes in it doesn't come out for a day. It will be return only the next day.  If need be put all the toys in there!  Don't give in and don't EVER take any out until the next day even if they do go to time out.  You said the toys will go and you need to mean it! DON'T GO BACK ON YOUR WORD! Explain this to them there and then and even the part about you not going back on your word.<br>  <br>  I would then thank them if they are listening. Tell them that the happy house starts now. Try to make it positive in your voice and in how you describe things.  Everything is for the better.  Maybe go outside and play a game together or something to finish on a high note.<br>  <br>  Remember to be Positive, Calm, Clear on expectations and more than anything be Consistant.  They can yell and scream and kick and punch and whatever but you will ignore that. You will do what you told them you would do because you love them.<br>  <br>  You may not use all of this but maybe some of this might help.  Good luck!|`|wZtv16syaa	You can always have another shot with your kids at that age. But you have to follow through with what you tell them. Example: You say I will take away your playstation if you don't stop..they don't stop...take it away! I think that removing privileges is a good way to get your children to behave. Good luck!|`|9ydJQr5zaa	You are right it is your fault. You should have probably thought of this before you did this. The father situation doesn't have anything to do with them acting like brats. You can always try spanking. Spanking may sound like an awful thing to do to a child to some, but it's truly not. Spanking can teach a child right from wrong of course if the parent explains. Some people take it as if spanking is abuse. Can it turn into abuse? Yes, spanking can turn into abuse if you pass the limit. It's not just getting the child over your laps and spanking them until you feel it's necessary. It's also an age thing. Which is one of the reasons of why it can turn into abuse and why it's mistaken to be abuse. Parents do not focus on the child's age and just begin to spank leaving bruises. Which is not necessary to teach a lesson. The only way to give an appropriate spanking is by taking the child to a private place, where it's only you him/her. Sitting him/her down and asking why he/she did what he/she did (if you do not already know) explaining how wrong it is. What you would like for him/her to do next. Then explain what you are about to do and do it. You have a 4 year old which sounds hard to control, but it's not. Of course you are not going to spank the child for a long time. But you can always try at least 5 smacks and explaining clearly in a matter that he/she can understand. The 5 year old is not so different from the 4 year old I suppose you can do the same. The 10 year old is old enough to understand what to do and what not to do. He/she doesn't deserve 5 smacks. He/she is ready for over laps, of course no implement. One thing you need to remember if you do take this advice and use spanking is to do it privately. If not there are consequences, the consequence is hatred. The child will hate you eventually for doing it in public and humiliating him/her.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	you need to sit them down and let them know what is expected of them and give them chores, yes even the 4 and 5 yr old and have a chart. Let them know if they misbehave you will take something away they really want, like xbox or whatever is they like and STICK TO what you say<br>  <br>  <br>  main thing is where parents fail IS NOT sticking to what they say.<br>  <br>  My kids know better, if I tell them if you do this or that we are leaving, and they act up we will leave. Now time to time they test me and I prove to them I am still in control.<br>  <br>  Just remember to keep your cool and calm and just do what YOU say you are going to do|`|1s3nddaYaa	start grounding and spanking|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Of course you can fix their behavior,better now than when they are teenagers ( you aint seen nothin' yet !!). Just calmly lay the law down, make them help around the house etc. as well, and when they don't do what they are supposed to do there are consequences - loss of privileges of whatever you decide, from TV to game etc. You have to follow through. That is the main thing. Constant threats with no backup mean nothing.|`|R6ZtmTtxaa	You have to lay down the law! If you keep doing what they say, they will grow up to be even worse. Ground them. Take away their favorite items. Chores (lots of them!). Keep being strict for a while until they start to mend their ways.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	If you care about your kids I would recommend you avoid punishment and rewards type of parenting and look for ways to be engaged in a connected, respectful relationship with them. Note that this does not imply permissiveness, just respect and lack of humiliation.<br>  <br>  Please read this before you decide how to approach your decision:<br>  <a href="http://www.neverhitachild.org/miller1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neverhitachild.org/miller1.ht...</a><br>  <br>  I also recommend Alfie Kohn's Unconditional Parenting ( amazon link:   <a href="http://is.gd/kj5b" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/kj5b</a> )|`|pnL5WTXMaa	you re right, the dad abandoning you and not visiting consistently does play a big part in their behavior. straighten that out first. you re the one in charge now. and he has to respect that consistency is the least he can do now. also, time outs work wonders - so does taking away privileges. it might be tougher with the 10 year old but stick with it. the 4 year old is a still a toddler really and they can test you, i know. but will generally respond better to time outs. make time out in a distraction free area if you can - and do not talk to the child during the time. dont' let them leave time out until they are under control either. (a couple of minutes - 10 minutes for the oldest is the general rule). also, be a good example of keeping cool. they learn by watching you. when you are frustrated, lock yourself in the bathroom for a few minutes. and try buying some parenting books - some may have good advice. but the bottom line is consistency and balance. good luck.<br>  <br>  also - give them opportunities to express what's on their minds - as long as they are doing so in control. not screaming, you know? tell them you will listen when they are calm. when they calm down and they say "i hate so and so because he teases me" respond with something that doesn't take sides if you can so that they feel heard like " that must make you feel awful, i'm sorry, would you like a hug"? I'm telling you understanding goes a long way.|`|rid4brOnaa	So far, you've received some pretty good advice. The key is to be consistent and to follow through with the punishment. Let them know that you are serious about their behavior and that they WILL BE punished. This is where actions speak louder than words. You can't say that TV will be taken away or that they will be grounded or even spanked if you don't follow through and actually do any of those things.<br>  <br>  It will be tough at first, but don't give in. Not even an inch. An occasional short spanking while he/she is across your lap may be needed, but try other things first. Don't be afraid to repeat a spanking.

8KWmwfvoaa	I had the same problem only a month or so ago. Firstly though, don't stress at all about the amount you can or can't pump - baby has a much more efficient suck than a breast pump and will be taking in more than you can pump. Also, pumping requires you to be relaxed and happy so that your brain can send the 'let-down' signal to your breasts - so, if you are feeling stressed this won't happen as much despite the fact that the milk is actually there. Also, as your breasts become used to the volume of milk you are supplying they don't tend to feel hard or for some they don't feel like you are nursing at all! So in summary you may be producing more milk than what you actually think however, if you are concerned as I was try taking 2 capsules of Fenugreek (1000mg each) 3 times a day and a cup of Weleda Breastfeeding tea 3 times a day - this worked for me to the point where I had to pump as I had excess milk. Both are really good for you regardless of breast feeding - the tea is also good for baby (via your milk) as it helps with digestion. Also, babies sucking stimulates milk production so if you haven't been nursing all that much put baby on the breast as much as you can, even just for the purpose of soothing.<br>  <br>  Another thing to mention is that it is common for women to feel like they are producing less milk around the time the baby is 4-5 months. This is for several reasons including the fact that you breasts have adapted to feeding and don't feel hard or engorged around feed time anymore and secondly because a lot of babies have become expert suckers at this stage and are very efficient at removing milk within minutes.<br>  <br>  Good luck and good on you for sticking with it! You should be proud no matter what the outcome as!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i am starring this bc im going through this myself and my baby is 7 mons...i got caught up in the vicious cycle of supplementing and now im paying the price i need to get out of it too the only time i make enough milk to satisfy my baby now is at night time|`|CVdcrY3kaa	The more you nurse, the more milk your body will make. So, you've got to nurse, nurse, nurse. Invest in a good pump (if you have to) and pump every two hours or so (if you can't nurse her) Go to your local health food store (GNC) ask for Blessed Thistle and Fenugreek, take these as instructed...they help re-build supply. If you have to, contact a LC in your area.<br>  <br>  I re-lactated and this is what I did. My supply went from zero - breastfeeding exclusively.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	nurse nurse nurse that is the best thing you can do, pump as much as you can as well, your body supplies milk based on the demand for it so demand it and it will come back, check out your local health food store for soemthing called fenugreek capsules, they were very helpful for me when my supply started to go away.  follow the directions on the bottle it is a common herbal remedy and safe for breastfeeding women.  good luck.|`|LAsYy7C8aa	start pumping or something.  Or excuse yourself from company.  And it may be too late.  The more you use the more you produce...|`|Ds4xCthSaa	1. Drink more fluids!<br>  2. Pump more often<br>  3. Pump for longer periods of time. Not just ten minutes pump about 20 minutes|`|iTXnHiwTaa	I'll tell you what worked for me:<br>  <br>  -Pump every 2-3 hours for 10-15 min.<br>  -Take fenugreek plus blessed thistle (mother love is awesome brand) www.motherlove.com<br>  -Massage your breasts when "doing nothing" watching TV etc. Pinch your nipples a little even.... <br>  -Drink a beer every night and the pump an hour later.<br>  <br>  Even w/o supplementing, you tend to dry up quicker than if you solely breastfed. The reason is that not matter how good the pump, it can't extract the way a baby can. A naturist gave me the pinching technique. (hence "pinching" nipples works"). The best thing for me though, was mother love herbal supplement. It's a liquid (tastes gross) but goes to work fast and really helped.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	This will not solve your problem completely... but along with the great advice here you should also drink a few cups of "Mother's Milk" tea.

Good luck!|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	runny nose and fever are accompanying symptoms of teething.. yeah, being a baby is harder than it looks.. another symptom could be a case of diarrhea, so watch out for that.. there's no need to run to the er since the fever has come down.. get orajel and apply as needed (it numbs gums on contact - i've tried it myself) :)|`|t5T8urrtaa	you need to take him to the emergency room...that kind of temperature can kill them!|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	They say it's normal to have a slight fever while teething (99F for example).

mCbe2a67aa	As long as he's not crying I think it's perfectly fine to leave him. Do you have a mobile that he can look at, or maybe some soothing music. I completely agree with the not rocking him. I'm going through the whole "needs to be rocked to sleep" thing with my 9 month old and it's a nightmare, so good for you for starting early on. I know it can be frustrating that your baby won't go to sleep (even though he's not crying), but I wouldn't worry too much about it as long as he does fall asleep eventually. You could always lay down yourself while he's falling asleep, or use that time to catch up on things around your house.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11210211	It is fine hun he is still getting use to his surroundings,my daughter is 1 yr and still does this,just let him be.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't think this is a problem.  It's hard to know what an infant's sleep pattern will be this early, but it's actually good later on if they naturally will just chill out before sleeping.<br>  <br>  My son did this as a newborn and he does this still at 8 months.  Just hangs out.  The only bad part is a few times I have snuck in to check on him after he's been down for an hour, looked down and there are his little dark eyes staring right back up at me placidly.  I almost had a heart attack the times this has happened.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	when you go to sleep, you don't fall asleep right away and 11 weeks old has a busy day too, so he's taking time to sort of reflect on his day.. it's perfectly normal and since he's not crying, then he just needs some alone time.. i suppose you have quite an independent baby on your hands :)|`|TczFL0p0aa	yes he's fine! he's just enjoying some thinking time like we do before we fall into a slumber! if he was crying then yea go get him cuz he's still young to get himself to sleep, but if it's what you want, and he's fine if he were uncomfortable he'd let you know! but yeah im with... mom #2 ... i think it is<br>  i will rock my babies until they won't let me anymore :P<br>  good luck and congrats!|`|c2kopbo6aa	im gonna rock my baby to sleep until he doesnt let me anymore.....|`|vvqYECmiaa	My son was the same way, he is 6months old now so instead of just laying there looking around he will coo and babble until he finally falls asleep. i wouldn't worry about it. if he was uncomfortable  he will let you know|`|t5T8urrtaa	yes...my neice just turnt 3 months old and she been doing it for 2 weeks now...their just more alert now
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, I'm not sure what your midwife specifically told you, but tylenol mixed with a bit of caffeine, like one soda, will often help with a headache. Some women avoid caffeine completely during pregnancy, but this is actually something my OB recommended for headaches, so it is up to you guys.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	If Tylenol isn't working she needs to contact her doctor.  A severe headache during pregnancy can be a sign of something serious.|`|NysFTExhaa	It would be a Tylenol 3.  Opiates are fine during pregnancy and in some cases if a regular Tylenol isn't working a doctor will prescribe it for pain such as headache because many headache and migraine medications are not safe for pregnancy while Tylenol 3 is.  Opiates used as prescribed will not harm the baby.<br>  <br>  I had severe migraines, took Tylenol 3 while pregnant and my boys are fine.|`|3imLjQlHaa	Tylenol and Codeine?? I wouldn't think that would be a good idea though if your gf is pregnant... I don't think you should take anything stronger than tylenol...|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I was told that you can only take regualar tylenol!

XhIYAH6Laa	She can have you sign a termination of all of your parental rights, therefore never being the father and making no decisions about the baby....she could also file for child support and make you pay every month even though you don't want a child....but I think you need to step up and be a man...she didn't get herself pregnant|`|OLXv3DEAaa	The worst things? I don't know I guess she could harass you or something, but she could do that even if she wasn't pregnant. <br>  <br>  The NORMAL thing she could do would be to file for determination of paternity where they do a DNA test to see if you are the father, and file for child support which you would have to pay assuming you are the babys father. That is your responsibility (legal, moral) if the child turns out to be yours.|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Wow..... Well she might want to put you on child support... You should have thought about that before you had sex!!<br>  And it is her choice to keep the baby not yours......

85d5affd1515d40c2bfc4131ba12628daa	Prune juice or prune baby food.  Not too much, though or you'll have the opposite problem.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I agree with the water down baby prune juice or just water. Also..let her sit up in a car seat when she is sleeping for the night. Sitting up will give her the extra pressure to push downward.|`|I8XndwVtaa	First, I would go to the store and buy some baby lotion, suppositories, and some apple/pear juice. Then I would give her the juice followed by a nice warm bath. After the bath, lay her on the bed with a diaper under her bum. warm the lotion up by putting it in a bowl of hot water or by rubbing your hands together with the lotion on it first. Then massage her belly using this method:<br>  1. Begin on her right side, around her appendix area. Massage in small circles in a single direction, moving upward from appendix to abdominal area to rib cage. (What you're doing is tracing the path of fecal matter to help in constipation relief as it passes through her colon.)<br>  2. When you get to her rib cage, massage towards the outer point of the left rib cage.<br>  3. Massage down the length of her torso to the groin area.<br>  4. As you massage around the colon path, note any areas that are painful when pressed. If she seems to feel deep pain, discontinue massage and see your doctor.<br>  <br>  After you've done the massage, insert a suppository. Cut it lengthwise before inserting it, and only insert one half. Give it some time to dissolve. After a period of waiting, gently hold her feet and move them in alternating circles like she's riding a bike, occasionally pressing both knees towards her chest. Do this gently so as not to hurt her already sore tummy. The motion of the legs and pressing them into her chest can help to push out the bowel movement. Good luck. Hope she feels better!|`|wZtv16syaa	Juice might help but probably not. Karo syrup (corn syrup) in her bottle, one tablespoon per two ounces was my doctors recommendation for my son and it worked almost every time. You might also try taking her temp rectally the pressure down there seems to help. Of course I would talk to my doctor before trying any of these things.|`|R5SGjlCyaa	try and get her to drink lots of cooled boiled water.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	tiny bit of watered down prune juice might help

8SkcYhY4aa	Well when is your period due? Do you know when you ovulated? Implantation bleeding occurs 6-10 days usually after conception. So say you ovulated on the 1st, you can expect implantation around the 7th-11th. (the dates were just an example) . Right now, I am 6DPO and all yesterday I had period cramps, no spotting yet. Its really hard to tell though. But implantation bleeding is normally a little spotting for a day or two, and its usually when you wipe it will be a brownish color. It shouldnt be more than a few smudges or drops. Also, you can try testing with First Response Early Result 4 days before your period is due! <br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!|`|ms6rh3uoaa	it could be implantation bleeding. good luck

de31890e0026952623cb2dac4cee45e8aa	Pregnant woman are recommended to eat an approximate 300 calories per day more.

During the first trimester, most women usually don't need to increase their usual daily intake of calories (i.e., 1,800 to 2,000 calories) unless they need to compensate for starting a pregnancy underweight. But even if extra calories aren't consumed in the first trimester, you should still make balanced nutrition part of your daily wellness plan. <br>  <br>  During the second and third trimesters, you will need an extra 200 to 300 calories each day. But that doesn't mean feeling uncomfortably full: for example, just one piece of toast and a banana can supply those extra calories.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions to the extra-calories rule: women who start out under- or overweight, women who are very physically active, and women with certain medical conditions should talk to their doctor about specific caloric needs. <br>  <br>  Choose healthy foods to supply calories instead of high-fat or high-sugar alternatives. For example, if you like sweetened snacks and beverages, remember that fresh and dried fruits, and fruit juice concentrates, are sweet but also contain important vitamins and nutrients (unlike some other high-sugar snacks). The occasional ice cream treat is OK, but note that enjoying a cone or small bowl of low-fat yogurt is a more nutritious way to obtain dietary calcium. <br>  <br>  Women with diabetes should talk to their doctor or a registered dietitian about their special nutritional needs during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant and have diabetes should carefully monitor their blood sugar levels to make sure the levels remain within the normal range. Women with blood sugar levels that are too high risk having a difficult birth. They also risk having babies that weigh more than normal at birth and have various newborn problems. <br>  <br>  Women who did not have diabetes before may also develop the condition during pregnancy. This kind of diabetes is known as gestational diabetes. Most women with gestational diabetes can control their condition with a healthy balanced diet and moderate exercise. Medications are usually not necessary. Gestational diabetes usually disappears after the baby is born.|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Enough calories so that you will gain about a half pound to one pound per week from this point on in the pregnancy. There is no way anyone can tell you how many calories to eat, especially since we don't know how active you are, how fast your metabolism is, and how much you weigh, all of which effect your calorie needs.<br>  <br>  Saying you should gain a half pound to one per week  assumes you were normal weight starting out in the pregnancy and that you haven't gained too much or too little so far in the pregnancy.  If you were underweight, they like you to gain more, and less if you were overweight to begin with.

You need to check with your doctor to find out what's going on because it could have something to do with your cervix or the sac that the baby is in! Several things can cause bleeding during pregnancy and your doctor will have to run tests to find out what's going on! <br>  <br>  First, take a test to see if you are pregnant or go to get your blood drawn and be sure to let your doctor know what's going on! Good Luck

Also you can put a pillow between your knees while laying on your left side and that should help you tremendously. Good luck.|`|wdRDfWqwaa	From what I can read of your question, you have back pain?  Try and see a chiropractor.  Most will give a free consultation.  If you can't afford to go all the time, explain that to them and see if they can give some advice, or maybe you can just pay for an alignment once or twice a month (apx 45 each visit).  Also, try and lay down and keep your back flat.  Pull you legs to your chest a lot.
r6WJgDoXaa	Hi, I just went off the patch too, (this is my first month of trying). My doctor told me some women have a spike in fertility the first month they take it off and others don't. <br>  Hopefully we are two of the lucky ones huh!<br>  Well good luck to you<br>  <br>  E-mail me if you want to talk since we are both kinda in the same situation.<br>  bobbigarrettbg@yahoo.com|`|ThnyRl8raa	I used the patch too and it took my husband and I over 9 months to get pregnant.  However, I am not the most fertile woman in the world.  I also had to take other medications to regulate my periods while we were trying to conceive.  I wish you the best of luck.
AA10305057	I would love to be able to tell you yes so you can make accommodations but sadly the answer is no.  Newborns and unborn babies don't have a sense of time.  Their day to day schedules will be dictated largely by rotating cycles of eating and sleeping.  It will take several weeks to months to get a feel for your child's individual rhythms.  But trust me you'll never get enough sleep or just as you start to think you've got a handle on it... it changes.  Best of luck and congrats Mommy!|`|KESlvKqQaa	In my experience, both my babies were most active inside me when I slowed down.  So if I was busy all day, go go go, they were quiet, but when I finally got to sit down or try to take a nap they were kicking like crazy!  Once they were born they were typical newborns-asleep for most of the time, then settling into a pretty regular routine of awake/asleep at around 4 months.|`|73kAIvMVaa	For the first few weeks, it's likely your baby will maintain a similar schedule.  Hopefully he/she won't have days and nights mixed up, because that can be stressful.  A baby that sleeps all day will most likely be up all night. It takes about 2 weeks to work the schedule out.  Make sure baby has plenty of light and noise during the day and darkness and quiet at night.<br>  <br>  I found my baby had the hiccups at the same time every day. That finally wore off too.  But it was fun feeling him bump every day around 2pm. <br>  <br>  Congratulations --- and Good Luck!|`|AA11363314	Most definitely yes!  But if they are active at night and calm during the day you will be able to adjust their sleep cycles after they are born.  My daughter was always waking me up with her kicks at night.  It took us until she was almost 3 months, but we got her nights and days switched around to match the rest of us.  :-)<br>  <br>  My last was (and still is) very accommodating.  It only took him 2 weeks to shift.  Each baby is different, a joy and a treasure!<br>  <br>  Congratz!|`|F18FD60aaa	Yes! My fiance is pregnant and she asked her doctor and he said yes. they are used to being up at certain times and that is their schedule. It may change because of the light slightly.

AA11363314	Your amniotic fluid gets replaced until delivery even after your water breaks, just like your blood is replaced after an cut.  My water broke at home with my second and it was a gush.   When I was going to the hospital and in labor and I would change positions I would get another gush.<br>  <br>  When inutero baby's is surrounded by amniotic fluid to protect the baby and the umbilical cord from injury and infection.  Baby gets all nutrients - food and oxygen through the umbilical cord.  The fluid in the lungs helps baby's muscles and diaphragm learn how to breath.<br>  <br>  Once your water breaks doctors do not like going beyond 24 hours for delivery due the increased chance of infection.  This is true even if the doctor breaks your water in the hospital.  If you are in active labor and close to delivery doctors will go beyond 24 hours, but if you are stalled or not progressing they usually will recommend a c-section.<br>  <br>  Hope this is of some help.|`|4bc6cd62e8e289aec552a62e5d41a9b8aa	they breathe through oxygen in the umbilical cord. my water didnt break all at once i had gushes like every 10 min for like an hr and half before it went all the way.|`|YFdZLFNbaa	hmmmm... that's weird do not know much 'bout that.|`|b74dfb6f55186377a5a2d3b39d8d6db9aa	they take the first breath when the cord is cut|`|782bd1e778b860c2b1aa52c1039b9b5aaa	not sure how..except that one must give birth as soon as possible lest the baby dies....God bless|`|co3m8K9Xaa	babies don;t need to "breathe" while inside of you or even during labor, they get all the Oxygen they need from mom through the umbilical cord.|`|yxIFvpIBaa	First of all, only about 15% of women's water breaks before going into active labor.  With my first son, my water broke while I was sleeping.  Not all the fluids came out because it really wasn't that much, not a gush.  Just felt like I wet my pants.  But they do need to deliver within 24 hours after your water breaks.  With my second they had to break my water when I was about a 9.  So don't worry, the baby will be able to breathe just fine if your water breaks.|`|5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	Your baby "breathes" the amniotic fluid but actually gets its oxygen from you through the placenta. So.. even without fluids they still have air. Also.. the fluid will continue to be made as long as the baby is in there. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Their "breathing" is just practice for once they are out.|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	All I know is that when you get oxygen the baby gets oxygen.  That is a good question....I never thought about that.

e618b0803c08536f19ca5c7bccf3f93daa	When u are 1-2 weeks pregnant...you actually are not pregnant yet. The sperm fertilizes the egg on day 14 normally...so the 1st 2 weeks u aren't really "pregnant." So check with your doctor to see how far along u r. Or, to get a better estimate count the 1st day of your last period as pregnancy day #1, and so on...and then u will know how far along you probably are. But of course this is based on a normal 28 day cycle.|`|1819c9477409a8f5ac1f383fdbd03f2faa	How could you be 2 weeks pregnant and come back with a positive test? To me there wouldnt be enough hormones to trigger a test to be positive. How could they figure out so early you were pregnant. probably true just sounds weird to me. I am sure anything done this early will not affect pregnancy
ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	What's confusing is that a pregnancy is calculated as being 40 weeks, which is kind of like 10 months!  I used to calculate backwards from my due date.  So for 2nd February as your due I would say that you will be 5 months pregnant on 2nd September.<br>  By the way, my daughter was born on 2nd February - it's a good day!!!  All the best!|`|AA12163814	There's something wrong with your pregnancy calendar....If you concieved on May 12th then you'd start calculating your weeks 2 weeks prior - it goes from the start date of your last period - so let's say April 29th is where you start calculating - that means you are just about 16 weeks - that's a little under 4 months pregnant.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	Yeah I'm not sure about that calander you are using. r u sure it didn't say you were 4 months?

XPe1SZNBaa	I really dont think the Clear Blue is as accurate.  That is just me.  I took a Clear Blue test at 1 day late.  I was upset but still went on, and i didnt start the second day late.  So i ran to the store and got a different brand (first response).  It was the normal, just lines.  I thought clear blue was awesome because it actually showed pregnant or not pregnant.  ANYWAYS.  The 2nd day late, I was pregnant.  If you haven't started by now and your a couple more days late, go ahead and take a test.  It may have been too early to take a test last depends.  It all depends on your levels of HCG.|`|3APC87fraa	i think it is too early, some women can take up too 3 weeks to test positive on a urine test. if you are ancious go see a dr. and get a blood test. good luck|`|T5Gj3fvVaa	i would wait a few more days and i heard the dollar tree test are the most sensitive you may want to try one of those, i think they detect hcg at 25|`|ZAimz8inaa	By then it should start showing up but everyone is different. If you are ttc sometimes your body adjusts to that and your cycles will become longer.  My cyles were usually 26 days and got up to 32 day cycles when trying to concieve which made it difficult to tell if I was pregnant at first.  So I would wait atleast 1 week or more after your period due date.  Sometimes test wont show up till even 2 weeks or more but like I said everyone is different.

Don't give them a name that they will have trouble spelling when they get to that point. Consider what other people might shorten the name to (I would get rid of "Layland") or what kids might find that rhyme with their name when in school. Children can be cruel to each other, consider this when naming your baby. Also, make sure that the name is easy to pronounce. Nothing worse than having your name mis-pronounced by your teacher all the time.|`|rM2atOidaa	these are all good names Jay is the best guy name to me|`|fdb47953b63f30705ce1287f2c6a84e6aa	Avary or Avery Rose!

If you feel really anxious about it, you could be experiencing some depression symptoms.  Then you should talk to your doc, because you're at higher risk for Postpartum depression.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, though, everything's alright.  I think everyone has some anxiety during pregnancy.|`|gSZeWk0Aaa	YES!!!  I had a panic attack the night before I went in to have my 2nd.  I just didn't think that I could love another child as much as I loved my first and that my first would feel neglected because there was another child in the house.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry!!  You CAN love a 2nd child just as much!!  Although, it is different.  I can't explain how, it just is.  It's not that you love them any less, because you don't.  The love you feel for each of your children is different.|`|rlUegIDEaa	your first child will always be special<br>  im sure youll love your 2nd one just as much<br>  btw im the oldest so im the fav.<br>  lol|`|b721320cfcaaf3f39ec1642828d8a203aa	i can say you llove boys diffrent from girls, it will not be your first and the amazement and newness will be gone but you will love the baby as much as yoru daughter you just need to get to know him. love him and you wil be okay,. i was scared too my kids have 10.5 years  between them and i was scared that my son would not beas loved as my girl but i wqas wrong|`|cQGZCmhvaa	trust me you will soon relizae that there is enough room for your heart and more love to go around than just for one you will love your second one just as much as you love your first one|`|fb7a8cd421955fd849a8063a95dded66aa	You aren't the only one, you will find you have more than enough love for both children :)|`|i1diSArqaa	you'll love them equally yet differently.  just the way you love your spouse, your parents, and your child all differently yet equally.|`|isXRMFn2aa	Of course it's hard to imagine loving something else as much as your child, but remember, this one is going to be your child as well.  You can't run out of love.  It will be equal.
inYm8AjTaa	Can't explain the missed period, especially with the negative pregnancy test, but...<br>  At 12-14 days past what would have been the start of your cycle it sounds more like you're experiencing ovulation--I've experienced all of the symptoms you mentioned during ovulation.<br>  However, if you ARE pregnant with an IUD you really need to seen by your OB/GYN.<br>  But whether you're pregnant or not, you need to see your doctor to make sure you're okay.<br>  Take care!|`|dLqqIQ1uaa	it sounds like ur pregnant babe. even tho ur period is 12 days late, it still might not show up on the pregnancy test. wait another week or so, and then take another test. cuz all ur symptoms point to pregnancy and not a late period. good luck|`|AA10965963	usually home test are pretty accurate but they can always be wrong.

Good luck.<br>  BTW Cyst was caused from too much caffine.|`|dd7afa427b0b97cbad4abf34381626d3aa	thoses tests are pretty accurate these days however, sometimes you might not have enough hcg in your urine for the test to pick it up.

AA10780996	yes it is too early you should at least wait until you are late at least by one to two weeks then test. and when you do . try to do it with the earliest urine as soon as you wake up.  the brown spotting can be from the clomid....or pregnancy...most women do not have implantation bleeding...but it could be an interuption...meaning you took clomid and got pregnant so when your period was due you spot instead because of pregnancy...Good luck|`|0f9a21a748ca2c979bde592494593878aa	The spotting could have been implantation bleeding and you are pregnant.If you are pregnant, it is possible to be getting a negative at this point because your hormones could still not be quite high enough to turn the test positive.... or it could have just been spotting and you'll have your period soon. Wait until after the 15th to try again to tesst again... if you get your period, then you're not pregnant. Good luck!! :)|`|DTdJm93Jaa	if you get a sensitive preg test like first response you should be able to tell up to a week before u expect your period, but more likely 2 days b4 so in a couple days i would check again and if its still negative and you dont get your period in time get a blood test from your doctor|`|d6tapLxNaa	Yes you could be but, depending on your age it might be something else

Le plus difficile pour les nouveaux nés c'est la digestion. Au départ et ?a peut durer 3 mois ils ont des difficultés pas tous mais certains et la seule fa?on de dire leur malaise est de pleurer. Il existe un produit à base de plante qui les calme bien c'est la calmosine que tu trouveras chez le pharmacien. Il y a parfois un autre problème dont souffrent les bébés c'est le reflux gastro oesophagien. Le bébé peut régurgiter du lait mais là encore pas toujours et quand même souffrir de ce problème. Il faut que tu ailles voir un pédiatre qui pourra probablement identifier la cause. Le besoin que ton bébé a d'être pris dans les bras est  normal, pendant 9 mois il était dans une sécurité totale et si il souffre il est perdu alors il t'appelle. Fait exactement comme te dicte ton intuition, les mères sentent et connaissent leur enfant et ressentent ce qui est bon pour eux. Ne te laisses pas impressionner par ton mari. Les bébés pleurent aussi si il y a des tensions autour d'eux ils sont rès réceptifs aux ambiances.<br>  Pour le père comme pour le mère il y a crise quand arrive un enfant surtout si c'est le 1er. Chacun doit s'adapter à son r?le et ?a ne se fait pas sans difficultés, les pères ont parfois du mal à trouver leur place dans la symbiose mère enfant, c'est à toi de donner une place au père en lui proposant de prendre le bébé, de le changer. Parfois les pères ont une jalousie inconsciente de leur enfant qui est au sein et  ils supportent difficilement cette période. Sans compter que ton mari a certainement repris son travail et que si le bébé pleure la nuit c'est difficile pour lui.<br>  Le caprice ce n'est pas de prendre un enfant dans les bras c'est quand plus grand ton enfant fera des colères pour s'opposer à toi ou pour obtenir quelque chose de toi, le rendre capricieux sera de céder à ses injonctions celà engendrant en lui un sentiment de toute puissance qui fera qu'il ne supporte aucune frustration, aucun interdit, alors là si cela arrive oui il sera capricieux. Vas voir le pédiatre beaucoup d'enfants qui pleurent ont des problèmes de digestion ignorés. Aller maman,courage et surtout une place à papa dans la relation au bébé c'est vital pour le couple.|`|SnThAyh4aa	vous auriez du penser a regler vos problemes avant de faire des enfants|`|m3SShVFUaa	Je c'est pas quoi en penssé !|`|mMYRfI4Saa	Il se peut qu'il ait des reflux et la position allongée est une vraie torture pour lui! les coliques sont également très douloureuses et seul les bras le soulage!

Et le fait que cela soit amer ou non, dépend des enfants. Les miens, cela ne les dérange pas. La camomille a des vertus apaisantes et digestives. Tout comme le fenouil mais là effectivement, tous les enfants n'aiment pas le go?t. <br>  A ce que j'en sais, la fleur d'oranger n'est pas conseillée avant 6 mois.|`|e45dc424465370a4684c067486f8df6caa	il ne faut pas qu'elle soit trop forte,je ne sais pas si  ?a affecte les nerfs,mais fais le modérement|`|d0dba826c334abce7e323c27763fec22aa	Moi, c'était tilleul, la camomille est plut?t amère et on est obligé de la sucrer donc non !!! fleur d'oranger aussi ... pour des nuits douces et sans trop de "pipis" : les infusions font uriner et réveillent les enfants la nuit ... sauf si je me trompe.|`|4Mf2eoldaa	la camomille est parfaite pour les enfants par contre un biberon c est peu etre trop.  elle est tre jeune alors un quart de tasse devrait suffire. moi j en donne souvent a mes enfants...ne laisse pas infuser longtemps car sa rend la tisane amer. 2 a 5 min. suffise.

Quand certains te disent de te fier aux marques, je t'assure que c'est loin d'être des références. Certes, ils sont produits dans des locaux d'une hygiène parfaite mais les compositions restent plus qu'à désirer! ex, petit pot bledina aux haricots verts, il n'y a que 40% d'haricots soit 60% d'ingrédients qui n'ont rien à voir dont du sel et de l'eau de cuisson. Par conviction perso, j'ai acheté le babycook pour faire les compotes et soupes moi même. c'est d'une simplicité enfantine et ca te coutera toujours moins chere. Mais regarde toujours les produits discount si c'est 100% légume ou fruit sans sel et sucre alors pour dépanner c'est toujours ca!|`|cb97ecb4ea04f007efa166d54dd4aeedaa	ce n'est pas en payant un produit 2 fois plus cher qu'il est for?ément de meilleure qualité.<br>  Tous les petits pots ont les mêmes normes, et passent des tests avant d'être mis sur le marché.|`|qwK4muGyaa	oui aussi quand on na pas beaucoup de moyen c'est pareil partout pour les petits pots bb,sinon vous acheter des pommes et vous les ecraser et ajoute tres peux de sucre ou sinon vous en metter pas.ca depend de votre enfants si il mange bien.moi je sais qua ma fille j'acheter des pots et des fois c'est moi qui lui preparer moi-meme c'est compote.|`|596b11a8394de9734d8de8b6ddde7a01aa	Logiquement, tout ce qui touche à l'alimentation des touts petits est très cntr?lé, on ne peut pas faire n'importe quoi avec des petits pots ou du lait.<br>  Toutes ces alimentations sont normalisées par décret il me semble.<br>  <br>  Après se pose la question du petit pot, honnêtement, on ne sait pas ce qu'il y a dedans, quelle que soit la marque...|`|24de487071205d0e2e48372cba1c686baa	J'en ai acheté une fois chez Leader Price pour essayer mais je ne l'ai pas donné. <br>  <br>  Ca ne sentait pas bon.

eCUoXUKSaa	it sounds like you would be working in the gym's daycare. a lot of gyms provide child care for their clients. you would be attending to the children there. you should get a job description before you start, that is pretty important.<br>  <br>  also, you NEVER need to disclose that you are pregnant when interviewing for a job. if they fire you then it is discrimination. if you take the job, meet with your boss after you start and let them know when you are due. if it is a problem and they fire you, hire a lawyer.|`|bAoL2IDUaa	You should tell your new employer reguardless.

Good luck|`|dhiZDHcbaa	Cherry,<br>  <br>  The position of nursery attendant requires that you are continuously watching small children, probably under the age of five. Your main position, is to make sure that they are safe and happy. You will need a happy attitude, a willingness to spend time with many types of personalities including a very unhappy child. As you become further along in you pregnancy, you will become tired and lifting a child of 25lbs or more will be a strain for you. You could give the job about 4 months and you will need to examine how you feel.<br>  <br>  As far as telling your future employer that you are expecting at the time of your hiring date. I think that you should be honest and let them know you are expecting a child. However;  you can tell them that you feel great and don't for see any problems. Explain that you will be a hard worker,<br>  reliable and most of all love children.<br>  I am happy for you and pray that you will be happy too. <br>  God Bless,<br>  Jeni|`|wZQgZ6LAaa	I would start and let them know in a few weeks.

aJZ6YdFJaa	estas en una situacion muy dificil y creo que te entiendo, quizas suene dura con mi respuesta, pero te aseguro que te lo digo con toda buena voluntad. Si el propio padre no se interesa por sus hijos, te parece justo que debas dejar de lado tu vida por ellos ??? te has preguntado que sera de tu vida cuando quieras tener tus propios hijos o como sera la vida con el a medida que pase el tiempo. Creo que tenes que ponerle punto final... decirle que ya no dejaras tu vida por cuidar hijos ajenos, mientras su propio padre se interesa poco o nada.  que tambien sos mujer necesitas sentirte querida y no podes vivir a la sombra de una mujer muerta, cuando el note que va en serio lo que decis o recapacita o se queda solo, creo que mientras mas pronto mejor... los ni?os te quieren , pero si dejas pasar mas tiempo , sera mas doloroso para ellos. Lamento lo que estas pasando , espero de cada respuesta puedas sacar algo positivo y espero Dios te ilumine con su sabiduria . Necesitas vivir tu propia vida y hoy solo sos una ni?era cama adentro y no lo creo justo para vos.|`|1L5aJdkGaa	pues es una pena de situacion, informate si puedes cuidarlos ya que su padre no lo hace y separarte de el, hablalo con el, de todos modos si has cuidado a esos ni?os sie?pre algun derecho tendrás digo yo.<br>  suerte|`|7UogUgqaaa	y que pasa cuando ya o esten esos hijos  si solo te detienes por ellos mejor adios no crees|`|CT2JTZLkaa	urgente esa familia al sicólogo y tu también  piensa en ti  y llevándolos al sicólogo alludas a esos ni?os a entender|`|STfDkQTyaa	A los diablos, amiga, vos sí que te echaste encima una multitud de problemas!!!!!!!!! Tú tienes casa propia? Y si le plantearas a ese tipo insólito que permita que sus chicos estén viviendo contigo y que él venga a visitarlos siempre. Que ellos volverán con él cuando él se recupere de su duelo. Porque es justamente eso lo que lo está matando, su eterno duelo por la mujer que perdió. Obvio que los chicos en esta etapa le importan cinco pepinos, más le duele haber perdido a su mujer. Y en su subconciente sabe que tú estás cuidando sus chicos. Entonces, hazlo. Si tienes casa propia, los llevas a los chicos, con su consentimiento y lo recibes de visita cuando él quiera (sin contacto contigo en lo sexual me refiero!!!!!!!! obvio). Si no tienes casa propia, dile que entre ustedes van a tomar cierta distancia, que él busque ayuda en algún analista para que se recupere de su duelo y que mientras tanto seguirás con los chicos en su casa. Pero, cortá vínculos sexuales, porque eso a la larga te provoca más amargura, porque hasta debes sentir que cuando está contigo, él tiene en mente a su mujer muerta. Un embole!!!! Andá despacito y verás cómo se soluciona todo. Si él fue bueno en otra época, quizás algún día vuelva a ser lo que era. Una vez vi una película de un caso similar y la mujer (en este caso tú) lucha judicialmente por los chicos y se queda con ellos. No me acuerdo el nombre de la peli pero era un caso similar. Suerte. Lo que quieras contarme, estoy a tu disposición.|`|lPwhf3POaa	Me gustaria ayudarte, pero es muy complejo. Solo puedo decirte que trates de ser feliz.

Me parece que tu fe esta por los suelos y emocionalmente estas atada. Tu pareja no esta funcionando, y los problemas que tienes con él también están afectando a los ni?os. Sufren si te vas y están sufriendo si te quedas, el temor a que te vayas los afecta, y si te quedas ahí te estas afectando tu, y afectada tampoco podrás ser buena ayuda, tu novio tiene que enfrentar su situación y tu la tuya, busca a Dios, es el único que te puede ayudar. Oro por tu situación y se que él responderá, bendiciones.|`|AaqLnORGaa	simplemente cuentale todo esto a él, siempre con la verdad por delante y diciendole lo que sientes a ver si reacciona.

Si tan herido está pensando que no pudo salvarla eso le compensará su existencia.<br>  Y si ve que es incapaz que vaya a un especialista.<br>  Si finalmente la cosa no mejora y te ves obligada a marcharte de su casa intenta pasar el mayor rato posible con los ni?os, trátales como si les quisieras con toda tu alma (que seguro que lo sientes) llévales al parque, de excursión, al cine, te considerarán una amiga para toda la vida... Serás mucho más que una madre para ellos, te confiarán todas sus penas, alegrías, y tú les querras cada día más. Sólo son ni?os ellos no tienen culpa de nada.<br>  Seguramente su abuela aún no aceptado la pérdida de la mujer, si alguna vez llama a casa, dile que sus nietos preguntan mucho por ella, que quieren ir a verla etc, ya verás como se interesa mucho más.<br>  ánimo mujer ya verás como la cosa se arregla... <br>  Seguro que tu chico es un hombre responsable y cari?oso con sus hijos pero él también necesita cari?o, pq se sentirá responsable de la pérdida de su esposa. Eso no significa que no le importes, es que hay situaciones en la vida que son demasiado fuertes, irracionales, injustas y cuesta mucho mucho asimilarlas. Que se tome el tiempo que necesite para superarlo...|`|jsat5zN8aa	Hola!! sinceramente me da gusto que existan personas como tú en este mundo! Déjame felicitarte por los buenos sentimientos que tienes.<br>  <br>  Trabajas? Eres independiente? Has pensado alguna vez en adoptar a los ni?os legalmente?... Si te vas, no te tienes que ir sola, podrías ponerle una demanda de irresponsabilidad (lo cuál se podría definir como maltrato psicológico, en caso de que beba sería un punto a tu favor) y alegar concubinato para que te puedan dar la custodia de los ni?os (si has convivido con esa persona por lo menos 5 a?os).

Quizás lo que él necesita es ayuda psicológica, planteale el problema, dile lo que sientes, si es necesario ponle un ultimatum: O buscas ayuda profesional (psicólogos y psiquiatras) o te dejo!

Tienes que ver si esto va a ser pasajero o si se está relajando y echando toda la responsabilidad a ti. Lo mejor es que lo hables con él, y que te diga claramente porqué habla tanto de su mujer y que es lo que siente por tí, si solo te quiere como ni?era, tendras que pensar tambien en tí, porque si es así, tarde o temprano la cosa va a terminar ,por tu parte o por la suya. Tú tienes que saber cual es tu papel ahí, porque tu tambien cuentas, y al final te sentirás mal y todo será peor. A los ni?os siempres podrás verlos y seguirlos, ya que se ve que los quieres mucho, pero tú debes ver si este hombre está pasando solo por una depresión o te está utilizando,aunque sea inconscientemente. Esto es importante, si sigues anteponiendolo todo a tí misma llegará un m omento en que no podrás con todo, porque perderás tu autoestima, y esto termina con todo. Te lo digo por experiencia. Piensa un poco en ti, aunque te parezca egoista y doloroso, no lo es, solo te ayudará a afrontar mejor la vida. Mucha suerte,chica.

Et puis tu le récompense de quoi avec tes fraises, qu'il soit sage et qu'il te foute la paix, ben, c'est simple ton problème, il n'y a qu'une question à se poser : pourquoi tu as fait un m?me ? pour faire comme tout le monde, manière d'avoir une télé, une femme, une maison, une voiture, un gosse... quand au martinet, tu arriveras à te faire craindre par ton fils et quand il aura 16 ans (voire avant) il fera des fugues ou bien il se jettera sous un train et après tu diras à la télé : je ne comprends pas, out aller bien pourtant à la maison, il ne nous as jamais dit qu'il n'allait pas bien dans sa tête.<br>  et puis Gulli, génial, 8 heures par jour, comme ?a il te fou la paix, et il ne mets pas des jouets partout. et bien tu vas en faire un abruti de ton gosse, complètement passif, qui ne cherchera pas à réflechir. apprendre à penser, ?a s'apprend et c'est très simple pour ?a : laisse le jouer et n'intervient pas dans ses jeux mais pitié pas des jeux vidéo, des vrais jeux, des voitures, des garages, des fermes avec des animaux,des playmobils et meme des poupées (il pourra au moins leur donner le martinet pour vider l'agressivité qu'il re?oit de son père). Si c'est trop compliqué pour toi, fais appel à un éducateur, une assistante sociale, ils sont là pour aider. Sinon, de toute manière si tu continue comme ?a, tu as toutes les chances que ton gosse soit en échc scolaire dès la maternelle et en trouble du comportement avant d'arriver au collège. si tu veux en faire un cancre, continue comme ?a, tu es dans le droit chemin. Si tu n'arrives pas à le faire changer de nourriture, mets le à l'école (dans ton cas, ce ne sera que mieux) et qu'il mange à la cantine, il aura au moins un repas par jour correct.<br>  Quand à toi, mange des légumes aussi, le premier exemle pour un enfant c'est son parent, il y en a bien quelqu'uns que tu aimes un peu, et des fruits...<br>  <br>  Enfin, je me dis qu'on peut être aussi idiot que ?a, et que tu fais une blague....|`|ed08c63f8b52638e26dbec660333daf8aa	je pense juste que vous vous ennuyer et que vous venez de dire une énorme connerie, et malgré tout le respect que je dois aux autres internautes c'est qu'ils sont bêtes d'avoir pris 5 minutes pour essayer de vous comprendre et de vous repondre.|`|j1byGZCmaa	honnêtement il y a d'autre méthode d'éducation qui sont nettement meilleure que de lui collé soit un diabète soit de le rendre obèse car nourrir sont enfant qu'avec des bonbons n'est pas franchement normal, et si il mange que ?a c'est la faute aux parents, ensuite il ne faut marcher au chantage avec ses enfant car il le comprendra très vite et vous blousera dés qu'il en aura la possibilités, il faut lui expliquer qu'il y a des règles de vie et que si il ne les respecte pas il est punit sinon il ne faut pas le félicité a chaque fois qu'il les respecte car ses règle sont normales ce n'est pas un exploit de les lui faire respecter

Pendant ce temps, mélanger les oeufs et le sucre.<br>     2.  2     Ajouter la farine. (C'est très important de mettre les ingrédients dans cet ordre).<br>     3.  3     Tout mélanger, avec un fouet, pour éviter les grumeaux !<br>     4.  4     Verser dans un moule beurré et fariné et enfourner pendant 20 minutes<br>  <br>  <br>  macarons au chocolat<br>  Préparation : 15 mn<br>  Cuisson : 10 mn<br>  Repos : 30 mn<br>  Temps total : 55 mn<br>  <br>  Pour 5 personnes :<br>  #   100 g de chocolat noir dessert<br>  #   120 g de sucre glace<br>  #   60 g de poudre d'amandes<br>  #   2 blancs d'oeufs<br>  #   1 noix de beurre<br>  <br>  Pour la ganache :<br>  #   35 g de beurre mou<br>  #   35 g de cacao en poudre non sucré<br>  #   1 bonne cuillère à soupe de crème fra?che<br>  #   1 cuillère à soupe rase de sucre glace<br>  <br>      * Préparation <br>     1.  1     Préchauffer le four thermostat 6 (180°C). Casser le chocolat en morceaux et le faire fondre au bain-marie.<br>     2.  2     Mélanger 80 g de sucre glace avec la poudre d'amandes. Ajouter le chocolat fondu et remuer.<br>     3.  3     Battre les blancs en neige ferme. Quand ils sont assez fermes, incorporer le reste de sucre en continuant de fouetter jusqu'à ce qu'ils deviennent lisses et brillants.<br>        Incorporer au mélange précédent en faisant attention de ne pas casser les blancs.<br>     4.  4     A l'aide d'une cuillère ou d'une poche à douille, déposer de petits tas de pate sur une plaque à four recouverte de papier sulfurisé légèrement beurré et fariné. Les espacer suffisament, car ils s'étalent un peu à la cuisson.<br>     5.  5     Laisser sécher à l'air pendant 30 minutes. Faire cuire 10 minutes à 180°C. Décoller les macarons et laisser refroidir sur une grille.<br>     6.  6     Préparer la ganache : dans un bol, travailler avec les doigts le beurre et le cacao en poudre. Quand le mélange est homogène, ajouter la crème fra?che, mélanger avec une spatule. Ajouter ensuite le sucre glace et mélanger encore. Le mélange doit être homogène. Avec une petite cuillère, déposer un peu de ganache sur la moitié de macarons et couvrir avec l'autre moitié. <br>  <br>  macarons à la pistache<br>  Préparation : 30 mn<br>  Cuisson : 12 mn<br>  Repos : 30 mn<br>  Temps total : 72 mn<br>  <br>  Pour 35 petits macarons :<br>  #   170 g de sucre glace<br>  #   125 g de poudre d'amandes<br>  #   20 g de pistaches<br>  #   3 blancs d'oeufs pas trop jeunes<br>  #   colorant alimentaire vert et jaune<br>  #   30 g de sucre en poudre<br>  <br>  Pour la ganache :<br>  #   2 jaunes d'oeufs<br>  #   100 g de crème liquide (entière c'est meilleur)<br>  #   50 g de pate à pistache ou 25 g de pistache + 25 g de sucre<br>  #   20 g de beurre<br>  #   2 sachets de sucre vanillé<br>  <br>      * Préparation<br>     1.  1     Préparer le biscuit macaron :<br>        Moudre les pistaches, ajouter les amandes en poudre et le sucre glace et continuer à hacher le tout. Ne pas hésiter à hacher longtemps car plus c'est fin, mieux c'est.<br>     2.  2     Monter les blancs en neige. Il est important d'utiliser du sucre normal et pas du sucre glace. Quand ils commencent à prendre, ajouter une cuillère de sucre. Quand ils sont bien montés, ajouter le reste du sucre et continuer à battre. Cela doit être bien blanc, lisse et brillant.<br>     3.  3     Incorporer la poudre mélangée et tamisée dans les blancs d'oeufs montés. C'est à ce moment que l'on peut mettre du colorant, mais c'est faculatif. Mélanger doucement, avec une spatule en caoutchouc. Le mélange doit être bien brillant.<br>     4.  4     Dresser. Personnelement, je n'ai jamais maitrisé la poche à douille. Donc, je prends un petite cuillère, cela va aussi bien. De toute fa?on, la pate va s'étaler un peu à la cuisson. Ne pas oublier de mettre une feuille de papier sulfurisé sur la plaque avant d'y déposer les tas de pate.<br>     5.  5     Laisser poser 30 minutes. Préchauffer le four à 150°C.<br>        Enfourner, en doublant la plaque de cuisson, très important pour avoir la forme du vrai macaron et pas une sorte de cookie. Faire cuire environ 14 minutes. Le temps de cuisson dépend forcément de la taille des macarons et du four : il m'a fallu plusieurs essais avant de trouver la bonne température pour la bonne durée.<br>     6. Macarons pistache  6     Préparer la ganache :<br>        Comme moi, on peut faire sa propre pate de pistache en mixant 50 % de sucre avec 50 % de pistache.<br>        Mélanger les jaunes avec un sachet de sucre vanillé. Faire chauffer la crème avec la pate de pistache et l'autre sachet de sucre vanillé. Une fois qu'elle bout, ajouter les oeufs, mélanger vivement et laisser épaissir sans bouillir tout en mélangeant. La crème épaissira encore en refroidissant (comme une crème patissière classique). Ajouter le beurre ramolli avant le refroidissement complet.

ees7VqOCaa	On ne peut pas être contre. Quand j'ai vu la question, je me suis dit "quelle dr?le de formulation!".<br>  <br>  C'est comme demander: la santé, êtes-vous pour ou contre?<br>  <br>  L'amour, vous êtes pour ou contre?<br>  <br>  êtes-vous pour ou contre les yeux?<br>  <br>  Edit: Ah, Lady O, t'es une vraie de vraie dénaturée. Dis-moi, est-ce que c'est toi qui prend ton mari tous les soirs?? est-ce qu'il te dit qu'il a mal à la tête, certains soirs? fais-tu pipi debout, Lady? Pourquoi choisir "Lady" comme surnom? Je comprends pas. T'aurais pu t'appeler "Mister O", ou "Big Boy O", ou je sais pas, moi! Que c'est beau l'égalité sexuelle!<br>  <br>  Cecile: le blocage psychologique est assez compréhensible. Notre société est hautement sexualisée, beaucoup trop, et les femmes comptent beaucoup trop sur leur apparence pour attirer le "bon", et sur leur corps pour les rendre heureuses pour le reste de leur jour. <br>  <br>  Le blocage psychologique, je le comprends.<br>  <br>  Ce que je ne comprends pas, c,est le nombre effarant de femmes qui ne se battent pas contre ce blocage parce que ce blocage les amène à priver LEUR ENFANT d'un aliment parfait, et d'un contact physique parfait.<br>  <br>  L'accouchement, c'est pas un blocage, ?a, peut-être? et des blocages, est-ce qu'on en combat pas tous les putains de jours de nos vies? Alors pourquoi, dès qu'il s'agit de combattre un con de blocage au nom de l'amour de notre enfant, pourquoi sont-elles si nombreuses à refuser de combattre?<br>  <br>  Parce que ne pas être à l'aise avec l'allaitement, ?a n'a rien de naturel, et allaiter, ?a a tout de naturel. <br>  <br>  Si vous aviez un blocage sexuel par rapport à vos fameux seins; si, par exemple, vous n'étiez pas capable de les montrer à votre partenaire quand vous faites l'amour, vous vous rueriez chez le sexologue pour le combattre, votre maudit blocage!<br>  <br>  Mais là, vous voulez qu'on vous applaudisse de tout simplement abandonner? Eh bien laissez-moi vous dire une chose, mesdames les modernes: je ne vous admire pas d'abandonner. C'est égoiste. Encore une fois.<br>  <br>  Et je m'excuse, Cécile, mais ce passage m'a fait bondir: "(donner le biberon) c'est tout aussi respectable que de vouloir allaiter, ?a ne fait pas de bébés carencés en quoi que ce soit"<br>  <br>  Cécile, c'est faux, archi-faux, et toutes les femmes qui ont choisi l'allaitement le savent parfaitement. Ne jouons pas aux hypocrites parce qu'on veut avoir l'air totalement ouvertes d'esprit et modernes! L'allaitement et le biberon ne sont absolument pas comparable, et à bien des niveaux, pas seulement alimentaire!<br>  <br>  Dire que les deux se valent, c'est comme affirmer qu'une barre énergétique est aussi bonne qu'un repas équilibré fait des aliments de la meilleure qualité.<br>  <br>  Dire que le biberon vaut l'allaitement, c'est comme affirmer que d'envoyer un email de mots doux, c'est aussi bien que de faire l'amour.<br>  <br>  **Edit pour Cécile:<br>  <br>  Ah Cécile, quelle réponse intelligente et inspirée, et avisée! et je ne blague pas. Je suis sincère. Comme toujours de toute fa?on...<br>  <br>  Mais je crois que le conditionnement très difficile dont tu parles n'est applicable que dans quelques cas plut?t rares. Je sais qu'il y a un conditionnement social anti-allaitement et pro-sein=sexualité et rien d'autre. Mais je ne crois pas, comme toi, qu'il soit si difficile à combattre pour la grande, l'écrasante majorité des nouvelles mères.  <br>  <br>  Je crois qu'il y a, malheureusement, beaucoup de mères qui manquent tout simplement de bonne volonté. Je n'idéalise pas la mère, ni la femme, ni la grossesse. Je crois sincèrement qu'il y a beaucoup plus de personnes paresseuses et égoistes qu'il y a de personnes "traumatisées" par un conditionnement  anti-allaitement...<br>  <br>  Les Lady O de notre monde en sont, à mon avis, un exemple. Elle n'est pas conditionnée, ni traumatisée. Elle est simplement obsédée par son nombril, sa personne, et son féminisme dématernisant. Son pauvre enfant va collectionner les carences affectives, et attend un peu, dans 2 ou 3 ans, ?a va commencer à barder. Les problèmes de comportement, son enfant qui va soit tyraniser les autres, ou être complètement vulnérable, les problèmes à l'école, et tout le bataclan. Comment veux-tu faire autrement quand ta propre mère vit la maternité sur les freins depuis le début? Quelle connerie que ce féminisme-là. Vraiment, quelle connerie! "Le biberon qui a libéré la femme". Stupide idiote!<br>  <br>  Je pense qu'il est tout simplement beaucoup plus facile d'abandonner lorsqu'une chose risque de nous demander un certain effort. Surtout si cet abandon ne nous concerne pas nous, directement, dans notre bonheur, notre égo-trip, notre confort. ?a ne fait QUE concerner notre bébé. C'est pour cela qu'il y a autant de femmes qui trouvent tout à fait facile de ne pas élever leurs nouveaux-nés et de les plaquer chez une dame, et aussi, de ne pas les allaiter.<br>  <br>  Et ces personnes sont rapidement déculpabilisées par des personnes qui, comme toi, sont remplies de bonnes intentions et sont bonnes, à l'intérieur. C'est le c?té pernicieux des excès de bonté. Tout le monde s'élance pour déculpabiliser les mères qui ne veulent rien faire de difficile pour leur enfant: "Pas grave! tu es une bonne mère quand même! pas grave! le biberon c'est aussi bien! pas grave! tu aimes ton enfant et 10 minutes de casse-têtes, le soir, ?a suffit amplement pour combler tous ses besoins affectifs!" Franchement, je crois que les campagnes de déculpabilisation des mères sont plus nuisibles que le contraire.|`|64f9264fce2c53ff8080c7545df33a36aa	J'ai donné le sein à ma fille. A chaque têtée, j'avais mal au sein (crevasses). Et je ne parle pas d'un tiraillement, je parle d'une vraie douleur en début de têtée, au point que j'avais les larmes aux yeux. Ayant suivi conscienceusement tous les cours de prépa, j'ai appelé les sages-femmes pour qu'elles m'aident à comprendre ce qui n'allait pas et comment corriger. A ce jour, je ne sais toujours pas !<br>  <br>  Alors pour toi c'est très simple ? Tout est noir ou blanc ? Allaitement = bien ? Ben dans mon souvenir allaitement = pourvue qu'elle se dépêche.<br>  <br>  Je n'ai aucune envie d'allaiter le prochain enfant. Il est quand même probable que je le ferais pour me donner bonne conscience. Je ne sais pas.<br>  <br>  Par ailleurs sache qu'il existe la péridurale qui permet de ne pas trop souffrir durant l'accouchement. Mais visiblement pour toi le r?le de la femme est d'enfanter dans la douleur. Et après pour les trucs qu'on ne fait pas à la mère de ses enfants (surtout depuis qu'on l'a vue aussi dégoutante pendant l'accouchement), comment tu fais ?<br>  <br>  Pour finir, j'en ai rien à foutre de ma coiffure et je pense rarement à l'allaitement, sauf quand on m'en parle. Bref, tu donnes vraiment l'impression d'être un bon petit macho (et je dis pas ?a à cause de ton opinion sur l'allaitement) !<br>  <br>  Je trouve que les problèmes famines qui font mourir des enfants chaque seconde en Afrique sont plus importants que nos petits problèmes d'allaitement (à ma connaissance aucun enfant fran?ais ne meurt à cause du lait artificiel).

(je préviens les copines, là, je dis ce que je pense au fond de moi, mon avis sans compromis)<br>  <br>  tu comprend bien les origines de ce blocage, tu as bien conscience du conditionnement dont souffrent les femmes vis à vis de leurs seins, de la sexualisation des dits seins<br>  comme le dit la blague, "les seins, c'est comme les trains électriques, fait pour les enfants, mais c'est papa qui joue avec", tu pense au poids de la société sur tous les aspects de nos vies, et surtout sur notre rapport à la maternité, à nous, qui sommes particulièrement fragiles sur ce plan là pendant une grossesse.<br>  rien que cette blague montre un conditionnement terrible...<br>  <br>  Tu te plonges dans l'histoire, et tu t'aper?ois que les origines de ce conditionnement sont si profondes, qu'il est ancré en nous avec une grande puissance, qui le rend très difficile à combattre.<br>  Il est à l'origine de nombreux échecs d'allaitements, parce qu'une femme mal déconditionnée ne pourra pas se défendre psychiquement contre lui.<br>  <br>  Personnellement, je n'en suis pas atteinte du tout, et ?a m'a été très difficile à comprendre.<br>  Il a fallu que je rentre dans une maternité au début de mes études de sage femme pour voir des nouveaux nés au biberon (et j'ai 5 frères et soeurs de nombreux cousins, je n'avais jamais vu un nouveau né au biberon)<br>  Pour moi, le bib, c'était pour les femmes malades, sans lait, ou les grands bébés, c'est dire...<br>  <br>  Et j'ai beaucoup cherché d'où ?a venait, pour pouvoir aider les femmes désireuses d'allaiter à se déconditionner (la grossesse est aussi une période propice au déconditionnement, du fait de la fragilité psychique que ?a implique -fragilité nécessaire à l'intégration d'un nouvel être dans sa vie-), et quand tu y regardes de plus près, par exemple, une femme arrivée à l'age de 20 ans, aura vu 50 à 70 fois plus de bébé au biberon que de bébés au sein, ce qui fait que son image de la maternité est de base, déformée.<br>  Quand tu y regarde de plus près, pendant près d'un siècle le discours médical a été "achetez le lait du docteur bidule, le lait maternisé -expression interdite par décret- spécialement con?u pour votre bébé " = votre lait est mauvais, le mien est fait exprès par des labos<br>  Quand tu y regardes encore, tu as tout un héritage péjoratif autour de l'allaitement, notamment avec l'avênement des nourrices campagnarde en Europe au 19ème siècle, qui a amené l'amalgamme "allaiter = tuer mon bébé" car allaiter, c'était abandonner son bébé, idée qui reste très présente dans les couches populaires de la population, et l'idée qu'allaiter, c'est mal s'occuper de son bébé -car confié à une autre- dans les couches supérieures<br>  Tu ajoutes que les femmes ne peuvent plus bénéficier de la transmission d'expériences d'une femme à une autre (exemple: ma belle mère qui n'avait jamais allaité a fait arrêter son allaitement à ma belle soeur, pour cause de lait "pas crémeux" et de couleur bizarre (penses tu, le lait était un peu jaune, donc méga gras, mais elle ne le savait pas, que c'est pas du lait de vache...) et moi j'étais pas là pour la rassurer)<br>  Tu ajoutes qu'on rabache à longueur de temps que l'allaitement, c'est beau, c'est facile, etc... et tu te retrouves avec des femmes déséspérées parce que non, le premier mois, c'est dur, les eins doivent s'y habituer, un bébé c'est fatiguant, il faut que la production de lait s'installe, etc... (et qui en plus, vont joyeusement décourager les autres, en disant que c'était hoOoOorrible, alors qu'en fait, c'était juste normal)<br>  Et lutter contre des dizaines d'années de conditionnement, plus les dizaines d'années de conditionnement des autres, dur dur, très dur...<br>  <br>  D'où, l'abandon précoce de l'allaitement, d'où un non allaitement, parce que mal conseillées trop conditionnées, etc...<br>  <br>  voilà ma réponse, ce que je pense être à l'origine de la difficulté qu'on les femmes à faire face au blocage<br>  <br>  Et à propos de blocage et d'accouchement, il y a des femmes qui n'arrivent pas à lacher prise, et qui se retrouvent avec une césarienne, parce que "bloquée", col qui ne s'ouvre plus, et ?a, c'est un échec dans l'accompagnement, parce qu'il suffit de la rassurer, par les gestes la parole où l'attitude, et tu la retrouve complètement dilatée en une demi heure...<br>  Une femme détendue psychiquement accouche plus vite (l'inverse est vrai aussi, mais c'est très difficile à évaluer)|`|6e8f56678475a2f871e64d214da9622aaa	Désolé mais moi perso j ai refusé d allaiter, c est mon choix, je m en porte à merveille et mon bb aussi, alors chacun fait ce qu il veux, je ne critique pas l allaitement mais qu on n aille pas critiquer mon choix qui ne regarde que moi, effectivement je suis pour la modernité, pour le bib qui a libéré la femme et j en suis ravie, ?a ne plairait certainement pas mais je m en fiche, que chaucn se mêle de sa vie.|`|aBHtygCOaa	je suis totalement pour, il n'y a bien sur que des avantages. Et je pense qe certaines femmes, à la vue de cette question , ont une réaction exagérée. C'est bon, à force de jouer les féministes, vous vous enfoncez de plus en plus.<br>  <br>  Moi j'ai voulu allaiter mes 2 enfants, mais j'ai des gloutons!!<br>  Pour ma fille, l'après-midi même après la naissance, elle hurlait de faim après avoir passé la journée au sein, le colostrum ne lui suffisait pas ( car pour info, le lait n'arrive qu'au bout de 3-4 jours et la lactation est vraiment établie vers le 3eme mois), alors biberon de complément, pas le choix, alors engorgement ( ca fait mal!!), et allaitement mixte pendant 2 mois.<br>  Pour mon fils, allaitemetn exclusif pendant 4 jours. Mais dès le 2eme jour, début de crevasse (pas du à la position du bébé, les sages-femmes ont bien vérifiées). Mais il passait comme même 1H au sein toutes les 2H, malgré ?a ce sa passait bien, il avait même grossi, j'étais pas peu fière!!<br>  Mais après, je sais pas ce qu'il s'est passé, ems seins ont quadruplé de volume (pire que pamela c'était affreux) te mon mari devait m'aider pour marcher tellement j'avais mal, c'était une douleur affreuse, et impossible de dormir, allongée ca s'écrase, c'est 10 fois pire.Après j'ai eu les tétons qui saignaient!! Donc l'arrêt de l'allaitement s'imposait, et puis j'en avais marre.<br>  <br>  <br>  Je te raconte tout ?a pour te montrer que non, allaiter est loin d'être facile, et je comprend si certaines femmes n'ont pa le courage ou la force d'essayer. Malgré tout, si j'ai un 3eme enfant, j'essayerais à nouveau de l'allaiter, même si moi j'ai pas eu de chance à ce niveau.<br>  <br>  Donc, il ne faut pas confondre ne pas avoir envie d'allaiter, c'est le droit de chaque femme et de chaque homme, car je pense que non, mesdames, même si c'est votre corps, le père a comme même son mot à dire, après si vous voulez pas, je suppose que votre mari vous forcera pas mais il a son mot à dire, c'est son enfant aussi.<br>  A ne pas confondre avec le fait d'être CONTRE l'allaitementt. La, effectivement, je ne comprend pas comment on peut être contre.<br>  Ne pas le faire et être contre sont deux choses totalement différentes.<br>  Si vraiment y'en a quelque une ui sont contres, je pense que tout simplement elles ont rien compris.<br>  <br>  Et si une femme est mal à l'aise, son enfant le ressentira. Il vaut mieux ne pas se forcer.<br>  Mieux vaut un biberon donné avec amour qu'un sein donné à contrecoeur.<br>  <br>  @ toutes les idées recues que j'ai pu lire :<br>   - non les hommes (pas tous en tous cas) ne considèrent pas du tout leur femme comme moins exitante, n'importe quoi!! Il faut séparer l'image de mère de l'image de la femme::<br>   - l'allaitement n'abime PAS les seins car, ne l'oublions pas, les seins sont FAITS pour ?a!!! C'est leut fonction. C'est la prise et la perte de poid rapide ( donc plus la grossesse) qui peut abimer les seins.<br>   - et allaiter en public ne doit aucunement géner (après la pudeur c'est autre chose, amsi l'acte en lui-même ne doit pas choquer). C'est la chose la plus belle et la plus naturelle au monde. En quoi cela peut-il déranger de voir une femme qui allaite? Et si, comme j'ai lu plus haut, elle est chez des amis, ou est le problème??? Ce n'est qu'un sein!! Faut arrêter un peu!! Après si la femme est complexée, la c'est encore un autre problème|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	Et une femme qui ne se sent pas à l'aise pour allaiter est stressée et cela est très mauvais pour le bébé.<br>  Pourquoi juger?|`|fcee758be0715f930722b7d7502651f4aa	comme tu le dit très justement..tu es un homme..moi ce qui me dépasse c'est justement le jugement d'un homme qui du fait de la nature n'aura jamais à se poser la question d'allaiter ou pas! ce qui me pose problème c'est cet espèce de forcing et de matraquage pro allaitement auquel nous assistons depuis quelques semaines! Mais bon sang nous sommes libres de nos corps et jusqu' preuve du contraire nous sommes libres de nos choix! c'est parcequ'il existe des mecs comme toi qui culpabiliserait leurs épouses que beaucoup d'allaitements se passent mal! on allaite parcequ'on en a envie et pas parceque nous sommes des mamifères! <br>  pourquoi continuer à avoir des enfants? mais parceque nous en voulons..et que je te rassure le fait de ne pas avoir allaité ne fait de nous des "sous mères!"<br>  pourquoi s'alimenter par le tube digestif? parceque  manger procure du plaisir et que la sécu ne serait pas Ok pour financer 6 millions de gastrostomies! et puis d'ailleurs les paralèlles que tu fait n'ont strictement rien à voir avec le schmilblick!

Cependant, tu poses un jugement de valeur. Les spécialistes s'accordent à dire que c'est plus difficile lorsqu'une femme a été élevée au biberon ... & il y a des femmes qui ne peuvent absolument pas pour des raisons psychologiques très puissantes. Une de mes amies d'enfance était dégoutée par cette image de donner le sein. Pour son fils, à la maternité, ils ont tenté de l'y contraindre mais sa révulsion était si forte que son nouveau-né lui-même se détournait d'elle. Aujourd'hui, elle attend une petite fille & a prévenu tout son entourage & l'équipe médical de son dégo?t pour l'acte d'allaitement qui pour elle a valeur d'autorisation incestueuse.<br>  Dans des cas comme ceux-là, je pense que ?a ne sert strictement à rien d'insister pour procéder à une mise au sein. Pourquoi un tel blocage ? Pourquoi une telle assimilation à un rapport sexuel ? Je pense que c'est lié à des troubles profonds de l'enfance dans la relation parentale & s?rement un mauvais rapport à son propre corps, mais je ne suis pas psy.<br>  Ton raisonnement revient à condamner ces femmes-là. Ce serait comme condamner un schizophrène ou un dépressif des comportements liés à sa pathologie. Même si c'est dommage qu'il existe de telles situations, en tenir compte te rendrait plus tolérant & ouvert d'esprit, non ?|`|64a9196b651e584bb14079942e61227caa	Et comment peut on être pour ?

Chez certaines femmes (c'est rare j'en convient) l'allaitement maternel représente une situation trop fusionnelle pour qu'elle puisse être supportée. C'est une des raison pour lesquelles on peut encourager l'allaitement, mais ne jamais forcer les choses.<br>  <br>  Edit : Pour ajouter un touche au débat de Viviane et Cecile. Le conditionnement à partir des mythes et des croyances ancestraux sur l’allaitement en France est omniprésent.

My HCG levels were high in the morning and low at afternoon to evening and the tests would come up negative.

How tall you are has a big effect on it. The shorter you are generally the quicker you will show because you abdomen is not really big enough for the baby so the baby will start to show quicker. Congrats if it's you.
TqLKsJjaaa	From past experience, when I stopped taking my pills or even missed 3 days, I would get bleeding, looks like a period. Stopping it mid cycle might have just messed up your system, but if you are in doubt, do take a test.|`|8f0f3a882068beac26a7cb59df3b0864aa	It is highly unlikely that you are pregnant already.  It will probably be a few month's before your body reaches the hormonal equilibrium required for you to conceive. In the meantime, start eating right, get some over the counter prenatal vitamins and start taking them, also get some calcium supplements  (a good idea to take regardless of whether your pregnant; but pregnancy and nursing can also deplete your body of calcium.), go see a dentist NOW before your pregnant and address any dental issues (there is a connection between low birth weights and premature birth to poor dental health--not to mention that you dont want any dental emergencies to force you to introduce pharmaceuticals into your system while your pregnant that could be harmful to a developing baby); eliminate trans fats, caffeine, nicotine, artificial sweeteners, & refined sugars from your diet as well.   There are many good books out there that can provide you with lots of useful info.  Now is your best time to read up.   Some good web sites I visited while pregnant and trying to conceive were: babyzone.com, babycenter.com, and AskDrSears.com. <br>  <br>  Finally have fun trying and all the best.   IT"S A LOT OF WORK BUT . . . THEY REALLY ARE WORTH IT!!!!

Pour la quatrième 11 kg. Le poid de départ de la maman n'influe pas sur le poid que l'on prend pendant la grossesse, ce n'est pas parce que vous faite 75 kg que vous allez prendre beaucoup de poids, il vaut mieux éviter d'ailleurs car l'accouchement serait difficile. Ce n'est pas non plus parce que vous prenez plus de poids que le bébé sera plus gros (sauf si du diabète est décelé), ma dernière faisait 4 kg 575 et était mon plus "gros" bébé. J'ai à chaque fois perdu les kilos pris dans l'année qui a suivit la naissance. J'avoue que je n'ai pas du tout fais attention à mon poids pendant mes grossesses sauf la dernière et si je devais recommancer j'éviterais de prendre autant du poids car s'il n'est pas complexant d'être ronde pendant la grossesse  (pour moi tout du moins), c'est plus difficile à vivre  après la naissance quand vous souhaitez remettre vos vêtements et vous sentir bien dans votre peau. De plus la fin de la grossesse est un peu plus difficile car 22 kg en plus en quelques mois ?à se sent quand vous monter les marches, vous êtes vite éssouflée. Pour bien faire il faut en parler avec les professionnels qui vous suivent  pour savoir ce qu'il est bon de manger, éviter de succomber aux fringales avec un paquet de chips et lutter contre les oedèmes  qui sont fréquents quand on attend bébé.|`|i7VVb8lnaa	Si ta femme est mince et de nature à l'etre, elle prendra max 15 kilos,<br>  mais si elle est comme moi, gourmande et avec à l'origine quelques kilos en trop, elle peut prendre comme moi jusqu'a 28 kg, mais petit a petit j'arrive à les perdre.<br>  <br>  Tout depends de la personne.|`|l07r03uBaa	1iére plus 8, 2iéme plus 12, 3iéme moins 10....une grossesse ne fait pas l'autre.

I have heard so many negative things about caster oil, but if you are using it with your dr's knowledge and approval, I say why not.  If you do, try to mix it into something that will mix well with oil.|`|FXPTeTcPaa	Someone on here said  before that it makes the baby have its first bowl movement inside of you, which is bad...as well as really gross.|`|Lj8wZiLuaa	i would never recommend castor oil. ever.|`|764VusKlaa	i have four daughters and a son. never worked here. two had to be induced|`|NeBwkjWOaa	I know your doctor didn't tell you to try castor oil. It can be dangerous. I have tried it myself and it didn't bring on labor for me.....it just gave me diarrhea, bad diarrhea. It can also cause you to become dehydrated, which can be very bad if you're pregnant. Keep trying sex, it does work!! Castor oil is really gross to drink too, you might not be able to get it down without throwing up. If I would have known how dangerous it was, I would have never tried it.|`|Q3mKpmecaa	My aunt used it when she wanted to go into labor with her daughter.

1XAUxQlDaa	He might need some more physical activity during the day. My daughter is only 2.5 but she's the same way. If she doesn't get enough stimulation during the day, after about 1am...she's up. And she doesnt nap either. What I do is have activities for her to do. Now, she's not in school or anything. Unsure if your child is, but, having about 2 to 3 mind stimulating activities even physical activities really helps. Then when the day is winding down and its close to bed time I give her a nice warm bath. Let her play in there for a good 40 minutes. Then put bed time lotion and infant vicks on the bottom of her feet. I notice it really soothes her. Then I lay her down and she goes to sleep. If she still wakes up in the middle of the night, I usually go in there and tell her its sleepy time and she needs to try and go to sleep. I will stand there for a little big just in case she gets up and remind her. Then she will usually go right to sleep.|`|EX1GjjJCaa	Knock him out.|`|oojO4WAraa	Take him on a long walk every day to wear him out.  He will sleep through the night.

I am always regular and I was four days late and I received my period yesterday. I hope you are pregnant if that's what you want. I would wait out a few more days and try testing again. Good luck. Baby Dust.....|`|1Qvt2vtqaa	If in one week your AF doesn't come or your don't get a BFP go to the doctor and get check out. Some women don't get a BFP until later in pregnancy.  Your doctor could send you to a blood test that are more accurate.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I know your freaked. The best thing is try to relax but that is like telling a zebra not to have strips. I have had 2 misscarrages, and one stillbirth. They say at 6 weeks they really cant see a heartbeat yet anyway. Its usually after 8 weeks. What they CAN do is a vaginal ultrasound to see a fetus. In my one miscarriage I went in for bleeding at 6 1/2 weeks they did all what they are doing to you. By 8 1/2 weeks I had the vaginal ultrasound and they only found a Placenta. I had re-absorbed the fetus earlier and the Placenta had enough hormone to keep my body acting pregnant. I didn't actually have the miscarriage till then with help of medications.  I do have a healthy 23 month old girl now, and early in my pregnancy with her I did bleed a couple times but she turned out fine. So just keep up with your spirits and nature will take its course. Just remember you havent done anything wrong!    No one can answer that and that will only make you worry. IF you want a solid answer, you are likely more on the misscarrage path but that would be GREAT if I was totally and 100% wrong. For you and the baby. I wish you nothing but EXCELLENT luck and WISHES and hope only for the best of everything for you|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I had horrible cramps around 6 weeks and the ER nurse and doctor flat out told me I had a miscarriage (without running any tests)  The next day I had a follow-up with my doctor and the baby was fine.     Just try to relax and don't get ahead of yourself...|`|ddP3klT3aa	It doesn't really sound good, but wait until your ultrasound. I never had the pregnancy symptoms either and had a past due, healthy baby. No sickness, sore breasts, nothing.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	It sounds exactly like when I had my miscarriage. I hope it turns out better for you. I know its exhausting waiting to know, good luck.|`|0aHprppqaa	I am 37 weeks along today. At 6-9 weeks I had spotting on and off not associated with cramping. I had an internal sonogram at 9 weeks to make sure it was not an etopic pregnancy or any other problems and all was well. Now with only 2 weeks to go (being induced Feb 16) its just a distant memory. I know u worry from conception to birth and beyond but worrying will do u no good, it cant change anything. Chin up girl and good luck.|`|hT1bVVFraa	I'm sorry but it sounds like the same thing that happened to me. They checked my blood 3 times in one week, and even though the hcg levels did go up, the pregnancy still resulted in a miscarriage.. the doctors like you to stay positive so they aren't always as honest with you as you would like them to be, even when honesty is what you would prefer more than false hope.    And as far as your lack of pregnancy symptoms, for my miscarried baby I had sore boobs etc, at 6 weeks, but I am pregnant again with a healthy baby and didn't start seeing symptoms of morning sickness and sore boobs and tiredness until 10 or 11 weeks, Just remember each pregnancy and woman is different.    Good Luck!
RwoN3E9Uaa	I waited as long as I could possibly wait, by law, and still keep my job.  12 weeks.  I would have much rather had Canada's policy and taken the year!    If you do not have the luxury of 12 weeks or more than minimum 6 weeks.  By then breastfeeding will be well established and you will be able to pump when away from baby.  You will also be well on your way to recovery.  Ideally, of course, you would stay home but we all know that is not always possible.|`|AA12057835	I went back to work when my son was 8 weeks old.  I had the option to come back at 12 weeks, but FMLA would not pay for the last 4.  I had to keep the money coming in so I had no choice.  It sucked, the first week back was the hardest.  But my son didn't seem to have a problem adjusting to the sitter.  I think it actually helped him to get to know her better so that he won't have separation anxiety when he gets older as bad.  My son was with me first thing in the morning until I dropped him off, I occasionally popped in at lunch to visit, then as soon as I got home he was my  1 priority (I felt bad for my hubby lol).|`|AA11981363	I went back to work when my baby was 3 months old, I only had 12 weeks paid of maternity leave, and I couldn't afford to stay home. It is very hard on mom and baby, but they also get used to things very quickly. If you can stay at home as long as you can, I wish I could have stayed home at least 9 months! but, you gotta do what you gotta do.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I went back to work at 3 1/2 months and I think it was a good decision.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I went back to work at 3-4 months.

Couldn't afford to take more time off. But, I had an advantage that I work at home and I never had to resort to daycare. I did hire someone to look after them at home, but I was close by to keep an eye on things, and of course nurse. Good luck!|`|0zWJlNi1aa	Im going back in May - when my son is 9 months - I think the maternity rules here in the UK are much better than in the US from what ive seen moms write on here|`|GGBDkOuFaa	I went back at 8 weeks, it was hard but she was able to stay at home with her daddy and not go to a daycare. So that helped, I was also able to go home and nurse her at lunch time.|`|3MelQFxOaa	First off, no matter how old you leave your child, it is going to be very hard. I left my baby when she was 7 weeks old, and guess what. She is a very happy 7 month old baby, that isnt super attached to me, and she is very independent. Nothing is wrong with working while having a baby that young. If you need to work, go ahead and do it, your child will be fine without.   Here are a few things to consider, are you going to be paid for the time you have off with your baby? The first couple of months I feel are the most money you spend. You are finding out what you need, and you may go through more diapers because you don't understand your babies BW yet. How much they eat, what kind of clothes you need etc. If you are not getting paid, you might want to consider going back to work at you 6 week post birth. If you get paid for 3 months, I would deff. stay 3 months, but whenever  you choose to come back, if it is at 6 weeeks old or 3 months old, you can not feel guilty. You are doing what is best for you and your baby. I am not mad at my mom for leaving me with someone at 3 weeks old! She had the pay the bills. Babies need someone there for them, to feed, and change them.|`|CdodhnP5aa	I went back to work when my baby was 3 weeks old, my husband stays home with the lil one so I was not worried about leaving him.  If I had to leave him at daycare I would wait till he was at least 2 months old.|`|qStmw7qgaa	I unfortunately have to go back to work 6 weeks after I had my daughter.  I personally didn't want to go back to work until my daughter started preschool or kindergarten.  But we weren't that lucky.|`|iPEv1lRBaa	I would try to stay home AT LEAST the first 3 months (until breastfeeding is well established if you plan to do so).  I went back to work full-time when me first son was 2 weeks old and it SUCKED!  When he was 9 months old I took a part-time job.  I was only working part-time when my second son was born and went back to work when he was only 5 weeks (only 10-15 hours a week, but still sucked).  Luckily, I was able to take a full three months off with my third son.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I think it depends when mat leave is over and if you can afford delaying going back to work and if your job allows you that. I think a lot of the moms dont have the luxury and go back to work when the baby's quite young.   Im in Canada so here the laws are different, I took 1 yr paid mat leave with both of my children, and by then I was ready to go back to work ;) But seriously I couldnt have left my kids at 2 or 3 mos in a daycare just too young.  But I understand that not everybody has the same benefits in America so I guess everybody does what they can.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I went back to work full-time when my son was 4 weeks old. I didn't have a choice, but it has worked out just fine. The only thing I do that my husband can't do (we work opposite shifts so we only need a sitter for 2 hours per day) is breastfeed, so I invested in a good pump. The baby doesn't need his mother close all the time, he just needs love and attention. I would not put a baby that young into a daycare, but in the first couple of months anybody can meet your baby's needs if they are invested in his well-being and love him.
s4LWmcTjaa	As soon as my son would freak out and throw tantrums, I would get down to his level and say "Look at mommy.  Did you want the  (let's say) cup?"  And usually I can name a couple of objects until I get to the one he wanted and then I help him learn the correct word.    But if he continues to whine and throw his fit, I put him in his room and let him go until he calms enough to be rational (well rational for a 2 year old!).      I think this is more of a communication issue than it is a disciplinary issue.  But for full out tantrums that are getting defiant, time out is a good resource for him to calm down.    Discuss with your husband ways that you can both be a united team in this effort.  Giving him what he wants lets him know that words are not necessary to get what he wants.  I would not want your son to suffer what your step daughter has.  Be consistent with what you are doing and it will surely produce the results needed.  Trust me.  I've been in your shoes! :)|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	If the 'timeout' is just to calm down, then why does it matter if the toys are there?  Doesn't that help him to calm down?      Just calmly tell him that you can't understand him, but that you want to.  Help him to calm down.  Help him to find words that you can 'understand' & that help *you* to feel calm & willing to help.      It doesn't have to be either your way or your husband's way.  You can each interact with your son in your own ways.  Your son is able to understand that people are different from each other & react in different ways to him.      You and your husband should keep trying to understand each other.  His opinion has just as much merit as yours does.  Responding to your son as soon as he understands him, even if it's in a tone of voice that is irritating to you, is a polite & loving thing to do, too.  Maybe he doesn't see the point, at this particular stage in your son's development, in pushing for perfection in communication.      Of course, your point that this may be creating a bad habit is valid & has merit, too.      So, try to see things from each other's point of view.  Realize that you both share the same goal of raising a good person, but that you may be taking slightly different paths to get there.  Respect each other's intelligence & way of thinking, though.  Respect each other as parents.  Know that having a variety of resources, a variety of approaches, may actually *help* your son in the long run.  If one approach doesn't work, doesn't speak to your son & his particular learning style, maybe another will.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	try inflicting a lot of pain.. and that will make the child fear bad behavior|`|XMA4BzuSaa	Be strict but fair... Don't give in, this will teach him how to communicate properly and just because you kick and scream doesn't mean you'll get your way. If there isn't a learning disability stick to your guns and be patient.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Just keep it up, hon.  Repitition with little ones is how they learn.  My daughter whines and I just tell her to use her words and then I'll say the word and then she'll try to say something and if I know what she wants I give it to her.  Patients......as hard as it is sometimes........is what you have to have with them at this age.   As for the fits........ I let my daughter get it out of her system (while we are at home) and just go about my business.......she calms down and we find something else to catch her attention.   If they need to be in time out........the limit is 1 minute per year of age.    As for your step-daughter......... you may mention it to the day care to talk to your husband about speech thearapy.........if you are low income there are programs that will help you.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	You have to engage the child.  Tell him to use his words.  If he doesn't know what it is, have him show you.  This is a learning opportunity for both of you.  When he shows you and if you know he knows the word, ask him what it is.  A lot of this, as I am sure you know, is a control issue for them.  If you make it an issue, it becomes an issue.  Remind him that he is not to whine and state, "When you can say it without whining, you may have it"...and that's IT.  You may have to make him understand what you mean by whining.  Say it in a whiny voice, "Nooooo whiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiing".  No arguing with a two-year-old!  No tug-of-war about what you want.  "Say it and you will get it."  Children of this age need assistance in getting under control.  It's the stage.  You should also be talking to him about every day mundane things like, "See that car?  That car is red.  That car is shiny."  Short, complete sentences.  Let him help you around the house..."Can you get the broom for me?  Thank you for the broom." Etc., etc.  Let's face it, we all feel like idiots at this stage talking like this but it's not about us, is it?|`|CqJpbEA7aa	2 mins! One for each year of his age!!!!|`|1veacHkjaa	You're doing right! Good for you for standing your ground. In the end this will help him with communication immensely
AA11327039	Those are all teachable moments.  When she comes home saying stuff that concerns you then you need to stop everything you're doing and have a little heart to heart with her.  You can say something like "What does Anna do that makes people think she's mean".  "How do you think it makes Anna feel to be left out"  "What do you think you'll do if the girls call you mean or leave you out of a party one day"      Then follow up with "What are some things you do that makes you nice"  "If someone is being mean to another child at school, what can you do to help that child"|`|sC0NvRzEaa	I worked in a daycare with age 4 kids, the girls imitated the shows that they watched on TV. They talked about party's, boys cheating on them and all kinds of stuff. I thinks its horrible!!  Some pick it up from moms, but mostly from the baby sitter TV|`|JsqMSU9Haa	they get it from older siblings|`|wluJx79taa	She picks them up around school.  Around school we learn allot [13]  -Stuff that we weren't used to at home.    just sit her down and talk 2 her about whats rude and whats honest.  and that somethings are better received when its said in our head.    -Good Luck (:|`|NgUbzaF9aa	It's sad to say that children DO learn bad behaviors from their parents. If the parents are mean to others...gossiping/judging others around the child, they will pick it up. They could also learn it from older siblings. This is a little more acceptable seeing as teenagers still act like children.    If it really bothers you then have a talk with some of the mothers and see if they have seen the same behavior for their children. You should all learn to cooperate so that your girls don't turn into "mean girls" someday.    Though I hate to say they might not grow out of it until their late teens. I've seen many girls being ignored for a party invitation over the most trivial things, so don't be to surprised, even if you have a talk about it, if she keeps on acting like this until she's 18.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	All of use say we don't say or do that stuff in front of our kids. I have meet a few that really don't, But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors. These kids get it from somewhere. TV, where are the parents while the kids are watching? Don't believe half of what people say they do or don't do with their kids because they will never admit the truth. All you can do is correct your own child if you hear her say this stuff and hope for the best.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Girls are probably slightly worse than boys, I think. But I think they get it from siblings, shows, other kids at school, and parents who say things they probably don't even realize they say. I remember I was out shopping one time and overheard a probably five-six year old girl looking at an outfit and say, "oh my *God*!" Her mother barely even batted an eyelash. I couldn't imagine my kid saying that at that age!    Maybe you can come to pick her up a few minutes early and watch her interacting with the other kids ... for me this has been a bit of an eye opener - both about my son's behavior (which I'm not surprised, and if anything I"m too quick to blame him!) and the behavior of other kids. There's one boy in the class (the teacher's son) who is very bossy, and knowing his mother LOL I know where he got it from! : /|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I wonder this myself. I have a little boy,but believe me, boy world is no different when they are little at the toddler/preschool age.  I had a couple weeks ago in a grocery store a complete strangers child (who was considerably older than mine) tell my son he looked like a freak because he had curly hair and that he should have been a girl.  I was livid! I turned around and had a few words with the mother regarding her sons rude mouth and the need he had to bully a 2 year old. My son is barely 2 and this kid was easily about 8- and sporting a shirt from a Nazarene church!! That's what floored me- they were obviously religious people the way they were dressed, but honestly!  I guess it evades no one in this day and age to be that way.    I don't know where kids learn this meanness from.  The only thing I can think of is they are picking it up from TV they watch or hearing it from listening to older children or adults who should know better.   It's sad that kids have to be that way and that they can't just be polite to each other.  Kid's don't have to like everyone they come in contact with in life, but I think they need to be learning that regardless they will be polite about it.    I think if it were my child telling people "if you're not nice to me you can't come to my party" then there would be no party period and a long discussion on why it isn't nice or appropriate to say those things to people.  I'm surprised the teachers don't step in and tell the kids "that's not a nice thing to say. how would you feel if someone said that to you?" but they don't.     Every parent in the world wants to think their child is a perfect angel that wouldn't do those things either. Sadly, some of them if not all of them do at some point.  Maybe the parents that are aware their child is that way just don't want to believe it and "turn a deaf ear and blind eye" in denial because they don't know how to deal with it.  What's sadder is that sometimes kids pick this stuff up from TEACHERS after the parents leave because they over hear the teachers talk between themselves about "so and so being a trouble case" or "so and so is a pain in the neck because of __".  If parents could hear half of what gets said by teachers in lounges and between each other it would infuriate them to no living end at how cruel teachers can be once the school doors close and the day begins.  I've seen it first hand and refused to sit for lunch in the lounge after the first day because of how bad some of it was. I preferred to eat in solitude on my own rather than listen to adults belittle children because they thought they were behind closed doors.
7G8w8TZcaa	it was really cute in a way but for some reason it freaked me out completely,i m currently 22 weeks pregnant,i love to feel my baby move all the time but NO ONE EVER TOLD ME I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE LATER ON!!my husband would faint if he saw this,he is already so scared of looking at my belly!!i make my baby listen to music all the time too & sure enough i get the response as well!|`|DJqDAKmDaa	aww.. too bad I'm at work and can't watch youtube. I'll go home and watch this.. can't wait!    Thank you so much!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I love it!!!!  That was my favorite part of being pregnant!!!!  My daughter would move all day long and then when somebody would try to feel it she would stop.  LOL My Mom felt her move probably three times and I saw her everyday.  That silly baby!  She would always move for my husband though.  Anyways, have a good day TTC Fairy!!!!!|`|scdOdaTKaa	That is so awesome made me want it even more...My mom was a bank teller when she was pregnant with me and she said she that when seh leand on the counter to reach for something I woudl kick and push her off of the counter haha...it's so amazing and I can't wait to experience it. Thank you!|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	That is so cool|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	Its really nice :-)  and amazing too...  But was just thinking of the mother too.. it was hurting her...|`|LlVJiVoIaa	wow that is amazing i cant wait to have the feeling, im hoping i get to have that feeling!!! :)|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	Thanks TTC Fairy! That is so awesome. I can't wait for my turn!! Praying really hard the Fertility Blend works this month. Even though I am only CD12, still low peak on the fertility monitor. Can't wait until I get that high or peak reading.     baby dust to all!!!!!
Ra8cdjbDaa	I went through pretty much the same thing.  I had a miscarriage last February and am now 28 weeks pregnant.  This one was a planned pregnancy and I wanted to have this baby so much.  Along about the 7th week I started feeling really upset and depressed like I was trying to replace the other one so soon.  I felt so bad because I didn't want THIS baby, I still wanted the other one.      People kept telling me I'd grow to love it but I felt nothing, even when I saw him on the ultrasound.      It wasn't until I found out this one is a boy (around 18 weeks) that I started to feel SOMETHING for this baby.  Now I am so happy and excited..    I know for me it was a mixture of hormones, feeling sick non-stop, and the recent miscarriage that really made it hard on me. It went so far that I was actually suicidal and went to the doctor about it..    If I came out of it, I am sure you will to!  Good luck girl!|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	It's the hormones, if you have any other feelings, like ones about hurting yourself or others you should talk to your doctor.|`|79eRDIbXaa	Yes all normal Honey!!!  I have days Im fine and days I just want to cry my eyes out.  I mean I have alot going on at home but either way the pregnancy hormones are raging lol xx|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    yes this all is very normal and is caused due to the increase of hormones in us...the hormones levels make us feel some time good and sometime bad about the pregnancy..i too get such feeling but they end up soon..and that is why pregnancy is called a roller-coaster ride where we have mixed feeling or a good & bad feeling one after the other..    hope our body adjust to these hormones and we will be feeling better after sometime..    hope this helps you..!!|`|evnLjcnxaa	Welcome to pregnancy honey! It is your hormones and it is truly a roller coaster ride. You will have those good days and then the bad it's totally normal. However if you feel like your getting depressed contact your practitioner as soon as possible. However what your describing here isn't signs of depression just a normal pregnant woman's hormones. Stick to a healthy diet, try pregnancy pops for the sickness although it should be easing up soon and I highly recommend the book, "What to expect when your expecting" by Heidi Murkoff, I would have been lost with out it during both of my pregnancies. Also for a spirit lifting read try,"Belly Laughs" by Jenny Mcarthy. Hang in there and Congratulations!!|`|ZX5aVIA4aa	yes its normal|`|ozYFumgFaa	haha, that is so normal your body is going through a major turn around. One day you can be the happiest person in the world and the next you are questioning everything and everybody! Your body will change and so will your moods. Try to enjoy it as long as you can. I definately miss being pregnant :) Its a experience of a lifetime. Try taking vitamins the might level you out a bit more not by much though your hormones are going to be a bit nuts... good luck take care|`|UfgLRgOxaa	yes..it is normal ,you will go on like that for a while...it comes with the changing of the the body and your hormones|`|WJGXqi0baa	I think a lot of women go through these phases. It is your hormones and some of it is nerves as well. You may also be nervous about having another miscarriage. I know when I got pregnant after having my miscarriage, it was hard for me to grow an attachment to the baby until I knew everything was okay. Just relax, more thanlikelyy, you are going to get sick and everyone worries about how fat they may get. its all normal. Just enjoy the moment because before you know it, its going to be over and you are going to have a beautiful lil baby!!!|`|MFsuN8Doaa	I'm 37 weeks ago and I still have teary unhappy moments were I could curl up in a ball! My pregnancy was sort of a planned/unplanned thing, as I had literally just had a miscarriage and then conceived straight after while I was still very upset.     It is just your hormones playing havoc with your body, you'll probably find a the next few weeks that you will chill out and you'll be happy before the onslaught of the final weeks of pregnancy hits you.    I wish you the best of luck. x|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	Sounds like what you're experiencing is normal, with being pregnant, def have a lot of hormones going on & the experience itself.|`|0OtHu9Zmaa	It's absolutely normal - it's all the hormones to blame. I was exactly the same way through the whole preagancy (mine too was planned). I kept thinking - 'Oh my Gosh, what am I getting myself into?'. I got to believe it's hormones because I had very fixed emotions even after the baby was born and I was nursing... But as soon as I stopped nursing, I think the hormones went back to normal, I was my old self. Absolutely no regrets about having that beautiful boy of mine.|`|dd2vz570aa	It isn't your hormones, its you as a person being scared of change.  I went through the same thing.  It is such a life changing experience, its huge.  Your life will never be the same again.  Every part of your life will be changing from your social life to your figure.  Its such a big deal for a woman. Like nothing you have ever felt before. I felt worried about the way my life was changing until I was about 20 weeks pregnant then I realised, I wanted my baby so much that all these changes are positive.  All I want is her now and I don't miss my figure or my social life anymore.  Im happy with the changes, it just takes time to get used to.|`|ROJans2Taa	oh for sure it's normal, even after you have the baby, you get days when your just sort of going through the motions, sometimes we build up this idea of how it's going to be and feel like before hand, that when that rush of emotions dies down, we feel a little sad, it's like right after a huge adrenaline rush you get the let down, you'll have ups and down throughout the pregnancy and possibly even after the birth, all totally normal. best luck
GGBDkOuFaa	My boobs need a break, seriously.  Im going to wait another 4 years or so.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	We want one more...hoping for a girl(well hubby wants another boy) we'll probably start TTC in a year or so.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	We want one to two more. Probably two, but we will decide when we get there.    My son just turned 1 yesterday, and we decided a while back that we would TTC when he was one, so we have just started TTC.      I love being a mom as well, and we want our child fairly close together.  My brothers and I are all 2 years apart and we have always been very close and are good friends.  My husband has one brother who is 12 years younger then him, so they didn't really grow up together, he has always been a little jealous of my child hood because his was lonely without close siblings.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I honestly don't know. Maybe one more, although i'd always wanted 3 or 4. I had an easy pregnancy but i'm finding things so hard.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	After I had my first I wanted more. She brought so much joy and love into my life. She wasn't conceived in the best circumstances so I had to wait until I found the right guy to be their father before I could have more. When I met my husband we started trying as soon as we got married. I got pregnant on our honeymoon. Unfortunately I miscarried that one. Two months later I was pregnant again and we had our son. About a year later I wanted another one so we started trying again. Two months ago we had our beautiful daughter and decided she was our last.|`|Qz3sii2caa	We just had our second baby last July. Our first child was 3 years old. He sure likes being an older brother, though he does get jealous from time to time.     My husband and I have decided on a third child. The plan is to have him/her before our second child's 2nd birthday. We're trying for a girl, but knowing my luck I should start looking forward to my house full of men. LOL|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I want 4.    When our son was born, we never used birth control after we were able to have sex again. We have decided to let nature be in complete control of when we get pregnant. Our son is 8 months, and we are currently about 7-8 week pregnant with  2.    So I supposed we started TTC a month after our son was born.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	I loved being a mommy so much when my son was born, I wanted another one right away. I weaned at seven months so I could get my period back and get pg again. I got pg at nine months and now we have two little boys that are 18months apart. We want more, but might wait a little longer this time, becasue two is a handful right now.    There is plenty of love, time and patience to go around, and NONE of my children will turn out messed up just becasue they are close in age. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. bad parenting is what turns out messed up children.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	We do want one more child. Our first is a boy and I'm hoping for a little girl so if we have another boy then we might consider a third. We plan on trying to conceive again when our first turns two.|`|qpABQjPGaa	we had our son 14 months ago and before he was born we started talking about how many kids we wanted...we narrowed it down to 2 or 3 and now we are playing it by ear.....we are going to start trying for our second one soon and then once that little one arrives we will play it by ear and see what we feel then.....|`|BypjotRpaa	Logan is 11 months old and i've always wanted 2 children..a boy and a girl (hopefully)..we are kicking around the idea of TTC when Logan is 2.5 y/o.. i'm excited and scared all at once. pregnancy was not fun for me at all, but the reward at the end is always worth it!|`|AA12057835	I just had my first almost 6 months ago.  I always said I wanted 2, a boy and a girl with the boy first and out of diapers.  Well I got my boy....but I'm not so sure I want a second baby now.  I hated being pregnant, I hate the way I look now (my self esteem is shot), and my family doesn't produce many girls....and I know that if my second is not a girl I will not be happy (sounds bad I know).  But I do LOVE being a mommy.  So when everyone asks "when's the second one coming", I just tell them "we will see how we are when he's out of diapers".|`|VY4LqfLpaa	well, I've ALWAYS wanted 2...1 boy and 1 girl.  We have a 7 month old boy...the only problem though is that my husband and I can't have kids on our own (vas reversal did not work - as far as we know)...so we had to do IVF to get our son...BUT, I've been feeling really weird lately and I've heard that there is about a 1 in 1000 chance that it could work...so I'm figuring on testing just to see for sure before I go to the doctor to try to find out what is going on with me...I'm just really nervous though b/c I had a dream right before we found out that we were having a boy that we had a boy, then twin boys, then another boy, and then finally a girl...soooo, guess we will wait and see...the plan though was to wait till our son was about 18-24 months to go for another IVF attempt...|`|HvALvdc7aa	I want another one soooo bad. I have an 11 year old and a 8 week old. She is so precious and my son is a big help. My hubby doesn't really want another one b/c this pregnancy was so hard on me. I guess he is just worried something would happen to me and he would have to raise the kids alone. My Dr has told me it wouldn't be smart to have another either. She said my body is just not made for bearing children. :(  I have thought of adoption but I really want another baby of my own. Im 32 so Im not getting any younger. I think Im gonna wait a few months, find another Dr, and try and convince my hubby we can do it.|`|9CUaikUEaa	i always wanted 4 children, and right now i have 3. but something i learned off my mom; when you have a young baby (like 1 or 2), wait a couple of years before your next. otherwise the younger one wont get the attention it needs and will turn out a bit messed up.  i waited until the older one started school.|`|0zWJlNi1aa	I want 1 or 2 more - not sure yet.  I have a boy already so I will have another and if thats a boy I will try again and hope I get a girl but if I dont I obviously wasnt meant to have a girl!!    I will start trying for my next in a few months so there will be 1 and a half years between them|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	We want one more. We're going to start trying when our son is 2. I'm hoping for a girl!|`|CoSdW7xQaa	well I just had my babyboy 3 months ago but we definitely want more!  We'll probably wait a couple years to ttc again. I just love being a mommy.|`|MQ34YW28aa	yes my husband and I want another one. we had our son 9 weeks ago. i had him by csection so we are going to wait at least a year so i can give my body time to heal. i would like to wait until he's out of diapers and can talk. I don't want my kids too close in age, i see moms out there with their kids close in age and they look so stressed out. I don't want that.|`|W64mdYf1aa	It depends on circumstances really. Are you working full time? You will have to consider financial stability as well. It's not just about bringing a child into this world. It's also about thinking of their future, and if you are able to provide for their needs. If you have all those sorted out, then the advisable age to follow up a child is when she's 3yrs. That will give you time to enjoy your first one first and for your body to recover from pregnancy. But that's really up to both of you.|`|DsB0WLbsaa	I have a 5.5 mo old baby, my husband and I dont plan on having anymore. Despite being young, and very able to have many more it has just been far too stressful with just one, that I couldnt imagine doing it again. I LOVE my son, dont get me wrong, but the sleepless nights, and stress is just far more than I want to repeat.  But we have busy careers and im also going to college full time, maybe once life settles a little bit we can talk about having more, but until then I dont want to be ttc any time soon!|`|7YZiy9iWaa	My husband and I want at least 3-5 more children. We definitely want a big family! We have already decided that we are going to TTC again this December! We are SO excited! :)|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I just had my son in dec and I cant wait to have another one BUT I am waiting one for my body to heal and two cause I had a c section.. I want to wait and heal good before I try to see if I can try for natural again but have th c section as my trump card.. LOL
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The best option is ibuprofen as its "L1 - safest" and a mild anti-inflammatory.    There are some new concerns about codeine, some moms make more morphine from codeine and the baby may overdose.  For this reason its slowly being replaced as the drug of choice after c-sections.  However if you took it after your baby was 3-4 days old and there was no problem its highly unlikely there will be a problem now (the first few days when baby gets colostrum babies get less than after the milk "comes in")    Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that is rated L2    Also consider that there may actually be something wrong with you!      (You are probably a bit young but my mom and MIL had this:  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Frozen-shou... in your case its probably just an injury but you may need physio and/or massage therapy -and we all know that would just "suck")|`|s30Duwdraa	Have you tried the disposable heat pads?  They come in different sizes and they last about 5 hours or so.     I had the same problem while i was breastfeeding and i found they were a great alternative to medication.    You should ask your hubby for a massage too!  :)    Good luck!|`|2dLf3KHnaa	i think al u can take is paracetemol but try deepheat warming patches i used them whilst having contractions|`|GGBDkOuFaa	tylenol or ibuprofen is ok.  I know there's a lot that you can take because I could nurse my daughter while taking percocet AND ibuprofen 800 from my c-section.    Oh yeah I forgot about the morpheine pump I had !
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	If you want to do it at home try and have her eat an apple. Otherwise get her to the dentist if the new tooth tries to grow in under that it could get impacted and cause infection.    EDIT: Her red puffy gums could be a sign of infection or just irratation. Get her into the dentist as soon as possible, having an infection is going to be more painful that pulling it. An infection of the gums can cause a lot of other serious problems if it isn't taken care of.|`|pSaUlVa5aa	you could just yank it while she's sleeping and tell her the tooth fairy got tired of waiting to fall on its own so it had to take drastic measure, haha. Have her eat apples. Take her to the dentist.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Take her to the dentist.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Apples and Licorice always seemed to work when I was little I lost lots of teeth trying to bite apples and once I actually cracked a dead tooth in half on a piece of soft licorice. Other then that you could just pull it fast of take her to the dentist and they will do it for her. At this point I would be starting to worry about it falling out and her swallowing it.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Eww.    Tell her she has ten minutes to pull it out herself or you will take her to the dentist to do it - and then ring the dentist. She obviously can't clean it properly, and the decay can easily spread from it to her new tooth. Plus it sounds as if she has an infection already. Forget bribery, she's out of time.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	school nurse helped my daughter get it out..sometimes someone not as close as mom can do it without "freak out city"|`|3sGkmzOYaa	take her to the dentist|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	Leave it alone. It will fall out eventually on it's own. The black thing inside of it is just the dead nerve. It isn't going to kill her or you to leave it hanging there.     ...but if you have the uncontrollable urge to pull it out then wait until she is sleeping and grasp it with a dry cloth and pull it out...but, if she catches you in the act then you run the risk of losing her trust...    I say, leave it alone.|`|nrQijvMuaa	Oh Girl I thought Maybe That "Tooth Fairy" Bribe would have worked. I guess as the post above me states the best bet is take her to the dentist. IF not tell her that she doesn't want an ugly tooth hanging out kids are going to laugh at her ! Maybe she'll get embarrassed?    Yes Prob an infection especially with the food that she is eating etc... Put orajel n pull it!t|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Best thing to do - pull it out while she is asleep.  (only if she is a med/heavy sleeper)   By the time she wakes up, it will be out and over with.    Best of luck!|`|Yql4JTKPaa	if it has been a month, it can cause some kind of health issue for your daughter. as expensive dentist are your going to have to bring her in.    what if it came out while she slept and by mistake swallowed it or it went down her throat the wrong way.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	u need to take her to the dentist she probably has a infection. the reason she won't let u pull it out is because it most like reallly hurts! it would probably be best to take her to the dentist so they can numb the area then pull it out|`|7WcfzvPvaa	My daughter won't pull her teeth out either.  She won't wiggle them or anything.  One thing that I did do was while she was sleeping I kind of told her to bite on a paper towel that her tooth was bleeding.  She didn't really wake up, just bit down on the towel, and I tugged on it, the tooth came out with the towel.  It's worth a try.  The only other suggestion I have is to tell her that if she doesn't pull the tooth out, you are going to take her to the dentist and have him do it.  That works too.|`|agTCqkLDaa	If it's that big of a deal, take her to the dentist.    My mom always pulled mine out and it was quick and easy...either her or my first grade teacher (back when teacher's had rights) did that nasty job for us :)    I lost my teeth by biting into an apple, corn, and once, just once, in a spoonful of mashed potatoes that were served alongside a hamburger.      I had "shark teeth" too like it sounds like your daughter has, but I didn't have any black stuff (that's a tar/cavity/or more severe issue).    It sounds like she needs to see the dentist for that alone and they will be able to take out the loose tooth.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	if its hanging and dead do I of 2 things. Snatch that sucker when shes not expecting it or take her to the dentist and let them do it. If its rotting it could spread to her other teeth. I would do one or teh other asap|`|fXzed3fLaa	Put something on her to cover her eyes, then pull it out.  Also, spray it with numbing spray the kind for a sore throat.  If she cant see that may take some of the anxiety away.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.llli.org/FAQ/firstfoods.html  Good first foods for babies    Save money and give your baby the freshest food by making your own baby food. Here are some suggestions.    Fruits    Most babies love fruits. Make sure they are ripe, and wash well before peeling. Here are some favorites:        * Bananas cut into slices which have then been halved or quartered      * Unsweetened applesauce, or tiny apple chunks that have been softened by cooking in the microwave      * Plums, peaches, pears, and apricots, gently cooked if necessary      * Avocado diced into small, bite size pieces    Vegetables    Fresh vegetables should be washed, peeled and cooked until tender. Frozen veggies are convenient to have on hand. Avoid the canned varieties to which salt has been added. Your baby may enjoy:        * Baked or boiled sweet potatoes, in tiny chunks      * Mashed white potatoes      * Baby carrots, green beans, peas and squash     Meat and fish    Babies often prefer well-cooked chicken, which is soft and easy to eat when shredded. Be careful to remove even the tiny bones when serving fish.    Beans and legumes    Remove the skins from beans as they tend to be harder to digest. If you use canned beans for convenience, make sure they are unseasoned.    Grains and cereals    Commercial, iron-fortified cereals are often the first foods served to babies who are not breastfeeding because they need the extra iron, but breastfed babies are rarely anemic as the iron in human milk is well-utilized. If there is concern about the baby's iron levels, a simple test can be done in the doctor's office.    Whole grain cereals, breads and crackers are the most nutritious. Wait until later in the year before offering wheat products. If you use cereals, make sure that they only have one ingredient and use either water or your own milk for mixing. Many mothers prefer to let their older babies chew on a hard bagel or an end of bread instead of sugary teething biscuits.    http://www.llli.org/NB/NBMayJun99p86.htm...  Fun Finger Foods    (adapted from Feeding the Whole Family)        * Pieces of ripe avocado, peach, nectarine, banana, plum or melon      * Pieces of steamed apple or pear      * Dried fruit (soaked in water to make it softer)      * Whole grain breads, crackers and pita breads      * Whole grain pasta and noodle      * High quality dry cereals      * Cooked whole grains      * Pieces of baked or boiled white or sweet potato      * Pieces of baked or steamed squash      * Chopped vegetables, steamed until soft (carrots, peas, etc.)      * Well-cooked beans      * Soft or silken tofu cubes      http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...  There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later  usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/  Yet experts say children over 6 months can handle most anything, with a few caveats: Be cautious if you have a family history of allergies; introduce one food at a time and watch for any problems; and make sure the food isn't a choking hazard.    Parents elsewhere in the world certainly take a more freewheeling approach, often starting babies on heartier, more flavorful fare  from meats in African countries to fish and radishes in Japan and artichokes and tomatoes in France.    The difference is cultural, not scientific, says Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' nutrition committee who says the American approach suffers from a Western bias that fails to reflect the nation's ethnic diversity.    Bhatia says he hopes his group soon will address not only that, but also ways to better educate parents about which rules must be followed and which ones are only suggestions.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I agree that he is too young for crisps, you risk damaging him with too much salt, babies can get poisoned with salt very easily and crisps are incredibly high in it.  You could try sandwiches with soft cheese? My daughter used to love that. Soft fruits are great, and mine loved cheerios (which I used as distraction while I was preparing her food!)|`|JSruV3Wuaa	Pinkies?    When he's older he can move on to the bigger and more nutritious forefinger|`|k4gxs7a3aa	I think that sweetened cereal like fruit loops would be good for him but if you something that's low in sugar you should consider cheerios but I doubt if he'll like them.|`|rsdKX1fyaa	A7 month old baby shouldn't be having wotsits and Skips!  they contain salt, which babies shouldn't have until over 1 year old (their bodies cannot cope with it)    Try:    bananas  toast  sandwiches  pieces of VERY ripe pear  cheese|`|uN1zCMmjaa	bitter biscuts gerber makes em... mum mums... and the puffs. :)|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	I started slicing apples and banana up.

Soft fruits like bannana are good in very small bits...or a VERY ripe peeled pear held in yout hand for him to bite on.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Steamed or boiled veggies, slices of soft fruit, like bananas.  Cheerios or other cereals with holes in them (though they are currently too tiny for my son to reliably get into his own mouth, which kind of defeats the point of finger food.)    I'm going to the grocery store today and I was thinking some pieces of avocado would be neat, if I can find one ripe enough.|`|bM1TrzGjaa	Vegetable sticks|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I give my son goldfish and cheese puffs he really enjoys them, of course he is 9 months and has a ton of teeth. But there are some little rice rusk called baby mum-mum that i found in the store and the little gerber puffs are good too.
bAp35x7uaa	Definitely with the Z.  Unless you want people to pronounce it e-lisa-beth?  Why not go the whole hog and stick silent P in there as well, LOL    Joking aside, everyone is going to spell it with a Z anyway and you'll just end up getting frustrated trying to correct them.  Plus, Elisabeth will  end up shortened to Lisa.    You want that?    If you want to call your child Elizabeth, then stick with the Z - you know it makes sense ;-)    p.s. it's a great name - we're calling ours that if its a girl :-)  And we're shortening it to Betsy!|`|NWEJdpocaa	Elisabeth for sure...it's a little more feminine looking and to me it's a little more elegant sounding.

She can have a beautiful and classic first name for when she's older and needs something professional, and when she's a baby she can go by Lissy, Ellie, Beth, or Elisa. Maybe even Lissy-Beth.

AA10201960	You'll be surprise, tights for BOYS do exist, but they are hard to find, try ebay, or a google search. I even see some with boyish design like cars, houses, train, boat,...    In some countries like German, Denmark, even Japan, it's completely normal for boys to wear tights. More and more children tights are marked has "for children" or "for kids", NOT just "for girls".    Here a few link from a German site:    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...    http://kinderbutt-de.erwinmueller.com/sh...

I can't really suggest anything else that won't traumatize him if he DOES have to change his clothes. Like for gym class.|`|oojO4WAraa	Long johns - thermal underwear.  They make them in all sizes for boys and girls.|`|h0rt6YJ4aa	I'm a 22 year old guy and I got some under armour ones.  Not sure if they make them that small, but worth a look...    ( i was bored so i actually just looked it up for you)    Also, I'm sure at Dick's or Sports Authority (or whatever sports store) you can find some generic, I doubt you wanna spend 50 bucks on something he'll grow out of in a few months!|`|VWvI5RyBaa	In Canada, they sell thermal underwears for adults and for kids.  They're commonly called long johns.  They make them feminine for girls and very masculine for boys.  Where I live, it's definitely a must.  It's hard to find them at this time of the year, they're usually all sold in October and November.  However, if you have a catalogue, you might be able to order them.  They must have them in sport stores.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Stop putting tights on him. He's a boy for goodness sake!   My son is going to be 2 soon and I've NEVER had to put anything under his pants to keep him warm other than a simple pair of socks.   If he isn't all ready he will be getting teased horribly by other boys for this- even at preschool age. You don't want him excluded and called "girl" because of this do you?  If it's really cold where you live get some thermal long john pants to wear underneath on really cold days but not tights...|`|ogDi5xXxaa	If you live in a cool place, which it sounds like you do, try sweatpants with the insulation in them.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Do your some a favor and get him some LONG JOHNS.    Men do wear tights though.|`|AA11920812	They have something called Baby Legs for boys. Like leg warmers only in patterns that are very boyish (flames, skulls, stripes, argyle, etc.). Those could go under any pants for added warmth. For older boys...    They have thermals available at Cabellas and different sporting goods stores. That would seem like the most logical. Other than layering :))|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Long johns "long underwear" under the jeans :)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	um.. i wouldn't have ever let my son wear tights. put him in pants! that will keep his legs warm. i have a 2 year old son and he has never worn tights.. just pants...|`|BypjotRpaa	i leave his jammie pants on and throw a pair of jeans over them|`|pMKaf73kaa	I made them wear sweatpants inside their jeans. But then again, my kids are always hot and sweaty because they're always running that they don't really need or want sweatpants under their jeans. I never had once put them on tights whether they were just babies or what. Thermal underwears are more comfy, more warmer than girls tights anyway..    Some stores sell jeans with warm fleece that is already stitch in. I got mine at Gap Baby/Kids, sometimes in Old Navy.|`|HB38sMkfaa	baby legs makes legwarmers for boys in boyish prints blacks,blues,browns,flames and skulls...i think they would be more appropriate for a smaller boy say under 3.    long tube socks would work some that go to the knees.dont go any higher otherwise you have a boy wearing thigh highs. heh    i would look for the smallers pair of under armour i could find.that stuff is great. my nephews wear it for football and one of them is pretty small.if your crafty at all you could easily alter them to fit your son if you cant find a size small enough.its a bit on the pricey side but worth it because its not bulky like wearing fleece or regular sweatpants. i have under armour pants i wear under yoga pants.    old navy sells jeans/khakis with fleece lining. you could easily make your own by sewing fleece into any pair of pants.its really easy.you can find tutorials online|`|gE5Dwrctaa	long john thermal pants are better than tights, so why not? they are a bit more manly too. :)|`|4hsBaBKOaa	Try football socks, they are as warm as tights but not at embarrassing for a school boy, they are easier too, you don't have to take off lots of layers to go for a wee.|`|96c1fdd2ec46193779a7d841d0176878aa	I am a single father with two boys, ages 5 and 7. They never complain, bless their hearts, about their legs being cold. However, I usually put them in thermal underwear, and then their adjustable waist pants. There are alternatives. At Target, they sell two-piece pajamas that are made of fleece. I have sometimes put those fleece PJ pants on them under their school pants. Either way, the only complaints I get are about how uncomfortable all of those options are. :) They would rather just wear normal pants.   Seriously, their "core" just needs to stay warm. So thermal shirts are a must. Leg thermals are optional.
AA12145826	We started taking our daughter when she was 11 months old and have had a family membership ever since. We go about 10-15 times a year (spread throughout the winter, spring, summer & fall) and its nice to have the freedom to go for a couple of hours and leave without feeling like you didn't get your money's worth.    Her absolute favorite exhibit is the aquarium. When she was 11 months old, we took her in and I sat with her up against the glass so that she could see all the swirling colors of fish, she's been hooked ever since. She couldn't really see any of the other exhibits very well at the time, so I think that's why this became her favorite. Plus it had LOTS of colors going on.    I would have taken her sooner had I thought about it. The only reason why we waited until she was 11 months old was because we got free admission through my company I was working for at the time.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My youngest went for the 1st time when he was 3 or 4 weeks old.  It was for our 3 year old and the baby slept the entire time while I wore and fed him.    He went again this past weekend (11 months old) and LOVED it!!!  Every bird was a "duck" and almost every animal was a "cat" according to him.  It was so cute!!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Our son was about 5 days old (yes, 5 days).  My mother in law thought it would be fun to go to the zoo just 3 days after I was released from the hospital and stupidly I said yes because I didn't want to upset her.  Golly bun was I sore when it was all over with!  My son had no clue what was going on and slept for most of the trip.    Our daughter was about 4 months old when we took her for the first time.  She enjoyed the colors of the aquarium part, but otherwise she slept.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	My daughter was 18 months when i first took her.|`|J4W68owgaa	My son was 9 months the first time I brought him and he more enjoyed the stroller ride (he has an older sister, which is why we went..lol)    If I took him now, he'd be in hog heaven. He's 15 months. He loves to look at the animals at the pet store, so I'm sure the zoo would be great fun for him.    Even if your baby doesn't enjoy the animals, they will enjoy a nice walk on the paths and they will enjoy the sounds.|`|KHZLPldraa	We live close to a zoo and have been takign her since she was about 10 months old.

It was kind of cool because she was big enough to tell me what she thought of things. But she was scared of the petting zoo and not ready yet for the part where you feed the parakeets. ... Her favorite parts were the elephants and the sand box.    For how old is old enough to enjoy it ... I'd say around 12 - 18 months. (That answer based on taking my cousins' 3 kids.)|`|0ut03ifBaa	Georgia was 2 and it was great as she was old enough to understand and she was able to say things like dol-phinn and lion etc and make the animal noises.   I took Charlee when she was 11months, i took her when she was alot youunger so Georgia was also young enough to enjoy it ( Georgia was 8) and Charlee fell asleep and was really scared of the animals and she screamed and cried alot as she was teething and Georgia was really bored by midday as she had whizzed round and seen the animals. It was a total disaster but i took Charlee back when she was almost 3 and it was really good as i didn't have to constantly carry her and she really enjoyed it, I recomend between 2 and 3!|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	Really any baby old enough to be outdoors would enjoy it, but wont remember it.

And pray to God.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Oh, my God, now you have me worried!!

Hahah it'll probably turn out that it was just the face forming that the doc saw or something because he was off on the dates or something!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	my sisters last son, they told her had a 45% chance of Down Syndrome, and a 70% chance of Hydroencephilitis. Also told her he had cysts on his brain, at the 22 week ultrasound. She had month and weekly ultrasounds, and though the chance percentages went down they never went away. In Feb they have 4 doctors in the room with us during his delivery. Surprise he was a totally healthy happy, normal 9 lb baby boy who has excelled in his class and want to advance him now, he is 7 years old.    To add my own experience, I am 33 weeks today with my 2nd daughter, a few weeks ago they couldnt get good angles of her Heart on the ultrasound. They cautioned and warned me she may not have all 4 chambers of the heart fully developed and may need emergency surgery if that was the case, at the next ultrasound they checked again and she had all 4 there and was very well developed and healthy. I truly believe they cant really see well on those things. A shadow or something that gets in the way could distort the picture, the angle your baby is laying and the time of the development all play a part in those things. I am now going through weekly Bio-scans to determine the growth rate of my daughter since I have had early and false labor since 28 weeks. Everything seems fine and dandy.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	I haven't had that in a pregnancy, however, I have had a cyst before.  Understanding that a cyst is just a little bag with a fluid material, and that historically, they are easily ruptured, and that in this condition, your doctor is right, and they most of the time do go down, that by worrying so much, you can cause more harm to the baby, than the POSSIBILITY of a cyst.  Also, look at a picture of how small the baby is at this point, and realize that what he's looking at is probably about as large as Lincoln's head on a penny or smaller.  Relax, and go to your appointment in a few weeks.  Many prayers sent your way from all of us here.|`|tht0DrHsaa	I'm sorry I haven't heard of that happening.  Just try to not worry and stay positive.  I'm sure thing will be just fine.  Good luck.

JP2h62qiaa	Of coarse call her doctor to see what they think too, but  It can be from teething. My cousins baby got diaper rash really bad to where it bled.  You should use ONLY a wash cloth with water when cleaning her down there until she is better. The wipes have stuff in them that sting, even if they say alcohol/Fragrance free.  I still Swear by using The overnight desitin in the Purple tube. IT contains 40% zinc oxide. That is a lot of moister barrier. Apply it like icing on a cup cake.   Definitely let her play around for a 1/2 hour with no diaper after cleaning her with a wet cloth. Then after that when she is all dry after playing pant less, ice up her bottom with that desitin and put on her diaper.  I used receiving blankets for a couple of days once. I folded him blanket and sat him on it and then tucked it between his legs to catch any pee. Lot's of laundry those days but his bottom dried out. then I went back to diapers.       You can also order this stuff called Resinol. You just ask your local pharmacy to get it. I don't know much about it other than it is REALLY old and it is pink colored. A thick paste. My aunt swears by it though.     I hope she gets better.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	take her back to the dr today.|`|AA11768256	have you tried changing diaper brands? My daughter had a mysterious rash the whole time I used Pampers brand diapers. They are slightly scented and it turns out she has allergies to perfumes and dyes. Her rash cleared up within a week of switching to Huggies brand. In the meantime definitely take her to the doctor, it sounds painful.|`|BypjotRpaa	i would take her back to the doctor..also when a rash starts, do not use any wipes, they are irritating. use damp paper towels to clean, let her air dry as long as possible, apply a thin layer of any diaper rash cream with zinc oxide in it and then glob on vaseline for a barrier... repeat for every diaper change|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I would call the doctor and ask. Chances are its from the same diaper rash. My son had a rash that started to bleed. Doctor told us to stop using wipes for a bit and use a wash cloth with warm water on it. We also used used regular Butt Paste and it cleared up in a few days. We also changed his diapers to the Swaddlers Sensative. He also now uses Pampers Sensative wipes and since then hasn't had a diaper rash.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	boudreaux's butt paste works good.  Also Lasinoh cream that is used for cracked nipples works good, it comes in a purple tub. One more thing is grapefruit seed extract is good for the yeast, my pedi gave me nystain cream for yeast infection diaper rash but it never helped.  You can find Grapefruit seed extract at any health-food store or online!|`|EGD8CRPKaa	No you need to go back to the doctor. Anytime the rash breaks open and bleeds it is extremely painful and needs to be evaluated. She could also develop impetigo as a secondary infection.  Please schedule an appointment soon.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	It could be from teething, My brotherr always broke out when he was cutting teeth.    Take her back to the doctor, she might be able to give you different medication.    to be honest I give mmy little guy a few minutes to air out.  My doctor also told me not to use the diaper rash creams unless I started to see a rash. which srprised me because when I had my other 2 (7 years ago) they said to use it all the time. I use regualar papers diapers and wipes with NO SCENT or perfumes (generic)    Hope you get in under control.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	You should consult baby's doctor.

UUpsa35Daa	There's the changing classes, and teachers, homeroom...the homework will increase and it'll be a little bit harder. That's the obvious.    The girls are at a point where they want to act cool and grown up. They tend to act snobby and like they're all that and everything. They can be cruel at times. The boys are going to start looking more at how a girl looks so that will be a little added pressure.    In the time that you have left before she starts, talk to her about being herself always...to not listen to the mean things that are said and to not involve herself with people that drama follows. Make sure she knows that she needs to treat others as she would like to be treated. To be nice, respectful and trustworthy. Make sure to keep the lines of communication open between the two of you throughout the years.    That's the best advice i got from anyone. I ended up being friends with everyone starting in middle school. No matter what clique or grade, i talked to, hung out, and helped every one. It's all about keeping an open mind and not letting things get to you.
10cdf10f848ef9d1de57ac51286432d6aa	you have had a lot of flack here. not every father is a good father...and i agree that sometimes you have to put yourself and the children first in order to have a peaceful and settled life.    this is fact ... your ex cannot stop you moving, what he can do is petition the court to stop you moving the children. Your options then if he is successful are staying put, or leaving the children with him.    the court will ask you to state the reasons and the provisions you have made for moving.he will also have to state why he doesn't think they should go. they may also want to do an assessment with both parents with the children and will likely suggest mediation so you can come to the decision together. they will expect you to share in the transportation of the children.    as contact will not be altered i doubt your ex even has a case. and it of course depends if he decides to fight you through the courts. you actually don't have to do anything except state your intention to move and leave the ball in his court.it is doubtful he will win, as the children will have a much stronger attachment to you and you have always been their primary care giver. he has also never shown an interest in major events like schooling.    its worth noting to all the people who have slated you that not all fathers have the children's best interests at heart and many men will do anything to exert control over their ex wives, including using the children. they can make the lives of the mother so miserable that it can be extremely detrimental to the children.    i went through all this 3 years ago and my ex took me to court for custody and lost, his contact was going to be drastically reduced. he has since not bothered to even see his children (if they aren't there at his convenience and with someone else doing all the running around for him, if he had to put the effort in himself, he didn't want to know)...proving in my mind though i knew all along it was always about trying to control me rather than any great love for his children.    good luck to you...as long as in your own heart you know your not doing it out of spite, but for the best reasons for your family unit you will be ok.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	This kind of thing should be spelled out in your custody agreement.      My husband had joint custody with his ex, never missed a minute of his regular parenting time.  Ex decided to move 7 hours away without telling him.  We ended up having to take it to court.     My stepdaughter now lives with us full time.      Do what's right for your children.  Honor your responsibility, your commitment to raise them with their father, according to your parenting agreement.  You'll have plenty of time to do what you want to do after they are grown.  Childhood flies by quickly (too quickly, really).|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Im pretty sure theres also something in your court order that states you cannot move without the fathers consent. 180 miles isnt a hop, skip and a jump. Thats a good distance. I assume your children will also change school systems too? You wont be able to do this without the fathers consent. And most fathers, GOOD fathers, wont let you move those children all that easily!     I know its probably not what you wanted to hear. But at least be proud you have a good father to your kids! I mean, how would you feel if he had custody and moved 180 miles away? Would YOU be okay with that??    If you don't mind me asking, what is your reason for moving??|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Why do you think its alright to move the kids away from their dad. Is he abusive or something?|`|AkFag8tNaa	Other arrangements can be made. I was facing a similar situation about 6 years ago and we made an agreement (I didn't end up moving) to have allotted time set aside and we would each have to travel equal distances to deliver and pick up.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	You absolutely need to tell your ex of your intent to move.  It could very well be that you cannot move that far away without his consent.|`|uP08b6K4aa	I think you're doing a lot more than some estranged parents would do and for that I take my hat off to you considering (from what you've said) he makes little effort to communicate with them.    I can't see that there will be a problem with the court OR your ex if I'm honest, the court will see that you're maintaining contact between your ex and the children and that will be enough.  If it was a case of the children having to travel for hours at a time for one day then it would be a different case altogether as this would clearly affect them and impinge on the time they spend with their father.    In short, I see no reason why you cannot move and I wish you luck with it.  You're right in that if you're happy the kids will be happy, and if that means moving closer to your family or to somewhere you can call home, then so be it.    Good Luck x|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I am sure this isn't what your children would want and it isn't the best thing for them either.  I think you will have to go back to court to re-negotiate.|`|AA11104372	Yes.  Your kids need their dad.  Don't move.|`|AA11404742	Look at the divorce decree you got when you settled the divorce.  It may say what your responsibilities are in this matter.|`|sgMno1PRaa	Dont do it, i was in care and my mum moved away 200 miles away and now i never see her.  People make promises but in the end things always fall threw  You could move away and promise that contact was still arranged every over week by meeting half way or something - but come on, its gonna be extra effort - also what happens when the children are older and want to spend the odd night with there dad, or they have an arguement with you or there siblings and just need some space, they need their dad.   Dont be selfish  And i no you said that it every 2 weeks was planned by the court but as your children get older they are not gonna want to follow the court and they are gonna want to see there dad whenever they want to!!     Sorry but I come from a family, where family is never family for long - people need connections and not just one person at that!      Ok Please do not put the man you met online before your children!! Omg this is exactly what my mum did she met him moved 200 miles away and now i never get to see my brothers or sisters!!!!   My mum regrets it and has to deal with my brother and sister being upset about nto seeing me all the time!!  It wil be the same!!|`|JkwsGu8vaa	I see my dad every 2 weeks and I personally would not want to move that far away from my dad but its what the kids think so youll have to ask them rather than us (Y) Good luck|`|BUCwZYnzaa	i say go for it. it is hard to be a good mom when you are under pressure and stress. if this move is better for you then it is better for your kids. and if you are willing to drive 60 miles every 2 weeks so they can see their dad then go for it. YOU DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU because what is best for you is best for your kids. good luck and God bless|`|GnXfEdegaa	I would think it depends what is written up in your custody papers.  Or you will have to go back to court to change things. They need their Dad, and the court will mandate that, right?|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Not unless it says so in the papers. You will have to meet half way though. Or maybe he picks them up and then you get them from his house.
OxFV92hJaa	Should be their parents. Always. However, many times in many households the parents simply aren't fit to be called role models, then the kids start looking elsewhere, and that's where subsequent problems come into play! Simple as that.     Bottom line it should always be their parents.|`|MOeToR1Xaa	I think Selena Gomez for a girl and maybe michael phelps for boys|`|BUCwZYnzaa	michael phelps is my hero but an adult who is a good person and has a strong relationship with God.|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	The first person they should look to in life should be the Lord, Jesus Christ.     If a child was blessed with godly parents, then the parents should definitely be the role models. A child can never have a better role model above their godly parents.     Besides God and parents, I believe the parents should be responsible for guiding their children to look at others that they (the parents) find to be good for the children to see and know.     For example . . . If the child has an uncle who is genuine, honest, and full of integrity, the parents should encourage that relationship between the uncle and kids. If the children's grandma is kind, loving, wholesome, and is full of knowledge and wisdom, the parents should encourage that relationship for their children.|`|YfjmTrDHaa	michael phelps|`|wHOQXToHaa	I agree with Tinkerbell- YOU are!|`|azrKULHSaa	Obama'    sincerely, shadrock!|`|GnXfEdegaa	Tops: The same sex parent (if they are a good one)|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Responsible adults who are actively in their lives, behaving honorably & living joyously.|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you're talking generically, anyone who does the right thing.

79eRDIbXaa	If you have had no bleeding then that's a good sign - go to the doctors and ask to have an early scan to check the heartbeat and see if the baby is ok. Good Luck x|`|CIZjK2rAaa	You should go to the doctor.  They can do some blood work and possibly an ultrasound if you are 6 weeks or more.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	If you just found out your pregnant.. and I hope you're not one of those women who finds out at 5 months or something silly like that... you are most likely under 3 months I hope.. and if that's the case, your baby will still be behind your pelvic bone and quite protected. So unless you had the most unbelievable blow to your abdomen, your baby is probably fine.   I am 8 weeks pregnant and I still get these little pains/cramps... apparently, according to my doc, they are normal if they are mild and not one one specific side of the body. SO, don't worry, just go to the doc and get a checkup. You're probably fine as well as baby.|`|627pWyVkaa	You could.......But it also depends if you werent that pregnant, its possible there wasnt enough trama to that area to cause a miscarriage, however if you start having bleeding or constant pain you may want to get an ultra sound to check out earlier|`|zuZKj3xXaa	take another pregnancy test....then go to the doctor, idk whats up with your pains your having..i think everything's ok :) if you arent bleeding.. id say y our Just fine :) congrats!! lol i fell thru the a weak spot on the floor in our trailer, and im Fine.. baby is ok.. just as long as you dont fall on your tummy...or hit REALLY hard..    36 weeks and 4 days pregnant!
dPmK83UYaa	i do believe it because many words we learn are words we learned by seeing a picture and then associate it w/ the word. Its the same thing. Sight reading. There's this one article about how we can read words even if the letters are mixed up in the middle because we read mostly by memory, that's unless the word is new to us and we have to sound it out or something.     So yes I believe it|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Nah. At best, it's "Your Baby Has Learned To Recognise A Few Word Shapes".     Get your god-daughter some good baby/toddler books and spend time reading them with her.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I've seen those and i am personally going to get it. They talked about it on that show The Doctors and said it was a good program if you used it as instructed. I also asked one of my child psychology teachers about it and he said it seemed to be worth a try. I'm sure going give it a go i mean hey it can't hurt and even if it doesn't help as young as they say eventually it'll come in handy.
U88rfR3Jaa	Congratulations!!!!     No, Clomid does not cause false positives on HPT's. The only test that it can cause false positives on is ovulation tests, but only if you take the ovulation test like 1 or 2 days after your last dose of Clomid. The only thing that turns a HPT positive is pregnancy hormones!!! So, you are pregnant!! Congrats!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no it cant, it can only make you ovulate, and often more than one egg, if you got a positive, it means you are pregnant|`|KV7OGaJbaa	No, clomid doesn't give false positives, it doesn't contain the pregnancy hormone that the HPT is looking for, but does contain other hormones to stimulate ovulation. I'd say if you got a faint positive then it's a positive! Test again in a few days but I'm gonna say congratulations!|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	No WAY Hun!!!! I think you just got your BFP!!! If you read the results in the right time frame, then you are pregnant. Just take another test with tomorrow morning first urine of the day.

Au tiers-monde je veux bien, ?a peut aider à éviter de manger des trucs pas folichons et préserver les enfants, mais en Europe ce n'est pas une excuse.<br>  Elle aurait d? depuis longtemps remplacer le sein par des calins je trouve, la relation doit s'établir autrement.<br>  Quant à celui qui parle de 12 ans, c'est carrément écoeurant, mêler allaitement et début des interrogation sexuelles, c'est un cocktail explosif, bonjour le manque de repères...<br>  Bref, elle fait ce qu'elle veut, mais si jamais elle a des problèmes relationnels plus tard avec son fils (ce qui ne veut absolument pas dire qu'elle en aura), faudra pas chercher plus loin, elle ne veut pas le voir grandir, faut savoir couper le cordon...|`|aBHtygCOaa	Oui. Je serais extrémement mal à l'aise de faire cela. Ma fille a 4 ans et me dit souvent qu'elle a hate d'avoir de gros seins!! Alors si je l'allaitais......bizarre, oui!!<br>  Et puis, autant je n'aime pas trop qu'un femme (ou un homme) parle du c?té sexuel du sein pour allaiter, autant la à 5 ans, je trouve que le coté sexuel du sein est vraiment la, ce n'est plus du tout un bébé mais un enfant qui comprend très très bien les différences entre les sexes. Alors, en plus, si c'est un gar?on, avec l'oedipe, ?a n'arrange rien.<br>  Enfin, si certaines aiment, après tout, ?a peut leur faire que du bien.<br>  <br>  @india: 12 ans????

Seulement on é dans un pays d'égocentriste qui pretendent avoir la science infuse. Désolé mais nos société mettrais moins d'enfants perturbé au monde si elle été moins penché sur son nombril.

Un lien maternel aussi intime à cet age entre en contradiction avec l'évolution personnelle de l'enfant.<br>  <br>  Dès 2 ans, un enfant es capable de différencier sa personne par rapport aux autres, cette période va de pair avec un relachement progressif de l'attachement maternel. C'est non seulement naturel mais nécessaire pour l'épanouissement et la construction de l'enfant en tant qu'être.<br>  <br>  Il est urgent de penser à consulter un psychologue dans un cas aussi extrême avant de faire trop de dégats irréversibles dans la construction subjective de l'enfant. Il en va de son futur en tant qu'être social.|`|l6WtCGIoaa	ca dois etre une sacré vache !!!

79eRDIbXaa	Try looking in catalogues - they do lots of themes rooms. x|`|r52rfBkeaa	http://www.sportskids.com/superstore/Bas...    http://www.familybedding.com/themes/bask...    Another suggestion is to go with a bedding set that is the combo sports, but make all of the other decorations in the room (i.e. lamp, wall decor, trash can, rug, etc.) basketball.|`|em8A42Bqaa	You may have to shop at separate places.  Target and Ebay worked for me.  If you cant find one complete set of something you may have to mix and match to find what you need.|`|10mOwk0Taa	You could choose your favorite team and go with that, or just go to the fabric store and get basketball fabric and make your own sheets/curtains/etc.  If you know how to sew, its really easy.  if you don't know how, ask someone who does know how if they'll do it as a gift for your baby shower if you supply all the materials.  Good luck!|`|hSJnaysiaa	You could make your own...I wasn't impressed with all the bedding sets the stores had to offer for boys...too lame, we wanted something more contemporary/modern, not tugboats and trains (which it all seems to be). So my grandma and I are making the nursery set. Its blues and browns. We are doing a bumper, quilt, bedskirt, throw pillow, valance, and hamper liner. Another benefit of this is you can get extra fabric and cover picture frames or make wall hangings too, which I plan to do.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Look on ebay or other sites for "wall murals."  I recently discovered them and bought some for my nursery.  They are so cool, come in any pattern or theme and can be easily applied and removed.  I love them!!|`|hT1bVVFraa	We had the same problem with our nursery for our little girl (except of course we didn't want basketballs). What you could do is go to random stores and look for all things basketball related, maybe babies r us has a basketball lamp and target has a basketball wall hanging. It takes a lot longer to find what you are looking for but keep your eyes open every time you go shopping and try new and different stores. The crib sheets or bumpers can just be solid colored  (you will be changing and washing them so much anyway) and the end result will be something much more unique than the generic crib-in-a-bag sets.
oXzHvsBpaa	Inductions can be dangerous. It sends the body into labor when the body isn't ready yet. It is also dangerous for the baby. I was induced at 38 weeks. I had to be because of pre-eclampsia and the night before the induction my blood pressure was 159/112 which is very high.I had a 40 hour labor and lots of pain. Two rounds of pain killers and an epidural. The pain killers caused my sons heart rate to drop from about 160 to 110 which they had to put me on oxygen for 24 hours. The pitocin they gave me also caused violent shivers in me. I had no control over them it was horrible.    If I had the choice I would have waited to go into natural labor but I had to be induced.|`|MtC3CWZraa	You're having it just for the heck of it and not for a medical reason?     As long as you're ok with it, I don't see why anyone else's opinion matters. You should just thank them for their input and remind them that this is a private decision between you and your doc.     As far as health reasons go, I don't see an issue. I just personally wouldn't choose it since contractions from an induction tend to be more acute than those that occur naturally.  It tends to be more painful, but if you planned on getting pain meds anyway, that wouldn't be a big deal.|`|nrQijvMuaa	I was Induced at 38 weeks with my first born. Everything came out fine. Of Course the Petocin medication is a 8itch but it's all good after the epidural is in effect! LOL Congrats|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I too was induced by choice at 39 weeks.  I had a wonderful experience.  Everything was planned and went very smoothly and my labor/delivery was excellent.  I got a lot of snide remarks and looks when I told people I was being induced.  But I talked with my doctor and I most definitely wanted him to be there to deliver my daughter, because he had been my doctor the whole time and I trusted him.  I went in at midnight and had my daughter at 2:48pm the next day.  If you are getting induced with pitocin (the drug they use to start the contractions) make sure you get your epidural early enough.  I had to wait for mine and those contractions were horrible for about an hour, but once I got the epidural everything was nice and pain free and such a wonderful experience.  Good Luck!|`|QoenvlFuaa	If I were in your position, I would not induce. But I can only say that now that I know what I know and have done what I've done. I was induced too. I thought I needed to be induced, my doctor told me it was best, so I went for it. My labor and delivery did not go as I had planned (natural birth). The contractions came on hard and close (no rest between) and I needed an epidural. Then I ended up with a C/S. Unless there is medical necessity (maybe high blood pressure or something like that), I wouldn't induce. Do a little research on inductions (google will give you plenty of results) and get as much info as you can, then make your decision.    Good luck and congrats on your little one!|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	Is there a medical reason for the induction or is your OB being nice and trying to alleviate a tired pregnant woman early?  Induction really should only be used when there is a medical reason like a huge 10 pound baby, gestational diabetes, toxemia or something like that. I wouldn't schedule an induction unless there is a reason like that. The reason being your baby will come out when he/she is ready. Most practitioners don't induce until 41 or 42 weeks because your body should start labor before then on its own.  If you want to have the baby at 39 weeks then go for it, but I would suggest trying natural induction methods that you can try at home that are safe. Try walking for half hour a day, that gets the baby into perfect position for delivery and will help to drop and engage well into the pelvis. Try red raspberry tea leaf or cumin tea (1 tbs with boiling water, a cube of potato to sit at the bottom of your tea cup and honey/sugar to sweeten the bitter taste), sex with semen to soften and ripen the cervix. There is plenty of natural ways you can help get labor going without using a medical induction  Medical induction often has a LONG (like up to 48 hours) labor that is more painful and intense that a natural labor that starts on its own.  Before you agree to induction try those|`|3VU38jizaa	Neat! I am 37 weeks and I have a scheduled section for Feb. 17th!  I don't see a problem with being induced at 39 weeks if your OBGYN is up for it. The baby is fully mature by then and more than ready to come out. My OBGYN induced me with my first at 39 weeks and everything went really well. He used some gel which helped my cervix begin to dilate and then my water broke. I was then given some pitocin to speed things up and I had a fantastic labor...it was very easy and the contractions were quite tolerable. A lot of women will tell you that induction can result in really harsh, horrible labor but I never experienced that. I have a friend who was also induced at 37 weeks and she said the same. Things went very quickly and very well for her.   Your OBGYN wouldn't put your body through something it isn't ready for. He must have checked you and felt that things were ripe and ready down there.   Good luck!|`|0aVHTRAEaa	I was 39 weeks when my doctor induced.  I just had my baby on Dec 8, 2008.  I arrived at the hospital at 7:30 was checked in and in a room by 8:30 induced by 9:00, epidural by 10:30, baby born at 5:14 that afternoon.....no problems!
U55NCXmUaa	i hate reading insurance terms also - it's always such a headache.  find out from the fertility doctor if they're in-network or out-of-network.  we're going to a doctor that's in-network so they covered 90% of fees - when we tried to switch to another doctor, he was out-of-network, which meant that he was 70% covered.  the doctor himself wanted everything paid up front, but who has $10k just laying around to shell out, right?  even though they can bill insurance, we still have to pay up front, submit claims, then get reimbursed by insurance.      so if you can, find out from your insurance what percentage they'll cover and whether or not they're in-network or out-of-network.  then find out from your doctor how much they charge for procedures and what their payment terms are.  as for your insurance terms, it doesn't look like they'll cover IUIs (artificial insemination) or IVF (in vitro).  you may also want to find out from your insurance company what % they cover for medications, because it really does add up ($4k+ for IVF).    hope this helps!  good luck!|`|G2auAv1Saa	Call your doctors office and verify with them any payment you will need to make. The insurance company decides if it is covered by using codes to determine the procedure and diagnosis. Your doctors office will be able to call and verify that the particular codes they are using  will be covered and at what percentage.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well it doesnt cover a whole lot. It says it covers tests to determine whether you're infertile or not, surgery in case it is needed to help with the infertility, and injections.    That's it.    In vitro is not covered,Artifical insemination is not covered and anything before or after those procedures.    It also doesnt cover transexual surgery LOL -sorry just trying to cheer you up a bit ;)    And to be paid of course you need to be under coverage when you start the procedures and then you gotta submit stuff to your insurance.    Hope I helped!! Good Luck and blessings!
b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Interesting question. I don't think so. The only thing I can think of is if the surrogate mom listened to a particular type of music throughout the pregnancy- the baby may show a preference for it later. (Even brand new babies show a preference for the songs they were sung in utero). Also, if mom ate particular foods, maybe the preference would be passed on (babies can taste changes in the amniotic fluid- if mom drinks something strange or bitter, a baby will show his or her displeasure on the ultrasound.) Or if a particular noise or situation or voice caused the surrogate stress- the baby might pick up on that.    As far as mannerisms and facial features go- no, I think that would be impossible unless the surrogate ate a very poor diet, abused drugs or drank heavily. Then the child may have defects or facial features (like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) that could be blamed on the surrogate- but that's the only thing I can think of :)|`|pKr77Vqiaa	YES IT WILL..|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I don't see how that would be possible.  It isn't like they are being raised by the surrogate.  They say the baby can recognize your voice when you are pregnant but it takes about a week after birth for him to recognize you after birth.  As long as you are there from the time he comes out, he will start bonding with you right away.
sC0NvRzEaa	Ok, Im not a teen, but my situation was like this: I got married to a hispanic man at 19, my mom hated him because he wasn't the white dr that she wanted me to marry.

U55NCXmUaa	you should definitely talk to a fertility doctor about this.  my husband has something similar to this so we've been using ICSI during our ivf cycles (where they take one sperm and inject it directly into the egg).  until our next cycle, he's doing acupuncture and taking "fertility blend for men" - which has vitamins/herbs to help with sperm issues.  he's also been instructed by our acupuncturist to eat more red meat and to not do heavy weights at the gym.|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hi Joanne,      More than 50% of all infertility problems experienced by couples are caused by male infertility. Having a low sperm count can be a devastating problem for a man and can bring a lot of stress into even the most stable of relationships. There are many different factors which could be responsible for a low sperm count. In your fiance case, actually there are simple ways to do to cope with his low sperm count.    Among all concerned about how to increase sperm count, one thing is sure that to produce healthy and adequate sperms, the overall health should be perfect. Your fiance should adopt nutrients/foods that help him attaining stronger, healthier ejaculations. The foods that boost testosterone may help increasing the sperm count. The dietary supplements that help raising semen volume level are also thought to increase sperm count:    Zinc is vital for viable sperm count, motility and a high percentage of live sperm in the semen. Zinc is present in semen and therefore men can lose excessive quantities of zinc through ejaculation - therefore it is critical that zinc is replaced through the diet daily. Foods rich in zinc such as lambs, turkeys, barley, wheat, oysters, beans, nuts, red meats, raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds are considered to be the super-foods that can help to increase the sperm count in men.    Vitamins C, E and especially B12 possess antioxidant properties and are thought to increase sperm production. L-arginine, L-cartinine (amino acids) those are found abundantly in spinach, seaweed (Spirulina), poultry and also in sesame seeds, tuna, turkeys, egg whites are thought to energize the sperms and also to increase their production without affecting any other body system.    There are also foods your fiance should avoid. More about them on source articles.|`|4DoXomHZaa	There isn't a whole lot they can do....normally when low count and moTility occurs after reversal, it means that the channel in the vas has scarred over partially, and only old and dying sperm get thru. Or, the hay have had a blow out in the epididymis they missed on one side and no sperm gets to the vas on that side.    Some docs try Prednisone to reduce swelling, but at this late stage in the game it's not likely to help.    Redo operations are possible and the success rates aren't too much lower then 1st ops.    If his counts are low but not too low, some fertility clinics can freeze multiple semen samples, freeze them, and combine them into one good sample for IUI. They say 3-4 IUIs is not uncommon to have success.      IVF may work for you...it's about $15000 the first month tho. They aspirate sperm from him with a needle, drill your ovaries to get eggs after you take fertilty drugs. They combine these in a petri dish and implant the embryos into your womb. There is an increased risk of multiples and of course the decision must be made as to what should be done with any left over children....donate them, sell them, throw them away.|`|yB8djbeNaa	have a healthier diet lots of fruit and veg and pre natual vitamins for the guys|`|AA12064370	Well first I would suggest he find out if there is a serious cause of his count being low etc. Find out if there is any meds he can take to help with the low count and mobility. Also another option would be invetro where they would freeze his sperm and implant it into you. That way it is still a baby from both of you using both of your genes. Good luck!|`|be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	The doctor should have told you that IVF is almost always required after a vasectomy reversal.  Sorry to tell you that.    Unfortunately most doctors in that business are not very ethical, and just want your money.

She can use them for 1-20 years and as long as she hasn't gone through menopause or has other problems, she can get pregnant just the same once she goes off of them.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	They prevent pregnancy while she is on them.  As soon as she stops taking them she can get pregnant.  I got pregnant my first month off of them.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	I'm guessing you are NOT referring to birth control. Well, if she's that dumb to be taking the Plan B type pills all the time, maybe babies would be better off not having her as a mother anyway because she sounds like she has not a bone of responsibility in her body. They're not meant for that type of use so of course it would do something to her body. What the hell is wrong with people and the idea of retroactive birth control. I'm sorry, but your gf is an idiot if she's taking those pills.    But if it's just birth control, yes she'll absolutely be able to conceive down the road.|`|yB8djbeNaa	if you mean the pill which is a form of contreceptive then yes she can get pregnant in the future when she stops taking them|`|G94NlpZ0aa	Yes she can get pregnant in the future.   I took them for 3 years...and as soon as I stopped...bam.  here I am. 25 weeks pregnant.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I took oral contraceptive pills for 10years.  I stopped taking them and 2mon later I was pregnant.  Our baby is perfect.|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	If your talking about Birth Control, later when she's ready for children, she can stop taking them and get pregnant. I assume she talked to her doctor before taking these pills and knows all the background on them, you should ask her.|`|iPea0KGNaa	Its called the pill  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_or...    Its 99%, so theres only 1% chance of gettin pregnant.  She should be taking it everyday, If she misses one of she stops taking it then she can get pregnant.    If she is sick after taking the pill,, vomits or has food poisening, diarrea,  she could get pregnant.    You should really be using condoms as extra precaution if you arnt in some long term relationship/marriage.    You sound young just by asking the question and if you arnt using condoms you can catch stuff.    In the future when she stops taking the pill she can have a child if she wants...|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Birth control pills just keep her from getting pregnant while she is taking them.  I took them for 5 years and got pregnant right away when I stopped.  No worries!
lix7lvwhaa	the best things to do is tell the truth. get it off your chest. yes i mean tell you parents about it. you'll regret it later if you do not. im only 1 year older than you and i know that i have to tell the truth or else there will be consequences for me and not only that think before you do. that's the problems these days. none thinks before they act. they make the wrong decisions and it costs them, good or bad. mostly bad a lot. like other people have mentioned, i'd leave them a note or have a friend with you when you are going to confess to them. Don't get an abortion, that poor baby doesn't need to get killed because of your mistake...get an adoption that way people who cannot conceive can get a baby.You are only 13 and are too young to be able to take care of a baby. sorry hun it's the truth, im sorry. i am just 1 year older than you and heck i wouldn't be able to take care of a baby..and what are you in middle school?  be careful when you get to high school. it's much worse more pressure to have sex. so don't make the same mistake again learn from your first mistake. and know that the decisions you make can affect your life in a good/bad way, most of the time a bad way. be careful and good luck. i wish you the best of luck!!!!! :)|`|LvvHIsolaa	just tell them. it may be hard. but its better to tell them before they find out on there own. im also 13, and was pregnant, i ended up going with a friend and getting an abortion. it was the worst thing id ever done. but, its better to just get it out. trust mee.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	u dont show at 2 months|`|AA11100518	bring a friend.  or if you can't tell them, leave them a note so they can read it when you're not there.  or bring a trusted adult, or even have a trusted adult tell them (your sunday school teacher, a school counselor, a friend's mom).  you must tell them now.  you are too young to handle this by yourself.  you have to let your parents know.  tell your mom you haven't had a period or something to let her know.  you don't have to come out and say 'i'm preganant'.      your parents will be extremely upset and angry and you have to give them space to process that.  this is not what they hoped for you.  they hoped you would finish school and have an easier life than a single teen mom.  they will be very disappointed.  they will be angry that you caused this, because you are unable to be responsible (can't provide food, home, child care etc. for your child).  you have to understand that they will be extremely upset and mad at you.  you have to give them time to get through that.  you have to give them space to be upset.  this dashes all the hopes they have had for you since you were born (or so they will think).  it also means they didn't really know you or what you were doing - that you are a stranger to them and they didn't realize what your life was really like (that you were having sex).  it's tough on them.  try to understand.  don't defend yourself, just apologise and let them get through it.  might take a year or two for them to get over it.|`|nrQijvMuaa	Just tell them straight out! Let them know ASAP|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Oh wow! Try cooking them dinner and sit down as a family and just be straight forward. Who knows they might be happy to have a grand baby. I mean, I know that you are only 13 but either way you've made a great decision by keeping the baby and even if they upset at first they will be excited sooner or later. Best of luck!|`|TffCSzHxaa	Well...how about one day you write a note to your mom (She'd probably be the easiest to tell). It should say something like, "Now I need you to have an open mind about this, and not to get too mad. But I just recently found out I was pregnant. No, it's not a joke and I need you now more than ever, so please help me.". Then after you write it give it to her and then go sit on the couch and wait for her to finish reading it. She's probably going to be mad at first, but hopefully she will come around and be supportive. On a lighter note I hope you have a healthy pregnancy, and a beautiful baby!|`|JpmKtpqmaa	just tell them...or you can write a letter and put everything that needs to be said in that letter and then leave it on their bed or on the table..and then take it from there!!!|`|7N8W2FDyaa	Blurt it if you have to... its important that they know.|`|gFldqybSaa	They're not going to be happy, obviously. But, it's not like they can kick you out. You should just tell them, soon enough the better. I'm not one to suggest abortions, but you're way to young. The dangers involved with having a baby at your age, not cool.|`|onHWb6koaa	Congrats to start with. Im 17 i had my daughter when i was 16 my parents were very pissed to start with but that very typical  just get prepared for the yelling an random questions. After about my 5th month my parents got used to it they both would take off work go shopping for baby clothes my dad even painted a room when i was 7 months it all takes some getting used to now my Daughterr get moreattentionn than me an i like that my parents love her the way she love me. but since your 13 i think that you should get your baby,s father an you'll tell them together. or if you guys are not together you tell which ever parent you closer with or you think will take it the best. but you reallydon'tt have t tell them til your about 4 months well thats when i told my parents. im a senior in highschoool an im making good grades with a child your parents will be proud long as you stay in school. BE a good mother an get your education. Dont be Ashamed that a blessing from god GOOD LUCK|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	count to 3 and just say it.  if you're not planning on keeping the baby you don't have a lot of time left for an abortion.  if you're planning on keeping the baby then you need to get to the doctor and start planning properly.  just tell them.  they'll be mad at first but eventually get past it.|`|0YGI4TsEaa	you have to tell them.although you are very young you need the support of your parents and family.Write it in a note & give it to them if its 2 hard 4 you 2 tell them face 2 face
G2auAv1Saa	Did you two discuss this before you were married?   It is natural for a man to clam up and get nervous about having a child. My husband and I were married 13 years before it happened.   Ask him what his qualms are about having children. If the marriage is on the rocks he may be thinking it is not best to bring a child into it (which is probably for the best). He may not intend to hurt you, he may feel your want for a child is too strong and that you focus all your thoughts on that and ignore him. You need to talk to him and see how he feels before you bring up having a child again.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Oh goodness.  That's not good dear.   I for one would have spoken to your husband previously to getting married to see if he wanted children.      I'm bad that way!  Haha.   If they don't want kids then WELL. . . they are a no show for me.  So, you may want to sit him down and ask him, "I know you don't want kids RIGHT now, but are you EVER going to want to have kids?"  If he says, "No!"  Then say, "This marriage is over."  The whole point of marriage is two loving married individuals sharing their love with one another and bringing a child into the world.  As you know.   If he's being selfish about this. . . where will it stop?    Not to mention he's not even wanting to make love with you.  Guys need sex and if he's not having sex with you he's finding it elsewhere.  My guess is pornography.  *grumbles*   You need to have a serious discussion with him dear.  If you ever need anything please message me.  Take care!!!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Does he have reasons?Or does he just not want to?Maybe he has reasons.Try talking to him about it.|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	Talk to him about it  If he Truly love you and knows how much you want this baby then he will do this. Otherwise maybe you should find someone who wants children the same as you|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	Something could be bothering him. Also was he sure before marriage that he didn't want kids? Well sex is a part of  healthy marriage, whether baby or no baby. And since u say that he doesn'teven make love to u, that means there's more to the story than just making a baby. I can understand ur feelings sweetheart. Best thing is sit down and talk it out with him. Maybe u'll figure out the problem...|`|4DoXomHZaa	You need to sit down with him and tell him to make up his mind once and for all, and accept his answer.    Was this not talked about before marriage? It very seldomly works out for people where one wants kids and the other not.    However, if this person is playing mind games like this, are you sure you want him to father your child?    Good luck|`|cJep8NnHaa	i think you should talk to him about it. ask him why he feels the need to play with your emotions!! in such way.and once you talk  to him and nothing changes then i suggest you go find yourself a real nice man that cares and has the same feelings towards having children as yourself.|`|OzM5P1TIaa	plz wait.  just enjoy with ur husband.dont talk about it taht u want child.when u both will be happy and enjoy ur life.met with each other.u will be pregnet soon.plz be patient ok.  ur all desires will come true.  best od luck
pBVjKCJ1aa	Exactly.  I could understand it if it was back in the old days when parents were so Victorian that they never spoke about sex or periods etc., but one would think that in our enlightened age kids would find their parents more and not LESS approachable.<br>  It's really sad because if you cannot approach the person who brought you into the world and trust them, who CAN you trust?<br>  It's a bad reflection on our society.|`|CeZF4j7xaa	It's all because of the the immature(pre-matured) chit-chats in their circle. Not blaming kids, its the age, even parents would have had something similar at that age. Circumstances change but problem remains. There will be so many assumptions(presumptions) in the kids world and will quickly be judgemental. For God's sake, they are called kids because the biggies know they don't have experience to judge right so don't blame them, accept the challenge and the GROWN-UPs work on it. Remember, its matter time before the same generation will face the same situation in a different way when the next batch is out :)|`|vwCTpHi7aa	well... i'm a kid and i understand what they feel.. you see... since we were born in deifferent decades... we have different beliefs in life...  in the bf issue.... we can't talk to our moms about it if:<br>  she's against having a bf<br>  teaser.. (example: your bf is here... you're blushing-.. hahaha)<br>  she talks to much....<br>  jumps into conclusions....<br>  <br>  yeah... and it's also quite embarassing... but if you're the kind of mom who's open towards your kids... like... tryna talk to them about life.. and tryna be able to talk to them about you and sex... yes try to because it's not like they're naive or something! a 7 years old know what sex is! talk to them as early as possible before the world talks to them... get it!  it's better if you introduce sex to them in a mannered way then what his or her friends would do... and what i hate about mos are whiners... yeah... i hate it.. hehehe... so yeah.... hope you got some important things in here....:)<br>  <br>  PS<br>  it's not that we don't trust you...<br>  it's just that we don't wanna be scolded or laughed by you...<br>  we don't wanna be embarrassed... :)|`|UYjTydYjaa	I think that maybe it is a good thing? Think about the other kids you DONT ask there parents anything and just do whatever they what.(multipule piercings, tattoes,somking,drugs,etc.)These are just probaly insecure children who are going through a time period in there lives were rejection REALLY hurts and fitting in is a MAJOR thing.<br>  :)Just a positive thought!:)|`|sAERl7TZaa	My parents were really strict growing up.  We didn't have much money to go around either, so it was hard to ask for anything if I needed it.  It also depends on the personality of the kid.  She may be shy or too embarrassed about growing up.|`|5hLndcSPaa	I agree with you if a child can't ask a parent simple questions then how will they tell them about important issues in their life. Maybe the parents need to learn people skills or the children need to understand that parents are their to help them.|`|pYte8SAnaa	i too don't understand many question asked by kids on this site. being afraid to ask/and or tell their parents. i certainly do not understand about the period thing. i can understand embarrassment, but not fear.|`|pGBTHEjtaa	I can under stand the kid point if view, I had a mother that i didn't want to tell any thing. Most times you couldn't ask about personal stuff.|`|7Ogrwxo7aa	it just depends what your parents are like! Not everyone's parents are the same they could be more strict or less aproachable than others or not everyone has a close relationship with their parents|`|TBuRJVmYaa	yeah its pretty funnie|`|vGxipYJnaa	Well, as a parent, I think it's strange that a child would be scared to tell her mother that she got her period! It's a perfectly natural thing and it's not like she "did" anything!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Not all parents are open with their children, and there are many who are not comfortable speaking with their parents for this reason.  Some parents just don't encourage open communication.  I have had friends of my daughters confide in me and ask questions about normal "growing up" things that they are afraid to speak to their parents about.  Of course, I am always careful in my responses as it isn't my place to explain things their parents don't want them to know.  I encourage them to speak with their parents about these things, and have sometimes spoken with the parents about it.  In some cases, the parents just don't realize that their children have gotten to that "stage".  With regard to questions about going to the mall, makeup or getting ears pierced, I believe the askers are really looking for ways to convince parents who have said no to permit them to do what they are asking.
