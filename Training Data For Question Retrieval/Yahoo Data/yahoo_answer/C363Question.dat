My heating is almost non-existent, I have a small calor gas heater.  I live in a four bedroom house.  There is condensation on all of the windows every morning.  My house is extremely cold.  The mold has appeared on window ledges, plug sockets, walls, and ceilings.  My wife has developed a very itchy arm over the past few months, this becomes itchy at night, could this be related?  My daughter has developed eczema around her mouth, could this be related?  She also takes the cold often, with runny nose, chesty cough.     How do I get rid of the mold, I have tried cleaning with bleach where I can, this removes it temporarily.  Is there anything I can do to rid it permanently?  Any advice on this subject will be welcomed, thanks for your time.

The heat flows fine on the first floor but it doesn't flow on the second floor, yet only in the second floor's bathroom does it flow. I don't know much about heating or its control, but aside from closing a vent (which we don't even have), is it possible to shut-of the heat in different parts of the house or floors? I ask this question because I don't believe my housemate when she says "the heat doesn't work upstairs because it broke", yet it works fine in the second floor bathroom. Or maybe I just think it's broke and its turned off somehow. She tells me that if they were to fix it, the heat-bill would go higher. I don't know what to make of this, is this possible?
