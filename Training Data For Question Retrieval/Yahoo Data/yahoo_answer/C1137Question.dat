I am very pale skinned.      Can anyone give me advice on if this is possible to try out given i already have artificial colour in my hair. What should I look for in a colour. And if i dont like it, is it would it be possible to go back to golden?

Because they somehow do..     Thanks and do something nice for the environment today.

I just got my left ear spiral pierced with a 14g earring and my piercer told me how to take care of it, but he didn't mention anything about twisting it as part of the healing process. My friend mentioned that I might want to twist it to make sure the tissue doesn't "grow around" or over the earring and so that the holes don't close up around the earring. I have my ear lobes pierced as well and I know they say to twist those when you first have them pierced but anyone know about the spirals? I did actually try to twist the earring around yesterday two out of the three holes started to bleed and it hurt pretty bad so I was thinking that isn't something I'm supposed to do. Anyone know?

20090304180728AAQJzhA	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Does he still love me?	Pardon the wrong category, but there are no answers in the Singles and Dating board. I figured I'd get more help here.      My guy suggested a threesome the other day. At first, I was mildly consensual, but after thinking about it, I decided I couldn't stand the idea of seeing him with another girl, even if I was there.      When he told me about it, he said that he loves me no matter what and I'm the most important thing to him; he was just being a "guy" and wanted to have the experience. When I told him no, he didn't gripe or anything, but I still can't help but wonder.      Maybe I'm naive, but I believe that if a guy truly loves a girl, he won't need anything else. He'll move heaven and earth for her if he has to, and sex won't be just about some abstract, detached feeling of pleasure: it'll be about sharing yourself with your significant other.      What do you think? Does he really still love me (we've been together a year and a half) or is he just thinking about the sex? And what should I do about it? I'm feeling very hurt and used.

20090304194803AAL6jB7	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Which color should I get these Vans in?	So, I am already looking for back-to-school shoes for next year. I've decided I'd like to get a pair of Vans Authentic Lo Pros, but I wasn't sure what color to get. I've narrowed down my decision to two, and I am torn between them, and I need some consent from others.       http://store.thinkempire.com/gfx/product...    Black/White:    I like this color because it's retro and funky. I also haven't seen anyone wearing it, and I like that. My only concern is that the white would get dirty easily.       http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/b/0/0/9/a...    Black/Black:   These are also really interesting and I haven't seen them much, in the Lo Pro style at least. I am worried, though, because my mom told me about a suicidal gang that wore all black, including sneakers like these, when they killed themselves. That happened way before my day, but I don't want people who've heard of it to take me the wrong way. I also think they're kind of masculene, even though I could easily feminize (sp?) them.      Thanks for any (nice) feedback you guys have!      P.S. Have any of you guys owned a pair of Authentic Lo Pros? If so, are they comfortable and fit true to size compared to other Vans shoes? Thank you!

20090304203018AAW9sVV	Beauty & Style;Hair	Scene/Emo hair without bangs or long bangs?	Hi guys =]      Didn't really wanna stereotype, but that's the best way to describe it. I have dark blonde hair a bit under the shoulders, and it's pretty curly.      What I do now is I flat iron it, part it to the side, and make it appear like I have bangs by combing some hair in front of my hair, sweeping it to the side, and pinning with some bows and stuff. But it doesn't always stay in place, and sometimes it can be a pain in the *** to look just right.      I sometimes also wear colored hair extensions, since my hair is already super-damaged from the flat iron, and I don't need to damage it anymore with dyes.      So, what should I do with it? I can't cut it, my mom absolutely hates bangs, and she won't let me get them. (Don't ask why, she's crazy)      Are there any other methods to make it appear like I have bangs? I cant use much gel or hairspray either, it curls my hair up, and my hair can get oily fast also.      Are there any styles involving plenty of color, so there's less attention on whether there's bangs or not? If so, links or some description please?      Thanks guys =]

20090304204502AAPJ2D8	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What can I do to stop my favourite necklace from turning my neck green?	I have a lovely little pendant that my Grandmother gave me for my Confirmation several years ago. I've broken the original chain (It was a little too short) and rather than fix it I put it on a pretty chain that came from a jewelry making kit. The chain is made to look like antiqued gold but it isn't really.      Now the problem is that now that I've started wearing it again, the chain turns my neck this horrible greenish-grey colour. I know it probably needs to be cleaned because it wasn't worn for so long (Probably about a year since the old chain broke) but I don't have any jewelry cleaner and without knowing exactly what the chain is made of I don't want to use toothpaste on it. I avoid getting the chain wet, I don't wear it in the shower and I make sure I'm very dry before putting it back on.      How can I properly and safely clean the chain and prevent it from turning my neck green in the future?      Also, how can I get these ugly green stains off my skin? No matter how hard I scrub they won't come off!

And also I'm just into the normal,basic colors like pinks,browns and purples,but if you think that any other color like blues,greens,whatever would look nice on me,that would be great. And dont even tell me to try liquid eyeliner because I dont even know how to apply it in a straight line.=/  And guys,it would be nice if you could rate me on a scale of 1-10.

I hate short shorts and never wear them, I'm a pants & jeans  girl. I think they look kinda sluty &  i would feel exposed and like your wearing underwear. My Mom's is yelling at me today and telling me that I have problem with my sexulogy because  i never wear shorts and because females have nice legs and they should show them and besides their so much cooler & comfortable and I look riduculous be the only one wearing pants in the warm weather. All of my girlfriends changed into their short shorts,    and when I get home my Mom and sisters are wearing their short shorts and basically all of the females in my neighbor have on their short shorts. It's like some kind of cult that they all have bare legs    and because I don't want to show my legs (I  have nice legs and just don't want to show them) and why does all of my, friends, mom & sisters nag me to start wearing short shorts?

I had my cartilage pierced by a professional (with the needle) on January 31, 2009.  She never really told me when I could change the ring in my ear.

I have two lobes in each ear done and my right cartilage done.  I love the feeling of piercings (the term masochist wouldn't offend me because everyone has been calling me that after I say that my cartilage felt good and exciting more than painful) and want another, preferably a third on my left side to balance out the number of piercings on each side.      I don't really want any more ear piercings, though, and I am looking for something that won't leave a gaping hole in the event that I have to take it out for work.  I understand that all piercings leave holes because that's what a piercing is, but I'd rather have something a little bit conservative.      What all is out there?  Ideas?

Ok u no how some people say a certain product worked for them but others said it didn't yeah well i get pimples and i wanna pick out the best cleanser that suits my skin.      my skin well i am fairly pale (i dunno if that helps) i get pimples mostly my cheeks usually some on my forehead and some on my chin. the ones on my cheeks are the worst they are usually fairly big or medium and i don think they are whiteheads (cause u can't see any white). the rest of them are usually whiteheads or blackheads i think.      i cant tell what type of skin i have. I think it is most likely combination cause some times it feels sensitive sometimes oilly sometimes times dry ect......      Um so far the best ones that have worked is ones like clean and clear and maybe garnier.   U know how something works fairly good on ur skin but u think i can do better and then u keep trying stuff hoping u'll find something better. i also drink heaps of water eat healthy and exercise heaps so yeah wat do u think       THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL UR ANSWERS
