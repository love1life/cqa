20090309193635AAG2f6Z	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	For a given a and b, with gcd(a,b) = 1, what are the possible integer values for ax + by?	We stipulate gcd(a,b) = 1, otherwise we are limited to multiples of the gcd.      Is there always an m such that for n >= m, all n can be expressed in the form ax + by, with x, y >= 0 ?       For example: for a = 5, b = 7,   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, cannot be expressed as 5x + 7y   (x, y >= 0), therefore   16 cannot since 16 - 5 = 11 and 16 - 7 = 9   18 cannot since 18 - 5 = 13 and 18 - 7 = 11   23 cannot since 23 - 5 = 18 and 23 - 7 = 16   and since 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 all can be so expressed,   (2*7 + 2*5, 5*5, 3*7 + 1*5, 4*5 + 1*7, 4*7) then   adding 5's to one of those can produce all higher integers,   among other ways.      So if min(a,b)-1 consecutive integers, k, k+1, k+2, ... k+min(a,b)-1, can be so expressed, then all higher integers can as well.       How other than by trial and error can you find the maximum integer (if any) which cannot be expressed as ax + by ?  Or prove that no such maximum exists.      If we remove the restriction x, y >= 0 does that make all integers possible ?

20090309205017AAeWXDO	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Binomial probability question. Need help coming up with answer.?	Here's the question: "Yakima Air flies non-stop to various cities. Each of their planes have 24 seats. If the probability of any randomly selected person showing up is .9, and each person acts independently, how many reservations should the airline accept per flight?"      So, what I did is set up a table. Obviously, n = the number of reservations, p = .9, and q = .1.   I found mean, standard deviation, and P(x<=24) for each n:   n = 24; 21.6; 1.4697; 1.0000   n = 25; 22.5; 1.5000; .9282   n = 26; 23.4; 1.5297; .7487   n = 27; 24.3; 1.5588; .5154      I'm not sure whether the mean or P(x<=24) would be better guidelines,  or maybe there's something else.

20090309200541AAesdoB	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Can someone check my True/false answers for compact/connected sets?	Justify answers.      1. Every subset of a connected set is also connected.       FALSE. We know [0,10] is a connected set. [2, 5] U [7,9] is a subset of [0,10] but it is not connected.      2. Every non-empty set in a metric space has a connected subset.       TRUE. Let S be a nonempty set in (X,d). Since S is nonempty, there exists an element x in S. So {x} is a subset of S and {x} is connected.      3. The union of two non-empty disjoint connected sets is always connected.       FALSE. [0,1] and [2,3] are both nonempty disjoint connected sets. But, [0,1] U [2,3] is not connected.      4. The union of two nonempty disjoint connected sets is never connected.       FALSE. [0,1] and (1,2) are both nonempty disjoint connected sets but [0,1] U (1,2) = [0,2) is connected.      5. The union of two compact sets is compact.        TRUE. Let S1 be contained by the union of Oa and also by a finite subcover of Oa's. Let S2 be contained by the union of Pa and also by a finite subcover of Pa's. Then, cover S1 U S2 by the union of the unions of Oa and Pas and it will also be covered by the two finite subcovers, which is a finite subcover itself. So it is compact.      Are these correct?

So I'm fairly confident I have the answers to a problem, but I would really appreciate a double-checking.      A pulley (solid cylinder) has a mass of 5.0 kg and a radius of .6 m. It is able to lower a bucket of mass 3.0 kg. Disregarding friction, from rest, the bucket falls for 4 seconds. What is the linear acceleration of the bucket, how far does it fall, and what is the cylinder's angular acceleration?      The following are my answers (They're technically off, because my teacher has us use 10 m/s^s for g. Still, they're close enough.)      Linear Acceleration: 5.45 m/s^2   Distance: 43.6 m   Angular Acceleration: 9.08 rad/sec      I can update later to show work.   Thanks in advance.

I had signed a release form that they could use my before and after pictures when I had Cushing's Disease, a bilateral adrenalectomy due to a pituitary tumor and now I am considered adrenal insufficient..  I know that my picture was in a book for nurses because a girl brought her mom's study guide to school where I worked and showed me.  I was busy raising a family and working full time back then and didn't think to ask if I could buy the book when her mom was done with it.

20090309212814AADBF1R	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Have you or someone you know ever had a paranormal experience?	My two cousins have. They are both in their 20s. When they were in high school, they moved over to their uncle's house for a couple of months. One kept on seeing shadows when he knew there was nothing moving, and one felt like she was being choked every night. She felt hands on her throat and this would continue for hours. The loss of sleep was so unbearable that she ended up fainting frequently at school. The one who saw shadows often brought his friends over, and they kept on complaining that they heard a baby crying somewhere. When my cousins moved out, they never experienced weird activity again.      What about you? Do you or someone you know ever had a run-in with a ghost or something odd?

20090309233251AA2yR3m	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does light explain the expanding universe?	I was told light has mass.  So if light is traveling at the speed of light then its mass and energy should be infinite at the outer edges of the universe correct?  If I use E=MC2 right?  And this infinite mass and energy is what's driving (pushing) the universe and its expansion.      Also, if that is correct then there is no way the universe can collapse because there is infinite mass and energy keeping it going.  There would have to be an opposing force GREATER than infinite mass and energy to cause a collapse correct?

Question:       The scale of scores on an IQ test is approximately normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. What is the lowest value of the top 10 percent of IQs? Give your answer to 1 decimal place.      My attempt at the answer:      I think I'm supposed to read a value from the z table and plug it into this equation:      100 + z(15) = ?      I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use the z table for this problem because the wording is confusing.      Do I have to look for 0.1 in the z table? That's only 10% but the question says the top 10% so do I need to look for 0.9 on the z table?   If it's 0.9 do I use the value 1.28? It it's 0.1 do I use the value 2.32?      with 1.28 I get 119.2 (or 119) for the score and with 2.32 I get 134.8 (or 135).      I'm sure this is really easy. If someone could just quickly explain and help me out I'd appreciate that.

A string tied to the small block passes down through the hole, and a larger block with mass M   is suspended from the free end of the string. The small block is set into uniform circular motion with radius r and speed v.      What must v be if the large block is to remain motionless when released?   Express your answer in terms of the variables r, M, m, and g.      This is homework that is due tomorrow at 1:45pm. Right now it is 2:46 am... clearly I am getting no where with this.

20090309191003AAKVweK	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Combinatorics-proof of trees.?	Prove that a graph is a tree if and only if it doesn't have any cycles, but adding another edge always creates exactly one cycle.      NOTE: I can visually understand what it's saying but I don't know how to put it into a proof format. I mean, a graph that is a tree is taking the shortest route possible, with each vertex being connected to one other vertex. But if another edge is added in it must connect two vertices that are part of the graph and already have at least one edge connecting them to another vertex in the graph. And that vertex is connected to another and so on for all the vertices, making it a cycle. Now how do I say all that legitimately in a mathematical proof...I have no idea.

20090310003644AA7mEi8	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Newton's Law for cooling tea....?	I have a project due and are struggling with it. Some help would be great.      Tea must be brewed at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, rapidly cooled, and served between 42 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The tea will taste awful if not served between these temperatures.   In your search you have found three cooling kegs (similar to beer kegs) that will cool the freshly brewed tea to the desired serving temperature range. However, the tea will remain in the ideal range for only a short time before it cools below the 42 degree mark.      The specification for the cooling kegs are as follows (all have the same capacity):   1) The Fast Cool company has a keg that will cool the desired amount of tea from 140 F to 45 F in 30 minutes. The cooler walls remain at a constant 30 F.      2) The Big Chill company has a keg that will cool the desired amount of tea from 140 F to 60 F in 25 minutes. The cooler walls remain at a constant 34 F.      3) The party Cooler Company has a keg that will cool the desired amount of tea from 140 F to 55 F in 15 minutes. The cooler walls remain at a constant 38 F.      You must evaluate and compare the performance of the three options with regard to two parameters:    1) speed in which each cooler will reach the upper serving temperature limit.   2) how long the tea will remain in the 26 degree range before cooling further.      PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: Using Newton's Law of cooling calculate the speed that unit will require to reach the 68 F mark and the time that each unit will keep the tea in the desired range between 42 F and 68 F.    On average you serve the amount of tea contained in the kegs in about 19 minutes. Which unit would you choose?

It's really important that I find the correct answer though, because I have to do a presentation on the disease for a final exam grade. Any help would be GREATLY (!) appreciated.    Here is the case study:   George had been home from Bhutan, where he was studying plant life in a little village, for about a week when he began to feel sick. At first it was just a sore throat, weakness, and a dry cough. He attributed these symptoms to being on a plane with so many people and being jet-lagged. After a few days, he developed a severe fever and a loss of appetite. He went to the hospital later that day, where they discovered the following:   -His fever peaked at 104 degrees.   -His heart rate was very slow.   All of a sudden, his temperature dropped.

Calculus 3 question any help? i think you its something like the normal vector of the plane cross the vector of P and then maybe use the distance formula since the cross product gives you a vector instead of a scalar.

20090310022003AARN5yB	Science & Mathematics;Botany	What kind of insect is this?	So I'm having an issue with these bugs in my room. They look almost like cockroaches, but not as long. Kind of like a mix of a cockroach & a beetle. They're always climbing up the blinds on my windows and can usually be found on the window ledge. They are also always on my bed and all over my room in general. They do not fly, and don't really move unless you touch them. AND they stick pretty well to objects, for example, one was on my shirt and I shook my shirt and it was still there.       Any idea as to what they are and if so, how do I get rid of them?
20090310022218AAUD8oD	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Probability problem.?	Let's say I have a disease and I was given a risky antidote that can possible cure it.      There is a 70% chance the antidote will cure my disease completely and a 30% chance that it will not work.      However, if it doesn't work, there is a 50% chance that it'll kill me.      What is the probability of this antidote killing me?      I thought it was .30 x .50 = .15; 15% chance of it killing me.      My friends suggest otherwise.      Please advise.  And thank you in advance.
