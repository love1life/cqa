20090226194843AAmnRrX	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Name this resort hotel?	what is the best name for my hotel and also the restaurant and cafe??   I plan to build a five star resort hotel which is located in Apo Island, five kilometers off the coast of Dauin, and twenty kilometers from Dumaguete City, Province of Negors Oriental. You can fly between Dumaguete and Manila on your choice of two flights per day [morning and afternoon] on each of two airlines: Air Philippines [owned by Philippines Airlines or Cebu Pacific. The flights from Manila takes approximately by an hour; another ten minutes are taken by the taxi or tricycle to downtown. You can also get there by thirty-minute travel time by land from Dumaguete airport plus forty-five to sixty minutes by pump boat. There are also many sites that you can visit Marine Sanctuary and Protected Seascape, Clown Fish City is in the marine sanctuary, Katipanan, Chapel Balay, Largahan, Olo, Mamsa, Kan-Oran, The Lighthouse. And activities like Scuba Diving, snorkeling, video outside the sanctuary and outside the landscape and camping.       The resort hotel is kind of expensive. It consists 75 rooms, which features are Safety deposit box, IDD/NDD phone system fully-stocked minibar/refrigerator, sky cable television, hairdryer & clothesline, kitchenette facilities (Deluxe and Suites only). 10 rooms per floor, and also function rooms that are perfect for private conferences to lavish parties, as well as state-of-the-art business center, complete with Internet connection and desktop publishing services. And for fun and activities try your luck at bass fishing, outdoor hot spring pool, complimentary bikes, or indulge in lawn games or team sports like softball, or volleyball. After the big game, reminisce about your big play over drinks with friends in our sports bar. Spa for relaxing, salon for grooming, and an international and Filipino cuisine at my 5 star restaurant. Want to relax? Have some coffee at my café.  And gym to warm up, aerobics, or body building.

I am thinking of producing and selling a simple but desirable and catchy item that anyone can buy for a low price. The supplies to produce the products would be funded by what i earn babysitting, so its clearly a tight budget. Anybody that can think of a creative idea that you would buy, and think others would also be interested in , would be potentially helping orphans that are suffering severely from poverty, starvation, sickness, and no support whatsoever.

20090226203817AA0Ac30	Travel;Asia Pacific;Korea	What is the difference between these two (cause I really need to know)?	I need help with hangul/hangeul/han'g?l (??):   "?" and "?." They both sound like "-eh" to me!   (I never really understood these two vowels: "?" and "?." What the hell is the difference?!)   The same goes for: "?/?" & "?/?" = "-geh/-ggeh"; "?" & "?" = "-neh"; "?/?" & "?/?" = "-deh/-ddeh (-tteh)"; "?" & "?" = "-reh/-leh"; "?" & "?" = "-meh"; "?/?" & "?/?" = "-beh/-bbeh (-ppeh)"; "?/?" & "?/?" = "-seh/-sseh"; "?/?" & "?/?" = "-jeh/-jjeh"; "?" & "?" = "-cheh"; "?" & "?" = "-keh"; "?" & "?" = "-teh"; "?" & "?" = "-peh"; "?" & "?" = "-heh."      I think the ambiguity between these two vowel usage is a problem...so problematic that the Korean people themselves probably realized that once they got rid of the now-obsolete "?" form of romanized "-yeh" sound for the redundant "?" form of basically the same thing (which they replaced it with and is used more commonly in the modern Korean language nowadays). And can someone tell me which consonant letters can be used in combination with "-yeh"? Like for example, i think i've seen this one before:   "?" = "-gyeh" and "?" = "-hyeh." But never: "?" = "-nyeh" or "?" = "-ryeh"?      Heck, it's still easier than "nihongo" (Japanese) (hanja/kanji/hiragana/katakana).

I'm on a budget and a time constraint of about a week. I'd like to go off the beaten path as much as possible too, want to see "the great stuff" but not be in the super "touristy" places quite as often. Here is a list of activities I know I want to do:   - Sailing/snorkeling   - Sea kayak   - Chill on the beach   - Canyoning   - Backpack for 1 night   - bungy jump or skydive   - catch an All Blacks rugby game   - possibly go rafting (not a top priority though)      What would be the best way of getting around in some of these places? Rent a car? Fly between different cities? I'd like to go on some drives to see the country if possilbe (maybe not in only a week). Anyways, I'm just looking for some insight on beautiful places to do these activities that are somewhat off the beaten path. That would also make a sensible way of getting around from place to place.

20090226161727AAR7oGh	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	Do you think that the high price of drink in pubs and clubs increases binge drinking in the R.O.I?	O.k., I did not phrase the question wrong. I think that the abolishment of “Happy Hour” and increase of drink in pubs increases binge drinking. People go off and buy cheap drink in the off licence instead of going to the pub early. We all know we give bigger portions in a house than a pub.   Plus cheap drink gets you more drunk. It has higher alcohol content.      So people go to the pub on a Saturday for one in the pub and then the nightclub. They have already binged drank at this stage, because they have consumed so much alcohol in the house. It was like a rush to get drunk before the pubs close.      Now I know people did not like the idea of Happy Hour???? In fairness you would have a “Happy Hour” at different times in different pubs. You would not have to rush your drink. You could take your time. I honestly think people drank less.   Now you go out and someone is just in the pub, saying they are just after drinking a half bottle of vodka in space of 2 hours.   How could Happy Hour be worse than this?   At least people were just drinking at some sort of normal pace.      If drink were cheaper, people would not feel the need to drink at home. They would have controlled portions.       So do high prices in pubs cause binge drinking?      If not do you think that binge drinking has been reduced here   in the last few years?      But maybe I am wrong and the increase in the price of drink in    pubs has nothing to do with it.      Oh the price has gone up in general by a lot,    even if "Happy Hour" never existed.

I like the looks of Whistler, B.C. but I just thought I would ask for any better suggestions. Anyone who knows of my imaginary dream land? This would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!

There are five of us total, and the two couples are using the bed and we're putting one person on the floor. My question is, do they really check the number of people going in and out of their hotels in Canada? I mean if three people just walk in and get on the elevator are they going to be stopped and asked what room they're going to? I've done this plenty of times here in the states, I was just wondering if it's different in Canada. Thanks for your time!

20090225101401AAKYzRN	Travel;Europe (Continental);Russia	What is the cheapest way to travel from Miami to Vladivostok, Russia?	I was thinking of taking a vaction in Russia- specifically in Vladivostok.  Do you know the cheapest time of year to fly there?  I have looked on-line at ticket prices and they have come back really expensive.  For example, I have looked at flying in May from MIA to VVO and the prices are over $2,000.  What are my options?  I know there are ferries from Japan to Vladivostok.  But how can I found out info about them on-line?  Also, I could fly to a city such as Harbin, China and then take the railroad to Vladivostok, but you can only buy train tickets 45 days in advance.  I don't want to fly into Moscow and then take the Trans-Siberian railway to Vladivostok because then the trip would be way too long.      Does anyone have any suggestions?  I don't mind flying out of another U.S. city just as long as it is most cost efficient (for ex: after flying from my home town to that U.S. city it could end up being more expensive).  And does anyone know if we have to pay to check in baggage on international flights?

20090128093751AAsYDd5	Travel;France;Paris	Why do adults traveling without children go to Eurodisney?	I am fascinated by the number of questions in this section about Eurodisney that are asked by what appear to be adults traveling to Paris without children.       I can certainly understand people with kids taking them there but why would an adult, especially one traveling to Paris for the first time and from a great distance, waste the time and money to go to a theme park?      Few people have unlimited time on a vacation and for many people a trip to Paris is a once in a lifetime experience. So to go to Disneyland means choosing to see its attractions rather than those of Paris itself. That is, they choose to see Mickey Mouse rather than the Mona Lisa or the Magic Castle rather than Versailles.      Is it simple ignorance? Immaturity? The inability to distinguish  the crass commercialism from the real? Something else?      What is your opinion?
