20060713095930AAtNGRI	Pets;Cats	There is this cat that is irritating my dog sooo much!!!?	My dog Oreo is a house dog. She doesn't like to go outside very much; however, she does like to sit at the door and look outside (to bark at people who go by) or sit on the head-rest of the couch to look out the window. Well, there is this neighborhood cat (I don't know if it's a stray or not), that comes and sits on the porch directly in front of my dog when she is looking out of the door (the door is closed of course, but it is clear plastic). My dog goes balistic, jumping on the door and barking, like an intruder is trying to break into the house or something. When I close the door or pull her away, she whines and looks so sad. So, I let sit in front of the window to look out. The cat will jump on the ledge of the window and meow, and my dog will go crazy again. Now my dog is not a big barker, she only barks when she hears someone coming in the house or when she's other animals. But, it's really annoying, and I can't understand why the cat is tormenting my dog. What should I do?

20060804161311AAVGwD3	Pets;Cats	When cats go nuts?	I hear that cats likes their tummys to be rubbed, but when i rub my female cat's tummy, she goes nuts. She bites your hand and scratches and pushed your hand away with her feet. I assume it's because of her nipples (i guess) they're probly really sensitive. But my friend has an older cat that doesn't mind having her tummy rubbed.  This disproves my theory about her "sensitive" parts. Are there any other logical answers to this?

20060809164533AANyD2d	Pets;Cats	Cat Question?	My cat has been coming up to the door and meows and scratches it. He usually does that when he is hungry, but I already fed him today. He likes the food I gave him because he was eating it earlier. And I checked his food bowls and they're already full of food.Then I thought he might want some attention. But when I went outside he didn't want me to pet him. I thought maybe he's sick, but he's acting fine. He has 3 other cat friends so he's not lonely. I treated him and the other cats for fleas yesterday, but he's not scratching or licking all the time, so I don't think that has to do with anything. When I opened the door one time, he ran inside. I think he wants to be an inside cat, but he can't live inside for a number of reasons. I just don't know what to do. Is there anything wrong with him?

20061218181556AAoVlFq	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog "stupid"?	This is not a joke.  I have had the dog about 5 weeks now, he is about 14 or 15 weeks old by now.  He has yet to learn to go outside, and we have tried everything, including crate training.  He just holds it until we take him out, and he wont go outside either.  He will only use the bathroom inside.  But the main problem is that he wont stay off my bed.  I have thrown him of the bed hundreds of times (not violently, just pushed him off) and also tried spanking him when hes  caught on the bed and also said NO and pointed to the bed.  What can i do to help him understand these things? I really do think he is stupid or something.  BTW hes a beagle.

When we first walked into the room where he was being kept with many other cats, male and female.   When I first went in he was very interactive, jumping up onto me and licking me immediately, but then he bit my boyfriend quite lightly on the hand when he tried to stroke him. He then started going berserk because another cat jumped on the scratch post and attacked it, then I tried to stroke him and he attacked me. Later on my boyfriend tried to stroke him again and he bit him again, and he jumped on my shoulder and bit me when I tried to stroke him.   The shelter worker told me that he was about 2, had been in care for 6 months so far, he'd been in a car accident and broke his back and legs. And that he didn't like other cats, he was very terrotorial.       My worry is if I get him home, is he going to attack me or is it just because he is trying to dominate the other cats or is nervous? Will he sit on the bed etc. and attack me if I try to move him?      Thanks for reading.

About two days ago I put some of his food into his cage (dried baby shrimp/krill) and he usually eats it...but he started vomiting up some of the food I fed him the other night.

I don't know whats going on,and I am really scared. He also seems to be shedding or something because some white slimy stuff is coming off of him....any ideas? Thanks.

20090227143215AA4ZRO5	Pets;Fish	Can a pregnant angel fish lay eggs without a mate?	My mom recently bought a pearl scale angel fish and it seems that it's pregnant. We've never had a pregnant angel fish before so we haven't noticed until now. She's swimming up and down on one of the walls of the tank, so I think she's ready to have them. However, she doesn't have a mate! There is a small angel fish that was recently put in there about a week ago, but I really doubt he got her pregnant. Would he be too small to fertilize the eggs or can she successfully have the eggs without them being fertilized? The small angel fish's body is a tad bit bigger than a quarter.

She knows what she does is wrong, because she always hangs her head when she gets caught.         We don't belive in rubbing her nose in pee-- and always say no in low voices if we catch her in the act. We feed her 2 times a day. We don't have a yard, so we have a built in pen in our garage, with puppy pads. She goes on there alot but still has plenty accidents. Sometimes she won't go at all, and sometimes alot. She knows what "go potty" means.      We crate her at night and let her out right away in the morning.       HELP

20070220034945AACzRfU	Pets;Dogs	What can I do to stop this!!?	I have a female chihuahua, 15 years old.  She has started to pee around my house like crazy.  She pees on bags, phone books, toys, whatever she feels the need to use it on, she does.  She is at a stage where I am considering caging her up for most of the day, but she has never been caged before and may not handle it well.  I hate to get rid of her, but she can't keep this up, I am preparing to move soon and I don't want this behavior to continue after I move and new carpet gets messed up.  Any advice?

The bodies are mostly turquoise with gold stripes and hues of blue and purple(depending on the angle of the light). I have seen "blueberry" oscars and mine are different in that they have absolutly no red or orange coloration. Like most oscars they do change to an almost pale white whenever i clean the tank.

I have a jack russell terrier she is about 2 years old. back in january a flood in my house cause me and my dog to move in with my boyfreind and his family and thier two dogs they have a maltise and a maltise/poodle mix. Before i got the dog she had grown up with the maltise/poodle. She had never met the maltise. the maltise is about 13 years old. All of the dogs got along fine until about two weeks ago when my dog started trying to attack the maltise. last week she got into it wih her and bit her in a few places. My house isn't ready i need her to be able to stay here but the family wants to lock her up. I don't understand why they all got along fine since january and now she wants to attack this other dog she gets vicious about it. I love my dog so much and i just want them to all get along. Could this be a medical condition or would obedience school help. I just don't know what to do. Please help.

I need advice on getting him in better shape. also wondering under his wings are pretty bare. My other 3 birds all have ther feathers under there wings. Is that normal for a UTOO? He was on A all sunflower seed diet. Drinks coffee.( which I no is a BIG NO NO) His feathers are supposed to be white.they said they didnt give him a shower all winter. So I did a lite mist when we got home today and his face turned almost BLACK. Some of his wings look like sticks. He had mold in his food bowl! It broke my heart to see him in a flithy cage with a tiny toy ( long chain with 2 plastic beads, He is very friendly. Loves to cuddle. But they gave him up because he screams all the time. Well thats their reason. So any suggestions? Ive done some research since I been home. But any advice will help us. Do you know how long it will take to get his feathers in good condtion. My thought was a few molts. Maybe 6 months to a year. Or how to help him adjust? Thanks

I've tried everything from yelping out like another puppy, spraying her from behind with water, crating her, alpha rolling her, firmly tapping her under the chin. I bought that spray which is supposed to taste bad for dog but it doesn't work on her. She has plenty of toys! She chews on her leash as well and I'm unable to have her walk on it. I praise and give treats when she's good but it hasn't helped. She's very defiant and headstrong, refusing to acknowledge or respect me 99% of the time! She knows sit, down, and come but as far as anything else goes, she does everything on her own terms. Please help me teach the pup I'm boss, not her. I want to do this on my own without having to go out and get a trainer. I've had many pups in the past and have never had this problem before.

[he's a pitbull, and we were told to give him an extra shot 3 weeks after the 3 all puppies get because pitty's are one of the breeds that easily get parvo.] it wont be for another 2-3 months if we do go.... do you think the puppy is at risk? if there's even a small chance he would get it, there is no way i'm even going. i just want some input.      also, can anyone give me info on shots? i keep reading different oponions on how often the shots have to be repeated. every year? every other?

20070611201948AAKl3tJ	Pets;Fish	I have three male bettas all in one gallon bowls. They seem to be lethargic now when they weren't before. Help	Two weeks ago, all three fish were swimming around, happy as can be. But lately, they have seemed lethargic. I talked to some people at a petstore and they told me to only clean 25% of their water every week and a half because they like dirty water. I find this hard to believe, so I still do a complete water change once a week.     I'm very worried that they are all sick for some reason though. Usually they blow nice bubble nests, and this week they haven't.     I also did some research on food, as I have been feeding them solely freeze dried blood worms, but found out this was a no-no, so I feed two of them betta bites and just one the blood worms because he refuses to eat anything else.    Please help me, I have no idea what it could be and why all three of them are sick (possibly) at the same time.    Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice you have!

Well, I am not too sure what my dog had but I took him to the vet after his 'seizure' had happened and they are currently doing a blood test. I've watched videos of dogs getting seizures but they don't look like the ones that my dog had. What happened with my dog was, he's legs would stretch really far and he'd get really low to the ground like he was lying down then he'd shake a bit out of control then like 30 seconds later he'd get up and then sit down and start shaking like he's cold and the whole time he's be breathing really hard. After 10 he'd do the same thing he did in the beginning then it'd be all over. This had happened twice within 3 months. Nomally I see dogs on their sides and foaming or something. I haven't seen a dog's seizures like my dogs. Is that a seizure my dog had? Or do you think it was something else? I hope it is nothing serious, I should be getting the blood results in 2 days but I'd like to know you opinion. TY

She was feeding them properly, according to the directions on the tropical fish food.       Her tank is a 1 gallon tank, which has the air bubbles thing, but no filter. The water got cloudy within a couple of days, but I didn't think it was anything to worry about. Today the water is somewhat cloudy and the second fish is laying next to the dead one, still alive, but looks like the breathing is labored. What did we do wrong?

20071227081933AAHzZKh	Pets;Dogs	Any answers to why my dog is throwing up yellow bile in the morning?	It has now been two mornings in a row that he has woken up and began heaving and thrown up yellow bile. He has thrown up before with a little food in it, but this has been when after exercising and he would scarf down his food or water, then two seconds later- bleh. I have spoken to the vet about that issue in the past and he has gotten better when i take the food away and let him rest for a minute before giving him more. The past two mornings though, it has been the bile throw up.  He did do it once before about a month ago also. I have not been able to get in touch with my vet as of yet, so instead i have been researching online. I found a forum which seems to say that it is hunger. He eats about 10am and 8 or 9pm with a few snacks in between. Also, i'm not sure if it is relevant but i took a tick off of him a week ago. This is my first dog so i have been racing to the vet for every little thing. Wondering if I should try a late night snack before going to the vet..

20081021004748AA8cVWt	Pets;Birds	Which came first? The chicken or the egg? Glass half empty or half full?	Just abit of harmless fun!      A question that many find hard to answer and is there a correct answer?   I've got 2.      Scientific: The egg came first.   Changes in the animal are made while they are being developed and not when they are already alive. (get my drift?) So obviously the egg had to have come first      E.g In Russia (I think) they took wolves from the wild and kept them in captivity. Each litter of puppes they tried to domesticate. However, the puppies would still be wild and have wild instincts, making it hard for them to be domesticated. Although, when the puppies grew up and had litters of their own, the puppies would be somewhat more easier to domesticate than the others.   The problem was as litters were born, down the line their appearance changed and in the end they had almost all the characteristics of a domesticated dog. I think they said something about the puppies getting smaller, less 'wild' fur, etc.    That, I believe, is evolution.         Regligious: Plain and simple. God made them. He made the animals fully grown as it says in the bible.         ALSO:   Is the glass half empty or half full?      Answer 1: If you poor the wine into the glass but only fill it half way, it's half full.      Answer 2: If you poor a full glass of wine and drink half of it, it's half empty.         What are your answers?         I thought it would be nice for pet people to have a go (hoping for some quirky answers) instead of these scientific math heads giving me their 'scientifically correct' answers. Lol!

20081226214516AAE73W9	Pets;Dogs	Training the new puppy... Any suggestions?	I brought home my first puppy 3 days ago.       I am having some issues crate training and potty training. She doesn't display the typical "potty signs"      No sniffing, no circling... She just stops in the middle of whatever she's doing and pees. I take her outside after meals and playing, and she runs and runs and runs. Sometimes she goes outside. Other times we could be outside for a good 20 minutes with nothing, and as soon as we come back inside, she goes!      Crate training is no fun either. She's fine going in the crate with the door open, but as soon as the door closes behind her, she flips. Howling and barking. Then she eliminates... Even if she's already gone potty.      I'm at a loss. I'm unsure how else to approach it.
