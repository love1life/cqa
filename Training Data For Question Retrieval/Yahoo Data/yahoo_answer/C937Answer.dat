lzEuuseJaa	I'm a mom who has looked for private voice lessons for my son. I also toyed with the idea of guitar, my dh plays, but thought I'd wait a bit on that for my son. <br>  <br>  Who is your target customer? Kids and adults or ? Be sure you're advertising to your market.<br>  <br>  I found two exceptional voice instructors through craigslist, both moved away after a year to do great things with their careers, but the friend of one is now my son's teacher and she's wonderful. See if craigslist is in your area and check out the competition. Put enough detail in the ad to make prospective clients want to call you, especially if you want to teach kids. I didn't even bother with ads that seemed too cryptic.<br>  <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites</a><br>  <br>  MySpace and a website. Two of the guitar teachers I strongly considered had MySpace and another website. I think I found the websites through Google (guitar lessons, Los Angeles) and from craigslist. The voice teachers I chose did also. I like to gather as much info as possible, hear them, see if I like their vibe, see them, so by the time I speak to the teacher the first time, my mind is almost made up. Better to let people sell themselves on you, rather than you have to do it over the phone. <br>  <br>  Also, word of mouth. Other musicians, friends, family. Put it out there that you're teaching. Tell everyone. I mean everyone. Have cards made up with your website url, phone #, etc on them.<br>  <br>  After school program. Might be tough in this economy but you might try private schools. At my son's private K - 8 we have companies (very small to large) come in after school to teach chess, dance, mandarin, science adventures, etc. I don't know what the financial deal is with the school, like what percentage they get. <br>  <br>  Also, there is a shelf full of flyers for lessons, etc in our school's office. <br>  <br>  See if there is a newspaper specific to your market. In my area, someone started up a newspaper about a year ago and it's doing great. It's basically full of photos of local private school events, sports, charity events, restaurant review, parenting column, etc and it goes out free in the area. Parents love to look at their kids and know what's going on with other kids in the area. The ads target parents - camps, lessons, tutoring, etc. <br>  <br>  Community college extension class - here are some at PCC as an example:<br>  <a href="http://pasadena.augusoft.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=1011&CategoryID=2&SubCategoryID=11" rel="nofollow">http://pasadena.augusoft.net/index.cfm?f...</a><br>  <a href="http://pasadena.augusoft.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=1011&CategoryID=1&SubCategoryID=3" rel="nofollow">http://pasadena.augusoft.net/index.cfm?f...</a><br>  The Acoustic Guitar classes may be gone, they have removed some classes since it's almost time for the Spring classes. They have both kids and adult classes. You can check on the website of the community college near you for info on doing a class.<br>  <br>  Community and recreation centers may also have similar programs.<br>  <br>  Post flyers at your local colleges, there are boards for that. Sometimes you have to get them approved in the office. At the bottom of the flyer, put your website url vertically a bunch of times and make cuts in between each one, so people can easily tear off your url to take with them. (Sort of like the flyer has fringe at the bottom.) <br>  <br>  Let a friend who fits your target market look at your flyer, website, card, etc and critique if they think they're appropriate.<br>  <br>  This is a really bad time to start up a business selling a *non-essential* service. But try not to get discouraged, there are always customers out thee, you just have to find them. Most of the ideas I gave you are very low cost. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Go to your local community college and offer your services see if you sign a spring and summer contract with them.  Go to the Mall and send more flyers at grammar schools after school programs.  Good Luck!!
cdt4F6ZWaa	If you have to scrape to get $2500 together, then you shouldn't be even wanting to purchase a home right now.  Look at the mess that many are in. Those people couldn't afford it either, and they are getting foreclosures on their homes and got kicked out of their homes!!  Is that what you want?<br>  <br>  The banks, a couple years ago, would have given a loan to just about anyone, and would have said to you, "Of course you can afford it!  Even with bad credit, and no down payment, you can certainly afford a new home".  Now, since this has all happened, they are in serious trouble because many couldn't pay, and this is why they are saying no to you. Sure you really want a nice home.  But you also have to be comfortable financially, and not be in a position where you are worried about how you'll make ends meet every month.  <br>  <br>  You guys sound like you're just having bad luck in this apartment; why didn't they inspect and fix the roof immediately??  Your landlord sounds like an idiot, a mattress on the living room floor does not mean you guys were not concerned about cleanliness.  And he accused you of destroying a lock??  <br>  <br>  You guys definitely need to keep renting until you can get your credit score back up and get the cash to use as a down payment.  There are a lot of empty houses out there that aren't selling and people are renting them out instead.  You could probably find one with a large yard so you can keep your dog.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  I forgot to add; I don't know if you plan on marrying your boyfriend but that is an entirely different story and you really have to be careful...about whose name is on the mortgage and things like that.  December is a long way off; I would try to find a way out of your lease.  The leaky roof is a really good excuse and make sure you document when you have spoken or talk to your landlord about problems.|`|23SkYEw5aa	just not going to happen until you fix your credit.  <br>  <br>  fix the credit.<br>  <br>  PS, could they be asking you to leave because you pay your rent late . . .?

The only thing is that when you get snow storm you may get incommunicated but that happens only once in a while.  There are also the fires, that does not happen often either.

No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address.

Just as if they didn't re-affirm the loan any payment they are making isn't helping their credit either.<br>  <br>  Now, if they got the car AFTER the chapter 7 or they re-affirmed the car loan.  It would be considered a Repo which is a negative, where the only thing worse is a Bankruptcy(which she already has).  A Repo on top of a Bankruptcy is going to be a bigger negative.  Also, if she turns it is she is still responsible for the loan balance after they sell the car.<br>  <br>  Now, a 10% interest rate with a BK is very good.  On a recent BK if she was to go with a new loan she would be lucky to get an interest rate in the low 20's.  So she really should do what ever she can to keep it, especially if it is no longer under the Bankruptcy.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	A repossession lowers the credit score.

Lz6VAkLEaa	This is the technically known as Buy and Hold Strategy.<br>  I understand better with examples, so I will go with this strategy. <br>  Say you purchased a house with $350,000 at an interest rate of 5%. Your weekly repayment is $336.53. If you could rent it out at say $300 dollars, you are just having this property for only $36.53 pwk. <br>  The greater benefit is:<br>  i) Short term – you can claim tax back on your loss<br>  ii) Long term – You get the capital gain ride. Visit <a href="http://www.powerful-wealth-building-information.com/real-estate-investing-advice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerful-wealth-building-info...</a> to see the fun in capital gain. <br>  One word of caution: <br>  You will have to be ready for facts like rental management, home repair and some bolt from blue and tenants from hell. That’s why I recommend Buy at least 10 properties so that the money really works for you.|`|NDNLo2R2aa	First of all, you have to be in a position to buy a house.  The best way to start is to buy a duplex and live in one half and rent out the other, that essentially makes home ownership a little more affordable.  Unless you happen to have a lot of capitol to work with right a way, it will take you time(and a good job) to be able to accumulate more properties.  Single family properties are the hardest to generate cash flow, though it can be done if you get one at a good enough price.  The more units in a property, the more potential cashflow - but also the more headaches.  Just remember, being a landlord is not always a walk in the park.  Even if you are a decent person and try to be fair, you will quickly become the "bad guy" in a tenant eyes when they are not completely happy.  I agree with the other posters that you will need other people around you that have experience.  I would also not recommend owning property too far away from you.  You need to be able to handle it personally if you want to make any money.  If you have to hire managers etc. that will eat into the profits.|`|hFGT2RCkaa	Well, 1 good idea after your purchase the property is to good a homeowners association or something of the sort to keep it in tip top shape for you and take care of the maintenance.

jWZ5Odyaaa	The elite lawyers and everyone else.  Stephen T speaks the truth about the legal profession.|`|b6cPtJ6haa	Best Answer - Chosen by Voters<br>  Lawyers are a dime a dozen, go medical. Heck, there is a shortage of pharmacists and their median wage is $98,000K well above lawyers. Dentists 180,000K median and there is a shortage, and of course a shortage of MDs.<br>  <br>  From US News, Poor careers for 2006<br>  Attorney. If starting over, 75 percent of lawyers would choose to do something else. A similar percentage would advise their children not to become lawyers. The work is often contentious, and there's pressure to be unethical. And despite the drama portrayed on TV, real lawyers spend much of their time on painstakingly detailed research. In addition, those fat-salaried law jobs go to only the top few percent of an already high-powered lot.<br>  <br>  Many people go to law school hoping to do so-called public-interest law. (In fact, much work not officially labeled as such does serve the public interest.) What they don't teach in law school is that the competition for those jobs is intense. I know one graduate of a Top Three law school, for instance, who also edited a law journal. She applied for a low-paying job at the National Abortion Rights Action League and, despite interviewing very well, didn't get the job.<br>  <br>  From the Associated Press, MADISON, Wis. (AP) - A lawmaker who persuaded the Assembly to eliminate all state funding for the University of Wisconsin law school says his reasoning is simple: There's too many lawyers in Wisconsin.<br>  <br>  From an ABA study about malpractice claims, More Sole Practicioners: There appears to be an increasing trend toward sole practicioners, due partly to a lack of jobs for new lawyers, but also due to increasing dissatisfaction among experienced lawyers with traditional firms; leading to some claims which could have been avoided with better mentoring.<br>  <br>  New Lawyers: Most insurers have noticed that many young lawyers cannot find jobs with established firms, and so are starting their own practices without supervision or mentoring. This is likely to cause an increase in malpractice claims, although the claims may be relatively small in size due to the limited nature of a new lawyers<br>  <br>  “In a survey conducted back in 1972 by the American Bar Association, seventy percent of Americans not only didn’t have a lawyer, they didn’t know how to find one. That’s right, thirty years ago the vast majority of people didn’t have a clue on how to find a lawyer. Now it’s almost impossible not to see lawyers everywhere you turn."<br>  <br>  Growth of Legal Sector<br>  Lags Broader Economy; Law Schools Proliferate<br>  For graduates of elite law schools, prospects have never been better. Big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as $160,000. But the majority of law-school graduates are suffering from a supply-and-demand imbalance that's suppressing pay and job growth. The result: Graduates who don't score at the top of their class are struggling to find well-paying jobs to make payments on law-school debts that can exceed $100,000. Some are taking temporary contract work, reviewing documents for as little as $20 an hour, without benefits. And many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market.<br>  <br>  The law degree that Scott Bullock gained in 2005 from Seton Hall University -- where he says he ranked in the top third of his class -- is a "waste," he says. Some former high-school friends are earning considerably more as plumbers and electricians than the $50,000-a-year Mr. Bullock is making as a personal-injury attorney in Manhattan. To boot, he is paying off $118,000 in law-school debt.<br>  <br>  A slack in demand appears to be part of the problem. The legal sector, after more than tripling in inflation-adjusted growth between 1970 and 1987, has grown at an average annual inflation-adjusted rate of 1.2% since 1988, or less than half as fast as the broader economy, according to Commerce Department data.<br>  <br>  On the supply end, more lawyers are entering the work force, thanks in part to the accreditation of new law schools and an influx of applicants after the dot-com implosion earlier this decade. In the 2005-06 academic year, 43,883 Juris Doctor degrees were awarded, up from 37,909 for 2001-02, according to the American Bar Association. Universities are starting up more law schools in part for prestige but also because they are money makers. Costs are low compared with other graduate schools and classrooms can be large. Since 1995, the number of ABA-accredited schools increased by 11%, to 196.<br>  <br>  According to the Internal Revenue Service, the inflation-adjusted average income of sole practitioners has been flat since the mid-1980s. A recent survey showed that out of nearly 600 lawyers at firms of 10 lawyers or fewer in Indiana, wages for the majority only kept pace with inflation or dropped in real terms over the past five years.<br>  <br>  Many students "simply cannot earn enough income after graduation to support the debt they incur," wrote Richard Matasar, dean of New York Law

If so, you may have some leverage against the Land Lord for not using a licensed contractor.  <br>  <br>  In my state the fine is $5,000 for failing to use a licensed contractor on a business / rental property where people other than the property owner can be at risk.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	No, you have no reason to not pay the landlord.

5Gxll9Hkaa	It is not "exempt" from being listed in your bankruptcy paperwork (all debts and assets must be listed on your Ch 13 Schedules), but in general, qualified retirement plans are exempt from being used to pay creditors.<br>  <br>  The notion of "exemptions" is more relevant to Ch 7 than to Ch 13.  In Ch 7, your current assets are liquidated to pay creditors but you are allowed to keep anything that can be "exempted" (from liquidation) according to the exemptions available in your state.<br>  <br>  In Ch 13, since future income rather than current assets is used to repay creditors, basically nothing is liquidated to pay creditors, so the notion of "exemptions" doesn't really apply.  <br>  <br>  The only place that "exemptions" comes into play in Ch 13 is that the law requires that creditors wind up no worse off for your having filed a Ch 13 than they would have been if you'd filed Ch 7 instead.  So your attorney must figure out what your exemptions "would have been" if you'd filed Ch 7 in order to demonstrate that your creditors are no worse off when you file Ch 13.<br>  <br>  In general, income that is part of a qualified retirememt program (i.e., interest income, etc.) and that is plowed back into the retirement savings is not considered "income" when determining what you must repay in Ch 13.
Hx88UGlpaa	If you have paid the retainer in full, the creditors have to cease and desist any collection attempts against you. No, they cannot sue you at this point, if they even tried they could be fined up to 1,000.00 for attempting as you are protected now under the bankruptcy laws. Your attorney on request from you or their assitant in the office can fax over a copy of your case filing to the creditors. If you have a case#, answer the phone, tell them you filed bankruptcy, they will ask you for the case # , give it to them, legally, they cannot contact you after that. The US Bankruptcy court, once they receive your case, will notify each creditor and it usually takes approx 30 days for them to get the notification. Your attorney can do this if it's something you need to cease immediately. You can get more bankruptcy info at their website.....www.usbankruptcy.gov    Good Luck!!!|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Your attorney is supposed to contact them and that will be the end of the calls since they know they will have to show in court at this point.

f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Both my sister in law, and brother are RN's so I have a good idea of what they make.  My brother works ER, and my sister in law works ER some, labor and delivery some, and also works some outside hospice jobs.  My brother (who's been doing it for around 10 yrs) makes around $30/hour, which ain't bad.  To really boost your income to close to the $100,000 yr though he'd have to work nights, weekends, and holidays.  Nurses make the most money when working a time when no one else wants to.  His $30/hour is Monday thru Friday 7am-7pm.   If he worked nights he'd get another $4/hour, weekends would pay another $4/hour, weekend nights would make another $4/hour, and with Holidays it's way more.  If you really want to make massive money you need to go to nursing school, work for a couple of yrs, apply and get accepted into Nurse Athesecist (sp) school.  It's a long, hard program (about 2 yrs) but beginning salaries for that starts in the $150,000 range.  <br>  My sister in law has worked in Hospice before.  Not in a nursing home but checking up on, and supply medicine to terminally ill people that are living at home.  It also pays great money but you need to be emotionally very strong to constantly be working around people that are going to die.  Your only job will be to make them comfortable.<br>  <br>  LVN's make way less.  In the $15/hr range.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Nurse for almost 13 years, $30/hr for days 12 hr shifts/3 a week.

3yrpDNavaa	OK, you should see if there is a disability rights advocate or counselor in your area.  There are some things you can likely do to ensure continued receipt of SSI.<br>  <br>  1.  The home does not count as an asset if it is your residence.  So, you and your son can simply move into the home.<br>  2.  You also cannot be forced to sell a property you jointly own if the sale would cause hardship (i.e. cause the person residing therein to lose housing).  If this was the case when your SSI was shut off, then you should appeal.<br>  3.  You could probably sell your share of the home and use the proceeds to buy a residence for you & your son.  Again, as I already said, your personal residence is completely exempt from the SSI asset test.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert on the SSI system, but I do know that several asset classes are exempt.  As I said, find an advocate that can assist you.<br>  <br>  BTW, your brother is wrong.  There is no problem with you selling your share to your uncle.  The result will be that your brother, sister, and uncle will then own an undivided 1/3 share each.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Why can't you sell it to your uncle?   There is no law against it.  If he is willing to buy your interest, sell it to him.  This is the best thing for your brother and sister, as they won't have any legal fees or have to defend themselves in federal court.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your brother would rather you deed him your share without him having to pay you anything for it.<br>  <br>  Just be aware, SSI will take the money from the money from the sale and use it to provide benefits to your son. <br>  <br>  If you give it away to your brother, SSI will take you and your brother and sister to court and rescind the giving. They will then seize the property and sell it with the proceeds going to recoup the SSI payments to your son.

So, the real question is what would the corresponding face value of bond be if it were earning $120 / year in interest, but the interest were 9%?<br>  <br>  Answer is:  $120 / .09 = $1,320 (rounded to the nearest $10).

Good for you!<br>  <br>  Here are things you can do right now: <br>  <br>  Go to the library and check out a basic book on macro-economics, so you can understand what causes stocks to go up and down.<br>  <br>  Every day, review the stock section of the paper or on the web and watch how they change up or down as daily economic news come out. Follow two or three stocks daily and get to know them. <br>  <br>  Learn how to read a company's financial report and profit and loss statements. You can write to them and they'll send it to you. <br>  <br>  If you have a few dollars that you don't mind losing, try investing under your parents' supervision.<br>  <br>  Also look into a high school program called, "Junior Achievement": www.ja.org.

The bank I'd stay away from is Citigroup.|`|0iHDwd2Waa	These are all great companies, but they've peaked.  You are looking for the next big thing.  Run away from GM or Ford.  Banking is shaky right now with talk that if the recession lasts much longer the Govt will nationalize banks.  This means shareholders will be wiped out.  With all that is going on with the stimulus package and the fact that the Fed said they fully expect to see some sort of recovery in 2010, I'd go with a mutual fund investment.  If you have the stomach for it go with a small or mid cap fund.  Risk is spread across many investments.  This class is normally the first to turn around.  If you want to roll the dice, pick a single stock and let the $10K ride.  Also, remember the more stocks you buy, the more fees you have to pay to the brokerage.  It's best to pick one option and stick with it.  Try to put yourself in the economic situation.  For example, people are falling behind on their mortgages, their choices are find a better job, cut back, sell drugs or pawn.  I invested a bit in EZPW (pawn shop).|`|43MRQ9eLaa	you should invest in somthing that people will always need... like exxon gas station... other things that are necessities now a days..|`|9r2SBjA1aa	i like ge att   bac ford     and dre

NnSCEjCFaa	It really depends on your the kind of business. I own many so I will randomly choose my Subway Restaurant that I own.<br>  <br>  1. I invested $195,000 of my own money in my business.<br>  2. I attended Northwestern University and have my Masters in Business Administration (MBA).<br>  3. I am currently struggling with my business financially with the economic down turn. Business has been drastically going down for about one and half years now. It was little better before that.<br>  4. It took me 3 years for me to earn back that money that I initially invested. I have had my business for about six years now.<br>  5. Because I have a good education and experience, with the help of my managers it seems to become easier. It seems more difficult as of right now because business is slowing down.<br>  6. The economy is holding my business, as well as many others from earning more than its potential. Also, across the street there is Jimmy Johns and Quiznos restaurant that is increasing competition.

2PDBxlYDaa	This sounds bad but for a few years I was unemployed because I had no focus and lack of ambition. Sometimes employers don't want to hear the truth. So if you lie and a lot of people lie on their interviews, then make sure that its a lie that no one will catch you with.<br>  <br>  Here's what I did on my resume. I made up a company name and then I googled it to make sure that no one had the name and then I went to yellowpages.com to make sure no one had the name in my city. I made it sound really professional. I said I worked there for five years.<br>  <br>  In interviews I say that it was small business and I worked there as a receptionist and the owners decided to retire so they shut it down and they moved to Florida to be near their grown up children and be close to their families. <br>  <br>  I wanted to pad my resume some more. So what I did, is I took a business that has failed because of the economy and I said that I worked there as a customer service rep. And trust me, lots of businesses have failed because of the economy. I'm a college student, so the jobs that I usually take aren't jobs that are going to ask me for a W-2 form.<br>  <br>  You could also say that you had to take care of a family member and that she tragically died. Just make up someone, like Aunt Grace or Uncle Ethan and that they had a tragic disease and they died. You took care of them because they had no one else and they were always there for you like your parents were there for you growing up. Remember if you are going to lie be a good actor about it and keep track of your lies.<br>  <br>  If they don't ask, then don't even bother. Sometimes its okay to take a year off to explore other ventures, people do it all the time. Just don't go on for two or three years without a job.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Dad got sick and you took care of the farm. Shows respect and family values and commitment and it hard to prove you're lying.
2PDBxlYDaa	Be yourself but also be a professional. No one wants someone pushy and arrogant but they don't want lazy people either. Look calm, but also look like a professional.

At the end of the day the employer is hiring YOU for the skills YOU have and for YOUR personality that they feel will work for them. This is the most simple approach, so long as you display the same attitude within your career, then that is a sure fire way to be recommended for other jobs in the future to do well also. This way you will become known in your industry for your confidence, competence and professionalism...and another thing I forgot to mention is to always be as honest as possible with the interviewer and with yourself. All the best in the future.
AA11125470	Allied Interstate is a real company.  At one point they were based in Minnesota.|`|HXpZmGwaaa	Allied Intersate is an collecton agency as you may well know.  They are botton line feeders.

These people are nasty, look them up on line and see the complaints.  Bad news.
ZavYSGhoaa	Yes it is true. <br>  Canceling a credit card does in fact impact your credit utilization ratio, which in turn may effect your credit score.  If you have five open credit card accounts with a total available credit line of $50,000 and an outstanding balance across all five credit cards of $10,000, your credit utilization ratio is 20 percent.  <br>  <br>  Let's say you then choose to cancel two of your credit cards, dropping your total available credit line to $25,000.  You would also be increasing your credit utilization ratio to 40 percent, and potentially lowering your credit score. <br>  <br>  Another argument against canceling a credit card has to do with age.  Not your age, but the age of your credit card account.  Your credit score is also bolstered by demonstrating a long credit history.  So if you decide to cancel a credit card you have used for some time (particularly if you used the old credit card responsibly), you will be shortening the length of your credit history. <br>  <br>  So if you must cancel a card make sure it's the newest one.<br>  <br>  If you must use a credit card try your best to pay it off in full every month or try to only utilise 1/3 of it and pay more than the minimum.<br>  <br>  You can actually make credit cards work for you too by getting those with a 1% cash back and make sure there are no annual fees.<br>  Of course you must pay it back in full each month or you'll end up paying finance fees which will be higher than the cash back bonus they give you.<br>  <br>  About reactivating. You will have to call the credit card companies individually and request them to reactivate. You may have to pay a small fee to do this. I'm not sure on their policies but if you were a good customer, paid on time and you did not cancel to long ago, they may be able to reverse it.<br>  <br>  Let me know what happens. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps some,<br>  <a href="http://www.moneymakingsecretsunveiled.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneymakingsecretsunveiled.co...</a>|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If you cancel one or some, your scores MAY go down, but they also may go up.<br>  <br>  If you cancel all, your score probably does go down, because you no longer have any open accounts.|`|kifwyOgKaa	Yes it's true.  If you have a lot, and feel you need to cancel some, always cancel the newest cards.|`|AA10500537	yes its true|`|kJ8lrDVfaa	your score may go down but don't cancel any of your credit cards that you have had a long time; just cancel the really new ones. also if you open too many your credit score may also go down.|`|74d0314d951419373b6d20225e56bf24aa	Part of your credit score is based on how much money companies will loan you.  if you cancel your cards, that amount goes down and so does your score.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	When you cancel your card make sure to tell the company to make a note in your record that you are the one doing the cancelling and it shouldn't affect your credit score.

Rrpb5aLMaa	Ok I have a very simple solution for you I just got this book and it is the most ingenious thing I have ever heard. You can remove things that belong to you. I just did it so I could get a house. Google credit repair  bible!! My lender just gave it to me but I think you might have to buy it. It is all legal though, a little bit of a pain but it was totally worth it!!!|`|5BTKscZraa	No firm can remove accurate negative info so don't waste your money. Consolidating debts into one loan won't fix your credit either...sorry<br>  <br>  If you have negative items on your credit report that involve non credit card debt, then you can try to negotiate the removal of these items with Pay for Delete agreements. This could help your credit. Unfortunately, this will not work with charged-off credit card debt. <br>  -------------------------------<br>  Negative items will fall off your credit report in 7 years as that's the max. amount of time that they can stay per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so if these debts are getting close to 7 years, just sit back and let them fall off naturally.<br>  <br>  You may be able to negotiate the complete removal of non credit card debts like defaulted cell, medical, utility bills etc. with a Pay for Delete agreement. This is a written agreement where you get a signed agreement from the debt collector (PRIOR to making any payment) where they offer to remove the negative items from your credit files after an agreed-to amount is paid. They will NOT want to do this....all they want is your money and their commission and they could not care less about your credit rating....Still, you have something they want (money) and that puts you in a position to negotiate on this issue. Example letter:<br>  <br>  I am willing to resolve this issue if your firm sends me a written agreement that you will remove all negative notations from my credit report after the agreed-to amount is paid to you. Upon receipt of this letter I will mail you a USPS money order for this amount. <br>  ---------------------------------- <br>  Again, they are not going to want to do this...if they simply refuse...then go for a "Paid/settled" in full notation....If they refuse to remove the item from your credit report, then be sure to get the lowest, rock bottom settlement you can get...like 25%....Remember, get all terms IN WRITING PRIOR to paying....not after. Never give debt collectors your checking account numbers for payment.|`|jWO10NN5aa	You can't really "repair" it in that sense of the word, no matter what anyone tells you.  If you want to pay me a fee, 'll do it for you, because it's really quite simple.<br>  <br>  In most cases, credit "repair" is just the process of sending letters to the three credit bureaus claiming that a negative item on your credit report does not belong to you, you never had that account, or some such lie.  The way the Fair Credit Reporting Act works is the credit bureuas have to investigate each dispute letter they receive.  They do this by sending an inquiry to the creditor asking the creditor to verify the accuracy of the item. Now, here's the catch, and how "credit repair" agencies work - the original creditor has 30 days to submit a verification to the credit bureau.  If the creditor messes up and does not do that within the 30 days, the credit bureau MUST remove the negative item from your credit report.  Send enough dispute letters (all HAND written) and sooner or later someone will mess up and not do the verification in time.  It's that simple.  Because this usually means sending out several dispute letters for the same item, and since it takes at least 30 days (more like 60 by the time the credit bureau gets back to you) it can take a year or two to get things off.  The key is to keep disputing and disputing and disputing.<br>  <br>  There is nothing that a credit repair outfit can do for you that you cannot do got yourself.|`|HMfAIQLQaa	I have been to "many" different credit repair sites on the web.

16vMIGPiaa	The Credit River Decision is one the government dodge folks trot out as justification for...  what I cannot tell.  It's a bit like declaring income tax is unconstitutional; go ahead and try - you'll just end up going to jail.  <br>  Credit River was a particular case of bad banking financial management almost 40 years ago.  It was touted as "landmark" at the time but apparently it was so narrow as to be useless as precedent.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - foreclosures occur because somebody did not adhere to the terms of a financial contract.  Contract law is long standing and iron clad.  The only way contracts fail to be enforceable is when they are badly written or badly executed.
uWA0D2zAaa	Yes, you have to make less than this amount to live there.  And the amount is gross, not net, so it's before taxes.  If you look on your paycheck stub, find the line that says YTD Gross.  What the community will do is take that amount, and do a calculation that stretches it across 1 year.<br>  <br>  Let's say you have year to date a gross income of $2500 as of 2/13/09.<br>  <br>  The calculation would be 2500/6 weeks = 146.67 per week<br>  146.67 x 52 weeks = 21666.67<br>  So you qualify if you are living alone under the 1 person income limit.  Your yearly income would be $21,666.67.<br>  <br>  You also have to include any assets you may have over $5000.  These assets don't include personal belongings or a car, but things like 401k or investment accounts, trust funds, rental property, things like that.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	No..it means that you can NOT make more that the listed amount.|`|suWnr83laa	Are these the specific complexes guidelines?

oJsrGmmPaa	Yeah, most definitely, but make sure that 2Gs is enough for you in case of whatever unforeseen financial emergency. Now that I think about it, pay off ten thousand of it, and then the remaining next month. That way, you'll be covered a bit more.|`|UIuk5Sisaa	You should probably consider keeping 3-6 months worth of you monthly income saved up just in case in emergency comes up, and use the rest to pay off a big chunk of the loan (Example: If you make $3,000 a month keep $9,000 in the savings and use the $7000 left over to pay off half the loan). Then maybe make bigger monthly payments to pay the loan off quicker. I would be very cautious about paying the whole $14,000, unless you think the $2,000 is enough to cover unexpected expenses.|`|FF94QuKxaa	First of all, good for you not being in debt.  Now, the only thing is, just in case life throws you a curve ball, you have a little cushion right now.  However, if you pay off the car, you have no car note.

With everything going on right now, you want to be as far out of debt as possible.  You will still have 2k cushion and you can grow your savings back by another thousand every couple of months.  Unless your savings is at a higher interest rate than your car loan, you're losing money by having enough money to pay it off and choosing not to.  Just be sure that for the next year or so you're extra frugal and set aside every extra penny for savings just in case things get worse.

They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	I once sold a car to a friend who failed to transfer title.  She sold it to someone else who sold it again.  All without title transfer.  The vehicle was found abandoned in a nearby town and the local police wanted the towing and parking penalties paid.  I signed a statement indicating the date sold so all the activity the car was involved in after I got rid of it were removed from my record.  Because the car was used in a bank robbery I was glad to get clear of it.  But for at least a year after I would get notices of traffic and parking tickets and I would sent them copies of my sale statement. I think that is what you are calling your liability release.  Once you submit it to DMV (I am also in CA) any events surrounding the vehicle after the date it was transferred are no longer attached to you.<br>  You did not mention what the garnishments were for so it may take separate action to remove and recover the garnishment. Fines should be easy to recover but if it was debt owned on the bike the loan company may not be willing to give you back your money until it collects from your bf.<br>  <br>  Edit; once DMV clears the title on the date you specify they should cancel the garnishment.  They may require you to wait for what has already been garnished until they collect from him. I know they were very helpful with all my paperwork and tickets assigned to me.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Question is did you sign or cosign the loan with your ex bf.

You need to establish a market (or your buyer in general) to the products or services you plan to sell.  I have already answered a similar question relating to opening small business (I provide the link later as my source):<br>  <br>  1. ask your self first if the business you want to put up is something you can tend to on a day to day basis, including weekends. take the quiz from forbes.com for small business or entrepreneur first.<br>  <br>  2. come up with a business plan. this is specially important if you are taking partners with you on the business.<br>  <br>  3. establish your finances by coming up with figures for start up capital and the amount for your operating expenses that should last you a certain period (e.g., 3, 6 months just in case there are not great sales)<br>  <br>  4. accept that there are times you will incur loss or only break even. <br>  <br>  cheers!|`|f1jReGLGaa	The best place would be inside malls because you are guaranteed a constant supply of people.

Pjm9pg7iaa	You do not have to follow a career. Buy a camcorder for $250. Buy a tripod stand for it (or better yet, make your own) so you can take stable pictures. Then start filming your friends and family who will work as your "actors".  Set up different scenes: indoor scenes with people talking; outdoor action scenes.<br>  Watch what you filmed and critique yourself. You will learn some tricks. Then produce a 22 minute show that you can offer to the local tv station. Leave 8 minutes for commercials.<br>  You are now  a "Producer".  It is a wonderful life. You can buy the expensive cameras with your profits from the first venture..

One site that I personally use and love is free to join, unlike most 'money making sites' out there. <br>  <br>  Basically what you do is fill out free surveys and offers, and they pay you to do this. They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month.

If you do loose your job and have to file for Chapter 7, this will give you a head start without having to obligate yourself to anything. <br>  <br>  Contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate much lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.<br>  <br>  They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.<br>  <br>  Please note that CCCS cannot perform miracles in situations where there is an overwhelming level of debt relative to your income/assets.<br>  ==================<br>  Stay far, far away from debt settlement firms....they deliberately let your accounts default to attempt settlements....It's a risky process and you could end up in court with judgements against you. Same thing if you try to do this yourself with deliberately defaulting on your debt...it's a roll of the dice...it may work and they may settle...or they may sue and you'll end up with judgements again you. <br>  <br>  If you do loose your job, Chapter 7 may be the best option.|`|KaaHCSPkaa	Read the Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, He is awesome and gives you a step by step program to get out of debt and stay out of debt, without filing for bankruptcy.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	I would file for bankruptcy if I were you.

bVHnNqzBaa	It is quite possible that an unethical seller can get away with this. This is a perfect example of why eBay shopping and buying things on-line is quite risky. Many people never have problems. Some do, and when they do it's truly awful. Next time, buy from someone in person through craigslist or a brick and mortar store.|`|d6322d6851d8d95adc75a8613fec4e77aa	So, first of all Has the seller deleted himself from eBay?  Has it been less than 45 days?  You can file a dispute with eBay and go from there.  Also, check the credit card company that you used and see what they can do for you.  If the seller is still on eBay you need to write to him, thru eBay, and if not, put together a dispute.

If not, it may be hard if your score is less than 600.  With substantial income and 600+ Im sure you can get one - just look around and ask questions before you have someone run your credit.  Tell them your score and ask them if they can work with you.

You must pay 2 years of back taxes. The money must be paid in cash or cashiers check in 24 hours. If the owner of the house does not pay for 3 more years, you can go to court and get the deed. If he doesn't pay for 5 more years (7 total) you don't have to go to court; the Treasurer hands you a deed. All mortgages are wiped out. If the owner pays up later, you get all your money back plus interest (16% or more).<br>  The only "issue" is that 5 of the properties i got were so flawed that they had no value. i had wasted my money and wished i had never heard of Tax Lien Certificates.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I caution you to thoroughly research this stuff.

The remainder of states fall somewhere between the two extremes.<br>  <br>  The biggest pitfall is you buy a tax certificate and can't find the guy to collect the money owed, or the guy simply is a bum and you can't collect from him.<br>  <br>  If they were a sure thing to make money on, everyone would be doing them.
ZyjiVTy5aa	You're definitely blessed to know that you don't like what you are doing. Instead of looking up 30-40 yrs later and realizing that you're retiring from a career that you hate, you should definitely start doing what you like while you can. <br>  Make the most of the three months, there is a reason that you know that this job is not your "thing" and so many people waste their lives doing what they don't like just to get paid. The secret is that when you are operating in the gift that God gave you , you will not only enjoy your job but doors will begin to open so that you will be taken care of financially as well.<br>   So in the next few months prepare your transition into doing what you will enjoy (ex: save up money, figure out what you enjoy doing, focus in on your gifts, see what jobs are available for you etc. )  If you prepare then the transition will be one that you won't have to explain your last job because it will be an open door and make sense. Also, you want to make sure that you take the time to go to the right job for you so that you will not keep deciding every three months what you don't like.This way it will be a smooth transition. Hope that this helps!|`|f6y3pM4oaa	From what I learnt from my own experience and friends' experience as owners of businesses, employers do not like people who constantly keep on changing jobs. If you plan to tell your employer that quit your last job because you did not like it at all, employers will wonder if you are going to do the same thing to them especially since you plan to quit in 3 months which is really really short. Employers always try to look ways in how to reduce cost by hiring efficient employees and you must know that whenever you start in a new company, employers need to train you and training is an expense for them. <br>  <br>  I will strongly suggest you to avoid telling your new interviewer that you quit your last job only because you didnt enjoy it. You could maybe say that the company where you used to work because was smaller and you wanted greater chances for career advancement and that's why you are looking into their company which gives you more opportunity of developing your skills.|`|CwUfTQVtaa	You could Build a Real Profitable Business Online.<br>  <br>  I done it.<br>  <br>  Let's Have a Look to the Most Incredible Tutorial to Build a Website that Works.<br>  <br>  And the Best is that you don't need to be a "Techi".

WYjbuu6saa	You'll be wasting your money if you study Law.<br>  <br>  Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in!!  Many reasons.  Main reason?.....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Lawyers - we have a GLUT of Attorneys!<br>  <br>  The law schools won't tell you this - they continue to churn out graduates even though they know the market/economy is SATURATED.  But law students are easy money for law schools - they have to make very little investment in a law student.<br>  <br>  And even IF you would finish law school, you probably won't be able to find a job when you are done.......unless you have a mommy or a daddy who is the senior partner of a law firm.  Plus you'll owe approx $150,000 in debts.  <br>  <br>  SUGGESTION:  Consider and look into the field of HEALTHCARE! <<<<br>  This is where the jobs are!  and LOTS of scholarships!!<br>  <br>  Another suggestion:  Go visit your Guidance Counselor.  Ask about taking a "vocational test".  This won't be a real test - this will be more about your talents, interests, and abilities.  This will steer you toward the vocational field that is better suited for you - this is a REALLY GOOD INVESTMENT!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

Finding a job in the legal industry is very hard with no post secondary studies; therefore, you could maybe volunteer or you might also read more articles, talk with lawyers about their careers (Some people just love to help others). Indeed, The reason why I am telling you this is because I truly believe that the only way for you to succeedd in your field is by loving what you are doing. You don't wanna do something that you dont really like for the rest of your life. Example is me, I graduated from International Business Administration and I really loved that field, Somehow after graduation I ended up opening a restaurant because I was looking into making money fast rather than creating the foundation for my future career. I did suceed in the restaurant business; however, I do not get a personal satisfaction from it and I do not enjoy it at all. My plans are to sell my business and start my career in the International Business field from the beginning. I did in fact wasted 10 years of my life; however, I do not think it is too late.

If starting over, 75 percent of lawyers would choose to do something else. A similar percentage would advise their children not to become lawyers. The work is often contentious, and there's pressure to be unethical. And despite the drama portrayed on TV, real lawyers spend much of their time on painstakingly detailed research. In addition, those fat-salaried law jobs go to only the top few percent of an already high-powered lot.<br>  <br>  Many people go to law school hoping to do so-called public-interest law. (In fact, much work not officially labeled as such does serve the public interest.) What they don't teach in law school is that the competition for those jobs is intense.

This is likely to cause an increase in malpractice claims, although the claims may be relatively small in size due to the limited nature of a new lawyers<br>  <br>  “In a survey conducted back in 1972 by the American Bar Association, seventy percent of Americans not only didn’t have a lawyer, they didn’t know how to find one.

Now it’s almost impossible not to see lawyers everywhere you turn."<br>  <br>  Growth of Legal Sector<br>  Lags Broader Economy; Law Schools Proliferate<br>  For graduates of elite law schools, prospects have never been better. Big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as $160,000. But the majority of law-school graduates are suffering from a supply-and-demand imbalance that's suppressing pay and job growth. The result: Graduates who don't score at the top of their class are struggling to find well-paying jobs to make payments on law-school debts that can exceed $100,000. Some are taking temporary contract work, reviewing documents for as little as $20 an hour, without benefits. And many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market.<br>  <br>  The law degree that Scott Bullock gained in 2005 from Seton Hall University -- where he says he ranked in the top third of his class -- is a "waste," he says. Some former high-school friends are earning considerably more as plumbers and electricians than the $50,000-a-year Mr. Bullock is making as a personal-injury attorney in Manhattan. To boot, he is paying off $118,000 in law-school debt.<br>  <br>  A slack in demand appears to be part of the problem. The legal sector, after more than tripling in inflation-adjusted growth between 1970 and 1987, has grown at an average annual inflation-adjusted rate of 1.2% since 1988, or less than half as fast as the broader economy, according to Commerce Department data.<br>  <br>  On the supply end, more lawyers are entering the work force, thanks in part to the accreditation of new law schools and an influx of applicants after the dot-com implosion earlier this decade. In the 2005-06 academic year, 43,883 Juris Doctor degrees were awarded, up from 37,909 for 2001-02, according to the American Bar Association. Universities are starting up more law schools in part for prestige but also because they are money makers. Costs are low compared with other graduate schools and classrooms can be large. Since 1995, the number of ABA-accredited schools increased by 11%, to 196.<br>  <br>  According to the Internal Revenue Service, the inflation-adjusted average income of sole practitioners has been flat since the mid-1980s. A recent survey showed that out of nearly 600 lawyers at firms of 10 lawyers or fewer in Indiana, wages for the majority only kept pace with inflation or dropped in real terms over the past five years.<br>  <br>  Many students "simply cannot earn enough income after graduation to support the debt they incur," wrote Richard Matasar, dean of New York Law

AA10554783	The Ten Best Places to Live <br>  Posted by Rita Bacot Scott, Broker, Sanctuary Real Estate<br>  The Ten Best Places to Live <br>  November 2008<br>  Provided by : Sperling's Best Places<br>  <br>  <br>  These ten places are each special in their own way. The only downside may be that it's hard to keep a secret, so most of them have seen considerable increases in home prices over the last couple of years.<br>  <br>  ·         Atlanta, GA<br>  Atlanta is the largest city in our Top 10 Best Places to Live, having recently experienced a huge population boom. The crossroads of the South has become especially popular with young people looking for a sunny and exciting urban center that is easy on the checkbook, with its reasonable cost of living. Indeed, the city's affordable homes (median home price $164,100) and robust economy (high per-capita income) make Atlanta an excellent choice for young people concerned with value. The South has a reputation for oppressive heat and humidity, but statistically Atlanta has a warm and pleasant climate. Throw in four pro sports teams, great restaurants, and a diverse arts scene and Atlanta emerges a sizzling city on the move.<br>  <br>  ·         Charlottesville, VA<br>  Nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, most areas of this idyllic city are accessible by foot or bicycle. Charlottesville enjoys clean air and water, and pleasant weather year-round, highlighted by especially beautiful fall foliage. Nearby Shenandoah National Park offers a wealth of recreation opportunities. Charlottesville is home to the University of Virginia, which strengthens the area's healthy economy by providing steady jobs and a wealth of amenities and entertainment. Homes are not cheap (median home price $225,000), but the cost of living is manageable. The city's low unemployment rate and significant recent job growth promise continued prosperity. As more and more people learn about this year's best city, Charlottesville may find staying affordable and sprawl-free is its greatest challenge! <br>  <br>  ·         Santa Fe, NM<br>  Home to over 250 art galleries and the new Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, Santa Fe has long been a haven for artists. Perched high in the desert mountains, Santa Fe's air is crisp and clean. Daytime temperatures are mild, though the nights are often cold. The city is surrounded by over 1.5 million acres of national forest, offering excellent hiking, camping, and downhill skiing. Recently, Santa Fe has seen its population skyrocket as the city has become a relocation hotspot for affluent Americans. Despite its recent growth, Santa Fe remains relatively affordable, with a median home price of $365,000. <br>  <br>  ·         San Luis Obispo- Atascadero- Paso Robles, CA <br>  This quiet group of towns on the central California coast could easily qualify as paradise. The climate is among the country's most pleasant, with 285 mostly sunny days per year and temperatures rarely above 90 degrees, or below freezing. The presence of academic heavyweight Cal Poly helps anchor the local economy- the unemployment rate is well below the national average. It's fortunate that local jobs are plentiful, since it's too far to commute to Los Angeles or the Bay Area. Considering further its low crime and unemployment rates, the San Luis Obispo area seems to have it all. But home prices here have risen steadily in the last few years, so that the median is now $536,300. While this isn't unreasonable by California standards, it can be out of reach for many of us thinking of moving from other parts of the country. <br>  <br>  ·         Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-Lompoc, CA<br>  A few miles north of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara has long been a #1 relocation choice for those who can afford it. This area is famous for lavish estates that carry a price tag in the millions of dollars. Indeed, the median home price for the county is $590,000, and your average house in the city itself is over $1.2 million. No matter how appealing, the Santa Barbara area's cost of living and home prices will prove prohibitive for many Americans. In addition, recent job growth has dipped lately, so it might not be the best place to look for a new job. Nevertheless, for those that are retired or financially secure, the Santa Barbara area remains one of unmatched beauty and comfort.<br>  <br>  ·         Honolulu, HI<br>  Everyone knows that Honolulu is a great place to vacation, but what about putting down roots in Hawaii's capital city? After a slow start, home appreciation is taking off like a rocket as well-to-do mainlanders are looking for a place to invest, and enjoy. The laid-back and easy-going attitude of the islands is infectious and helps explain the low violent crime rate. Restaurants, eager to please the international tourist clientele, are excellent and numerous. For the same reason, entertainment options are various and exciting. Even Honolulu's economy is remarkable\x97the unemployment rate is low and recent job growth is well above the national average. There are some downsides to consider.

There are only two prices to anything, the price you paid and the price you can get.<br>  <br>  My family is vested into lots of real estate.  My mother buys things all the time.  I was working on a project with her not that long ago where she was looking at an apartment building to buy.  She didn't buy it.  Price was great, number were good, solid investment.  When I asked her why she didn't buy it all she had to say was, "I would have never lived there."  I got to talking with her about this.  She runs all of her investments based off of the notion that she will have to live in them if things get really bad.  She does well.  She assumes that all of her investments need to be something she likes and is proud to say she owns.<br>  <br>  The markets are great everywhere right now if you can get the financing.  Decide where you want to buy, and look.  All markets of the U.S. are buyers markets right now.|`|Kg681jL8aa	in melbourne, somewhere between 250,000 and 2,500,000.<br>  depends which suburbs and at what price.

The fact of the matter is that there is a high rate of injuries based on ligament damage and sprained knees and ankles. <br>  <br>  It is a job I loved because I took pride in no matter what I did. I didn't care what people thought. I worked hard, got paid well and had free time. I never took anything home from work (mentally).

mQZDizMVaa	"They're good friends..." That's the key sentence here and a no-win situation-unless and until you document certain scenarios, i.e.:<br>  <br>  The next time that 'someone' lies and tells your boss you left earlier-ask outright: "Who told you this? You have proof? If not, it's hearsay, if so, it's a lie. You shouldn't listen to hearsay and/or lies" and walk right out. Document-date, supervisor's full name/title and what you're supposedly accused of doing, i.e. leaving early. Exact words. If you believe your coworker was part of this-include her full name and title and also the fact your supervisor's always in her office-everytime she walks in there-document the time. Of couse they can claim they're 'discussing business' but documenting can refute that if that supervisor's in there much too often .<br>  <br>  Ask your boss if you could sign in/out, including time arrived/left-and he initial it. Tell him the reason being "someone" lied on you. If he refuses-document that fact, including date spoken to him. Then go to go to your HR dept. and ask if you can sign in/out, complete with whoever's in charge in HR's signature. If you do this, give him/her a copy of your first request to your supervisor and include the date given. Get a copy of your week's attendance from HR.<br>  <br>  By documenting you're getting a handle of the situation and building your self-confidence, which is easy to lose in a situation like what you're in. In essence, you're saying to yourself: "How dare they treat me like this! I'll 'fight back' by quietly documenting." <br>  <br>  Supervisor wants you to tell her when you're going to the restroom??Kids in school have to ask if they can use the restroom. You're not in school. I'd keep going to the restroom as often as necessary-it's none of her business. You're still doing your work. Document the fact she's causing a personal health issue of yours to get worse by saying you "have to tell her" and if necessary, get a note from your doctor, make a copy and put that copy in your HR file.<br>  <br>  I hope this doesn't happen to you, but in case you're fired on the hearsay and lies of this coworkersupervisor "team", your chonological documentation will look very good to your lawyer.<br>  <br>  Sorry this was long-but I've been there. Kiss-ups are everywhere in the workplace, unfortunately. The best way to get them to leave you alone is by ignoring them and documenting at the same time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vTQN4QAzaa	find a new job.|`|kGQ1BK17aa	this dose happen for many people not only you ,,try not to distract yourself with what are going on around you and focus on your job and one day they will get bored spaying on you but if you can't put up with this ,calm yourself dowen and act normally as you usually do until you find another job ,,,,,

AA12074269	I couldnt determine whether you were after non-food related jobs or that you have no food experience. If the latter, I would suggest going to the local TAFE and taking a barista course, when you turn 18 take a responsibility in the serving of alcohol course - this will set you up to work in any bar, pub or coffee shop/cafe as a first job.<br>  <br>  Then you can look inside yourself to see what type of career you are looking for.|`|ZGcNgRX0aa	how far into high school did you go? year 10? year 9? there are plenty of oppurtunities available. email me and i will help you out if you want.<br>  it also depends on where you live, gorgraphically you may be in a hot spot for work and not know it. I'm sure we can find you somthing that doesnt involve food.|`|WxDuKF0Caa	Well the best thing you can do for yourself at 17 is to get educated. Look at your interests and what you enjoy doing and consider what course you would like to do. The best thing you could do for yourself and your future would be to finish high school rather than leave it too late. At least finish high school and then that will give you time to consider what it is you would really like to do, and by doing this you will be presented with better options for your future life.<br>  Alternatively there are a lot apprenticeships you can consider doing that will set you in good stead for the future. My sister started an apprenticeship at 17 and by the age of 21 was already set up in her career as a chef. Now at 30 she can pick any job she wants. If you need assistance to get started and do not have the means to get started and require accomodation and food etc...the best people to contact would be your local christian church or the salvos who do a lot of work with youth in your situation and can probably help you find accomodation and get you started on the right track.

Why?<br>  <br>  McDonalds: Apparently they have some good program or something for you. But, I think some McDonalds are Open 24 Hours and most if not not all have the Drive-Thru 24 Hours.

(All Pizza places Deliver Pizzas 24 Hours I'm 99% Sure) Therefore you are taking the risk of working again like McDonalds late at night or early in the morning. The area you make or cook the pizza isn't that bad, depending if you are cooking or not.<br>  <br>  Subway: Very good. Most people tend to eat the most at the fast food restaurant they work or worked at (sometimes) and if you're working at McDonalds or Little Caesers you could get very fat over time, and you somewhat get "addicted".

2TtPf4BSaa	They must have some suspicion about your return, but if you have all of your documentation and are on the up an up, nothing to really worry about.  Be able to prove your claim.  The IRS can audit even over $1 if they feel like it, but they can also be mistaken so be meticulous with your paper work and things should be cleared up.  Keep a small cushion of cash in the bank just in case because you don't want penalty fees added on to what they may decide you owe.

qWytoOMmaa	You are dealing with companies that have some form of a centralized recruiting processes.  I'm a recruiter and am flooded with resumes daily and I work for a small company.  Large companies get exponentially more response, and have to deal with them accordingly.<br>  <br>  The first example is probably a recruiter who is responsible for a candidate pipeline for a function group within their company.  In all likelihood, they are hiring for several nationwide locations.  It is also likely that the recruiter has never met or been to the office that you applied to.  It's a cost saving measure on the part of the company.<br>  <br>  The second example is most likely an outsource recruiting company that takes over the recruiting function for large companies.  They are validating their candidate database - and according to you have gone back to at least Aug. of 2007.  The person on the phone probably knew exactly who they are recruiting for, but is holding back that information to ensure the pipeline of candidates stays with them until you interview with their client (the company you originally applied to),<br>  <br>  A word of advice:  Nobody has anything to lose by being professional and asking questions.  However, getting defensive or "snippy" could be the end of your possible employment with their client - forever.|`|AA11266093	yes so much, many companies they say apply online only or send a resume, and if you are lucky you get a interview, and still it is only a interview!<br>  <br>  And to be able to speak to the actual hiring person is the hardest, and many times companies have more than one person interview you!, so speak about being put on the spot, and having the interview process even harder.<br>  <br>  finding work is more like the companies make it so hard to get hired!(as if they don't want to hire anyone, and make it like so many tests of patience, and time and it does make things worse instead of better)

Of course if you can take it this year why wait til your 2009 tax return.|`|AA10469473	You get it with your 2009 return that you'll file in 2010.|`|AA11284831	DwA is correct.  You can claim the $8k credit for a 2009 purchase as long as you close on the purchase before you file your tax return.<br>  <br>  It appears that many tax pros are not yet aware of this.  The IRS just released the new version of Form 5405 this past Saturday.  That's gotta be a world's record for the IRS as it often takes them many months to publish implementing instructions and new forms in response to changes in the Tax Code.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Yes, you CAN claim the $8k credit on your 2008 return!

However, you must be willing to accept rejection and move on.<br>  <br>  There is no substitute for what insurance can do.|`|q4GVYl0raa	I work at Primerica Financial Services. I don't consider myself a life insurance agent, but I am licensed to sell it. My income fluctuates because some months I don't work and others I do. On average, I make about $500 from selling term insurance. Plus I earn bonuses, which I'm not sure how they calculate it, but its well over $100 in bonuses. I also have licensed sales people under me and if they sell life insurance, they get paid full commissions and I earn an override (which is the difference my sales level and their sales level). They too get bonuses and I earn overrides on those bonuses. <br>  <br>  This commission payout from Primerica is so insane that anybody can make tons of money (that is, if they go to work). I mean, we're in a recession, and this company is paying bonuses to everyone.<br>  <br>  But the bulk of my income comes from debt elimination loans where I get paid anywhere from $1000 to $2000, depending on the size of the loan.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	I work with a company called Customplan Financial Advisors.

S**t happens.|`|pOHVhVqgaa	Unfortunately its unfair but your gonna end up having to pay it, I promise you. The exact same thing happened to me, and no water and sewer does NOT have to be billed by the same company. My water is county water but I pay my sewer to the city and when I moved into my rental I had no idea I needed to call and set up that separate account, well 3 years later I received a bill for $2500. The stupid lady at the water company told me if I knew I wasn't getting a bill I should have called and told them, now how silly is that, if I knew I was suppose to be getting a bill I would have paid it!!! Needless to say me and my husband went down there and argued how it was wrong that it shouldn't be our fault they didn't sent a bill we didn't know we were suppose to get, but sure enough we got nowhere and still had to set up a payment plan in order to not be disconnected. Just call and set up the plan and make the payments, your not going to win. By the way they did take off all the late fees which were $2100, so the actual bill we ended up paying was $600, and my mom worked at the place we pay for water!|`|AA11206283	Public jurisdictions can apply utility liens as they see fit for unpaid bills in most states.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	It depends on who determined she was not supposed to put the eviction on your record.    If you owe her money still she is well within her right to place the eviction, and as a landlord I appreciate her efforts, I will know better then to trust you.<br>  <br>  Did she agree and sign the deal that your attorney wrote?   If she did sign it and you did not break the agreement then you might be able to have the same judge that issued the eviction remove it (has to be the same one).   <br>  <br>  You will need to sue her for breach of contract.   Since you will have the eviction on there for 10 years it should be worth your time.|`|AA11173563	I am sure the atty has the paper work where she made written agreements|`|ej9ijnS7aa	You/atty have in WRITING that the LL would not put an eviction on your records?

They might send you a statement telling you how much you put in and how much you gained or lost in value last year, but it has nothing to do with your taxes. The money you put in was already removed from the gross income that your company reported to the IRS on your W-2, so the reduction in taxable income happens automatically.|`|RY1xuwzoaa	No, the amount of your contributions will be on your W-2.<br>  <br>  You might get a statement, but since you're not actually "realizing" any of the gains or losses of your 401k account balance, there's nothing for taxes you need to do.

It won't take you long to save some more money for an emergency when you aren't paying credit card repayments.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about having NO savings, keep a couple of hundred dollars stashed in your savings account and use the rest of your savings to minimize your debt.

If your interest rate on your credit card is higher than the interest rate that you are getting from your savings account, then you should pay off your card.  (Put the money that you saved from paying the card on time into your savings account so that you are replenishing your savings.)  If you have one of the 0% interest rates at this time, then I would make a card payment, but not pay it off in full, unless you are planning on applying for credit (new car, etc) soon.  If you are, the amount on your cc bill is usually the amount which shows on your credit report (which could put you into a higher risk category for your new loan).|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I would do a half and half, pay off half from your savings ( so you still have half in case of emergencies) and then pay down the rest.

No one cares more than the parents, and you don't want it to seem fun like candy... the drugs are ultimately helping them get to their future. Since it's such a tough reality, you don't want to remind them of it (ie controlled like never before, don't panic - although it'll be important to mention that attributes that set it apart) -you want to focus on the good that comes out of it... the effect. Caring for their future, Because they are our future. just one person's opinion.

2TtPf4BSaa	If your parents have a lot of things they no longer use lying around the house, ask them if you can take charge of selling the items online for them using eBay,CraigsList, Kijiji etc... You can place all the online ads for free and learn about online marketing at the same time. The skills you will learn can later be applied to any other business ideas you have. <br>  <br>  You'll be helping your parents get rid of old items and make some money (which you will obviously have to split with them because it's their stuff), but it's definitely worth considering. You may be surprised at their reaction knowing they have a budding Internet Entrepreneur in the house! <br>  <br>  If this works out you can approach other family members, friends, neighbors, referrals and build a solid network of contacts that you can offer this service to.

AA11598210	~~Do not pay any company to do surveys, they are a scam. There are legitimate sites which will pay you or give you points which you can turn in for merchandise or gift cards. <br>  <br>  I have a few I have done surveys for years with. I can honestly tell you, you won;t make much money. With one company I make enough to pay for all my make-up because I turn in points for gift cards.Another, gives me points and I get one or two nice things a year for my home. like small kitchen apppliances, an ear thermometer, some earrings, etc.<br>  <br>  They do not really pay much and you have to do allot of surveys to get anything. I did one company for over a year and received an $80 check and still had $20 left, so it gives you an idea of how small the pay is.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind doing them, just to get stuff once in a while, they're fun. I get to sample and survey allot of products also, but it took over three years before they started offering me these things. <br>  <br>  If you really need extra income, they aren't gonna work for you. Not one of the companies ever charged me a dime. Legitimate ones will not. So I would not do the one you mentioned.~~|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Yes, your financial risks are, first, the $35 you spend for someone to scam you.

They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month.

File you 2007 first, which must be mailed in.  <br>  Then file 2008 about 3-4 weeks after.

wtegoBQWaa	Yes! This is such a good idea! Being a CNA is a good job and you can obtain it in one semester from a community college which is the best way!  <br>  <br>  If you don't mind me saying, i am going to start college this summer to persue my RN at a community college, i would recommend maybe instead of getting you CNA at your community college maybe get your LVN instead. That way you can work part time being an LVN(you get better pay with less nasty jobs) and bridge from an LVN to an RN through the same community college and have your AS degree in nursing in a year depending on the program. Then you will be an RN and will be able to bridge to your BSN in just 9 months.<br>  <br>  But if you really want to be an CNA than go for it cause there is nothing holding you back!<br>  <br>  When renewing your CNA license(you don't have to renew certificate once you get it but, cause once you complete the course and get your certificate you must apply to get you license which must be renewed every two year.) you must just show that you have completed three working hours to renew it.

AA11984287	First, yes you should be thankful that your husband has a job. However, that does let his boss out of his legal obligations. Federal regulations state that you must have a date that you are paid and you must be paid on that day (unless the specified date falls on a weekend). this is kind of a moot point, however, if your husband is not willing to push the point.  My advice would be to sit down with your husband in at a non-threatening time (not when he is supposed to have the check in his hand) and tell him that you are fearful about this and it is causing you some serious stress. Then, and here is the most important part, listen to his answer and respect what he says even if you don't like it.  If your husband is worried about losing his job if he pushes the issue, respect that and learn to roll with it. Your marriage is MUCH more important than money or when it comes in.  Remember you married for richer or poorer. Think of the paycheck delay as the "poorer" part and love him through it.|`|03831b0e788ab59d4158feb2416700a1aa	It depends on if you are paid under the table or not. If your husbands job is a legit source of income, meaning you pay taxes on it and file it as his legal job, then by law the boss has to pay your husband on time. If its under the table money, and it is not listed on your taxes as a source of income, then the best you can do is talk to a lawyer about taking him to  small claims court|`|RY1xuwzoaa	It's his job, his boss, and they have the relationship.  Don't interfere, it will only backfire.  Just let him handle it and don't complain - as you said, at least he's working and you know his boss is good for it even if he's not timely.  You'll just have to work around it until he finds something better.  It's a bad economy and you're a whole lot better off worrying about *when* he gets paid then you are worrying about *IF* he even has a job :P<br>  <br>  No sense nagging him into nagging his boss who might be having troubles too and decide it's not worth the hassle and let him go :O|`|9Wi2eNInaa	You have to get some Zen in your life. You are making yourself miserable over something that has been going on for over a year.<br>  <br>  The marital stress isn't because of your husband's boss--- it's because of you.<br>  <br>   My first wife used to get very upset about my work also. It gets to the point that the stress from the wife is far greater than the stress from work, so the outcome is you come home wasted in energy because you know of the fight your going to have. Most men want to please their wife and children. If a wife isn't pleased it magnifies all the husband's stresses exponentially.<br>  <br>  Your husband's boss has other employee's that don't get paid on time, so he isn't singling your husband out. Your husband appears to be a lot smarter than you think, because he obviously knows what to tell his boss and I'm sure he leaves out the comments from you. It seems he likes his work, but can he say the same thing about his home life?<br>  <br>  He's happy, his boss is happy, the other employees are happy--but you are not. If you don't get an attitude adjustment, you are headed for divorce. I know so many good guys that gave up because they couldn't make their wives happy.<br>  <br>  Your options are these-- he gets another job; you get a job; you or he start a business; you learn to live with what you have and find peace in your mind somehow|`|AA12107238	I understand your frustration, but you can't and should not do anything about it.  It is your husbands job, your husbands boss, and your husbands responsibility to handle the situation as he sees fit.  I am positive that your husband is well aware that his pay is late without you reminding him.  (he probably feels like your nagging).  It will be difficult because I am sure you want to help your husband and take matter in your own hands but my best advice it to stay out of it and drop it, let your man be a man and handle it himself.
Hx88UGlpaa	No....with the new laws passed in Oct of 2005, you can no longer pick and chose what you file. All of the debt has to be submitted in a chapter 7 filing. The only thing you can pick is if you are going to keep a home or vehicle and re affirm on the loan. You can get more information at www.usbankruptcy.gov    Good Luck!|`|kbJt4065aa	You absolutely MUST list every single debtor on your bankruptcy. Not including even a single one will be considered 'preferential' treatment and will get you in trouble in bankruptcy court. You have to include every single one. <br>  Now, there is an 'intent' sheet but it is only for secured debts. It's called "Form 8" "Statement of Intention" and you include all secured debts on that, like car loans and mortgages. Then you select basically whether you will surrender the property securing the loan or 'reaffirm' the loan. <br>  When you reaffirm the loan, your stuck with it, but it can be a good thing to do in some cases. I'm surrendering my home in chapter 7, but keeping my car as I have a great interest rate on it and owe less then the car is worth. <br>  The point of bankruptcy though is to become 'debt-free'. Generally you only want to reaffirm the bare minimum. <br>  Now, if there's a credit card you liked or another account that you liked, you can in some cases pay on it after your bankruptcy has been discharged. You'll want to contact the company though before you start making payments after bankruptcy. Just because you pay it off even though it's discharged doesn't mean they'll let you continue to use the account, but they'll sure let you pay on it!<br>  There's a credit card I'd like to keep after it's all said and done. But, I won't be paying them a dime if they won't let me use the card once I've paid it down.<br>  <br>  The only way you don't have to list a creditor on your bankruptcy is if you owe them $0. However, any payments over $600 the 3 months before your bankruptcy can also be seen as preferential treatment in bankruptcy that the bankruptcy trustee may undo anyways. Then you still owe them money and the trustee wonders what else you moved around..|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	You should be able to chose what you would like to go in, however since the laws changed you may be required to pay back some or a portion of everything that is included,  Discuss this with you attorney in advance so that you know what can potentially happen|`|Ktp0U3Suaa	I suggest you to try project payday, simply because you don't need any money up front and you can start making money within minutes.

aN4SUKkRaa	They place the information on the rebate form on their customer database for the future.|`|AA11357056	Its actually a way to sell a product at a higher price to one group of consumers, but still sell it at a lower price to other consumers. By making a mail-in rebate part of the final price, in effect they're charging more to everyone who buys it but doesn't claim the rebate.... but still selling it to people who are only willing to pay the price after rebate for it.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Because most people won't bother to go through the hassle filing for a rebate. That way, they can advertise a lower price without actually having to give the discount to everyone.
K1QjTwzaaa	I suggest purchasing 2 logos (1 male,1 female) and have them birth to a new logo so you can start off logo fresh. Buying a logo from a logo store is never a good idea...(they all attract fat people). Same w/ online (they usually come from africa) so i hope you understand.<br>  <br>  <br>  However once the plane logo is in your possession I suggest you rarely feed it and bruise it often so he never forgets whos boss. If you are a sireous about what you are doing place the logo-creature into the wild similar to the one in the place in africa. I personally recommend this as I have done it for years. <br>  <br>  Wait 20-35min and you should have a landscape logo. If your logo is not landscapeish after the 35 min mark you should remember that it also helps if you surround them with other wild logos such as the one one frosted flakes.... <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, God Bless<br>  Source(s):<br>  Logos can be resistant. Don't be afraid to stick your finger in their ear(they tend like it)
SqzoZe4Laa	Another guy from Oregon needed help calculating how much money Oregon (both the feds, and the state), seperately, were taking from him.

Also, for whomever answers this, could you please give me an easy way to calculate this on my calculator in the furture.... thx, john in illinois (NOW)<br>  <br>  well, shoot, I forgot to keep copying and pasting. I gotta tell : I've got the question out there, but nobody's answered it yet. Now here's what'ya do. My father, Dennis DePorter, is a retired Judge in  the Stateof Illinois. He doesn't know Oregon Law, but he can give you some good advice, now you just remember that we are two 2 hours AHEADH OF Y'all, SO WHEN YOU CALL HIS OFFICE, you'd best take this into consideration. You're gonna get his secretary, Sammy (pretty little thing) on the phone, and you're gonna tell her  you need to speak with  Attorney Dennis DePorter, and she's gonna ask you what's this all about. You just tell her child support matters, Ma'am. and that's all don't tell her you're from Oregon. Now, if  you get my dad on the phone, just explain that you met his son JOHN on the internet, and JOHN said that you (dennis) might be able to spare 4 or 5 minutes to give me some advice. He'll say yeah, go ahead, and that's when you start talking. First thing you tell him is that you are from Oregon, and you know he doesn't know Oregon Law, but you'd like to run this by him anyway. Talk your thing. Tell him your story, then listen as he gives you his advice. There, you're done. I'll them tax numbers for you 2morrow (john from Tillamook, now of rock island, illinois)

Any easy way out of a poor credit history is undoubtedly tempting, but it may lead to further financial difficulties in the future. If a poor credit history is due to circumstances beyond consumer's control, and they are able to somewhat make amends to their credit records after that time, then a creditor can be requested to upgrade credit rating because of a sense of customer loyalty.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/</a><br>  <br>  Most creditors don't trust the customers defaulting on their debts, so it may be very difficult to obtain new credit. But once a person is able to demonstrate continuing income stability and prompt payment patterns, his situation can improve in a period of two to three years. This way, even in the case of bankruptcy, a consumer is likely to be offered charge and credit cards within a year or two if maintaining a steady income.

AA10259042	Different indexes use different weighting techniques, but the most popular is to use market capitalization.  That means they take the total value of the outstanding shares time the market price.  I think that XOM has the largest market capitalization currently so it would make up the largest % of a portfolio such as the S&P 500 which is an index based on market capitalization.  For that index they calculate the total value of all 500 stocks and then each stock in the index and divide by the total to give the % for that stock.  The Dow Jones uses a different methodology not based on market capitalization.  Their method is too confusing to attempt to explain.

It doesn't matter if you go over by 1 cent. You will get your overdraft fee because the account balance is negative. Then, if you do not have the account positive when the pending item posts, you will get an overdraft fee for that. It should be 8.00 a day they are charging. The 21.00 is for Friday/Saturday/Sunday daily fee combined.<br>  Have you tried for the Reserve Line of Credit? It is a line of credit that sits against your checking account and when it falls below 0 it will borrow the account money in $200 increments to cover anything that might come through. There's a $2 advance fee, and you will have to pay back what is borrowed plus interest. If you catch the advance, then you usually only end up paying less that $1 in interest. Compare that to the $37.50 overdraft fees (per item), it's a great option to have in case of an "oops".<br>  <br>  But then again, you could have easily prevented all this if you maintain a ledger on the account. :)|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	If this is your first overdraft then you can probably call and talk to a banker.

(They want us to use our debit cards.)|`|kifwyOgKaa	Yes, it's legal.  I am quite certain you were given disclosures when you opened your account which explain their fees and account terms and conditions.  <br>  <br>  All banks must give out such disclosures.|`|xsTq6bKpaa	Yes, it's legal.  Talk to your local bank.  If this is the 1st time you've had this happen they may be willing to rebate some of the fees.  You should also ask what kind of overdraft protection they offer.  Some banks tie overdraft to a savings account, others to a checking account.  Generally any fees that you pay for overdraft protection are less than what you are charged in fees.<br>  <br>  Robin

TluWzYAJaa	Hi, the first house you're looking at is a manufactured home.  Meaning it originally was built in a factory and brought on wheels to a trailer park.  If you buy this home you will make payment on it,  but also rent on the rental lot.<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure about the second one.  What kind of code violations?  For that price it must be serious.  You might buy it and have to tear it down compeltely.  Very strange that one.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to buy here in America, sometimes mobile homes are a good way to go.  Thery are cheaper, but you don't own the lot.  They can raise the rent anytime they want.  But the home itself would be yours.  It is a good way to invest to get started.  I would definetly advise getting over here first and talking in person with people that you trust.  Rent somewhere first before you sign any papers.  That way you can decide exactly what neighborhood and home you are looking for!  Happy house hunting!|`|lLm5uIuDaa	The prices are real but the locations would be troublesome.  The homes are also documented on their sites as having issues.  They are probably located in high crime areas which you should be looking at when you are looking at a residence.

You would be better off to look outside of the Miami area to other communities that are not so expensive and don't have the crime stigma in the low rent districts.

xb255X0faa	The life insurance companies are not really at risk if the corporation as a whole folds.  The corporation is the entity that is going down, but most of their operations are still very sound on their own.  That's why they got the loans and that's why they are selling off those solid pieces to pay back the loan.  The insurance companies have separate reserves and assets that they are forced to set aside by the state insurance departments that are there to pay your claims.  <br>  <br>  Also as one of the other comments mentioned, if the insurance company did collapse your state would step in and another insurance company would gladly take your policy over.  If the insurance company collapses the big losers will be the investors in the company stock and bonds not the policyholders.|`|1OY4FcP8aa	You can be assured that your policy will be valid.  <br>  <br>  Even if AIG fails, your policy will be taken over by the state guaranty fund in the state where you live.

They are all subject to scrutiny of state insurance regulators.<br>  <br>  The problems of the mother company - AIG - stem from their goof in insuring securities against loss on the assumption that they would never need to pay claims.   Unfortunately, the housing collapse also trashed this assumption.  <br>  <br>  The life insurance company you have can easily be tracked through your state insurance authorities.|`|klYZR2lPaa	It looks like a non easy cracking nut,looking around here <a href="http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...</a> ,you may find something useful for you.|`|hsLJgvN4aa	Get your doubts about Insurance program procedure solved here. <a href="http://theinsurancegroup.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://theinsurancegroup.blogspot.com</a>

If you narrow things down to a specific career, you can usually get college rankings by specific program, as long as it isn't too small a niche.<br>  <br>  You seem to have a very diverse set of interests - you may want to consider doing some intern or volounteer work before you commit to a college major.  For example, you could train to be an volounteer firefighter or EMT while you are in school, and a local B&B operator may let you shadow them for a few days.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

From there, they will file a claim for you and after 30 days they will refund your money and do a chargeback to the seller for not delivering the goods.  But before you do that, I would recommend asking the seller for a tracking number. You get one even with regular mail and any smart seller makes sure he writes that one down.  That way you can know when he sent it and when it will arrive, if he ever even sent it at all.  Oh and BTW even if you paid paypal with a debit card or checking acct. call your bank. I've never dealt with the bank on this kind of thing but I am thinking theres probably something you can do thru them too.

But a 403 (b) is for public educators and non-profit organizations.|`|xkz8Logfaa	403b is the same as a 401k that is only available for public companies like Public Schools, Public Hospitals... etc.|`|xsTq6bKpaa	Do you mean 401(k)?  Which is better really isn't a fair question.  I work for a for profit corporation, therefore I am only eligible for a 401(k) assuming that my employer has one.  If I worked for a non-profit, like a hospital, then I would be eligible for my employer sponsored 403(b).<br>  <br>  Having a retirement package is not mandatory, it's based on whether the company wants to pay for it.  Retirement packages are considered to be benefits like health insurance, etc.<br>  <br>  But, with good investment options either the 401(k) or the 403(b) is a smart and easy way to get started for retirement saving.

This means that they would take back any payments made to any medical providers you have used since the policy began, and you would be responsible for the full billed charges.<br>  <br>  That's why its absolutely crucial to disclose anything and everything on a health insurance application - it can come back to bite you in the end.<br>  <br>  So yes...they CAN cancel you.  Whether or not they WILL cancel you depends upon the seriousness of the situation - how significant was the "health condition" you didn't disclose, why are they requesting the records now (have you had expensive claims, etc.)?|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	They could increase your rates, exclude coverage for the condition, or cancel the policy.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	it depends how serious the 'health condition' is.  This could be considered 'material misrepresentatin' and they may cancel or change your policy (adding a restriction, rating or exclusion, etc).  It's hard for anyone to answer without knowning the condition.<br>  <br>  And contrary to the first answer:  All group or creditor (the stuff sold through financing companies and banks to cover debt) insurances look at pre-existing conditions.  This is the major downside to these types of insurance...they do the underwriting at the time of a claim, so they can easily deny claim even though you've paid into it.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Laws governing insurance vary from state to state. In many places your policy could be cancelled for misrepresentation of  pertinent facts on an application form, whether intentional or accidental. I wish you all the best.<br>  <br>  If you are covered by an employer-sponsored group plan, insurance companies usually don't care about pre-existing conditions.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Contact the Department of Insurance in your state for help or to file a complaint.

AA11598210	~~You can check with your county's health department line and see if there is any help available. However, there probably is not. If you find out they don't have any help available, then call the hospital, ask for a 40 percent deduction (start there) since you have no insurance so there is no paperwork on their part. They should come down to at least a 20% discount, and then tell them you will make a payment (decide what you can afford before you call). Tell them you will make this payment on whatever date you can and do so every month faithfully and on time, then it should keep your account out of collections.~~|`|9FxR4khCaa	In most states, medicaid cuts off coverage at age 18-19. But google your state + medicaid to see what your states eligibility is.<br>  <br>  If you live at home with your parents, chances are you won't qualify for financial aid since household income is counted for that too (as it will be counted for medicaid).<br>  <br>  Contact the hospital and probably the ER physicians billing dept to see what assistance is available. Short of that you will need to ask for a cash discounted rate if you can't get any other assisrance.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Talk to the hospital's billing dept. NOW.

There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month.

bf5cDEyZaa	A chief financial officer (CFO) may also be known as the vice president, senior vice president, or executive vice president of finance. Whatever the title, a CFO is responsible for the finance and accounting operations of an organization, including financial reporting, and compliance with accepted finance and accounting standards and regulatory requirements.<br>  <br>  In public companies, CFOs literally sign-off that the company's reported financial statements, and financial well being are accurate, free from error and misrepresentations, and are in compliance with all applicable standards and regulatory requirements. There are substantial civil and criminal penalties for CFOs who deliver inaccurate, erroneous, or misrepresented financial information.<br>  <br>  CFOs are typically a senior executive and an officer of their company. They typically report into the chief executive officer (CEO). CFOs also have substantial reporting responsibility to the chairman of the board of directors and the head of the board's audit committee.<br>  <br>  The job duties of a CFO can differ depending on whether they work for a public or a private company. The job duties of a CFO can include:<br>  <br>      * Participating in the organization's strategic business and financial planning processes<br>      * Setting financial goals in support of business operations and strategic directions<br>      * Planning and managing the finances of the entire organization<br>      * Managing securities and cash portfolios, other liquid assets, and debt<br>      * Obtaining financing for major initiatives or acquisitions<br>      * Providing financial due-diligence for any merger and acquisition activities<br>      * Managing people, important vendor relationships, business and financial operations<br>      * Researching and staying abreast of the latest regulatory and financial accounting reporting trends<br>      * Monitoring financial processes, policies, systems and personnel<br>      * Assuring compliance with accepted financial accounting standards, with the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and other SEC regulations, in public companies<br>      * Attending business conferences<br>      * Reporting on the financial well-being of their organization to the CEO, board of directors, stock holders, and regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<br>      * Providing assurance that financial reporting is accurate, error-free, and free from misrepresentation<br>      * Acting as the point of contact with the stock market, business press, and financial analyst community<br>      * Depending on the organization's structure and reporting relationships, a CFO may also have information technology (IT) responsibilities, legal responsibilities, human resource responsibilities, organization responsibilities, and more<br>  <br>  As with any senior executive job, the CFO's job can be very demanding. Long hours, including evenings and weekends, and frequent travel, can be a normal part of the job.<br>  CFO Job Skills<br>  <br>  As a senior executive, a CFO is expected to have a broad and varied range of skills. These include:<br>  <br>      * Accounting and financial management skills<br>      * Understanding of complex financial concepts<br>      * Attention to detail and facility with numbers<br>      * Effective communications skills<br>      * Strategic thinking and planning skills<br>      * Understanding business processes, operations, business strategy, non-financial areas of the business such as information technology and legal; industry trends and market forces<br>      * Leadership, motivation, managerial skills<br>      * Self-confidence<br>      * Integrity, honesty, and high ethical standards<br>      * Sound business skills and judgement<br>      * Ability to assimilate and evaluate large amounts of information<br>      * Decision making, negotiation, sales, political skills<br>  <br>  CFO pay varies greatly depending on the size and type of organization. Compensation of CFOs can include a base salary, bonus, stock options, stock grants, long-term incentives, and other compensation. Other benefits enjoyed by top executives, such as use of company cars, planes, memberships, and other perks, often are also a part of their compensation package.<br>  <br>  There can be a very wide disparity in CFO compensation between large and small companies. CFO Magazine reported that median annual compensation for CFOs in 2002 at the largest companies (companies with revenues in excess of $1 billion) was almost $1 million, with additional median pay outs on long-term incentives of $500,000. A larger survey of CFO compensation done by The Todd Organization in 2001 reported that CFOs as a group had a median annual compensation of almost $900,000. CFOs at small companies had a total median annual compensation of almost $600,000, and those at large companies had a total median compensation in excess $2 million.<br>  <br>  The formal education for CFOs can vary greatly. No specific degree is an absolute requirement for CFOs, although financially oriented degrees are strongly preferred. CFOs typically have an accounting or finance background. Most would have at least a bachelor's degree in accounting or finance. Many have MBAs and other advanced degrees. CFOs often attend executive education programs to further their skills and understanding of the issues that CFOs manage in their work.
AA10841629	I have a lot of real life experience - and I was once a CFO.<br>  My answers:<br>  <br>  0) All items starting with 1 - are not as important as your attitude, situation, luck, and skill.  What you make depends on where you work, your skill level, and the industry - which comes down to luck sometimes with timing.  <br>  <br>  1) Generally a 4-year college degree is the entry level. The more education past that - eg, becoming a CPA, a lawyer - etc - leads to higher paying jobs.  The right person can become a CFO with less than a 4-year degree - but that does not happen often.<br>  <br>  2) All jobs should keep you busy and let you grow your skills.<br>  3) 12 hours a day is what most work, some work 5 hours a day.<br>  4) Depends on everything - generally $10K to 200K a year.<br>  5) That's a question for yesterday.  Race and Gender and Ethnics are not what you need or should care about. It's YOU - not your past. <br>  6) Of course - in the past a CFO of start-up used to get wealthy when the stock market allowed it. Anywhere where business is good and you are doing your best - gives you room for promotion.<br>  7) A good GPA is your best guide.  Math, Social skills, etc.

h8l1H4N4aa	Has he pulled this kind of stuff before?  I don't know what kind of company you work for, but giving out passwords is a breach of security.  Add that to the other things he does (or doesn't do) and there could be grounds for dismissal, but also may be a warning.  It depends.  Either way, I would bring it to my boss' attention if he seems to always be doing underhanded things.<br>  <br>  If he gets fired, it's because of his own doing.  Think about it, having a baby apparently didn't make him more responsible.  What if his job was then replaced with someone honest and trustworthy with 4 kids who's been trying to find a job for 5 months?|`|c8cced02f0d5f2228af10d2adeba6efbaa	Mind your own business.

If this chap is in the wrong, the consequence of his actions may harm others and you believe that further consequences will develop - and you are not being vengeful or "out to get him" - then you should approach the HR Manager or the person responsible for the handicapped chap.  Tell - now - before someone is hurt.  <br>  Is he thinking about the consequences for the boy doing the clocking out, or his family, or your workload, or himself.  It is not your responsibility to look out for anyone but you and those who cannot look after themselves.<br>  <br>  Never in spite and the consequences will fit the crime.  Remember - what goes around comes around.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Unless breaking company rules affect you directly, stay out of it.

The length of your employment will be shortened.<br>  <br>  Passing clients to you is a different issue altogether. At the next staff meeting, or whenever you get to talk with your boss, just say sometimes calls get transferred to me that pertain to contracts and issues I don't have access too. Is there some way I can help these people without it appearing they are getting the Run Around?<br>  <br>  I am 99% certain the boss will tell you to transfer those people to the person having the information the client needs.  After that, you just send the call back to the @ss and say you are following the bosses orders.

3ExcyAJaaa	Playing Forex can appear alluring, but the majority  of people who try it lose money.  All you have to do is do a web search on the words "Forex" and "lose" to see this is the consensus.<br>   <br>  Forex is what we call a "zero sum" game.   You are making a bet with someone else about whether a currency will rise or fall.  For every winner there has to be a loser.  If you are smarter than the average player, you may make money.  If you are dumber than the average player, you are likely to lose money.  Most of the people making the "bets" in Forex are highly trained professionals at banks and other institutions.  You are unlikely to beat them at this game.<br>   <br>  Actually  Forex is not quite a zero sum game.  It's a slightly negative sum game as the Forex broker takes a small percentage each time in the spread.  It's a small amount but over a hundred trades, it ends up being a considerable amount of money.  So the average player is likely to lose money, and remember the average player is a highly trained professional and probably smarter than you.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of luck in Forex, and if you play it, you will have some periods of time where you make money.  This is usually because you are having a lucky streak, not because you have suddenly become an expert Forex player.  However, most people are unwilling to admit their success is due to luck.  They become convinced they have a system that works, and lose a lot of money trying to refine it.<br>   <br>  Further complicating the problem is the large number of Forex scams on the internet.  Most Forex websites are of questionable honesty.<br>  <br>   I would recommend not trying to do Forex at all, unless you are a trained professional.  It's like playing poker with people better than you, with the house constantly taking a small percentage from the pot.|`|AA10472839	FX is dangerous. Very few people succeed at FX.  It's fun.

RhEhzGbraa	In terms of the waiver, it is best that you consult an attorney.  A good attorney should be able to draw up a good waiver in an hour which should run you about $175 to $250.  I think that it would be money well spent if it avoids a lawsuit.  Even though the Martial Arts Teachers Association (MATA) also has release forms available for their members and membership is very affordable.  You can visit this website  <a href="http://www.martialartsteachers.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.martialartsteachers.com/index...</a>  for information.<br>  <br>  In addition to a good waiver you also need to purchase a Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy since no matter how good a waiver or release you have it will not guarantee that you won't be sued or that if you are sued that you won't be held liable.  There are CGL policies that are specifically tailored for martial art studios and/or teachers.  You can consult a local independent agent for assistance and/or also check with MATA since they might have an association sponsored policy or be able to give you a local referral.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Best to consult an attorney.|`|WrlYzty2aa	The waiver is just a deterrent, you are still responsible for any injury that occur. Your best option is to buy some general liability insurance. The premium on GL is oftentimes rated based on your projected annual revenue. Contact a reputable insurance agency and get a few quotes. For a small business the premium is pretty affordable. You can contact the department of insurance in your state to find contact information of reputable agencies.|`|oU9rI4woaa	You need to visit a local Independent Agent and get a liability policy for a martial arts school.

The question is - how does the clock round when you check in.  Since checking out rounds back, checking in must also round back (the theory being that it will even out).  If checking in always round forward (you clock in 1 minute early and it rounds to the next increment) and checking out always rounds back, you can complain to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor (check www.dol.gov/esa for nearest area office).

One of the older sons even left an abandoned junker car on the property when they moved. ugggh.|`|vCePK8gMaa	I list minor children on the lease as occupants. <br>  <br>  They do not have to sign the lease.

It doesn't work that way.  If the lender gets a lovely offer for $30,000 more than yours, the lender is quite entitled to accept that offer and ignore yours.

pckuIRhsaa	The best example I can think of is the credit manager at a new car dealership. He tries to sell you the extended warranty and does not know what no means. The last few cars that my wife and I have bought I have asked the car salesman to inform the credit manager that I do not want the extended warranty or any other extras and that if he even brings anything up that the deal is off and I am walking out. It is the only solution that works for me.|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	One who sells, not taking no for an answer.|`|skz3EqUXaa	An aggressive sales person is someone who truly believes<br>  his is the best product.<br>  <br>  And that if he fails to convince the prospect, then the prospect's<br>  life will be worse.<br>  <br>  In other words, if the sales person doesn't make the sale then<br>  he has harmed another human being.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Someone that has goals every day and achieves them every day as well.
sJKi6Y2faa	A family budget maps out the way you should spend money on family expenses. It allows you to make sure that you don't spend more money than you earn. Another important step after you make a budget is to record your expenses. That way you can see how you actually spend your money. The best plan is worthless if you do not follow through with it.<br>  <br>  A family budget is usually prepared on a monthly basis because for many of us our incomes get paid monthly and many of our large expenses are also paid monthly like our rent or mortgage payments.|`|dPZJ7GTiaa	A personal family budget tells you how much you need per month for bills, how much you need per month in groceries, then you can take what's left & figure out how much goes to savings & how much goes to other things, like dinner out, movies, buying-stuff, etc...<br>  <br>  That way, you don't spend more than you have without knowing it, and one part of the family doesn't "go over budget" without the other knowing what's going on.. it sort of makes a cooperative effort and plan per month.<br>  <br>  It's done monthly because most bills are per-month.
AA11357056	since variable costs are .68 of revenues ($170,000/$250,000), the break even point is:<br>  <br>  .32S - $120,000 = 0<br>  .32S = $120,000<br>  S = $375,000<br>  <br>  check:<br>  Sales = $375,000<br>  Variable Costs = $375,000 x .68 = $255,000<br>  Fixed Costs = $120,000<br>  <br>  Total Variable + Fixed Costs = $375,000|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Hi Cassidy, the answer is staring you right in the face.  If this question is from a text book it is a stupid question but, lets go with it.  The question gives you the answer $170k fixed + $120k variable so total costs for the business are $290k.  If you have sales of $290k you will break-even i.e., sales would cover your fixed and variable costs.

ePkiOzPSaa	You should probably have the house appraised... we can't really tell you what it's worth as we don't know a) what the extent of the damage is and b) how much the housing market has changed in your area since purchase.  In the current economic climate, it's likely that you lost more value due to the down in the housing market than from the tenant trashing it (unless it has been seriously demolished).  It also depends on WHEN it was worth $95-110k, was it during the market's boom?|`|suWnr83laa	Try to sell it with an "as is" clause and see what you can get for it.

M9iO7Q0Eaa	Yeah, it's like that everywhere now. I was laid off when my employer closed at the end of December, and 30,000 workers from my company alone went looking for jobs.

AA11357056	Your department manager's recommendation will carry a lot of weight, since she's the one who's going to be most familiar with the requirements of the position and the work you've done. That's not a guarantee, but the bigwigs are going to be more interested in getting the best person for the position... loyalty to a former employee often comes second

4RjM5lElaa	Oh that's tough.<br>  Going forward, don't let yourself be psyched out like that.  You need to walk into the interview and believe that you are the best person for the company but in order to do that you need to be prepared with a good resume and solid experience.<br>  So, how do you recover from what happened?  Try calling the guy that interviewed you and tell him you are calling to check on the status of your application and interview and see where you fell into the hiring process.<br>  He might tell you they have gone with another candidate - he might call you back for another interview.  Be prepared for either case.<br>  Good luck
qGfAlDd2aa	Well, it's not going to hurt your score.  How much it will go up depends on a lot more than the balance outstanding.<br>  <br>  History has a lot to do with it.  So does the total amount of credit you have available and how long you have had it.|`|jMMJstwjaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I guess nothing will spoil your credit rating.<br>  Find more details in the resource below.|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Hi, its is hard to say based on what you stated.  Your credit score is a function of five things:<br>  Payment history(on-time payment): 35 percent<br>  Amounts owed: 30 percent<br>  Length of credit history: 15 percent<br>  New credit: 10 percent<br>  Types of credit used: 10 percent.<br>  <br>  Paying off your credit card is a good thing just based on the fact that credit card debt is the worst debt you can have because it costs a lot in interest payments.  It will help your score because the amount owed is 30% of the weighted score.  The model above is the FICO score method but, Fair Isac (FICO) just changed their credit scoring model but, it will take some time before banks adopt the new method, so you can use the above model as a guide for the 6-9 months at least.|`|kwPSng5zaa	While it is good that you pay off your credit cards please remember that you will have to maintian some type of credit for your score to move favorably.

zuGKIWfNaa	I'm not aware that contracting a staph infection is grounds for suing anyone. What, exactly, would you sue for? Has the infection caused you a financial loss? Would you try to claim that the institution you were in had somehow been negligent in allowing you to contract the infection? Has the infection caused permanent physical damage?<br>  <br>  I don't see any court in the land considering this case seriously -- especially if, as you say, the infection apparently was contracted somewhere between five and ten years ago.

6LPeWXYuaa	Your mother should check to see what is required to be a real estate appraiser in Tennessee.<br>  <br>  Every state has different requirements.  In Texas, the Texas Real Estate Commission web site would have that information.  Perhaps the same is true in Tennessee.<br>  <br>  Here an appraiser has to take quite a few courses, and pass the tests, and then has to take a licensing test.  After that, you become an apprentice and have to work under a fully licensed appraiser for a period of time before you can do work on your own as an appraiser.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend that she pursue a career as a real estate agent unless she has researched it thoroughly.  It can be a very rewarding career, and there are some that can earn a good living.  But, there are many more licensed agents that drop out the first year because it takes a while to get established enough to earn a decent living.<br>  <br>  If your mother has always been a salaried employee, she may find the stress of being an "independent contractor" too much to handle.|`|suWnr83laa	The first answer to this question is very good.  All I have to add is that appraisers are generally paid per job while agents are paid on commission. Neither one has a guaranteed salary. Also, appraisers may have to do things like go into crawl spaces/horrible basements and attics, where agents don't, so if your mom is the type who calls for someone else to come kill a spider, appraisal probably isn't her thing. The entire real estate industry is tough right now.
MWdoYwTvaa	an 8 ball|`|gAuIixm6aa	l would be very cautious dealing with this company. There are a lot of companies that try to scam girls out of money telling them they are going to make them famous. Remember that a legit company will never make you take classes or pay for headshots or other photos.<br>  First, you will need a couple of good headshots and full body shots. Contact some good, *professional* photographers and ask them about TFP, which means you work for prints for your portfolio. Ask around about photographers trying to expand their portfolios.<br>  As for the income thing, it really depends on what kind of modeling you're doing. A catalog model or a hand model will never make as much as a runway model. Most jobs are paid per hour, on par with photographer's fees. Maybe $150/hr would be a good guess? In NYC it's not unusual to expect thousands a day. Promotional models at tradeshows usually make a few hundred a day. Keep in mind it depends on your location, the market, and the season. It fluctuates a lot.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Wa60Ts05aa	Females do usually make more money and get more jobs than male models, but it all really depends on the type of modeling they're looking for. Runway models don't make the same kind of money as magazine models do. It's all different. <br>  <br>  I don't know a lot about it, but from what I've heard and read, modeling is fun to do part-time, but they make far too little money to depend on it for a living. It's a tough industry and, like acting, you have to face many rejections before you get a show.
