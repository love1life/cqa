20090226141456AAD5pI7	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How many of you are having a hard time finding a simple job?	I haven't even really had much time to get an official 'career' of sorts started before all of this economy garbage started. I have a few years of retail/sales/customer service experience. So basically my options are to stick with retail department stores. I'm barely getting anything from unemployment (all they will give is $65 per week for 13 weeks). What I do get from it...when I try to follow up on applications with managers at those locations, I get the typical employees with attitudes to don't want me to speak with the manager. Then when I do get the manager, they get all "suspicious" when I simply ask their first and last name to log it on my work search record for the Department of Labor. So part of them are hesitant to give me their name, which is obviously required for the DOL to follow up with that person later on.      But the ridiculous thing is...even if the DOL followed up, those store managers are so lax that they probably would just say, "I have no idea if I talked to that person, I talk to a lot of people."       Is anyone else on Unemployment encountering this nonsense?  It's better than nothing, but almost not worth it - and yes, I'm trying to find a job ASAP.

I just had a couple questions about unemployment. my sister says her friend got unemployment money after she got fired. Ever since then my sister has been absolutely negligent toward her job after she found out she had been working there long enough to claim. None the less she got her *** canned because she would show up late and just plain not show without calling. she is an egotistical dependent *****! If she does get unemployment money i will be absolutely outraged! i do not want to pay her to sit on her *** and not do any house work, or any constructive work. And i don't want you guys to pay for that either.      My question is can she claim? because i thought you have to get laid off and not fired.. and if she just so happens to manipulate the system ( she is vary manipulative) Should i turn her in? i am hating my sister right now because we share am apartment, and she is always late paying her half of the bills. I go and work hard at school (college) that my parents pay for, and she just signs up for classes, and does not go or she fails all of them, she is a leech and i want to give her a huge reality check, and my parents refuse to stop paying for her school. she has wasted 2,400 dollars on classes that she has failed, and she doesn't ever clean the house or buy groceries.

I signed a 1-year contract with Cass Street Apartments, $650/month and payed a $650 security deposit. I have been a good tenant and paid my monthly rent on time each month (also writing on the checks the month of the rent for a paper trail). I am about to move out in a month and a couple of the tenants told me that everyone who moves out will not get their safety deposit back. I talked to the grounds keeper and she said that the landlord has not been contactable for a year or so; he won't return any phone calls or even stop by the renting facility. Is there anything that I can do assuming I clean my apartment properly before moving out and there was not any damage inflicted to the apartment? Is there a way for me to get my deposit back? Other tenants have asked and tried calling this landlord but he simply refuses to return their calls....

Hello,   I think I need some major help in putting across my 'colourful' CV, I had temped for a while since 2007-2008 (call centre, then receptionist), afterward I went onto a cinema staff job, as it was only supposed to be a stop-gap job as having A job is better than NO job right? (ironically ended up there for 9 months instead of 3!), anyway, it got a bit ridiculous (not to mention pay-wise ridiculous, & it was a job that offered to go nowhere for me)..so I left, with enough savings to see me through till my next temp assignment (so i thought...then the credit crisis happened!).  Anyway, I resigned last Aug and been job hunting since.      So far I am not having much luck getting ANYWHERE, and I have applied to many places :( ...so...I know one weak spot on my CV is trying to state achievments related to my cinema work..   Involved was: multi-tasking, cash handling (& attention to detail), enquiry handling, phone/ticket sales procsessing, queue managing, other customer service blarb, maintaining cinema's overall tidyness and food stock including displays, prompt screen cleaning & co-managing these with colleagues.        I'v tried putting my jobs down as concise as possible..but I don't think its doing any favours, as perhaps ppl dont get how its relevant to anything? So how can I extract relevant things from that list??      The jobs I want now are: Office assistant or library/information assistant work.      THANK YOU

I plan on doing the maximum of 3 years with Americorps. I enjoy it so much that I will be lost when I can't volunteer full-time any more, not only because of the duties and variety but also because of all the different people you work with (volunteer & community). I've been trying to find other organizations like Americorps, where I can volunteer full time and receive a living stipend. I don't expect to make a profit, just enough to live on. I know there are plenty of part-time opportunities but I would like to do it full time. I have considered the Peace Corps and although I think I would really love it I probably wouldn't be accepted because I don't have a college degree. I'm willing, and would enjoy traveling, anywhere in the US, or maybe even internationally if the expenses are paid (I can't afford to fly internationally).      Or, even if there are places where you can volunteer full-time, but don't need to pay for housing and food. I would be alright with that too. Any ideas would be appreciated.

20090226122027AAHBwbm	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	How do I deal with a temper-mental, but good employee?	First off that I'm keeping the details as vague as possible to protect a friend should someone who knows me read this.      Right, I have a subordinate who is very good at what he does, but he's not delivering the results that our head office require, pretty much because their heads are stuck up ...... anyway, I've been told to pretty much take over direct control of his department and re-train him, but he knows his job and is good at it, but he is an extremely proud person who would take these actions personally, even though the only reason I'm taking over his department is to protect him and his staff as head office has recommended replacing the lot.       Everyone in this department is doing their job the way they are supposed to but due to the times and rising costs its getting harder and harder to meet quotas with the same resources. Head office is stuck in the stone age and being incredibly stubborn and will not give me what I need to fix the problem or accept the performance of that department is the best they can hope to achieve under the circumstances. A replacement crew would only waste more time and resources. Downsizing the department would improve costs a bit in the short term but long term would be disasterous.      My question is not about what can be done about head office, but how do I tell this good, hardworking person he's not good enough and must take a step back because a few upper class suites are too lazy to think of a real solution, even when I've presented them with several options.       I'm a company man, but I also care about my employees. I started there myself and I swore I wouldn't forget that, even if it slows or halts my own progress.
20090226095254AAFRbJ0	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	How do I claim the car I bought on my 2008 tax returns?	My husband and I just recently filed our taxes using turbo tax. I assumed he had claimed the car that I bought as well since he was the one who did most of the paper work. Well come to find out...a few days later he tells me "oops, I forgot to claim the car on the taxes." He also left out a few other things as well that could have been helpful to us.   Also, we are military and are stationed about 24hrs away from our home town. I would also like to know if they allow you to claim travel expenses, i.e.> Any money we spent coming out here this past Aug., money spent getting into an apt., or going home for Christmas? I'm sure the last one is doubtful, but I thought i'd throw it out there.      For the most part I need to know what to do about the car he forgot about. If anyone has any other helpful ideas as far as filing taxes (things people usually don't know about or either they forget about) feel free to add that in!

Throughout my time there I was paid by cheque and was never given a payslips (the contract was oral; nothing was formally written or signed). I would hand in my monthly hours and was paid soon after by cheque.      I never made enough money to be paying tax so I naturally assumed this was all taken care of by my employer (this was my first job). I was informed that my wages would be sent out following my dismissal. I received a form this morning, however, asking me to take liability for any tax and national insurance contributions that should be made on my behalf.      Can they do this? As I said, I wasn't earning enough to pay tax anyway, so I'm not concerned about having to repay anything, but if they're employing people illegally then I want HMRC to know. :)

At Target I feel like no one really likes me, no one talks to me much- especially not any of the bosses. I called off a few times (I really was sick) was late probably twice (never by more than 10 minutes) and missed work once because I thought I wasn't scheduled. I am always friendly and nice and stuff and work though and I do whatever they tell me to do and I try to do it well.      I don't know if I should put them down on my new application. im nervous they wouldnt say good things about me. however, since it is a daycare, they do background checks, which would mean they would be able to find out that I worked there right?

If she does get unemployment money i will be absolutely outraged! i do not want to pay her to sit on her *** and not do any house work, or any constructive work. And i don't want you guys to pay for that either.      My question is can she claim? because i thought you have to get laid off and not fired.. and if she just so happens to manipulate the system ( she is vary manipulative) Should i turn her in? i am hating my sister right now because we share am apartment, and she is always late paying her half of the bills. I go and work hard at school (college) that my parents pay for, and she just signs up for classes, and does not go or she fails all of them, she is a leech and i want to give her a huge reality check, and my parents refuse to stop paying for her school. she has wasted 2,400 dollars on classes that she has failed, and she doesn't ever clean the house or buy groceries.

20090226132029AAHUENp	Business & Finance;Insurance	Unemployment Appeal Question?	I was "fired" from my job on february 9th for "lack of work". I worked doing bill collections for about 15 months at this company. The economy slowed down so it was harder to collect money. In the middle of january i was at 50% commision. I was told that if i did not get to 100% by end of january which is EXTREMLY diffucult that  i will be either suspended, terminated or a pay cut. I tried my hardest and got nowhere and they "fired" me. I did nothing wrong and gave it 100% at work and i was collecting for first financial bank credit cards which was VERY slow. So they made me sign a termination paper. I filed for unemployment on february 9th. I received a letter stating that i will receive 200 bucks a week. The paper said this does not approve my unemployment just simply states the ammount i will receive if i do get approved. They put for my seperate code that i was discharged with misconduct. I still have not received a first paycheck or been told if im approved and its been about 3 weeks. It is very hard for me to find a job because i leave for the army in july. I need unemployment until then and i feel i deserve it because i did nothing wrong to be fired. I tried my hardest and it was not my fault nobody wanted to pay there bills because of the economy slowing down. I know my company will try to deny my unemployment but im not sure because i have not received anything and for all i know i might be approved. If i must appeal what should i tell them for my case. All help is appreciated, thanks

He claims his landlord is evicting him from his current apartment because he got into an argument with a "friend". The "friend" stabbed my uncle he was also hospitalized for it. Now my uncle has to leave the premises in 30 days because the cops call the landlord if there is any police activity on the premises. The lease states if there is any police activity there, you will be evicted. My uncle says he did nothing wrong. If that's true, why is he getting evicted if the "friend" was the one who was jailed and criminally charged? I think my uncle is conveniently leaving out pieces of the story to get money from us. Doesn't the tenant have to have a criminal charge to get evicted? Getting evicted just because the cops were called sounds strange to me.

20090226144630AAsa5hv	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Does this sound suspicious? longish?	The past year, i've worked as a receptionist with my mom and her best friend at her best friends company. I go in after school every day. Tuesdays and Thursday my mom works the shift before me, so we see eachother when i get there and when she leaves.    Since I've worked here, we've had money missing from the cash box 3 or 4 times. And not just a few bucks. Last time it was $100.      Today, my mom met me in the lobby, and said she left the keys to the file cabnet that we keep the cash box in, in my office. I walked into my office and found one of my co workers in there. Now, this isn't totally unusual, as they come in to give me invoices every 10-15 minutes.   But the lights were off, and he was putting what sounded like change into his pocket near my desk [the file cabinet is behind me desk about 3 feet]. Now, the keys were where my mom said they would be, in the key hole of the file cabnet, but the drawer looked like it had been opened and shut. [when you shut it with the keys still in it, we normally lift up the keys so to not close them into the drawer] but the keys were closed into the drawer.    When i enetered the room, he acted kind of startled and turned back around and went to the place he brings me in the invoices and said soemthing about "is that my invoice, yes it is", touched the top invoice, and walked out of the room, closing the door behind him.   On the floor where he was standing, i found a quarter.      Now, i dont know if any of the money is missing. my boss would be the only one who knows how much was in there before and after he was in the room. but does this sound suspicious?

I recently sold my house and need to come up with a lot of money (about $10,000) to pay my closing costs on my house as a seller. I lived in my house for over three years and have to relocate due to military duties. I had to sell my house fast since I will not be able to cover a house payment and live on base at the sametime since military housing is privatized and all of my basic allowance housing cash is going towards the privatized lender now. I basically took a huge investment loss and will not buy a house ever again in a very, very, very long time (until I retire probably). The buyers of my house basically got anything that they wanted along with cash. Should I take out a personal loan or ask family members for help to cover the closing costs fees? Any advice would be appreciated.

I have had major problems with my neighbors and noise that I have been able to prove to my apartment manager so they decided to ask me if I wanted to move to a different apartment and I said yes. I did not sign ANYTHING that stated the new apartments number on it... it was all signed with the apartment number that I live in now... it was not a new lease... just an agreement for the  one i am in now. They told me that the new apartment was ready and I went to look at it and I cried! There is water damage everywhere and rotting walls and uneven flooring in the bathroom and it was just horrible!!! I went back and told them that I did not want the apartment and I told them why and they told me that they had already leased my apartment to someone else and would have to ask them if it is okay to move them to a different apartment. Were they allowed to do that? I didn't sign anything saying that I was moving... everything said that I was staying. We only spoke about moving me to another apartment and when I viewed it I said "NO"!!! Are they in the wrong here? I don't want to live here anymore because of this.

20090225112406AAfaHBr	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Can my manager threaten to fire me for getting advice from the Union?	I have been working at a company for over eight months, doing a job I really like. It was very hard to learn and the people I work with told me it takes a year to learn how to do it properly (it's a desk job). I thought I was doing all right, I made mistakes but my evaluation scores were improving the first 6 months I was doing the job. I figured I was still learning so that was good.       Two months ago and all of a sudden, my manager started to tell me every little thing I was doing wrong. I became really nervous and started doing more wrong. He constantly complains about how much work he has to do because he has to evaluate me because I am retrained. He said he might move me to a less stressful job (even though the stress didn't start until he started picking on me, but I'd move to another job because I don't want to be unemployed). I think my manager is trying to get rid of me to hire someone he knows in my place, but he's saying it's because I'm doing a bad job (then why was I improving?).      My doctor has told me to go off with stress and gave me a sick note, but I am afraid I will lose my job if I use that, so I went to my Union to ask advice. My manager found out I went to the Union and has now threatened me with disciplinary action just because I talked to the Union. I told my manager that I didn't tell the Union to take any action, that I only went for advice, but my manager says he has to think about it and he might have to start the process to terminate my job. I think all this is unfair.       Can he fire me just for getting advice from the Union? I'm actually afraid to go back to the Union even to ask this question because I am afraid he will find out and fire me just for going. I don't want to lose the job so quitting is not an option.

20090226151757AA5IEgJ	Business & Finance;Credit	Can i fight an auto judgment after so long?	I had just moved to Orlando, FL in 2001 or so. I was involved in a car accident and still had my New Hampshire valid license and tags. I didn't have insurance at the time. I was rear ended and spun out on the highway in Orlando. The state trooper, who didn't see the accident occur, said it was an illegal lane change, even though I was the car in front and used my directional. I was then sued for $7,300 after i moved back to NH. I recently went to buy a house and this judgment made the deal fall through. I understand FL is a "no-fault state". My vehicle was totaled and I received nothing for damages. My question is how can I fight the judgment without paying the full amount. I was never notified of this being sent to my credit and ruining everything for a measly car accident.
20090226151859AAqaVsO	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Feud with coworker help?	My co-worker and I got into a email fight.  I took a call for her one day and the person kept calling me about the issue for 2 months when my co-worker wasn't in the office (which I then set reminders for my co-worker to handle).       One day I got an angry voice mail from this person and was already super busy and stressed out about my own work so I just forwarded it to her and sent an email saying "Sorry I'm not spending anymore time on this account. I forwarded you her voice mail."      The response was rude so, of course, I responded the same way. This went back and forth and I ended up saying she was acting like an asshole and not to take her problem out on me. Yay... not the brightest but I felt like the email had already went from a business matter to a personal matter.      So, she has been ignoring me completely since. Every time I've spoken to her, she rolls her eyes like crazy.      I know I took out my frustration with that consumer on my co-worker and definitely shouldn't have. She and I used to be cool... no issues... and now it's like I've done something really ****** up when it was just a stupid argument.      Tonight I sat down next to her and told her we needed to talk and clear the air.  She said no and wouldn't even look up from her computer screen. She said she doesn't care and she's on the clock. I said fine and walked away.      She then got up and took a 10 minute smoke break.      I'm pissed. I feel like this tension is making it impossible for us to work together and making me very uncomfortable because of other office politics that are too stupid to go into.      So, what do I do here? This girl is untrustworthy and unforgiving.  I've already talked about it with someone who used to work close to her like I am now. His advice was beware.      My first instinct is to go to our supervisor. I tried to handle this professionally and one on one with her. She is acting like a child.

I'm in my sophomore year of high school, but people ask me what I want to be and study when I go to college. I don't know this yet. I've been leaning towards musician, but I have a feeling I wouldn't make it. I do write my own songs on the piano which I've been playing for 9 years now, but I may want to do something with mental health. Or maybe a doctor. But i want to be successful. What should I do?    But not too much school, like 8 years, you know?

20090226095441AAhQMGi	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	2 week suspension with pay?	MY bf is a Assistant Distribution Operations Manager, and his boss who has been making things very difficult at work for him for a long time now for no reason. (We believe it is because he is jealous my bf has done so well and fears him taking his job)   Yesterday my bf was going to be a little late for work like 30 minutes, so he called his boss to say he'd be late, and his boss just hung up on him.  So my bf being upset by this he decided to work at the warehouse in the other side of town, thinking he'd work there avoiding seeing his boss who was being unreasonable.  (he only worked there for 2 hours then returned to the other warehouse)   His boss then told him to go home early and think about what he had done!     Then today he got to work and his boss sent him home again saying "I'm giving you 2 weeks suspension with pay and you can think about what it is you have done, and so I can decide what we will do with you!?"   I am so upset right now this isn't fair, my bf runs the warehouse and has a whole team of employees who really respect him, he has turned this place upside down since he started 6 months ago, and has worked incredibly hard!  I fear his boss is simply looking for ANY reason to fire my bf over jealousy and now he has a reason ... which to me doesn't seem like much of a reason?!        Is there any way he can fight this?  How can someone be fired for this?!  Doesn't all the hard work and everything he has done weigh out this... he was very sympathetic and apologetic for what he had done, explaining he didn't think what he was doing was wrong or else he wouldn't have done it.  It's like they dont care and just want him fired for whatever reason?
