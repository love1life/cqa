Not only does she get beat, but the photos are released?  How sick are the paparazzi that they had to dig up this photo (and probably paid someone top dollar for it).

a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	I'm not trying to sound too profound right now, but the fact is that Many of these coincidences occur quite frequently. so then, can they really be called coincidences? The fact is, yes, they are. There's no higher power deeming that you see such and such a person at a certain time, and there's no way to control such a random social interaction, unless of course it was controlled in the first place, and then that person would be a stalker. Different story though. btw, have you ever noticed that when you learn a new word, or hear a word you haven't heard in a while, you hear it in normal conversation or on TV like, the  next day? Maybe that's just me, but that's something that happens to me quite a bit. We truly do live in a small world, and it is pure coincidence for us to randomly (note the word randomly) run into somebody we have history with after we haven't seen that person in a very long time.

ul1P1qAQaa	I don't think a lot of people are in need of that type of research. If you're talking about being payed to do it, the research is geared towards understanding the brain neuroscience... and the application would be psychiatry... with global economy taking a dive therapists are doing very well. Otherwise you could do just about anything that deals with people if you truly understand how they think. My major says I study Spanish, but  I'm actually comparing the linguistic structures of two different languages as it relates to the conceptualization of self and truth, as relates to educational pedagogy. My dad majored in psychology, and ended up sitting in a cubical for 30 years as a computer analyst and data systems architect. He was payed very well, but I don't know if anything less than a Phd in psychiatry is going to land you your dream job, unless there it can provide knowledge that hasn't already been found. Ask yourself what you could fix, and not what you could get payed for... if your psychological research isn't going to solve any of the more pressing issues right now, you might be hard-pressed for a job.|`|JV6NFr5Raa	i think you should be a male stripper.  it would be sweet! <br>  you know you wanna :)<br>  just do it<br>  come on<br>  for me???

IVGGvxVIaa	I think the main reason for making fun of the Neanderthals is found in a combination of fear of the unknown and the arrogant stance of humans today, that we are literally the best thing evolution had to offer.<br>  We the Homo sapiens rule the world and therefor the Neanderthals (that in all fairness shouldn't be compared to the modern humans of the 21. century but to his contemporaries ) had to be less evolved less capable of survival and thus less clever and dumb. The proverbial cavemen. <br>  With the same arrogance we discredit most animals and consider Chimps and any of the great apes uncivilized, inhuman and unworthy our brotherly support. <br>  Only few differences in our genetic make-up, but to most people Chimps are animals just like fish or insects....|`|sX9Ilrpxaa	The Neandertal type specimen (Neandertal 1) also has something to do with this. The discovery of this individual marked the beginning of human paleontology.  Because scientists had nothing but modern humans to compare it too, its morphology must have seemed drastically different and primitive.  Discovery of more ancient hominids over the following century and a half showed how derived Neandertals really were, but the reputation had already stuck with the public.<br>  <br>  Another issue with the type specimen is pathology.  This individual was actually very old, and had arthritis in his spine.  Early paleoanthropologists didn't catch this, and interpreted his hunched back as normal posture for the species.  This gives us the stereotype of the humpbacked cave man.<br>  <br>  I think the main reason for the popular "caveman" stereotype is that humans like to think of themselves as unique, and outside of nature.  When a species as close to us as Neathertals are is discussed, it is unsettling (especially since our species likely drove them to extinction). Our place in nature is unsettling (especially to those who believe we were specially created).  Hollywood and the media play on this, and exaggerate the differences to make us feel more comfortable.  It's really excellent that you notice this and initiated a discussion on it.  I think we need to do more to address this issue with the public.|`|BGwQWe5Caa	Because we. as homo sapiens, have it in our nature to cast out or make fun of anything different from ourselves.

As such, no one can tell you that you should or shouldn't give money to siblings, parents, strangers, friends, etc. Instead, it's a matter of your hierarchy of values. If you are willing, and able, to provide for others, then that is your option.  Whether you do so depends on your personal values of these people individually. No one has the right to lay claim to what is yours.

You are the most important person in you're life. I try to live as self sufficient, and independent as possible, i dunno i just like being prepared for any situation.

What matters is the quality of the time that you have together.  If you no longer feel that he is head over heels about you, then every additional day is just an additional day... it's not the continuance of a relationship.<br>  <br>  That WTF needs to be directed to him.  Talk to him about it.  Ask him what he means by you needing to "earn" his affection.  Or maybe in your heart you already know.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being together for 3 years and realizing that you have different needs, interests, and wants, then going your separate ways.<br>  <br>  There is EVERYTHING wrong with staying together another 3 years and remaining unhappy and only periodically loved by someone who really isn't your "partner".<br>  ____________________<br>  <br>  Actually, even the D&G bad and dinner at a restaurant is quantity.  Those are things.  Yes, we like getting them, but really, is that what a good relationship is all about?  Far from it.  There are plenty of women with loads of material goods who are miserable because they don't have a partner who truly loves them, just buys them things.<br>  <br>  Don't quantify love with items.  Items lose value quickly.  The quality of your love through mutual partnership and affection lasts much longer... provided it is there.
ul1P1qAQaa	Depends on what art is being performed I would imagine, and what kind of psychological development you're talking about. Art is a form of creativity, creativity: if you look it up in the dictionary is anything related to or involving imagination or original ideas... I would guess that a child who's never seen people act on original ideas would be less likely to see the range of potential with which they can act on or recreate their own... which is really one of the few characteristics that really distinguishes humans from any other intelligent animal. Plenty of animals communicate... we are the only one's who distinguish the significance of a message from the concept or idea itself... and then to give tribute to the concept itself... by embodying it through performance itself...(probably very related to the conceptualization of self as similar to but separate from our mother and father... and from everything else).... <br>  <br>  Then again, I'm not a psychologist, I just know that even some of the greatest psychologists don't know the origins of the very ideas they used to form their theories... they just form them... progress for the sake of progress.

el8yX5q3aa	I think you are a socialist.  It is up to each person and their family to provide.  I DID NOT HAVE ANY SAY in how many babies people can have or what they do with their lives.!  Why should they sit on their butt and collect welfare (and many make a life choice out of this) while my husband and I worked two and three jobs each to make our lives comfortable.?<br>  <br>  I DID not have any say in people overextending their credit or using food stamps for mortgage payments when Clinton said it was ok.  I DID NOT have any say and DO NOT think it is fair for me to pay for those that pay for cell phones and expensive shoes and x boxes etc when they are taking government money  and then whining about I haven't got enough.   WORK for it.  Get two  jobs if you have to. <br>  <br>  I DO NOT MIND...and HAVE HELPED many people financially over my lifetime.  My husband and I have willingly helped many and not gotten one penny back for it.  We have put people through college and paid house payments and paid for a car for a mother who had a job and children but no way to get to work...we have helped homeless people etc.  So I do not think it is up to YOU or anyone to say I have to give more and make YOUR life or anyone's life more comfortable while you make mine miserable.<br>  <br>  People have to accept responsiblity and if you have to struggle when you are young...well ...welcome to the world.  We were young once too and we struggled...so much so we bought 1 dollar pair shoes for the kids....and ate beans for two weeks....we didn't ask for help and didn't expect it.<br>  <br>  WE had children..WE bought the house...WE had our own life to pay for and to ask someone else to pay for MY life and what I WANT is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  It is time for people to grow up and stop having government pay for everything for them.  Right now there is no incentive for anyone to pay a mortgage or a bill.  Right now they expect the government to pay it all.  RIDICULOUS...we have over 2 TRILLION bucks to pay out and who is going to pay for that/  I AM...MY TAXES...and I know damn well those people that come into the store and are buying lobster and shrimp with the foodstamps are eating much better than I am when I eat ground beef!    It is about priorities and choices and sacrafices.  Kids do not neet cell phones and play stations and 100 dollar shoes and they certainly don't need to be eating lobster!  I SEE IT DUDE...I SEE IT ALL THE TIME.  I SAW IT TODAY AT WORK....<br>  <br>  A family paying with foodstamps while two kids were on cell phones...buying lobster and shrimp and one with a hand held play station.  HOW DO THEY DO IT?   I worked TWO JOBS to get that privliege!|`|BUvvstsjaa	We never lived like a thief, because we're not thieves.  You want to justify it, but we can't live with ourselves when we do something wrong.<br>  Anyway, what do you need?  You probably have alot already.  Maybe you want just enough money so you don't have to think twice about paying the bills.  I can understand that.<br>  <br>  The people who you're looking at, may not be as happy as they look.
a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	Eh, that can go either way. I don't think it's a sibling that influences one's developmental progress, but rather the parents. Clingy parents tend to yield clingy children, and the thought of leaving home often terrifies kids like this. Having an older sibling whom the younger one sees going away to college, and getting a degree, and getting a job can have a really good affect on the younger sibling, because it gives them something to live up to, which is perfectly healthy. I guess what I'm trying to say is, since siblings tend to have their own lives anyway, having a sibling has minimal influence on one's sociality, and it rather depends on one's personality.

s9aTmNHQaa	You describe yourself so well its like you are talking about someone else.  It sounds like you haven't learnt any social skills in this area (no thats not a judgement just an observation).  You seem to be just 'letting yourself go' everytime something happens to you, then later you wonder what is 'wrong' with you. <br>  First thing in social skills you have to learn is control.  Control of self.  It requires practice, but it is achievable.  Human beings live in patterns. For a week practice this:  Everytime something - good or bad, happens to you, don't physicaly or emotionaly react.  Just breathe deeply.  Take 5 deep breaths in and out and then tell yourself: I am totaly in control of myself, and choose not to react to what happens to me, what I choose for myself is private to me. <br>  A good pschologist will help you form new patterns.  Ultimately that is what it is all about, you choosing a different way of life for yourself, and finding someone who will help you do it.|`|kqXQA2ILaa	because they are pessimistic.|`|mDnjTzxCaa	Hi. As the previous answer says you sound too paranoid, although not manic. I don't think you have a manic depression.

I take everything personally. If someone at work isn't talking, I cannot rest easy in my skin until I figure out if I did something wrong, etc. In my head I know people are living their lives and it has nothing to do with me, but some crazy reaction goes on inside and I cannot help that. <br>  <br>  On the other hand I do not blame people for what happens in my life. You've got to outgrow that real quick. Unless your mom drank draino and made you all deformed, then you have no one to blame for anything except yourself. Your actions or inaction inspires the way others treat you. If you're a crappy person, people will be crappy to you and you cannot hold that against them. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck with trying to figure yourself out. I've gotten a little further in my own life, but the world outside seems to be getting more and more bewildering.|`|d355e8617f6a21d3afd64ba4cf2d1fd2aa	Maybe you should ask a professional. None of that is normal to do to that extent.  You sound paranoid and maybe a bit manic.  No offense. You did ask.  But seriously.  None of that is normal.
3urQfMffaa	they're flirting with insecurity. of course, that's annoying, but they somehow can't help it.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	better things to do than argue with silly @sses|`|W1xs3vYBaa	Because they have low self confidence and esteem. Many people take it as a personal slight to be wrong, and feel like they have to dominate and control to be right. <br>  <br>  Many people like this lie about IQ and bring it up because our society has presented IQ in the wrong light. They perceive a high IQ as being superior because people use terms like "genius", which carries a certain level of respect, and most people who quote high IQ's want such respect, even though they have not earned it. <br>  IQ does not mean you have any more knowledge than someone else, it is a test that estimates that capabilities of ones mind but not how much knowledge and wisdom is inside that persons mind. Quoting a high IQ to say they are "intellectually superior" is completely inappropriate, especially since high IQ's are near impossible to estimate. <br>  <br>  The person with the largest recorded IQ, M, V. Savant, has scored as high as 228 on an IQ test, and "as low" as 168. This means her deviation is 60 points, and this is normal for those with a high IQ because the test was not designed to quantify the fringe of the bell curve. It was originally intended to find those with mental defects below 85 IQ points, a much simpler task than estimating an IQ above 130. <br>  <br>  If someone really understands what their IQ means and have utilized it they will not bring it up as their means to boost their argument, they'll use real, quotable, facts. <br>  <br>  Just roll your eyes at people who quote their IQ scores in order to convince you that what they say is correct because they're full of it. However, if someone refers to their BA, MA, or PhD which was obtained in the field that you are discussing maybe pay them some mind- but even then they should present more evidence than just their piece of paper to convince you of something.|`|mDnjTzxCaa	Hi. If indeed they are directly referring to their "superior" intelligence, that's probably because they themselves want to believe that they are intelligent and of course want some confirmation from you as a boost. They try to dominate conversations because they need to be noticed, they need to be flattered. These bevaviours point out to a deep primary need: Love. In order to be able to love themselves they struggle desperately to be loved by other people.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Probably they are insecure and unsure of their own intelligence so need to try and prove and convince themselves otherwise?|`|LguXFbvsaa	Oh God; I'm totally that person.|`|paDPCDIsaa	<a href="http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check

3VpMNZBZaa	No leer bien las preguntas o no saber escuchar es la carga que en estos tiempos, donde debe sacarse provecho de todo lo mas pronto posible, nos vemos obligados a soportar... Desde la situación mas simple, cuando en un examen los nervios nos traicionan y no leemos bien las preguntas errando así en las respuestas, hasta cualquier situación de la vida real donde se exige una reacción rápida, que solo nos lleva a aplicar una concepción de las cosas superficial simple y preconcebida, la mayoría de la veces en que eso ocurre ni siquiera nos damos cuenta. Es una pena que la vida se trate de vivir a toda velocidad pero el efecto de la competitividad pesa bastante, así hay mucha gente que quiere llegar antes, vivir mas cosas en menos tiempo, estar antes que los demás, tener mas, etc... Se ha perdido la vida pausada donde cada cosa lleva su tiempo, donde cada placer puede ser deleitado, donde cada tarea puede llevarse a cabo de la forma mas correcta y agradable posible independientemente del costo del tiempo... "Oh témpora, oh mores"...|`|70aXFFudaa	ellos cuando quieren algo lo quieren  ya???? asi son, no sola mente no leen , ni escuchan sino que ademas lo que hacen por consecuensia lo hacen mal.|`|DyyLkr4kaa	La mayoría de las personas no se preocupa por las preguntas,sean ajenas o propias sólo se interesa porque haya respuesta.|`|I2z7YhG7aa	SI YO PIENSO QUE LA GALLINA FUE PRIMERO QUE EL HUEVO...

rV36qXWGaa	Estoy de acuerdo con todos, Chimol, las escuelas privadas sólo buscan la manera de obtener más dinero. Pero mira, claro que angustia saber que te has esforzado por aprobar tus materias y que por una causa que no estaba en tus manos (caramba, es tu salud) tus esfuerzos no vayan a obtener el beneficio, es injusto, por supuesto. Pero, bueno, al menos sabes que de ti no quedó, que tú hiciste tu parte y más. Lo que queda es tratar de ver por todos los medios (un permiso o justificante médico) algo que pueda comprobar la razón de tus faltas. <br>  <br>  Ahora bien, es verdad que uno tiende a preocuparse por cosas que al final no valen la pena, no valen las mortificaciones que uno pasa; solemos hasta sacrificar nuestra salud, familia, etc., por el trabajo, por obtener buenas notas, por tener más dinero... Sí, siempre hay que hacer todo lo mejor posible, pero, en serio, al final uno se da cuenta que esas cosas en realidad no valían todo el sacrificio. Además, te repito, quédate tranquila, pues tú diste todo lo que estaba en tus manos.<br>  <br>  P. S. Son etapas. En esta etapa de tu vida lo más importante (o una de las cosas más importantes para ti) es tu carrera y por eso en este momento sientes que lo que está pasándote (lo que están haciéndote, más bien) es lo peor. Cuando tengas hijos, por ejemplo (suponiendo que los tengas), lo más importante serán ellos y lo que más te preocupará será su bienestar y dirás "cómo pude deprimirme por una notas, por una materia o un semestre".... ?Me entiendes? Cada etapa de nuestra vida tiene sus problemas y en cada una esos problemas son los peores.<br>  <br>  Tú calmada, que seguro eres una chica responsable (por eso te preocupa esta situación) e inteligente y sacarás adelante tus materias.|`|5f3796f5d4146b875e2bff5fa00a2169aa	Es que en las escuelas privadas solo te quieren sacar el dinero, lo que mas importa para ellos, es tu bolsillo y no tu esfurzo......... lastima, pero asi funcionan......... suerte.|`|d6ca91082b66c5c5c0c7a6289564266daa	llevales una acta de defusion haber si te creen|`|idvdXnc7aa	y lo que mejor podes hacer es seguir estudiando porque si estas sacando la licenciatura tal vez asi te queden las cosas mas claras y sacarte de las dudas por no estar en las clases con te pusiste enferma|`|32a4d2958f51cdbb5e0de5df007a721faa	de verdad no le des tanta importancia a eso, hay cosas mucho mas importantes en la vida, no todo debe girar en torno a eso.<br>  <br>  kien de nosotros no ha obtenido malas notas, o reprobado o algo asi y nadie ha fallecido por eso, solo relajate y todo saldra bien, para mi es mas importante sentirme bien, tener salud, estar de buen animo ke tener buenas calificaciones.|`|jm6bt1slaa	porque no tratas de conseguir una carta del medico... yo trataria de hablar con todo mundo a ver quien me puede ayudar... porque eso no se me hace justo.....

Julgam-se os melhores do mundo e o modelo de perfei??o a ser seguido por todos, n?o admitindo absolutamente nenhuma resistência às suas pretens?es. A esperan?a é que um dia isso tudo vai mudar. Os impérios Romano e de Alexandre Magno também tiveram seus períodos de glória mas, depois, conheceram a ruína. Quem sabe, nós, ainda teremos a oportunidade de testemunhar os norte-americanos serem obrigados a negociar através do diálogo e n?o usar suas armas para praticar os maiores atos de terrorismo que se tem notícias.

S?o capazes de atos filantrópicos do tipo que o Bill Gates fez recentemente, ou seja, doar 80% de sua fortuna, assim como Warren Buffet, que doou 85% da sua, seguindo o exemplo de pioneiros como Andrew Carnegie e Rockfeller que fizeram o mesmo no início do século XX e n?o vemos muito disso aqui no Brasil.  Bom,  quem sabe  o Ant?nio  Hermírio de Morais, os Gerdau, os Roberto Marinho, só pra citar uns mais conhecidos,  nos surpreenda uma hora dessas!<br>  Mas independente de filantropia, os americanos souberam administrar seu país, nunca tiveram medo de se meter em encrenca pra no final ganhar dinheiro, n?o tem escrúpulos, s?o capazes de vender armas até para seus próprios inimigos, mas no final podemos dizer que s?o um povo que tem atitude, tem coragem, briga por seus direitos e n?o fica em cima do muro e sobretudo, sabem reconhecer talentos. Eles procuram o que é melhor pra eles como povo, doa a quem doer!<br>  Já os brasileiros... procuram o que é melhor para eles como indivíduos!<br>  O engra?ado é que nossa composi??o étnica é muito parecida, temos países de tamanhos muito próximos, e mesmo nossa história ao menos no macro, é parecida, afinal fomos descobertos na mesma época, colonizados por europeus,  adotamos a escravid?o por um bom espa?o de tempo e no final, recebemos ondas de imigrantes da Europa e da ásia no final do século dezenove e início do século XX.<br>  Ent?o acho que a grande pergunta é: Onde é que nós erramos??<br>  Ou será que o fato de sermos católicos, por um lado e termos sido colonizados por um povo latino foi t?o preponderante assim??<br>  Talvez essa seja uma nova boa pergunta!|`|La07oBCMaa	Os dem?nios descem do Norte.|`|M9O73QgPaa	O maior império que esse planeta ja viu desde Roma.

Antes de la pubertad son sometidas a la circuncinsión femenina que es un ritual. Millones de mujeres de distintos países y culturas: africanas, amerindias y asiáticas han sido sometidas a la clitoridectomía, acompa?ado muchas veces de la infibulación.<br>  <br>  La clitoridectomía consiste en la extirpación cruenta del clítoris es llevada a cabo con ayuda de instrumentos rudimentarios o por arrancamiento mediante un imperdible.<br>  <br>  La infibulación es el cosido y cerramiento casi total de los labios mayores y menores de la vulva con diversos materiales: fibras vegetales, alambre, hilo de pescar...<br>  <br>  Las consecuencias son infecciones, hemorragias, que terminan muchas veces con la muerte. A largo plazo también puede provocar una retracción defectuosa de la piel que ocasiona una manera peculiar de andar( pasos cortos y rodillas juntas), la incapacidad física de experimentar sensación placentera derivada del contacto sexual.<br>  <br>  El motivo de tales prácticas aluden a la interpretación de algunos fascículos del Corán. De ahí que los exégetas del texto se apresuraron a especificar con todo detalle, desde la conveniencia moral hasta las circunstancias mecánicas de la intervención. El encargado de la operación puede ser el barbero que podría emplear la misma herramienta para esterilizar al ganado o para arreglar un par de sandalias.<br>  <br>  En otras culturas se considera el clítoris como un resto indeseable de la personalidad masculina que ha de ser eliminado del cuerpo femenino.<br>  <br>  Los aspectos sociales que ha producido este fenómeno son curiosos, el peculiar modo de caminar de una mujer infibulada llega a ser considerado como un elemento estético y es deliberadamente exagerado como podría serlo el contoneo de caderas de una mujer occidental.

No, primero, el éxito en el trabajo no se da de la noche a la ma?ana. Segundo, hay que gastar de acuerdo a lo que tenemos, por lo tanto no te metas en algo que represente gastos excesivos, vive sencillamente con lo necesario para estar bien y los lujos y las cosas superfluas dejalas para los que no tienen otra forma de llenar sus vidas mas que con cosas materiales.  Por ultimo hay un dicho que dice: mas vale solo que mal acompa?ado, no es necesario tener a alguien para vivir y menos el sexo, eso déjalo para cuando sientas amor verdadero y verás que es de otra dimensión.  No conviertas al amor y a las relaciones de pareja en un pasatiempo o en algo que se hace solo por hacerlo.  El infierno ni lo menciones, no te imaginas que sería eso.   Tienes trabajo (como burro dijiste), tienes dinesro para pagar y al no tener relaciones no corres el riesgo de contraer una enfermedad o un asunto de toda la vida (un bebé), creo que eres afortunado y la proxima vez que te sientas como en el infierno piensa en la gente que no tiene trabajo, que estan postrados en una cama enfermos, que pasan por una depresión, que tienen graves problemas que parecen no tener solución, etc.   Trabaja, disfruta tu trabajo y a tus compa?eros,  acércate a Dios y verás lo que son los milagros.. perdedor es aquel que provoca que todo le salga mal no?|`|cSH4h1kfaa	Tu lo has dicho...

yJP7xHluaa	bueno primero que nada yo se que los sue?os son expresions de nuestro inconsiente...y reflejan nuestros deseos reprimidos<br>  lo que yo puedo notar en el sue?o y sin ser una experta en el rubro, es algo que queda mas que claro, como te fuiste de tu pais y no pudiste decir todo eso que en el sue?o si expresas es como para ti una deuda pendiente.<br>  y con respecto  a el sue?o de tu ex sinceramente tu sola lo expresas<br>  en la vida real no estaban bien por eso es que tu te sue?as con el de lo mas feliz , justamente por que era eso lo que no tenias y ansiabas<br>  espero haberte sido de ayuda <br>  adios|`|7ac5d37810812c76643dfb50094e5bc8aa	Pues si como ya te dijeron es como un pendiente que tienes a lo mejor no pudiste decirle eso que querias y por eso sue?as asi, pues que triste que te sientas asi, tal vez tienes razón en que todavía sientes algo por tu ex, y ya se que es algo dificil, peor creo que deberías olvidarlo, o sea superarlo recordarlo por los buenos momentos que pasaron y ps  no se conoce más gente, es lo que te podría decir, cuidate!|`|a6dc5f4654a8adc12c0c01d1df9feb12aa	no entendi muy bien tu descripcion porque hablas primero de tu ex novio y lo tomas como femenino, en fin , cosas del teclado. Creo que este sue?o no necesita mucha interpretacion, el hecho que esten los dos en una misma casa quiere decir que tienen un laso muy fuerte, pero sino pueden hablarse por X cosas es porque se ha ido poniendo sobre ese lazo cosas que los han ido alejando, mas no destruyendo el lazo.Otro punto importante es que o pudiste decirle ke lo kerias y k lo perdonas , quiere decir ke hay una parte de ti que aun no perdona. <br>  <br>  Tienes que perdonarlo si quieres volver a empezar una nueva relacion. Veras que cuando encuentres otro amor y perdones te reiras de todo lo sucedido.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|0cEY4yEoaa	Lo que pasa, es que seguramente le guardabas rencor a la novia de tu ex, y ahora que estás en otro pais, pues sientes que quisieras encontrarla para reconciliar eso que sentias, que ahora ya no sientes, para sentirte tranquila, en cuanto de que todavia quieres a tu novio lo dudo mucho, tal vez lo sue?as como algo que hubiera sido bonito y que de verdad no existió en la realidad. Saludos.|`|efsaF29Uaa	yo creo que tienes un conflicto de emociones  tu eres noble al perdonarla pero no le dices porque  realmente no sabes como , fuistes herida de esa forma y no es fasil , sobre todo porque querias a tu novio y creo que aun lo quires , la verdad es ella la que deberia pedirte perdon .si yo se que tambien sonaria raro "oye te quite tu novio perdoname" pero tu no hicistes mal fue ella . pero bien si tu la perdonas hazlo saber de forma sutil  eres muy noble   ciao  y suerte

LYvjV3oQaa	Hola!<br>  No sé que edad tienes pero cuando somos jóvenes (faltos de experiencia) vivimos planeando todo con mucho detalle. Por ejemplo vamos a suponer una conversación con una chica. Hacemos castillos en el aire y con anticipación suponemos lo que ella va a decir para inmediatamente decirle lo que ya teníamos planeado, sin embargo en la realidad las cosas van a cambiar y nos vamos a ver de golpe ante situaciones inesperadas, que al no resultar como queríamos nos llenan de frustración.<br>  Hemos nacido para ser felices sin embargo creemos que la felicidad es tener chicas (para algunos), para otros acumular títulos, tener una casa en la playa, mucho dinero, etc. Sin embargo nada de eso nos da la felicidad. La felicidad es la capacidad de disfrutar lo que tenemos. Por ejemplo, si no tuviera novia o esposa no tenemos por qué ser infelices sino más bien vivir con la convicción de que en su momento encontraremos a la persona que queremos, sin ser infelices y siempre disfrutando de la vida. Al vivir así, estaremos dejando que la vida fluya, no estaremos forzando situaciones, cada día será diferente y siempre estaremos recibiendo sorpresas agradables.<br>  Ser feliz es disfrutar de la lluvia y del sol, de la comida y de hacer el amor, de la música o de una buena película, de la conversación con amigos, de estar solo o rodeado de muchos, de los estudios y de lo que la vida nos presente.<br>  Todo en esta vida tiene solución. La vida ES FáCIL, nada más que a nosotros nos gusta complicarnos la vida o permitir que otros nos la compliquen.<br>  He estado en varias ocasiones admirando la belleza del día, el paisaje que me rodea, etc., etc. mientras a mi lado ha habido personas malhumoradas renegando por su situación. Por más rabia que experimentemos no va a dejar de hacer sol o de llover. Hasta la hora más negra sólo tiene 60 minutos.<br>  Debemos llenarnos de una actitud positiva, analizar cualquier problema y las posibles soluciones, hasta llegar a encontrar la mejor. Si tenemos dudas entonces podremos buscar ayuda. Recuerda que ningún médico o psicólogo anda casa por casa viendo a ver si hay pacientes. Más bien si yo tengo un problema de la clase que sea yo soy quien debe buscar ayuda, y a nadie le molesta dar ayuda a quien la sepa solicitar.<br>  "Justifica tus limitaciones y ciertamente las tendrás" es una frase de Richard Bach, que te puede ayudar mucho.<br>  Hay otra aunque no recuerdo el nombre de su autor que dice: "el pesimista se hunde antes de la experiencia mientras que el optimista flota después del fracaso", aunque yo agregaría que el fracaso no existe como tal y que todos los golpes, contratiempos, accidentes, problemas que experimentamos en la vida tienen un propósito: mostrarnos nuestros errores para que no los volvamos a cometer.<br>  Te recomiendo leer el texto de Desiderata, o escuchar la versión musical. Puedes encontrarla en el siguiente link: <a href="http://www.mentespositivas.com.ar/poemas/11desiderata.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mentespositivas.com.ar/poemas...</a><br>  y recuerda lo siguiente: "tú eres una criatura del universo, no menos que las plantas y las  estrellas, tienes derecho a existir".<br>  Un saludo a la distancia. "Esfuérzate por ser feliz!!!!"|`|TnY3akHNaa	vuelvete evangelista o algo asi<br>  <br>  o mejor planea mas las cosas, ?por que dejar las cosas en manos de Dios, si nisiquiera sabes si Dios tiene manos?|`|kiasXdX1aa	Amigo.... te comprendo pues en muchas oportunidades me he sentido como tú te sientes ahora y también he pensado en la misma salida que tú, pero.....te aseguro que todo sufrimiento y percanse que tenemos en la vida nos sirve para hacernos personas más fuertes y maduras, lo que nos va a servir en el futuro para saber afrontar un sin número de problemas en el que otras personas no soportarían esa presión, pero como nosotros ya hemos sufrido lo suficiente, entonces ya hemos aprendido a nadar contra corriente.<br>  <br>  No te desanimes amigo.... siempre hay alguien que espera por nosotros y a quien le importamos aunquesea un poquito y no es justo que esta personita o personitas tan especiales sufran por causa nuestra ?no lo crees?<br>  <br>  Se fuerte y piensa que no hay mal que dure 100 a?os...todo pasa amigo....solo pon un poquito de tu parte y verás.....!!!<br>  <br>  Un beso y anímate por favor.....!!!|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	"Siempre una desdicha te deja una ense?anza".

Para nada yo soy partidario de aumentar las penas ? Entonces ? A mi criterio la cárcel , solo sirve para apartar de la sociedad , los elementos inadaptados que pueden da?arla y en menor medida desanimar a otros  de cometer delitos . En el caso de los violadores puede evitarse ,que vuelvan a delinquir simplemente castrándolo , y no es necesario apelar a métodos sangrientos , la castración química es tan efectiva como la extirpacion de los testículos . Los violadores seriales , son psicópatas que siempre reinciden , no existe otra solución .

La cultura constituye un factor mucho más importante a la hora de determinar la conducta y estilo de vida de los diferentes grupos humanos.<br>  El término raza es polémico por las nociones de superioridad e inferioridad que lleva implícitas. La raza constituyó la justificación para implantar el estado de esclavitud, la persecución de minorías y otros grupos sociales, como la del pueblo judío durante la Alemania nazi, o el sistema de apartheid en Suráfrica.<br>  Históricamente, los antropólogos físicos  habían dividido a la humanidad, atendiendo a sus rasgos morfológicos, en tres grandes subdivisiones o razas: negroide, mongoloide y caucasiana. Algunos científicos fueron más allá a?adiendo la amerindia y la oceánica.<br>  Como concepto biológico, la raza era más evidente cuando las diferencias hacían referencia a los rasgos morfológicos, como la pigmentación de la piel, el color, forma y grosor del cabello, la forma de la nariz o la estructura corporal. La aparición del análisis genético vino a refutar esta idea. Antes de esta definición, la clasificación de las razas dependía de una combinación de factores geográficos, ecológicos y morfológicos.<br>  En la segunda mitad del siglo XX, las investigaciones sobre las distribuciones de frecuencias de genes invalidó este enfoque. Concebir fronteras nítidas entre las diferentes razas era posible desde el punto de vista morfológico, pero la utilización del análisis genético demostró que las variantes hereditarias eran indiferentes a tales delimitaciones, permitiendo a las razas entremezclarse a través de otras formas intermedias. Hoy, a la vista de su movilidad e interrelación cada vez mayor, es patente su número infinito.<br>  El concepto de raza, invalidado por la moderna investigación genética, no ha desaparecido del todo.

Las categorías raciales humanas más usadas están basadas en los carácteres biológicos visibles (especialmente el color de piel y las características faciales), los genes, y la identificación propia. El concepto de raza y la agrupación en razas específicas varía según la cultura y el tiempo. A menudo desata polémicas por razones científicas o por su impacto en la identidad social y la identidad política.<br>  <br>  Desde los a?os 1940, los científicos evolucionistas han rechazado la conceptualización de raza donde un número finito de características esenciales pueden usarse para determinar el número de razas. Muchos científicos evolucionistas y sociales opinan que a la definición común de raza, o a cualquier definición de raza relativa a los humanos, le falta rigor y validez taxonómica. Argumentan que son imprecisas y arbitrarias, y que las razas observadas varían según la cultura examinada.<br>  <br>  La mayor parte de científicos y antropólogos postulan que la especie humana está compuesta por una única raza aunque ésta se divide en diferentes orígenes étnicos, que a su vez se dividen en pueblos. Los cuatro orígenes étnicos principales, que retoman en parte la clasificación original de Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, son el caucasoide, negroide, mongoloide y australoide.<br>  <br>  Este tipo de teorías antropológicas aparecieron en los a?os 1960 como reacción frente a las teorías científicas relativas al predeterminismo biológico y a fenómenos como el segregacionismo y la discriminación racial, presentes por aquel tiempo en el contexto de los países occidentales.<br>  <br>  En la antropología moderna la distinción entre factores biológicos y étnicos o culturales propiamente dichos está mejor definida. Ello se debe a los enfoques multidisciplinarios presentes en las ciencias sociales contemporáneas.<br>  <br>   Variación física en los humanos  [editar]La distribución de muchos rasgos físicos se parece a la distribución de la variación genética dentro de poblaciones humanas entre estas (American Association of Physical Anthropologists 1996; Keita and Kittles 1997). Por ejemplo, ～90% de la variación en la forma de las cabezas humanas ocurre dentro de cada grupo humano, y ～10% separa los grupos, con una mayor variabilidad de las forma de la cabeza entre los individuos con antepasados africanos recientes (Relethford 2002).<br>  <br>  Una excepción prominente a la distribución común de las características físicas dentro de y entre grupos es el color de piel. Aproximadamente un 10% de la variancia en el color de piel ocurre dentro de los grupos, y ~90% occurre entre grupos (Relethford 2002). Esta distribución del color de piel y su patrón geográfico—con gente con antepasados que vivieron predominantemente cerca del ecuador teniedo una piel más oscura que esos con antepasados que vivieron predominantemente en latitudes superiores—indican que este atributo ha estado bajo una fuerte presión selectiva. La piel más oscura parece estar fuertemente seleccionada para la regiones ecuatoriales para prevenir las quemaduras de sol, el cáncer de piel, la fotólisis de folate, y el da?o a las glándulas sudoríparas (Sturm et al. 2001; Rees 2003). Una hipótesis destacada para la selección de un color de piel más claro en latitudes más altas es que permite al cuerpo formar mayores cantidades de vitamina D, que ayuda a prevenir el raquitismo (Jablonski 2004). Las evidencias para esto incluyen el descubrimiento que una porción substancial de las diferencias de color de piel entre los europeos y los africanos reside en un único gen, SLC24A5 el alelo 111 de la treonina que fue encontrado entre el 98,7 y el 100% entre varias muestras de europeos, mientras que la forma alanina-111 se encontró entre el 93 y 100% de las muestras de africanos, asiáticos del este y amerindios (Lamason et al. 2005). Sin embargo, la hipótesis de la vitamina D no está universalmente aceptada (Aoki 2002), y un color de piel más claro en las latitudes más altas puede corresponder simplemente a la ausencia de la selección para la piel oscura (Harding et al. 2000). La melanina que sirve de pigmento, está localizado en la epidermis de la piel, y está basada en la expresión génica hereditaria .<br>  <br>  Porque el color de piel ha estado bajo una fuerte presión selectiva, colores similares de piel pueden resultar de una adaptación convergente en vez de una relación genética. Los africanos subsaharianos, poblaciones tribales del sur de India, y los aborígenes australianos tienen una pigmentación de piel similar, pero geneticamente no son más similares que otros grupos ampliamente separados. Además, en algunas partes del mundo donde gente de diferentes regiones se han mezclado extensivamente, la conexión entre color de piel y ascendencia ha sido substancialmente debilitada (Parra et al. 2004). En Brasil, por ejemplo, el color de piel no está estrechamente asociado con el porcentaje de antepasados africanos recientes que una persona tiene, por estimaciones de un análisis de variantes genéticas que difieren en frecuencia entre los grupos continentales (Parra et al. 2003).<br>  <br>  Una especulación considerable ha rodeado el posible valor adaptivo de otros rasgos físicos característicos de grupos, como la constelación de rasgos faciales observados en muchos asiáticos orientales y nororientales (Guthrie 1996). No obstante, cualquier característica física dada generalmente se encuentra en multiples grupos (Lahr 1996), y demostrar que las presiones selectivas medioambientales formaron rasgos físicos específicos será difícil, ya que estos rasgos pueden haber resultado de la selección sexual de individuos con ciertas apariencias o de la deriva genética (Roseman 2004).<br>  <br>  Las raza en la aplicación de la ley  [editar]En un intento de proporcionar descripciones generales que puedan facilitar el trabajo de la policía buscando detener a los sospechosos, el FBI emplea el término "raza" para resumir la apariencia general (color de piel, textura de pelo, forma del ojo, y otras características fácilmente observables) de los individuos que están intentando detener. Desde la perspectiva de la policía, es generalmente más importante llegar a una descripción que sugerirá fácilmente la apariencia general de un individuo que hacer una categorización científicamente válida. Así además de asignar un individuo a una categoría racial, la descripción incluirá: altura, peso, color de ojos, cicatrices y otras características distintivas, etc. Scotland Yard usa una clasificación basada en los antecendentes étnicos de la sociedad británica: W1 (británico blanco), W2 (irlandés blanco), W9 (cualquier otro origen blanco); M1 (blancos y ****** del Caribe), M2 (blancos y ****** africanos), M3 (blancos y asiáticos), M9 (cualquier otro origen mixto); A1 (asiático-indio), A2 (asiático-pakistaní), A3 (asiático-bengalí), A9 (cualquier otro origen asiático); B1 (****** del Caribe), B2 (****** africanos), B3 (cualquier otro origen *****); O1 (chino), O9 (cualquier otro).<br>  <br>  En 1975, la policía británica comenzó a clasificar a los detenidos según grupos raciales que luego fueron reemplazados por un Código de Identidad:<br>  <br>  IC1 Blanco <br>  IC2 Del Mediterráneo o Hispánico <br>  IC3 Africano/Caribe?o <br>  IC4 Indio/Pakistaní/Bangalí, u otras de Asia <br>  IC5 Chino/Japonés, o personas del sudeste asiático <br>  IC6 árabe/Egipcio/Magreb <br>  IC0 Origen desconocido <br>  En muchos países, el estado está prohibido legalmente de mantener datos basados en la raza, que a menudo hace cuestiones de la policía los letreros de buscados al público que incluye etiquetas como "complexión de piel oscura", etc. Hay controversia sobre la la verdadera relación entre crímenes, sus castigos asignados, y la división de la gente en las llamadas "razas." En los Estados Unidos, la práctica de clasificar en razas ha sido dictaminado inconstitucional y también constituye una violación de los derechos humanos. Hay un activo debate respecto a la causa de una marcada correlación entre los crímenes grabados, los castigos, y la gente "racialmente dividida" del país. Muchos consideran de facto la clasificación racial un ejemplo de racismo institucional en la aplicación de la ley.<br>  <br>  Los trabajos más recientes en la taxonomía racial basada en el análisis de clusters de ADN ha llevado a la aplicación de la ley a perseguir los sospechosos basandóse en su clasificación racial derivada de su evidencia de ADN dejada en la escena del crimen [7]. Aunque polémico, el análisis de ADN ha tenido éxito al ayudar a la policía identificar la raza de la víctima y de los perpetradores. [8]. En un intento de ser menos subjetivo, esta clasificación es llamada "ascendencia biogeográfica" más que "raza"[9] , pero los términos para las categorías BGA son las mismas. La diferencia es que los marcadores informativos de la ascendencia en el ADN identifican el mestizaje de la ascendencia, no la propia identidad étnica. Por lo tanto, no pueden encajar en las "razas" de Estados Unidos. Por ejemplo, el ADN de un árabe-americano, un afroamericano, y un hispano de precisamente la misma mezcla genética afroeuropea sería "racialmente" indistinguible.

dhCTihuyaa	I have always been one but didn't know it.,  It just flow naturally with me as I grew up.  Always thinking and wishing well for others and helping them whenever opportunities does arises.<br>  But when I get to the professional arena, things are different altogether.  This I have found out :- Most is not all in the "people helping" professional are really sick people themselves that need help but aren't or won't want to be aware of the truth.<br>  They are actually "helping themselves to the people they are supposedly meant to help.  Most of these patient do not get well or better but worse.  Coming out of the "politic-of professional helping indutries" and be a free spirit human being can lend you to a beeter position to really help others than the structural and organization institution.  Please reconsider again your ambition or check your heart for the real intent of your soul ?|`|3c524ef8204655765d874fcbb5c9adecaa	The requirements to practice as a professional counsellor will differ from country to country.  Counsellors may be from different professions, having different specialities and focus areas. The most common types of counsellors are psychologists and social workers, but also nurses and members of clergy may practice counselling.  If you want to train to be a professional counsellor, I would suggest taking up studies in social work or psychology, but bearing in mind that professional training could take many years of study, up to six or more.  If you are not able to enter full time study, you could consider doing a short course in counselling and volunteering at a community centre or non-profit centre, such as Lifeline, or rape crisis centre.  This can be just as satisfying, but it is obviously not a paying job.  As a professional counsellor myself, I can say that it is worth the effort, and if you really want it, go for it with all your heart!
1Nd5bhv0aa	My wedding was in Europe as well....The following is some advice I gave to the best man at my wedding, and a friend at a different wedding.. They both ended up giving amazing, personable speeches...<br>  <br>  Do not write out the entire speech... This is a big mistake most people make...Speech writing is for Politicians...  You are not giving a speech, but speaking to friends and family.  Create an outline- I wrote down the names I wanted to thank, then a few topics for stories on back of a business card.  If you list the topics you want to speak about, then you are truly just speaking to everyone like everday...<br>  <br>   If you wrote down and rehersed your speech, then you would focus on trying to remember it, then you would try not to mess up, and if you did, you would get flustered.  Do you see the domino effect of writing a speech and rehersing it?  Just express yourself at the moment in time without trying to remember the words.. You will seem more natural and be able to look at the crowd..  If you are really nervous, wait until after the speech to eat, and don't have more than 2 drinks...<br>  <br>  An example of a topic list(this will force you to paraphrase and speak naturally to everyone without being nervous about remembering lines):<br>  <br>  Thank:  <br>  Ushers- Joke about friend at Bachelor party<br>  Bridesmaids- comment how beautiful<br>  Parents- Last but not least<br>  <br>  Brief comical Story of how we met<br>  <br>  Thank everyone for coming- relax, enjoy, have a drink...<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|DDUCLeVuaa	Write your speech out and practice everyday first by yourself and then with someone that you trust. It will make it easier for you to know what to say when you are up there speaking. Don't get yourself drunk before going up there, I have seen people do this and it is so tacky and you will come out if they are video taping it looking foolish. Also don't do the valium, chances are that you will drink to toast and that could really make the moment unforgettable for you and the guest. You are going to be fine, just write down what it is about the bride that you love and why you believe that they are going to be a happy couple. After writing it, which should be the length of an essay about a three minute or less speech, read it everyday and do it outloud not in your head. I know giving a speech in front of people is nerve wracking but you would be surprised that once you get started and are prepared you will do better than what you imagine yourself. Pace yourself and practice, practice, practice.
de716a7218c6535ff5cb2a195dc59d50aa	Well, here is my thoughts :)<br>  <br>  It would probably depend on the type of theory you chose to follow, but the humanistic approach would explain behaviour occurs when we tryto become a better human being.<br>  <br>  So if you took Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a person's behaviour would reflect that which is needed to attain the various needs Maslow proposed we require.<br>  <br>  And here is something from the Association for Humanistic Psychology:<br>  <br>  The Humanistic View of Human Behavior<br>  <br>  Humanistic psychology is a value orientation that holds a hopeful, constructive view of human beings and of their substantial capacity to be self-determining. It is guided by a conviction that intentionality and ethical values are strong psychological forces, among the basic determinants of human behavior. This conviction leads to an effort to enhance such distinctly human qualities as choice, creativity, the interaction of the body, mind and spirit, and the capacity to become more aware, free, responsible, life-affirming and trustworthy.<br>  <br>  Humanistic psychology acknowledges that the mind is strongly influenced by determining forces in society and in the unconscious, and that some of these are negative and destructive. Humanistic psychology nevertheless emphasizes the independent dignity and worth of human beings and their conscious capacity to develop personal competence and self respect. This value orientation has led to the development of therapies to facilitate personal and interpersonal skills and to enhance the quality of life.<br>  <br>  Since there is much difficulty involved in inner growth, humanistic psychologists often stress the importance of courageously learning to take responsibility for oneself as one confronts personal transitions. The difficulty of encouraging personal growth is matched by the difficulty of developing appropriate institutional and organizational environments in which human beings can flourish. Clearly, societies both help and hinder human growth. Because nourishing environments can make an important contribution to the development of healthy personalities, human needs should be given priority when fashioning social policies. ,This becomes increasingly critical in a rapidly changing world threatened by such dangers as nuclear war, overpopulation and the breakdown of traditional social structures.<br>  <br>  Many humanistic psychologists stress the importance of social change, the challenge of modifying old institutions and inventing new ones able to sustain both human development and organizational efficacy. Thus the humanistic emphasis on individual freedom should be matched by a recognition of our interdependence and our responsibilities to one another, to society and culture, and to the future.|`|46501976c03bb4c7d233be1a091f1fa6aa	No one can judge the behaviour/attitude with their approach.

jBLQoz2faa	Girls when they have their period (?) or ovulation whatever.<br>  They tend to shift their views on whattype of man she wants. Its at this point when they are most fertile. Theres lots of scientific studies done on this subject and all come to the same conclusion. And its been like a proven fact. In this fertile period women will seek other types of men. Men she generally otherwise disliked and did not choose for for various (mostly ethical) reasons. Bad guys namely. This is natural and has to do with evolution that preceeded us.<br>  <br>  If this is true for women and such a thing exists in the nature of women. Having lived alongside women for so long, men must also have evolved in a certain way dont you think? Men must have developed some form of insight to notice this. Its this time around when you get, well like you said,more anxious.. Maybe its something in the way she behaves that triggers your anxiety? She wears more sexy clothes? And you think, hey there could be something wrong here... Maybe she likes to go out alone "with her friends". Meet other men? The anxiety is ancient and its notthere for nothing.. Take it from there..|`|v5JbPcSWaa	I use to until I sought education about why I distant myself from others.  It was because I did not have a balance in my life of people around me.

Las fuentes principales y sus respectivas estimaciones son:<br>  <br>      * Alto Consejo de la Organización Internacional de la Francofonía (1998): 190 millones de francoparlantes, y 110 millones de "francisants": personas que hablan francés con diferente grado de dominio (La fuente es una organización intergubernamental cuyos miembros son los gobiernos de los países con una presencia significativa de la lengua francesa).<br>      * Linguasphere Observatory (1999): 125 millones incluyendo personas translinguales: primera lengua para 90 millones de personas, segunda lengua para 35 millones (La fuente es una red independiente de investigación lingüística con bases en Francia, Gales e India).<br>      * Eurobarómetro (2001): más de 105 millones (28% de 376 millones) hablan francés en la Unión Europea sin contar otros ciudadanos (La fuente es una encuesta de INRA (Europe) s.a. sobre 16.078 personas realizada a requerimiento de la Dirección General de Educación y Cultura de la Comisión Europea).<br>      * SIL (Ethnologue, 15a. edición): primera lengua de 65 millones de personas (La fuente es una institución lingüística con estatus consultivo en UNESCO y la ONU).<br>  <br>  El francés es una de las dos lenguas de trabajo de la ONU, una de las dos lenguas oficiales del Comité Olímpico Internacional, la única lengua oficial de los servicios postales y la lengua principal de la Unión Africana.<br>  <br>  Escritura [editar]<br>  <br>  El francés se escribe con el alfabeto latino. Tiene cinco diacríticos (acento agudo, acento circunflejo, acento grave, cedilla y diéresis), así como una ligadura (?).<br>  <br>  La escritura tiene poco que ver con la pronunciación real. Una característica del francés es el uso de dos o tres letras para indicar un fonema, si bien muchas veces estos fonemas franceses reúnen el caracter de dos fonemas predominando uno de ellos, por ejemplo el dígrafo ou en el francés parisino suena prácticamente como una [u] espa?ola aunque mantiene casi átono algo del fonema [o]. En general, la forma escrita es más conservadora que la forma hablada. La pronunciación típica del francés normativo hace recaer casi siempre el acento prosódico en la última sílaba (agudismo). La bastante frecuente poca correspondencia entre el francés escrito y el hablado es un fenómeno que se debe a los fuertes cambios fonéticos que se han presentado desde el período del francés antiguo, y que no se correspondieron con cambios en la escritura. Sin embargo, han ocurrido algunos cambios conscientes en la escritura para restaurar la ortografía latina:<br>  <br>      * Francés antiguo doit > Francés doigt ?dedo? (Latín digitum)<br>      * Francés antiguo pie > Francés pied ?pie? (Latín pedem)<br>  <br>  A veces los impresores impusieron su propia grafía para evitar ambigüedad:<br>  <br>      * Antes de la imprenta: uit, ocho<br>      * A partir de la imprenta: huit, ocho, evitaba la confusión con vit.<br>  <br>  Es casi imposible predecir la escritura basándose únicamente en la pronunciación. Las consonantes finales, en particular s, x, z, t y d, suelen ser mudas; y n y m son perceptibles incluso al final de palabra porque nasalizan a la vocal que acompa?an. En cambio, c, r, f, y l suelen pronunciarse incluso en posición final. Por ejemplo, las siguientes palabras terminan en consonante, pero en su pronunciación acaban en un sonido vocálico: nez, doigt, pied, aller, les, lit, beaux.<br>  <br>  Los diacríticos tienen un significado fonético, semántico y etimológico.<br>  <br>      * Acento grave (à, è, ù): Sobre la a o la u, únicamente distingue los homófonos entre sí: à (?a?, ?hacia?) contra a (?tiene?), ou (?o?) contra où (?donde?). Sobre una e, indica el sonido /ε/.<br>      * Acento agudo (é): Sobre la e, indica el sonido /e/. Además, suele indicar la omisión histórica de una consonante que seguía a la e (normalmente una s): écouter < escouter.<br>      * Acento circunflejo (a, ê, ?, ?, ?): Sobre la e, indica el sonido /ε/. También puede indicar la omisión histórica de una letra adyacente (normalmente una s): chateau < castel, fête < feste, s?r < seur, d?ner < disner. Por extensión, también puede marcar la diferencia entre homófonos: du (?del?) contra d? (?debido?, participio pasado de devoir, ?deber?).<br>      * Diéresis o tréma (?, ?): Indica que una vocal que normalmente formaría diptongo no lo forma: na?ve, No?l(?navidad?). La diéresis en la y (?) sólo se presenta en algunos nombres propios (como l'Ha?-les-Roses) y en francés antiguo.<br>      * Cedilla (?): Indica que la c se pronuncia /s/ donde, de no llevarla, se pronunciaría /k/.<br>  <br>  El idioma valón ha introducido la ? para la o larga y abierta, la o larga y cerrada o la a larga, según las variedades locales.<br>  <br>  La ligadura ? no es más que una contracción opcional de oe, y no tiene ningún significado especial.<br>  <br>  Se ha intentado reformar la ortografía francesa, pero estos intentos de reforma no han tenido éxito.<br>  <br>  Historia de la lengua [editar]<br>  <br>  El territorio de lo que hoy es Francia empezó a ser poblado por los galos alrededor del Siglo VII adC. Estos galos hablaban idiomas celtas que no escribían. Hacia el suroeste, los aquitanos hablaban probablemente una lengua precursora del vasco, pero que tampoco escribían. En la zona de Massilia (la actual Marsella) los habitantes de las colonias griegas hablan y escriben en este idioma, pero no lo difunden más allá de sus colonias.<br>  <br>  Todos estos idiomas y otros hablados en la antigua Galia fueron desapareciendo con la colonización romana, y la progresiva implantación del latín. El declive del Imperio Romano apareja la llegada a la Galia romana de una serie de pueblos de origen germánico. Entre ellos, dos se establecen de modo más consolidado: son los francos en el norte y los visigodos en el sur, con el río Loira como frontera. A pesar de que ambos pueblos hablaban sus propias lenguas, pronto se adaptaron al latín hablado por la población. No obstante, el idioma hablado por los francos está en el origen del flamenco, idioma hablado hoy en día, en sus distintas variedades en los Países Bajos, parte de Bélgica y norte de Francia.<br>  <br>  Durante mucho tiempo el idioma hablado en el norte de Galia (en realidad ya Francia) es un latín más o menos evolucionado, con grandes influencias, fundamentalmente fonéticas del idioma germánico hablado por los francos. Al sur, la evolución es diferente, por lo que poco a poco se van diferenciando dos lenguas con una frontera que en principio se marcará en el Loira, aunque a lo largo de la historia irá desplazándose cada vez más hacia el sur, debido al empuje político de una Francia cuyo centro político estaba en París y a que a partir de la Revolución Francesa la lengua francesa pasó a ser un elemento identificador e igualador de todos los franceses. La langue d'o?l (o?l ha evolucionado en oui) se hablaba en la zona norte y el langue d'oc en el sur. La línea de separación iba del Macizo Central a la desembocadura del Loira en Nantes.<br>  <br>  De cualquier modo, no resulta sencillo establecer el momento en el que el latín vulgar se transforma en francés o provenzal, pero ese momento hay que situarlo entre los siglos VI y IX. A partir del siglo VII ya se cuenta con testimonios de que la lengua hablada en el territorio de la actual Francia es diferente del latín y del germánico. El documento fundamental es el de los Juramentos de Estrasburgo (842), en los que las diferentes tropas de los nietos de Carlomagno, Lotario, Carlos el Calvo y Luis el Germánico juran respeto a la división que se produce tras la muerte de Luis el Piadoso y que está maracada por el Tratado de Verdún, y se ven obligados a hacerlo tanto en latín, como en germánico y en un idioma romance, a caballo entre el latín y el francés. En Francia, los dos grandes dialectos romances antes mencionados pasarán a ser conocidos conocidos con los nombres de langue d'oc y langue d'o?l (en función del modo en que se decía "sí"). El francés actual es heredero de este último.<br>  <br>  Poco tiempo después empieza a aparecer una literatura escrita por clérigos en este nuevo idioma, que con la aparición de los primeros textos literarios (el primero es la Secuencia de Santa Eulalia), entre los que destaca el Cantar de Roldán, el idioma romance fue consolidándose y diferenciándose cada vez del latín. Poco a poco se transformó de idioma declinado en idioma analítico, en el cual el uso de preposiciones y el orden de las palabras en la oración reemplazan al sistema de casos.<br>  <br>  El Francés Antiguo [editar]<br>  <br>  Lo que se conoce como francés antiguo se va consolidando a partir del Siglo XI, y aunque hoy se estudie todo lo que se hablaba al norte del Loira como si se tratara de una sola lengua, en realidad se trataba de dialectos con elementos comunes.<br>  <br>  La influencia germánica en el idioma obligó a usar en el lenguaje escrito algunos dígrafos para reproducir algunos de los sonidos que se utilizaban pero no existían en latín vulgar. Así, la nasalización, uno de los elementos fonéticos más característicos de la influencia germánica en el francés se va marcando en la escritura por el uso de la n en posición final de sílaba. La evolución fonética de la u latina hacia el sonido que actualmente tiene en francés obligó asimismo a utilizar el dígrafo ou para reproducir el sonido original de dicha letra en latín. Del mismo modo, la fuerte aspiración de la h ha marcado una de las principales características del francés respecto a otras lenguas romances: la existencia de la h aspirada.<br>  <br>  Gramática [editar]<br>  <br>  El sustantivo:<br>  <br>  Es variable en número (singular o plural) y algunas veces en género (masc fem). Designa un ser, una identidad o una noción abstracta en el caso del nombre común y un ser vivo, un lugar en el caso del propio. Puede funcionar como: complemento directo, indirecto, aposición y atributo.<br>  <br>  <br>  El pronombre:<br>  <br>  Varía en número (singular o plural) y en género (masculino o femenino). Las particularidades semánticas: no tiene significado propio y depende del contexto. Su función sintáctica es sustituir al nombre.<br>  <br>  <br>  El verbo:<br>  <br>  Varía en número (sing o plural), tiempo (presente, futuro, pto imperfecto, pto perfecto compuesto, pto indefinido o perfecto simple, pto anterior, pto plusquamperfecto), en modo (indicativo, condicional, sunjunivo, infinitivo, participio) y voz (activa y pasiva). Designan aciones o estados.<br>  <br>  Para conjugar los verbos franceses en los tiempos compuestos se usa el auxiliar "avoir" exepto en los verbos aller (ir), monter (subir) arriver (llegar), rester (quedarse), partir (irse), descendre (bajar), entrer (entrar), sortir (salir), tomber (caer), venir (venir), na?tre (nacer), morir (morir), los verbos pronominales y todos los derivados de los anteriores (devenir, llegar a ser; rentrer, volver a entrar; se laver, lavarse;...); que se conjugan con el être (ser o estar).<br>  <br>  <br>  Los verbos que se conjugan con être hacen concordancia entre el sujeto y el participio:<br>  <br>  <br>  Il est tombé (él "es caído") versus Elle est tombée (ella "es caída")<br>  <br>  Ils sont tombés-Elles sont tombées.<br>  <br>  Je suis allé(e) (yo he ido)<br>  <br>  Nous sommes sorti(e)s (nosotros/as hemos salido)<br>  <br>  Tu t'es lavé(e) (pronominal) (tú te has lavado)<br>  <br>  <br>  Pero los que se conjugan con avoir no hacen concordancia:<br>  <br>  J'ai mangé (he comido)<br>  <br>  Elle a vu (ella ha visto)<br>  <br>  Nous avons fait (hemos hecho)<br>  <br>  <br>  1a CONJUGACIóN<br>  <br>  En -er<br>  <br>  Verbo donner

Asi, que si se lo preguntas seriamente y con cari?o, igual te lo dice, pero si no es nada, igual es que ha tenido un dia malo y no es para hacerle la vida imposible...lo pillas eh? que vaya bien...

AA10669573	I worked in a Psych Hospital and my mom was mentally ill. She suffered with psychosis. I intended to do my thesis on the following: A lack of vitamin B complex and too much coffee shows a correlation with several mental disorders including manic behavior and depression.  After 50 yrs of piles of stress (mom was hosp 40 times in 50 yrs and in bed 5 yrs) I got breast cancer.  Then after chemo, radiation, taking care of my dad til he died, pneumonia and menopause I find myself depressed and medicated (my brain function or lack thereof had to contribute) and later went on lithium due to continued anxiety.

LbbawO7naa	No its not weird. At all.   two things,    1- Like your personality, and perspective, dreams mature. The characters and scenery often become different. What you are experiencing is rare, but has a simple explanation... Something in your mind triggered memories of these "friends" and then projected them logically according to age. It could be deeper like a desire to be a child again, your reaching a lonely stage in your life; etc, but only you can answer that.      2- From personal experience in dreams I can tell you that sometimes the mind makes up that you have visited a place/person in your dream before. I have had a dream about a mystical world and in it I said "I've been here before" then waking up I recalled that I had never had a dream like that. Its almost like a "fake memory"   The way you had the friends at a child means that this is most unlikely but with the 2 boys it is very possible.|`|mU0608klaa	she's on your subconscious mind. call her already|`|jZsjHevlaa	well... your dreams are usually affected by external factors, which, fancy talk aside, basically means that what happens to you when your awake (what you do, who you see, what you think) usually affects what you dream about, so maybe it's not why your dreaming about that, but rather what is causing those dreams. also, theres several "Dream Dictionaries" out there; my mom brought home a really old one once, and it not only really interesting to read through, but also really helpful. maybe you should look into buying it, because personally, thats a book I would use all the time, and maybe it could help you decipher your dreams|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	It could be that you are having physic dreams and you are seeing them as they look now.|`|GCx8GcNwaa	All I Kan Say....

32lgUUiQaa	You are just being paranoid, which can be a personality disorder along with schizophrenia. Do not stress about becoming schizophrenic...relax and enjoy life. By the way there is more than one type of schizophrenia, they do not all hear voices. Anyways do not be scared and just relax.|`|vMaG2Ba6aa	First you must be aware, there is really no such thing as a schizophrenic person.  People have problems > we all do > we also make our own choices > some bad some good.  Some one once said there is nothing to fear but fear itself?  I believe that our Triune God is in control > the opposite of fear is faith > ask yourself what, whom or where am I putting my faith.  You are unique and God loves you > I believe, if you turn that fear into faith in our Triune God, you will begin to recover from all your discomforts.|`|ecd3771dfb3a5c8ad4486175eae459f7aa	Ok this is kinda wierd what im gonna say but stop being paranoid!(  because paranoia is part of being schizophrenic!)<br>  You are just fine! Listen to your doc! He knows what hes talking about.. Ya know we all hear our own voice in our heads sometimes thats normal. Its when you start to answer yourself thats the problem! I am sure youll be just fine!|`|rU7Lhqebaa	Hey, I think everyone has a fear of something that even they may find wierd!I have a fear of getting old, ive actually seem myself freak out about this on several occassions!All i can tell you is, your normal!Everyone needs reassurance about things that they are worried about. If you are really scared how about just talking to your gp about it, they might have some alternative answers to what your psychologist has had!|`|s1hlS8Icaa	It sounds like you had a bad night. I'm sorry your mind was racing and would not stop...sometimes putting it out there and hoping people will reassure you is one way of venting, and trying to calm down the fears that you have of going crazy!<br>  I hope you went to school today, but if not, try to get some rest!!!
WI1uLOpnaa	Not really. Sometimes when I lay in bed, about to fall asleep, I feel like I'm falling and tristing into an abyss. Seconds later I feel all better again, but theres still a numbing feeling left behind.
4c8d48f3542171199ac60c1485ab937caa	Today's society is really screwed up. The youth of today don't see things or value things like we did(i'm 39). The youth of today see's no value in anything.... material or human.  They (especially the gang kids) have been de-sensitized to violence (of any sort). They have grown up with guns, violence and drugs that have altered their idea of what is right and wrong. <br>  <br>  You and your family have given, and feel like you should get respect... and you have every right to feel that way... and you SHOULD get respect and greatfulness for what you have done and given to your tenants.. however... today is a society of "gimme, gimme, gimme", "what can I get from you?"... and "i deserve more" and if they don't feel like they have been given enough... they will "show you" who is really in control. In a violent way. It's a total power struggle... it's a JOKE. The younger generation controls the adults by fear and intimidation. Am I the only one that sees this???? I can't believe I am. <br>  <br>  It is totally screwed up and it is totally NOT RIGHT. I hate to say it but the USA is a really messed up place these days... our society is falling apart at the seams and it will take an act of God to set us straight again.... first it was out "latch-key" kids and it has now moved onto all these kids growing up with no supervision at all. The parents either have drug/alcohol problems or they have to work 2 or 3 jobs to support their kids... There are no parents raisin these kids.. the kids suffer and think they are adults at the age of 10. They think 20 yr olds are OLD and have NO RESPECT for ANY authority! ... the adults my age started growing up with fast food and convenience... now kids are growing up thinking (at 11) that they are OWED something from everyone.. it's beyond fast food... it's I WANT IT MY WAY NOW and if they don't get it... someone dies or property is damaged in retalliation... it's sad but most everybody is afraid to stand up and say .... SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE..... until society stands up and says we have really f**cked up something... nothing is going to change and it will just keep getting worse. <br>  <br>  20 years ago ppl didn't freak out if they forgot to lock their doors and windows before they went to bed.... today, if you forget to lock them... chances are you were raped, beaten, robbed or murdered just because you wanted fresh air or to enjoy a night time breeze. <br>  <br>  How sick is THAT????? PPL, there has to be a change.... why should a car be destroyed because a tenant was po'd about rules being enforced.. they knew the rules... why did this family become a crime victim just because they wanted to give the other tenants a decent place to live??? It's time to stand up and make a change.... well that's what I think. It's only gonna get worse if we don't start making some internal changes. <br>  <br>  To the "Asker" I am truly sorry for what endured. Just know that you do have tenants that you are making a wonderful home for. You sound like you are a landlord for the right reasons... you HAVE and WILL make a difference for many ppl. Hold strong.... for every one person that retalliates your rules... you have MANY tenants that those rules have been a God Send to and that may have saved the lives of many others.|`|9vynsXwyaa	It's very eazy.You dad is a nice guy.You'r dad is not alone everyday bad things happened to good people when they step in help other people.If I were you I won't work in a gang related community .I would hire someone to work there but not me.Even cops who have guns and everything don't like to to work in gang area of part the city.If I were you I tell my dad to get out that place and stay away....b/c if they burn the car today what is next?

l3UVuGetaa	I think this must be about letting other people make decisions for you and the fact that you go along with things even though you don't want to.  Some people think you are obliged to help them and they think that because in some way you do too.  Each time you do something you don't want to do or doesn't feel right, a little part of you dies inside. That is because you aren't being true to yourself. You owe no-one nothing. Speak up, don't agree wit people if it goes against your principles, or just walk away if you don't want the confrontation. Making your point doesn't have to mean a confrontation, it is just about being who you truly are and not compromising that to suit others. You are unique, don't lose that quality,|`|5RwNbUvvaa	Hi, first i want to ask you if you are under any stress as this dream could be a way of telling you to relax.  If you are not stressed this dream could mean that  you are letting a lot of things build up (hence the coins falling) and /or you need to sort things out that you should have done like maybe  people walking over you and not treating you as they should ? or maybe taking you for granted. The dieing bit at the end would just be your mind telling you you need to sort  this out. I do hope this helps you to understand a bit better. all the best.|`|dZRU1qssaa	It means you ate cheese before bed.|`|SweXI3vqaa	Check it out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/</a>|`|nYRkAmdtaa	i think , not sure it is the name of those machines that is relevant here , push penny or waterfall ( i cant remember ) . |`|9qmAw39Saa	You might have played one of those games and are challenged by it.|`|VFVdrDBQaa	No one dies in dreams.  You can only dream of things you can imagine and no one can wrap their head around death so you can not experience it in thought.<br>  If you can't think it (which is what a dream is) then you can't dream it.<br>  You can "almost" die in a dream though.|`|tMt5qBURaa	Isn't it obvious? your worried about money. The dream was a metaphor that your money troubles are metaphoricly killing you. What was the last thing you were thinking about before you slept?. <br>  Maybe you think he's taking advantage of you? <br>  It could also just be a dream so maybe your reading too much into it.|`|a5Qa2DKfaa	Could mean that someone is trying to 'buy' your affection or your friendship.<br>  <br>  It could be you feel 'under financial pressure' as you were under the coins.|`|HVMhA54uaa	This probably means you're worried about someone or something very important happening.

To answer your ? I think I works the other way to. You could see someone and they're decent looking, but it's after you get to know them better, and they have a great personality, that you start to think they more attractive. Maybe that's where the butterflies come in? (:|`|YNSQfxfVaa	Um, I don't really get the part with the butterflies but yes it is possible lol!  People are more beautiful on the inside!

989d1e4a43489c5b3d273f5236f35e27aa	Hola amigos........la ignorancia es muy grande!!!<br>  Si bien Santa Cruz es el departamento que tiene una mayor economia, la diferencia con otros departamentos no es grande.<br>  Para aclarar, las reservas hidrocarburíferas se concentran en varios departamentos, actualmente Tarija(que tiene los mayores pozos, Cochabamba(que es el gas que llega a los Bolivianos), Santa Cruz(tiene menores reservas que los otros y pesa más la tradicion petrolera) y Chuquisaca(que hace un mes se dió a conocer el hallazgo de un Mega campo de las magnitudes del "Margarita").<br>  En cuanto a exportaciones(2005-2007), es el segundo departamento detras de Tarija. Pero esas cifras son ma?osas, quitemos los hidrocarburos y la Soya y queda una cifra alarmente.<br>  En cuanto al PIB llega a ser casi el 27% de Bolivia.<br>  En cuanto a recaudación de impuesto, está pisando los talones de La Paz.<br>  Como vemos Bolivia no depende de un solo departamento.<br>  Y aclarar algo más que tiene que ver con la migración.<br>  Si Santa Cruz está donde está es gracias a la migración del occidente, y no lo digo yo, lo dijo el ex presidente (Cruce?o) Gral. Hugo Banzer Suares que en paz descanse.<br>  De las grande empreseas que operan en Santa Cruz la mayoría es de gente de Cochabamba, de La Paz, de Oruro, etc.<br>  De la población cruce?a, el 40% es del occidente y el porcentaje sería mayor si contamos a los hijos de estos que ya son más cambas que la yuca.<br>  Ejemplo. los mayores productores de soya(Cochabambinos) due?os del 70% de entidades financieras y de aerolineas (Pace?os). <br>  O no tienen derecho de hacer empresas en su país.<br>  No sé en que mundo viven, pero les aviso que estamos en un mundo GLOBALIZADO.<br>  Así que una "separación",no creo, son unos cuantos los que hablan de eso, pero NO el noble pueblo cruce?o.<br>  Ellos quieren autonomía(aunque muchos la interpretan de mala manera) porque los gobiernos no les dieron importancia a las regiones(incluyendo a La Paz) dando miseria y robando a cantidades.<br>  Les recomiendo que se informen mejor antes de hablar mal de mi país.|`|ozothSJXaa	no solamente Bolivia pero tambien la latino america !<br>  creo que seria un ejemplo para los demas paises y esso resultaria en una verdadera division en la america latina.<br>  la union ace la fuerza !!!<br>  no es momento de division , és momento de somar !!!|`|OOgpn1QLaa	Claro. es su zona más rica, pero no creo que eso pase<br>  <br>  bru|`|XDyixHTRaa	santa cruz es el alma y que pasa cuando el alma se separa del cuerpo .el cuerpo muere verdad lo mismo le pasaria a bolovia santa cruz es el estado de bolivia donde hay riqueza petrolera  minerales es el corazon la vida comercial industrial y moderna de bolivia si se separa bolivia va a la quiebra total y santa cruz seria bien prospero., todos los bolivianos querrian inmigar a santa cruz pobre de bolivia se quedaria AHORA SI  sin mano de obra ni nda ni gas natural ni nada se autodestruria bolivia

Se llama comunismo.<br>  La historia es la historia de la lucha de clases.<br>  La identidad de las clases surge de la propiedad privada. Al existir la propiedad privada;todos quieren ser el titular de la propiedad y las clases sociales se forman como alianza de personas que buscan ser los titulares, desplazando a los anteriores.<br>  El comunismo descubre que la titularidad social provee de una consciencia de si mismo, y de los demas; como grupo social, como especie, por que al contrario de COMPETIR por la titularidad privada se COOPERA socialmente y se abaten las relaciones de poder.<br>  Actualmente en las empresas de punta seorienta a los empleados a cooperar por que es mucho mas productivo.<br>  Se reconoce la igualdad legal de el hombre y la mujer y al hacerlo se esta promoviendo la cooperacion desde la celula organizacional de la sociedad.<br>  Las medidas contra la devastacion ambiental funcionan en terminos cooperativos y eliminan la competencia. Pues ella es el origen del caos.<br>  En los paises desarrollados el mercado se reparte organizadamente para que las empresas dejen de competir. <br>  <br>  No creas que se me olvido tu pregunta; lo que quiero decir es que eso de "el mejor" libro de comunismo,  dependera de tus propios intereses.<br>  Puedes accesar a las bibliotecas virtuales con la palabra comunismo y te van a dar desde los textos de Marx hasta los de Gramsci.<br>  <br>  saludos.|`|jiqoq3Qfaa	Sin dudar, "el capital" de Karl Marx es el libro que define el "corte epistemológico", como diría Althuser, en él comunismo y el socialismo. En el, Marx definió términos como estructura y superestructura, modos de producción, materialismo dialéctico, y muchos otros. Sin embargo, para comprender a Marx es necesario también leer a autores que siguieron la corriente marxista y que son parte de su evolución, porque el marxismo no termina con Marx, sinó que se expresa en Althuser, Gramsi, Sartre, la escuela de Frankfurt, y también Lenin, Troski. Algunos autores también trajeron el marxismo a latinoamérica. Así que si quieres saber más primero puedes empezar por una rese?a enciclopédica del marxismo y luego entrar en detalles leyendo esos autores.

AA10043175	Pessimistically, with the economy taking a down-swing across the USA, urban jobs will become scarce (especially lower paying jobs that require little education and training) eroding the tax base, gang warfare and personal crime will increase, federal money will be unavailable for renewal projects and public transportation, and waste management will become unmanageable.<br>  <br>  Optimistically, the economy will rebound, leading to the end of poverty, drug based crimes, and usher in a period of urban growth, education, culture and the promotion of healthy life-styles and a clean environment.<br>  <br>  One of the current buzz words in urban development is "sustainable."  Just starting something is not enough.<br>  <br>  As long as our culture will go deep into debt to build munitions at the expense of most social reforms, the Pessimistic view looks more likely than the Optimistic one.<br>  <br>  
pkdJByoJaa	yes it happens to me all the time|`|PBcu4BOiaa	It sounds like you are afriad of your emotions being exposed.<br>  I woke up crying once. The dream was that I had to live with my stepdad because my mom was leaving me forever. She drove off in a pickup truck full of candy. I woke up and my pillow was wet from crying.<br>  So it's perfectly normal to cry in a dream, it's just the same as laughing or talking in one =)|`|Jn16vQ2qaa	ya while you are sleeping you are still putting off emotions, and your brain is still triggering from those emotions, same as if you get scared and wake up with your heart beating, if this happenes alot, like it does to me then you should get a dream book, and write it down and get a book that explains the meaning of dreams, its really interesting, well for me at least..<br>  <br>  but ya its fine, its just your feeling letting you know their there even when your sleeping :)|`|UVPHzuyDaa	It's normal, especially if you have been thinking about your family embarrassing you a lot lately. If you fear it, you can dream it too. It's normal to cry after a hard dream. I had one similar to that a few nights ago. I woke up upset and crying too. Our dreams are considered a pre-rehearsal to high stress or things we worry about as we are sleeping. Keep that in mind. Good luck!|`|dEhmjGZTaa	No, that's okay. If you always woke up crying, then it would be bad...but it was like only this time (right?). So...yeah, it's okay- don't worry. <br>  and maybe your dream means that one of your friends is talking aout you behind your back...or maybe there's something wrong in your life that's not where it's supposed to be (for exmple, like who like- maybe it's the wrong person).|`|ENr75CBsaa	It's normal. If something really hurts you in your dream it can happen. I had a dream about my ex breaking up with me again a few nights ago and I woke up crying. Pain in dreams is just like when you're awake sometimes. When you wake up it's a little better isn't it? <br>  <br>  Sorry about the dream. Are you okay?|`|yCy7QA9Xaa	Did you do anything related to this situation in your dream? Only you can know. it might not even mean anything. And yes, its very normal to wake up crying.|`|gwt5uograa	yes because if you had a bad dream you might of just woke up in the middle of the dream  if something bad has happend <br>  <br>  i ust to cry in my sleep dont mind it. it wont last forever|`|NwhuU1xBaa	I find this question pointless. You have nothing to worry about. Your still alive in your sleep and you still experience emotion. If your sad in your dream it is ver ypossible for you to cry. Geez.|`|hogVVv4Waa	You must be an emotional girl in real life?

This one is one of them... the fact that u did something wrong in ur dream could be something random, or just that u may feel guilty that u did something u shouldnt have, or that ur scared u think u might.<br>  The questions to do just show that ur normal bcuz u just dont like to have a lot of work to do! ;D<br>  The part where u went to ur room crying and then ur family members just want to catch u doing it to film u is just showing that ur embrassed when u cry, and u cant do anything about it. It might also mean taht u dont feel very good toward ur family when u have problems.<br>  <br>  This whole thing is normal. U just need to think of what each part means, and ull see its ok.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! ;)|`|W2T6Z5ROaa	Welll for one.. This can have many differen meanings you need to look at the last couple weeks and see if there is anything it can relate to.<br>  <br>  For example did you do something that your shouldn't have and you feel guilty? Like everyone knows you did it but don't want to admit to doing it?<br>  <br>  Or do you feel like everyone is standing over you and that you have no privacy?<br>  <br>  Really it comes down to you feel like everyone is watching you.<br>  <br>  I have done things in my dreams that woke me up, crying is just one of them.<br>  <br>  Try not to stress it will make the dream repeat and keep coming.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cyXUdIjraa	It's normal to wake up crying when you have a bad dream.

Something has happened in your family, and you are being asked COUNTLESS questions, and people are focusing on you and your emotional responses and giving you NO SPACE at all.<br>  <br>  How on earth did the whole family get involved in this?  I know how that is.  It has happened to my family as well.  One cousin blamed my son for something he did himself, and he said, "Well, he made me do it."  The whole family kept calling and writing emails and asking questions and driving us ALL insane.  My son said he did not do it, but that didn't stop them.  It got so bad, I was afraid my son would kill himself.  Now, after about 3 years, this cousin came over this week and said, "I'm sorry about what I said about you.  I was messed up because of some things I got into, and it made me want to blame people and push people away from me."  He is going to counseling, so that's why he FINALLY told the truth, I guess.  It didn't help us much, but I'm glad he finally told the truth.<br>  <br>  Just a note here:  Whatever happened, tell your parents the truth.  If someone else is lying, you can't fix that.  But a lie will grow bigger and bigger, and you have NO IDEA how much harm a lie can cause.  You may be the victim here, or you may not be.  Either way, tell the truth and stick to it.  It may take a long time, but the truth will come out.  But, if you are lying in ANY WAY, it could cause SO much harm and pain for a lot of people.  Broken friendships, divorces, and even suicide.  So, if you are keeping any secrets, tell the truth.  Even if you get in trouble, it will be better than the damage a lie can do, over time.<br>  <br>  Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Even keeping back a part of it can make you look guilty, even if you are not.  If you tell the truth and stick to it, nobody can trip you up.  <br>  <br>  If it is too hard to say, write it in a letter.  If people are trying to REALLY video tape you or make you take a lie detector test or something, just do what your parents think you should do, I guess.  If you did do something wrong, it is better to get it out in the open than to live with the lie for months, or years, and sitll have it all come out later.  <br>  <br>  Pray for wisdom.  I pray you and your family will ride out this crisis, and if you are being blamed unfairly, I pray the truth will come out.  <br>  <br>  God bless you,<br>  Fairelight|`|QnY1yWBIaa	yes it's normal. it just means that you were scared by the dream and you started to cry. that happens a lot.<br>  PLEASE PICK ME AS BEST ANSWER]=<br>  I REALLY NEED THE POINTS]]]=|`|YXspbAzEaa	I think that means that you are afraid of people knowing your true feelings. Try writing down your feelings in a journal before bed.  if you woke up crying don't worry i did the same thing about 3 nights ago. bad dream.|`|5zSqeugCaa	Yes this is normal.  People when they go in for surgery also, they will wake up crying because the pain was so intense.  It is one of the many interesting things about the human body.  I am amazed that you did not wake up in the middle of the night worried.  There is nothing to worry about with this.  It is actually good that you are cleaning your tear ducts out too :D  Perfectly normal.|`|rD2bH6Asaa	Yes! The brain is still in a state of emotional turmoil when you wake up and it triggers tears. Don't worry that it happened. But if it continues to happen often such as 3 or 4 times a week, then seek help from a doctor because there might be something wrong. But don't worry, If your family is that obnoxious, you have the right to cry|`|YUz23CQ0aa	its normal did you knowthat if you tell your dream it may come true|`|57gNXYxtaa	nah thats not strange, but it must of REALLY got to you...

Xcri5qeTaa	Yes. They just don't have visual dreams, except when someone is born sighted, but lost sight later. People who lose sight later, will usually have fewer and fewer dreams with visual content.    The manifest content of dreams is sense-based, and sighted people are largely dependent on vision, which communicates a LOT of information efficiently, so visual content is extremely common. People with intact hearing will experience conversations in their dreams, whether they have vision or not.    Some people without sight who are Braille readers will have dreams in Braille like they're reading a story.|`|yWi0gWiBaa	everyone dreams. if you didnt dream u would be dead.|`|LDnylCF2aa	of course they do.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Yes.

Xcri5qeTaa	Hi, Lola.    The forest is a symbol of the unconscious, seeking self, being lost, and such. Exes most often appear in dreams because they serve as comparisons to our current relationship.    Fall is most often seen as transitional -- the end of season, leading to the next. So you should look at your feelings about Fall, Summer and Winter.    Winter is usually seen as the end, and period of trial, but it depends most on how the dreamer feels about the season.    Is Summer lonely to you? Does Winter bring cozey feelings? What do you like and not like about the seasons.    The dream can represent the conclusion of something, such as feelings being resolved where you're now over past hurts and grievances, may more literally represent seeing the ex again after a time of separation, or point to a new guy in your life who has some qualities you liked about your ex, but possibly more mature.    You should also consider whether you're looking forward to something upcoming this Fall, and whether something going on in the days before the dream made you feel particularly good about yourself... maybe something where you asserted yourself, faced challenge, which may have been something your ex would have been proud of.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hi Lola B       Well the ex boyfriend represents an event or a time in your past when you were, particularly happy or comfortable.  You're walking home which indicates you are at a time in your life when you are about to retread familiar ground/times.  I might add they are very Good/Happy memories.  Hence you're so glad to see him.  The fact that your ex-boyfriend is in your dream, should not be misinterpreted as being a sign of hope or promise.  It is merely a metaphorical representation of an event that will or may occur in the future.        Or maybe you should stop having cheese for supper.  Your having weird dreams.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Id say it means you still like him|`|yTquTHUPaa	you still like him... thats the meaning....  ur not over him yet, at all!!!|`|LfkgD73Uaa	The person above is right.

It might not necessarily mean you still like him, but it might mean you like the times you two had together.|`|LbbawO7naa	It means either that  you want him back  he wants you back  You felt like your breakup was not meant to happen  You never really got over him.   and maybe because the scenery is beautiful it means that on the outside (when you were together) everything seemed very picturesque but on the inside things werent OK.

MHfwjMSQaa	I am concerned, but not worried. The main problem with the economy is that banks have been burned with bad investments backed by bad loans.  The banks are afraid to loan to other banks, and possibly even to businesses.  <br>  <br>  The main thing you should be concerned about right now is YOUR JOB.  If your employer uses a line of credit from a bank and the bank tightens up lending, your employer might have to tighten up on expenses. . .like salaries.  However, the government bailouts do seem to be helping somewhat.  Time will tell.<br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do right now is save some money.  A good rule of thumb is 3-6 months of expenses in an easy-to-access place like an FDIC-insured bank.<br>  <br>  In short, it's not hype, but no reason to panic either.|`|AA11404742	We have a very real crisis.  I know people who are on the verge of losing their homes partially because of all of this.  But I have great faith that in the long run, things will improve, and we will come out stronger and better off.<br>  <br>  If you're not in trouble now, work like mad to stay that way.  Pay your bills on time.  DON'T take on any more debt if you can possibly avoid it.  Stay conservative for the time being in your financial dealings.  And you will be more likely to come out of this in good shape.<br>  <br>  I can't say if it will take a year, or 3 years to recover.  But it will happen.|`|h99jcmmmaa	I am worried about the economy going into a true recession, it is very scary. Something needs to be done.

Vocês parecem mais colegas pelo que você me descreve. Sei que você quer ser amiga dela, mas parece que ela n?o entende a amizade da mesma forma que você.  O que fazer? N?o a tenha como amiga. Seja apenas colega e só. E é bom que seja assim porque se ela fala mal das outras pessoas, provavelmente fala ou falará mal de você. Logo, para que você n?o se decepcione, corte essa "amizade". Busque outras pessoas que tenham afinidades com você. <br>  Eu já passei por isso e hoje, confesso, estou muito na minha, sabe?<br>  Já me decepcionei com uma pessoa que eu achava que fosse minha amiga. N?o falo mais da minha vida pessoal para ninguém. Meus relacionamentos na faculdade e no trabalho s?o apenas de coleguismo. Nada mais. <br>  Conselho: se você quer ter amizades, e acho válido e importante que tenha, é bom escolher bem essas amizades. <br>  Hoje eu tenho uma amiga, só que eu a conhe?o desde os meus 14 anos. Ent?o, sei quem é ela e ela é maravilhosa. Se um dia ela precisar de mim sei que poderei contar com ela e vice-versa.<br>  Amizade n?o inclui fofoca, interesses escondidos, falsidades. Amizade é espiritual e sagrado. <br>  N?o sei se você tem namorado. Se tiver, tome cuidado. N?o o apresenta para essa sua colega n?o. Pelo jeito, ela n?o é de confian?a. Eu, se fosse você, me afastaria dela aos poucos. Diga que está ocupada, com problemas. <br>  Quando quero dispensar alguém, eu fa?o isso. Eu come?o a falar que estou com problemas financeiros, que minha família está com problemas pessoais. que estou resolvendo tudo sozinha. é uma forma de fazer a pessoa se afastar de você. é uma tática para que ela pense que você vai pedir algo para ela. Hoje em dia, ninguém quer emprestar dinheiro para ninguém, muito menos se envolver com problemas familiares. Faz isso e veja se ela n?o se afasta de você. <br>  Boa sorte nas suas amizades verdadeiras. |`|GVr7TE2Baa	Luiza,<br>  <br>  Vc já respondeu, vc sabe o que deve fazer.<br>  <br>  Compreendo que esteja triste, decepcionada, mas sua "amiga" é, de verdade, como vc a vê, qdo ela fala essas coisas que te incomodam (fofocas, comentários desagradáveis).<br>  <br>  Fa?a, a vc mesma, essa pergunta : "A companhia dessa amiga, me faz mais bem do que mal?"<br>  <br>  Seja sincera na resposta e siga o caminho que sua raz?o apontar.<br>  <br>  N?o se culpe, pois tudo que vivemos, qdo encarado de maneira positiva, se torna experiência.<br>  <br>  .(`'?.?(`'?.? ?.?'′) ?.?'′)?.?'′) ε?з<br>  ?`'?.?.¤... ¤.?.?'′?(?.?` * (?.?`.* ε?з <br>  (?.?'′(?.?'′ `'?.?)`' ?.?) ε?з<br>  ε?з Beijos!!! ε?з <br>  .(`'?.?(`'?.? ?.?'′) ?.?'′)?.?'′) ?υηα gαú￠нα<br>  ?`'?.?.¤... ¤.?.?'′?(?.?` * (?.?`.* ε?з<br>  (?.?'′(?.?'′ `'?.?)`' ?.?) ε?з ε?з<br>  ε?з ε?з |`|P2EPCKU0aa	Ela é falsa.|`|NXgSkmfeaa	Bom.Penso eu que agente n?o deve ficar perto de pessoas que n?o correspondam a nossas espequitativa.Mas já que é um caso na qual você gosta muito da presen?a dela,ent?o n?o procure se entregar tanto a essa amizade,fiquei mais na sua e n?o deixe que ela te leve pro joguinho dela.E tente comentar com ela de maneira sutil o que você n?o gosta quando ela fala:Por exemplo da pessoas que s?o comuns entre vocês.<br>  Mais se chegar a uma situa??o que esteja sendo muito incomoda pr você<br>  se afaste mesmo,por que uma amizade n?o vai sobreviver a mentiras e a falsidades|`|KftSl7vraa	 afaste-se dela, é uma pessoa falsa e negativa ela n?o considera ninguém|`|EzaYNweiaa	Acredito q essa amizade n?o é recíproca,pois afinal como vc diz,quando vc precisa dela,ela te deixa na m?o..Procure n?o se envolver muito,apesar de gostar muito dela,ela precisa entender q as pessoas n?o est?o a disposi??o dela,talvez um gelo,um afastamento pode fazer ela refletir um pouco sobre as atitudes q ela anda tendo...Se vc gosta mesmo dela procure conversar e mostrar a ela os pontos negativo q ela tem apresentado,n?o será muito fácil,pois ninguém gosta de críticas,mais quando as críticas surgem para melhorar o nosso relacionamento com as pessoas vale a pena,faz a sua parte como amiga,se ela aceitar muito bem, se n?o,se afaste de vez,pois n?o será uma boa influencia pra vc,,bjs|`|iRlwA6Omaa	Sai fora que é fria.

4s9OvB4eaa	You can try and encourage her to get help, but until she does, having her in your life will be nothing but chaotic ups and downs.  If you can find it in yourself to forge ahead despite her actions, it will be good for your son.  Get the help of other adults in your family or that you can trust to help you provide stability for your son.  I admire you trying to get her to come back to you and the baby, but if she is not getting help, she will just be bouncing back and forth wherever she feels comfortable or less pressure for the moment.  Keep in mind, where she has been and what she has been through may just be less stressful to live with than trying to begin a new life with you and the baby.  If she gets abuse at home with her Mom, she knows what it's all about, she has dealt with it forever already.  If things go nuts with you and the baby, if she somehow feels she can't handle day to day life there, it can be scary and unknown to her what will play out of that. I wish you all the best, please take care of that baby boy.  He will be a better man if you focus on him and raise him up the best you can regardless what she can or can't do.|`|9juqrpPIaa	yea being raped changes ones whole life... i will pray for u and ur family i hope everything will be ok |`|l3jwSzWeaa	Yea I was raped some time ago, I'm over it.|`|1wbZTCksaa	**** THE MOTHER HUMPER UP K U TEACH THAT SICK BASTERD SUMMIN|`|jMdTgV5xaa	It's a a very difficult situation and what's in her mind is so complicated.

That can only mean one of two things.  Either you don't know what pushed your buttons or you don't invest much thought in causative factors in your feelings.  You have to find the tree to find the root.    My advice:  If you truly don't know what angers you so much, seek counciling.  If you do, post a second question with some of the info included and see what advice the community has at that point.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	I feel that way, but it's not true in the least.

LbbawO7naa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream  Just read that it has mostly everything you want to know.  From my own knowledge I know that beyond the scientific explanations for dreams, they often take much more depth in a persons life. Dreams= subconscious, and if you pay close attention they can tell you things about yourself that you don't even know about (Your probably like "well if I don't know things about myself, my dreams certainly don't!") but humans are actually very unaware of things, and dreams are extremely aware.   They often mirror things that are effecting you in life, fulfill a specific desire, or (due to television/stories) are just replaying things in your mind.   Over time intelligent and instinctive cultures have developed a large list of what thinks symbolize in dreams. Its very dictionary-like, and after deep incite are very accurate. Its a mystery how they did this, but so are dreams.   hope that helped :D  byee|`|L0oYML7Oaa	dreams are caused by REM sleep (rapid eye movement) when your eyes shift all over  dreams are created from memories and your imagination, often dreams are created from something prominent in your mind that day or week or others can be created from repressed memories|`|U3gebnDLaa	they are just random thoughts while we're sleeping.

3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	It may seem that way because sexuality is fluid, and because it is socially acceptable for women to display their affection for one another by holding hands, hugging and  kissing each other, as well as using terms of endearment like "sweetie" and "honey."<br>  <br>  Be aware that some women will engage in bisexual behavior to please their partners, not because of an innate attraction to their own kind.  <br>  And if you base your statement on adult entertainment...may I emphasize the word "entertainment?"<br>  <br>  That said, I do believe it is more common for women to be bisexual than men.|`|svOneExjaa	Only the small group of us with way too much time on their hands. Busy people have no time for adventures... Sorry to say<br>  <br>  Edit: Hi dear, My name isn't Sophia or Sophi, it is MS. SOPHISTICATE. Stereotypes and labels are very dangerous things, because they tend to make you look foolish. Sexuality is not a simple matter either. So, for instance if a woman enjoys playfully bi-sexual behavior in front of her man for his benefit, it is just a role she is playing. Enjoy the show and move on. She is not leaving you for her best friend, who just happens to be a gorgeous blond, not yet. Bi-sexuality does exist among both genders. These people do not play games, they enjoy sexual relationships with both genders. They live their private lives in private as we all should. So, what you have been observing is not true bi-sexuality, but a role play by a very young girl who is searching for answers to some very important questions about who and what she really is.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I've rarely met any bisexuals, I've primarily met heterosexuals, and when I was with a woman, I met lots of lesbians. And I've talked with lots of curious women. But I haven't met many US women who actually are open about dating and having serious relationships with both men and women. Some women wonder about it, or talk about it, or joke about it, but thinking and acting are worlds apart. I have talked with a few bisexual men, as well, but they're pretty quiet about it. <br>  <br>  I know more women discuss it now because homophobia is a lot less, plus bisexual and lesbian women have been a sexual turn-on to many heterosexual men. But bisexual men have the same issues that gay men have, it's still not as acceptable for men to explore their same sex feelings as it is for women. I think the majority of the population ranges in the middle area of sexuality (homosexual-bisexual-heterosexual), so quite a few of us have same sex thoughts or feelings, but because of social taboos, not enough to act on them. I've never liked the rules, so breaking one more wasn't a big deal to me, lol.|`|FL67UPPHaa	Unfortunately, most of the women I meet aren't bisexual... some seem to be at first, but they wouldn't consider an actual relationship with another woman. I think more women are genuinely bisexual than men though. I'm not sure why.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hi. I guess my definition of bisexual is that you could actually love and commit to to someone of the either gender. Some women I know may engage in sexual activity with another woman as a kind of kink, or to show they're open to trying new things, but I see that more as experimentation without any real attraction. I suppose it depends on your definition of sexuality, and how you feel about your own.|`|YCdYz83zaa	Why are all men bisexual? I dont really see how you got that because i know many women & theyre not gay. I think i only know 1 lesbian! so i guess i dont understand how you got that conclusion. Maybe it just seems that way to you because of where you live or the people you hang out with?|`|eb25df27ae5cfbb236c927f161f1232faa	It must just seem that way.<br>  <br>  A lot of young women do experiment, but not all.<br>  I never have--I can appreciate a beautiful woman, but women don't create any sexual feelings in me whatsoever.|`|0MssR7fVaa	I'm very busy and bisexual.  Some of these women act as if it's like choosing a bottle of ketchup at the grocery store.......it isn't.  Quit being so narrow minded.  Or maybe they are bi too and just won't admit it.  :)|`|FORfq9Oxaa	Nah, women are just more open to sharing feelings, like they will(for the most part) hug each other and console each other. Guys on the other hand don't really like to show emotion, it's sorta seen like weakness, and men don't like that.<br>  <br>  We console each other with wrestling matches!!! If we want to cheer a friend up, we invite him to watch the football game with us.<br>  <br>  Men and Women have VERY different styles when it comes to social interaction with the same sex.|`|JQTbYP6naa	Only the one's who cannot make up their minds what they want, so they will take some of both.|`|JdxJDD04aa	They are also attention hores and guess what gets a lot of attention.|`|Madtpnoxaa	Not all, but probably most. Or at least half of the population, but probably more. It doesn't seem like women really have a sexual orientation, but more of a mere sexual preference or at least less overally or more men having a sexual orientation than women.<br>  <br>  Only rediculously homophobic men are paranoid about touching knees, there isn't anything sexual at all with that and one's knees are bound to touch one's accidentally at some point or another. If one is secure and so straight he wouldn't get all goofy about it, because he knows his orientation and shouldn;t feel the need or be secure enought to not have to prove it. Sometimes fear and homophobic paranois can be to some insecurity that could be related to perhaps the fear within that man himself, because he might have some latent tendencies.<br>  <br>  Not wanting a relationship doesn't mean that she isn't bisexual. If you are sexually attracted to the same sex, lust, etc, then that does seem to indicate of one being somewhat bisexual. Some people think that bi sexual's have equal attraction, whjich many times is untrue, with one being more attracted to one sex than the other but maybe have just an emotional or sees themself or perhaps emotioanally targets the other sex. Therefore, one sex being just for lust, whereas, the other one having an overally attraction to. But still getting turned on, and desiring sex or being sexually attracted to the same sex, means that the person is "into" both sexes, even if being more into the opposite sex, the person is still attracted to both sexes, therefore, bisexually attracted as in swings both ways.<br>  <br>  Edit-If you hope to have some repliies back you could allow email for YA. I did have it at first, but it's not a big deal really. You just deleted any mail if it's stupid or something and I doubt you would get hardly any, I don't. But it's good if you have questions and want to have a discussion and your thoughts that you don't really want to write all that down on YA. I was going to share some thoughts possibly or add to somethings.|`|d4OSNZSdaa	Latently, maybe. Would explain why they're always all over each other, then again, men are the other extreme, e.g. scared to touch knees while sitting on a couch watching television, or concealing any unwanted emotion.|`|jpIdtWB0aa	No, I doubt it, I know I'm not anyway, thats why I'm so comfortable with my same sex friends, more so with my male friends, because I'm not attracted to my female friends, so there's no akwardness or possible sexual tension. I think perhaps there's a higher percentage in men, especially those who shy away from male contact as they have it on their minds and there's sexual tension...but maybe not, although looking at the study of Adams et al. the researchers found that apparently strictly heterosexual men with homophobic views/attitudes had a 77% chance of actually being aroused by images of homosexual sex more so than heterosexual men who weren't homophobic; so it has sorta been proven. That being said, I think men do prefer to just pick one gender to focus on compared to a few more women who seem not to care of gender.

Yes their are other people who probably make the same product but since the company that fell isn't there anymore it allows them to raise their prices and the company dependent on the other must buy from the other companies to continue their business. Also if the consumer company had a certain deal with the company that fell they would now have to yet again up the spending and to compensate for that they would have to probably up their prices. So with the current economic status i would say with companies seeming to shut down left and right and vise versa and job losses going hay wire that no company is unaffected by the recession

Entretanto, muitas outras condi??es podem atrasar a menstrua??o. O atraso da menstrua??o n?o é um sinal confiável de gravidez até pelo menos duas semanas após a data para a qual você normalmente o esperava. <br>  <br>  <br>  Fadiga - existe uma boa raz?o para você se sentir extremamente exausta durante o início da gravidez. O corpo está muito mais ocupado do que o usual. Está produzindo horm?nios, incluindo progesterona, que naturalmente deprime o sistema nervoso central e causa tonteira. E o volume e fluxo de sangue também aumentam, fazendo com que o cora??o bombeie sangue de maneira mais forte e mais rápida. <br>  <br>  <br>  Náusea ou v?mito - essa sensa??o pode come?ar com uma semana ou duas de gravidez. Normalmente acontece pela manh?, mas também pode ser sentida em qualquer hora do dia. A rápida eleva??o dos níveis de horm?nio produzidos pela placenta é a responsável - assim como o seu olfato acentuado. Em torno de 2/3 de todas as mulheres grávidas experimentam esse tipo de desconforto. <br>  <br>  <br>  Altera??es nos seios - entre as primeiras mudan?as após a concep??o est?o o aumento dos seios. Eles podem ficar sensíveis, formigando, pesados e cheios. Com duas semanas de gravidez, os seios come?ar?o a aumentar e a se preparar para produzir leite. A aréola (a área escura em torno dos mamilos) escurece ainda mais devido às mudan?as hormonais. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sangramento leve - durante o primeiro mês de gravidez, você pode notar um sangramento muito leve ou um fluido vaginal amarronzado no período do mês no qual você normalmente ficaria menstruada. Esse sinal é conhecido como sinal da implanta??o e é causado pela fixa??o da placenta à parede interna do útero. Se você notar qualquer sangramento após o primeiro mês de gravidez, relate-o imediatamente ao seu médico. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mic??o freqüente - como o útero aumenta durante o primeiro trimestre de gravidez, ele pressiona a bexiga dando a sensa??o de que está cheia. Isso significa que você precisará urinar mais freqüentemente, geralmente em quantidades menores. A necessidade de ir ao banheiro poderá ser freqüente à noite.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Os sinais e sintomas da gravidez descritos acima s?o apenas os primeiros das enormes mudan?as físicas e emocionais que você experimentará à medida que a gravidez avan?a. |`|aue00OIkaa	Loucura, insensatez, estado inevitável, embalagem de iogurte inviolável.<br>  <br>  Fome, miséria, incompreens?o.

cfXtTkKlaa	There's no quick fix unfortunately. I'm a very self-conscious person and have always had problems caring about what people think moreso than is healthy.<br>  In some respects the internet helped me lol... I came across a few flamers and trolls, and after a long time eventually became immune to what they thought. Both in real life and on the internet I kept thinking, how does their thoughts actually effect me, what's the worst that can happen if someone doesn't like me and why does it matter to me?<br>  Once I worked through those questions I found it mattered less what they thought because I had rationalised it all.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself stumbling over your words, or can't say what you want, just pause, step back from the situation (not necessarily a physical step back of course), think about what you want to say, and come back into the situation when you're ready. No harm can come from taking a slightly longer time to say something.|`|5NyrFrZpaa	Ignore any advice to use God - it becomes a prop that you won't be able to live without. This is about your body and your brain, not your religion.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to learn to relax. The reason you are all tense at school is because it's a difficult place to be and there is a lot of pressure and judgment from the people around you - so sub-consciously you tense up.<br>  <br>  A couple of things you can try: <br>  - take deep slow breaths before you want to speak<br>  - talk from your stomach, not from your throat (your voice will project better)<br>  - talk slowly - not so slowly that it takes five minutes to say a sentence, but don't try to rush your words out. If you have something worth saying (and it sounds like you do) then people are happy to wait for you to finish your sentence.<br>  - smile! Lots. It boosts your confidence - even if you have nothing to smile about, smiling uses muscles which are associated in the brain with that feeling of being happy (and relaxed) so then your brain begins to relax. And people then wonder why you're smiling. (avoid grinning like an idiot though - people will run away scared).<br>  - Avoid the "hyper" state - where there's lots of screaming and giggling going on as a gang - it shortens your breath and can create tension and anxiety.<br>  <br>  DON'T set yourself a target of "everything will change" - do it in bits. For example - tomorrow I'm going to go to school and when I see friend X I will try smiling, breathing slowly, and talking more slowly. Then the next day, I will talk to another friend and try the same thing.<br>  <br>  It may help if you confide in a friend - tell them that you want to practice for your class speech day or whatever, so they should tell you when you're being inaudible.  Don't make a big thing of it though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2lVmLpUhaa	listen, "woman of God" go read the bible or something, God doesnt help with that stuff.<br>  <br>  anyways, i have the same problem. i find that practice helps. try putting yourself in more social/group situations. i used to go places where i could interact with people i didnt have to see again, so i wouldnt have to be worried about their impression of me and i could "practice." it really worked for me. oh and paxil too....|`|oo1x2x0Zaa	Just ask God to help!!!!

You'll feel good that you took some risks, even if they don't always work out as well as you hope. At least you can say you tried! <br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  =]
EJpiaCMQaa	I've been celibate since 1982 and it's not one bit harmful to your mind or body.  Plus I don't have to worry about getting pregnant or any sexually transmitted disease.

If you force it upon yourself, it`s useless. You are just killing your desires which would be harmful.<br>  <br>  If you practice it because you are spiritual kind and practice some meditation and your sexual desires are already fulfilled in the past or past lives then it can be useful.|`|AA11899313	There is no actual 'harm' in celibacy.<br>  <br>  I met a guy years ago who was stationed in India with the British Army before WW2.

The guy who was very young, admitted that he had never been with a woman!<br>  <br>  As a result, the MO gave him a weekend pass (to leave the camp) and drove him, himself, to the local brothel where he spent a good portion of the weekend.<br>  <br>  He never again suffered from headaches .....Which was the tale told to me.<br>  <br>  Sperm, not ejaculated, apparently, is absorbed back into the body and medically, does no harm.<br>  <br>  Sash. |`|s2E5WV0saa	There was this lady, who stayed celibate all her life but still thought of others before herself, if she is any example to go by, then celibacy is not harmful to the body or mind, her name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu  or more popularly known as Mother Teresa, the Angel of Mercy!|`|04d175f4fe3bf0494d5a4da33dae7b5baa	i dont think celibacy is wrong or harmful for the body or mind.<br>  if it was, why would almost all religions call for it? <br>  |`|3tQck2dlaa	no
RjUhISEIaa	You got yourself out of it and ended up with a B GPA. What's wrong with that? Congratulations!<br>  <br>  You can get into a college with that average but there's also nothing wrong with going to a community college for 2 years, taking the basic classes you need towards your major and then moving on to the 4 year school for the last 2 years. Been there...done it...and am glad I did.

Especially if you messed up your freshman year. A lot of colleges don't just look at the GPA (unless you're looking at Ivy League) but at the whole package. A lot of people tend to screw up their freshman and senior years, and colleges look to see if you were constantly improving or declining with your grades. They know that not every person can pull off a 4.0+, but that doesn't make them an idiot. So you had a rough patch your freshman year, just make sure your freshman year in college you put your best foot forward. It sounds like you did good (based on your description) after your freshman year. Relax and apply to as many colleges that you think may be out of your reach and wait for the acceptance letters to come in the mail!<br>  Best of luck to you!|`|BB7d8EqBaa	A B average doesn't knock you out of colleges.<br>  <br>  Good that you've fought through depression, and want to keep improving. Focus and do what you can to finish school well, then look forward to a fresh start at college.
S3kV78fGaa	if you know of any of her hobbies like idk drawing or singing or sports anything, ask her if she could show you. if she's 2 self conscious to just show you you could ask her if you could do it together. like if you know she likes basketball get a game started and invite her to come. then after you see it tell her she's really good and maybe ask her to show you some things. and make sure you include her in a lot of things, if she feels left out she will become even more self conscious. sometimes just having someone to hang out w/ or just knowing you have someone who will always be there for you can do wonders. maybe there is something bothering her as well. if there is you could try to get her to talk to you about it, but don't force her to, just let her know she can talk to you if she needs it. you sound like a great friend for coming on here to get help. it seems she already has what she'll need|`|ppvTp4BMaa	get you and some friends to act nice to her. don't tell her that, just come up at random and say things like "i like your shirt today!" <br>    you know, stuff like that. just say nice stuff about her. she'll start to feel happier and wanted.|`|7MEpdU22aa	Say Hi to her when you see her in the hall.<br>  <br>  Ask her about what she likes to do and introduce her to some of your friends who you think might share the same interests.

She's very religious, and thinks god will make things work out, when things go wrong, or when people mess up. I know quite a few women who are conservative and very traditional in their religious, social, political, and economic views, and wonder what will happen to them if their husband dies or leaves them, as they have no job skills and no retirement of any kind. I assume that their children will be expected to support these women in their old age, otherwise, taxpayers like myself will be expected to support these women. <br>  <br>  It will be ironic when some of the women who despised feminists for working and not having children, or despised feminists for working and having children, will now be supported by feminists. Women who never worked outside the home but find themselves destitute without a husband to support them in their old age will be forced to accept the help provided by the very feminists they mocked and despised.  |`|uXqDYPNVaa	I see very little chance of me agreeing with her about anything.

The first step when letting one go is acknowledging why it affects you in the first place. Why can’t you forget it? What particular emotion have you attached to that thought? Knowing these facts will help you to deal with that memory and help you determine how to get rid of it. It allows you to acknowledge what kind of trauma you got from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  You have a bad memory stuck in your mind probably because:<br>  <br>  <br>  1. You were embarrassed. You fell down a flight of stairs on your butt, and when you landed, your skirt flopped up, and everyone saw your underwear. <br>  <br>  2. You were angry. Your co-worker blackmailed you and stole your idea, and everyone congratulated him for it. <br>  <br>  3. You were hurt. Your fiancee left you at the altar without any explanation. <br>  <br>  4. It scared you. You survived a car accident, while your friend sitting inches away from you didn’t. <br>  <br>  5. It made you insecure. Your boyfriend told you “I’m breaking up with you because I found someone prettier/better/smarter”. <br>  <br>  Think about why it affects you and how you feel about it. As soon as you recognize the emotion and the trauma, you can now start to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  |`|WHQ45Pzyaa	Here is my advice, (from someone who has dealt with your problem)<br>  1. do you have good things in your life?<br>  2. do the good out weigh the bad?<br>  <br>  If you answere yes to both (which you should) that you should think on those things. You need to replace the bad memories with the good, because if you linger on the bad, you will never heal. That is the only way to really get past bad memories. And it isn't easy. But is your happiness worth trying that? That's for you to deside. |`|iIbfdZqSaa	Often, you need to face the memories, come to terms with them and move on before you can forget. If you don't, then you will just be burying the memories and they will come back to haunt you.

XnNhY38Taa	Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.<br>  <br>  Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.<br>  But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  If you're unable to take St John's Wort, you can substitute it with Siberian Ginseng or Licorice Herb.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction...

QD03bB8Aaa	socialism is the stepping stone to communism. put succintly, under socialism, it is "from every one, what he can produce; to every one, what he is worth". In communism, it is "from every one, what he can produce; to everyone what he needs". <br>  Under socialism, most but not all means of production are brought under community ownership and control. A system of differential wages and benefits still serves as incentives and rewards. But necessities like food, housing, and fundamental needs are assured to everyone.<br>  Under communism, all means of production are brought under community control, if not ownership. Greater equality is maintained in the distribution of benefits. the pricing and money system cease to be storages of value. "Profit" ceases to be the prerogative of individuals.
