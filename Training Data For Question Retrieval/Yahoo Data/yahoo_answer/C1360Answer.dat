gZXQ7jxCaa	First I'm not a feminist and I agree with the  last comment that some of the list mentioned aren't rights at least not under the equal rights amendment.      Paying for dates.  I'm sorry but unless a woman asks the guy out the gentleman should pay for the date at least in the begining. Most women are more than willing to pay after first few dates or until the reaionship is established.  Plus the woman can return the courtesy by inviting him home for home cooked dinner.  This has nothing to do with equal rights just courtesy and old fashioned chivalry.    Mind games  manipulating men.  Both genders are capable of manipulating each other.  What about all the players and cheaters and bad boys.  what does this have to do with equal rights?    I don't think the world has out for women but I can't deny a lot of sexism racism that out in the world more commonly against women and minorties it's been that way for centuries. Of course there are disadvantages for men as well.  Some men seem to think the world is out to get them too.    I don't care for too much political correctness myself but I'm aware some sexist jokes are  too offensive plus I could say the same about men who always complain about male bashing when they same about women themselves.  Both genders can be hypocritcal in this area.    men having no emotions.  Interesting because men complain that woman expect them to be emotional like them and try to prove how tough they are.  I heard men say emotions are for sissies.  Women do tend to be more emotional than men but I also believe men tend to be more logical or more tough.  We are different any many ways as should be.    Affirmative Action was meant to ensure minorities and women and handicapped people in jobs that they are qualitied for but not at the expense at more qualitied white males.  I agree that sometimes it  has been missued and hate it when that happens.  I think men should get any job that want but I have heard men be the ones to claim nursing is women's work I think a feminist would support I man so why is feminism being blamed for men mocked for going into this fields.  Also maybe men are even less interested in women dominated fields than women are in male dominated fields.      Not all feminist are man haters like Valerie Solerno besides I think both genders should cease hate speech about the other.    Men staying home   Its the conservative patriarch society that condemns men who want these not feminists.  In fact some over zealous feminists will say homemaker role is demeaning to women which I don't agree.  If a man is more suited in that role and the woman wants to work fine.  But I believe women are more commonly suited for the homemaker role.  Plus there are still many biases towards mothers who work.    Stop hitting men argument.   I agree nobody has the right to anybody without being prepared they might get hit back or arrested but I strongly don't condone a male to hit a female regardless men are commonly naturally stronger and do more damage plus he could use his superior strength to restrain a woman where a woman would more likely have to grab a weapon against a man twice her size.  Plus the fact I still value chivalry.    I'm aware that men get abused too and have the same legal right to report their abusers to the police and get out of that kind of relationship. Domestic violence on either side is wrong.      Sexism card.   That all depends if the woman has reasons to believe she was discrimanated against then she has the right to complain.  I'm not going to ignore that fact job discrimination still doesn't go on against women or minorites but I am aware that a woman shouldn't always assume sexism plays a role whenever she doesn't get the job she wants.  Plus the same can be said about men.  If he didn't get the job as a nurse for example should he assume it was because he was man.  Both genders can pay the sexism card or equal card when it's suits them.      I usually avoid this type of topics but I couldn't resist this one.  Note to Smart Alex I thought you didn't believe in equality just fairness.  I  do agree with equal rights under the law equal worth but I don't believe in complete gender equality because it's not so black and white.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Start paying for dates.   That's his choice. If he doesn't want to pay, then he can always ask someone else for a date.     - Fight to have rape and domestic abuse laws require actual proof beyond a woman's word, no matter how much crying and sobbing she does.    I doubt there's ways to give 'actual proof', not sure exactly what kinda proof you'd consider good enough. I think if these cases weren't based on what lawyers bicker about, we'd all be better off though and the truth would be easier to see.    - Have women stop their ******** mind games used to manipulate men. Manipulative people aren't controlled by gender.    - Stop whining and crying about "sexist" jokes and remarks when women say similar things all the time about men.  Agree, unless it's done at work maliciously.     - Drop your pre-conceived notions that the world has it out for women. Accept responsibility for yourselves.  Agree, everyone should be responsible for themselves, even women *gasp* haha =o)    - Drop your pre-conceived notions that men are sex-maddened pigs who only want one thing.  Not all that many women have this opinion, but the ones who do should get real, for sure.    - Stop thinking that men have no emotions.  Same as above.    - Stop hitting men if you don't want to be hit back.  Lesson learned while I was in my teens. Hope other women who are dense learn the same lesson. It's totally ridiculous.     - Protest when a woman is given a lesser punishment than a man for the same crime. Happens A LOT.  Can't stand that.     - Stop assuming that a man who is nice to kids is a pervert.  Kids are a tough one, it's not fair but that's gotta be a huge fear for parents. Stranger danger and all. I don't think it's a great fear or sensible, but can understand it. Though they should have a healthy fear of women who are abusers as well.     - Stop affirmative action. This is favoritism and discrimination plain and simple. Where is affirmative action in the female-dominated industries, hmm? No need for equality there I suppose.  This one's iffy.    - Stop publishing hate-speech about men (alot of feminist literature) while censoring men who say the same.  Not informed enough about this one. Seen a lot of crap from both sides. A lot of what people are up in arms about that I have seen, I can't understand. Seems harmless to me, or done clearly as a joke, not a real belief.     - Let a man stay home and be the housekeeper/childrearer or whatever term you want to apply to that role, and let the woman be the breadwinner. Also, stop chastising men who want to do so.  I don't even want children, neither does my partner. So I'm good. This is a persona choice everyone needs to make for themselves, as long as they take care of their kids I don't care who's home with them most often.    - Finally, stop playing the sexism card when you don't get that job you applied for.  Never did, not gonna start now =o)|`|vEj7xoBraa	I don't understand your question.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	I think the seeds of the masculine movement are being planted already.  So, taking the feminist movement as an example... maybe in 50 years we'll actually have genuine equality.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Start paying for dates."    I agree.  No one is obligated to pay for you just because you have a uterus.    "Have women stop their bullshit mind games used to manipulate men."    Right, because all men are SO straightforward.    "Stop whining and crying about "sexist" jokes and remarks when women say similar things all the time about men."    Feminists don't do this.  Actually, we tend to have a better sense of humor about things like that than non-feminist women do.    "Drop your pre-conceived notions that the world has it out for women. Accept responsibility for yourselves."    This is just stupid.  It's not a pre-conceived notion, but it figures that someone like you would say that.    "Drop your pre-conceived notions that men are sex-maddened pigs who only want one thing."    I agree that we should stop generalizing, but I'm not going to pretend that some men don't help to keep this image alive.    "Stop thinking that men have no emotions."    Don't men brag about how 'tough' they are and how 'whiny' women are?  C'mon.    - Stop affirmative action. This is favoritism and discrimination plain and simple. Where is affirmative action in the female-dominated industries, hmm? No need for equality there I suppose.    Thank you for answering your own question.  How many men get picked on by other women for becoming nurses?  How many men get bashed for joining ANY female-dominated field?  Look how many female cops and firefighters get harassed by male coworkers because they are female?  Your logic is off.    "Stop publishing hate-speech about men (alot of feminist literature) while censoring men who say the same."    A: Not all women are feminists.  Try not to use the two words interchangeably.    B: How do we censor them?  Aren't their books published anyway?  Can we agree that there is a lot of hateful speech on both ends of the spectrum?    "Let a man stay home and be the housekeeper/childrearer or whatever term you want to apply to that role, and let the woman be the breadwinner. Also, stop chastising men who want to do so."    I'm assuming that you're referring to non-feminist women on this one, considering that feminists have fought so that an arrangement like this can be possible and accepted.  It's anti-feminists who want to keep women barefoot and knocked up, not feminists.    "Finally, stop playing the sexism card when you don't get that job you applied for."    I agree, to a certain extent.  If I'm offered less money than my less-than-qualified competition, solely because I'm a woman, then you're damned right I'm raising hell.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Women DO pay for dates; the person who asks should be the one who pays. This isn't a matter of law or social policy. If you don't want to pay for dates, don't ask women out.    Letting rapists go free is wrong. Men don't have the right to rape; neither do women. You're not advocating equality. You're advocating crime being unpunished.    People playing mind-game on other people isn't a matter of sex. It's also not something anyone else can control. Thus, you can't stop men who play mind games on women from continuing to do so, any more than I can control what other women do.    PEOPLE shouldn't tell rude jokes about others. Period.    Most women take responsibility for themselves, and take more responsibility for their children than the fathers do.    I don't HAVE any notions that men re sex-maddened pigs; I can't control what others think, except to speak out when men are stereotyped (which I do).    I've never though that men have no emotions.    I don't hit.    I rarely protest; I'm not going to protest every instance of injustice, as there isn't enough time, even if one does nothing else. I would support fair punishment.    I don't assume that men who are nice to kids is a pervert. Yes, it's wrong that, for instance, SAHDs, and others are treated as pervs, without any real evidence.    Name ONE field that pays better, that men are discriminated against. Female-dominated jobs are the lowest-paying jobs. As long as men discriminate against women, we need ways to make the playing-field level.    I don't publish hate-speech about men; never have. I don't censor anyone, as I'm not a publisher, or a government. I do speak out against men who hate all women. I will NEVER stop speaking out against hate and injustice.    I've never in any way prevented any man from staying home to be a SAHD. I have never chastised men who want to do so.     I've never played the sexism card.    Now, stop lying about people you've never even met. Stop playing the sexism card.    Support full human rights for all humans -- like me.|`|H1VIZsutaa	You are such a fag, go burn in hell you gay bastard.|`|a0KF9LLFaa	Feminists hope this happens never. Feminists claim that it's not their place to work towards men gaining rights or solving issues- yet as soon as an organized social group of men started putting initiatives together feminists would cry foul all day long.|`|phJfL2wTaa	You are dreaming the big dream.    Do not think any of things you listed will occur in your lifetime. (I think we are speeding in the other direction)    Where do you think all this is going?    Here is article about what can happen when women as a group decide men are the problem.    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnew...    "The Papua New Guinea jungle has given up one of its darkest secrets - the systematic slaughter of every male baby born in two villages to prevent future tribal clashes.    By virtually wiping out the 'male stock', tribal women hope they can avoid deadly bow-and-arrow wars between the villages in the future.    'Babies grow into men and men turn into warriors,' said Rona Luke, a village wife who is attending a special 'peace and reconciliation' meeting in the mountain village of Goroka."    "A resident of Agibu village, Mrs Luke said she did not know how many male babies were killed by being smothered, but it had happened to all males over a 10 year period - and she suggested it was still happening."|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Unfortunately most of these are not rights so they cannot be enforced - a lot are just examples of hypocrisy. But I already comply with most of your points.  - I do pay for dates.   - Most the time rape cases do require evidence, and often ones that have evidence are still not convicted. And before people say I got this from feminist propaganda, this was from a statement issued by the police. I was not aware that there are many cases where men are falsely convicted of rape. However I still believe people should be far harsher on people who have been proved to be lying in court.   - I don't play any manipulative mind games, nor does anyone I know. But there is nothing stopping neither men nor women from playing mind games so it is not an example of inequality. It is mean, but you can't force people to stop.  - I dont whine about sexist jokes. A joke is a joke. But I dont tell sexist jokes either.  - I am responsible for myself and I do know that the world does not have it out for women. Nor do I know anyone else who does that.  - I dont think men are sex maddened pigs nor do I know anyone who thinks that.  - I am fully aware that men have emotions, so is everyone else.   - I dont hit men. If a man hit me I would not be outraged because I am a woman. Hitting a man is just as bad hitting a woman.   - I do protest against women being given lighter sentences because they are women. I support equality, and favouring women is not part of that.   - I have never seen anyone assume a man who is nice to kids is a pervert.   - I am against affirmative action. (This seems to be one of the few points on your list which is actually to do with equal rights, rather than being seen equal socially)  - The number of women who publish hate speech against men is extremely small. And the majority of women oppose such hate speech.  - I do let men be house keepers. I admire anyone who can do the majority of household chores, I know it is a job I would not want to have to do by myself. I have utter respect for anyone who can raise a child; their gender does not affect this respect.  -  I have never played the sexism card, nor has any woman I know.|`|WKtakdsOaa	I personally would never be a housewife and wouldnt want my husband to do it full time cuase we both work as a team and I think its way better this way. Everyone else can do what they like but I would never expect my husband to be the sole breadwinner.    Everyone knows men are emotional. Its just some women like to pretend to men that they dont know it cause men like that type of thing. My husband still watches films whilst hugging his mum on the settee and he is 25 this year! My brother rings my mum crying when he is upset for her to make it better and hes 20. She sorts out everything for him. I have had countless boyfriends, male friends and they are all like that secretly and I think they all like their mum to make things better no matter what their age. If you know any men one on one then you will know they are exceptionally emotional.  :)

The person doesn't ask for personal information except a name to call you (you can even make that up, or just say you don't want to give a name), and will ask how you're feeling, determine how serious you are about suicide, and what happened.    Their main goal is to help you get a grip when things get so wacky you don't know which way to turn or what to do. They won't try to make you talk about anything you don't want to, they're not going to say you're crazy or hopeless, they're just going to listen to what you're going through and help YOU with what you want help with.

If you are at the point where things are so bad you want to end your life, you should also be at the point in your life where you have nothing to fear. Call them, give it a try. After all how can it make things worse ? haven't you already hit worst. The other thing is that taking your own life is a privilege not an escape. Certainly don't do it for the wrong reason.
UvYzQv5Saa	Well i have the suspicion that you don't understand rape at all. rape is not about sex. It's about violence and the control that a person gets from the violence.     Should you ever be raped, should we just go on with our merry way as if nothing happened?  Should we ignore the fact that you were assaulted. Should we forget about the fact that you just went through a horrifying, embarrassing, humiliating and extremely frightening experience? Should we just expect you to get over it and move on with your life and say Sh*t happens?    You obviously don't know what it is to be a victim. You can't know what it's like to be at the mercy of someone else who literally hold your life in his hands. You can't imagine what it's like to have a part of your soul ripped away from you in one of the most violent acts there is that can be committed by one person onto another.     No those factors did NOT condition women to respond to rape in any other way.    k|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	First of all theres no guarantee that the rapist wont kill the victim, and society is responsible for blaming the victims of rape and making them out to be used goods. Then theres that chance of pregnancy which became a life ruiner, not to mention being messed up inside depending on how rough the rapist was.    Rape IS a BIG DEAL!!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Oh, you are so going to get slammed.  In answer, I think the response of the victim and society is a rational one.  It's not only women who can be raped you know.  It is a violation of the body, the mind and the spirit.  The body is obvious, the mind is violated by taking the confidence and sense of safety of a person and destroying it.  The spirit is damaged by making the victim feel like less of a person, like they are unworthy of a life filled with love and happiness.  I don't know about you, but I think I would be afraid for the rest of my life after something like a rape.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	I think some guy forcing me to have sex against my will is pretty repulsive, regardless what society has to say about it.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Let me spell it out for you:    The legal doctrine that this country and most others follow is one of autonomy. Most people's internal sense of morality also is founded upon this principle. Short of torture or murder, rape is obviously the most grievous violation of one's autonomy.    Thus, the only way to justify rape is to deny that some people have autonomy, or that rape victims should be entitled to autonomy. Both arguments, of course, are extremely repugnant.    So what you are doing here is denying sexual autonomy. Which, obviously, flies in the face of just about every single rational moral theory on the planet. People are actually socially conditioned to find rape *less* socially repugnant. Several studies have shown that when people watch an enormous amount of pornography and violence and think of it as entertainment that their sympathy for the victims of rape and other violent crimes decreases dramatically.    Also, bigotry is the biggest form of social indoctrination out there. Since we're denying someone's right to autonomy when we excuse rape, we are inserting an excuse--bigotry--to argue why their autonomy does not exist or can be violated.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Conditioned? No! Rape is the worst kind of violation of a person's body and privacy. It is usually violent and always humiliating, and it is *never* wanted attention. Nobody needs to be conditioned to be traumatized at having their body invaded by a stranger; that is a natural healthy reaction. Even if there were no stigma at all for rape victims - and there should NOT be, ever - men and women who are raped would still suffer from it because it's awful.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Do a little research, try out being raped a few dozen times, and report back to us if you feel scared for life, or if you find it a piece of cake.

There isn't a natural way to feel after being raped, however, we have been socially conditioned to view the act a certain way and expect women to remain psychologically scarred after the fact. We're encouraging women to be in a perpetual state of victimhood, even those who aren't raped.     The term "rape" has been relaxed to the point that even a woman who gives consent can still claim that it occurred simply because she wants to. How is that fair, just or even logical? In an era where we are supposed to be progressive and about equality, women have been given ridiculous amounts of special privileges and at the same time, less accountibility.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	"About 20 of them, armed to the teeth and wearing masks, climbed into the yard and the house.

We heard shots and the screams of 15-year-old Aminat, the sister of Ahmed and Aslanbek. "Let her be!" screamed one of the brothers, "Kill us instead!". Then we heard more shots. Through the window we saw a half-dressed OMON commander lying on top of Aminat. She was covered in blood from the bullet wounds.

If anything the reactions are socially encouraged rather than conditioned or ingrained. It's funny how women today have little time doing the nastiest of things (almost unimaginable in natural relationships) and with strangers for money or attention, yet the idea of "rape" is still this big bad wolf. Sure some rape may be more violent or distressing than the next. But for women to claim that the simple idea in itself is so life altering does seem a little outlandish.     Women give up sex to get what they want almost every time they have sex; so the idea of giving it up without getting anything in return is something that irks them, however I'd honestly doubt it is anywhere near as traumatic as professed.|`|NhMfGXmxaa	I think that a woman who was raped and lived in a culture completely free of those notions would still respond in the same way, and be just as psychologically traumatized.|`|9RgjqTeuaa	There is nothing you can come up with that is going to justify rape.

WMrNa3Doaa	It really depends on the woman.    I was raped by my 15 year old boyfriend when I was 13.  I haven't really had any issues that I haven't been able to deal with.  I realized that was just one jerk, and that all men are not like that.    And I have a male friend, and his wife was violently raped and they ended up (sadly) getting a divorce because she was so traumatized that she couldn't even stand to be touched, even in just an affectionate way.    I think the problem with rape, is it's a violation of your body, mind and soul. Someone is trying to own you, and you become less than a person to them. Just an object to be used and then thrown in the trash.  I'm not so sure it's exactly the penetration part.  If a man violently beat me and told me I was worthless, I would probably feel as violated as if I had been raped.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Yes it does. So do jokes about it.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	By the very nature of the offense, it is violent, life threatening, repulsive and painful.  The entire situation is a negative experience.

It is a horrible thing all around and trying to dissect what makes it horrible doesn't make it any better.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Ew. You and your rape apologist brethren really out to be ashamed of yourselves.    Forced penetration IS de facto physical repulsive, humiliating, violent, etc. It is the violation of one's sexual autonomy. No person on the planet, *period*, would ever argue that they are not entitled to some sort of autonomy without significant social indoctrination or psychological abuse. This is a human constant, a fact of human *life*. The violation of autonomy implicit in the act of rape is morally repulsive to anyone who has their head on straight. The only way to justify rape is by denying that some people have agency and autonomy, which can be accomplished with racism, sexism, other bigotries and sociopathy.    That anyone finds arguments such as these at all convincing makes me assume that there are an awful lot of people too damaged or bigoted to function in just society.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Yes it does, and even if it isn't forcible, it is a physical and emotional violation.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Yes.    Yes, even if it's not violent, life-threatening, or painful.    It's by nature humiliating. There's no way to rape someone without humiliating them by that act.

xeYNNoxfaa	I think fear of change is universal. The best thing to do is to take baby steps... make small changes... from there you will find the world is your oyster. Big changes lead to big successes. The more you let change enter into your life, the richer your life will be.  In my life, whenever I've made  changes, good things have always followed. Remember, anytime you let fear paralyze you, you end up the loser.

AA12198711	Could.    Depression usually comes first though.    Cabin fever, while not an actual disease as the name suggests, is a state of restlessness, depression and irritability brought on by an extended stay in a confined space or a remote, isolated area. The lack of environmental stimulation can have real, tangible side effects that have a detrimental impact on anyone suffering from cabin fever. There is little documented evidence, but many speculate that those who may already be mentally unbalanced can be dramatically affected by cabin fever.    Historians speculate that the term cabin fever was first used to describe early U.S. settlers who experienced long winters in their log cabins, snowed in until the spring thaw. The term is dated to the 19th century by the American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms and is first recorded in 1918, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. Suffering from cabin fever is similar to going stir crazy, a term that originates from a mid-19th century slang term, stir, which meant "prison". Stir crazy was typically used to describe the behavior exhibited by inmates in prison suffering from the effects of a long incarceration.    The origins of the term may also date from the time of frequent oceanic crossings, when people endured the long passage across the Atlantic in small, cramped quarters below the deck of a ship. In addition, during outbreaks of disease, people were often confined or quarantined to their homes in the effort to prevent its spread. Cabin fever would have surely been a result in either of these situations.    Cabin fever is such a universal affliction that movies and books have dramatized its sometimes horrifying effect on people and their mental state. Stephen Kings The Shining is a perfect example of how isolation can drive a person mad. The family in the film is holed up in a remote hotel resort, snowed in until spring. Add isolation, lack of entertainment and a supernatural presence, and madness ensues. Other story plots have explored how extended space missions can cause cabin fever, and the theme has also been dealt with in a recent storyline on The Simpsons television show.    In areas of the world where snow piles up all winter long, driving people indoors, cabin fever is a real issue. In addition to long periods of time confined to a small space, the effects of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) exacerbate cabin fever. Many people suffer from SAD during the winter months, when sunny days are few and far between, and they sink into a very real depression.    Those especially susceptible to cabin fever are children who are confined to the house during rain or cold weather. Also, stay-at-home moms have long bemoaned the cabin fever they suffer from when confined to the house without adult interaction. Passive entertainment from television and video games may pass the time, but dont provide the active, interactive entertainment that people crave.    Reading, board games and card games may help, but getting outdoors and engaging in physical activity may be the only real cure. Many people who live in the northern U.S. cross-country ski, snowshoe or snowmobile as outdoor activities. Calling a friend, or simply trying to get a change of scenery, may help as well.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	I've seen the same thing happen in some marriages.

I mean, we understand it on a chemical level. I read a study a few years ago dealing with this, but the results were inconclusive as to WHY the chemical and electrical reactions happen. I myself, and this isn't science, believe that the sounds trigger parts of a "higher self" that opens our "minds" to "higher realms". Kind of like hallucinogens.

Sometimes when our bodies relax too fast, your brain may interpret that as falling or losing your balance. Your brain tells your body to "catch yourself" and you suddenly jolt into awareness.  Your body reacts the same way as it would in a real fall, because your brain interpreted it as a real experience.  Thus, your heart races, you may have a hard time catching your breath and you have other body reactions you would have if you had just had a serious near-fall.|`|91M9ebuWaa	a normal part of life.<br>  <br>  I think its about slipping into a dream but you're aware that you are about to dream. so as a reaction the body reacts in a violent way since it isnt used to being aware of when it is dreaming...<br>  <br>  then it changes when you have a dream where you slip. its just a reaction that you carry in the real world from the dream world. the fear of falling wakes anyone up... notice how you always awake when you fall. or slip off something in your dream|`|uAzToWC7aa	it occursa when u r deep in  imagination. when i do it, i always get soo scared. it feels like sumone pushed me off a cliff. i hate it!!|`|KfKr3hUmaa	its a symptom of stress and restless leg syndrome<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlAL6.UP._v1_28TjognT7fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222194557AAZK3gw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7bf21413e2e3f54d05c3c67fc6e65a6eaa	I don't know what it would be if your awake but there is actually a sleep condition that has the same exact symptoms|`|oaw7ssT7aa	hun thats normal i get it sometimes too|`|q9v13GoIaa	everyone does that|`|DXzUCgj8aa	i hate that feeling|`|bKDBbGmuaa	sometimes when you are realy tired your body trys to put itself to sleep when you do this it is like being drunk almost and dozing off  its not a bad thing your body just puts itself to sleep it almost like it is sending you an email saying we are finna go to sleep  when you go to sleep like that very fast you loose your balance and feel like you are going to fall|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	When you're lying down and your muscles are relaxing as you're going to bed, your body feels like it's falling, and so it tries to right itself by tensing some of your muscles.

Best wishes.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	there's a debate here. this is true because the meaning of life is subjective.<br>  <br>  i could write paragraphs on what some groups of people think the meaning of life could be. but instead i'll tell you what i means to me.<br>  <br>  life is about leaving the world better than you found it. this isn't so simple. there are many obstacles to happiness and wellbeing. and some things that make one person happy will make another person miserable.<br>  <br>  i get off on the idealism. what can i do to make others better off and stronger for their journey? i'm the shoulder you can cry on, i'm the one who gets your bike back after it's been stolen. people often say they'll die for love. and so it's true that i would. i'd die for love, justice, and freedom. not my freedom, lol. because i'd be dead. some people forget to live because they're so busy thinking about when they'll die. and i say, forget about it. you'll die when it's your time. and not before.<br>  <br>  i'm the martyr that dies for his beliefs. i believe people have the right to be happy. to live their lives unafraid and never abused. you only live once, and you should go for it.<br>  <br>  life is too short to judge people for their shortcomings. and it's much easier to hold the real punks of our world accountable when you let go of the petty things. and everything that doesn't make you happy or feel secure is petty. life is about being comfortable for who you're born to be. if you're gay, be the flamiest gay person you can be. no judgement from me. just keep that in the bedroom. i'd be a lousy voyeur. lol.<br>  <br>  be who you're born to be. this is the meaning of life. don't pretend to be something you're not, and don't judge others for being who they are, either. and BTW, pedophiles and murderers do not fit into this category. they'll be held accountable, but not by you. relax, and live your life.<br>  <br>  the meaning of life is happiness. it's about finding meaning. something worth living for. the life's too short to pretend.don't rain on the parade just because you weren't invited.|`|9AMphipiaa	your not insane. you have an anxiety disorder.. your not alone either..<br>  <br>  have you read descartes? talks about stuff like this kinda..<br>  <br>  if you dont get enough info here at yahoo.. <br>  check..<br>  search in google..<br>  volconvo debate forums <br>  look at that site.. in the philosophy and religion forum..<br>  you can even ask questions..

W2pvqhbkaa	I try to distance my self from anyone that does any of the aforementioned.<br>  I must tolerate some abuse but in these cases I tell the person what they are doing wrong.  I take some steps at the time like going to my room to stay away from the person.  Then when I have the next calm opportunity I reiterate the damaging behavior.  The water for instance.  I would make sure I bought the water I wanted if its a person you can not avoid then I would show them and tell them.  You are not my boss and I will buy this water.  Make sure the offenders know they are not welcome in your apartment or your life.  If they come to the door tell them they were not invited and you do not have to let them in. <br>  <br>  You may want to move farther away from the people that offend you the most.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I'd save up a lot of money and move away without telling them.

cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	It shouldn't be and in many other cultures it's not viewed that way (most of Europe, and other places as well). Women breast feed in public and it's simply a non-event. No one looks, no gawks, no one thinks about it at all. And certainly no one tells her she should go feed her baby in the public bathroom, balancing on a dirty toilet while somebody's dropping one in the next stall.<br>  <br>  But in American culture, breasts are fetishized to the point of being viewed as sex organs, on the same par as genitals. They are not, of course, but there is so much "titillation" regarding breasts, that they cannot be removed, mentally, from their sex object status. It's a little creepy to think that breasts have become so sexualized, the same body part that is used to feed babies is viewed, first and foremost, as a sex organ. Ugh. We are one of the few cultures on this planet that have this hang-up. sure, breasts are seen as sexy, but very few cultures view breastfeeding as something so dirty that many feel like it needs to be carried out in a disgusting public toilet, rather than where the mother and child can be comfortable, and "breath easy.<br>  <br>  Again and again we see breastfeeding being compared to urinating, defecating, and reduced to a "bodily function." It is NOT the same. Nor is it the same as an exposed vulva or penis. Our culture has made it the same. EATING is a bodily function, and as Bluebeard said, no one expects that you should cover your head when you eat....why should a baby be hidden under a blanket while he/she eats? Women expose FAR more of their breasts just by wearing a low cut top than would generally be exposed by breastfeeding...WHAT is the difference? WHAT is the difference between YOU eating, and a baby eating? Why must a baby be "hidden away" when he eats? Just try to actually think about the reasons for your views, other than your inexplicable squeamishness.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Just another sign of how screwed up our society is and how people are always looking for another way to be Puritanical.  The background causes are so extensive - bu trace mainly to religion being about control, control, control.  Making everything about the body dirty, and sexually wrong.  Of course breast feeding isn't about sex, but the stigmatization of the breast is so far advanced...<br>  <br>  Have you seen where photo stores have a problem with pictures of it?  And if a teen-age mom ( ~15,16 ) breastfeeds - then it's practically child porn.  Of course you know about the whole Face book fiasco.<br>  <br>  At least where I live, in NY state, there are clear laws and court rulings in favor of public breast feeding.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think a large majority of the public is OK with it, to some degree or another.  More of a problem with "guardians of the public" worrying that "someone" will be offended.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	It's not, and it pisses me off mightily when someone suggests otherwise.  Breast feeding is natural.  Its what the breast was made for!  It's the way the baby eats!  To suggest a baby has to eat in a dirty stall in the bathroom when the mother is out in public, or that a mother must stay in the house while breast feeding is both wrong and a serious sign of how our society views women.  Does society want to sexualize women so much that breast feeding must be considered a vulgar thing simply because the breast is showing?<br>  <br>  Frankly, when I become pregnant, I will breast feed.  And I will breast feed in public if need be.  If an individual doesn't like it, they can look away.  Its natural and I will not banish my child to a smelly bathroom to eat.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I don't find it any of the above.  I see people breastfeeding at our local malls all the time.<br>  <br>  I think that since some guys think of breasts as "fun bags" for their enjoyment, they have issues seeing them doing what they were really meant for.<br>  <br>  My wife never felt like showing hers, so had one of the coverings made for being discreet.  If she would have felt differently, I would have supported her.|`|uhchod38aa	The breast has been sexualized. What I find amazing is that women can wear thong bikinis on the beach with no trouble...but just try to breast feed on the beach and watch what happens.|`|JfoWgwhoaa	It shouldn't be. Its a completely natural thing to do. I see plenty of women breastfeeding in public.|`|AA10152422	Just wear a blanket--it's not that difficult. My mom always had one in the diaper bag.|`|AA10895669	Sadly because breasts are considered sex toys in this country.<br>  <br>  It's unfortunate that people can't separate sex from the miracles we have been given in life. Love making is a beautiful act between two consenting adults that should be considered a natural expression that is private and accepted as part of life. Pornography often muddies the waters between what is natural sexual behavior and what is not. Because we still have a very puritanical based ideology that compartmentalizes sex and public, and there is an absolute association between breasts and sex, people can't separate out the fact that breast feeding is a normal and healthy way to feed, nurture and bond with our children. If more people understood this there would be more love in this country and less pornography.<br>  <br>  I would not eat in the ladies room! Would you? then why should my baby?<br>  <br>  The one thing in life that I can not do, and wish more then anything to have been able to do, is give birth, it is one of the most beautiful things on this earth. Part of that is breast feeding the second most beautiful thing on this earth.<br>  <br>  And Lousie is right, we actually see more tit with some of the bikinis you see on the beach.|`|1O6Yh1esaa	There are some women who breastfeed and are perfectly discreet in public and I don't mind that at all. If you're not drawing attention to yourself or trying to force it down my throat that it's your right to pop out your **** (excuse my crudeness), then I don't care at all. Personally, I don't think I could ever do it even though I'm going to breastfeed when I have my children, but it's not my decision what others do so I keep my mouth shut. One of the things that does get to me is when it's obvious that the women is doing it for the attention. I'm not saying that a lot of women do this, most of them do not, but the fact remains that a very small minority will do it and it's obvious that the woman is doing it for the attention, e.g. exposing both breasts when it's obvious that a child has latched onto one and isn't going to change any time soon. Breasts have been overly sexualized by the media and this is part of the problem, but also the minority of women can give all the rest of the breastfeeding crowd a bad name.|`|d9RbJBvSaa	Breastfeeding is seen as dirty in America because we have all been socialized to objectify the female body. Everyone on both sides of issues such as "sex on TV" are included. Children in Brazil see naked men and women all day on advertisements and no one makes an issue of it. It is neither dirty nor sexy. It is just life. Breastfeeding is a fetish on porn shelves and seen as a private act in public. America's public opinion on decency derives from the Puritan pilgrims from who this country was founded on.<br>  <br>  Was that too much?|`|YQOT68xFaa	Because people are silly. We are so used to thinking of breasts as "boobies" and sexual objects that it seems disgusting and strangely sexual to some people to see a baby suckling. It's also because some people think breasts are only for their viewing pleasure, and they can't lust after a woman's breasts when there's a baby in the way. It makes them feel dirty but they blame it on the woman instead of themselves. There are no real valid reasons for not breastfeeding in public, and no valid reasons to consider it vulgar or in any way dirty.<br>  <br>  There is nothing shameful about breastfeeding; the attitude that it's dirty is what is shameful. A woman does not have to hide that she's breastfeeding, or not do it in public, just because others may be disgusted. They have the choice to not look. She should do it discreetly out of consideration to others, but that is as far as her consideration needs to go. That is the only reason I nurse discreetly in public. <br>  <br>  I will nurse in a bathroom as soon as everyone else starts eating their meals in the bathroom. I will stop feeding my baby in public when it becomes illegal to eat in public and when everyone else stops chowing down in public too. Otherwise, too darn bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  "However, many people don't appreciate seeing an exposed swollen breast feeding a babe in the middle of a park restaurant or mall."<br>  Aw pookie. I'm sure you wouldn't mind seeing a breast that was swollen with implants being exposed, now would you? You see more skin exposed on teenage girls in summer than you see from most breastfeeding moms and I bet you like seeing that. Stop whining.|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	I wouldn't say its dirty or vulgar.  However, many people don't appreciate seeing an exposed swollen breast feeding a babe in the middle of a park restaurant or mall.  Women can and do breastfeed in public and simply make sure their breast is covered.  <br>  <br>  Honestly would you like being out in public and seeing a penis everywhere simply because it was easy to whip out and take a leak.... well, isn't that what it was designed for.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	it boils down to absolute immaturity of the mind.  Only the dirty minded would see it as sexual in nature.  Your feeding a baby for crying out loud.  Everyone likes to pretend that were not animals, but we are, and feeding in public reminds people (uncomfortably) that we are.<br>  <br>  edit-you know what's obscene, one of those 350 lb heffers scarfing down a supersize fast food meal, that makes me sick to see that.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I am horrified when I see a man's breasts. The least they can do is cover those things up in public, I don't care if they say they are trying to feed their baby or not, that's just immoral. And why can't they keep their shirts on and cover up those behinds while they are at it? If I have to see one more man's huge beer belly, sagging breasts, and huge naked behind I will puke. What are these men thinking-have they no shame? What is America coming to? I have almost lost my picnic lunch after some of the sights I"ve accidentally witnessed.   <br>  <br>  As for women-who cares? Women's breasts are splattered on every magazine, tv show, and movie, what's the big deal? I would appreciate some covering up once in a while, but as long as they aren't throwing off their shirts and running down the beach with their breasts bouncing around with their baby attached, I can live with it.|`|NYU37jfGaa	When I was breastfeeding my sons I never had any trouble, nobody ever complained to me or anything.  But I live in the UK and I think we are less prudish here than you are in America.<br>  <br>  I don't understand what the fuss is about really because you don't actually see anything when a woman is breastfeeding, her tit is stuck in the baby's mouth, nothing is visible.  All this stuff about covering yourself with a blanket is absolute nonsense, you don't SEE anything.|`|HimBbU6caa	I'm shocked at some of the answers from women. Unbelievable. I'm all about the the safety and well being of children. If I have to see a milk filled boob in the deli in order for a little one to eat and live...well it would be well worth the trouble. In fact it's no trouble at all. If I'm eating a sandwich at the table why the **** shouldn't a beautiful baby eat at his/her table?<br>  <br>  The people here scare me sometimes. it's so cold all of a sudden. *reaching for the big blanket with the creepy fuzzy balls on it*

How much you are willing to let go and what is worth remembering...I always remind myself that the sun will always shine after every storm..You will always be a better person when you encounter with different experiences in Life....<br>  <br>  This is just my take on your subject.
F7ndXkpraa	Yes, it is normal. Everyone can get stressed out, overwhelmed, angry, and upset sometimes. Its totally normal to be overcome by it all sometimes. If it happens frequently, however, it might be a sign of depression or other conditions like that. Other than that, its completely normal to have an occasional breakdown.|`|DotZU7o3aa	i guess it depends on your definition of a breakdown. i associate that with extreme inability to cope with day to day life for an extended period, even the need for heavy medication or hospitalisation.<br>  we all get depressed, though, from time to time and find it difficult to cope. sometimes meds are a help but usually that allows us to get on with life!!~!
RnjuNJ6faa	I think is the path of growing up...Is pretty normal. Don't behave like a brat if you are not one.<br>  <br>  Here is what i would advice you to do.<br>  <br>  When you are really mad or angry, try keeping mule instead of saying all the wrong things that you will regret. Take a deep breath and count to 10 seconds before responding back. It work for me when i am a teens. Sometime by just saying sorry is not good enough and i am sad to said, your friends are right.<br>  <br>  Yes, it will impact on your friendships. If you don't change it the near future, it will also impact your relationship in love and work places. Be smart, engage your brain before engaging your mouth. If not, you will need to paid a much higher prices in the near future.<br>  <br>  Is good that you would like to change. At least this is a very positive attitude...Cheers to u.|`|DwkO4Y9uaa	you honestly need to just take some time for yourself and relax. it's happening to me now. i'm older than you, and it's not something i'm proud of. just take time to relax and reflect on the things you've said and how nasty they really were. would you want to be screamed at? then have someone say "..oh.....sorry" i know i wouldn't.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	it's hard being a child in todays world. you have to identify what triggers your anger and learn to control yourself. <br>  <br>  have you tried breathing exercises, or counting to ten?<br>  <br>  next step: talk to your parents about getting into counseling.|`|rgp87jjTaa	u shuld punch a pillow or also u can tap yr third eye 10 times and sometimes u can us meditashun to find yr centr and realine yr chi.  also if none of this works u can start a punk rawk band.|`|B24KqmgGaa	You sound like you have raging hormones.

At your age your hormones are on overdrive, which can cause for many different things to occur, including mood swings and anger outbursts.  I would see your doctor and explain all of your symptoms and go into detail about the uncontrollable outbursts of anger.  Otherwise a doctor may be likely to dismiss it as a phase (which it essentially is) however, they may just attempt to send you home with just that.  Make sure they at the very least run tests, give you a referral or something.  Do not leave there empty handed after a patronizing speech.  There are certain things that could help you to get relief from these symptoms.  Good luck to you.

And to tell you the truth its probably because I'm in the same boat as you and I've finally found someone that has it tough like me.  I constantly have to work at things twice as hard to get them done and it seems every job I've had there comes a time I just can't get the job done right and thats how I'm feeling tonight ready to cash in my chips at my current employer but THEN the fight in me always comes back and I can not accept failure without my fullest efforts.  I commend for having the courage to try so many things inspite of setbacks and I know in time you and I will find something we can do well naturally.  We'll get there from our tenacity and strength to persevere through the troubling times.  My brother once told me its how you handle the tough times that give you the opportunity to display and build your character.  You are going to have a wealth of character so long as you keep plugging.|`|8KVvfxdxaa	If you continue to perform for others happiness and acceptance you will never fully succeed.  I think getting out in front of people and doing anything is not failure but a learning experience.

The only one that can call you a failure and truthfully count is YOU.  Everyone else is just a pedestrian watching from the sidelines.  <br>  Find some confidence by looking at all the small things you do in life that you do well.  you may just sing great but to a crappy audience, or just choked a little. As far as dancing, maybe the others are just better, that does not mean your not good.<br>  My advise to my kid is that as long as she's giving her best effort she's never going to disappoint me. I'm not thrilled with the d in algebra but she'll be learning as much of it as she can to make next year better. the rest is all A's and B's.  <br>  not trying is failing and according to your description you have yet to really fail at anything!<br>  I fail at giving short answers!|`|sNoRTobUaa	I think there is only one way you can get your life back in track that is go for the dance team selection..this is the first thing you can do to start with....you may get kicked out as you are so sure about it.but be sure about this you wont be the first person in this world to get kicked out for the second time....and dear just remember you are not going to take your success or failures along with you when you die...just try to be yourself and dont pay any unnecessary attention to what people think about you....just remeber one thing,earth is the only planet in our galaxy which has life(according to scientists)...and you are fortunate enough to exist in it...you have the most beautiful gift that is life..whatelse do you need...maybe you will remain a loser through out your life but try to keep on living your life to the fullest...and be brave to face failure...There is nothing wrong in being a loser,keep on trying,this is your life not your parents,or teachers,or friends life.why are you trying to make them happy...try to make yourself happy first and do what you feel like doing....
s8C6AfLxaa	First, I think that you WERE there, in your dream;as the leader, MC, sort of a "den mother" to these boys; you're the woman leader of the group!  You just didn't recognize yourself!  (Of course, parts of your personality manifested themselves in every character; all dreams are like that, especially those that have several characters, with differing personalities.)<br>  <br>  Well, you first focus on the little actor who leaves to become a banker(!).<br>  That could symbolize a need for financial security...which is on almost all of our minds these days.  Even if you're too young to have to work/pay the bills yet, I'm sure you hear plenty about it from family members and older friends.<br>  <br>  But, fantasy and creativity aren't dispensed with so easily; the boy, now a bit older, stumbles upon the group again.  But, he knows before he tries-he's lost much of his talent and drive to perform, and his place has pretty much been taken by John-a talented but conceited young actor/dancer.  But the woman in charge  (probably yourself,more than any other character and also an "encourager" type) asks him to do one of his best pieces from the time he was there before.<br>  <br>  I see two motifs that emerge...growing up, vs staying a kid forever, and being creative, like an actor or singer (one who hasn't made it big, as of yet) vs. getting and keeping a job that would provide financial security (such as...a banker?).<br>  <br>  It's interesting that the boy's best performance, recognized as such even before he thought of leaving, had to do with dying.  Could it be that he, more so than the others, sees that there's an end to all the acting and prank playing, and he's going to have to do something to make a living.  The woman in charge doesn't even try to make him stay...just do an encore of his best number!<br>  <br>  A much smaller motif also emerges...also one covered in Peter Pan.  Remember...when Peter starts missing his parents, flies home one night, and finds his window locked, and another boy asleep in his bed.  He then resolves not to leave Neverland...and, except for his brief sojourn at Wendy's house, doesn't.  Likewise, in your dream, the boy finds himself "replaced" by the talented, but egotistical, John.<br>  <br>  So, growing up, creativity, financial security, abandonment, being replaced...are these issues you've been dealing with?  It's an interesting dream...you use parts of the Peter Pan story, but don't simply retell it...it's definitely your own creation.  Although financial security is important, I'd advise you to keep your creativity going-maybe starting by writing a story, using your dream as a resource for major characters and plot developments?|`|3WJi9zLsaa	you are a free spirited type of person and you are or will be forced into being a more knowledge instead of creative based life path.. but dont let it happen because if you do it will change who you are... thats what the part about dying means. to die means to become a new person. hence if you let yourself be cahnged you will lose ur free spirit and creativity...<br>  <br>  cool dream tho!
4BBjhHAnaa	It is completely unknown!!!<br>  <br>  We don't even understand being and consciousness, but at least we are used to it and know how it feels.  But death . . . we don't know what that is AT ALL!  <br>  Is it final?  Is there something after? Can we come back?  We certainly don't remember.  And no one can tell us what being dead is like.  Some people have come back from the edge and can talk about that, but they haven't come back from complete and total death.<br>  How is it possible to just stop being?  What would those last moments be like? <br>  <br>  Not knowing what something so permanent is like is a scary thought?  Just think of the other things people are afraid of . . . spiders, heights, Nazis, marriage, germs . . . none of those things is nearly as permanent or mysterious as death.<br>  <br>  Once you die, there is no going back.  You can't fix anything or change how you lived.  There is no longer hope for making amends or doing those things you never got around to doing.<br>  The finality is distressing.|`|gM8GCbyRaa	I think sometimes it's the prospect that we don't know what to expect from death, the ending of our lives. No one can tell us what it truly is or where it will take us, and that makes us fear it. We fear the unknown.<br>  <br>  Other times it could be that we fear going to hell.|`|COGoHqz6aa	Most commonly it is what nature has driven into us to fear death because if no one feared death the race would not thrive. People can also fear death because they don't believe that they have fufilled their life to the fullest. At the same time though the opposite can be true, such as in cases were love for anouther can override the primordial fear of death, such as when a person will sacrafice themselves in order to save eigther a loved one or a child. This reaction though still fall under the drive to continue the human race, because the mind has decided that the other(s) are more likely to better the human race than they would.|`|OI4iDdSKaa	A few things.<br>  <br>  1.) The fact that you don't know when it is coming. I could die within the next few minutes. It is very unexpected, and most people don't like that.<br>  <br>  2.) It can come at any time, meaning you won't be able to finish what you want to finish.<br>  <br>  3.) Some people aren't entirely sure what happens when you die, which can be quite frightening.<br>  <br>  4.) Death can/will be painful, usually. <br>  <br>  These are just a few. Hope I helped.|`|eAGJNC3Haa	i'd say that it is the fear of the unknown and the fact that the human mind is engineered to want control everything and we can't control death and it's frightening to us
OCK7sRGlaa	i had a somewhat similar dream once where i was trapped in my two-year self and no one would believe me that i was 15 (I'm seventeen now) i think all it really means is that you've lost sight of what used to be important to you. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. People change and life goes on.

H55nCLqPaa	Athena wasn't just a war goddess, initially she was primarily  the goddess of crafts such as weaving, a traditionally female pursuit in ancient Greek times. <br>  <br>  In truth, most deities get war added to their portfolio at some point, even gods such as Dionysus are sometimes referenced as war gods. <br>  <br>  Also the status of women in ancient Greek society was nowhere near as low as feminists would have you believe, although it certainly wasn't equal with men.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Male dominated societies often have powerful goddesses as well as gods.  The presence of powerful goddesses does not have any bearing on the position of human women in a society.  And Athena, in particular, as a virgin goddess is even further removed from the lives of real Athenian women, most of whom would have married at an early age.<br>  <br>  Whether the women of ancient Athens were particularly eager to fight in wars I could not say, but I suspect many of them were happy enough to stay at home and get on with the spinning and weaving, rather than going off and getting killed in battle.<br>  <br>  And while they did not participate in war, or in government, they did take part in religious life, taking part in festivals, serving as priestesses, etc.  The annual festival of Athena's birth was the biggest religious festival in Athens, and women participated fully in that.<br>  <br>  And while it is quite true that Spartan women were expected to train to be fit and healthy, participate in sports etc, they did so to make them healthy for the bearing of children, not to participate in war. The idea that there is something desirable about women going off to be killed in battle is a modern one.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Women in ATHENS didn't take part in war, but that doesn't mean women in Ancient Greece didn't.  Spartan women, for example, were trained in martial abilities and may have fought as well.<br>  <br>  In any event, Athena was actually the splitting of the ancient Sumerian/Akkadian/Babylonian Goddess Inanna/Ishtar.  Ishtar was the goddess of sex and war and her traits were carried down for many centuries--often into other goddesses.  Aphrodite became the half of Ishtar that was sex and fertility while Athena inherited the war aspect of the ancient goddess.  That's one theory, at least.  <br>  <br>  And ATHENIAN women had very little power in their society, but not ALL Greek women were like that.  Spartan women had considerable power and later Macedonian women proved to be a force to be reckoned with.  <br>  <br>  An interesting point is that Athena, while the goddess of many things, was seen as the goddess of "Righteous War" or war for a good reason.  Ares, the god of war was actually despised and portrayed rather negatively (as a coward and a whiny man in some stories).  I suppose one question could be, why would a woman be seen as the "righteous" and level headed version of war where as a man was seen as all the negative and barbaric practices of it?|`|QvF8dR7Taa	greek women raised the males of that society and always impressed on them they would rather the die in combat than to surrender to an enemy,that's real power if you ask me,they instill the will to fight even in the face of extremely large army's,such as the persians,just a few greeks defeated the super power of the day.a small army of less than 200,00 beat an army of well over 1 million and did it twice in ancient times,even though they were few in number they became a super power them selves,under alexander the great,with a 125,00 man army he defeated country's with army's three times his own,the arib country's still curse his name because he beat the CRAP out of all of them,they even say he was the DEVIL.he even conquered india and it was because mothers told there sons before a battle to come home victorious or come home dead on there shields,that's pretty inspiring for a son to hear from there mothers and they obeyed to the letter what they were told.so athena was every greek solders mother,hence the goddess of war.|`|DKk4po2paa	Greek people did realize the beauties of women, but Greek men did not wanted to be equal with women

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	You are insecure.  Just looking at your question, it appears you are insecure about your looks.  But in my job things are seldom this simple.  My guess is that you are insecure about who you ARE, and that comes across in your preoccupation about how you LOOK.  The issue is not about how pretty the "other girl" is, it's about you continuing to compare yourself to someone else.  This is a personal insecurity issue.  Work on your view of yourself and the rest will follow.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Much like your last question, continuously ask yourself if you care, and answer no.

It's good to know how to make your self pretty, always try to look good, but just keep worry about yourself, as long as you think you look good, you don't have to worry about others. It's good that you know how good or bad your personality is, and it's good that you are trying to fix it when you know it's not right.

Maybe family, or friends, or a girlfriend, or religion, or just simple down time to enjoy life. It's not uncommon amongst high achievers to be depressed. They've been so driven and dedicated to work that they've taken away from the other aspects of life. They're cruising along, getting ahead in life, but they don't pull over every now and then to stop and smell the roses, the little things in life.<br>  <br>  Howard Hughes was an example. The man was a film director, owned a mining company, airline company, owned a casino -basically your average American success story. But, in the mid 1950's, he had some severe depression and finally suffered several mental breakdowns. After that, he locked himself in his hi-rise Las Vegas apartment for the next fifteen years. Nobody was allowed to come in except housekeeping workers of his choosing. He lost weight, grew really long hair -he even stopped wearing clothes for some reason. When the 6'4 Texan died up there in 1971, he only weighed 70 pounds.<br>  <br>  What went wrong? The answer: He was missing major aspects of his life. Sure, he was a success, and a celebrity, but he died single, alone, and depressed. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have my great grandma. She'd been a homekeeper for my great grandpa for most of her life. She never held down a job, never written a book, lived in a small trailer just out of town, really wasn't noticed. She was average, or what some people would call below average. But she had a loving family around her, she had a husband (until he died, long ago), she was a good Christian, and she liked to garden. She died almost four years ago at the age of 88. Her estate was valued at less than $50,000. We didn't even have enough left over for a proper funeral. But she died very happy, I can assure you that.<br>  <br>  Let this be a lesson. Sometimes other aspects of your life need attention too.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	You may need to learn to value YOU, for who you are and not what you do or what you succeed in.

It's frequently about what's going on in the chemistry of your brain.  <br>  <br>  However, once you go meet with a psychiatrist to get some feedback about if this is biochemical or not, I would encourage you to take a serious look at your life.  You are 17 years old, you're in college AND you have three jobs?  Other than this, do you have a life?  Do you have friends that you spend time with?  Do you socialize?  I would be depressed if I didn't have a life outside of work and school.  Take a look and see which is the chicken and which is the egg.  But still go meet with a psychiatrist to see if being on medication would be helpful.  And remember achievement and money are not going to bring happiness to your life.|`|xPeIvywdaa	you sound like a high standard setting young man, maybe even a perfectionist<br>  <br>  the thing is, no one can live up to the standards you might set, and anyone would get depressed when faced with them<br>  <br>  when it comes down to it you just have to be happy with who you are, what you have, and everything else in your life<br>  <br>  desire is the root of pain|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Money or jobs can not make you happy.

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I don't think there is growing disrespect in America for all things feminine-I think there's about the SAME amount of disrespect that there has been for decades-it just shifts around to different parts of society. I also think there is quite a bit of disrespect for men and people of color and that if disrespect is growing in America, I"d say it's towards gays and lesbians and bisexuals. <br>  <br>  What contributes to the on-going disrespect for feminine things in America? <br>  -I'd say the media sends a mixed message that women are suppose to be pretty but nice but also not too smart, ugh, how are you suppose to cope with that bunch of trashy thinking? <br>  -Other than the media, we have a very traditional bunch of generations who believe in rigid gender roles, who are anything but supportive of women being something other than a housewife if they want to choose other things-and they absolutely are awful towards men who want to be househusbands. These same antiquated and rigid ideas are shared by many of our politicians and employers as well..so our political arena and workplaces are still being run by ppl who are decades behind the rest of society. <br>  -How about a number of conservative and even moderate religious groups that don't think women should lead their organizations, implying they are inferior..  <br>  <br>  How does it affect the way women (and men) view themselves?

If this electricity were, visible, your brain would appear to be glowing brightly when your awake.  But your sleeping brain would have only an odd spark here and there, except during dreams.  Then your brain would glow as if it were awake!  You can toss and turn most of the night, but never while dreaming.  That's because your muscles go limp during dreams.  Perhaps your brain prevents your muscles from moving so that you don't hurt yourself while dreaming.  They say if you die in a dream its good luck???

oVeGMNsLaa	Yes, quite.<br>  <br>  I find it quite disturbing when people speak in absolutes, without any compassion or understanding or even just caveats, and this the conversation I mostly hear in response to any mention of pedophilia.  Even when I make it clear that I in no way condone acting upon such feelings, the people I'm talking with have to go one step further, to make it clear how sick and vile and wrong and disgusting it is.  I find it almost impossible to discuss it with someone without emotion getting in the way.<br>  <br>  I think that a lot of it comes from our widespread belief that pedophilia CANNOT be treated . . . and indeed, it seems like the little research there is out there shows that it isn't an impulse that can just go away, or be trained to go away.  From what I know, pedophiles simply must fight their feelings, every day.  And because of that, while it is of course possible to remain celibate, I don't see there being anything wrong with taking away the temptation and possibility of molestation by lessening contact with children and so on.<br>  <br>  But there is a big difference between keeping your child away from the pedophiles' house, and insulting and treating them like subhuman creatures.  "The Shield" had a wonderful, heartbreaking storyline of a convicted sex offender who moved in next to a detective's ex-wife and her teen daughter.  She asked her ex-husband to get him to move, and he confronted the man, who told him "I did it, I've done my time, and I stay away from jailbait, okay?".  But that wasn't enough for the woman or her husband- he ended up planting kiddie porn in the man's house and getting him arrested.  It was just a horrible example of how much people's fears will trump any sort of decency.<br>  <br>  I think my answer has been jumbled, but yes, I agree with you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry I didn't answer the second part of the question.  I definitely feel that there should be more avenues for pedophiles to express their sexuality.  I believe that pedophilic erotica that does not feature real life children (i.e. drawn or rendered on a computer) should be allowed.  One needs only look at the case of Karen Fletcher, a woman who clearly had some issues, but who ran a website for adults only, with text-only stories about the molestation and torture of children, mostly to deal with her own experience of being molested.  She was taken up to court, even though everything was fictional.  It's ridiculous.  People are still operating off the already-proven-to-be-untrue idea that porn will drive somebody to do something, when in fact it usually takes care of that desire and reduces the rate of such thing happening in the real world.<br>  <br>  Also, I am REALLY disturbed by this statement: "So would it also be right to stop a Muslim man from boarding a plane?"  You seem to be implying that Muslims are all terrorists, which is so untrue.  Pedophiles ARE people with the inclination to have sexual relationships with children.  Muslims are a religious group with no more of an inclination towards terrorism than any other religion.|`|3862H0WVaa	It is just the way there libido has developed. It is actually no different to any deviation of sexual development. The problem with pedophilia is that the object of their desires are innocent children which is abhorrent to us.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Death and I really don't give a s**t who's rights get trampled on on this one. Lots of people have died for less worthy causes and in the end, we all leave this place...pedophiles who resist their "urges" ...that's a farce if I ever heard one.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Any molester is a horrible, horrible, b@$t@rd and should die a horrific death.<br>  <br>  However someone who does everything they can to avoid thinking about children in that way and is seeking help for their problem should not be ridiculed.  Rather, they should be congratulated for recognizing their illness (being attracted to prepubescent children cannot be natural, even if it is a lifelong affliction) and seeking help.  People in their community should support this.  I think there is nothing wrong with trying to keep their children away from these people, however.  It is removing temptation and keeping the children safe.  It is like keeping a recovering alcoholic away from booze.  They shouldn't alienate that person from adult society.<br>  <br>  I do think that people tend to alienate anyone they know with this affliction.  It is strange and frightening and it is hard to trust that they won't do something wrong.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	If a person is a pedophile, and they don't act upon their desires, I do feel sympathy for them.  You don't choose these things and if they acknowledge that they can't legally or morally be sexual with children, then they've really done nothing wrong and I pity them.  It's the people who abuse children who are the criminals, not the innocent people who are merely victims of something people really can't understand.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	If someone is born with the predilection of being attracted to children it is not their fault.<br>  <br>  They can be stellar people with hearts of gold.<br>  <br>  If they don't act on their feelings regarding their attraction to children they are no better or worse than you or me.|`|8bGRAAUoaa	Their not treated unfairly..........as long as their in prison.

Kind of a catch-22. How do you not look down on someone with pedophile tendencies? Because, whatever the cause, it's such a bad thing. <br>  <br>  This question applies to other situations. For example, a suicidal person may not seek help because they don't want to be labeled as such, or they fear being locked up in a hospital. But what is more important? Obviously, the most important thing is their safety. <br>  <br>  In the case of the pedophile who wants help but does not want to face ridicule, the safety of children is far more important than any embarrassment or even harassment s/he may face. Maybe not the answer you want, but it's got to be the right one.<br>  <br>  Edit: You wrote: "What would you do if someone came up to you and said "sorry, it's now illegal for you to act on any of your sexual desires." Pedophilia is harmful to children. End of story. What alternative could there ever be to allow a pedophile to act out their desires? Are you serious??? Child molestation is a heinous act. Compared to that, any other issue in your question is irrelevant.|`|zXPGm2fraa	To be sure, if anyone seeks help from a psychiatric counselor (certified) they can do so in strict confidence. No one ever has to know outside the counseling sessions what they are about, and counselors have a strict code of confidence. Maybe there isn't a lot of research on this that has been done on ways to help someone with this problem, but a personal counselor would try to find a way to help, I don't know why "society" would ever even know, unless the person did something to let them know.|`|xZmepGVUaa	If you want someone to blow sunshine up your kazoo, you are out of luck. Treatments are limited and society should be quick to criminalize the behavior. Such behavior must be eliminated and treated. And if they are never able to have a relationship with adults, tough luck. They'll have to settle for masturbation, because sex with children is verbotten.   End of story.|`|4e18c82089d9eecf334053f6edf2d156aa	pedophiles arent treated unfairly. its just plain wrong to have sex with kids. its wrong to put children in a position where they are sexual objects, such as kiddie porn.<br>  <br>  now with that said, one of the most horrifying things to do is to accuse someone of being a pedophile when they are not. our society seems to have made this a modern day witch hunt. nobody seems to be taking an objective look at things such as child abuse and some of the outrageous child trafficking accusations being made because they do not want to be told they are "anti-child" or labeled as a pedophile.<br>  <br>  for instance, i have seen accusations that a town in the philippines has 150,000 prostitutes working in one city. of these 30,000 are as young as six. nobody bothered to check that the entire population of the city was only 270,000 people. that makes making more than half the entire population (including women and men) prostitutes!!!|`|FUIBscKGaa	Thank you for this question.  I know it's a tough one to bring up, and your doing so is appreciated.<br>  <br>  Pedophiles who have not offended are completely free to seek help without anybody ever knowing.  Perhaps there should be more of a campaign (I've seen a tiny bit, but not much) encouraging them to do so.  But due to the soul murder that the little victims go through, it's hard to feel sympathy for those who commit such a heinous act.  We also still know that virtually all offenders were victims, (though the percentage of victims who become perps is still low) so I can't believe the chances of feeling that way is somehow just another sexual orientation.  All evidence says otherwise. <br>  <br>  Whatever the opinions, this is one that we can all agree needs solving.  Thanks again for bringing it up.|`|R1WapAO6aa	To some extent, a lot of them will act upon their desires given the chance. It's like having women around you and never being able to touch them. I don't really care that they are attracted to them, they just need to learn that what they want to do damages a child. Even if the child doesn't mind, their mind isn't completely developed and they don't have any maturity yet. A lot of children who are sexually abused later on have psychological problems (ie: sexual addiction). Sexual offenders don't get treated unfairly, i think it's right to keep them away from children and warn other people. I wouldn't want my child's life getting ruined. That's why i appreciate shows like "to catch a predaotor," it separates the people who can control themselves.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	In agree with you ; that much more research should be done on this mental illness ; but the government prefer to put them in jail [ look like its cheaper this way ] than paying for good treatment|`|mCAWxobNaa	It's a fair question and my feeling is that when it comes to the safety of children, society is willing to err on the side of caution and this applies to many things.  I don't know what percent of paedophiles commit paedophilic crimes nor do I think anyone would be willing to wait for this to happen, in a prospective manner.  So in the interest of children's safety society says that paedophilia is unacceptable in all capacities.  I think that the risk that paedophiles pose is too great to experiment with.  I'm sure that they are the targets of great ridicule whether they have control over their proclivities or not.  The same thing can be said about those who fantasize about killing people- as a society we simply can't afford to take the risk and allow this to go on (even if it's their nature to get pleasure from serial killing).<br>  <br>  Prepubescent children deserve more protection by secular law than adults hence the deterrent to potential criminals against children should be very serious, even if it infringes upon others' "rights," even if that means that they be ridiculed.  This does, indeed, suggest that ridiculing of paedophiles is a necessary, though unintended consequence of keeping children safe.
1YBLPUFqaa	I sense no significant correlation. However, sensible people usually speak only when it improves the silence.<br>  <br>  There is a myriad of intelligence interpretations.

Where one exceeds in one avenue, they may be lacking in another.  So I suppose you would have to better define intelligence.

Well, I could easily tease him back and destroy his teasing habit forever, but I just don't. I seem to have a wild imagination when it comes to creativity, but that is just me. I wish I could smash him with my fist, but I just don't. I seem not to like violence, and I avoid it. I have seen so many terrible things during my high school years and I was even a victim once. I have seen students get shot, students get ganged up on with no one to help, constant bleeding, students living their high school lives avoiding their enemies due to a repeat of getting beat up again, girls getting hit, teachers being hit, there was absolutely no control over anything in my days in high school. The only thing I do is hurt feelings, but hurting physically is something I don't do; except when I have to resort to defending myself, or someone I care about. Anyway, the people in my neighborhood are punks who like to mess around with others, but they often do mean what they say if they say something.

c3cd1088f9f516de2edee8c0396bef5daa	Yeah, it's called lucid dreaming. I don't think you can actually control being *able* to dream lucidly, but I'm pretty sure it just happens randomly. <br>  <br>  A few times I've 'woken up' in my dream: I just realized that I was dreaming and figured I could manipulate the dream just by imagining different things happening. For example, once I had an anxiety dream about being late for class when I remembered that it was summer, and then I was able to control aspects of the dream for a short time. But then I lost lucidity and went back to dreaming. (Randomly: when I lost lucidity I thought I was ACTUALLY waking up, but then actually fell back into the dream.)<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes when I'm dreaming and don't realize I'm dreaming, I intuitively know that if I think really hard about something, it will happen. This has happened a couple of times when I've dreamed that I was being chased/searched for. I would freak out because I couldn't find a hiding place, but then 'know' that if I just concentrated really hard on them NOT seeing me, they wouldn't - so I did and it worked.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	It is called lucid dreaming.

There is more to therapy then just helping serious problems, and so much you can learn. If you can afford it and find a decent one, I think you should go for it. They can help you with decision making, to help see other points of views to situations. You might only have to go once a month, but it could improve the quality of life.
ROlJWRT7aa	Due to me being a constant dreamer. Dreams to me are what you saw, heard, or even did on your day or what has been on your mind most of the time. So in other words its a summary of your day. What i can tell you is that it seems to me that you might always wanted to use what you have learned to one day help or even save the life of people. In that case you saving the life of that little boy shows that you are willing to save even if they do not appreciate you. But the alligators i think it just an exaggeration or something you saw through out your day, maybe a commercial or something. They are like saying saving someone out of a burning building while its falling down or something. they did not matter in helping that kid so seems like you will make a great nurse, already thinking about helping.

Several of their songs had become instant hits in the UK long before their American trip.

906a6ae6f41dff1d6d4759c7c004ce4aaa	Okay, Fine...<br>  <br>  Let's look at the "story" you had written within you.....<br>  <br>  <br>  in my dream i lived with my elderly father and my younger sister and our crazy mother. We lived in a shack on a farm <br>  <br>  ((Dream opens by commenting on you... It is the state or condition that you see yourself:  a "shack".... You know why you felt that way about yourself... It also appears that you worked alot, too, in those days "on a *symbolic* farm"....))<br>  <br>  <br>  and we were very poor and my sister and i were very unhappy <br>  <br>  ((These describe moods of the way things were...Dream says you were not happy, then...))<br>  <br>  because our mother was extremely mean to us.<br>  <br>  ((a reason:  ...."because"...))<br>  <br>   Anyway eventually oneday i realised that my mother was on edge a little more than usual and realized she had a shot gun <br>  <br>  ((guns indicate an unused power which is present for the "someday" snap of it all....Dream says you realized your mother would realize she had it....There are two ways about a gun:  Either for protection... or for destruction.... One of these do not belong....))<br>  <br>  so i tried to sneak my sister and I out of the house <br>  <br>  ((Dream says that you made attempts to protect your "sister"..... to get her out of this situation....))<br>  <br>  and go find our father who was away at our neighbors (which was miles away). <br>  <br>  ((Your father lived away from you and your "sister"?? - an alternative living condition, you were thinking...))<br>  <br>  She realized i was trying to sneak away and she shot us both. <br>  <br>  ((Your mother exerted that power she had and refused to let you and your "sister" go, the dream says, she let you have it... and made it known..))<br>  <br>  Then i woke up (still in the dream) and it was the same day and i tried over an over again to prevent the shooting and no matter what i did i couldn't stop it.<br>  <br>  ((Dream says that you knew something was going to happen if your mother found out that you were thinking about going to your father's house.... and you replayed the issue in your mind of how to keep her from knowing....  But, you couldn't do anything about it...))<br>  <br>   Once i got outside and my father was coming home and i said "Daddy help!" and then my mother shot him then me. <br>  <br>  ((Dream says that even your father is powerless over your mother's commands....He couldnt' help you...))<br>  <br>  It just went on and on. Another wierd thing is that i am the youngest in my family in real life and i have no younger sister. Also my father is younger than my mother in real life, and we live in a house.<br>  <br>  **I never would have known from this telling that you had no "sister"....  Let it be known to you that we may also play the part/role of anyone in the dream.  Such is the matter with your "sister" in this dream.  It means that you feel the need to symbolically protect yourself from what your mother is doing....  Your perspective sees this other 'entity' (the sister) as being someone else, when it is still yourself, but from another perspective of the matter..... <br>  <br>  And, it is only because the dream HAS to fill in the story....  It does this by putting an 'entity' character in the place of self... <br>  <br>  <br>  Your sister,<br>  Ginger,<br>  ((dream interpreter for over 20 years))|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	One opinion:  your dreaming conscious has scripted a negative portrait of your mother.  Instead of being the older one as she is in real life, your father is scripted as being weaker and helpless; your dream mother has all the power (she's both crazy/out of control, and has firepower), and she's on to you.  You've scripted a younger version of yourself, a younger sister, who is your inner child, and you try to defend her against the "pistol-packin momma."<br>  <br>  The process of waking up in your dream as you continue dreaming is indicative of a more integrated consciousness, at least in this area of family dynamics.<br>  <br>  Being poor may be a symbol or way your waking subconscious, which is your dreaming conscious, has of telling its feelings about being underprivileged by what it believes to be an over-controlling parent.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dreamviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamviews.com</a><br>  "The Master of Lucid Dreams," Dr. Olga Kharitidi,<br>  "The Masters and Their Retreats," Mark Prophet,<br>  "Watch Your Dreams," Ann Ree Colton,<br>  <a href="http://www.dreamhealer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamhealer.com</a>|`|JJZi7r6maa	Dreams are often not accurate with time, place and settings. So that's nothing to worry about. Seeing you're having dreams your mother is shooting someone (I assume you are close with) and care a lot about could reflect on an issue between your parents that upset you, and your mom was the cause of it. Can you remember if back then there was something that upset you?|`|xpMy3Qlaaa	May be is a nightmare,  you just remember your mother how you like him

Your a FEMALE in a MALE dominated job as it has been that way for a long time. You will have to work harder at what you do and prove yourself to the "guys" but when they do become aware you can do everything as well as they can you will be accepted like one of the guys and probably become like a "little sister" to them and they will always be there for you. I am in a dept with a female ff and have been through training with females and they are just as determined and capable as their male counterpart in fact my g/f is a paramedic/FF. You must understand that these stereotypes have been and will be in place for awhile, and at the very end of this argument will be the fact that men are by pure nature and physics the stronger of the sexes, but that is for arguments sake as I have seen females lug around all the big FF tools just as easy as men. One more thing I will say is that when "proving yourself" to your male counterparts if they are a little hung up on the woman idea just don't be too cocky and pick and choose your battles as becoming too cocky will only cause them to further disregard your abilities and judge you as "the annoying girl". You’re going against a time old "but changing" male dominated job play your cards right and show them your worth and you will surpass the B.S. of being treated as incapable. Also remember FF or not you are still a female and they are still men so don't expect to be treated totally as a man.... because you are not. Good Luck hope I was able to help.|`|JPAKGa8haa	I am actually at present writing my dissertation on this subject. Many psychologists and sociologists have hinted that you are being treated differently as your make counterparts are yet to accept you as their equal, despite the fact you no doubt have the same abilities as them. (you will have gone through the same training as them so should be treated as their equal). Do you feel prejudiced against just from your colleagues or from the public too?|`|OI4iDdSKaa	The answer is quite silly, really.<br>  <br>  Most male-dominated occupations have this. <br>  <br>  Female police officers aren't seen as strong enough.<br>  <br>  Female Doctors aren't seen as smart enough.<br>  <br>  It is something you will have to deal with. Instead of letting it affect you, I would just work harder to prove those idiots wrong.|`|BeGiNoTSaa	First of all dont mind all the other male fire fighters they think they know and they could do everything what a female cant.<br>  <br>  Probably they treat you different because you know men they think that females cant do everything they can do. But, this is my only advice for you try your best and prove to them that you could do anything a male or anyone you work with do. Good luck. I hope this helps.

Do you know why you lose control in the dream?  What is it that is causing you this?  Is it because the wheel is too loose? or the pedal is too hard?  These issues, indicate why you cannot take control responsibly.... Let's say it is that the wheel is too loose:  It indicates that even though you can control your steered direction, and this is choice, it is... it still means that it is too easy to make mistakes while making those choices.....There are other factors, you'll have to pinpoint why you are losing control to know it.....))<br>  <br>  even though im doing alll the right things.<br>  <br>  ((Dream says that you feel you are doing things right... But, accordingly, something is, indeed, wrong, because you still end up losing control here.....))<br>  <br>  last night i was driving, and then i was going too fast,<br>  <br>  ((Aha!!!.... There is a problem... You are trying to do things too quickly.... You must slow down to gain control here..... So, says the dream....))<br>  <br>   so i pull my foot off the gas, <br>  <br>  ((Okay... so, you tried to ease up.. that's good....))<br>  <br>  and hit the break. <br>  <br>  ((Dream says you stopped doing something.... You'll have to think on it, because this is just a brief telling of your a page of your life's history...))<br>  <br>  nothing happens. <br>  <br>  ((Dream says you have put some things into place to try to make things right... However, nothing happened after you took these measures.. or rather, took these steps....))<br>  <br>  then i pull the emergency break, <br>  <br>  ((Dream says that you felt some emergency steps were in order... So, you've completely stopped something...))<br>  <br>  and still nothing.<br>  <br>  ((and even though you completely stopped this, nothing has happened, still.....))<br>  <br>  then i woke up and slammed my face into the wall next to my bed.<br>  <br>  **I do not believe this is a part of the dream as you state:  "I woke up".....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your sister,<br>  Ginger,<br>  ((Dream Interpreter for over 20 years))|`|OCK7sRGlaa	I have these dreams all the time.

eVYhqaXDaa	1. Inflation for the last 6 months has been negative (CPI index August 2008=219.086; January 2009=211.143). So if the employer adjusted for inflation, the offer would be lower.<br>  2. Wages are more closely linked to the job market than to inflation. Given the increase in unemployment, there should be a downward pressure on wages. Thus a company is not likely to increase the salary for the same job offered six months ago.<br>  If you are a hot prospect, the company may be willing to raise the offer to get you to accept. This increase, however, will have nothing to do with inflation.

iUzSlmSbaa	Well if men can act shy and nervous around you and you don't think worse of them for it.. then they would be shallow minded if you act nervous around them sometimes.. it doesn't make you unattractive. You have to believe in yourself. that has to come from within yourself not by compliments from others although of course it's a big boost if someone you are attracted to pays you a compliment.. then you feel more attractive.. makes sense.. but you have to just be yourself, respect yourself and respect others. If you are nervous you can't help it.. and you don't have to tell a man you find him attractive.. if they are nice to you.. say.. ''thanks I appreciate that, you aren't too bad either.. I enjoy talking to you'' that shows them you are interested in them and you say in a casual way which obliges them to nothing that you would like to get to know them better. If they feel the same about you.. when you tell them ''I enjoy talking to you'' if they feel the same in your company they will try to find another opportunity to talk to you.. and a smile helps.. a nice smile.. that does not make you look as if you want to ''catch that guy'' but it shows you seem to like him, it does not mean you are in love with him.. but a guy likes it also if a girl smiles at him.. you look more attractive when you smile to everybody.. not just to a guy.. to everyone.. a smile also makes you appear more approachable and open minded .. so guys register that.. and they think..''she smiles at me.. seems she might like me..it obliges a guy to nothing but if he likes you too, he knows you are not likely to push him away if he asks you out on a date...body language ..in this case a smile can convey more than words.. so i would smile and it's ok to be a bit nervous.. just try to be yourself.. and if someone likes you and you are a bit shy if you smile and are approachable, some will still want to get to know you better. One has to talk to a person...and remember they aren't perfect either. nor are you.. you don't look for the perfect guy and most guys don't look for the perfect girl.. but for someone who has something in common with them.. someone whom they can respect, trust, and talk to about everything.. often a relationship with a guy is successful if they start being great friends.. get to know each other better and if there is a ''connection'' other than being pals.. they will find out and then they will take it to a higher level.. if a guy feels he can talk to you about most things... he will feel at ease in your company.. that's great and if you feel the same.. communication is important and to be there for each other.. sometimes he may need someone to unburden his problems to and sometimes it may be you.. then don't hold back.. once you know the guy a bit better and he becomes a friend.. friendship is give and take.. whoever is in greater need at the time should be the one who can rely on the other to be ''their rock..'' that is not always the guy, it can also be an emotional rock..and a girl or a woman can be just as supportive and understanding and compassionate and help a man... a guy in a moment when he needs a friend''|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Do not play game, just be straight, that is the only way to know the truth. soon or late it comes down to this anyway, right?|`|OLOzGXUZaa	you can tell if a man finds you attractive because he will start hitting on you. sexy girl|`|LBbKmemxaa	You're right, sista.'|`|w6dXWoPzaa	from his body language|`|yl2pJauAaa	boys are shy because we cant just come up to u and ask u out OK!??! he likes u...|`|HHbreVLQaa	A man likes u when he thinks that ur hot, cute, nice, sexy and u love to have great sex<br>  <br>  so sex him babe lol

But then again, we also tend to more rigidly enforce men's gender expression than women's, so it makes sense.|`|OTT79NAtaa	I don't know that either group gets 'upset' at this. I feel that today (and I assume you are talking about contemporary experience, in free countries) women have a broader 'gender identity' in itself. Women can be shy or extroverted.

Whereas men it seems are only affirmed by society through one set of actions, and that is to uphold traditional masculinity and drive towards social success. <br>  <br>  However today it's not even this simple for men. From what I can tell, though men are still only allowed to be considered 'successful' by fulfilling the typical masculine ideal, society is starting to demonize masculinity! It seems that a man can only win by being a "MAN"; however being a "MAN" is slowing becoming politically incorrect.

Sobre los fundamentos de la "Sociología Comprensiva": El problema de la "causalidad" en la ciencias histórico-sociales y la síntesis weberiana de "comprender" (Verteben) y "explicar" (Erkl?ren).<br>  <br>  para copiar la informacion seleccionas y das ctrl+c  por que de otra forma NO SE PUEDE|`|197231e4e4f26eb736beba75e4f92b38aa	Uno de los momentos fundamentales sobre los cuales se construye el esfuerzo de la "sociología comprensiva" de Max Weber, se articula en torno a la noción de Valor, concepto donde se sintetiza, a la vez que se juega en su totalidad, la posibilidad de establecer las bases de un conocimiento "objetivo", como fundamento de las ciencias sociales. El problema del Valor en la sociología de Weber, desde mi punto de vista, refiere diversos aspectos, en su conjunto, subordinados a la relación fundamental entre ciencia (social) y valores, o el lugar de los valores en su aplicación metodológica. En otras palabras, sus afirmaciones en torno al Valor se orientan con el fin de especificar sin lugar a equívocos su nueva metodología científica. La precisión de su intencionalidad cognoscitiva no está al margen del contexto histórico de su época. La discusión respecto a lo que constituye un "hecho histórico", en medio del virulento contexto político de Restauración o Revolución de su tiempo, no pudo sino signar la posición teórica de la intelectualidad alemana misma. Los historiadores consideraron que esta discusión debía formar parte de su dirimir propio. Pero esta actitud, que para ellos significaba dar relevancia a su hacer, para Weber es la causa de una de las confusiones metodológicas más graves de la relación entre ciencia y valores. El significado de los valores en la teoría del Weber alude -siguiendo la lectura de Luis Aguilar al respecto- a tres cuestiones específicas: <br>  <br>  1) a las funciones que juegan los valores en la ciencia y que brevemente, podríamos decir, se refieren a la selección, conceptualización y explicación de los hechos de "relación de valor"; 2) a la pregunta sobre el condicionamiento de la ciencia por los valores, es decir, por la "objetividad" de los resultados científicos y cuya respuesta corresponde a los "límites" de los valores en el método, en tanto que la verdad no depende de ninguna validez sino de la fecundidad científica, coherencia lógica y objetividad empírica; 3) a la cuestión de si el método, condicionado por valores, pero a la vez capaz de producir resultados objetivos, no tiene una cierta facultad de decisión sobre los Valores, es decir, sobre la validez de una ética profesional o de un programa gubernamental o político.|`|217f3f2628dc186d846862586474ce6baa	La sociología comprensiva pretende que el individuo llegue “a explicarse el significado último de su propia conducta”Y esto, concluye Weber, no es de poca monta.<br>  La sociología comprensiva utiliza tales construcciones conceptuales de carácter racional – los tipos de acción social, entre los cuales centra la preferencia en la acción racional con arreglo a fines – como un instrumento para la explicación de las acciones reales. La construcción de una acción rigurosamente racional con arreglo a fines le sirve en estos casos a la sociología – debido a su evidente inteligibilidad y, mientras que racional, univocidad – como un tipo (tipo ideal), por intermedio del cual se comprende la acción real, influenciada por irracionalidades de toda especie (afectos, errores), como un desvío del desarrollo esperado de la acción racional. De esa manera – afirma Weber – pero apenas en virtud de estos fundamentos de conveniencia metodológica, puede ser que el método de la sociología comprensiva sea racionalista. Este procedimiento no debe, por lo tanto, ser interpretado como un prejuicio racionalista de la sociología, sino apenas como un recurso metódico; y mucho menos, por lo tanto, como si implicara la creencia de una primacía en la vida de lo racional.<br>  2.3.2 Sociología comprensiva de M. Weber<br>  <br>  a) Origen<br>  <br>  M. Weber (1864-1920) detectó en 1903, se?alan Mardones y Ursúa (1994; p. 151), ambigüedad en los juicios de valor en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales, captando de ese modo el carácter compresivo de las acciones históricas y culturales del ser humano. Decía que si no se comprendía el significado de un objeto (Verstehen), no se entendía en absoluto, de ahí que introdujera la necesidad del método comprensivo en las ciencias sociales, dando origen a la sociología comprensiva.<br>  <br>  b) Objeto de estudio<br>  <br>  El objeto de estudio de la sociología comprensiva de Weber es la acción social, pero no toda clase de acción es social, como lo se?aló (Weber, 1992; p. 18). Por ello, la sociología compresiva a la que se refiere es aquella que realiza sus acciones con arreglo a un fin y se integra con los siguientes elementos: constitución de una disciplina social, que tenga un significado, que clarifique su acción social, que tenga sentido, que ofrezca evidencia de sus acciones y siga algunos pasos del método científico.<br>  <br>  A Weber le llevó varios a?os (1903 a 1919) captar la estructura de la sociedad donde se desenvolvía (Alemania del Este) y definir dentro de élla los elementos de una acción social, que luego constituyeron su escuela. Concluida la Primera Guerra Mundial e iniciada la era industrial europea, Weber tenía lista su concepción sociológica, la cual se inscribió en los postulados del humanismo, que opuso al racionalismo dominante.<br>  <br>  c) Características<br>  <br>  Weber concibió a la sociología como la ciencia que pretende entender e interpretar la acción social. Por acción social designó a la conducta humana donde el sujeto o sujetos se enlazan por un sentido subjetivo y comparte un sentido. Consideró a una acción social comprensible, ya sea porque existe de hecho, porque es un caso históricamente dado, porque es una acción promedio de un número determinado de acciones o porque es una acción construida bajo un tipo ideal, donde la evidencia es la posibilidad de revivir plenamente la conexión de sentido o los sentimientos vividos con arreglo a fines; es decir, cuando son conocidos los valores y el carácter último que orienta a la acción social.<br>  <br>  Todo este esquema le llevó a construir tipos puros o tipos ideales de acción, que son aquellas estructuras que muestran en sí la unidad más consecuente de una adecuación de sentido lo más plenamente posible, siendo por eso mismo, tan poco frecuentes quizás en la realidad ?en la forma pura absolutamente ideal? como una reacción física calculada sobre el supuesto de un espacio absolutamente vacío (Weber, 1992; pp. 5-9, 17).<br>  <br>  d) Procedimientos<br>  <br>  Las estructuras de la sociología comprensiva propuestas por Weber que permiten identificar y comprender una acción social con sentido, dicen Mardones y Ursúa (1994; pp. 151-158), se apegan a los siguientes procedimientos:<br>  <br>  · Una acción social es la que presenta un sentido objetivamente justo o de un sentido verdadero metafísicamente fundado.<br>  <br>  · Los límites de una acción con sentido y un modo de conducta reactivo es que no está unida a un sentido subjetivamente mentado.<br>  <br>  · Toda interpretación como toda ciencia tiende a la evidencia de la comprensión; pudiendo ser ésta racional (lógica) o endopática (afectiva). La llamada Ley de Gresham conlleva una interpretación racional evidente de la conducta humana en determinadas condiciones y desde el punto de vista típico-ideal.<br>  <br>  · Los procesos y objetos ajenos al sentido entran en el ámbito de las ciencias de la acción como ocasión, resultado, estímulo u obstáculo de la acción humana.<br>  <br>  · Puede entenderse por comprensión: i) la comprensión actual del sentido de una acción, ii) la comprensión explicativa que se comprende por sus motivos.<br>  <br>  · Comprensión equivale en los casos a captación interpretativa de sentido o conexión de sentido: i) mentado realmente en la acción, ii) mentado en promedio o de modo aproximativo, y iii) construido científicamente por métodos tipológicos para la elaboración del tipo ideal de un fenómeno frecuente.<br>  <br>  · Los procesos y regularidades que son incomprensibles, en el sentido aquí empleado, no pueden ser clasificados de hechos o leyes sociológicas como lo implica la sociología comprensiva. <br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva. Besos|`|e76dee3d86e4b6e4871d8fdfc4f499fcaa	La "sociología comprensiva" de Max Weber parte de la tesis de que el objeto de esta disciplina ha de ser la acción social. Para ello hay que decir, en primer lugar, qué es una acción humana y, en segundo lugar, qué es lo que le confiere a esta acción humana un carácter social. Para Weber, la acción (Handlung) se distingue del mero comportamiento (Verhalten) "en la medida en que el actor o los actores unen a él un sentido subjetivo". No se trata, naturalmente, de que este sentido sea verdadero o correcto, sino simplemente que sea mentado por un sujeto. Ahora bien, no toda acción con sentido es necesariamente una acción social. Acción social sería aquélla cuyo sentido mentado por el actor o los actores se refiere al comportamiento de otros. La acción social, en su realización, se orientaría por ese comportamiento. El comportamiento de los otros puede ser pasado, presente o esperado en el futuro. Los "otros" pueden ser individuales y conocidos o también plurales y desconocidos. Según esto, no todo contacto entre personas es propiamente acción social. Es necesario que el sentido del propio comportamiento incluya a los otros. Por eso, determinados comportamientos meramente reactivos, aunque estén provocados por otros, no son propiamente sociales, pues no incluyen un sentido.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Los distintos tipos de sentido que pueden estar unidos por el sujeto a la acción determinan, según Weber, distintos tipos de acción social. Como es sabido, Weber distingue entre acciones racionales respecto a fines, racionales respecto a valores, acciones afectivas y acciones tradicionales. Las acciones racionales respecto a fines se caracterizan por la utilización de las expectativas de comportamiento de las cosas y de los hombres como condiciones o medios para fines propios racionalmente buscados. Las acciones racionales respecto a valores, en cambio, se rigen por la fe en el valor incondicional de un determinado comportamiento independiente de su éxito. Las acciones afectivas se rigen por afectos y situaciones sentimentales. Finalmente, las acciones tradicionales se rigen por la costumbre. Para Weber, tanto las acciones afectivas como las tradicionales se encuentran en el límite de la acción propiamente social, pues en ellas es difícil de constatar la presencia de un sentido.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Naturalmente, Weber admite que en la mayor parte de las acciones reales los actores sólo son medianamente conscientes de un "sentido mentado". Sin embargo, a una sociología que quiera ser comprensiva le interesan las acciones con sentido. Comprender significa captar el sentido mentado en un caso individual, el sentido promedio en consideraciones grupales, o el sentido construido según "tipos ideales". Un tipo ideal de acción se construye mediante representaciones del modo como transcurriría la acción en el supuesto de que ella fuera estrictamente racional respecto a fines. Para Weber, "todo tratamiento racional de los últimos elementos de la acción humana con sentido está en principio unido a las categorías de 'medio' y 'fin'". En esto no hace Weber más que aceptar un presupuesto común a las teorías de la acción de su tiempo, utilizado frecuentemente en el ámbito de la economía política.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Con este modelo de acción se consiguen "reglas" prácticas que permiten comprender las acciones reales como desviaciones respecto a los tipos ideales. Naturalmente, la sociología comprensiva sabe que las acciones reales no se realizan según esos tipos ideales. Por eso los sociólogos no se pueden limitar a estudiar únicamente las acciones sociales en sentido estricto. Pero, para Weber, lo específico y constitutivo de la sociología es el estudio de las acciones sociales que, por incluir (aunque sea idealmente) la mención de un sentido, son verdaderas acciones y no meros "comportamientos". De este modo, el carácter hipotético y fragmentario de sus construcciones está compensado por lo que aportan de comprensión. Por eso es preferible a las aproximaciones meramente descriptivas o funcionales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  ?Es esta concepción del vínculo social apta para conceptuar la mundialización de las relaciones sociales? Para Weber, una relación social consiste en un comportamiento recíprocamente orientado según su sentido. No consiste en solidaridad ni en su contrario. Se trata solamente de la posibilidad de que tenga lugar un comportamiento recíproco previsible según un determinado sentido. Por ello no se requiere que todos los implicados en una relación social le den a ésta un mismo sentido. Por ello, participar de una relación social no significaría participar de un mismo universo de sentido. Ciertamente, las acciones socializadas estrictamente tales se diferencian de las acciones sociales en general en que las primeras incluyen expectativas que se fundan en un orden de fines previamente estipulado. Pero no toda acción social tiene que compartir un mismo orden. Esto es útil para nuestro propósito, pues posibilitaría hablar de vinculación social incluso en ámbitos donde conviven culturas heterogéneas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, para Weber no hay relación social sin sentido mentado por un actor. Para que en mis relaciones sociales estén incluidos los otros es necesario que el sentido de mis acciones esté referido a ellos. No basta con una influencia sobre las acciones de los otros, sino que se necesita que haya una relación con sentido. Puede que el sentido que yo dé a mis acciones sea distinto del que le da el otro. Esto basta para que haya acción social. Pero para que haya relación social se requiere que el sentido ajeno forme parte de mis expectativas. De este modo, el sentido que el otro le da a sus acciones, sin ser igual al mío, tiene que estar incluido en el sentido consciente de mi acción. Y esto significa que no hay relaciones sociales sin una mínima comunidad de sentidos accesibles a todos los actores.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  De ahí que sea difícil, desde la teoría de Weber, conceptuar los vínculos sociales mundiales como verdaderas relaciones sociales. Muchos de estos vínculos, por ejemplo de carácter económico o ecológico, no tienen por qué ser conscientes para los actores sociales. Incluso tratándose de vínculos reales y conscientes, no siempre me es accesible el sentido que los otros dan a sus acciones. En este caso, sus reacciones pueden escapar, en alguna medida, a mis expectativas, pero esto no significa necesariamente la ausencia de toda relación social. En el caso de los da?os ecológicos, la realidad de los mismos puede escapar tanto a la conciencia de todos los actores (los causantes y los que sufren los efectos de los mismos), pero esto no niega la existencia de vínculos sociales reales. Ciertamente, Weber no negaría la realidad de tales vínculos, pero no los consideraría como el objeto específico de una sociología comprensiva. Pero, por eso mismo, habría que concluir que la sociología comprensiva no parece proporcionar el instrumental teórico más adecuado para enfrentarse a la realidad de la sociedad mundial emergente.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La idea de un sujeto consciente y mentor de sentido parece limitar el alcance de lo que la sociología comprensiva considera como relación social. En la teoría social contemporánea se ha hablado de G. H. Mead y de é. Durkheim como los autores de un cierto "cambio de paradigma" en el ámbito de la sociología. éstos, a pesar de ser contemporáneos de M. Weber, habrían iniciado la liberación de la teoría social respecto a los presupuestos propios de la filosofía moderna de la conciencia. El vínculo social no se concebiría ya desde los sentidos mentados por un sujeto consciente, sino en términos de interacción o de sistema. Y esto es, al menos en principio, muy importante para nuestro problema, pues justamente estamos tratando de unos vínculos humanos –los vínculos mundiales– que no son necesariamente representaciones de un sujeto consciente.|`|33bb8a1454866446971082d62f81fca9aa	No pienso hacerte tu tarea, gracias...!!!|`|2b5c54fafc76eee7b20a81c1c5bf0a85aa	La sociología interpretativa o comprensiva considera al individuo y su acción como su unidad básica.

Es lo que hemos de estudiar en los próximos apartados.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.2. El interaccionismo simbólico.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Aunque hoy en día es frecuente hablar de "interaccionismo simbólico" para referirse a la escuela de pensamiento social iniciada por George H. Mead, éste entendió su doctrina como un "conductismo social". No se trata de una mera extensión social del conductismo psicológico, pues Mead tiene graves reparos que hacer al conductismo clásico. En primer lugar, el conductista no debería limitarse a estudiar las respuestas de un organismo individual a los estímulos del medio, sino que debería de considerar todo el proceso social de la conducta. En segundo lugar, el conductismo debería explicar por qué las acciones del organismo seleccionan determinados estímulos, determinando así su propio medio. En tercer lugar, tanto el estudio de la conducta social como de la selección de determinados estímulos exige, en el caso del hombre, la atención a su comportamiento simbólicamente orientado, y por tanto también a sus experiencias internas. Entonces, ?por qué hablar de "conductismo social"? Lo que el término "conductismo social" indica es que las experiencias internas y los símbolos se han de analizar desde la conducta social, y no desde la conciencia. A diferencia de Weber, no se parte aquí de los sentidos mentados por un sujeto consciente para entender las acciones sociales, sino que desde el comportamiento social habrá que entender tanto la conciencia como los símbolos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Todo esto presupone una concepción nueva y original de la acción social. La acción no se define para Mead por los fines que el actor social persigue, ni es en ellos donde se ha de encontrar el criterio de su racionalidad. Todo acto, tanto animal como humano, consiste en un impulso que mantiene el proceso vital mediante la selección de ciertos tipos de estímulos, creando así un medio. El estímulo sería la ocasión para la expresión de ese impulso vital. Un acto social sería aquél en el que el estímulo que libera un impulso es un ser vivo que pertenece al propio medio, poniendo en marcha un proceso de cooperación respecto a objetos sociales. Se podría argüir, desde una perspectiva weberiana, que esta definición es adecuada para definir el comportamiento social de los animales, pero que, por ser demasiado amplia, pasa por alto lo más propio de las acciones sociales humanas, que es el estar dotadas de sentido y de la posibilidad de articularse racionalmente respecto a unos fines.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ahora bien, en la concepción de Mead no son los sentidos ni los fines subjetivos los que especifican el comportamiento humano, sino el carácter simbólico de ese comportamiento. El comportamiento animal puede ser concebido como un proceso en el cual los actos de cada uno son estímulos para otros individuos implicados en el mismo proceso social. Los gestos o signos animales no son expresión de emociones, sino elementos organizadores del acto social. En el caso del hombre nos encontramos con unos gestos especiales, dotados de significación. A estos gestos Mead los denomina símbolos. El caso más característico es el de los gestos vocales, propios del lenguaje. Estos símbolos no se definen por su conexión o por su paralelismo con determinadas emociones o ideas, sino por su lugar en el proceso social. De lo contrario no se explicaría por qué un mismo símbolo puede provocar distintas reacciones en distintos individuos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Lo decisivo de los gestos vocales está, según Mead, en que ellos son percibidos tanto por quien los ejecuta como por los otros. En un plano meramente estimúlico, los gestos vocales tenderían a provocar en el ejecutor las mismas reacciones que en los otros. En el caso del ser humano, los símbolos permiten adelantar la reacción de los otros, y por lo tanto ponerse en su lugar. Uno puede interpretar los propios gestos a la luz de las reacciones que se pueden esperar en el otro. Y esto es justamente lo que permite el pensamiento y la reflexión. Y es que en el ser humano hay una reacción demorada a los estímulos que permite considerar distintas posibilidades de respuesta. El símbolo no es otra cosa que un estímulo cuya reacción es dada por anticipado. Por eso, la demora de la reacción es justamente lo que permite insertar, mediante el lenguaje, el proceso social en la propia conducta.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La hominización consiste por tanto en el paso de los meros gestos dotados de un "significado" estimúlico inconsciente a la significación lingüística consciente. Y esto es algo que acontece, no en la subjetividad de un actor aislado, sino en la vida social. En ella cristalizan las significaciones, forjándose símbolos dotados de universalidad. Ahí es también donde las posibles actitudes particulares de los otros toman forma en una actitud o punto de vista que Mead denomina "el otro generalizado". Y ahí es finalmente donde los objetos físicos se convierten en objetos sociales, cuyas reacciones podemos también prever. La conciencia no es, por tanto, algo que está dentro del cerebro, sino un carácter del proceso social humano. El espíritu humano (mind) no es otra cosa que la capacidad de retener las distintas posibilidades de reacción del otro generalizado ante los símbolos. Por ello, el espíritu no es una realidad sustancial anterior al proceso social, sino que se constituye en la matriz empírica de las interacciones sociales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La identidad personal (self) no consiste, por tanto, en la conciencia de una serie de objetos sólo accesibles a un sujeto, sino en la conciencia de sí. Y ésta se adquiere en interacción con los demás. Adoptando los papeles de los otros en el juego y el deporte, el ni?o toma de los otros una serie de actitudes organizadas, que determinan lo que Mead denomina el "mí" (me). El "yo" (I) es la reacción frente a las actitudes de los otros, y dispone siempre por tanto de un margen de imprevisibilidad y de crítica. Ambos componen la persona, que no es por tanto una sustancia, sino un proceso. Como no hay crítica sin una previa conciencia de las reacciones de la comunidad, hay que se?alar una anterioridad de la interacción social frente a la identidad personal. Sin embargo, una vez surgida la persona, ésta hace posible tanto la transformación de los procesos sociales como el que éstos vayan adquiriendo una creciente complejidad.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  De este modo, la acción social, en el caso del hombre, estaría mediada lingüísticamente. Y esto sería lo que permite ponerse en el lugar de los otros y organizar procesos de colaboración respecto a los objetos sociales. Para Mead, las funciones institucionales de la sociedad son posibles en la medida en que los individuos adoptan las actitudes de los demás. La institución social es la reacción común de todos los miembros de la sociedad hacia una situación determinada. Ahora bien, para que haya instituciones sociales comunes se requiere que todos los miembros de la sociedad puedan adoptar conscientemente las actitudes de los demás. Y esto requiere la existencia de símbolos comunes.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El problema, para nosotros, está en que esto entra?a una dificultad a la hora de conceptuar la sociedad mundial. En la perspectiva del interaccionismo simbólico, una sociedad mundial supondría la existencia de símbolos universalmente compartidos que posibilitaran el que las significaciones sociales estuvieran reflejadas en la conciencia de cada uno de los habitantes del planeta. En cierto modo, nos encontramos en la misma situación en que nos había dejado Max Weber. Aunque Mead ha superado su perspectiva subjetivista mostrando que la persona surge en la interacción social, no ha superado la idea de la sociedad como una comunidad consciente de sentido. La interacción lingüísticamente mediada es una interacción consciente que requiere símbolos (y por tanto sentidos) comunes. Y éstos no se dan necesariamente en la sociedad mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ahora bien, Mead era bien consciente de la realidad de lo que él denomina la "internacionalización" de la vida social. Constata que "un proceso de organización se está llevando a cabo por debajo de nuestra experiencia consciente", vinculando entre sí las distintas culturas y civilizaciones. ?Cómo conceptuar entonces estos procesos no conscientes? En la teoría de Mead es posible pensar en el "mí" como una especie de censor freudiano, inculcado por la sociedad, y que pertenece a un ámbito inconsciente. En su virtud se constituirían hábitos de reacción socialmente organizados. Aunque Mead piensa en hábitos comunes, nada impediría pensar en una dependencia funcional entre hábitos que podrían ser distintos entre sí. Sin embargo, esto es insuficiente para pensar una sociedad en los términos del interaccionismo simbólico, porque faltan justamente los símbolos comunes. Para que se constituyan personas en la interacción social Mead entiende que no bastan los hábitos, sino que se necesitan actitudes conscientes. En caso contrario no tendríamos aún una sociedad en sentido pleno y estricto.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La solución adecuada al aparato conceptual de Mead es atender a la constitución de símbolos universales. éstos suponen un nivel elevado de abstracción, pero su contrapartida está en que son accesibles a todos los hombres. Mead piensa concretamente en los símbolos religiosos, lógicos y económicos. Los fundadores religiosos se caracterizan justamente por poner en marcha comunidades más amplias que las fácticamente dadas en virtud de actitudes de buena vecindad generalizadas. Sin embargo, las religiones no alcanzan la universalidad propia del raciocinio. Aislando unas constantes lógicas se podría establecer un proceso social común con cualquier ser racional, incluso con los habitantes del planeta Marte. Ahora bien, tanto la religión como la lógica no constituyen más que símbolos potencialmente universales, pues ellos están simplemente abiertos a cualquier posible interlocutor. El que lo estén a todos es una cuestión fáctica. Los símbolos son un medio para que surjan actividades cooperativas, pero Mead sabe que, de hecho, no ha surgido aún una sociedad en la que la universalidad que encarnan estos símbolos haya recibido su expresión.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ahora bien, en el caso de los símbolos económicos nos encontramos con que éstos responden a procesos sociales que ya en tiempo de Mead adquirían un alcance mundial real. La economía es para Mead el factor socializante más universal de la era moderna. La organización social y económica transciende las fronteras y da lugar progresivamente a un mercado universal. No se trata de una universalidad potencial, sino de un proceso social real. Y no se trata de procesos inconscientes, sino conscientes y simbólicamente mediados. El ponerse en el lugar del otro significa, para el actor económico, identificarse con cualquier posible comprador. La moneda toma entonces el papel del lenguaje como símbolo de riqueza según el cual se miden las actitudes de los otros, de quienes se abstraen todos sus caracteres menos el hecho de estar envueltos en el comercio. Así se adquiere un "otro generalizado" entendido ahora como actor en un mercado mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Cabría pensar que esto posibilita hablar de una "sociedad mundial" como interacción económica mediada simbólicamente por la moneda y el mercado. Sin embargo, para Mead los procesos económicos no son capaces de crear una personalidad estable, y tienden por ello a la desorganización. Una sociedad universal requiere que las significaciones sociales estén reflejadas en las conciencias individuales, lo que supone una serie de valores comunes compartidos por todos los actores. La enorme complejidad social y la diferenciación funcional del comportamiento, determinados por el crecimiento de la actividad económica, no parecen compatibles con este ideal. No es que la diferenciación funcional haga imposible tomar las actitudes de los otros, sin la cual no habría integración social. Pero en el caso de la comunidad económica, la penetración en las actitudes de los demás no es suficiente para alcanzar una integración social verdadera. Y es que la comunidad económica, aunque incluye a todos los posibles socios comerciales en cualquier circunstancia, "representa un todo en el que sería casi imposible que todos penetraran en las actitudes de los otros". Sin embargo, los vínculos económicos mundiales son un hecho, y Mead es consciente de ello. Por eso, en su teoría se introduce un dualismo entre lo que él denomina "comunidad", que puede ser universal, y la "organización social", que se queda dentro de los márgenes de lo socialmente integrable mediante la asunción de las actitudes de los otros en un sistema más completo de símbolos compartidos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, todavía queda otra vía para conceptuar la sociedad mundial, que también sería acorde con la doctrina de Mead. Se trata de que las distintos grupos sociales se asocien entre sí en el plano de la comunidad universal, poniendo en marcha entre las naciones los mismos procesos de interacción simbólica que se han dado entre los individuos. En concreto, Mead ve realizado esta idea en la Sociedad de Naciones. Allí cada nación se encuentra en interacción con las otras y es reconocida por ellas. La nación se torna, en la comunidad mundial, en una persona que recibe su identidad de las otras naciones. Naturalmente, esto supone que en la Sociedad de Naciones se reconocen unos valores y unos símbolos comunes. Mead proyecta así a escala internacional su idea de la interacción simbólicamente mediada. Dado que los individuos difícilmente pueden recibir su identidad de una comunidad mundial en la que apenas hay símbolos compartidos, las naciones toman el papel de los individuos y se convierten en los actores de la interacción mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  No obstante, esta concepción tiene, en primer lugar, la dificultad de que se convierte hegelianamente a las naciones en sujetos personales. En segundo lugar, no es apta para conceptuar otra cosa que las relaciones internacionales, pero no una estricta mundialización. En tercer lugar, estos vínculos internacionales son considerados entonces desde la perspectiva de la creación de identidades comunes, pero no desde la perspectiva de la interacción fáctica en términos de colonialismo, imperialismo o de comercio mundial. En cualquier caso, su concepción del vínculo social exigiría la existencia permanente de símbolos comunes conscientes, ya sea en el plano de las sociedades nacionales o en el de la comunidad internacional de naciones. En este sentido, Mead ha quedado preso del paradigma moderno de la conciencia, por mucho que se?ale que esta conciencia se construye socialmente. La superación de este modelo en nombre de una interdependencia sistémica podría ser un modo de pensar la existencia de vínculos reales incluso allí donde no rige la interacción simbólica consciente. Es lo que hemos de ver a continuación.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.3. La sociología funcional y sistémica.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Cuando se habla de una perspectiva sistémica en la sociología teórica, autores como Durkheim y Parsons son de referencia obligada. Sin embargo, ninguna de las dos concepciones de la socialidad humana parece adecuada para nuestro propósito.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.3.1. émile Durkheim.<br>  <br>  A diferencia de Max Weber, émile Durkheim entiende que las realidades sociales no pueden ser estudiadas desde la perspectiva de los fines que se representan los actores sociales, justamente porque la realidad social es algo independiente de las conciencias individuales. Los fenómenos sociales se han de estudiar "en sí mismos, separados de los sujetos conscientes que se los representan". Con esto Durkheim nos ha sacado del reino de la conciencia individual, pero no necesariamente del reino de la conciencia en general. Veamos por qué.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Los hechos sociales presuponen, para Durkheim, el que distintos individuos hayan "mezclado sus acciones y que esta combinación haya producido algo nuevo". En un organismo las distintas partes dan lugar a propiedades nuevas, que sólo le competen al todo. Un ejemplo es la misma conciencia individual, que para Durkheim no es una sustancia, sino una propiedad del organismo biológico. Lo mismo que sucede también entre el sistema orgánico y la conciencia individual, sucede entre las conciencias individuales y la realidad social. La sociedad, para Durkheim, "no es una simple suma de individuos, sino que el sistema formado por su asociación representa una realidad específica que tiene caracteres propios". Esta realidad específica es una conciencia colectiva, distinta de las conciencias individuales, a las que se impone. La realidad social es para Durkheim, continuador en esto de Hegel y de Wundt, una inmensa conciencia colectiva. En cuanto producto de las conciencias individuales, la conciencia colectiva es una propiedad sistémica. Pero, siendo distinta de las conciencias individuales, que no necesitan tener siempre presentes todos sus contenidos, es accesible a ellas en todo momento, justamente por que se les impone.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ciertamente, Durkheim se?ala frecuentemente que los hechos sociales consisten tanto en representaciones conscientes como en acciones. Sin embargo, su interés principal consiste en mostrar que la sociología tiene un objeto propio, distinto de la biología y de la psicología. Respecto a las acciones humanas, el psicólogo y el biólogo podrían pretender poder estudiarlas exhaustivamente sin necesidad de la sociología. Sin embargo, esto no sucede con la conciencia colectiva, que es para Durkheim una realidad sui generis, independiente de las conciencias individuales. Por eso, cuando tiene que perfilar su tesis, insiste en que la vida social está hecha, "toda ella, de representaciones". Aunque Durkheim hable con frecuencia de "maneras de obrar", o de "maneras de ser", interpreta que éstas, al igual que las maneras de pensar o de sentir, tienen también un carácter psíquico, si bien colectivo y no individual.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  No cabe duda que Durkheim no sólo ha tematizado la sociedad como realidad psíquica, sino también como sistema de acciones: es justamente su análisis sobre la división del trabajo social. Se trata de un fenómeno que tiene una base biológica, y que es ya observable en las sociedades animales. La evolución de las sociedades humanas está en buena medida determinada por el progreso en la división del trabajo social. La evolución social no ha de ser estudiada, según Durkheim, como una necesidad inmanente de la naturaleza humana, sino como un hecho positivo que la sociología ha de conceptuar. Se trata de una progresiva diferenciación social, que va sustituyendo la solidaridad social puramente "mecánica", fundada en semejanzas, por una solidaridad "orgánica", debida a la división del trabajo. Mientras que en las primeras sociedades la solidaridad consiste en la integración de segmentos iguales, en las sociedades más avanzadas la diferenciación funcional conduce a la integración de grupos sociales diversamente especializados, lo que exige formas cada vez más abstractas de solidaridad social.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ahora bien, aunque la división del trabajo desempe?a un papel decisivo en la evolución social, para Durkheim la unidad social no se puede reducir a colaboración. La división del trabajo social sólo puede tener lugar, según Durkheim, entre los miembros de una sociedad ya constituida. Y la constitución de una sociedad no es un fenómeno laboral, sino moral, que tiene su expresión visible en el derecho. Esta unidad moral supone la participación en unas mismas formas de pensar, sentir y obrar. Por ello, lo que garantiza la unidad moral de una sociedad es la participación en una misma conciencia colectiva. Ciertamente, Durkheim es consciente de que el progreso de la diferenciación funcional pone en crisis las formas tradicionales de integración social. Pero al mismo tiempo confía en que la misma división social del trabajo es capaz, por sí misma, de crear nuevos sentimientos de solidaridad. La condición, naturalmente, es que la división del trabajo vaya produciendo al mismo tiempo un derecho y una moral.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Esta prioridad de la cohesión moral representa una dificultad a la hora de conceptuar los vínculos sociales mundiales. Durkheim reconoce que las relaciones económicas sobrepasan las fronteras de los Estados nacionales. Sin embargo, esto no quiere decir que los hombres participen en la misma conciencia colectiva: "los negocios que unen por encima de las fronteras que separan a los pueblos no hacen que no existan estas fronteras". Lo único que es posible, en la concepción de Durkheim, es que la división internacional del trabajo vaya conduciendo a una progresiva fusión de las conciencias colectivas de las distintas sociedades. Esta nueva conciencia colectiva, unida a un derecho mundial, sería lo que en la concepción de Durkheim posibilitaría hablar de sociedad mundial. Obviamente, ni en el tiempo de Durkheim ni en el actual se puede hablar de una fusión semejante. De hecho, los análisis de Durkheim se limitan a los Estados nacionales, pues en ellos sí se puede hablar, por lo común, de una conciencia colectiva y de una verdadera unidad jurídica.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Respecto al futuro, Durkheim entiende que la unidad social de la humanidad, la cual supondría una conciencia colectiva y un sistema único de leyes, representa un ideal muy lejano, dadas las diferencias intelectuales y morales entre los hombres. Lo que le parece posible, y además propio del dinamismo evolutivo del momento, es la unificación de varias sociedades semejantes en una misma sociedad. Sería lo propio de los pueblos europeos, que ya estarían dando lugar a "una sociedad europea que tiene, desde ahora, un cierto sentimiento de sí misma y un comienzo de organización". No está dicho que esta unidad no se pueda extender a todo el mundo. Pero ello supondría, naturalmente, la desaparición de las diversidades intelectuales y morales entre los pueblos. De hecho, Durkheim puede constatar una "expansión cada vez mayor de las sociedades superiores", de la que progresivamente resultaría "la absorción o la eliminación de las sociedades menos avanzadas", con lo que una sociedad mundial sería posible, aunque aún lejana.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En definitiva, la concepción de la unidad social en términos de conciencia colectiva le lleva a Durkheim a pensar la sociedad mundial como un ideal lejano, sólo alcanzable al precio de destruir las diferencias intelectuales y morales entre los hombres. Una sociedad mundial intelectual y moralmente plural no parece posible, justamente porque se ha puesto el vínculo social en el ámbito de la conciencia colectiva. De este modo, la idea de una diferenciación de las acciones sociales queda detenida justamente en el ámbito de la conciencia, donde no cabe diferenciación por tratarse de algo compartido por todos los miembros de la sociedad. Respecto a Mead, tenemos no sólo la constatación de la existencia de vínculos mundiales, sino también una conceptuación de los mismos no en términos de símbolos compartidos (como la moneda), sino en términos de diferenciación por la división social del trabajo. Esto permite pensar vínculos sociales que no se fundan en la igualdad, sino en la diferencia. Pero esta diferenciación no alcanza a la conciencia colectiva. Y ésta es justamente la clave de la concepción de Durkheim de la realidad social.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.3.2. Talcott Parsons.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Para Talcott Parsons, la "conciencia colectiva" de Durkheim representa la realización idealista de un programa inicialmente positivista. La sociedad pasa de ser una realidad concreta a ser una realidad psíquica que sólo existe en las mentes de los individuos. Por esto, en su primera etapa Parsons pretende regresar a la perspectiva weberiana, que él denomina "voluntarista", caracterizada por el análisis concreto de la acción social desde el punto de vista de sus actores. Esto significa poner en un lugar central el problema de los fines que el actor pretende con su acción. Sin embargo, Parsons entiende que la teoría de Weber necesita ser ampliada. Por un lado Parsons reconoce que los actores sociales pueden formar parte de conjuntos sistémicos, aunque se los analice individualmente. Por otra parte, Weber se habría inclinado demasiado al utilitarismo al considerar exclusivamente las acciones desde la perspectiva de su orientación teleológica, cuando una teoría sistemática general de la acción habría de considerar también los factores condicionantes de la acción (herencia y medio), el problema de la energía empleada y, sobre todo, los sistemas de valores últimos, no reducibles al estrecho marco utilitarista de los fines.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la evolución de Parsons va a caracterizarse por un decidido abandono de la perspectiva subjetiva presente en sus primeros escritos. Por un lado, se?ala Parsons, el observador está en ventaja sobre el actor, pues los fenómenos subjetivos solamente son significativos para la ciencia en la medida en que pueden ser analizados por un observador desde una perspectiva objetiva. De hecho, la ciencia no pretende acceder a las realidades en sí mismas, sino crear marcos de referencia teóricos para su comprensión. El actor puede ser entendido entonces como un sistema de acción, ya sea individual o colectivo. Por "sistema" entiende Parsons un conjunto de variables interdependientes en un orden de relaciones con tendencia al automantenimiento. De este modo, en la teoría de Parsons, los sistemas pasan a desempe?ar el papel de sujetos de las acciones sociales. Lo que el autor piensa y siente puede quedar reducido a un sistema de variables, semejantes a las que se usan en las ciencias naturales. Con esto Parsons consumaría la transición desde la perspectiva accional, más subjetiva, a la perspectiva sistémica. El distanciamiento de la perspectiva de los actores se irá aumentando en la medida en que los sistemas realmente percibidos por el actor vayan cediendo lugar a los sistemas construidos por el teórico social con fines analíticos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Parsons puede decir que el objeto de su estudio sigue siendo la acción social. Pero ahora subraya que ella consiste en un proceso de interacción que puede ser considerado como un sistema en orden a su análisis teórico. Este sistema tendría por objeto el análisis de la orientación de cada actor en una situación que incluye otros actores junto con objetos físicos y culturales. De este modo, estudiar la acción social supone, en primer lugar, analizar las motivaciones de los actores. Y para eso hay que acudir a los recursos energéticos y las expectativas de gratificación o privación del actor social. Es lo que Parsons denomina el "sistema de la personalidad". En segundo lugar, estas expectativas se pueden referir también a otros actores individuales o colectivos, y se organizan entonces mediante sistemas de status y de roles, que en último término se apoyan en elementos culturales compartidos. Es el "sistema social". Finalmente, tendríamos el "sistema cultural", que integraría las creencias, símbolos y valores que orientan la acción social. El sistema de la personalidad, el sistema social y el sistema cultural, junto con sus múltiples y complejas relaciones, serían los fundamentos esenciales de todo análisis social.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Parsons le concede una enorme relevancia al sistema cultural. No se trata solamente de una toma de posición polémica contra el conductismo, sino de algo que él considera un momento esencial en todo sistema de acciones. El sistema cultural es el encargado de mantener la integración funcional de todo el sistema, pues "sólo en virtud de la internalización de valores institucionalizados tiene lugar una auténtica integración motivacional de la conducta; sólo así los 'mas profundos' estratos de la motivación quedan pertrechados para el cumplimiento de las expectativas de rol". Por ello, la integración de pautas de valores comunes con la estructura de la personalidad constituye "el fenómeno central de la dinámica de los sistemas sociales". Pero todo esto supone que el sistema cultural es compartido por todos los individuos que actúan en un sistema social determinado. De lo contrario, nunca habría entre ellos un sistema de expectativas recíprocas que se integrase en su sistema personal de motivaciones. Como Parsons mismo subraya, la cultura no es solamente trasmitida y aprendida, sino que "la cultura es compartida".<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Es obvio que, con tal concepción de la integración accional, sólo tendremos sociedades en un sentido pleno allí donde se comparte un sistema cultural común por todos los actores. Es interesante observar que la idea de sistema y el abandono de la perspectiva subjetual no le han conducido a Parsons a un pensar la posibilidad de una real interacción social entre culturas (o subsistemas culturales) diversos. Parsons piensa que, para que haya verdadera integración social, se requiere que todos los actores sociales compartan una mismas pautas culturales. Por eso mismo, Parsons nunca pudo admitir la realidad de un sistema social mundial. Tal sistema solamente existiría en el caso de que todos los individuos compartieran una misma cultura. Ciertamente, puede constatarse en la actualidad un proceso de uniformación cultural o, al menos, la aparición de medios de comunicación y elementos culturales mínimos que cubren casi todo el planeta. Pero de ahí no se puede deducir sin más la realidad de una cultura mundial. No obstante, sin tal cultura, hay de hecho interacciones sociales que son mundiales. Y esto es algo que no parece encajar fácilmente con la teoría de Parsons.<br>  <br>  Todo ello no significa que la realidad de una sociedad mundial no sea pensable desde la perspectiva sistémica. En realidad, probablemente habría que decir que Durkheim y Parsons no han podido conceptuar la sociedad mundial, no por pensar en términos de sistema, sino porque lo han hecho suficientemente. La "conciencia colectiva" o la "cultura" se han mantenido, en sus construcciones teóricas, como elementos compartidos por todos los actores sociales y, por tanto, no funcionalmente diferenciados. Se podría pensar entonces que la sociedad mundial sería pensable en la medida en que se realizara plenamente el programa de la sociología funcional. Es justamente el intento de la teoría de sistemas de Niklas Luhmann.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.3.3. Niklas Luhmann.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Niklas Luhmann entiende que, si la teoría social se encuentra con dificultades para conceptuar la realidad de la sociedad mundial, ello se debe a que tanto los antiguos como los modernos entendieron la sociedad como un conjunto de hombres unidos por una serie de características comunes. A ello habría que a?adir el presupuesto de que estas características comunes se habrían de articular políticamente, de manera que sociedad vendría a ser aquél conjunto humano organizado mediante un determinado Estado nacional. Los límites de una sociedad no serían otros que los límites determinados por las fronteras territoriales de los Estados. Naturalmente, esto se debe a una idea enormemente primitiva de lo social, definido en términos de comunidad y no de diferenciación funcional. Una teoría sistémica de la sociedad que sea verdaderamente coherente con su programa tendría que reconocer que la sociedad actual es una sociedad mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Naturalmente, esto obedece, a los ojos de Luhmann, a una constatación fáctica: las interacciones humanas han adquirido progresivamente un carácter mundial. En concreto, esto significa un crecimiento de los conocimientos sobre la vida y las condiciones de interacción con todos los hombres. No se trata necesariamente de unos conocimientos actuales, pero sí de la posibilidad siempre presente de acceso a los mismos. A esto hay que a?adir el hecho de una ciencia universal insertada en una red de comunicación mundial. Además, hay una opinión pública mundial y unas relaciones económicas globales: los objetivos nacionales se persiguen en un ámbito mundial en función de estado de desarrollo científico y técnico. Por todo ello, aunque permanecen las diferencias culturales y la posibilidad de malentendidos, no se caería ya en situaciones totalmente incomprensibles en las que sería imposible determinar qué es lo que un actor social espera del otro. Naturalmente, esta sociedad mundial no se constituye por contactos elementales "cara a cara" entre todos los miembros de la misma, sino por la posibilidad ilimitada de emprender contactos sucesivos sistémicamente regulados.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Para conceptuar estos hechos se necesita, según Luhmann, de un concepto adecuado de lo que sea un sistema social. Luhmann está de acuerdo con Parsons en su polémica con el conductismo: la acción no se puede definir en términos puramente fisiológicos sino que hay que recurrir con Weber al sentido de la misma. Sin embargo, Parsons no ha funcionalizado el concepto de sentido, de tal manera que sigue pensado el mismo como una propiedad de la acción humana. De ahí que siga pensando el orden social como una serie de estructuras, normas y valores compartidos por todos los miembros de una determinada sociedad. Para Luhmann es necesario definir el concepto de sentido sin referencia a las acciones de un sujeto. Ciertamente, el sentido es una forma de organización de las vivencias humanas, pero el sujeto humano, en cuanto identidad de sentido ya constituida, presupone el concepto mismo de sentido, el cual se presenta siempre en sistemas. Los sistemas de sentido son, por tanto, anteriores al sujeto.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Estos sistemas se han de entender tal como lo hace la moderna cibernética. No basta con decir que el sistema está abierto al medio, sino que hay que conceptuar en qué consiste la relación entre uno y otro. Pues bien, esta relación consiste en una diferencia de complejidad. Un sistema, para conservarse, tiene que mantener una proporción entre su menor complejidad y la complejidad del medio. Y para esto recurre a un aumento de sus capacidades de selección. El sentido, así entendido, sería una estrategia de comportamiento selectivo en condiciones de alta complejidad. Dada una pluralidad incontrolable de posibles vivencias, lo que hace el sentido es crear unidad entre las muchas posibilidades, facilitando la orientación. La selección de un determinado sentido neutraliza determinadas posibilidades sin aniquilarlas definitivamente. éstas permanecen en un horizonte de remisión a nuevas posibilidades, las cuales constituyen el ámbito de toda otra ulterior selección.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Los sistemas sociales, en esta perspectiva, no son sistemas de actores o de acciones, sino sistemas de sentido. Un actor pertenece a un sistema social en la medida en que acepta determinadas expectativas de sentido. Por eso, el dinamismo propio de la vida social no es la acción, sino la comunicación. La comunicación no se ha de concebir como un proceso de trasmisión de contenidos de un sujeto a otro, sino como el proceso selectivo en el que todo sistema social consiste. Se trata fundamentalmente de tres selecciones: la selección de un contenido, la selección del hecho mismo de informar, y la selección que significa aceptarlo. Las acciones sociales se han de entender desde la comunicación de sentido, la cual no siempre requiere del lenguaje. Ciertamente, puede haber también acciones no comunicativas en absoluto, pero su relevancia social sería trasmitida solamente mediante la comunicación. No es que sea falso hablar de los sistemas sociales como sistemas de acción. Pero es unilateral, porque la prioridad corresponde a la comunicación. La comunicación, con sus medios operativos, es la que constituye un sistema social en un sistema de acciones. Por eso, no es que las acciones constituyan los sistemas sociales, sino que, por el contrario, los sistemas sociales se "despliegan" (zerlegen) en acciones.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La sociedad es para Luhmann aquel sistema de sentido que institucionaliza las reducciones más básicas de la complejidad, se?alando el modo en que ésta se puede traducir en vivencias y acciones con sentido. Por eso, los límites de una sociedad no son límites físicos, sino los límites de aquello que puede tener un sentido relevante. Ahora bien, el proceso de diferenciación funcional implica el surgimiento de subsistemas (como derecho, religión, política), cada uno de los cuales logra su identidad a partir de las funciones que desempe?a en el sistema global. La ventaja evolutiva de esta diferenciación reside en que las variaciones de un subsistema no afectan directamente a los demás. El horizonte de posibilidades de los subsistemas se va ampliando y deja de coincidir con los límites de otros sistemas. Por ello, la institucionalización de unos mismos límites sociales para cada uno de los subsistemas se va haciendo problemática. Los límites de lo que tiene sentido para cada subsistema ya no se dejan representar por unas fronteras territoriales trazadas sobre la superficie del planeta. De este modo, la evolución social por diferenciación produce paulatinamente una sociedad mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En esta sociedad mundial, las expectativas recíprocas se articulan más según mecanismos cognitivos que según mecanismos normativos. Mientras que los segundos mantienen las expectativas aun en caso de incumplimiento, los primeros aprenden de las desilusiones a esbozar nuevas expectativas. De este modo, el primado evolutivo se traslada desde la religión, la moral, la política o el derecho a ámbitos nuevos como la economía, la ciencia y la técnica, pues aquí aparecen expectativas de interacción mucho más abiertas al aprendizaje. Estas interacciones tienen por correlato un medio, que en el caso de la sociedad mundial no es otro que el mundo. El mundo no se debe entender aquí al modo fenomenológico, como el correlato de los actos de un sujeto, sino como el correlato de las interacciones. En la medida en que las conexiones de la interacción y los horizontes de vivencias de todos los hombres se hacen de algún modo conscientes, los horizontes de expectativas van tomando una unidad, y la humanidad se unifica no sólo en el ámbito del sistema social, sino también en el mundo. Ahora bien, este mundo pierde concreción y se abre a posibilidades enormemente separadas de los problemas inmediatos del sistema social.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En definitiva, Luhmann ha aplicado la idea de una diferenciación funcional a los sistemas de sentido, posibilitando así la conceptuación de una sociedad mundial. Sin embargo, la teoría de Luhmann no deja de plantear alguna dificultad. Si la sociedad es aquél sistema que institucionaliza las reducciones más básicas de complejidad, habría que determinar cuáles son los límites institucionalizados de la sociedad mundial. Aquí Luhmann reconoce que estos límites son muy abstractos y probablemente no se dejen institucionalizar, de modo que la conciencia de los límites sociales permanece con frecuencia en el ámbito de lo territorial. Cuando en otro contexto ha hablado del modo en que las sociedades complejas determinan sus límites, ha se?alado estrategias como la exclusión de lo sobrenatural, lo milagroso y lo mágico, que más bien caracterizan la evolución de la cultura occidental, pero de ningún modo un carácter propio de toda la sociedad mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Cabría entonces preguntarse si su idea de una institucionalización de los límites no vuelve a introducir subrepticiamente el presupuesto de unos sentidos conscientemente compartidos por todos los miembros de la sociedad. Aunque se subraye que estos límites son enormemente abstractos, de nuevo se estaría exigiendo una comunidad de sentido como condición para pensar la sociedad mundial. Luhmann habla incluso de una integración cognitiva y de la existencia de un mismo horizonte de expectativas. Y es que, aunque ha separado el sentido del sujeto, reconoce que no es posible separar el sentido de la conciencia. Lo que sucede es que esta conciencia no se entiende como un substrato subjetivo de actividades, sino como un vivenciar (Erleben) que puede ser analizado funcionalmente en relación al sentido. La institucionalización de unos límites está unida a su vivencia consciente, y esto parece requerir una comunidad consciente de esos límites. Ciertamente, afirma que en la sociedad mundial no se da tal institucionalización. Pero si Luhmann ha definido la sociedad en términos de institucionalización, tendría al menos que reconocer que, con su instrumental teórico, esta definición sólo se aplica a los vínculos mundiales de un modo derivado.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Esto nos pone en la pista de otra dificultad de la concepción de Luhmann. Cabría pensar que hay acciones que unifican a los hombres con anterioridad a su conciencia. Así, por ejemplo, hay relaciones económicas cuyo alcance mundial puede ser desconocido para muchos de los afectados por las mismas. De hecho, la economía ha sido uno de los factores más poderosos de unificación de la humanidad. Luhmann mismo reconoce esto cuando describe distintos aspectos de la mundialización de la interacción. Sin embargo, a la hora de conceptuar estos vínculos económicos, sólo parecen interesarle los aspectos cognitivos de los mismos. No es extra?o: en la teoría de Luhmann hay una anterioridad explícita del sentido sobre la acción. Las acciones solamente tienen significado social en la medida en que están incluidas en sistemas de comunicación. Aquí parece seguir actuando la idea de acción social de Weber, si bien que liberada del sujeto. Si la comunicación se define por el sentido y el sentido por la conciencia, hay que concluir que la interacción no consciente no es relevante para hablar de una sociedad mundial. Una sociedad mundial será siempre, de algún modo, un sistema de sentido.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En el fondo, Luhmann sigue exigiendo la conciencia de la unificación para que se pueda hablar de ella de un modo estricto. Ahora bien, habría que preguntarse si la unificación no es algo que sucede en ámbitos más radicales que los del sentido o de la conciencia. Es lo que hemos de ver a continuación.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.3.4. Los sistemas mundiales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En este momento se pueden traer a colación teorías como la de la dependencia y la de los sistemas mundiales. Con todas las críticas que desde ellas se quieran hacer al funcionalismo sociológico, nos encontramos aquí también con doctrinas que analizan los vínculos humanos desde la perspectiva sistémica de una "división internacional del trabajo". La novedad estaría en que este vínculo laboral entre los hombres sería más radical que los vínculos conscientes, ya se entiendan éstos al modo de Durkheim, de Parsons o de Luhmann. La más o menos remota inspiración marxista habría posibilitado la idea de un primado de las estructuras económico-laborales. Y estas estructuras habrían adquirido progresivamente un carácter mundial, como ya advirtieron tanto los primeros teóricos del liberalismo como los representantes de la teoría marxista del imperialismo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La teoría de la dependencia, a diferencia de las teorías del imperialismo y de la modernización, tuvo el mérito de sacar las relaciones económicas planetarias del marco "internacional" para situarlas en una perspectiva estrictamente mundial. Esto fue posible en la medida en que se analizaron las economías dependientes como economías "no nacionales" y estudió el papel de las elites locales en términos de su función en el plano de la economía mundial. Sin embargo, la teoría de la dependencia tendió a pensar las alternativas a la dependencia como vías locales o regionales, consistentes en una ruptura del Estado nacional con el mercado capitalista mundial y en el inicio posterior de un desarrollo autocentrado. En cambio, las teorías de los sistemas mundiales mantuvieron una perspectiva más global, subrayando que cualquier terapia tendría que aplicarse en el ámbito del sistema como un todo. Por eso entendieron cualquier realización socialista en el plano nacional como equivocada en su misma raíz. Un Estado socialista, en un sistema mundial regido por criterios de mercado, tendría que funcionar como una empresa capitalista o condenarse a la ineficiencia.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  A la teoría de la dependencia se le ha achacado frecuentemente el fracaso en sus predicciones fundamentales, derivadas de su aplicación de la teoría marxista de la explotación a escala mundial. De hecho, no se ha producido una progresiva depauperización de todos los países dependientes, sino que en algunos casos ha habido enormes cuotas de crecimiento, no basadas precisamente en una ruptura con el mercado capitalista mundial, sino en una hábil inserción en el mismo. La teoría de los sistemas mundiales, justamente por su mayor independencia frente a la teoría marxista de la explotación y por su perspectiva estrictamente mundial, no sólo ha sobrevivido a la crisis del socialismo real, sino que aparecería como un paradigma enormemente adecuado para explicar tanto la crisis del socialismo como la actual mundialización de los vínculos humanos. La teoría de los sistemas mundiales, más que hacer predicciones de futuro, lo que constata es el tránsito histórico de los "minisistemas" a los "imperios mundiales" y de éstos a las "economías mundiales", una de las cuales, la capitalista, se expande a partir del siglo XVI hasta cubrir el mundo entero. Esto no excluye, naturalmente, que muchos de los análisis de aquella teoría estén necesitados de actualización.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Aquí no nos preguntamos por los análisis y predicciones concretas, sino por la capacidad del instrumental teórico utilizado para conceptuar los vínculos sociales mundiales. Y en este aspecto hay que decir que tanto la teoría de la dependencia como la teoría de los sistemas mundiales han operado con un concepto deficiente de sociedad que les impidió hablar de una sociedad mundial. Posiblemente, en el caso de la teoría de la dependencia esta deficiencia estuvo relacionada con el hiato entre los diagnósticos mundiales y las terapias puramente nacionales. En el fondo, se trata de una pervivencia del esquema clásico: se reconoce la existencia de una división del trabajo social que supera las fronteras nacionales, pero se sigue pensando la sociedad en términos de integración en una interacción simbólicamente mediada, en una conciencia colectiva o en una cultura.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Algún prominente teórico de los sistemas mundiales, consciente de que la idea de "sociedad" ha estado tradicionalmente ligada a los límites de un Estado nacional, prefiere renunciar al término y hablar de "sistema mundial" en lugar de "sociedad mundial". La dificultad de esta renuncia está en que los aspectos "culturales" (en el sentido de Parsons) del "sistema" mundial quedan excluidos del análisis teórico, como si los vínculos sociales fueran solamente vínculos laborales y económicos. Incluso si se quiere prescindir de los aspectos culturales, no está claro que los vínculos "materiales" sean simples vínculos laborales. La idea de una "división del trabajo social" está forjada al hilo de la industrialización decimonónica, y no parece apta para dar cuenta de fenómenos como la marginación laboral de amplios grupos humanos. No se trata simplemente de lo que en términos marxistas se podría denominar el "ejército industrial de reserva", destinado a mantener bajo el precio de la mano de obra. El problema se plantea a la hora de conceptuar la exclusión radical de grupos enteros de población a los que diversas limitaciones personales o sociales (incluida la falta de libertad migratoria) convierten en laboralmente irrelevantes para el mercado mundial. Esta exclusión laboral no significa, sin embargo, una falta de vinculación social real, pues también la exclusión (mediante coacción física, por ejemplo) es una forma de vinculación social.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Por otro lado, es posible que, no habiendo sido sometido a una revisión crítica, el término "sociedad" se reintroduzca en una teoría de los sistemas mundiales, pero solamente para designar grupos nacionales particulares. Es el caso de autores como J. M. Tortosa, quien distingue entre dos "sistemas empíricos": el "sistema mundial" y el "sistema social". Siguiendo explícitamente a Parsons, entiende que el sistema social "engloba a una pluralidad de sistemas de la personalidad que forman una colectividad con normas y valores compartidos". El problema de tal distinción es que puede llevar a adscribir determinadas cuestiones ético-políticas (como por ejemplo la democracia) al ámbito del sistema social. Pero este sistema, por su definición, está necesariamente limitado a grupos con valores compartidos. Y esto dificulta entonces el planteamiento de esas mismas cuestiones en plano del sistema mundial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En este contexto, puede ser aleccionador referirnos a la "teoría crítica" de Jürgen Habermas. Este autor ha intentado la superación tanto de una concepción puramente laboral del vínculo social como de una teoría exclusivamente cibernética y sistémica de la sociedad.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.4. La teoría crítica de Habermas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Habermas afirma la necesidad de someter a una "reconstrucción" los conceptos fundamentales del materialismo histórico de Marx. A los ojos de Habermas, hay en las formulaciones clásicas del materialismo histórico un primado unilateral del modelo del trabajo sobre el modelo de la interacción simbólicamente mediada. Ciertamente, esto no se puede decir de todos los estudios empíricos de Marx ni de sus análisis de las ideologías, pero sí de la autocomprensión filosófica de sus propios hallazgos. El dominio laboral de la naturaleza mediante el desarrollo progresivo de las fuerzas productivas sería lo que explicaría tanto la hominización como la evolución histórica de las sociedades humanas. Sin embargo, Habermas subraya que el trabajo social puede explicar el tránsito de los primates a los homínidos, pero no lo propio de la actividad social plenamente humana. Lo propio de la sociedad humana estaría en el hecho de que la diferenciación laboral necesita estructurarse en sistemas de roles sociales, y por tanto requiere una moralización de los motivos de la acción. En realidad, todo avance evolutivo, incluso si está determinado por el subsistema económico, necesita formas de integración social en las que cristalicen las relaciones productivas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Esta reconstrucción del materialismo histórico tiene, para Habermas, la ventaja de poder recuperar las intenciones críticas de Marx, al mostrar que los problemas de integración sistémica repercuten sobre la integración social. En realidad, el proyecto originario de Marx posiblemente no consistía en otra cosa que en someter la lógica desbocada del sistema capitalista a un control normativo. Los recursos normativos, obviamente, no pueden derivar del sistema, sino de lo que Habermas denomina, utilizando un término tomado de la fenomenología, el "mundo de la vida" (Lebenswelt). Se trata del mundo de interacciones simbólicamente mediadas por el lenguaje y la cultura, y que constituiría la fuente de normas y de sentido en una sociedad determinada. La apelación al mundo de la vida serviría entonces no sólo para superar el reduccionismo de la comprensión puramente laboral del vínculo social, sino también para elaborar una crítica del objetivismo de la sociología funcional y sistémica. El mundo de la vida posibilitaría una visión del sistema social desde el punto de vista de los actores envueltos en la interacción simbólica, que es de donde surgen tanto las identidades como los contenidos normativos. Por ello, una reflexión que quiera ser crítica de la sociedad tendría que integrar la perspectiva sistémica con la perspectiva del mundo de la vida.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La interacción simbólicamente mediada ha sido conceptuada por Habermas en términos de acción comunicativa. El comportamiento animal pasa a ser acción social propiamente dicha cuando cobra un carácter lingüístico. El sentido de las acciones, en el que se ha centrado la sociología clásica, no sería separable del lenguaje. El "giro lingüístico" de la filosofía contemporánea marcaría justamente el paso de una consideración subjetiva y conciencial de la acción humana a una consideración decididamente intersubjetiva. Esto significa que los modelos teleológicos, normativos y dramatúrgicos de la acción se han de integrar en el modelo de la acción comunicativa como casos límites de la misma. En la acción comunicativa, los hablantes, desde el horizonte de un mundo de la vida preinterpretado, se refieren conscientemente al mundo objetivo, social y subjetivo, para definir en común una situación cotidiana. La situación es, por así decirlo, el centro de un mundo de la vida, cuyo trasfondo permanece como reserva de obviedades compartidas por los actores sociales. éstas no se reducen a la cultura, sino que las estructuras de la personalidad y el orden institucional son también componentes estructurales de ese mundo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El mundo de la vida es, en este sentido, un componente constitutivo de toda sociedad. Las sociedades no constan sólo de funcionalidad sistémica sino también de integración social en el mundo de la vida, que es donde se constituye la identidad de sus miembros. Por eso, las sociedades humanas pueden ser definidas como "interconexiones de acciones sistémicamente estabilizadas de grupos socialmente integrados". Ahora bien, al mundo de la vida le corresponde una prioridad evolutiva: todo aumento de complejidad en el sistema depende de una diferenciación estructural en el mundo de la vida. Es decir, las diferenciaciones sistémicas tienen que estar ancladas en el mundo de la vida para poder ser institucionalizadas. También el capitalismo moderno necesita de una institucionalización jurídica. Toda novedad evolutiva exige, para ser institucionalizada, que el mundo de la vida haya sido suficientemente racionalizado. Y esto requiere "ante todo que el derecho y la moral hayan alcanzado un estadio evolutivo adecuado", pues en esos ámbitos es donde se regulan los conflictos emergentes.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Para determinar cuáles son estos estadios del desarrollo de la moral y el derecho Habermas recurre a la psicología evolutiva de Piaget y Kohlberg. Así puede distinguir Habermas entre un estadio preconvencional, donde el criterio práctico son las consecuencias negativas de la infracción; un estadio convencional, donde el criterio son las normas y expectativas del grupo; y un estadio postconvencional, donde las normas valen con independencia de la autoridad social. De ellos obtiene una clasificación de las sociedades humanas según el desarrollo alcanzado por su integración social. En las sociedades neolíticas las estructuras del derecho institucionalizado y de la moral vinculante están en un estadio preconvencional. En las primeras civilizaciones se pasa a un estadio convencional, con sistemas jurídicos ligados a la figura del mandatario. En las civilizaciones desarrolladas este vínculo con el mandatario se rompe, constituyéndose un derecho sistemático. Finalmente, en las sociedades actuales se alcanzaría un estadio postconvencional, pues la legalidad y la moralidad se separan, constituyéndose un derecho positivo y una moral ligada a principios.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Todo esto tiene implicaciones para nuestro tema. Habermas no tiene ningún problema en seguir la tesis de Luhmann sobre la existencia de un sistema mundial. Ciertamente, la soberanía de los Estados nacionales se ha vuelto anacrónica, surgiendo formas de organización supranacionales. Esto se debería fundamentalmente a tres factores: el desarrollo de la técnica armamentística, la organización supranacional del capital y la fuerza de trabajo, y la aparición de una opinión pública mundial. Ahora bien, esta mundialización del sistema no es pareja de una correlativa unificación del mundo de la vida. En la opinión de sociólogos como Luhmann, esto no sería problemático: todo lo que Habermas denomina "mundo de la vida" sería concebible como diferenciado en distintos subsistemas, que ya no serían compartidos por todos los miembros de la sociedad. Para Habermas, sin embargo, esta tesis no es válida porque la integración social, que transcurre en el mundo de la vida, es un elemento constitutivo de toda sociedad. Y se trata de una interacción consciente y cotidiana, a la que los modernos medios de comunicación técnicos no pueden sustituir.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Esto significa entonces que de la "sociedad mundial" no se puede hablar más que entre comillas, porque en ella no se realiza más que la dimensión sistémica de toda sociedad, pero no la integración social fundante de identidad. Es el problema que ya nos encontrábamos en Mead y Durkheim. A lo sumo, la sociedad mundial se podría pensar como algo que está todavía en formación (im Entstehen). Pero en sentido propio solamente se podría hablar de una sociedad mundial en el momento en que, además de un sistema mundial, dispusiéramos de unos mecanismos de integración social también mundiales. Naturalmente, estos mecanismos no pueden consistir en la participación en unas mismas imágenes del mundo o en un mismo Estado nacional. La integración social en una sociedad altamente compleja tendría que presentar un carácter postconvencional. Para ello se necesitaría la participación consciente en procesos de comunicación en los que la elaboración de identidad y de normas tiene lugar como un proceso de aprendizaje continuado. Naturalmente, no es ésta la situación del sistema mundial actual, donde, desde una perspectiva evolucionista como la de Habermas, tendríamos una pluralidad de sociedades en niveles de integración social que van prácticamente desde el neolítico hasta las sociedades postconvencionales occidentales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Desde esta perspectiva, la teoría social de Habermas se presenta como una regresión. Habermas, al recurrir a la interacción simbólicamente mediada en el mundo de la vida, vuelve a hacer de los símbolos universalmente compartidos el criterio para determinar cuál es la unidad social. Con esto se sitúa ante el mismo problema ante el que se situaban H. G. Mead y é. Durkheim: la conciencia de la realidad de unos vínculos sociales mundiales está acompa?ada por un concepto de sociedad que circunscribe ésta al ámbito de un universo simbólico, de una conciencia colectiva o de un mundo de la vida. El resultado no es solamente un dualismo insuperable entre acción comunicativa y sistema, sino una teoría social que no es capaz de dar cuenta de vínculos sociales multiculturales, no sólo en el ámbito mundial, sino incluso también en el ámbito nacional. Individuos y pueblos que viven en interacción real son teóricamente situados en sociedades distintas y en estadios evolutivos distintos si sus "mundos de la vida" son diversos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La justificación última de esta regresión al mundo de la vida es, según Habermas, la intención crítica de su teoría. Ahora bien, si de facto los recursos normativos del mundo de la vida se han diferenciado hasta convertirse en meros subsistemas de la sociedad mundial, cabe preguntarse si una crítica eficaz no tiene que comenzar por reconocer este hecho. Además, no se ve por qué una crítica a las innovaciones sistémicas desde el mundo de la vida tiene que tener un carácter "avanzado" y no más bien conservador. Habría que acudir a mundos de la vida postconvencionales, propios sólo de algunas sociedades occidentales, para obtener algún tipo de crítica que, en la concepción de Habermas, pueda considerarse como avanzada. En cualquier caso, dada la escisión entre mundo de la vida y sistema, toda crítica desde cualquier mundo de la vida se haría desde el punto de vista del impacto del sistema sobre una sociedad particular. Habría que esperar a la realidad de un mundo de la vida de alcance mundial para que la crítica pudiera dirigirse al sistema como un todo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3. Conclusiones e hipótesis.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Este recorrido sucinto por distintas versiones de la teoría social contemporánea nos ha puesto ante distintas dificultades que atraviesa todo intento de conceptuar los vínculos sociales mundiales. Aparentemente, la idea de una acción simbólicamente mediada no es apta para pensar la sociedad mundial, pues parece circunscribirse necesariamente a grupos que comparten conscientemente un mismo universo simbólico. En cambio, el modelo de la sociedad como sistema parece más apto para conceptuar la mundialización, en la medida en que permite pensar la unidad de realidades diferentes. Sin embargo, cuando se habla de sistemas de sentido, se mantiene una prioridad de la conciencia en la concepción de la sociedad, en detrimento de la acción social. La idea de una división social del trabajo parece posibilitar una unificación entre el sistema y la acción social, a la vez que nos acerca a pensar la sociedad mundial. El problema está en que, desde esta perspectiva, hay que prescindir no sólo de las dimensiones culturales de la acción humana, sino también de todos aquellos aspectos suyos que no son estrictamente laborales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Conviene observar que, en los autores considerados, sus respectivas concepciones de la acción y de los vínculos sociales no son independientes de ciertos conceptos filosóficos. Así, por ejemplo, la teoría de la acción de Weber presupone la idea del agente social como sujeto mentor de sentido. Las concepciones de la interacción simbólica de Mead no son separables de su enfrentamiento con el pragmatismo. En Durkheim nos encontramos con la idea de conciencia colectiva, que nos remite al espíritu objetivo de Hegel. También en Parsons y en Luhmann aparece de nuevo el primado del sentido y de la conciencia, si bien en una perspectiva funcional. En la teoría de sistemas hay una huella de marxismo o de neomarxismo, mientras que para Habermas es central tanto la idea de "mundo de la vida" como el llamado "giro lingüístico" de la filosofía moderna.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En cualquier caso, parece que los presupuestos filosóficos juegan un papel muy relevante en las distintas concepciones del vínculo social. Y parece también que esos presupuestos filosóficos no son nada ajenos a las dificultades que esas teorías tienen para pensar los vínculos sociales globales. Cada concepción del vínculo social determina el área de aplicación del concepto de sociedad. Si el vínculo social es "sentido", la sociedad se extenderá a sistemas o universos de sentido. Si el vínculo social es "símbolo", la sociedad se extenderá al área de un determinado universo simbólico. Y la concepción de la acción social en términos de sentido, de interacción simbólica, de conciencia, etc. entra?a determinados presupuestos filosóficos como pueden ser la prioridad del sujeto, del lenguaje, de la comunicación o del sistema. De hecho, las mismas ciencias sociales reconocen que un concepto de acción social no lo pueden obtener si no es con el recurso a la filosofía.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Por eso, aunque nuestra referencia a Weber, Mead, Durkheim, Parsons, Luhmann, Wallerstein o Habermas ha sido muy sucinta, y en ella cabrían sin duda matizaciones ulteriores, ello no toca a lo esencial de nuestra investigación. Se trataba solamente de detectar las dificultades que las distintas teorías sociales tienen para pensar los vínculos mundiales, y de observar que estas dificultades están unidas a ciertos conceptos filosóficos capitales. Ahora bien, la filosofía de Xavier Zubiri se caracteriza por una revisión crítica de muchos de los conceptos fundamentales de la filosofía occidental, tanto antigua como moderna.|`|f34161eaed1f941a13d3f17dc709490aaa	No gracias, con los dos puntos me conformo.<br>  Saludos.|`|fc0dbf8a63bc261bc6fd85635287a4dfaa	Hecho aquí te muestro varios links.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://biblioteca.itam.mx/estudios/estudio/letras44/notas2/sec_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://biblioteca.itam.mx/estudios/estud...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uca.edu.sv/facultad/chn/c1170/agtd0102.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uca.edu.sv/facultad/chn/c1170...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ucm.es/info/nomadas/6/lmdonatello.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucm.es/info/nomadas/6/lmdonat...</a><br>  <a href="http://html.rincondelvago.com/economia-y-sociedad_max-weber_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://html.rincondelvago.com/economia-y...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.monografias.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?query=sociologia" rel="nofollow">http://www.monografias.com/cgi-bin/searc...</a><br>  <br>  Saludos :0)
DnsyJWtgaa	bueno, dado a q soy mujer tal ves te pueda ayudar mi respuesta, y es que las mujeres desde peque?as sue?an con casarse dado a que en la sociedad en la que vivimos actualmente y la educacion que nos imparten los padres influye demaciado en la forma de pensar no solamente de las mujeres, sino que de igual manera de los hombres y de la sociedad en geeneral, y esto se debe a que a las mujeres desde peque?as se les ha estado adiestrando a que logren alacanzar su maxima felicidad por medio del matrimonio, esto es gracias a los medios de televicion en los cuales lo unico que fomentan es que las ni?as al ver este medio de comunicacion en el cual al mandar mensajes hacia las peque?as les hacen creer que solamante podrán ser felices si encuentran a su principe azul y serán muchisimo más felices si se lográn casar con este dado que la realidad es otra, pero las mujeres se dejan guiar por estos tipos de medios que solamente mandan mesajes subliminares y fomentan el machismo que existe en n uestro país, eso tambien influye demaciado a que desde peque?as se quieran casar y tener hijos, pero si tu le preguntas a una ni?a que no ve televisión o que sus padres le ense?an a ver la television con critica veras que respondera de manera diferente y no te dira que desea casarse ni mucho menos en los hijos te puedo asegurar que te contestara de manera muy diferente a una ni?a que se la pasa viendo television ya sea sola o en dado caso con su madre, abuela, etc., inclusive esta hasta te dirá como tendria que ser su chico ideal, yo lo he comprobado con varias primas y amigas de mis sobrinas que la television influye demaciado en la forma de pensar de las personas, y mas si estas son aun peque?as y empiezan a descubrir el mundo.<br>  espero te aya servido mi respuesta.<br>  por tu atencion gracias.<br>  atte. paola|`|4d5dcf7631bff7235f65697879bd9610aa	Bueno tal vez porque tu eres de Latinoamérica.<br>  <br>  Pero en Europa cada vez son menos las parejas que desean tener hijos, es por eso que poco a poco hay más ancianos...<br>  <br>  Incluso en México cada vez son más las mujeres que quieren tener una vida sin hijos, porque la verdad si son una carga,....|`|YTHtrp7Zaa	Porque así las educaron les fomentaron el ideal de que la mujer su máximo es casarse y tener hijos|`|d242c69a06284d001db22d40e58a5a7faa	Es el sue?o de toda mujer...|`|ee16cfedfc22026bbb4cfa5b665f9e14aa	Para mi no es que siempre lo he so?ado, solo desde hace un tiempo que deseo mucho eso.

Por lo tanto, interesa de alguna manera tenerlos en propiedad, ley de oferta y demanda, y gana obviamente el mejor postor, esto es, la empresa que mejores condiciones les ofrezca. Si es absurdo o no...pues nos llevaría a un amplio debate sobre el sistema capitalista, a hablar acerca de la justicia ética, del reparto de bienes, y de la generación de riqueza. Lo que es un hecho es que esos personajes ganan lo que ganan porque hacen cosas que no saben o no pueden hacer otros.

Graceland le costó a Elvis 100.000 dólares, para ese momento era mucho dinero, pero nada comparable con las mansiones de los famosos de hoy que cuestan entre 20 y 30 millones de dólares.

Now what you need to hear is that there may be some medication that can be helpful to you.  You also need to hear that valium does not help depression.... it IS a depressant and an anti-anxiety medication.  Psychiatrists are not bad at all.  You need to meet with a psychiatrist to find out if you would benefit from meds and then have them properly presxcribed for you.  You probably would also benefit greatly from counseling.  Look at it this way (and feel free to phrase it this way to your mother).  If you were diagnosed with diabetes, would she be upset with you if you were prescribed insulin?  For people with biochemical causes for depression, it's no different to be prescribed an anti-depressant.  It's not about weakness.  The brain is an organ just like any other organ, and sometimes it just doesn't work the way it should.  Anti-depressants help Mother Nature work a little better with your brain.|`|X39HuK6Vaa	actually consulting a psychiatrist ain't a bad thing at all. taking that medicine might have some effects though, so better be careful. so you got a lot of things going through you're head? just cool down and think of those things one by one, thinking about it all together would just irritate you and you'll go even more crazier..so chill|`|l2qnuSKjaa	well u dont know how to manage ur emotions which is a sign of detachment from ur mother mostly. and u dont know how to be sociall either or mentally so thats also a sign of detachment from ur father, u might even resent them. especially since they obviously seem to be pretty conservative. and talkin to a psychologist is NEVER a sign of weakness. its really a sign of strength no matter wat ANYONE tells u. it means u know theres a problem and ur takin the steps to get better so dont be afraid to try something new. i dont really think takin the valium was a good idea. but i guess, u might as well try since nothing else is. ur mom doesnt like the fact of u changin anything about urself even if u dont like it urself. like i said, im seein conservative views about it and thats why u also seemed closed off to certain things. i suggest, talkin to someone else. someone who knows wat their talkin about and they can help u. friend, psychologist, another adult besides ur family. it might be better for u|`|TjPwxbuJaa	No, psychiatrists are not a bad thing! And since it sounds like your family is really messed up (which is certainly common), it is amazing that you've made it to 18 without seeing a therapist of some kind. Your mother should really wonder why you'd rather talk with a stranger about your troubles rather than her -- perhaps it's because she won't listen and rather threatens you whenever you mention something she doesn't believe in. Unfortunately, one can't choose one's family. But one can move really, really far away.<br>  I have gone to a pschologist in the past. They rely on talk therapy, and do not prescribe medication.

29b23677800eba730683aefd3d0f90a3aa	Xia (c. 2200 - c. 1750 BC)<br>  Not much is known about this first Chinese dynasty -- in fact, it until fairly recently, most historians thought that it was a myth. But the archeological record has proven them wrong, for the most part. What little is known indicates that the Xia had descended from a wide-spread Yellow River valley Neolithic culture known as the Longshan culture, famous for their black-lacquered pottery. Even though no known examples of Xia-era writing survive, they almost certainly had a writing system that was a precursor of the Shang dynasty's "oracle bones."|`|7cd4f58b1baf42675f96eef5de0a618caa	wuon tai me huse|`|1e39d80aed9416997b00dfedf1a9660caa	huang ho|`|67ebafaae42f981c28fee83b9a6c4884aa	In China, the first political state was organized in the North by Shang Dynasty (c 1523 BC ).

These were the areas where signs of early cultivation of rice and millet were first found, dating to 9,000 B.C. by carbon-dating. we just do not know which dynasty it specifically developed into, but it is highly probable that the first Chinese people developed the concept of governance, organized community, written/spoken language, laws, and building of nations along the two said rivers
63fb2fe791f92e434fc9c72fe297f49eaa	It sounds to me like you are worried about pleasing everyone in your life.  While some relationships require more work and attention than others you stress that the other relationships in your life are being neglected.

e8c92fe33a0c75e9ca61a394a1772f35aa	Are the lies she tells about herself or others?  If she lies about herself only, maybe it's to make herself feel better, like maybe she hasn't done in life what she thought she would and so when she's drunk, it comes out in "tall tales." <br>  If, however, she's lying about other people, that could potentially make the person being lied about very unhappy and she could lose some friends over it.  <br>  Have you tried talking to her about it when she's sober?

UdniDRdzaa	Si te convirtieras en una experta en entrevistas de trabajo seria muy mala se?al, seria sintoma de que haces muchas, es decir, sintoma de que no encuentras trabajo. El unico experto en entrevistas de trabajo debiera ser el que las realizay el orientador laboral, no quien va a ser entrevistado. El humilde consejo que te doy es que seas tu misma, que aprendas a relajarte antes de las entrevistas para que puedas explicar con toda naturalidad tu preparacion y experiencia. Existen formas de prepararte para esas entrevistas, y existe literatura al respecto que te aconseja sobre como ir vestida, el lenguaje oral y el lenguaje corporal, la asertividad, la puntualidad, como ir tranquila etc. Es importante tambien que muestres el interes, a traves por ejemplo de informarte previamente sobre la empresa que va a realizarte la entrevista. Es imortante el paso previo de la presentacion del curriculo y en su caso de la carta de presentacion. Hay que saber venderse pero sin incurrir en la vanidad y mucho menos en la mentira. En definitiva hay que saber explicar con la mayor naturalidad posible porque creemos que somos la persona adecuada al puesto.|`|a8f84b4a8eef9a73ecfb311efc192720aa	hola, bueno ante todo debes tratar de no estar nerviosa o tomate alguna pastilla para que te calme los nervios y debes confiar mas en ti misma y demostrar lo que sabes, o has de cuenta que es una evaluación oral, mucha suerte|`|EWXsgKtSaa	Haber, dejemos en claro varias cosas. La primera uno no es experto (no esperto) en entrevistas de trabajo, solo actúa de forma normal y con seguridad frente a los demás. Y segundo si dices que es primera vez que buscas trabajo no sé de dónde puedes tener "tanta" experiencia, teoría a lo mejor, la experiencia se consigue con la práctica, es decir, trabajando. Suerte en tu búsqueda de trabajo, sé un poco mas humilde también hace bien.|`|Gb7fKYFQaa	Hay una pregunta que engloba a todas las demás: ?

a673544ab5bc4ae985a0d2bead185b96aa	In near futur India is not looking to be industrialised. Because the major thing is how much capital nature items are produced. Moreover how much the exports of the country are expanded, In India there is no such a factor else than the software houses and somewat textile sector that it has exports. So I think it will not be able to maximize it per capita income to Us Dollar 10,000 in any way. The other obstacles of  the indian economy is, it is facing the highiest raising population growth  rate that is near about 2.5%,the lowest litracy rate the rigid myths of the people the internal religious wars. The rise in real GDP is near about 3 % per annum and the rise u mentioned per capita income is near about 1330 % so it is not logically acceptable.<br>  <br>  In the case of China Ye it is acceptable that it has started the production of Capital item goods and has a good infrastructure its rate of population growth is strong and it can become a stronger economy yet it will take near about 2 centuries. The major factor supporting the chinies economy is, they have a good skilled labour they have develpoed an the basic infrastructure the population growth rate is very controlled near about 1% and a highier GDP rate that is near about 9 % . So The population of 1.25 billion will take time to increase its per Capita income.|`|iCVxV3fWaa	Never, America will rule and be the best forever! The other country will alwats be behind us.

NpFwtGiuaa	Seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, or just repeating a habit determines our actions.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, a person determines for himself whether or not certain actions are pleasurable or painful based on what he believes. On a social level, if one has a scarcity mentality (not enough to go around), then his actions will most likely be more selfish. If he has an abundance mentality (plenty to go around for all), his actions will most likely be more generous and charitable.<br>  <br>  So, a person with a scarcity mentality will derive pleasure from being self-serving and pain from giving things away. A person with an abundance mentality will derive pleasure from giving things away and pain from withholding.|`|87cc392da3b9c650c4433f8d36af95e9aa	We as humans are basically selfish people.  Think about it..even if a person spends their life helping others..why do they do it?  Because it makes them feel good.|`|973ee8ba83de33eeea6f268566e6736eaa	It's whatever you are focused on I think and for everybody that is something different.
xyIZv6iiaa	With hypnosis, you have a relaxed, focused awareness.  When you're in this relaxed state, you're mind can accept suggestions.  These suggestions can go directly into your mind and take hold so that your thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes are permanently changed.  All action comes from  thought.  Many have found hypnosis to be very helpful - When you think differently, you'll behave differently...and get the results that you want.   I don't think it will work for everybody - we are all wired just a little different and for some people, that letting change into their life is very difficult.<br>  <br>  I was extremely shy as a kid, (hiding under tables shy) and then one day I woke up and just wasn't anymore.  I'm not sure what happened to make it ok for me to be different...|`|CjA02vNMaa	I guess I'm not sure and u'll know when u find urself doing things u normally whouldn't like walking upto people and not be afraid to speak ur mind.|`|YHTJE1Xsaa	Hypnotism works. If you are shy, then tell yourself many times a day, you are not shy and then demonstrate it by telling a story of some kind when you are out among others. Self-esteem has a lot to do with shyness, therefore it takes you to begin to realize that you can tell stories, carry on a conversation if you tried. Just be yourself, others will accept you for being yourself. Give it a try sometime and you will see. Perhaps prepare yourself learning a funny stories or a topic of some kind. People want you to succeed.
SK6MZ66Maa	It's really up to the person. Some people lose sexual interest once they find out a person is treating them like ****.  A part of the sexual attraction is being valued as a person. <br>  <br>  If you're still sexually attracted to the person and don't care if they're treating you as "second best," then go for it. Some people who say "I don't care" end up getting hurt in the end, so be careful. It's not a fun feeling when you just realize that you've been giving your body to someone that didn't deserve it.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Would I carry on sleeping with him?<br>  That depends, if I was only interested in sex, and it was strictly a casual thing and we both were fine with that then yes I would.<br>  If I wanted a relationship then I would look for someone else.<br>  <br>  Why would I lose respect for him if I'm doing the same thing?<br>  <br>  Just becuase you have a safe casual thing going with someone doesn't mean you aren't a person that should be respected.<br>  <br>  See I never understood that. Why do women tie in sex, and love, and respect together too much?<br>  It's just sex, it's just an act it has nothing to do with any of that. I mean I'll give you if you are a whore then you won't get much respect but it's about how you handle yourself and why you are there for the sex that matters.<br>  <br>  Are you still a good person?<br>  Then you still deserve respect.<br>  The only people I don't respect for having sex are younger folks who do it with whomever they see, or people who do it for money. But when I see a mature man or woman doing it then by all means have fun as long as you are being responsable about your fun.<br>  <br>  I don't understand how having a F*ck buddy causes you to lose your dignity. You are an adult, so there is nothing wrong with having some fun.<br>  <br>  -Connor
pWlVHm6kaa	It's probably more that she's coming down from the mania and she's starting to feel worse and worse. Being physically ill, from a reaction to the meds or whatever, is a socially acceptable reason for feeling worse. She's probably fooled people with similar stories for years to get some kind of attention, sympathy, and understanding of what it's like for her to feel so good and then start to feel worse than lousy.<br>  <br>  I knew someone who use to fake cancer because of bipolar disorder. Actually, she faked a lot of other illnesses too. She told the most outlandish lies. The thing is, she thought she really could fool people. Like we wouldn't notice she didn't die from the cancer that kills 100% of people within 6 months?  <br>  <br>  And come to think of it, my late husband use to be sick a lot. But he was never *just* sick with a cold. It was always the worst symptoms. We could all have the same thing and his would put him in bed for 6 weeks longer than the couple of days the rest of us were sick.<br>  <br>  I wonder what would happen if, when your mom called with this story, you said, "I'm going to hang up and call your nurse to come help you." Would her tongue magically un-swell?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps... I think you made me think more than I could ever answer your question but I'm going to go ahead and send this anyway... if only as a show of support. I hope your mom is better soon.<br>  |`|AA11850523	you poor child<br>  I dont have a answer for you <br>  <br>  but here's a hug for you |`|4fuXjc83aa	Hire Parkman and make her talk the truth.|`|to3gyy3uaa	mania MAY cause a need for attention, as her brain is racing most of the time. However, bipolar isnt know to cause munchausens, but patients with munchausens are known to feign bipolar disorder. Has ur mom been properly diagnosed with bipolar disorder? When people with Munchausens feel as if they are being ignored, they will go to drastic meaures to harm themselves. Keep an eye on her. Also, Check into ur moms history. Has her parents or close friends or siblings ever been severely hospitalized to the point that it seemed that they were getting all the attention and love, not ur mom. THis lack of attention from others because of another's illness is a leading phychological factor for munchausens. good luck with her. <br>  <br>  btw, i love the show heroes. =]|`|y58ZfVV7aa	The bi-polarity may be the cause of the sudden need for attention.  I don't usually see that type of behavior on the manic side of things but rather on the depressive side.  I have a friend who suffers from this but only when she's in a depressive state.  Luckily it has been happening less and less thanks to the medication she is on.  <br>  <br>  Is she presently on any type of medication to keep the ups and down even keel?  If so, the dosage may need to be looked at.  Was she officially diagnosed as having bi-polar disorder or borderline personality, if so, the doctor who diagnosed her should discuss the level and types of medication that can help.  Just a suggestion.  <br>  <br>  If your mom isn't all that keen on the idea of taking medication, then you need to discuss how her behavior affects you.  Maybe it'll be enough for her to take the steps necessary in getting things in control.  She'll be happier, be able to focus on the important things.

ZswVbKL6aa	Io vedo l'extracomunitario come un pericolo solo se non si è in grado di attuare un'integrazione fatta bene.<br>  Questo porta gli immigrati a isolarsi tra loro, a non ritenere l'Italia un paese che vuole dargli una mano nel costruirsi una nuova vita in un nuovo paese.<br>  <br>  Ho conosiuto persone che facevano mestieri particolari e che richiedono molta esperienza e una volta arrivati in Italia spingono un carretto della frutta, fanno i muratori o peggio vengono sfruttati dai tanti "feudatari" italiani... che li trattano come schiavi (3€ l'ora, raccogliere pomodori, dormire in una baracca, prendersi insulti a gratis, essere abbandonati in caso di infortunio.)<br>  <br>  Quindi si, vedo l'extracomunitario come un pericolo... perchè se fossi io emigrato in una terra così ostile e ignorante adesso probabilmente sarei a fare rapine in villa e a ustionare i ricchi industriali della bassa con un ferro da stiro acceso.... aggiungeteci che se ti beccano non succede un granchè... siamo il posto perfetto per chi vuole delinquere... e un incubo per chi vuole vivere con rispetto e umiltà, cercando di fare il balzo sociale.<br>  <br>  Provo un rispetto immenso per chi riesce a vincere il pregiudizio e a diventare un paio di braccia in più utili per l'Italia....<br>  <br>  <br>  A chi dice: rubano il lavoro ai giovani... rispondo che probabilmente penseranno che gli italiani sono tutti uguali, che tirare il pacco sia consuetudine... cosa ci rubano? vuoi fare il muratore in nero? il magazziniere a tempo determinato in un grande magazzino? part time e per 600€  al mese?<br>  vuoi andare a raccogliere frutta per 3€ l'ora?<br>  <br>  quella è gente che lavora per mangiare... il porco è chi li assume in nero, rubando dalle tasche di noi tutti... e quelli sono tutti italianissimi e bon ton.<br>  <br>  In ogni caso il tono delle risposte dimostra che l'Italia è culturalmente arretrata rispetto al resto d'europa... dove gli immigrati si integrano molto più facilmente (vedi: Francia, Olanda, Spagna)|`|4e7kKBeCaa	no l extracomunitario non e un pericolo per UE, non e un pericolo per italia.delicuenti si.|`|6eVa1z1iaa	Assolutamente come arricchimento della società.<br>  Poi è chiaro che non si può generalizzare|`|ahk2KqBAaa	può essere entrambe le cose..<br>  ma dai,nn prendiamoci in giro..<br>  dovè che l'africano musulmano ci arricchirebbe??<br>  sapete che la maggior parte dei dittatori africani hanno studiato in europa?<br>  o che qndo 1 viene qui nella nostra società e si arricchisce poi torna nel suo paese e 1 volta che noi lo abbiamo arricchito lui si compra 1 altra moglie come"status simbol"? <br>  quindi..|`|CIMOCgE0aa	io vedo l'extracomunitario come pericolo, xk porta via il lavoro ai nuovi giovani!!|`|PCESyO7Caa	80%-20%|`|S6zUFy5Paa	io non  sono contro... ma almeno potrebbero 1 po adattarsi alla nostra civiltà, a l nostro modo di vivere...|`|hBXoncCzaa	L'extracomunitario:<br>  <br>  Ovviamente è un termine molto generico; in quanto abitanti dell'Italia dovremmo considerarci facenti parte dell'Unione Europea ma siccome qui sono popolari più che in altri stati i conservatori e i "no global" ed essendouno stato con molte frontiere (fisiche) aperte verso zone meno sviluppate ci sarebbe da discuterci un po'.<br>  Comunque in poche parole non posso che definire la maggior parte di loro una ricchezza.

GGezSEKwaa	si!! è il dejavu!!!!!<br>  una possibile ipotesi generale (di basso livello interpretativo o inferenziale) sembra essere quella di una sensazione di familiarità (e quindi: "già visto") falsa, e cioè dovuta ad una alterazione (patologica o momentanea; selettiva o pervasiva) delle funzioni cognitive di riconoscimento (attenzione) e recupero (memoria). Questo senso di familiarità, ad alto valore emotivo, si può estendere (pervasivamente) a tutti gli elementi presenti in quel momento nell'ambiente percepibile, anche se nuovi. Altresì potrebbero rimanere normali (selettivamente) altre funzioni cognitive: da ciò proverrebbe, ad esempio, la consapevolezza per cui "ma no, non è vero: non l'ho già vissuto" che in molti casi si prova, in discordanza con la sensazione.<br>  qui trovi ttt spiegato!!|`|2270545e500c2afc2a27344f2dcca28eaa	Ecco cosa succede a me.

BhumxInEaa	Disaster.<br>  <br>  In theory, if they would increase tariffs just enough to offset subsidies by the developed countries, particularly in agriculture, it would be great.<br>  <br>  But experience suggests that they will not do anything so virtuous. Instead politically connected industries will get the sort of protection they want to avoid competition. (Remember, capitalists don't want to compete, they want to become monopolists. It is the free market that is supposed to force them to compete.)<br>  <br>  With that sort of protection, the economy of the developing countries will be stifled.<br>  <br>  Some people will point to the success of Japan and South Korea as exceptions. But looking at the Japanese economy it is clear that it is only the export sector, the sector that competes on the world market, that has been highly developed. Those sectors protected by tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers have not developed anywhere near as quickly as the export sector.

Xcri5qeTaa	That's true, but scent, of course, is not the only factor in attraction. If scent didn't matter, we wouldn't be using cologne and perfume, lol. Aromatherapy, using mostly scented oils and candles, works because people have fairly similar responses to different scents.    We can inhale the chemicals without thinking about what we're smelling, but we adjust to scent over time. For example, if you leave your house, and come back later, it smells like home. But after a short time, you can't really smell that scent.    Scents can be subtle enough that they don't get our conscious attention, similar to hearing noises around you but not really focusing on them. If you live near traffic, for example, you hear the cars without thinking about them, and probably pay attention when there is an unusual sound, or no sound at all.    Scent can also trigger emotional and physical response, and can be associated with specific memories and emotions.|`|AA11530601	yeah they are pheromones and they can be  picked up on in an unconscious way, we dont always know we are smelling them. But sometimes we do.

I have been truly in love twice in my life and I recognised their personal scents as if I had known them all of my life.  I was very aware of it, as was my ex-husband.

But that scent doesn't make make others be attracted to you. that's when looks, personality, etc. comes in.    you cannot smell that scent.|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	yeah, im like that with my bf. lol. he has this natural scent that drives me mental! its not a BO, its just hes natural scent. crazy isnt it?:)|`|DoooQw77aa	A study has been done in evolutionary psychology that showed that the sense of smell could have more to do with mate choice than previously believed. It is called the "Sweaty T-Shirt Experiment". The study showed that "Females sniffing the T-shirts recently worn by males favored the scent of those whose immune response genes were different from their own" (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/librar...

Wb1ydezNaa	for the past year I have had the same dream,about every other month.go figure it would be about my biggest fear,spiders.always the same cenerio,wake up in a room full of dangling spiders from the ceiling,my mom killing the small spiders but there's one huge one in the hallway the she cant kill,so I end up trapped in the room.If you can remember your dreams and think about what occured in them,you usually can find the answer.usually your afraid or running from something,could be something that's been bothering you but you cannot talk about,either way,your sure to find something that's going on in your life that relates to the dream and sometimes will have the same dream over and over again,it's your sub concience.there's websites that can further explain and help you more.|`|AA11552331	Hi there<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your recurring nightmares as they are really unpleasant. There a number of possible explanations for this. One possible explanation is medication if you are taking any. Different kinds of medication can induce nightmares unfortunately. Secondly If the nightmares are about the same situation or peoples all the time it may be that you are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which is caused through some type of traumatic event where by you continually have thoughts of or dreams and flashbacks about the event.The final explanation I can offer is that you have a pending or current situation that is worrying you or that you are concerned about. Either way nightmares are very unpleasant and if they persist consult with your doctor for a referal to a psychologist.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|w4HkJujcaa	Thinking about something too much, being preoccupied with it, something that is bothering you, maybe eating or drinking something too much before you go to sleep, an unresolved problem, something you have not dealt with and need to talk to someone about or a need for counseling, also could be a warning|`|Kzs2T1TIaa	wish i know. i have one nearly every night since i was about 12.|`|FJq9GWMKaa	Well, there are nightmares and night terrors nightmares usually occur a few hours into your sleep where as night terrors happen during the 1st hour or 2 of sleep. Dreams of any kind usually occur as a result of some unfinished business you had that day or even week or your life. What you can try to get rid of them is talk about it to someone, write it out, write about how you feel when you wake up from it etc. Nightmares are usually a result of stress or a loss of someone close or a traumatic event. The best thing to do is to write it all down as much as you can remember and get it out of your head so that you don't spend the rest of the night or day thinking about it. |`|IJMDRuG1aa	well, if ur trying not to have nightmares then make sure u don't watch any scary movies and don't eat any real sugary or spicy things before u go 2 bed! |`|yuOuoCfDaa	you probably keep entertaining the same dreadful situation and you can't stand it so you dream bad dreams|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Recurring nightmares usually reflect something that's going on in your life that is  unresolved or problematic.  <br>  <br>  Dreams are symbolic and not literal translations of what's happening in your life.<br>  <br>

Attraction is appearance, and unfortunately, many people take it too seriously.  However, to answer the question directly, no.  It shouldn't matter how often guys ask you out, for this very simple reason:  not all guys just ask.  There are TONS of guys who are too shy.  Now, to answer your question indirectly, being physically attractive shouldn't be everything.  Everybody, rather they admit it or not, is in one way or another, affected by how their potentional future-lover looks.  But if a guy gets to know a girl before he sees her, it's a whole new ball park.|`|rFQH1vAfaa	In some cases yes. If a person is good looking then people will be physically attracted to them and would want to get to know them better. If the face is ugly, then they would have to dig deeper to find the nice personality inside. Being pretty does give you more options for dating, because everyone wants a hot date. But don't let the number of dates you get define you.. it could be for the best, just wait until the right person comes along.|`|hnZa0mz5aa	No, Everyone always compliments that I'm pretty and blah blah blah but I never get asked out. It's rare for a guy to ask me out. The last time a guy asked me out was in February. That was nine months ago. Me and him obviously did not last long, so if you think about it I've been single where no guy has asked me out for about seven months and three weeks.|`|YUY49qWlaa	Whoever said "it's all about personality" IS BULL. Because something has to catch your eye. That is the FIRST thing you notice when you meet someone. But if you've known them for a while their personality attracts you in some way. So I guess it's a little bit of both.<br>  <br>  wow I didn't answer the question. Lol Well no it shouldn't. Don't quote me, but one of my guy friends told me that some men don't approach women "out of their league" because they are intimidating.<br>  <br>  I personally think it doesn't matter how many times you get hit on.

Her friend doesn't I don't know why.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Of course not. Women who ARE very attractive, have guys "ask them out" mainly because the guy wants to get laid. Women who aren't society's version of beautiful, have it better, because people tend to see them for who they are, not just being judged by their looks. Being "hot" is not all that it is cracked up to be.|`|gSwobfujaa	im going to say no. i have seen beautiful women not get asked out because of their terrible personalities. i have seen beastly women get asked out or be out with their hot boyfriends simply because they are confident and proud of who they are no matter what they look like. ive seen some fugly women with some sexy guys and i wonder. but hey...shes doin her thing. <br>  <br>  i am attractive, i get compliments. 1-10 i give myself a modest 8. sometimes i get asked out sometimes i dont. i dont ask men out for dates...but whenever id flirt-theyd flirt back. but i always attached it to my confience level. i also understand im dealing with a creature who thinks with his peepee. ;-)|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	No because you can still be unattractive and still get asked out.

5Yh8WN1Oaa	I went through something similar. I wasn't raped, but it was an attempted rape. It's best to come right out and tell them. Maybe meeting at a counselor or pastor's office could help. In my case, I told my family pieces at a time. <br>  <br>  Did you go to the police about this?  If not, it's best if you do, that way he won't go do the same thing to someone else.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for what you went through, but it it possible to heal from this. If you ever need to talk, feel free to e-mail.<br>  <br>  Edit: Even if you don't know his last name, it's best to make a report with the police. That way, if you eventually do find out who he is, you can let them know. Why are you afraid of telling?<br>  <br>  Edit #2: If you just want her to know, then go somewhere with her in private and start by saying you have something to tell her, but you want it to be just between her and you. I'm sure she'll understand and keep it private. There's nothing to be afraid of. She's your mom and I'm sure she will understand.|`|ThE5yYqaaa	OK the first thing you need to do is get a pregnancy test!!! then tell your parents because they will not be angry with you.. trust me being raped is not something that classifies a person as "weak"<br>  then get yourself tested for any STD's because you don't know what this boy may or may not have contracted..<br>  and from there (if your parents have not yet suggested it) you need to inform the police and do your best to trace him... if you thought he was your friend then you must have pictures/a detailed description of him/first name u can give to the cops to help them identify him... seriously you need to tell someone... don't feel "stuck" and don't feel like you "can't" you CAN! and you have to or this will never be resolved!! don't you want that creep to be caught? i think so!<br>  <br>  good luck hun! i'm really sorry to hear that!<br>  i hope everything works out ok!|`|SCeIOtZpaa	I don't think your family will think you are weak at all!  They will probably be really upset and angry with the boy that did this to you.  You need to report him, what if he does this to someone else?  You really should let your family in so they can support you while you are going through this.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	if your too afraid to say it, write your mom a letter.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Tell your family and the cops everything you know, and let them figure out the rest.<br>  <br>  Get tested for pregnancy and STD's ASAP!|`|Uiu9Af3Aaa	sooner or later they will find out   so why not tell them now....... they wont think you are weak they will support you|`|PjF1t9Xoaa	call the cops!!!|`|pKD9XcPwaa	that really makes me mad, id have someone smash that fool.|`|fTpk7ospaa	you might be scared to tell someone but i think it will help you the most. The best person to tell is the person you trust the most in the entire world. If you think you are pregnant you should definatley tell someone.<br>  i hope i could help|`|bFOwx40saa	Tell your mom my mom always talks to me about anything but you cannot keep quiet.Your not weak.He is sick and you cant let this go or he could do this to another girl.You have to be strong and have that sick bastard put in jail.Im so sorry what happened  but you have to be strong
AA10719402	I think private developers and contractors as well as city planning would be a good place.    Private developers are out there.  I live in Dallas and there are quite a few.  I think they would mostly research the viability of an area and research demographics and taxes for a construction project.      The urban thing always interested me because of the re-emergence of urban planning.  There are some neat things being tried in certain cities.  "Walkable urbanism" is the next greatest thing according to some.    I always wanted to apply there but then I got pregnant:)  Guess I'l have to wait on that.
8O4ttgGMaa	maybe its just your brain playing out people you've seen on the street before. I dream about people I've never seen or met before, its weird. But they're too real to not have existed. Brains are weird. Dreams are weirder.|`|1TrWuMOraa	That's really odd. I don't know what kinds of things you believe in or what you think is complete BS but maybe you knew them in your last life? lol Crazy though, maybe you will meet them in your future?|`|tLEjpEaraa	may be its coz you wanna to know more about your friend? why you dream with her all this years?|`|rDsKB0uXaa	its normal
9CN0ZvAVaa	This is a difficult thing to do yourself. You need someone on the outside looking into the relationship in order to analyze it correctly and figure out his true feelings. Our mind usually tells what we want to believe, whether it is true or not. So if you want him to be sincere and true, you will believe so, even if he isn't. Ask a *good* friend what they think. Don't make excuses for his actions. Be aware, alert, and smart. Also be aware of his actions, you don't need to snoop around but make sure you begin the relationship as a friend and build into it. Also, take a look at how it treats others--his guy friends, girl friends, parents, strangers, etc...|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	There's no quick way.    But on thing to consider is, not only how they treat YOU, and act toward YOU, but pay attention to how they act toward, and speak of, others. And how they deal with things and situations. (For instance, is the whole world, or other people, always at fault for everything? There's a red flag.)    Don't invest too much too fast; it takes TIME to get to know who a person really is.    I know, easier said than done.    Dating is so artificial. Do other things together. Hang out their friends, and with your friends with them. Thus, you see them with others; you see what kind of people they surround themselves with.|`|B4SF8sPraa	i am an honest person that only attempts relationships with people he feels he can connect with.. so most guys arent... you could try pissing him off? or just making it kinda inconvenient on him for a bit see how he acts,..|`|AA11530601	when you enter a relationship, there is always the risk you could get your heart broken. And sorry but you have to either accept that or not date. If hes willing to date for months without sex then Id say hes decent. A certain type of guy that is becoming increasingly common (id say about 1 out of 3) expects sex on the 1st date. They simply dont understand why a woman would want to say no, its fun for them and they dont understand that it may not be fun for her until she feels something for him emotionally. I guess its the media which makes women look like hot horny little minxes all the time, gives the impression we love meaningless sex, when most dont.|`|FxAD44Moaa	lmfao.. no such thing.        just don't attract it.        that's how i learned.. of course that was through watching others. apparently i learned well.      (so far...  but there's always room for that education and being ripped a new one.)      simple things:      if it's too good to be true.. it usually is.    if there's some quirk they have that gives you that 'feeling'....    one moment they're gods gift to you then they treat someone familiar like crap or that familiar person is distant or treats them differently, unfavorably.    many things i could suggest, point out.. but patience, observation and simple gut instincts.. will help.|`|AA11809403	i don't know a quick way.    sometimes, seeing how he treats his mother, how he treats waitresses and other staff people can tell you a lot.|`|hqbd94Otaa	There is no quick way.  You just have to be smarter and more mindful in your decisions when it comes to choosing a man. Don't go into it thinking "He could be the one". You have to let that happen naturally. But if you notice the new guy has some of the same qualities or traits as previous guys then maybe you are falling into a pattern that you didn't realize you were doing before.  Recognize the pattern and run for it. There is not need to keep going down the same road with different guys. And keep  in mind that you can be with someone for years and never know who they truly are. People change. Consider the middle-aged married woman with children who's been married for 20-something years who suddenly finds herself getting a divorce from her gay husband. Didn't see that coming did you? You just have to pay attention and not make up excuses for bad/strange/weird/unacceptable behavior.
NZrjvKWjaa	You again start pulling cow tail.    Answer is Yes,    Do hard work, if you want to win the race.     Herbert Spencer's shorthands of  Charles Darwin theory     "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"    currently you asking all those question, later your future    DO HARD WORK TO WIN THIS RACE      "That's the kid's point of view . grow up to understand the world order better . It's RAHUL GANDHI who will probably understand what hardworks means to become the gen secy of the grand old Congress Part of India .   You people want to eat the cake and have it too. Your chance of sermoning others of your age will come if you survive ."    I am watching this world, even better than you, A stronger person always rule over weaker person. Like Mayawati, she own over 600 crore property and yet asking for donation from people in UP. If the person(Enggineer) rejected to give donation, he was beaten up by Mayawati's gundas to death. Ask your question to b*tch(Mayawati) so called BC/OBC Leader. She want people like you to win the election.    RAHUL GANDHI is the only successor of Gandhi family in Congress party. he was elected by the people and congress party members not Mayawati's gundas.|`|AA12316366	in every period in history there have been wars and conflicts regardless of race or ethnicity so i would have to say no. look at the vikings they were the most warlike people of that period and now Scandinavia is probably the most peace loving area in the world|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I have heard whites called that but in my opinion all races of humans are marshal or warlike.  It seems to be fairly universal.|`|1760OdxNaa	Could you rewrite this question in comprehensible English?    Are you asking if there is a separate "martial" not marshal race thats 5000 years old? Who are they? Do you mean there?    What on earth are you asking about anyway?|`|2BmGwbvYaa	There is no extablished race that is smarter than one another. Skin coulour and the shape of ones eyes have no effect on our mental capacity and should not be a sign of stupidity or superiority.|`|0bQKmqZ6aa	In Oriya culture there is a saying: Aaji je rajendra aasane, kali se fakir. Translated it means that today who is in the throne ruling the world he can easily become a beggar by next year.|`|5882b5beb2f0e6ceb6a08915f56ae6b3aa	No. If man evolved, he came along in different areas of the planet. In other words, I don't think man evolved from one race to another,but each race evolved as it's own at an equal general pace.
chfILbonaa	Lack of sleep as the person above me said If you stayup all night for a few days or longer yo will sot likely get hallucinations and also hunger will do it|`|hg8ExtsNaa	ex wives or in laws|`|9By6qSSYaa	A lack of sleep. I stayed awake for two days, and I began seeing things that weren't real. <br>  But it's a hellish feeling, not a euphoric one.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Sensual deprivation, sleep deprivation, being emotionally overwrought in the extreme, or combinations of these.|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Severe lack of sleep is one example that comes to mind.  <br>  <br>  Oh and I have heard of people going crazy due to hunger/thirst/heat.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Lack of sleep, being insane, tricking yourself into believing your seeing things, etc.|`|T7Mq6ZN8aa	Seems obvious, but a hot desert without water can bring forth hallucinations.
deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	It's an investment in the future economic well-being of the country -- assuming it's done well.    Teaching reading-readiness, even reading; exposing them to other languages; counting; exposing them to strong vocabularies and correct grammar; giving them opportunities to play with and socilaize with their peers -- these re all good things.    They'll be able to do better in school, and end up better-prepared for adult-hood.|`|B4SF8sPraa	education under five is pointless and is just another way to piss away government funds ...i didn't go to preschool and i am greatly above average in intelligence everyone is fine without this
6NFQ3pylaa	Hello bug squishing fetish guy. Have any more fantasies about women squishing bugs? You did? Ya don't say.|`|BMIW36XFaa	Nothing...just tell him he's the same size as his own kind...a rat.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Doesn't matter what you said or did to him , he'd still dump you anyway.|`|eibO5ax3aa	He's not worth my breath or worthy of any action on my part. So, I guess the answer would be absolutely nothing.|`|cbsAZVNQaa	this person asking this is a guy with a giantess fetish..One of the strangest fetishes ever because it can't actually ever happen in real life.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	And the kick it up... its going... going... and it's GOOD.|`|OUwyHduraa	I wouldn't do anything...either that, or help him out. Because even if he's my ex, he's still a good friend of mine, and I need to be mature.|`|lcGriJXiaa	I'd say, "What happened to you?"   Then offer him some stilts.
2UnjeOQUaa	Practice in your free time. We only fear what we don't know. So get to know your writing better and the fear will be gone.|`|vYUg3oWZaa	Your overly self-conscious. Like i used to be. In class i knew the answers but i just would not put my hand up. I was friends with everyone in my class. I acted silly, cracked jocks laughed shamefully. But when it came to me putting up my hand i would just role up and try to hide in my mind. And when it came to the teacher picking randomly i would ask to go to the bathroom or hide behind someone. i still have this problem. it's not as bad though. I learned some things and i started to analise myself and try to put into practice the things i've learned and it is working. Slowly but surely. Try to assess yourself. I can't really say for sure what your prob is cause i'm not a doctor but i know it has something to do with self-consciousness|`|4Coww7VSaa	smoke cigarettes
ZHaOs3B3aa	well i have similar dreams like that. im married (happily married). but i still have dreams of past bf's. in my dreams i am usually walking around and all of a sudden i see one of my ex's. hes just there, quiet, looking, smiles and they runs. i always call out to him and am sad, because its been years and i wanted to see how hes doing. i dont think having dreams about past lovers means u want to be with them, it means they had such a impact on your life that they will always be a part of your soul, or what ever u believe. in life u just meet ppl that u just feel so spiritually connected to. like u have met them before, kinda like u met them in a previous life. i know it sounds kinda nutty. but thats how i feel about two of my exs. i dont love them or want them anymore. i just would like to visit to see how they have been doing these past 5 years. ya know?  i do love my husband very much, i feel like he is the person im supposed to be with. so my dreams are not like " oh i wish i could be with them or man what would it be like now if we were together" .hope this helps
