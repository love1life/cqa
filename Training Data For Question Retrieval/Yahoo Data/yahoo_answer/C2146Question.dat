Once you've registered a card on Amazon and use it to spend, when you return and want to use the same card again for another order it never asks for your CVV number (the last 3 digits on the back of your credit card). Does anyone know if Amazon is storing this?       If they are, isn't that against PCIDSS regulations? If not, how are they carrying out the authorization as you need the CVV number for a "card not present" transaction?

Back when Yahoo first created the "Adult" category, my canoeing group was transferred in there. This made the group nearly impossible to find and the members don't like the "Find a **** Buddy" advertisements supplied by Yahoo Sponsored Results. The usual method of changing a group category doesn't work in the adult category and Yahoo doesn't have any help available. One of the moderators even tried reporting Yahoo Sponsored Results to the abuse people as inappropriate postings.

20090129075905AAtNWCf	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Is yahoo answers really allowing free and fair debate ?	Almost every question that I've asked that criticises Israel, or tends to be anti-zionistic gets flagged or removed completely. Whether this stems from yahoo themselves, or from contributer compliants, someone in yahoo surely decides if these complaints are justified.    I find this to be an infringement of the right of free speech.   The last question of mine that was removed, concerned Israels accusation that weapons have, or are being smuggled into Gaza through the tunnels from Egypt.   I asked a simple question, why were these weapons not used against Israel recently, if these exist ? I realise that Hamas have crude mostly home-made rockets, but other, sophisticated weapons ?   Surely if Hamas was illegally importing weapons, these would be hi-tech anti-aircraft or anti-tank weapons or similar ?   An innocent enough question, you would think ?    Or is this question so unsuitable as to breach yahoo rules, enough that the question be removed ?   If yahoo wants only one-sided debate, then they should come clean and admit to this.    Then I, and I believe many like-minded contributers will cancel our membership and leave you to your "perfect" idea of reality.   Where nobody rocks the boat.   Clarity please ? Or will this question get removed ?
