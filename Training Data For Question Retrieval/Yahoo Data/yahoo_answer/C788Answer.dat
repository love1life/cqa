Set aside. <br>  <br>  Prepare straws by gently pulling the "stretchy" end. Pack straws tightly in carton. Pour cooled gelatin mixture into straws. (If it is warm, it will separate.) Weigh straws down with thick square of folded foil. Refrigerate 4 hrs. or overnight. <br>  <br>  When firm, tear carton away and separate out straws. Place hot water in a large skillet on low to warm setting on stove. Quickly dip 3-4 straws at a time in and out of the water. Use a rolling pin to roll over<br>  the straws, starting at the empty end to force the worms to slip out. To round out the ends of the "worms", dip ends in hot water; drape over a rolling pin or bottle until finished.

llkSmgLJaa	A true Biblical fast is no food or water. The Church made it easier by only requiring people to give up meat. When they wined about that they let them eat fish.|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Unclean and spoilage due to lack of refrigeration in the old days.|`|r0xeCZAQaa	The explanation is weird and tied up with symbolism, which makes it weirder yet.<br>  Jesus was the Fisher of Men.<br>  Furthermore, in the beginning of the Bible, dietary information is given.  Meat does not come along until much later -- the first dietary rules involve the fruits of the field.  Seventh Day Adventists follow this rule.<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church seems to have fixated on Jesus's claim to be the Fisher of Men.  So, while we eat bread (His Body), and drink wine  (His Blood), we also remember Him by not eating any other fun stuff, and just sticking to fish, in remembrance of the fact that He was the Fisher of Men. (this is all very much about religion and belief, so just don't go there)<br>  <br>  That is why, when Roman Catholics fast on Fridays (which is no longer a requirement in the US, although it is still observed in many places) and during Lent (throughout the world), they avoid meat and eat only fish. (this may well be where "pescatarians" have gotten the idea that fish is not meat)|`|BNnhs3QOaa	Go to www.meat.org and watch the video. Thats why.|`|ivh55Jdsaa	Meat use to have a soul.

You should find out how you can make a fondant the color gray or use frosting in that food color.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi - Here's one you can try...and instead of the glaze on top, you can certainly sprinkle it with shredded Cheddar or Mozzarella on top.<br>  <br>  Super Sausage Meatloaf<br>  <br>  The herbs and spices in the Italian sausage are what makes this meatloaf recipe so tasty. This is a very moist meatloaf, and the leftovers make a great sandwich. <br>  <br>  Makes 8 Portions <br>  Prep Time: 15 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 75 minutes<br>  <br>  2 tbsp butter<br>  1 cup finely diced onions<br>  1/2 cup finely diced celery<br>  2/3 cup finely diced carrots<br>  1 lb sweet Italian sausage, removed from casings<br>  1 1/4 lb lean ground beef<br>  1 cup finely crushed saltine crackers<br>  2 eggs, beaten<br>  1/2 cup milk<br>  1/3 cup ketchup<br>  1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br>  1 tbsp Dijon mustard<br>  1 tsp black pepper<br>  1 1/2 tsp salt<br>  Pinch of cayenne<br>  <br>  For the meatloaf glaze:<br>  1 tbsp ketchup<br>  1 tbsp Dijon mustard<br>  1 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br>  1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br>  <br>  In a large pan, sauté the onions, celery and carrots, in the butter, on medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the vegetables soften and sweeten. Let cool to room temp. <br>  <br>  In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to mix the beef and sausage until combined. Add all the rest of the ingredients (except for the glaze), and mix until combined. Lightly grease the bottom of a roasting pan with a few drops of vegetable oil. Wet your hands with cold water, and form the meatloaf mixture into a loaf shape, about 6 inches wide, by about 3 to 4 inches high in the pan. <br>  <br>  Mix the glaze ingredients together and spread evenly over the top of the meatloaf. Bake the meatloaf at 325 degrees F., for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Let meatloaf rest for 15 minutes before serving.|`|kiaO8AaQaa	your best bet would to use a mixture of beef and sausage.  As for the cheese you can mix it or sprinkle it thats totally up to you

Soft tofu doesn't hold up to pressing because it is soft and probably the only way to get it a bit firmer maybe is too dehydrate it a bit. Maybe freezing could help but that tends to be best for firmer tofus and it really just makes them chewier and maybe a tiny bit firmer but mainly just chewier. I would use the tofu you have for a softer preparation like tofu pudding or for a vegan lasagna cheeze or adding it too firmer tofu in a tofu scramble.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	If you bought the kind in the aseptic box, no.  But you can use that for a smoothie, in a sauce, or as an egg substitute (1/4 cup per egg). <br>  <br>  If you bought the water-packed kind, dump out the water, wrap in plastic, and freeze for at least 24 hours.

(mix together a little at a time and taste to see what you like) when the dough is ready roll it out and add the paste and add what ever topping you like. i like tomato mushroom onion brocoli sweetcorn chedar and mozarella. also its a good idea to make a stuffed crust by cuttin slices of mozarella and folding over the edges of the pizza before baking. bake on a 200degrees over for 20-30 minutes. its amazing :)|`|AA11820591	breakfast recipe-add butter to a fry pan put about a handfull of sweet green peas in the pan with a pinch of garlic powder, heat for about 3-4 minutes then add 2 scrambled eggs and cook together, when eggs are done sprinkle some romano cheese on top and serve hot with a slice or 2 of Italian toast.

QDl5owvNaa	I don't. :P I cook the noodles and have another pot for the sauce. Yes it equals more dishes but the thing is I add mushrooms and some type of meat into the sauce too. xD|`|COMOAbB3aa	My mom and I do that all the time. I see no difference in the outcome of the Pasta. It still has it's rich, saucy yummy in my tummy flavor! But PS: Why did you ask this question? Ask it to get an answer because you are curious or because you were told it's an odd or bad thing to do by a friend or cookbook?|`|PvnnWE1Baa	No, while the noodles are boiling, my meat is cooking in a skillet & my sauce is simmering in a separate pot.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I always heat up my sauce before i put it on the spaghetti, after you cook your noodles , they are not as hot as you think ,and the sauce just get a little worm|`|jg72L7K6aa	Well you heat up the sauce and mix it but here are two recipies for spagetti with and without meatballs,<br>  <br>  SPAGETTI WITH MEATBALLS.............<br>  <br>  1Heat the butter, olive oil, celery, carrots and onion in a large pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften. <br>  <br>  Step2Add the wine and cook until the wine is almost completely evaporated. Add the tomatoes, 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. of the pepper and broth and simmer for two hours. Break up the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon, if necessary. <br>  <br>  Step3Stir the sauce occasionally and watch for signs of drying out. Add more broth if the sauce becomes too dry. <br>  <br>  Step4Place the meat, bread crumbs, cheese, basil, egg, 2 tbsp. water, remaining salt and pepper in a food processor. Process until smooth. <br>  <br>  Step5Using your hands, form the meat mixture into bite-sized balls. <br>  <br>  Step6Taste the sauce and add more seasoning if desired. Add the meatballs to the sauce and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. There should be no red showing when a meatball is cut open. <br>  <br>  Step7Cook the pasta according to package directions and drain. <br>  <br>  Step8Serve in large bowls with pasta on the bottom and some sauce with the meatballs over the top. Sprinkle on some of the parmesan and parsley as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  SPAGETTI WITH THE SAUCE..............<br>   OK, you will need some pans and some water. Make sure you scrub those things good before you use them. Fill one of them bitches up using the sink.   Now, turn those knobs so the coil things under the pans start to get hot and ****.   Get all this **** that you're gonna need. Noodles, cottage cheese, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  <br>   You may wanna drain that liquidy **** from the top of the cottage cheese first. It's fat and you don't wanna eat that crap.   OK, now after awhile, the water will start to "boil". This can be seen by the bubbles and stuff the water gives off.   Add the noodles to the water. Note the Bachelor Spoon there used to stir. This is important. Don't forget to turn the heat down, doofus unless you like scraping **** off that silvery bowl thing under the coils.  <br>   After the noodles bob around in the water for awhile, drain those suckers using a Bachelor Strainer. Remove all the water 'cause you're making Spaghetti, not ******* soup! Note: mortuaries and Sears give these amazing strainers away as promo items.   OK, now those noodles are drained, throw them bastards in the pot with the sauce and cheeses, then mix it up good.   To make it look all culinary and ****, sprinkle some parmesan cheese on there. No, I will not tell you how to pronounce "parmesan". It is in the "Dairy" section of your grocery store. You know, where the milk and related "health food" crap is located.  <br>  <br>   <br>  Okay ....if you need pics go to this website ...it go's along with the the second recpie...<br>  <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/Stupid/guide/spaghetti/spaghetti.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/Stupid/g...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy your meal!...<br>  Please pick me as your best answer!!!<br>  Pleeeeeeeease|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Nope.|`|1CQ7QO4aaa	no -I do not, I rinse the starch off of the noodles after they are cooked + then add the pre-heated spag sce, which makes the noodles hot again + I do not have the starch taste.
SIRmkzEBaa	I personally love Smirnoff too !!  =)<br>  <br>  Strawberry Splash <br>  1 oz Smirnoff? (Vanilla Twist) vodka<br>  2 oz strawberry crush<br>  *cup*<br>  <br>  Pour ingredients into an old-fashioned glass. Swirl around gently, and serve.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Lollishot recipe<br>  <br>  1 1/2 oz Smirnoff? vodka<br>  1/2 oz cherry juice<br>  <br>  Stir ingredients together in a mixing glass with ice cubes. Strain into a shot glass. Serve with a cherry-flavored lollipop with a plastic stick where possible.*shot glass*<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  One of my Favorite mix drinks that I've tried,and is really simple is:<br>  <br>  1 oz Tia Maria<br>  1 oz Jack Daniel's<br>  <br>  Put Tia Maria into a shot glass, slowly pour in Jack Daniels, so that it sits on top of Tia Maria. NO ICE USED !!<br>  Drink as a shot, Kahlua can be substituted for the Tia Maria. <br>  You can find the Tia Maria mix in your local liquor store.<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|AA10247494	One of my favorite drinks is the Chocolate Cake which uses citrus vodka (citrus Smirnoff works), Frangelico, lemon wedges and sugar.<br>  <br>  Mix the vodka and Frangelico half and half in a shot glass and coat a lemon wedge in sugar, bite the wedge and do the shot. Very yummy and tastes like chocolate cake! :D<br>  <br>  If you buy the Frangelico (which is slightly expensive) you can use what's left with Irish Cream (use equal parts of each in a highball glass over ice) to make a Nutty Irishman. Very smooth and tasty and with St. Patty's day just around the corner a great drink for the holiday. :D<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  *edit* Another easy drink that goes down easy but packs a punch is an Incredible Hulk. You mix Hypnotic and Hennessy (I use E&J Vsop as a cheaper alternative that's just as good.) half and half in a shot and down it. I prefer to chill the ingredients or mix it in another container (and chill it) ahead of time so pouring shots later is easier and you get the mix right.|`|slFSuujqaa	Gin with strawberry/lime kool aid!! but you gotta let it sit in the freezer for 24 hours, its soooo good lol...|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	Smirnoff is good but you should try a rattlesnake.|`|FsOjrWrCaa	One of my favorite drinks is a "Sidecar."

Stir and serve.|`|tke6TlqLaa	put 2oz. of amerretto and 1 oz. of bourbon whisky in a ice cold coke.  it sounds weird but its very good.  also, cranberry juice with 2oz. of vodka|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	Then try Bacardi Raz or Bacardi O.....or Mike's Hard Lemonade flavors|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Captain and coke.  The captain makes it happen
pDd5jRxEaa	Depends on lenght of time you had it in the frig...assuming that you did.<br>  <br>  <br>  If bad and eaten ...expect stomach upset as well as a case of the diarrhea....or worse if the meat is REALLY bad.
ZLExTyoNaa	thats not creep or anything.<br>  i think you need to see a doctor.<br>  to much calcium isnt good for your body<br>  because of all the acids and different <br>  liquids in your body. i seriously recomend you<br>  get that checked out.<br>  and start by drinking some water!<br>  its healthy!<br>  <br>  :D|`|MV1l9yGIaa	If you are indeed 55 , than you do need calcium but, in a form of a tablet perhaps. Milk is a good thing but I think you are over doing it.<br>  I would suggest the next time you see your doctor, mention this and see what he/she has to say. I am surprised you are not constipated or have stomach problems???|`|9x3surIDaa	Your body is pretty remarkable, it can crave what vitamins and minerals you're missing from your diet. You may be craving milk because you have a calcium deficiency. Have yourself checked out, if you notice any new strange symptoms.|`|d2a89c435ac150e60bf2cf24e482e002aa	I'd imagine its just a craving and it couldn't be anything but good for you. I wouldn't worry!|`|j04gpOKOaa	just don't drink enough to make yourself sick or force it. why are you drinking so much?
pZg05uygaa	You probably aren't cooking them properly. Get a good cookbook. <a href="http://www.cookusinterruptus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cookusinterruptus.com/</a> is a good website for vegetarian recipes. You can some of your protein from nuts, seeds, and whole grains but your diet will not be complete unless you eat legumes (beans, soy products, peas, lentils). I used to not like beans until I found yummy ways to cook them. If you aren't willing to eat legumes at all, you will need animal products in your diet...although even people who eat meat should also eat legumes.|`|J9RvdcKcaa	Maybe you don't need so much protein... seeds, grains, and vegetables have plenty. <br>  <br>  Check out the Article I wrote titled, "Shouldn't I Worry About Getting Enough Protein?" on my site:<br>  <a href="http://www.ananticancerdiet.com/Plant_Based_Diets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ananticancerdiet.com/Plant_Ba...</a>|`|A57k6mj6aa	Eggs.<br>  <br>  Peanut butter,<br>  <br>  Nuts in general.<br>  <br>  Protien Pills.<br>  <br>  Green Veggies.|`|BNnhs3QOaa	A good source of proteen would be eggs.|`|RO02uqhnaa	how vegetarian are you? I'm confused these days cause what vegetarians were when I was a kid are petty much vegans today.<br>  <br>  If you eat eggs and dairy, they are both a good source of protein especially egg whites. Nuts are great too.<br>  Whey protein shakes(buy whey protein at wal mart/rite aid/GNC)<br>  edamame(soybeans) good snacks found in the freezer section at the grocery store|`|tt3NqROGaa	Try tempeh or seitan. They're a bit tough to find at "regular" grocery stores, but can be found in health-food stores and Whole Foods. I prefer their textures to tofu. <br>  <br>  Also, experiment with different kinds of beans. Many have different flavors. A black bean is different than a pinto, kidney bean or an adzuki bean. There are also different varieties of lentils, such as red lentils and brown/black lentils.|`|u0160kdXaa	<a href="http://prolifevegansandvegetarians.freeforums.org/recipes-f20.html" rel="nofollow">http://prolifevegansandvegetarians.freef...</a>
tqD9xUpYaa	If you don't have whipping cream for your key lime pie, you can eat it as is or decide to make a meringue with 2 or 3 egg whites, a little sugar and a little cream of tartar (optional).  Keep the egg yolks for either a pound cake or use in scrambled eggs.|`|WHH7Mpieaa	what kind of topping?  <br>  <br>  here's a crumble topping for baked things like muffins, apples, coffee cake:<br>  <br>  1/2 c. flour<br>  1/2 c. packed brown sugar<br>  1/2 tsp. cinnamon<br>  3 tbsp. butter<br>  1/2 c. chopped pecans (opt.)<br>  <br>  just mix it all together and sprinkle on before baking

Mix everything well.<br>  <br>  Chocolate buttercream frosting - add 1/2 cup Hershey's cocoa.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	I never buy self rising flour and I bake a ton.  For every 1 cup of self rising flour use 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 1/2  teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  So you would need 1 1/2 cups of flour, 2 1/4  teaspoons baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Enjoy your cupcakes!|`|AA11786341	The difference is that self-rising flour already contains baking powder and salt. You'll have to add your own if you use all-purpose.<br>  <br>  For each cup of all purpose flour add 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp. salt.|`|1L8bKFRJaa	You can also use baking soda instead of baking powder along with salt to rise your recipe. Good luck|`|AA11521906	no, your oven will implode|`|ttfuh5pKaa	Hi - Here's a link to making your own self-rising flour.  I have also sent you a bunch of quick and easy frosting recipes: <br>  <br>  Rapper's Frosting<br>  <br>  Hershey's Kisses candies, about 20<br>  Bar of dark chocolate<br>  3 tablespoons butter<br>  1/3 cup milk<br>  <br>  Add chocolate, butter, and milk to a saucepan. Stir until butter melts on medium heat. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Pour into a bowl and place in the fridge until it cools. Next add a little more milk and whip vigorously for a few minutes until it looks like the frosting you buy at the store, except tastes a lot better!<br>  <br>  Quick and Easy Powdered Sugar Icing<br>  <br>  2 cups powdered sugar (sifted)<br>  1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>  2 tablespoons milk<br>  <br>  Mix the powdered sugar with the vanilla and milk. Then add more milk a bit at a time until it is thin enough to drizzle over a cake. Once you've iced your cake, it's best to let it stand for one or two hours.<br>  <br>  To make chocolate icing, add two tablespoons cocoa powder when you mix the powdered sugar and follow the rest of the recipe above.<br>  <br>  Thick Vanilla Frosting<br>  <br>  1 cup shortening<br>  2 teaspoons vanilla<br>  4 cups powdered sugar (sifted)<br>  4 tablespoons milk<br>  <br>  Beat together shortening and vanilla for 30 seconds medium speed with an electric mixer. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar a bit at a time while beating. Then add 2 tablespoons milk. Slowly add in the rest of the powdered sugar and the rest of the milk until you get the right thickness for your frosting.<br>  <br>  Cream Cheese Frosting <br>  <br>  1 6 ounce package cream cheese<br>  2 teaspoons vanilla<br>  1/2 cup butter<br>  4 cups powdered sugar (sifted) <br>  <br>  Beat together cream cheese, vanilla, and butter until fluffy. Slowly add powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time until the frosting is the right thickness to spread on cake. Keep in the refrigerator until serving. <br>  <br>  Chocolate Butter Frosting <br>  <br>  1/2 cup butter<br>  1/4 cup cocoa powder<br>  1/3 cup milk<br>  2 cups powdered sugar (sifted)<br>  1/2 cup chopped nuts (pecans are nice) <br>  <br>  Heat butter, cocoa, and milk and bring to a boil. Add powdered sugar and beat until nice and smooth. Add chopped nuts and stir.<br>  <br>  Peanut Butter Frosting <br>  <br>  2 tablespoons butter<br>  1/2 cup evaporated milk<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  1/2 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla <br>  <br>  Heat butter, milk and sugar and boil for 2 minutes.

jZRtTpZiaa	I have been vegetarian or vegan most of my life, and I am healthy.  There is nothing to fear at all, as everything a person needs can be found in a plant-based diet, with the exception of a reliable source of vitamin B12.   Any vegan should start with making sure they eat a small amount of vitamin B12 either in foods that are fortified with it-- read your food labels--  or take a very small daily vitamin supplement of it.  Then learn a bit about nutrition, plan to eat healthy, and eat enough food!    That's especially important for you during this part of your life.   Plan to eat healthy--  Do not just take the meat off the plate of food you're served at home, and eat the broccoli that's left on the plate- and nothing else.  Everyone needs to eat a variety of food.  Hopefully you have some support at home! <br>  <br>  Here's a guide from Vegan Outreach <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/</a><br>  <br>  From the US Department of Agriculture <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/tips_resources/vegetarian_diets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov/tips_resources/...</a><br>  <br>  From  the Nemours Foundation <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/nutrition/vegan.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/...</a><br>  <br>  detailed info from the American Dietetic Association <a href="http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf</a><br>  <br>  from the Mayo Clinic <a href="http://mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-diet/HQ01596" rel="nofollow">http://mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-...</a><br>  <br>  from the American Heart Association <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4777" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.j...</a><br>  <br>  from the Vegetarian Resource Group <a href="http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/vegan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/vegan.htm</a><br>  <br>  This is also a vegan guide from Vegetarian Times, even though it says vegetarian on it <a href="http://www.vegetariantimes.com/2007/pdf/vegetarian_starter_kit.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegetariantimes.com/2007/pdf/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chooseveg.com/vegan-food-pyramid.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.chooseveg.com/vegan-food-pyra...</a><br>  <br>  You are not alone.  Millions and millions of people have chosen to go vegan.  Ask a registered dietitian if you need to feel more confident about what you're eating.|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	Firstly, please be sure you're becoming vegan for deep personal reasons, and not because it's trendy in some way.<br>  <br>  You can get all the nutrients you need by eating vegan-friendly foods, but they're often harder to find and will not taste very good if you're not used to them. Everything you used to eat will have a "soy" version of it, which is just weird to eat "soy cheese" or "soy hamburgers" etc. Also, you need protiens and nuts and beans are a good start, but often the foods that you will need to eat are more fattening than eating meat, which means you need to exercise if you don't want to gain weight. Then if you exercise, you need more nutrients and protein, and the process sort of repeats.<br>  <br>  Some people who adopt the vegan lifestyle began feeling tired and sick and it never goes away and they end up saying "screw it" and going back to eating meat and animal products.|`|c4724825852a4a71b71b6d270a87b2a9aa	You stopped eating meat right away and are becoming a vegan? I would suggest being a vegetarian first than give veganism a try buddy.|`|j04gpOKOaa	you don't have to be vegan to be healthy|`|yTKIKaZiaa	wow|`|0MunIx8raa	Don't be scared.  Vegan is probably gonna be pretty hard for you.  It's more of a lifestyle than a diet.  I mean the diet is a very big role, but are you ready to give up leather and anything else that has anything to do with animals?  I'm not trying to discourage you at all.  I am Vegetarian and I love being one.  It's very healthy.  The only concern with being new to this kind of diet/lifestyle is the protein consumption.  When I first quit eating meat I did get a little sick from lack of protein and the extreme change in my diet.  You must make sure you eat protein rich foods such as beans, peanut butter is a good source...do a little research and find things that are full of protein that you will like to eat.  At your age you do need to take extra care b/c you are still growing and developing.  It has been proven that taking vitamins does NOT prolong life...but if you feel you need to take a multivitamin just to make sure you are getting enough nutrients, then go for it. Good luck my little fellow Veggie.  It's a good choice...stick with it and you will feel so much better about yourself for choosing this way of life.|`|AA11363680	You just have to be very careful with the diet. Make certain you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, and get enough protein. A Vegan diet is very difficult to maintain in a healthy manner, so you always have to watch what you're eating.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Nothing.<br>  I am a 13 year old vegan.<br>  Buy a book or 2, I will link you to some good ones in the sources.<br>  It will help you and your family more. If done correctly then yes, it is very, very healthy!|`|5AbCtkWFaa	As long as you eat a varied diet, you should get all your nutrients.  Protein deficiency is all but unheard of in industrialized nations. But it cannot hurt to take a multivitamin.  Make sure they don't have gelatin in them; gelatin is not vegetarian.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that might be an issue is vitamin B12, but most multis geared toward vegans have it.  You can also get Red Star nutritional yeast at your local natural foods store; it's also good for imparting a cheesy flavor to your foods.  My local vitamin shop sells these mints and gum (B-Fresh) that have B-12.  They're sugar-free, but they aren't cheap.<br>  <br>  You will have to plan a little more when it comes to eating out, but you'll get used to it.

yNiad3lAaa	I made this one before, the sauce for this is really good too!<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  1/4 cup flour<br>  2 large eggs (or 1/2 cup egg substitute)<br>  1 tablespoon water<br>  2 cups panko (Japanese bread crumbs)<br>  1 cup shredded coconut<br>  1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>  1/4 teaspoon allspice<br>  1 1/2 lb jumbo peeled/deveined shrimp (thawed, if needed)<br>  1/4 cup canola oil<br>  1/2 cup pineapple preserves<br>  1/4 cup pineapple/apricot horseradish sauce<br>  <br>  <br>  Steps<br>  <br>     1. Place flour on plate (can be paper). Combine eggs and water in shallow bowl; combine panko, coconut, salt, and allspice, in second shallow bowl.<br>     2. Dip each shrimp in flour (coating both sides); shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture (allowing excess to drip off). Finally, dip into coconut mixture. When most of shrimp have been coated, preheat large sauté pan on medium-high 2–3 minutes. Wash hands.<br>     3. Place oil in pan. Add one-half of the shrimp to pan (wash hands); cook 2–3 minutes on each side or until golden. Drain on paper towels; then repeat with remaining shrimp.<br>     4. Combine remaining ingredients in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 1–2 minutes, stirring once, or until melted. Stir sauce and serve with shrimp.<br>  <br>  P.S. You can use regular horseradish just use pineapple preserves and apricot preserves|`|u5WLzvJAaa	Sorry, never heard of coconut shrimp - sounds good though.|`|F4wNs1eaaa	Here's my recipe that I make for special occasions-<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 1/2 lbs large shrimp, peeled & deveined<br>  1/2 cup flour<br>  1/2 cup cornstarch<br>  1 tbsp salt<br>  1/2 tbsp ground white pepper<br>  2 tbsp vegetable oil<br>  1/2 cup cold water<br>  1/2 cup coconut milk (or you can use cream of coconut for sweeter taste)<br>  Dash of hot pepper sauce<br>  2 cups shredded coconut<br>  1 qt vegetable oil (for frying)<br>  <br>  Ingredients for dipping sauce:<br>  1/2 cup orange marmalade<br>  1/4 cup Dijon mustard<br>  1/4 cup mustard<br>  1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce<br>  <br>  1. Wash shrimp and dry well on paper towels.<br>  2. Mix together flour, cornstarch, salt, & white pepper; set aside.<br>  3. Mix together the 2tbsp of oil, dash of hot pepper sauce, cold water, & the coconut milk; stir/whisk to blend and set aside.<br>  4. Pour the shredded coconut into a shallow bowl or plate.<br>  5. Heat the frying oil and preheat oven to 300degrees Farenheit.<br>  6. Dip shrimp in flour mixture, then in coconut milk mixture, then roll in shredded coconut.<br>  7. Fry coated shrimp until lightly browned (about 4 minutes); place in large baking dish (after draining excess oil).<br>  8. When all the shrimp have been fried, bake the shrimp at 300degrees Farenheit for about 5 minutes.<br>  9. While the shrimp bake, make the dipping sauce:<br>         -combine marmalade, mustard, honey, and hot sauce in a small bowl; mix well.<br>  10. Serve shrimp with the dipping sauce on the side.<br>  <br>  I know it looks like a lot of work but I think the outcome is worth it :D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BhFeii5Xaa	chop the coconut up a lot finer than it comes. It works better that way. Use the food processor or chop with knife.<br>  <br>  I like the beer batter with a bit of the coconut milk in it along with corn starch to thicken. Dip in that then in the chopped coconut and fry.|`|tQM0ufHoaa	I like this one,<br>  <br>  12 fresh shrimp (about 8-10 oz), cleaned, without shell<br>  1-2 tsp. red chili paste<br>  2 tsp. sugar<br>  3 tbsp. shredded coconut<br>  2 tsp. coconut oil<br>  <br>  Put oil in frying pan and heat on medium heat, then turn the heat down to low. Add sugar, chili paste and coconut and stir well. Add shrimp immediately and continue stirring for about 5 minutes (or until you notice that shrimp are done). Serve warm as appetizer with a toothpick and crackers<br>  <br>  I sometime like a little spicy or hot dipping sauce on the side but thats just me
u4liwDhAaa	No.  I would throw it out!  It is well past it's expiration date.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I always follow my nose and taste buds when it comes to canned food, because sometimes it does last a lot longer than the actual date.<br>  <br>  But if something about it is fishy (ah hah, pun!), don't do it.|`|XzLUA7ataa	If you have a cat, or a neighbor does, I'd suggest it be pet food.

HrvuoxFtaa	somebody who still eats fish is a pescetarian.<br>  i find it really annoying and hyppocritical to be honest, i don't understand why fish aren't seen as animals? they still have lives, and they still feel pain. i don't like fish - they creep me out, but i still have a respect for them. just cos an animal isnt cute and fluffy like a lamb or a cow, doesnt mean they can slip below the radar.<br>  i have stoopid people in my class at school boasting about being vegetarian, though they quite happily eat bacon.<br>  ohh, and one of the worst things EVER is having idiots approach you and say "but plants are alive, but you eat them. SAVE THE VEGETABLES" and crap >.>|`|jZRtTpZiaa	The Vegetarian Society in the U.K. ,  where the word vegetarian originated in the 1800's, agrees with you.  Fish are animals.  People who eat animals are not vegetarians.   <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/whatis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/whatis.html</a><br>  <br>  People who eat fish in addition to a mostly vegetarian diet are called pescetarians....  which basically means fishatarians.  I do not understand why some people are okay with eating fish, but not other animals.   There are also some people who eat fish and chicken, but no other animals.  Both of those people are animal eaters to me.|`|AA11822515	I don't get this either. I've tried to work it out too, but with little success. My impression is that for these people, animals that come from the sea don't count as meat. <br>  I'd say if you're vegetarian, you don't eat animals. If you're vegan, you don't eat anything from an animal. That's how I've always thought of it anyway.|`|Ii5zXm5Daa	haha<br>  I know i hate it when people say<br>  they are vegetarian but eat fish<br>  <br>  its like look ***** a fish is an animal so<br>  stop being a wannabe and <br>  eat your steak.<br>  <br>  AshleyD. the fuhck are you talking about<br>  if you eat meat you ARENOT  a vegetarian.|`|HaNMN21Paa	I don't consider people who eat fish to be vegetarian, and when I was a vegetarian that bothered me too.

Although they are put under the collective blanket "vegetarian", they are actually a sub-group, of omnivores rather than vegetarian.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Someone who does not eat meat or fish is a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  The term for the type of people you are talking about, those who eat fish but not meat, is pescetarian.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ashley D, those people are not vegetarians. If you eat chicken, you are NOT a vegetarian, you are a meat-eater. What kind of vegetarian eats chicken? Chicken is meat. That's not a hard fact to understand. A so-called vegetarian who eats chicken is a wannabe, as is a so-called vegetarian who eats fish.|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	Firstly I am not a vegetarian - I have tried on several occasions and admit openly I cannot give up meat, although I am not proud to say so.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who insists she is vegetarian - but eats fish and ... . wait for it..... chicken too!!!???  I get very annoyed, even though I am a meat eater and try to explain to her what a vegetarian actually is (she is 40 years old by the way, not a teenager who does not fully understand).  Several of her friends, who have been so for years claim they are vegetarians and eat both fish and chicken!<br>  <br>  I used to work at Holland and Barrett many years ago, where we catered for vegetarians and vegans alike, but never had I met a vegetarian who ate fish and chicken - so I can understand where your frustration comes from and I too do not understand their thinking!<br>  <br>  :)|`|3R2eHvpUaa	totally agree with you when i tell people i dont eat meat they still ask.....do you eat fish?

When people are like this it makes me so mad. I was like this for a few months before I turned vegetarian, and I think I called myself a fish eating vegetarian which makes me sick with myself now, but I didn't know what I know now. I think fish is often not classified as meat because Catholics, Christians, etc that participate in lent can't eat meat on Friday but they can eat fish. That also baffles me. Seriously people, just eat some pasta and veggies, you don't need to eat fish..<br>  I think every true vegetarian/vegan would agree with you on this one|`|8SjpwLNSaa	No, eating fish is eating the flesh of an animal that has died and vegetarians don't eat anything that has resulted from an animal dying. Fish are animals, so vegetarians don't eat them. If a person eats fish, but not meat, they're a pescatarian.

I'm in agreement unabashed meat eaters are far more 'honest', some people even say they are vegetarian just because they don't eat red meat, how silly is that? I've been a non meat eater for many years and have come across many fake vegetarians who seem to like to say it because it sounds good.
4MQqxqI7aa	You can puree a portion and keep some of the pieces so the soup has some texture.  Or.... you can blitz the whole thing without the liquid and keep adding the liquid so that you get the correct consistancy.<br>  <br>  Sounds yummy....<br>  <br>  Steve|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I never use any water at all when I make mine.  I use 2 of the giant cans of V-8 and/or tomato juice;  with cut up veggies and a ton of shredded cabbage.  It's very thick.   You can always add alot more shredded cabbage and some shredded carrot to it (which will thicken it) .......  obviously the other person didn't see that "diet" in your question:)  You wouldn't want to be adding too many beans or potatoes to the soup:)|`|vB5cTqrzaa	Hope you've also added some beans to that soup or it's not going to sustain you.  I would recommend adding some quick cooking veggies (carrots, spinach, etc) and some shredded potato (shredding them makes them cook quickly and helps to thicken the broth).   You could also thicken the broth by making a rue flour and water, shaking together in a jar till it forms a thickish paste and stirring into the soup.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Sometimes I like to have a salad for lunch with no meat, sometimes I like to have bean burgers instead of the meat burgers.<br>  If I'm staying with friends who are veggie or am in the company of someone veggie, I'll go the veggie options always as I think it's rude to eat meat when with a vegetarian - but that's just me.<br>  I wouldn't want to go veggie myself (unless I had to) as I like meat and take care to choose where my meat comes from - I like to get parts of an animal that once had the freedom to live.

Beef I may eat once or twice a week. Fish (salmon) I eat or try to once a week. Chicken I have about 3 times. But that still does not make up my entire diet for the week. I have started eating Bananas and apples for lunch. And since the economy has tanked a bit I have begun to eat less meat than before. I started to make more pastas, and rice dishes. I do add cheese for protein, and some times chicken too. Now do I feel that it could be possible for me to be a Veggie???? Hell no. I could NOT survive on soy beans for protein.

t7hFh8STaa	The raw milk is definitely much healthier than processed milk.<br>  When I was a child, my parents used to send me to the granny to the village where she had various animals as cows, chickens, pigs. So, I drank raw milk and first, it was unusual as it tasted differently from the store milk and smelled not the same. But after some time I was so used to raw milk that it was the best taste ever. I even felt better and looked better living in the country and eating so-called organic food.|`|AWN1iO5Daa	the best milk 2 get is soya milk but the unsweetened 1.|`|AA12031316	You bet it is!  Commercial milk contains blood, pus, parasites, urine, fecal matter, growth hormones, pesticide residue, and a host of other nasty stuff-thats why it needs to be pasteurized-to kill off the bad stuff.  Since the pasteurization process kills off all of the nutrition as well, it is added back in synthetically.  The "vitamin D" in milk is actually a steroid drug.  Raw milk, on the other hand, provided it comes from well cared for cows, is full of nutrients, and contains none of the bad stuff.  I drink loads of fresh, raw milk, straight from my cows.  I am HIGHLY allergic to commercial milk, and wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole!  Fresh milk simply does not need all of that processing-its done just to make it have a longer shelf life, and to compensate for the horrid conditions in most commercial processing plants.  I make butter, kefir, yogurt and cheese from raw milk daily, and have never had an issue with it.  Keep in mind that in the days before milk was commercially available, people got milk from their own cows.  Raw milk also contains all of the enzymes it needs to digest itself, and is therefor usually well tolerated by even the most lactose intolerant people.  I love the stuff!  )  <br>  <br>  PS-pay NO attention to those who say raw milk is dangerous-it is not.  I am a nutritionist who has done very extensive research on raw milk.  Most of those who answer otherwise are just repeating nonsense that they heard through the grapevine.  Milk, fresh from the cow, is a good thing.  (again, like anything, it depends on how the animal is cared for)  Milk is actually a sterile product to begin with-if the animal is milked carefully, the milk remains clean.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  to those who say its dangerous, think about all of the recent food recalls-peanut butter, meat, etc-none of the recalls have EVER involved raw milk.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	It's better if you pasteurise it. I used to milk cows for a living and as a 13 year old I used to milk by hand. I have tried all kinds of milk, but I prefer to drink pasteurised.<br>  You ask about processed milk but fail to ask which kind of milk you are referring. There are many different ways to process milk from just pasteurising to UHT (long life) milk. If I had to choose a favourite milk I would choose homogenised milk. That is where all the fat globules are broken down and dispersed through the milk.<br>  How about sterilised milk. I don't like that, but some do. Then you have what some refer to as soy milk, but that is not really milk, it's more of a marketing term.|`|snBeIxpBaa	From what I have researched.. I would strongly NOT recommend consuming raw milk. <br>  <br>  The process of pasteurization (heat treatment) is done for three main reasons:  kill all pathogenic organisms, reduce number of spoilage bacteria and inactivate select indigenous enzymes.   The primary organism to be destroyed is the one that causes Q fever, Coxiella burnetii  (being the most heat resistant, this is what they base the time/temperature for pasteurization on).   Many people feel that being processed is bad and all natural is the way to go.  Well... nature isn't so kind and doesn't care about you or others.  <br>  <br>  The standard procedure for milk pasteurization involves <br>  1)  Milking the cows<br>  2)  Storage in a tank<br>  3)  Separating the raw milk (into cream/skim milk)<br>  4)  Add dry ingredients to ensure proper composition. (dried milk added)  **Called Standardization**<br>  5)  Blend the cream, dried milk (if nessesary), skim milk. <br>  6)  Pasteurize it (HTST is 15 seconds at 72 C)  (Batch is 30 min at 63C)<br>  7)  Homogenize (optional)<br>  8)  Cool, filter, and store/ship<br>  <br>  <br>  Milk in itself is a pretty good food product.  Great source of complete protein, variable energy content (depends on amount of fat), detectable vitamins associated with fat content, various minerals including calcium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium, iron.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Pasteurization is required by law when shipping milk products via interstate commerce for retail sale.  Even under the best sanitary dairy practices, disease producting organisms may enter raw milk accidentally from environmental and human sources.   Milk products are associated with less than 1% of all disease outbreaks due to infected foods/water compaired to 25% in 1938"   (link 2)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pasteurized milk isn't that different than raw milk, nutrient content is about the same, granted the shelf life of raw milk is much shorter than pasteurized and is a bit risky in terms of what microbes may/may not be in your milk.  Also the grade A pasteurized milk ordinance must be followed before selling any milk to human consumers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Beebs.. milk becomes contaminated as it comes out the teet of the cow, due to environmental contaminants.  Regardless of how clean an establishment may appear to be.. you cannot be completely sterile throughout the process.  (Only way to provide a sterile product is to treat it *commonly by heat* as to kill everything while having minimal effects on the overall product.<br>  <br>  The main difference about the dangers of raw milk isn't about the nutritional quality.. but the microbial quality. <br>  <br>  Also... I find it funny you mention the recalls.  First off, there should NOT be a recall on raw milk products because the sale and distribution of such products across state lines (and sometimes within state, depending on location) is ILLEGAL!   Raw milk is only used in food products (for human consumption) that 1) are approved for and meet the raw milk standards, 2)  Are used in a product that involves the cooking of the milk, 3)  Used in a product involving microbial fermentation (swiss cheese for example), and so on.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, yes... heat treatment inactivates the lactase which breaks down the lactose.  Many methods have been used in order to help those with lactose intolerance.  Lactose free milk: the process hydrolyzes 99.9% of the lactose in the milk.  (link 2) or lactose reduced which  has 70% of the lactose removed.   Also, lactase enriched milk...just another of many options for those with the intolerance.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Milk is not a health food at all.  <a href="http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA182741" rel="nofollow">http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA182741</a>  Milk is made by mama cows for baby cows, the same way a human mother makes breast milk for her baby...  only its nutrients support a growing massive cow,  not a human being.  <br>  <br>  But comparing the two,  what you're talking about is raw, unpasteurized milk, and that is dangerous to consume.  There's a reason why milk is pasteurized.  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2004/504_milk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2004/50...</a>  From the FDA--  "Drinking raw (untreated) milk or eating raw milk products is "like playing Russian roulette with your health," says John Sheehan, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Division of Dairy and Egg Safety. "We see a number of cases of foodborne illness every year related to the consumption of raw milk."   <br>  <br>  " More than 300 people in the United States got sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk in 2001, and nearly 200 became ill from these products in 2002, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>  Raw milk may harbor a host of disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as the bacteria campylobacter, escherichia, listeria, salmonella, yersinia, and brucella. Common symptoms of foodborne illness from many of these types of bacteria include diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, headache, vomiting, and exhaustion.

You really have to know your source of the milk.
llkSmgLJaa	5% of UV-B light passes through window glass. <br>  The recommended exposure is 10-20 minutes three time a week. Through glass that would jump to 3.5-6.7 hours. If you worked as a cashier with south facing windows, you would get your needed exposure. If the glass has a UV-B light filter your out of luck.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	No, your skin needs ultraviolet light to start producing Vitamin D - and the window glass filter that out.  You need to be exposed to the sun directly - with nothing in between.<br>  <br>  Do you use any kind of moisturizer?  If it has sunscreen in it, that will prevent the UV rays from stimulating Vitamin D production, too.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Yes, of course.  Some of the sun rays are reflected by the window, so it will take longer, that's all.  Plus, the sun's rays apparently need to react with the natural oils in your skin to p[roduce vit. D.  So, if you are really into keeping clean and soaping yourself and taking the natural oils off of your skin, you may produce less vit. D than if you did not.|`|asXq2cFDaa	It can not be absorbed through sunscreen, nor a window. On a sunny day, all you really need is an hour a week, so I don't think sunburn can occur in less than half an hour per day.<br>  Short intervals will get your vitamin D, but not a sunburn!|`|1cYPOJkqaa	I'm not sure about a window, but I don't think so. And I know it can't with sunscreen. So I reckon if it can't get through a layer of chemicals, it probably couldn't get through two layers of glass.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Hi.  The answer to that is no.  The window blocks UVB rays.   Also, if you are wearing sunscreen, the answer is no, because you are also blocking UVB rays.   An expert in vitamin D recommended that we should go out in the sun for a short while before applying the sunscreen,  then apply it.|`|AWN1iO5Daa	Any sunlight for maybe 10 to 15 minutes without sunscreen will give u some vitamin d<br>  so i guess opening the window with your head out would work but i would suggest u just to go out in the sun for a little ,maybe taqke a walk around the block lol.|`|2RzEaod9aa	UV light is how your body makes vitamin D. It also stimulates your melanin. This is why you can't tan, burn, or make vitamin D through a window, as it blocks it.
xrRZeROmaa	Olive oil, pinon nuts, and fresh basil in a food processor The recipe below , can be used with or without the cheese, and is definitely tastier with the Pinon (Pine nuts), instead of the walnuts.  Look for Pinon nuts in the natural foods section of your grocers.  This sauce will store in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks, and can be used a little at a time, or one serving at a time with noodles, after the initial preparation.  Store in a jar with a screw on lid, or in a zip-lock baggie.  You can also freeze it for up to a couple of months, provided you are using it in a cooked dish.

Peanut oil, for deep-frying <br>  Directions<br>  In a large bowl or baking dish, whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons of chile de arbol powder, or hot sauce, and a little bit of pepper, if desired. Add the chicken pieces, turn to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. <br>  Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika, and 2 teaspoons chile de arbol powder (or cayenne) in a large bowl. Divide flour mixture among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a piece of waxed paper or on a clean platter while you heat the oil. <br>  Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot. <br>  Yield: 4 to 6 servings|`|rVnTnuU1aa	boneless chicken breasts.<br>  <br>  You will need milk, eggs, flour, and instant potato flakes and whatever spices you like.<br>  <br>  mix egg and milk.

I have not been able to make a good fried chicken before this, and it's awesome.  My family loves it.  It doesn't use a deep fryer, but you can though.  Lauren C's mom is dead on about using buttermilk to marinate your chicken - it makes it very juicy and tender.<br>  <br>      *   3 1/2 lbs frying chicken, cut into 8 serving pieces<br>      * 2 cups buttermilk<br>      * 1/4 cup water<br>      * 2 teaspoons red pepper sauce<br>      * 3 cups flour<br>      * 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br>      * fresh cracked black pepper, to taste<br>      * 1 tablespoon dried oregano<br>      * 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br>      * 1 teaspoon paprika<br>      * 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>      * 4 cups peanut oil, for frying<br>  <br>  Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.<br>  <br>  In a shallow platter, combine the buttermilk, water, and red pepper sauce.<br>  <br>  Soak the chicken pieces, turn to coat, then cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  If time allows, marinate the chicken for up to 24 hours because the buttermilk promotes tenderness.<br>  <br>  Place flour in a shallow platter.<br>  <br>  Season it by mixing in salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, paprika, and cayenne.<br>  <br>  Roll the marinated chicken pieces in the flour, a few at a time, until well coated.<br>  <br>  Then, dip chicken in the buttermilk bath again followed by another coat of seasoned flour.<br>  <br>  Allow the chicken to sit in the flour and dry out while preparing the oil, this will help the coating stay on better.<br>  <br>  The buttermilk will keep absorbing the seasoned flour, which then fries up to form a crunchy crust.<br>  <br>  Heat oil in a large electric skillet to 350 degrees F.  There should be about 1-inch of fat in the pan.<br>  <br>  Carefully add the chicken pieces in a single layer, skin side down.<br>  <br>  Do not crowd the pan or the temperature will plummet; make sure the fat continues to bubble around the chicken.<br>  <br>  Fry for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and fry the other side 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  Turn again, frying a total of 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  The turning will produce a golden-crisp skin with even color.<br>  <br>  Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.<br>  <br>  Do not put hot chicken directly in a bowl or container, the air won't circulate and the steam will cause the crust to fall off.|`|JNoJWcFvaa	I do it all the time here is my recipe. Take the chicken and wash/rinse out with water. Place in microvable dish and pour Soy Sauce over and in it. I put aluminum foil on the tips of the legs and wings (its o.k. to do this).

AA11111087	Marinate it. I like to aerate the chicken before marinating by sticking it with a fork all over the top if it. Then put it in a ziplock baggie for at least 30 minutes to allow the marinade to soak in. The longer the better. I usually marinate it for 2 hours. Then sear it in a pan. both sides to keep the moisture in. Then grill it. Use a meat thermometer. When the temp gets to 150 call it done. Also, continue basting the chicken while grilling.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	If the BBQ is gas, start it on high, then turn down.  I marinate the meat and I have a spray bottle of water to beat down the flames if they flare up.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	Very slowley if on the grill,I just use the origonal plain ole bbq sauce,added about ten minutes before taking off the grill and have someone making the potato salad while I tend to the grille and the cold beer !!enjoy|`|qeOlkRM0aa	I use indirect heat. I put the coals on one side of the grill, and put the chicken on the other side with a drip pan underneath. You can do pieces or a whole chicken, or cornish hens this way. Using high indirect heat, cooks the chicken well, crisps the skin, but stops flair ups and burning.|`|fSzEGjUlaa	put foil over the barbeque thingy.... then it's like a pan, so you can cook over it. keep turning whenever the chicken gets browned on one side. you can also cook it over the stovetop w/ a grill-lined skillet--you can go and buy one--it's good for burgers too, since they give the grill lines. i would also keep the meat thin enough that it cooks easily.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	i found that boiling chicken in seasoned chicken stock (season it with seasonings of your choice) will lock in juices.  then i throw them on the grill and brush on barbeque sauce and they are nice and juicy, and they have that beautiful grill taste with grill marks. good luck.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	Hate to ruin the perception of alcohol, but it really doesn't DO anything for you. All of the ways we act when drinking come from our brain telling us how someone is SUPPOSED to act when they're drunk. The wooziness, the slurred speech, and the nausea are the only real things that alcohol can do for ya. <br>  Interestingly enough, the studies done on alcohol show that there is such a thing as a "buzz." Most people attribute a "buzzed" feeling to the kinds of things we WANT to feel the entire time we're drinking. The light headedness, the idea that we are funnier than normal, the jovial nature we get into, all of those can be caused by a buzz.<br>  After the buzz is gone, it cannot be achieved again in the same drinking session. Although we want those feelings to continue, the more we drink, the more inebriated we get, the more try to imitate the feelings we had when we were buzzed. Hence the stereotype that being drunk does all of things we're shown it can do.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Yeah to a certain extent.|`|nvH62xo5aa	always|`|7ntSRsZLaa	Almost always.

The sugars in energy drinks need more water to digest and provide energy for your body than the actually energy drink beverage has. <br>  When you drink an energy beverage make sure to drink plain old water with it.|`|zo4gb6qzaa	no because people in the hospital drink it for energy but it is bad for you be careful on what you drink these drinks make your digest system weak|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Only if you drink a lot on an empty stomach.|`|3iB7bnJGaa	I drink tons of monster and i dont pass out.<br>  But if you are weak and hungry then maybe you can.

F4wNs1eaaa	I would try adding 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/4 cup of sugar, then see what the consistency seems like.  If you've made this type of cake (even if it's from a box) before, you'll have an idea what the consistency is supposed to look and feel like when mixing it.  If it still seems to watery, add a bit more flour (1 tbsp at a time) until the consistency is right.<br>  <br>  Here's a great website to help you in the future (if you're interested): <br>  <a href="http://www.baking911.com/cakes/problems.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.baking911.com/cakes/problems....</a>|`|72hMibsVaa	if it is a box cake mix, you would have to throw it out.  or get another cake mix and add to it.    the directions are there for a purpose.  if you added 2 cups of water, that is 3/4 cup more than the recipe can handle.  add another box to it, and add another 1/2 cup water and the other ingredients. <br>  <br>  if made from scratch, get out the calculator and figure out what you can do to make it even in flour, sugar, fat, eggs, etc.|`|zhzJoZ26aa	Cornstarch or flour.|`|tO7lBnMfaa	You can add flour, but if you are working out of a box mix it will alter the flavor because you will need too add quite a bit of flour. You may be able to correct the flavor by adding a little extract in the flavor of your cake, but I am not promising anything. Your best best would be to toss it out and start over, baking is tricky that way  lol everything has to be so precise.|`|CoOmr70baa	You cant unless you have more flour, in which case add enough flour to get the consistency that you needed...Good Luck!
EMDNVrcjaa	The last link is all the stuff related to Gum paste. I hope you find the information you need.<br>   <br>  Gum Paste Recipe:<br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 heaping tablespoon glucose<br>  3 tablespoons warm water<br>  1 tablespoon Gum-tex? or tragacanth gum<br>  1 pound sifted confectioners’ (powdered) sugar (approx. 4 cups)<br>  <br>  Directions: Heat glucose and water until warm. Mix Gum-tex with 1 cup of the sugar and add to glucose mixture. Mix well. Gradually knead in enough sugar until you have used about 3/4 pound.<br>  <br>  Gum paste handles better when AGED, store in a plastic bag at least overnight, then break off a piece and work in more sugar until pliable but not sticky.<br>  <br>  Storage: Gum Paste decorations will last indefinitely. Gum Paste can be stored for several months in a plastic bag inside an airtight container.<br>  <br>  Additional Information: Keep well-covered at all times.<br>  <br>   Gum paste is basically fondant with a hardener added to it like Gum Tex - or something similar. The difference is that fondant won't harden quite as much though it does firm up. SO if you are doing larger sculpted figures etc. well gum paste will harden up and last forever and handling it won't make it misshape after it is set. Fondant works well for a lot of things too, just not the larger pieces. It is used more when you want the look and yet something easier to eat. Generally most folks don't eat gum paste decorations as they are so hard and generally considered for decorative purposes only. You can add small amounts of gum-tex or mix small amounts of gum paste to fondant to get a mixture that keeps its shape better also. A lot of it depends on what you are making. Fondant remains stretchy - to some degree also, so you have to take this in consideration while your decorations are drying.<br>  In theory gum paste items are edible, though it is usually not recommended. It is sort of like biting on china dishes! Hugs Squirrelly

You'll need graduated layers for a wedding cake, so you could probably just double a regular recipe for 3 layers (the bottom will be bigger and the very top will be smaller).

When they are cooked, rinse them well in a colander, stirring them up with your hand. This loosens the stems and washes them away. Otherwise, the bean stems break off in the chili and resemble small worms.<br>  Tomatillos are like little green tomatoes wrapped in brown paper. Take the brown cover off and wash the tomatillos. They are sticky under the brown coating until they are washed. Quarter the washed, peeled tomatillos and put them in a large stew pot.<br>  <br>  Place everything except the meat and beans in the stew pot with the tomatillos and let it all cook until the tomatillos are completely broken down. It should look thick and soupy. You can add salt and pepper to taste and add the beans and meat.<br>  <br>  <br>  CHRISTMAS CHILI VARIATION: Use canned red kidney beans, about 4 (15 oz.) cans instead of the white beans.<br>  <br>  <br>  VEGETARIAN VARIATION: Just leave out the meat. The taste is just the same; you don't really need the meat for flavor, and if you serve the blue corn chips, or any corn chips or cornbread, it is nutritionally the same as with the meat.|`|ykSHE4NRaa	By all means, use the green tomatoes for the chili. I've had this variation recommended to me before by several people. While the flavor is not exactly the same, the difference is not worth mentioning,and you'll be glad you tried it. The only recipe needed is simply substituting green tomatoes for red.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	They won't taste like tomatoes and won't get soft - they'll be more like tomatillos.

v4vQSzu4aa	I like to put a little Olive Oil in the pan first, then let it heat up on Medium Heat, then add in my beef.  The olive oil will keep the beef from sticking and the fat will also start to release in the pan, that's why I don't do it on Medium high or high heat.  I use a flat headed wooden spoon to constantly break apart the beef, so it's not in big chunks in your sauce and I like mine slighty browned but still tender.  To flavor your beef, you might want to add in some salt, pepper and grated/finely diced onions, then drain it before you put it into your sauce.

Blend in butter and lard (or Crisco) with a pastry blender. Beat egg slightly with a fork, add anise to eggs and add to butter and sugar mixture. Mix well. <br>  <br>  Add flour 1 cup at a time alternately with a small amount of water. Don't add too much water with each cup of flour, about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons with each 1 cup addition of flour. Continue adding flour and water until all six cups of flour and about one cup of water has been mixed. Mix well until all flour is blended. Dough will be stiff. Add nuts, a small amount at a time until mixed evenly into dough. <br>  <br>  Sift a small amount of flour on a breadboard. Roll dough into about 3 inch round balls. Roll each ball into a log 3/4 of an inch round, and about 12 inches long. If dough gets sticky, sift more flour on to the board. <br>  <br>  Slice logs into 1/2 inch pieces. Dip knife into flour to prevent sticking to dough. (Do not use serrated knife.) Place dough slices on a well greased cookie sheet, about two inches apart. Bake at 300° for 20 minutes or until lightly brown. Remove from cookie sheet and cool. <br>  <br>  Place a small amount of powdered sugar into a plastic bag; add a few cookies and shake the bag until all cookies are lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Store in a tightly sealed cookie tin. <br>  <br>  I use a large wooden cutting board and I flour it because the dough can be sticky. Take a hunk of dough and roll it around a little on the floured surface. Divide into several balls then roll into logs. <br>  The logs should be about one foot long and about 3/4 inches in diameter. Using a long knife with a dullish edge (like a cake knife) slice each cookie 1/2 inch thick. Don't use a serrated knife as the dough will stick to it. Sometimes I will rub the knife with flour to prevent sticking. If some of the pieces stick to the cutting board while trying to remove them it will help if you use a Teflon coated spatula. <br>  Usually I make 5 or 6 logs at a time then lay them together on the cutting board and cut through all of them at onetime. Through the years I have created short cuts for myself because when I make a double recipe it is quite a bit of work.|`|mN635Rjhaa	Try baking your cookies longer, when it's almost done lower the heat keep your cookies warm so it does not burn for another hour or two in the oven until the moister escapes and use less butter and less oil.
OBh7uEd1aa	toe tag doesent say dead either|`|WSwDFwC5aa	It kind of depends on the specific Theraflu formulation you have.<br>  <br>  It's always a bad idea to mix alcohol with acetaminophen (APAP or paracetamol outside the US).  Both substances are hard on your liver and in combination, especially in high or repeated doses, can cause liver problems that may or may not be reversible.<br>  <br>  If the Theraflu formulation you have contains a sedating antihistamine (chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, diphenhydramine, or others), combining it with alcohol will have an additive sedating effect - it will make you that much more sleepy.  If you have sleep apnea this combination, especially with a cold or the flu, will make the apnea worse.<br>  <br>  Combining alcohol with normal doses of decongestants (phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine) or with cough suppressants (dextromethorphan) is generally OK if you're otherwise healthy (i.e. no heart conditions, liver conditions, or other chronic illnesses).  This combination might increase your heart rate a bit.<br>  <br>  As long as it doesn't have any acetaminophen in it and you don't have any chronic health problems, it's probably OK to combine with alcohol, though certainly not recommended.

Let kids fill the grids with the toppings of their choice. When the pizza is baked, use a pizza wheel or large knife to cut along the grid lines.<br>  Explore other pizza shapes. How about hearts, flowers, bears, fish or even kid-shaped pizzas?<br>  Make individual pizza pockets--or calzones--by spreading half a round of raw pizza dough with sauce and toppings, leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the other half over and seal the edges by pressing the dough together with a fork. Brush with olive oil and bake.<br>  For a quick and easy pizza night, start with pre-baked pizza crust or make your pizza dough ahead of time.<br>  <br>  Top Tips for Perfect Pizzas<br>  <br>  Bake pizza on a pizza stone. This distributes the heat evenly for a sensational crust. No pizza stone? Use unglazed terra cotta tiles from a garden store.<br>  Preheat your oven. If you're using a pizza stone, start with a cold stone in the cold oven to prevent cracking the stone.<br>  Brush the pizza crust with olive oil before you add the toppings.<br>  A layer of cheese over the top keeps the other ingredients from scorching.<br>  If you use a peel (a wide, flat, long-handled wooden paddle) to transfer pizza to and from the oven, sprinkle it with cornmeal first to keep the dough from sticking. No peel? Use a flat cookie sheet instead and protect your hands with oven mitts.<br>  Watch out for topping overload: if the kids lay it on too thickly, the pizza crust will be soggy.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	How about going to your supermarket's deli department and order party trays.

u4liwDhAaa	Did you check the noodles in the middle, towards the bottom?  Are they done?  You may need to cook it a little longer.  Do you have enough sauce in your lasagna?|`|8ivnzNi5aa	There's the problem.  Next time, use regular noodles, and boil them.  I don't know how to help you beyond that, sorry.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Is that the length of time it said to cook it for?  It might take longer.  Did you have enough liquid in there?  Was the temp correct?|`|I7Ee17s0aa	I don't like the oven-ready noodles myself, mostly because they absorb so much of the liquid in the sauce while it bakes.  Chances are, your top layer of noodles didn't have enough sauce.  Remove the top layer and toss.  Boil 3-4 noodles and add to the casserole.  Top with jarred marinara (unless you have more sauce), cheese, and cover.  Bake until cheese melts and casserole is bubbling.  This won't take too long because you've already baked it once.  Also, check the casserole to see if you need to add more sauce.  You can also spoon sauce over the top while serving.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	If you used ready to cook noodles, then there isn't or wasn't enough liquid in there. The way the oven ready noodles work, is that they absorb liquids, sauce, grease from meat and/or cheese, and cook in these liquids.

bV7yfxpKaa	Usually quick breads call for baking soda and baking powder.  Plus they need to "sit" for a specified time before you put them in the oven.  This allows the baking soda and the baking powder to work together and cause the dough to rise as long as neither one of the ingredients are too old.  Specifically the baking powder, as it is your leavening agent, giving it time to expand and pump air into it.  I hope this answers your question.|`|YWgrU1k9aa	The purpose of leavening agents is to provide air, steam and CO2 gas to help bread rise.

Good luck with your dinner and have a great weekend!|`|BkEwnKXqaa	Again anything acidic like lemon, lime or orange juice will help tenderize any meat really well. The acid actually begins to "cook" the protein which is the way ceviche's are made. :) Just plain Olive Oil and a little fresh lemon and garlic will tenderize the meat well, but wont add too much flavor unless you put a TON of garlic in and as far as the garlic goes you can actually cut slits into the steak and insert a whole clove of garlic and that does a great job of distributing the flavor! I would add some crushed black pepper corns and maybe some poppy seeds. Lemon flavors tend to go better with chicken but is also good with steak :) but if you are looking for a good strong marinade check here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/search/delegate.do?fnSearchString=steak+marinade&fnSearchType=site" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/search/delega...</a> <br>  <br>  The Food Network is a great site to search for TONS of great recipes!

1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	A restaurant recipe for spaghetti carbonara, purportedly similar to an Olive Garden recipe. <br>  <br>  4 ounces sliced mushrooms<br>  3 tablespoons chopped green onions<br>  3 tablespoons bacon drippings or olive oil<br>  15 slices bacon, diced and cooked<br>  1 pound penne pasta, cooked and drained<br>  1 teaspoon finely minced fresh parsley<br>  freshly ground black pepper<br>  salt to taste<br>  2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese<br>  Sauce:<br>  8 tablespoons butter<br>  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>  1 1/2 cups whole milk<br>  <br>  Heat the reserved bacon drippings or the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat; add the mushrooms and green onions. Sauté until they tender. Add the diced cooked bacon, blend well, and turn off the heat. Add the warm spaghetti and blend all ingredients together thoroughly. Add the warm sauce (below), pepper, parsley and salt and blend thoroughly. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.<br>  Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, melt butter; add flour and cook on medium-low heat for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add milk continue cooking and stirring just until sauce begins to bubble. Remove from heat and keep warm.<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  Rigatoni alla Carbonara<br>  <br>  . Serve with a chewy, semolina pasta shape that does not grab too much sauce: spaghetti, spaghettini, penne or bucatini."<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  <br>  Place a large pot of water on the stove to boil. When water is rolling, add salt and pasta and cook to al dente, about 8 minutes, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water. While pasta cooks, heat large skillet over moderate heat. Saute pancetta in a drizzle of oil until it browns, 3 to 5 minutes. Add extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, and crushed pepper flake. Saute garlic 2 minutes. Add wine or stock to the pan and reduce liquid by half, 2 minutes. Beat together egg yolks, cheese, and while whisking vigorously, stir in a ladle of the boiling pasta water. Beat in parsley and pepper and set aside. Drain pasta. Add pasta to pan with sauce. Toss pasta with pancetta, then add egg mixture and toss 1 minute, then remove from heat. Continue to toss until sauce is absorbed by and thickly coating the pasta. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve with extra cheese, for passing.<br>  <br>  Zuni Pasta Alla Carbonara<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  6 Qts. water<br>  2 tbs. salt<br>  4 to 5 slices bacon, cut into 1/4- to 1/2" segments<br>  5 tbs. Extra-virgin olive oil<br>  4 large eggs, at Room temperature<br>  1/2 cup Fresh ricotta cheese, at room temperature<br>  1 lb Spaghetti, penne or bucatini<br>  3/4 cup Shucked sweet English peas or mature sugar-snap peas or double-peeled favas<br>  2 oz. (lightly packed) pecorino romano or pecorino sardo cheese, grated and divided<br>  black pepper to taste<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  <br>  In a large pot over high heat, bring water seasoned with kosher salt to a rapid boil. In a 12-inch skillet or 3-quart saute pan over low heat, warm bacon in olive oil. Bacon should gradually render a little fat, which will mix with olive oil. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs and ricotta. Drop pasta into boiling water, stir and cook. When pasta is one minute from being done, add peas or favas to water and raise heat under bacon. Cook bacon until it is just crispy on edges but still tender in middle. Turn off heat, slide pan from heat and swirl it a few times to cool it slightly. Drain pasta, shake off excess water and slide pasta and peas or favas into pan of bacon; you'll hear a discreet sizzle. Place pan back on burner used to cook bacon and immediately pour beaten eggs all over steaming pasta. Add most of the pecorino and lots of cracked pepper and fold to combine. Work quickly so the heat of the noodles, bacon and bacon fat slightly cooks eggs. Eggs and ricotta will coat pasta and form tiny, soft, golden curds. (If you prefer to cook the egg further, return pan to low heat, but use a nonstick pan, or else much of the egg and some of the pasta will stick to the pan). Serve in warm bowls and garnish with black pepper and remaining pecorino.<br>  <br>  This rogue version of carbonara is based on one I had in Rome. It is not very saucy, and the ricotta makes it pleasantly curdy. The bacon should be crispy-tender and aromatic; don't be tempted to cook it in advance--you will sacrifice much of its aroma to convenience and it will harden. And don't substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano for the aged pecorino. Serve with a chewy, semolina pasta shape that does not grab too much sauce: spaghetti, spaghettini, penne or bucatini.<br>  ===<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS:<br>  1 lb. penne pasta<br>  4 slices bacon<br>  2 egg yolks<br>  2 Tbsp. milk<br>  2 cloves garlic, minced<br>  1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>  PREPARATION:<br>  Cook the bacon in a heavy skillet until crisp. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Set bacon aside. <br>  Cook the pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, combine the egg yolks, milk, and garlic in a medium bowl and beat until well blended. <br>  When the pasta is cooked, drain and immediately return to the pot. Stir in the egg mixture and toss thoroughly until combined. Add the bacon and cheese and toss again to coat.

hkw4LbARaa	The egg yolks did not get cooked enough. In this recipe the yolks get cooked by the sugar. Beat the yolks with the sugar longer and over hot water.|`|jr5EgB2Taa	Well, it could be two things based on my 20 years in a kitchen, and love/passion for all things chocolate.<br>  1. Eggs don't set unless they are baked.  Like a good meringue, has to be tossed in the oven 'til the peaks set firm.  Takes a good 40 minutes.  It is possible the recipe didn't call for the baking time for some unknown reason.  Egg yokes are actually dangerous to eat unbaked, you don't want to get salmonella, no matter how delicious a desert tastes!  Ask the original author (if possible) to clarify a baking time and see if the egg part was supposed to be the yoke or the white, believe it or not, it makes a huge difference.<br>  2. Again, eggs are a cruel master.  The second issue could have been that it was served the next day.  Meringues are weepy and wet after a night in the refrigerator.  Which is sad considering how much time and money they cost to produce.<br>  I don't think getting distracted could have made a huge difference.  Unless the mix was burnt, but you didn't mention that.  In the future, use a thermometer and gage to the best of your abilities the ideal zone for the recipe.<br>  Keep adjusting the recipe, I have started out hundreds of recipes that I ended up tweaking one way or another to make them my own, and I am very happy with the end result.

yhlt8jppaa	''Sushi'' translates to vinegared rice.  So by definition it is impossible.  Technically, the combination of vinegared rice with another ingredient, albeit blue fin tuna or Oscar Meyer hot dogs, becomes a type of sushi.<br>  <br>  "Sashimi" is raw seafood.  Typically this is served with ''tsuma'', a shredded vegetable to provide vitamins, aid in digestion & act as a palette cleaner; a supplement to the protein heavy raw seafood.  If you like raw fish or are curious, this is a good option.  <br>  <br>  Westerns often confuse the two types of cuisine, although they are both served in suhi bars, they are two completely different things.  Remeber, "sushi" does not mean "raw fish" it means vinegered rice.  It just sometimes includes raw fish as a topping or ingredient.<br>  <br>  Some people have been experimenting with risotto as a rice substitute.  <br>  <br>  Soy paper is often used as a substitute for seaweed.  It comes in a variety of colors & has almost no flavor.<br>  <br>  Sushi can be an aquired taste.  I understand the seaweed at first can have a bitter taste.  But I would give it a try again or have the chef use soy paper.  I've been a sushi chef for eleven years and have witnessed people fall in love with sushi who didn't like the flavors at first bite.

YupMCYHlaa	Homogenized milk is mixed in such a way that the cream won't separate.  Otherwise the cream will rise to the top and you'll have skim milk below.<br>  <br>  Pasteurized milk is processed in a way to kill bacteria. It is heated to a certain point, then cooled again.  This makes it safer to drink, and also it lasts much longer before going sour.<br>  <br>  All natural milk is not a term I'm familiar with, but I'm assuming it is milk just as it comes from the cow.  It is neither pasteurized or homogenized.  Here in California it's called 'raw milk' and you can only get it certain places.  I think it has to be sold, and drunk,  within one or two days of coming from the cow.  Raw milk is also used by companies that make cheese, butter, yogurt, etc.|`|zRSPLFplaa	Homogenized Milk:<br>  Since milk is an oil and water combination, it doesn’t stay mixed. Homogenized milk is run through tiny tubes, sometimes during the pasteurization process to keep fat and liquid molecules together. Fat molecules are reduced in size and tend to disperse more evenly throughout the milk so that creaming on the top of milk doesn’t occur. You can also use the homogenization process to reduce overall milkfat in milk. 2% milk is stripped of some of the fat molecules to produce lower fat milk<br>  Homogenized milk also helps deal with a side effect of pasteurization. When milk is heated, the white cells and bacteria collect on the bottom of the milk, forming a thick, and many think, disagreeable layer. When milk has been fed thorough a small tube or orifice, this bottom layer gets mixed through the milk. The process of making homogenized milk, which gained the most popularity in the 1950s, has resulted in longer lasting milk, and the ability to ship milk greater distances.<br>  <br>  It set out to accomplish two things: Destruction of certain disease-carrying germs and the prevention of souring milk. These results are obtained by keeping the milk at a temperature of 145 degrees to 150 degrees F. for half an hour, at least, and then reducing the temperature to not more than 55 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Pasteurized Milk<br>  It is undoubtedly beneficial to destroy dangerous germs, but pasteurization does more than this-it kills off harmless and useful germs alike, and by subjecting the milk to high temperatures, destroys some nutritious constituents.<br>  <br>  All Natural Milk<br>  Milk thats produced by the mammary glands of female mammals (including monotremes) that has not been pasteurized and that provides the primary source of nutrition for newborn mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. <br>  <br>  Edgar Dsouza<br>  Sr Lecturer<br>  IIAS

c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	My parents were the same way; very abusive towards it.  I won't even bother getting into the details.<br>  <br>  But the answer is this:  parents are people; people have certain notions and ideas in their heads; people generally choose to live in ignorance of the world around them; people generally are sheep following the herd.  So, you come along and after many years of them feeding you one way, you decide that their way of feeding  you all these years was wrong, and that you are 'above' eating this way because it is morally wrong and unhealthy to eat that way.<br>  <br>  So, put yourself in their shoes, what would you do if your kid did that?  Well, you'd stand up for yourself and say, "hey, there's nothing wrong with the way I've been raising you... you have been fine for your whole life and suddenly you decide that it's not good enough for you?  You've been healthy; everyone else eats like this..." and on and on... bla bla bla.  So, your parents are just regular everyday humans... okay.  Most everyday humans are not *thinkers* and are not trying to follow idealisms or the moral right etc.  They just go to work, watch TV, do what they are told to do, because life is *easier* this way.  Do what the companies and media and government tells you to do, and all is okay in the world.  Then you come along and take pin to their little bubble and try to burst it.  They know animals are abused and slaughtered and raised from birth in a cage and have no life and are fed pellets instead of real food, etc. etc.  They know this, but do not want to think about it.  Why?  Because that would make life more difficult and they have enough on their minds already with work and bills and children and crap.<br>  <br>  So, when your parents act childish and start saying stupid things, just chill, don't let them get to you, stay rational, don't argue, just use the facts, or say nothing at all until they have calmed down.  Or treat them like a child and very calmly and maturely say, "I'm not going to talk to you when you are in such a mood." "If all you are going to do is insult me, maybe you should just keep these words to yourself." "Maybe you should take a time out in order to calm down and gather your thoughts into something more coherent and rational." "You are letting your emotions get the better of you."  You know, stuff like that -- always turn the tables back on them.  I always answer their questions with other questions.  "Where do you get your protein?" -- "I don't know, where *do* I get my protein?"  You must get them to explain themselves, and the more you get them to do that, the more they just put their foot in their mouths.  It's better than constantly defending yourself, make them back up their own words.<br>  <br>  No mammal needs milk beyond the breastfeeding stage.  Humans are mammals.  We are also herbivores (more like fruitavores; as chimps are), thus we do not need meat.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	some hippies go to college to be doctors get a second opion<br>  <br>  and check this out it may help you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYOu-0Xg..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYOu-0Xg...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvvgskt-_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvvgskt-_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petakillsanimals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petakillsanimals.com/</a>|`|VmgdGYRPaa	You need to be sure you are getting all of your ameno acids.

Really, it's just your mother being annoying and refusing to understand why you are vegan. Whether it's the "Why do you think God put them here?" or "how else would we control the population of animals--look at all the stray pets that die aimlessly at shelters!" excuse, your parents most likely are skipping over the fact that the free-range, family-oriented farms that existed while they grew up are no longer so friendly.<br>  <br>  Maybe this will help: I actually got in an argument with my father today because I have become vegan, and after 5 years of no meat he still didn't understand. We sat there a while, and I told him all I've read, experienced, research, and seen. He didn't know that dairy cows and chickens went to slaughter, and were in foods such as pot pies and soups, which makes sense of why the meat is so crappy in those. He also thought that as a vegan/vegetarian, I meant to influence others into not eating meat. While I myself will never support the use of animals, I know most religions and normal people still do not understand this: these are my parents. They argued with me that "how do you know plants don't feel pain?" Indeed, plants to have stimuli when broken or cut. But I posed this scenario: if they are correct in saying that I cause pain or simple discomfort in killing plants and am simply a hypocrite, then I say this: The difference is that at least plants are not grown and abused their entire lives before being harvested, nor is their pain proven to be prolonged. Plants are also meant to be stationary, animals ARE NOT...they deserve to walk, play, nurse, nest. Plants are allowed to grow naturally whist animals have this freedom taken away the moment they are born. Factory farms, veal farms, chicken houses, etc. hold animals that are never allowed to socially or emotionally or physically interact normally; they caused pain not only their entire lives (in many cases), but they see pain in death as well.|`|ubukt8WWaa	You don't need to eat meat, but you do need to eat a good variety of healthy food.

Being a vegan can take a little extra work to make sure you eat a good variety of healthy foods.  <br>  <br>  If you're doing all the right things, and you are at a healthy weight, then your mom is just having a hard time accepting it.

Here are a bunch of red wines that I highly recommend, although we do not know what you are serving for dinner:<br>  <br>  Every one of these wines are less than $25.  Most are $15 or less:<br>  <br>  Malbec is very good, if you like Merlot and it's often overlooked.  Here are three:<br>  Don Rodolfo<br>  Gascon<br>  Viu Manent<br>  <br>  Pinot Noir - this is a little lighter, but you'll find the Faraon stands up well to red meat:<br>  Faraon<br>  Castle Rock<br>  Buena Vista<br>  <br>  Zinfandel - an excellent, smooth, easy drinking wine:<br>  Joel Gott<br>  R&B<br>  Pedroncelli<br>  Bogle<br>  <br>  Cabernet<br>  Robert Mondavi<br>  Lockwood<br>  Sebastiani<br>  <br>  Merlot:<br>  Bogle<br>  Beaucanon<br>  Francisan<br>  <br>  <br>  If you can find this wine - it's about $25 and EXCELLENT:<br>  Allegrini Amarone - one of the best reds I've had for the money<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Go with Layer Cake Zin.<br>  About $15 and it drinks like a $25 or $30 bottle.<br>  We can't get enough of it to sell in our store.<br>  Best bang for the money without question.<br>  ( you can buy 2 which makes it all the better).|`|Saul1Bhuaa	The Cambiata winery from Monterey, California makes an incredible wine from the tannat grape.

It's a little too tannic for my taste, but quite tasty.<br>  <br>  The Layer Cake Zinfandel referenced above is flying off the shelves.  It's VERY fruit-forward, but a good bargain at $15.|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	Go for a Merlot, it is softer to drink.

(Note, mixture will foam).<br>  Combine sugar and corn syrup in large saucepan. Place both  saucepans over high heat. Cook, stirring alternately until foam disappears from fruit pectin mixture and sugar mixture boils rapidly for 5 minutes.  Pour fruit pectin mixture into boiling sugar mixture in a thin stream until all pectin is added. Boil, stirring constantly 1 minute longer. Remove pan from heat. Stir in extract and a few drops of coloring. Immediately pour mixture into and 8x8x2 inch pan. For fancier shapes spoon mixture into tart or similar little pans. Allow to stand at room temperature (do NOT refrigerate) about 3 hours or until candy is cool and firm. Cut gum drop mixture into fancy shapes with small cutters or into cubes with a knife dipped in warm water.

5zNwBQZHaa	Gelatinization has nothing to do with Jello or gelatin.<br>  <br>  Gelatinization is the process that we take a starch (like flour or cornstarch) and it to a liquid for the purpose of thickening that liquid.  The starch absorbs the water and gets bigger.  The starch with the liquid changes consitancy from dry powder to a soft thick mass.<br>  <br>  Good examples of gelatinization in cooking include using flour, cornstarch or arrow root to make a gravy.  Or using any of those to thicken the broth in a stew.  <br>  <br>  So any recipe for gravy that uses a starch to thicken it - is an example of gelatinization.  Here is one example for your homework:  <a href="http://www.gretchencooks.com/recipes/668_Basic_Gravy" rel="nofollow">http://www.gretchencooks.com/recipes/668...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

53giV6PFaa	Turkey bacon is lower in fat and you can get more out of a single serving.  However, turkey bacon is also higher in sodium than regular bacon and tastes horribly.  So I prefer regular bacon, just use it in moderation.<br>  <br>  I found this very interesting:<br>  <br>  David Zinczenko, author of Eat This, Not That  has this in his book about the salt content of Turkey bacon.  Both kinds of bacon are 70 calories and 6 grams of fat per serving. But you get 25 percent more sodium with the turkey bacon--a whopping 360 milligrams of salt.<br>  <br>  So stick with regular bacon in moderation.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	I actually prefer turkey bacon to pork bacon bc it is lighter and less fatty parts, less chewy weird things.

hT7BhNamaa	Meeeee, tigerlil, is fully correct with regards to the impersonation of a member of law enforcement. Going on experience, the police take a very dim view of this, due to many incidents recently of impersonation. Go directly to the party, but make sure you were one of those trench coats, and the same on the return journey home.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be scrooge.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|q5BkV27Daa	Technically you could be done for impersonating a police officer, unless you go as a sexy police woman with fish nets and a mini skirt etc. Years ago a friend of mine went to a pub fancy dress as a policeman, and got arrested. However, he was directing traffic at the time :)|`|bNcL4RfZaa	Yes.  Policewomen are part of a police force.|`|kdBOxbX7aa	personally dont see why not, <br>  <br>  but am sure you would hate to turn up as a policewoman if every one else at party is turning up as a soldier/sailor etc|`|syKIxX45aa	Only if the police in your country are part of the armed forces, but I doubt they are.

kCu6Him8aa	I had a sweet craving today and I used it to inspire my lunch. I took a whole wheat pita and made a sandwich with Fruity Salsa and Light Cream Cheese. Fruity Salsa is a great replacement for jelly. Try Mango, Pineapple, Peach or something similar. It might sound awkward, but is really good. <br>  <br>  Nothing wrong with fruit! Try something really juicy or a banana.<br>  <br>  Make some jello or get the pre-packaged jello cups. Go for the sugar-free kind to save on some calories.<br>  <br>  If you can spare more calories, go for the pudding. Pudding made with skim milk is not TERRIBLE for you.<br>  <br>  Frozen Fruit pops made with real fruit... not the artificial stuff.<br>  <br>  Fat-free or Low-Fat yogurt. They make all sorts of sweet flavors to satisfy your craving.<br>  <br>  Low-fat cottage cheese with crushed pineapple. <br>  <br>  Cinnamon-Apple Sauce.<br>  <br>  Add some Crystal Light to your water (not all the time though, only a couple times a day) or add in some flavored water throughout the day.<br>  <br>  PS- don't be scared to fall back every once in awhile. Don't deprive yourself. If you've been doing good, take a small slice of cake, a single doughnut, a small bowl of icecream... whatever. As long as you're really following the diet and you have a work-out regimen, your body can take it. Good luck, and keep up the spirits! You don't have to kill yourself to be healthy.|`|hLohtlPEaa	raisins|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Sugar free jello.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Oh, well Golden Spoon frozen yogurt is GREAT!

Kxwyy0Eaaa	Skippy Natural does have some oil in it, but it doesn't separate the way other natural peanut butters do. Personally, I like the natural ones better as they taste better.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Smucker's all natural is great.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	No, unfortunately the oil is what makes them smooth and creamy and causes them not to seperate out like that....sorry

XjtzNJEUaa	If you are old enough to remember the 10 cents deposit returnable glass bottles, then here is what you probably don't think of like many people, those bottles cost the grocery stores a lot of money in man hours to pay workers for handling and sorting those bottles out for return to each different cola distributor.<br>  <br>  Those 10 cents deposit returnable glass bottles were the main containers sold in the cola industry. Can were a lot more expensive and the disposable plastic bottles like the 2 liter bottles were unheard of at that time.<br>  <br>  It took up considerable space to store the 10 cents deposit returnable glass bottles while waiting to be returned too.<br>  <br>  That cost was absorbed by the grocery store owners, and I doubt that they are wanting to do that again for cans now.<br>  <br>  I would imagine the grocery store associations are against it and have lobbyist working on their behalf.|`|X0E5vGftaa	These states do not really have anything that any other state does not already have. In fact they rip off the consumers.<br>  <br>  Other states do recycling too. Many residential areas have recycling as part of trash pick up. If not or even if they do people can still take there stuff to a recycling center. Since it is so wide spread it usually does not pay any longer. But many states even back in the 70's and 80's would still pay people to bring in recyclables.<br>  <br>  As far as rip off states like CA, and NY and the others listed on the bottles go. They charge you up front for the cans and bottles for what they pay you to turn it in. so realistically when you get a refund you don't make any money. After all you already paid that much more than your neighboring states. If you don't recycle what you buy then you paid the recycling fee for nothing. In other words you paid extra to not recycle.<br>  <br>  The thing that further irks me is that these states not only charge you up front but then they make you go out of your way to recycle them. Move away from these retarded liberal states and into a real state where your community will pick up recyclables on trash day.

5de7dedaa4d56e7cb43938bd89d0e068aa	I think i know what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  I was visiting my boyfriends' friend in London and was offered this fruit,  It's been a while, can't remember what it look like.  All I remember was it did NOT look like a lemon, but it sure as anything smells like lemon and taste like lemon and it was SWEET.  You know, like oranges where you get really sweet ones.  It was so weird and freak me out a bit as my brain couldn't handle the fact a lemon would taste sweet.  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong the fruit taste lovely but just weird, different, out of scope weird.|`|SJLgRqgSaa	no you cant :) xx|`|4SRrWBVZaa	Don't know sorry but it sound wicked i want one now :-)|`|dtLpleTMaa	dont know, but you can get yellow plumbs if that helps|`|Lsy6sNPCaa	i never heard of that
