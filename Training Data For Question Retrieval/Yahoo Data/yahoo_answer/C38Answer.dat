Why should two people stay married, if circumstances indicate abuse, etc.) Since it is normally the primary responsibility of the mother to raise the child, I believe that it should be hers, and hers alone, decision to have an abortion or not. Of course, abstinence and protection are the best approaches to avoiding this situation; but, we all know that "things happen" and we have to go to Plan B.

(your question.. not you). Life does not work like that. Of course it is totally possible to be "pro choice" AND anti "partial birth" abortion.   Explanation.. the legality of abortion has been ruled on by the Supreme court. This means that the Constitution protects the right of a woman to determine HER definition. You have the anti abortion persons who define abortion as murder, but that is a personal view and NOT the legal definition. Do I support or promote abortion? No. I support the law and the authority of the Supreme court. I don't impose my view on others.   The partial birth hysteria comes down to an attempted distortion against Obama. If you do your homework.. the state of Illinois already had laws concerning this situation, when someone attempted to pass new legislation that would have been in conflict with the original law, and led to disputes over the intent. Thinking from a legislative view.. it is pure stupidity to have 2 laws on the same topic, when those laws would lead to court disputes. THAT IS WHY HE VOTED AGAINST the second proposed law. NOT because he promotes "partial birth abortion" or letting babies die. NO doctor would allow such a thing to happen. A child born alive would get treatment.   Please be careful of internet sites who give false information, and attempt to manipulate your thinking.|`|6ZD4w5Yyaa	Why would you care? Is it your baby being aborted? Why is this your business?|`|lVdyjaiRaa	Yesssssssssss    those babies have the ability to RECOGNIZE SPEECH BEFORE THEY'RE BORN!

It's actually called an 'intact dilation and extraction' and was used in less than 0.2% of terminations - about 1,700 in every million.    This issue was used as a wedge for the Republican party to win votes - when in fact, this was simply an interference in the management of a woman's health.    No doctor WANTS to use this procedure; and no mother wants it done. It was only ever used in emergency situations.    The fact is, the fetus is NOT able to sustain life outside the womb at this point - if it were, no doctor could have performed this procedure.|`|DBIKou8faa	Yes, it is.|`|AA10546011	It's "okay" to be a Democrat and be for or against anything.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Absolutely.    Partial birth abortions are a very controversial procedure, which are hardly ever preformed.

It's a free country after all!    I myself am a Democrat and I am pro-choice. But I do think it's going to far with partial abortions unless the mother's life is on the line.|`|VrjF986Aaa	sure you can have any beliefs you want to|`|Pxf5VvIUaa	i am pro choice and against partial abortions.|`|oojO4WAraa	You can be anything you want.      You don't really understand partial birth abortion if you are thinking people have them like birth control.  There are no doctors that perform partial birth abortions just because someone doesn't want to be pregnant.  Partial birth abortions are done for medical reasons.|`|7zf05NWsaa	No you can't.  And if's it's the womans womb then you also have to be able to say it's the womans body and "she can do what she wants"  Murder is murder, no matter what way it happens.    You obviously have a brain to even realize partial birth abortion is murder, please, USE it for a greater good.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	You can be against anything you want, this IS America.  If someone don't want an abortion, DON'T GET ONE.  If someone is getting an abortion, IT IS NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS.|`|B9QDJOxCaa	Yes, absolutely. Abortion is a complicated issue; it's obvious the child has to become a "person" at some point, so if you believe it happens at, say, 24 weeks (which is the cut-off point for abortions in the UK), then it's perfectly reasonable to say that's when it becomes murder and so that's when it becomes not ok.    I'm kind of the same. I don't know, scientifically, when a foetus becomes a human, and personally I don't know if I could have an abortion past about 12 weeks. But I don't think the government has any business making that decision for us; if there's no real consensus on when a foetus becomes a human then why should they decide, and if there is, like with 24 weeks in the UK, then there's your obvious cut-off point legally.   But like I said, it's complicated, no one knows the answer, which is why it's perfectly intellectually sound to have a nuanced or even slightly contracdictory position on this.|`|MGvN5xrNaa	In both early-term and later-term abortions, you're still killing an unborn baby. It's just that the baby is slightly more developed when you do a partial birth abortion than at the early-term abortions (but even at the early-term, the baby is perfectly formed).    No, I don't think you can be for early abortions, but against partial-birth abortions. They are both  excruciatingly horrible and the unborn baby dies in both procedures.    A woman may have the right to do what she does with her body, but the fact is, the unborn baby is not a part of a woman's body! It is a separate human being and the woman should have no right to kill that baby!

MDYZIgwCaa	"The local adoption and foster council went to court four times to have the children permanently removed and adopted, but each time the court ruled in favor of the grandparents."    "With this in mind, the social work department has deliberately ignored evidence which undermines their decision and opted for politically correct posturing rather than providing stability and protection."    LOL! How is that politically correct? Both grandparents are young enough to take the children into their home. The children are biologically related to both grandparents. The children love the grandparents. The politically correct thing to do would be to leave the children in the care of the grandparents.    If you ask me, it looks like both the social work department and the court are trying to go out of their way to prove that homosexuals can provide stability and a proper family.

oyVZG8Zbaa	I don't think cigs are a good idea.  Most people don't smoke anymore and a lot of the ones who do are probably thinking about quitting.  I know I am.    Beware of gold and silver as well.  There is a reasonably good chance that their high prices are just another bubble caused by people desperate for a safe place to put their money.  If you compare the rapid drop in commodities like oil, copper, milk, etc... to the rapid rise in silver and gold you will see a definite pattern.  They occurred almost simultaneously.  On the other hand, even if it is a bubble, the burst probably won't be nearly as catastrophic.  Silver and gold will always be reasonably valuable.    I like the idea of alcohol.  Unlike cigarettes, almost everybody drinks-especially when they are despondent.  Alcohol has historically been one of the most traded and sought after commodities in times of strife.    Batteries are definitely a good idea.  So are candles.  Buy enough to trade and to use.    Stock up on food, but don't look at it as something to trade.  It should just be for you and your loved ones.  A good, if expensive, target would be to have enough food to sustain a 2,000 calorie/day diet for 60 days.    If you are really looking for something that would fetch top dollar, and your conscience will allow it, buy baby formula and baby food.  People with an infant will be willing to trade pretty much anything for it.|`|N3S9S1joaa	One top commodity would be guns and ammo.|`|ARaOShgzaa	Make sacrifices and make sure you saved enougn cash for six months emergency.

You can't eat it, it doesn't keep you warm, it may even make you a target. Due to the Dem's bailout plan I would stock up on food guns and ammo. In bad times bullets, and food, will out-value gold.

gasquENMaa	A probation violation is considered a "no bond" hold, meaning you already have been sentenced in a court of law, been given a chance while on probation and for whatever reason, violated yourself. What will happen now is you will sit in the county jail until you receive a violation hearing, The law says they have 270 days ( 9 months) to deal with TPO's, but as a realistic figure, you can figure an average of a month.     As far as when you would be released, that would depend entirely on the outcome of the hearing. Worst case scenario is reinstatement of your sentence. Whatever your original sentence was would then be served and you would be free and clear upon release. Best case scenario would be reinstatement of probation.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you  Source(s):  5 years with the Sheriff's Department and 20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison

Like if there are major wars or more troops are needed they usually dip into the reserves.    The Army National Guard is part of the United States Army, comprising approximately one half of its available combat forces and approximately one third of its support organization.    Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the U.S. Army and are expected to adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their "full-time" Federal counterparts. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The National Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in a service member's home state.    National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state or territory in which they serve (in the case of Washington DC, the Commanding General). Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually, except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments (TDY). However, there has been a significant amount of individual activations to support ongoing military operations related to the Global War on Terrorism (beginning in 2001); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard.      National Guard members and reservists now comprise a larger percentage of frontline fighting forces than in any war in U.S. history (about 43 percent in Iraq and 55 percent in Afghanistan). There are now 183,366 National Guard members and reservists on active duty nationwide who leave behind about 300,000 dependents, according to U.S. Defense Department statistics.    Traditionally, most National Guard personnel serve "One weekend a month, two weeks a year", although a significant number serve in a full-time capacity, in a role called Active Guard and Reserve, or AGR. AGR's basically take care of things during the week while the "One weekend a month, two weeks a year" personnel are working at their civilian jobs. The "one weekend a month" slogan has lost most of its relevance since the Iraq War, when up to 40% of total US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan consisted of mobilized personnel of the reserve components.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Read all about it here:    http://www.ngb.army.mil/default.aspx|`|F2XxqlVfaa	your affraid of the army national gaurd?????? relax if he joins he would have to train first (non active duty) by the time he gets done training the war will be over|`|mlLnk1Vaaa	first of all you need to chill out...and second, it always depends with the military....they could get shipped anywhere.  why don't you just ask him to get some information about it?|`|dlxl8y5qaa	Im not really sure about it but if its what he wants you have to respect it... u dont own him|`|wigtXCBTaa	Congratulations and thank you and your bf.

This will be about a 4-6 month period of not being able to see him, you can write to him daily and he has a few minutes to write too. If money is what your boy friend is looking for, tell him to consider joining the air force reserves. That is the best deal, my brother joined that, he just went to Texas for his boot camp about 1 month ago, he has about 3 months left. You get benefits, good pay and after boot camp, you are done.

From here he will have to get training for what he wants to be. From there he will have a choice of 2 or 3 places he can reide in. This is not a good time to join at all. It is tough work.

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Two reasons: What they bring in, and what they take away.<br>  <br>  What they take away are jobs. Globalization means you go anywhere in the world where you can find the cheapest labour. That means workers in a community are actually in competition with workers from around the globe. And in practice, this means low-skill/no-skill jobs are fleeing to the developing countries. Whole communities have been uprooted and destroyed by this.<br>  <br>  What they bring in is a bland uniformity of services. There used to be smaller, local businesses in communities. Each community had its own shops and restaurants, theaters, etc, etc. And now they have massive international chain stores. Instead of the little tea-shop, you have Starbucks. Instead of the local store, you have WalMart.<br>  <br>  Local flavor is being lost in the trend toward mass merchandising.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

YjhlhUzVaa	The Marine Corps Recon Battalions are separate from MARSOC.  MARSOC is U.S. Special Forces comprised of U.S. Marines only.    1.  Officer's command recon platoons, companies, and battalions.  Enlisted members make up the majority of the entire military.  You have to have a college degree to become an officer.    2.  No, you don't have to be infantry to 'try out' for recon, but your MOS monitor has to be willling to release you into recon if you are selected; if you are in a highly technical or short staffed job you won't be released to recon.  Officers learn not only how to operate as infantry men but how to lead infantry men in combat.    3.  Amphibious Reconnaissance School (ARS) is a school that Recon and MARSOC members go through.    4.  Boot Camp, SOI, BRC, Airborne (basic and Military Freefall) Jumpmaster, Pathfinder, Ranger, Scout-Sniper, Combat Diver (SCUBA) Diving Supervisor, Mountain warfare & assault climber, Jungle operations, specialized training in urban tactics, Close Quarters Battle & shooting skills, demolitions, communications, photography, controlling aircraft landing operations and directing Airstrikes, Naval Gunfire and Artillery.    5.  Ranger school is an Army school, but yes Marine Corps officers and enlisted are regularly sent to the school.    I would sign up for ROTC at your school if it's offered and think hard about whether you want to go to college first and become an officer or if you want to enlist right away.  In the USMC there is no guarantee you'll make RECON, so keep that in mind.  Life as an infantryman will be very tough and often times very boring.    One of the best things you can do is to get yourself in top physical condition and stay that way.  Any recon, ranger, or special forces program will be highly competitive and the screening will be very physically intense.  You also have to have a high physical fitness test score to be accepted into any officer program.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Ok I'm not a Marine yet, but i know these answers because I've talked with many of them (plus Rangers and SF).  The officers go through the schools too.. leader should always know what it's like for his men.  It's good to be infantry and then do Recon.  Eh read the other posts, there's a few different things they do.  Yea Marines can go through Ranger school, and often do. I know a Scout/Sniper who graduated on top out of all the Marines and Army guys there.  Green Berets are SF, like a step above Rangers.  MARSOC is separate from Recon i think.|`|C7wjR42Daa	It's hard to explain these things if you do not know how they work. It will just confuse you more.    My advice to you is this..    Figure out first if you want to be enlisted or officer. Judging by your question you have no idea how different these two things are. And for some reason todays generation feels they can be either or.     In reality we are made to be one or the other and not both. Don't choose officer because you get more money or live better, choose it because it is where you best fit in. Don't choose officer because you get to do this or that. Choose it because it is where you best fit into. Don't chase things,  let them come naturally.    Read here about officers and enlisted..  http://buzzcut23.blogspot.com/2008/12/of...    Recon is not special ops..You do not have to be infantry to get into Recon, but it would be in your best interest to be an 0300 Marine...
g22PY2tgaa	Thats a good question, I also live in MI and wondered the same thing myself.  A couple of friends of mine have had a similar situation but it was the assessor trying to re-assess after there home was completed.  As far as I know, they can only assess your property on what is included in the building plans on file at the city.  I believe they are not allowed to come into your home, nor should you let them, in order to assess.  I believe there is also a 2% cap on yearly assessable values.<br>  <br>  I'll be interested in knowing how this pans out, sorry i counldnt be more help, good luck!

The judge then defers the case and places the defendant on supervised release. deferred disposition is when the judge sets certain requirements. When the defendant meets those requirements, he can dismiss the case.|`|EGFXMgVzaa	Deferred adjudication means that the judge hasn't entered a ruling, and will not enter one as long as his criteria are met (anger management classes, AA, driving school, etc)<br>  <br>  Deferred disposition means that the defendant has been found guilty (either by trial or admission of guilt) and that the case will be held in abeyance subject to certain criteria being met (completing the above mentioned programs, for example).|`|bXqGa139aa	They are more than likely are the exact same thing. It depends on where you are. Deferred Adjudication is a form of probation. The judge may hear the facts of the case, depending on the level of offense, and you enter a plea, either guilty or no contest (some judges may require a guilty plea), the judge then sets out a list of conditions that must be met over a set amount of time. If you successfully complete the term of “probation”, the case is dismissed, without a conviction. If not, it’s a short trip to a conviction as you have already entered a guilty or no contest plea to the charge. If you disappear, what is called abscond, you might not even be aware the “probation” has been revoked and an arrest warrant issued. <br>   <br>  Deferred Disposition is almost always the exact same thing, only worded different. But, it may also be another name for actual probation. The guilty verdict is handed down and a sentence stated, but the punishment (in this case, the disposition) is deferred and the person is placed on probation with a set term and list of conditions. If the conditions are successfully met, the sentence is not carried out. I have only heard of post-conviction probation referred to as Deferred Disposition a few times.

This war is no less dangerous than the foes we faced in WWII. Nazis and radical Islam hate Jews and want to wipe them off the planet, we are fighting against the same hate-fueled ideology.

vY7WdFQUaa	Pues claro que sí, porque la sociedad nunca es unitaria, y en ningún colectivo vas a encontrar una unanimidad total de ideas, lo que pasa es que los políticos catalanes y sus ideas representan a lo mejor la idea de  un 20 o 30% de los catalanes, pues fíjate que poquitos, pero da igual, porque si el otro 80 o 70%, superior en número desde luego, sigue aborregadito y calladito, pues ya sabes que en democracia, el que calla otorga, y si no hacen absolutamente nada por cambiar, echar o jubilar a los que tienen, pues seguirán saliendo. Y además te digo una cosa, en la regiones con ideas más independentistas, a mucha gente la oyes decir, pero hasta en encuestas de esas que se hacen por la tele: "no, si yo no estoy de acuerdo con los nacionalistas, pero si salen ellos, y me cae algo a mí...."

Yo te lo explicaré: los políticos catalanes son criados aparte desde que son ni?os en unos centros de alto rendimiento político en los que se procura que no entren en contacto con la ciudadanía. Y nos tienen enga?ados a todos los catalanes que les votamos con participaciones electorales del 80% porque somos bobos, cretinos y, lo que es peor, he oido que dicen que somos catalanes.|`|IB2RQIOAaa	? los politicos piensan ?  mmmmm.....|`|dSBuAEq9aa	Algunos si y otros no, como en todos lados...|`|J9yl3BXKaa	La gente tiene un concepto de los catalanes muy equivocados. <br>  En el resto de Espa?a os pensais que todos queremos ser independientes, cuando la verdad, es que es una gran minoria la que se siente independiente. <br>  Piensa que somos muchisimos los que tenemos familia de fuera de Catalu?a, en mi caso toda mi familia es andaluza, y la mayoria nos sentimos espa?oles, tenemos costumbres espa?olas, hablamos espa?ol y en fin... nos consideramos espa?oles. Y te lo digo sabiendo lo que digo, porque soy catalana (ante todo espa?ola) y se lo que veo a diario. <br>  En cambio, los politicos, solo defienden lo que ellos piensan que es correcto, aunque realmente van equivocados... <br>  Catalu?a no es una nacion, es una comunidad de Espa?a y pese a quien le pese siempre sera asi. Con esto solo te quiero decir que los politicos no piensan para nada como los ciudadanos, ni miran lo que nos conviene a la mayoria, sino a los catalanes cerrados.<br>  Te voy a poner un ejemplo muy claro, yo aun siendo catalana y estar sufriendo de cerca esta sequia que hay ultimamente en catalu?a, reconozco que los catalanes son muy interesados cuando les conviene... dicen que ellos son independientes, y que no tienen nada que ver con Espa?a, pero para pedir agua a otras comunidades no les importa ser espa?oles no?<br>  A veces me produce verguenza convivir con gente asi, ya que defienden unas ideas estupidas y egoistas, que no todos compartimos, pero a la hora de la verdad, cuando necesitan ayuda de los "espa?oles" no dudan en pedirla... <br>  No se porque se molestan, si segun ellos los espa?oles son unos fachas y se averguenzan de ellos. <br>  <br>  En fin... que son unos interesados... ojo! no digo los catalanes, sino los catalanes cerrados e independentistas.<br>  <br>  Suerte :D|`|fTuFx3Heaa	Pues "Psicóloga" tiene mucha razón por no decir toda.<br>  <br>  El ejemplo mas claro lo tienes en Montilla. Un político cordobés que cuando le interesa es muy espa?ol (ver tema agua) pero cuando le da la gana y para contentar a ciertos sectores se convierte en el tio mas nacionalista de todos (ejemplos los hay a montones).<br>  <br>  En general al político le interesa poco el ciudadano.

bXqGa139aa	I want to tell you and your husband congratulations. It is one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world. I'm not married to one, but my wife is. I know first-hand what he is in for. My advice is to stay where you are. You cannot “go” with him. It is very similar to military boot camp. You could move to Austin, but you wont get to see him during the week and Austin is very expensive. His time will be very, very strained during the week, but he will have every weekend off, which will not be the case once he graduates.  Toward the end of the academy, he will be given a list of options of where he would “like” to be stationed. He may be able to get at least one of the locations he lists on his “dream sheet”. That is to give him and his family the time, before graduation, to go the town and find a place to live. Sometimes, it is not feasible to uproot the whole family to move to a town that they know that don’t want to live. He is required to be there a year before putting in for a transfer. <br>  <br>  My advice is to consider your husband has a job that takes him away during the week, but home on weekends. That’s is what it will be, even if you lived a cross the street from the academy. He will be under a lot of stress, which he might bring home with him on Friday. Be supportive eventhough you dont quite understand. I was told the academy time was harder on her, I believe, at times, it was. I hope he realizes this too. <br>  <br>  The academy has changed unbelievably in the past 20 years, less strenuous, but longer. Either way, there are hurdles you both will face. You both need to understand you are both going through the training. It may test parts of your relationship. But I promise, it will be well worth it!<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail if you have any additional questions you are not comfortable posting. Very best of luck to you both!|`|NSNnRmpVaa	TX DPS is in no other terms a 26 week "bootcamp"..!! Your husband will be expected to adhere to a very rigorous schedule...don't expect to much more from him than just "getting through" it..!! <br>  This site may help you a bit:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TXBasicAcademy/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TXBasicAca...</a>|`|OeEgfaFzaa	I dont know the answer to your question but just wanted to say good luck.  The police academy can be a difficult time of separation and your husband is probably going to be a bit stressed.  However, apparently you have it a lot better than we do here because here there is no option for the spouse to go stay with them.  Here you are gone for 18 weeks straight and you must remain on the grounds of the campus the during the week (except for training that takes you off campus).  You can come home on weekends but you get home late Friday night and have to leave Sunday afternoon to go back.  <br>  Its good that you apparently have the option to go with him if you want to.  Bear with it once he gets through it he will feel wonderful as it is a big achievement.

O gayzsimo (movimento gay), como praticamente a totalidade dos ditos “movimentos sociais” (******, feministas, etc), está aparelhado pelas esquerdas, é ima tática gramisciana que procura exacerbar a “luta de classes” (mais um mito esqeurdista). Quanto ao movimento gay, em especial., há um grande contingente gay no mundo artístico (é uma espécie de “gueto”) e muitos deles se dedicam a divulgar o gayzismo com o objetivo de fazer com que a sociedade creia que ser gay é natural e que, no fundo, todos somos gays, com isto eles aumentam as possibilidades de conquista. Outro ponto interessante: quando mostram o quanto somos preconceituosos (n?o temos conceitos, só preconceitos) visam com isto criar um clima propício para que eles consigam n?o serem tratados como iguais, mas sim terem benefícios que o comum dos mortais (o hetero) n?o tem. Isto vale também para os ****** e as feministas. A tentativa da aprova??o da lei anti-homofóbica e o estatudo de igualdade racial s?o provas cabais disto. Além, é claro, da já arpovada “lei Maria da Penha”. Como n?o sou mulher, n?o sou ***** e n?o sou gay, sou um cidad?o de 2a.

f41128ffe659728d370f4af0861ac7e9aa	Paranhos,<br>  <br>  Meu amigo o direito a pivacidade deveria ser absoluto sim!<br>  <br>  Direito à privacidade n?o é absoluto, diz jurista <br>   <br>  O presidente do Instituto de Direito Civil, Gustavo Tepedino, afirmou na última quinta-feira (1/11) que o direito à privacidade é relativo, ou seja, embora assegurado pela Constitui??o Federal, n?o pode ser visto como um direito absoluto. <br>  <br>  A afirma??o foi feita durante mesa redonda no XXIV Encontro Nacional dos Procuradores da República.<br>  <br>  O evento reuniu especialistas em direito civil, constitucional e seguran?a pública em um debate sobre o “Acesso a Dados Telef?nicos e Direito à Privacidade: Pondera??o de Valores Constitucionais”. <br>  <br>  Segundo Tepedino, que também leciona na Uerj (Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro), tanto a Constitui??o quanto o Código Civil garantem o direito ao sigilo de dados e à privacidade.<br>  <br>  Entretanto, a intercepta??o de dados telef?nicos é um instrumento importante para a investiga??o e obten??o de provas de ilícitos principalmente os praticados por grupos organizados ou quadrilhas. <br>  <br>  Ainda assim, Tepedino lembrou que a maioria dos tribunais é contra a intercepta??o de dados para fins civis. <br>  <br>  De acordo com o professor, a intercepta??o de dados é mais comum nas investiga??es com fins penais. <br>  <br>  A diferen?a é que no caso das investiga??es com fins civis o objetivo é resgatar eventuais danos ao patrim?nio público, causado por desvios, sonega??es ou outras condutas irregulares. <br>  <br>  No caso das investiga??es com finalidade penal, o objetivo é a obten??o de provas de ilícitos visando a abertura de processo penal contra os acusados. <br>  <br>  Tepedino defende que a intercepta??o de dados seja admitida para fins civis em caráter excepcional. <br>  <br>  O professor criticou a legisla??o atual que permite que a intercepta??o seja feita pelo período máximo de 15 dias, prorrogáveis por mais 15. <br>  <br>  Para ele, esse tempo pode ser insuficiente para que o Ministério Público e a Polícia obtenham provas necessárias à instaura??o de inquérito ou apresenta??o da denúncia. <br>  <br>  Ainda assim, Tepedino ressalva que a autoriza??o para a realiza??o de escutas deve ser limitada a um período máximo definido por lei. <br>  <br>  As críticas e observa??es do professor foram acompanhadas pelo procurador Artur Gueiros, que também participou do debate. <br>  <br>  Gueiros vê deficiências na lei 9296/96, que regulamenta o uso da intercepta??o de dados. <br>  <br>  Segundo ele, a lei está ultrapassada, pois se limita à quest?o da intercepta??o de dados telef?nicos, sem considerar o fluxo de comunica??o em sistemas de informática e telemática. <br>  <br>  Um abra?o, Helda|`|b90f009697beacfc3fa13ceedeb2448baa	Antes de mais nada, gostaria de especificar que, em minha opini?o, no Brasil hoje o direito a privacidade e pura utopia.<br>  <br>  Por exemplo, se temos contas em bancos nossos dados viajam para destinos que nem imaginamos.<br>  <br>  Um exemplo: tenho conta em três bancos, depois da abertura delas passei por uma altera??o de assentamentos e corrigi o nome em dois dos bancos mas n?o no terceiro.<br>  <br>  Hoje recebo informativos e ofertas de associa??es e bandeiras de cart?es de credito que nunca tive interesse em conhecer, e algumas delas ainda vem com meu nome anterior, o que prova que meus dados, endere?o, etc est?o sendo divulgados ou vendidos por aquele banco especificamente.<br>  <br>  Quem quer que possua um telefone celular pode ser localizado em quest?o de instantes, pois no momento em que o celular recebe ou completa uma liga??o se conecta a torre mais próxima, informando sua posi??o.<br>  <br>  Dito isto, e lamentando a total falta de privacidade da qual somos todos vitimas, pessoalmente acho que um pouco mais de privacidade seria desejável, mas n?o acho que o direito a privacidade deva ser absoluto<br>  <br>  Nos casos de investiga??o por suspeita de crimes, e certo que as autoridades tenham acesso a todas as informa??es disponíveis.<br>  N?o questiono o fato que ainda assim n?o e fácil que justi?a seja feita, mas acho inútil criar ainda mais obstáculos para o correto e rápido andamento das investiga??es.|`|26F4bVjUaa	era pra c +.....|`|TUAmksaaaa	Dado que o direito a privacidade é um direito

judicial, o direito a privacidade poderia ser invadido, violando-se, portanto, o sigilo de comunica??o, nos casos de comunica??o telef?nica.<br>  <br>  Além disso, nos casos de participantes de reality shows, o direito a privacidade ou intimidade, pode ser temporariamente renunciado, ou seja, o participante, ao assinar o contrato(que em tese é ilegítimo), deixa que sua imagem seja utilizada de qualquer forma, e que sua privacidade seja violada.

Com vantagem principal ela é praticamente insonegável. Porém, esse aumento na alíquota deve ser compensado pela extin??o de outro imposto. Por exemplo.

N?o me importaria nem mesmo em recolher 10 ou 15% de tudo que gasto desde que esse fosse o IMPOSTO úNICO.

PEYbqFcIaa	O PROCON n?o é "justi?a", é só um órg?o que ajuda o consumidor e a empresa a entrarem em acordo e, n?o havendo acordo, ajuda a encaminhar as coisas para a justi?a.<br>  <br>  primeiríssimo, li: você já pagou? se n?o, é só entrar em contato com eles e pe?a providências, ou seja, que te enviem uma fatura com o valor correto para que vc possa efetuar o pagamento. <br>  abra um protocolo referente à sua reclama??o (tem que pedir, sen?o eles n?o d?o. diga "eu quero um número de protocolo para esta reclama??o que eu estou fazendo" e n?o desligue enquanto n?o te passarem um número). anote, tb, nome completo de todo mundo que te atender, as informa??es que foram passadas, horário e data das suas liga??es.<br>  eles n?o poder?o te cobrar nenhuma espécie de juros por vc n?o ter pago (afinal, a fatura veio com o valor errado). por nada no mundo pague o boleto, pq daí tem que brigar um monte até eles te devolverem o seu dinheiro (v?o ficar te enrolando, com certeza). daí a importancia de NUNCA, JAMAIS, DEIXAR ESSE TIPO DE CONTA EM DéBITO AUTOMáTICO (é por isso, inclusive, que eles nos "incentivam" a adotar esse método de pagamento, cobrando para emitir boletos, etc, coisa que, lógico, é ilegal).<br>  <br>  se você já pagou a conta, antes de entrar no PROCON, também tem que entrar em contato com a empresa. você vai ter que fornecer informa??es a respeito desse contato ao pessoal do PROCON. <br>  outra coisa, o PROCON é muito bom mas é um saco, viu? quando você vai lá, sempre tem fila, demora um monte. daí, um funcionário vai escrever uma carta oficial do PROCON para a empresa, na sua frente e com a sua ajuda, com todas as informa??es que vc der e com o seu pedido. daí, vc sai de lá com essa carta, que VOCê deverá colocar no correio, e aguardar contato da empresa. ou seja, maior trampo.<br>  mas é bom fazer, pq, se eles n?o solucionarem o problema e vc quiser entrar com uma a??o (na justi?a - juizado especial cível, nem precisa de advogado) contra eles, é mais uma prova de que vc tentou resolver as coisas pacificamente. claro que, se as coisas chegarem nesse ponto, vc poderá, sim, pedir indeniza??o por danos morais (afinal, v perdeu tempo e se estressou por falha deles. daí a importancia de anotar o tempo que as liga??es duraram).<br>  <br>  de qualquer forma, quer saber uma coisa que resolve de verdade (rápido, prático e eficaz)? mandar um e-mail/carta para a folha de s?o paulo. no dia seguinte tem gente ligando para você para resolver a situa??o antes da publica??o no jornal. link: <a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/acidadeesua/reclamacao.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotid...</a><br>  <br>  claro que, assim, tem empresas que n?o ligam para isso... como a telefónica, por exemplo, recordista em reclama??es (como eles s?o monopolistas, vale a filosofia "que é um p e i d o para quem já está c a g a d o"). mas, daí, tb, é só na paciência - te que ficar pedindo, insistindo, falando com a ANATEL (ajuda, ás vezes) e, finalmente, entrar na justi?a.<br>  <br>  de qualquer forma, n?o deixe a coisa como está. se todos nós reclamássemos por cada centavo que eles nos tomam, ou nos cobram indevidamente, ou por cada ca.gada que eles fazem, eles iriam ser mais cuidadosos e menos desleixados. é nosso dever cívico reclamar, para que o consumidor de amanh? - que pode até ser você mesma - tenha um servi?o/produto/atendimento melhor.<br>  <br>  outro site que pode te ajudar com essas quest?es é o do IDEC (instituto de defesa do consumidor) - www.idec.org.br<br>  <br>  abra?os e muito boa sorte.|`|NVED0J1xaa	Acho melhor vc pegar o contrato e ir ao atendimento local deste provedor e mostrar o que esta acontecendo.

And it did nothing.<br>  Clinton Ignored Own Defense Secretary's Warning<br>  <br>  <br>  Clinton’s own secretary of defense, William Cohen, in a July 1999 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, predicted a terrorist attack on America’s mainland. Not only did the then-president do nothing, but the mainstream media "looked the other way,” alleges Horowitz.<br>  Liberal journalist Joe Klein reported on a close monitoring of the media. None of the major television networks or the elite press printed or uttered a word of it. The reaction among those who kept track of the way the media ignored an obvious blockbuster story was pure astonishment.<br>  <br>  <br>  The National Commission on Terrorism in 2000 "issued a report with the eerily foreboding image of the Twin Towers on its cover.”<br>  A bipartisan effort to attach the report’s findings to congressional intelligence legislation was stymied by left-wing Sen. Patrick "Leaky" Leahy, D-Vt. The senator said he feared a campaign against terrorism would threaten "civil liberties.”<br>  <br>  Watching Terrorists Isn't P.C.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vice President Al Gore’s commission to improve airline security degenerated into a focus on "racial profiling.” This, of course, diluted security measures in the face of terrorist threats from the Middle East and Asia. Seventeen of 19 Sept. 11 terrorists were fundamentalist extremists from the Middle East.<br>  <br>  In 1993, the FBI identified three "charities” connected to the terrorist organization Hamas. Clinton ignored pleas that he create a "President’s List” of extremist and terrorist groups. He feared the political fallout of "profiling” Islamic charities.<br>  <br>  By Clinton’s own account, Monica Lewinsky met him privately in the Oval Office a dozen times, but the head of the CIA could not get a single private meeting with the president after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.<br>  <br>  In 1996, while his own State Department was describing Osama bin Laden as "the greatest financier of terrorist projects around the world,” Clinton ignored an offer from the president of Sudan to arrest and extradite bin Laden and supply detailed intelligence data about global networks involving Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Hamas. Membership in these networks included two hijackers who piloted jetliners into the World Trade Center.<br>  Those are highlights.<br>  <br>  Clinton, writes Horowitz, did focus enough attention on intelligence services "to hamstring the intelligence services in the name of civil liberties, shrink the U.S. military, eliminate its ability to fight two wars at once, pursue massive experiments in the military where 'consciousness raising' and gender and diversity reform overshadowed the prime purpose of the military: provide the best defense of the nation."

IQfG1QS2aa	British soldier are primarly stationed in Southern Iraq around Basra which is virtually completly Shiite. The Shiite's along with the Kurds up North were brutally surpressed by Sadam, who favored his Sunni background. The Shiite's for the most part were happy to see Saddam go. Thus, there isn't as much violence.  The middle portion of Iraq, Baghdad, Balad, Ramadi, Falujah, are all melting pots of Sunni and Shiite's.

78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	Why is he unlicensed?  Is his license suspended or revoked?  Is he uninsured?  To me, the question whether she should get into a car with him is all about her safety and not about whether he has a license or not.  (There's also the issue of insurance and who would pay for her hospital care if he were in an accident with her in the vehicle.)  Can you sort out your negative feelings about him from this issue?  If you were married to him -- or still living with him -- would you mind if he drove her around then?  <br>  <br>  You've got to separate out your own anger and dislike from what is good for your daughter.  If your only concern is truly about the fact that he is driving without a license, perhaps you could solve the situation by offering to take her to see him and then pick her up.  <br>  <br>  Unless he's an unfit parent, she and he both need to see each other.  You should be glad that he wants to spend time with his daughter.  That's better than a lot of children have.  The way I see it, unless there is some reason he is unfit, you owe it to your daughter to try and see that she has as many good role model, involved adults in her life as possible.  You can help her by helping her to see him.  Don't whine and complain, either, it's not her fault.  <br>  <br>  You are the one who had a baby with this man, it wasn't her decision.  Then you are the one who got divorced, not her.  You should try to keep the consequences to her as minimal as possible and do everything you can to try and help her maintain relationships with the important adults in her life.  <br>  <br>  If he's a danger to your daughter or to public safety, that's a different matter.  If he's driving with a suspended license, you should submit an anonymous tip to the authorities.  If he's an alcoholic and that's why his license is suspended, or if you suspect he might be driving impaired, then that's another issue too.  <br>  <br>  Keep your own emotions and feelings out of it.  For G*d's sake, don't get into an argument with him and use it as a threat.  And don't try to use this as a weapon if there's no other reason.  You really must walk away from the anger and think about what is in your daughter's best interest.  Lack of a drivers license is such a small thing.  Surely you are creative enough to find a solution to this problem.  |`|KtdlJbrOaa	this is one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't situations.  You are right that he should not drive if he does not have a license, but if you don't allow court ordered visitation, you could be held in contempt of court.  I would do 4 things - ask myself if my child was really in danger when she goes for her weekends with him.  I would also ask myself how a scene with the police could affect my daughter.  Third, I would think about how my daughter would feel if I kept her from her father.  Lastly, I would consult an attorney, to see just what my rights are in this situation.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  |`|fSlZQzS4aa	You would be negligent to allow your daughter to ride in a vehicle driven by someone with no license.  Invite the father to call the police for assistance when you refuse to let your daughter go with him.|`|441c6bd6a1f30669861bc860798ef932aa	Isnt the fact that she gets to be with her Dad override the no license thing?...Think about her...she would resent you for it.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  when you see him driving call the cops & report him.
g5RS83paaa	I love how you threw Bill Clinton into the list, after all he was the 1st black president. I think alot of ignorant people voted for Obama just because he's black, that's reverse racism|`|qjvAquFnaa	that is what I was thinking.<br>  <br>  He is socialist.  Spread the wealth is so Karl Marx, or was that Groucho.......<br>  I am not a particular fan of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.<br>  Bill Clinton was a pimp lol he was nasty (I mean, well interns, eww.)  <br>  <br>  People who cry racist is a racist themselves.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: However, what is wrong with being pro-choice?|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	No. If and when he does something bad or doesn't do something good,<br>  it's appropriate to talk about it. but all I've seen him do as well as the majority of Americans have been good, respectful and genuinely caring. |`|ghL9ZrMKaa	Yea!, try something positive or constructive for a "(CHANGE)"!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Besides, read your post, you proved the point Dumby, who is ignorant now!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11452541	I'll at least say it doesn't make you racist as long as anything you criticize about him as anything to do with his race.  As long as you dont regard his ability (or lack of) because of race, then you're not racist.|`|AA10490963	You can talk til your blue, the race card will be played. over and over and over and ...|`|9PD8lizyaa	good point! plus since when is stating facts "racist"?|`|2281e5c7bb56fa196c78a97c53fb5437aa	I only call it racism if it's a racist question.  But as far a Obama being a baby killer that to me is just plain stupid.  Every time I hear that phrase, it coming from a zealot that only cares for the embryo.  Never In the same question do you hear about education or health care for children.  No fact are presented to call him a baby killer.  I'm pro choice and I am not a baby killer, I think it a person private choice.  Would all you zealots please get a life and either learn that you are save by the Grace of Faith and not by Works or simply stop putting your ignorance on display on Y?A.  I'd appreciate it.|`|6JQUIZFTaa	No, because according to them, the only reason why one would not vote for him is because they are a racist.  Well, I am anything but a racist.  However, I do not condone Socialis, Marxism and Communism.  Take your pick.  They are all endoctrinated into his teachings from the past.  Other than that, he simply is not qualified or prepared to be at the helm of America.|`|zoNJTKUdaa	Let them call you a racist! It's beginning to have less and less effect.<br>  <br>  If you cannot have an opinion and people call you a racist,that means that they are racist.They are just casting their misgiving on to you.<br>  Now that Obama has been elected they will have one less excuse because now it has been proven that they can get ahead,if they would apply themselves.Stop the HIP-HOP BEE BOP,and start talking like you have some sort of education and you might get some respect.<br>  Wear some clothes that fit and you might get some respect.<br>  Stop with the"whitey is keeping me down" and take responsibility for your own actions.|`|ZGertwvdaa	Why would anyone want to say anything bad about the soon to be leader of our United States of America? Or any other President that we've had. lol.|`|oywyyJn3aa	No.  "Racist" is a word invented by the marxists to destroy this country.  They adjust the meaning of the word to fit their needs.  |`|9AwY14mmaa	Never, Crying racism is obama's strongest weapon in his corrupt arsenal.|`|WOw84q5Laa	Only praise my friend, thats all that is acceptable lol|`|AA11144058	The short answer is no. Race was inserted into national election dialog by the Obama campaign. A majority of white votes voted for Obama, so I don't know why people are still clinging to the "you're a racist" excuse. <br>  <br>  Get ready...the next excuse for Obama's incompetence and poor judgment will be something along the lines of "it's still George Bush's fault" or some other continuation of Bush Derangement Syndrome. |`|nV85E6uPaa	Perhaps you are just fear mongering to push your political idealolgy rather than being purely racist.   Why else would you insist on calling him Barack Hussein Obama?  He doesn't use his middle name like that and  please don't say it's just because that's his name.  You didn't seem to care Bill Clinton's full name is actually William Jefferson Clinton.|`|4oM7SLaKaa	It certainly is!  Oddly, I find little to nothing where Obama or any key supporter even uses the term racist.   But what the heck, I have only 5000 pages or so, apparently "someone" told you otherwise.  Maybe on these forums?  Through the tin foil antenna on your head?    I guess you must know this by "divine inspiration". Do you have LOTS of conversations with invisible, imaginary friends?  Does God talk to you?  Through the mirror, perhaps???  Ah!  But you "know better".  <br>  <br>  I, for example, think you are  a racist, but I KNOW I am ashamed to live in the same country with closed mind, fascist filth.   <br>  <br>  Lately, I have noticed that, usually in ADDITION to being at least "racially motivated", in that the propaganda spewers  like Limbaugh are spreading, there are other terms like "liar" and "filthy" and "fat"  and "deaf" and "stupid" and "just plain WRONG" which also apply.<br>  <br>  Does it make a difference?<br>  <br>  You're some kind of right wing crackpot, and I am not particuarly concerned what KIND.  Also, if you have some other dictionary around OTHER THAN the KKK handbook, which seems to be the one you are using, you and several of these other semi-literates might want to look up an ACTUAL definition of racism, and it would be startling to you.  But then why confuse your obviously one-track mind with facts?<br>  <br>  You are also exaggerating and lying, which I know doesn't concern you, and indeed, you are so ensconced in the muck that flows from those other liars, that you might even argue that.<br>  <br>  Who cares?<br>  <br>  You are at best a cypher, and calling you a racist is a waste of syllables.<br>  <br>  "Dork"  will do nicely.   Maybe you prefer that?|`|e2wIc7HLaa	I understand your sentiment, BUT, president-elect Obama has been chosen to lead this country.  He's inheriting a hell of a lot of crap.  Not all the crap is Bush's fault, but in hind sight things could have and should have been different.  Bush's presidency has been turmoil since 9/11.  Now, we MUST unite and there will be times we disagree, but those of us who are skeptical of Obama must be vigilant that our rights will not be pounced upon and that we will not have to "foot the bill" for things we do not believe in.  The dems had 8 years of what they call hell, now I guess it's payback for conservative democrats as well as republicans.  I wish president-elect Obama good luck and I pray he has a change of heart especially when it comes to the unborn innocents.  I wish President Bush the best and much rest as it is much deserved.  I think he's done his best considering the hell it's been over the years.  It's time to unite, not divide.|`|jxtzccasaa	I think that has already worn very thin and we simply are not going to put up with it.<br>  <br>  People should be judged by their actions be they white, black, yellow, polka-dotted or striped, makes no difference.<br>  <br>  Look at this AP story warning comedians not to make fun of the kool-aid king, as if:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081110/ap_en_tv/tv_obama_finding_the_funny">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081110/ap_e...</a>|`|eqZBhmaaaa	No, I am pretty sure all black ppl that voted for McCain are now considered racist too.  Obama is sick, how anyone can kill babies is just disgusting.  Anyone who thinks different is selfish and they don't deserve kids anyways.|`|6c322111553b870c81be7310f3d112b1aa	Well no. Because you can simply say " he wants to spread the wealth" and its different if you say " he wants to help out all his homies on the corner." I've heard that on here before.|`|8xnk5Uv5aa	I don't think you're a racist.  I just think you're a bitter moron who needs to get off the computer and start doing something else than having temper tantrums on the internet.|`|GbeF6gQuaa	It is a double standard brought on by "political correctness".  It is a poison that slowly kills our national character.|`|hU3TutE2aa	You are just wrong. He does not want to kill babies before they are born. Why don't you just actually do some research once in a while on science instead of pretending you know something about science?|`|4f3fc385039c7d3ac7eec4ff4fc0f97daa	yes you're a racist,if you were not you wouldn't be so adamantly trying to convince everyone that you weren't,so now who is ignorant|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	It would appear simply denying him of your vote makes anyone racist. I don't know about you but I didn't sit in a racist church for 20 years.|`|1MnNVUcfaa	No its not possible to say anything about Obama and not be a racist. Sorry, its just the way it is|`|6a5c94bc1ee9c654afdd244e1069448daa	Say anything you want.  He is president elect now.|`|40pyDwTGaa	Amen!  And thank you.<br>  <br>  You left out a few things, but I'll forgive you.<br>  <br>  Good job!!|`|32993a3b68eb9fee6905eba5187edd16aa	even though you are exercising your right to free speech they are still going to call you a racist
KtdlJbrOaa	No, I think that he will honestly try to make sure that every teacher in the US gets the pay they deserve.  <br>  <br>  You have to remember - all nominees make comments about what they are going to do once elected.

If you look at an election map of the US you will see a great RED hole in the middle. That is where you will find the lowest test scores for children, the most right wing Evangelical Churches, the highest teen pregnancies and the highest Federal subsidies. <br>  <br>  The healthiest economy and the highest education levels are on those BLUE coasts. We also pay the taxes that supports those Red States many of which receive back double the Federal taxes that they pay...<br>  <br>  Those Red states were perfectly represented by Sarah Palin and her anti-intellectualism.   <br>  <br>  Sophisticated? Knowledgable? Hardly.    |`|IAfCPyAAaa	i think they should be given equal time on the teev/radio etc. and yeah, the races here last WAY too long. it'd be super if the press could actually be objective/independent as well. |`|bfa2b8a48d1494ec02e8109633f40f51aa	I'm so pleased to hear that you aren't American.<br>  |`|zMD0VeOmaa	1st of all what country are you from? I would like to know what you are using as your basis of comparison. I'm guessing you are from Europe since you are quoting a European Union study but you did not specify. It is hard for me to decipher based on the flag next to your screen name b/c it is so small.<br>  <br>  2nd when people mention the term American they often forget that there is a whole continent beneath North America called South America. Although not united they are Americans too!<br>  <br>  3rd you are correct, Obama had an expensive campaign that was inundated with ads.<br>  <br>  4th I do not appreciate the generalization that most North Americans are weak minded and badly educated. If you compared the IQ of North Americans to Europeans you would find that all populations of the world are virtually the same. In fact, North America contains a large number of Europeans that have immigrated from Europe. It is true that some schools in the U.S. are inadequate especially with math and science. <br>  <br>  That does not make U.S kids dumber than elsewhere. It just makes them less enlightened. However, the U.S has some of the best colleges in the world. People travel from all over the world to come to college in the U.S. U.S. universities are a melting pot of some of the brightest minds in the world. I know b/c I attended college.<br>  <br>  I do not know that North American voters are more sophisticated on the whole than European voters. I think America is no different than other countries where the general population has the right to vote. Some people will be more informed than others. Some people vote based on their emotions, their personal beliefs, or based on facts.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you are going to make fun of an American citizen Oprah Winfrey is not a very good example. Oprah grew up in poverty but her net worth has grown to over $1 billion because she is highly motivated and intelligent.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that you have such a parochial view of the United States. I hope that I helped expand your horizons a bit. If not good luck to you.<br>  |`|w8gKpSOBaa	Oprah who?  that's seems pretty small-minded for someone who what's to question sophistication.  I really don't think that Oprah or anyone who follows her can be put into a "vulnerable" catagory.... I mean are you serious?<br>  <br>  Although you have a very interesting question, I am put off by the hate.  <br>  <br>  I do agree that fund raising for campaign money is not the best system.  Candidates usually end up reflecting the interest of the companies and industries that back them monetarily.  <br>  <br>  I do not think that the only ones who were affected by the advert were "weak minded and badly educated" but perhaps more so those who are under represented by politics to date.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

0WuYRE7maa	Because of the way W had screwed things up, none of the popular republicans wanted to run for president. It had a become a contest to see who would lose to Hillary.

"You betcha" to steal a phrase.<br>  <br>  I think the path to the future for the GOP involves going back to libertarian populist ideals: small Fed, fiscal responsiblity, and the Fed butts out of social issues leaving those to the states.<br>  <br>  If they continue on the neo-con path or decide this election means they need to go "moderate", I think it's a recipe for further GOP disaster in 2012.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	I don't believe so, Mcain was the underdog right from the start purely because of the party he would be leading.

In my personal opinion, homosexual people are simply sexually disoriented. I do not know what makes them that way although I know from some of my close friends many have been molested as children.  <br>  <br>  Nonetheless, it does not make them bad people nor does it make them particularly scary.  In fact, any people who keep their particular kinks, fetishes,  perversions or disorientations to themselves are fine with me. However, if they want to go public with it, to put it on display in front of children etc.  I take exception.  <br>  <br>  Since the constant attempts to accommodate homosexuals by redefining marriage, granting them special status regarding civil rights etc. have been rejected by the majority of Americans the question should be how much longer must we tolerate these self-centered boorish activists?  How much longer must the rest of America have to tolerate repeated attempts to implement something the people have already rejected?  How much longer must we tolerate some Liberal lawyer in a black robe over-ruling the people, Legislatures and Governors all over America?  <br>  <br>  I notice that Homosexual Activist groups have taken to protesting in front of Mormon houses of worship because they oppose your cause.  Yet, I see no such protesters in front of Orthodox Synagogues, Muslim Mosques or Black Christian Churches.  They, too, strongly oppose your cause but you dare not protest there.  You only pick on Mormons.  <br>  <br>  That is reprehensible.<br>  <br>  *<br>  |`|gau0w8LMaa	Are you applying for a job with the gay police.

SDHvDNGJaa	Muchas, se ve que los chinos se dedicaron a sacar la casta y prepararse con toda seriedad para demostrar su nuevo poderío al mundo. Creo que es un compromiso que Estados Unidos y el resto del mundo no alcanzamos a vislumbrar cuando China fue nombrada la nueva sede de los juegos olímpicos. Para ellos es un escaparate mundial ideal.<br>  Saludos!|`|Do4oyK90aa	ya tubo todas las posibilidades pues ya lo desbanco a estas alturas le lleva triple de medallas de oro el segundo es ahora   estados unidos|`|CyWcNz22aa	Pues encuento a la gimnasia los chinos demostraron tener mucho mejor nivel que los gringos, honestamente cualquiera pudo verlo, los chinos vienen con lo mejor de las tradiciones en gimnasia de las antiguas escuelas rusas y rumanas por lo que su nivel en esta diciplina es excelente, la neta lo demostraron, las chinas fueron mucho mejores que las gringas. <br>  <br>  Yo personalmente no concidero que un ATLETA  de alto rendimiento sea un holgazan con sueldo, de flojos nada, entrenan minimo 6 horas diarias, y en paises como mexico gen. ellos pagan sus entrenamientos, o tienen que buscar un patrocinador, ademas es una belleza ver correr, nadar, remar, a verdaderos atletas no improvisados, que no aguantan ni una cuadra corriendo, muchos pagamos por ver una gala de gimnasia, yo lo he hecho, vale la pena, es su trabajo. <br>  <br>  En cuanto a lo de las medallas pues china ha entrenado bastante a sus atletas, pero los gringos como mencionas vienen fuertes en atletismo, pero yo creo que mas que ver quien gana mas oros lo importante es disfrutar las competencias, pues cada medalla tiene una historia, como las de las ni?as de gimnasia tanto dolor, tanto sacrificio, tantas lagrimas. <br>  <br>  China es un pais con mucha miseria, sus juegos le han costado mucho a su pueblo, lagrimas, sangre, muertos, desaparecidos, por lo menos que ganen sus oros. <br>  <br>  |`|AA10793110	Lo lógico es que los chinos desbanquen a los gringos en el medallero. La pregunta es, ?por qué? ?Alguien se ha preguntado por qué, casualmente, los países con más dinero se llevan las medallas? Yo, honestamente, no creo que un holgazán con sueldo, alias "atleta", que tiene un buen nivel de vida sólo por correr, lo hará más rápidamente si se le da más dinero. Los recursos no generan capacidades, comprobado.<br>  <br>  ?Entonces?<br>  <br>  ?Será que los países con más dinero invierten más en tener mejores drogas que administrar a sus "atletas", drogas que los tornen eficientes sin ser descubiertos? ?La ciencia al servicio del "deporte"? ?Se trabaja para encontrar el dopaje infalible? ?Cuántos casos de atletas que han corrido dopados no se conocen por los resultados de los exámenes, sino porque alguien los delata, como Marion Jones?<br>  <br>  Otra preguntita fastidiosa:<br>  <br>  Si los chinos desbancan a los gringos del medallero, ?será porque los jueces les otorgarán mejores calificaciones? Un buen número de pruebas son "de apreciación", y el mejor ejemplo es la gimnasia. ?Pesa ser local?<br>  <br>  Si juntamos las dos anteriores interrogantes (dopaje y corrupción de jueces), tenemos que los Juegos Olímpicos son la farsa más grande que puede ver cualquier ser humano. ?De qué sirve el mentado "juramento" que se pronuncia en la ceremonia de inauguración, si los atletas corren dopados, hacen trampas y faulean al contrario, mientras los jueces se venden al mejor postor, o favorecen deliberadamente al anfitrión?<br>  <br>  pd. Para Vampira, a ver si entendí tu comentario: en un país como el nuestro, donde las carencias están a la orden del día, donde millones de mexicanos no saben si comerán hoy, y donde nuestros niveles educativos son deplorables, ?no es una infamia mantener atletas de "alto" rendimiento (que, por sus resultados, deberían ser de "chafa" rendimiento)? ?No es acaso criminal destinar presupuesto federal a mantener a estos zánganos improductivos, que lo único para lo que sirven es para poner el nombre de México en el extranjero (bien o mal, generalmente mal), mientras hay quienes no tienen que comer, o reciben una educación deplorable? ?No es ridículo entregar becas de por vida a quien se ganó una medalla por levantar X kilos en una competencia, mientras los sueldos de los profesores universitarios dan pena? Según tú, no, porque los zánganos (a) "atletas" se esfuerzan, sudan mucho, y buscan sus patrocinadores. Lo ideal sería que vivieran de sus patrocinadores, no de ese ente burocrático inútil que es la Conade.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a tu comentario sobre China... es una lástima que pienses que unas medallas (pedazos de metal que servirán para darle un nivel de vida bueno a un tipo en concreto, mientras el resto sigue viviendo en la miseria) compensarán el despliegue enloquecido del Partido Comunista Chino para mostrar al mundo lo bien que están, y de lo que son capaces. Muertos, sangre, trabajos forzados... todo por unas medallas que a nadie benefician en nada, salvo a quienes les cuelgan del pescuezo. Repito, qué lástima.|`|r5x43Zx6aa	Si, es obvio que china va a correr a EEUU del primer lugar en medallas.

Siento que se están tomando las medidas correctas y audaces para salir adelante. Todas las economías primer mundistas   están haciendo algo para evitar el crack mundial de los paises en desarrollo.

22458578d376e9de1925396e8b34fb04aa	Yes, you can use two 37 cent stamps to mail your letter as long as it is still one ounce or less... since the price of mailing the letter is based on its weight.  Currently, the first class postage rate is 39 cents for one ounce or less.  Also, stamps do not have an expiration date on them... they retain their value until they are used and receive a cancellation mark from the post office.  Also, you can purchase 2 cent stamps that you can combine with your 37 cent stamps if you wish to save money.|`|0dabe2af8f42cf5c5f47f81982643269aa	Yes you can, but don't expect change,.<br>  And no there is no expiration date.|`|f224b03ca16b2c2c12215013a8bd7608aa	Yep , your letter to Ma will get there on two stamps.

b9a35472c7cde4badb72e8d7255447e7aa	As with every other legal question, the correct answer depends on the jurisdiction in which you live.  In Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is no specific age requirement.  However, there is a crime called "Endangering the Welfare of a Child".  Courts generally define "Endangerment" on a case-by-case basis.  So, if a neighbor reported that you had left a child overnight with a 14-year-old, but no harm occurred, the 14-year-old was shown to be remarkably mature, another neighbor was available for emergencies, and you had left three emergency numbers in a conspicuous place, you would probably not be prosecuted, let alone convicted.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you leave your child with a perpetually drunk 50-year-old, or a 28-year-old with a prior conviction for child molestation, you may well find yourself facing a judge and jury.  <br>  <br>  I would offer as general, common-sense (not legal) advice that a 2-year-old should generally be in the care of an adult, and I personally would not go lower than a very mature 15-year-old with quick access to a responsible adult.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	same in the u.k. and you should make sure that they are c.r.b. checked.|`|1h7Eza5qaa	22 and do background checks on the carer too.<br>  Sadly, most child abuse cases happens in their own home.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	If you are in England there is no legal age of a carer.  <br>  <br>  The RSPCC suggests the age of 14 but this is not a legal requirement as one child will be more mature than another child of the same age, however, if your child is left with somebody who is under the age of 16 and the child is injuried, you as the parent / legal guardian will be held responsible and can be prosecuted.

Even if you have beaten the statute & can make a claim, I would not think that you would be able to recover anything.  Personal injury claims are based on injuries and the settlement amount is directly tied to the amount of the medical bills.  Because you have not gone to the doctor, it will be assumed that the injuries you received in the accident were not serious enough to seek treatment.  Also, ANYTHING could have happened in the 2 years since the accident.  You would have a hard time getting any provider to say the accident that occurred 2 years ago is definitively the cause of current injuries.|`|JoOn2MSTaa	Usually you have to file within a year.

AA11144058	I don't think abortion is a hard subject to have an opinion on. It is a moral question. Just like slavery was a moral question. The "pro-choice" label is a mistaken label because it pushes off stage the real issue that determines where a person stands on the question of abortion and that is the legitimacy of the choice. If abortion is, as I believe it is and as I believe you can prove it is very easily as a matter of scientific fact, the intentional killing of a living human being, a member of our species, one of our tiny brothers and sisters, then if you believe that that killing is a legitimate choice, whether you call yourself pro choice or not, you are favoring abortion.<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson was a founding father -- who said, look, slavery is a bad thing. It's terrible that we have it. I prefer a world without slavery. But the world we have is one with which slavery is integrated into our economy and into our culture and there would be dire consequences for farms and businesses where slavery is used and for the society as a whole if we abolish slavery, therefore reluctantly I'm going to support the choice of people to have a slave. But that wasn't being pro choice on slavery. That was being pro slavery. It was treating slavery as a legitimate choice. Again the issue is, is it legitimate or is it a grave injustice. If it's legitimate, then you're for it, whether it's slavery or abortion. And if it's illegitimate, then you are against it.|`|Jx3FmfY3aa	Murder requires intentionally killing a person. If you don't believe that a fetus is a person then it can't be considered murder because your motive is not to harm anyone.|`|DUSM3LUpaa	Answering your title question, I think abortion is a complicated question not because it's a nuanced or multifaceted issue (which, as you aptly pointed out, it is), but rather because anyone to whom you express that opinion will instantly make assumptions about you and your morality.  If you're pro-choice, you're an irresponsible, baby-killing monster.  If you're pro-life, you're a religious nut who thinks women should be subordinated to masses of cells.<br>  <br>  It's a tough issue because there's really no give from either side.  No one is willing to concede anything in the dialogue, so no matter how long you talk about it, we can never reach a consensus upon which to build policies that actually do make our families healthier and happier.  Everyone's so concerned with being right, and especially with being morally superior, that they really don't care about the issue anymore.|`|J8RJMZg7aa	I think it is pretty easy to give an opinion on, in my opinion it is murder. Case closed. I don't care about any other circumstances murder is murder. While rape is a terrible thing, piling murder on top of rape does not make it right. As far as a mother going to die in labor, how did we come to decide that the mothers life was more valuable than the child's? We kill one human being who has sinned to save one human being who is  innocent? I just believe it is murder. People have a right to a different opinion and I have a right to my opinion and I have the right to support people in politics who agree with my opinion.|`|JVV6OYmXaa	I'm pro-choice. I think that people have the right to choose what is best for themselves. It's a difficult subject to talk about. People are usually very strong on their ideas.|`|34cb64089bcff2faf273905eba62593aaa	Well, it depends on the person's belief. It's easy to give an opinion, as they technically don't require any factual support. If you're conflicted, though, as you seem to be, it can be.<br>  <br>  I personally am pro-life, after being pro-choice for many years. Many on both the pro-life and pro-choice sides have both admitted that by making abortion illegal with restrictions like the cases of becoming pregnant through rape or incest, many women would claim to have been raped or abused in order to get the abortion. They would, in effect, be forced to lie.<br>  <br>  In terms of the mother's life being endangered, I can understand and support abortion in that case - but in that case it would not be available like it is now. First, a doctor would need to examine the woman to verify the threat and the person would have to make their decision.Unfortunately, many of the deaths caused by childbirth are unexpected, making this situation even more unlikely. Abortions are very dangerous as it is, so it may not even be considered an option in the case that it can be predicted. In addition to this, medical science being as advanced as it is, it is a rare case when doctors would be able to find this threat and not somehow circumvent it. Also, scientists are continually shortening the amount of time required by a child in the womb before it can survive outside of their mother's body (and being in some kind of artificial womb instead). Then, there's C-sections and other medical procedures to get the baby out of the mother with as little risk to the mother as possible.|`|3ce7c6cb8ed8d06c1fbc8284b6fc4027aa	I think that abortion should be legal in cases of rape, incest, and the situation you talked about above. It is not fair for a woman to suffer the pains of carrying a baby and childbirth, especially if it is not her fault. And in cases of incest (which is sick, but sadly it happens) the baby should be aborted because of the many birth defects that incest caused babies are born with. The child should not have to live its life that way. (I also think abortion should be legal in the case of a parent having HIV/AIDS because it is cruel for children to struggle with that their whole lives, think about it)<br>  <br>  I also think it should be legal only IF the fetus is less than 3 months old, before it develops its senses and actual body parts. Then the baby wouldn't actually be a person, so it would NOT be considered murder. It would still be part of the mother, therefore it should be solely her choice whether or not she wants to keep it. Women should be able to decide whether or not they think they are ready for a child, or for childbirth. Some women don't want to suffer the pain of labor, which is completely understandable. Reproduction should be their decision. <br>  <br>  As for all the men who have opinions on this, I honestly don't care. Until you can feel the pain of carrying around a child and giving birth through your private parts or having your stomach sliced open (because the pain is nearly unparalleled and there is no pain in the world exactly like it), then you should NOT have a say in this topic. <br>  <br>  By the way, I have never aborted myself, nor ever needed to, but I do hold a strong stand on the topic. <br>  |`|ZwBOjkGmaa	i think you forgetting there's not really any way to tell if a child is gonna be mentally challanged, or if the mother is going to die in labor BEFORE the child is born.<br>  that's something you find out when it happens.<br>  but im working on inventing a time machine!<br>  so far i have a blender and a mobile phone. and the machine has waisted so much of my time, that technically i almost went BACK in time.<br>  so there you have my oppinion on abourtion.<br>  the governmant just need to work on time machines. till then. it should be the mother's decision i think. |`|zj91sSsuaa	Did you know that the winning argument for Roe vs Wade was that if she carried the child to full term, it would cause a psychological trauma, did you know that?<br>  Most people don't, and even MORE people didn't want to know that.<br>  So I ask you, do all these people (women) getting abortions, saying that it would cause psychological trauma for them to carry the baby to full term?<br>  See how ridiculous it is for everyone to think that it was a victory for women everywhere.<br>  They feed people this BS about it being a right to privacy, but it had nothing to do with that.<br>  It was about ONE WOMEN'S psychological state of mind.<br>  They should make every women who wants an abortion to take a comprehensive psychological evaluation, just to be fair .<br>  Yeah I can see them screaming about this though.|`|A1kcSX3Zaa	I think neither rape or a threat to the mothers life support public access to abortion. In cases of saving the mother, this is not done in an abortion clinic. In cases of rape, this could also be handled without public clinics. And these are not the reasons for the majority of public abortion anyway. I also do not think that keeping abortion legal so that a woman will not hurt herself by getting one illegally is a valid point. She has a choice and other options.

They have no jurisdiction over his residence and cannot force him to move to where they would have jurisdiction. The only thing that would work in your favour is if he moved back to Canada. Then he could be legally ordered to pay child support no matter where he moved to.  <br>  <br>  And for future reference, don't meet people online from other countries. My brother-in-law ended up in a similar situation, marrying a woman who had a kid in the US after working for years to get his visa, only to have her leave. She was going to get him to pay child support, but he moved back to Canada. |`|9M5r99uXaa	First, you need to have a legal order entitling you to child support.  Generally you get that by going to court.  Your local social services agency should be able to tell you for sure how to do it in your jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  Then after you get the legal document.  You get your child support enforcement agency to contact the local child support enforcement agency in the state where the father resides.<br>  <br>  This is possible because there is a child support enforcement agreement between the United States and Canada.  Many states, such as Texas have their own agreements with the Canadian provinces as well.<br>  <br>  So in theory anyway you can do everything from where you are.<br>  <br>  The problem comes in if the father does things to avoid paying.  Like if he continually moves, it is difficult to find and enforce child support, or if he does things for cash where there is no record of him getting paid.<br>  <br>  In any case.  It all shouldn't be too bad if he doesn't just get where he is willing to ruin everyone's life instead of being responsible.<br>  <br>  So first you need the court order.  You really should get a lawyer to help, I know it's tough.  Maybe your parents would help with the lawyer.  It's not particularly expensive and a lawyer will tell you how much it's going to cost beforehand.  When lawyers say they can't help you that means if you were on welfare the government would pay but since you aren't you have to pay.   And you aren't able.  So you need to sell somethiing to get the cash, or you need to find someone who loves you to get the cash, or you need to get a better job, or go on welfare.  I realize none of those are good decisions, but you need to do something or else you will be trapped in your situation.<br>  <br>  Without a court order, even if you get something, it's unlikely to be much of anything, for some reason people think a couple of hundred is a lot of money, and if your ex is like most people, he spends everything he makes so he would tell you he has nothing to give you.<br>  <br>  So you must do what it takes to get a lawyer and get a judgement then after you get the judgement, you contact I beleive the Family Responsibility Office in Ontario and they will help you, though it might take a while.<br>  <br>  There is probably a local group that can help you to some extent.

utbfT0APaa	<br>  Cost of housing an inmate.<br>  Operating a Correctional facility is not cheap. We have a responsibility to care for the inmate's needs while he is incarcerated in the Prison.   It costs the taxpayers of Venango County approximately $32.00 per day or approximately $11,000 per year to house an inmate in the Prison.  <br>  <br>  To help off set this cost, several programs have been instituted to make the inmate partially responsible for the cost of housing him. Any inmate on work release has to to pay $10.00 per day for room and board while he is incarcerated in the Prison.  <br>  <br>  As you can see the amount the inmate is charged does not even come close to meeting the actual cost. The idea is to show the inmate that they should be at least partially responsible for the cost of incarcerating them in the Prison.  <br>  <br>  Medical expenses are a large amount of the cost in housing an inmate and we charge the inmate $3.00 to see the nurse and $5.00 if they request to see the doctor. We will not deny any medical care to an inmate who is indigent and can't pay this fee. The reasoning behind this fee is to keep inmates who don't need to see the medical staff from just going and "visiting".<br>  <br>   <br>  |`|bAbHo8moaa	it depends on the state, I did a report on this a few years back but its in the millions, its anywhere from 16-60 thousand per prisoner depending on the state, place, amount of security and benefits they recieve.|`|PKfh0jhLaa	Whatever it is its TOO MUCH<br>  People are being busted for ALL SORTS of crap<br>  petty possession of small amounts of pot are considered excuse enough to lock somebody up. its insane!<br>  <br>  WE THE PEOPLE really need to decriminalize victimless "crimes"!|`|ozuvGuHRaa	the answer to your question is far more than they are worth, but we need keep them locked up as long as possible|`|moNOnsmpaa	first they have too do somthing really,really,really,really,really,reall... then hell'll go away for a very long time .Or go buy a bag of cocaine like an once wiil do and plant it in his car then call the police and tell them you seen him selling drugs at your corner gas station or something sit back a watch his *** get in big trouble and hell goto jail for at least a few years for the drug case the more cocaine you buy and plant on him the more time hell do say for example you but like a kilo(2.2 pounds)and around $20.000 he will most likely get 20 years for that alone|`|RkaZPs9Paa	I've heard, about 50 dollars a day for each prisoner.<br>  <br>  Help?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiXsfMEzThtc_RGVhArByFbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081122165545AAxf5Vp">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0MuIRH1uaa	obama sucks a*ss and america is screwed first!!! the family pays for a lot of the cost im pretty sure.|`|kO1ykFo3aa	everyone is saying it like they think its wrong to keep someone behind bars, i think no matter what they did, u shudent kill them...and instead just put them there for a while.|`|VdqpLHWEaa	its the crime that keeps them behind bars|`|sZe3lv6faa	Depends...Ask an attorney or judge. |`|GrKMU2Y4aa	probably a lot more than we want to think about.|`|b6oaMvLLaa	Too much.|`|uu4deUCvaa	About 30k a year per prisoner|`|4f1b5e8fffb0817b5e1ddec004ff0d7faa	too much. all who have been tried and convicted and admitted who are on death row should die immediately. no sitting around for 30 years. if they admit it kill 'em. save us some money.|`|BfAz7xmhaa	Doesn't that go against and amendment? |`|LggMpuQIaa	Look on your states DOC they have all of that listed right on the site!|`|yhn36l78aa	it costs way to much|`|yNk0kKsuaa	one hell of a lot of money , or it depends what the did |`|0548b3604e09ca839e8b931944ad1a10aa	more money than it would take to send them to college.

2g1KEptwaa	The A bombs were dropped because the United States would never get a better opportunity to test their (new) superweapon on a real city, with real people. The war was still on (technically), so they'd get away with it--IF they could convince people it would "save lives". They did convince them, while skipping over the fact that invading Japan was totally unnecessary. If you want to end the war with the least loss of life, that is--they should've EMBARGOED Japan. Unfortunately, doing it that way (the F*G way) the US doesn't get to show them damn Nips a good ol lesson.

There was at least one valid reason, under those same laws of war - proportionality.  <br>  <br>  If the Japanese had not been dissuaded from fighting until the bitter end, the end would have been really bitter.  Millions of people would have died on each side of a military campaign to take the Japanese Home Islands.  As the son of one of the people who would have been sent over to fight and die in the Pacific if we hadn't used nuclear weapons on Japan, I'm grateful we did that instead;<br>  <br>  Also, the citizens of a country are ultimately responsible for what their leaders do in their name.  When they saw the leaders of your country sending troops all over the Pacific to conquer nations so they could steal natural resources and blandly authorizing mass rapes and murders, the "but they were civilians" argument loses some of its force.  The firebombing of Dresden and Tokyo, by that argument, were even more heinous than Hiroshima and Nagasaki - Dresden, in particular, was an open city with no military defenses of any sort.<br>  <br>  But these cities were both valid strategic bombing targets by our current definition of the term.  According to The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Chapter II - The Effects of Atomic Bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki), "Hiroshima before the war was the seventh largest city in Japan, with a population of over 340,000, and was the principal administrative and commercial center of the southwestern part of the country. <br>  <br>  "As the headquarters of the Second Army and of the Chugoku Regional Army, it was one of the most important military command stations in Japan, the site of one of the largest military supply depots, and the foremost military shipping point for both troops and supplies. Its shipping activities had virtually ceased by the time of the attack, however, because of sinkings and the mining of the Inland Sea. It had been relatively unimportant industrially before the war, ranking only twelfth, but during the war new plants were built that increased its significance. These factories were not concentrated, but spread over the outskirts of the city; this location, we shall see, accounts for the slight industrial damage." <br>  <br>  Nagasaki was less important, but the defense contractor Mitsubishi had four plants in the city; Nagasaki was also seat of prefectural government and hosted a naval base.<br>  <br>  One of those targets was a biological warfare storage depot, and even now one of the cases in which our policy recognizes we may have to use a nuclear weapon is to sterilize enemy biowar depots.(2)|`|zkovxRseaa	because gravity makes them work better|`|aJWjqaAPaa	The Japanese Mindset at the time can be described as the same as the srapped explosives paradise seakers of today they were sent to Pearl Harbour for one thing and one thing only "Kamikaze " <br>  The United states of America must have felt trapped and its a bit of a coincidence that when they had their Backs to the Wall they Dropped the only Nuclear Atom Bomb Ever to be Dropped on Civilians Every body In America Celebrated There were Soldiers in Cars that took to the street with their Sweathearts in hand to a Welcome home there were even glittery paper stuff coming from the Sky And that was the End..................Or was it?|`|f748148506cc661fbff33eea1e08daf2aa	It was not 'revenge' that teacher is sub standard.<br>  <br>  It was the only way to end quick a war with a vicious empire that fought to the death, hundreds of thousands more lives would have been lost invading the Japanese mainland<br>  <br>  I don't like war, but that was the only way to end that evil empire, it was just as bad as Nazism and Im glad it was wiped off the map forever|`|i5F2jwvhaa	next time you hear a democrat call a republican a war monger and a terrorist jsut remind yourself the only US President to ever use our strongest bomb was a democrat|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Do Hustle"<br>  Matt 27.29,37<br>  Decode this lyrics " If you don't know me by now"<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  Decode this lyrics " Take a bow"<br>  Leviticus 26.1-41<br>  Decode this lyrics " Say you say me"<br>  Luke 24.44-45,47<br>  Decode this lyrics " Knowing me knowing you"<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Decode this lyrics " I'll be there"<br>  Luke 21.30-36<br>  Decode this lyrics " When will i see you again"<br>  Exodus 20.1-7<br>  Decode this lyrics " C U When U get there"<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Decode this lyrics " One more try"<br>  Luke 8.-5-8,10-17<br>  " Mamamia"<br>  What do you think?|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	As horrific as the nuclear bombs were that the Americans dropped on Japan, they prbably saved more lives than they destroyed. Without them the allies would have had to invade Japan itself and literally kill every man woman and child that could hold a weapon, because they would be looking to do the same to the allies for every grain of soil in their country. The Japanese would have fought to the death but the nuclear bomb could not be fought off by any means. To put it simply, Japan could literally have been wiped off the map, and that scared it's citizens so much that there was only one option, surrender. This meant no more cities were flattened by this ultimate terror weapon, no more Japanese would have to die, and no allies would have to invade.<br>  <br>  As for revenge, I don't think that was the main reason for dropping the bomb. The allies simply did not want to get into a war of attrition. The best solution they could see was the quick end of the war, the atom bomb would produce.

3nzqclQBaa	Mi querido Cicuta, muchas veces tenemos que voltear y ver alrededor para darnos cuenta que hay personas o países que estan peor que nosotros. Claro eso no quiere decir que por eso tenemos que permitir que las injusticias sigan pasando. Hay qué tratar de solucionar las cosas, ponernos todos de acuerdo y unirnos para qué estás cosas no sigan sucediendo.<br>    Tu comentas acerca de la narco-guerrilla colombiana, yo que vivo en Venezuela, está situación ya se ha extendido atravesando las fronteras de mi país, donde muchos venezolanos han sido secuestrados por las guerrillas y los narco traficantes colombianos. Los venezolanos que habitan en  las regiones fronterizas con Colombia tienen que pagar lo que ellos llaman las vacunas para vivir en relativa calma y seguridad. Entonces cuando permitimos que las cosas pasen y no ponemos de nuestra parte para ayudar en lo posible, esas cosas terminan por afectarnos. Muchos países de Latinoamérica incluida Venezuela, nos hicimos la vista gorda de la situación en Colombia, una porqué no hay que entrometerse en la autonomia de un país extranjero, otra porqué la droga solo afectaba a los Norteamericanos y dejamos pasar las cosas hasta llegar al punto de que nos vemos afectados nosotros también. Como dice el refrán:"caiman que se duerme se lo lleva la corriente".<br>  <br>         Ten un lindo día y gracias por tus maravillosa preguntas que lo hacen a uno reflexionar sobre el manejo de nuestros países que de una u otra forma nos afecta directamente.<br>          Besos.|`|4fe267ffa7e70cbfba149be5dea67513aa	Hay tanta gente que esta esperando una respuesta frente a situaciones violentas vividas que han quedado inmunes...casos  a los que la justicia y su competencia han dado la espalda, o han hecho oidos sordos!!!!!

A pesar que coincido con unas pocas medidas del gobierno de N.K. muchas no me cierran y otras no me gustan para nada. Pero los desaciertos de este gobierno no son nuestro único problema, la falta de una Verdadera Oposición, seria responsable y comprometida con los intereses populares, permite que el gobierno de turno haga y deshaga. Lo que conocemos como oposición están mas ocupados en acordar con el gobierno, sacando su propia tajada, negociando a espaldas del pueblo. pues entonces a quien o a quienes votamos. La clase política esta empe?ada en mantener los privilegios de los poderosos y profundizar las diferencias sociales. No veo a nadie luchando por la libertad de oportunidades, ni por la justicia social. Si alguien descubre un político que si lo haga, por favor aviseme, que gustoso lo voy a votar. Creo que no alcanza con decir que reflexionemos antes de votar, si no hay alguien confiable en quien votar. De lo que si estoy convencido es que es necesario que todos participemos desde nuestros lugares, todos los días  para modificar esta realidad.

362XGz1qaa	Realmente vc está certo. Seria igual ao contrabando de cigarros, roupa e produtos piratas. Nós estamos vendo aí, o caso dofilme Tropa de Elite que foi pirateado antes mesmo de chegar aos cinemas, né??<br>  Ent?o...a legaliza??o adiantaria se nós n?o tívessemos uma polícia t?o corrupta e um sistema de vigilancia e fiscaliza??o eficiente. (PS: Se nós já tivessemos fiscaliza??o, n?o existiria o tráfico tal e qual vemos hoje.)<br>  Mas por outro lado eu penso o seguinte: O Estado n?o tem direito de determinar o que você faz da sua vida, num é mesmo?? A própria constitui??o lhe dá o direito à liberdade. Cada um faz da vida o que quer, por isso eu sou à favor da legaliza??o.<br>  Mas pensando por um outro lado, vejamos o seguinte: Se eu sou um agricultor....planto arroz e feij?o por exemplo. Com a legaliza??o da maconha, eu vou plantar maconha ao invés de arroz, pq a maconha é cara, entende??<br>  Aí...e se acontecer isso??Os agricultores resolverem plantar maconha ao invés de arroz, feij?o, soja, cana e etc???<br>  <br>  Por isso que o assunto tem que ser debatido com responsabilidade.|`|GcueGMJOaa	n?o concordo.o nome já diz tudo:droga!n?o serve para nada.|`|Tb1iWgp5aa	Legalizar drogas é conversa de DROGADO.<br>  Afinal de quem seria o interesse em legalizar?

Ent?o porque n?o legalizar?<br>  <br>  E essa história que falaram aí que quem é a favor da legaliza??o é drogado  n?o tem nada a ver, pois eu n?o uso nem lícita nem ilícita, mas sou a favor da liberdade de escolha.<br>  <br>  Em rela??o aos filhos, como falaram, cabe aos pais educá-los e mostrar qual melhor caminho seguir, eles poder?o ouvi-los, ou n?o, ent?o n?o adianta ficar proibindo algumas coisas se outras t?o perigosas s?o legalizadas.

PEYbqFcIaa	é crime (penal) e ilícito civil.<br>  <br>  vejamos: <br>  1. calúnia n?o pode ser (pq manter rela??es sexuais, gra?as ao bom deus, n?o é crime - e o tipo penal da calúnia exige acusa??o falsa envolvendo ato criminoso); <br>  2. pode ser difama??o, já que, para ser difama??o, basta que o fato alardeado seja ofensivo à sua reputa??o (n?o é todo mundo que considera sexo ofensivo à reputa??o, mas creio qeu se possa demonstrar perante o juízo que, diante da comunidade religiosa de que faz parte a vítima, houve ofensa), sendo, inclusive, indiferente a veracidade das alega??es, ou seja, mesmo que o "boc?o" esteja falando a verdade, o fato de ele estar ferindo a reputa??o de outras pessoas ainda é crime;<br>  3. o processo por injúria também cabe, se a ofensa for feita diretamente à vítima, como uma agress?o verbal (para cobrir a hipótese de seu conhecido ter sofrido a ofensa pessoamente, sem intermédio do diz-que-me-disse).<br>  <br>  De qq modo, é bom ter em mente o seguinte: primeiro, o processo por qualquer um desses crimes é o que chamamos de "a??o penal privada", ou seja, é processo em que n?o basta "chamar a polícia". a vítima tem que apresentar queixa-crime, munida de advogado, e acompanhar o processo. além disso, o processo em si é meio besta, constituído, na maior parte das vezes, de testemunhos... a n?o ser que alguem tenha alguma coisa por escrito. outro detalhe é que nesse tipo de crime (calúnia ou difama??o), se o cara se retratar, isto é, vier a público pedir desculpas, etc, antes de ser condenado, o juiz n?o pode mais puni-lo. <br>  e, mesmo que ele n?o se retrate, como as penas s?o muito pequenas, ele é julgado no juizado especial e, normalmente, faz-se uma transa??o penal (o cara paga uma multa, ou umas cestas-básicas e, na prática, fica com a ficha limpa).<br>  além disso, pelo menos em s?o paulo, a maior parte das a??es do juizado especial criminal prescreve (deixa de valer porque passou tempo demais) sem chegar a julgamento.<br>  <br>  por isso, o melhor mesmo é entrar no cível, pleiteando indeniza??o pelos danos morais causados através do ilícito civil. é mais eficaz, entende? se a idéia é fazer as pessoas pensarem duas vezes antes de saírem metendo o bedelho na vida sexual alheia, fazer com que elas paguem (literalmente, em dinheiro) por isso é uma boa. sem contar que, como a a??o vai ser no juizado especial cível, n?o precisa de advogado, o que barateia muito a a??o.<br>  <br>  de qq forma, a justi?a é lenta e cara. esse tipo de coisa enche muitíssimo o saco. melhor uma arbitragem, ou uma media??o.<br>  <br>  boa sorte!|`|Qp8ftzLaaa	comentar um ato que v? n?o escondeu,n?o é crime.Além disso houve algum constrangimento?|`|r6nnurMgaa	Deve se enquadrar em difama??o.

La mayoria de las leyes<br>  a nivel mundial van a proceder de una manera similar de <br>  entrada, el testamento; si la cabeza de familia ( el padre ),<br>  nunca se preocupo de  hacer en vida un testamento y todo<br>  estaba legalmente registrado bajo el nombre del padre o <br>  de la pareja, una de las cosas que pasarian, si la casa se   <br>  esta pagando todavia, el banco la reposesiona, igual los carros.

Pero aunque se trate de un foro libre y de un país democrático, no significa que se pueda decir cualquier cosa. La libertad de expresión tiene un límite y no podemos tolerar que se hagan preguntas o comentario que promuevan la homofóbia, el racismo, la violencia, la xenofóbia, el terrorismo y/o la intolerancia. <br>  <br>  Nunca notificado un abuso a alguien con una visión política diferente a la mía.. Me da igual como si la gente apoya al PSOE como al PP, como si son independentistas o quieren recuperar Gibraltar.. Me da igual.<br>  <br>  Pero si algún imbécil viene a decir que se justifica usar el terrorismo para liberar un territorio; si algún neonazi viene a promulgar sus ideales de una raza superior o de acabar con todo los homosexuales; si algún facha le da por sugerir que acabemos con el Euskera matando a todos los vascos; o a algún marido pregunta como debe pegarle a su mujer para que no se note... Pues yo soy el primero en notificar un abuso, esperando que se elimine la cuenta del desgraciado o al menos la pregunta.<br>  <br>  Hay ciertas cosas que no son permisibles. Me da igual lo que piense la gente, pero hay que basarse en unas normas morales y de convivencia mínimas. Tanto Bush, como Aznar o Chávez me caen fatal, pero nunca apoyaría una iniciativa de pegarles un tiro en la cabeza.<br>  <br>  Conclusión, un rotundo si a la censura..

Lo curioso,y es de lo que no se da cuenta,que más allá de pensarse que esa pretendida “maldad” suya para estereotipar es ingeniosa, resulta de lo más burda y zopenca que uno pueda encontrarse por aquí. Lo simpático de la cuestión es que cree que duerme con la manta moral de insultar para despues,con un giro de 360o,hacer preguntas lastimosas y lagrimeantes;y escudarse en sus seguidores ideológicos,de los que nada tengo en contra. Es curioso como alguien con tanto “talante”,se esté haciendo de tantas enemistades,ya que supuestamente se la da de “caballero del debate”.Pero no es así.Ya Lady West se ha dado cuenta de ello.?Dónde está el caballero?.Qué curioso que a Rex,al que mencionas,ni a Rafael,de sesgo ideológico marcadamente de izquierdas (el último),anda metido en las ′”movidas” en las que tú andas,?qué ocurre machote?. últimamente,está tremendamente nervioso,ambivalente,capaz de demandar al ratoncito de Yahoo por su eliminación de preguntas,y siendo respondidodo por éste haciéndole callar la gran bocaza que posee. Es lo que tiene,a veces,pensarse y creerse “Vox Populi”.

Fíjate que Corelli,no siendo santo de mi devoción,me respondió pareciéndome incluso simpático lo que comentó.<br>  <br>  Pero,éste,se pensará que al asertivo Hattori o al divertido Kopadnokova les puede decir algo así,y no contestarles éstos por educación,pero va a ser que a mí no me infla los huevos a patadas ni mi padre,Kiedis,fíjate qué cosas,mi estilo es parecido al tuyo,universitario, pero no de tasca,sino de antros y de garitos soeces y chabacanos,sórdidos,de gran ciudad;vamos,si quieres,nos ponemos.Menuda mezcla ,?no Kiedis?.Relájate.?Tú puedes lanzar suposiciones de,con respecto a algunos amigos,quien te censura,y ,en cambio,montas en cólera cuando lanzo una hipótesis tan solo?,je je. <br>  <br>  Mejor podríamos estrecharnos la mano,dejarlo estar,y quedamos en Madrid,sitio céntrico,te ense?o algunos garitos (no son de tasca de pueblo),y te doy un paseo por la calle Montera (adivina que habrá allí),sé que igual te gusta.

El problema está en el sistema que usa Yahoo para procesar esa información y los cerrados criterios que tienen.<br>  <br>  POR ESO EL 30 NADIE ENTRA, HUELGA DE TECLADOS CAíDOS, NO A LA CENSURA, NO A LAS NOTIFICACIONES GRATUITAS Y COBARDES.<br>  <br>  Acá todos somos víctimas, dejemos nuestras creencias de lado para unirnos en contra de la intolerancia. Eso es lo que hace falta en el mundo, unión entre las personas.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDITADO: Para Kiedis, sabes, me ha dado mucha pena el leer los insultos cobardes que le diste a Diana en su pregunta sospechosamente borrada (no pude responderla ya que cuando entré ya no estaba), realmente te me caíste Kiedis y yo que te consideraba uno de los "caballeros" de Y!R, eso que hiciste no es de caballeros y menos de personas que pregonan el argumento válido como la mejor arma. Simplemente al leerte acá no sé si eres el mismo o tienes algún problema médico con el litio, porque parecen dos personas diferentes. Eso de estar difamando a las mujeres respetables del foro es de muy mal gusto y peor aún insultándonos a todos los latinoamericanos diciéndonos latifundistas necesitados de mamporreros, pero acaso eso es de hombrecitos, si a Diana no le puedes ya refutar pues déjala y no insultes que no eres consecuente con tu predicamento. Repito, que pena me has dado.<br>  <br>  EDITADO: Ok Kiedis, si de algo se trata este foro es justamente para rescatar a las personas valiosas para fomentar el debate alturado. Yo no creo que el respeto a la mujer sea un anacronismo, disculpa pero ahí si estoy en total desacuerdo contigo, y las reglas de cortesía, al tacho por culpa de un arranque de cólera por una pregunta o respuesta que al fin y al cabo no son tan importantes como la mesura y la cordialidad entre nosotros los foristas. Yo creo desde mi humilde opinión que le dabemos de bajar un poco el tono a la cosa ya que si esto se está convirtiendo en un cajellón de mercado, pues queda desvirtuado absolutamente todo, incluso el mismo espíritu primigenio de este juego, ya sólo eso es, un juego al fin y al cabo y no es pretexto para mansillar a personas honorables de ninguno de los dos lados. Mira yo no soy ninguna cucufata ni mucho menos, pero esa actitud condescendiente para con las gentes de américa latina, es un derrotero bastante facilista por su grosera generalización. O sea que si mis bisabuelos se rompieron el lomo para construír país y riqueza a punta de la última tecnología exsistente, y así tener una ventaja capital, resulta que es culpa de ellos haber sido pioneros de la industrialización de nuestros pueblos. Además que con las grandes empresas que se formaron no se dio acaso mano de obra y sueldos decentes a los trabajadores, los mismos que se hubieran muerto de hambre si todo esto no ocurría. Yo no sé que pienses desde la lejana Espa?a, pero acá hay dos tipos de gentes, los que dan trabajo y los que trabajan, si eso te parece inhumano habría que dejarlos a su libre albedrío a ver como sólo les queda mendigarle al estado subsidios catastróficos y completamente anacrónicos y peligrosos.<br>  Hasta ahora Kiedis, no le hayo la hilación a tu pensar, qué sería lo que pretendes, que los industriales repartan la riqueza entre todo el pueblo para volverlos haraganes y dependientes, o qué. Las benditas reformas cooperativistas se dieron y fracasaron rotundamente; para gerenciar hay que tener espíritu de lucha y conocimientos técnicos y financieros, y eso no lo pueden pretender todas las personas sino las más aptas, y es que por la otra parte también la mano de obra calificada y técnica es parte sustancial al desarrollo de la empresa privada y así yo lo veo, como una simbiosis natural y social en dónde cada uno aporta desde su trinchera para el bien común.<br>  Pero para refutar este tipo de argumentos no es necesaria la grosería y el insulto, sino mas bien un contraste nítido de ideas y contrapuntos.<br>  <br>  Veremos pues cómo nos comportamos de ahora en adelante todos ya que necesitamos rescatar este foro de la hediondez en donde se encuentra. Sé que yo no te voy a convencer de nada ni tú a mí, pero en el intento está la genialidad y la diversión privada en cada uno (si la tienen).<br>  <br>  Pero lo de Diana...... eso no te lo perdono y no acepto el argumento de que el respeto a la mujer ya pasó de moda. Eso es lamentable en una persona como tú.<br>  <br>  Saludos kiedis, acá termino mi intervención en esta pregunta que ya me olvidé cuál era, mira si soy malcriada de hacerla a un lado para salir en defensa de mis amigas. Bye.<br>  <br>  (Ah, y por supuesto que no eres machista, cómo podrías serlo, if you know what i mean).<br>  <br>  EDITADO: La última frase es un halago por si acaso, el hecho de que estés un poquito a la defensiva te hace ver cosas que no son, y realmente no entiendo el escandalillo ya que al tener muchas connotaciones, el destinatario se identificará en la que más se siente aludido. Eres un caballero refinado de costumbres biencriadas, y por eso no te creo capaz de algo tan bruto y paleolítico como ser machista, eso es todo mi amor. No sé qué entendiste. <br>  Un beso y todos mis cari?os.<br>  <br>  EDITADO: Y no me compares con Diana, ella es infinitamente más inteligente que todos nosotro juntos.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDITADO: Tomataroja me disculpo por usufructuar tu espacio para hacer uso de ciertos derechos de réplica y de defensa.

Valenciano<br>  ---------------- -----------------------<br>  - Cuando conocí a Valenciano era un ni?ato con complejo de inferioridad que iba acosando e insultando a la gente sin ton ni son. Gente de lo mejor de este foro como Corelli, πilli y un largo etc. eran objeto de persecución e insulto diario de este energumeno total porque no comportíamos su racismo y su xenofobia. De aquellas manejaba hasta 5 o 6 cuentas e insultaba tanto que cada semana le zumbaban una de ellas. Después de decirle cuatro cosas y de darme cuenta de que era un pobre chavalote falto de afecto y con la misma empatía que un psicopata decidí ignorarlo.<br>  <br>  - Hace poco, contestó a una de mis preguntas y lo hizo de una forma seria y respetuosa y además vi que la pregunta había sido avalada por Rex, uno de los miembros que más respeto de este foro y pensé que el Valen había madurado y puesto que en esa pregunta y en la respuesta que me dió me invitaba a que le respondiese pues lo hice: di mi humilde opinión. Pero como con quien ni?os duerme se levanta meado resulta que a pesar de que mi respuesta había sido seria y largamente argumentada, pues me descalifica personalmente y me asegura que aunque en ese momento no podía (presuntamente se iba de fin de semana) en cuanto pudiera me iba a dar una estocada, la definitiva según el ????. Después de esa bufonada, ya sabeis los que me conoceis como soy yo por las malas, pues al valen como dicen los argentinos le "di su comidita". El tipo se puso tan nervioso que en información adicional me mandó un mensaje hasta 5 veces. Cuando me iba a mofar del asunto me encuentro que la pregunta ha sido eliminada.<br>  <br>  - Curiosamente, el Valen, el día anterior, al hablar de la censura mantuvo una peregrina teoría de que yajú tenía un poderoso algoritmo informático que censuraba ciertas preguntas según el tema tratado. La teoría me pareció una tontería a la que no di importancia porque iba acorde con el que la enunciaba. Yo soy de la opinión de que la censura se produce tras una serie de reportes de varios usuarios. Pues bien, ahora resulta que su pregunta la he eliminado yo: el algoritmo Kiedis, amo de yajú y de todas las cosas, el que decide que preguntas se eliminan y las que no. Es del genero tonto pensar que tras escribir 4 folios deseo que elimen una pregunta (más cuando mi respuesta estaba muy bien puntuada por otros usuarios) pero es que es lo que tiene ser bobo, ?verdad Valen?<br>  <br>  - Bien, pues a pesar que tengo el correo habilitado (al contrario que el cagón de Valen), pues el tipejo lanza una acusación a mis espaldas de la que me entero gracias a un amigo que me advierte. Asi, por las espaldas y a tración es como actua el Valen y los de su cala?a. Además curiosamente, por lo que veo por la hora de publicación de esta respuesta, la acusación la manda 3 horas después de decirme que no podía rebatirme porque tenía que irse urgentemente. Vamos que se cagó por lo pantalones. Por lo menos a mi hizo el amago de contestarme (o de decirme que lo haría en un futuro, más bien) pero a Corelli ni se atrevió a decirle ni "mu". Aunque al Valen le gusta llevar las disputas al terreno personal, Corelli es un peso demasiado pesado para él. Valenciano ?en que salí trasquilado si no llegaste a rebatir nada de mi respuesta con excusas de mal pagador? ?Crees que un par de descalificaciones tuyas hacia mi persona es suficiente para "ponerme nervioso"? Mequetrefe....<br>  <br>  Valenciano: te voy a explicar un par de trucos que utlizo últimamente cuando me eliminan una respuesta o una pregunta muy larga que me lleva tiempo escribir:<br>  1) la escribo en el word (es más comodo) y la archivo antes de pasarla al yajú. Asi si la borran no la pierdo.<br>  2) busco la pregunta eliminada en google y le doy a En cache. El cache de Google es un servicio que tiene este popular buscador para el caso de que no puedas acceder por alguna razón a una página, pues ellos guardan en sus servidores una copia de la misma. En el caso de tu pregunta, esta fue la copia que guardaron:<br>  <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:EFgSyOYeD3sJ:espanol.answers.yahoo.com/question/index%3Fqid%3D20071123134023AAyOvvW+valenciano+vestrynge&hl=es&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=es" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:EFg...</a><br>  <br>  Vuelve a publicar esa pregunta ( con el link que te he dejado lo tienes muy fácil) y yo volveré a responderte lo mismo. Eso si, será la última pregunta a la que te conteste. Yo soy uno de los pocos que va quedando en este foro que contesto a los que no piensan como yo. Y lo hago por la sencilla razón que crei que esto era un foro para debatir, no para que la gente nos hiciemos "ma.madas colectivas" unos a otros. Esa actitud por mi parte de contradecir al que pregunta encabrona a mucha gente, por lo que me he ganado el sobrenombre de Kamikaze o de Pistolas y el resultado es que normalmente terminan por buscarme las cosquillas. Pero en fin, por lo que veo últimamente aqui lo que impera es juntarse en una tribu, meterse en una trinchera y una vez bien tapaditos a los demás ni agua, solo entrar en las preguntas para darle a la banderita y después hipocritamente acusar a los contrarios. Yo podré ser brutote pero no tengo las dobleces ni la cobardía de algun@s.<br>  <br>  Salu2<br>  __________<br>  Lady West:<br>  1) Yo no soy machista y en mis respuestas no distingo a hombre de mujeres. Eso de "atacar a una dama" me suena a trasnochado. Ni yo soy un caballero (ni pretendo serlo, soy hijo de obreros/campesinos) ni tu Diana es una dulce damisela.<br>  2) Si, es cierto, no me gustan los terratenientes o los latifundistas, sobre todo en sitios donde la gente pasa mucha hambre, como pasa en zonas de Sudamerica. Que en paises agrícolas como El Salvador 300 familias posean el 95% de la tierra cultibable no es de mi agrado y tampoco lo es que estos grandes terratenientes contraten a matones para reprimir a la gente que pide justicia social, como estamo cansados de ver en la prensa internacional. Ya sabes que soy de izquierdas, asi que no se porque te sorprendes. ?A que latinoamericanos insulto? ?A los latifundistas? Vaya, pobrecitos, estarán tristisimos en sus inmensas haciendas ante tal atrevimiento por mi parte.<br>  3) Tu amiga Diana me insultó previamente llamandome falso y mentiroso sin que yo le hubiese provocado con anterioridad. Ella misma lo reconoció y tengo muchos tesigos. Yo le he respondido con la misma moneda y le he dicho que la falsa es ella. ?Que yo no puedo rebatirla? En la pregunta que mencionas escribi tres folios de puros y respetuosos argumentos a los que ella contestó reiterandose en los insultos. Solo después le devolví la moneda. ?Quien no puedo rebatir a quien?<br>  4) Tu has sido la que en su día decidiste hacerte amiga mía mandandome una invitación. Desde entonces siempre has tenido un trato respetuoso conmigo y aunque no coincidimos ideologicamente en nada y hemos debatido en algunos puntos jamás hemos tenido ningún problema. Es más, siempre que me lo has pedido te he ayudado. Ni lo que me cuentas ahora tampoco me ofende o me enfada. Entiendo que si yo me peleo con una de tus amigas tu salgas en su defensa. Tal como se están poniendo las cosas parece que no queda otra que justificar a los "tuyos" aunque no tengan justificación posible. Tambien entiendo que tu "tribu" no te perdonaría que hicieses otra cosa que no fuera atacarme después de lo de Diana. Bien, buena chica, ya has cumplido. Lo que no entiendo es que tu amiga me haya insultado sin razón alguna. ?Que si me ha pasado algo? Pues si, me he cansado de hipocresías y estoy harto que junto a la que pregunta, somos dos de los que primero recibimos un ataque brutal y organizado de eliminación de preguntas. Fue de aquellas, cuando tuve que cambiar de cuenta por el acoso al que estaba siendo sometido, que otros usuarios me advirtieron que en mi red privada había dos o tres personas que podían estar acuchillandome por la espalda, y uno de los nombres que daban todos era el tuyo. Pues bien, yo les contesté que creía en tu honestidad y que te mantendría como amiga.<br>  <br>  Te digo lo mismo que a Valenciano. El problema de este foro es que hay mucha gente que se pone de los nervios en cuanto les llevas la contraria. Y yo soy de los pocos que ahora mismo se atreven a entrar en una pregunta y argumentadamente decirle lo que no quieren oir los que preguntan.<br>  <br>  Y te lo repito y te lo confirmo, yo no soy un caballero, soy un humilde chico de barrio y la ley del barrio es muy simple: respeto para el que respeta y ca?a para el que trata de pisarte. Eso si, yo la "ca?a" siempre la doy por delante y nunca me escondo ni utilizo a mamporreros.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, creo que no entendiste lo que significa la palabra mamporrero en Espa?a. La palabra mamporrero viene de mamporro que según la RAE significa: "Golpe, coscorrón, pu?etazo"<br>  <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=mamporro" rel="nofollow">http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta...</a><br>  Por tanto mamporrero es un matón a sueldo, alguien que se contrata para golpear a un tercero. Tu amiga Diana con sus insultos hacia mi persona y los halagos hacia Tonyss en su pregunta pretendía buscarse un mamporrero. Y tiene unos cuantos. Tengo un montón de correos de gente que no conozco insultandome de la peor forma a raiz de lo de Diana. ?Te los reenvío a tu correo para que veas lo que significa en espa?ol de Espa?a "mamporrero"?<br>  _________<br>  Lady West: Como ya deberías saber tu y yo tenemos ideologías distintas. Si el que yo tenga una visión critica de los latinfundistas o de los grandes capitalistas te molesta, pues lo siento, es lo que hay. Y que a ti te moleste que tu amiga le haya llamado falsa, hipocrita y mentirosa pero que no te moleste que los mismos calificativos me los haya dedicado a mi ella primero, con la excusa de que ella es una mujer, pues que quieres que te diga, no lo comparto. Para mi es tan malo que insulte un hombre como una mujer. ?Que este foro se está convirtiendo en una verdulería? Si. Lo gracioso es que es una verdulería sin "verduleros". Aqui todo el mundo ataca e insulta pero después siempre son los otros los malos. Yo por lo menos cuando tiro la piedra no soy como tu amiga Diana, que esconde la mano. Esa actitud suya tan hipócrita y cinica si te puedo jurar que saca lo peor que hay en mi. Primero me ataca y me insulta (embustero y falso) y despúes me dice que solo era una ironía. En fin, supongo que serán cosas de "damas" que por no ser un caballero no entiendo (ni quiero entender jamás)<br>  <br>  Por cierto, ?la última insinuación que encierra tu última frase tambien es propio de una dama amante del debate sin descalificaciones?<br>  _______<br>  Valen: para insultarme (me has llamado putero, incluso ????) no hace falta tanta verborrea. ?Escocido? Que se le va a hacer, meu, ya sabes como soy. Si no quieres que te den no insultes ni me supliques que responda a tus preguntas como has hecho. Lo que pasas es que tu has olido mi sangre al ver a otros usarios intentando morderme y te comportaste como los tiburones, has pretendido enga?arme haciendote el respetuoso para atraerme hacia una de tus preguntas para después iniciarme un frente mes, táctica estilo Stalin. Por cierto, que diría Lady West si se enterase de tus preguntas xenofobas y racistas o de tus continuas apelaciones a πilli de que dejara yajú y se fuera a fregar los platos o la vez que le llamaste a Corelli viejo gagá? Por cierto lo de insultar con lo de viejo veo que es recurrente en ti, porque a mi y a Rafael tambien nos ha tocado. En algo te doy la razón. Rafael y Rex son indudablemente mejores foristas que yo. Y que tu ya no digamos. Por cierto, vi que Rex, eso si de una forma más "fina", compartía punto por punto algunas de las opiniones que he expresado sobre ti. Ahora campeón, ya sabes, a rajar por detrás como sueles y a esto no contestes. Y "morra o conto" que ya le he dado demasiada bola a un pelanas como tu.<br>  ______<br>  Lady West: ya, entiendo de que va el juego... Tal y como le dije a Diana creo que tu eres infinitamente más inteligente que ella y se nota en todo. Pasalo bien. Gracias por el besito y por todo el inmenso cari?o que me profesas.

bd5a4bc5323a2fca257ebbacf6e8a69baa	I liberi professionisti se si candidano non possono partecipare direttamente agli appalti del comune in cui sono consiglieri. In tutti i modi in tante realtà italiane candidarsi per un libero professionista pregiudica in negativo la carriera professionale ed allo stesso tempo non candidarsi o non partecipare in qualche altra forma alla vita pubblica lo esclude da eventuali interessamenti, dei vincitori delle elezioni, alla sua professionalità.<br>  Un mio consiglio è: io non mi candiderei oppure se mi candidassi dovrei essere il numero 1 cioè il sindaco.|`|FxtBxmPdaa	Io credo che il primo vincolo di ineleggibilità debba essere una pregressa condanna civile o penale. Per il resto perchè si dovrebbe impedire ad una categoria di cittadini di occuparsi di pubblica amministrazione o di politica? <br>  Sul fatto che un libero professionista potrebbe veder pregiudicata la propria carriera, è possibile  - se la persona si comporta correttamente - che il tempo dedicato alla politica sia sottratto alla professione e quindi il volume d'affari potrebbe diminuire, Comunque, anche rimanendo nell'ordine dell'assoluta onestà, i vantaggi indiretti (anche per la professione) di una carica pubblica sono molti.|`|JRDXrAibaa	l'elettorato passivo, cioè il diritto di essere votato è una garanzia costituzionale! <br>  In un sistema democratico rappresentativo, dove cioè il potere dello Stato si fonda sulla volontà dei cittadini, espressa dai loro rappresentanti in Parlamento, ognuno ha il diritto di eleggere i suoi rappresentanti (dai consiglieri comunali ai deputati e senatori) e di essere a sua volta eletto. Nel primo caso si parla di elettorato attivo, nel secondo di elettorato passivo. Ci sono alcune cause di ineleggibilità, che rendono cioè impossibile l'elezione. Per esempio alcuni cittadini già investiti di funzioni pubbliche, come i consiglieri regionali, i sindaci dei più grandi Comuni, i prefetti, gli ufficiali superiori delle Forze armate, i magistrati, nel luogo in cui svolgono la loro attività, non possono essere eletti al Parlamento se non rinunciano alla loro carica: in questo modo si è voluto impedire che la loro posizione li favorisse.|`|WkNa2PpSaa	Ovviamente chiunque può candidarsi in una lista, civica o di "robe parlamentari" come dice gabricontrasto(chi lo dice che ci vuole la laurea?e poi citi la costituzione?vergognati) quanta ignoranza!|`|ms8lE9HWaa	ho sentito k solamente i laureati possono candidarsi..se intendi per le robe parlamenteri.. kmq  adesso in parlamento la magg  lavora in neroo. pensa k e anticostituzionale.. k pessimo..i parlamentari nella propria sede non riescona a gestirsi figurati se parliamo di altro..|`|gYdsCvtaaa	Può candidarsi sì, perché no?|`|NVNX9Anmaa	Assolutamente nò qualunque sia il suo partito.|`|058548d5609a3a4b96c02ec8c6aaa842aa	Certo che può! <br>  <br>  Io conosco un parlamentare della mia zona che fa il commercialista, è in parlamento, in consiglio comunale e in consiglio provinciale.|`|F7At5jzDaa	Si tutti possiamo: però non dobbiamo lasciarci condizionare della mafia, e delle mazzette.|`|ItejJ4z2aa	si si, non cè incompatibilità far i due incarichi!|`|d7c6c638c0561524df85458c5c2b5b44aa	Beh, l'entrata in politica crea sempre dei nuovi amici e tanti nuovi nemici.

But I do not believe that when members of Congress are voting on party lines that they are ignoring their own constituents.<br>  <br>  {edit}<br>  I got the message from Yahoo about becoming a contact. Not sure how that works.<br>  Anyway, I ought to clarify that I do not mean to suggest that any congressman's responsibility is to consult a public opinion poll (nationally or of their own constituents) every time that they vote on some important legislation. I despise politicians whose fingers are always testing which way the wind is currently blowing. My point is that most American voters will tend to vote for politicians who share their general values. We don't elect the most effecient poll-consulters, we elect people whom we trust will exercise sound judgment. And we tend to think that people who do share our own values will have sounder judgment than someone whom we strongly disagree with. I am right-of-center and so I (used to) vote Republican. I didn't expect my Republican congressman to always vote exactly the same way that I would have every time, but I did expect to agree with my congressman MOST of the time. He and I both belonged to the Republican party for highly similar reasons.<br>  Anyone can point to any particular vote that has occurred in Congress and then compare that vote to the results of a national poll and say "See? Congress isn't representing the people!" And as quick as you point out that one vote, I can just as easily point out a vote on some other major issue -- for example, the minimum wage -- and say "See? Congress IS representing the people!"<br>  Congress's responsibility is not to consult an opinion poll, it is to exercise sound judgment.|`|AA11005975	Yes.|`|260a3f142f7a0c0675bd228caaedcc15aa	To my knowledge,which is pitifully scarce,YES!Only the first two parties were the WHIGS and Torry's.The Torry Party being loyal to the 'Crown'.The Whigs were the revolutionary faction which was a carry-over from Scotland where it originated.The aim of the Whigs was to overthrow the 'Aristocracy'.Now,I for one agree with your frustration,and would like to see a resurgence of the 'WHIGS'here today in America to rid ourselves of the modern-day aristocracy which is leading our country down the road to 'Perdition'.Please contact me,"Link"|`|b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	Yes--pretty much. The party line voting is more pronounced the last few years--but it's always been that way.<br>  <br>  But (although I llike to gripe about it too) it's inevitable.  If you look at other democratic governments you will find the pattern is universal.  The reason is simple.  In order for any legislation to pass, it has to have a majority.  And that means that some sort of consensus has to be built over whatever issue is under consideration.   A degree of organization is necessary to build such consensus--and in and of itself, that's okay<br>  <br>  The problem is when party interests are placed above the public interest--and that happens all too often.  But--we, as citizens, have no one but ourselves to blame.  We vote these people into office--and re-elect them when we know good and well they are corrupt--because of which party they belong to--or because some of that pork barrel spending everyone likes to be righteous about landed in our district.|`|ade7b43bd34ef6780a2f8edb19c1d5feaa	you are right-----it IS frustrating-------and we better remember how they vote when we go to the polls each and every time---------and we also better let our senators and our representatives in the house know we are watching them-----they tend to be a little more honest when they know the public has become stirred up and are watching them.

It is just one of those things that people don't understand because they have watched to much CSI and Law and Order.|`|5c2491bd314b906969d7d9b49e9694aeaa	Miranda warning<br>  n. the requirement, also called the Miranda rule, set by the U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona (1966) that prior to the time of arrest and any interrogation of a person suspected of a crime, he/she must be told that he/she has: the right to remain silent, the right to legal counsel, and the right to be told that anything he/she says can be used in court against him/her. The warnings are known as Miranda rights or just "rights." Further, if the accused person confesses to the authorities, the prosecution must prove to the judge that the defendant was informed of these rights and knowingly waived them, before the confession can be introduced in the defendant's criminal trial. The Miranda rule supposedly prevents self-incrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Sometimes there is a question of admissibility of answers to questions made by the defendant before he/she was considered a prime suspect, raising a factual issue as to what is a prime suspect and when does a person become such a suspect?|`|WfyhDhecaa	Miranda has nothing to do with hindering anything. It was put in place so that you couldn't be forced to confess to anything you didn't do. Don't believe me? look it up.

However, if it does affect the outcome of the charges in any way, it will be because the prior DUI combined with the new drug charge can show a pattern of substance abuse. I know that that seems ridiculous being how long ago they are, but the prosecutor or judge may bring that up.

C'est à dire les investissements qui permettent la création d'emploi, améliorent la productivité,créent des produits a plus fortes valeurs ajoutés et au final permettent plus de rentrées fiscales...<br>  <br>  Le bouclier fiscal mis en place mis en place par Sarkozy profite aux contribuables les plus aisés en premier lieu, mais beaucoup moins à ceux qui contribue efficacement à la croissance, à savoir les PME qui sont l'écrasante majorité du tissu économique fran?ais, et de fait les plus grands contributeurs aux rentrées fiscales de l'état.<br>  <br>  Au lieu de faire un cadeau de plusieurs milliards a des privilégiés, ce qui n'aura qu'un impact minimal sur l'économie fran?aise (mais qui va encore creuser le déficit déjà mal en point), il aurait été plus avisé de soutenir le développement des PME et leurs investissements. C'est ce que les allemands réalisent depuis plus de 10 ans, avec les succès qu'on voit aujourd'hui.<br>  <br>  En ce qui concerne l'augmentation des rentrées fiscales aux USA de 2003 dont tu parles, elles étaient en partie le fait d'une conjoncture économique favorable portée par les commandes phénoménales d'armement de Bush aux industriels américains, ainsi que le résultat sur du moyen terme d'une politique d'investissement et de baisse d'imp?ts "ciblés" mis en place par Clinton au début de son premier mandat.<br>  <br>  Pour infos: <a href="http://www.forumgc.org/spip.php?article665" rel="nofollow">http://www.forumgc.org/spip.php?article6...</a>|`|WqmpnGtVaa	Enfin, quelqu'un de réfléchi dans ce site...<br>  <br>  c'est d'une logique implacable|`|YqdnygGMaa	t'as rien compris!!|`|Zd2fuT96aa	Seulement 2100 personnes en France ont beneficie du bouclier fiscal, tu crois que 2100 personnes vont relancer la croissance de la France a eux tout seul ??<br>  De plus tu oublies aussi que pour que ta theorie soit valable il faut que le revenu ainsi degage par la baisse fiscale soit depense ou investi en France ... Or les "riches" qui ont deja tout en France investissent en priorite a l'etranger (immobilier, voyages, voitures haut de gamme allemandes ...).<br>  <br>  En Suede, Norvege et Danemak, le taux de prelevement sur les salaires peut atteindre 60% ...

31RCY8kIaa	ce ne serait que justice, ils ont aidé à développer un pays qui en était encore au moyen age<br>  et qui y est hélas retourné depuis|`|y113MSnZaa	C'est la France qui doit restituer aux algériens tout ce qu'elle a pillée en plus d'EXCUSES publiques pour le génocide fran?ais en Algérie......<br>  <br>  Conquête fran?aise  <br>   Article détaillé : Conquête de l'Algérie.<br>   <br>  Attaque d'Alger par l'amiral Dupperé, le 13 juin 1830Contrairement au Maroc et à la Tunisie, la conquête de l’Algérie fut longue et particulièrement violente puisqu’elle s’est traduite par la disparition de près du tiers de la population algérienne. <br>  <br>  L’armée fran?aise l’a soumise village après village, mais il faut préciser que ce qui caractérise la colonisation de l’Algérie et tient lieu de particularité est qu’il s’agit d’une colonie de peuplement.<br>  <br>  En 1794, lorsque la France révolutionnaire était attaquée par les puissances européennes coalisées, et éprouvait des difficultés à nourrir sa population et ses soldats. <br>  <br>  Le dey d’Alger Hussein offrit à la Convention toutes facilités pour faire ses achats de blé, consentant aussi par la suite sous le directoire un prêt d’argent sans intérêts. La guerre terminée, les régimes qui se succèdent n’honorent pas la dette, et quand la France redevient royaliste la dette est revue à la baisse et payée mais à Paris à la caisse des dép?ts et consignations; un nombre important de créanciers vrais ou supposés, des commer?ants livournais qui avaient servi d’intermédiaires se manifestent alors. <br>  <br>  Ainsi, sous couvert de satisfaire leurs réclamations, on avait ? rendu légale sa spoliation ?[10]. Le dey est donc en froid avec le consul de France car il comprend qu’il ne récupérera pas son argent, et que les livraisons de blé ne lui seront jamais payées.<br>  <br>  En 1827, le dey d’Alger découvre que la France avait fortifié à l’extrémité est de la Régence à La Calle un entrep?t dont elle avait la concession pour faire du commerce, et qu’elle s'était engagé à ne pas fortifier[10]. <br>  <br>  N’obtenant pas d’explications de la part du gouvernement fran?ais, le 30 avril 1827 le dey en demanda verbalement au consul de France. Le consul ignorant ouvertement sa demande, prit donc de haut le dey qui s’emporta alors, injuria, et finalement donna au ? représentant de la France ? un coup de son éventail. <br>  <br>  Si l’on s’en réfère à Robert Louzon, militant anticolonialiste engagé, c’est donc bien l’affaire des fortifications de La Calle et non simplement la dette restée impayée qui était à l’origine de l’énervement du dey d’Alger[11][12].<br>  <br>   Le gouvernement de la restauration et Charles X, soucieux de redorer l’image de la France à l’étranger et de renforcer l’autorité royale en France, trouvèrent alors dans cet incident – un outrage à la France par le biais de son ? représentant ?, le consul – un prétexte pour intervenir militairement[13].|`|6bMAh1ESaa	Ouais si tu part sur ce principe la, pourquoi la France n'indemniserait pas les familles algériennes dont les terres et les batiments ont été réquisitionnées par les colons Fran?ais au moment de la colonisation au 19ème. <br>  Sans compter les indemnisations des familles massacrées par l'armée Fran?aise pour cause de pacification, ?a va faire beaucoup d'argent à payer tu crois pas ?|`|7E5BbMrqaa	si tout le monde devait remboursé les malheureux de la colonisation et de la décolonisation<br>  je crois bien que l ordre actuel des choses"pays développés et tiers monde" ne sera pas le même, les riches dans le sud et les pauvres dans le nord.<br>  la guerre d Algerie est une histoire très compliquée et ce n est jamais le moment pour étudier cette partie de l histoire correctement.<br>  je pense qu on aura bien des surprises si la France prenait la peine de faire un travail de fond sur cette guerre coimme pour  la 1ère et la 2nd guerre mondiale.<br>  ciao|`|FWrRCxfraa	oui et vice versa!|`|Ye59JsZkaa	oui !!!|`|XTznfNFnaa	ils ont étaient indemnisés par le gouvernement fran?ais il y à quelques années!|`|su35HKVSaa	les francais ,on ne les avaient pas inviter a venir occuper leur pays

eea9c45e6c071ffd38c715e3470bde92aa	Hola Morena, apoyo el reclamo del sector rural, porque todos tenemos derecho a reclamar, no apoyo la forma, porque no tienen derecho a cerrar la ruta ni impedir el abastecimiento o que otros sectores puedan seguir funcionando, hay peque?os comerciantes que viven el día a día y nadie los ayudará a pagar sus deudas después de tener cerrado por falta de mercadería, no existen subsidios y emergencias para ellos. Yo como trabajadora, también estoy haciendo el esfuerzo por sobrevivir y no puedo circular libremente ni tener los alimentos en mi mesa y eso me dá bronca. El gobierno es autoritario, y se equivocó en su forma en el discurso, pero hay sectores rurales que también son soberbios y luchan por el poder de quien puede más, en el  medio estamos nosotros, los que laburamos siempre y somos los menos escuchados, odio la gente paga, los que perciben dinero del estado a cambio de aplausos, la prepotencia de ambas partes, aquí falta diálogo y lamentablemente creo ninguna de los lados cederá. Aqui esta cortada la ruta en éste momento totalmente, y faltan productos en los comercios, quién escucha al laburante? También en mi opinión se están mezclando algunos intereses, y ya va más allá del reclamo, hay grupos apoyando que son opositores al gobierno y a río revuelto ganancia de pescadores, no vote a CK pero creo fué elegida por mayoría y no quiero un golpe de estado que nos retroceda aún más, creo en el voto y que hay que concientizarse en usarlo bien. Quién subiría? Cuál es el "otro" plan hoy? sería bueno una propuesta más que una exigencia...bueno es lo que opino desde mi "calentura" porque están afectando la economía de los peque?os, y mi libertad de actuar, respeto el reclamo, pero debería ser paro tranquera adentro, sin entrega de producción sin afectar a los demás, aquí se sigue cosechando y guardando para cuando el paro se levante, el campo está parando en las rutas y cortando, pero sigue trabajando, los comercios nó, y los ciudadanos comunes no tenemos ya mercadería, ni el derecho de circular. Lamentable de ambos lados la actitud cerrada y testaruda sin mirar alrededor. un besote - Hay cosas como lo de la soja, lo de los productores frutihorticolas que esperan un a?o para sus cosechas y se tuvo que tirar que son verdaderas, imposibles de ignorar.|`|45MX3t1Faa	Estoy a favor del campo!!!!!<br>  Es hora que K decida gobernar y no mirar hacia atrás!!!!|`|98ecb3e765d8e773672dae42e0b1e78caa	Hola Morena <br>  Yo estaba por preguntar lo mismo que vos, porque en realidad todavía no logro tener una opinión clara del asunto. Hasta ayer estaba con el campo a full, pero escuché a CFK ayer, y pensé que en cierto punto tiene razón. Si la mayoría de los campos están sembrados de soja, porque es lo que más se exporta (el 80% de la soja se vende al exterior a precio dólar) y es algo que los argentinos no consumimos, y para colmo desgasta de manera tal la tierra que por 5 a?os que inférti, es lógico que les hagan más retenciones así los productores, en vez de ver conveniente ese tipo de producción, optarían por producir granos que sean favorables a nuestra alimentación. <br>  Por ese lado estoy de acuerdo con ella, pero igual como les tengo tanta desconfianza a los políticos....nunca me termino de convencer.<br>  Sigo con la GRAN DUDA!!!!!!!!|`|STCALHGSaa	En realidad apoyo completamente a los agropecuarios y a los tamberos. Sinceramente el 46 por ciento es mucha plata.

gYJWrvrLaa	Primero no lo hubiese iniciado. Los diálogos se comienzan antes de tomar decisiones tan importantes. Es dificil entonces decir como lo manejaría ya que no hubiese hecho lo mismo que hizo la se?ora Cristina. Ahora, una vez creado el problema, y visto que la situación se le escapa de las manos, lo que menos haría es un discurso tan prepotente como el que hizo. Luego me sentaría en una mesa de diálogo real con todas las partes interesadas, para buscar una solución, y si estoy de acuerdo que para dialogar levanten los cortes de ruta (pues siempre los únicos perjudicados por ello somos todos los restantes argentinos). Y si de distribución de riqueza hablamos, las retenciones para intentar solucionar el problema las implementaría en forma gradual, poniendo un piso para los peque?os y medianos productores. Con los grandes que colaboren más con el país, pero siempre y cuando ese aumento de retenciones sirva realmente para tener más educación, salud, etc, y no para bolsillos propios o de personajes nefastos como D elía. Y sentaría las bases para un programa real para el campo con reglas limpias a mediano y largo plazo, para que no haya sorpresas futuras y se conozcan las conductas o normas que van a regir las relaciones para que no se vuelvan a crear disyuntivas que perjudican a todo el país.|`|esKkNJziaa	Antes que nada! Tendría que evaluar todo el problema para determinar realmente el origen del problema. Para después mediar entre las partes involucradas en el conflicto, yo creo que es más conveniente un buen arreglo que un mal pleito. Y como presidente debo evaluar que se gobierna para un pueblo no para un sector industrial o laboral, a fin de cuentas el pueblo fue quien eligió a la presidenta no los ganaderos o lo agricultores o algún sector productivo de la hermana República de Argentina. <br>  Saludos GUIGI.|`|mCT60hRRaa	Obviamente, en tanto la política es el arte de lo posible, negociaría con el sector, bajo ciertas condiciones. Este conflicto agravado, no hace sino desnudar que se vienen cometiendo errores, en el nivel de la política y la negociación.CFK, tiene un estilo rígido,amenazador y poco contundente, soberbio, por eso las grietas que comienzan a dejarse ver, en diferentes aspectos del del quehacer nacional. Es una forma de ver el asunto. Un abrazo, Orlando,,,|`|tDXGhJywaa	Demostraría un poco de grandeza y jamás hubiera dicho un discurso como el del otro día, con soberbia y bajeza en ciertos terminos, lo unico que logro fue que todo empeore mas todavía. El nive de onmipotencia es tan grande que dudo la haga ver algo diferente.<br>  Hay que negociar y trataría de informarme mejor acerca de lo que provocan las retenciones en los productores y que mis asesores me expliquen porque la suba de retenciones impediría la suba de precios, si la soja se exporta casi toda?, no afecta el mercado interno ni hace bajar ni subir la inflación.<br>  Creo que si fuera presidente ya me hubiese dado cuenta que el resto de la gente se dio cuenta de como son las cosas, no se puede seguir mintiendo tan descaradamente.<br>  Y por supuesto que no tendría a mis matones personales para reprimir a los manifestantes, eso a mi, como cuidadana argentina me provoca verguenza ajena, siendo presidente no lo permitiría, me alejaría lo mas que pueda de esa gente que el gobiero invento y avalo llamados piqueteros.<br>  Y sería coherente. cosa que no veo para nada en ella, enojandose tanto y amenzando con la carcel a los que cortan las rutas y yo, que trabajo en el microcentro hace fácil cinco a?os que debo enfrentar a diario algún corte de avenidas cruciales como Alem, Corrientes o Libertador por cualquier reclamo y nadie hace nada. CFK: o para todos, o para ninguno. Así no te creo nada de nada. Me callaría mas, averiguaría mas, bajaría la soberbía, no estrenaría cada día un traje diferente de no se cuantos miles de pesos, me mostraría como una luchadora mas, codo a codo con al gente y no me creería la reina de Inglaterra ni por un segundo. Eso haría si hipoteticamente fuera presidente, pero jamas lo sería...|`|D2rmtqU2aa	Lo consultaría a Chávez. Quizás dando petrocasitas  a los campesinos todo se resuelva.

Las propias medidas de Raul Castro despues de casi 50 a?os de inrevolucion hablan por si solas de la miseria cubana que rebasa los limites de lo material y se superpone sobre lo subjetivo tambien, dejando muy peque?os los efectos del bloqueo norteamericano ante tanta obstrucion gubernamental.<br>  Los cubanos en la isla estamos condenados a un plato de comida "miserable" al dia, durante unos 10 dias porque la canasta basica del estado no da para mas. <br>  Diria que tal vez un 80 por ciento de los cubanos viven de los envios de sus familiares en UE y otras partes del mundo. De ahi sale el aceite, los jabones y los frijoles que se compran para poder pasar el resto de los casi 20 dias del mes. <br>  Esos grandes triunfos de las industrias de la biotecnologia, turismo y otros evacuan sus frutos al estado para su control centralizado y planes de ejecucion de grandes obras de Arquitecturas de las cuales no participa ni obtiene beneficios el pueblo.<br>  Las limitaciones y prohiviciones en Cuba han sido unicas en este mundo, nada tiene comparacion. Poco a poco el mundo se ira dando cuenta del sufrimiento de nuestros coterraneos. Ni me voy a referir al problema de la vivienda porque ese no es el peor, el peor es el Hambre, la falta de libertades y la represion psicologica a que estan sometidos los cubanos hasta el el extranjero.<br>  ?Quien dijo que la mayoria esta con el gobierno?- La mayoria ni la minoria tienen como expresar sus opiniones y menos la via para difundirlas. Asi de esa forma cualquier gobierno podria decir que el pueblo esta de su parte. La dictadura ya no se sabe mentir, las noticias, los sucesos se les escapan por internet a pesar de las limitaciones. El comandante Ramiro Valdes subestimo el poder de los medios de comunicacion, se estan ahogando y no podran cortar los cables ni elaborar tecnologias superiores a las mundiales.
