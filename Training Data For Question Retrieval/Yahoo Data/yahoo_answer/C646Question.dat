20090223130903AAFhi5W	Family & Relationships;Family	Where can my sick mother live?	My mother is being tested for bladder and bowel cancer next week.  Although we don't have the results yet, she's had a CT scan, blood and urine tests done, and basically the only thing left to test for is cancer.  She's passing out, only eating a little each day (maybe one small meal), in terrible pain, and feeling sick all the time.  I can accept she has cancer, and although I'll be devastated, I know I'll eventually accept her death.  What worries me more is where she and my teenage brother will live now.  Her doctor has told her she needs to give up work urgently.  She is trying to work at the moment, but she qualifies for the sickness benefit, which is about $200 a week.  Her mortgage is $880 a fortnight.  I have a husband and three kids, and we live in a two bedroom house with a sleepout, so there is no room here.  My other siblings live overseas, and aren't able to help either.  We live in NZ, so any American aid programmes don't apply here.  I've asked my husband if he'll consider selling our house and buying a bigger one so she and my brother could live with us, but although he likes my mother, he doesn't want her living with us.  There isn't enough room in her house for us to move in with her, and if she sold her house, she wouldn't have enough to own another home, in fact, probably not even enough for a deposit.  The sickness benefit wouldn't even cover rent for a one bedroom house here.  What do I do?  I desperately want to take care of her, but my husband doesn't even want to consider her moving in with us.  Anyone else been in this situation or have any suggestions?
20090223131014AAIGqZF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can a person tell so many dirty jokes that it makes them look unclassy?	I personally think someone who constantly makes everything into something perverted has no class. Is this an accurate assessment of those who can't just tell a joke or make a comment without bringing something sexual into the equation?   Yes, plenty of "classy" and intelligent people make dirty jokes - but what about those who do it CONSTANTLY?  Maybe they are just deprived???

20090223132710AAe6mDf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I Be His Friend?	There's A Guy In My High School Who I 9th Grade and We Have Had Classes Together But He Would Be So Mean To Me. Now That We Are Seniors, He Started Talking To Me and Then He Found Out That I Want To Be An Actor When I Grow Up and He Sent Me A Message Online Telling Me That He Could Help Me. He Said He Would Give Me Haircut To Help Me Look Good and Help Me Wor Out. He Already Gave Me The Haircut and I Love It and Today, We Were Supposed To Work Out After School and I Think It's Great That He's Trying To Help Me and That I Guess He Wanted To Be My Friend, But Today I Talked To Him and Found Out That He Had Forgotten and We Won't Be Able To Do It, But Then I Asked Him If We Could Start Tomorrow, But He Made Me Very Upset. Today, He and His Friend Were Talking About Marijuana and How They Smoke It, But then His Friend Asked Me "Victor, Do You Smoke Marijuana?" and They Both Laughed and Then He (Not His Friend), Told Me "Victor, You Need To Have More Fun, You Are Going To Regret It! You'll Remember It! You'll Remember Me, Because Someday You Will Drink and You Are Going To Regret Not Doing It In High School". I Have Tried To Tell Him To Respect Me and My Thoughts. I Don't Drink Or Smoke Marijuana, But He Keeps Telling Me That I'm Not Social, and That People Don't Like Me Because Of That Fact. He Also Said "Have You Ever Noticed That People Talk To You and Once They Get To Know You, They Back Away From You?" I Said "No", But I Actually Have Felt That People Have Done That To Me and That's When I Stop Talking To Them and Maybe He Was Telling Me That That's What He's Doing, Because Everytime I Talk To Him, He Always Ends Up Leaving Me! He Gets Up and Leaves The Table, and I Feel Like Crap Right Now, Because I Always Wanted To Be His Friend, and Now I Don't Feel Like I Should Even Try, He Has A Very Wild Life and I Don't Think That He Should Tell Me What I Should Do With Mine. Can You Guys Help Me? Give Me Some Tips, Should I Stop Talking To Him? Tomorrow, I'm Supposed To Meet Him In the Weight Room After School To Work Out, But I Don't Think I Should Do It, Should I?   Please Be Nice About Your Answers. Thank You.

20090223133921AA4VWtb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Are these signs of physical abuse from your boyfriend?	i want to know if these are signs of physical abuse.. as in if he is most likely going to be abusive in the future      well i knew this guy when we were both teenagers and im worried he will be abusive in his future relationships...      i use to go out with a guy and these are the things he did that werent every nice, and are they possible signs of being physical abusive later on? :   Hes mean to me 85% of the time because he felt like he was the inferior one, he use to say things like ''what are you, a dumbass?'' after me trying to be nice to him and sort things out.. and things like '' well if you dont like then why dont you just suck my d*ck'' and he use to be very cocky...he would get mad if he heard that i had flirted with a guy when its not true because the guy flirted with me, and so he would hreaten me by saying this like '' i swear you do that one more time ill make you cry'' and im just like '' no you wont!'' ( cmon we were 16 years old) and HE is the one that always flirts with girls because he was a player...he grew up in a home were his dad use to beat up his mom.. but he told me he would never ever hit a girl because of that... but i heard that he heldp a knife to his ex gf but i cant fuly confirm it because he never told me himself it was a close friend of his.. but i thought it was ironic because i though that i was the only one that knew he was very vulgar...he also always wants sex, if that has anything to do with it? even when were in an argument!  he also ALWAYS found something to fight about with me when i never thought i did anything wrong... could it be possible he will abuse his later gf's?
20090223134417AALWB7Z	Family & Relationships;Family	Diplomatic way to refuse a family visit?	My Mother wants to come to visit my family. She was just here at Christmas, and that visit did not go to well.      She is rude,impolite and insensitive. She never says thank you  for trips or meals ( I know she is my mom and does not NEED to but it is still polite) and curses often, something we do not do in my family.       She belittled where we live ( I just moved out of the country) and the people in it. She was rude when we asked if she wanted to tour the capitol and see the sites in the city ( we live in the capitol city) saying that she really didn't care to see anything in this country.       She said intentionally mean things to my daughter to hurt her and prompted her to not listen to us ( her father and I ) then seemed to take joy in the fact that we needed to reprimand my daughters actions ( she is 6 btw and impressionable) When my daughter showed where she goes to school her reaction was flippant and she insulted the school when she KNOWS school is the most important thing to my daughter.      She showed no respect for our house rules like removing shoes before entering the house ( we have carpet and it was the dead of winter with snow and salt all over the place) . Resented the fact that my daughter does not get free run of everything and has to ask if she can use the computer before hand and has a strictly enforced bed time.      She brought up topics of conversation that were meant to bait me into arguments, but when that failed just went for talking about things to my husband about my past ( concerning my ex husband )      Point is she is not welcome to stay in our home again but we know that  she is my mother and the grandmother of my daughter. It is not really right of me to keep her from seeing her.      How do I be diplomatic is telling her that she is not really wanted here and if she decided to come up anyway she would have to stay at a hotel? And that we are not interested in entertaining her since the last time she showed no interest in what we wanted to show her.      I do not want to lie, but I don't want to be too rude about it if it can be avoided. Is there anything I can do that will let the point be known but not burn bridges too?      Thank you in advance   Betty

20090223133226AA1lRqJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I break up with him? He doesn't seem to care that his ex contacting him is hurtful to our relationship?	We knew eachother for about 2 years and we got involved about a few months after his ex left him. During our first year, he was of course still not over his ex and I stayed like a fool and gave him time because I took responsibility for staying in the relationship knowing that it was too soon to get involved. Of course I got burned a few times after and I guess I stayed out of convenience at that point. To make a long story short, I've had to ask him to do things to make her stop texting him but I don't feel like he's done enough. He feels like time will make her go away, but it's been a year now since she hasn't stopped. And he keeps telling me that what I should understand is that he's completely over her and that I'm the only one in his heart. But him not doing anything about it is what causes my insecurity because I feel he doesn't care enough about me and of course it tells me that there could still be feelings there for her. I feel like a fool for staying in this and don't understand why he doesn't do everything in his power to make her stop, knowing that by her contacting him it's a constant reminder of the pain he put me through. I don't feel like I could move on in something like this; but I also don't want to regret leaving if I do. He's a great man, but we just don't see eye to eye in this situation; he feels like I shouldn't be stressing her contacting him if he doesn't answer at all. But enough is enough. If he truly felt like it was a nuisance, he'd do everything in his power to get rid of her. The fact that he hasn't taken the initiative to do anything is what hurts me. It was because of my bitching that he had his lawyer send her a cease and desist letter. She didn't respect that and keeps texting him and he doesn't want to follow up with it. I keep telling him that it bothers me that he allows her to keep texting him when I'm doing everything to give this my all. I had to block her number myself with our phone carrier. I'm confused. Does anyone have any insight?
20090223133906AAeM1Hy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me with this personal question. Is it normal to be worried when my boyfriend goes out?	We have been together almost 4 years. I am 23 he is 29 and he has never none anything to make me believe that he is cheating on me. He only goes out about once a month. It just recently worried me because he always calls on his way home and I woke up at 5am and there was no call. I called him twice and then I started freaking out that something bad happend so I called again and left a rude message saying to please call me back. He finally called back all rude asking me what was I doing awake and saying that if I was really worried about his safety that I would not have been upset. Is this normal? How can I get over worrying about him when he goes out?

20090223142612AAAgMNx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Combination of Dried & Fresh Flowers?	My dad's cousin has offered to create my floral arrangements for me as a wedding gift (provided I supply the cost of the materials, which I don't mind). She is completely happy with me choosing whatever I'd like and making it for me.      My mother has made it clear that she expects me and the bridal party to be sporting fresh florals the day of. I've given up talking to her about it because she just yells, gets angry, and won't listen (she's also paying for the wedding along with Drew's parents).      But because my cousin would only have an hour and a half to set up for the wedding due to venue rules, and because she's not actually a florist (just a hobby of hers), I'm afraid that asking her to do bouquets and centerpieces would tax her time, her energy, and her fridge.      I recently bought one foot tall apothecary jars for my center pieces and I'm quite happy with them. My idea is to go ahead and ask for a simple bouquet arrangements for the day of. But for centerpieces, fill the apothecary jars with dried white flowers and some dried greenery. It's cheaper than fresh flowers (I can get 30 large white orchids for $10, not bad since I love orchids) and we can create the arrangements ahead of time and deliver them two weeks before the wedding along with the programs, cake cutters, etc. The venue has already said they accept everything we want to give them early, in fact they prefer it in case of time crunches.      Would it look wrong having dried arrangements in apothecary jars but fresh bouquets? The fresh flowers would be similar to the dried flowers (white roses/hydrangea/orchids).      Some of the flowers I was planning on ordering for the jars:    http://www.save-on-crafts.com/whiteorchi...

20090223144051AAtKLgC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I break up with him?	I'm 15, and I've been going out with a guy for a year. He's 18. I tried breaking up with him, but he made me feel so bad that I didn't. I told him I needed a break, but he thinks we're sorted and keeps phoning me and sending me texts. I do still love him, but I really don't want to be with him. He's possessive and whenever I'm with my friends he gets annoyed, though when he's with his friends I don't mind. He tells me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, but I'm only 15, and I need to be having more than 1 relationship. He wants a serious full on relationship, whereas I really don't. I know it's been a year, but still. Also he's very heavy within the relationship, but can't see that hes doing anything wrong. I NEED to break up with him for myself, but I hate hurting people, and he doesn't exactly have many people there for him. I'm scared he'd do something if I broke up with him. Please help?

20090223144812AAhBb3T	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother thinks I'm selfish but I'm the one thats hurting...did I miss something?	So my mom and her husband arent too keen on my current bf.   We've had our problems but have decided to work them out. Everything is much better than before in all aspects.    However my mom is on a kick of "people never change" and refuses to accept my bf and i's relationship.    Recently my sister got pregnant to her bf who is jobless and smokes pot. My mother wasnt keen on him either however now by sister and her bf are A+ material.    She refuses to let my bf and I come to dinner because she still has a stigma against him for what happened between us.   I dont understand why she wont give us a chance to prove that things are better.   I know mother's supposed to know best but are they not supposed to support as well?    She makes it sound like I am pushing her away by refusing to come if the bf cant. Everyone else brings their significant others to dinner and such even my sisters loser of a bf. Now I'm stuck hurt and crying over it all and the only thing she can say is i'm selfish.   Seriously am I just not seeing something?

My sister is having a baby, first of all she just assumed that i would throw her shower (my mom could have been part of the assumption), then she keeps bombarding me with her ideas for a shower.  i kindly told her that she is the guest of honor and needs to just relax and let me do the work.  Now she is telling me she wants a co-ed shower with 40+ guests.  She has also hinted to venues and so on.  As the host i know it is my responsibiliy to pay for this event.  Would it be wrong of me to tell her to step back and let me do my job? I also want to throw here a woman only shower because i think it would be a more memerable experiance and cut the guest list in half, or do i have to do co-ed because that is what she is expecting?

Please tell me your story! Encouragement is good....and I love other people's happy ending story. It's been two weeks for me. We're "just friends" who "want to be more in the future."

We are starting to do things together again...and there's still that "spark" when we look into each other's eyes...even an occasional wink.

My husband's NEVER fed her, NEVER changed her, NEVER played with her, and he's only held her like 4 times, just because I was busy or something...He's at the gym a lot (10 hours a day 6 days a week) because he's a boxer, he doesn't have a job(doesn't have to work, my father is very wealthy and he pays our bills), picks fights with my friend's BF's....and he hangs out with his friends a lot more than he should.. It makes me feel kind of bad that he doesn't have much interest in his daughter...Are all men like this? I really don't want my daughter to have a bad relationship with her father growing up.. Does anyone know how I could get my husband to care about his daughter? I think he's pretty immature for an 18 year old(I'm 24)...I don't know if I should kick him out or try to work things out...

20090223154544AAHiQ7K	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i avoid spazing at my mom?	sorry this is gonna be long   ok before i start plz no one say at least u have a mom or something    like that I'm sorry if u don't have one and i feel for u but thats not gonna make mine or your situation any better.   so my mom likes to take control of the family she will scream and shout until things are her way (almost like a grownup child) she would try to force me to do things just for the purpose of making her look good. like forcing me to go to church and trying to make me get involved with the activites that go on in church. (don't make me wrong it took me awhile but i like church its just some days I'm not feeling up to it and id like a choice) now as i started getting older i started fighting back but after awhile u get tired of fighting (like my father, if anything the only person who never backed down was my sister and she already moved out so theres no one to fight) if anything i always feel i should never raise my voice to my parents or adults so i just put up with my mothers insults and living by her rules. But i've got to say she is pushing me and anything she does to me won't really make me regret cutting losse on her not even her sending me away. anyway what r ur thoughts and advice plz don't say ACS I'm just not that type of guy   o and for the record to anyone thinking I'm from a broken and messed up family ur way off its the opposite which is probably my mom is so spoiled thinking everything should be her way

20090223153005AAc4WSC	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I be worried about my friend?	She rarely [like maybe once every two months] eats lunch at school, and when she does, she goes on about how fat she feels for eating when she hardly touched her food. She eats other things in front of us, like when one of us brings Goldfish or something she snacks, but not very much. Sometimes she'll start goofing off...like she'll throw the Goldfish at one of us and just start a random thing. I don't know if she eats at home because I haven't been to her house in a while. She's not scary skinny, just normal. She did lose some weight over the summer and has kept it off, though.      The only thing is her not eating at lunch kinda bothers me. I'm not sure if I should be worry. I don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to offend her [she'll get pissy about stuff and just start huge, ugly fights that take a few weeks to simmer down] since we haven't fought in a long time [which is awesome, lol]. So, should I be worried? Or let it be?

My church has a long list of the things that cannot be thrown or used for the bride and groom's exit from the church (no rice, sparklers, birdseed, flower petals).  I understand their reasons for this, but it doesn't really leave me with any options but bubbles!  If you've seen this done, how does it look?

20090223153547AAdpXD8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you automatically hug your loved one if they told you their dog had died?	My husband and I had a row last night and we havent spoken since.  I went with my dear dad today to put our beloved dog aged 17 to sleep.  I avoided telling my hubby partly as I didnt want to be disappointed when he didnt comfort me (I knew this).      At 11pm tonight I went into the lounge where he was lying on the floor and I sat down on the couch and told him.  I broke down and he still lay there just telling me that we had done the right thing etc.  I then told him as I walked back out the door that I could have done with a hug to comfort me.      He then followed me down the hall into the bedroom and got in the bed in order to hug me and I told him that if I had to ask for a hug then dont bother.  He has gone back to the lounge and wont bother to speak to me again now.      What do you think?

20090223152032AA9IGuM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Max child support to pay after divorce?	Hi, I live in a military comunity. my wife of over 5 years left with my best friend recently, he is very successful, I know I made mistakes in the past but that just destroyed me. we are about to finalize our divorce,       I do not mind paying child support and I am informed that its 25%  of my income... my question is... lets say that at this moment when we get divorce... I am making %2000 a month... cool... my child support its $500... but "what if"  a year from now I have a great business that takes off and I start making $7000 ... will she still get %25 out of the $7000?  meaning a monthly check of $1750 ???      I mean, I think thats a lot of $.... and what if then I start making $10,000 a month?        When is to much child support 'to much'?  is there a cap?   I dont want to give her less but no more than she needs... I think it should be fair.      Is there a 'cap' when you pay 'no more' than this ammount?  After she commited adultery with my friend.. I dont want to supply her with a 'full time job income'  ... I think it should be fair.... she is the one who left with my child.  I  am happy to provide what Im suppose to but not be abused by the system.      I appreciate your answers.      Thanks !

20090223153340AAE7sJ3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I place my husband in a nursing home or not. I have been caring for him for 10 yrs.?	We have been married 30 years. 10 years ago he had a brain aneurysm at the age of 47. Docs say he should have died as they had never seen anyone live with this type of aneurysm.  They had to inquire around the world to figure out how to operate so he didn't just lay there and bleed out in his head.  They received some ideas and they operated and he recovered quite well to everyone's surprise.  No short term memory though. 5 years ago he had meningitis & a staph infection in his brain.  This set him back quite a bit.  Over the last 5 years he has deteriorated in that I am back to helping him with personal care and everything else in his life. I am completely responsible for everything in our lives. We had to file bankruptcy after the aneurysm and we lost our home and everything else.  I have worked hard these 10 years to get our credit back and to buy another home for us. My mortgage is cheaper than our rent was. He walks unsteadily with a hemi walker but often has to use his wheelchair.  He was diagnosed a year ago with a melanoma in his eye and the optic nerves in his other eye are deteriorating so he does not see detail anymore. In the last 5 years my health has suffered greatly.  I believe it is the stress of taking care of him. He has short term memory loss but he is still "with it".  There is little decrease in brain function so its not like he is out of it and wouldn't know.  I have talked to him about it many times but he gets all teary so I stop.  5 minutes later he doesn't remember talking about it.  I get no help from our children or his family or mine.  They all say just ask but when I do there is always a reason why they cannot help.  I am not interested in finding a new man or anything like that.  I just want to get healthy again and not have my life totally consumed with his care.  I have looked into help at home but it would cost me $800.00 a month and we cannot afford it. he receives social security disability as do I.  I also receive a pension from my past employment but he was self employed all his working career so he has no pension. Anyone have any ideas that can help me?  I pray on this all the time but I never seem to come up with an answer that I am positive about. HELP!

In my previous relationship i spent alot of time on my own. & it has been  4 months since that 8 month relationship and i got used to being super independent but this new guy treats me so well....but i don't like it.... what the hell is wrong with me

20090223160206AAgfbEf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How Can I Get Through To Him?? HELP!!!?	My BF & I have been having some up & downs lately.I'm pregnant and I can't get my emotions in check. I wrote him the note below to let him know how I'm feeling. He's a Spanish man & everything is about respect.I want him to know I love him but I don't want to come across needy. I just want him to realize I'm going through a lot and need his support.      What would you think after reading this? I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND DESPERATE because I'm not.. But I need to be able to tell him my fears.       I'm so sorry. I can't get my emotions in check. You didn't do anything last night and I completely blew up. It's been happening a lot lately. At work, with my friends, and now with you. The smallest thing can make me cry or get really angry. I spoke with my doctor about it again today and he said my emotions are normal. Hopefully in a few weeks my body will have adjusted to all the extra hormones and I will level out.       Lately, I've been feeling really lonely. That's why I've been a little clingy. It's just that I feel better when I'm around you (minus all the crying of course). I'm terrified. Some days I wonder if I made the right decision in keeping this baby. I have no clue if I will be a good mother. I'm starting to think down the road a few years and all the questions this baby is going to have for me. Even without all the hormones I cry everyday. I feel like I'm completely alone. The day I told you I was pregnant, I went to Planned Parenthood. I was going to have an abortion. Before you do the procedure they make you watch a video of an abortion. After seeing that, there was no way I could do it.        Last week when I saw the ultrasound.. It was like "wow" that's our baby. This little person is going to depend on me for the next 18 years. Realizing all that now I feel like the whole world is on my shoulders.Throw in the fact that I thought if I ever had a child it would be with someone who loved me as much as I loved them. That makes everything even more difficult. I know you care about me, but from what you've said you aren't in love with me. That's hard to accept because up until all of this you told me you were in love with me. Soon you're going to be hone      I'm really trying to not be so emotional. I don't even know what the point of this was. Most of friends & family are not speaking to me right now. They don't approve of having a baby without being married. Right now I don't have a whole lot of people to talk too.. I'm hoping you that you will understand.. Please do NOT get angry about this. I've tried to act as normal as possible around you, things are just getting so hard. Please just understand I'm going through a lot too and have patience with me. I really need your continued support. I appreciate you going crib shopping with me. It meant a lot. Thank you for coming back.

Hace 5 Meses yá, que nos separamos, luego de estar unidos por 3 a?os 3 meses, Anoche lloré como si fuera ayer lo sucedido, es que la amo de verdad, ya no me he vuelto a enamorar, solo recuerdo lo bonito de enamorarme recordando lo que vivi con ella, no he podido dejar de pensar en esa persona un solo instante, y es más doloroso el saber que esa persona no siente por mi, la vi con alguien de la mano, y cada vez que la veo por ahi, el corazón se me acelera a mil y no sé que hacer,, Es como si derrepente toda mi vida cambiara.      Al tener tan presente su ausencia solo pienso si tuvimos algo, si todo eso fue un sue?o!, si de verdad asi de fácil me olvida, Decirme que no tiene que importarme lo que sienta o piense de mi y que debo olvidarla, es decirle a un ni?o que no quiera a su madre, casi no creo que sea verdad, ella NO ME QUIZO, y yo la sigo deceando a pesar de todo lo que sucedió//. me da verguenza seguir amandola pues yo traiciono mi valor personal.      Fué la voluntad de Dios, sigo solo!

Hace poco mi hermana lo vio en el msn y platicaron, el le pregunto q a donde iba a ir y que si lo invitaba si salia, q podia ser al cine o a algun antro.    No creo q a el le guste mi hermana y no entiendo por q le dijo q salieran ese dia, a como lo conozco no creo que tenhga malas intenciones o me quiera hacer da?o o hacer enojar ya q no le he hecho nada, pero ahi estan los hechos y todo indica a q piense mal, ya que ir a un antro o al cine me suena mas a cita que a querer a hablar sobre mi por ejemplo. No se que pensar! No esta loco (o eso pienso) para hacer eso e invitarla a salir, o no se a q se refirio con eso. No se si fue adrede para molestarme. Que piensan? No lo creo tan descarado, o sea creo que tiene cabeza!   Fue muy insistente en salir, pero no entendo si como cita o que! Aclaro: no creo q le guste suena muy ridiculo y NO estoy celosa y NO desconfio como me lo han dicho, solo q no se q paso x su cabeza!!

It's now 6:45 and still no call and shes not here. She does this all the time and it bums me out. I love spending time with her but i rarely see her because she always does this then calls me THREE DAYS later and apologizes. I don't know why i always get my hopes up when i know shes going to do this.. I havent seen her in over a month and shes done this 4 times with-in that month. =( What should i do? I am completely upset and in tears. I cancel my plans to hangout with my friends to see her and she never shows up.. It's been like this for 3 years now... Im 16 btw. I really am starting to think she hates me. She doesn't have a job either so it's not like shes busy (her boyfriend that cant stand me gives her money).

La causa aun no la se, durante 10 a?os di lo mejor de mi en una empresa todo bien llegue a ser el 2do de la misma, ganaba bien. Pero la contraparte mis relaciones eran un desastre, amigos nunca los he tenido, mis planes y sue?os jamás han sido concretados y ahora tengo que empezar desde cero, pues no tengo estudios. Y otras empresas no me aceptan. Ahora tuve una relacion con una ni?a guapa muy bonita pero termino enga?andome y casandose con el otro.

20090223155439AAlzK1g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my boyfriend to stop playing so hard to get?	We have been together for two months and today I realized why I have been feeling so insecure in this relationship, and it's that he always plays hard to get with me. For a while I thought that he was losing interest or just wasn't that into me anymore. But today in class I was talking to my friend who was right next to him, and then ran to go to the bathroom real quick. When I came back my friend told me that he got really upset that I didn't say hi to him, but I would have if he was looking in my direction! I was trying to make eye contact with him but he was avoiding it. But she said that he said he didn't mean to do it, and that he was a little hurt by it. I was shocked that he felt that way, I thought he wouldn't really give a damn one way or another.       When I finally get him to warm up, he is the sweetest guy and I feel like I could really fall in love with him. But sometimes he just kinda gives me the cold shoulder. Is this normal of a guy? How do I get him to stop it and be the sweet guy he is ALL the time?      We are both 18, by the way...

20090223155841AAplWML	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you think? Any suggestions?	I'm 19 years old male going to a community college, 2 days ago had the first date in my life with a 20 years old woman. It was my first experience with a girl. I've realized that girls from my college have never talked to me, and have had always choose another guy who sat next to me to make a conversation, and etc.. The same can be said in the place where I volunteer. When I'm with my friends, girls never talk/look to me; they talk for a little, perhaps looked at me and go for someone else whoever it can be like I'm a constant turn off. The only girls/women I've realized talk to me and find me attractive are intelligent and adult+. Why can't random and normal girl/woman talk to me? What I can do wrong? I don't consider myself as a bad guy. Also, many adult women always say that I look very good, and that I'm a rare. It's weird. What do you think? Any suggestions please? Thank you.

We were talking about marriage and it was heading in a different direction. He had also thought of how he was going to propose and what not. He broke up with me over the phone and was not ready to meet me. When he broke up with me he said to give him time to settle down and that he would call me. He called me after 6 months and we met last week. He said he did not know how to face me and that he knows what he did was wrong. He did not want to meet because he felt I would convince him to continue the relationship. He said we could be friends but it would lead to no where. When I leaving he looked into my eyes and said you are the best thing that ever happened to me, when he said that he looked straight into my eyes. I know he still loves me and cares about me by the way he was talking. I asked him how about we talk and see what it leads to, he completely denied and said I don't want to get married or be in a relationship. I  still love him and what do anything to get him back I do not know what to do? Is there a possibility he might ever come back? Do you know how I should handle him. Please help!!

I don't know because I don't know her at all. I always look at her when she walks past (dont see her very often cause I'm in none of her classes.. i'm in the year above.) One day we were walking towards eachother at seperate ends of the long hallway, no one else was there, and I was looking at her and she looked up and made eye contact with me for about 4 seconds, and I looked away because I had to turn left. She was still staring though!   What do you think this means????   She's interested? Or what? Im really not bigheaded but I am popular and have had my fair share of girlfriends. I don't know how to go about this one though... I hardly ever see her... only once or twice a week round school.   Do you think she's interested... the staring?? What could it mean? Past experiences would be helpful! Thanks.

20090223160121AA9TRN7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My bf wants to become Hugh Hefner....?	My bf admitted that he wants to become Hugh Hefner and would like to make me his “HOLLY” (someday)…? OMG, I was dumbfounded, I really didn’t know what to say or how to feel, although I laughed in disbelief. But he’s really serious about it and kind of given me an ultimatum to either accept it now or leave. He said he loves me very much; he didn’t want to hurt me by cheating so it’s better that I know this now and prepare myself of what’s to come because he knows himself very well and that he’ll never change.       I mean, I admire his honesty but how can someone love a person so much and still want to see other people? I was crushed. I love him very much but now I’m really lost. Didn’t see this one coming; everything seemed great between us, or so I thought.          Please advice :(
20090223160322AAXG9uI	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my bestfriends has a fighting problem, how do I shut her up and make her realize she's being an idiot?	One of my friends is really headstrong and thinks she can take anyone on. We used to look past it and now she's b**ching at everyone cause she thinks all her friends are trying to get to her boyfriend. (which is kinda paranoid if you ask me cause he isn't even worth looking at) She's STILL got a grudge and is STILL making threats to a girl who backed off weeks ago. Please help before she takes it too far. She's losing friends fast.

20090223160508AAcpGur	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice? Anyone? I'm just mostly venting.....?	first off, I'm 16. and well, me and my girlfriend of 16 months split up last month. And ever since then i've been happier than ever. i've been having so much fun because i've started my new job. i've met another girl (she works with me plus my mom has known her forever). she's also 16 (ironic thing is our birthday is one the same day) and we've just started hanging out at school. me and this girl get along GREAT and we flirt constantly. we obviously both like eachother. But just the other day my ex texts me and says she misses me and cant stop thinking about me and she wishes she never would have broken up with me. and then today she just comes up to me and gives me a hug and walks away. it kinda confuses me because she treated me like total crap even though i'd give her everything she wanted. but now she sees how i'm being so optimistic and successful with myself. i know i couldn't ever take my ex back. but this girl i just met is incredibly nice and she's a really good church girl. is it wrong of me to be able to move on so quickly?      Thanks to all who have read my nonsense :)

20090223160613AAM2jQN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Okay so a few days ago i went to a basketball game and i saw this girl that i've known for a long time but i've never really talked to her. She came up to me and said hi and we talked for a while. I tried to start conversations and she laughed alot some of it wasn't even very funny and then when she was laughing she put her hand on my shoulder for a few seconds. But the thing is whenever I see her at the basketball games she is always with this other guy who i think she likes but im not 100% sure. Every day at school we walk by each other and i never know what to say but we always say hi to each other and sometimes she smiles at me but doesn't say anything. Do you think she likes me?

Aprovechamos todo lo posible en el instituto para estar juntos pero vamos a clases distintas y sólo nos podemos ver en el recreo y a la hora de salir. El problema se complica cuando su mejor amigo hace una trastada y él lo defiende... Bueno, total, que ahora me lo castigan a la hora del recreo y al salir y además a partir de la semana que viene me lo expulsan del insti. Además, sus padres son muy duros y no le dejan salir, no le dejan conectarse al Messenger, le confiscan el móvil y si llamo a su casa y pregunto por él me cuelgan porque son evangelistas y no quieren que tenga una novia católica...   Lo quiero muchísimo y no puedo seguir así... Tengo la sensación de que si las cosas siguen así tendremos que dejarlo estar y no quiero porque sin él me moriría.   ?Qué hago??Alguien me podría ayudar?

20070607044756AATigPn	Family & Relationships;Friends	ES IMPORTANTE ! Me permiten un consejo?	LEER CON MUCHA ATENCION MUY BIEN HECHO Y DIFICIL DE AGARRAR Tenes que estar preparado para protegerte de este nuevo tipo de fraude con las tarjetas de crédito, vía telefónica. Los ladrones están cada día más creativos! Recibís una llamada y la persona dice: "Estamos llamando del Departamento de Seguridad de VISA por ejemplo). Me llamo Fulano y mi número de identificación funcional es 12460. Ud. compró (cualquier cosa bien rara como un dispositivo Anti-Telemarketing) con un valor de US$497,99 de una compa?ía basada en Arizona, USA?" Lógicamente contestás que no, a lo que >sigue: "Probablemente su tarjeta fue clonada y estamos llamando para verificar. Si lo confirmamos estaremos emitindo un crédito a su favor. Este tipo de transa?ción está sucediendo con gastos que varían US$297 a US$ 499, justamente por debajo de US$ 500 que es cuando acciona la mayoría de las alertas. Antes de procesar el crédito, nos gustaría de confirmar algunos datos: Su dirección es tal?" (Esto puede ser sacado facilmente de las guías telef?nicas via Internet). Al decir que si el tipo continúa:  "Cualquier pregunta que Ud tenga para hacer, deberá llamar al número 0800 que se encuentra en la parte trasera de su tarjeta y pedir por el Departamento de Seguridad. Por favor, tome nota del seguiente número de protocolo: El estafador le da, entonces, un número de 6 dígitos y pide: - "Podría leermelo para confirmar?" Aqui viene la parte más importante del fraude. El dice: "Disculpe, pero tenemos que verificar que o(a) Sr.(a.) está en poseción de la tarjeta. Por favor tome su tarjeta y leame su número" Hecho esto, continúa: ''Correcto. Ahora de vuelta su tarjeta y leame los 3 últimos números(o 4 dependiendo de la tarjeta)". Estos son los 'Números de Seguridad' (Pin Number) que usas para hacer compras via Internet, para probar que tenés la tarjeta! En AmEx están en el frente, medio escondidos en el cuerpo de la tarjeta). Después que le das los número referidos el dice: Correcto! Entienda que era necesario verificar que la tarjeta no estaba extraviada, ni robada y que Ud la tenía en su poder. Tiene alguna duda?" Después que le decis que no, el ladrón agradece y finaliza. Probablemente, en menos de 10 minutos, una compra será hecha con su tarjeta, y muchas más si es que no te das cuenta del fraude hasta la llegada del resumen. Como protegerse de esta acción criminal? Es casi inútil hazer denuncias policiales. Hasta enUSA es difícil o rastreo de estos llamados. En caso de recibir este tipo de comunicación podes decirle al bandido que corte que vos vas a llamar al 0800 Hay que estar alerta y difundir a todos la existencia de esta estafa. CUIDENSE!!

20070707192056AAjsOa8	Family & Relationships;Friends	Un hombre tan tímido puede ser que este enamorado de su amiga en esta situación??	Soy mujer y estoy muy enamorada de un gran amigo que es el hermano de una de mis mejores amigas. Ella es muy celosa de la familia y mas del hermano, yo soy casi una mas en la casa me quieren los padres como a una hija.   Con el hermano nos llevamos muy bien y somos amigos y confidentes, los dos somos tal y cual somos , sin caretas y eso es lo que me enamoró totalmente que soy yo cuando estoy con él. Es buenismo los dos sabemos que estamos el uno para el otro.   El es un pibe muy tímido cuando estamos en familia casi ni nos hablamos, pero despues nos encerramos en el cuarto y nos quedamos paveando en internet o charlando, solo somos amigos. Tambien a veces salimos en grupo y de vez en cuando los dos solos y la pasamos muy bien sin que la hermana sepa obviamente.   Hay muchas miradas intensas y poco contacto fisico sobre todo por la timidez de ambos. Yo a veces lo agarro le toco la mano el cuello y el lo permite.       Que creen???

20070706042441AAvGW3f	Family & Relationships;Family	?Qué puedo hacer con mi prima peque?a?	Hola.  Mi prima cumple este mes 16 a?os.  Nos hemos enterado que lleva saliendo seis meses con una hombre de 28 a?os.  Ella al principio negaba que estuviera con nadie.  Ayer ya me confesó que tiene 22 a?os aunque sé que tiene más por mi hermana.  También me dijo que es marroquí y que ya ha mantenido relaciones sexuales con él.  Su madre está muy preocupada y eso que cree que el novio tiene 19 a?os.       El lunes he quedado con ella y él para conocerle.  No sé que hacer porque aunque físicamente mi prima no aparenta 15 a?os sigue siendo una ni?a.  Me da miedo el pensar que clase de hombre estaría con una ni?a menor.      No sé que decirle, si amenazarlo con que le pueden denunciar, no sé si contárselo a mi tía o si directamente cortarle la cabeza al tío (esto es broma)...   ésta no es la primera vez que mi prima se enrolla con un tío mayor..ese creo que es el gran problema que tenemos..?Por qué se enamora de hombres mayores?  No sé si tendrá relación la muerte hace 3 a?os de su padre.
