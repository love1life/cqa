We would catch her laughing, and talking just carrying on. Lately here in the last couple months she says whatever this is is scarying her. We have watched her go down the hallway and come back really scared saying there was a monster back there. I would say yes kids do make things up but she is very in detail to what this monster looks like. She tells me he is tall, and black she said he was a little boy now a big guy. She told me he tells her to not love Mommy. Can anyone tell me if they experienced stuff like this with  their kids? And what was teh outcome. Could there really be something in the house. We do have a paster coming tuesday to bless the house. Any help would be great!

What mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) should be combined with 534g  of water to make a solution with an osmotic pressure of 8.05atm  at 315K ? (Assume the density of the solution to be equal to the density of the solvent.)      I used P = iMRT where P = 8.05atm, i = 1, M = unknown, R = 0.08206Latm/(Kmol), T = 315K.      I solved for M to get 0.311mol/L   I set 0.311mol/L = x/0.534L to get x = 0.166mol. I then multiplied this by the molar mass of sucrose, (342.256g/mol) to get 56.8g. However this is not the correct answer and the correct answer is closer to 70g from what I've heard. Anyone know why?

Does the answer have something to do with the plasma membrane being fluid, and being able to rebuild itself???

20090220192904AA7UPsH	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	One monkey w/ typewriter on each star in the universe - no chance of writing Hamlet?	Assuming there are about 10^26 stars in the universe (on the higher side of most guesses), and there is one monkey on each star with a typerwriter.  There is only a 5% chance that one of the monkeys would type a specific string of 20 letters in the correct order.  For example, there is only a 5% chance that one of the monkeys would type "hdkeijdfjhopwertyuio" exactly.  This is based on a (1/26)^20 chance that one monkey would type the string of letters correctly.  Multiply that by the number of monkeys typing (# stars = 10^26) and you get 0.05.      Did I calculate this right?  If you understand how many stars are in the universe this blows away that myth that a bunch of monkeys in a room with typewriters will eventually write a novel.      Comments?
20090220193334AABSQqm	Science & Mathematics;Physics	At what speed do forces transmit force?	Do forces like gravity and magnetism act at the speed of light?  For example, let's say I had a huge iron rod wrapped with a coil.  And then I instantly ran a current through the coil.  If I had a gigantic permanent magnet one light year away, would it take one year for the effect of the magnetic force from the coil/rod to have any influence on the magnet?      Same question for two objects moving by each other at speeds near the speed of light.  Are the forces on those objects directed in the direction of where the other object actually is at that instantaneous moment, or would the force be directed where the object was when the gravitation force was "sent out" (before the object had moved ahead at the speed of light to a new location).

Or if that doesn't work how else could i expand my medical business?      Another idea i have is setting up my own medical website and possibly it could grow from there?

20090220201520AAOdmEM	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Why would someone be accepted to an Ivy League medical school but rejected from others?	My sister was accepted to Harvard Medical School but was rejected from the non-Ivy league med schools she applied to, including Duke, Stanford, Mount Sinai, and Albert Einstien School of Medicine. Why would this be? Does each medical school you apply to know of all the other medical schools you apply to? She's happy at Harvard and is in her second year there now. But i was just wondering why would it be that she got rejected from the other "lesser" schools? I'm going to apply to medical school myself.

20090220203402AAEWi9N	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Can I (and/or how do I) drill a hole in an emerald?	I have a 28 carat Brazilian emerald which I would like to drill a hole in to hang inside a window. I do not want to apply an adhesive to detract from its visual appeal. I have asked the local jewelry store but they are unable to drill me a hole in it. I have only regular drill bits, not diamond tipped. I have a power drill to use, but not an expensive drill press. If I drill with the bit underwater, will it aid me? The value of the emerald is low because it is opaque, so I don't care that much if anything happens. Then again, I don't want it to get cracked if there is a high probability of this occurring. For your information, the hardness of this gem is roughly between 7 and 7.5 on the hardness scale.

The chemical 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione... better known as luminol, is used by forensic scientists in analyzing crime scenes for the presence of washed-away blood. Luminol is so sensitive that it can detect blood that has been diluted 10,000 times. A basic solution of luminol is often sprayed onto surfaces that are suspected of containing minute amounts of blood.      Luminol has a molecular weight of 177 g/mol.      The forensic technician at a crime scene has just prepared a luminol stock solution by adding 19.0 g of luminol into a total volume of 75.0 g of H2O .      What is the molarity of the stock solution of luminol?      Before investigating the scene, the technician must dilute the luminol solution to a concentration of 6.00×10^?2 M. The diluted solution is then placed in a spray bottle for application on the desired surfaces.      How many moles of luminol are present in 2.00 L of the diluted spray?

Two ice skaters have masses m1 and m2 and are initially stationary. Their skates are identical. They push against one another, as in Figure 7.11, and move in opposite directions with different speeds. While they are pushing against each other, any kinetic frictional forces acting on their skates can be ignored. However, once the skaters separate, kinetic frictional forces eventually bring them to a halt. As they glide to a halt, the magnitudes of their accelerations are equal, and skater 1 glides twice as far as skater 2. What is the ratio m1/m2 of their masses?
