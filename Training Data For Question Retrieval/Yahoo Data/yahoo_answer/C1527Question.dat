20090309132154AAbLxf9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do scientists say that it's "rare" to find fossils? Are they just covering up their tracks?	As in, are they just saying that so that no one would question why are the waaay to many fossils missing for the earth being millions of years old.       If the earth was younger than that, then sure, the fossils and fossil records make since. But since they say it's millions of years old, do they just say that it's rare to find a fossil to cover up their calculations?
20090309132222AA5YFDd	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Because the climates of China and SE Ontario in Canada are the same, I am suited for Canada, whereas whites?	(continued)      and blacks are not? On the temperature map, both SE Canada and China have the same climate: -10 to 0 degrees Celsius in the winter and 20 to 30 degrees Celsius in the summer. In fact, Toronto and Beijing have exactly the same temperatures. Whites are used to the warm Western Europe and Blacks are used to the hot sub-Saharan African, both of which are not adapted to the Canadian climate, unlike me, who is PERFECTLY adapted to the cold winter / hot summer climate of SE Canada. Thus, one can expect that all Canadians would eventually turn into Chinese-looking?
20090309132145AARgU0e	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pagans - Your Thoughts on the ARIS Report?	Last time ARIS released their findings in 2001, they gave a breakdown of their "Other Religions" category. (See this link:  http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_...       This time, we've been grouped into the "New Religious Movements" (NRM) category, which includes: "Scientology, New Age, Eckankar, Spiritualist, Unitarian-Universalist, Deist, Wiccan, Pagan, Druid, Indian Religion, Santeria, Rastafarian." (Link:  http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.o...       Now looking at that list, how much do you think we really have in common with some of those groups, especially Scientology?! So my first question is how do you feel about being lumped together like this?      My second question is how are we supposed to judge our growth if they don't give a further breakdown of the numbers? In the 2001 survey, Wiccans and Pagans each had over 100,000 adherents. This time around, we don't have that information to know how our numbers have grown, just that the total for this entire category has gone up by about a million people.

20090309141349AALiTc4	Society & Culture;Languages	When you listen to people speak another language, does it sound like they are talking really loudly?	I live in Mexico, and it seems like my in-laws are screaming. One person says something, then another person interrupts. But instead of waiting, the person who got interrupted just raises his/her voice. They do this until everybody is pretty much yelling at the top of their lungs.      But it's probably me, because Spanish is not my native language.      Has anybody else experienced this, anywhere else in the world?

20090309143407AAJnAfY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Muslims: How can certain tribesmen not commit sin?	It is a sin in Islam to have sex outside of marriage. There are many socities in this world where marriage is non- existant. Eventually they have to reproduce so wouldnt they be committing sin when doing so? Also, what is so special about marriage that you can only have sex when you are married? In the middle east marriage is not based off of love but rather economic purposes... so....why does Allah care if you **** outside of marriage? At least then it has more of a purpose relating to love.

20090309140104AAqLlwf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say shunning is anti christian when it is spoken in the bible?	But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you."         If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector      In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.   If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.

The cross that Jesus was actually crucified on looked like a capital T. This was the type of cross that the Romans used during that time.

Many many people were crucified by the Romans in this manner during that time.       Here is a site that explains the cross in further detail:     http://www.frugalsites.net/jesus/crucifi...

A lot of people are comparing the current economic crisis to recessions and depressions of former eras, but I wonder if they are considering one important factor; we now have far greater technology today than in those former times. I heard somewhere that in today’s America, something like 2% of the population can produce enough food and water to keep 100% of the population alive. So with that statistic in mind, the worst that can happen, that we’ll all starve, have nowhere to live and have no clean water, will never happen. But is this the worst that can happen? If people were given food and water and given a place to live and no money or valuables were exchanged, then this is socialism; is this what conservatives fear most? Would both religious and non-religious conservative prefer to see people starve and turn to a life of crime to survive rather than to have socialism take over from capitalism?

20090309151625AAOoaUs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Human sacrificing in the old testament to ancient Hebrew god Moloch?	The perspective here is that First. Some mistakenly believe human sacrifice is forbidden in the Old Testament. Certainly, some of the prophets railed against it. But in at least one book, LORD God accepts human sacrifice. And in another book, LORD God is appeased by human sacrifice.      In the following account from the Book of Judges, the Israelite warrior Jephthah is about to set off to make war on the Ammonites. In payment for victory, Jephthah promises LORD God he will sacrifice the first "whatsoever" that comes from his house to greet him upon his return. Unless Jephthah keeps oxen, sheep, goats, or chickens in his living room, he must expect the promised victim will be a human being. Notice that Jephthah does not promise to sacrifice "an ox" or "a goat," etc      These are the verses      And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,      # Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.       http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...       And lastly Jews who is this Moloch you worship       And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.       http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...       The bible surely is twisted,    If you dont believe me i have the bible site       http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...             34. And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.         35. And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.        http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...

I've often wondered about that. Most churches are so horribly anti-gay that the LGBT population tends to either be atheist or a self declared follower of a more free spirited religion (Buddhism, Neo-Paganism, etc.)      "No sex before marriage" is a philosophy often taught by the Christian religions mostly, but when the day comes where no one will bat an eyelash at a person for being gay or bisexual, and we also have full fledged marriage equality, could we see the churches try to lure the gay community back?      I doubt it personally, but I'm just curious if anyone disagrees.

Why is it that the bible makes no direct statement such as “THOU SHALT NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MOLEST THE CHILDREN”?

Let's see, we have; No working on the sabbath, don't take my name in vain, Don't think nasty things about your neighbor's wife, don't sleep with your fathers wife, but the kids seemed to have completely slip his mind.      Wouldn't u think the scandal involving the catholic church would have been an  isolated incident rather than a reoccurring pattern, if child protection had been a mainstay of church doctrine?      Would not this problem have been many times worse 2,000 years ago?      If not God, what about Jesus? Wouldn't he have made a point of protection for the kids?      Is there anything worse than another breaking story of a molested, beaten and murdered child?      Don't ALL good people have a special place in their heart for the most helpless among us?

20090227152357AAKEE4p	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan++>>> Isn't that Beautiful?	ASSALAAMU ALAIKUM        A Beautiful Hadith        Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) said: 'When a man dies and his relatives are busy in funeral, there stands an extremely handsome man by his head. When the dead body is shrouded, that man gets in between the shroud and the chest of the deceased.       When after the burial, the people return home, 2 angels, Munkar and Nakeer(names of two special Angels), come in the grave and try to separate this handsome man so that they may be able to interrogate the dead man in privacy about his faith. But the handsome man says, 'He is my companion, he is my friend. I will not  leave him alone in any case. If you are appointed for interrogation, do your job. I cannot leave him until I get him admitted into Paradise '.       Thereafter he turns to his dead companion and says, 'I am the Qura'an, which you used to read, sometimes in a loud voice and sometimes in a low voice. Do not worry. After the interrogation of Munkar and Naker, you will have no grief.'       When the interrogation is over, the handsome man arranges for him from Al-Mala'ul A'laa (the angels in Heaven) silk bedding filled with musk.       Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) said: 'On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other Intercessor will have a greater status than the Qura'an, neither a Prophet nor an angel.'       Please keep forwarding this 'Hadith' to all ....because       Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) said:       'Pass on knowledge from me even if it is only one verse'.       May Allah bestow this favour on all of us.       AMEEN

20090309164200AASB8pG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are people like Kurt Cameron the christian problem?	Here is a perfect example of why people, atheists in particular, have sch a problem with christians.   I was flipping through channels and saw Kurt Cameron telling people that Jesus did not have a problem until he open his mouth to speak about the evils of the world and that christians do not have a problem with the world until they open their mouth. So like Jesus they should speak out against all evils in the world. Then it got worse. He says that just like a waitress does not wait for an intro and just jumps in to ask what you want, you too should not wait and should jump in and tell people (even though they did not ask) what you have to offer them. He says that "ANY SAIN" person wants what Christians have, so it is there duty to "force" (paraphrased, he actually said be bold.) their beliefs on others. Now THAT is one of my major issues!  Of course he ended with letting Christians know how they could learn be Bold by buying his lesson on DVD.      Now is that what you think is the wise choice? Is this worth a bloody lip?

We have the same habbits; we both like to make strangers think we're insane just for the h*** of it, and we feel the same way about God and sex and alcohol and we have the same sort of attitude when it comes to sympathy. We both sometimes just talk to ourselves, even if we're together. We're both into horror movies and green is our favorite color. Our music taste is similar, and we both like the guitar and Family Guy and Death Note and other animes and cats and climbing trees and Calvin & Hobbes and Nintendo(<3 LoZ) and vampires and we're both clinically depressed. There's actually many creepy coincidences, but I won't type them all. And none of this is because we hang out. These are all habbits we've had for years, and we've only been dating a couple months.      And this last part is just WEIRD: On two separate occasions, he's gotten sick for exactly the same days I've been...lady-ing. If you know what I mean.

I have no driver's license, but I have a permit.  I have had two jobs, one when I was 17 and one last summer.  I have had several friends in the past, though not any close ones.  I think my social skills are above average for an aspie.  I am not good in relationships; I had sort of a semi-relationship with a girl in my junior year in high school (we were in love but we never really got anywhere).  My hygiene is good (I've heard that a lot of people with asperger's syndrome have bad hygiene.).  My organizational skills are crap but I'm working on them.      Based on all this information do you think I'm further along in life than most other people my age with asperger's syndrome?  I just want to know, because it's really affecting my self esteem.

And breaking promises is not what takes you to hell.       There is only ONE WAY to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell.       You're not saved yet. But you can be saved, right now, and you WILL be in heaven, no matter what, and will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what! :)       Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.       The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!       Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)"      my only thought: what does he/she smoken?      the american bible is a lie. anyone who has ever watched anime subbed that you cannot translate things perfectly between languages. i can hear you super-doper religious people yelling at the computer now, saying "God wanted it to be translated, so it is perfect!". words are a human thing, thus cannot be perfect. there is not a word for everything.      according to the american bible, Jesus never said "Get on your knees and honor me". oh, yeah, he did have a guy wash his feet, but he was offered that and just accepted. hi did not want us to honor him, but God.      Muhammad was the same way. he preached, and somehow become preached to instead of his God.       back to the point. if Jesus was the only way into heaven, then many would be going to hell. Hell, (bad pun) at least 2/3s of humans would.      so my question is, before i start complaining again, what do you think we, as humans, have to do in this life in order to have a successful afterlife?      thanks ^^

20090309162015AApbUgN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's your view on religion?	I never was a huge fan of religion, but after watching the movie Obession...it really made me think. The movie talks about the Islamic beliefs and why everything is happening, why there is terrosim, why they hate us, it's practically all due to religion. To me religion is an abomination. People place their radical ideals into other's head. Religion is the only true form of brainwashing. It starts wars, it causes hatred, and it causes death. People aren't born with these ideals, they are taught them. They are not born with hatred, they are taught it. Without religion, people would have to make themselves accountable for everything. Religion is like a parent, you rely on it till you realize the truth, that you have to take responsibility for your own actions. It is not your duty to please some "god" you may believe in. Some  people take comfort in religion when they have nothing. Others use it as a weapon. Which is why it should be abolished for good, but sadly that will never happen. Religion is the real war starter, the real arugment causer, the real killer, and would your so called "god" no matter what religion you are from want that? If so then that is not a god I would worship, and in that case I would never worship any type of god.      Please prove me wrong if you wish, or at least feel free to argue against me, and for the record...I'm only 14 :]

This program activity helped in the implementation of the regulative, particularly after decentralization and assignment of the local self-government with numerous jurisdictions in the environmental area.    This project involves various activities and has paid the attention of other institutions that supported it as the Ministry of Environment and physical planning and LEOFON mobile operator.       The “Green telephone line” had not been publicised in the daily newspapers because of high advertisement prices. From that reasons the “Green telephone lines” has been presented on the local media for free with which the local organisations have excellent cooperation. On some of them a promotional radio sport has been emitted and on the others were readily covered the activities of the organisations.

20090309152711AAdYEN4	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My girlfriend, sorry about this,?	Is being so mean lately. All I ever do is support her, I work my life around hers and she acts like I'm a option and just disposable. Just earlier, I told her that I loved her and she just went 'Mmm..'    I once spent hours waiting for her to show up at a restaurant on our two year anniversary and she stood me up. She texted me from the airport saying she was going on holiday. Usually i'm just passive about this to the point where i'm a doormat. I'm only eighteen and this is my first real relationship. I do have my whole life ahead of me but as much as I love this girl I can't let her treat me like dirt any longer, can I?      We have broken up before, but each time she has apologised and i've just taken her back. So we've been together, on and off, for almost three years.      I've tried talking to her about it but she just says 'you're too emotional' and I 'take things to heart'. I'm sorry, but in my opinion when you love someone their opinion seems to matter most. She is also so angry at everything all the time..       What shall I do? I don't want to leave her, but I don't know how long I can tolerate this anymore.

And then suddenly at some point, a plant mutates and stops consuming carbon dioxide and begins to burn oxigen and feed on plants. Or suddenly a plant gives birth to an animal. I like science fiction, and that one sounds like science fiction to me. A plant giving birth to an animal. What are the odds on that one? Add some more zeroes.

20090227154132AAVOrYh	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	If its the anatomy that counts, does that mean that gay men only care about sex? (Read Details First!)?	My son is gay and he is STILL my pride and joy. I cried when he first came out to me, but I accept it now. He's dating the sweetest young man I've ever met; I really like him. However, when I asked my son and other gay men why would they date feminine acting men if they're not attracted to women, they all told me "its the anatomy that counts" because women don't have penises.        So, if it's the anatomy that counts, are they implying that they only care about sex? I doubt that's the case because gay men are constantly telling a lot of ignorant homophobes that being gay isn't all about sex. However, they contradict themselves when they say it's the anatomy that counts when they date feminine men because the ONLY difference I see between a feminine man and an actual woman IS the anatomy. Emphasis on ONLY. I'm confused. Can someone make me understand. Please don't treat me like some bigot because I'm not.

So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”         He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”         The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.        He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to their dogs.”         “Yes, Lord,” she said, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”         Then Jesus answered, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.   —Matthew 15:21-28,

"Such was the view expressed", he added, "by Vatican Council II and the pontifical Magisterium, in particular by Servant of God John Paul II's Apostolic Letter 'Mulieris dignitatem' (15 August 1988). Yet, of more worth even than documents is the witness of saints; and our own times have seen that of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a humble daughter of Albania who, by the grace of God, became an example for the whole world in the exercise of charity and service to humankind.               "How many other women work unseen every day for the good of humanity and of the Kingdom of God !" he exclaimed.               Benedict XVI concluded by giving assurances of his prayers "for all women, in the hope that their dignity may always be respected and their positive potential turned to good use".

20090309165730AAe6W0p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians why blame the body when the body can do nothing without the spirit?	What kind of vehicle do you drive? I drive a 1984 Chevy Camaro who I named Betsy. If you were to look at Betsy, you would probably say that she is one ugly looking car. I have had a few people wanting to buy her. Just so they could strip her down and use her parts.    Her window is cracked. Her hood is tied down with a rope. She has a lot of dents in her. Her air condition doesn’t work. She has water that seeps through the window when it rains leaving my driver side floor damp. I have had to change her tire four times. The only thing worth looking at, is the CD/radio player.    In the two years that I have had her, Betsy has not let me down yet. And guess what she never will. Why is that? Because it impossible for a car to let anyone down since a car has no life of it’s own. We are the life source to our cars just as our spirit is the life source to our body.    Has your car ever started up on its on without you having a hand in it? Have your car ever taken you to the wrong side of town? Can you name one thing that your car has done wrong on it’s own (as far as going places and doing things that normally a car wouldn’t do)?   We as human being have a bad habit of blaming our physical body for the wrong we do when we do wrong. Yet it’s impossible for our physical body to do anything without the spirit.    Now when we do what is right, that is when we give credit to the spiritual part of our body.    If we steal, we give part of the blame to the physical body for the things we steal.   If we lie, we give part of the blame to the physical body for the lies we tells.   Whatever we wrong do, we never blame the spirit within ourselves. But we will either blame the devil, someone else or are human body for the wrong we do in life.   Let me ask you this question. Have you ever seen or heard of a dead man who lied, stole, murder, fornicate, commit adultery, commit sucide, or even mislead a person?   So many of us Christians are quick to blame the human side for the wrong we do instead of blaming the side that is really at fault.   For a long time we have been told. The spirit is strong but it’s the body that is weak.    In truth, without the spirit, all you have is a dead corpse. Without the body, all you have is a spirit.    When we die our physical body will be nothing but a body without the spirit. The question you should be asking yourself is, which spirit do you carry?   The spirit of God. Or the spirit of the devil? Matthew 6:24-25 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Food for thought. When we die, it is our spirit that will be judged. Not the body.

This girl would have risked to die if she had not aborted the twins.      How can the Roman Catholic Church defend such a position?

20090507065519AAzPLJQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, do you have "Scars" from a painful past?	Some years ago, on a hot summer day in South Florida ,   a little boy decided to go for a swim in the old swimming hole behind his house.   In a hurry to dive into the cool water, he ran out the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks, and shirt as he went.. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was swimming toward the shore. His father, working in the yard, saw the two as they got closer and closer together, In utter fear, he ran toward the water, yelling to his son as loudly as he could.   Hearing his voice, the little boy became alarmed and made a U-turn to swim to his father.   It was too late. Just as he reached his father, the alligator reached him. From the dock,   the father grabbed his little boy by the arms just as the alligator snatched his legs...That began an incredible tug-of-war between the two. The alligator was much stronger than the father,   but the father was much too passionate to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard his screams,   raced from his truck, took aim and shot the alligator. Remarkably, after weeks and weeks in the hospital,   the little boy survived. His legs were extremely scarred by the vicious attack of the animal.   And, on his arms, were deep scratches where his father's fingernails dug into his flesh in his effort   to hang on to the son he loved. The newspaper reporter who interviewed the boy after the trauma,   asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted his pant legs. And then, with obvious pride, he said to the reporter, 'But look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my Daddy wouldn't let go.' You and I can identify with that little boy. We have scars, too. No, not from an alligator,   but the scars of a painful past. Some of those scars are unsightly and have caused us deep regret.   But, some wounds, my friend, are because God has refused to let go.   In the midst of your struggle, He's been there holding on to you...The Scripture teaches that   God loves you. You are a child of God.. He wants to protect you and provide for you in every way. But sometimes we foolishly wade into dangerous situations, not knowing what lies ahead. The swimming hole of life is filled with peril -and we forget that the enemy is waiting to attack.   That's when the tug-of-war begins - and if you have the scars of His love,    be very, very grateful. He did not and will not ever let you go.

20090309164320AARcVvg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why was Jehovah so violent ? ?	MUCH OF THE Old Testament is devoted to describing the origins and early history of the Hebrew people. According to the Bible, the Hebrews descended from a clan which lived in the Sumerian city of Ur around 2000 to 1500 B.C. The clan was befriended and ruled by a personality named Jehovah. The Bible claims that Jehovah was God.       According to the Biblical narrative, Jehovah encouraged the clan to leave Ur and settle in Haran—a caravan center in northeastern Mesopotamia. There, Jehovah later told the clan’s new patriarch, Abraham, to lead his tribe on a migration towards Egypt. The tribe complied, and over the ensuing generations it slowly made its way through Canaan towards the Nile River. Starvation finally forced the tribe to enter the Egyptian region of Goshen where the Hebrew sat first lived well under the pharaoh, but upon the coming of a new king to the Egyptian throne, the Hebrews were forced into slavery.       The Bible points out that no one was permitted to approach Jehovah’s mountaintop except Moses and a few select leaders. Jehovah had threatened to kill anyone else who tried   Early human writers often portrayed mankind’s Custodial “Gods” as bloodthirsty creatures prone to excessive violence. Sadly, those lamentable qualities did not improve with Jehovah. During the trek from Egypt to the Promised Land, Jehovah demanded unflagging obedience from the Hebrews. Many humans rebelled and Jehovah reacted with extreme cruelty. Jehovah reportedly killed up to 14,000 Hebrews at a time for disobedience. He used a variety of killing methods, such as spreading diseases, just as other Custodial “Gods” had done earlier in Sumeria.         When the Hebrew armies reached Canaan, Jehovah displayed a genuinely psychopathic bent. To establish the Hebrews in their new homeland, Jehovah ordered the Hebrew armies to embark on a campaign of genocide to depopulate all of the region’s existing cities and towns. Under the new leadership of a man named Joshua, the first city to fall in Jehovah’s seven-year holocaust was Jericho. According to the Bible, the Hebrew army, numbering in the tens of thousands, slaughtered everyone in Jericho except, ironically, a prostitute because she had earlier betrayed her own people by helping two Hebrew spies:       And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ***, with the edge of the sword.   JOSHUA 6:21      After that was accomplished:      .. . they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.   JOSHUA 6:24   What does god need with silver and gold ?      The next target was Ai, a city with a population of 12,000 inhabitants. All of the citizens of Ai were butchered and the city was burned to the ground. This savagery was perpetrated city after city:      So Joshua killed all in the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the valleys, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.   JOSHUA 10:40      Does any one else find this a little strange ?   A kind loving God ?  I wonder

20090309171438AAef6Gh	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

After suffering from severe pain for 25 years, I lost quite a bit of faith in the MD's that I saw...One told me that my x-rays showed no arthritis, and then gave me arthritis meds, HHMMMM!   Other docs put me on pain meds, which my body adjusted to, making it necessary to continually increase the dosages.   After many years and countless doctors, a friend introduced me to a Chiropractor...with regular visits, at a minimal cost ($10-$20 per visit) I have successfully reduced the pain by about 80%!!!

20090309173837AAT55lw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	(Christians) Is salvation simply through faith in Jesus alone or do we also have to have gratitude?	I've heard the faith vs works argument done to death. Let's assume faith alone is the only requirement to get into heaven (ie faith that salvation lies through accepting Jesus is son of God who died for our sins)      Now, is it possible to merely believe the salvation story in the Bible (ie accept it as true) but be ambivalent toward God/Jesus and still get into heaven or is there an additional clause of also having to worship and love God/Jesus to get into heaven?      For example, if God were proven to be real there are many who would still label him as a monster and not give Him their thanks and praise while still accepting the fact that salvation lies with Him alone. Would they get into Heaven? Or would their ambivelence toward God be an unforgiveable sin (although the Bible says only one sin is unforgiveable and Jesus aleady paid the price for our sins anyway....)      Would satan get into heaven if he were human? I'm assuming *He* believes in Jesus as son of God and the saviour of makind but is actively working against him.

If performance is substandard, the person will be rejected by the higher being and go to hell or some other unpleasant place.       Christianity, by contrast, teaches that no person is good enough to be accepted into God’s kingdom and, therefore, we can be accepted by God only by God’s grace and mercy, which is possible through Jesus Christ.

I know this is a sticky situation as when my mother found out about the kids there was a lot of hurt and it led to my mother and fathers divorce.  This man raised me like I was his own, these children were hid from the family for years.  I know they didn't ask to be here but his is tough.

Don't say this isn't true, because I see it EVERYDAY.      So why is it ok for some black people to say they hate white people? Society seems to think that it's perfectly fine and it doesn't cause an uproar, but if I said I hate blacks ( WHICH I DON'T ) it'd be rightly considered racist and all hell would break loose .Shouldn't it work both ways?       Not trying to offend anybody, but it just seems wrong the way things are. We should all treat each other with respect.

20090309173242AA1zepa	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think he is avoiding me?	I like this guy that I go to school with. When I first saw him, I thought he was cute but I was too shy to talk to him. I don't have any classes with him so it was even harder to go to him and strike a conversation because I didn’t were to start      In addition, we take the same bus after school. I wanted to talk to him for a while but I was scared.      So last week when we were waiting for a bus, he looked at me twice and it seems like he wanted to say something. Then I was just like” isn’t it cold, today?' then we started talking.      He sat beside me in the bus and I asked his name and he returned the question. We have been talking since ever that day. We talk about everything .School, life, hobbies, work ect. When he tells me about his daily schedule, he never mentions anything about him dating someone else or if he has a girlfriend . We never run out of things to say when we talk.      I catch the same bus with him at certain time so i now always make sure i am on the bus stop around that time so i won't miss him.Anyways,today he didn't come on to the bus stop.I knew that he came to school because i saw him in his class when i was passing.I was disappointed and i feel rejected.      so do you think he got the vibe that i like him and he is now he is avoiding me

Also yes I understand that Here in America the Black people do not anymore want to be referred to as Knee Gro but is not the same as the N word which means ignorant .  Knee Gro is just a word for the race just like Caucasian. Why would Yahoo answers delete this word from my post. I honestly never saw it in the same context as the N word.  Please explain with out getting defensive. I want logical statements.

20090309104321AATOtUC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Door to door Evangelist or Something else?	Yesterday evening just as my husband was leaving for work (he works night shifts)  We saw to two men walking the road wearing suits & ties, each carry a book. At first I thought they were just walking like very one else does in the neighborhood  does for exercise then I noticed their clothes & saw that they weren't from around here.  We live out in the country & almost no one wears suits. My husband says their part of a group called Mormons. He stayed in his car in the drive way till the two men where at the end of the road. My husband says that usually the evangelists stop at each house to talk with people about the Bible. He said that its odd that the two men didn't stop at any houses & that they were walking at dust. My husband works at a prison so he is very alert to the way people act. He said this was odd because they looked at each house but didn't stop at any.  I've never meet any Mormons,  evangelist usually don't come to our neighborhood I've lived here five years & have  had evangelists come to my door only two times. And those where a group all Jehovah witnesses (not gripping, but the two men walking in suits, at dust is very odd for our neighborhood)       Could these guys be robbers or something posing as door to door evangelist or has my husband just work at the prison too long LOL?       Thanks I known this sounds odd

I talk to her occasionally and we have a good time. But there's one problem. She stinks. Everyday. The smell is similar to crusty feet or milk that has expired. Whenever she walks past someone you can get a full on whiff of the smell. I'm not the only one who has noticed either. The other children are constantly snickering and laughing behind her back. She is aware of this yet thinks their just kidding and thinks their her friends. (She's a bit naive) In reality they hate her. I want to tell her straight up but I'm unsure of how to do it. I don't want her to be made fun of anymore. The smell is also affecting me. She sits next to me and it very hard to concentrate. The smell even gets me a little light headed. I'm not sure she notices her odor. What should I do???

It keeps bad people from doing what they like for fear of punishment. It keeps societies in order who might otherwise not have a common factor keeping them together. It ensures that people will obey and follow. Imagine if 6,000,000,000 people decided to all do their own thing and not follow a belief system uniting how they think. In short people need to be controlled in masses. Thoughts?      PS: I don't like religion and I'm not a believer of anything.

Doesn't the soul of the Foetus go directly to heaven? How is sparing that foetus the pain of life on Earth with dismal preconditions and prospects for success Irreparably harmful?      "2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.

20090309140110AAje7oh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do we sort out the sin in the following situation?	Believe it or not this is a true story.      A man and a woman get married but not in a church although they are both Catholic (sin?)      After a couple of years, with growing discontent they engage in couples therapy in which the husband indicates that he has always felt like a women. After many months of discussion,  the husband starts the process and eventually has a transgender operation (sin ?).      The wife decides to stay with him, now her (sin?)      Strangely enough, after several years, the wife decides to have a transgender operation herself  and the husband (now she) decides to stay with  her, now him (sin?).      If anyone is counting they seem to have had two hetero and two homosexual relationships!      They eventually get divorced (sin?)

20090309143205AApGxfJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can we be responsible for something we did not do?	Our sinful nature is.... well, human nature. It is in our nature. How could we possibly help it?       For example, lust, or being attracted to the opposite sex, is a genetic impulse. We cannot help thinking dirty thoughts at times, it's simply in our nature. No man on earth has not sinned, so is it not clear that we simply cannot help it? Even the best of us fall to it.      So, would giving wages for sin (aka death) not be tantamount to, for example, punishing someone for being black? We can help it no more then we can help what color hair we have, so how could one possibly be held responsible?      Yes, one could say that we are not judged by our sin but by whether we accept jesus or not, but who says that we even need saving anyway? The whole point of having to accept jesus is because god blames us for being sinful, so instead of paying our bailout, why not just NOT CHARGE the offense in the first place?

He allegedly beat a person, a woman, as if they were a meat puppet.      People are calling for his career to be over....forever.      Are we forgetting he is 19...still a child!      Should he do jail time: yes.      However, in the industry he is in...that will stop nothing. It may even help! To pretend that the R&B community does not embrace aggression in the industry would be foolish.       However, should people be actively looking at social programs that force Chris Brown to confront the consequence of his behavior through other people...but allow him the chance to return to his life and career after FIXING HIMSELF.      The justice system is not about eternal punishment and stigmas....it SHOULD be about rehabilitation.       If Rhianna were my daughter i would tell her to stay away from him...even do what i physically could to ensure this.

I see many of the hardcore christians going on about how if you don't believe in Jesus you're going to Hell. If merely not believing in something that cannot be proven and sounds illogical gets you damned for eternity, doesn't that mean God has set the bar for entry to Heaven rather high, and just about everyone is going to Hell ? I'm just picturing something out of South Park where Kenny dies and the counter for Heaven is about 100 and the counter for Hell is in the 10s of Billions and counting in increments too fast to read...      I was just curious as Christians seem to all know what the criteria for Hell is (anyone who thinks different than they do) but I never see anyone referring to the requirements for Heaven.

She claims he wasn't there for her emotionally and spiritually and that was the reason for her cheating even though but he worked two jobs to take care of the two of them. They have a fight one day (unrelated to the cheating) and they separated for two weeks during which he tried to reconcile with her. He finds out not even two weeks after their fight that the guy she cheated with proposed and she accepted. He had to find this out through her web page. She constantly posts all over her web page that her fiance "is a blessing from God."       I know this is a dumb question, but I hear people do that all the time: claim that God has blessed them with something or in her case, someone, that was obtained through hurting someone else.

20090309114300AA95zgs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Nonreligious, we have reached the 15% mark. Cardinal William Levada thinks atheists are absurd, What do you...?	...think?       I always giggle when someone of inferior intelligence thinks I am absurd or silly. I also laugh when they use the strawman argument that evolution proves their is no god. Evolution never said there is no god, although its implications are that a theistic god hypothesis is unnecessary.       Isn't this just another example of a theist trying to fall back on deism so as to look like they accept science when they clearly do not? It is a well known fact that Catholics believe in supernatural selection, not natural selection.

20090309135142AAktLWx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the assumption that "all people are created equal" (races) a religious assumption?	Is the assumption that "All people are created equal" a religious assumption? Religious cultures and mindsets change every few centuries, and the "all people are created equal" principle is a major religious and theistic assumption in modern times.      *Are all of the human races really equal? We like to assume so, because "God wouldn't turn out an inferior product". The belief in equality of the races is an integral aspect of modern religious thought. But, is it true? Are there inherent differences in IQ, moral reasoning, and self control between the different human races?      The different races spent centuries, and in some cases even millenia, relatively separated from other races. They evolved under different circumstances. If inherent and fundamental differences between the races can be scientifically proven, I'd give up my agnosticism and call myself an atheist. However, if such differences do not exist (making humans a truly unique species in this regard), I just might consider this to be evidence for an intelligent designer (God) that made sure that no one race of people was inherently superior or inferior to any other.      FYI, James Watson, a pioneer in the study of DNA, made the claim that Africans (blacks) are less intelligent than Europeans (whites). There was an uproar of criticism against him that probably resembled the uproar against Darwin in his time:    http://www.independent.co.uk/news/scienc...       If some human races are inherently superior to others, I'd either figure that there is no God, or if God does exist, it truly does not care about us humans one bit (and has no sense of fairness).
20090309124119AAjhO6y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow christians- help with bible passages for strength?	I have a demon in my apartment, it is one that has fallowed me since I was very young. I cant see it but I know it is there and sometimes it manifests in my dreams. Some nights I cant sleep because of it, and the other night as I was laying awake I realized something. In one moment I knew that if I don't get rid of it I'm going to lose my mind. Up until now it hasn't really bothered me much, and since I'm born again I know it cant posses me, but that doesn't stop it from feeding off me.       Ok thats the story and this is what I need help with. About a month ago I resolved to tell my husband so we could call together a group of prayer warriors to cast it out and then seal the doors and windows. But for some reason I cant do it. If I had to choose a label I would say I'm a non-denominational christian, and he is reformed Episcopal, so our views on things don't really match up. Im afraid of how he will react when I tell him and if he will take me serious. Every time I say OK now I'm going to do it, I just cant fallow through. I have been praying and reading my Bible but I'm not getting any closer to being able to tell him.      Please any scripture or advice on gathering strength you could give me would be greatly appreciated.      And non-believers I would be much obliged if you would just stay out of this one, thank you.

20090309143431AAM3oDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this too much to ask from someone? for a religion.?	Me and my man (not my husband yet ) and our two kids have recently started going to a mormon latter day saints church in gastonia NC. We both have a good feeling about the church and all. But the things we will have to do are kinda hard on us ,especially my man. He has for months now gave up alcohol and pot. He is still a smoker though. Im proud of what he has stopped doing so far. MY fear is that now that he is exspected to also give up smoking coffee and tea and us to be married before we can be babtized in the church will just be too much for him and me actually. I really like the church and feel good about the religion and alot of things about the overall belief more so than other beliefs but it just seems alot to give up for him. Today we went to the grocery store to get grocerys and he even looked at the other teas out there the herbal ones and we bought green tea which tasted good but then i found out that green tea is still tea. He is gonna feel frustrated when he gets home from school and i tell him that the green tea we bought is still against the belief. Any advice here from other mormons would be greatly apreaciated. We are hard on money right now so any money spent wrongly is frustrating.

20090309142235AAQpoVt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The number of people who died in Holocausts?	Whenever a debate about the number of Jews who died in the German holocaust makes the news, I am struck that no one seems to remember holocausts of a much greater scale that occured just before.      From 1894 to 1922 - the Turks martyred, massacred and starved over 3.5 million Christian Greeks, Armenians and Syrians.      And in the 1930's alone, between seven and twelve MILLION Ukrainian Christians were systematically and deliberately starved to death by the Communists.      It just seems so sad to me that Americans have largely forgotten these victims.
20090309144347AACP5ng	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	According to the prophet Joseph Smith...?	There are people in this world that will never know of religion. Whether it be children, or people that live in secluded areas of the world, there are people who know nothing of religion.       I was curious what happens to these people if they don't know know any better. While looking this up online, I found that the "Prophet Joseph Smith" claims that god informed him that all those who don't know any better will be offered the highest kingdom in heaven. So a newborn child that dies will be granted a spot in the highest kingdom of heaven. Pretty cool if that's true.       So based on that, wouldn't we want to not tell anyone about their religion? Because if nobody knew about it, then everyone would go to the highest kingdom in God's heaven. So literally "Ignorance is bliss".       Please answer the question. Please don't just say "There is no heaven you moron" or whatever. I'm not saying there is or isn't a heaven. I'm not saying there is or isn't a god. All I'm asking is based on the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, ignorance will grant you entry into heaven, so shouldn't we just get rid of religion, so everyone will be ignorant of it?

At my best guess, I'd say maybe a year or so, but logic tells me that in order to get the kind of following that Jesus had in the end (to where thousands of people would come listen to him speak), years would've had to have passed, based on how news traveled back then (word of mouth, etc)      Anyhow, I'm not sure.

20090309125016AAAZ2vu	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think Nadya Sulman is viewed more negatively in the media becuase she is a minority?	I mean let's be real.The other popular cases of mothers who used drugs to conceive multiple babies were mainly white people. When this occurred in the past there were parades, red carpet and companies lined up down the block to sponsor the kids.      However since Sulman just so happens to be a minority I feel like they treat her like she has committed a crime. Why is it she get treated differently? Do you think if she was white she would prob have her own Disney movie like the other families?

20090309123424AAUvoaG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you agree with this quote Christians/ Atheists?	I do. By Obama. He said that when he lifted the ban on stem cell research.      "Promoting science isn't just about providing resources, it is also about protecting free and open inquiry," Obama said. "It is about letting scientists like those here today do their jobs, free from manipulation or coercion, and listening to what they tell us, even when it's inconvenient especially when it's inconvenient. It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda and that we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology."      I'm glad he said this into today's society. If he said that 500 or 400 years ago, I'd be saying bye to his charred body.
