Okay. There is this girl who I have known and been BEST friends with since 3rd grade. The only thing is, she likes me and constantly tries to flirt with me in public and in private. I am bisexual and at one time I thought that I had liked her so when she would flirt with me, I would flirt back and so on, but lately I have realized that I do love her, but I only love her as my friend who I have known all of my life. Honestly, I feel horrible for ever leading her on like that without knowing my true feelings for her first, but I know that there is nothing I can do to change that now. I also feel bad because I've always been the one she has called when things go wrong and if she got rejected and is upset and I do not want to reject her and make her feel terrible. So, here is my question, how to I make it clear that I like her only as a friend without hurting her feelings, and when she flirts with me how do I let her know that it makes me uncomfortable without telling her straight forward? Thank you for all of your help and any answer is greatly appreciated.

On a clear and moonlit night, in the dark cave of hirat, a man began to cry, oh ALLAH show me the light.    Tell me why i was created,   were will i go after i die?   what's the purpose of this life,   were people murder and lie...   how can i stop the corruption, oh ALLAH your my only guide.   On that clear and blessed night, jibreal came to hirat,   he hugged prophet Muhammed(pbuh) until he thought he would die.   READ OH MUHAMMED READ! IN THE NAME OF YOUR LORD, BY ALLAH YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN ABOVE THE WHOLE OF MANKIND, YOU'VE BEEN ELEVATED HIGH..LIKE THE MOON IN THE SKY.      HE PRAID WHILE, OTHERS SLEPT, WHILE OTHERS ATE, HE'D FAST. WHILE THEY WOULD LAUGH HE WEPT, UNTIL BE BREATHED HIS LAST!:'(      HIS ONLY WISH WAS FOR US TO BE...AMONG THE ONES WHO PROSPER. YA MUHAMMED PEACE BE ON YOU, TRULY YOU ARE OUR TEACHER.      LET'S SEND BLESSINGS ON MUHAMMED, AND THE FAMILY OF MUHAMEMD, THE PURIFIED ONES.      ALLAHUMASALEHALAH, MUHAMMED, WA ALIHI MUHAMMED.      :'( today i went to majalis, and we mourned for our beloved prophet.      Mankind's great loss was the death of this great, great, great and MOST inspirtational man.      A book written by a Jew, and also a british on most influencial people, and in number one, our nabia karim Muhammed salahualyhiwalasalam.      He is described by athiests who've studied as being the most inspirational man that's ever lived.      All the prophets, and the divine Imams, and the angels, mourn for Muhammed(pbuh) on this day,      to those who've come to insult, atleast today if you don't want to have respect for thebeloveved holy prophet, do not insult him and put us to greater grief, have some humility.

20090223141327AAIkcXD	Society & Culture;Holidays;Easter	Suggestions needed for my macrobiotic Easter plans?	I have decided that my family, in the interest of health, shall embrace a macrobiotic lifestyle.  I will inform them of this on Easter; I like the symbolism of new beginnings, and think this is something exciting for them.      For Easter, the kids won't be getting unhealthy eggs and candy.  As a substitute for Easter eggs, they will have egg-shaped brown rice balls wrapped in colourful nori, kombu, and other festive seaweeds.  I think the kids will have tons of fun making their treats!  To replace candy, since macrobiotic teachings look down on sweets, they will have fruit; I have decided on a good detox fruit to fill their baskets with: grapefruit      The Easter ham will still be made by my wife, but I will be the only one partaking of it; children and women are more adaptable to new eating styles than men, so I will take it slow in accommodating myself, but I am anxious for my family to embrace the full benefits of this healthy lifestyle.  As a special treat for the day, we will go to the park, and watch the families taking part in the city's public easter egg hunt, with all of the unhealthy candy, and character-deadening toys and treats that the poor children from families without caring fathers have to suffer with; it will be a good lesson for my family to understand and appreciate my loving efforts on their behalf, and to abhor the unhealthy indulgences of the other families.  We will then go home, where my family will have their steamed tempeh and beets, while I suffer with the ham.  The family will have the opportunity to express their thanks at this new, healthy, positive lifestyle, with the goodness of brown rice, seaweed, and every other wonderful thing in macrobiotic cuisine.      Any other suggestions for making this the best macrobiotic Easter ever?

Hey :) I'm Rachael, 13, and I go to a private all girls school. One of the girls there is, well, amazing, not just in looks. She has a hyperactive, mad personality like mine ^^ and I feel she really is on the same page as me.      A couple of nights ago she slept over at my place. We watched the Mighty Boosh (the first series is ******* AMAZING), ate/drank hulahoops and WKD, and bitched non stop about Hannah Furness (horrible bully). Heaven ...       We also went on our Animal Crossing DS games and went to eachother's towns, generally messing about and leaving rude messages on the town bulletin board (lol). She shut her DS off first, and moved to my end of the bed to watch me on mine. When her arm brushed mine it was .. electrical. ****. Talk about sparks.      I shut my DS off about 2 minutes later, but she didn't go back down the other side of the bed to sleep, she just nodded off then. My arms were curled around her and it felt ******* amazing. I fell asleep soon afterwards.      In the morning everything was normal, obviously. We chatted on, she left at 10am to go do the drama rehersals she had, and I've been wishing I was still back to that night ever since, cursing myself for falling asleep that quickly. Now it's gone, I wish I'd savoured the moment.      I really like her, but I don't know if she's bi or gay or straight or what (but I know what she thinks about it and also she ******* LOVES yaoi) and if she doesn't like me back then I don't want to screw up a great friendship.      Advice please?  xx

Ok, this question might give you a good belly laugh, but I ask mostly because of curiosity. The Bible says in Genesis 4:20-21 that Jabal's brother, Jubal, was the father of all who play the harp and flute. Here is a link so you can read it for yourself if you want. It's in the New International Version.  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    My question is, who do you say was the father of all who play the harp and flute? Was it really Jubal or was it someone else? Just curious...   Also, I want to see what the sources outside the Bible has to say about this. You know, like other religious books, history, archaeology, science, etc. I would be very interested in reading them.

I understand that Christians believe The Holy Bible to be the word of God, but considering there is a lot of discussion about interpretation AND I think all Christians would agree that your God has the final authority..       Don't you think it's a bit presumptuous to make claims about who is going to hell and who isn't? I can even see how it would be okay to say, "If you do X, the bible says you will not enter the kingdom of heaven." But to actually tell a person, "You will go to hell." How could you possibly know that?       Don't you ever stop and think that you might receive your own slap on the wrist for claiming power and wisdom you don't possess?

20090223145124AAIfPL2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Were the first religions monotheistic or polytheistic?	I think that the concept of monotheism is a relatively modern concept in regards to the length of time that humans have been perceiving reality with a rational, thinking mind. I think today’s monotheistic religions have in place spiritual apparatus to deter people from a polytheistic persuasion. The Judeo/Christian Ten Commandments indicate this with the “Thou shall have no gods before me,” notice the “gods” plural? And the Arabs religion, Islam, has a similar apparatus in place with their mantra that goes something like, “There are no gods but Allah.”       So is it reasonable to conclude that monotheism replaced polytheism?

20090223144206AATSaMG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What religious group(s) had no part in the two world wars?	There is an ancient book that advises its readers against all forms of occultism but it contains many predictions about world developments in our own 20th century. It has much to say about the political affairs of our times. But, because of this, is this book meddling in the politics of our day? Is this book encouraging its readers to dabble in human politics so as to interfere with political rulers? To politicians who want to accuse the Holy Bible of being such a book, we answer, No! In one of the last books of the Bible the Christian apostle John writes:“Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—1?John 2:15-17. The very last book of the Bible, also written by this same apostle John, describes how this world and its politics will pass away.   However, there are religious leaders, even popes, patriarchs and archbishops, that argue against Christian neutrality and say that it is the bounden duty of each and every Christian to take an active part in the political affairs of this world.    On various occasions, Jesus had made known that Satan rules this present wicked world, but because of Jesus’ integrity, Satan had no hold on him. (Matthew 4:8-11; John 14:30) In our time powerful nations, notably “the king of the north” and “the king of the south,” have struggled for world domination. (Daniel 11:40) Patriotic fervor has been whipped up, and the cult of emperor worship has a modern-day counterpart in the wave of nationalism that has swept the earth. Articles on neutrality in The Watchtower of November?1, 1939, and again of November?1, 1979, and September?1, 1986, have clearly stated the Bible’s teaching on this issue, providing guidelines for those Christians who want to walk in the name of Jehovah and conquer the world, as Jesus so courageously did.—Micah 4:1, 3,?5; John 16:33; 17:4, 6, 26; 18:36, 37; Acts 5:29. Such counsel has been urgently needed. In the face of unreasoning patriotic fervor, Jehovah’s Witnesses, both anointed ones and their companions, have had to stand firm in the faith.

20090223145617AAcIseK	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Luca was gay, this is the song that has almost won the Italian ''Festival di San Remo''?	I'm Italian, I'm sorry my english is not very good.      ''Il festival di San Remo'' is the national music festival of Italy, this year a song with the title ''Luca era gay'' (luca was gay) sung by Giuseppe Povia, got the second place.   I think everybody should know how emblematic this fact is. The Italian parliament's majority made all the possible efforts to impede gays, bisexuals and lesbians a dignified life; today people let Giuseppe Povia win the second prize of a national singing competition.   The song's aim is showing that is possible to switch your sexual orientation, the song's aim is giving you an example of how your sexual orientation can come from a discomfort you could really get over! That ridiculous pin head has bejewelled all the '70s platitudes and has even slandered Freud. The song is entirely a shame.The song says, on top of that, "some used to say ‘it’s natural.’   I studied Freud and he didn’t think the same". It's a pity Freud says the contrary. I think this is pornography. He says ''This is my story, only my story, no illness, no recovery.'' I suppose he thinks that courtesy and particularity in a story allow to say anything. What if someone said: ''I met a man, his skin was black and he was really dirty, no racism, it's just my story''?   At the end of his performances he even showed two placards: ''nobody is always right'' and ''serene is better than happy''      Povia conveys a heterosexist message, whorty of representing that Catholic Italy collapsing under the bells towers' weigh.   Luca was gay, Povia is unspeakable.          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTVuDZbw6...          Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man.      1st VERSE:   Luca says: Before telling you about my sexual change, I want to clarify that if I believe in God I can’t recognise myself in human thought which is divided on this matter, I haven’t gone to psychologists, psychiatrists, priests nor scientists.      I’ve gone into my past, delved into it and found out a lot about myself.      My mother had too much love for me, her love turned into full obsession with her convictions, her attentions wouldn’t let me breathe.      My father used to take no decisions and I could never talk with him, he was away at work all day, but I had the feeling that wasn’t the truth, that’s why Mum asked for divorce, I was 12 and didn’t   really understand my father, he said ‘that’s the right solution’ and started to drink after sometime.      Mum always spoke badly of Dad to me and used to say ‘never get married, for God’s sake.      She was sick jealous of my girlfriends and my identity was growing confused.      Chorus:   Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man      Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man.      2nd VERSE:      I’m another man now, but at that time I was looking for answers, I was ashamed so looked for my answers in hiding, some used to say ‘it’s natural.’      I studied Freud and he didn’t think the same, then high school finished but I didn’t know what happiness was, a big man made my heart shake and that’s when I knew I was a homosexual.      I had no inhibitions with him, he courted me and I thought that was love, yes with him I could feel myself, but then it became like a competition on who made the best sex.      I felt guilty, sooner or later they’ll catch him, but if evidence disappears he’ll be acquitted.      I was looking for who my father was in men, and I used to go with men not to betray my mother.      2nd Chorus:   Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart. Luca says I’m another man.      Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man.      SPECIAL:   Luca says: For 4 years I’d been with a man through love and deceptions, we often betrayed each other.      I was still looking for my truth, that big eternal love, then I met her at a party, among a lot of people, she had nothing to do with it all, she listened to me, undressed me, understood me. I only remember that I missed her the day after.      This is my story, only my story, no illness, no recovery.      Dear Dad, I’ve forgiven you even though you’ve never come back here.      Mum, I often think of you and I love you, and sometimes still see your reflection.      But now I’ve become a father and I’m in love with the only woman I’ve ever loved.      Final Chorus:   Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man.      Luca was gay and now he’s together with her, Luca speaks from his heart, Luca says I’m another man.         I can't stand what the nation I live in is becoming.       What's your impression about this song? Isn't it A REAL SHAME?

MUCHAS GRACIAS:)   and PLEASE DONT USE ANY TRANSLATION WEBSITES... they don't work very well. plez      PLEASE TRANSLATE THE FOLLOWING:      For several decades drugs have been one of the major problems of society. There have been escalating costs spent on the war against drugs and countless dollars spent on rehabilitation, but the problem still exists. Not only has the drug problem increased but drug related problems are on the rise. Drug abuse is a killer in our country. Some are born addicts, while others become users.      Many believe that legalizing drugs would lessen crime. They point out that the legalization of drugs would deter future criminal acts. They also emphasize and contrast Prohibition. When the public realized that Prohibition could not be enforced the law was repealed. From this, one may infer the same of legalizing drugs. Legalizing alcohol didn't increase alcoholism, so why would drugs increase drug abuse?      However, drugs should not be legalized because there would be an increase in drug abuse due to its availability. Once legalized, drugs would become cheaper and more accessible to people who previously had not tried drugs, because of the high price or the legal risk. Drug abuse would skyrocket! Addicts who tend to stop, not by choice, but because the drugs aren't accessible would now feed the addiction if drugs were made legal.      Although people feel that legalizing drugs would lessen crime, drugs should remain illegal in the U.S because there would be an increase of drug abuse and a rapid increase of diseases such as AIDS. The United States can not afford this problem. It has become a world power by strengthening its people not by killing them. Drug abuse has gotten worse, with its effects on crack babies, drug addicts, and the I.V user. There must be education for the survival of this nation, not legalization.

"The whole system that we live in drills into us that we're powerless that we're weak that our society is evil ect. and so forth. It's all a big fat lie, we are powerful, beautiful and extraordinary. There is no reason why we cannot understand who we truly are, where we are going, there is no reason why the average individual cannot be fully empowered, we are incredibly powerful beings."      "I think I spent 30 years of my life, trying to become something, I wanted to become good at things, I wanted to become good at tennis, I wanted to become good at school and grades and everything I kind of viewed in that perspective. I'm not okay the way I am, but if I got good at things. I realized I had the game wrong, because the game was to find out what I already was."      "Now in our culture we have been trained for individual differences to stand out, so you look at each person and immediate hit is brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer and we make all of these dimensional distinctions, put them in categories and treat them that way. And we get so that we only see others as separate from ourselves, in the ways in which they're separate and one of the dramatic characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways in which they are like you, not different from you, and experiencing the fact that which is essence in you, and which is essence in me, is indeed ONE, the understanding that there is no other, it is all one.   I wasn't born Richard Albert, I was just born as a human being and then I was TAUGHT and learned this whole business of who I am and whether I'm good or bad or achieving or not, and all of that is learned along the way."

20090223151342AAXvbcR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you find that ethnic discrimination within one's own race is more prevalent than racism from another race?	If so, do you attribute this with a testimony to the difference in culture?, or do you find it plain ignorant?      Many times have I seen my own Black Caribbeans discriminate Black Africans with reasons ranging from their skin tone to their accent/dialect/facial structure.      I can not stress how much more hurtful it is to be racially insulted by someone of your own kind as opposed to a white person when you take culture as serious as me. You feel like you have been stabbed in the back.       I think a word like Ethnicism should be created (if it isn't already, I haven't checked but I doubt it), because where I'm from (London), it is more common to be ethnically discriminated by your own race, then to be racially abused by another race. (In my own experience).      Also, It's not just in England, I know how certain lighter skinned blacks in America can think that they are more attractive than darker girls and put them down, or dark girls hate on lighter girls because they reject their appearance before getting to know their personality.      This it seems, is a problem persistent in black communities... Our diversity is like a curse to ourselves, we really should learn to cut out ethnic discrimination. Seriously, I actually think white people sit back and laugh at some of the stuff black people do to each other. They do not have this problem in their race to be quite honest I don't think their is an excuse to have it in ours anymore. I blame this on ignorance and people being spoon fed the media's propaganda.       (I say anymore because it should have ended, I am aware that any differences in black folk was a tool used to separate blacks during slavery).

Are they really saying, “I have seen things that I *believe* are miracles…”? Which is like saying, “I have seen things that I can’t explain and I’m not even going to try to rationally explain it but I’m just going to think this is proof that the stuff without evidence that I *believe* is the truth”? You know, “Modern medicine and a bone marrow transplant didn’t save little Timmy from leukemia; I *believe* it was Jebus!”?       The key word is ‘believe,’ but why do religious people seldom qualify their statements with the word ‘believe’? Is this deliberate dishonesty on their part because if they were to acknowledge that the stuff they *believe* is just a bunch of beliefs, then it diminishes their ideologies, right? You know, saying “God is real” sounds a lot more convincing than saying “I believe God is real” even though the honest statement is the latter and the former is tinged with dishonesty, right? Because religion is all about convincing other people to believe the stuff that the believer believes…right? Just like an insurance salesman tries to convince people that their life would be better if they had insurance…

I recently learned that he has already had sex, and when I heard, I got very upset, kind of hurt. I've never even talked to the guy, so I have no clue why I'm feeling upset at this.

The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. The systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.      That is what God has bean doing to the entire human race. Yes we have free will and free choice, except the choice to be free.

Luke 12:5   But I’ll tell you whom to fear. Fear God, who has the power to kill you and then throw you into hell. Yes, he’s the one to fear.      "The use or threatened use of force or violence." Hell is a place that is so bad that we should cut off a hand or cut out an eye to avoid going there. In Luke 12:5 Jesus  tells us to fear God the one who "has power to throw you into hell." “Don’t be afraid of those who want to kill your body. Fear only God". Think of the worst most terrible things we have seen thru human history. According to Matthew 10:28 God should be feared more that being burned at the stake, crucified on a cross, tortured, raped ECT. because God has the power to cast you into hell the most violent and terrifying place in existence.       "With the intention of intimidating or coercing." How is "fallow me or you go to hell" any different that a terrorist demands?

20090223152149AAi8oUB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does God work in some people's life and not others?	My girlfriend and I were together for two years when I found out she had been cheating on me with the same person she is now engaged to. She says she is the happiest she's ever been and that God has blessed her with her fiance. I find that funny considering she had to lie, deceive and cheat on me to get it. I've racked my brains to figure out what I could have done wrong because figure I had to deserve it but I can't come up anything. I thought surely God wouldn't bless her after she betrayed and deceived me the way she did. And then not only did she do it but had the unmitigated gall to attach His name to it. But sure enough, she's still engaged, still happy and has set her wedding date - and that's cool and all. But what does that say about me if He can let her get away with what she's done and then bless her on top of that. I turned away from God because of this because I don't understand...it feels like there's two stab wounds in my back instead of one. I've got to be looking at this wrong but I can't come up with another explanation.

20090223152650AAV8oUw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why do people think it's wrong for two people of the same gender to love?	I can only think of two reasons, and no, I'm not flaming those who hold this belief.    1. The Bible says so and you're not looking at the situation from the person who IS homosexual.   2. It seems plain wrong because you don't have those feelings.       I can understand some of the Bible's teachings against certain wrongs, but NOT the one, against homosexuality. It is no different from heterosexuality except for who you're loving. Love is not morally wrong, obviously. Just because one is born with the trait of homosexuality, they can't partake in love without being frowned upon? I think that's ridiculous. (And yes, studies show there is a genetic predisposition that makes someone more apt to be homosexual, and in some cases, there's little you can do about it.)      Some say homosexuality is a sin because a baby can't result. Many couples have sex using natural methods of birth control (the rhythmic (sp?) method and/or timing sex with the female's periods) and those are accepted by the church. That, and many non-fertile couples still have sex. This isn't morally wrong (according to MANY Christian faiths including Catholicism), but homosexuality is? =/      They are simply doing as they choose and should be left alone. They're not hurting anything by doing this, contrary to other so-called "sins". It is not destructive. Love is one of the most prominent emotions. Imagine going about life without being able to take pleasure in looking at other people that appear appealing to you, because that would be called a sin. Imagine never having HOPE of finding who loves you back in that special way.       That's life for a homosexual that follows God's so called law. Hell, that's why many homosexuals end up depressed when deprived of love. They'd be healthier and happier people nine times out of ten being able to share their emotions with that special someone. Isn't that what God wants?      I just have never heard a firm argument against homosexuality in my life, and I thought this would be a good place to ask. Convince me. After all, I'm still an easily influenced 16 year old. :^D

We reread carefully the articles about the case, in particular those that had appeared on the dailies of Verona. They didn’t furnish us with any interesting elements. The examining people had embraced the hypothesis of the showdown and the case was soon disappeared from the news. But, by chance, I read the name of the woman who had signed almost all the pieces of the most important local newspaper and it put me suddenly in good humour. Maybe I had found who could help us.    Paola Narduzzi, before becoming journalist and moving to Verona, had been the woman of a drummer from Padua who played in a jazz group. She followed him from club to club and, when she got bored, which happened often enough, (she) killed time drinking a gin fizz after the other. When I had met her, she was drunk and she was drunk also the last time I saw her.    I called the newspaper. The usual ill-tempered operator informed me that Mrs Narduzzi went out for a report, but before evening she would return. We parked our car nearby the editing, in a place where the visual allowed us to control the main door of the palace.    “It’s her,” I told my colleague, when I saw her enter. We let her had time to make herself comfortable to the writing desk and then we turned up in the porter’s lodge.   “Marco Buratti, alias the alligator!” she exclaimed surprised. “How many years had passed… well, better not to count them,” added giggling.    Then she showed off a very serious face. “I stopped drink,” she declared solemnly, “now only some joint when I’m depressed.”   “A healthy life that will do the job these days,” I commented conversational.

20090223151549AADU9mn	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Three Tough Questions Asked!!!!!?	??? ???? ?????? ??????    Peace   There was a young man who went overseas to study for quite a long time. When he returned, he asked his parents to find him a religious scholar or any expert who could answer his Three Questions.    Finally, his parents were able to find a Muslim scholar.      "Who are you? Can you answer my questions?," asked the young man      "I am one of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala)'s slaves and Insha'Allah (God willing), I will be able to answer your questions," replied the Scholar.      "Are you sure? A lot of Professors and experts were not able to answer my questions," replied the young boy      "I will try my best, with the help of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala)"       "I have 3 questions," began the boy      1. Does God exist? If so, show me His shape.      2. What is takdir (fate)?      3. If shaitan (Devil) was created from the fire, why at the end he will be thrown to hell that is also created from fire. It certainly will not hurt him at all, since Shaitan (Devil) and the hell were created from fire. Did God not think of it this far?      Suddenly, the Scholar slapped the young man's face very hard!      The young man, who was shocked and hurt by the slap became confused, "Why do are you angry at me?" he asked      "I am not angry," answered the scholar, "The slap is my answer to your three questions."      "I really don't understand," the young man said. He was really confused.       The scholar began to explain, "How did you feel after I slapped you?," he asked      "Of course, I felt the pain. it hurt," he replied      "So do you believe that pain exists?" the scholar asked      "Yes."      "Now Show me the shape of the pain!" said the wise Scholar      "I cannot," the young man replied      "That is my first answer. All of us feel God's existence without being able to see His shape... Last night, did you dream that you will be slapped by me?," the ascholar replied      "No"      "Did you ever think that you will get a slap from me, today?," the scholar continued      "No."       "That is takdir (fate)........" The scholar continued, "My hand that I used to slap you, what is it created from?"      "It is created from flesh," replied the young man       "How about your face, what is it created from?"      "Flesh, as well" replied the young man      "How did you feel after I slapped you?"      "In pain."       "Even though Shaitan (satan) and Jahunnum (Hell-fire) were created from fire, if Allah wants, insha'Allah (God willing), the Hell-fire will become a very painful place for Shaitan (Devil)" ended the wise Scholar.

I used to have a best friend who I thought was the nicest person in the world. but she did things that made me think otherwise, like she never called me unless i called her first, we never hung out unless i asked first when we did we had a so much fun though. she seemed like she never made the effort to see me or call. But i am kinda confused because she told me some of her deepest secrets because she said she trust me, i'm not sure if she was just using me as a her venting machine when we did hang out, shes a very talkative person. She tells me things on how she uses her boyfriend because shes afraid of being alone. BUt other times she says she just prefers to be alone even though she is so social with every one she meets. she doesn't have a lot of friends but its not because she s anti social everybody thinks shes really cool and nice. I am really confused. What do you think of this person?

Second of all, he tends to be set on his ways, does not know how to be romantic, and will not initiate sex or anything unless i take the lead and that is really fustrating alot. Well i am a bottom and i like a top who can take the lead see what i mean, so that is a bit fustrating.

I know the age defference plays a factor into the picture, but can someone help me out by giving me some advices on what i could do to make things more intriguing int he bedroom, cause my starting sex all the time is getting old and boring to me.

Un alcohólico es una persona enferma que padece sufrimiento y desórdenes físicos y mentales, además del desprecio de sus semejantes y por lo general acaba en la miseria y muerto en la calle.Piensas que irá al infierno solo porque a un fanático como Saulo se le ocurrió escribir que "los borrachos no heredarán el reino de los cielos". Qué disparate. Recuerda que Jesús dijo "Estos fariseos ven a Juan que casi ni come ni bebe y dicen que tiene demonio, ahora vengo yo que SOY CONOCIDO COMO GLOTON Y VINOSO y también dicen lo mismo".Jesús aquí explica que también era aficionado al chupe.   Para finalizar yo digo: "Bienaventurados los borrachos porque lo verán a Dios dos veces.

I had a Jewish father and a catholic mother but I never went to church or to the synagogue.    Many people think I am religious due to my lifestyle. I don't eat meat, drink, smoke or take drugs. I also dress modestly and never wear make up or jewellery. I am attracted to religion and enjoy reading about it but no one faith seems right for me. I believe in god as a force that permeates everything in the universe. I am 31 now and would like to find a faith where I can be apart of a community but I believe that many different paths can lead to God. So faiths that do not accept other faiths would not be right for me.      Do you have any advice?

Un muchacho en su adolescencia está lleno de preguntas, incógnitas, desencuentros, amores no correspondidos y un mundo por delante escalofriántemente desconocido.   Ismalía, sin embargo, era un joven rural.    ?Qué quería decir esto para todo adolescente de ciudad,moderno y desenfadado?, pues bien, Ismalía vivía en el campo, y aunque la distancia no era muy lejana a la creciente urbanidad, él no encontraba interés alguno en fundirse dentro de la jungla de cemento.    Simplemente disfrutaba de su entorno, la naturaleza, los animales, el olor a pan fresco, disfrutar de estar recostado en la verde grama contemplando el cielo infinito, diáfano, sentirse libre como el viento...   A pesar de las diferencias con otros chicos de su edad, Ismalía continuaba su vida, sana, inmaculada y quién se podría imaginar que en su cabeza llena de sue?os algo estaba rondando en su pecho, qué era angustia, desconocimiento, falta de amigos?   No!, Ismalía solo so?aba con ver el mar.........(continuará)

Imposibilitada de reacción ante cualquier estimulo exterior, tomó su vaso de whisky y bebiendo profundamente otro trago se dejó caer en su lecho...   La mirada perdida en una mancha de humedad que distorcionaba su techo, le ocasionaba una opresión en el pecho, llevándola a imaginarias situaciones de bienestar y prosperidad, a?oradas y lejanas de concretar ya que su persona estaba suspendida en el aire rodeada de tóxicos y alcohol, desenga?os y tristezas que no la conducían a ese rincón de luz que ella tanto deseaba...   Una vez más sumó otro vaso de whisky en su interior, pensando que el ardor de su garganta se apagaría fumando otro cigarrillo en aquella noche fría...   En esencia Laura estaba triste.........      Se animan a resolver el dilema de Laura?   Espero excelentes respuesta como siempre amigos!!!!

Esta es una creencia mormona que muestra que nuestro Se?or Jesucristo luego de resucitar y aparecérseles a sus respectivos discípulos vino a América y tuvo contacto y predicó a los indígenas, cosa que fricciona con lo que narra la Biblia, ya que esta dice que Jesús luego de resucitar y estar con sus discípulos ascendió a los cielos y se sentó a la diestra de Dios (Hechos 1: 10, 11; Hebreos 10:12)    Ahora bien, pregunto:   Si Cristo supuestamente vino a predicarle a los indígenas americanos, por qué cuando llegaron los conquistadores ingleses y espa?oles  estos indígenas no tenían la más pálida idea de quién era Jesús y hubo que evangelizarlos?   Creo que si Jesús realmente hubiera estado con ellos, aún muchos siglos anteriores, ellos algo deberían haber transmitido generacionalmente, sin embargo los conquistadores se encontraron con pueblos catalogados como "paganos" o adoradores de la naturaleza...   Qué mágica explicación tienen los mormones respecto a esta inquietud???

20070523190614AAVVrHE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Está cerrado el mundo para Dios?	Quien sigue los sencillos pasos que conducen de la relajación física a la mejor respiración, y después a una forma de amor más sensual –e incluso hasta llegar a sacra- que puramente sexual, conoce la grandiosidad de Dios, el Uno, en su ser y en su vida. ?Por qué esto es así? Sencillamente, porque lo único que hoy te impide conectar con el Todo creador y recreador que está por todas partes a tu alrededor es estar cerrado a él/Ella/Ello, al Dios de toda la humanidad, que es masculino, femenino y neutro como espacio donde se desarrolla, o donde se dramatiza la vida. Buda (Sidharta Gautama), Cristo, Mahoma, Khrisna (en el Baghavad Gita hindú): Todos estos personajes maravillosos de la historia humana expusieron que Dios está en todo, y que un cierto avance espiritual está en ti, amigo lector, en cada cual, en todos y cada uno de nosotros, en todas las personas, esto es, en tu propio interior (hallar la paz interior; el reino de los cielos está en ti; matar al infiel o a lo atrasado interno de cada cual, para crecer siempre hacia lo mejor de ti mismo, ésta es la verdadera Guerra Santa del Corán). Porque, en todas las religiones y creencias, desde la hinduista y sus diversas interpretaciones, pasando por la judía o la budista o la cristiana o la mahometana, se encuentra Dios en partes, como si hubiera querido manifestarse de formas diversas según cada territorio o zona del mundo. Reuniendo lo mejor de toda religión con Tradición existente sobre la faz del mundo (lo más inspirado de cada una de las mismas), encontramos la verdad de que Dios existe y, sobre todo, de que es perfectamente experimentable por quien esté dispuesto a esforzarse en dar un paso adelante en su evolución personal. Flexibilizar el cuerpo, aprender a relajarte respirando bien, saber meditar: estas tres acciones conducen a un abrir en ti una zona a través de la que Dios se te hará real, a través del despertar de tu alma, la cual anhela encontrarse con el Espíritu después de su largo peregrinar por este mundo. Vale la pena intentar integrar esas tres acciones en tu existencia cotidiana, las cuales, además, lejos de alejarte de tus tareas cotidianas, te comprometerán aún más con las mismas, pero, esta vez, con placer; pero, en esta ocasión, con regocijo por vivir, sólo y simplemente por el hecho de estar vivo en un contexto que en realidad es todo él/Ella/Ello, Dios, el Todo. No es lo mismo vivir sufriendo por negar en tu interior la realidad de un Dios que dé lógica y sentido a tu existencia, que ser, amar y trabajar sabiendo que tú lo experimentas en ti. Es vital, crucial, urgente, aprender a dar un paso más en tu evolución personal hacia lo Supramental anunciado por el gran sabio hindú Sri Aurobindo, y percibir así a Dios. Nosotros apostamos por las verdades simples y maravillosas que siempre escondieron las Iniciaciones al alma, atman en hindú, y lo hacemos de un modo que creemos moderno y asequible para todos. Lo hacemos porque creemos que las iniciaciones han de ser universalizadas de un modo que sea atractivo para las personas de todas partes; ésas han de ser, incluso, simplificadas, adecuadas de tal modo que puedan ser entendidas por cada ciudadano, por cada persona de este mundo. Sólo así pasaremos, esta vez voluntariamente, desde la conciencia desarrollada por autorrealización personal,  a otro estadio evolutivo de la humanidad.      Es éste el triste tiempo de la guerra en Irak y en Oriente Medio (Israel y palestinos), en la nueva era de la informática, tratándose, además, de guerras que puede prolongarse décadas y que podría desencadenar matanzas innombrables. Y, todo, en nombre de Dios. Pero estamos equivocándonos todos, porque Dios es paz, en efecto. Dios no puede estar del lado de ninguna de las partes que se enfrentan en una guerra. La guerra es un atavismo humano, algo que proviene y que se mantiene a partir de lo más animalesco (del hipocampo cerebral) y antiguo de nuestra especie. ?Estamos aún muy lejos, por tanto, de vivir en un mundo de armonía sustentada en el amor universal que sólo puede producirse en la plenitud de un contexto de paz? El libre albedrío humano es lo que nos conduce a las guerras. El terrorismo internacional surge de los fallos que el mundo occidental ha cometido con respecto a los mundos no desarrollados. ésta es la verdad. Estamos inmersos en un mundo adelantado que avanza, es cierto, pero a costa de los pueblos atrasados, de las culturas diferentes, del ecologismo nunca tenido en cuenta. Sólo cuando el avance del mundo sea totalmente global -de todos a la vez hacia un mundo unido-, podrá lograrse la paz de verdad. No una paz aparente, que apoya guerras aquí o allá, injusticias como las que padece el pueblo palestino, dilemas como el del pueblo judío, semidictaduras, empobrecimiento de campesinos, etcétera. Un gran acto de amor hacia Dios y la vida hubiera sido, en lo ideal, haber entendido la tragedia inmensa del 11 de septiembre de 2001 sobre las Torres Gemelas de Nuevas York y el Pentágono de Washington, como un aviso de una parte de la humanidad hacia la parte más acomodada y rica. Un aviso que, aparte de desatar la guerra inevitable por lo horrible del acto, nos hiciera ver y comprender que la humanidad no puede seguir así. No podemos seguir avanzando por un lado, mientras los demás se empobrecen, y sin explicar bien a la humanidad todo lo de bueno que, de verdad, conlleva potencialmente lo que es la globalización, una vez extendida por todas partes. Piénsese en todo ello.   Ricardo Daulah
20070527100957AAIcxpo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?...Qué más conoces tú sobre las Iniciaciones Sagradas Orientales más populares en la actualidad en Occidente?	Los secretos ya desvelados de las Iniciaciones Sagradas Orientales       Los Yogas son poderosos. Y el Tantra los contiene todos: el    Kundalini Yoga iniciático-esotérico, el físico/postural Hathayoga.    Leyendo, informándose, cada bravo/vero buscador del Espíritu, de la Fuente, halla el Yoga que le va, desde el Hathayoga al Tantra Yoga, pasando por el    Kundalini Yoga, etcétera (y llegando hasta el bellísimo y sutil como la    llama de una vela, Vyayam  www.viayam.org ) . Hay libros suficientes, ya, en    el mercado sobre los temas nombrados. Búsquense por el candidato o la    candidata.       La práctica de todos los yogas, y sobre todo del Tantra Yoga y del Kundalini    Yoga, conduce en muchas personas a experiencias nuevas (ya habló de todo esto y escribió mucho, de otras cosas, el gran Antonio Blay), que pueden ser    psíquicas, metafísicas o místicas directamente. El Kundalini Yoga en    concreto limpia de agregados indeseables el inconsciente y el subconsciente    y permite, o va permitiendo, que la energía vital se exprese o vaya    expresando de diferentes modos en cada practicante. El Kundalini Yoga es    poderoso hasta el extremo de que despierta a Shakti, la Energía, y según la    capacidad anímica de cada cual se desarrolla de una u otra forma a través de    los siete chakras de la columna hasta la coronilla. El Kundalini Yoga    despierta a Shakti y lo une a la Cueva de Brahman, en medio de la cabeza,    entre los dos hemisferios cerebrales, origen de la dualidad. Cuando Shiva    (lo masculino), en la Cueva de Brahma recibe a su Kali, a su Shakti (lo Femenino/femenino) a través de cualquier Yoga iniciático bien realizado y supervisado, el ser humano alcanza al Todo, al Dios y a la Diosa, al Gran Hermafrodita, a la    Fuente, etc. Decir que el Hathayoga, además de conducir al Conocimiento del    Ser en uno mismo, como el Kundalini Yoga, conduce a la salud física y a la    longevidad.
