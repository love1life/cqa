20090203051513AAYmTN3	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Back Yard Inspiration... Ideas please ?	I need some help making my back yard a bit more pleasant. It is a concrete yard with an outhouse close to the house. I will add some description and point out what I need help with.      1. The outhouse - has 2 doors and a window needs a lick of paint -What colours look nice?      2. To the Right of the Yard - Small Gravelled area in need of weeding. 6ft fence. What colour could I stain the fence with? What can I do with the gravelled bit.      Back is 6ft fence and wooden gate.   Centre of garden is concrete and paving slabs just needs a power wash      3. To the left - not too bad has a raised wall filled with soil and purple slate bits some plants and potted veg.   Brick wall half way up and picket fence on top - what colour would look nice to either compliment or match the outhouse doors?   (Next door has painted their half a horrible green which has ran down our side)      If anyone has any ideas please could you give me some inspiration. It just looks quite run down at the minute and I miss having a garden. Grassing and Decking unfortunately aren't options      Thanks Alot!

20090203050552AAUUBsI	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Hole in the ceiling - help!?	After a particularly heavy snow blizzard at 3.30pm yesterday, water started dripping through my ceiling.  By 11.30pm water was pouring through my ceiling and I was collecting it in buckets.  I sliced the plasterboard with a knife and after an initial deluge of water it started dripping.  This morning there are brown marks all over the ceiling and around the adjoining walls (in fact they're starting to feel a bit spongy...)      It's a rented house so my estate agents sent a builder round who said it was caused by a crack in the roof tile causing the melting snow to run through the ceiling.  He said that nothing can be done about it until the weather improves because it involves going out on the roof.      My question is, should I worry about the ceiling coming down and is it okay for me to sleep in the room if I put a bucket down to catch the drips?      Thank you!!

20090220090250AA9nod6	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	What is a good paint to use on windows so they don't stick?	I painted some windows at our cabin, and even though I kept moving the windows so they wouldn't get painted shut, the paint is still sticky months later and so the windows are hard to move. There was a problem with the doors sticking to the trim, as well, even though I let the doors dry like 2 weeks before I put them back up. I put furniture polish on them, and that helped a little (a suggestion from This Old House magazine, I believe). I think what I used was Dutch Boy Semigloss latex paint. I want to paint the windows at our home, but obviously I don't want that problem, what else can I do? Is there a certain kind of special paint that is less tacky when it dries? Should I be using oil base paint?   Thanks!      PS I asked this question before, but someone gave my only answer a thumbs down, and I don't know why.

20090220103734AAc5Hwx	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Fencing bill four months later?	My neighbour and I had the fence replaced that separates our houses back in October last year.      The fence guy (who was hired by me) replaced the fence at a cost of ￡600, but didn't put it in exactly the same places as the previous fence.    My neighbour claimed it was infringing his land by six inches (it was!) and could the fence guy come back and move it back six inches.      We hadn't paid at this point I might add.      I rang the fence guy and he ummmed and aaaah'd and said he'd come back and shift it begrudgingly.      He never came back!      In the mean time my neighbour got fed up and replaced the part of the fence that was on his land with  a new fence. (he removed the recently fitted fence and placed it (intact) in my garden.      In essence only half of the original fence remains, the other half is stored in my garden.      I was surprised today (after hearing nothing for four months) to receive a bill for the full amount to be paid with immediate effect from the fence guy who never came back.      Where do I stand with this?      Can I tell him I'm not paying as he didn't come back when asked?      Can he take the fence back?      What would you do?       I don't think I will get half of the fence fee now off my neighbour now that he has replaced half of the fence with his own (he paid for this himself).      Any ideas graciously received.      thanks

20090203075316AAYkWL7	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Basement subfloor questions?	A couple questions - building a subfloor - 2x3 sleepers; with 5/8 spruce 4x8 plywood floorboards. 1. gaps between adjacent floorboards - how can I fill these in? They're pretty minimal, but I would be putting carpet down later and want to ensure no problems. I'm trying one with some adhesive glue I have left over (I decided not to glue to floor down, just screw it in). But is there something else I should use? 2. Its a walkout basement, so I have sliding exit doors. I decided to tile next to these. I am not putting down any subfloor infront these doors - looking to tile directly onto the concrete,otherwise the floor would be higher than the bottom door frame & look odd. Is there any way to insulate this spot first, then tile over it? ie. 1" sleepers with foam insulation, Durock & then tile? Or should I just go directly onto the cement? Thanks.

Main bedroom: Consists of oak flooring, dark leather kingsize bed with large square stitched leather headboard and two dark rosewood chest of drawers. The bed with furniture takes up alot of the floor space.   Bedding, curtains/blinds need to be changed as well so I have basically a blank canvas.   I would like something dramatic instead of a white or cream but need help....can anybody suggest some good colour combinations?????

Sleeping with it last night, it didn't get that warm, even though I turned it on to the highest setting and left it on for over an hour before I climbed into bed. I've never owned an electric blanket before, so i was wondering how warm is it supposed to be?

20090410161407AA2kc7U	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Can my neighbour cut down a tree on MY property?	It's kind of close to his property and I suspect part of the root structure is on his property. He's threatening to cut it down. It's a really nice old oak tree and one of the reasons we really liked the property. If he goes ahead and cuts it down what are my legal options? He's been out to get me since I slept with his wife. Will the judge take this into consideration? He wouldn't give me a reason for his wanted to cut it down. He just stared at me when I asked him why.
