You will need to have good, creative writing skills, communication and people skills.  Best of luck!|`|AJB1QcHzaa	First thing you HAVE to KNOW is that Larry Bird is the GREATEST player that ever laced a pair of sneakers. Second thing is that the Boston Celtics are NOW, and ALWAYS will be the BEST DAMN team EVER!|`|cec4a3f7c2ce5d3dfbd588b08c6c0697aa	If you're going to be a journalist you have to be able to work well under pressure, be timely, and above all responsible.  You also need to be thorough, possess solid writing skills, and it helps if you learn quickly.  Last but not least you need a thick skin.  If you tend to take things personally or have trouble letting things go journalism may not be for you.  And don't go into television for the money.  You sound as if you really enjoy sports but make sure you love it enough to make a career out of it.  Chances are you'll be scraping by for awhile because news does not pay well, especially at first.<br>  <br>  When choosing a school I would look for an institution with a lot of internship opportunities.  Make sure there are working television stations around you if you’re going into broadcast so you can gain exposure to the environment early on.  I've never met a college graduate that was adequately prepared for a career in journalism.  Many schools use top of the line equipment that hasn't made it into some of the smaller stations yet.  They also have trouble simulating what a working newsroom is really like.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to find out more about the broadcast side of things there's three websites I highly recommend.  The first is www.tvspy.com .  That sight provides the latest gossip and news coming out of the television industry.  The second is www.tvjobs.com .  You do have to pay for a membership there but it will give you an idea of what jobs are available and how much they pay.  The third is www.broll.net .  It's a combination job posting/gossip site geared towards photographers but it often contains interesting information.  If you're looking for scholarship money I would also check out your state's broadcasting association.  They typically give away scholarships to broadcast journalism majors.  You can also check your local television station's websites they often offer scholarship money as well as contain job postings.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!
jcK6EXpiaa	"Forgive them father, they know not what they do"<br>   I know we as Muslims do not believe in the crucifixion, and  do not know for sure if these words were ever really uttered, but they do carry a powerful meaning. When I learned about this story in Bible School (when I was a little girl) I remember learning to have sympathy for the Jews who were persecuting Jesus, that he would have so much compassion for their ignorance, that he would pray for them, while they were nailing him to the cross...It is similar to the story of Muhammad, when he was badly injured after being driven out of a city where he had gone to preach, and the angel offered to destroy the town, but instead, Muhammad prayed for the forgiveness and good fortune of the townsfolk, especially their children.<br>  <br>   You have to apply these teachings to the ignorant ones who answered this question. Anybody who writes off the murder of a child as nothing more than a minor inconvenience, or makes a jest out of this brutality is unable of comprehending the mass of their words, otherwise they would not say such a thing. Nothing you or I say to them will make them see how disturbing their thought process is. THe only thing we can do is forgive them for their ignorance, and pray that God will forgive them as well. May their children never know the suffering that my people and your people have lived or died through.|`|VMDljEFuaa	Yes, but it's problematic killing people in a sovereign country without that country's permission.<br>  <br>  Yeah, what about the innocent people?

If there is a terrorist problem in that area, go after the terrorist. Not the people who live there. <br>  <br>  Imagine a terrorist hides out in your neighborhood and the government, in order to solve the problem, drops a bunch of bombs into that area killing your loved ones. It's just wrong and unjustified. <br>  <br>  The right way would be ground troops and or police saturating and patrolling the area, removing the culprits while at the same time educating people and children on human rights and respect for each other. <br>  <br>  The Pakistani government is to blame for their failure to control those parts and doing nothing about the encroachment of Islamic extremism.<br>  Pakistan is now in the unique position of having a foreign force clean up the mess it should have handled internally. So no sympathy for Pakistanis protesting these measures.|`|kZzyKnJsaa	Well the globalist bankers are trying to get a war going on in Pakistan, that's why the Mumbai shootings were staged, so they have to do something to get that war going. <br>  <br>  Personally I think that the US and Israel are the new Nazis, but israel moreso because they are controlling the US government through blackmail and coercion.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Considering it's the US Air Force that's running the program, I'm surprised more haven't died, more likely their own.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Who cares about the minimal Palestinians who die when tens of thousands are being Killed by the Muslims in Darfur?|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Moral of the story is don't live with a terrorist.
GDwMdfqjaa	A president depicted as an ape in a cartoon, especially an American president - Now there's something new for you!<br>  <br>  A picture is worth a thousand words, so I'll let the following link speak for itself:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=bush+ape&gbv=2" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a><br>  <br>  Obviously it wasn't racist but quite a standard cartoon, as the link above shows. If anything, the fact that the protestors immediately link an ape to Obama and his skin color, is the only racist thing I see in here. In my opinion, it doesn't even directly refer to Obama but to the fact that according to the cartoonist's view, the stimulus package is as if made by a monkey. The fact that it's up for interpretation shows that it's not racist unless you want it to be, which is obviously what the protestors, who are so keen on yelling "RACIST", wish to show there. Subconciously, the real issue at hand is that they don't like their Messiah president being criticized and will find a way to get back at the one who drew the cartoon. Sometimes it seems as if all that Obama is comes down to a skin color + presidential figure.|`|AA10831531	DUH it's racist.|`|wwYgR5EQaa	Yes, it was racist pure and simple.  It was also in very poor taste and so not funny.  This country has used the words monkey, ape, and porch monkey as derogatory and racist references to Black people for years.  Now that a monkey was used as a symbol in this cartoon some want to say that it wasn't racist. Some say that since Obama didn't write the bill then the cartoon wasn't about him at all, but ever since he announced this stimulus package the media has referred to it as Obama's stimulus package. It isn't a stretch for some to interpret the cartoon as a comparison to Pres Obama and a covert suggestion to do bodily harm to him because of the stimulus bill.  <br>  <br>  Saying that the cartoonist included a monkey in his cartoon because of the incident in CT is insulting.  That was a coincidence and it provided a very weak and bull ish interpretion.  What benefit was there in exploiting a tradegy?   <br>  <br>  Some people say that there have been cartoons depicting Bush as a monkey.  Honestly, I've never seen any of them before because I'm not into stuff like that.  Shame on anyone that has seen them and not spoken out against it.  Being derogatory is not humerous no matter who its done to or why.  I don't understand why people get upset with people of color when they speak out about stuff like this when its done to one of their own.  The only way this type of nonesense is going to stop is when everyone speaks on it and says its wrong and we won't accept it.  Yes, there is freedom of speech and its guaranteed in the First Amendment.  Just because someone has the right to say it doesn't mean that anyone wants to hear it.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Oh hell get a life... picking and piking at every damn word that comes on here. Racist has no place on this board because the biggest majority that answer questions are honest people who have the right to open their mouths, and in our life today , and in this Country of ours UK  we are getting to the point that if we say anything , choose what it is we are all racists. Well thats tough, so if you do not like what we say , well I am sorry about that but in all fairness if we visit any of your Countries we abide by your beliefs and way of living, and do not try to do anything else, so please confide yourself to our way of life and then we all get on.

Most people don't know about the Stamford incident, because it wasn't on the news everywhere. Not that I agree, but other people mention it was just meant to mean that a monkey could have written the bill better. I personally don't feel it was racist, but people made it seem that way. All the commotion is really unnecessary. I think the cartoon was offending to supporters of our government.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Funny and true!!|`|gWX21Jtwaa	at one time black men were called apes so I would say yeas it is racist.|`|JSjBecVHaa	No, I don't think it was racist.

ai4lrclMaa	I had a very instructive email from a Republican on that one. The man appears in black face on his avatar and is called I Hate Welfare Bums. He says on post that neither he nor the cartoon are racist....and that those who complain are just stifling the freedom of speech. In his email to me, where I questioned the reason fir the black face make up was quite different in tone. Abusive, profane and overtly racist..he called me a Kangaroo *******, referred to Obama's victory as "The night that N (but he used the word) won.... and told me to stop maligning the master race.<br>  <br>  I emailed back to thank him...for having confirmed everything I had ever suspected about the Republican Party and its stalwarts.And also to point out that the race war had been fought in the US last November....and that The Klan would appear to have lost. I told him that he was feeling impotent and angry because it had come to his attention that no black person would ever again doubt that effort and intellect would lead them to the top of society, despite the barriers placed in front of them...and that many more people of colour were now destined to ascend to powerful positions within society. That his children would have black employers, that he would see many more African Americans in positions of authority over him. That he would be more and more reliant upon the largess of people like Obama for his livelihood.<br>  <br>  Strangely, have not heard from him since.|`|kJM65nXJaa	I agree , that they are overplaying their hand.

He is not even going to be being sanctioned by the US Olympic Committee (because it did not occur while games were happening and pot is not a "performance enhancing" drug like steroids).    This isn't all that different from having a few too many alcoholic drinks. As long as he steers clear of this behavior in the future, I don't think it will hurt him that much.    (Why in the world he thought this wouldn't rear its head is beyond me. When you are as well-known as he is, you should only smoke pot with your closest friends on the planet - and in a more private setting!)|`|UXc6lMZBaa	Probably. Who cares? It's Micheal Phelps.

I don't agree with legalizing drugs simply because what message does it sent to our youth. What morals does it show. Do what you want when you want.     Punish him like anyone else would be. Just because he is a joc doesn't mean he deserves special privelidges. He is in the public eye and should be setting an example. Some example. Looser.

Keep in mind that these are immoral, depraved men and they're power mad. They love money because it gives them POWER.     If you want a better understanding as to why this is happening, do a bit of research on the Illuminati elite aristocracy and how they operate as a shadow government, what their goals are, etc. I guarantee you will begin to understand why this excessive EVIL GREED is taking place in our world nowadays.|`|7IogJOgBaa	I couldn't agree more, its extremely wasteful.

K2h6M1xqaa	Broadcasting on TV takes lots of money, which means that content is geared towards capturing viewers so as to keep ad revenues high.  The easiest, dirtiest way to do this is to create emotional controversy, to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  This means sound-bites rather than thoughtful dialogue, and stupid stories (octuplets), and the like.<br>  <br>  Websites, by comparison are far less expensive to manage, and content is not limited by fixed time parameters.  You can post in-depth articles and it costs the same as a 10 line factoid.  Older articles don't vanish, and you are easily in a position at your keyboard to cross reference a fact you are given so that you can determine its validity.<br>  <br>  As well, because TV reaches more people, there is more incentive placed on sculpting the news with propaganda.  Getting the truth from a TV set is far less likely than if you were to search around and read half a dozen websites on a given topic.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|2QxBi8YHaa	Simple.

lEX3CjWlaa	A K9 could probably not handle that chimp. Maybe if it was not in an agitated state it would tend to flee from a K9 unless it was backed into a wall and had to defend itself. But by all accounts this particular chimp was highly agitated and aggressive. So it probably would have fought with the K9 and killed it.<br>  <br>  For an interesting article on the strength and aggressiveness of chimpanzee's check out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=why-would-a-chimpanzee-at&sc=DD_20090219" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=why-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this Helps|`|GDwMdfqjaa	Highly unlikely.<br>  <br>  Although chimpanzees are known for their intelligence and human-like behavior - Chimpanzees are extremely dangerous if they want to be. They have a strong bite and their upper body strength is estimated to be between 5 to 10 times the strength of a human.<br>  <br>  Just ask St. James Davis, who was attacked by 2 chimps and within several minutes, they had bitten off and/or ripped all of his fingers, his nose, testicles, foot, and parts of his legs and buttocks. As well as mauling most of his face. Google the name for the news articles about it. I also recall reading a story about a chimp who attacked a vehicle and broke through its rear glass like it was a plastic bag, after which point he killed one of the passengers.<br>  <br>  Some humans can manage to take down a German shephard, so a chimp will do it easily. Besides the strong bite, relatively long fangs and a lot more strength than humans, chimps are also faster and are more acrobatic, giving them further advantage. In most cases, a chimp would escape a dog, but when feeling territorial and aggressive, a chimp could easily take down a dog. Still, you have to wonder how he'd do against heavier dogs with a stronger bite like a Pitbull, a Doberman or similar races.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	the chimp would have attacked the dog and probably killed it.the only way it might have been effective is with barking startling the chimp, but k9 officers are usually trained to be fairly quiet.full grown chimps are far stronger than any large breed dog i've ever heard of.so i don't think it would have helped|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	I think a dog would have been ripped apart.<br>  <br>  About the only thing to take down a monkey is a tiger.<br>  And they aren't real reliable either as pets.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	A dog would have been killed|`|LWzrCu5caa	No.<br>  <br>  A chimp is both stronger and smarter than a dog.

I am personally quite happy with the existing digital tech and I find it is of superb quality anyway. Owning HD though doesn't just stop there, you then have to subscribe FOREVER with monthly subscriptions, then they've gotcha!<br>  <br>  I wonder (slightly off topic soz) -  if people noticed when they all bought wide screen tellies that they lost some of the picture too - no matter how you zoom the pic or aspect ratio it.

It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	No.<br>  Don't think so.<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Time after time"<br>  Luke 22.3-6<br>  John 8.44<br>  Luke 4.4-7<br>  Luke 3.7-9<br>  Exodus 1.5<br>  Luke 16.13<br>  Matt 23.27<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  Matt 27. 29,37<br>  Matt 7.15-27<br>  Revelation 16.14<br>  Leviticus 26.1<br>  Luke 21.8-10<br>  Luke 21.22-24<br>  Luke 9.27<br>  Luke 20.5<br>  Luke 11.46-52<br>  Exodus 20.1-7<br>  Luke 10.24<br>  Luke 19.9-10<br>  Luke 24.44-45,47-48<br>  John 7.19<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|Fb519XJgaa	For the last 60 years, the Palestinian Refugees are living in a United Nation Refugee Camps waiting for UN to implement the UN Security Council resolutions.

Enjoy. Your new bloke sounds lovely and insightful into a woman's needs.  A facial can be very relaxing and you will feel pampered afterward.  What a kind gift.<br>  <br>  And let him worry about the bill. Don't mention the credit crunch. He knows his own financial priorities and it could slightly ruin it for him.

We have no business there.  The oil we import for ourselves is mostly from the Western Hemisphere.  As an American taxpayer, I don't want my taxes going toward a permanent military base in the Middle East.  Nor do I want it to contribute to hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths.  I'd rather have us not be in Iraq and invest money in our own country (i.e. education, the economy) than someone else's.

Lx6TXgHKaa	1. What happens when they stop funding the US?<br>  <br>  They are not going to do any of that. Their fortunes are tied down to US Economy. If US Economy goes down the drain they too will suffer. All of them want US Economy to be on rails at the earliest because they too are feeling the heat.<br>  <br>  2. What happens when we have to pay them back?<br>  <br>  You will always pay them, you cannot default. US has paid back in the past for the bonds it has issued and it keeps paying. This is an ongoing process.<br>  <br>  3. What happens when we have to raise interest rates on the Treasury Bonds to satisfy their worries about us paying them back in full value?<br>  <br>  That's a hypothetical question. The bonds previously issued and bought by them are at a fixed interest rate and the same rates are going to apply on them. They bought those bonds because they had trust that America will pay back.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think I answered the three questions that you raised. And don't call this "foreign countries' generosity", because the interests of all the countries are interlinked. If some of them have have given you money in this difficult time, it's because of the reason that they have amassed a huge forex reserve by exporting to US. What would have happened if US did not buy from them, and what would happen if US stops buying from them in future.<br>  <br>  International Economic System is a complex one. Everything is so interrelated.|`|4TT8lSgwaa	As long US treats China as an equal partner not an enemy, things will be going fine for the next 5 to 10 years.<br>  It was not China or any other nations that pushed US into its historically deepest depression. It is our government's bad spending habits and Americans'abusive use of credit. Not untill Uncle Sam balances its budget, pays back all the debt, not untill Americans pay back all their credit card debts, car loans, student loans, equity loans, ...  (All these will not happen for a few generations) US is to continue living on borrowing money from foreign nations with no way out. Another words, this nation is doomed. Mr. Obama has a lot to learn how to deal with his Chinese counterpart.

Many children in poor countries were forced (indirectly or directly) to work because of money.

In some rarer cases, the child labor can also be forced labor, mostly in war zones or troubled areas.|`|AA11091619	Transient sexual predators who work in professional jobs.
