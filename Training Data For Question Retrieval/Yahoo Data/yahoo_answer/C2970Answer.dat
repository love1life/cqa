AA10755943	Buildings do not create any greenhouse gases on their own.  It is combustion, respiration and other chemical reactions that release water vapor and other gases.  A building is just a chunk of steel, glass and concrete.<br>  <br>  The OCEANS are the greatest source of greenhouse gases on our planet. The primary greenhouse gas in our atmosphere is water vapor which evaporates off the oceans in enormous quantities, bringing heat energy into the atmosphere.  <br>  <br>  CO2 accounts for less than 5% of the atmosphere's heat retention capability and nearly all CO2 comes from natural sources.  Human contribution, and cows' is insignificant.<br>  <br>  One good volcanic eruption produces more CO2 than the entire history of human industry.  And that still is insignificant compared to the heat retention of water vapor.<br>  <br>  Hey, why don't folks talk more about this particular volcano...?<br>  <br>  <br>  Arctic volcano released enough heat energy in one explosion (out of many) to melt ice cap area size of Massachusetts<br>  <a href="http://www.bobkrumm.com/blog/?p=1927" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobkrumm.com/blog/?p=1927</a><br>  <br>  Arctic ocean volcano blew its top in 1999 – even under pressure <br>  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826625.800-arctic-ocean-volcano-blew-its-top--even-under-pressure.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19...</a>|`|zFsTSrOcaa	First of all, the statement makes no sense, saying that both buildings and cows are the "greatest source of greenhouse gases."

Bqug7ETmaa	Clean or replace air filters on your air conditioning unit at least once a month. If you have central air conditioning, do not close vents in unused rooms. Lower the thermostat on your water heater to 120. <br>  Wrap your water heater in an insulated blanket. Turn down or shut off your water heater when you will be away for extended periods. Turn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time.

uFQFRdczaa	If you're talking about cleaning the outside of the engine, it'll probably work ok, just avoid getting any in your electrical connections and make sure you properly dispose of any runoff lest the EPA come knocking.  It probably works almost as well as kerosene, but is more environmentally troublesome than Simple Green or other degreasers.  <br>  <br>  If you're talking about cleaning the inside of the engine, like as a carb cleaner, that's also unlikely to cause any serious damage.  One thing to bear in mind is diesel won't evaporate quickly the way gas does.  It might sit there for days, even weeks.  If you go to start the engine with diesel in the intake, it'll smoke quite a bit.  You run a risk of gumming up the spark plugs and fouling the catalytic converter or O2 sensor.  But diesel in a gas car is not as bad as gas in a diesel car--it just has really low octane (may cause some preignition and dieseling) and it possibly won't start again until you replace the sparks.<br>  <br>  Really, if you want to clean the inside of your engine--the intake, combustion chambers, etc. you're better off with an acetone-based carb spray, or Sea Foam.  To clean out the crankcase, you can toss in a quart of ATF a week or so before your oil change--it works well and it's more gentle than a 5-minute motor flush.|`|0d78403582fb776161f7bfecfda2df86aa	You might destroy your cylinders in the process|`|6VYzHD51aa	I wouldn't do it .

The concern here is that it's changing faster than it ever has before.  It's affecting ecosystems all over the world.  Check out coral bleaching- that's a good example.  Many species are very sensitive to any type of climate change, and when they shift, the entire food web changes.  <br>    Entire plant communities have been moving steadily northward and up mountainsides in the last few decades, following the receding cold.  <br>     Honestly, I don't think there has been all that much talk about global climate change in the news.  You hear it mentioned now and then, but not steadily.  They certainly are not "cramming it down our throats." <br>    I've researched this topic thoroughly, and all the evidence I've found says that global climate change (not global warming, that term is incorrect) does exist and it is strongly enhanced by people's actions, mainly industry.<br>    As for scare tactics, perhaps that's what is needed to get people up off their lazy butts and get them to appreciate all the environmental goods and services we take for granted  (to be nicer to the Earth, as you say).<br>  Check these web sites out:<br>  <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/global_issues/coral_reefs/990305_coralreef_rpt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/www/global/global_i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/climate/primer/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exploratorium.edu/climate/pri...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mri.scnatweb.ch/media/webcasts/climate-change-impacts-16-november-2007-berne-switzerland.html" rel="nofollow">http://mri.scnatweb.ch/media/webcasts/cl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://weathereye.kgan.com/expert/warming/explain.html" rel="nofollow">http://weathereye.kgan.com/expert/warmin...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-earth/glob-warm.html" rel="nofollow">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...</a><br>  <br>  I would point out two things- scientists who do not believe global climate change exists are not only in the minority, they are exceedingly rare.

Also they last 10 times longer (unless they're cheap junk from a certain Asian country famous for junk that doesn't work.) <br>  <br>  Let's tally up the costs of 10,000 hours of each kind of bulb. <br>  Standard 60 watt lightbulb.<br>  Cost 50 cents last 750 hours. Need 14 of them so $7.00<br>  Cost to run 10,000 hours = 600 kwh = $66.00<br>  Cost to change 13 times (in your time/effort) = $1 per so $13. <br>  Total cost $86.00<br>  <br>  11 watt (60 watt equivalent) CFL.  <br>  Cost $6.00 lasts 10,000 hours.   = $6.00<br>  Cost to run 10,000 hours = 110 kwh = $12.10<br>  Cost to change once = $1.00 <br>  Total cost $19.10 <br>  <br>  So that 50 cent bulb may be more expensive than you think.<br>  <br>  310S raises an interesting point, but it swings both ways.  First, electric heat is more expensive than gas/oil heat, so waste heat from lightbulbs is an expensive way to heat.  Second, in the summer, all that waste heat makes your air conditioner work harder, which means you are paying twice: First to make the heat, and second to get rid of the heat.|`|6lk6TYohaa	I'm not sure why energy bulbs cost so more but i think its because of the way they are made. I recycle paper, plastic, glass, aluminum, scrap metal, use energy bulbs throughout my house.|`|5TKEtXERaa	Wolf has hit the nail on the head when you purchase a car for $100 dollars instead of getting a reliable used one for $5000 or a new one for $15000 and it breaks down 5 times in the first month and costs you $4000 it is no longer a $100 car. You have to factor in the lifecycle cost and when you do this the incandescent bulb is THE most expensive bulb there is.<br>  <br>  As for the heat, incandescents lose over 80% of the energy they use to heat not light so yes they are little inefficient heaters. In the summer that is horrible, but even in the winter the heat that 5 100 watt lightbulbs give off while consuming 500 watts is no where near what even a bad 500 watt heater would give off and you don't have to take off the lampshade and huddle around the bulb to get warm.|`|QGrnEIETaa	Light saving bulbs cost so much because they are harder to make. The shape of the bulbs, the gases in the bulbs, and the materials that make up the shape of the bulb are costly. The regular light bulbs are easier to make. You can take shorter showers, turn off the faucet when you are brushing your teeth and washing your hands, you can recycle paper and plastics, and you could give old clothes to a charity or cut them up and use them as rags.|`|9f1815216915b904efd9e933b1a5b03aaa	I live in Canada and there was a study done not to long ago. When you switch from normal bulbs to energy saving bulbs the new bulbs don't generate as much heat as the old ones. In order to make up for the heat loss the furness has to run more and therefore use more fuel so the energy savings from the new bulbs is offset by the higher fuel bill and   higher carbon emissions.
6LdCn0YPaa	because people don't want the government controlling everything ... that would make the government communist ... all the government can do is influence us with advertisements|`|pAVfFAe2aa	We don't need government to tell us what to do.<br>  <br>  Let the market decide.  Our company, Beaulieu Commerical, in Adairsville, GA buy plastic bottles from over 9,400 municipalities, in effect, funding curb side recycling.  Last year, we recycled over 1.2B bottles or about 60,000,000 pounds of it.<br>  <br>  We make a carpet tile that has awesome performance characteristics  - stronger and lighter than conventional carpet tile.  And it is 100% recyclable.  There is a HUGE capitalistic opportunity to tap into consumer waste for great products....it's coming!|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Actually, some governments do.  But there are a couple of reasons not to.  For one, recycling is still somewhat controversial.  <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/38899" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/38899</a><br>  <br>  For a nasty, entertaining and dead wrong view of the opposition, search Youtube for "penn and teller recycling".  <br>  <br>  For another, it can actually be easier to do it at the landfill.  For instance Irvine CA had a recycling program where they said "Just group everything, and throw it in the trash." Then they paid workers to sort through the trash stream all day and pick out the recyclables.   Hey, what a great career! *cough* <br>  <br>  I've also heard of automatic machinery that can separate recyclables out of waste. I fully expect to see them digging up old landfills and using machines to prospect recyclables out of them.|`|cwAEsD1Naa	Implementing a national recycling program would be very expensive and therefore not favorable to pretty much everyone who doesn't want to pay more money.. I think recycling needs to become more efficient (i.e. cheaper) and simply more convenient to people.  As sad as it sounds no one wants to recycle if it isn't easy for them.  Until technology is better we will continue to produce millions of tons of waste and bury it in a hole and pretend it doesn't exist.|`|QGrnEIETaa	Because the government is corrupt and they know they can't make people do that, for some particular reason....|`|PtSeJXnEaa	because that would be stupid.<br>  they dont have the authority to MAKE you recycle.|`|g13GSfaiaa	Actually, it is irresponsible of governments not to make recycling possible (wherever it is the most environmentally friendly option), let alone mandatory.  Where there are available markets (which are also sustainable) for any materials, their diversion to recycling should be made possible.  Ideally this should all happen within a "local" environment to reduce the overall carbon footprint, which could otherwise outweigh any benefits.  <br>   <br>  Recycling is not the only option either.  Some waste is better burned (cleanly) as fuel, or composted, or repaired/refurbished for example.   Looking at the bigger picture, there ought to be systems in place to deal with ALL waste in some constructive way. It may not be long before waste resources will be considered to be as important as natural resources for us to maintain reasonably comfortable lives.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, though, the answer is to address the whole problem of waste, beginning with finding ways to reduce the amounts we produce.  Governments should be addressing the whole issue of waste, and planning for and enabling a more sustainable future for future citizens.  That is their job.  They should not have to make recycling mandatory; that is our job as responsible human beings.
QGrnEIETaa	Trees rock! I am officially a tree hugger. They like photosynthesize themselves. Isn't that cool? :)|`|YPtNr2O6aa	how would you do a tree?
Cye1NNWxaa	life is created by nature just like food is made in a pressure cooker<br>  in that nature provides the raw material ie plant seeds then the sun/water/soil get together to complete the growing process
QGrnEIETaa	Remember the three R's :<br>  REDUCE: stop drinking water from plastic water bottles<br>  REUSE: give away old clothes or cut them up to use them as rags<br>  RECYCLE: use both sides of each paper when you are writing stuff<br>  <br>   you could get other ideas from wikipedia or just look it up in google.<br>  <br>  :D|`|5TKEtXERaa	Anything that REDUCES but here is my newest attempt<br>  <br>     Use rainbarrels for landscaping which will aid in controling storm water runoff and decrease the need for water treatment facilities (which cost energy/money to run)<br>  <br>     If you really want to get creative with it, use rain water to flush your toilet with instead of drinking water. Plans are online and not that hard to do.|`|mFmnfOe0aa	The most creative thing I can think of is to stop using more than we need. We have sooo many products in our household that we don't even have room for. Do we really need all of the things that we buy? Do we really need anything else other than water and food? With industrialization comes more and more man made objects... but when  you think about it, we dont need them for survival. I don't have a dust pan. I take the pages of a newspaper or that silly phone book that I have no idea why I have and never use, and I wet the edges and sweep the garbage onto that, and throw it away. I didn't need to buy a man made dust pan, instead I reused something that I already had. Reusing is really a great way to be green, and also to save money, because when you think about it, you really don't need all of these things in the stores that they are trying to sell to us. Be creative with reusing things in your house that you don't use. Instead of buying sandwich bags for lunch, I use a bread bag that has no more bread in it. its a plastic bag, isn't it? why would i throw away that bag and then buy more? its ridiculous. be creative and think away from society!

WCu2skI5aa	Interesting facts on solar energy: <br>  <br>  It takes 8 minutes 17 seconds for light to travel from the sun’s surface to earth. <br>    <br>  In 5 billion years the sun will run out of fuel. <br>  <br>  A Swiss scientist, Horace de Saussure invented the world’s first solar energy collector, or ‘hot box’ in 1767. <br>  <br>  In the 1830s British astronomer John Herschel used a solar energy collector box to cook food during an expedition to Africa. <br>  <br>  Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his experiments with solar energy and photovoltaics. <br>  <br>  Enough sunlight falls on the earth every minute to meet the world’s energy demands for an entire year. <br>  <br>  If we covered a small fraction of the Sahara desert with photovoltaic cells, we could generate all the world’s electricity requirements. <br>  <br>  All TV and communications satellites are powered by solar energy using photovoltaic cells. <br>  <br>  Here's a few more facts:<br>  <br>  Basic facts about solar energy:<br>  ?Solar energy reaches earth from the sun through its rays.<br>  ?Energy from the sun comes in the forms of light and heat.<br>  ?The term solar energy refers to the use of energy from the sun.<br>  ?Solar power more specifically refers to the utilization of the sun’s energy for electricity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Facts about solar energy usage:<br>  ?Solar thermal technology makes use of the sun’s heat.<br>  ?Photovoltaic (PV) technologies convert light from the sun into electricity.<br>  ?Solar thermal technology can also create electricity by creating steam to power generators.<br>  ?The use of solar energy does not cause greenhouse gas emissions. <br>  <br>  Other interesting facts about solar energy:<br>  ?In 1990, a solar powered airplane flew across the U.S.<br>  ?During the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci already had plans for solar concentrators in his notebooks.<br>  ?In just one hour, the earth receives more energy from the sun than the entire world uses during a whole year.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a bit!!!  <br>  Good Luck!|`|QGrnEIETaa	It uses the sun to make energy, the solar panel was made in the USA, solar panels are made with glass lenses that capture the sun's energy and make it into electricity, (just look up solar panels)
C5PPgdRDaa	ENERGY<br>  1. thermal energy- we get by burning coal<br>  2. hydro power- by water, through dams.<br>  3. nuclear energy- through fission of uranium.<br>  here if you will save energy at your home or any where than there will be less extraction of coal from earth, less mining and less possibility of ecological imbalance.<br>  when dams are created a lot space gets submerged in water and loss to flora and fauna too occurs. so if save energy,there will be less dams.<br>  waste from nuclear plants are radio active they degrade the land where there are dumb and cause harm to humans too.<br>  <br>  WATER<br>  NO WATER, MEANS NO TREES AND NO TREES MEANS, NO RAINS, NO RAINS MEANS DROUGHTS AND THIS MEANS LOSS OF LIFE OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS RESULTING IN "ECOLOGICAL IMBALANCE".|`|cCnvBwz2aa	Autumn is right but i want to add up <br>  <br>  bu saving energy we can decrease the emission of green house gases in the atmosphere<br>  as these are generated in thermal power plant<br>  <br>  our underground water reserves are decreasing <br>  the used water is not good for environment contain heavy metals cause of the detergents and also pathogenic bacteria dangerous for both marine and humans <br>  so we need to filter it which is also expensive so save water <br>  and save energy for the future
qcCy3MOZaa	Cute idea! Maybe I should try it sometime.<br>  Listen to Person #3... They are right, looks like they did their research =]<br>  <br>  Do you mean your lightbulbs are frosted rather than clear? That's to diffuse the light better, its pigmented glass. It may not look the same, but it should be safe to use. If it is a layer that can be scraped off, like paint or something, then I wouldn't... but most frosted light bulbs are not like that....
pYJ0I0cXaa	I am thinking you mean Altitude (not attitude)--meaning height above sea level ? If so, the higher you go, the thinner the air, and the colder the temperature.|`|atJxwFssaa	As you go higher, both temperature and pressure drop.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	Attitude or altitude? If you are are talking about altitude go on yahoo and search  altitude/weatherchange.
