If the house is older than 20 years, I might not get too worked up, if older than 50 years, probably wouldn't even get a rise out of me.  I have a few of these in my house of bricks, I patched the mortar and watched them, and now check once a year to see if there is any movement, none have opened up again, and there was nothing on the other side of the cracks.  So I have concluded, they are settlement cracks, and they just happen to a home.  BUT, if they keep happening, then it is MOVEMENT of the foundation, home or soil, and that would need more work and more funds.  But even so, may not be a major financial disaster.  check it out, have some professionals come and take a look and see if they have any valuable imput.  Might need addressing, or a simple wait and see.|`|AdqL5jh3aa	i THINK propreno is probably correct about the block.

Many commercial air and carpet deodorizer work to mask odors by deadening the nerves associated with your sense of smell. To freshen carpets, opt for this natural formula instead.<br>  1 cup baking soda<br>  1/2 cup lavender flowers<br>  <br>  1. Crush the lavender flowers to release their scent.<br>  2. Mix well with the baking soda and sprinkle liberally on carpets.<br>  3. After 30 minutes, vacuum carpets.<br>  And here is a great Air-freshener spray<br>  You can find most of the ingredients at a health-food or aromatherapy store.<br>  1/4 cup isopropyl alcohol<br>  25 drops bergamot essential oil<br>  8 drops clove essential oil<br>  5 drops lemon essential oil<br>  1 cup distilled water<br>  <br>  1. In a spray bottle, combine the alcohol and the essential oils and shake well to disperse the oils. Add the distilled water and shake for a minute or two more to thoroughly blend all the ingredients.<br>  2. Let sit for at least a few days before using, to allow the fragrance to mature.

zKn9IXygaa	STEP 1-PREPARE THE GARDEN FOR PLANTING<br>   Locate vegetable gardens away from manure piles, well caps, garbage cans, septic systems and<br>  areas where wildlife, farm animals, or the family pets roam.<br>   Use compost safely. Compost is the natural breakdown product of leaves, stems, manures and other<br>  organic materials-and also a source of pathogens. To be safe for gardening, your compost must<br>  reach a temperature of at least 130°F. Check the temperature with a compost thermometer. Do not<br>  use any animal waste, including pet waste, meat scraps or dairy product waste into your compost bin.<br>  STEP 2- MAINTAIN THE GARDEN<br>  Water source: Be familiar with the quality and safety of the water source(s) you use in your<br>  garden.<br>   If you get your water from a municipal or public water system, you can be sure that it is safe and<br>  potable (drinkable).<br>   Surface water (lakes, ponds, rivers and streams) can be polluted by human sewage or animal waste,<br>  fertilizers and pesticides from lawns and farm fields, or chemicals from industry.<br>   Ground water (which is the source for well water) is less likely to have microbial contaminants than<br>  surface water. If a well is your water source, you need to take a little more care to be sure that it is<br>  providing you with safe, clean water.<br>   Conduct a standard water test at least once a year to determine if your well water meets the standards<br>  of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<br>  Animals: Animal waste can be a source of bacteria, parasites and viruses.<br>   During the gardening season, keep cats, dogs and other pets out of the garden.<br>   Curtail nesting and hiding places for rats and mice by minimizing vegetation at the edges of your fruit<br>  and vegetable garden.<br>   Do not feed wild animals, even birds, near your garden. Fencing or noise deterrents may help<br>  discourages other wild animals.<br>  STEP 3-HARVEST GARDEN PRODUCE<br>   Use clean, food-grade containers. Food-grade containers are made from materials designed<br>  specifically to safely hold food. Garbage bags, trash cans, and any containers that originally held<br>  chemicals such as household cleaners or pesticides are not food-grade.<br>   Use clean gloves (that have not been used to stir compost or pull weeds) or clean hands when picking<br>  produce.<br>   Brush, shake or rub off any excess garden soil or debris before bringing produce into the kitchen.<br>  STEP 4-STORE GARDEN PRODUCE<br>   If you choose to wash fruits and vegetables before storing, be sure to dry them thoroughly with a<br>  clean paper towel. (NEVER wash berries until you are ready to eat them.)<br>   If you choose to store without washing, shake, rub or brush off any garden dirt with a paper towel or<br>  soft brush while still outside. Store unwashed produce in plastic bags or containers.<br>   Keep fruit and vegetable bins clean.<br>   When washing produce fresh from the warm outdoors, the rinse water should not be more than 10<br>  degrees colder than the produce. If you are washing refrigerated produce, use cold water.<br>   Fruits and vegetables needing refrigeration can be stored at 40° F or less.<br>   Fruits and vegetables stored at room temperature (onions, potatoes, tomatoes) should be in a cool,<br>  dry, pest-free, well-ventilated area separate from household chemicals.<br>  STEP 5-PREPARING AND SERVING FRESH GARDEN PRODUCE<br>  More often than not, we eat fresh fruit and vegetables raw so we cannot rely on the heat of cooking to<br>  destroy pathogens that might be on our lettuce or tomatoes, it is important to prepare raw produce with<br>  food safety in mind.<br>   Always wash your hands first.<br>   Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under cool, running, clean water even if you do not plan to eat the<br>  skin or rind.<br>   Never use soap, detergent, or bleach solution to wash fresh fruits or vegetables. These solutions can<br>  affect flavor and may not be safe to ingest.<br>   Avoid cross-contamination when preparing fruits and vegetables. Cross-contamination occurs when a<br>  clean work surface such as a cutting board or utensil (paring knife) or uncontaminated food is<br>  contaminated by dirty work surfaces, utensils, hands or food. Be sure to wash your hands (as well as<br>  the knife and cutting surface) before preparing any ready-to-eat foods such as salad, fresh fruit or a<br>  sandwich.<br>   If you have leftover produce that has been cut, sliced, or cooked, store it in clean, air-tight containers<br>  in the refrigerator at 40°F or less.|`|Tt2DAUxxaa	Spray-N-Grow has some great articles on their website for the beginning gardener:  <a href="http://www.spray-n-growgardening.com/gardening.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.spray-n-growgardening.com/gar...</a>|`|AA10648704	If you're planting in the ground, rather than planters, a good way to plant tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and even zucchini is to take black plastic, spread it out and anchor it down, cut X's in it about every 2-3 feet, and plant them in the X's (anchor the X's down too, so the plastic doesn't cover the plants).  Pour about a cup of  Miracle Gro for Tomatoes in the holes for the tomatoes, peppers and eggplant (they're all in the nightshade family, so it will work on all 3).  Use regular Miracle Gro for everything else.  The black plastic not only keeps out weeds, but it also holds in heat and moisture.  We used it last year and never had to water, even during the drought.  You can plant many different vegetables in pots, but make sure the pots are big enough, that there are holes in the bottom, and a few inches of rocks or broken up clay pots under the soil to allow good drainage.

And you will have to provide proper lighting for your indoor tree.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	If you are going to order it from the internet it will be a bit pricey. Usually around 45 - 75 dollars.  I would look at your local Home Depot or Lowes stores, they usually have a good selection of fruit and citrus trees.  <br>  <br>  Another place to look is Ebay. Keep in mind due to regulations some states do not allow citrus to be brought in from other states. States such as Texas is one of them because these states produce citrus as a cash crop and there are many types of diseases floating around which they try to keep out of their stock of trees. <br>  <br>  Mandarin trees are fun to grow. If you purchase one from Ebay or any online dealer find out if it was produced by grafting on a rootstock or by seed.  If by seed it could take 5 to 7 years before it will produce mandrin oranges and it may have to grow to a certain height . <br>  <br>  If it was produced by grafting then you need to be aware of the type of root stock it was grafted to.  When grafted these trees can be kept small and will start producing earlier than seed because they think they are already old enough. It doesn't hurt the tree it just produces an older tree faster.   Also knowing the root stock will help you if you decide to plant it. depending on the type of tree used  as root stock will determine how well the tree does in your soil type.

Hope this helps.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Apple, Pear, Cherry...someone said orange, but it is too cold for that...sometimes you can grow peach trees, but depends on exactly where you are located.<br>  But if you grow pears then you need more than one tree to produce fruit.|`|SDGeudRhaa	Apples, pear, plum all work here in Mich. Pear and apple trees need to be prunned on a couple year cycle, I'm not sure about the plum. When you plant them and they are still low to the ground the deer will destroy them, you will have to start right over. If they are fruiting the deer will stand on their back legs to reach up and get fruit.So it would be a good idea to put a fence around them to keep the animals out, also when the trees begin to fruit you will have a problem with bear climbing the trees or grabbing branches and breakin them(if you live further north) so you may want take some precautions againts that. Get your soil tested by your local dept. of ag. or send a sample to Mich.

It's hard work, and you need at least two of you to do this, you will also have to take out the whole drum in order to take the belt off. Keep the old belt, so you can bring in to the store where they sell them. Or if you have the extra money have a repair person to come and do the work on it.

2uZXCyeBaa	As long as the temperature in the house has time to get from 72 degrees down to 65 degrees and then stay at 65 for a period of time, you'll save energy and money.  If it doesn't have time to cool down to 65, you'll have approximately zero net change in energy usage.  From the time that the temperature first reaches 65 to the time that it reaches 72 after you've come home, you'll be using less energy because of this basic principle:<br>  <br>  HVAC systems keep the inside temperature higher or lower than the outdoor temperature.  No matter how well-insulated a building is, heat will escape/enter the building to equalize the inside temperature with the outside temperature (with adjustments for factors such as single pane glass windows and dark colored roofing/paint which would alter the way that the sun's energy affects a building.)  Because of this equalization effect, how much a system will have to work is affected primarily by the difference between the outside temperature and the inside temperature.  If your system is set at 72F and the outside temperature is 15F, the system will have to run for a longer period to maintain that temperature difference of 57 degrees than if the system were set at 65F and the outside temperature were 15F, requiring a heat rise of 50 degrees.  <br>  <br>  So yes, you will save money and energy by turning your thermostat down when you leave home.  And you'll save even more if you turn it down to 50 or 60 if you're going to be gone for a long period of time.|`|Q4IwLWLvaa	You can program it to shut off altogether and program it to start about 1 hour before you return home.<br>  <br>  That way you have the maximum savings.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	Why not just keep it at 69 or so all the time.

AA10332086	The problem with fish fertilizer is the quick green up and then no more fertilizer. It is a one shot quick fix that doesn't last very long.<br>  <br>  A slow fertilizer such as Scotts is a much better choice. It will slowly dissolve and keep the nitrogen going to the grass for a month or more. It is also not going to "burn" your lawn.|`|944iJNAdaa	Yes, fish fertilizer is high in nitrogen, the nutrient that really brings on the green color in grass.|`|ef5KDy0Gaa	use ammonia nitrate /apply late in the evening then water ,for superb results.Can be purchased at your local co-op,or home center.|`|xaV4LGBAaa	yes fish emulsion is concentrated and can be applied with a miracle gro sprayer.

If you are handy, first, replace the fuel line filter, then try "bleeding" the fuel line from the oil tank to the burner. Finally, you might clean out the nozzle in the burner. All these steps (plus vacuuming out the boiler) make up a "tune-up". So, if your handy, give it a go, if not, try getting the system a tune-up. This should be done annually, whether or not you have problems.|`|Ncu1wJU4aa	It's not normal to hear noises from your oil furnace that you never heard before.<br>  My guess is that you have air in the pump or possibly restricted fuel line (plugged fuel filter, shut off not open fully).<br>  Maybe a stripped out pump coupling.<br>  Have them come back again or call another company.|`|uZxAWgaoaa	I don't think that's normal.  Find out exactly what's making the noise then ask someone else.

9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Hi! <br>  <br>  When growing an Orange tree you need to keep in mind the plant itself. Most citrus trees you purchase from a store is not grown from a seed but grafted onto a root stock.  A popular root stock for citrus is the Carrizo Citrange tree but to know for sure you will need to talk to the company who grew the tree. <br>  <br>  Now the reason for this is to know what soils is best for it. Carrizo as a rootstock produces large trees with high yields and produces large fruit with fairly good juice quality. Used many for grapefruit, mandarins and sweet oranges. Does poorly on clay soil and soils high in calcium. <br>  <br>  Water your tree when the fist inch or two of soil is dry and avoid over watering but don't let it dry out as well. <br>  <br>  Fertilize! Citrus trees are big feeders and need a fertilizer which provides high amount of Nitrogen and Potassium they don't do much with phosphorus. Your best bet is to look for a fertilizer which provides a ratio as close to 5-1-3 as you can get. Usually something made for citrus is close but I have yet to find an exact ratio. My favorite provides 5-2-6. Also citrus fertilizers usually provide miro nutrients such as calcium, magnesium etc. It's best to try and provide constant feeding but, so for example if the instructions tell you to apply 1 pound , once a week instead divide this amount of by the number of times you water a week. This way you provide a small amount of nutrients constantly instead of all at once. <br>  <br>  Lot's of sun! Sometimes this is obvious but citrus trees need lots of sunlight. <br>  <br>  Protect it from the cold! If there is any chance of tempertures dropping near 30 cover your tree up to protect it. You can also use old fashion christmas lights under the tree to help give it some heat. Use old fashion type, the new LED type doesn't produce any heat. <br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  A good place to ask more questions is at <br>  <a href="http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/forums" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/forums</a>|`|944iJNAdaa	Once a tree is planted you will have a hard time getting it into any car.

vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A friend who has pets and kids bought a Eureka boss smart vac ultra 4870 and she loves it. She said it was recommended by consumer reports magazine and rated right up there with higher priced vacuums. It outperformed the Dyson animal. It was priced around 150.00 and really cleans carpets and bare floors with the flick of a switch. Has hepa filtration for allergies, 8 carpet settings, convenient tools and ability to control suction when using tools. Eureka also rated in the top two for the fewest repairs.The Kenmore progressive also rated highly for pet hair but is more expensive. You can check out consumer reports magazine online or for free at your local library.

It's the best vacuum ive ever owned. It typically costs about $250 and comes with many accessories including a car/couch/stairs mini-beaterbar attachment. All the attachments live inside the canister - so you dont have to run back to the basement/laundry room to get them. Plus it's light and has a low profile head so it fits under couches/cabinets.<br>  <br>  I'll never buy another vac!<br>  <a href="http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/p_10151_10104_006W787261110001P?vName=Appliances&cName=Vacuums&FloorCare&sName=Canisters&psid=FROOGLE&sid=KDx20070926x00003a" rel="nofollow">http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/p_10151_10104...</a>|`|odpT2TBuaa	You can find good vacuum cleaner from here : <a href="http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/cheap-henry-vacuum-cleaner-hoovers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/cheap-henry...</a> Or <a href="http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/vax-carpet-washer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/vax-carpet-...</a>|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Electrolux is a good brand name.

Go to Walmart and pick up a cheap one.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	They all suck.|`|sqvv3e5Eaa	Dyson do manufacture "animal" vacuums. The dyson DC07, DC14 and DC15 are some popular models of the animal vacuums and they are great for sucking pet hairs.<br>  <br>  Other brands of vacuum cleaners may be great as well. I would suggest that you try out different vacuum cleaners before buying one.

You should buy a vacuum cleaner...in that way it will help you cleaning faster. And also, have you thought of reading some stuff that would help you save time in cleaning?<br>  <br>  As I search for topics, I stumbled this amazing cleaning guide called "Amazing Quick Cleaning Answers".|`|0VJE7BXmaa	We have the Kenmore bagless vacuum cleaner and love it.  It was ranked number 2 in Consumer Reports (The Kenmore with bags was number 1), and is much cheaper than a dyson or having to keep buying bags.  It has an inteli-clean sensor that helps you know when your carpet is clean.  There is a line of red circles and when they all turn green, you can move on.  It has a really good filter to keep the dirt from getting back into the air unlike many vacuums which just shoot a bunch of the dirt into the air.  Anyways that is what I would suggest.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi, I have yet to find a good mop, I have tried many out, the mop head with the strings on it, hold to much bacteria. The cloth once don't pick up dirt that well, and you have to keep putting in the washing machine to clean them. I do like my bottle/glass cleaner, it's the one that has the large and small bristles on each end. Didn't like the one that takes batteries. Don't use scouring pads anymore, they just scratch things up, I just let the pan or dishes soak for a bit and wash with a wash cloth.<br>  I restock maybe like once a month or every other month on some of the cleaning items, just depends on how they look. The mop I will use three times a week. And use it in the afternoon when the kids are in school.<br>  Use the bottle cleaner almost every day, don't want to cut my hand up like my sister did when cleaning a drinking glass with a wash cloth. :(<br>  Hope that helps, take care. :)|`|AA10097817	I would say I was mostly influenced by TV commercials when I was young and naive.

13qQYRX0aa	You will have to keep your dog of the lawn. Unfortunately the female dog has a chemical in its urine that will kill the grass.The damaged patches will have to be taken up some new soil put in then reseed.<br>  By the way a male dog does not damage the grass|`|XgaF1Q64aa	You can add some apple cider vinegar or white vinegar, I can never remember which. <br>  <br>  This will lower the acidity of the dogs urine and will stop your grass from dying.|`|x86mC8yyaa	The only way is to train your dog to go somewhere else, eg make her a special place in your garden, or to take her out when she needs to go. You will need to re-seed or re-turf the affected patches, they won't recover on their own. This was one reason why we have a small male dog, because although he does lift his leg against the plants sometimes, his 'angle of dangle' is so low it doesn't touch the foliage!|`|9lLRnm1laa	Just water your lawn regularly.<br>  <br>  It'll wash away the pee && restore what was already damaged.|`|FteB0LOraa	When it snows in the winter, do not eat the yellow snow.|`|8Spq1TYwaa	give her carrots and her wee will be bionic and she will make the grass green again.|`|RZjt3RWeaa	put tomato sauce in her food|`|0SoDvjU7aa	feed the dog pea soup|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Female dogs kill grass- especially in dry conditions.

You won't be able to keep-up with any over-seeding scenario, trust me.  <br>  <br>  I live and work on a golf course and have 2 male dogs who run off into the bushes to do their thing- you can achieve this too- with a little patience.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Pour a bucket of water where she`s peed to dilute it so it shouldn`t go yellow,the only other thing  you coud do is fence a bit off just for her to go|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	Nope<br>  <br>  Dog wee wrecks grass,it's a fact<br>  <br>  I had the same thing, so i paved the entire garden instead.<br>  <br>  Good question though!|`|paerqxfMaa	That's what happens.

I'd recommend hellebores; Japanese anemones (grow tall, don't need staking, beautiful pink or white flowers from August until October) and you could try hardy fuchsias, which don't actually like much sun but will give you beautiful flowers over a 2-3 month period in autumn. Any Spring bulbs. Quite a lot of ferns. Try Honesty (this is a biennual, ie plant seeds this year for flowers next Spring; let these go to seed (Lovely silver seed heads) next year for more plants the year after.)

Almost all older, and many newer small gasoline engines had a squareheaded oil drain plug. If it's not rounded off use a good adjustable wrench to remove it. But first: Anytime you are working under the mower deck, WHERE THE BLADE IS, disconnect the wire to the spark plug! Also, if you're changing the oil, it sounds like your trying to do a little preventive maintenance and there are a couple of other things you might consider.<br>  1. Any time you change the oil, clean or replace the air filter.<br>  2. If the spark plug is more than couple of seasons old, replace it, (at the very least take it out and inspect it and probably clean it). <br>  3. If the gas is more than 6 mos. old, empty it and put in fresh.<br>  4. Remove and sharpen and balance the blade.<br>  Remember to recycle or dispose of the old oil and gas responsibly.<br>  When removing the spark plug be careful; don't crack the ceramic and don't cross/thread it when re-installing it.<br>  (Be very careful when removing the blade. If you've never done it or seen it done before, ask for help from a "handy" friend.)<br>  Also, don't use Vise-Grips on the oil plug unless its already messed up, (corners are rounded off, etc.) because they will damage the plug. Oh yeah, one last thing: Never turn a mower on its side for any length of time, less than a minute or so; Always turn it carburetor side up. <br>  Good luck.|`|waSOgHroaa	Sounds odd...a square socket for a socket wrench perhaps...if one exists?depends how big the bolt is and how much room you have you should be able to get away with a normal adjustable wrench

There are leash laws here. If I had that problem, if after talking to the neighbor they still allowed their dogs loose in the yard and knew they would jump the fence, I'd call animal control. A few times bailing their dogs out of the pound should either prompt them to get rid of the dogs or to put them in an enclosed run.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	I agree with the others.  Install a privacy fence but not with pine wood. Pine is too soft the best is to use cedar.

You don't want an animal in your yard.  If you are going to put up a fence, you will need to do it fully around your yard in order to protect your kids.<br>  <br>  Once the fence is up, you can use your fruit idea, but a privet hedge and some well-placed trees might work better as a view and noise barrier.  Realistically, the dogs will still hear you and your family and they may still bark.  <br>  <br>  Good luck
LOH6UVh7aa	Here are a few that fit what you need. Hope it helps!<br>  <br>  Clematis Montana is the fastest growing of all the clematis and also one of the easiest to grow.  In perfect conditions it can grow to a height of 12m (40ft).   If it is cut back by about one third after the first flowering this will encourage vigorous growth.  Montana prefers alkaline soil and the roots and main stem need protecting from direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  Virginia creeper is a hardy climber with warm red foliage in Autumn.  Ideally should be given a horizontal support.<br>  <br>  Honeysuckle comes is several varieties which are vigorous and hardy, with strongly scented flowers ranging in colour from pale creamy white to bright orange red. They prefer a lightly shaded spot, well drained soil and plenty of compost. <br>  <br>  Russian Vine is probably the fastest wall cover of all, but can easily get out of hand as it can grow 5m (16ft) in one season. <br>  <br>  Akebia quinata is a creeper with fragrant, deep purple flowers which will happily creep up any support on a warm, sheltered wall.   It quickly reaches a height of 4.5m (15ft) with a spread of 1.8m (6ft) and could eventually grow as big as 6-9m (20-30ft).<br>  <br>  Annual creepers - if you just want a splash of colour during Summer, here are a few suggestions:-<br>  <br>  Sweet Peas are a beautiful, perfumed, dainty climber, available in a huge range of colours. They also have the added bonus that if the blooms are picked for indoors this encourages more flowers to appear on the plant.   They are easily grown from seed outside, reach a height of approximately 1.8m (6ft) but do need support.<br>  <br>  Nasturtiums do come in climbing varieties, available in yellows, reds and oranges and are ideal to cover a hedge or left to scramble over banks etc. They can be grown from seed outside and will spread about 1.8m (6ft)<br>  <br>  Morning glory again is most suitable for mild areas. Available in blues, rich scarlets and purples, easily grown from seed germinated indoors and will grow to about 2.5-3m (8-10ft) high in a season.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a site for climbing roses.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.berkeleyhort.com/roses/r_selectclimb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.berkeleyhort.com/roses/r_sele...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a site with list of different plants.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mgs.md.gov/mdrose/docs/climbers_wichurianas.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mgs.md.gov/mdrose/docs/climbe...</a>|`|f3qGumkuaa	Clematis|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Ivy|`|LU6vfqRzaa	Any type of vine/ivy plant will do.<br>  <br>  <br>  :-)|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Choose clematis or honeysuckle, not Ivy that will be a thorough nuisance as it will just grow everywhere including your garden and your neighbours,believe me I know it took me ages to get rid of my neighbours ivy that grew into my garden on my walls and even inside my shed.

mtmMQH4Xaa	You have a few options that have already been stated.<br>  <br>  Although some Idiot is putting a thumbs down to them, For this site be relevant at all, Yahoo should get control over these no nothings.<br>  <br>  Yes you can drill through the studs. In 4 feet you will encounter at least 2 studs. 1/2" hole is large enough for a 14/2 wire.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can drill to the outside from your starting point and run your wire in a conduit to the desired location.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you use a weather box if you mount on the wall. And a weather cover plate if you do a flush mount.<br>  <br>  If this also gets a thumbs down from the neighborhood idiot.<br>  Don't worry about it, The person's clueless.|`|fd731e800e3dd221fe8a61746720ede0aa	Absolutely!   If you can bore through the stud you will end up doing exactly what would have been done if the exterior outlet had been installed during initial construction.  As  you are tapping off an existing o/let the new outlet will be protected.  Are you using a "weather proof" cover?<br>  The outside cut out should be done carefully so the box will sit solidly in the wall.  The plastic "old work boxes" with the swing-out "ears" work quite well.  Depending upon the situation you find in the wall, you may have to do some creative blocking to secure the box.  It is worth some extra effort to do it well.  <br>  There are several trim pieces or surrounds available - usually vinyl, sometimes wood - which might help dress up the exterior by giving a flat surface for the box and a uniform shape surrounding it to which the siding can be fitted.|`|88SGoW1Iaa	You can definitely drill a hole in the stud allowing the wire to pass through, considering you don't compromise the stud with a huge hole. There are weatherproof boxes designed to protect the outdoor junction, which can be mounted directly on the wall. It should look like a simple box on the exterior wall.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	Run the wire up the wall through the attic and down the wall at the outside location.  Punch a hole from the outside to see the wire coming down from the attic and install the outlet.  Also, be sure to check the size of the breaker on that circuit to see if it's large enough to handle the extra load.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	If you're comfortable doing a lot of drywall patching, go ahead and do this.  Match the wire size with the wiring at the existing outlet (either #14-2 or #12-2), mark two parallel lines about 4 inches apart on the inside drywall between the existing outlet and the location for the new outside outlet and cut a long rectangular hole along those lines, carefully drill a hole approximately 1/2" in diameter DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER of the wall studs which are in your way, and run your new wire through these holes and into the existing outlet box.  It is important that you drill the smallest possible hole that you can fit the wire through and that you drill that hole right in the center of the stud so as to eliminate or reduce the possibility of screwing into the wire when you install the new drywall.  Now... drill a small hole from the inside to the outside, right next to the stud that you want to attach the new outlet box to.  Go outside and mark the outline of the new box.  I suggest that you don't use a PVC cut in box for a new receptacle because the force of pushing in and pulling out plugs is often enough to bend or break the retaining clips on those, leaving you with an outlet hanging out of your wall.  I usually use a product called Smartbox that can be installed right next to a wall stud and then screwed into the stud using the integrated screws.  For a picture, see the sources below.  If these boxes are not available at your local electric supply house, you can use a conventional electric box.  Just cut off all of the parts that protrude around the edges so that the entire box can slide in to a hole the size of the opening on the front of the box.  That includes any plastic or metal brackets, nails, clips for holding nails into place, etc.  Push the box into the hole and pull the new wire through the hole in the back of the box.  Now take a long screw driver bit and 2 or 3 screws and drive them through the plastic box and into the stud to hold it into place.  Strip back the outer NM insulating jacket and wire up the GFCI as specified in it's directions, then carefully push the outlet into the box and screw it in.  Install a raintight cover appropriate for your application.  <br>  <br>  Some considerations that you should take into account:  <br>  <br>  -When marking the hole to cut in the outside wall, make sure that there are no obstructions for about 1/2 inch around the marked hole that would inhibit a weatherproof cover from being installed or opening.<br>  <br>  -Many municipalities (and possibly the NEC) require that GFCI receptacles and any load outlets that they feed be on their own circuit breaker with nothing else.|`|Uc6Z1J1Eaa	hmmmm i think if u 1st find out weather there is a stud in the way surely u can adjust ur measurements !!!!  if i was installing this outlet depending on the area , a meatal stud wont be a promlem if u have the correct tools !!!!! this may be no help to u whatsoever ....... as i am only an ameture sparky .....|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You can run the wire outside right at the inside outlet then run a pvc electrical conduit to a surface mount outlet box. It wont look as good as everything installed in the wall but you will not have to rip apart any walls either.|`|51441Us8aa	I do this all the time. Just drill straight thru the back of the box to outside. run your wire thru and just use a surface mount box outside. easy stuff, no moving over, no sheetrock repair, and no stud will be behind the box.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Might want to move it a little further away from inside outlet at least a foot tough drilling thru studs without taking the inside sheetrock down i do alot re-model projects and trust me if i had a choice id take new constuction everytime|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Codes are local in nature and you should verify a few things.<br>  <br>  1) Does the outlet need to be on it's own circuit<br>  <br>  2) Do you need to use conduit to house the wires<br>  <br>  Also, rather than drilling through a stud, why not go right next to the stud.   Drilling a hole through a stud lengthwise (I assume the exterior wall is framed with the studs lengthwise since most all are) will weaken the stud on a bearing wall.

m001xWWKaa	I would be careful with the black red and white theme...could look a little "eighties."  I would be sure to pick more of a maroon color so as to not get into that.  Black cabinets are becoming popular now, then you can install some stainless steel pulls on them. Maybe paint your walls, top and bottom a really light beige so the room doesn't feel dark after painting the cabinets black. Then you can keep the red for your accessories,and go with what ever color red you like.  You could get a really pretty red rug, curtains, and towels. They even have red appliances now, such as mixers and things.  Paint the trim white for sure!  Hopefully you have neutral counter tops to go with all this!

85mjL6doaa	Hi, i work for a pool store and the first thing i noticed with this pool is that it is almost completely drained, you really don't want to leave an above ground pool drained for too long because it can collapse. also at this stage i would definatly say to get the large debris out to the best of your ability and refil it. the green alge can be killed by OVERSHOCK, what that means is you need to shock it with somtimes up to 10 times the amount of shock you would use on a normal basis. for instance i would start with at least 10 pounds of in above ground shock, dichlor works best its stronger. if your water turns cloudy that is a good thing it means the algea is dad and to clear it back up use a clarifyer, sea klear makes a really great natural clarifer. I hope that helps.|`|UtaNIzQUaa	It really doesn't look any worse than some I've seen that have been covered for the winter but not prepared properly. Go to your local pool store with the pool dimensions, pump info(should be right on the pump) and a sample of the water. Most pool places can tell you what to do to open it up and get it running again. I helped a friend bring back a pool that had been closed for 2 years and the cover had fallen in when it got bogged down with leaves from the 5 surrounding trees! There were frogs and turtles living in it! A lot of work, but we did it, and it was beautiful. By the way, we relocated the frogs and turtles to a nearby stream. Good Luck - it will be worth it if you enjoy a swim!|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	Well, it looks VERY FADED!  Chances are the liner is old, so anything you do, might make it start ripping and tearing, but it does look intact, so you might be able to save it for another season or two.  I would start with removing the water that is in there, say with a wet/dry vac and anything large like the huge algae growth can be removed too.  I would use a very light bleach solution to clean any remaining algae growth that remained, then fill with fresh water and start the chemical process you will using (either a salt water/bromide or chloride solution).  Otherwise, it looks like the structure is in good shape, but I would start planning to replace the liner in the next few seasons, if not sooner!  You could check with some pool companies and see what they would recommend, and check some of the online sites, lots of them have really good information.  I also would check with some of the online homeowners who have pools, a lot of them have good common sence kinds of ideas, that are not expensive and help to get on top of things that the pool companies will just try and profit off of!  I used a few of them for my pool, and I NEVER have a problem with algae, or improper chemical mix.  Our pool sparkles all summer long with little effort!  Good luck!

So if your area is past any hard freezes I would say go ahead and start planting.<br>  <br>  Also another tip is to look at the back of your seed packet, it will tell you an ideal time to plant based on your plant hardiness zone.  <br>  <br>  Here is a map of the Plant Hardiness Zones of the United States. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dragonagro.com/images/growing_zones.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragonagro.com/images/growing...</a>|`|DGbu2x7Faa	Depends upon where you live, see the attached link it is pretty good.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	After danger of frost (for your area) is definitely past.

Or you could just buy plants from a garden center mid May (or after the last frost in your area) and plant them then.  The main point: Don't plant until after the last frost!  I planted a bunch of veggies before the last frost last year, and half my garden died.  Needless to say, I'm never going to rush planting again! : )<br>  I was however, able to save a few plants by going out in the morning and melting the ice off the stems and leaves with the garden hose.  So if you notice a thin layer of frost on some of your plants and they've been planted, just give 'em a rinse job.<br>  Good luck on your garden!|`|88950a422926fd42558e591d50a87e71aa	Decide what you want to grow, once you have decided this if you are planting from seed then the packets of seed that you buy usually have charts on the back showing you what month is best to sow/harvest for best results|`|Mvblzfizaa	Depends where you live.

AA11305474	Having been in interior design for over 30 years, I have seen the shows come and go.  We are often called in to "fix" homeowner projects that they started after viewing one of these shows and being convinced that the project was fast, cheap and easy, got in over their heads or weren't happy with the results.  I love the ones where they rearrange rooms with the homeowner's existing accessories and furniture because I always wonder what the room looks like from which they stole those items?  Some of our friends participated in a design show where they did a room in their neighbor's home and their neighbors did a room in theirs.  They were most unhappy with the results as their neighbors glued some kind of spagnam moss all over their walls and it began to fall off in short order leaving a huge mess.  Due to the type of glue that was used, it was necessary to re-drywall and texture the room which was costly.  But, in this economy, I think we will continue to see the new shows concentrate on design ideas that homowner's can do inexpensively and without a huge time investment.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	Yes, I am retired and love interior design, but most of the shows are not very inspiring and are too often repeated. I watch a lot in the afternoon and often see show over and over. Boring,<br>  <br>  My favorite is the one where 3 designers compete for an upscale makeover. I also like the one where they created a room at a reasonable price based on a designer room. Sorry but the names escape me. <br>  <br>  The design competition show was good but there was too much drama and too little attention to how they did things. It made me afraid of designers so that was not a good effect.  Way too much bargain basement painted-over furniture and stripes on the wall. Design on a DIme should be called Design on a few cents. The show where they rearrange a room with what is in the home is good, if the home has decent stuff, sometimes not.<br>  <br>  Ideas for future shows would be theme decorating, decorating using real furniture from major retailers that we all have access to, and a show where people make things that don't look like junk when they are done. <br>  <br>  I like the shows on color choice, but not the hosts. For me an obnoxious host will lose the show. The brit guy is an example. These hosts need to appeal to people AND have talent.|`|Ml7cadEQaa	They're repetitious, there's just too many of them.|`|4a4795e43d693be3aa7146aa0989ea2daa	If people are sick of ALL the decorating shows, then there are no exceptions . <br>  <br>  And you are right. Everybody and their dogs hopped in the decorating, renovating bandwagon and there is nothing better to watch on tv.<br>  <br>  You should just watch the weather channel or the cartoon channels. They have no glue guns and pretentious "open your eyes and look at you new home" puckey moments.

hNfOgNNBaa	It closes it's outward flow of water (in vapor form) by closing it's 'doors' aka  stomata- a natural defense mechanism as a last-ditch effort of survival!|`|xh5hyLXJaa	Water is essential to plant life. Even plants that live in arid deserts need moisture and have developed sophisticated techniques to capture and retain moisture.<br>  <br>  How Plants Use Water<br>  Plants pull water from the soil into the plant; the water is in the form of a 'soup' that contains the nutrients that the plants use to grow. The plant draws the water from the roots and, in a process called 'mass flow', it moves up through the plant to the leaves.<br>  <br>  The water drawn into the plant is lost through the leaves in a process called transpiration. Transpiration occurs when the water reaches the leaves and escapes through tiny holes called stomata.<br>  <br>  Water Loss<br>  The amount of water each plant loses varies; some plants have developed ways to reduce water loss while others, such as tropical plants, typically lose great quantities of water.<br>  <br>  Most plants, however, lose over 95% of the water they take up through transpiration. The average tomato plant will transpire about 136 litres of water in a growing season.<br>  <br>  Cold Deserts<br>  Antarctica - a cold polar desertWe often assume that dry equals hot. Often dry climates are also be extremely cold. Dry rainless winter temperatures can fall well below freezing. One of the driest regions on the earth is also the coldest - Antarctica.<br>  <br>  Not every dry climate plant will survive cold temperatures, and for gardeners in colder regions, looking at a plant's natural habitat is a key to success.<br>  <br>  Many dry climate plants come from light sandy soils that drain quickly and are almost as dry in cold winter months as summer. Plants from these regions will not survive cold, waterlogged soil. Other plants have adapted to handle the wet, damp and cold soils of winter along with the dry soils of summer - many of these plants are winter dormant for this reason. (For more see Coping with Winter Cold)<br>  <br>  Wind - Compounding the Problem<br>  Wind dries moisture on leaves, desiccating plants, and it dries out the soil. Plants in exposed, windy situations often face a double dose of drying climatic conditions.<br>  <br>  Adapting with Dry Conditions<br>  There are lots of plants that wilt as soon as the weather becomes hot and/or dry, and the wind makes them even thirstier. Drying winds, coupled with low rainfall, creates extremely dry conditions for plants.<br>  <br>  In parched climates, hot or cold, plants only the resilient survive. Foliage, root, stem and life cycle adaptations all enable plants to tough out and survive in arid conditions.<br>  <br>  Foliage Adaptations<br>  Leaf adaptationsOne of the most obvious adaptations to dry climates can be seen in the foliage of plants that cope with dry periods without turning a proverbial hair.<br>  <br>  Plants loose water through their leaves in transpiration and on hot days a significant amounts of water can be lost, but in dry climates plants cannot replace lost water easily and in low-rainfall areas plants and have adapted to reduce transpiration water loss.<br>  <br>  The most water-efficient plants combine a number of water conserving strategies.<br>  <br>      * Fewer stomata, the pores in the epidermis or skin of the leaf on the leaf can reduce water loss<br>      * In hot dry climates many plants open their stomata only in the cool of the evening.<br>      * Small leaves (totora, lavender) have a reduced surface area to enable plants to conserve water, as do feathery, filigree leaves (romneya, eschscholzia or Californian poppy).<br>      * Needle-like foliage (grasses, pine trees) has a very small surface area that looses very little water. Some of these plants can roll their leaves inwards, further reducing surface areas and water loss.<br>      * Leafless plants, such as brooms, have lost their leaves altogether with stems undertaking essential photosynthesis and food production.<br>      * Grey or light coloured foliage reflects light, reducing heat and thus water loss from transpiration<br>      * Thicker cuticles, the outer waxy coating on leaves, slows transpiration; many coastal plants have a thick glossy coating on the leaves, reducing water loss and also protecting from salt-burn.<br>      * Silver hairs coating leaves reflect light and help to lower temperatures inside the leaf, as well as reducing the effect of drying winds.<br>      * Thick fleshy leaves can store water; many succulents have thick leaves that, when bruised or broken, contain a great deal of moisture|`|944iJNAdaa	Some plants lose all their leaves in this kind of situation, sometimes with the "help" of an insect infestation.  Surprisingly, sometimes these same plants grow back the next year, seemingly none the worse for wear, so at least in some cases dropping leaves becomes a life-saving act on the part of a desperate, stressed-out plant.|`|8jtiUxHraa	The leaves wilt reducing the surface so less water is loss.|`|d7af0cf9b2333b5c1df55225a5b30b14aa	Mulch around the base of the plants.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	mlb is right, too... hydrangea is notorious for this.... too much sun, high temps OR lack of water will cause wilting...often, we realize it was a fake wilt, cuz after the sun goes down and we go out to see the damage, there they are, up and happy again, without having been watered!!.... just the cooler temps and no sun beating down was enuff for them to revive.... another plant that is a water sensor in my garden is the coleus... they wilt this way, too....

XpkhUBkGaa	Typical warning...unplug the machine first. When you open the door, there should be two screws (one on either side) that screws into the lid. Remove these two screws, then lift up on the lid and pull it forward as it tucks in under the console. There are two screws (on on either side) that hold the front panel to the cabinet. Remove these and lift the front off the two spades. You should be able to set the front off to the side without disconnecting wires. Take the inspection panel off the back so you can see how the belt goes around the motor pulley and idler. Put the new belt around the drum and then put the belt on to the motor pulley and idler.

ZYCRkgawaa	Padding not only adds bounce and thickness to the carpet, but it insulates cold and sound. The people below you will also appreciate the sound proofing. In your case I would add a layer of plastic between the carpet and pad to keep pet problems from leaking through. <br>  <br>  Consider a class for pet training and if that does not work, consider another dog. Keep the dog on linoleum until it's trained. You don't want to live this way for the next 10 or 15 years. <br>  <br>  Probably whoever put down the carpet ran out of padding and figured no one would find out for years.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	You only need paddng if you are in apartment type homes (and then not on the ground floor) - there is no requirement for houses.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yep.  it's called being cheap.  padding helps the carpet last longer, make the floor cushier, and add a layer of insulation to help keep the cold out.<br>  <br>  as to whether or not it will make your clean up easier or harder.

That's one less layer you have to clean to get the scent up but if the floor underneath is porous/ not sealed then you may never get the scent out.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Yes, you can put carpet down without a pad but it's stupid.  Padding adds life to a carpet.

Whiten's and removes odors. It also softens clothes when used in the rinse cycle.<br>  <br>  For everything else, mix a spray bottle 50% vinegar/50% water and you can use it anywhere. Floors, counters, microwaves, bathrooms. You can even use it on carpets.<br>  <br>  However, I have found that baking soda works better in bathtubs and showers. Dampen the tub/shower, sprinkle baking soda in there and just scrub away. Works much faster than any other spray out there.|`|FSECpWsPaa	Have you tried using Baking Soda?  It acts as a natural laundry detergent booster, and helps to eliminate any odors in clothing (mildew, perfumes, mothballs, etc.) I use about a cup to a large load in warm water, and add the baking soda when I add my detergent..after washer fills with water but before clothes go in.  Works with colors well, too.  Just be sure to disolve it well in filled washer first so you don't see white streaks on dark colors.  You can also use Baking Soda to clean/polish stainless sinks and engineered countertop surfaces without scratching.  Just make a paste with water and Baking Soda, apply with a soft cloth, then rinse for a nice shine.  Can help to remove hard water spotting. Hope it helps.|`|a122b01b1756aff821e49bd8aa9c60d0aa	Baking soda is inexpensive and cleans well.

mwrSbSVuaa	Well, start with free stuff!  I logged onto my local freecycle network and gathered a bunch of new plants and interesting sculptural pieces, all for free!  Next, scour thrift sales (or curbs on trash pick up day).   Remember, just because something is intended for a specific use doesn't mean you have to use it for that purpose only.  I picked up a few colorful empty wine bottles at a thrift sale for .50 each and some copper wire from another for $1 for the remainder of the spool and strung the bottles from the wire and hung them from a flowering crab in the front garden.  It is an amazing sight when the sun hits them.  Just be creative and think "outside the box" and you will be amazed at what you can do!  If all else fails, look at gardening books from the library or pics online for inspiration, you could even take a walk and be inspired by a garden in your community.  Our community holds"Garden Strolls" where the public are invited into participating gardener's gardens and we just walk around and 'ooh and ahh' at everyone's creativity.  Its very inspiring.  Above all, have fun with it!  Happy gardening!!!|`|YaeG1cjhaa	Just look around the neighborhood. I started 'sustainable landscaping' a couple of years ago and we have the best yard on the block. I have stacked brick like planter beds and stepping stones made from discarded concrete. Old planting pots (or almost anything else) from thrift stores can usually look great with a couple of coats of paint. Native rocks that you might already have laying around can make a stream bed accent.<br>  If you have a lawn, try grass cycling or mulch mowing. It takes the valuable nutrients that you have just chopped off your lawn and returns them to the soil through decomposition. This can greatly reduce your need for nitrogen fertilizers.<br>  Don't forget, mulch, mulch and mulch some more. It will reduce your need for water while keeping the soil cool during hot weather and warmer when it's cold. When it decomposes, it will add valuable organic matter to your soil lessening the need for amendments. If you don't want to go out and buy that mulch, ask any tree trimmer in your neighborhood for the stuff out ouf the chipper. They are usually happy to get rid of it and if it doesn't come from a 'diseased or infected source it will probably be a very welcome addition to your landscape.<br>  When you add plants look for something that is native to your area or at least your climate. Everybody loves the showy plants from far away places but they require a lot of time, energy and money to keep them in an area that they are not adapted to.<br>  There's a new book on amazon called sustainable landscaping for dummies written by landscape architect Owen Dell. If you can't shell out the 15 bucks or so, it might be worth your while to seek one out and thumb through the pages. There's a lot of economical ideas to get you going.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Landscaping-Dummies-Home-Garden/dp/047041149X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Landsc...</a>

Ulme5ewraa	Yes there is a very easy solution.  Any hardware store should sell screen clips in the screen repair section.  They are just little (like 3/4" X 1/2") plastic or metal tabs with a hole for a screw to go through it.  You just use a drill with some self-drilling screws to attach it to the outer frame, not the actual screen frame.  They are usually sold tabs and screws together so you won't need to be worried about finding the right screws.  They are pretty unnoticeable if you choose the ones that will look best with your particular screens.  All you have to do is pop them in with a drill it takes very little work.  Most of them either come with ridges so that you can rotate it with your thumb or with thumbscrews to loosen them so that you can rotate it.  That way if you need to remove the screen for cleaning or repair, you don't have to take all of the screws out.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck.|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Okay, sounds goofy, but when we had this problem, I put the baby gates in front of the window. Looks odd from the inside, and if you get close to the windows outside, but if the windows are wide enough, it makes quite a sturdy barrier that still allows air flow. Or try the clips Bill D suggested, but if your screens are as flimsy as the ones we had, I didn't feel safe cause when u pressed in the middle they would still pop out. Safety before looks. Or consider just cracking the windows but not enough for kitty or toddler to fit through XD|`|944iJNAdaa	Window screens are far too flimsy to depend on to keep children or pets either one from falling out.  I don't think any window screen will ever provide the protection you are hoping for here, they are meant to keep flies and insects out only, they're not safety rails.

L8zmQS8Jaa	You need to know at what height the ball is being thrown from.  A ball dropped from the ceiling would fall at the rate of acceleration of 32ft /sec / sec. (You will have to convert this to metric measure.)  First figure the time it would take to fall that distance.  Then the speed you are looking for would be that distance over that time.  <br>  <br>  To be perfectly accurate you would also have to factor in the diameter of the ball.  If the ball were launched from the floor the center of the ball would be equal to the radius above the floor.  It would hit the ceiling when the center of the ball is equal to the radius from the ceiling.  The distance the ball would travel would be equal to the height less the diameter of the ball.
0VJE7BXmaa	I like Orange Glo Everyday Hardwood Floor cleaner.
v3xEtuLLaa	No.  The creaking is the floorboard rubbing against the nail.  If you want to correct the problem, and plan to cover the flooring that is down now, you will have to run screws into the joists near the squeaks.  Use a deck screw that will penetrate the joist a minimum of an inch, and be sure that it's countersunk.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11366224	Probably not.  The usual cause of creaking floorboards is that they are loose.  As you walk on them, the edges of the boards rub together.<br>  <br>  The best solution is to screw the boards down.  Put the screws in next to the existing nails (or where the nails are missing). This minimises the risk of driving them through cables or pipes.  Use screws rather than nails since hammering will only loosen some more boards.<br>  <br>  Another solution is to rub soap into the gaps between the boards.  That's OK so long as you don't plan to wash the floor.|`|I7YwG0Mcaa	It won't fix it, but you can fix it easily enough. Before you put your laminate down determine where the joists are under the floor and while kneeling with a lot of weight on a given point use a wood screw to screw the floorboard down to the joist. Creaking happens because people use nails, contractors like nails because they are cheap but they will always back out of the hole a bit due to expansion and contraction of the materials then when you walk on that area the creak you hear is the slightly warped floorboard sliding up and down on the shaft of the nail. If you go systematically through the room screwing the floorboards down tightly to the joists, especially at the points where you hear creaking, then put down your laminate you will have no problem. Be sure to put a lot of weight right where you are screwing in so that the joist is firmly touching the floorboard when your screw goes in. Also, if you can get access to the bottom side of the joists it can help to squirt some liquid nails into the crease where the joist meets the floorboards right before you go up and screw down the boards. Note to contractors: Use liquid nails and screws when you do a new build and none of us ever have to have squeeky floors|`|hNfOgNNBaa	I replaced old linoleum flooring with laminate and had the same issue (that I hoped would go away).  Once removing the linoleum, I screwed the hell out of the floorboards because they probably used nails in the 50's.   Anyway, it's an older 'cabin' and while the creaking is somewhat still evident, the floors look terrific.|`|B5QD6GzSaa	I'm certainly no expert at this stuff, but I believe that the creaking in your house is due to the house expanding from the heat, or vise versa.  Well good luck!|`|xRTjy9xIaa	woodthick is right|`|8EeoavSYaa	There could be too much heat or there could be a water problem, causing the wood floor boards to bend, brushing the nails.

Pack a small decorative pillow with pine needles; put it among the sofa pillow to freshen the den.<br>  Pace a porous potter jar filled with essential oil near a sunny window. The heat will dissipate the oil, releasing the scent. Replace oil often.<br>  Simmer a blend of cloves, cinnamon sticks, and dried Orange peel in a 4 cups of water to give a warm, spicy scent to your home on winter days.<br>  Top a light bulb with a drop or two of your favorite essential oil or scent, The heat from the bulb will release the aroma for hours.<br>  Sprinkle some baking soda on the carpet, wait for 30 min. then vacuum up.<br>  If you have any body odor, use powders and a nice smelling cologne.<br>  Hope that helps, good luck. :)|`|bFKnx2FHaa	Try to do your laundry more often, you can use Gain and softener.

Open the windows of your room to ventilate the room and get air from outside, do this at least 3 times a week. Always keep your bed sheets clean, don't leave your socks around the room. Buy Fabreeze or you can buy candles to make your room smell good. By only keeping your room clean will make you smell good. When your room is dirty you will smell dirty, your body actually retains the smell.

L8zmQS8Jaa	Any insurance company has two obligations to you in a liability situation.  The phrase that is used is to "defend and indemnify."  This means that they have to provide legal defense and pay for reasonable damages according to the policy you have with them.  The procedures used are partially covered by local regulations and partially covered by company policy.  <br>  <br>  I think it is reasonable for you to see the estimate and for the other condo owners to hire whomever they would like to complete the repairs. <br>  <br>  Damages to your condo would be part of a home owner's policy and again procedures will vary according to location.

It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  <br>  I think "zurich white" (# 7626) might be a good choice.<br>  <br>  You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.roomvues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roomvues.com/</a><br>  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.
pP5BWrCDaa	If you are on a pressurized sewer system rather than traditional gravity drained they may have been servicing the mainline & caused a backup. You may also be sharing a sewer trunk line  with another residence before it dumps into the main utility line. Either way, the only way to prevent a recurrence is to install a "check" valve between your residence & the main service. A check valve is designed to allow flow out but not back in. Something like this would definitely need to be handled by a professional. If you live in an apartment or duplex they most likely have the mainline installed incorrectly. In any case if you rent, call the landlord. If you own, call a plumber. This is way above DIY.|`|AA11759897	Main drains blocked further down the line You must be lower than others so you have got the backup.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Some sort of a surge either in your house, or if you live in an apartment, from some other unit.|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	I agree with Telmah and Murkwerdigliebe (Strangelove). <br>  But several years ago the local water works was checking out the neighborhood sewers with a pressure check.

FXnHE7mmaa	Solar will not run high draw items such as stove/oven, dryer etc...you can have these run on propane if you want, or you can use a wood cookstove year round. Solar panels and batteries and inverter will run you around $25000-40000, depending on your usage (average house 4 person). I checked into this last year when building a house.|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	Water well, solar panels, probably cost alot though:-(
1tilPTPVaa	sun light|`|fLKvHHtsaa	Windows.  Let the sun shine in.|`|8j7zj9aKaa	I do not think solar efficiency is well known - it happens to be abundant but fusion is energy expensive - it only happens in deep gravity wells.<br>  <br>  I think efficiency is a buzz-word in modern usage.  In science it has a precise meaning that is lost.  Often a better word to use is low-energy cost, or low environmental cost.<br>  <br>  If you have to light a football field brightly at night - there is no "led" or "solar" and you get to talk about a very tightly defined subset of lighting engineering.<br>  <br>  If you need to check your watch for a few seconds an LED can do well, and the natural-motion charging can provide great energy at very small recurring cost.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: What do you want to light up?|`|oqeb9hK0aa	Here's my take on things..<br>  <br>  1. Most efficient is sunlight (fit a window or light tube)<br>  2. Next your probably looking at light emitting diodes. There are various flavours of these depending what your after. LED lights are now finding their way into the 'mainstream' consumer market. In very simple terms your not wasting as much power in the form of heat with this type of lighting. However, the up-front cost of this type of lighting will be higher than conventional filament lamps and tube lights.<br>  3. Florescents are next. <br>  <br>  That's how I see it.|`|AA10262868	LED Lighting
aePKCotYaa	To build an effective but cheap solar panel, you need some expert advice. I recommend you get your hands on the comprehensive e-book and video instructions by Michael Harvey. His guide is very easy to follow and it will help you make a complete solar power system for less than $200. He also teaches how to make windmills.<br>  <br>  You can find more information at his website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cfurl.net/earth4energy/" rel="nofollow">http://cfurl.net/earth4energy/</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|jU6hOadFaa	There are several guides available online for building your own solar panels.

h6c0qGwaaa	There is no need to damage the lock as some have said they would do.<br>  First check the lock to see if it was installed backwards, that is the two phillip head screws are facing outward. If you are standing outside the apartment and can see these two screws simply unscrew them and remove the handle from your side. Once the handle is off insert a straight screw driver into the opening and turn it to throw the latch and open the door.<br>  If this not possible because the knob is installed correctly be advised that this type of handset can be opened by credit card or a piece of aluminum from a soda can. All you do is slide it in slightly above the area of the latch, pulling on the knob pull the door towards you, slide the card downwards and in as you do give the door a little wiggle to assist the card to fall between the latch and the striker plate.<br>  Someone unused to doing this might require two or three attempts to succeed but it can be done easily just don't get flustered. <br>  Another thing to look for is which side of the door the hinges are on. If they face outside no problems you're in.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	bust the lock and get a new one. they aren't that expensive.|`|b6lVElB4aa	AK47 all the way ..... wuts the apartment # and on wut street ill be the in .000002 seconds|`|ZhN9hOaaaa	Sweetest..that looks like an interior door lock. if you have a business card or credit card it can be slipped in the door jam at the point of the bolt and it will retract the bolt and press the door open.<br>  If it is the kind with and additional small matching slide bolt it wont work..  then have a smith open it for you.<br>  Good luck|`|a7ynfmhoaa	You need to either call the apartment owner, superintendent, or a locksmith.|`|rNmekxLcaa	Smash a window! <br>  <br>  Should be fun.|`|5de5a32d9ca982c8ba34be17b8c5d254aa	You need to tell the apartments, they will charge you but what they will do is drill out the lock. if you want to do it yourself you need a drill and drill bit, and drill approximately where the screws should be located on the inside, if you do it right the drill bit will make the screws reverse until the lock is free. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  -HANDYMAN|`|fNuMoHt7aa	cut the handle off with a hacksaw.

ZtCyxfpfaa	Quite easy, get off the computer and start cleaning instead of relying on others to do it.|`|Dqwajq4Qaa	It seems that you are making a good attempt at beginning to organize, which is always a good sign! I would set up a school area is a special place in the room, preferably near a window, for a more relaxing place to do homework. If you have a desk already get a few boxes or rubbermaid totes and organize your papers according to classes you are taking. For example, you can have an English box for English class stuff, a Math box, and so on. <br>  <br>  Also for better organization, try and make it a habit to DAILY clean your areas up. If you stay on top of your cleaning duties daily, 1- your room will be cleaner and it will take less time to pick up and 2- your Dad might see that you are being a responsible teenager and be more understanding!
