794f60bcfd0cbf18dbd1794c68f047f1aa	You might want to hit the weights a bit but if i was you i would what ive been doing and really focus on my throws and blocking the ball   For throwing   Just get your distances and work on them throw about 20 or 30 120 feet throws  then throw about 20 or 30 90 feet throws  For blocking the ball find a wall and take a tennis ball and work on blocking the ball eventually move up closer and increase the speed you put on the ball    Then you need to learn just about every possible play you as a catcher need to know this because you have to be a leader,   Be loud and direct traffic on all plays    And for your bonus question there usually right around 5 10 or 5 9 and usually 160-180 but dont worry about size your gonna grow, and once you lift weights youll gain alot of weight      I had the same thing with me im 15 and last year i was about 5 5 130  and now im 5 9 175, youll just grow trust me|`|tTqJL0dTaa	Your height shouldn't matter but I'd think about "bulking up."  Don't get discouraged because, unless you are the best player your school has ever seen, you usually won't play any position as a freshman (depending on school size, if you're the coaches kid,   of people trying out for a position).  Just keep working hard and you'll get your shot.  Sorry I can't help you with the websites.    "Average size" for a catcher is probably around 5'-11" and 195.  I was a catcher for all of my baseball career and I topped out at 6'-1", 205.      In short, your best bet will be to get some size.  Don't get fat, but 130 lbs is more of a middle infielder position's weight than it is a catcher's.  And "best catcher" in my opinion is Pudge from Detroit because he's got the best all-around game.|`|2a0d5802e4ae9291c9b4707e195e74f7aa	I dunno about the website but since your still a freshman you have time to grow.  I suggest you work out with weights and try to build yourself to about 150 lbs by the start of your sophmore season.  It seems like you like the position, but you are going to need to grow some.  Also, how good are you? What arm do you throw with and how strong is it?  Can you throw people out if they steal on you?  Do you drop alot of balls?  You are going to need to be good in your catching game to be successful.  More importantly in high school baseball is your hitting so i suggest you focus on that because if you cant hit you wont get a starting job in varsity.  Remember to be committed, keep your grades high enough to be eligible, and make sure you are on good terms with the coach.  Always show him you are giving it 100% and you will play eventually.      I love baseball, but when I started high school I quickly found out I wasnt good enough.  I played outfield for my freshman and sophmore year, but i was a benchwarmer and I only got 4 at bats.  I worked extremely hard in the summer before junior year and played summer ball.  I also changed to 1b since Im big and not too fast and I made varsity.  The coach noticed the difference and halfway through the season I was starting.  I went 13-24 (.542) and it felt great.  I started varsity my senior year too.    So keep at it and know what your strengths and weaknesses are.  And if you arent committed you arent gonna get anything out of it.|`|VyUOu58Saa	Hi,    I am a catcher on a girl's softball team. I've moved my way up yo 1st string catcher. You really need to strengthen your throwing arm. To make sure you can make it to second when the opposite team is stealing. I find that it helps not to go into a full squat when someone is heading to steal. If you have a little bit of time, watch the other teams coach for his "signal" to steal. It maybe be in a jumble of movements, but look for the one that the player steals on every time. This will help you prepare to throw down. I just google catching position. I usually get okay results. Good luck, i hope you become a varsity catcher.|`|09371098804b29db9ba12062940257b9aa	In high school catchers are the most important player on the field. You have to be tough enough to get beat up by inconsistent pitching, and smart enough to call a game with pitchers that have few tools. Physically being quick left and right to block the ball and have a quick release to second are most important. Watch a lot of ball, and pay attention to what guys do in different counts, when teams bunt, steal, hit and run, where they hit to. Lift and learn.  I think smaller guys with good arms make better catchers than big guys, smaller guys seem to be quicker around the plate and on throws.|`|4f3edc7a1eb25df1c20bacb76c588b56aa	I played 3rd base for my high school team 2 years ago and we had 3 catchers. and the main thing that my coach was worried about was blocking the ball. most high school pitchers can get wild sometimes so keep practicing on blocking the ball. also work on getting a near perfect down to 2nd and to 3rd. I'm sure if you keep working out you'll make it next year. I'd say play year round if you can. and go and talk to the varsity coach, show him that you are committed and let him see you play. im sure hes gonna see you one time or another during the up and coming season so keep up the good work man, hopefully you get a chance to play varsity. who knows maybe if you get good enough the coach might call you up to play a varsity game or two. maybe you could get a personal trainer if your parents are willing to pay for it. maybe within the next few years you can get one. but all in all just keep working on it. you can never be too prepared!      bonus answer...Get into the gym and get stronger on your whole body.especially your triceps. dont get fat or too big, you need to be able to run. at least be able to run down to first base to back up a play..GOOD LUCK!!

I think he will get a .285 average, 35 homers, and 100 RBI's|`|2a0d5802e4ae9291c9b4707e195e74f7aa	He gonna have a good season, but his flaw is his average.  I say .270 35-40 homers and 100 rbis.  He has nice position eligibiliy too.|`|C7vn8NZuaa	I say about 37 homers 105 RBI's with a .265-.270 avrg. That's his only realy flaw. He's a real steal this year, a very good option for power or for a utility guy that can fill in in multiple positions.
2a0d5802e4ae9291c9b4707e195e74f7aa	kendall or huff?  No brainer.  Accept the trade.  Kendall is a decent catcher, but pudge will have a better year anyway.  Huff on the other hand should rebound this year since hes back in the al at a homerun hitting ballpark.  He will also be eligible for 1b, 3b, lf, and rf.  Hes been great in spring training too .. batting around .400.|`|XFDOI5iRaa	One factor that has to be considered is what other outfielders you have and what you have for catchers.Kendall would be good for average.I would think that since he is a catcher which is a physically demanding position and that Aubrey Huff can play more positions such as OF, 3b ,1b and dh he should get more At bats than Kendall and be better rested.Also Huff plays in a much better offensive lineup and a better hitting ball park.One factor that has to be considered is what other outfielders you have and what you have for catchers

Il faudra bien plus que P. Sebastien pour redresser Brive. Apres tout, Beziers a beneficier des sous et de l'experience de Nicolin, mais n'a pas regagner son lustre d'antan qui en faisait un grand champion redoute et redoutable.

O Glorioso SPORT CLUB DO RECIFE nasceu 102 anos atrs (completa essa data em 13 de maio - dia que enfrentaremos o Santos, na Ilha do Retiro - nossa primeira grande vitria na Primeirona-2007). A Barbie (Nutico) come?ou n?o no futebol mas no remo. A Sarna (Santa) ningum sabe como come?ou, time pequeno do Recife (juntamente com a Barbie). N?o tem estdio (o pinic?o do arruda foi dinheiro emprestado pelo Governo de Pernambuco da poca, n?o recebeu um tost?o, consequentemente tal pinico pertence a todos os pernambucanos, menos a mundi?a do arruda). Sua torcida s vai a campo se o pre?o for de 1 reaus (como pronunciam seus torcedores). O terreno do atual pinic?o foi doado pela Prefeitura. Nunca ganhou nada nacionalmente, nem mesmo dentro do Nordeste nem vice chegou a ser. Concluindo, a Sarna (Santa) n?o passa de um clubinho de 1/100 de tijela, sem tradi??o, sem ra?a, torcida de 1 reaus, sem estrutura alguma (at a energia do estdio foi cortada),  bando de eternos dirigentes azulejados (sem "arame") - o atual presidente quase foi preso dias atrs por n?o ter como saldar dvidas acumuladas, verdadeiro saco furado esse "Fita Azul da Segunda Divis?o do Futebol Brasileiro (passou 13 anos l),  o time da Segunda, da Segunda, da Segunda. AGORA O GLORIOSO SPORT CLUB DO RECIFE, NOS SEUS 102 ANOS DE GLRIAS E TRADI??ES, ABOCANHOU 2 TTULOS NACIONAIS (1a. Divis?o de 1987 - Fonte: FIFA/CBF, e 2a. Divis?o de 1990); 4 TTULOS DO NORDESTE (1962-1968-1996-2000); DUAS VEZES FINALISTA: COPA DO BRASIL DE 1989 e COPA DOS CAMPE?ES DE 2000; 36 VEZES CAMPE?O PERNAMBUCO; MAIOR TORCIDA DO NORTE-NORDESTE (em Pernambuco, tem mais torcida do que a barbie (nutico) e a sarna (santa) juntas, e a 13a. MAIOR TORCIDA DO BRASIL - Fonte: LANCE/IBOPE-2006); MAIOR ESTRUTURA FSICO-SCIO-DESPORTIVA DE TODO NORDESTE E UMA DAS MAIORES ESTRUTURAS DE CLUBE DO PAS.

Segundo o conto, h milhares de anos, uma mulher, fugindo do marido, amarrou uma videira em seus tornozelos para pular de um p de coco. Algum presenciou aquela cena inusitada e gostou do que viu. O que aconteceu depois disto  um mistrio, mas sabe-se factualmente que em 1954 dois escritores da National Geographic chegaram quela remota ilha e testemunharam um estranho costume local: havia uma torre que eles mesmos construram ao lado de uma rocha, e os nativos subiam ali para saltar com uma videira amarrada ao tornozelo. Em 1970, o escritor e fotgrafo Kal Muller foi  ilha e tornou-se o primeiro "homem branco" a realizar o salto.  Em 1979, membros da Oxford University's Dangerous Sport Club, sabendo do que acontecia na ilha, dispuseram-se a encarar essa nova aventura. Os caras saltaram da ponte de Clifton, em Bristol, de uma altura de 75m, presos a elsticos utilizados para amarrar bagagens nos carros.  Depois da investida britanica, a prtica s foi ganhar visibilidade para aventureiros do resto do mundo em 1987, quando um grupo de esportistas pioneiros saltou da Torre Eiffel, em Paris. Em 1988, surgia o primeiro bungee jump comercial, em Ohakune, na Nova Zelandia, introduzido por A.J. Hackett.

GbYUShjFaa	Le Haka n'est pas une danse  proprement parler.    C'est une sorte de chant guerrier que les combattants, emmens par leur chef, entonnent avant la bataille.  Il sert  la fois  se donner du courage,  assurer la cohsion de l'quipe, et  inciter la peur chez l'adversaire, en le dfiant du regard et en lui montrant qu'on ne le craint pas.    C'est une tradition qui est assez mdiatise aujourd'hui, ?a fait partie du spectacle !    C'est un rite maori, c'est pourquoi il est pratiqu par toutes les quipes des ?les du Pacifique : non-seulement la Nouvelle-Zlande, mais aussi, les Fidji, les Tonga et les Samoa. (Il existe en plus plusieurs versions pour chacun...)  Il est d'ailleurs toujours particulirement impressionnant d'assister  une rencontre entre deux de ces quipes : chacune fait son haka en face de l'autre, en mme temps... que du bonheur !    Et  ceux qui trouvent ?a trop belliqueux ou violent, je rpondrai deux choses :  - le rugby est un sport de contact ; LE sport collectif o le combat est une valeur trs forte ;  - notre hymne  nous n'est pas mal sanguinaire aussi, dans le genre belliqueux...|`|DsWZlygDaa	il s'agit du haka, c'est pour se donner du courage...|`|edbCvcvCaa	beaucoup d autres quipes des ?les du pacifique font des haka une danse ancestrale pour se donner du courage|`|3f0c5e748c0f9c56237c62090ad35a84aa	Cette danse, appel le Haka (plusieurs versions existent: le Ka mate et Kapa o Pango sont les plus connus) est une danse rituelle excute par les Maoris (des aborignes de la Nouvelle-Zlande), il a pour but d'impressioner les adversaires, car lorsqu'ils excutent le haka, les joueurs crient et frappent leur corps avec violence.|`|VM7vcwrraa	C'est effectivement une tradition du rugby lorsqu'il etait amateur. Maintnant que le rugby est professionnel on peut se demander si ?a doit le rester. Cela peut etre considere comme un avantage pour les neo zelandais d'avoir a accomplir un cri de guerre destin a effrayer l'advedrsaire. en consquence et en contre partie, la France devrait avoir le droit de chanter "le petit bonhomme en mousse", "l'apro bic" ou "viens boire un pt'it coup a la maison". Nous aussi nous avons le droit d'effrayer nos adversaires.|`|lUbHTBP5aa	Chacun ses traditions. Cette danse, le haka, tait dans, je crois, par les tribus de leurs anctres avant d'aller se battre. Il y a plusieurs haka. Je ne sais pas s'il e danse encore, mais, il y a quelque mois, les all-blacks ( les rugbymans no-zlandais, cela signifie tout-en-noir) dansait une version du haka o ils miimaient d'egorger l'adversaire. Violent, non?|`|KoA4iOueaa	On voit tout de suite que tu es novice dans ce magnifique sport qu'est le rugby. La "dance" dont tu parles s'appelle le Haka c'est une tradition  chaque match, pour faire peur aux adversaires, les paroles et les gestes changent de temps en temps. C'est trs impressionnant, et je trouve ?a trs intressant, ?a fait parti du folklore du rugby no-zlandais.
12f0e60d4319b7cb9031b7773092f9abaa	Je suis tout  fait daccord avec toi, dans la mesure ou dans ta phrase et tes commentaires, on remplace Nadal par Fereder et Federer par Nadal (bon et aussi Davydenko par Djokovic)  Je vis en Espagne, aime beaucoup les sportifs espagnols. Robredo par exemple au tennis... mais il serait peut etre que Nadal (que je ne supporte pas), passe un peu le relais  Rolland, non?|`|cce5fe05a52172aee6e7c46457fb6b1eaa	Je pense que les 2 sont d'immenses champions.  Je donnerais toutefois un avantage  Federer qui gagne sur toutes les surfaces (il a battu Nadal il y a peu sur terre battue) et est donc plus complet.  Que le meilleur gagne.|`|259bcb099a7fd7500a1e4cbe77a76136aa	Alors l mon grand dsole pour toi, mais c'est Federer qui va gagner. De toute fa?on, oublies-tu qu'il est le numro UN mondial depuis plusieurs annes. Donc, mme s'il perdait demain dimanche, il serait toujours et encore PREMIER mondial, tant il a de points d'avance. Et oui, ne t'en dplaise.    Au fait Federer te pose-t-il un problme ? Il t'a fait du mal peut-tre ??? Petit jaloux va .....Bisous.    P.-S. Oui, "Marc" a tout simplement raison.|`|5a59bb843f1b37f106642d020a6aa253aa	Sans vouloir te vexer, je pense que l'on peut retourner ta question en faveur de Federer. Que le meilleur gagne !!!|`|cf5125000d094cafd8d87bbc86376380aa	Moi je me lasse,trs vite mme !    tu as toute a fait raison,le tennis serait trs chiant....  qd a  roger je ne le suporte pas (j'aime pas dire ?a sur qq mais comme les autres ne se privent pas!)  il se gne pas pour dire qu'il est le meilleur et tout et je ne comprendrai jms pourkoi tout le monde dit qu'il est super modeste !  (sans relanc le dbat pareil pour nadal je ne vois pas en koi il est super prtensieu mais bon !)    Vamos Rafa pour demain en tout cas !|`|bxt511X2aa	Oui tu as tout  fait raison!!! Y'en a marre que Federer gagne tout! Qu'il laisse au moins Roland Garros  Rafa!    En plus rafa est en train de devenir trs bon sur ttes les surfaces, donc on peut penser qu'il va devenir un problme pour Federer dans les prochains mois...    Vamos!!!!!!!!!|`|a0d0a655f6c1d90a7b9422598bc4008eaa	Tu dlires mec. Comment veux tu que les gens se lassent d'un tel talent et majest dans le jeu? Tu crois que le garde du Louvre se lasse de voir tous les jours la Joconde?? lol    Moi je peux pas me lasser de federer parce qu'il n'est pas strotyp. Il fait trop de variation de jeu pour m'en lasser, et c'est pourquoi les gens l'aiment. Parce que c'est un ARTISTE!      "Nadal va lui montrer encore une fois la sensation qu'ont les autres quand ils s'affrontent  lui, le grand Federer." : C'est n'importe quoi. D'une Federer l'a deja battu plusieurs fois et sur terre battue. De deux, Federer perd contre nadal parce qu'il veut battre nadal au propre jeu de nadal. Maintenant depuis qu'il a battu nadal, il sait quoi faire. Et meme s'il perd demain, Je ne crois vraiment pas que Federer a la peur au ventre qd il va jouer Nadal. Dtrompe toi, Federer est un immense champion, il n'a peur de personne car il sait qu'il est le meilleur.   Contrairement  Nadal qui dit chaque anne, et cela depuis 3 ans que c'est tjrs Federer le favori parce qu'il est num 1...Il va nous la sortir jusqu' qd celle l? lol En gros, je veux dire par l, que Nadal n'assume pas son statut de favori pour la finale et que c'est pour cette raison qu'il ne sera pas numro 1 mondial tant que Federer joue.    @ pluchhheeee|`|Ny1L0hMKaa	il faut nuancer tes propos.effectivement, federer gagne tout,mais sur gazon et sur surface dure.  nadal est incontestablement le meilleur joueur sur terre battue de ces trois dernires annes.  pour rpondre  luna ,certes federer est num 1 mondial,mais  en 11 confrontations nadal l'a battu 7 fois;c'est assez  parlant!notamment sur terre battue!  quant  marc,tu as raison,federer a battu  nadal il y a 3 semaines  Hamburg.cela peut s'expliquer:la terre trs lourde de hambourg est trs diffrente de celles de roland g.,barcelone,rome,en ce sens qu'elle dfavorise les lifts trs strotyps du jeu de nadal.c'est de la terre battue ,mais de spcificit diffrente.  eh adil!tes affirmations!combien de fois federrer a battue nadal sur terre battue?tu ne sais pas !c'est une fois en 6 confrontations .et  puis si federer joue le jeu de nadal pour le battre,cela dmontre encore plus l'emprise qu' sur lui nadal pour ce qui est de la terre battue.de puis trois ans il n'assume pas son statut de favori parce qu'il ne  veut  pas se  prendre  la tete,la preuve lorsqu'il l'a fait il y a trois semaines ,il s'est fait battre!et s'il n'est  pas num un  mondial,c'est pas une question de prise de responsabilit,mais parce qu'il est spcialiste d'une surface.  de toute manire si federer espre gagner demain,il faudrait qu'il soit au top de son gnie,et que nadal soit mdiocre,car si nadal est  ne serait-ce que moyen ,il va lui planter des banderiles.  on dit qu'il est prtentieux le rafa,on dit qu'il n'assume pas son statut  on dit ,on dit,et puis quoi encore?|`|8KdxGuNqaa	Au contraire heureusement qu'il y aura Federer pour constraster avec le jeu bourrin de Nadal. Federer a un jeu fin et intelligent, ne t'en dplaise, il restera dans les annales contrairement au mcanique Nadal.    Hop Suisse!|`|d729b0501f7c33590142492c7df720aeaa	Excuse moi mais si Federer ne fait pas appara?tre ces sentiments ?a veut pas dire qu'il ne se stresse pas c'est parceque c'est un grand joueur qui se laisse pas faire facilement.Nadal est un grand joueur certe mais Federer reste le numro un mondial et il a dj batu Nadal en 3 sets je vois pas pourquoi il peut pas le refaire!!  Bon spectacle pour tt le monde!!
4073e7b2f3dc2f059b4c02bad2bd1104aa	Federer est sans doute le meilleur joueur de tennis de tous les temps. Il a 25 ans et a dj presque tout gagn. Tous les record tombe sous ces coups de raquette. Mais comme beaucoup de grand champion seul Rolland Garros resiste et ca sera encore plus beau lorsqu'il reussira a le gagner, contre Nadal en finale serait l'ideal|`|b88ecf4d9db95e2327487c92bfb12914aa	Oula mais dis moi, t'es aigri ou quoi?  T'as pas support que Federer clate Nadal au tournoi de Hamburg (sur terre battue) et mette fin  sa rputation d'invaincu sur terre battue?????  Federer est juste bon sur toutes les surfaces mais il pche sur Roland Garros c'est tout. ?a ne l'empchera pas de briller lors des autres tournois.    Nadal a les bases pour devenir lui aussi un vrai champion. Il faut juste qu'il gre mieux les autres surfaces et qu'il acquiert de l'exprience... Il encore un peu irrgulier...|`|843891a6fa9974e24fa58a1f2b1d6df6aa	Federer est un trs bon joueur sur tout type de terrain, il faut le reconnaitre, il est pas n1 pour rien. Mais il est vrai qu' Rolland Garros, je l'ai  trouv inconstant sur certains matchs, il a eu beaucoup de chance face au russe par exemple en demi... Nadal m'a effectivement bloui par sa combativit, et son talent indniable. Je le trouve meilleur que Federer et je pense qu'il s'imposera davantage dans l'avenir sur d'autres terrains.|`|mP4Bdcnlaa	Dieu vivant.... on est pas en religion.    Un trs bon sportif et fairplay (tout comme Nadal).  Il est encore jeune et donc on verra ce que le prochain R.G. lui rservera.    Une suissesse un peu d?ue :-) mais un grand bravo  Nadal pour son tripl.|`|cf5125000d094cafd8d87bbc86376380aa	JE SUIS TOTALEMENT D'ACCORD AVEC TOI !!!   TU AS CAS VOIR MES AUTRES REPONSES!!!  LOL!|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Federer reste le meilleur joueur du monde. Sur terre battue Nadal est quasiment injouable car cette surface est trs exigeante physiquement, que c'est le point fort de Nadal, et que le jeu se droule en majeure partie en fond de court. Curieusement tu dis Nadal hro?que car sauvant 16 balles de break mais Federer impuissant bien que se procurant ces 16 balles de breaks... c'ets pas trs logique ?a !  Sur surface rapide Federer aura un net avantage sur l'espagnol grace  son sens tactique et son jeu plus offensif.|`|66bb362bdb8c567667ccaed5256907d8aa	J'aime la fougue et la russite de Nadal, mais j'ai du grand respect pour Roger FEDERER, LE GRAND qui LE RESTERA!!!|`|ociK1g9Eaa	Federer est le meilleur joueur de tout les temps et se n'est pas pke il perd a Roland qu'il ne l'es plus|`|rS9bDn98aa	je trouve que federer est impeut timide face  nadal .mais rafa rste le roi de la terre battue alors vamos rafaaaaaaa t le meilleur|`|a0d0a655f6c1d90a7b9422598bc4008eaa	Calme down ddp lol  Federer a peut etre perdu 8 matchs contre Nadal mais sur les 8, 6 ont t sur terre battue...  Alors arrte d'etre jaloux.  Je ne suis pas sure que le face  face aurait t le meme si Nadal atteignait toutes les finales sur dur et gazon...Ce n'est qd meme pas de la faute  Federer si nadal n'atteint pas les finales sur les autres surfaces...    Oui, Federer est le meilleur de tous les temps. C'est simple, sur les 12 derniers grand chlems, il a tjrs atteint au moins les demis (record). Il a aussi le record de finales en grand chlems conscutives...c'est un hasard aussi peut tre?  Il a le record de nombre de semaines (srie en cours) en tant que numro 1 mondial...  Il est celui qui a bris la srie de victoire de nadal sur terre battue.  Il est celui qui a bris la srie de victoire de sampras sur gazon...une sorte de passation de pouvoir! (D'ailleurs c'est le seul match entre les 2 grands champions).  En 2 ans de grands chlems, il n'a perdu que 2 matchs...  Vas voir si nadal a fait ca.    Ton argument sur la prcocit est dbile. Je peux te sortir 36 exemples de joueurs qui ont gagn trs tot, et qui par la suite se sont calms...Chang en est le parfait exemple.      Enfin, j'aimerai ajouter un mot concernant la finale. Ca s'est jou  trs peu. La plupart des jeux se jouaient  40/40. Nadal a eu plus de russite sur les balles de break. Voila et c'est tout. Que tu le veuilles ou pas, Federer a battu ton idole sur terre battue. il est plus talentueux et plus apprci que ton chri lloll    @ plucheee|`|9Lv7OF0Uaa	ce sera le dbat de la dcennie entre les deux et leurs supporters  ma prfrence va  Fdrer  il est plus "tout"  un ami a eu l'occasion de frquenter les deux lors du tournois de mont Carlo  simplicit et facilit d'approche de Fdrer  Arrogance et imbu de sa personne de nadal  et que l'on arrte de dire qu'il n'a que 21 ans  avons nous entendu cela de Wilander?  je ne crois pas  c'est le personnage. et son oncle doit bien lui "bourrer le mou", (le cerveau s'entend) entre deux picouses de fuentes  il a t bien impliqu dans cette affaire, dont tout le monde fait abstraction.  Fdrer doit il s'excuser de gagner sur des surfaces ou nadal n'arrive que peu ou pas en finale? je crois qu'il a gagn derniremetn sur la rouge  Hambourg  mais oui, c'est pas la vraie rouge de roland, la seule, l'unique!! suis je sot!!  enfin, on aurait de quoi en parler durant des lustres  rien d'interessant au final|`|Gd8Sldpwaa	sampras tait un vritable dieu du tennis  sans avoir jamais pu passer 3 tours  rolland garros    mc enroe, edberg,becker , n'ont pas pu gagner rolland garros....    ce sont tous des dieux du tennis quand mme !    mme Cuerten est considr comme un dieu du tennis par beaucoup d'adorateurs de ce sport, aujourd'hui encore... alors qu'il n'a gagn "que" rolland garros...    c'est dire que pour tout un chacun, un dieu du tennis,   c'est celui dont on apprcie le plus de choses :  les victoires, certes, mais galement :  le style, le comportement, le charisme,etc...    en ce qui me concerne, je considre mme que  tim henman est un dieu du tennis, tellement j'apprcie son style service-vole, et malgr son peu de victoires ...  j'apprcie davantage une de ses voles que 5 coups droits de nadal ou de federer, ces autres dieux du tennis...    chacun de ces dieux a ses pouvoirs bien  lui !|`|Ny1L0hMKaa	tu parles de nous bassiner.et qu'est ce qu'il ne fat  pas entendre  sur la campagne de dnigrement qu'ils sont en train de lancer;comme quoi nadal se droguerait!  ils sont mesquins meme  la limite.nadal a t le plus intelligent hier en  empechant federer de jouer son coup droit fatal et je suis bien contente qu'il l'ait battu.  ddepuis que federer gagne on ne crie  pas au dopage,maintenant qu'il y a quelqu'un pour le battre,et encore,sur terre battue uniquement,(plus n pour  longtemps  j'espre)il faut chercher  la petite bte pour justifier les faiblesses de leur hros,quedis-je,de  leur dieu.  et je  peut t'assurer vue son dbut de saison que ses progrs sur  les autre surfaces,il va  les confirmer.|`|0v4kRTxdaa	Bizar que tu dises ne pas aimer les champions qui crasent tout sur leur passage, car c'est ce que fais Nadal depuis 3 ans sur terre battue.    Ensuite Federer a bien jou hier, mais bon il manquait un peu de jus, par rapport  nadal qui on dira ce qu'on veut est un trs bon joueur malgr qu'il soit confl au stroides, mais bon ?a n'empeche qu'il a un trs bon mental.    Mais c'est plus facile d'tre parfait sur 2 mois de l'anne ( c'est ce que dur la saison terre battue) que 10 mois par an comme l'est Roger.    Nadal ne gagnera jamais Wimbledon, alors que Roger a pas mal de chance de gagner un jour Roland, faudrait juste qu'il ne joue que ce tournoi dans l'anne, ou plutot qu'il ne se prpare que pour ce tournoi, et il le gagnera mais bon il n'est pas comme ?a lui au moins ;-)|`|4zJvBWU2aa	on peut perdre mme si on est le melleur|`|KoXqNwrEaa	vraiment Federer est le leader Mais RAfa reste plus dou...  Trois fois Rolland Garros successives...  Dieu de Rolland-Garros et du Sol...|`|65f3af8bbfe885f335cb91124d580a36aa	C'est simple en 12 confrontations, Nadal est victotieux  8 reprises et Fderer 4. Pour ceux qui ont oubli: Nadal fut finaliste  Wimbledon, et qu'il a aussi battu Federer sur dur (masters sries).   Alors tout le monde peut considrer que Nadal est une brute, il n'empche qu' 20 ans il tait n2 mondial (plus prcoce que Federer!!) et qu'il a un mental hors du commun.   Je vois trs peu de ractions chez Federer quand il gagne alors que Nadal est expressif.   Quoiqu'il en soit, Nadal est monstrueusement bon sur terre battue, il a 21 ans et a eu sa finale  wimbledon, il ne lui reste plus qu' s'amliorer "un tout petit peu".|`|29fIcvVOaa	T'aime pas quand il y a une trop forte domination mais tu es content que ce soit Nadal qui gagne Roland Garros. C'est pas trs cohrent pour moi. Il a quand mme le record de victoires conscutives sur terre battue (+ de 70), il a gagn 3 fois de suite Roland Garros. C'est un peu l'exemple type du mec qui domine le tennis sur terre battue depuis presque 3 ans.  Ce qui serait intressant c'est qu'il progresse sur les autres surfaces pour pouvoir gagner contre Federer qui domine tout le monde et qu'il laisse un peu gagner les autres sur terre battue.

1a4730edec0b8ca04e4921aa4725c00eaa	This same thing happened to a girl on my team. It is only safe for a pitcher to pitch a few innings a week, because pitching to much can result in harmful arm damage that can stick with you for a few years. Talk to your coach and see what he suggests, but I would say that pitching about 5 or 6 innings a week is the maximum. If you feel as if you need to do more, lighten un pn the power and slow down the pitch. This also improves your accuracy. Hope my advice helps :)!|`|8llqBwsGaa	Do not overuse your arm.

This move upset many in WWE, as the company had invested heavily in Lesnar. World Wrestling Entertainment confirmed Lesnar's departure on their official website WWE.com by the statement     Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season. Brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor.     Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had three wonderful years in WWE, but had grown unhappy and had always wanted to play pro football, adding that he didn't want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have made it in football. In an interview about starting with the NFL, Lesnar made the statement     This is no load of bull; it's no WWE stunt. I am dead serious about this... I ain't afraid of anything, and I ain't afraid of anybody. I've been an underdog in athletics since I was 5. I got zero college offers for wrestling. Now people say I can't play football, that it's a joke. I say I can. I'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL, if not better... I've always had to fight for everything. I wasn't the best technician in amateur wrestling. But I was strong, had great conditioning, and a hard head. Nobody could break me. As long as I have that, I don't give a damn what anybody else thinks.      Lesnar played in the Minnesota Vikings, where he created controversy in some games by starting minor fights and got heat from the Kansas City Chiefs for a sack on quarterback Damon Huard, which drew a big response from the crowd of 6,000. Huard was knocked silly, and had to go to the sidelines and sit out a few plays. Giving hard hits to quarterbacks in scrimmages violates an unwritten understanding, and the Chiefs were not too happy with him. His actions got him featured on Sports Center on more than one occasion. After playing in a few pre-season games, Lesnar was eventually cut from the team after not showing up for practices due to an injury sustained by a motorcycle ride during the summer of 2004. He declined to accept an invitation to play as a representative of the Vikings in NFL Europe.      Lawsuit with WWE  Lesnar had previously signed a no-compete clause in order to be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other sports entertainment or mixed martial arts companies before June 2010. Lesnar had anticipated leaving wrestling entirely, but his inability to secure a career in professional football led to him challenging this ruling in court. WWE responded by demanding damages as a result of Lesnar allegedly breaching the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show in 2004.    In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, 2005, WWE's official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company.The lawsuit was then entered into settlement on September 21, 2005, but talks broke down.    On January 14, 2006, Judge Christopher Droney stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and January 25, 2006, he would rule in favor of Brock Lesnar, giving him a summary judgment. This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere he wanted immediately. WWE was later granted a deadline postponement.    On April 24, 2006, World Wrestling Entertainment announced on their official website, WWE.com, that both parties had mutually come to a settlement and on June 12, 2006, a federal judge dismissed Lesnar's lawsuit against WWE after both parties requested for the case to be dismissed.      New Japan Pro Wrestling  On October 8, 2005, Lesnar won the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way match at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show in the Tokyo Dome, which included the then-champion Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono. He won the match by pinning Masahiro Chono after an F-5, which he had renamed the Verdict, since WWE owns the trademark on the F-5 name. After the match, he stated that this name was referring to his lawsuit against WWE. The match was his first pro wrestling match since leaving WWE. Lesnar is one of the few American wrestlers to have held this title. The first person to hold it was Hulk Hogan (also the first American to win a Japanese world wrestling title), and Big Van Vader.    On December 6, 2005 WWE filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJPW, but the court did not grant it, and thus Lesnar had two non-title victories against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. Lesnar successfully defended his championship on January 4, 2006 against former champion Shinsuke Nakamura.    On January 13, 2006. WWE once again filed an injunction against Lesnar to stop him from defending the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship on March 19, but evidently this was not enforced (nor granted), as he would go on to have both a tag team match with Shinsuke Nakamura against Akebono and Riki Chsh at the Sumo Hall on February 19, 2006 which was won after a Verdict to Chsh.    On March 19, 2006 at the Sumo Hall, Lesnar retained his championship against former Sumo Wrestling Grand Champion Akebono when Lesnar hit him with the championship belt and a DDT. Lesnar went on to successfully defended his title against the winner of the New Japan Cup, Giant Bernard, on May 3, 2006 in Fukuoka. This was the first American vs. American title match in NJPW since Vader vs. Stan Hansen in 1990.    On July 15, 2006, New Japan Pro Wrestling announced that Brock Lesnar had been stripped of the |`|e3ba1bb46f922e8d6e97f87b8c137b38aa	he still wrestles just not for wwe he wrestles for bna or something like that hes having a big fight soon aagainst this bigg dude im not sure when but he tried football with the vikings but thenn he just quit and continued wrestling.

AA10042073	No. To record a save a pitcher cannot relieved and his team must be up by 3 runs or less when he enters the game. An exception to the rule is a pitcher can get a save when he enters the game with his team up by more than 3 runs with the tying run on-deck or at the plate. However, a pitcher can never pitch himself into a save situation.|`|rxqVb8mkaa	Yes he can.  One of the criteria for a save is :  He comes into the game with the potential tying run either on base, at bat, or on deck.   He would though have to finish the game.     So say you are leading 5-1 and they have the bases loaded. They tying run is at the plate.   So technically, you could be leading 6-1 with bases loaded. The tying run is now on deck!|`|LlKgy0DIaa	No, he can't, unless he gives up 1 run. Then he's able to save the ball game. Go Cubs!|`|aMZcfGSxaa	Yes, but only if he comes in with a runner on base and finishes the game. The reason a runner has to be on base is he represents a run that will put the other team behind by three runs. You have to be up by three or have someone on base that represents that run to earn a save.|`|AA12255396	Yes and NO according to MLB.com     Yes if they are up by any amount of runs but the opposing team scores the most recent run and then threw this pitchers inning of work they do not give up a run they get a save     And No in any other situation if the team the pitcher is on is up by more then two runs there is no save opportunity.|`|AA10645170	no|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	no.....

eaagpElnaa	You say you like running, but fear you might be to slow for track and thinking of substituting running for baseball?<br>  If you enjoy something then there is no reason to give it up. If you want to run faster, speak to a coach and (s)he can advise you on the appropriate training to do that will increase your speed. Fartleks and intervals are the basic speed training exercises. You'd do well to read up on it.<br>  If you are so convinced that track isnt for you... why not move on to road running? The speed is slower than track, but you get to run on different courses. Some are truly stunning. Compare that with making 100's of left turns on a track each week. Also everyone runs different speeds on the road races. People chat and joke on road races. Try doing that in a track race.|`|8ebGghbbaa	Running is more of a self improvement sport rather than a competing sport unless you're really good.

2249d9c7e6b4b74758062157f8d648fdaa	I am always using new tips and tricks I find on here. I don't ask too many questions, but I scan through and look for questions already asked that may or may not help me out. I'm not sure how many people really use the advice given on here, but that shouldn't stop anyone from answering. Somewhere along the line someone is really going to appreciate the info you give.<br>  <br>  For example,  I never really though twice about using the Berkley Gulp baits, but I would notice they were in 90% of your answers when people asked what bait to use. So I decided to give em a shot, and I am glad I did. Now I suggest them to other people based of the success I have had.<br>  <br>  If I listed all the tips and tricks I have picked up from this Y/A section I would be here all day.<br>  <br>  But I reckon this would be a good time to Thank Everyone for answering my and others questions.<br>  <br>  Thanks Yall and Tight Lines<br>  <br>  -Adam<br>  <br>  <br>  *On a side not if your ever in the South Florida area I'll take ya up on that killer fishin' trip* lol|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	I took y'alls advice on my last question for my tournament last Saturday...and I finished 5th...in my opinion if you have someone give you some real advice in fishing, that is great...many times, especially around here, the guys catching fish are tight lipped...I'm not, because why be, if I can help someone, then maybe some day someone can help me...<br>  <br>  EDIT: Glad you liked the Kick-N Products...they are great and Cosmic is a great guy...in my T on Saturday...I was dipping my worm in the Kick-N-Bass Garlic...I had three fish in the boat when my boater asked me for some...he put his fist fish in the boat soon there after...my Daddy always said "...the scent isn't going to get you more bites, but if it is good it will make them hang on to it longer..." and during cold weather times, that will mean the difference in catching or just enjoying the scenery...if you ever get down to Southern Georgia/Alabama I can show you the fish down here...they are about to start bedding here soon...we have Lake Westpoint, Harding, Eufaula, Martin, Jordan and Semionole all within a short to a two hour drive from where I live...it is great =)|`|7royFhIgaa	I'm sure some people do.

I like to read about different methods catching fish across almost each state. <br>  <br>  I think that the great thing is new products get passed around on here, i may have missed an item in say a fishing magazine but when its mentioned here i will go an look at it and see what i think of it. <br>  <br>  Although we might not agree with everything, like Airflo, Ridge fly line and my dislike for bass poppers-even though they work! i can still say ive learned a lot. The thing with fishing is you can NEVER know everything and thats a great thing!<br>  <br>  Tightlines!|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Wow. *grin*<br>  <br>  I soak as much as I can of it in, honestly when I go out, I still sometimes feel like that little kid on the seawall with a length of twine, a safety pin and a hotdog... Every fish I catch is a culmination of things people have taught me and that I've picked up along the way... I didn't learn by myself, ya know. And since I've pieced it all together with the help of others, I figure isn't it kinda my job to do the same? Not sure how many people I've actually helped (glad to see that people get something out of my rambly randomness), but I hope it's been a few. So yeah... something... really, there was a point when I started this...<br>  <br>  *shakes her head* sorry, been a long day... *exit stage left*|`|lECmz3SEaa	many and just recently charles sloan|`|jwoVlmV5aa	I don't think so. Just be patient and pull hard when you get one!|`|AS5bLez1aa	I think that can be the best way to learn new tactics.Fisherman on a hole are usually very helpful to one another when your fishing for sport, when your fishing tournaments you won't always get the straight answers all the time at least that is what I have learned .I worked in a tackle and boat dealership for about 3 years 23 years ago I can still remember pointers from the locals in that area.Another good place is to read you find a lot of good information out there.I used to fish the Federation B.A.S.S. and taught a lot of the younger anglers different techniques and a few of them ended up at Wrangler Angler National tournament that B.A.S.S. used to put on years ago. It is always smart to share information and keep lines of communications open with fisherman you meet  wherever it is.Go catch em!|`|BK1GjPT6aa	In all honesty, I pay attention to what is said by the regulars. I use the ideas I can and if not I modify it to some degree to make it work for me. Although I have been fishing since I was born, I can never have enough info to add to my arsenal. For instance, A while back I asked if a carp rig ( certain type) would work for salt water applications. I read all the answers  and with a quick mod. I was hooking into Snapper. It worked and it was with help of everyone who answered. <br>   There's a ton of other stuff from Gimme, Yourself,Peter and the others here that I used as my own and every time I catch a fish with your ideas and knowledge, I give you guys a silent thanks. You'll know it's me when your ears start ringing.~good luck catchin'.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Yea, actually i do try the suggestions most of the time (I don't ask a lot of "best bass lure" Q's though.) The most recent was the Kastmaster. I asked a good lure for stocked rainbow trout and 4/10 people said the Kastmaster, so i was all in. I have not caught anything with it but, i think it's just because i don't have confident in the bait at this moment.<br>  But, i ain't going out on a limb with one guy (Who i don't regularly see answer fishing Q's) says this out of the world thing. Like "What is the best stocked trout lure?" and someone replies, i went a fishin' one day and caught one on a salmon fly." Heck no!!! I ain't going to try that, even if he did tell the truth. <br>  <br>  I preach and preach how a pink jig-head and chartreuse grub will catch more crappie, and bluegill that you've ever caught in you're life. But, i have not once heard of someone trying it. I'm the same way, on this one Fisher, if people would actually try the things we ask, and not just want to suck the information out of us just because they want to it isn't helping either of them (The answerer and the question asker) ... <br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out. (9/10 times i am not even helping someone they are just wanting fishing information that they aren't going to try.)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT : Just followed gonefishing's advice on getting a carp/catfishing combo ... Just got it yesterday, looks great.|`|cb7d8d8e1066301d27e5cac9944cfbfcaa	I received a great private message a few months back from a fellow who posed a Q about fly fishing for trout that I answered. He said he took my advice and caught a 4 lb brown.....always nice to hear.<br>  <br>  Without the regulars I wouldn't have known about alot of products<br>  for bass fishing (as well as techniques) - believe it or not I occasionaly <br>  foray out for bass/walleye/panfish with a spinning rod.<br>  <br>  Without their opinions on products and gear I probably would have ended up buying a Penn reel and an Ugly Stik instead of a Shimano and a St. Croix <br>  <br>  I still have reservations about stuff like fireline and  spiderwire;  maybe this year I'll read enough about it on Y! answers and try it.|`|p9RS2Wh6aa	Well FK at lest I know I have helped you out, & may be a couple of others.<br>  But I really wonder how many look at the whole picture and only look at what they feel sound correct to them and their local waters.<br>  Different parts of North America have different ideas of what is the best way to catch fish.<br>  But he!! I just pass on what I know, when I THINK/FEEL it might help.<br>  Glad I have helped you out with a few things.|`|SfDNRXNcaa	I receive positive feed backs on my fishin technics and locations quite often.

I listen all the time, I watch all the time, and I learn all the time. We dont know everything and never will.  I never blow my own trumpet. but am quickly on the horn to tell someone else they have done well. <br>  <br>  Yeh I think some people actually take notice form what we say here. and yeh some wont.<br>  <br>  have a great day I know I am, and heaps of fish. had a newbie out the other day and gave him a double hookup on 8kg  light tackle on two mahi mahi and then nailed his first black again on 8kg light tackle and tagged a 50kg black marlin.  That one out of the way we spent another 15 minutes and had another hookup and within minutes another , so this gave him a double hookup on 8 kg light tackle on Black Marlin and we got both, mind you the last went 90kg and took 2.5 hrs and 10 mile to get him to a point where we could tag him. and he still had a lot left in him.<br>  <br>  Tight Lines old Mate|`|R1gOclAzaa	I hope they learn from me or build on my idea. I am new to this yahoo answers thing, so I do not have any examples. Fishing has changed in the last 25 years as far as information being shared. The interenet has fueled this big time. Type in bass fishing at any search engine and see how many hits you get. And if you look to see where the information comes from, it is guides, pros and amatuere angler's. Anglers now days are more into sharing information, well they are better at it, I should say that they where 25-30 years ago. Which has it's good and bad points. The good is that we will see more Kevin Vandam's and Skeet Reese's emerge into competitive fishing. The level of skill brought to the table is going to be higher. I am 27 years old and I grew up about 700ft away from the Columbia River in Washington state. And I know if you are bass fisherman, aspecially smallies, you know where I am going with this. From the time I was 5, I have been fishing for bass and thanks to the smallmouth I was hooked very easily. About the time I was ten I started taking it seriously and I have been doing it ever since. I have since moved to Indiana and have been here for about 14 years. When I moved here I had Lake Michigan and all the lakes that I live by to further my education on both Largmouth and Smallies. So, all together I got about 22 years in the game with about 17 of those years actually knowing why I was catching the fish....the science about it. Now, I have grown up in an age of a fishermans dream of information at my disposal thanks to the internet. The interenet has changed everything. So, do I think what I say can be helpful to someone......yes. But am I the perosn that they are going to trully invest time with? Maybe, but there is a ton of information out there and I read everything i come across. I am actually having trouble finding info on bass and how to catch them that I do not know. And it is frusturating. I own every video that they make..lol....well not all  of them, I have kept every issue of BASSmaster since as far back as I can remember, I have two totes full of them. And any other mag that had anything to do with bass fishing.<br>  <br>  So, I guess if I where to give any kind of tip based on my experience, it would have to be this......Study the shad, crayfish, and anything else a Bass eats. Because that is what controls that fish. This would be good to do if you are a younger angler. Like 12 or 13 and getting into this sport. So, I said my piece tight lines to all....I will try to get on more in the future, but spring is upon us and I steady tournament schedule coming up and my life will be that.|`|wbkD7I1naa	I don't post on here as much as I could, but on my site when someone poses a question about our local waters that I have good information to give, I give it fully. Sometimes it includes location and lures that worked for me on recent trips, from there it's up to them if they use it or not.<br>  <br>  I usually don't go "fishing" for information such as where the fish are etc. But I do like to read GOOD fishing reports that include lures, tactics, and especially photos.<br>  <br>  One of my latest "go to" lures was discovered in a report, I always had it, I just never threw it.. Now I use it almost exclusively.

9it4bL16aa	Dans le rugby moderne d'aujourd'hui, les meilleurs joueurs sont ceux qui sont les plus complets. Un 10 doit aussi savoir plaquer car comme le 9 il se situe juste derrire les regroupements mais le 9 doit diriger ses avants et c'est donc le 10 qui pallie les plaquages rats de ses avants en premier,  d'aiileurs le meilleur 10 de ces dernires annes, Johnny Wilkinson est aussi un trs bon plaqueur (c'est pour ?a qu'il souvent blesser^^)  C'est donc pour ?a que Skrela sera titulaire car il imposera un pressing dfensif supplmentaire et que Michalak entrera en cours de match afin d'apporter sa vista car il est meilleur joueur  la main que Skrela. Aprs avoir ainsi resist la France amenera un crateur pour faire la diffrence.

Nous le payons maintenant.  A deux jours d'annoncer la liste des 30 on en est encore  se demander si Marconnet doit y tre. La rponse est non car malgrs un mental d'acier et beaucoup d'enthousiasme il ne sera pas  120%..( et pour gagner il faut tre  120% pas  100%... ).. Alors je prconise de partir avec les piliers frais et dispo.. Mas en tte... et de travailler vite vite la cohsion du 5 de devant avant de se faire dmonter par les Argentins et les Black ( qui ont une mle nettement plus forte que celle des anglais..)...   PS: je ne suis pas tout  fait d'accord avec lilou sur le choix du demi de mle.. Mignoni n'est certe pas un buteur mais il est hyper rapide pour faire gicler les ballons hors des regroupements et possde de bons appuis lui permettant de jouer au ras..( comme Gregan  sa grande poque) ce qui n'est vraiment pas le cas de Yach qui au contraire ralenti normement les sorties de balles... C'est certainement ce qui lui coute sa place quand il y a d'autres buteurs disponibles..|`|c60c7f11e7f44715b08b9de125f21525aa	bingow|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	On a plus d'pilier... Les "jeunes ont genre 27-28 ans", ca fait super peur!!!    Mais super Laporte a indiqu tres recemment que lorsqu'il serait au gouvernement, il ferait en sorte que l'arret bosman et cotonou soient "depoussieres", quitte a aller contre l'union europeenne!    Peut etre que la,  Bernie fera quelque chose d'intelligent...|`|SeF12uzpaa	bonne question...peut etre a Mas si finalement il se retrouve dans les 30...en ce qui concerne Yachvili il etait en competition avec Elissalde dans le role de N9 buteur...ne pas selectionner Mignoni au vu de sa saison, des matchs raliss avec l'quipe de france aurait t un scandale....Bernard n'est pas  une contradiction pres mais celle ci il ne l a pas faite|`|lxlWlqC5aa	Il est vrai qu'en voyant le match Angleterre-France, l'un des gros points noirs de l'quipe de France fut la premire ligne, trop de fois sanctionne en mle avec un apport insuffisant dans les regroupements, en agressivit. Hormis les deux talonneurs (un bon Ibanez et un remuant Szarzewski), les piliers furent dcevants.    On verra bien si nos deux "titulaires" se remettront d'aplomb avant la date limite pour dposer la composition pour la coupe du monde, quoique pour Marconnet, je sais qu'il ne sera pas du voyage.|`|f4c5a06c19216c969fe107cca15443b0aa	Ouaip il faut avouer que ?a fait un peu peur...     mais le plus terrifiant c'est que Laporte n'a pas vraiment le choix: Marconnet et De Villiers sont avec Milloud les 3 seuls piliers de niveau mondial en France (et pourtant j'adore Mas, en tant que supporter de l'USAP). Merci les piliers trangers dans le Top 14.    Concernant Pelous: c'est un leader naturel sur et en dehors du terrain, un mec avec un charisme norme (je l'ai rencontr plusieurs fois). Pap n'a pas les mme qualits et BL a besoin de relais.    Yachvili: il est tellement lent qu'on s'endort. Faudrait l'appeler Yachvalium. Elissalde est 100 fois meilleur pour le style de jeu que les fran?ais veulent mettre en place,  base de contournement et de vitesse de dplacement. Si on tait les Boks, ok pour yachvili, vu que la balle dpasse pas le 10.    Dernire remarque: 100% ?a suffit. A 120%, t'es dop.
vmKH1a2saa	Bonjour Eri_121168,    L'arrive de Nicolas Mas, qui fait partie de la liste "cache" des 10 en cas de blessure ou ppin des joueurs appartenant au groupe des 30, a t prcipite par l'annonce d'une gne  la cheville pour le pilier Sylvain Marconnet.    Cette gne fait que Sylvain Marconnet a du arreter les scances de footing, mais il continue les scances de muscu. Bien entendu, si Sylvain Marconnet n'arrivait pas  tenir la corde sur la date prvue avec le staff, Nicolas Mas le remplacerait.    Concernant l'arrive de Nicolas Mas, elle coincide galement avec la volont de Bernard Laporte et du staff de commencer  travailler la mle. Il ne faut pas s'y mprendre, mais contre les argentins, ce secteur va tre terriblement rvlateur de la physionomie du match, avec des gars en face tels que Roncero et consors.    Certes, la perte de Sylvain Marconnet, pilier polyvalent gauche et droite, va nous poser des soucis, surtout du fait de son exprience. Mais gageons que Nicolas Mas, qui a fait une bonne saison  l'USAP saura s'intgrer rapidement dans le groupe, et faire dmentir les sceptiques. Il ne faudra pas rompre, c sur. De plus, n'oublions pas qu'il y a aussi Olivier Milloud et Poux qui vont jouer.    Pour ce qui est du 5 de devant, je ne comprend pas par exemple pourquoi l'on conserve Fabien Pelous dans les 30.  Il a fait une saison trs poussive, il a t bless, et il parait ralentir le jeu.    Maintenant, il faut faire en fonction des blesss, comme les autres quipes. Nous avons des ressources. A Bernard Laporte de les utiliser afin de russir cette Coupe du Monde, qui se passe dans notre pays.    Bonne rception et bonne coupe du monde  Jean-Michel|`|SeF12uzpaa	chaque quipe  son lot de malchance. les sud af perde Spies qui a mon avis aurait t l'une des attractions du mondial, les gallois perde henson, les blacks Sommerville....la france  deja bien figur sans avoir  tous les postes les titulaires en puissance....Castagnaide n'a pas fait une coupe du monde, de villiers  rat la dernire...la meilleure quipe sera celle sur le terrain!! en ce qui concerne Mas je suis assez mitig...a voir s'il tient la route face  la Bajadita!|`|1821ee37152320cb4f5d91f2a2461afaaa	pas assez endurant  !|`|47327ddb3109948ca11156c97913bec1aa	Cela laisse  penser que sylvain Marconnet ne sera pas prt pour la coupe du monde ,et que conscients de ?a les responsables du XV de france ont sagement anticip en faisant appel  Mas.En ce qui concerne le pilier de l' USAP , il n`aura peut tre pas la prsence dans le jeu que peut avoir Marconnet, mais pour ce qui est de la tenue en mle on peut lui faire toute confiance , il l' a d' ailleurs dj prouv lors de ses prcdentes slections en quipe de France de mme que avec l' USAP en coupe Heineken et en top 14 o la 1re ligne des catalans est rpute  juste titre.  Je reviendrai sur Marconnet en disant que sa slection dans les 30 m' a surpris car revenir au top aprs une blessure aussi grave en si peu de temps me semble trs alatoire .  Je pense la mme chose pour la slection de Pelous.|`|aBWY8UIKaa	Le 5 de devant ne sera pas le 5 "type" et Nicolas Mas n'a pas encore l'exprience suffisante

OrdoJt9Baa	O softbol  um esporte eminentemente feminino e pode ser considerado uma vers?o mais leve do beisebol. Sua origem data de 1887, quando o americano George Hancock quis transportar o beisebol para lugares cobertos.    Mas, em pouco tempo, a modalidade ganhou o ar livre e seu nome definitivo, em 1920. Nos programas das Olimpadas e dos Jogos Pan-Americanos,  disputado somente pelas mulheres.    O softbol  praticado no Brasil desde os anos 70. No pas, existem cerca de 120 clubes de beisebol, a maior parte dos quais contando tambm com times de softbol. O Brasil n?o conseguiu classifica??o para o torneio de softbol dos Jogos Pan-Americanos de Santo Domingo, em 2003    As americanas conquistaram medalhas de ouro em todos os trs torneios olmpicos realizados: em Atlanta-96, Sydney-2000 e Atenas-2004. China, Jap?o e Austrlia as medalhas de prata, respectivamente.     O esporte tem as mesmas regras bsicas do beisebol. As diferen?as: a bola  maior, e o campo, menor que o do beisebol; o tempo de jogo  de sete entradas, contra nove do beisebol; e o arremesso tem de ser feito de baixo para cima.    espero que ajude!!!!|`|3a4c202823bde0c447ee15d9913cc0d8aa	O softbol (termo usado no Brasil; em Portugal tambm  aceite o termo softebol) foi inventado por George Hancock em 1887 nos Estados Unidos da Amrica, que arranjou uma forma de se praticar o baseball em ginsios cobertos. Foi includo no programa dos Jogos Olmpicos a partir de 1996.    Este desporto foi criado como uma varia??o mais leve do baseball (soft  leve em ingls), por isso tornou-se uma modalidade mais popular entre as mulheres.    O softbol  um desporto muito parecido com o beisebol, sendo as regras praticamente as mesmas. As principais diferen?as entre o softbol e o beisebol s?o as dimens?es da bola (maiores no softbol), as dimens?es do campo (menor do que o de beisebol) e o tempo de jogo (que  de sete entradas no softbol, em vez de nove). Alm disso, o lan?amento no softbol  completamente diferente, tem de ser feito por baixo, junto  anca. Outras regras menos expressivas como o roubo de bases e a mecanica das substitui??es de jogadores tambm diferencia estas modalidades. Em termos de alta competi??o o softbol  maioritariamente praticado por equipas femininas.    O objectivo do softbol, tal como o do beisebol,  marcar o maior nmero possvel de pontos ("corridas") para vencer o jogo.     Histria    Em 1887, no Dia de Ac??o de Gra?as, George W. Handcock, jornalista do Chicago Board of Trade, aguardava com alunos de Yale e de Harvard, no Farragut Boat Club de Chicago, o resultado do jogo de futebol americano entre as equipas dessas universidades.    Aps saberem o resultado e como o tempo estava mau, os adeptos das duas equipas mantiveram-se dentro do clube. Na brincadeira, um dos estudantes de Yale retirou da sua mochila uma luva de boxe, atando-a em forma de bola e enviou-a, ao longo da sala, para os amigos de Harvard, a qual foi imediatamente rebatida com um taco. Motivado pela situa??o da bola ser mais leve, maior e n?o alcan?ar grande velocidade, Handcock imaginou um jogo, semelhante ao Beisebol, mas realizado em recinto coberto, denominando-o ?indoor baseball?.    Das regras definidas por Handcock, destaca-se, obviamente,as reduzidas dimens?es do campo, a n?o obrigatoriedade do uso de luvas e mscara, e a importancia da utiliza??o de joelheiras pelos jogadores, em virtude do piso ser mais duro. Mais tarde, este jogo come?ou a ser praticado no exterior, em pequenos campos, quando o clima permitia. Ficou conhecido por ?indoor-outdoor?.    Para alm do jogo criado por Handcock, surgiram novas adapta??es ao Beisebol. Destaca-se em 1895, Lewis Rober, tenente da companhia no11 de bombeiros do municpio de Minneapolis, que para manter ocupados os seus colegas, nos meses de Inverno, inventou um jogo denominado ?kitten ball?, jogando num terreno ao lado do quartel dos bombeiros. A prolifera??o do ?indoor-outdoor?, do ?kitten ball? e outras vers?es praticadas em diversas cidades dos Estados Unidos da Amrica, foi grande, de forma que a variedade de regras impedia a realiza??o de torneios nacionais.    Em 1926, Walter L. Hakanson do YMCA de Denver, prop?s num encontro realizado em Chicago a denomina??o de ?softball? para estes jogos. Este nome demorou alguns anos a ser reconhecido e utilizado a nvel nacional, sendo, todavia, oficializado em 1932, no National Recreation Congress. A cidade de Chicago continuou na vanguarda do Softebol, com a realiza??o em 1933 de um encontro nacional, sob a coordena??o de Leo Fischer, envolvendo mais de 50 equipas, masculinas e femininas, nas variantes de lan?amento rpido e de lan?amento lento. Deste torneio nasceu a Amateur Softball Association (ASA). No mesmo ano surge a International Joint Rules Commitee on Softball (JRC), constituda, entre outros, por representantes do YMCA, da National Recreation Association e da American Physical Education Association. Este Comit foi alargado em 1934 aos representantes de outras associa??es, nomeadamente a ASA.    Actualmente  a ASA responsvel pela regulamenta??o do Softebol, com a extin??o em 1980 do JRC. A popularidade e desenvolvimento do Softebol foi significativa nas dcadas de 1930 e 1940. Actualmente esta modalidade  praticada em inmeros pases, envolvendo no seu pas de origem mais de 26 milh?es de pessoas. Na verdade, ao contrrio do que se possa pensar,  o Softebol, comparativamente ao Beisebol, a modalidade mais praticada pelos americanos. A justifica??o para este facto reside, entre outros motivos, na maior facilidade de aprendizagem e execu??o do gesto de lan?amento, no maior ndice de xito no batimento de uma bola maior que a de Beisebol e numa menor intensidade de esfor?o exigida durante o jogo.|`|49809d37bff647b56d49310079e2dbbdaa	por enquanto s conhe?o soft como bala.|`|Pcz20mKRaa	O softbol (termo usado no Brasil; em Portugal tambm  aceite o termo softebol) foi inventado por George Hancock em 1887 nos Estados Unidos da Amrica, que arranjou uma forma de se praticar o baseball em ginsios cobertos.

You cant see that he cant wrestle, gets beaten up all through his matches and his finisher is a modified firemans carry slam because your blinded by the merchandise. He has held the title for too long but if RKO or HHH held the title for as long as Cena i wouldnt care because they are both great heels and Cena is a crap face.   I hate Cena because every time his music starts and the fans keep cheering the camera is always pointed on some 7 year old kid wearing full Cena merchandise. Back in the day Hogan didnt even hold the title as long as Cena.|`|5lLLDK4Laa	Because their IGNORANT. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. If John Cena loses his title, people will like him again. But THEN he will be scheduled to come out twice as much to get it back. And eventually he'll get it back and people will hate him again. Which to be honest I think is an accomplishment to have the title so long.|`|EXUDALUraa	hes kocky|`|0dFmUahZaa	no because randy orton, hhh and undertaker are good and entertaining thats why i would care if they had the title for long.

Vince has said this,  Triple H has said this,  Cena has said this,    The main reason Cena is champ is because he and Vince are good friends in real life.      as far as long title reigns, everyone would get annoyed if guys had the title for a majority of 4 years (which Cena has)|`|tkyOfUHraa	He Is A Wanksta|`|401e20bf0cfb66cef2863d8a1378221aaa	john cena is blithring ediot and plz keep him mouth shut.   always he speak bla bla bla, he is junior wrestler, john cena must have thanks to writers of wwe because if he fight real  with the great khali and bobby leshley, they broke his bones. hhh and undertaker are the great wrestlers of all time and we love them. john cena u r such a big bastard and u don't desereve for wwe tittle.

I don't hate him, but he's not my favorite, either.    People generally dislike him because he's not terribly skilled as a wrestler, his gimmick is generally not liked, and yet he's had the title for such a long time. He's also liked by a lot of kids, so that alone will make a lot of the old school wrestling fans hate him.

0u3MLpGvaa	L'origine est anglo-saxonne. Cape vient du mot anglais cap qui signifie casquette. Les joueurs qui taient slectionnes en quipe nationale en Angleterre portait une casquette et en France, ensuite, o tait inscrit, je crois, la date de la rencontre. Maintenant, une cape dsigne tout simplement une slection en quipe nationale.|`|Ovym2mDkaa	tu veux dire, un joueur pap, un vieux de la vieille, quoi !|`|k6TZDMVtaa	c'est le nombre de fois qu'il a t slectionn pour jouer en quipe de France, 112 slections c'est fantastique, il dtient le record pour le moment de tous nos rugbymen fran?ais, je flicite d'ailleurs Fabien Pelous, car il n'a pas pris la grosse tte, il sait rester humble devant un micro de tlvision.|`|WCf0f2bfaa	Parce que lorsqu'un joueur est slectionn en quipe nationale, il a une casquette. Le nombre de casquettes indique le nombre de slections nationales.|`|R2BRAjdaaa	Car lors d'une crmonie, on remet une cape, une espce de petit chapeau, au joueur en question. C'est une habitude anglo-saxonne, je crois.|`|D7OFstJzaa	Selon moi, c'est dvi de l'anglais;   "1 slection" en anglais se dit "1 cap".  Je pense que cap a donn cape, et donc cap...    Si quelqu'un a une autre explication, je suis preneur|`|u4IWDS9Caa	C'est tout simplement que lorsque qu'un joueur est slectionn pour jouer en quipe nationale,les maillots s'appellent " capes " lors de leur remise par le selectionneur; et plus tu es selectionn,plus tu as de capes .

yjkedNswaa	Selon Bill Wallace, un joueur vedette de la tourne 1905-06 interview en 1955, les No-zlandais sont surnomms All Blacks depuis quun journaliste britannique du Daily Mail, rdigeant un article  loccasion de leur premire tourne europenne, les qualifia de all backs (tous arrires ou tous trois-quarts) en hommage au jeu de mouvement de leurs avants. Pour le match suivant contre lquipe de Somerset, cest All Blacks qui aurait t crit dans un journal  la suite dune erreur typographique et le nom se serait propag parmi les lecteurs du journal et les spectateurs. Pourtant, il semblerait quaucun journal anglais de la priode 1905-1906 ne contienne une telle erreur typographique, et cette thorie est aujourdhui gnralement rejete.    Lexpression est en fait apparue pour la premire fois dans le compte-rendu dun match de 1905 contre Hartlepool publi dans le Northern Daily Mail, repris par la suite dans ldition nationale du Daily Mail. Lauteur de larticle est vraisemblablement J. A. Buttery, chroniqueur rugby du Daily Mail sur cette tourne, qui la utilise en rfrence  la couleur de la tenue des joueurs.    Le nom All Blacks, symbolique de lquipe, est aujourdhui une marque dpose et est  ce point confondu  lquipe quelle est la seule quipe de rugby  jouer avec des maillots de la mme couleur  domicile et  lextrieur.|`|R2BRAjdaaa	Moi, j'aime bien la version selon laquelle ils portent le deuil de leurs adversaires car trs longtemps, ils furent imbattables.|`|SeF12uzpaa	assurancetourix a raison|`|n4QgkZY0aa	Black is thicker than blood !|`|d62b210a776d98abfd0dad26c09d8812aa	Qui leur a donne ce nom, je n'en sais rien...

6vzpHTqQaa	It depends on what pick you have.  If you have the first overall pick, you might want Alex Rodriguez (3B), Albert Pujols (1B), Jose Reyes (SS), Hanley Ramirez (SS) or David Wright (3B).  If you have the last pick in the first round, those guys will be gone, and you'll have to buckle down.<br>  <br>  Catcher needs to be taken relatively early.  Outside of the top five catchers (McCann, Soto, Martin, Mauer, Doumit...yes, I said Ryan Doumit of the Pirates), the herd thins out quickly.<br>  <br>  There are many infielders out there, but SS and 2B are the thinnest of the infield positions.  After Reyes, Ramirez, and Rollins, the SS position declines a lot (players left?: Stephen Drew, Michael Young, and Troy Tulowitzki are the next guys to go)<br>  <br>  There are many OF, and unless you want to grab Carlos Beltran, Manny Ramirez, or Ichiro very VERY early on, you might want to hold back on the position.  You can grab a good-hitting OF for cheap in the 5th round or later (think: Nick Markakis, Bobby Abreu, Matt Kemp).  There will also be a lot of free agent OF once the season begins.<br>  <br>  SP are plentiful, but (obviously) the good ones will be gone early.  You can still find good #2 or #3 closers in the middle of the draft, though...<br>  <br>  You will need a closer relatively early on if you want someone like Francisco Rodriguez, Bobby Jenks, or Jonathon Papelbon.  There are only borderline closers available as you get later and later in the draft.<br>  <br>  So, long answer, yes, but here's my opinion....depending on what number pick you have, I would go:<br>  <br>  1. SS (if you have the third pick, Rollins, Reyes, or Ramirez will be there)<br>  2. SP (you could probably end up with someone like Dan Haren or AJ Burnett in the second round...though that might be high for AJ)<br>  3. 1B<br>  4. C (could be a problem if the aforementioned top 5 are gone, but Doumit should still be there)<br>  5. Closer (K-Rod, Papelbon, Jenks, etc. will be gone, but you can still get a closer from a good team.....like Marmol of the Cubs or Fuentes of the Angels)<br>  <br>  The rest depends on what position you think you need and who is available.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in the upcoming season.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	My top 5<br>  1.Jose Reyes<br>  2.Ryan Howard<br>  3.Grady Sizemore<br>  4.David Wright<br>  5.Carlos Gomez|`|zo0WEQPfaa	top 5 would be<br>  1.reyes NYM<br>  2.A-roid NYY <br>  3.Hanley ramirez FLA<br>  4.David Wright NYM<br>  5.Ryan Howard PHI or Sizemore CLE or pujols STL|`|7rjWMG8waa	go for some hr and rbis

JXJQTgULaa	back tucks are really easy compared to back handsprings. Trust me. I got mine in one tumbling class. All you have to do is tuck your legs and jump, throw your weight backwards. You have someone spotting you, so its not like you will fall. Just trust them. You should definitely not practice on your own, you could fall and get hurt. I know that if you try, you can definitely do it. They are so much easier than back handsprings, well at least round off back tucks. There really isn't much to a back tuck.<br>  <br>  Good luck =D

H4dswqRlaa	As a handgun hunter who has hunted and taken large mule deer with a 357, let me say this is a sport for very realistic people. Only the heavy JHP's at top loadings, broadside centered lung presentations within the range that the individual shooter can keep all their hits on an 8 inch paper plate at, and the concentration on not screwing up a job which only comes with experience. Now with your Marlin rifle in 357, the rules change. Normal woods visibility distance is usually less than 100 yards, and that is certainly within the effectiveness range of 357 ammo with the velocity boost and longer sights radius from a longer barrel. However, with the higher velocity, those usual JHP's are going to explode and not penetrate the vitals. You must use JSP ammo in 158 grain weight or so. But if you special mailorder, and get the big 180 grain JHP's, the extra weight will create slower velocity, so they not only won't explode, but will penetrate deeply on larger bodied animals. It is controversial if this includes elk, but certainly only broadside lung shots should be considered for 180 grain Marlin elk. Some use the big 180 grainers in their handguns, but this lowers velocity there too, and range suffers. Regards, Larry.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	The 357mag in a marlin rifle could take a deer at 50 to 75 yard range but it is not what I would consider to be a good  Caliber for deer. Marlin makes a line of rifles that are cowboy type so you can have a hand gun and a rifle in the same caliber. I think its a great rifle for targets,small game,and varmints . It is also a fast action type of gun that makes it fun to shoot. I WISH I HAD ONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It's usable for deer.<br>  <br>   I'd suggest the heavy bullet(165-180gr) loads meant for hunting. With one light weight exception being the 140gr Barnes Expander load Federal makes.The Hornady LeverEvelution load might make the grade as well.  Winchester, Remington and Federal all make excellent hunting loads IF you can shoot well as their power level is rather low making shoot placement critical. <br>  <br>  Out of a carbine you might have a 100 yard maximum range at best. With under 75 yards being much better.|`|AA12323603	I don't think the .357 is ideally suited for deer.  I've used mine for pigs, for years.  Accuracy is not an issue.  Out of my Dan Wesson, with a 9 1/2" barrel, it  will hit a soup can all day long at 100 yards. (Off a rest, I'm not good enough  do it unsupported.)<br>  <br>  I just don't think it has enough energy, but then I killed my first deer with a .22.  <br>  <br>  With a .357 carbine, I would try to keep my shots inside 75 yards, 100 max.    Hornady  or Nosler, would be where  I would look for ammunition.<br>  <br>  With the Hornady Leverlution ammunition, I think it would be adequate, if you can do your part.

Entre nous, il n'y a pas beaucoup de fougue pendant la course! Le championnat est serr, c'est certain, mais il ne l'est que parce que 4 pilotes n'arrivent pas  faire la diffrence et que c'est les voitures qui guident seules les performance!Il manque un Michael Schumacher, qui savait se transcender avec une voiture quelconque, et qui savait transcender les autres pilotes autour de lui! Voil mon sentiment!|`|qRJReZWgaa	moi j'adore la f1  surtout la scuderia ferrari|`|zxFzpbRnaa	Schumi reviens!

Dans quelques annes cela va changer il y aura bcq de dparts, Bernie E, Max M, Todt, Dennis, Briatore, Franck Williams, et bien d'autre encore, on va changer de gnration.    Techniquement je me suis interress depuis le dbut  l'volution des F1 c'est vachement plus interressant que les courses elle-mme.|`|ZG36FZKvaa	si on voit le classement on dirait oui une season explosive mais sur la piste c'est completement   .    moi je m'ennuis a mourrir devant les GP chaquue dimanche. mais une chose qui m'attire cette anne c la prsence d'Hamilton. je me suis meme endormi pendant le GP de France malgr que ce dernier est l'un des course les plus interessante jusqu'a maintenant.      la F1 avec Schumi et sans lui n'est pas la meme chose.    il nous sortait des GP extraordinaire au moins 2 course par season .|`|dWkNwA23aa	Pour un fan de F1, une saison est toujours passionnant, mais franchement, alonso abuse... tricher pour gagner c'est pas cool, sinon les voitures sont toujours aussi belles et performantes, les pilotes aussi sont beau, vivement quand mme l'anne prochaine pour avoir un pilote fran?ais !!! Viva Ferrari...
aqLDMy2Maa	In baseball there is  the 15 day DL and 60 day DL.  If they get put on they 60day DL they are have to do the 60 days.  The clubs and players will choice the 15 day and hope for the best.|`|AA11414524	Mostly because the players are very competitive and want to get back out there before they are really ready. If the player is a particularly good player, the team sometimes attempts to rush the guy back, hoping he can contribute. There are instances where teams and players are smart and hold back until the player is actually ready, but it doesn't happen often enough.|`|554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	Because when you put a player on the DL you typically have to call up a player from the Minors.  This actually costs the team more money because of playing a minor leaguer more salary, and the player on the DL still receiving his.  So they will rush someone back from an injury.  Another reason is because baseball players (all athletes for that matter) are stubborn, and want to be back on the field even if it means before they are ready.  They are supposed to listen to the team doctor, but this doesn't always stop someone from playing too soon.|`|9vF8tQHfaa	They try to win and don't take into consideration what it is doing to the player! I know my best friend plays fast-pitch softball and she broke her arm they are playing in the world series and she just got the cast off!

KJWxqQHiaa	You've tried plastic worms, spinnerbaits, and crankbaits, so they are out of the conversation.<br>  <br>  Try some other soft-plastics like crayfish, or lizards fished slowly near the bottom. Dark colors, purple, or black.<br>  <br>  Maybe a soft-swimbait, try those in the smaller sizes (4 inch would be good) in a pattern that imitates the bait that the bass feeds upon.<br>  <br>  Other than that, i can't imagine any more good lures for winter.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	go back to your plastic worm. try a 4" in a darker color and slow it way down. waaay down.|`|amlmhoUuaa	I would try a jig and pig combo  (black&blue) or a 6" zoom lizard carolina rig in pumpkin seed.|`|PcOEPKfIaa	we have been fishing small lakes and ponds in Pa. after ice out. we had very good luck with live bate. try using large meal worms on light line and small floats with 2 split shots. minnows will work but not as good. we also like to use small buck tail jigs preferably, black 1/4 oz .|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Drop shot rig with a 4" finesse worm.  In a dark color of course. And try the float 'n' fly rig too.  Its killer on deep, lethargic bass.|`|eUbldFuOaa	dropshot your favorite plastic worm for that lake, scent it up, and fish it SLOW.<br>  <br>  good luck. have fun.|`|AA12298234	The air temp this time of year doen't have much to do with things until the water starts warming up. It's the water temp you need to keep an eye on. Bass will bite a jig and frog in the winter but you have to fish it very, very slowly. Often when they hit, you may not feel a thump but rather a mushy feel to the lure when you try to move it. I'd try a black hair jig with a brown #11 pork chunk on the hook. I'd also use one that had a rattle. A good number of jigs come with rattles on them already. Fish it very slow with short hops and a lot of rod shaking without trying to move the bait. If you are fishing crank baits, S=L=O=W is the word. You'll probably get a bunch of different suggestions,and some may work. Still, if I had to fish only one lure in cold water conditions, it would be a jig and frog.|`|r0PgRPtHaa	well for cold water conditions the best bait to use is the Purple worm.  the company that made this worm is called the Worm.  you can get it at any outdoors shop.  it works really good.  i caught a 5 pound bass using it and it was in cold water to.  once in a while you have to jig it off the bottom a little bit and then start to reel again.  They Are the best lure I have ever used.  I hope this answer helps you to catch the fish of your life because it helped me do that.
b2qdwABVaa	Here are some drills to improve your ball handling:<br>  - swing the ball around your waist using only your fingertips, do for 5 minutes and reverse directions<br>  - dribble the ball between your legs in the shape of an 8, this is called the figure 8, do for 5 minutes and switch directions<br>  - lay on the floor and dribble the ball with only your finger tips for each hand and don't look<br>  - continuous crossover without looking from left to right<br>  - practice protecting the ball against a wall with one hand, and then switch using the other hand to shield the defender (wall) from you<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  Keep dribble low at all times to prevent the ball getting stolen.<br>  Pass when you get doubled, b/c its hard to dribble through the double team.<br>  Don't be fancy, use the crossover only when you need to change directions.|`|EY6nzfmFaa	ask your coach, he should give you a list of workouts and drills. it also shows your coach that your willing to improve, and he might recommend you to the varsity team.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	There are a lot of good free videos on Stack.com and I also used Magic Johnson's Basketball Drills during my offseason.

ea07a1a295be1e118d6123f4e7d9af54aa	Li essa semana que havia um jogador de um grande clube do futebol paulista que estava negociando com o fantastico uma entrevista onde ele revelaria que  homossexual mas tanto o clube quanto o empresrio do atleta eram terminantemente contra achavam que assim a carreira do atleta estaria acabada, o que fez com que o nome do jogador RICHARLYSON entrasse na conversa foi a infeliz declara??o de um diretor do Palmeiras que ao que tudo indica vai ser processado pelo jogador e o S?o Paulo conforme o que li no seguinte link http://www.estadao.com.br/esportes/futeb... se o Richarlyson  ou n?o homossexual eu n?o posso te afirmar. Seja l quem for o tal atleta acho ele muito corajoso porque sabemos que esse  um meio onde impera o machismo, se at algumas empresas vem homossexual como ET imagina um clube de futebol? Tenho certeza que nas respostas para sua pergunta haver?o muitas piadinhas de mau gosto a respeito, sou torcedora do S?o Paulo e para mim n?o me importo se algum jogador do meu clube  ou n?o homossexual o importante  que continue jogando um bom futebol.|`|vULfVvm5aa	N?o chamem o Bicharlyson de gay....|`|JQ59AlOxaa	Parece que far?o um busto pra ele no Morumbi, esse privilgio  dado somente aos jogadores que se indentificam com o clube e sua torcida.

Dizem que Leonardo da Vinci tambm era homossexual.  Tchaikowski, o compositor, era assumidamente homossexual.  A muitas outras figuras historicamente importantes  atribuida a condi??o da homossexualidade.  Isso n?o interferiu nas grandes obras que realizaram.  Hitler e Mussolini eram heterossexuais.  Isso tambm n?o impediu de eles terem cometido as atrocidades que cometeram.  Ent?o se o tal jogador for ou n?o for homossexual, isso n?o interferir na sua competncia para jogar futebol, voc n?o acha?  Ent?o, deixe o preconceito de lado e apenas assista os jogos para analisar se ele  ou n?o  um bom jogador de futebol, que  o que ele se compromete a ser.

Y31Ci8vlaa	Darren berracloth is definitely better than his brother.His mountain biking is great.
qn3mvR6saa	I agree and disagree. I agree with you because Ray Allen is a 3 point magician, he's reliable is always making his shots. I disagree with you because Seattle is going to need cap space, and Kevin Durant isn't going to be cheap. Also they are probably going to keep Rashard Lewis because he is amazing and is still improving as well. Rashard Lewis and Kevin Durant will dominate, and I think they can do without Ray Allen. But yes overall they would have been much better with a combination of Kevin Durant, Rashard Lewis, and Ray Allen, but they probably can't afford 3 superstars, not many team cans ( unless your the shitty new york knicks )|`|0c89818713abfe3684652b5cfea1408aaa	stupid not to mention they drafted 2 small forwards|`|pSFITb0Yaa	its stupid ray allen is the best pure shooter in the nba along with dirk and ray is my fav. player|`|JeADU8l0aa	very smart, Seattle now has two great young players to build around and they unloaded Ray Allen who will be finished in a couple years anyway. Boston was foolish for doing this deal, they basically handed Seattle a scary new regime.|`|ZeN4IEVPaa	I think it was a good move for the SuperSonics.Allen is getting old and Sonics are focusing on the future.I guess Allen wasn't in their future. I have been told that Watson and Ridenour are on the trading block as well.It sounds like the SuperSonics are overhauling their roster, move to Oklahoma City, and start the franchise over.|`|AA10915692	Brewer should have been the guy to draft, not Green. I guess Seattle doesn't believe in defense.|`|brcfELYSaa	Smart because now they have the No. 5 pick and could trade that and No. 2 and get the No. 1 and take Oden.|`|ZcHfPmpzaa	Hasn't happened yet.|`|yLThAcshaa	Wow, all this for Seth Green? I was not really impressed by him in the NCAA tournament.|`|xnr98kRaaa	stupid by danny ainge|`|8cPPLSDOaa	Super smart move by Presti.

As long as you remember how to do all of the basics, I think you'll be fine. With a 7-10 strike ratio, you'll make the rotation easily. Good luck!!!|`|5BuFrXNUaa	probably good if you can catch and not complain a lot of teams like that most players don't like the position and becoming good at it is not to hard.|`|IQen1UCdaa	if u dont look like a white mokey with spikes...why do u even need answers if u are all so smart...you have 0 chance cause u dont have hops...cause u are a white spike monkey...ima call you no hops whitey...|`|ESqC5ZwVaa	there is a pretty good chance you will make it. its just that you cant just only pitch you can play other positions too.|`|zInWeM6Faa	Haaven't seen you play so we have no clue!

Trust me I went over this that's why I'm in football this year|`|yxjizQCoaa	Yep just if your at my school you wouden't get bullied by team members because were so strict but ya you should|`|zFNOaDAYaa	If you are any good, you need to be out there|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Go back and be the bully|`|ohgQoEjAaa	you shouldnt quit on your team thats not cool
jLTDqVHsaa	The run does NOT score.    That's a tricky one, because most force plays are finished by a fielder holding a ball on the base.  But a closer look at the rules tells us that a tag on a forced runner is still a "force out."    From MLB's Official Baseball Rules:  "A FORCE PLAY is a play in which a runner legally loses his right to occupy a base by reason of the batter becoming a runner."    Of course, this is a force PLAY.  Every runner in a bases-loaded situation loses his right to occupy his base when the batter becomes a runner.  That part is obvious.    The question is...is it a FORCE OUT??    The answer is YES.  It is a force out; it's an out recorded on a runner who has been forced to run from a base.    The rule does NOT say a that the ONLY way to complete a force play for an out is for a fielder to hold the ball on the next base.  The rule does not distinguish between a force play being completed by a base tag or a runner tag.  Either method is permissible to "force out" a runner.    So, with that in mind, let's go to the run-scoring rules:    "4.09  HOW A TEAM SCORES.  (a) One run shall be scored each time a runner legally advances to and touches first, second, third and home base before three men are put out to end the inning. EXCEPTION: A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made (1) by the batter-runner before he touches first base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner who is declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases..."    By the definition of a FORCE PLAY, the third out is indeed a "runner being forced out" in 4.09a(2).  A runner can be "forced out" by a fielder holding the ball on the next base during a force play, but also by being tagged during a force play.  Either way, the runner is "forced out," and by 4.09a-EXCEPTION(2), the run does NOT score.|`|2e4136dce9654275a96b53a0c5bb55ffaa	The run does not count because the third out was a force.|`|MZLxzNVsaa	no because that is a force out.|`|554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	If a runner crosses the plate, but a force out is on the run does not count.  I don't know a source list for you so I do apologize, but I do coach baseball and the scenerio has come up plenty of times.|`|2fmHLSUQaa	no, i've been playing my whole life, and that answer is no.|`|b15fd845d7c1e8b60c7f41c830714d5caa	yes the run counts because the runner was tagged out not forced out same thing as someone being in a run down and a base runner scoring while the runner is in a pickle
554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	Yes that is really good for your age.  As your body matures and mechanics get better you could be pitching in the 90's|`|15Gc95zKaa	How well do the batters do against you?  I would say with your age and speed you are going to end up getting it elevated how are your other pitches and your movement is another thing you may want to look at.|`|wsikkrc5aa	If you throw 85 at 15 and have just average offspeed stuff you should dominate JV|`|2fmHLSUQaa	Yeah thats pretty fast, especiall your age.  I'm taller than you and i can only hit about 78 on a complete toss without control.  Im 15.  If you look at Jamie Moyer of the Phillies he only throws 78 sometimes.  If you have good offspeed and control you could go places|`|4MncMBt5aa	thats very good keep it up and ice that arm after every pitching appereance|`|peNfkHxdaa	yes some pros dont throw 85|`|7fLHCiHVaa	this is really fast. many big leagers can throw only about this fast. u could be really good|`|MCdW7MYxaa	Your velocity is there. Throw in a good changeup maybe sweeping slider and a 12 to 6 curveball and call it a day for the opposing batter. By college you need two dominating pitches and by Class AA you'll need three above average to dominating pitches. Don't be a Kerry Wood type and out throw your arm. It's not about how you get the opposing batter out most of the time, just that you get them out.|`|e0cCeEZFaa	Thats not bad
BLMG7271aa	Here's a list of pitchers for the Cleveland Indians    63 Rafael Betancourt      47 Joe Borowski      36 Paul Byrd  R/R     56 Fernando Cabrera      55 Fausto Carmona      31 Cliff Lee      40 Tom Mastny      49 Edward Mujica      53 Rafael Perez      52 C.C. Sabathia      61 Jason Stanford      37 Jake Westbrook|`|LlKgy0DIaa	nope he's not on the indians.     i think he's supposed to, not at the batter,but close to him because he's a pitcher. that's what they do. throw strikes and balls.|`|aw5KHVE7aa	No, there is no Bargardaz on the Indians.|`|5cSVlMrYaa	That's what pitchers do! They throw. At batters. And who are the Cleavland Indians?     The answer is no by the way.
AA10872344	Take a fastball in the elbow with and without an elbow pad and you tell me|`|LlKgy0DIaa	my friend was playing travel softball and she got hit 3 times in two games. 2 of them were in the elbow and she almost broke it, so i think it's nice to have one.    P.S. now she always wears one and she says it doesn't hurt any more.    -C|`|AA10226033	If you get hit alot, they are nice to have. But, usually its best for leadoff hitters to wear them becasue they are looking for any way to get on base. Unless you are really serious about baseball, and a serious league, I don't think its necesary.
RCk9Bfqraa	CB, WR, S, LBS..  but varsity is really hard though|`|6c5e9c0198bb47dba3083e056a33d9d7aa	WR  you have good height and great speed ... just practice catching the ball and you be a superstar in no time flat !!!    Most importantly ... Have FUN !!!|`|AA11117660	What have you played before, or are you new to football?  I think you've got to look at your overall skills and what kind of competition you have too--do you need to earn a spot on the team, or is it a small school where you can pretty much make it for showing up, etc?      At your age, you have good size and I'd think you're not done growing.  I think you'd need to improve your speed to play S or CB.  I'd look at LB or DE if you want to play D.  Can you block and catch?  WR if you're a better catcher than blocker, TE if you think you can do both.  I think OL might be an option for you too.|`|AA12259109	Do you have any pictures of yourself?  If so post a place to see them so I can judge based on what I see, instead of what I read.    Based on the info. you have posted, you should go for LB.|`|554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	your not fast enough to be a CB or Safety, but your height and weight is there.  Without knowing your strength its hard to tell.  but possibly a defensive end.  Your weight might be an issue there, but your only 15 and should gain some more pounds if you are hitting the gym hard.|`|rMoQbiOFaa	maybe if ur lucky 2nd string left bench   but if that doesnt work out u could go for peewee chearleading  ha are u kidding me? im 2 years younger then u but im just as fast and only 5 pounds under you i bet i would run ur sorry *** over too  haha im from clearwater florida *****  ha ok u'll see me rippin it up at countryside highschool just wait for the highlight reels ;)  id say so ive always had to play with kids 1-3 years older then me and ive still ALWAYS started both ways on the varsity team  what about u    yea we usually make it to the state finals but if ur looking for the best team its at armwood highschool i think theyre ranked like  7 in the nation|`|wFakHCPMaa	Safety  Your height and weight(add ten LBS) are perfect to make you a force in the secondary.Safetys dont have to be lightnen fast so i think that position would be a perfect fit for you
3bacda68faa5179898ae68f81210197caa	sure they can...|`|LlKgy0DIaa	yes they can!!!! go for it and never give up! Don't listen to the people that say you can play with the guys!!!!!!! GO GIRLS!!!!|`|Trxn2gy8aa	I don't know of any female college baseball player, the women play college softball. So all the previous answers going "umm, yeah, like of course" - they don't know what they're talking about.     That being said, I don't know about the rules, if they would allow it or not.|`|i6vdLY14aa	yes they can my mom did and i am planing on doing that to|`|aNyL3pgcaa	Sure they do...it's called softball|`|9eJjaqO1aa	no u can only play softball baseball its just 4 boys only the girls can only see the baseball game not play it|`|tRFrDgoEaa	uhmm... yeah.

Jeet was the blonde in the paper. He was wearing a wig! LOL|`|2V8ABT92aa	who honestly cares whether they r friends r not. this is the stupidest question ever, Wait never mind there r no stupid questions, just stupid people who ask them.(Yankee fans)|`|bgVsMpMbaa	maybe theyre double dating  a hole rods stripper gf...|`|k831dfB8aa	Well I don't think their real best friends but they are friends and they do have fun together but it would be great to see them being best friends once again.

Le foot est un sport populaire et donc ce n'est pas la fine fleur bien duque au portefeuille bien remplie qui s'y rend, mais les fran?ais plutot modeste, et ca leur permet d'vacuer un peu le stress du boulot...  La violence fait partie de la socit actuelle europenne et mondiale (dbordements en argentine, en afrique, en russie, italie, belgique, hollande, espagne...).  la supprimer du fotball reviendrait  la dplacer vers un autre sport.   En France C moins le cas avec l'quipe nationale qui attire plutot les familles et les gens de bonnes familles ,d'ou une ambiance plus respectueuse...Tout le monde est assis, personne ne crie trop fort...

It's a true story about Vince Papale and the things he faced going to the NFL without college or as you say the combine which college players go to when they are going pro.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Yes.  It is weird, but no teams are set in stone locked into the combine.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	well that pretty much is the final tryout... <br>  <br>  they base it on what they saw in college, and when you go in for your combine interviews.. <br>  <br>  there aren't any other tryouts.. <br>  <br>  there are tryouts for first string and second string, but you still have to get on the team before that..|`|l5V76duIaa	Some teams hold open tryouts, The combine is not really a try-out, its just gathering numbers on players to draft. players can still play in the NFL without being drafted. i.e. Tony Romo. The chances of being a prominent NFL star without being invited to the combine are slim. The only example of a team having open to the public tryouts is the eagles. The movie INVINCIBLE is based on a true story. Players can make it to the NFL by being on a practice squad as an undrafted free agentex|`|umzHIafDaa	combine is like the half way point in trying out for the nfl. After the combine there is still a pro day which each college holds. Pro day is when scouts come to the schools of these players and the players do the same drill as they would have done at the combine. This is why players like michael crabtree who didnt go to the combine can still perform for the scouts at his pro day.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	yes

At least your Manager playes your good players and doesn't crap players.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	yes it is all due to   problem in board  trying to beat a pro in his own games  letting the board interrupt  not seeing things  believing every season as own    FQ sack your manager  pray for some oil money|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Wigan fan here , what would worry me about Liverpool is the fact that they controlled a lot of the game , and did nothing with their possession - it was a **** Performance by us , but after losing our two main players it is going to be harder .

Liverpool rarely lose, but unfortunately Rafa's strategy tends to be to play it safe and simply hold on for the draw. Substitutes are made far too late in the game to be effective and there is little or no urgency in pressing for a winner, or more importantly, pushing for a second or third goal when one-nil up. Liverpool are still in the title race and they certainly have the talent to be title contenders up until the last day in May, but Rafa needs to alter his thinking and be more ruthless when it comes to finishing off teams.|`|AA12220155	i am a man u fan  but honestly i think that liverpool aren't strong enough. everyone in december was saying that they will win the epl this season, but its all about consistency.   rafa is making it worse. i mean taking off gerrard... lol.   he was like the pool's only hope for a late goal.   but they just have to get over it. thats wat manu did. they had such a bad start to the epl and look at them now, no. 1 with a new clean sheet record..

So since the Chargers survived the 1st round it proves they belong cause most 8-8 teams get weeded out but I guess not.

Secondly, the Chargers won their division (again), so that means at least 3 other teams are worse.    Thirdly, as so many others have already pointed out, this past season was a historic failure for the Detroit Lions, and since the Lions are NOT one of the other teams in the Chargers' division, that brings the tally up to 4.

YLvTNF08aa	It happens to some great people. People get their time in the spotlight and then they just don't care anymore and stop trying to become something more or contribute to society.    If you don't want to end up like this, then it is important to take pride in your work and don't do useless things that you feel aren't important to you because you may feel like none of your work is important if you do.
ZAh8CEoGaa	Never ever show the person that he got in to you because that means he won his game ad that you lost more than just that.

19TupZ8Naa	If you get hit hard in the face by a hook or a right you will be dazed, but do not back up. That is the worst possible thing to do. If you back up, the enemy has a tremendous advantage. What you wanna do when you're dazed is get in close and kind of hug him till you recover.    The reason for this is, if you back up he has the range to get really powerful follow up shots. Shots with KO potential. When you are holding on to him, he will still be trying to hit you, but they aren't going to KO you. He simply will not have the range to put his hips into the punchs and they will be very weak.    If you get hit square in the face with enough force to daze you, then his follow up shots are going to hurt. A lot. You can take shots in the face sometimes and not be dazed, but when you go up against strong guys with good form; then it's something to seriously look out for.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	its almost as important being able to take a punch as how to throw a punch.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	It's already been said but it boils down to experience. If you've never been hit hard in the face chances are when it happens you'll be stunned. You're mind will keep thinking "oh my god I've just been punched in the face, what do I do?" I'm sure your opponent won't give you a lot of time to compose yourself so he'll rush in to continue which generally only makes things worse.    Some people just have insticts to get out of the way when hit hard. It's rare but I've seen it enough from people with zero fight training. Fight training itself should condition you to a point where you can function when hit.    If you haven't conditioned yourself enough though, when the time comes your natural instincts will prevail and that for many people will get them clobbered.|`|v1mbL56caa	depends. How hard, where, how well you trained. Blanket statements like that have no correct answer.|`|lcTR9vLMaa	It really comes down to whether your in the correct mental state, when it happens.  If you are, and it doesnt KO you then you'll be ready to attack.  If your not in the fight state of mind, your mind can only register flee and take cover & you WILL take a beating, until he tires and stops.|`|42SDcehQaa	Well even a light jab to the face would give you a sudden pause and that sudden pause would slow you down since most of the time, you weren't expecting to get hit. Also, if your opponent has big punches and keeps swinging at you, it'll be hard to throw something back while you're blocking because you'll be taking the risk of getting hit and rocked or even knocked out in worse case scenario. And I think the policeman you were talking to was talking about getting hit in the face. Not much people would aim for your abs especially out on the streets. They would go for your face.    PS: There are people that can retaliate right away after some punches but I don't know if you can and you seem to not know that either. Just ask yourself or just think whether you can think clearly while you're getting hit or throw a punch right back right after you get hit in the face.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I remember the first time I got hit in the face. Yes, it was pretty much like that.    The thing is though if you train full contact you do not really have that problem as bad as some one who only point spars. I get hit and hit hard in the face by some big guys, so I have learned how to compose myself when I am hurt, or am learning anyways.     It all boils down to experience. Have you trained for it. Do you go through it often. Do you have stellar abs that protect your face, lol.

Laporte, il se contente de slectionner parmi les joueurs disponibles (ce n'est pas lui qui dcide de la vocation des jeunes sportifs).

ZAh8CEoGaa	The Cavaliers are full of confidence right now after that Kings win with Mo and James running the show. Though Howard will cause a lot of problems because the Cavs are without Big Z. They will need to send double teams on him and try send him to the line alot. But I would pick the Cavaliers to win by 6, 104-98.|`|P93I8CHtaa	Cavs,because orlando is not playing good right now and the cavs are playing at their best right now,and they are atop of the NBA mountain|`|N3AiQRJFaa	The L train can not be stopped by this superman, Cavs will win in a close game and i also heard big Z might be coming back.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	Magic|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Cavs. Big Z is back.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	The Cavs, cuz they be gooder than hell.|`|8EbINm3gaa	Cavs in a close one king james is just to much to handel|`|sCiuv7n3aa	The King would make SUPERMAN kiss his heels :D    King James is the King of BBALL... he's just unstoppable when he drives....

SRSLY|`|PHoyqLN9aa	Cleveland will win.  I'm putting $1000 on it on sportsline.com|`|pjRnFrexaa	If ever Lewis and/or Howard could handle King James, they sure are to win the game. Another problem is Mo Williams. One time he scored 40+ points on a game with Sacramento this week. The Magic should try to improve their outside defense to win the game.|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Magic might just edge it out but quite barely, they are right now the BEST away team but not doing as good at home. The cavaliers are the BEST home team but terrible away team.|`|gozr4i4raa	My money's on the cavs, but in low amounts.  Magic have a better PPG average, so putting the ball in the basket won't be a problem for them.  Obviously the Cavs still have James & Howard, so they'll have no problem scoring.    I've got The Cavs win 103-101.    I bet money line cavs and overall points over 196.    The game is either going to be really high scoring, or really low scoring.  I'm leaning towards the high, as both teams have better offense than defense.|`|3TO1rWk3aa	yo who ever it was that bet 1000 on that game for cavs to win, GUESS WHAT 99-88  MAGIC! go home
ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Si Alonso quitte McLaren c'est pas encore certain qu'il ira chez Renault, il pourrait peut-tre remplacer Massa ce serait possible. Sauber ne lachera pas Nick Heidfeld (56points)?a c'est certain c'est leur meilleur pilote, peut-tre Kubica (33points). Je pense que Renault gardera Heikki Kovalainen (plus jeune et plus performant que Fisichella) si Alonso arrive, out Fisico. Mme cas pour Williams, Nico Rosberg est plus performant que Wurz qui arrive en fin de carrire sans gloire. Pourquoi ne pas envisager le retour de Coulthard, il est rest en bon terme avec McLaren, il est performant, il pourrait faire une bonne jointure en attendant qu'un autre se libre (Bourdais par exemple) si j'tais Ron, je laisserai Bourdais s'aguerrir puis le rcuprer dans un an ou deux.

Je pense que McLaren se tournerait vers un jeune pilote comme Nico Rosberg ou Robert Kubica qui malgr leur jeune age ont dj prouv qu'ils avaient de grandes qualits.  Il serait difficile de faire cohabiter Hamilton et Button, les deux vedettes britanniques. Massa est un pilote ferrari depuis longtemps avec son passage chez Sauber. Heidfeld est un bon pilote mais pas du calibre d'un top team. Bourdais a dj sign chez Toro Rosso et n'a pas encore fais ses preuves en F1. Piquet est un pilote Renault et au vu des derniers venements (soup?on d'espionnage de la part de Renault), il serait tonnant que Renault cde l'un de ses pilotes  McLaren.

904c2e2d2e948b81e1f13159e8e5519faa	Es bueno ver jugadores sudamericanos jugando un torneo de Grand Slam como es el Roland Garros. Que se gane poco a poco el espacio necesario entre los grandes del deporte blanco.   En cuanto a su juego un poco ortodoxo y mas bien practico comparado con el estilo de juego de ahora pues nos hace pensar que ese tipo de jugadores puede apelar a un juego de fondo tipo Bj?rn Bj?rn en sus a?os mozos con golpes de paralelos y cruzados  precisos y muy contundentes. Parecera un jugo muy sui generis para estas generaciones pero muy clsico y conservador para los que muchas veces vimos y apreciamos grandes exponentes de esta disciplina. Un juego sin fiorituras con jugadas de antologa a base de slices, smashes, drof , ataques de red o hasta en los mismos aces hoy en da sera algo aburrido. Jugadas que demanden gran esfuerzo y tcnica son sin duda dignas de apreciar y hasta de emular en un juego de aficionados. Esperemos que la presentancin del peruano Luis Horna y del Uruguayo Pablo Cuevas en el torneo francs hayan logrado   por lo menos ?evocar? aquellos viejos tiempos del tenis clsico. Algo dificil de olvidar entre verdaderos aficionados del tenis?     ottomies@suomi24.fi|`|7KVnyPi3aa	Como uruguaya me alegro, con lo difcil (sobre todo por lo econmico)y competitivo que es tenis el haber ganado le va a dar otras perspectivas econmicas para poder participar en diferentes torneos.

ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	J'ai une peur vicerale de l'eau des que je n'ai plus pied, j'explique cela par le fait que j'ai failli me noyer vers l'age de 4 ans et que j'en garde les images. A l'armee ils y ont ete a la lance incendie pour me faire plonger dans la piscine, j'ai jamais gueule autant. Ceci dit avec un masque et des bouteilles j'ai fait un essai j'ai pas peur de me noyer. j'ai remarque que quand je perd pied je panique et mon seul soucis est de respirer.    Le corps humain a une flotabilite positive, mais limite. Je sais que si quelqu'un est dans l'eau il va flotter naturellement mais si il leve les bras, il coule car le fait de lever les bras fait passer le corps en flotablilite negative puisque les bras ne servent plus de "bouee".|`|dznKn7ITaa	D'aussi loin que je me rappelle je n'ai jamais eu peur de l'eau et au fil des annes j'en ai fais ma passion...c'est pourquoi je trouve cela triste de lire que des personnes en ont peur...vous loupez de sacres sensations!

Si la France bat la Gorgie avec bonus elle finit  15 points  Si l'Argentine bat la Namibie avec bonus elle arrive  14 points, il lui suffirait de marquer un point de bonus contre l'Irlande (4 essais ou dfaite par moins de 7 points) pour terminer en tte du groupe.    Je suis d'accord de toute fa?on, les blacks il faut bien les battre pour gagner la Coupe du Monde. Peut-tre vaut-il mieux les affronter en 1/4, car ils sortiront d'une poule o ils auront rencontr des quipes faibles (Italie et Ecosse alignant leur quipe B). Ils pourraient avoir un problme de rythme.  Cardiff est un endroit magique pour le rugby, nul doute que les gallois supporteront les fran?ais, alors il ne faut pas se prendre la tte.|`|bmOuG7eSaa	Tous les calculs possibles ont t fait donc je ne vais pas revenir l dessus. un e chose par contre sur laquelle j'aimerais revenir, c'est sur le " vaut il mieux jouer les blacks en 1/4 ou en finale" ? Oh les cocos, les blacks ils ont aussi des matchs a jouer avant d'arriver  la finale, et pour mmoire, 5 coupe du monde, 1 seul titre pour la NZ. Donc svp, ne faites pas les matchs avant l'heure ! Je suis d'accord que cette anne, ils sont particulirement impressionnant mais comme ?a a t dit plus t?t, il n'ont pas jouer de grance quipe au top de leur "art", donc attendons.|`|L1h0Sg7Yaa	ne nous voilons pas la face, les blacks nous attendent, et nous nous avons une revanche  prendre contre eux pour les deux dfaites de cet automne!!!

ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Je pense que Lewis a de trs grande chances d'tre champion du monde, il va baser sa stratgie sur le marquage de points pas sur les victoires, autrement dit il va pas prendre de risque.    Regardez les rsultats, lors des GP ou Alonso avait fini devant  Lewis    Australie      + 2 points  Malaisie       + 2 points  Monaco        + 2 points  Angleterre    + 2 points  Turquie         + 2 points  Italie              + 2 points  Belgique       + 1 point    Allemagne    + 10 points Victime d'une crevaison.    Bref sauf incident mcanique, Lewis peur s'offrir le luxe de finir derrire Alonso  moins de 6 points. La prise de risque est pour Alonso, Lewis va assurer.  C'est courru d'avance.    Article sur  Lewis du 27 septembre :    Hamilton est galement conscient que les deux dernires course au calendrier (GP de Chine et du Brsil) risquent de favoriser Alonso car il connait les circuits, mais prcise que cela ne la pas empch de battre Alonso par le pass:    LH: "Il connait Shanghai tres bien et il connait le Brsil trs bien mais cela ne ma pas empch de le battre  dautres endroits. Je ne suis pas inquiet.  Cest difficile de prvoir ce qui va se passer lors de la de la prochaine course. Il se peut que lun de nous deux fasse une mauvaise course et ?a ?a pourrait vraiment pimenter les choses.  La cl pour moi est de juste massurer de finir dans le top 3, faire le maximum de points et gagner de prfrence. "    Sa priorit c'est les points il l'a dit clairement.    Bravo lewis|`|a881ccf038f5df30e63afe9cef924cf7aa	ben oui tout est toujours possible tant que mathmatiquement c'est possible c'est encore possible.|`|e3e738cd65fe1b458908b9fe3030e85daa	oui car il n'a que 12 points de retard mais bon i faudrait que Lewis ne fasse pas de bon rsultats et mme si je le souhaite je ne pense pas que ce soit possible.|`|9c0d9384a9a5046faba2e1045a7b2d9aaa	cela parait exclus...        ps : @Mariana, depuis que les pilotes (comme Hamilton) ont des gueules d'amour.  c'est vrai qu'il aurait pu faire carrire dans un boys band...    @TRIGREPG : pour Renault, of courses !  mais ce ne sera une surprise pour personne.|`|0tJypYJyaa	12 points d'avance  2 grand prix de la fin, il suffit que Hamilton soit devant Alonso  l'une des deux dernires courses.|`|N07fvAteaa	Sauf casse d'hamilton, je vois pas comment Alonso peut revenir.|`|471f21b33e7803aeb41041be6eb6c1a9aa	Malheureusement cela parait bien compromis.

Hamilton n'est pas  l'abri d'une panne mcanique ou d'une erreur de pilotage. Mais il ne fait aucun doute que McLaren fera son possible pour offrir le titre  son pilote britannique.  Attention toutefois car Alonso a une grande eprience et le circuit du Brsil est trs spcifique et peut tre l'arbitre de cette fin de saison.|`|tvS6JnbJaa	Mathmatiquement oui et Hamilton n'est pas a l'abri ni d'une casse ni d'une sortie de piste, sportivement c'est autre chose Lewis mrite largement d'tre devant le tricheur, et malheureusement Kimi est un peu loin alors je pense que nous aurons un trs jeune champion du monde 2007.

Et il faudrait aussi respecter les fans de joueurs d'autres pays ! xD|`|USAe8Flgaa	Je suis assez d'accord mais ce qui m'nerve surtout ce sont les commentaires qui manquent cruellement d'objectivit.

Et j'ai vu en partie les matches de Robredo contre Stepanek et Ferrer contre Hewitt (le cinquime set en entier notamment).

Si on veut plus de voitures en course il faut d'une part limiter les budgets et investissements qui sont trs levs et d'autre part rendre plus accssible le "droit" d'inscription et de participation (je ne connais pas les termes exacts) ce qui est  mon humble avis plus simple|`|8b4980b396e6b78a3edcde8abe20cc24aa	Pas bien compris l...    Mais si je crois comprendre, tu voudrais associer 2 curies, style Ferrari et Toro Rosso ou Toyota et Honda...    Le soucis c'est que ce n'est plus la F1 des annes 80 et 90 o les artisans britanniques dominent la Formule 1...    L ce sont de grands constructeurs automobiles, de vrais marques, c'est un vritable enjeu industriel, doubl d'un enjeu national.  Ferrari, c'est le groupe Fiat, toute l'Italie de l'automobile.  Renault, c'est le groupe Renault, un des 2 groupes Fran?ais.  Honda et Toyota, 2 des constructeurs majeurs Japonais  BMW, un des groupes Allemands...

Je prefere qu'il est est une quipe par chaque participant et voir plus de constructeur afin qu'il y est plus de bataille et non un team comme Spyker (indian force) qui change de nom tous les ans depuis 2-3 ans.

mDnh0itnaa	I think none of them are.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	If anyone does, I would say maybe the White Sox against an inexperienced Rays team, or maybe the Brewers like you said, but in all honesty, I don't think any of them will.|`|vRmsvSb6aa	I don't think any of them do. I think the Cubs might win one game, but they are all done. The reason the Brewers beat the Cubs was because that game didn't matter to the Cubs. Win or lose they won the division.|`|cmQGa5fcaa	I don't know about that. I believe the cubs have the better chance despite losing their home field advantage. But they still have a better team all around. The brewers don't have a great rotation going into the playoffs since ben sheets is out and CC blew his first playoff game as a brewer. The White sox are a little over rated because I know they have an awesome line up and they have a pretty good pitching staff, but the rays beat them in every aspect of it. The angels are pretty much done because they are going up against Josh Beckett at Fenway and Beckett beasts the playoffs. The Brewers i still dont believe that they can make a comeback just because they are at home. Dave Bush does not replace a Ben Sheets. Philles are an all around better team thean the brewers. I think the Cubs have a better chance due to three things. One is that they have the best starting rotation in the majors and they have Rich Harden pitching for them. Two is the only reason why the Dodgers won the first two games is because they took advantage of the Cubs errors. For example, Game 1, Dempster had major control issues. Game 2 the cubs gave up too many errors which killed them. And the Third is that the offense of the cubs is a hell of a lot better than the dodgers. They just need to get their act together and start playing like a playoff team would/    Hope this Helps!!!!|`|LlKgy0DIaa	The Cubs for two reasons:    1. They aren't at Wrigley. It sounds odd, but there was so much pressure at The Friendly Confines and they buckled.     2. The Cubs have better pitchers for the next two games.    I think they can do it. I believe.|`|TCehI17kaa	I still think the Cubs have a chance.|`|290OPLfuaa	The Halos. I am not an Anges fan in anyway; however, they have the talent, the firepower, the speed, the pitching, the fans, the bench depth, the closer and the manager to be able to come back.    |`|unuRJFuWaa	probably none of them but i would have to go with you and the brewers|`|c56fLEzqaa	Based on the most recent history, you have to give the White Sox the edge.  They were down to Minnesota in the standings and forced a playoff-and won the division.  The Cubs also have great opportunity to stay alive, they'll have Harden on the mound in game 3.|`|21d17f4c60a61d15b5cf4cac5cc83b14aa	I believe on the Halos and the Cubs. |`|DZ1SQDVyaa	CUBS!|`|efVqEvbqaa	angels.  They still have solid pitching staff and there offense is starting to come around.  Aside from this dont forget that the Angels had the best record on the road this season winning 50 games and the same record they had at home.
XaFYUMRSaa	Dodgers have better hitting ,better pitching!!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Simple answer.....they're getting outplayed.|`|DZ1SQDVyaa	its only temporary the cubs will win today|`|LlKgy0DIaa	it's because they got nervous because everyone was saying "oh te Cubs will definitely win the world series" and with the "100 years of loosing" they are very conscious. but i think that they could do it. they have Harden going today and Ted Lilly tomorrow, and they aren't at home so they don't have all that pressure,    We can do it. I BELIEVE. and you should too.|`|290OPLfuaa	The Cubs are a great team with tons of talent. What's happening here is choking, pressure, and a little luck.    The dodgers on the other hand are not as good on paper. However, they are playing with fun and very loose. Then again, Manny and Casey were not in the roster all year for the Dodgers.     The Dodgers feel that the Cubs are the ones with the pressure on them and they are right!    Cubs may win today but they won't be moving on, out of this series.    Better luck next year Lou!  |`|G4wGCghdaa	Wasn't just Cubs fans. Quite a few magazines, analysts, and former players had them at least going there. Look at the Angels who beat the Red Sox 8 out 9 during the season. They were also picked by many to win it all and are also in the same position as the Cubs.   |`|putJ4kZCaa	season wins mean nothing in the playoffs.

mRD1xDTMaa	arrter le seul tour de France ne servirait  rien  en fait, c'est l'ensemble des courses professionnelles qu'il faudrait arrter pendant 3 ou 4 ans  le temps de laisser "purifier" par la disparition du fric  le problme, c'est que le cyclisme est gangren par un tat d'esprit hypocrite qui n'est pas prs de dispara?tre  un certain nombre de gens font des efforts, c'est incontestable  malheureusement, ils ne servent que d'alibi  toute une arme de tricheurs  comment peut-on admettre que les 2/3 des coureurs soient officiellement reconnus asthmatiques ?  comment peut-on admettre qu'un coureur, tricheur reconnu et puni, puisse commenter l'preuve sur une radio nationale ?  j'entendais en dbut d'aprs midi Fignon et un journaliste commenter l'affaire ricco et dire que des rumeurs courraient    quoi servent les journalistes s'ils ne sont pas capables de mettre  jour ces rumeurs, qu'on fait les dirigeants qui doivent aussi les entendre ?  bien sur, on a puni trois coureurs, probablement on en prendra encore deux ou trois autres d'ici la fin  ensuite on passera le maillot jaune  un vainqueur sur les champs elyses pour le lui enlever en catimini dans six mois    quelle pantalonnade !!!|`|17ed409fc2e002c6d73cbd378cd5609caa	Si on trouve des tricheurs sur le Tour de France c'est parce que les organisateurs emploient les methodes pour les trouver.  Dans les autres epreuves cyclistes la volonte d'arreter le dopage n'est pas aussi forte (euphemisme). Et c'est pareil pour les autres sports a commencer par l'athletisme.   Si le labo qui teste les coureurs sur le Tour etait employe aux prochains JO on aurait bien des surprises.  Alors pour repondre a la question, non il ne faut pas arreter le Tour de France, c'est meme la seule epreuve qui ait de la valeur car c'est la seule qui se donne les moyens d'arreter les tricheurs.|`|MzaeT9OIaa	100 fois non !  Il y a 10 ans et avec l'affaire Festina, le tour de France a t forc de combattre le dopage.  Rsultats :  - on a dcim une gnration de cyclistes fran?ais et maintenant on est une nation de 2nd rang  - les allemands et les italiens s'y sont mis aussi (cf le nombre de coureurs dans les 30 premiers)  - les espagnols vont commenc  s'y mettre aussi et ?a va leur faire trs mal car ils n'ont pas fait le mnage aprs l'affaire Puerto  - les russes, ex-russes et les amricains seront les prochains dans le collimateur (cf Vinokourov)  - on trouve par des contr?les anti-dopage des coureurs qu'autrefois on ne pouvait que soup?onner (cf Rico).  - l'uci commence enfin  combattre le dopage avec le passeport biologique, arme trs efficace  - les sponsors ferment de moins en moins les yeux car si leur quipe est attrap, en plus d'avoir leur image ternie, ils ne peuvent pas participer au tour de France de l'anne suivante (cf Astana)  - le tour est une pruve o le dopage a toujours exist, mais les vitesses moyennes baissent ce qui prouvent que celui-ci recule|`|Okaexmj2aa	et toutes les autres preuves sportives tant que tu y est? et je ne pense pas que le sponsor saunier duval sorte grandi de cette histoire. Alors arrtons de dire que les sponsors forcent les coureurs  se doper!|`|Zfeast5Raa	Clairement non. Les organisateurs du Tour et AFLD font un travail extraordinaire depuis plusieurs saisons qui commence  porter ses fruits. A prsent, les contr?les sont de plus en plus performant et n'ont plus de retard sur les tricheurs.

Hace un par de fechas del Apertura que le dije a mi viejo (tambien bostero, of corse!) que mejor que Russo llevara a la 3ra, que preferia perder con los pibes de reserva por 10 goles y no con la primera por 2 / 3 o 4 goles de dif. Pero Russo no emboca una. Boquita no puede tener un tecnico que no puede ganar ni 3 partidos seguidos. Prefiero al Grande, a Bianchi, aunq muchas veces ganara en penales y sufriendo.  Que se vaya Russo y que se queden los jugadores que rindan, y los que no que prueben por otro lado. Boca no esta para experimentos raros.  >>>>Dany desde Australia (no pude ver el partido, pero hubiera preferido que gane Boca jugando mal, a que juegue bien poniendo huevo y perder por varios goles).

piZ4xDBqaa	I don't think they will, but if the do, it's because...    Pop manages minutes again, and gets them into the postseason healthy and on a roll.    Duncan, Parker, and Ginoboli are all at 100%.    Finley and Bowen are more active because the postseason is less of a grind.    Mason and/or Hill become valuable contributors.    If they can get all that, then I see a rematch with LA deciding who will represent the West.  I'd still pick the Lakers, but a healthy Ginoboli and some hardnosed defense could at least make the Lakers blink.  If the Spurs can get a lucky break or three on top of that, then they're in the Finals.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	OMG. NO way and I am a huge Spurs fan. Reality tells me for the longest though, that despite their good D, and as good as the Big 3 are and the bench, until they get that Big Man to rebound and score each and every night to assist Duncan, they wil continue to struggle against the equally Big( bigger) men teams. They often get out rebounded these days and puts way too much pressure on scoring all the time. Croshere, Oberto, Thomas are NOT the answer they need.No doubt aplayoff a contender, but a short playoff run at best without that strong rebounder/scorer.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	I hope they beat the Lakers but I truely believe the Cavaliers will win a title this year.|`|r2tX0MIfaa	it won't happen. spurs should start rebuilding!|`|P93I8CHtaa	they wont,the lakers will|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Fans will defend their team because your question is just plain stupid.|`|LdIgg7yTaa	They won't! But I suppose I should be honest and tell you this is coming from a Suns fan...|`|dtq32xuwaa	no. manu got injured too early and will get injured again for sure.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	U TELL ME WHY WILL THEY WIN??      They Wont LAKERS WILL|`|vzH7f7V5aa	They will Lose to the Cavs.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	well if they do its because of their team defense. ITs not how many points you can score its how many points you allow to be scored.     what a shocker the best defensive team in the league last year won an NBA Championship (the Celtics). someone should get that memo to Phoenix ASAP.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	It time for someone to step up in SPURS... because Tony and Manu are kinda SLOW after they got their injuries... MASON is one... Duncan still consistent.... I hope Bruce would return to his starting role...     Srsly... I want to see Parker and Manu explode at the start of the 2nd half of the season (after allstars) to make it more believable for SPURS TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP....|`|l0QinWFGaa	I'm a spurs fan, and I'm probably gonna sound little biased when I say this, but the spurs are the sh*t.  When the playoffs come, the spurs will be a different teams on the court, the only team that will give them a challenge will be the lakers.  Celtics won't make it to the finals this year, garnet is getting old and you can tell by the way he is playing, cavs will smash them.  But the biggest factor in determining whether lakers win the lakers-spurs series is if bynum can step it up and play good ball consistently.  Duncan will play well in the series, always does, and ginobili is still recovering from his injury and  should be back to his old self by post season time.  This is gonna be the year spurs get there fifth ring.|`|piWK49fAaa	they will only win if the lakers, celtics, cavs, and magic get injuries to their top players. other than that, they won't get past the west finals.|`|BAAehgWlaa	NO, THEY WONT     ITS     CAVS  LAKERS  MAGIC  AND  HORNET|`|ctraoPNMaa	Dont the spurs play English football????????
mK06dus9aa	Maybe Henry will not do enough to be included, the other 4 stand a great chance|`|AyHo8rnKaa	actually nope. I have already tought of that and I am pretty sure it is gonna happen.  we know for sure Messi is gonna be the best, no question.  Eto'o, definitely up there as well, with all the goals he scored this season, if he ain't, I dye.  Alves as well for sure, he's got to be. has been absolutely fantastic this season, maybe the second best player in Barca (after Messi.)  Xavi, probably up there as well but unlike the 3 others, I am not very confident he will be in the top 5. he will make the top 10 though, no question.  Henry, I am not so sure, but if he keeps his form up, he definitely can.  maybe Puyol will be up there somewhere as well.|`|1NwjxaVZaa	nah bro  sum good players come from man utd or real madrid or ac milan or inter milan  not all of them would come from barca   but hey thats just my opinion|`|W9l1Y6pPaa	I agree with Bloosboy.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	no not even as a man u fan  high  very high  i'd reckon vidic may join from man u  giggs/VDS/ronaldo have a decent chance  idk about others

AA12172407	If you are skating hard and making things happen, (see Ovechkin, Zetterberg, and Iginla), 45-50 seconds comes hard.    If you are a defenseman who makes things happen, yet stays in position, 1.00-1.15 is expected.    If you are a figure skater and out there taking up space, (see Lang and Riberio), 1.30 is possible.    If you are a midget, Gionta, you're working double-hard just to keep up with Joe Average- 30 seconds tops! hehe|`|UhL7m301aa	On the PP around 1 minute    On the PK as long as it takes to clear the zone (over 30 seconds)    At even strength I think most coaches like it short between 30 and 45 seconds for forwards    It laregly depends on where the play is tho, if you are pinned in your zone or getting a lot of quality chances it will often times run over those marks|`|gx4s68s8aa	45 seconds is the optimum for most players.  Although some players (like many defensive players) can stay out for 60 seconds.  After 60 seconds the quality of play really goes down considerably.  And this is generally true for NHL players and your average weekend warrior type of hockey player.|`|z93tSvKxaa	1 minute.|`|axxQzOCHaa	45 seconds for Forwards (LW, C, RW)  1 minute for Defencemen (LD and RD)|`|5UIsGjxCaa	Using my trusty calculator and NHL.com-stats. I found that for the average forward (top scorers) the shift is between 45 and 55 seconds with 2 exceptions.   For defensemen the average shift is between 55 and 60 seconds.   The two exceptions are the Russian ice hogs Ovechkin and Kovalchuk. They average about 10 seconds a shift longer than the other players in the league.   One anomaly in the whole system is Ray Whitney. His average shift is 6 seconds longer than any other defenseman.|`|ZNFjSlKvaa	Coach always says keep them short to stay fresh. 30-40 seconds.  You should have enough steam to go one way, and then back. If your sprinting the entire time its harder than it looks to stay out for a while.|`|TcNqfaGzaa	I would say about 45 seconds|`|HNEWf7ILaa	45 seconds to a minute.|`|XuGFt3boaa	A minute or two, depends if your on even strength, power play, or a penalty kill.|`|ppFQazEoaa	In NHL it's about 30-45 seconds.  Trust me, I've gone to a game before with a timer just to see.  They try to take short shifts so you never get really tired.
iCKcU6luaa	luongo. and to the guy who said luongo should be focusing on net, luongo doesnt wear a C on his jersey.    There is a player who deals with the on ice part and the refs, but off ice and in the dressing room Luongo leads the team and plays role of the captain.    The coach felt in practices and off ice time, Luono seemed to be in charge and everyone would listen to him. He was the leader.      This means that Luongo is captain in every way other than the game time dealing with officials.      SO basicly Luongo is the captain exept when the team needs to talk to the refs, another player (forget who) will talk to the refs and worry about that part|`|76nTvO4iaa	Roberto Luongo|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Roberto Luongo|`|O5Q4GP59aa	The dude that let in 4 tonight.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Alexander Steen|`|G33E41IBaa	Roberto Luongo.|`|UoUaO52taa	Roberto Luongo.

Pour etre aller au stadium de Toulouse voir Fidji-Japon, l'esprit rugby est bien present pour cette coupe du monde, quand tu vois un stadium plein a craquer qui fait la "olla" et encourage les deux equipes ca fait plaisir a voir. Maintenant, si pour evaluer une coupe du monde tu t'arretes a TF1, c'est dommage. Quant a la recuperation politique le plus bvel exemple reste le foot en 98 mais comme on a gagne ca ne choque personne.  Concernant les commentaires je prefere encore ceux de TF1 qui expliquent bien les regles et le pourquoi des fautes que les pauvres expressions partisanes de Salviac.  Si je peux me permettre de te donner un conseil: vas dans la rue ou encore meiux dans un stade et tu verras l'effet coupe du monde de rugby loin de la politique et de TF1.|`|S1jy6HYXaa	C'est vrai que Gilardi soule un peu !

83ee4d019751f9909000b1266c313744aa	Je me permets de glisser galement mon grain de sel dans cette affaire. Platini ou Henry ?    Pour moi il n'y a gure de doute sur l'efficacit de l'un par rapport  l'autre. Michel Platini, avec beaucoup moins de slections, a marqu beaucoup de buts sous le maillot bleu. Henry en 95 slections en a inscrit 2 de plus et il aggravera sans nul doute son avance vu son age et les chances  venir.     Mais pour autant Michel a beaucoup, beaucoup plus de mrite de les avoir inscrits que Thierry. Platini est et restera encore longtemps le plus grand d'entre tous. Je m'explique :    A l'poque de Platini il n'y avait pas autant de matchs de qualifications dans la zone Europe. Des quipes comme la Lituanie, la Georgie, la Serbie etc. n'ont vu le jour que depuis une bonne quinzaine d'annes (clatement du bloc de l'est, indpendance des tats). Donc plus de matches  jouer en qualifications. Il y a 30 ans en arrire l'EDF jouait des VRAIS matchs de football contre des quipes de niveau international comme par exemple : les Pays-Bas, l'Eire, la Bulgarie, la Yougoslavie, la Belgique, la Sude, etc. Bien sur Thierry Henry n'y est pour rien dans le fait que l'EDF depuis quinze ans joue des matchs de second rang en qualification contre des quipes du type des ?les Froes ou Andorre etc. Ce n'est pas son problme, il joue les matchs qu'on lui donne et il marque tout ce quil peut. Et cest tout..    Plus de matchs contre des quipes beaucoup moins fortes que celles rencontres  l'poque de Michel Platini ont permis  Thierry Henry de s'emparer du record de Platoche. Tant mieux pour lui. Reste le ratio but par match. Michel est encore devant. Pour combien de temps ?    Platini a encore un PLUS sur le gamin Thierry Henry. Il jouait derrire les attaquants et marquait des buts dun autre monde. Des buts galement plus quimportant. France-Pays Bas 1981, France  Yougoslavie 1986, Championnat dEurope 1984 (9 buts) et jen passe et des meilleurs Les adversaires de Michel Platini taient galement dune autre pointure que ceux daujourdhui. Les Breitner, Gentile, Briegel, Kroll, Tardelli etc. chez les dfenseurs. Maradona, Socrates, Zico, Matthaus, Rummenigge, Butragueno, Lineker, etc. pour les gnies. Zoff, Pfaff, Dassaev, Schumacher, Fillol, Shilton, etc. pour les gardiens. Ctait pas le tout venant daujourdhui, non ?    Les coquipiers des Platini ntaient pas non plus des culs de jattes. Giresse, Bossis, Fernandez, Tigana, Rocheteau, etc. Ils nont pas beaucoup de buts en slections ? Et alors ? Cela confirme bien mes propos antrieurs. Peu de matchs donc peu de slections donc peu de buts. Elmentaire, non ?     On ne refera pas lhistoire ce soir. Thierry Henry est le meilleur buteur de lhistoire des bleus. Et cest trs bien comme ?a. Michel Platini est quant  lui le meilleur joueur fran?ais de tous les temps et un des cinq meilleurs au monde avec Pel, Maradona, Cruyff et Zico Pardon  Mr Zidane mais sa gnration manquait tout simplement de romantisme et de simplicit. Zizou tait bien le seul  apporter un peu de gnie et de beaut  ce jeu qui mrite bien autre chose que tous ces millions duros dpenss chaque semaine par caprice, vanit et cupidit    Si Trezeguet a t tacl par Henry ? Pas de fa?on limpide selon moi. Mais il a bien profit de son entente cordiale avec le dmon Domenech. Il a essay d'enterrer Zidane quand celui-ci a tir une premire fois sa rvrence. Il a failli succomber  un infarctus quand il apprit que Zizou ressuscitait. Henry veut briller dans la lumire mais il veut aussi que cette lumire soit bien sur lui et pas trop  c?t. Cest une personnalit trs peu apprci par ses pairs notamment pour cette raison. Ce qui ne lui retire en rien son talent. David paye galement ses erreurs ou plut?t ses choix (Juventus 2me division).    En conclusion :    Merci Platoche pour tous ces fabuleux moments qui ont marqu ma prime jeunesse. Jai 34 ans et je ne suis pas prt doublier cette fameuse 52me minute de ce France  Hollande du 18 novembre 1981 quand ton coup franc sen est all se loger hors de port des gants de Van Breukelen sous les ? Oui Michel, Oui Michel ? de Jean Michel Larqu. Quelle motion. Quelle poque  Bises  Tous les amoureux de ces moments l ou le football ressemblait  quelque chose. Ou les joueurs savaient faire un contr?le et une passe. Ou on pouvait approcher nos idoles  la sortie du stade et refaire avec eux le match Putain que cest con de vieillir, non ?|`|o2MbgnE2aa	C'est clair qu'Henry n'est pas Platini. Le seul qui peut se comparer a Platini est Zidane, et amon avis meme ca est exagere (Platini etait un vrai meneur d'hommes).    Mais ca n'empeche qu'il a marque beaucoup de goals, et qu'il est un sacre bon joueur, qu'on a vu venir depuis tout jeune.    C'est vrai qu'il a beneficie aussi d'une bonne periode de l'equipe de France. Aucune autre generation n'a connu 3 finales de tournoi !!! Ca fait du chiffre !!    Quant a Trezeguet, je crois simplement que son style etait moins adapte aux Bleus, ou aux systemes mis en place par les selectionneurs. Il est tres bon aussi, moins spectaculaire, t il a eu moins de chance avec les Bleus.|`|afff3406542cfebc1afe527cdc532873aa	Raisonement incohrent !!!! Il ny a pas de comparaison de ce genre  faire....  Il ne sert  rien de comparer des pourcentages;aussi justes soit il; lorsque l'on recense simplement le nombre de buts inscrits dans 1 carrire....2 choses tout  fait diffrentes!!!  Quant  Trzguet: je l'ai soutenu longtemps;mais son style de renard des surfaces pe?t encore faire illusion  en club;mais est dpass dans le jeu propos en quipes nationales...il ne sert plus  rien d'attendre un centre au 2me poteau: la balle ne viendra pas !!!  De plus  Henry nhsite pas  venir participer au jeu dfensif; lorsque ncsaire; ce qui nexiste pas chez Trzguet...  Le foot ball d'hier ne pe?t-tre compar  celui d'aujourd'hui..  Fontaine est bien toujours le recordman des buts inscrits   dans une coupe du monde;alors que le systme est totalement diffrent de nos jours...|`|f75685c0f3362b9611b2893b6c7bd490aa	on s'en fout|`|EJrnV4diaa	vive Trzguet mon chouchou!!!!!!  c'est une honte qu'il ne joue plus en quipe nationale!!!!!!!!|`|9d6b83b15b6ae205748394c45c96cfbdaa	Dans le football "l'ingratitude est monnaie courante". Alors ce qu'on veut faire d'Henry aujourd'hui, on avait autant et mme mieux pour Trezeguet, car il tait surnomm "le liberateur de l'equipe de France"  cause de "son but en Or" en finale de l'Euro 2000 face aux ?Italiens?.  Trezeguet a rat un penalty en finale de Coupe du Monde et il n'a pas marqu en quelques matches dans la selection, cela a suffit pour le denigrer.    "Le football a ses bons et ses mauvais moments, tout comme la vie a ses hauts et ses bats". Attendons-nous un jour qu'Henry va connaitre pareille et mme pire que Trezeguet. L'histoire ne peut le dementir.    Aux jours de Zidane en quipe de France, il avait tout fait pour imposer ou aider son compatriote Dugarry  tre slctionn, parce qu'on disait de mal contre lui  l'instar de Trezeguet.  Mais plus d'un se demande, pourquoi Henry ne dit jamais rien concernant Trezeguet qui est en train de souffrir de quelques choses personnelles avec l'entraineur, choses qui n'ont rien  voir avec sa performance dans la selection?    Un jour on saura!|`|8ccb76871149caf1d737903a919ab78caa	arretez de comparer l'incomparable.    Platini etait une legende, il a ete meilleur buteur en etant milieu offensifs. Magistrale, inoubliable, bravo platoche!!!    Henry viens de le depasser au compteurs..et c'est pas fini. multiple meilleur buteur en angleterre, meilleur buteur de l'histoire de l'equipe de France et future ballon d'or (je l'espere tellement il le merite). Bravo et merci titi!!    Pourquoi vouloir constemment opposer ces deux legendes du foot francais? Merci a eux deux, et encore bravo pour leurs exploits!!    Et puis cette histoire de but marquer par match est grotesque....dans ce cas la, le meilleurs buteur, c'est Ben Arfa.....|`|db5b56e8c82629aaaba576fe68101eefaa	Trezeguet ne marque plus en EDF depuis que le 4-2-3-1 a t mis en place (schma qui doit favoriser le jeu de Henry).   A quoi faut ajouter que l'un des meilleurs passeurs pour Trezeguet, c'tait quand mme Zidane, qui lui en a fait un paquet... mais qu'une seule  Henry (sur coup franc contre le Brsil en 1/4 de finale du mondial 2006). Ca veut bien dire ce que ?a veut dire?    De plus, Trezeguet n'a jamais t aussi bon en EDF que comme joker, c'est un fait, c'est comme ?a. En plus j'ai l'impression qu'il ne se sent plus trs bien dans le groupe France, Trezegol...|`|8f2d4ba9b5e2655a64a9e7b250a3a870aa	si on fait jouer Rothen il faut Trezeguet  si on joue contre une quipe qui laisse deux kilometres derrire ses lignes arrires il faut Henry    mais ?a n'existe plus ce genre d'quipe, sauf en GB    le coup de moule qu'il a eu !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  adieu Henry  Arsenal l'a compris|`|yPZ8h5Byaa	Je suis tout  fait d'accord avec toi. Trezeguet est un trs bon attaquant qui a largement sa place avec l'quipe de France.|`|Ny1L0hMKaa	titi|`|FODqOFnwaa	d'accord avec toi, il faut aussi voir l'fficacit, et l c'est pire encore !!!    Forza Trezegol, je ne le l'apprcie pas pour autant mais ce que lui fait l'autre baltringue de Domenech est injurieux!!!!|`|ouaFwfCmaa	Ca n'a rien  voir, mme si je pense que Platini est le plus grand joueur fran?ais de tous les temps.  L'poque tait diffrente : Platini tait  peu prs le seul  marquer des buts en EdF  l'poque, il faisait gagner l'quipe  lui seul. Au contraire, si tu regardes le classement des meilleurs buteurs en EdF, tu trouves entre autres parmi les premiers : Henry, Trezeguet, Zidane et Djorkaeff, soit des joueurs en activit ou  la retraite depuis peu (en tous cas avec lesquels Henry a jou). Ce qui veut dire que la concurrence est beaucoup plus forte  l'heure actuelle qu'au temps de Platini (cherche bien les comtemporains de Platini dans le classement !).  Donc tu as raison au moins sur un point, mais c'est bien le seul : il est ridicule de comparer quoi que ce soit. Quand  la diffrence entre Henry et Trezeguet, excuses moi mais elle est franchement minime !|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Platini tait bien un milieu de terrain mais uil s'agissait d'un numro 10 " l'ancienne" ce qu'on peut assimiler aujourd'hui a un attaquant de soutien et le football tait trs diffrent avec des dfenses nettement moins performantes.  Trzguet s'est limin tout seul, je ne pense pas que Henry y soit pour grand chose sinon d'avoir placer la barre d'exigence plus haut. Henry n'est peut-tre pas le meilleur buteur mais son apport au jeu est largement suprieur  celui de Trzguet.  Si tu veux prendre le ratio but/slection, Faubert c'est 1/1. Waouh le voil le magnifique buteur de l'quipe d eFrance, mfions-nous des statistiques !|`|v91YTD7Yaa	mais attend on a jamais dit ?a  le vai record serait qu'henry batte le record de but par match en EDF, mais on est pas oblig de se dire que tout va contre platini dans cette histoire !|`|NzVkaHYiaa	Tout  fait juste!!!  Je tiens m^me  rajouter que le ratio de Trezeguet serait certainement plus important s'il etait titulaire et surtout S IL AVAIT LA CONFIANCE DE SON ENTRAINEUR......     Bref en ratio de buts/nombre de minutes joues il explose litteralement!!!C ca l'effica?it...|`|df660ffc349a6e20ec37f4f474248a16aa	Comment comparer le maestro Platini  l'excutant, certe dou, qu'est Henry.

Aprs la seule chose que je demande aux joueurs c'est de faire honneur  ce sport en se donnant au maximum ds qu'ils sont sur le terrain.  Le fait qu'ils aient ou non une belle gueule n'a rien  faire l dedans. Donc pour le physique si je devais faire un choix j'aime bien le gabarit des ailiers muscls mais svelte.   Mais honntement je ne peux me prononcer sur les footballeurs, je ne suis absolument pas ce sport et donc ne connais pas les joueurs.

Mais plus srieusement, je pense qu'il s'agit aussi d'un phnomne de mode.En effet, il y a qq tps, il fallait aduler les footballeurs...C'est aujourd'hui, excusez-moi l'expression, "ringard" ( mis  part Ronaldino... :-(  )  Qui nous dit que l'anne prochaine ce ne seront pas les golfeurs qu'il faudra trouver sexy ? ( c'est vrai qu'il y a peu de chance, je le con?ois ! )  A part ?a, je pense que ds les esprits fminins, les rugbymen reprsentent la virilit mme : c'est vrai quoi, moi aussi j'aimerais bien que Poitrenau ( par exemple ) me rconforte...

Iv07hXdsaa	C'est inadmissible, Drogba, est s?rement,  l'heure actuelle, le meilleur attaquant du monde... C'est tout simplement scandaleux qu'il n'ait pas ce ballon d'or africain ! Dieu sait, si j'apprcie normment, Fred Kanout, mais celui-ci a t en dessous pour moi, de Didier Drogba, cette saison...    Enfin rien d'tonnant  cel qu'on connait toutes les magouilles prsentes en Afrique, car l'unique raison pour laquelle Drogba n'a pas eu ce ballon d'or, c'est ?a "Drogba aurait dclin l'invitation de se rendre  Lom pour recevoir le prix en raison de sa participation aux quarts de finale de la CAN avec la C?te d'Ivoire. La CAF aurait alors exerc une pression pour contraindre le joueur  venir dans la capitale togolaise. Sans succs. Elle aurait donc dcid de remettre  Kanout, son suivant au classement, le prix du meilleur joueur."    Drogba ne peut se rendre  la remise (et pour cause il va jouer un quart de final de Can) alors on dcide de donner ce trophe au suivant, ?a me fait gerber... Le foot africain et principalement ses dirigeants ont vraiment du soucis  se faire.|`|Ny1L0hMKaa	c'est indiscutable!  il a fait une saison pleine et riche lui!  contrairement  drogba|`|qHqaInpAaa	Franchement j'aime bien Kanout mais voil quoi de la  gagner le ballon d'or Africain faut pas rver. Regarde dans le ballon d'or europen Drogba 4 me , Kanout loin dans les 20 me. Surtout il marque presque tout le temps devant le but, alors que Didier rogba marque des buts que Kanout ne marquera jamais. Franchement j'aurais prferer encore choisir Adebayor que lui.|`|B6qQISL4aa	Franchement je ne pense pas que Kanout mrite ce titre.Ce titre revient a Drogba.Je suis vraiment d?u de la CAF.Jusque l je ne sais pas sur quoi il se sont bass pour lire Kanout comme ballon d'or Africain.Est ce parce que Drogba a refus d'aller au Togo pour servir sont pays  1 jours des quart_finales      ? Nous savons tous que l'afrique est un continent de tous les maux .C'est vrai mais pas jusqu'au point de faire de la triche en matire de ballon d'or.C'est vraiment un honte pour la CAF.Kanout est trs loin d'gal Drogba.Voyons la vrit en face .Les gens sont jaloux de Drogba c'est ce qui peut expliquer selon moi le choix de Kanout comme Ballon d'or.Ce qui est s?re dans nos coeurs nous savons que Kanout ne mrite pas ce titre et que ce titre revient a DROOOOGBA.ALLEZ DROGBA !!!!!!|`|PQFGL93maa	non.|`|yKrwtgppaa	Franchement non. Il faut ke les dirigeant de la caf arrete de se foutre des gens et qu'il prennent des decisions qui vont faire honneur a l'Afrique.

Recompenser les plus meritants et arret ces comportements        de tricheur. Cela prouve encore que l'Afrique est toujours des les temps arca?ques donc arreter ca et avancons.|`|I1x7e9oMaa	j'avoue que cela m'tonne car je me demande vraiment le critre qui a fait pencher la balance du c?t de kanout. loin de moi l'ide de minimiser les qualit de ce dernier mais cette anne tait celle du doublet  pour drogba.si la CAF persiste sur cet lan je crains fort pour le prestige de ce trophe. je ne suis ni ivoirien ni fan de drogba mais sur ce coup je pense qu'il y a anguille sous roche,ce n'est pas juste ce vote. mais bon un enfant dont le pre pisse au lit ne va pas sur tous les toits du monde le crier, ainsi donc nous continuerons  soutenir notre chre CAF tout en lui tirant les oreilles pour lui faire entendre raison s'il le faut bien s?r. bon le choix s'est fait le rsultat proclam il l'accepter. kannout est le ballon d'or africain 2007, que dieu l'aide dans sa carrire pour l'honneur de l'Afrique, du mali et du ballon d'or.|`|ChXgeaBfaa	Je pense que Kanout mrite largement ce ballon d'or au vu de ses performances pendant ces 2 dernires saisons. Il ne s'agit pas d'opposer des personnalits du foot africain mais de reconnaitre le mrite de l'une d'entre elles et Kanout mrite ce qu'il rcolte aujourd'hui. ce joueur volue dans un club qui n'a pa autant de moyens que Chelsea ou encore le Bar?a mais il se distingue et cela est  noter. C'est trop facile d'tre entour des meilleurs joueurs du monde et se dire qu'on est galement le meilleur joueur africain. kanout ne bnficie pas de toute la publicit qui se fait autour des joueurs comme Drogba ou autres. Je pense que cette fois le choix de la CAF ou des spcialistes qui ont vot est judicieux n'en dplaise  ceux qui pense que c'est un problme de personne. Pourquoi penser tout le temps qu'on est victime d'une injustice? Entre celui qui a remport 2 coupes UEFA et celui qui n'a aucun trophe, je pense que le choix est clair. Bon courage  Kanout.

By their mid to late teens, they move up to junior formula car ranks - such as a national formula ford, formula bmw or formula renault series.  Moving up the ladder, there are many different series one can take up the racing ladder, but British F3, world series by renault, GP2 are some of the most competitive and many current F1 drivers have raced in one of these series.  Generally, the whole process requires a lot of funding, either out of pocket or from a personal sponsor, until F1, where most drivers are currently paid.|`|rtq9zUBvaa	The first thing you have to have to become a racer, is the want to be a racer.

Good luck!|`|AA11530678	Anyone whos played the Gran Turismo racing game on the Playstation will be familiar with the frustration of having to take innumerable licence tests before getting to race.   Uniroyal recently offered me the chance to take part in their Fun Cup series, and told me I would have to qualify for my National B Licence. So naturally I assumed I would be weaving in and out of turns and demonstrating my car control over timed laps of a circuit, just like the game.   Now since I happily admit I have two left thumbs when it comes to computer games, I was really rather nervous when my Motor Sports Association (MSA) racing starter pack arrived in the post. The pack is designed to tell the aspiring racer everything he or she needs to know to qualify for a licence and then go racing safely. As well as the usual advertising bumph (including a rather addictive Demon Tweeks catalogue) there is the obligatory training DVD and the MSA yearbook. This is the bible of the UK motor racing scene and sets out all the rules and regulations covering the competitors, cars, officials and circuits for every form of licensed motorsport.   Oh and a letter from Paul Rose, director of the Uniroyal Fun Cup series telling me my ARDS (Association of Racing Drivers Schools) test would be in less than a weeks time. Better get watching. Shot in true patronisingly cheesy training film style, the DVD covers the basics of going racing including the all important safety equipment and flags. Plus a bit about how to actually drive a competition car, with an introduction to understeer and oversteer and an explanation of the heel and toe technique. This involves blipping the throttle whilst braking and changing down through the gears to keep the car balanced. Hang on, Ive only got two feet and I cant practice that on the way to Sainsburys.

by7BQ2npaa	It used to be a wholesome event with meaning, but for the past decade or so, it has now become too corporate, plastic and un-Olympic.  It has also been proven that after the more recent games, a lot of debt was left behind for the hosting locations.  That is why the debate has even come up and why you even hear negative things about the Olympic games.  Also, it is a very sensitive time economically, so the Olympics, with its now-heavily corporate style, does not seem appropriate.  It's too bad.|`|WrDGhduxaa	From a financial view the Olympics are a waste of money.  But so are children, and people still have children.

The Olympics encourages foreign travel and thousands of people visit places they would never have seen without the Olympics.

CdlSbr0aaa	well if you wanna be a safty you'll have to become faster. but try talking to some college football coaches about becoming a walk on. I'm 20 also im 5'10 225 last time i ran a 40 was a few years ago and it was a 4.7 but after im done in the marines im goin to minnesota and im goin to be a walk on and either go for running back or safty since with my hieght there isnt alot i can play besides them two. but you could also look at being a linebacker just need to add some muscle to your fram and get up to about 215 which is good for a freshman linebacker. because you can always add more on and nowa days alot of linebackers and saftys are in the 220-240 range and they are consider great players. for example taylor mays from usc dudes 225 and runs a 4.4 40. but either get faster or add more muscle and talk to a college coach if not try a local arena team.|`|AA10896470	Yep but you can be all you can be in the Army, LOL!!!

Arena is a different story...I'd say without football knowledge, your skills won't get you very far.
AA12170560	Ok.  Let me kindly clarify two misstatements before I answer this question.    1) There's no such thing as Finesse for a Defensive End - unless you're one of those people that thinks a rhinocerous is a finesse creature.     Your primary responsibility as DE will always be Quarterback containement...  anything after that is fluff: sacks, destroying blocking back. shutting down the tight end....fluff.  There's no finesse involved here, it's agile, brutile, and destructive.  The position of Safety is a Finesse Position    2) You are not already amazing at rips, swims, push-pulls, hip thrusts, slaps, leverage techniques or anything else...  You're not getting paid to play - so "amazing" is irrelevant and these tools don't dictate your success. One lousy lineman can ruin your knees for life and those upper body skill strengths didn't matter at all, did they? Also, these tools are utilized at the LOS and their success is governed by your opponent. If you're so amazing, then it's because your opponent sucks.    ok.  To your question.    Off Season workouts...  stay in the gym...  I like 250 as your current bench max, lets get you to 300 by your Senior Year of play.  Power Squats and Sprinting steps should be added.  Your goal is to be able to run down a half back.    Especially when the QB rolls away from you or the sweep is away from you and you have trail responsibility.    So, be setting your sights for a 4.5 - 40 yard sprint.    To get there,   regular sprint workouts followed by intensive, quick sprints up steps will help - regardless of the numbers, I like to see stepping at between 7 and 15 second bursts.  To exhaustion.  Rest in between at 5 to 10 seconds.    Keep a strong training tempo - even when coupled with regular pre season work out (ie; sprint steps after practice)   They only time you will back off is with 3 a days and hell week.    NO SUPPLEMENTS    Just think of good, healthy nutrition, plenty of water, and quality rest.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	The best exercise for building strong legs and overall strength is the squat.  So make sure you do many sets of squats in your workout.    http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...  http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...|`|r0HYuHubaa	screw cheerleaders|`|7oC5tO9kaa	you sound like a linebacker more than a end    what is your 40 time?|`|YCwmCDkUaa	waterboy|`|54XYA1XZaa	Sounds like you are doing pretty well in the weight room already.  Some athletes think it is all about working legs.  And that is a huge part of it, but also you have to work your core.  Core= Hips, abs, lower back.  Some great exercises to work your core are.  Dead lifts. Power Cleans, Hang Cleans, and ab work such as crunches, leg lifts, and so on.    As far as explosivness, you need to work your fast twitch muscle fibers by plyometric training.  A idea of what a plyometric exercise is.  Take Jump rope.  You jump in the air as the rope swings under you.  As soon as you land you jump again.  That landing and jumping is a plyometric.  An action counter acted by another action.    So with that said.  Box Jumps, agility ladders, jumprope, Over speed training will work your fast twitch muscles.    Now alot of athletes think they have to keep there heart rate up during plyos.  That is not true.  Infact it is the opposite.  Take breaks inbetween each exercise.  If your huffing and puffing it becomes an arobic exercise.      A few good ways of getting off the line quick is by learning the running cycle, and also a great stance.  Again most football players will tell you there stance is perfect but you have to have some one that knows what they are doing to give you pointers.  Like a coach or maybe a team mate.    You stance should waste no effort while coming out of is.  If your leaning to hard on your hands you have to adjust your weight before driving out.  This could lose vaaluble seconds.  Is your base to wide, or to thin.      The running cycle is the progression we run in.  Think about someone sprinting.  When they start they are using smaller quicker steps, or cycles.  As they breack about 5 yards there stride gets a bit longer.  They should land on the ball of thiee foot, just under thier body.  Down the streatch the cycle becomes longer while your in full sprint.    So the question is.  What part of that running cycle do you need most??  The begining right!  So that is the part you train the most.    Get in a good stance and work on exploding off the ball, in 5 or 10 yard bursts.  Also add to your workout.  Stance start and direction change.  As a defenseive end you only want to make a yard yard and a half penetration on run plays then work down the line to the ball carrier.    Another quick start drill is push up starts.  Lay flat on your stomach.  On command press yourself off the ground like a push ups.  Spring to your feet and sprint 5 or 10 yards.  What the Push up start does it makes your body lean so far forward that if you didn't take quick small steps to start you would fall flat on your face.    Good luck.  Check out youtube.com for some good videos on plyometric training, as well as speed and agility drills.|`|CdlSbr0aaa	well do alot of leg workouts like leg press, leg extensions and calf raises to name a few. running will also help not only in endurance but with your explosiveness. concentrate on your quads hamstrings and calves alot. but dont forget about your upper body too try building strength in your arms since you'll become more powerful and explosive. just work your *** off and dont let up try training 3-6 days a week. use supplements like a protein powder or creatine. will help in recovery. hopes this helps.|`|8246cce5a3f192f56f4bad1d720052faaa	You should do jammers. They help with explosion at the line. I do 110lb at 70%. Also swims are good for slipping past a double block. I play alot of offense, and they might want to send 2 linemen at you alot, so you just got to be ready for that.
OxJ4hIJuaa	I think that Jimmy Cowan and Piri Weepu are both great halfbacks, but I believe that Piri Weepu should get a start and Jimmy Cowan on the bench. Piri Weepu is a great leader, captaining the All Blacks in last year's match against Munster. The third half back position is gonna be contested between Andy Ellis and Brendon Leonard, though I prefer Leonard more. This is year is gonna be a great year of rugby, and I cant wait until the Super Rugby and All Blacks matches gets underway. GO THE BLUES AND THE ALL BLACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ETarSy9Maa	Just to clear things up, and to all the Cantabs, I'm sorry, Justin Marshall is an idiot who talks bull.  As for Andy Ellis, I'm not sure how he got into the All Blacks in the first place, he is a very bad player.  I hope niether one of them get anywhere near a test jersey ever again.    As for the starting place, when Brendon Leonard gets back into fine form, which I'm sure he will, it will be a tight battle between the three of them.  Cowan has a little trouble with his passing and his feeding, however his perfomances are still very good, and his tackling is ridiculous, he is constantly putting his body on the line.  So I think Cowan deserves the No 9 spot st the moment, but he'll have to stay on form to keep it.|`|mwGancPWaa	Weepu is a great half back with cowan getting into trouble, he will rise to the acation and be maybe the world best half back. and also when Daniel Carter is injuried he can slot in at fly half. but there is one thing lenord is fit and ready too go and there is also ellis who is in good form so who knows it mite b weepu in the starting 15 and lenard in 20 who knows!|`|Zd9whuMmaa	I think there are better half backs than Weepu  Ellis Cowan and the half back from waitako.  weepu would be a good half back if he only played at half back.  he was used as a first five for wellington last year.  he would be a good bench player as he can play both positions.|`|DgS3MwYraa	If you watched the Barbarians game end of 2008 you would've seen Justin Marshall in action. He looks sharper than ever to me and he has the world of experience, I think he still has lots too offer, but he is retired so he probably doesn't count.    Weepu over Cowan, Ellis anyday! Cowan can't behave himself in public anyway. Weepu is tough around the fringes, tough tackler and always in the right place. Also very skillfull as he has played 10 for the Hurricanes.     Plus he has lotsa character and does a great haka face!|`|bX7UWh39aa	Cowan is the number one halfback he is agressive has a good rugby brain he singlehandly turned the All Blacks fortunes around after the losses in Dunedin and Sydney, Weepu is the ultimate bench player and thats where he should stay and Andy Ellis should never wear an All Black jersey again.|`|f6WFvYGHaa	Yeah I think Weepu really stepd up a gear last year, lets see if he can build on it,  should be great competittion for no1 spot this year,  Elis doesnt cut the mustard tho.    Leonard will also be hungry,  and may form a great combination with Donald.............GO CHIEFS|`|VjJAHRVMaa	Agree that the ABs have a lot of quality at halfback at the moment and Weepu looked the better of Cowan on the UK tour  ... but with the way Byron Kelleher has performed for Toulouse this season I wish he was still in the black jersey|`|dpJPaxfuaa	Justin Marshall !!!! .... Still streaks ahead of ANY halfback in the world    AND !!! I'm from Otago|`|vyjNPhK8aa	Andy Ellis is USELESS. He only got into the all blacks because at caterbury and the crusaders all he had to do was pass the ball to Carter who made him look a hell of a lot better than he is. It's reall a toss up between leonard weepu and cowan depending on whose in form, because along with the 3 south africans they are probably the best halfbacks in the world|`|rEfWbfJ3aa	Weepu is the man for the job he's skillfull and tough .Its a fine line these days on how to manage your impact players to be the most effective.With weepu on the sideline winding up like a spring hungry to get on it provides a different dynamic then starting him .If Cowan can smarten up on a and not get penalised as much then keep things the way they are. Dont fix it if its not broke.
FUoKu13Daa	are you playing in school? and if you do are you good shooter, good passer and rebounder, can you play defense.    Also are college scouts looking at you    I am just pointing this out to you, if you do not have scouts looking at you it being college or pro  scouts then you might have to walk on into a college and see if you have the talent to play and if you do then you will be one of many that may or may not play.    Just imagine how many college basketball teams there are and imagine how many of those player actually make it into the NBA.      The point I am trying to make it that you have to be an exceptional talent and if you do have exceptional talent then I believe you will be notice by someone.|`|zN82yuVDaa	u will be like yao ming.

BAurzDXtaa	Kevin Nash was good back in the 90's when he was still mobile. He was a powerhouse and could actually wrestle a decent match. Now he his hardly mobile because of his bad knees and struggles through every match. If I was Nash I would really consider retiring after his contract expires before he suffers another serious injury.|`|DfPyyDssaa	Kevin Nash has weak knees and should retire from wrestling already.Maybe become a commentator.|`|P93I8CHtaa	hes a badA$$|`|TbRtRvuoaa	i am a big fan of Kevin Nash  he was good whwn we was in wwe 1993-1996 & probably at his best in WCW when he was a decent wrestler    Now he aint so great in the ring and think he should retire soon    but i want him to stay in TNA  possibly as a commentator or manager or something    he's one of the greatest people ever on the mic he can be funny, serious & never makes a mistake     i thought he was funny in the Paparazzi series in 2006 & 2007 he was hilarious|`|TWQNYhVVaa	He's cool,his knees are weak though..he should be a escort or something..a TV job just not a wrestler..|`|cj8iM1Olaa	He's old and shou...OWWWWWWWW UGHHHHHHHH MY QUAD!!!|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	He was only good when he was in the Outsiders with Scott Hall.|`|uDh2QX0baa	I don't have anything against older wrestlers, but Nash has no mobility,  and didn't even when he was younger, and really can't have a good match with any 5 star wrestlers anymore.|`|r57tzyBdaa	He has to stop wrestling. PERIOD.  I'm glad that his wife convinced him to turn down the offer from WWE last year.  He keeps going thought injury after injury. He should be a manager, announcer, backstage interviewer or even a creative team writer.   He should just learn to call it quits and be thankful that he had a good career.|`|O5KOwhovaa	He was tolerable when part of the Outsiders with Scott Hall in the early days of the nWo and that's pretty much it. One of the primary architects of WCW's downfall.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	He definitely can't pass like Steve Nash.|`|uaMQNJPoaa	He's old and shou...OWWWWWWWW UGHHHHHHHH MY QUAD!!!|`|1z7M3Tntaa	He's needs to retirefrom wrestling  he's too old, he could make a good manager or something
ctraoPNMaa	Who the hell is she?|`|KdhNCnEjaa	they r trying 2  trade him but no1 wants him|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	The Pacers don;t want him. Almost the same situation with Stephon Marbury  but without the tatoo in his head and ofcourse the heaps of feuds.|`|H9G8y1acaa	Too many legal problems and he gets injured to easily. The pacers let him go because 1. he can't stay healthy, and 2. He can't keep himself out of trouble. No team wants to deal with that.|`|zN82yuVDaa	because he is like stephon marbury and ron artest: needs to be trated and he is a troblemaking player|`|PHoyqLN9aa	Because he told the coach he was gay and Danny Granger said that he should stay away from the team.    I know right? what the heck...
uF31S9Dqaa	I'm not quite sure what your question is - are you looking for advice on a certain bat, or are you looking to see if someone has a bat for sale?    If it's the first question, the biggest thing I can tell you is to pick up and swing as many bats as you can and find the one that gives you the most confidence when you go up to the plate. The bat should be something you don't have to think about when you're facing a pitcher. You want to feel like it will be in the right spot at the right time for you to get a hit.    There are lots of things that go into a great bat, from the swing weight, to the size and texture of the grip, to the materials its made of.    The last thing you should be influenced by is price and advertising. Both are just used to try and convey a message or feeling to you - that you'll get a hit, you'll hit the ball harder or farther, etc. While that may be true in a lab, it may not be true on the field. You'll always hit the ball harder and farther with the bat that works with your swing and you feel most comfortable with at the plate.    Best of luck with the search and I hope you have a great season!|`|5XhljcmCaa	Your a 14 yo kid       AWSOME!|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	More than likely you will be playing for the freshmen or JV. I enjoyed using the EXO bats in high school. The Dynasty is a good bat too.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	What is your question?|`|PvpbooLXaa	if you are allowed composite bats then a demorini or C4 are good and a stealth is also not bad but if you can't then use a rebel or even a typhoon
q71osfkiaa	Liverpool vs Tottenham should be the decider.  Otherwise Chelsea can.  Man U isn't going to have a walk like everyone thinks they will.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I think Man Utd will walk it|`|XUe07RPGaa	Well, according to Arsene Wenger, Everton!!    But I think Man Utd, Liverpool (unfortunately) have bottled it.|`|0HO8sTGeaa	why the same question..... it's gonna be MAN U all the way to the top...........     Liverpool no... you got to be kidding|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	liverpool will or Rafa will blow chances if he gets some  leaving the leauge to Man U who actually can win of thier own but love challanges|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Manchester United will win the league with ease.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no,the winner is manchester united|`|IhJV165waa	no i dont .manchester united who else? :-)|`|e0957cd4945ef9a81d45c793833468e0aa	man utd followed by either chelsea or aston villa.|`|UeWhmTIRaa	I think man utd will win it again,liverpool had so many chances to open up a gap between themselves and the rest of the league and did not take them i also dont think chelsea are as good as they were under jose mourinho.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Oh how I hope Man U messes up so we can get our spot back.  But there's no chance of that happening , is there?  Man U will win and Rafa will get sacked|`|8ORwpuTuaa	The way it is going Manchester United or Chelsea.        Villa would probably be the surprise if they are consistent in their form.|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	it's way to early to say.... last season we (arsenal ) were 8 points clear and we still came third........you can't really tell what'sgonna happen in the nest 4 months to any of the teams challenging....|`|848c3c596d821d8f27c64a25f1db134eaa	It's already won by the best team in the world man utd.No Liverppol have blown it already|`|O5KOwhovaa	Liverpool can only win the title if Rafa Benitez adopts more of a ruthless attitude towards finishing off teams when Liverpool take the lead in a game.

They have started their great form now, and with all thats happening behind the scenes at Liverpool they will suffer|`|x2mgUMb6aa	it had better be manchester utd as i have 500 at 4/1 riding on them.  this is purely financial,i don't in any way support them.|`|d834b55c06ca79289bf62fe0de19a1e3aa	It will be Liverpool if we start to win matches again.

They are falling out of the race...as usual!    Manchester are just stacking up the points and it's Liv vs Chelsea this weekend so one of the 2 could be even further behind by monday!    Arsenal (I love them) unfortunately not ruthless enough...plus we miss walcott and Fabregas! Just hope we can pass Villa and Liverpool.    1. Man Utd  2. Chelsea  3. arsenal  4. Liverpool  5. Aston Villa  6. Everton  7. West Ham  8. Wigan  9. Man City  10.

You see at this crucial stage of the season that's the difference between the Champions and the challengers.  United by a mile, Liverpool wont even finish second.

A fine fielder. So quick and the all round natural ability making everything he does looks so easy. That's what I enjoy seeing him do.

A5ypQeqwaa	I think Bullsbay, because there is not a good cast of horses there, besides Einstein and Arson Squad, but Im looking for a fresh horse to emerge and I think this is the one, another horse that is interesting is Alberthus Maximus, but can he run past the mile. Finally I think the Delightfull Kiss' connections made a mistake by going to the sunshine millions instead of this race, that is an easier spot.|`|WQa094S4aa	I think that Einstein can pull this off, but AP Arrow may be a   good exacta bet with him.|`|aeODdMATaa	I think Einstein will that the prize. He is an experienced horse who won many Grade 1 and I think he can do it.

Of course teams have done it in HS and college...NJIT just broke their long losing streak...of course, they lost again last night...thus starting another one...|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Its Possible.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	"Lions and tigers come running just to steal your loooooooooovee"|`|qXlBsRLgaa	that will never happen|`|1nIdoB0paa	Yes I think but it depends upon on how many games are played every season, how many teams, and the way a team plays in a basketball season.|`|AKHywxwlaa	yes|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Yes its possible.|`|1xr6T6h0aa	If you mean NBA, no, but maybe a college or high school that is REALLY bad.    P.S. Go Lions!|`|cxsBo2yqaa	I don't think a team will ever go 0-82 because this would mean that they are a failing franchise that will probably won't make a lot of money, coaches/GMs will be fired, and the team could possibly get moved to another city.

The fines can be steep and depending on the situation the state could suspend you ability to gain a licence for a year or longer. just keep it legal and for peace of mind. nothing less relaxing than looking over your shoulder for the game warden while trying to fish.
nEXYwRYgaa	1.world most watched league. there's big 4. man u, liverpool, arsenal and chelsea.  2.la liga from spain i think. haha. if i'm correct. top club barcelona, real madrid and valencia.   3.italy. been on hot seat last season due to match arrangement. you can find juventus, inter milan and ac milan there.  4.german. one of the best league also. bayern munich, bayer leverkusen.  5.this one i'm not qute sure.

Point Prediction: 30     Arsenal  Arsenal are looking to get back into form after a poor couple of weeks and they dont have it easy playing west ham and tottenham are two hard fixtures and they also have games such as man.u and chelsea I feel arsenal will have alot of pressure if they want a top 4 finish and we will have to see how they manage it.    Point Prediction: 30      Looking through both teams games they should be looking at getting the same amount of points which will have aston villa in 4th an a tired arsenal trayling behind    Thats my opinion the beautiful game can take a swing in any direction at any time|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	36 for Arsenal    24 for Villa|`|B5Rpl7Auaa	Not sure how many they will get from those fixtures,but I think Arsenal could struggle on saturday.|`|d834b55c06ca79289bf62fe0de19a1e3aa	Villa are going to get around 26/27.

Se aparecem no couro cabeludo, podem provocar queda de cabelo e manchas que descamam. Na virilha,  conhecida como coceira de jquei provocando coceira e incha?o. Nos casos mais srios, as fissuras que aparecem podem minar um lquido e a pele torna-se mais fina e dolorida np local. Algumas vezes, infec??es bacterianas secundrias podem complicar o quadro.   Frieiras s?o transmitidas facilmente por contato direto com a pessoa infectada ou com superfcies contaminadas como pisos de banheiros e vestirios, praias e piscinas.       Recomenda??es  Grande parte dos casos de frieiras podem ser evitados ou tratados com algumas medidas bsicas de higiene:     Enxugue bem os ps, especialmente entre os dedos, depois de lav-los. Use, se necessrio, um secador de cabelo ou outra toalha limpa e seca. Em certos casos, colocar algod?o entre os dedos dos ps ajuda a mant-los secos. Esse algod?o deve ser trocado com freqncia;     N?o use meias de tecido sinttico que n?o absorvem o suor e mantm a pele mida;     Troque as meias freqentemente, deixando os ps tomarem um pouco de ar durante a troca;     Evite usar tnis muito fechados e com pouca ventila??o que aumentam a sudorese nos ps;     Use cal?ados bem ventilados. Se possvel, use sandlias ou cal?ados com abertura para os dedos;     Calce chinelos quando for utilizar banheiros e vestirios de clubes ou escolas para n?o se reinfectar nem passar a infec??o para outros;     Observe as unhas dos dedos dos ps. Se estiverem grossas, esbranqui?adas ou descoloridas, podem ter sido infectadas pelo fungo o que requer cuidados mdicos especiais;     N?o aplique talcos ou cremes antifngicos por conta prpria. Alguns desses produtos n?o surtem o efeito que prometem. Procure um dermatologista para orientar o tratamento.

En mi caso, yo soy hincha enferma de River Plate (Arg.), todos en mi familia son de Rosario Central, ya que vivimos en Rosario, y me hice de River de muy chiquita por un amigo del colegio que me termino contagiando la "locura millonaria", de todas formas mi familia siempre fue muy futbolera, mi hermana es periodista deportiva, asi que todos disfrutamos de este deporte; coincido con quien dejo el comentario anterior, no se aprende, es algo que viene con uno, es una pasion sin igual!    saludos!|`|hg4FMMAFaa	Ami si me gusta el futbol, y el futbol propiamente dicho no?

jxxXTEG4aa	Na sele??o de volei masculino, conseguiu-se que cada jogador dedique-se ao mximo ao time, deixando totalmente de lado vaidades pessoais de quaisquer natureza. Por acaso algum fica idolatrando esse ou aquele jogador como o grande destaque da equipe? Vc ouve falar em recordes pessoais como ouvia na copa do mundo do ano passado? Ali, qualquer um pode ir para o banco e, mesmo assim, vai continuar torcendo por seus companheiros como se estivesse em quadra. Veja alguns exemplos: o Rodrig?o foi titular na liga e no Pan, mas no mundial ficou no banco e Andr Eller (n?o sei se est escrito certo) foi o titular. O Dante j ficou vrias vezes no banco, assim como o Andr Nascimento tambm. At o Giba j esquentou banco vrias vezes e, nem por isso deixou de ser o grande Giba que conhecemos. Quando um deles come?ou a se achar insubstituvel (no caso o Ricardinho) foi cortado, mesmo sendo o melhor do mundo.    Isso por acaso acontece no feminino? N?o, com certeza.    Perguntaram s jogadoras do feminino se elas se inspiravam nos jogadores do masculino e sabe qual foi a resposta da maioria? N?o, nos nos inspiramos na Fof?o. Nossa, a fof?o ganhou tantos ttulos importantes n?o  mesmo? Ser que foi campe? mundial alguma vez ou medalhista de ouro de Olimpadas? Acho que n?o.   Deu para notar a diferen?a dos times?

aaiN5JiCaa	So you've mastered standing up on a board, that's good.  Right now, stick to footbreaks. This is wear you place your other foot on the floor to stop. Practice this by going on a steady speed, not too quickly. Gain speed from time to time and lightly tap your foot when doing so.    You can find out more information on how to skateboard here (it really helps!) :    http://skateboard.about.com/od/tricktips...      P.S: Don't be afraid to fall, and ALWAYS wear your helmet at this point.|`|l0QinWFGaa	practice....skateboards are hard to learn, when it gets into doing the tricks...It's not easy teaching someone to ride a board, its like trying to get a baby to walk....just practice, that's all i can tell you...

It's sorta like if you were to wear form fitting underwear under your pants, others can't really tell if you have a wedgie because your pants just glides right over your underwear (which isn't too loose to give you a wedgie).|`|dSy1Kkdiaa	Dunno.................

To TNA -   Kane - fued with Matt Morgan would be excellent    CM Punk - Would fit perfectly in the X-Division    Miz & Morrison - would have some fantastic matches against the Motorcity Machineguns    Mr Kennedy - He is an exceptional superstar and I think he would be perfect replacement for the now-departed Christian Cage.|`|NQkRzBtJaa	Superstars from WWE to TNA    1. CM Punk because wwe limits punk's move set he would be able to use more of his technical moves in tna    2. Jimmy Wang Yang he is a great high flyer but wwe doesn't seem to want to push him so he is better off using his great high flying abilities in the tna x-division     3. Shelton Benjamin he has everything a wrestler needs to be at the main event level but yet he remains at the mid card level, in tna he would be pushed to the main event    4. Batista for the opposite reason why I would send Benjamin. WWE puts him as a huge main eventer but in TNA I think they would put him as more of a mid carder which is where he belongs    5. Paul Burchill he is good English brawler similar style to regal however wwe has him jobbing he would at least be a mid carder in TNA    Superstars from TNA to WWE  1. Sting this would be awesome for WWE he is a huge legend could have an amazing feud with the undertaker    2. Kurt Angle one of the best technical wrestlers the wwe has ever had would be unbelievable for him to return    3. Samoa Joe he is a great technical wrestler as well and wwe is lacking technical wrestlers right now     4.

Op1WIwyPaa	You should understand the basics of surfing after three days. However it will take some time to master them. I would recommend you start swimming laps in a pool so that you are comfortable in the water etc. Although it is different being in the ocean vs. the pool it will help. By swimming you are also building the muscles you use for paddling.    The Surfboard Man  http://www.thesurfboardman.com/|`|4veNeNU6aa	You'll learn quick! especially if you're already athletic.  Have fun!|`|2mGSsASZaa	USUALLY THE INSTRUCTORS ARE REALLY GOOD. SO U WILL MOST LIKELY BE UP AND RIDING WAVES WITHIN THE FIRST DAY.>>> IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THEN YEAH YOUR MUSCLES WILL GET SORE  BUT THEN IT WILL WEAR OFF. THE MORE YOU SURF THE MORE YOU GET USED TO THE SORENESS.... AND YOU DON'T REALLY NEED ALOT OF MUSCLES WHEN YOU START OUT,  BUT YOU DO NEED ENOUGH SO YOU CAN PUSH YOURSELF UP ON THE BOARD.

fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	Os Jogos Pan-americanos, s?o um evento multidesportivo, que tem como base os Jogos Olmpicos e organizados pela ODEPA. Funcionam como uma vers?o das Olimpadas modernas onde participam os pases do continente americano. Nos Jogos, s?o disputados esportes includos no Programa Olmpico e outros n?o disputados em Olimpadas. Acontecem a cada quatro anos e tradicionalmente seguem um rodzio entre as trs regi?es do continente: Amrica do Sul, Central e do Norte. A primeira edi??o foi realizada em Buenos Aires, capital da Argentina, em 1951.    Histria  Representantes de diversos pases da America Latina aps as Olimpadas de 1932 propuseram uma espcie de "Competi??o Regional" s para as Amricas. Nessa poca j existiam os Jogos Abertos da Amrica Central e seus dois ltimos eventos tinham sido no Mxico em 1926 e em 1930 na Cuba socialista. A histria segue at 1938 quando a regi?o do Caribe come?a a participar da competi??o. Aps essa inclus?o (e tambm dos Estados Unidos no ano de 1944), todos os outros pases da Amrica quiseram competir. Foi ent?o que o ex-presidente argentino Roberto Marcelino Ortiz, fundou o Congresso Panamericano de Esportes (Pan American Sports Congress) em Buenos Aires, Argentina, em Agosto de 1940. Ficou convencionado que Buenos Aires seria onde realizariam o primeiro Jogos Pan-americanos em 1942. Isso acabou n?o acontecendo em decorrncia da Segunda Guerra Mundial que durou de 1939 at 1945. Com o trmino da segunda grande guerra, e a volta ao perodo de paz, alinha-se com isso, um amplo crescimento econ?mico (em vrios pases da Amrica) em raz?o das exporta??es crescentes para a Europa destruda pela guerra. Em virtude de tudo isso que durante o perodo compreendido entre 8 e 15 de Agosto de 1948, em Londres, Inglaterra, aconteceu o Segundo Congresso Pan-americanos (II Pan American Congress). O Congresso delibera novamente sobre a ata inicial dos jogos e decidem que em 25 de Fevereiro de 1951 a cidade de Buenos Aires iria sediar os primeiros Jogos Pan-americanos.

DriXk8ksaa	les deux principes de base sont :  tu ne peux faire une passe qu'en arriere  si tu es devant le ballon alors tu es hors jeu (diffrent du football classique)    apres, tu as le droit de taper le ballon au pieds tant que tu veux....  tu n'a pas le droit de toucher un adversaire qui n'a pas le ballon ou qui n'est pas li au tas de joueurs ayant le ballon ( la diffrence du foot amricain aussi)    les fautes :   passe en avant : mle  faute sur joueur ou sur le jeu : pnalit  hors jeu : pnalit  ballon touff qui ne sort pas du regroupement : soit mle soit pnalit selon le cas.  etc...etc...    les points :   si tu applatis le ballon dans l'embut adverse, alors tu marque 5 pts et tu as le droit de tenter de transformer pour 2 pt de plus  s'il y a une faute grave sur toi, tu peux tenter une pnalit pour 3 pts  pendant le jeu, tu peux tenter un drop (le ballon doit toucher le sol juste avant ton coup de pieds) qui te rapporte 3 pts.|`|RQGoMz2paa	pff c'est large comme question...alors j'imagine que tu connais quand mme le principe du jeu...  je te donne quelques rgles disons essentielles  - tout joueur tomb au sol se doit de librer rapidement le ballon, ou ne pas empcher sa libration sous peine d'un coup de pied de pnalit  - le hors jeu : la ligne de hors jeu est constitue, en action, par le ballon (et donc son porteur), si ce'st un partenanire, tu es considr comme hors jeu si tu te trouves devant lui...  sur un regroupement, ce'st le dernier pied du dernier dfenseur qui fait office de ligne de hors jeu  - l'en avant : pas le droit de fair une passe vers l'avant...simple, si un joueur laisse tomber le ballon devant lui dans le sens du jeu...en -avant, mle pour l'adversaire..*  ce'ts difficile d'tre concise, aussi, je suis dsole mais je te remet un lien pas mal et ou s'est expliqu assez simplement...  http://www.francerugby.fr/regles/horsjeu...|`|9bd6da3f231d9a9baa39b49e16df7232aa	Faut bourriner, courir, passer le ballon en arrire, aller poser le ballon de l'autre c?t de la ligne blanche des adversaires, empcher que les adversaires fassent pareil et lacher le ballon une fois au sol.

3501216f04299ff16b62111ca4410f04aa	pan quer dizer todos.. entao todos americanos..pan americanos ok|`|fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	Pan-americanismo significa "uma s unidade em toda a Amrica" e o pan-americano  o cidad?o cuja nacionalidade  a Amrica unida, sem fronteiras. O termo surgiu durante o perodo posterior  Segunda Guerra Mundial, embora seu ideal j existisse desde o tempo do colonialismo.     O pan-americanismo, na realidade, tinha seus alicerces em dois fatores: geogrfico e histrico. O primeiro correspondia  realidade de uma grande continente, recm-explorado. O segundo abordava as diferen?as entre as civiliza??es que imigraram e se dividiram entre Amrica anglo-sax?nica e a Amrica ibrica, alm de suas lutas pela independncia. Esses dois fatores, o geogrfico e o histrico, eram pontos comuns que estimulavam na cabe?a dos pensadores o ideal pan-americano, uma Amrica para todos.     Em 1910 a Argentina seria palco da IV Conferncia Pan-americana. Como resultado da conferncia foi criada a Uni?o Pan-americana, um rg?o permanente com sede em Washington. A partir de 1930, o conceito de pan-americanismo come?ou a enfraquecer, dando lugar ao interamericanismo.     A diferen?a entre os dois conceitos  muito importante, j que o interamericanismo n?o prega a idia da uni?o. Suas bases sustentam uma rela??o ntima entre os pases americanos. Esta mudan?a foi formalizada pelo Tratado Interamericano de Assistncia Recproca (TIAR), de 1947 e pela Carta da Organiza??o das Na??es Unidas, de 1948.      interessante notar que a idia do pan-americanismo tem se refor?ado muito nos dias de hoje em detrimento do interamericanismo. Na Amrica do Sul temos o grande bloco econ?mico formado pelo Mercosul. Brasil, Argentina, Paraguai e Uruguai se uniram num grande mercado comum que, futuramente, ir permitir a livre circula??o de mercadorias e trabalhadores. Atualmente Chile e Bolvia est?o se ajustando para integrarem o bloco. Na Amrica do Norte temos a coopera??o entre os EUA, Mxico e Canad formando o mercado comum denominado NAFTA.     Ultimamente, os Estados Unidos tm demonstrado um grande interesse em unir os dois blocos de pases formando um nico mercado comum, o ALCA. Porm, os brasileiros tm se reservado o direito de estudar atentamente em que pontos o ALCA pode beneficiar nossa economia, a fim de proteger nossa indstria e o bem-estar da popula??o. Os EUA s?o bem conhecidos pela sua economia protecionista e, o verdadeiro pan-americanismo depende de concess?es mtuas para que possa funcionar justa e harmoniosamente. S assim teremos uma Amrica unida de norte a sul com oportunidades e progresso para todos.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Great trade for both teams. The Braves have a desperate need for bullpen help and the Pirates needed a bat to protect Bay so each was willing to give up a very talented player. Gonzalez is an excellent pickup for Atlanta (above average stuff and pitching smarts), plus they feel that Thorman is ready to step in so they did well to pull off this trade.|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	Oh yes ...very much so. There aren't going to be 29 blown saves in Atlanta THIS year! And, with Gonzo, Soriano and Wickman? A lot of  Brave games just got shortened to six innings - and that can help the starters get by. If I were the Mets and Phillies? I'd be concerned.|`|13b0de74433c83d4cf642bc0dd6882e1aa	He's a solid guy in my mind.|`|ad709ef9a711681cc3b0eb8696e7a32daa	In my opinion, he is a quality reliever with a very strong arm and the proven ability to close, something the Braves desperately need.|`|95809af8f9fa26cb8ae9c199aba36841aa	Most Definitely!!! I watched him pitch a lot last year for the Pirates and he's a real solid pitcher!!! He is one of the best relievers in the game and he will fit right in with Atlanta.|`|6cf4a500ede30be073cfaad200f10304aa	Yes. Providing he has recovered fully from his injury.|`|2a0d5802e4ae9291c9b4707e195e74f7aa	I don't really like the trade for either team.  I believe that the Braves could have used Wickman for one last year and use Soriano as the setup man.  If Soriano could stay healthy, he should have become the closer later this year or in 2008.  If he couldnt stay healthy, then they should have looked for other options.  Giving up LaRoache up for a position that is already filled is kinda dumb.  Mike Gozalez is a good closer, however and he should do fine.|`|AA10392604	Yes|`|AA11710412	yes|`|PjlUWZIAaa	I have never herd of him|`|268bd886dc977bdaf1b9da3eb8ee25dcaa	He isn't the most dominating closer but he'll probably fair better on a better team.

Axyi9Slmaa	I think what they are asking is What is the most weight you can lift at one time? (1 Rep Max)  Or since this question is in the football forum, maybe you can give them your answer in terms of the NFL draft combine... How many reps of 220lbs can you do at once?|`|HRxLH78laa	Maxing is dumb. It makes people try to do too much and lift incorrectly and get hurt. Always lift the same way full range and all that... my opinion is if you can't get in just 4 reps then you shouldn't be training at that weight anyway.|`|TSEqHvS4aa	usually means what is the maximum weight you can press 1 time. the NFL combine tests athletes how many times a player can bench 225 lbs (not 220 lbs.).|`|554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	The standard is you go off of your one rep max|`|0mKkZvYHaa	If I remember correctly, you only have to bench press it 1 time, for that to be what you can bench. But if they ask how much do you bench press while working out, then it should be 10, 12 or 15, in my opinion.

Qu'on ammnage des carrefours avec feux, (ou autres ralentisseurs..) qui handicapent et ralentissent les vlos, sans meme se procuper de ces derniers? Qu'on construisent des pistes cyclables n'importe comment (cedez-le-passage en haut d'une cote, sans visiblit, ncessit de traverser la route pour continuer sur la piste...), et que celles-ci ne soit jamais nettoyer?

Sans parler des gaz d'echappement et des mgots par les fenetres, du nombre assourdissants de vhicule, de la pollution visuelle et sonore...    De plus, les vlos n'ont aucune obligation de rouler a droite de la voie (comme les voitures, ils ont la seule obligation de rouler "du bon cot" et de ne pas franchir les lignes). Le fait de rouler sur la droite de la route est un geste de prudence et de courtoisie..

Les joueurs cits (j'ajouterai Matfield  Toulon, Auradou & Pichot au Racing-Mtro) ou bien les joueurs conservs (notamment  Agen) savent que ces clubs l ont un budget assez imposant, similaire  ceux de certains clubs du Top14.    Puisque les budgets sont collossaux en ProD2, la masse salariale est quand meme imposante et permet d'attirer ces joueurs de renom.    Juges plutot    En Pro D2  Toulon : budget suprieur  10M eur  Racing-Mtro : budget 9M eur    En Top 14  Auch : budget 4M eur  Dax : budget 8M eur  Albi : budget 4,5M eur      De plus, le challenge de vouloir remonter en Top14 a d? vraiment motiver ces joueurs.  Merthens, Gregan, Matfield ont suivi le maitre Tana Umaga.    Quant  Sireli Bobo, avouons qu'au Biarritz Olympique, il a fait une saison en demi-teinte,  l'image du club. Et il veut se relancer. Alors, quant on sait les objectifs du Racing-Metro...    En esprant que chacun de ces joueurs aient fait le bon choix et surtout qu'ils se fassent plaisir, mme si, forcment, on attendra de leur part un apport d'exprience    D'ici que Caucaunibuca ne finisse pas sur la rade...(pour info, il vient d'etre licenci du SU Agen)    Bonne rception  Jean-Michel|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	Tu joue moins souvent  Ca va moins vite  C'est moins traumatisant    Boudjellal paye bien...|`|SeF12uzpaa	fin de carrire, ils recoivent beaucoup d'offres mais pr des dures limites (Larkham demandait 2 ans et Toulouse proposait 1+1), possiblilit de vivre avec une pression mdiatique moindre, bien pay (mieux pays?), moins traumatisant, en un mot : se faire plaisir, se faire de l'argent avec un boulot moins fatiguant et stressant que dans d'autres club|`|47b52630f3b4e1010504fc402e28c8ccaa	et bien l'argent surement  ceci dit je suis assez impatient de voir la D2 qui va etre un spectacle en soit|`|7FgmXE7Kaa	Les autres ont dja tout dit!!!lol!!!En effet,le pro d2 est tres excitant,surtout pour un club comme le RCT qui vise clairement une place sur le podium,voire plus,et puis il y a l'argent:si un club de Top 14 te propose 10 000 euros/mois et qu'un club de pro d2 te propose 15 000 euros/mois,tu choisis quoi?De plus,un club de Top 14 est dja au sommet,vu qu' il n'xiste pas de division suprieur,alors qu'un club de pro d2 lui peut encore monter,c'est logique!!Et puis la pro d2 respecte peut-etre plus les joueurs que le Top 14:moins de pression du rsultat,moins de sponsoring,moins de sur-mdiatisation,bref,une qualit de vie meilleure que pour les joueurs de Top 14 qui eux sont stresss a morts,craignant notamment la descente....Cela dit,cette tendance ne durera gure,car je parie que le niveau du Top 14 va beaucoup augmenter,notamment d'un point de vue financier,et alors le pro d2 rentrera plus dans le rang.|`|37807a85ac19b9571e11c7e4ee6daf40aa	Peu etre qu'aucun club du Top 14 ne leur a propos de challenge    Merthens = 34 ans  Gregan = 34 ans  Bobo = 31 ans    Ce ne sont plus des premieres jeunesses (mme si je trouve que Dominici a 100 fois sa place en equipe de France)
sEnTRjI5aa	on doit considrer l'volution du jeu, pour faire des comparaisons entre gnrations de joueurs : il est demand autre chose aux ailiers dsormais, que simplement dborder ou slalommer, ce que faisait en effet fort bien Blanco, au temps de sa splendeur!  or, le Blanco "dfenseur" n'tait pas tellement  son affaire dans ce secteur...  alors que maintenant, il est demand aussi aux ailiers de dfendre, quitte  se retrouver devant des piliers ou des 2me lignes, situations beaucoup plus rares il y a 15 ans !    pour moi, le meilleur compromis actuel est Rougerie : technique, puissance, explosivit sur les premiers appuis, placages destructeurs.|`|pE9YLPkKaa	Si il y a bien un poste ou on a des vrais cracks actuellement c'est l'aile, donc la nostalgie n'a pas lieu d'etre concernant ce point.|`|piOVZkNDaa	Ah bon on a un probleme niveau ailiers? Premire nouvelle! Heymans et Rougerie c'est pas assez bien?|`|3f0c5e748c0f9c56237c62090ad35a84aa	Pour moi, il n'y a que Dominici mme "vieux" qui a presque leurs envergures.    Mais aucun d'ailier "jeunes" ne peuvent actuellement conccurer avec les retraits comme l'anglais Rory Underwood ou encore Philippe Saint-Andr. Ou alors Jonah Lomu.|`|9it4bL16aa	Il ne faut pas oublier Aurlien Rougerie, ?a fait des annes qu'il est titulaire et excellent, il finit meilleur marqueur d'essai du championnat fran?ais cette anne ainsi que lors du challenge europen Heineken. Il est meilleur 14 que ne l'tait N'Tamack y'a pas de doute.  Dominici est toujours l et tjs performant et Clerc est encore jeune et joue bien, il y a aussi des jeunes qui seront l dans 1 ou 2 ans comme Benjamin Thierry, nouveau biarrot.  On a le meilleur centre du monde en la personne de Jauzion et ?a tous les pros te le diront.  Quant  notre 15 il n'est pas aussi rassurant que blanco c'est s?r mais il n'a que 25 ans,  18 ans il tait titulaire  Toulouse et gagnai son premier Brmus. Poitreneau est plein d'audace et dchire facilement les dfenses, mais son problme c'est qu'il est inconstant, mais Laporte lui fait confiance puisqu'il n'a choisi que lui en N 15. Et pour moi le meilleur n 15 au monde n'est pas australien ou nozlandais mais Irlandais en la personne de Dempsey|`|SeF12uzpaa	Domi joue encore...et nos ailiers sont trs, trs bons...meme si je ne le trouve pas assez match winners|`|8b844b702a1517d664e1689d0b6830aaaa	Rougerie, Clerc, Heymans et Dominici "vieux" je trouve que ?a tient la route|`|4d304ca195cc2b683e1e09f3cca39d3caa	N'tamack, fais-moi rire....    Blanco comme crit plus haut, a commenc  l'aile pour finir derrire... C'est s?r, que nous n'avons plus depuis un certain temps un arrire "S?R" comme Blanco ou Sadourny... Mais Le notre est encore jeune, tout plein de potentiel... Mme si inconstant!    A l'aile, je prfre avoir des "vieux" comme vous dites, tout plein d'exprience... et puis, oui les jeuns sont derrires, on arrive  la charnire entre deux gnrations. Il y a plus de nations qui jouent au rugby, ce magnifique sport devient de plus en plus reconnu, avec toujours plus d'adeptes, donc c'est normal que la comptition soit si froce...    Mais de mmoire, la France a toujours eu de trs bon pour ne pas dire excellents ailiers et arrire.    effectivement, le jeu a bcp chang... Je trouve moi aussi que notre quipe manque de piment... J'aurais sans doute pas monter la mme quipe, mais elle a du tonus. Et puis, je crois en nos avants!    N'oublions pas que c'est un sport collectif qui se joue  15 sur le terrain et  22 dans le stade sans compter le publique.|`|kiYCo96Zaa	Steevy boulay ?|`|n4QgkZY0aa	oui mais pas en france !

De mmoire Blanco n'tait pas un ailier. N'tamack a t aussi bien ailier que centre ou arrire. Quant  la gnration actuelle des ailiers : Clerc, Rougerie, Heymans... il y a vraiment pire non?|`|47327ddb3109948ca11156c97913bec1aa	Ce ne sont pas les joueurs qui sont moins bons , c' est surtout que les dfenses sont de plus en plus serres et qu ' elles prennent le pas sur les attaques.  Il est bien difficile de comparer une 3ime ligne d' aujourd' hui  (Bonnaire Betsen Nyanga par exemple)  celle de l' quipe de France des annes soixante( Crauste Moncla Celaya) qui tait considre  son poque comme la meilleure au monde. Il en est de mme pour les ailiers.|`|wGvOOgNJaa	oui il y a les toulousains du stade. Clerc et Heymans. clerc peut aussi depanner en 9 et heymans en 15. quant  rougerie, il doit sa selection  son essai en demi contre le stade. par contre pour la question, Blanco a commenc ailier avant de finir arriere et ntamack lui a commenc arriere avant de finir ailier.
WtmysNhCaa	I hope you're Brewers win the division because you know why?     I hate Cub fans. Their I said it.|`|LlKgy0DIaa	I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT YANKEES FAN'S COMMENT. anyway it has been pretty bad. but their young, so they have a good chance next year. as for the cubs, they play to win. NOW. they have a lot of veterans and if they don't win this year or next year they won't for a while. and the cards cant' keep their pitching for much longer. i mean really! their pitching is HORRIBLE.    don't feel bad, as i a cubby fan, i know this very well: WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR.     oh yeah and go cubbies- world champs '07|`|SuYLweGQaa	well cause the CHICAGO CUBS time is NOW  its harder to be a cubs fan  CUBS FAN 4 LIFE

They will pipe up w/ Cubs fans are drunks & blame the curse on not winning BUT, when asked why the Cubs won't win...... the haters will be the 1st to bring up the past / curse. most Cubs fans just have fun w/ it.    this is the mother of all next years - I BELIEVE    Eamus Catuli|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Thank You! Honestly I do not know why so many people hate on the Cubs.     But at least it gives me a way to vent by insulting the haters.     Eamus Catuli!|`|LlKgy0DIaa	It's simple. The Cubs fans love their Cubs, win or lose. And people can't understand why. So they bash.    I've been a Cubs fan all my life, and I am around Sox fans all the time...and they are always like "Cubs SUCK. they haven't won in 100 years and the Sox won in 2005!"    I don't get mad at them because they aren't worth arguing with. And plus, which team is better? That's right: THE CUBBIES!    I LOVE THE CUBS!!! EAMUS CATULI!!!!    [[world series champs '08]]|`|jXx3oojDaa	I don't have a problem with true Cubs fans, however i do have a problem with those that conveniently decided to become fans this year. That said, i haven't seen nearly as many Cubs bandwagoneers as i've seen Red Sox. "Red Sox Nation" is sickening.

dfBwVxXFaa	I hope you are just shooting paper.  if you start getting over 400 yards on a game animal, your pushing it.  I personally won't take a shot at game over about 300 yard, not because of lack of skill, but because I insist on a quick clean kill.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	I am big into long range rifle marksmanship its a passion of mine.  A .308 has a maximum effective kill range of approximately 800 yards however if your punching paper you should be good out past 1000 yards.  The .308 ifs a very versatile round good for low range shooting as well as shooting out to 800 yards.  The longest kill i know of with a .308 was at just over half a mile (880yd) by a Canadian in Iraq.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Get a bigger gun.  But beware, as you burn more powder you will burn barrels quicker, and there will be more recoil.  But the 30-378 Weatherby is good, and the 338-378 Weatherby is better.|`|9cpKYneZaa	.30-06 might be nice. But getting 1000 yds in .308 is swank.|`|au2o1GD5aa	The question is "effective range" for what? More velocity isn't necessarily the ticket for punching paper. I often encounter folks to claim very long shots (800 yards or so) on deer. I always ask them, "Really, what's the hold over on a deer at 800 yards?"    There is no effective use for any hunting rifle for that kind of range. If you want more velocity with a maximum load, your only option is to use a lighter bullet, but that will harm your accuracy and leave you with a lot less downrange punch.    I sight my 30-06 Ruger 77 in at 25 yards and have never shot at a deer beyond about 250, and that's out here on the North Dakota Prairie.|`|AA12274507	The holdover on a deer around 800 yards is about 13-15mins with a .308 depending on tail wind speed. Head wind....forget about it.|`|PXpeP7j1aa	.308 Winchester rounds are only effective to 800-1000yards MAXIMUM. Beyond that you have several options. I like to get the best one of a caliber and so the .338 lapua magnum comes to mind. The gun and ammo is expensive but it will reach out there close to 1800yards. If you want to stick with .308/.300 go with a .300 winchester magnum. It will reach out close to 1500 yards. For the ultimate range guns you have the .408 cheytac, any .50 bmg, a 14mm built by Anzio ironworks (good to 5000 yards/2.84 miles), or for the ultimate range queen you can buy a 20mm.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Not many cartridges have the steam to get any real expansion at 1000yds. Roughly speaking the minimum impact velocity required to get definite expansion with a .30 cal. Nosler Ballistic Tip in flesh is about 1,600fps. To get this at 1000yds with even the 180gr (the most aerodynamic of the .30 Ballistic Tips) requires a muzzle velocity of about 3,300fps. This puts you in the .300 Rem. Ultra Mag. or .300-378 Weatherby Magnum class.     Overall the .308 (and even the medium .300 magnums) is definitely not a big-game hunting cartridge at 1k yards. It's pretty much done before 600yds. That's one awfully long poke at a unwounded animal. In real life with a 200yd zero you're talking about a bullet drop at 600yds of around 7-8ft below line of sight....  or about 14-16moa of correction needed.
ukO3UJKJaa	Fisher has better synergy with the starting group, hes experienced (and proven). Farmar is a good pg, but i think hes better coming off the bench with the younger, faster second string with Odom and Ariza. I just dont see Fisher running off on the fast breaks that make the second string so great in my opinion. Hence, Fisher starts and Farmar comes in with the second string. :)|`|OeFNGqbzaa	yeah fisher is getting old we need some fresh legs on PG position|`|21nhdIXKaa	i think fisher, he is experienced and has a pretty shot, my favorite shooting form in the nba (and michael redd)|`|rxk90e6Taa	Farmar is so great coming off the bench. I don't know how good Fish would be coming off the bench.|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	i think phil knows what he is doing, you know he did coach MJ and get NBA championships. I think they like farmar running the second unit, he does it well|`|D8IFcgZAaa	your wrong and that per min stats means nothing because its based on a big IF .........have you seen farmar play 48 min or kobe/odom or even bynum? be realistic.|`|YeNp4m8haa	No|`|jplKBkhhaa	No.|`|kCzbWrIuaa	no, not yeah . he's good, but i think he would get nervous at times &such . good experience to watch fisher play &i think he plays better with the second unit .     they seem to speed up the place, since they're younger .|`|RdhCN6ZXaa	younger faster better|`|Is7WnDKAaa	nahh. farmar's like barbosa of the lakers except farmars better|`|IwyACb1Saa	farmar is better than fisher  But farmar plays better with a faster unit like the 2nd unit
RdhCN6ZXaa	brown  martin  salmons  thompson  miller     garcia  hawes  greene  moore  thomas  udrih|`|V03f8tmMaa	Miller is like their best player? Where is he?|`|tnqO91xoaa	I like ur line-up but I would put Miller as Center|`|VsmqrHoqaa	Who CARES?|`|4ir0Rg9taa	This is my starting lineup:  C: Brad Miller  PF: Jason Thompson  SF: John Salmon  SG: Kevin Martin  PG: Beno Udrih     Bench:   C: Spencer Hawes  PF: Mikki Moore  SF: Donte Greene  SG: Bobby Jackson  PG: Bobby Brown|`|UxnUCYQgaa	doesn't matter the line up, they all suck. Kevin Martin is soft with no heart, Spencer Hawes (with his 20 foot hook shots) sucks so bad, he made Bobby Hurley's draft looked like a steal. The only player who deserves to start is Jason Thompson--he's gonna be a beast. Only if they can clone him 4 times then they can have 5 Jason Thompsons in the starting line-up.|`|21nhdIXKaa	that is good, but i would have brad miller as center and b-jax as point, he might not deserve to be a starter but i just like him
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I don't think he does.  I think Vince wants TNA to be where it's at, not a major threat to his empire but just enough of one to keep his employees on their toes.    TNA IS a "major league" with a roster full of wrestlers good enough to be in the WWE.  If Vince wants any of them in the WWE he can offer them a lot of money and most of them would jump at the chance.  By the same token, he can use TNA as a "threat" to any of his employees who aren't performing well enough.    The WWE got very stagnant, stale, and boring when they had no competition at all.  The WWE wrestlers and writers got lazy.  But since TNA has emerged as a viable alternative to the WWE, the WWE and everybody who works there have picked up their game (to stay on top) and their shows have improved.    I think TNA is right where Vince wants them to be.  Not a major threat but enough of one to keep his own wrestlers focused on staying on top and making their shows better.|`|mvTc3GxNaa	number one, NT, TNA is a threat.    number 2, jeff would never sell out to the fans or his superstars|`|YTLlMdhDaa	It would never happen, but if it did, WWE would suck even more than it does right now. Monopolizing the industry is a lousy idea. No one wants to see the same thing over and over again. At least I don't. One of the good things about TNA is it gives wrestling fans something else to watch besides the same old WWE storylines.|`|sgN3xFtWaa	no because tna is no real threat. if they were doing good and beating wwe in ratings sometimes then they wold never sell so tna will never be bought even if it goes bankrupt as all the stars in tna can just sign will the wwe. vince bought ecw and wcw back in the good days to show his dominance. now he needs to prove nothing. plus he really needed the star power back then.|`|caLYx9nVaa	No, because for one all of the guys T.N.A. push are Vince's sloppy seconds. Guys past their prime or didn't make a impact and Vince didn't care he kept (except maybe the messy Angle issue and he did try to keep Christian who may be coming back anyway.) Besides them who would Vince really want? A.J. is the only one I could really see Vince possibly pushing, the rest of T.N.A. roster would be dark matches if not released. T.N.A. is no threat to W.W.E.|`|UvMP9yOCaa	Maybe. They're kinda have that Attitude Era type thing going on.|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	buying tna like **** and ***?|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	well jeff and vince hate each other, problem one.  tna isnt a threat so there is no need to buy, problem two.  in times like these when he needs to do something better with his money, problem three.|`|qbEeecndaa	no why would he want that train wreck|`|5WoJN0Rfaa	Vince will just wait another year or so when Jeff Jarrett comes to his doorstep and says you wanna buy TNA    Just like WCW did    I never thought TNA would survive past 1 year anyways|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Vince has thoughts of buying everything (and everyone)

9vNeOUBUaa	good question.... I'd say Brendan Witt I guess.....    of the forwards : probably Jeff Tambellini|`|HNEWf7ILaa	Jackets    Steve Mason|`|axxQzOCHaa	Team: Canadiens  Player: it's gotta be Komisarek, too big and slow. After he'd get striped of the puck he'd probably get winded coming back on D :(|`|HJuOSvmdaa	Steve said Datsyuk?  Wow, he would be a great general manager LOL.    I would say Lilja haha...Datsyuk scores on breakaways a lot.  But forward-wise...maybe Maltby.|`|f9BRmMNVaa	Probably Evgeni Nabokov.|`|x5lqWRT3aa	Vancouver: Mats Sundin =P  More or less, we can't trust this guy in the box either.|`|G33E41IBaa	Other than the goalies, probably Dainius Zubrus.  He's a great player, but believe me.  He's slow as hell!  When you watch him on the ice, he always gets beat on races to the puck.  The other team would catch up to him in a heartbeat, and it wouldn't be a breakaway anymore lol.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Boston-  Shane Hnidy.|`|YBpjA72faa	Team: Flyers  Player: Derian Hatcher if he is healthy, but on the current, uninjured roster, I'd probably say Ossi Vaananen. The man is a stay at home defenseman, whose only shots come from the point. He hardly ever joins the offensive rush and focuses more on the defensive aspect of the game, leaving the offense to his partner, Timonen.|`|p16GVXJgaa	Pavel Datsyuk.|`|AA12089021	Flyers: Scott Hartnell  Here is a sample of him from a shootout, he has not had much more success on breakaways.  He should pull up and wait for his teammates when he gets a breakaway.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3tJzJ3Ko...    The Benny Hill theme is classic!|`|g5wninniaa	Flyers---Go look up the leaders in short handed goals...there are 3 flyers tied for the lead at 4!  so either: gagne, carter, richards.    usually shorthanded goals are scored on a breakaway|`|0Nyry3rZaa	probably Nik Antropov|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Andrew Peters, or Ryan Miller
2s244jGgaa	Shame.    He was such a fantastic player down back for the swans and always was such a happy bloke to boost the mood and help out the young guys. I will miss seeing his elbow pop out, and i will miss his irish accent.|`|mXFOru11aa	yeah that was a huge suprise|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Doesn't he have another year on his contract?  He could at least finish that before doing a Juddy.    The Irish guys aren't really working out for you.|`|lkA2L59Gaa	he's going back to Ireland and has retired from the AFL before he's contract was up    swans don't have anyone to replace him swans are stuffed lol    they can't make the finals now    too many old players and not enough good young emerging talent    don't shoot the messenger just telling ya the truth =]|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Yes this news came as a bit of a shock, he still had this year of his contract to run, but choose to do the ol harry houdini and disappear.    I don't think the swans have another player of his ilk who can replace him, he carried the ball through the lines as good as any one, the swans will surely miss Kennelly.|`|WifhQyD4aa	Yeah it's true he was tslking about it last season so the Swans started to prepare with experienced pickups in the backline through trades, like matner, while still getting some young ball movers through the centre. That's why they picked up Shaw they were preparing for next season but i guess he couldn't wait that long.|`|ihHAcLaLaa	Um, I think he was supposed to leave this year, his contract has expired but he might not! I have no idea who will replace him! Maybe that guy we got from Collingwood (GROAN) will be his replacement. I'm really upset 'cause he's my favourite player!    Oh, for the record, I'm 12, not 15, and I made my list up in 10 minutes! took me longer to memorize the books of the bible!|`|e4roTumKaa	he has left to play gaelic football back home|`|TSaSUeycaa	Don't forget that another Irishman is waiting in the wings!!! From all reports Brendan Murphy is a better AFL player, at this beginning stage of his career, than Tadhg was at his beginning. So who knows-we might be getting a much more talented replacement but, oh my goodness, we are going to miss Tadhg. I don't think we would have lost him so early if his father hadn't died so suddenly!!! His mother (very understandably) has been putting pressure on him, ever since, to return home!!! The inside word is that he really doesn't want to go but, out of respect for his mother's wishes, he has decided to go back to Ireland. He is a naturalised Aussie so he can come back anytime he wants-hopefully sooner rather than later!!! Good luck to you Tadhg xxx|`|HxluJK2Vaa	I am hoping Mattner can step up this year, Shaw now looks like a very good pick up.    How much more was left in Kennelly's legs, they have taken a pounding over the last two seasons. I wish him luck, he may come back... but would Sydney pick him up?    The Swans blooded a few young guys last year, this year will be fun to see them progress, but not so optimistic about the year though. The forwards will have to kick bigger scores as the backline looks a little vulnerable... not sure Barry can hold key forwards any more, that only leaves Bolton as the key stopper. The ruck division also looks thin as Jolly can't do it alone again.    Andrew|`|SZNsSWH1aa	Unfortunately he is leaving the Swans. While it is a terrible blow to such a wonderful club they will survive. Nick Malceski also has been given similar training and has learnt from Kennelly how to inspire the club. Good luck to him and all the best. Wish he could have stayed one more season so dedicated Swans fans could say goodbye.|`|X9xWZdgSaa	They might be able to find a place for Nick Davis again|`|UYYbFgcgaa	Well it will help us Doggies which will win this year. Go doggies.|`|AUmdOhBbaa	yes i think it is something to do with family problems|`|5AbmMxnraa	A great loss to the game. Kennelly had excellent leadership skills as well as being a damaging half back flanker. He will be hard to replace but someone wil step up. As a Sydney supporter I wish him well and hope he wil have an impact on the Gaelic game. He is a great ambassador regardless of the code.
LN2oLOg8aa	i run treads everyday. i take it slow though because i do it before work. i run 15 mins. a day. i used to run 30 mins but right now i just have to settle with 15 - 20.|`|c5menwRwaa	Hi Dustin,    What Komits says is very true, the average street fight lasts between 10 seconds to 5 mins MAX with most around the minute mark with all the push, shove and roll around cr@p included.    I run a lot due to my work but for your MA training, definately contentrate on what is called interval training, which is a mix of high intensity with a cool down in between.    An example is 1 minute flatout sprint, 2 minute walk and repeat several times. You can increas the sprint time or lower the cool down time to progress your training and increase your cardio.    Another good option is circuit training, I don't mean running on a track, circuit training is a circuit of varied workouts.    An example is 2 minute skipping, sprint to some weights and do reps, leopard crawl to a chin-up bar and do heaves, sprint back to the rope and skip. repeat as required.    This type of training fatigues your major muscle groups, making your heart rate increase dramatically on the sprints, ease into this kind of training though, very easy to burn out.    Fighting fitness is a whole different ball game from the normal training routines out there, you have to get really creative and get really motivated to to increase fighting fitness.    Good luck.|`|ToIKcUdCaa	im 16 and i run up mt lofty every sunday    bout 16 - 20 km up and down    depends which way you go|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	My dojo is about 2 miles from my home and I run there to teach and run back home afterwards every night. So I guess my answer is 4 miles daily. Now keep in mind that I do not jog. I run at an even set pace to the dojo and back six days a week. It is enjoyable but where I live it has been really cold lately.    Edit - who is the dipshit that gave me a thumbs down? How can you give me a thumbs down for answering the question? Man this is so lame and it shows that people on here are often full the ****.|`|6nGII584aa	i dont run at all. as part of my training.  doing long runs can help you sparring but if you only do 2 or 3 minute rounds it uses a different energy system so you are best geoing lots of pretty much sprints that only use that ammount of energy. if that didnt make much sence wat i mean is just go and run faster for 2 or 3 minutes then have a minute break or so then go again. im pretty sure thats what i learnt.    well fighting doesnt normally last 30 minutes so why build up fitness to last that long.|`|wphUIz0naa	three miles every other day.  The people who say it isn't worth your time are the people who will run out of gas.|`|jvRZfkvRaa	I just started lifting and running again about 2 weeks ago. but what am doing is getting up in the morning before work and go lift and run.     start out with lifting.  Do two sets of muscles  like chest and abs, do about 3 to 4 different exercise. doing 3 sets each.  If I start with chest I do one set and right after that with out a break I do one set of abs. I go back and forth doing that with out any breaks. KEEP ADDING WEIGHT after each set. 5 to 10 pounds is what I shoot for.     After am done with that I will run a mile or two.     am doing 4 to 5 days a week|`|fRosDAZEaa	I have in the past, but now where I live, it's a little dangerous so I have to improvise with calisthenics to maintain my target heart rate.
UhL7m301aa	The jackets will go as far as Nash and Mason take them.     I really don't see them finishing any better than 7th... I also don't like the way Hitch is running mason into the ground especially with his history of back problems.     I honestly see the Jackets being one and done or  missing the playoffs... they just have too much trouble on offense.|`|nu0kSDqWaa	I think they will. They are looking good and if they can beat the Wings a few times, they should have no problem. The only teams that stand between you and a playoff birth; Minnesota and Edmonton. Steve Mason is a wonderful goalie is currently under-rated and I believe he will go on a hot streak.    You guys have already beaten my team twice, by the same score and I was there for the 2nd one, sadly.|`|Ipqr3nbLaa	Very good chance. its about 50/50 haha.|`|HNEWf7ILaa	Same,   I don't want to say it 'cuz it'll jinx them, but I think we will.|`|v7UR00HLaa	What are the chances......? is not gramatically correct.  That is a misplaced modifier and dangling modifier. You need a subject. I dont know what you are saying buddy.

XUUGN0E7aa	I paintball, I use to be on a team, but now I am not and just do some rec ball.     Lets just say.     Have you ever been giving a dead arm? Well a paintball feels like that but more soft and in a smaller area. Trust me when you play paintball you don't feel the hits.|`|aO2za06Yaa	It doesn't hurt at all honestly, your adrenaline should be high enough to the point where you really wouldn't feel it. Just don't think about getting shot and play the game and you won't notice it after awhile.|`|4reh2baIaa	Hey I'm just turning thirteen today (the 29th). I've been paintballing for a while now and it really doesn't hurt if your adrenaline is pumping. Sometimes it feels like someone is throwing a little rock at you.|`|VR2biZutaa	Well you see it depends on if the painball breaks or not.  If the painball breaks it will hurt less than if the paintball remains intact after impact.|`|vfPrYVmYaa	IDK but i no someone who got hit with heaps and he had massive bruises all over him, but he didnt have any protection on or anything|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	It is like getting hit with a bazooka.  It isnt bad at all unless you have female senses|`|lFPsPzxzaa	it depends on how pain tolerant u are|`|NC06gi04aa	bee sting.   or hit yourself hard with a ruler...|`|UlrIgfH1aa	Just play...I took my little sister 2 play when she was 12 and she loved it...Its very fun & doesnt hurt
7e7cb48ca14510a1f4daeb63d56a4974aa	I agree! Go Tarheels!|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I love college basketball. I live in Kentucky and if you don't love UK something is wrong. College players play hard all the time. They play hard so they can get to the NBA.|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	I think college is very exciting, but not always... sometimes you have 2 bad teams playing.  2nd you rarely have the strength and speed of the NBA in college. College guys are usually 17-21 so not fully developed.|`|tnqO91xoaa	u stupid h0m0 go jump on someones d1(k    lmao im just a nerd|`|iBWAVYJYaa	No way NBA is much better|`|V03f8tmMaa	Hell no dont even try to compare NBA and college. I mean college if u start watching it they are players that u have never heard of and the NBA there are only 30 teams and way more intensity filled because the players are way better|`|AA10744471	It depends. The committed fans of college basketball, especially those who have relatives, friends, boyfriends in the team, and the loyalties and devotion to the players are more intense and emotional, thus the "intensity of the moment" is more pronounced. However, in the NBA the players are more skilled and professional, thus the finesse and abilities of the players give more entertainment and joy to the paying public. So, both are very exciting and entertaining.|`|7c9e5548e9394636c11cf3954cb86abeaa	I agree, but the NBA is cool too.|`|VsmqrHoqaa	Yea, because they play for a chance to play in the NBA|`|jWVZ9gFFaa	Totally agree. Even when I do see an exciting pro game, I stop and realize "o yeah, these guys are getting paid millions of dollars a season..." and it kind of detracts from any excitement, idk why tho. Also, the intensity in college games is awesome, especially since the students are right there going nuts. The NBA Finals are pretty exciting, but have NOTHING on march madness.|`|3Widbjn2aa	college ball is lame. 35 seconds makes it way too boring. always passing it around the top of the key for 30 of them.|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	u must be special.... exciting? college is slow!!!!!!!!!!!! not enough dunks college is taught to do a layup and not to dunk. They run to many plays that take forever. There isnt alot of fastbreak points. not enough threes. intensity? thers alot of intensity college players only make 45% of their jumpers. Its not exciting, at least when the crowd is chanting in the NBA a player actually makes a shot and akes everytihng perfect. in college bball the crowd will get excited on offense and then the players will miss his shot its pretty g@y.|`|21nhdIXKaa	i LOVE the tournament in college basketball, its so exciting, its the best time of the year, and i like the passion that the players play with    nba can be exciting too though|`|rxk90e6Taa	college hoops are good too. But they seemingly play harder for pro contracts. I don't believe the professionals play just for the money.|`|UboOmr3waa	I like Nba better.|`|LOAUbEGJaa	yeah if you're referring to the cheerleaders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6UUCCImVaa	nah man, the nba has more talent, college basketball doesnt have kobe or lebron
XUUDRM7yaa	Scotty is flippin' amazing.  There are lots and lots of fantastic riders these days but he's one of the few that really caught my attention.  I just wish he'd wear a helmet more often.|`|ROWbHIqTaa	scotty cranmer i think hes a better rider. busts more tricks|`|zB8dFFI7aa	morgan has more flair, but scotty always tries to go big,  depends on how you look at them.
aQLTXwUbaa	Definitely.    If you've been swimming since you were very little, then you've got a leg up on those newer to the sport.  It would take very little for you to get back into shape and get really fast.  If you got good instruction as a young child, you probably don't even need lessons. The major thing would be to just get in the water and get stronger.  Then you could use those open lessons from the team to just refine your techniques before the cuts are made.    But if you are interested, check out some books from the library or off Amazon. The Total Immersion series seems good, they have books and DVDs, and YouTube shows underwater film of good techniques.    Just try to get back in the pool 3-4 times per week, with a longer workout on the weekend.  Quickly build up your foundation with some long slow swims, and then start to do timed intervals in all the strokes.  Don't neglect your turns since you're going to need them when back on the team.

50bEHtYfaa	Yes Gatorade is probably the best. Gatorade contains sugar and electrolytes your body looses while you perspire. Not to mention, gatorade tastes better and gives you more energy than water.|`|H1VIZsutaa	Gatorade makes me sick when I'm tired.|`|I3jXJEyAaa	I prefer water..it's better at quenching thirst.|`|V03f8tmMaa	I don't think you should drink gatorade during a game. You shouldn't drink anything you should just spit water out once its in your mouth cause if you do you will get cramps and wont be able to run|`|qSR66oRiaa	yes, much better|`|xgGTyqHRaa	No, because if you drink water and you get to tired and drink to much water you heart will start to stuggle to pump more blood, because you blood will get think and trust me my i knew someone who had a heart attack from drinking to much water, and something bad happen, now i am not trying to scare you, i dont want you to hate me, but i am just telling you what will happen, and from their it wont be good, but if you drink gatorade, you wont have to drink that much because it is a thirst quencher, and you dont need drink that much to not be thirsty any more, and if you dont drink to much that means you dont get any cramps, and if you drink water you will keep on drinking because after you are done drinking you will still want more because it is not a thirst quencher, it always helps for me, So you should take my advice, and try it. O ya, and by the way nice question, i like interesting questions once in a while, WELL GOOD LUCK IN YOUR BASKETBALL GAME, I AM GOING TO CROSS MY FINGERS AND HOPE YOU WIN! SEE YAH!   PS. I would prefer rain Gatorade, ok now i done, Thank you see yah!|`|3zfun0Ikaa	Gatorade has a lot of electrolytes in it, which hydrate. Water doesnt. I can notice the difference myself. Go with Gatorade Tiger, it has more electrolytes, or G2 if you dont want alot of sugar in it.

So hers what gonna happen, on the last seconds of regulation, it will be 78-70, and the Cardinals will get a 96 yrd hail mary TD, and then they are gonna get the 2 pt conversion    then, in overtime, there are gonna be  amillion blocked field gals, and someones gonna shoot the foot ball witha  sniper.    then in triple over time, the steelers get a 62 yrd field goal.    and thats it    Time 4 hrs and 24 minutes.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	blowout! cards too much on offense. two weeks off might hurt them though.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	Pitt...close    Pitt-21  Cards-17|`|YCwmCDkUaa	*copy & paste*    Steelers by 10...    31-21...|`|QGBSOpt7aa	Pittsburgh  Close    Under 45 points|`|1eb29e16166794203a3fa52b5c9b51b8aa	Pittsburgh Steelers|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	the RACINE AVENUE/CHICAGO/ ST. LOUIS/ PHOENIX/ARIZONA CARDINALS.  it will be close early but, ARIZONA, will walk away.|`|py0DpCh4aa	cardinals  close|`|44plW4Lfaa	no way, its going to be a blowout by pittsburgh. here's whats going to happen. 1st q- cards get ball first and get a touchdown on the first possession of the game 7-0 cards. the steelers will tie it with a touchdown pass. 7-7 tie.   2nd q- cardinals get a field goal very early. 10-7 cards. then as time runs out steelers kick a field goal to tie it at 10. cardinals are outplaying steelers right now but thats about to change.  3rd q-  cardinals good redzone continues keeping pittsburgh to 2 field goals in the 3rd quarter. 16-10 steelers.   4th q- yes the game is still close right now, but arizona will choke very shortly. steelers get ball very early 4th quater. steelers sustain a somewhat of a long drive, taking 6:15 clock, then roethlisberger will throw a 40yd td pass to hines ward. 23-10 steelers. now its starting to look like a blow out, but the cardinals worst mistakes are coming up. kurt warner is trying to comeback from a 13 point deficit with 8:29 to play. they get to the steelers 28yd line, before polamalu picks it kurt warner at the steelers 20 yd line, and brings it back to midfield. then the steelers get two long passes completed. 1st and goal at the six. parker carries it for 5 yards. 2nd and goal at the 1, this could be the best goal line stand in superbowl history, but it wont be a goal line stand, because moore will bust it in for the touchdown.    30-10 steelers- final score

QJZ3DRtDaa	At this time, only current year's scorecards are visible at pgatour.com, and not all events will be listed. It's an OK site, but it could so much better, especially as the official home site of the PGA Tour.    Here's what you do ...    Go to: http://www.pgatour.com/r/players/    Select a player and click on the green arrow beside his name.    Once his page appears, you'll see "Archived Scorecards" in the upper right-hand corner of the page. The rest is self-explanatory.    If there is a scorecard for someone specific that you want pre-2009, add a note and I'll see what I can do to dig it up.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	My best guess on this would be PGAtour.com.  They probably have them, however you may need to contact them direct.  I Really have not looked for this kind of Info before....so this is only a guess
