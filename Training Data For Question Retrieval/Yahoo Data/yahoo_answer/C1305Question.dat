20090128211839AA8NpGj	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Does this disprove the existence of an afterlife?	Ketamine has been used 100's of times by scientists to simulate near-death experiences. Ketamine can produce all the features of the near-death experience, including travel through a dark tunnel into light, the conviction that one is dead, telepathic communion with God, visions, out-of-body experiences and mystical states. If near-death-experiences can be reproduced by a drug, thereby giving a false glimpse into the afterlife for some, then aren't real near-death experiences the same? Thus, isn't the whole idea of an afterlife produced by a drug that signals the brain to cause hallucinations and visions that are taken out of the person's nonconscious mind (which can include the deeply-ingrained relgions views of each particular person)?

At -42°C, what is the ratio of the rate constant for the catalyzed reaction to that for the uncatalyzed reaction?   (Assume the frequency factor A is the same for each reaction.)         2.)One of the concerns about the use of freons is that they will migrate to the upper atmosphere, where chlorine atoms can be generated by the reaction   CCl2F2 ---> CF2Cl + Cl (photolysis of Freon-12)      Chlorine atoms can also act as a catalyst for the destruction of ozone.

20090225155701AA9bWVt	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Bridge Help, Physics side project.?	Hey there.       In my physics class we are supposed to built a bridge out of balsa wood Little square strips 3/32 of a inch I think wide.       The overall goal isnt to hold the most weight, but to have the best weight to mass ratio of the bridge. Basically, we have to have the bridge's weight very low, and a high amount of mass hanging from it. The better the ratio, the higher the grade you get.       Which bridges are able to hold the most amount of weight with the least amount of material needed to built?       Would an arch bridge, or suspension bridge, be good.       Or can anyone recommend a certain type of bridge for me to build, any other tips are appreciated as well!

20090128223619AAM0vcJ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Is the distance we can see into space limited?	We know from general relativity that light bends towards a gravity source (due to the shift of space-time).  That being said, it's a fair assumption that light will always curve around the center of mass of the universe, correct?  Since light has a common speed in space, the rate of curvature depends on the proximity of the light to the center of mass of the universe. For this reason, can we assume that there is a point at which the flight path of the light wave transitions from hyperbolic to an actual orbit (in which case, you will end up not being able to see past a certain distance threshold in the universe)?  Has this been theorized?

20090129000805AAFurIk	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Word problem: solve using matrix method?	Hey guys. Having some serious problem solving these:      (1) A historian knows there were 29 men on a ship. The daily wine allowance was 252 ounces, and the monthly payroll as 30,000 maravedis. The historian still assumes the daily wine allowance per man was 8 ounces for seamen and 12 ounces for officers. The salary was 1000 maravedis a month for a seamen and 2000 for an officer. Calculate how many seamen and officers made the voyage, or show that the historians assumptions are incorrect because the equations are inconsistent.      (2) On a European vacation a student spent $30 a day for housing in England, $20 a day in France, and $20 a day in Spain. For food she spent $20 a day in England, $30 a day in France, and $20 a day in Spain. She also spent $10 a day in each country for incidental expenses. Her records show a total of $340 spent for housing, $320 for food, and $140 for incidental expenses. Calculate the number of days the traveler spent in each country or show that the records must be incorrect because the amounts spent are incompatible with each other.       PLEASE help me! I haven't a clue as to how to start organizing these at all! Please do NOT direct me to a "math problem solver" website as it is not at all helpful. If you know how to solve these personally, please help me out. It is TRULY appreciated! Thank you.

20090128233446AAqVwfW	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Equation of perpendicular line through a triangle...?	"A line through a vertex of a triangle which is perpendicular to the opposite side is called and altitude. Find the equation of the altitude through the vertex A of the triangle ABC where A is the point (2,3), B is (1,-7) and C is (4,-1)."      I began by plotting the points on a graph and connecting them to form the triangle. I then drew a straight line through point A so that the line would be the triangle's altitude.       Then I found the gradient of line AC, which is -2. So I thought that the gradient of the perpendicular line would be 1/2. I then tried to find the equation of the perpendicular line by using the coordinates of point A and the gradient 1/2. My formula was: (y-3)=1/2(x-2). My answer: y=1/2+2. But apparently this is wrong. Please help?   Thanks!

I've always done this to dry stuff out (yes, including paper) and have never had a problem (except the soles of my shoes melting a little- but that is neither here nor there). I read that the flashpoint and ignition terperature are both over 600 degrees.      WTF MATE?!?!?

20090129020314AAnA8aV	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Molarity and mole fraction question?	Calculate the molarity and mole fraction of acetone in a 1.00 m (molality) solution of acetone (CH3COCH3) in ethanol (C2H5OH). (Density of acetone = 0.788 g/cm^3; density of ethanol = 0.789 g/cm^3). Assume that the columes of acetone and ethanol add.         right now i've got that you assume 1000 g of solvent which means that there's one mole of acetone. I think i remember the teacher dividing that by the density, but i don't remember...i dunno what to do next.

I have measured a beta decay with a half life of 27 ± 5 seconds and a gamma decay with a half life of 210 ± 20 seconds. Having checked online I see that the first half life is close to what silver does while the second one is too high (a value closer to 145 seconds would apparently fit better with silver), but if I didn't know it was silver beforehand how would I know where to look?

And then others have weight loss as a side effect.  What about Effexor, Topomax, and Lamictal?  Do any of these cause weight gain or weight retention?  Or do they have weight loss as a side effect?  I am concerned because the doctor has just changed my medication and years ago when I took Depokote I gained 35 lbs. in less than 3 months.....it was devastating to me and did NOT do anything to help my mental/emotional health.  As soon as he took me off of it I dropped the weight.  But he has recently just prescribed some new medication and do not want to go through that again.  Please help me.

Sydney, where I live, is exactly at the SAME latitude of LA's (33 something degrees SOUTH of the equator, though), but our winters never reach the mid 70s. We are always in the mid 60s.       Why is that? Why are LA winters much warm than Sydney's?

20090129034340AAbK51g	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How does a free neutron contain potential energy?	So I know that when a special isotope of hydrogen that contains a neutron fusses with another, that helium is created and a free neutron is released. What I don't understand is how that free neutron can contain potential energy, and how humans hope to one day contain that energy.    I assume that that free neutron can be used in additional fusion but how can any present energy be transformed into something like heat energy?    Thanks!

20090129034238AAAMR8b	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Do you think this could be Paranormal?	When I was 10 years old on Halloween night, I was standing on some stairs on the 2nd floor of an apartment building. I happened to look up and I see smoke coming over the top of the building.  I was a curious kid so I told my dad that I was going to go investigate so I ran down the stairs and went out to the street and this is when I saw it was a car  on fire in the in the parking lot across the street. Me and my Father watched it burn for about a minute nobody was inside the car then to my surprise the car very slowly backs out, makes a left turn in reverse and rolls out into the middle of the street, then turned and traveled a slight distance up the street in flames. I made a S shaped maneuver from its parking spot out into the street.  It was not down hill this was on level surface.  It was one of the most strangest things I have ever seen.

20090129034348AApTsMI	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Why do planets revolve around the sun?	For example,a planet like our earth revolves around the sun. A simple answer seems to be that the sun attracts the earth due to its gravitational pull. But, according to action-reaction law, the earth also attracts it with an equal force. Hence the gravitational force of the earth and the sun get cancelled. Then why does the earth keep revolving around the sun?? Also, where does the centripetal force come into picture??      I am very confused....please help....

20090129034246AA6TA6X	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Why do Black Holes have such a strong gravitational force?	Hey. This puzzels me deeply as my science encyclopedia doesn't explain it clearly. When a death of a star comes to pass and the creation of a black hole occurs why is there a massive change in gravitational attraction? Yes a star has a relativly impressive force of attraction but what caused the formed black hole to have such an attraction force that it is able to engulf and compress the atoms of light etc? Should the original star have the same gravitational force than it's later formed black hole?       Has this got something to do with escape velocity or more importantly the law of Inverse Square(distance and mass)? Could it also have something to do with the curve of the spacetime fabric and the infinate density created? All comments are very much appreciated.
