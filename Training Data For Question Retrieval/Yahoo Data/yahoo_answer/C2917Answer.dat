XK9RLaPeaa	It is illegal. In Fl, it is illegal to kill an Oak tree without proper permits (that are difficult to get). Same for many other states. So plant one and dont get caught. If they chop it down, they better have the permits, goverment officials or not lol.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Yes it is.  But getting permission to plant a native species will be easy.  They don't want people planting just any tree.      Besides that the government has spent a lot of time coming up with land use plans etc etc.  They would not be happy if hundreds of people just randomly started planting trees.  However, if they had an organized approved tree planting event, they'd be very pleased.|`|maQTi6Aeaa	I think it is illegal. Not sure though. Why don't you just call them? =)|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	Yes, it is illegal without the appropriate approval. If you plant it and get caught you'd get fined and/or jailed.|`|exbHFylkaa	Government don`t care. It`s the environmentalist fruit group that will throw a fit. It`s not Natural
zTj6bnIlaa	I agree 100%.<br>  One day my bin was unemptied because (i think) they saw a bottle in it. It wasn't the first time and on sunday after a few beers i thought about it and snapped. I loaded my rubbish into 3 bin liners , drove to the local council offices and dumped it outside their front door. I did not consider this fly tipping as i was only taking it to the people to whom i already pay ￡900p.a to deal with it.<br>  A lot of stuff nowadays is stored in warehouses and not recycled since the chinese market for this stuff dropped.|`|a9e5IZOWaa	if i didn't know better i'd swear you're my son who sounds just like you!<br>  <br>  i do recycle but only for the reason that i like to see how little space i can get it into.  i think that there will come a time when we are charged on volume and weight.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Who cares what happens in 100 years - what a very sad philosophy.

Why not sequester some carbon in a landfill.  Recycling is mostly a waste of time and effort and materials.  If it is economical, it will get recycled.  If it isn't, they why would you want to.  Those that think we are running out of space simply haven't done the math.  It is true that noone wants a landfill in their backyard but that is a different issue.  In fact, go to Google earth and look around.  I suspect you can find plenty of space and the volume of trash is grossly exaggerated.  The truth is that it is a political cause, a leftist one, and they don't want to admit to being wrong, so it just gets pushed to ridiculous extremes.  Littlerobber girl is a good leftist.  She ridicules you for not following leftist thinking or lack there of.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	I remember when I was a kid, garbos (I think they're called sanitation engineers in the US) were super fit athletic types who would run beside the trucks picking up bins and emptying the contents into the back of trucks with their hands.  Those days are over of course.  Now they drive around and pick these things up with a robotic claw.  How quickly things change.  I don't remember them going into anyones back yard though - if it wasn't on the footpath, it didn't get emptied.  <br>  <br>  Recycling is all well and good and I do want to preserve the environment, but what's so terrible about land fills.

I don't really have to do any extra work, they sit side by side, and in fact I don't have to take the trash out nearly as often.  What does go into a dumpster I compact since I pay by volume, not weight, so I only have to have the dumpster emptied out a couple of times a year, plus there is nothing organic in it to stink or attract vermin.<br>  <br>  The organic stuff we compost, and that I'm getting ready to put on my garden this spring; the metals that can be recycled are separated out and put into piles; each spring my teenage son loads it up and sells the salvage-last spring he netted $700, not bad for less than a day of loading and hauling, especially for a 16 year old kid.<br>  <br>  The point is that if it is actually less work than hauling out your smelly  trash every few days to have it lay out in the street until it is picked up, and you (or your son) can make better than fifty bucks an hour, it seems stupid to pay somebody to haul off "trash" that you can easily turn a profit on.  Small potatoes, maybe...but that's the way recycling works-in the U.S. nowadays.  Heck, there's guys here that drive around in their pickup trucks picking stuff up off curbs that other people are too lazy to recycle, then selling the salvage when they get a load and they're paying their whole grocery bills with it.  You're basically 1) paying for something, 2) hauling the remains out to the curb that you could sell, and 3) paying somebody else to make money off the stuff you toss.  And to top it off, most people would call you names like stupid, lazy, slovenly, pig...uncaring b*stard, ignorant slob, moron.  Not that EYE am, you understand, it's just that the list just goes on and on, and I personally wouldn't want all of MY friends and neighbors laughing at me behind my back or sneering at what they think is irretrievable slothdom and idiocy.|`|3NZV65alaa	I recycle everything possible, and have done for 40+ years.<br>  If it can not be recycled, I try to find another use for it.<br>  <br>  I can understand your sentiments about the bin men of today, but I still recycle/reuse everything possible.<br>  This has nothing to do with so-called 'Global Warming' , it is simply that I detest waste of any kind.|`|t1zlbOURaa	If it saved energy to recycle, you wouldn't have to pay to get your garbage recycled.

In the past it was used as a derogatory term for african americans, and can still be a sensitive title.  <br>  <br>  I have used it in the context of my neighbors children who love to climb trees "wow your a little monkey aren't you."  Using it in this manner wouldn't be considered bad, however calling someone who is not showing behavior that is monkey like might land you in hot water.|`|GN5MC1U7aa	i would say it all depends on the context.

AA10959663	Frying pans are made to withstand high tempratures.But should the temperature exceed what is recommended for the frying pan.Im almost positive you will burn some of the chemicals that may or may not be toxic, they used to make the pan.From personal experience I believe they may be toxic as I got real sick once when I inhaled the smoke.My best advice to you is to take the pan out side.Away from windows so that the smell cannot travel back into your house through drafts.<br>  In order to get the smell out.. The only thing I could really reccommend is fresh air.I know it may be cold but open some windows and let the smell go out.Febreeze is a great odor eliminator.It actually neturalizes odors instead of masking them like some air fresheners do.My next advice would be to wash the draperies if you have any in the kitchen,the tablecloth,any kind of fabric that may have been in the room when the pan burnt.That way the smell wont stick to the fabric.<br>  If you feel you can possibly salvage the frying pan and or want to.. A poster mentioned viniger andI agree with her or him.Its safe and non toxic.If your trying to salvage the pain.Dont use a rough surfaced sponge as it will scratch teflon and will make you very ill if you choose to use the  pan again.<br>  But please if for nothing else.... Please open the windows.Get some fresh air in there.Before you get sick sweetheart.|`|AA10378559	You've got a problem. I don't know that you'll not end up just throwing it away. Hope it wasn't a favorite. I do know that after lots of use on open fires, fry pans I've used with the Boy Scouts could get really grimy.When it go so bad, and before it became caked on, we'd use sand or gritty dirt to scour the pan. This can loosen the residue from burning, as well as cooked on grease. Then a good rinse and thorough washing in soap followed by a scalding rinse. This will make most pans usable again, except cast iron, which won't burn but will warp if it is heated too hot or too long. Dirt can scour it down to the iron if not careful, making it mostly unusable. Good luck cleaning your unfortunately burned fry-pan.|`|1b1b5a87396aa8440db42d2b03e85f19aa	try vinegar for six hours.|`|eb1a8a1e05721b2492f883ed3aff649aaa	First of all, did you try spraying a lot of bathroom spray that you normally use for after you use the restroom????

279445ed1bbcba086e4c6eca1ae303ddaa	I am pretty sure that you are asking, "of all things that were once living, what is the percentage of species that are now extinct?" or "what is the ratio of extinct species to living species?"<br>  <br>  This is a very good question and there are many many answers out there.  You see, there are many species still being found, both fossils and living creatures in rainforests, oceans, deserts, you name it.  Since we haven't finished cataloging all of the living creatures or the extinct creatures, it is pretty tough to give a good answer to that question.   <br>  <br>  The World Conservation Union says, "Identifying the actual number of historic extinctions is difficult because only c. 1.9 million of the world's estimated 5 – 30 million species (see Erwin 1982; Hodkinson and Casson 1991; Novotny et al. 2002) have been described. Recent extinctions may be even more prevalent among undescribed species due to the sheer number and the fact that the discovery and description of species tends to be biased toward more broadly distributed and abundant taxa (see Collen et al. 2004)."<br>  <br>  Another problem that we have run into in recent times is finding living fossils that we once thought were extinct. Or animals that were presumed extinct in the wild.  So there is always a chance that something we thought was extinct will pop up again.  <br>  <br>  This is pretty rare though and would not have as much impact on the ratio as the fact that people believe there are between 5-100 milllion species.  That is a 95 million species difference.  <br>  <br>  So, although most people state that 99+% of all species are extinct, I have never found a number that they attribute to the total number of extinct species.  This is critical to know because it can change the percentage greatly.<br>  <br>  if they are using the 1.9 million classifed number as the living # of species, and just picking 200 million extinct species out of the air, then the percentage of living creatures would be less than 1%.  But if we use the extreme upper end guess of 100 million as the living # of species with the same 200 million extinct, this would give us a percentage of 33.3% of all species are currently living.  HUGE DIFFERENCE!<br>  <br>  example:<br>  "Since life began, about 99 percent of the earth's species have disappeared and, on at least five occasions, huge numbers have died out in a relatively short time. The most recent of these mass extinctions, about 65 million years ago, swept away the dinosaurs and many other forms of life. However, despite such catastrophes, the total number of living species has, until recently, followed a generally upward trend." - [The Extinction Website]<br>  <br>  "Of all species that have ever lived, 99.9 percent are extinct." - [natural history museum, University of Kansas]<br>  <br>  "In the recent past, the level of biological diversity was the highest the world has ever seen. However, the number of species is not known, even to the nearest order of magnitude. The number of described species is about 1.4 million; but the total is estimated at about 5 million." - [ Biodiversity and Conservation: A Hypertext Book by Peter J. Bryant]<br>  <br>  "Estimates of undiscovered species on Earth range from 10 million to 100 million." - [The US National Science Board (1989)] <br>  <br>  Notice how none of these sources lists the actual number of extinct species?  Interesting.|`|9df0c3d38cf4defd6f7409fc7ff54947aa	Living things are, by definition, "alive" and therefore cannot be extinct.
