Walking into the local saloon he asked a cocky schitkicker, 'What do you fellas do around here for entertainment?' 'Ya mean women?' asked the schitkicker. 'We ain't got none. 'Round here folks do sheep'. 'That's disgusting,' cried the correspondent, 'I've never heard of such moral degredation'.      , after a few months, the correspondent was beginning to ache and the sheep were looking more and more attractive. So he finally went out and found himself a comely sheep, brought her back to his room, shampooed her and then tied ribbons in her hair. After a bottle of champagne, he lured the sheep into his bedchamber and released his pent-up frustrations. Afterward, he escorted his four-legged lover to the saloon for a drink. As the correspondent and his wooly mate entered, a hush fell over the patrons and the anxious couple became the object of many stares. 'You goddamn bunch of hypocrites!' the reporter yelled. 'You've been doing sheep for years, but when I do it up right you look at me like I'm some sort of crazy pervert!' One cowboy in the back of the crowd spoke up, 'Yeah, but that's the sheriff's Wife!'

One of my dreams includes becoming a world renound doctor and finding ways to use different sources of energy and I'm, not even 17.   I need honest opinions and info on this, not just "its just in your head" or "your a freak of big intentions and a little mind"  is it just the way i am?   Has anyone else felt the way I do because i feel alone in this world with my ideas and dreams. I know there are many many people who have succeeded, but I'm talking about my generation.   thanks :)

20090221044136AAR9WXQ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is it just me or are the Spiderman movies TERRIBLE?	The spiderman movies are supposed to be the highest grossing films or something like that. I've just watched spiderman 2 and i have to say that those two films are two of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If they were supposed to be comedies they would have been be gold but they're NOT! The script is terrible-way too cliche to take seriously, the acting is either over the top or with no effort put into it at all. The bad guys look really pathetic and the thing that annoys me the most is that for the whole movie it seems to be more about the characters and it isn't until the very end of the movie that there's any conflict! Is this not supposed to be an action/superhero movie? what the hell? Why are these so successful. I'm not bagging spiderman, just these awful movies.

20090221052104AAaTiNW	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Rihanna WAS beaten by Chris Brown, why is everyone standing up for him?	So a woman gets severely beaten, there are bite marks, bruises, busted lip, there's a witness and Chris Brown flee's the scene! She's taken to the police station, makes a statement identifying Chris as her attacker, has photographs taken of her injuries, is taken to hospital to treat those injuries, and the response that my earlier question got was that Rihanna is basically a big liar! That Chris didn't do that to her! How exactly are women supposed to overcome domestic violence when people don't believe someone as famous as Rihanna? If it wasn't true, then why did everyone drop everything to do with Chris, his label dropped him, his advert campaign dropped him, he was arrested and faces up to seven years in prison! All because she lied about someone that, half an hour later, she was seen hugging and kissing and seemed deeply in love with! I doubt it! What did she do, bite herself in the leg? Don't be rediculous! I really hated this response and the attitude that those people seem to have towards it.

I've tried Google, since it annoys me when people use yahoo answers to find song lyrics/movie quotes they could easily find on their own.  But I've had no luck and this is driving me absolutely CRAZY.       It's a dialogue between two (male?) characters. One of them has megalomania issues of some sort, and says something along the lines of "The whole time we've been talking I've been imagining that I was watching this conversation from over there," and something to the effect of sitting on a throne.       I feel like it's probably a comedy, but I'm really not sure. The title and actors are just on the brink of my memory, but I can't make the connection. Good old tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.

When a lady answers, he asks, "How many children do you have?"      She replies "Three". When he asks "What are their ages ?" she decides not to answer. He apoligises and asks for a hint about the childrens ages. She says "If you multiply their three ages you get 36" (their ages are exact numbers).      He thinks for a while and asks for another hint. "The sum of their ages is the number on the house next door."      This still isn't enough information, so he asks for one last hint.      "All right, the eldest plays the piano!" He then knows their ages.         What are the three ages?

20090220222708AAJXjOP	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What factual inaccuracies in films drive you nuts?	Creative license is a fine idea. It allows us to see stories that, while they may not use absolute historical or scientific truths, thrill and interest us far more than the factual version would. But in some occasions, it's just too much to accept. This is especially true if you see a film that is factually inaccurate about something you really care about or know a great deal about. So which instances of "creative license" make you blow your top?

The witch trials were going on. So everyone thought everyone else was a witch. She would cast spells on other people, so other people would think they were witches. The whole town thought everyone was a witch. There was a scene where a lady owned a bakery. There were people in the store looking at the ginger bread men. To make them think that the lady was a witch, the witch cast a spell where the ginger bread men got erections. For some reason that is the part of the movie I remember.

20090220222959AAsMFBd	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Can I get an opinion on Taurus/Libra pairing?	Hey! So i met this kid through my voice coach (we both have been singing with her for years). Hes 23 but im only 19. He is a Taurus (April) and I am a Libra (October 6th) Im still in college and he graduated last year. So Ive been going to my voice coach for three years and Im not sure how long hes been going to her. I sort of just met him like three months ago... Were both her best students and both sing for this guy named Mike (professionally in shows) with his daughter and her friend.      Anyway,   My voice coach, him, his guy friend and I went to a karaoke bar. Our coach sang, watched us sing, and left... When she left, we went to a different karaoke bar and he got TRASHED!!!! Im talking tree hugging, drink-throwing, obsessing over my hair, "its only iced tea!" (long island) drinking, cursing, and hiding under a box kind of trashed. We left at 4 in the morning. His friend and I got him home safe... All at 4 in the morning. Anyway, while he was hammered, he was very concerned about me stating that they HAD to walk me to my car so i wouldnt "get raped" about a million times. He kept repeating it. When we got to his car (we used it to drive him home) there was a cardboard box in the back seat and he wouldnt let me sit there because i would be "uncomfortable" and kind of made me sit in the front. He wanted to know if i had a good time or not so he asked me like 10 times. He was also very immature when he was drunk yelling at his friend for not staying over his apartment because his friend had community service in the morning. He was legit acting like a 3-year-old girl. Now he claims he doesnt remember anything that happened. The day after, we had a voice lesson together but he didnt remember so he texted me. I called him because he kind of asked me what had happened and it was waaay too long of a story to explain it in a text message. He seemed extremely embarassed and apologised several times and thanked me for getting him home and such.    He is extremely nice and thinks that im "really sweet"   opinions/ideas?   Please and thanks!

Tell me how you broke your leg this morning."      "Like I was saying...25 years ago, when I first started working on the farm, that night, right after I'd gone to bed, the farmer's beautiful daughter came into my room. She asked me if there was anything I wanted. I said, "No, everything is fine."      "Are you sure?" she asked.      "I'm sure," I said.      "Isn't there anything I can do for you?" she wanted to know.      "I reckon not," I replied.      "Excuse me," said the doctor, "What does this story have to do with your leg?"      "Well, this morning," the farmhand explained, "when it dawned on me what she meant, I fell off the roof!"

20090203055414AAONIug	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Would this be a cute joke to tell to my aunt?	A little boy got on the bus, sat next to a man reading a book, and noticed he had his collar on backwards. The little boy asked why he wore his collar backwards...      The man, who was a priest, said "I am a Father."     The little boy replied "My Dad doesn't wear his collar like that."     The priest looked up from his book and answered "I am the Father of  many."    The boy said "My Dad has 4 boys, 4 girls and two grandchildren and he doesn't wear his collar that way."     The priest, getting impatient, said "I am the Father of hundreds" and went back to reading his book.    The little boy sat quietly thinking for a while, then leaned over and said, "Maybe you should use a condom and wear your pants backwards instead of your collar.

20090221054641AAsEf73	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Sex on a Period: How can they?	I've read about so many men and women asking if they can get pregnant cause they had sex while the women was on her period.       My question is, how can they do that? Personally, I find it disgusting. Whether you do it in a bed or in the shower, there is blood everywhere. Plus, being on my period, I have no desire to have sex. All I want is for it to be over. So, if you have sex while on your period, do you tell the partner first, or does it just happen? Does it matter how bad the flow is if you do it or not?      Sorry, I'm just curious. I don't understand how anyone could have sex while having their period, and how men don't care.

20090221031059AAYxdey	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Can You Suggest Some Rock Contraltos? The More The Merrier?	So, I have this friend, and he keeps talking about going to karaoke night. I am not stage shy, but I do have a problem in that I have a pretty deep voice for a woman. I usually speak from my head instead of from my chest because I intimidate people anyway, and a deep voice doesn't help much when I am trying to put people at ease.      I don't feel I sing well (like I think I am tone deaf), but most people agree I sing very well if I don't concentrate too much on what I am doing. If I sing karaoke, I will practice my song first so that I don't have to be nervous about singing and screwing up.      Which leads me to my question. I need as long a list of rock contraltos as possible so I can widen my choices. I need to be able to pick songs where they don't stray into the soprano range--they need to be solid contraltos. I'm serious--there are some tenors out there who can hit higher notes than I can.      So, whatcha got for me?      Thanks.

The was a house (maybe old, dark spooky), and there was something haunting about this house.      There was someone (a boy/guy I think) living behind a wall. A girl (finds?) a love heart (I think) in the house, or perhaps it's hers, and she uses it to open a secret door where this guy is.      I think at first this guy is scary but in the end they fall in love (not sure).      Any ideas?

I just discovered this new band called 'In Mourning' and normally I don't like doom metal, but yeah, I dig this, it's got death metal vocals and clean sung parts and melodic interludes, quite progressive, it's kind of like a stripped down bare knuckles version of Opeth, but more doomy.

20090221040206AASBWEz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Now now isn't it wong joke?	Joe took his blind date to the carnival. "What would you like to do first, Kim?" asked Joe. "I want to get weighed," she said. They ambled over to the weight guesser. He guessed 120 pounds. She got on the scale; it read 117 and she won a prize.       Next the couple went on the ferris wheel. When the ride was over, Joe again asked Kim what she would like to do. "I want to get weighed," she said. Back to the weight guesser they went. Since they had been there before, he guessed her correct weight, and Joe lost his dollar.       The couple walked around the carnival and again he asked where to next. "I want to get weighed," she responded. By this time, Joe figured she was really weird and took her home early, dropping her off with a handshake.       Her roommate, Laura, asked her about the blind date, "How'd it go?"      Kim responded, "Oh, Waura, it was wousy."
20090221033646AAEldL2	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Name this Australian movie...?	I believe it was it was made in the late 80's to early 90's. It might even be late 90's. I don't really recall honestly.      The movie starred a gentleman who I think was pretty famous, I remember him in one or two movie. Black hair and not to tall. I didn't recognize anyone else in the movie.      Any who, the movie has the gentleman in a van in the middle of the outback. He runs into a girl who seduces him and knocks him out completely. Befor she does she utters a line that I have remembered ever since I heard it lol "Part my Beef/Meat curtains". I'm sure you can guess as to the context that it was used in. He then wakes up in the middle of a scary, trashy, inbred Aussie community. I think the female lead does this a couple of times to other unsuspecting gents. There might have been some cannibalism in the movie. Lots of red, traditional Aussie dessert, some mountains.      It was sort of a campy horror movie, or it was atleast to me when I saw it. I'm sure some of it was meant to be humorous.

20090221041853AAZkR8t	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	When recording music, is it best to record the whole song or riff by riff?	Hi, I play guitar/sing in a band, and we have been trying to record some of our songs for a while on my computer to make some kind of demo that sounds remotely professional. I got all the basic equipment to record with and the software to produce the music on (Magix) and it all works great. But I've been trying to record the guitar stuff riff by riff and then cutting them up and looping them together which works really well, but unfortunately I keep struggling when the riffs change and it isn't very smooth, it ends up sounding quite artificial. Is it better to record the whole song, and then edit it afterwards, or to carry on doing it riff by riff? Thanks

Like do you have a contract with your salary on it or do you get a percentage?  For instance you sell 2,000,000 copies of your album, which the price of selling that many would be $20,000,000 (if album is $10) and $40,000,000 (if its $20).

Deviant art is filled with manga/anime fan art, most people only draw that. I don't understand what's so special. I mean, there are tons of amazing comics that are wayy better than mangas, but nobody obsesses over them. Mangas have a pretty unusual drawing style, and it is kinda cool (I also really like Japan in general) but there are soo many of them, it's not even unique anymore!! (This wasn't meant to be an offensive question, everyone has an individual taste and I respect it.)

20090221043952AA1BrsS	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Rihanna and Chris Brown?	Hi! Has anyone else seen the supposed photograph of Rihanna after the Chris Brown incident? On TMZ. It's horrible! If someone from the police leaked this then they should be deeply ashamed of themselves! As if it's not bad enough that she has to go through this awful attack by someone she's supposed to be able to trust, then the police, the people who are supposed to protect her, leak the police photograph of her injuries! It's awful. Some people are saying it's good that they've done that because she's so famous that it raises awareness of domestic abuse, but it should have been left up to her to decide that. And do you think that it would be a good thing for her to release it? She gives off the impression that she's a very strong and independant woman, so it would take a lot for her to do it. And for her younger fans, should they see her like this?

20090221051502AAMHVt5	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does Slumdog really deserve 10 oscar nominations?	I don't it deserves 10 nominations. It defines the word "overrated". I have seen better movies than this. The film has lots of flaws. One of them would be the accent of Jamal? Really can a boy from slums speak in British accent?And even the gangsters speak in English. I am saying this because I am an Indian and I have never seen any don or a gangster speak in English. So, then why is it called "realistic portrayal" of India. And the West really enjoy seeing poverty in India, don't they? The excuses made for showing India poorly are really ridiculous i.e. "It's just a film..enjoy it." are absolutely disgusting. How can you enjoy a film with flaws. Westerners might not agree with me. It can be understandable. But even Indians are rooting for it. It's a pity. What if an Indian director went to America and and made a film on an African-American Jamal Martin who lost his home in Hurricane Katrina, who once had a promising basketball career, but who -- following a drive-by shooting -- now walks with a permanent limp, whose father is in jail for selling drugs, whose mother is addicted to crack cocaine, whose younger sister was killed by gang-violence, whose brother was arrested by corrupt cops, whose first born child has sickle cell anaemia, and so on. The movie would be widely panned and laughed out of theatres.   So what's your opinion on this?

I have been playing for two years and I have been using my first guitar since, but now it has a crack between fret 15 and fret 21. I hear it all the time and it pisses me off because it is my favorite guitar.        So which one should I get?

She explained, 'The egg timer's broken'

20090203094154AAA6mHr	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I think I'm in love(need astrology experts)?	So I met this girl one night at a party, and we eventually started talking a lot more over the phone and texts, and she eventually invited me over to her place to stay for the weekend, we had an amazing weekend and I felt so good laying down next to her, a feeling that I have never experienced before, a feeling of pure bliss and ecstasy caused by no drug. After some more time with her, I notice that I can't stop thinking about her what so ever, and the more time I spend away from her, the more I want to be with her every second. I mean, I have always liked girls and spending time with them, but there is something very different and special about this one that drives me crazy... So after thinking about all this, I finally thought about astrology, and did a natal chart for both of us. Here is what came up.      Me:   Rising Sign is Gemini.    Sun is Taurus.    Moon is Leo.    Mercury is Taurus.    Venus is Pisces.    Mars is Pisces.    Jupiter is Cancer.    Saturn is Capricorn.    Uranus is Capricorn.    Neptune is Capricorn.    Pluto is Scorpio.      Her:   Rising Sign is Aries.    Sun is Leo.    Moon is Scorpio.    Mercury is Cancer.    Venus is Leo.    Mars is Leo.    Jupiter is Aries.    Saturn is Sagittarius.    Uranus is Sagittarius.    Neptune is Capricorn.    Pluto is Scorpio.

The interviewer says: "Recruitment is done on a points system; have you been in the armed services?"      "Yes," he says " I was in the army for three years and served in Iraq "      The interviewer says "Great; that will give you extra points toward employment"       And then asks "were you trained as an electrician?"      The guy says " Yes I have all my papers."      "Brilliant, more points in your favour. Finally he asks:      "Are you disabled in any way?"       The guy replies: "Unfortunately: 100%... a mortar round exploded near me and blew my testicles off."      The interviewer tells the guy "No problem; further points towards employment. OK. I can hire you right now. The hours are from 8:00 am  to 4:00 pm.    You can start tomorrow. Come in at 10:00 AM."      The recruit is puzzled and says " If the hours are from 8:00am To  4:00pm, then why do you want me to come in at 10:00 AM? "      "This is a Local Council job " the interviewer replies. "So for the first two hours we sit around scratching our balls, so not really worth you coming in for that."

20090203095308AAisY4P	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Read this if you need a laugh...?	A married Irishman went into the confessional and said to his    priest, "I almost had an affair with another woman."   The priest said, "What do you mean, almost?"   The Irishman said, "Well, we got undressed and rubbed together, but    then stopped."   The priest said, "Rubbing together is the same as putting it in. You're   not to see that woman again. For your penance, say five Hail Mary's and put €50 in the poor box."      The Irishman left the confessional, said his prayers, and then    walked over to the poor box. He paused for a moment and then started to leave.       The priest, who was watching, quickly ran over to him saying, "I saw that. You didn't put any money in the poor box!"      The Irishman replied, "Yeah, but I rubbed the €50 on the box, and   according to you, that's the same as putting it in!"

20090203095510AAtnQrs	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Does Ugly Betty inspire anyone else to just be kind and compassionate, for beauty to be seen from within?	I don't know what it is, but it just seems like everytime I watch an epsiode, I admire betty so much because she is just so sweet, generous, and always positive to everyone, and yes at times she can get mad or angry at people yet she does it in the nicest way which isnt ugly or disrespectful in anyway. And I know at lot of it has to do with the fact that America Ferrera plays the character cus she is just as genuine a person. Yet  Betty Suarez inspires me to be kind to anyone and treat everyone the same despite who they are, what they believe, or what they look like, she makes me want to be a better person and just enjoy life and have fun, no grudges or regrets. I hope one day I meet "my" Ugly Betty because her character is 1000x more attractive to me than any looks can give a girl!!      I hope some girls/women are inspired by this show, looks dont always make your life better and there are some guys out there who value inner beauty above outer. God Bless!!!
