20090130203351AA9IiP5	Beauty & Style;Hair	I need help with my hair!!!?	My hair is naturally poofy.  Once i get out of the shower, if i brush it out it just becomes this massive poof ball like a clown!!  So i either have to straighten it or scrunch it.  Straigtening it gives me split ends, but scrunching it gets kinda old . . . and i dont really like wearing pony tails.   Does anyone have any ideas of any good hair cuts i could get, or what i could do with my hair to make it less of a hassle?

20090130150606AAj6nEx	Beauty & Style;Hair	How long does bleached hair take to get unbleached...or what?	I was using acnefree product to get rid of my acne and I gotta say that it worked pretty well. But I read some reviews of that is has bleach in it and stuff. I recently started to notice that parts of my hairline on my sideburns was bleached and it looks like theres a little bald spot there.      I looked closer and the hair had just turned like blondish white, so Im guessing it was bleached by the acnefree product.       How long will it take for my original hair color to come back or do I just wait for it to grow back? I get my hair buzzed every 1-2 weeks so its like 2/8 of an inch of it is bleached on the side but still when hair is that short from far away it looks like there is a bald spot.      I fixed the way it looks but trimming up the side burn a little so its thinner but How long will it take for my hair to reobtain its original color. and does bleach effect what grows from the pores or will it just start to grow again with the normal color

20090130154358AAdqbvg	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is there anything I can do about this? (Belts)?	Hello!   Basically, the only belt buckles I like have a 'hooking' lock (as these are the more bolder types), as opposed to a traditional 'pin' lock (I hope that makes sense!)      However, with a hooking lock, I find that it pulls on the leather hole it inserts into, and actually stretches the hole.  After a while the hole becomes unusable.   I do wear belts tightly... Which is the problem.  But I don't like wearing them loose.     I don't have the same problem with pin belts (just because the way they are), and Im currently wearing these; but I have a nice looking hook belt waiting to be worn!      Firstly, does anyone have a clue what Im even on about =D   If you do, then is there a way around it? (I'll always wear my belts relatively tight, and the strap must be leather!)       Thanks!

I'm a freshman in high school and there are these two boys, one is a junior and one is a senior. Both of them are real jerks and make fun of me, embarrass me, and do all these really upsetting things. Usually I just shrug it off but today it really got to me...     I've tried telling them to stop, and ignoring them but it doesn't work. I have this tendency to smile or laugh whenever I'm in an awkward or uncomfortable situation and no matter how hard I try I end up smiling, even though I am really upset, so they don't even take me seriously.     I'm not going to a teacher or anything, that would just be baby-ish and unnecessary, but do you think there is anything I can do to stop them? They've been doing this since October and it is starting to take a toll. I can wait till one of them graduates but the other one will still be at school.

When we are young, we are taught, to act a certain way, to dress a certain way, to eat, to live, to spend our time, to befriend people a certain way. Its what they call 'The proper way'   But how do we find our true selves if we are so busy, wearing the shoes of someone whose feet aren't the same size.   They tell us to be ourselves,   But then give us these rules,   Its like locking a bird in a cage, and telling it to fly.   How can we be ourselves when we are living up to others aspects?   What would ... happen, if we were to act the way we wanted to act?   Would we get laughed at?, would their be chaos? Would we get in trouble? Would we be teased?   ;The bravest person, is the one who isn't afraid to break the rules, and go the distance to get to where they want to go      (one of my friends asked that question,so dont give me credit for it)

20090130195716AAovrKh	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Ideas please on a tatoo for quitting smoking?	I keep thinking about getting a tat on my left thumb.  I'd like an ankh to be incorporated somehow.  The reason for it being on my left thumb is so I can see it when I drink too much and want a smoke.  I need something to remind me about how the nicodemon/nicopr*ck will always be there with me taunting me, but I'm stronger than that and I need a reminder of that.  Any ideas?  Any pictures you could share?   Maybe the hand/thumb is a bad idea.  Do you have any better ones?   Thanks!   fyi:  I finally have beat him after 24 years of smoking!

OK, I KNOW this is the wrong section but I didn't get any answers in the Family&Relationships section and I almost always get answers here :/ Please, what should I do??      OK, so my best guy friend of a year and half hasn't spoken to me in about two months now. Granted, it's sort of my fault but also his. We went to homecoming together and some drama started there and we weren't as close anymore. He began acting nice and then mean, and then nice and mean. I asked to talk to him to try to work out our friendship at school and he said "OK...we'll talk tomorrow" and then he blatantly ignored me and acted mean for a while until he realized I wasn't going to press the issue, and then started acting nice again, mean then nice on and off. I finally decided I couldn't take it anymore and I decided I wasn't going to make an effort to talk to him anymore - I wasn't going to ignore him if he talked to me, but I wasn't going to try to be around him anymore. Well, basically I guess he thought I was ignoring him and now we both ignore each other even though we see each other everyday. I'm starting to regret it and I wish I could talk to him again but then I think about how mean he has been to me in the past and have to rethink it. He's a senior and graduating this year - should I just wait out the rest of the year and forget about him or should I try to rebuild our friendship again? and how - if he's been ignoring me for so long how can I get him to talk without making him mad, like ideas on how to start? Thanks so much to honest answers!

I have seen people wear ballet flats from this brand very often, but the brand doesn't only make flats. I makes boots, etc, but flats are the most common. On the ballet flats (where the toes are supposed to be) is a large gold circle. Carved out of the gold circle are two Ts facing opposite of each other, with the --- of the Ts touching. I remember seeing these flats at Bloomingdale's a few times, but forgot the name. The name should start with a T and two words long. Thanks in advance!

20090130200852AAH0g5U	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is it worth paying $300-$400 for a pair of gucci glasses?	The glasses really suit my face shape and they look really nice (at least to me). I won't be wearing the glasses 24/7, I'll only be wearing it during class and if I drive. The thing is, I want to get them because if I'm going to buy glasses I might as well buy a nice pair, but at the same time, glasses are glasses and whichever one I choose will meet the requirements for eyesight.       I don't know, should I? I'm confused. I know $300-$400 is probably not that much for Gucci glasses, but still. This is how they look:    http://eyeglasses.go-optic.com/DFRAMES/I...
