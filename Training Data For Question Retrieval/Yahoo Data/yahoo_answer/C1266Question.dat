I was supposed to use A=1/2ap where apothem = 4 root 3, and the perimeter is 72. The correct answer was 144 root 3.       I don't understand why the apothem is not half the height of the regular triangle. Why did A=1/2bh not work?       Thanks for a simple explanation.

I'm writing a story about the end of the world for my literature class. My plot is people drilling to the center of the earth and the magma coming through and destroying everything. Because the heat is so intense, what exactly would it do to our atmosphere if it reached us? Would it burn through the ozone layers? how would it affect life? It was kinda hard to formulate a question to type into google...but if any of y'all are fanatics about this kinda stuff give me your thought!

Look back when christians were claiming that the earth was flat under the rule of the christian church in europe, the church killed almost anyone who claimed otherwise, but when science later established that the earth was in fact round, everyone including modern christians had to surrender to this fact no matter what the bible said.

A mathematical model for the annual person consumption of eggs in the U.S. is given by f(x)=0.181x^2-4.88x+271. The model is based on data collected since 1980, thus x=0 in 1980.

I don't actually want anyone to do this question for me and I don't want an answer, but merely a push in the right direction:      a) Given that f(x) = x^3- 3x^2 +4x+1, find f'(x).      For this I differentiated and got: 3x^2- 6x +4      b)The point P is on the curve y= f(x) and its x co-ordinate is 2.    Calculate the y co-ordinate of P.      I think this involves substitution of the x value into either f(x) or f'(x), but am entirely sure which one. I would have thought that I'd need to substitute x= 2 into the equation that I differentiated- f'(x), because they wouldn't have told me to find it otherwise, but then again, it says 'point P is on the curve y= f(x)' and it wants the y co-ordinate of P.      Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question! I just want a little help, but NOT the answer. =]

20090304122713AAuR34l	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What is the most fundamental quantity in a data transmission signal?	So say you send a 2kb file down a cat5 cable from A to B or so.      The signal is an electromagnetic signal in a sinusoidal waveform i think, which at the top of the wave represents a voltage of 1 and at the bottom a voltage of 0.      So in terms of physics what actually is a electromagnetic sinusodial wave, is it a stream of electrons, or a stream of photons, of neither, is  a pure electric (strong / weak) force stream.      And why does it need to be sinusodial, why not a square waveform i thought a square wave would represent 1 and 0 better than a varying waveform like a sine wave is?

20090304120101AAxbJYt	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Drawing a "worst line of best fit"?	I have a phyics practical, and apparently there is a bit where we will need to know how to find the percentage uncertianty in our lines of best fit on our graphs, by drawing a 'worst line of best fit' wich is apparently the worst possible line of best fit that still qualifies as a line of best fit.   But how do you draw a 'worst line of best fit'? surley there is one line of best fit that is right, and otherwise it's not a line of best fit. I mean, how bad is it supposed to be, whats to stop you drawing anyold random line?      Who would come up with a 'worst line of best fit' anyway? It just sounds weird!   And i think i offended my physics teacher after doing this in class by telling him that it sounded stupid and I thought all physicists were crazy. :(

If 35.3 g of CaCO3 reacts with 100 mL of 6.00 M HCl, how many liters of CO2 gas will be produced at 745 mmHg and 23.0oC?   Hints:     ? Begin by writing the balanced equation for the reaction.   ? This is a limiting reagent problem (why?), so you will next need to determine whether calcium carbonate or hydrochloric acid is the limiting reagent.   ? Once you have determined the identity of the limiting reagent, you can calculate the moles of carbon dioxide produced.   ? The last step is to find the volume of carbon dioxide using the ideal gas law,       What volume of carbon dioxide gas would be obtained at STP?

20090304133157AAEDtb0	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	The fourth dimension?	The area of timespace that has nothing and consists of no matter is called 0 dimension.if we place any given point in this empty space, that point represents a location in the first dimension. If we were to create a plane of existence from one 1st dimensional point to another along x and y axis, we enter the 2nd dimension.if we create a third point using x, y, z axis, we would have a 3rd dimensional object. We live in the third dimension, and according to einstiens theory of general relativity we are living among the x, y, z axis, simultaneously moving along a 4th axis, T, or time. This is true because any physics equation can be used to determine T through a formula. So while we are conscious we can see in the 3rd dimension and move through the 4th. But what about when we are unconscious? If I am sleeping I can have vivid dreams, where the rules of physics may not apply, and when I awaken it feels as if I were only gone for a moment.even though I'm sleeping and have not moved in the 3rd dimension, my subconscious has altered the 4th dimension and is able to jump across it in a second. Perhaps when we are dreaming our subconscious can see our 4th dimensional selves moving through time. This would also help to explain the phenomenon of deja,vu.I believe that the final frontier is not space, or the oceans, but our minds. The key to controlling and seeing the 4th dimension lies within our subconscious, though I do not have the mathematical expertise to unlock it
