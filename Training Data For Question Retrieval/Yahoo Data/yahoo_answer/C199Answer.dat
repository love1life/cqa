kRaVa0Wraa	It sounds like you have an anxiety problem.<br>  your mom definitely needs to help you.<br>  shes being extremely rude.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Your parents aren't neglecting you, they are working hard to give you a good life and home. Your mom probably reacted the way she did because she was busy with work or tired or stressed and when you talked to her you may have come off whiney which didn't help her mood and when she said something you may have become defensive. I don't know. You were probably dealing with anxiety. Did you feel sick only when you thought about your project or every minute of every day leading up to the presentation? Have you ever felt like this before before a project was due? Maybe it was just a physical reaction to stress, you knew you had more work to do than normal and your body was telling you that you might want to slow down. If you feel you need help but aren't getting it from your parents try talking to a counselor at school. I'm sure your mom didn't mean to snap at you and if you said something to her I'm sure she would apologize.|`|XrKviWgSaa	i hate doing that sort of stuff but you needed to talk to someone about it so you called your mom, in my opinion she should have talked with you about it to help calm you down.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Sweetheart, it sounds like you caught your mom at a bad time, maybe? I am sure she didn't mean to be rude and abrupt with you. It does seem like you have a little anxiety on top of some feelings of neglect, both of which are perfectly acceptable for a kid. You need some attention, all kids do; just be sure that you don't start to act out for attention, OK? Tell your mom honestly how her manner on the phone made you feel. She knows that you need her, and parents are human beings too and not perfect. We have bad days too and sometimes unfortunately that gets taken out on you kids. I would bet she feels bad about it. Talk to her again and I bet she will help you out.

VMASMHX6aa	I had a scan to check the shape of my uterus recently. It's just like a normal scan - jelly on the belly and they have a look round and check the shape and whether it's normal. They also check for any fibroids at the same time. If they do an internal scan, they can take a better look at your ovaries.<br>  <br>  The chances are that nothing will be discovered.

E2UXN7J1aa	You are feeling your own heartbeat.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's your heartbeat you are feeling. If you are pregnant you are only about 5 or 6 weeks and your uterus is still tucked below your pevlic bone so it would not be a baby. Take a pregnancy test to find out if you are pregnant.|`|BMGEi0yCaa	If you've missed your period by 1-2 weeks, you should be able to take a home pregnancy test and it should be pretty accurate.<br>  <br>  As for feeling a heartbeat in your stomach, that's your own heartbeat. If you press your fingers against almost any part of your body, you'll be able to feel your heartbeat through your fingertips and hand.<br>  <br>  If you really feel that something is off, however, go see a doctor. Better safe than sorry.|`|52U22fiAaa	If you are pregnant, it's your uterus, not your stomach.  If your stomach is moving, maybe you just ate a huge hamburger for lunch or something. <br>  <br>  If you are only 2 weeks pregnant, you wouldn't see movement yet, your baby wouldn't even be visible yet.  <br>  <br>  It's probably all in your head.
BMGEi0yCaa	Any time you have unprotected sex, there's always a chance of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  You didn't really list any other symptoms besides a missed period, so the best thing I can tell you to do is either go by a home pregnancy test or have your doctor run a blood test. A home pregnancy test should be accurate enough by now, since you've missed your period.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Pregnancy chances would be pretty low because if you're average, the sex was no where near your ovulation date.

7UEv9Sdwaa	Is he burping well for you? My oldest gave me such a time when he was a baby, because he had too much gas. If that is not an issue, maybe you could try a sound conditioner.

At 3am the night air is crisp and clean and will help soothe an over tired baby.<br>  <br>  - give him a massage by rubbing (lightly) on baby's stomach and back. Rotate his legs in the air like he's riding a bike, this will help if he as wind trapped or a big poop on the way.<br>  <br>  - give some nakey time. There's something special about letting a baby go bare. The sense of air on skin is natural, fresh and relaxing for many children.<br>  <br>  - rub your finger along his gums. if you reach any swollen bits, rub rub rub on the spot with your finger. it will releave the pain.<br>  <br>  - put his cot next to your bed (or a couch or a chair) lay him on his side and pat his bottom while you read out loud your favourite book. Your voice will help settle him to sleep.<br>  <br>  - stand and rock him in your arms. rocking is very soothing for babies.<br>  <br>  - if all else fails and you'd like to try a new "go to bed" method: this one is what works for my son:<br>  turn on a dim lamp<br>  turn on a classical music cd (on repeat) for all night long - that way when he wakes up he hears the same music and drifts off back to sleep.<br>  lay him in his cot on his side<br>  pat his bottom until he stops crying<br>  walk out of the room<br>  when he cries, go in, roll on side and pat the bottom again.<br>  do this on repeat all night long until he's asleep (takes my son 5mins)<br>  <br>  best of luck :)|`|CtENASfvaa	i know it is not suggested but my 8 day old son loved to sleep on my chest even if you just lay down and not sleep (if your not comfortable with him sleeping with you) at least you are getting some rest that was the only way i was able to get sleep in the hospital or after you feed him make sure you put him all the way to sleep before you lay him down|`|MFWEkkd9aa	make sure he has winded properly. cuddle him, rock him, give him a dummy, change his nappy.<br>  Sadly crying is what some newborns choose to excel at.<br>  I'm afraid there is no quick fix for this.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the joys of parenting my friend :)<br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|AA10880314	I saw a commercial once where it said to stand next to running water.

I know about know you must be wondering what ever possessed you to do this to yourself, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and no, its not an oncoming train.<br>  <br>  First of all, consider things from your son's perspective. For 9 months your little one has been a skins thickness from human presence. He grew up to the sounds of a beating heart, swallowing, talking, digesting, etc. He was constantly surrounded by warmth, and was, at then end, in constant contact with mom. <br>  <br>  Like all of us, he is yearning for the familiar, the comfortable. He wants more than just food. He wants what he grew up with.<br>  <br>  I know that many speak against sleeping with your child, for reasons we are all familiar with. However, as in any situation, there are too many variables to say that something is "good" or "bad" all on its own. Have you tried lying down with him? Tucking him against your chest so he can hear your heart, your breathing? You can always move him a couple of feet away when you begin to feel sleepy. Or, use the sleeper props to keep him on his back and in a safe position on your bed.<br>  <br>  You can also try holding him with his back against your chest, the top of his head pressed against the bottom of your throat. A low hum or mummer does wonders in combination with your touch.<br>  <br>  Also, have you tried swaddling him? Wrap him up in a receiving blanket or two so that he is reminded of the womb.<br>  <br>  Another option if you have one...use the swing. Many come with vibrate on them which really seems to put my little one at ease.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the sucking really helps relax them. They the pacifier and see if it helps, especially in combination with any of my other suggestions!<br>  <br>  Don't leave him alone right now. Training will come in time, but what he needs right now is you! I know you are tired (been there and done that and still doing it with my 5 month old...see, I'm up too! lol) but you can make it!<br>  <br>  Take care and may the peace of slumber eventually be with you! :)

BMGEi0yCaa	Urine tests are not as effective as blood tests - I don't know why they would tell you that they are. False positives on any type of pregnancy tests (even the home ones) are extremely rare. So unless there was something defective with the test in the first place, you more than likely are pregnant. A faint line is still a line and it means that the test picked up on some hCG (hormone produced only during pregnancy).<br>  <br>  A friend of mine was only 3-4 weeks when she took her first pregnancy test and it came up negative. 3 weeks later she took another one and it came back positive. She went to the doctor and was given an ultrasound and sure enough she was pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would call your doctor back and demand a blood test. If they refuse to give it to you, I would consider finding another doctor because they don't really seem to know what they're talking about.|`|YKYh9Z72aa	i think this prolly means that you aren't pg but if you start to have any more symptoms or you don't get your period soon i would take another test just to be sure.
ad2a02ef041d76b2e2f13c6a3604cd89aa	Don't get frustrated..it's really training the PARENT not the child. Your best bet is to put your son on the potty about 10 minutes after every meal..try to watch when he does dirty his diaper...how long after a meal and get him on before that time period.  Same for urinating...he drinks ...take him in on the potty afterwards..sometimes really cold drinks make them pee immediately...My technique worked on my two daughters..no lie...both were potty trained at 9 months....going yeah and clapping goes a long way the younger they are and the earlier you start.<br>  <br>  Good luck....just don't get frustrated, persevere and never show any anger, just disappointment when he makes a mistake..he is now old enough to know what's going on....|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Try a sticker chart...That worked for my daugther.

I made plans not to go anywhere on one day, then I took all his diapers away. I explained to him that he was a big boy and didn't need diapers anymore. You know when your little one needs to poo, when their faces turn red and they start to walk funny, take him to the toilet. Do this even if he doesn't go, if he has been there about 2 minutes sitting on the potty and nothing, get him off and when the poo dance and red face start again, take him again. I did it this way, it worked really well without having to apply a rewards system or anything, but it requires a lot of persistence and patience. I would have to put my son on his potty on and off, a dozen times like only minutes apart. The idea is to get him as comfortable and familiar with his potty as possible so he will feel relaxed enough to go. I was rather successful with it. Hope this helps.

One is fifteen years old and one is sixteen years old.<br>  <br>  Both are of them are upset that their real parents gave them up and both of them had closed adoptions. They will never know about their families and what their families have (diabetes, heat problems, etc). So when some thing bad happens to them, they will never know where they got it from and who had it from their real family. In their hearts, the pain will never heal. There will always be a big spot open. They love both of their adoptive parents but it will never be the same to them. When they see real parents with their children playing and have a good time, it hurts them. I don't blame them too. Having to be ripped apart from your real parents suck.

A part of me has always wondered (even though I am smart enough to know it's not true) what was wrong with me that my mom didn't want me? What was unloveable enough about me to make her give me away? Why didn't she fight for me? If she didn't love me, why should anyone else want to?<br>  <br>  That last one is why it's hard for me and other adopted people to sometimes accept love.

He knows that his life would probably be upside down if his birth mom kept him.  <br>  <br>  I think one of the things that helps him understand how much his birth mom cared about him, but she just couldn't raise him, is that his birth mom changed her mind at birth, when she saw the baby she decided she was not going to give him up and the adoptive mother was her birth coach.

I emotionally shut down as that was the only way I could deal with it nor did my family want me to talk about him anyway so it was as if he never existed.<br>  <br>  I suffered with depression anyway but his adoption made this worse and I became a self harmer and have tried committing suicide several times.<br>  <br>  My husband knew about my son but I couldn't even talk to him about the adoption.  When I found my son it was as if the door was unlocked and that I was finally allowed to talk about my son/show my feelings.  It is still an emotional and physical pain having had to live with my son being adopted despite being reunited in 2004.  Nothing can bring back the lost years.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I'm a first/birth parent.<br>  Let's see.... Emotionally,  shut down, hard to trust, afraid people will leave me.<br>  physically I have issues without causes. Depression being one.<br>  mentally .....hmmmm you'd have to ask my family.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I am an adoptee who has a great life.  I am one of the few and fortunate that views my adoption as a blessing, and I do not feel one ounce of sadness or longing over it.
NoUkTQCgaa	It makes me uneasy because it is true. This is one of the top reasons many people here, ap's, f parents AND adoptees wish to change the system. <br>    <br>  The profit is made by the agencies and lawyers, and even our own government, on local levels. The product is the baby, the manufacturers are the f parents, the consumers are the a parents, and the big business owner is the agency/lawyer. <br>   <br>  The ap's and the fp's have the emotional attachment to the child, but the only attachment the agency has is to the money paid for the "goods"...the baby. <br>   <br>  I could not agree with you more- NO ONE should profit from adoption. When the profit is stopped, I believe there will be NO more unethical adoption involving coercion, lies and manipulation. <br>   <br>  I mean for God's sake- the sheer fact a pap can give money towards rent/bills, etc to a prospective relinquishing mother and then lose that money if she decides to parent is insane. It is coercive to the f mom to begin with, but the pap's suffer, also. <br>   <br>  The celebrity thing chaps my ***$ too. Most of the celebs who adopt probably would not pass a home study to adopt a dog. Another example of how money talks. <br>   <br>  Once we get rid of the profit to agencies & lawyers, and in the instances of foreign adoptions, corrupt governments, adoption might just truly be in "the best interest of the child." Right now, with the exception of foster care and foster to adopt programs, it's the agencies, lawyers and corrupt foreign government who wins.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	In the USA, it is a huge industry. There are thousands and thousands of private adoption agencies.<br>  <br>  There are thousands of adoption attorneys.<br>  <br>  These people make a huge living from adoption.<br>  <br>  They even advertise, some on television, some in newpapers, the internet, even on billboards.<br>  <br>  They troll the world, looking for babies.<br>  <br>  There is also a public adoption industry, but that is another topic.|`|nESfk0bXaa	I've always been 'uneasy' with adoption.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Yes, I dislike the word "industry" when applied to adoption.  It's usually wielded to cause an emotional reaction and highlight all that is greedy and ignore everything else.<br>  <br>  Without concrete evidence, I will not subscribe to the opinion that every agency is corrupt and out to make the almighty buck.  (I will decline to comment on attorneys because they ARE in business for the money.)   Applying villainous traits to all members of a group is a form of bigotry. <br>  <br>  I prefer to form an opinion based on individual circumstances and not on emotional sensationalism.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	It is an industry.  As an infant, my permanent custodian was a corporation.  A corporation may have legal personhood, but it sure as heck doesn't have any emotions or emotional attachments.  After several months, employees within that corporation placed me with a family who paid a fee amounting to about twice the value of a new car.  I'm willing to bet they made a profit from that transaction.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Adoption is different in the UK as the local authorities and adoption agencies deal with it so costs are generally court costs and with adoption agencies maybe admin fees.  However at worst it generally is generally a matter of a few hundred pounds compared to the many thousands that it costs in other countries.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	The problem is it is an industry.  Is it an industry to me as an adoptive parent, or to a First mother?  Likely not in our minds, but the fact is people are profiting big time from adoption, making it an industry and making babies the product.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	uh, it is an industry, all they care about is doing their job, the money, they dont care about how anyone feels, thats what industries do, they are selfish and think of only themselves.|`|AA11987492	Yes, it makes me uneasy, but it is true. I can not think of a better way to describe it; an industry is what it is. So what do we do? Well, we educate, and try to reform it.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	I calls'em as I sees'em.  Since adoptees are treated as goods exchanged for profit, I see private adoption as an industry.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	I WISH IT WASNT AN INDUSTRY, but it is. think of the amount PAP's pay for the child-tens of thousands per child.<br>  and the marketing...its genius. <br>  its on tv, in movies, newpapers, magazines, BILLBOARDS. its all over. just how much money does it take to run an ad in all those places? i know i had to run an ad once, it was 4 lines and cost me something like $15. now take the full page ads you see-or a long tv clip-or a huge billboard. spread them all over the world in every social level community. <br>  i wonder how much that costs? i wonder how they (a company that only 'cares' about the well being of a child) are able to produce such huge amounts of money for that. oh yeah.....the babys they get pay for that. <br>  <br>  so if having a product people want, advertising worldwide, making huge profits, convincing people that normally wouldnt use your service that it is actually best for them isnt considered and industry.....THEN WHAT IS IT?|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Adoption has to be an industry. They are always somebody looking for an infant to adopt. I don't understand why my kids were targets to place for adoption. Yes I understand the fact that I have gone to trade school to become a medical assistant and yes I am young and yes my kids are healthy and white.<br>  <br>  People have no regard how I feel when they bluntly ask me at grocery stores: Can I adopt her/him. At least when my kids get to be 18 to 24 months old they finally stop. People are out there making sure young women know about adoption. As early as when you first announce I am pregnant, right after you give birth, and while you are grocery shopping with your child.<br>  <br>  I wish people would go away with adoption. Look if I didn't want my kids I would not be parenting them. They would have been aborted. I always wanted children, ever since I could remember. I once asked my mother if she could get pregnant and give me her baby to raise. I was 12. I know when I was 4 I demanded that my mother give me a little sister. She accidentally got pregnant and had me another brother.|`|jQc3Y3Qtaa	over $1.4 billion dollars annually is generated by selling i mean adopting children in the U.S. alone.  judges and public officials working with them. government grants, media. law makers and attorneys in the pocket.  that is adoption in america. sounds a lot like an industry to me. that or the mafia.|`|6avKnzkoaa	I think 'Adoption' as a whole is a very gray topic. <br>  There are many different perspectives and views on it - against it or for it.<br>  It also depends on each individual's upbringing on their perception on adoption / their own experiences of adoption - whether they adopted out a child/adopted a child/was an adopted child.<br>  The reasoning behind why adoption was carried out in the first place is also a very personal matter and there are many reasons why it happened. Some bad some good. It's easy to make a judgment on someone else's action, but I personally try not to judge someone for their actions as I'm not that person, I probably won't know what they are going through. <br>  IMO, people using babies as a commodity isn't 'right'. I think every mother, whether they adopt the child out/abort it/raise it, will have some sort of emotional attachment to that individual situation whether they are aware of it or not, and whether they show it or not. They might not be upset/distress about it, but I'm sure it will always be at the back of their minds as a part of their history in life. <br>  Adoption overall to me, has its good and bad. It can cause detrimental affects on both the adopted child and/or birth parents. However, there have been cases where it has worked out for both parties. No one can really tell what will happen in the future. Every decision we make is a gamble including the impending existence of a child.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	In the USA infant adoption IS an industry. There is no other word for it.<br>  And sadly Hugh Jackman's wife is pushing extremely hard for Australia to end up the same way.<br>  She wanted babies so bad - that she just went to the US to get herself some. (then closed up an open adoption because it got too 'messy' - ie she didn't want the mother in her life)<br>  <br>  Private adoption agencies get their money only when they've wrenched the child out of his/her mothers arms - and placed said baby into the adoptive parents family.<br>  They don't care what the child or the mother will feel about any of it.<br>  It's ALL about the money.<br>  <br>  INDUSTRY.<br>  There is no better word for it.

VRSUyeqbaa	does it look like a cold sore? it could be that you just bit your lip or something. i wouldnt worry too much. you are just anxious and excited all at the same time.|`|AA12000802	Cold sores and mouth ulcers are VERY dangerous for newborns.  I read the article on the Daily Mail as well.  You can buy medicine but the best thing you can do is talk to your midwife.  Don't kiss your baby, always wash your hands and be careful that others around you don't have a coldsore.  In another article, a baby went blind because a visitor with a coldsore kissed the baby.  By the way, I also suffer from coldsores.|`|3iTmXKImaa	If it is the first time you have had one i would go to the doctor, thats when babies can get poorly.

Its scary I know, as soon as I saw the report I called my doctor but as I said because I've had the virus a long time my baby is protected, if you've had these cold sores before you're baby will have built up her own immunity to them whilst growing inside you. But to be perfectly honest if you've not had blisters followed by a scab then it doesnt sound like a proper cold sore maybe just a  cracked lip..perhaps you should see your doctor to put your mind at ease.  A cold sore starts with redness that tingles like a slightly burning itchy feeling then a blister or blisters will come up and they'll take a few days to scab over but the burning itchy tingly feeling lasts the whole time, if this doesnt sound like what you have then perhaps its not a cold sore at all!

My other twin saw it and went to grab one of the pebble poop and proceeded to put it in her mouth.  I ran at the speed of light before she did and grabbed it off her (yuk) and cleaned up the rest of the poop.  I then immediately grabbed her and her sister and put them in the bath and made sure that they were clean and free of poop.  Who knows what would of happened if she ate the poop.  Thinking about it makes me want to throw up.   Now I never leave my girls in just their nappies.

45xNJ7Ncaa	You can determine this by taking your temp first thing in the morning using a basal thermometer. A few days after you ovulate, your temp will elevate and stay elevated until your next period or you deliver a baby. You want to count the number of days that you have elevated temps in a row after ovulation. If you have 10 or more, you have healthy hormone levels to support a pregnancy.|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	I agree with the first poster.  First pinpoint the day you ovulate, which is best accomplished using fertility charting/basal body temperature.  You can learn how to do this by taking the free online course at fertilityfriend.com.  Once you pinpoint  your ovulation day, count how many days there are until you bleed.  If you enter your data on fertilityfriend, it will help you calculate the length of your LP.<br>  <br>  Also, 10 days is on the very low side for an LP.  If your LP isn't at least 12 days each and every cycle, you would likely benefit from progesterone suppositories (and they probably can't hurt in terms of getting pregnant and keeping the pregnancy).|`|GzOdn8tqaa	you time it
LhV10HZcaa	I think what she gets when she's acting like that is attention. She would make a big fuss whenever you wanted to take her in the car so you gave her attention when you tried to persuade her to get on the car. Getting on the bus was her victory. Now, that taking the bus is common practise cooperation won't give her attention anymore so she's seeking out new ways to get your attention.<br>  Attention isn't a bad ting per se, actually it is, in a way, your "weapon" because this is what she ultimately wants.<br>  What you should do now: Give her LOTS of praise for good behaviour. Anything that is a rule in your house and she sticks to, any good behaviour towards her sister, in short any kind of behaviour you want from her praise (a lot).<br>  And for the problems: ignore her whenever she is behaving like that. Completely ignore her. I know it can be very embarassing on the bus, so try that: <br>  Get ready to go on the car, if she protests ask her, if she'd rather stay home on her own (put the emphasize on "on her own"). That might help, if it doesn't, get on the car (take your time, she might change her mind here) then drive off around the corner (she might then come after you). If all that doesn't help , come back because you "forgot" something.<br>  If you stick to praising her good behaviour, keep telling her what a good girl she is, she should get over her "fear" of cars very soon.  Don't be a softie ;-)|`|45c225e1fbbf144b5f2d4c805307255eaa	My poor mom went throught the same thing with me, with elevators.  I was claustrophobic.  Maybe she has developed a phobia of automobiles.  I remember doing the same thing.  Mom never had to force me because we could take the stairs.  But I remember how desperate it felt and I kicked and screamed too.  Take her to a therapist.  The United Way has help available for a nominal fee on a sliding scale.|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Can you ask her calmly which of the two she will do. Explain you have to go out and tell her she is coming. But as a treat today she can choose if she comes nicely in either the car or the bus. But she must be good and do it nicely. Perhaps tell her she can have a little treat if she is very good. Do you do reward charts for other things? If not it may be a good time to start with this. If she goes in the car nicely twice she can have a small present that type of thing.<br>  I suspect that she realises that you stopped making her go in the car because she made a fuss, now she is using the same method to get out of going on the bus. She has learned how to get what she wants (by making a fuss) and I don't blame you for relenting, but she will have to re learn her behaviour.<br>  Alternatively  you could take her somewhere fun in the car so she wants to go and get her in the habit that way, it may actually be going shopping that shes trying to avoid|`|zh9Jjddvaa	Maybe she is suffering form motion sickness but doesn't know how to tell you. Has she recently had an ear infection that could have left her a little blocked, leading to balance problems. It's worth getting her checked with your GP.<br>   Does your BF ever take her out on his own, has he had a bump or other problem she may have witnessed whilst in the car with him? That could have led to this phobia.<br>  <br>  Does she have other fears or phobias or repetitive behaviours - could she possibly be slightly on the autistic spectrum? Look for examples of other behaviours where she refuses or seems unable to conform - see your GP if you are worried.<br>  <br>   Or is she just exercising her rights and doesn't feel like going in the car or on the bus? <br>  <br>  All food for thought but sorry no answers as I don't know the history and I haven't seen for myself exactly what happens. Try asking yourself the questions and see if one fits then you can begin addressing the problem directly. Good luck|`|wnQrHRIzaa	Sorry to say this but she is way to big to be acting this way. She is 4 years old!!! NOT a little toddler... I would have a talk with her and see exactly what the deal is. Make sure that its just YOU and HER around. Perhaps your boyfriend is doing something inappropriate in the car with her....whether its his driving....or something worst. Really honey, this is not normal.|`|AgBH66nJaa	It could be anything, it can even be to do with your other daughters pram, I doubt it but some kids have been known to kick up a fuss when they're siblings get to go in a pram because they want to as well, so they start making life as awkward as possible, e.g. not getting on the bus when you go out - unlikely but it happens.<br>  You said in earlier questions that you're boyfriend comes round and is angry and argues in front of the children, maybe she has picked up the behaviour from him, if a child observes someone behaving outrageously and getting what they want then they will copy it in order to see if they too can get what they want. She might be testing how far she can push you or seeing if she can get what she wants by behaving this way. If she liked the bus before then I'd suggest that she is doing it to see what will happen.<br>  Try rewarding her when she goes on the bus, if she has a food she really likes then take that with you and tell her if she is good on the bus then she can have it, same with the car, then ease her back into getting on them without the drama.|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	i feel so sorry for you as my first son was exactly the same.it started when he was about 3 yrs old through no reason we could think of. id wait for a bus and when it arrived hed scream blue murder ,try to run off and throw himself on the floor. the amount of times ive had to walk very long distances home was awful. he just grew out of it but it wasnt until he was about 5 or six.<br>  im sorry i dont have an answer for you but i sympathise greatly.|`|OGXcP1l7aa	Sounds like she is having nightmares about it.<br>  Ask her if this is the case and if it is talk it through with her.

47eiwyMLaa	Paternity can be determined by the blood of the murdered fetus post abortion or by the amniotic fluid prior to abortion.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	First of all, if she was sleeping with a bunch of different guys, your friend should kick her to the curb, go get tested for STD's, and then be glad that he won't be tied to some dirty skank for the next 18 years. I mean honestly, who cares who the father is? Clearly the girl is nasty sleeping with all those different guys and no matter who the dad is, it's not gonna change the fact that she slept with all those other guys. <br>  <br>  Your friends best bet is to cut his losses and move on from that "relationship", especially if she is going to kill the baby anyway.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Paternity tests would only be available after birth.

bpZp8UjKaa	When my husband and I tried for # 2 we bought a ovulation test and the first time I saw I was ovulating we tried and I got pregnant right away!
45xNJ7Ncaa	If its a pregnancy test, any line is positive no matter how faint or dark.  Only the OPK's require lines to match the test line.<br>  HCG hormones double every 48 hours so if you test in two more days, the line will be darker.  <br>  Congrats!|`|gjVeJFRtaa	nope your preggy i had a faint line and i was 6 weeks gone but i did lose my baby|`|JjBwydymaa	wow... CONGRATULATIONS hunni..<br>  <br>  Looks like your a mummy! Good luck in your pregnancy! xxxx|`|hlWdFTcjaa	No it doesn't, a line is a line. If you are still unsure about it, wait about 3 more days (your HCG levels get higher and easier for the HPT to detect) and test again. Good luck hun!|`|NOz2FRlraa	No, a faint line is still a positive. Congrats!|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Congrats.Go to your Dr and get him / her to verify that you are preg|`|ObngKaoWaa	if u're talkin about the pregnancy test then HOORRAAAAYYYYY U'RE PREGNANT!!! but if u were talkin about ovulation predictor then a faint line is not a positive.for opk the line HAS to be either as dark or darker than the test line but with pregnancy test any line is a line!!|`|WZQKevt8aa	Nope, a line is a line.

uqnQ9Y9haa	Just keep an eye on the little one, if he starts to get dysentery or vomits then i would take him to the local clinic or hospital salmonella can be serious so better safe than sorry. But if your friend is really worried and wont wait and see if hes ok call your health visitor they will advise and put her mind at rest.<br>  Hope hes ok.<br>  <br>  <br>  Below doing the thumb down obviously is not a mother, yes kids eat worse but the bacteria in raw egg  and in chicken is by far one of the worst for causing food poisioning. .....Mother, nurse and health and hygene certficates|`|FD8I4zthaa	No problem. Just watch out for any potential salmonella.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Think about this! The taste of raw egg is so disgusting I doubt very much he swallowed it!!

Why get worked up over something trivial like that. It's only an issue if he's allergic to eggwhites or there was salmonella in the eggs. If either is the case, he'll get sick very quickly and then she should take him straight to hospital, not a doctor.|`|wiqspYzLaa	Shouldn't be a problem. I gave my 13mth old raw yolk an she just got the runs this is before I new not to give them any raw egg. <br>  She has no problems with cooked egg an egg in food.<br>  So if your mates child is the same with egg I would just keep an eye on her for any reaction.
r7q8LW7Aaa	If a bottle is what settles her - then it's likely hunger that wakes her. It sounds like a growth spurt to be honest so just keep feeding her when she wants it and she'll settle back into her old routine in no time.<br>  ETA - It is no longer recommended to put baby rice in a bottle - it should ONLY be fed with a spoon unless your baby has severe reflux and your doctor advises it. At 4 months, she is old enough to start solids, but she may not be ready for them yet, so I'd research the signs and look out for them.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son did this for a week when he turned four months.  I just fed him at night, or gave him his dummy, some nights he just wanted the dum.  It was over in a week, most likely it's a growth spurt.|`|om89gdFIaa	When my daughter was about that age, I was giving her bottles as usual, but she kept waking up, and like your daughter, only another bottle, (which she seemed to drink half asleep), would pacify her.  My Mum suggested that it was because she was hungry she was waking up, and just "milk" formula wasn't quite enough.  Try putting a couple of teaspoons of baby rice, (the powder type), in with her milk.  If that helps, it would seem that it may be time to start introducing the first stage baby foods into her diet.  I did ask my midwife if it was OK for me to do this, and she said that if my daughter was taking it OK, then it was fine.  If your daughter was teething, then she would probably be irritable during the day too, and sometimes babies can have a "flushed" appearance around their cheeks.  Gently feel along her gums to see if teeth are coming through.  If you think she may have sore or tender gums, there are gels than can be purchased from any chemist that can ease this.  Also the kind of teething rings that you chill in the fridge/freezer can help.  Good Luck.  Christine|`|98OlWbtXaa	Has she started any new physical stage?  Rolling over on her own, or something?  I noticed that every time my son hit a new mobility milestone (rolling over, sitting up, pulling up, crawling, walking, etc.) he would have trouble sleeping for about 2 weeks, then things would go back to normal.<br>  <br>  Have you changed anything about her bedtime routine, or her diet?<br>  <br>  Also, she may be teething.  Is she extra drooly, or chewing on her hands or blanket?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wK4kqhHkaa	my daughter did the same thing. was a wonderful sleeper then hit the 4mth mark and regressed.  I read up about it and supposedly there brains are going through rapid growth and they often don't sleep as well when they are coming up to hitting a milestone.  Maybe a new milestone is just around the corner.  Or it could be teething.   Hang in there its probably just a little bump in the road, it will improve! Best of luck|`|bst23Cq2aa	There is a possibility that your little girl is teething, you could try giving her some calpol before she goes to sleep, that is what i do with my son and he has started sleeping through the night again. good luck.|`|wNtW1hXLaa	there is a 12-16 week growth spurt in which she will need to feed and sleep more. make sure she is getting as much in at each feed during the day in line with what is recomended for her age. the fact that she is drinking the bottle during the night may indicate that it is food related. make sure she is napping well during the day also to ensure she is getting enough sleep.<br>  <br>  if my baby is thrashing around but not crying i just let her settle herself back to sleep but you did say she cannot settle. it may be teething but i havent gone through this yet. Mine is only 3 months. sorry i am not much help :-)|`|GtUtZSEEaa	I had the same experience with my son. he was sleeping through the night till he hit four months, thereon he woke up as much as every two hours for a feed. I found out that one reason for the restlessness is that by 4 months babies start to sleep more like adults and therefore they go through REM sleep every 45 minutes which means they tend to wake up around the same time. Anyway the only way i could get him back to sleep most times was to feed him. since i was BF he would most of the time come into my bed and then snuggle up and sleep. definitely slept better in my bed but i didnt want that to become a habit so just stuck on with feeding and returning to his cot. <br>  <br>  It will pass...now at 7 months he sleeps through the night.|`|zVSg2GSjaa	You should't let her sleep after 2 to 3 in the afternoon. Play with her and don't let her sleep.<br>  good luck!
RdgzULeUaa	I am 21 and just recently had an abortion.  It was a hard decision.  Everyday my mind changed.  I knew I would be a great mother.  But I looked at the facts.  Its very expensive to raise a child.  Also I am in college and have no insurance.  We both have part time jobs and no money for a place of our own or anything for that matter.  Everything is funded by our parents.  I don't think I could live with the fact of putting my child up for adoption.  I use to be against abortion until it happened to me.  I know I made a mistake but it would have been an even bigger mistake to have a child I would not be able to support financially.  I don't regret it.  I sometimes wonder how big my belly would be.  I would have been around 23 weeks.  In the end I know I made the right choice and we will have other children when the time is right.  Another reason I had the abortion is because I just turned 21 and had been drinking alot before I found out I was pregnant.  I couldn't bare bringing a child in this world with possible birth defects because of my stupidity.  You will know what the right decision is.  The abortion procedure was not that bad.  I have a friend who has a baby and is 21 and she has it so hard.  She loves her baby but wishes her life could be different.  You are young and have alot ahead of you.  If you know for sure you can make it work have the baby.  I knew I couldn't make it work.  Especially with the economy how it is.  Make sure you can live with your decision.  Alot of people regret abortion and get depressed.  I got a little depressed due to hormones but I am completly content with my decision.  My parents would not have supported me and my child.  Hopefully yours will.  Good luck and keep me updated!|`|zI5UFV6yaa	if i were you i would keep the baby!<br>  you created it and you should treasure it.|`|DgfJCzTZaa	Listen to your instincts. Just make sure that you are mentally, physically, and emotionally ready for a life change. I had my son 6 days after I turned 19 so some people say that I'm a teen parent and I now my son is 13 months old and very happy and healthy. Your instincts will lead you to make the right chose if you just listen and follow them and don't be selfish. Think of the baby that you are bringing into this world. I hope that helps good luck.|`|hhyjsYw5aa	you've created life<br>  don't abandon it, treasure it<br>  don't give the child away imagine the pain they will experience not knowing who their biological parents are.<br>  your freaked now but after you have the baby; you'll fall in love with your treasure after all everything happens for a reason.<br>  <br>  i think the hardest part will be telling your parents, but before you do be certain of what you want to do; follow your heart<br>  <br>  congrats and good luck|`|zj32aZ2eaa	1) If you keep the baby, be prepared for your life to change. You as an indiviual will become invisible, at least for the first year. No friends, no going out, etc...This baby will depend on you 100%. Talk to your parents and see if they're on board, cuz you'll all the help you can get. I'm 28 and just had my first baby and it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, not to mention I'm extremely indepedent and it's been hard having something so small be so demanding and dependant. The smiles, the learning and the love is all worth it though if you decide to take it on and be part of the best club in the world...<br>  2)Adoption can be good, but ask yourself if you can handle knowing there's a little you out there and how other people are raising your baby.<br>  3)Well, I don't believe it all that much, but if you can't finacially support yourself or have any family support, then do what you must.|`|52U22fiAaa	You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and you are lucky to have a supportive partner.  I would say you are a good candidate for keeping the baby.  If you can do so, welcome the baby with open arms and just take it one day at a time.

But when I was ur age I already had 3 kids.  <br>  <br>  I just turned 18 of the 4th of March.  My husband and I had our first son when I was 16 and we got married when he was 6 months old by our own choice.  Then I got pregnant with twin boys at age 17 and had em in December.  So I am now 18 with 3 boys.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I are being homeschooled and are doing great with it.  He has a job making more than most of our family does with the exception of his dad.  I plan on staying at home with my kids until they are in school then goin to college.  After that I will start my career, he can quit his job, go to college and start his career.  We have most of everything planned out<br>  <br>  We have our own home and cars.  We only owe on our Mountaineer now.  So we're financially set and we're trying to rack up our credit to buy a bigger home.  (we didn't plan on having twins)<br>  <br>  We aren't living on welfare except WIC and only qualify because we did have twins.<br>  <br>  You will be fine, get some assistance from the country if you need it.  Your parents will be shocked at first but later they will feel better about it esp. once the baby arrives.  You will be fine I promice.  It sounds like you two have worked out most of your plans and they sounds great esp for coming up with them in only a few short days.  Set down with your parents and explain all of those things to make them feel more confident that you two can take on such a large responsibility and you will be okay.

Everyone that I have ever came in contact with have said nothing but good about my husband and I.   Our families are proud.  And even though we grew up early it was by our own choice.  I am not becoming another teen statistic like everyone would expect from a young mother.  I haven't yet.  Nor will I ever if it is by my choosing.

You don't want to and if you did you would not forget it as long as you live.<br>  <br>  You really do sound like you have thought it through, probably though if you are leaning towards keeping it then once you see your baby after he or she is born then you will not be able to say goodbye and let someone else raise him or her.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, the decision has to be yours. Don't let family or friends sway you. You sound like you are quite independent and would take care of yourselves so its up to you.

sK8ZhTahaa	You would be better off eating real fish, crab sticks are made from all the left over bits of fish that no one would knowingly eat.<br>  They are not made from any sort shell fish at all.|`|ioZeveazaa	I am not sure as to what crabsticks are however from experience I have had crab a handful of times throughout my pregnancy and it did no harm to my baby. Just don't eat too many of the sticks. Try to keep it limited. Don't eat shellfish more than one time a month and fish of certain kinds usually keep limited to 1-2 servings a weeks. Check American Pregnancy Association.com for a list of bad fish and good fish. But yeah...just keep your servings lows when you go to the party and you will be good. Also make sure the crab is cooked THOROUGHLY. Good luck!!|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I'm 21 weeks pregnant and was really craving crabsticks the other day so I looked on the back of the pack.

If he misses a nap he is nuts all day....<br>  <br>  Maybe try putting him down about 30mins earlier than usual so that he isnt overtired so goes down easier.<br>  <br>  But if you think he is ready give it a go... You can always increase it back to 3 naps if it doesnt work!!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I barely even remember my daughter taking 3 naps during the day. She used to cat nap from birth until 5-6 months of age. At 6 months is when I noticed a solid schedule in her napping and eating patterns. I know at 6 months she was definitley napping only twice through the day- about 2 hours each, maybe longer. She is now 10 months old and still napping twice during the day but for shorter periods. Occasionally she will only nap once. If I were you I wouldn't fight his third nap. As babies get older, they need less sleep through out the day. If you can see he isn't tired, then let him play so he sleeps better for his other naps. <br>  <br>  Here is a link which helped me<a href="http://www.babycenter.ca/baby/sleep/sleepneeded/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.ca/baby/sleep/slee...</a>|`|8wnvhBQTaa	My twins were around 6 months when they dropped down to two naps but on the odd day they would stll take 3 naps it wasn't until about 7 months hthat they dropped it completely.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	My sons name is Lucas :) I think he was around 7 months when he was down to two naps|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Around my son's 1st birthday is when we transitioned from 3 down to 2.

How can you have him in your life with no trust. He's only around you cuz he can't get any from anyone else, is exausted with dating or he wants to settle. You could've scared him so much that he could be coming around, but I'd take him to counselling first. It's your judgement call, just remember this will effect you and the baby in the long run.<br>  My friends boyfriend was like that to her as well, then when the baby came he ditched for good. <br>  <br>  You know him best, but I'm guessing he likes chasing you...and then when he has you he wants to go.  If you guys work it then cool, but I don't think it'll last past the first year.|`|GjuRYsITaa	i wouldn't trust him as far as i could through him, you have to ask yourself if you hadn't of rung him would he have contacted you,,<br>  why the sudden change of heart i would be very suss if i was you|`|aI4wgxRFaa	He might or he might not.

Ob0d7g7Raa	1st baby was 5mths old, i started her on farax with Breast Milk, then after a few weeks i added pureed apple to it, then started giving her different things, She self weaned at 8mths around the time she got her 1st tooth.<br>  2nd baby was 6mths old and she started on the same thing as baby #1, but with formula, she BF til 5mths but i couldnt keep up with her demand she was born 6 1/2 weeks early and i had to Pump for 2 1/2-3 weeks why she was in NICU so it didnt help my supply.<br>  Baby #3 was around 4mths old, started on farax with BM, then added pureed apple,pears, banana then started giving her pureed vegies with BM in them. She was having both BF and formula, and has only lately decided she doenst want BM anymore, so is on all formula feeds.<br>  <br>  They were all started on solids when they showed signs of being ready,like opening their mouth when a spoon was put near it, watching us eat and coping our mouth movements....<br>  <br>  You will be able to tell when they are ready.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	I started both my babies on solids at the age of 6 months, but it was only one teaspoon per day for the first month.  I fed them mashed banana.  You have to wait until there are some black spots on the skin, then cut off a tiny piece and pull off the stringy bits, then mash until mushy.  If it's too thick you can add a few drops of breastmilk, formula or cooled boiled water.  For the first few days they spat it out but then started to eat it and seemed to like it.  What factors influenced me to start?  Well, I thought I should start then as waiting longer might have made it harder to get them used to solids, but it might not have.  I didn't start earlier because I don't believe babies should have anything other than breastmilk for the first 6 months.  They didn't show any signs of wanting solids though - they were happy with breastmilk.|`|aFykmpT1aa	just under 3 months. farax in a bottle between breastfeeding, then after about a month of that, weetbix and first step baby food. he was eating the same meals as i was by the time he was 6 months. if its easier for you, doctors recommend you can feed nothing but breastmilk until 6 months|`|cAfaXmbUaa	my baby was 5 mths when i started and i started because she was always hungry so my mum suggested starting her on the baby rice just a few mouthfuls around lunch,|`|CY8jAXPDaa	Age - 4mos.<br>  <br>  How did i know? - He was drinking over 16oz of bottle in the morning and before bed, but it was too much on his tummy that he would throw up, but he was so hungry.<br>  <br>  What factors influenced me? - Because i couldn't bare to see him try to fill his tummy that much he was throwing up, especially because he was also feeding every 2hours.<br>  <br>  What i fed him - Baby cereal.<br>  <br>  I didn't breastfeed.<br>  <br>  I was told by the health visitor, that he was ready, and he definitely was.|`|DhmUgq0maa	- At 3 months old due to acid reflux an not being able to keep the bottle down.<br>  - He was always hungry an could never keep the bottle down so was always crying.<br>  - Doctor <br>  - Rice cereal in the morning for breakfast and at night to fill him up before bed, Until 4 months he went on to puree veg an fruit and 6 months went to chunky table foods<br>  - He refused to latch onto the breast when he was 4 months old so was put on the bottle and is 8 months an still on formula.
oj1TszL2aa	Sex for me is a natural thing, and is neither positive or negative, that's just what people and societies make it. Like it or not, people do use sex to cause harm to others, and that's when it really shouldn't be happening. <br>  <br>  Everyone should lose their virginity when they are in a stable, loving relationship with someone, when they are capable of having a sensible and calm conversation with that partner about contraception and are able to make a joint decision on what will be used, when they have discussed what would happen were the girl to get pregnant and have come to a decision on that, AND (I know this one will be controversial) when they are above the legal age of consent in the country in which they live. The age of consent is there for a reason. Sex can have consequences that you ideally need to be an adult to deal with, and there is no way you can avoid them 100%. <br>  <br>  Why people do it? It depends on who the people are and the situation they are in. In an ideal world, they do it because it is the ultimate expression of love between two people, enables you to be closer than you can be in any other way. It allows people to have children. It also feels good, however this means that some people have sex simply because they want to experience that pleasure. Seriously though, 'why do people have sex?' reads as a very strange question, because there are so many different reasons for it, very few of which fit neatly into words. <br>  <br>  Sex can control relationships because it is a powerful thing. Completely aside from the consequences of sex (STD's, pregnancy) having sex does change the nature of your relationship, and that I think is something that many teenagers who decide to have sex don't realise. Sex is a very intimate thing, and makes you feel very vulnerable, and also relationships need to have a balance between doing sexual things, and spending time together doing other things. It's difficult to work that out at the beginning. If one person wants to have sex more than the other, the one who wants it more frequently can end up feeling as if their partner doesn't care about them, whilst their partner can end up feeling hurt, used, and as if their relationship is just about sex. <br>  <br>  I have never really come across any teenagers who think that pregnancy won't happen to them, in all honesty, but I guess those who do think that it's just as a result of immaturity. I do think that contraception should be a requirement for the first time you have sex (unless one is married, and wanting children). Personally, I am unlikely to get pregnant because doctors think that I only have a very small chance of being fertile (I don't wish to go into why), but my partner and I still use contraception just in case. <br>  <br>  I also think that too often the consequences of sex are just viewed as 'getting pregnant' and nothing else. As I've said, it has the power to change how you see yourself, how you see your relationship, and those are things that no amount of contraception can prevent from happening. And that's completely aside from STD's. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|zt5FQUS7aa	it shouldn't be done before marriage and shouldn't be done with anyone else except with your partner.<br>  <br>  a woman wouldn't earn respect from men if she's already "used"..<br>  a woman with many mates is dirty. *no offense* but decency still matters, for me. it's a modern world though..|`|721055bb4f4a90cbc769262d4684a39daa	Only have sex when you are old enough and mature enough to handle a child!  <br>  <br>  or as I would say don't do the crime if you can't do the time|`|TaFrxxJXaa	after marriage.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	There is no "should", it is whenever the individual (or couple really) is comfortable and prepared for having sex and the consequences that may come with it.<br>  <br>  People do it because.....well, it feels good. Younger teens do it because they think it will make them more mature. The real purpose of sex is to reproduce. I don't know, there are many reasons why people have sex.<br>  <br>  Sex can control a relationship if you do it pre-maturely because sometimes people are not emotionally or physically ready to deal with sex and it's consequences, so it ends up destroying the relationship. It also puts pressure on people and makes them feel inferior. Sometimes people end up using their relationship purely for sex.<br>  <br>  Why won't the consequences happen to you? The "consequences", ie. pregnancy and STD's COULD happen to anyone. People who think otherwise are too immature and ignorant to be having sex in the first place.<br>  <br>  My advice: save it until you are sure you are ready and you are with the one you love.|`|B4y6En96aa	I don't think that there should be an age limit on sex. Do it when it feels right to you, just don't be an idiot about it. If you can't handle being pregnant, use a condom or go on the pill. If you have unprotected sex, try the morning after pill.<br>  <br>  There's no one solid reason why everyone has sex, it's usually a spur of the moment thing, or "when two people love each other very much and want to show it."<br>  <br>  I guess it can kind of control a relationship in the sense that sometimes couples only want sex from each other. Sometimes, a couple will tend to get bored of their relationship and just want sex from the other person. You should never let it get that bad, ever.<br>  <br>  And the "it won't happen to me" thing is bullshit.

As long as you're in a loving, committed relationship I see no problem with  it.

Oh well, shet happens, y'know?|`|tN9KO8BLaa	When I say that, I mean people that have a cruel sense of humor. Say their last name was Cox, and they named their son Harry. Or maybe their last name was Bridges and then named their son London. I think if their name was London Bridges maybe would be made fun of more than if their name was London Smith- or any other last name. I don't really know of anyone that was made fun of for just having a unique first name. <br>  <br>  I am sure if someone had the name Harry Cox or London Bridges or any other weird combo, their piers would eventually accept it. If they were a boy and were going to have the name for the rest of their life, they would probably have remarks made about the name- for the rest of their life.|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	Wow.

I stepped on their toes.... they asked me to didn't they? lol<br>  <br>  As a parent you really need to think about your child's name and how it will affect their life... ask yourself? will it get made fu of in school? will this name always suggest a specific gender? how well will this name grow with my child? how will it affect their professional/ adult life? <br>  <br>  Think of your child and all of that when you name them. <br>  <br>  My friend always said a good rule of thumb is to find a child you either know or just met, tell them the name you are considering and ask them to come up with all the ways they can make fun of it.

LZk3z2ilaa	Ok, you don`t want to refuse the internal exams.  Most doctors and Midwifes start checking at 36 weeks I believe, unless you have a history or signs of early labor.  When it comes to the exams right before she checks you take a big breath and relax your whole body, the more tense you are the harder she has to push to reach your cervix and the more it will hurt.  Just think about how excited you will be to hear her say your dilated 2 or 3 cm.  That's almost half way there.  Good Luck!!!|`|go2SGvFxaa	its better to get them done. they did a fetal fibronectin test at 29 weeks and it came back positive so im lucky they did it otherwise my little one might have come 11 weeks early. <br>  <br>  they have changed my appointments to fortnightly and always do a speculam to see for dilation and check for leaks. so they are doing it for your bubs sake.|`|wK4kqhHkaa	Your best to get use to it.  They aren't comfortable but its just something that has to be done.  Im a tad worried for you labor is ALOT worse then an internal and about a billion times more uncomfortable!

If I were you I wouldn't refuse them because in some cases that is how to check for pre labor. My friend couldn't feel her contractions and the exam was the only reason that her doctor told her to go to the hospital because she was getting ready to have her baby at any moment. <br>  <br>  Don't let that comment scare you but that is the only readon that I would refuse the exams.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I had a high risk doctor and he said no one should touch you unless something is wrong (that's why they checked you when you were bleeding). You shouldn't have anymore checks until your in labour and at the hospital going to have your baby, usually within 20hrs of giving birth.|`|ioZeveazaa	I had my internal exams started at week 36appt.

cnlbQkyIaa	For all those who are saying that adoption is worse than abortion, they could not be more wrong. Letting your child live is the greatest gift you can give them. I know from experience that your child would be grateful for the life you gave them, knowing that you loved him or her so much that you did something very hard for you by giving him to another family who desperately wants a child. Putting you child up for adoption is the greatest gift you can give your baby. The gift of life.<br>  <br>  Some others might be saying now that your child will wonder why you didn't want him or her. But from experience i can tell you most adoptees know that their parents could not care for them.<br>  <br>  If you abort your child, then it will wonder forever in heaven why you did not want him or her to have a chance at life.<br>  <br>  Getting an abortion does not make you "un" pregnant. It just makes you the mother of a dead baby.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	It would be better on everyone if you aborted.<br>  This child will never understand why his/her mother gave him/her away for adoption - while 3 others were kept.<br>  Your kept children will never understand why you sent their sibling away.<br>  <br>  Being given away by your mother never gets any easier.<br>  <br>  To live adoption - as an adoptee - hurts.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Keep your abortion appointment. Its much less painful to you and the embryo.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Giving up your own flesh and blood is worse then aborting it. Adoption doesn't guarantee a better life. For the rest of your life and the child's life, you both will grieve. The child will ask why his own mommy didn't want him, etc. Adoption companies don't care about you or your child. It's all about the money. Also, people will say they will let you see the child and such but don't fall for greedy hands.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Contact your local authority, children and family division.<br>  <br>  Adoption in the UK is a social service for children.  Private adoption and the paying of 'expenses' is also illegal for obvious reasons (babies become commodities this way)<br>  <br>  You will have 6 weeks after the baby is born before you make a decision.  During this time the baby can be with you or your baby will be cared for with you visiting as often as you wish.<br>  <br>  No adopters are allowed to influence your decision during this time.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear you're considering separating siblings.  That's just so sad.  There are loads of support systems in place for mothers here in the UK.   Homestart is an excellent organization and to be honest, with three children already, one more isn't really going to make that much of a difference!  You can do it if you really wanted to.  The first year may be hard but once you're over that hurdle it will be fine, honestly.<br>  <br>  Consider contacting Homestart, or speak with the Community midwife to get you in touch with the numerous resources available to you that will support you in keeping your family intact.<br>  <br>  If you're local to me, I'd be more than happy to be a free home help.  Honestly.  I hate to see families separated and I'll help with childcare in any way you need :)|`|AA11616741	When you go for your next scan, tell the doctor that you are interested in placing the baby up for adoption.

Don't kill it off.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	A note to Americans - adoption is different in the UK as it has to be dealt with either the local authority or adoption agency.  Private adoptions are illegal and as far as I'm away pre birth matches don't generally happen.<br>  <br>  Think carefully before choosing adoption as I have had to live with my son being adopted and not knowing whether he was alive or dead for 23 years.  Fortunately we have been reunited for over 4 years but it doesn't make up for the lost years.  Although there is the option of open adoption which means letterbox contact and if you're extremely lucky you may get more than that but if unlucky it will be closed.<br>  <br>  My situation was different to you as I was coerced but had I known what would happened I would have had an abortion despite the fact I do have a good reunion with my son.|`|MtQlTYokaa	Adoption in the UK is different than here in the US, as others have explained.

Once baby grows a bit and gets to pulling themselves up, the base could lower down.<br>  <br>  It looked really nice, too.
AA11879371	I love the name Aiden.  Whoever told you that others would call the child "Aids" is a wacked-out pessimist.  It's a beautiful Irish name meaning fire.

The one Aiden I know doesn't really have any nicknames as far as I know, he's cool, he's popular, name's never been an issue for him.

0EZ0W5FPaa	As long as he's not losing weight, he's fine.  My daughter will have days at a time when she goes down to about 24 oz (usually 30-34).  She just isn't interested in it.  But she eventually hits a growth spurt and wants to eat more.  Flow with it.  Give him what he wants.  As long as he is still eating and he's not losing weight, you're golden!
3foSwZpWaa	I think so. I know a lot of people that said they did that to get pg., and my doctor suggested that I do that as well. It helps the sperm to move to the egg faster because of gravity... If your partner has a perfect sperm count and motility, you don't need to elevate your hips, but there's really no way to know how his sperm work unless you have had testing done, so just assume there might be a problem and elevate!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	the doctor told my friend to try, she had been trying for over a yr so had nothing to lose<br>  shes now 14wks with baby#1<br>  she was told to lay with pillow under her bum with legs against the wall for half hr - hr <br>  <br>  worth a try right
bpZp8UjKaa	I'm not sure about any other question but # 2 You normally ovulate 14 days after your period/ But if you want to know when you ovulate just go to walmart and buy a ovulation test
0EZ0W5FPaa	As soon as you missed your period.  Test in the morning if your testing a bit early.  Other than that, anytime after you were to start your period will bare the same results... so have at it!|`|5LzZYrQnaa	after you missed your period you could take a test|`|2DG2IIaQaa	You should take the test in 9 months. This would tell u weather you have a baby or not because 1 your gonna have it in your hands or 2 you epic failed lololololololololololololololololol.|`|dAkjYoVraa	Most of the tests you take that are over the counter rely on hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) levels in your urine. These show up 6 to 15 days after conception. The best time to try is in the morning when your Urine is the heaviest.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Wait another 2 weeks, as most people who've tested as early as 4 weeks, get negatives. Most hpt's will give a strong positive at 6 weeks or so. You've got to wait until your hcg levels rise...Hang in there...I know it can be torture. Good luck!
WNsjy5oFaa	those feelings in your belly are quite normal - your intestines aren't completely still and things moving through them such as stool and gas will sometimes be felt by you.<br>  <br>  the pill does not interfere with a pregnancy test result as test are looking for the pregnancy hormone bhcg whereas the pill contains oestrogen and progesterone<br>  if your taking your pill regularly then its unlikely your pregnant but if you've missed days or been ill or on antibiotics and your concerned you may be pregnant take a test to be sure|`|5LzZYrQnaa	no i dont thing you would get a positive test but maybe you should take one and ask your doctor about it|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	No it would not come out positve from the hormones in the pills.  You can take a test, and it will show if your are pregnant or not.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I agree with what stickwicket36 wrote!

I'm so sorry.. these are the symptoms of a misscarrige.. but you really should go to your doc and he'll find out what's going on.. good luck|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	That one is a tough one.  I think you need to speak to an OB about that and see if they can give you a vaginal ultrasound.  You may not have lost the baby.  Sometimes tests can come back positive and then negative.  It all revolves around that pesky hcg.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of women who experience vaginal bleeding in their first trimester.  Most times doctors can't explain why.  It just happens.|`|ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	Whatever it could be,<br>  GO RIGHT AWAY TO YOUR GYNECOLOGIST !!!!!<br>  <br>  What about<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ectopic-pregnancy-extrauterine-pregnancy-ectopic-gestation-extrauterine-gestation-eccyesis-metacyesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/ectopic-pre...</a>|`|Hu4PI0q2aa	What you need to do is see a doctor.

Seems like there is something wrong internally.
7XQwpBVaaa	Yes, it has happened to me.  Don't kid yourself it is positive, you are pregnant. Congratulations!!|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Your hcg levels (pregnancy hormone) doubles every 24-48hrs or so. So if it was faint and now strong, it's because you're further along and you have more hormones, thus easier to read.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You did get a positive because you read it right away and got a faint line. The reason it got darker was that it sat and the lines can fade or get darker the longer you have them out. I have my tests from both of my pregnancies and the lines did get a little darker. It happens.
HzpqPLVyaa	live with it BIATCH|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Not sure how preggers you are, but you'll probably feel better after 5days or so. You're more sensitive then normal, cuz the body produces 50% more blood during pregnancy. Take it easy.|`|r5VFLa84aa	Yea alright sista! just keep letting him hit it whenever he wants to, then come back in a few weeks and ask if you are pregnant!|`|p11HaDIWaa	nice....so whats the problem???|`|rJOuo24saa	wow yes i have =D<br>  <br>  give it two days =]]|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Hmm...Well thanks for the 2 points, Ms. Troll.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I have the same problems.

5IlaGPxUaa	I said i would never  co- sleep and for the first few weeks he was home he slept with me in bed.... He hates co sleeping now though has since about 11ish weeks lol<br>  <br>  Hmmm, I said i would Never give my son Formula... All the issues i had with breastfeeding ment that he has been fully on formula since 13weeks old<br>  <br>  I said that I would Never let him have a dummy past 6 months... Well he is 7 and a half months and he has them everywhere lol... <br>  <br>  Hmmm, I always said i would start solids at 6months and no earlier... Lol i started 13 days early at 5 and a half months and a day old...<br>  <br>  Oh well before he was born, I viewed parenting as a lot simpler and that you could Just decide how your baby would take to things but they are born with likes/dislikes and personalities...  Well i guess things dont just go how you planned...<br>  <br>  I guess because babysat my nephews and worked in childcare things jus went smoothly... And i always had backup at work... lol So i thought it would all go my way with Jordan haha..|`|fBGIUSfaaa	yes guilty as charged.. co-sleeping so i can get some sleep too.. the dummy didnt come into it till bout 11 months.. wat else? I swore by baby would always be clean... cant be helped when a lil boy plays outside.. everything you thought you wouldnt do kinda goes out the window once you realise its not as easy as you thought it would be! - i secretly laugh at the mums to be that have this rosy view of what their baby will be like.. little do they know all bubs go through stages you just gotta go with the flow though.. im currently at the start of tantrums- i swore my child would never be one of those 'naughty kids'! but now i know its part of the development for independence.. lol|`|7XQwpBVaaa	Give my 18 month old soda pop!  How terrible am I?  No, I don't give her a cup of it but I let her drink out of mine sometimes. <br>  I also co-sleep and said that I wouldn't but I have completely changed my mind about it. I love sleeping with my daughter!|`|S3koTSaeaa	Ditto on the co-sleeping. I was told horror stories of parents smothering their children & swore I'd never risk it. It started as an accident. I fell asleep nursing. Now she often sleeps on our chests. She never falls off and we never roll over.|`|JeyS52F8aa	watch tv while eating really hard to change  when they are are6 unless flick the switch on the power  board dinner and breakfast mainly|`|AA11383122	I agree with the co sleep now my little one is almost 2 and a half and she can't sleep in her bed at all. she's always sleeping with me.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Same, I wasn't going to co-sleep. But my daughter and I have been co-sleeping since she was 2 weeks old, and we sleep much better for it.

Its called Mother-ese, and because your speaking higher and slower, it helps the baby to begin to understand the basics of language and communication!! Its good!!! <br>  <br>  Co-sleeping is great too - its one of these things which everyone is doing but noone admits!! Except you that is! ;o)<br>  <br>  I swear that i will never be one of those parents who feeds her Toddler french fries from places like Mcdonalds! I think its awful - there is just no excuse - its not even like the kid is harassing you for them yet!! He wouldnt know the difference between junk and healthy - so why not just give him healthy!! grrr it makes me so mad!! im never going to do it ..<br>  <br>  However generally i do lots of things .... but i never say beforehand i wont, because i know i probably will! Except the french fries thing ... i definately wont!!|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I knew from the beginning we would be co-sleeping, so that's not mine.<br>  <br>  I swore up and down my kids would never have fast food... I at least get them apple dippers instead o french fries ; )<br>  I was also planning on homeschooling for the first couple of years. But my son has a speech delay and LOVES going to preschool! <br>  <br>  I'll probably be back to add more...lol|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I swore I wouldn't do the following:<br>  <br>  Formula feed <br>  Let the baby use a soother<br>  Co-sleep<br>  Start solids before 6 months<br>  Lose my patience<br>  Put the baby in jeans<br>  <br>  <br>  I've done all of the above for various reasons, mostly beyond my control!|`|pDRAciBnaa	give her chocolate!! shes 11mos and does have theoccasional choccy button :)<br>  <br>  ive learnt to stop saying 'i'd never do that'...
1rNVgEDIaa	No! Blocked nostrils are to be opened as soon as possible by instilling one drop of OTRIVIN Pediatric Nasal drops. You can alternatively use sterilized saline water which you can make yourself by boiling water up to 20 minutes in a steel utensil and use a sterilized dropper to instill one to two drops into the blocked nostril of your beloved child. Mouth-breathing will have its own hazards and hence must be avoided.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	You mean a nasal aspirator? Yes, it is fine if that's what you mean. As long as you don't do it more than once or twice in each nostril at a time. I have. It's fine. No worries.

You'll know if it's your water breaking cuz you'll feel a HUGE gush and it'll be like you stepped into a hot tub with tons of liquid (about 3 cups) between your thighs (or many people say it feels like you've peed yourself, but who does that?). Just becarefule now with the sex thing, cuz you don't want to cause an early labour. Take it easy for a few weeks, baby is almost here for a lifetime.|`|AA10290513	that water retention..normal.

DhmUgq0maa	My first child was born March 04 and 19 months later in October 05 I had my daughter, Then in June 08 I had my third.<br>  <br>  It was harder to be pregnant while still having a young baby that was still dependent on me 24/7 and it was very tiring, plus while i had a teething 6 month old i also had the oldest going through the terrible 2's and throwing tantrums then his sister would learn from him an start throwing tantrums too...It was never ending chaos for a while but when my eldest turned 3 an my daughter was 18 mths old it started to get easier as they started playing together and being able to do things for themselves gave me a bit of a break, Plus being so close in age it's like they are best friends and are growing up together, They are inseparable and are always doing something together.<br>  I'm glad i had them all close in age as there's not to big an gap where they have nothing in common like me an my brother (10 yr age gap) they can all grow up together.|`|5LzZYrQnaa	my friend had her first baby and i think about 6 months after her daughter she found out she was pregnant again. this time she was having twins. how crazy is that but her and her husband seem to be doing okay|`|3a2111cbdbb21d29109b011360342334aa	My mom had 2 kids before me , one was 20 and the other one 18 . suddenly she stopped taking medicine and she got pregnant.firs me and 10 months later my sister , It was so hard for her to take care of all of us but she did it and i think you can do it as well , kids grow up fast and they can help you in everything .you will forget the past and all the hard times you had .|`|iPGxXRHgaa	My daughter was 4 months old when i found out i was expecting again.... now my daughter turns 3yrs  august 22 & my son turns 2yrs september 18th.

C4ibOR7Laa	as for the shower or bath, have it as hot as you like, your body will let you know if it gets to much. i always have hot baths and im fine, i did however go into a hot tub at 7weeks and almost fainted i had to get out, that was my body saying stop!<br>  <br>  i think cats can carry an infection which can make you miscarry, or s that sheep? :S i know cat litter is harmful to the pregnancy as well<br>  <br>  dont take drugs, dont think alcohol, stay away from mouldy cheese and shell fish, uncooked meats, you know just stupid things common sense tells you not to give to a baby.<br>  no extreme exercise, eg bungee jumping, skiing, ice skating mainly because if you fall...<br>  walking and swimming are the best exercise, also pregnancy yoga or aerobics|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You don't want to be in anything too hot because it can raise your body temp and be harmful to the baby. You can be around cats you just can't come in contact or clean the litter box. That is because many cats carry an illness called toxoplasmosis. It's very common in cats and rarely effects humans but if you are pregnant and get infected it can severely harm the baby, even cause miscarriage so it's best to play it safe.|`|92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	I still take hot showers and I'm around my cat. You're supposed to avoid very hot baths/hot tubs and to be on the safe side you shouldn't change your cat's kitty litter because of toxoplasmosis. <br>  <br>  There's a TON of donts when you're pregnant it's pretty ridiculous. <br>  A few off the top of my head<br>  (1) Medicines. Don't take laxatives or ibuprofin/advil (only tyenol from now on). You should always check with your doctor before taking any medicine now. <br>  (2) Acne medicines, avoid benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid based products.<br>  (3) Dying your hair-- highlights are fine but you don't want the dye to touch your scalp. This one is controversial.<br>  (4) Avoid fish. There's certain kinds you can't eat (it's slipped my mind), avoid raw fish, and moderately eat canned tuna.<br>  (5) Avoid X-Rays. You'll get mixed opinions on this one. <br>  (6) Deli meats and hot dogs. Only eat them if it's steaming hot so it kills listeria (a bacteria). I remember being really paranoid about this one since I lived off sandwiches.<br>  (7) Caffeine. It's been linked to miscarriages so if you continue to drink it then use moderation-- the numbers that doctor give are random. I remember being able to fit in about 3 cokes from what my doctor told me.<br>  <br>  BabyCenter.com really helped me figure out most do's and don'ts and your doctor will give you a sheet with some on it. I also used the Mayo Clinic's Guide To A Healthy Pregnancy, it's a HUGE book with just about every possible thing you could imagine in it. I don't think there's one thing they don't cover lol. I also had What To Expect but hated it, I'd go through reading bit by bit (by how far along I was) and a lot of my concerns or discomforts weren't talked about for months. So not a fan of that series at all.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	hot showers are ok, as long as your not over heating from it.  Cats are fine also. Just avoid the litter box, because cat fecal matter can carry diseases.  Don't take most over the counter medications. Tylenol and tums are ok. Don't do things that cause your body to have jarring movements.  Do take prenatal vitamins daily. <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnancy/dosanddonts.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnanc...</a>|`|B24W8w43aa	You can't smoke, drink alcohol (some doctors say it's ok but better not to), eat soft cheeses or unpasteurised products.|`|JUvVUlq8aa	you cant drink, smoke .. im pretty sure you cant jump out of a plane either.. haha.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped a bit ?|`|zj32aZ2eaa	You can take warm showers, but not hot after 7mths, because you can overheat your body and hurt the baby. Babies don't have control over their own body temperature until they're born. You can be around cats, you just can't change the litter box at any time during your pregnancy, cuz you can get infected with toxoplasmosis and this will hurt your baby and could cause birth defects. I went swimming, went in hot tubs (no longer than 10min) and even went to the tanning salon (no longer than 12min) until I was 7mths. I have a beautiful healthy baby and vitamin D is good for you during pregnancy cuz it will decrease jaundice in birth.|`|igbdywwVaa	Haven't heard the hot showers or cat thing. But you'd want to stay away from anything like a hot tub, tanning beds etc. (anything that could heat the placenta). As for cats...the only thing I've heard of is cat feces as a problem and I'm not sure if litter is a potential problem also or if it's just the feces in the litter (I don't have cats). <br>  <br>  A great resource is the book 'What to Expect When You're Expecting'. Not only does it have a humor aspect but it pretty much touches (and sometimes goes indepth) into just about everything. Buy the most recent copy though. I picked mine up at Target for $13 or so. Of course the internet is a great resource but I like the books. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helped a little! Best wishes! =)|`|RdgzULeUaa	I wouldn't change kitties litter.  They even say if the cat walks on your bed or table you can get the toxin that way.  I have cats and don't plan on getting rid of them when I get pregnant.  I'm sure if your partner is willing to clean the litter everyday everything should be fine.  As far as hot showers I'm not too sure on that.  It would make sense that it would raise babies temp.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	You can take hot showers and be around cats.  You just can't get into a hot tub or clean a litter box.<br>  Oh, if you are planning to plant anything you are not allowed to dig unless it's like in pot with soft dirt.  Use gloves when ever you touch dirt outside like working out in the yard. No push mowing.  You will hurt for days.  Plus not good for the baby.|`|1F0nKNpIaa	I think that yo should not pick up heavy things or take very hot showers|`|8ZyiLq12aa	just dnt drink alcohol n smoke n dont over do it

WNsjy5oFaa	the concentration of pregnancy hormone is higher in the first urine of the day but most of todays pregnancy tests are so sensitive that they can be used at anytime of the day and some even before a period is missed<br>  <br>  if your still worried you may be pregnant and don't get your period do another test in about a weeks time and see what the result is then|`|wENdWT5kaa	No it doesn't matter. It is recommended that you use your morning urine to test, but you don't have to. <br>  <br>  I test in the afternoon with both my pregnancies and they both came out correct.|`|YzCPY48qaa	not a lot really,if you are testing early it is always best to use the first morning urine,it has the highest amount of hormones as it is undiluted.but in saying that i tested positive 2 days after my period was due at 1pm.so it just depends on your body really.x.|`|YVasdve0aa	I made this mistake.  I took a pregnancy test at the doctor's office and it came out negative.  (Had a UTI and couldn't get antibiotics without them being sure at the walk in clinic).  Three weeks later I took one at home in the morning first thing and it came out positive.  I've always been told that it does make a difference.|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	Nothing different.  If you are testing early with the new early testing kits, then the best time to do it is in the morning when the concentration of the hormone is high.  But if you're testing anytime after your period is due, then any time will show the same results.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	it doesn't matter, but what does is when you test. You need to test at 6 weeks or later to be sure. Calculate 6 weeks from when the first day of your last period was...that should work.|`|x0DjIfH6aa	the 2nd wee will do the just say the first one in the morning is better dont know why
HSe6n5Tlaa	I would mention it to your doctor.  I don't believe the excess drooling is still normal at that age.  My son had to wear a bib constantly from like 4 months to 7 months.  But by that point he had his first 8 teeth already (he was an early teether, 4 teeth at 4 months old).  But for the rest of his teething he didn't have the drool just pouring out like that.  My daughter never had to use the bib for drooling, but she put everything in her mouth.  That part is normal. Although I think my husband said that my stepson (now almost 10 years old - I wasn't around until he was almost 3) had to wear a bib for drooling until he was 2 and had all of his baby teeth in?  And he is fine.  I would mention it to your doctor next time you see him/her though, as you should be heading in soon for a 15 month check.  I wouldn't make a special appointment for it.
0zZZHXvVaa	you have a 28 day cycle so your period should have started on the 2nd march i think its time you took a test as it should show up now use the first morning urine as it is more concentrated good luck|`|fAN8snFdaa	EVERYBODY's cycle is different  could range from 27 days too 32 days.. the only way you will know if you are pregs is if you do a test oe better still if they havent come on in a few days go see the doc.. <br>  <br>  get a 3 pack test and do one today .. one tomorrow  and if STILl neg wait 1 day and do the last.. <br>  <br>  <br>  If it's what you want - I hope you are ;)|`|zj32aZ2eaa	If you're pregnant, then you'll be about 5 weeks. Here's how you count your cycle: Feb2-6 =4days long+28days =32day cycle. If you can remember when your period ended in January, then count from then until Feb2 and this will give you how many days you are in between (like 28, 26, 19), then add 4days in length and this will give you your cycle. As for being late, take a test in another week and it should be accurate. Most hpt's work best at 6weeks.|`|btIvC1esaa	preggo
AA11589772	Those can all be early pregnancy symptoms, so it's very possible! I wasn't so sure about the discharge though, so I looked it up and found this:<br>  <br>  "Discharge during the initial stages of pregnancy is one among various early pregnancy symptoms. Triggered by hormonal change the body undergoes, pregnancy symptoms discharge is categorized typically by clear or whitish mucous based discharge known as Leukorrhea. This vaginal discharge is mild smelling and does not causes much irritation. Early pregnancy discharge is almost like increased vaginal discharge just before the monthly cycle."<br>  <br>  I would buy a few home pregnancy tests. :) Hope it's a CONGRATULATIONS if you ARE pregnant! <br>  If not, then some of them could be just pre-menstrual.|`|AA10308264	when was your period due to come? secondly if it is already over a week .. get a Preg. test done 1st to confirm your pregnancy..|`|Hu4PI0q2aa	You need to take a pregnancy test to be sure.

4IXQ97rNaa	This is why punctuation is imprtant:<br>  <br>  "I didn't come in her but"<br>  <br>  FYI - pregnancy tests are more accurate than polling on Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  wait wait wait...you're not actually asking, is there a chance she isn't quite pregnant yet?  Dude, conception is immediate.|`|5LzZYrQnaa	YOU SHOULD WAIT 2 WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF SEX TO TAKE A TEST. IF YOUR NOT SURE WHEN SHE WILL GET HER PERIOD. SHE SHOULD ALSO GO TO THE DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE AND IF YOU TWO ARENT TRYING TO HAVE A BABY YET THEN YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT TYPES OF BIRTH CONTROL|`|aI4wgxRFaa	Once she's missed her period she can take the hpt test to get a good results. She can still take the pregnancy test up to 5 days before her missed period. And yes she can get pregnant if you precome inside her.|`|Ltx89w04aa	You usually take a pregnancy test the first day after a missed period.  I would wait another couple of weeks or so before doing the test.  If it comes back negative and you want to be sure, you can always retest two weeks after the first.<br>  <br>  AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, USE A CONDOM.  It sounds like the two of you aren't necessarily ready for kids, and the ONLY way to prevent that is BIRTH CONTROL - condoms, the pill, etc.  If she's not on the pill, the I don't care how much better it feels without a condom, WEAR ONE.  Pulling out doesn't help squat - you "leak" millions of sperm before you ever ejaculate.  "A little dab will do ya" is an appropriate phrase here - it only takes one determined little squiggly to get your girlfriend pregnant.  YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.<br>  <br>  Be responsible, use protection!<br>  <br>  P.S. DOUCHING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.  In fact, douching can cause infections in the vagina and doesn't stop pregnancy whatsoever, I don't know where people get that idea.|`|n3Exo1raaa	I would wait 2-3 more weeks and take the test (get a two pack) then wait like a month and take the second one<br>  just me, no scientific basis really|`|dPi7zMxWaa	3 days if she doesn't douche.|`|UBSg41yNaa	Ovulation that is the process of release of egg (from the woman) occurs roughly around the 14-15th day of the first day of your period.  For the first few years after menstruation begins, longer cycles are common. A woman's cycle tends to shorten and become more regular with age. Most of the time, periods will be in the range of 21 to 45 days apart.  Conception that is fertilizing of sperm with egg can occur anytime from 2 days before ovulation to 3 days after.  Since sperms from ejaculation or precum can stay alive in the body for upto 2-3 days sometimes upto a week but thats a stretch.  Since you say your gf has irregular periods, you have no track of her ovulation day - by basal temp or ovulation kits; you will have to wait till at least 4 days before her next period for even the most expensive home preg test to say with any certainty if she is preg.  Again given the irregular MC.....  <br>  <br>  I do not know if you and your gf are trying to conceive, if you are not pls use a birthcontrol method.  you can of course go to her doctor and ask if they can still prescribe the morning after pill and educate you both on bc methods.  If you are trying to conceive...we all have had to play the wait and watch game :).  Hope this helps.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	You can't count from when you had sex, cuz it's impossible to know when you would have conceived. Your girlfriend needs to miss a period or get symptoms first. Then she could try calculating 6 weeks from the first day of her last period and test. This could give a good result, but because she's irregular, it could be hard. She'll have to listen to her body. If all else fails, go to a doctor and get a blood test.|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	If you had sex the day after her period, you'd need to wait at least another 3 weeks, depending on how long her periods usually last.  I'd wait 4 weeks just to be sure.|`|9Y7t1Xwtaa	immediately after sex the baby is there in a small way so your pregnant.

If you were smart, you would wait.|`|yNoENquTaa	since you are so young i would seriously recommend you start using birth control immediately. your boyfriends and your lifestyle will take great affect on any possible children. this could be stopping you from conceiving. i think you should do to the doctor and explain your concerns. if you do fall pregnant the drugs, smoking and alcohol will make it more possible for your baby to have deformities, low birth weight, for you to miscarry or deliver prematurely. so if you don't want that to happen i suggest you prevent it with a couple of different contraceptives like condoms and the pill.<br>  best of luck.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Everyone is different, some people can fall pregnant in a month, for others it can take years.<br>  <br>  You have a 25% chance of falling pregnant each month, a healthy couple usually takes about 9-12months to conceive, that's statistics though so it's different for everyone.<br>  <br>  Smoking, drinking and cannabis can all stop the process of getting pregnant too.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about STI's then get yourself tested for them, a simple blood test and swab from the doctors, clinic or planned parenthood or something like that can tell you if you have anything.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	I think that somebody up there is looking out for you pregnancy is a very big deal it's expensive and your still at school don't you want a good job? <br>  <br>  The reason I think that somebody is looking out for you is because if your boyfriend and you smoke then I wouldn't think your baby would be very healthy, before you try to get your-self try ringing NHS direct if you are in UK and they will help you quit smoking because if you want a healthy baby then neither of you should smoke.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped you out.xxx :)|`|jiTKnCKpaa	You could just be lucky, you can go to your doctor or family planning clinic to get checked for an STI  if you are concerned, some people try for a year before they get pregnant it doesn't mean theres anything wrong, but you could always go get checked if you want chlamydia can cause infertility so it is best to get checked for STI.|`|aI4wgxRFaa	Why do you want to be a mother?

HclKftzAaa	I was diagnosed with PCOS in April 08. I was put on metformin and told to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I lost 10kgs over 3 months, and took the metformin this whole time. The doc was going to give me clomid, but the provera he gave me failed to start my period because i was already pregnant! :D So just the weight loss and metformin were enough for me.<br>  <br>  I am due on April 11th! :D It took me a total of 2 yrs to get pregnant- but only 3-4 months after i was diagnosed with PCOS and treated appropriately. Best thing that ever happened was finding out i had PCOS, now i can adjust my diet/lifestyle etc to manage this condition and live a healthier life.
vDdHmLk7aa	You are in the exact same situation as me...funny to know that somewhere in the world you were having the same frustrations as me last night!!<br>  My son is the same...just WILL NOT burp at night. Then he will wake up every hour, grunting and writhing with gas. He will fart and fart but still be uncomfortable. I have tried infant Mylicon in his bottle and it doesn't help at all. So...I put him over my shoulder, patting his back, and he falls asleep and then I fall asleep with him that way. Basically the whole night he sleeps on me, and that's the only way I get any sleep. If you can find a solution, please let me know, but otherwise all I can think is...hopefully this will pass. Good luck, and remember...someone out there (me) is going through the exact same thing!!!!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	my baby had that i used to lay him down on the bed and pick and push his legs towards his stomach it helped|`|GKVZyHCHaa	I asked my health visitor about this because my 8 week old daughter is exactly the same.  Apparently because they're so sleepy during night feeds and therefore relaxed they take down very little, if any air.  Are you definitely sure she has gas that is causing her to wake up again later?  I thought that was the case with my little one but really she had just dropped her dummy and woken up looking for it!|`|uTIoOa62aa	aw

I think shes in my contact list actually.|`|2bcZbaQQaa	I don't know any girl name Toni, but there is a singer name Toni Braxton<br>  <br>  Did I spell her last name right?|`|MgE0hijraa	Yes, a close friend's mom.

She is a very successful business woman. Toni is a very nice, caring woman.|`|lhxe2XOeaa	i kno an antionette but no ones calls her that and shes athelitic and funny but likes guys to much|`|KlpDRTbKaa	no but it sounds like pretty name|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	yes i do and she was a very nice girl!|`|AA11138222	Yes, her real name is Antoinette.
8bUKN0vNaa	Like trying to poo a large house complete with veranda and patio furniture.  Painful, but you have something beautiful in the end :)|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	Its so different for everyone, however in my experience its amazing, painful but amazing. The contractions are so strong towards the end that its hard to catch your breath, but gas and air is fantastic and a definite must as far as i am concerned. Pushing is completely exhausting, but you only really notice this when its all over as you are concentrating so much at the time. When you get your baby, nothing else matters.|`|UdICTUnaaa	the labor part sucks,but the pain goes away fast, as someone else said... the epidural part is the greatest... total relief... do not regret it at all|`|3BB8Gn0taa	For me it felt like a huge intensified orgasm. Seriously. No joke.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Painful but wonderful. A great bonding experience with your partner.|`|xSfgrdFJaa	its lovely. the pain goes very quickly when you get your child, but it is like being burnt with a lighter before that!!!!|`|kWXik6phaa	like pushing a watermelon through a garden hose|`|Xl4o7tRqaa	pooping a watermellon|`|RdgzULeUaa	I was there when my best friend gave birth.  They gave her drugs but she seemed like she was in so much pain.  When the baby was coming out she pooed a little but that's normal especially if you break the rules and eat lol.  But after she delivered I asked if she remember any of the pain and she didn't.  Every minute or so she was screaming so it surprised me that she didn't remember all that well.  Also she was cussing alot.  She didn't remember that either.  I would assume it hurts like a mother but somehow you put the pain aside and get it over with.|`|LMNHj66baa	the most wonderfully painful experience. every time is so different. you can't really describe childbirth, only your experience. to every women it's different. i've had hard, EASY, and feeling like i had a bowel impaction. i've been ok with the pain, i've passed out from it, and i've gone crazy with it. birth is an experience you can't really describe, it's one you must go threw to understand. that said i would say it's like pushing a cantaloupe out a straw.|`|oLj0VTX5aa	As a fashion statement! It really depends on who you are explaining it to - little kids need less details, and older kids will have tons of questions.  The important point is to have the facts, avoid misinformation like "the baby is in mommy's stomach and then it comes out," because kids will wonder if you ate something, etc., and be honest.  Kids are not stupid.  There are tons of books for talking to children about babies, like "Where did I come from?" <br>  <br>  Personally, I would tell the truth and use simpler terms - the baby is inside the uterus where it grew, and when it is ready it will come out of the vagina.|`|UseJjREjaa	Ha I always tell my husband to imagine peeing out a softball!<br>  <br>  That gets him everytime<br>  <br>  ADD:  why did i get a thumbs down?  I didn't mean it was like a softball for ME.. It was like a watermelon for me... Ha..<br>  But for HIM it would be like a softball.. Ya know cause the hole is smaller.. LOL|`|j6RbKNmjaa	This song will help you <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM2CORdyv8k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM2CORdyv...</a>|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Like trying to poo a pumpkin!|`|1jwbQaZTaa	something the size of a watermelon coming out of something the size of a lemon.<br>  <br>  its to hell and back out of body experience that ends with a peaceful, serene feeling that you can never explain.|`|T1ffrjHAaa	I asked my sister, she said AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... !!!!!!!!!|`|KHhRgzXtaa	it hurts more than u could ever imagine,,, i thought i was gonna die dammit xxxxxx|`|2OO9U8o9aa	It depends who I was explaining it to !!
6ri7AYC1aa	Be creative.<br>  Plan some fun arts and crafts activities.<br>  Have a tea party with her<br>  Bake something with her like cookies.<br>  Play dress up<br>  Remember that 3 year olds have active imaginations, so take advantage of that.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i baby-sitt a 3 year old... i take her to the park chuckie cheese... coloring teaching counting abc's reading stories....watching movies cooking (simple things)... i can't think of anything else right now i also have a one year old daughter so they pretty much occupy each other most of the time...|`|QfYGhtVwaa	dress up, decorate biscuits, water play, cuddles tea party, park, etc etc. Good luck!|`|sB5dyaczaa	Barbies and movies. Also you can go to the toy store and get a My little Pony.
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Not many twelve years are having sex, but the ones that are sexually active are probably trying to make themselves seem more mature and want to "fit in" with everyone else.<br>  <br>  And you're not a freak. I'm almost 15 as well and I haven't even dated anyone yet. I think we're the more mature ones, honestly. :) At least we don't have to worry about getting pregnant.|`|brvOa9QYaa	Are you a freak? of course your not. <br>  at 12, Id never even considered sex. Im coming 16 and with my boyfriend for 9 months but still not ready or in a hurry. <br>  some people i guess are quicker developed or just in a rush. <br>  Your appearence has nothing to do with it, I'm not gorgeous but I have a boyfriend, but last year i was single for ages. It happens.<br>  Way to go to the person who called her a freak! asshole|`|0hxK0khKaa	Lol, I'm 12.<br>  <br>  1) Because, they think they're ready for it. They aren't, and... Wow. I can't imagine having sex, not till I'm like 18 and have a boyfriend.<br>  2) No. The only kiss I've ever had was a kiss on a cheek when I was 8.|`|N1LYWbHFaa	1. 12 year olds do this because they are stupid and don't know how to act.<br>  2. im 15 and i never had a bf before, and never kissed a guy because im shy<br>  <br>  <br>  don't think you're ugly.Be happy about yourself!<br>   Don't listen to those young boys they have dumb minds.|`|3Z5M5GSqaa	1. Because we have officially run out of toys.<br>  2. no you are not. You are smart and you will become successful. Stay in school, focus on your studies and you'll find a perfect match when you are ready.<br>  <br>  no you are not a freak and dont listen to those boys. You are not ugly because everyone is beautiful in their own unique way.<br>  <br>  ~ Jenna|`|c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	No it just shows you have common sense.  Don't allow yourself to be pressured into things.  As to why 12 year olds are doing this, I think many do it because of lack of self esteem or control over ones hormone's.|`|Z4B93N31aa	you are way normal <br>  shes stupid dont be like her<br>  dont have sex til you are ready for it you dont have to wait til you are married just til you know thats the right boy (:<br>  wait til high school it will get better trust me|`|AA11296427	You're the normal one, go you!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Because they're stupid.<br>  Dont worry they will regret it in the future.|`|aYcdbSiDaa	They are stupid.<br>  And no you are normal :)<br>  I didnt have my first kiss until I was 15, two months shy of my 16th birthday.|`|VAavSoE3aa	they're freaks|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Because they have no self respect and haven't got a very good education. They are screwing themselves up and will regret it later on.<br>  <br>  Its ridiculous. They will turn into sluts and mess their whole lives up.<br>  <br>  What a shame for them, but its their choice to be that way.<br>  <br>  And if you're a freak, then I must be one too haaha but we're not, we're sensible and we're gonna have a great life :) <br>  <br>  Anyway I haven't had my first kiss yet either. But guys do like me so I'm grateful for that :) I'm sure guys like you too.|`|Jp5sAxwnaa	1. Blame today's MTV culture. Teen sex has always existed, but today it's worse than ever.<br>  2. No, you're normal, infact I'll go as far to say that 10 year olds shouldn't date (unless by "date" you mean something like play arcade games at the amusement park together)|`|Go50UlKgaa	I didnt have my first kiss until I was 14<br>  You're normal!!!<br>  Dont worry<br>  Im 15 too and Im not having sex<br>  I realized that I wanted to wait for ''the one'' when I went out with this boy and when I broke up with him realized how repulsive he was<br>  Thats scary<br>  When I was 12 I was still playing with Barbies|`|XpWjdPg2aa	All of those kids want to fit in with the people in the shows they see... things like Gossip Girl, which are really intended for older teens. Don't worry - you're the normal one. I didn't have my first kiss until I was 14 and a half. It's not all it's cracked up to be anyway.|`|lWeBTk16aa	Our society is degrading, and virginity is now seen as a burden, and not thought of as a important. I, when I was 9, heard a 10 year old talking about when she lost her virginity.|`|JPeNM8nsaa	1) Because parents are okay with their children watchin mtv instead of barney<br>  2) No your not|`|AA11564277	because everyone is doing it. i never would, not until i am at least 18, but yeah, it's best to let it all play out.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	YOU ARE THE GOOD CHILD! DONT DOUBT YOURSELF!!! GO YOU!!!<br>   SOME GIRLS ARE JUST PLAIN IDIOTS AND HAVE NOTHING BETTER IN LIFE.|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	Because they lack common sense.  I'm 18 and I've never had a boyfriend, and the only people I've ever kissed are my parents and my cats.|`|Qhyovyj8aa	1. Because they're stupid & they want to feel loved or feel grown up.<br>  2. No, it just means you're smart ;D|`|FkB3jQzWaa	your fine. they do this becuz they want attention and becuz they know they are sluts so they might as well act like one.|`|OpMS8Gwcaa	1. Why are twelve year olds doing this? I don't know. I think about that all the time. Kids aren't kids today. They act older than they are, and it's sad. A lot of things promote sex unintentionally (or intentionally, how should I know), and it sends messages (such as the media).<br>  2. You are not a freak. I'm 17. I haven't had my first kiss yet either. I have had one boyfriend, and I was 16. You don't need to worry. It's not about how old you are, it's about when you're ready. You should wait for the right person to come around, and not base your feelings and decisions on what your friends are doing.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped.|`|sjlQj4ihaa	I know it's so sad to think about. These girls are going to regret not waiting for love. They're to young to understand the gravity of sex or how to stay to sta safe. It's a  shame.<br>  But about you, no of course you're not a freak for not having kissed a guy! Don't ever feel that way! I didn't have my first kiss until I was almost 17 and I have friends older than me (I'm 17) who haven't had boyfriends yet. It's a lot more common than you think, trust me. Hey at least you're not a 12 year old having sex...|`|SKJb6eLKaa	Because they feel like it :P<br>  Honestly, that's the truth.<br>  At 12 they may think they're ready.. I've never met somebody who was 12 and didn't regret it..<br>  I know 13 year olds who lost it and didn't regret it though. So it can't be too much of a difference.<br>  <br>  I hope she is using protection!<br>  <br>  Theres nothing wrong with you!<br>  Why woudl you think that?<br>  Some people are ready at different ages and theres nothing to be ashamed about about that.. At all!<br>  <br>  I've only had one boyfriend too, I'm 16 but we've been dating since we were 11 ( I know, you know and everybody knows those cute little puppy luvs..:P) He's the only guy Ive kissed or had sex with..<br>  <br>  Your time will come and when it does, I hope you are educated enough to know to be smart and protect yourself :)|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Because they are either being pressured into doing it, or they are just THAT stupid. They'll pay for it in the long run.. they'll end up pregnant or with STDs. <br>  <br>  As for you... you are NOT a freak. You are finally a teenager who is thinking clearly.

But something did come out of it, it showed how much  my friends loved me 'cause they kept yelling at him, and saying he was a jerk, and a loser, and he didn't deserve to be with me.<br>  It was rather funny, actually. <br>  <br>  The day before my ex broke up with me, he kept telling me he loved me, and kissed and hugged me a lot. Basically, was really affectionate. Weird, huh? Well, at least he never talked about things like having sex...<br>  <br>  Just remember, you're better than him, if all he wanted was sex. He wasn't that nice guy or Prince Charming you thought him to be. Life moves on. Music and friends really helped. <br>  <br>  Songs:<br>  All Again For You by We The Kings<br>  It's Not Over by Secondhand Serenade<br>  Over You by Chris Daughtry<br>  We Are Broken by Paramore<br>  Never Let This Go by Paramore<br>  Slipped Away by Avril Lavigne<br>  <br>  Friends:<br>  Shopping<br>  Movies<br>  Sleep over<br>  [whatever else you like to do]|`|VAavSoE3aa	he's a B i T CH.<br>  <br>  soooo not worth being hurt over(:<br>  <br>  you're way better than that i can already tell, you also can get someone much better(:|`|AusPef8Yaa	I'd feel so hurt.

Let's say you gave in (thank God you didn't)  and let's just say for the sake of argument that you got pregnant, most of them are not gonna stick around to find out whether to buy pink or blue booties.<br>  <br>  Sex is a great way to bore a guy, they will swear up and down that they love love love you and then bada boom bada bing, bye bye.|`|01vMpHkWaa	im 16................<br>  <br>  and i didnt read it all..sorry its long. <br>  <br>  but after i read "he told my friend to tell me"<br>  <br>  i knew what i would of done<br>  <br>  FORGET HIM<br>  <br>  he is a loser and cant man up to break the news to you himself? no need to waste your mind on him..hes a little boy<br>  <br>  i know it hurts..as i have had this happen many times...but watch, by next week..IT WILL BE NOTHING! a thing of the past..<br>  <br>  just watch. you will see
qBFojHLMaa	wow! Is that her? Or total coincidence?? Thats kinda funny sorry!!<br>  If you arent proposing just bc shes pregnant then sit her down and tell her that. Make sure its clear.

Talking to her :)|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Do you know for sure its her?<br>  <br>  Awe that's sad. Do you feel you made a mistake? Probably not. If I saw that I would feel so bad.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry. You need to talk to her about this ASAP. Maybe you both aren't just ready yet. Wait a bit 17 is young.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Tell HER, not us.|`|oMveOFi9aa	got to her. answer her question that you found!! tell her you really love her and didnt just ask her because shes pregnant. tell her you wouldnt have had sex wiht her if you didnt love her, which i bet is true, and hope is true. pour your heart out to her, and even if she still needs to think about it, let her. because shes probably confused and needs a little space right now.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Give her time. Marriage is HARD. Just stay in there with her. Keep showing you love her, when she is ready, she'll let you know.  And yes, I did read the question.

Tu7Ec3tDaa	well, is he's one of those people who are head strong on whatever they say, it might be a long shot, but maybe you shouldn't yell at her about the bad things she does... you can let her know about them, like say "mom?.. i don't really think you should be drinking too much of that stuff right now" or just simply "Don't drink too much of that stuff.."... you know? don't get upset with her, it might not be her fault..<br>  <br>  cause sometimes it's really hard for a person to change in ways such as that... it probably would take a while, but i think your mom could definitely do it..|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Talk to her when shes not drinking, tell her that when she drinks, her mood changes and nasty words come out and it hurts you, tell her you love her and for u to hear this from her hurts a lot...i mean i was never in the situation that you are, but talk to her and talk to your dad, tell him its making you feel really bad and that you want her to stop good luck|`|aYcdbSiDaa	Ignore it. <br>  Try to find something else to do that you enjoy tonight so you dont have to deal with her. <br>  Be mature about it instead of getting all annoyed. <br>  Just relax and find something entertaining.|`|AA11296427	Come on, two glasses is not a lot.

Jeez, what do you intend to do to David R? LOL. Nonetheless, it sounds like your mom is not setting the best example for you, but we are only hearing your side of the story. It certainly doesn't sound like your mom is an alcoholic or anything like that, so you need to relax and let her enjoy a glass or two of wine. As far as her "yelling" at you, moms and 12-year-old girls seem to live in a constant state of yelling and bickering. You need to be a little more respectful, and calling her a jerk is not acceptable and I hope you do not say that to her (in my home you would find yourself on the receiving end of a spanking if you did). Just relax and when you have the chance, tell her calmly how her words hurt sometimes. I am sure you say hurtful things to her and you both need to resolve to not do it anymore.|`|jzx1ey4Vaa	Well, if she is drinking 2 glasses of wine (enough to be drunk) every night or all of the time, that could be the sign of a problem and might need to be addressed. As for her being crabby, maybe she has a lot of things going on in her own life that you don't know about, people often take their frustration out on those closest to them.

dPxcoeP0aa	i think you should try a new schedule. a little earlier, probably after his bath. (thats always the best time) maybe put him to bed a little earlier, and also try putting him to bed, and let him fall asleep on his own.|`|52cc7aea6be5f841604eaa406ced87e2aa	It very well could be teething and you need to help him ease the pain. The reason he only wants you is because he is in pain. Have you tried feeling his gums for nubs. Does he gnaw on things or drool a lot. I have heard of beef jerky to chew on really helps babies but do not leave your child unsupervised as he could choke on a small piece. You could also try those Humphrey's pellet things but not as a regular routine. See if likes teething rings. Or maybe a popsicle. Sounds like the poor dude is in pain and wants mama to take it away.|`|YG288fG4aa	Try patting him to sleep while he is in his bed. If this doesnt work im sure he will grow out of it soon maybe it is just a phase.|`|QRl8oUzqaa	i have an 18month little girl.  and she is the same with me. it is soooo very hard but sometime i have to just put her in her crib and let her cry it out. as long as she fed bathed and has a clean diaper, i know she will be okay. its very hard to hear the crying. but she will eventually go to sleep.  you should try to lay him in his crib. put on somethin like a radio or tv to make noise (make sure its nothin exciting). i use a fish tank in my daughters room.  it makes a soft noise but is soothing.  it might be hard at first cuase he might be use to someone always being there when he crys. but if you stick to the same thing and dont go in the room if just may work.  if he crys for more thank 15 - 30 min of course i would go get him.  when my little girl crys it kills me. it breaks my heart.    try it may work.  or call you doc and see what they have to offer.  good luck!!!!!!!!
LMNHj66baa	good question.as you know everything is ok to do until something happens and we find out its bad. like bpa in baby bottles. if you have doubts go with an hypoallergenic makeup, at least for foundation. no question is a stupid question when it comes to the health of an innocent baby.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course. :) I think you may have known that before you asked just a little.

Ka52nbhNaa	With twins, I was thankful for whatever we received . . . even hand-me-downs!  As to what was most useful, gift cards!!!  The gift cards were great!  The problem with cash is that it is so easy to blow it on something else - like groceries (I know you need them but it is not "really" for the baby as much) . . . the gift cards are great for the things that you did not receive at your shower, what you suddenly realize that you need etc . . . <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|VCCKfT3taa	First of all: Order on the Internet! Just google the item you want, or check out Target.com or Walmart.com. Usually you can find deals on the internet that you wouldn't find at the stores too!<br>  <br>  No matter what the age, most first times moms need the same thing; clothes, diapers, bibs, socks, burp clothes, a crib and/or bassinet, a good Graco swing, a bouncer seat with soothing vibration feature, a baby moniter if they have a big house, a good carseat, at least 3 good baby blankets, plus receiving blankets to swaddle the baby in. <br>  <br>  If you're strapped for cash a really thoughtful thing to do is get a handful of sort of cheap things and dress them all in a nice basket. Put a little stuffed bear in there as well. I got a few of those kind of baskets at my baby shower and I LOVED them!<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it's better to get practical gifts than gift cards or money. Get them something they can use, don't get them an errand to run. ^_^|`|1cdfec2697940a7924276a038673bb29aa	i remember also getting the same gifts pretty annoying I had to exchange a bunch of items pretty annoying!!! But maybe you should ask her what she wants or maybe she has a list somewhere. but I would say cash and maybe a few small items or a gift card.|`|si770wyhaa	I'd definantly rather have gift cards. Honestly, I don't need any more clothes for the baby, because this is my first and I went crazy buying all the cute little boy clothes I saw =] I know a lot of people give blankets, you could do that. I alreayd have lots of blankets for hm too, but that's because my husband and I thought it important to get lots of those. Diapers are always a wonderful idea, because the baby goes through so many of them!!! You can never really have enough!!! Also you could get somethign for the mom to be. Maybe just get some bubble bath/bath salts for her and some diapers and wipes [another thing you can never have enough of] for the baby. I'm sure she'd appreciate that! But gift cards and cash are always wonderful. And now days a lot of places like Amazon.com will let you give online gift certificates so the mom to be could order stuff on line to be shipped to her. One really great idea is to get the mom to be a journel and some really nice pens. In the front write a note to the baby telling them all the things you wish for it. Tell the mother to be to do that as well, and to do it often. Make new lists of what she wants for the baby, tell her to record all her hopes, dreams, and wishes for this little one and encourage her to allow friends and family to do the same. The baby will oneday really cherish that!  Good Luck, Hope this helps.|`|hc1fsgDWaa	I would not go with the cash or gift card because once she has the baby she will not have the time or energy to go shopping.  I think that the point of giving a shower is to supply the mom to be with the things that she will need when the baby arrives.  The best gifts are things that are useful and that are needed.  I always try to think of the things that I found very useful when my kids were infants.  A new mom can never have too many diapers or wipes.  Maybe give different sizes of diapers that he/she will be able to grow into.  I sometimes give a small laundry basket (for the babys laundry) and fill it with baby detergent and a few small towels and other baby bathing needs (tearless soap and shampoo, nail clippers, diaper cream, onesies, etc)  These things may not be as "fun" as buying all of the cute little clothes, but they are much more practicle and she probably won't get duplicates.<br>  Good Luck!|`|955YoHvVaa	I loved all the diapers we got at my daughters baby shower..but you can also just get a gift card and let the mother decide..really you can not go wrong with anything you said..I wouldn't give cash though.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	At my baby shower for my son, I had someone give me a card with a note telling me to let them know what I did not get at either of my showers that I really needed. There is ALWAYS something that you don't get, and have to go buy. That was the nicest gift! I Don't even remember what it was she ended up getting me anymore! (LOL my mind is shot now.)<br>  If you can't find what you want to get at your grocery or drug store, you can always order online. you can even have it giftwrapled, and delivered right to the mommy to be!
a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	Babies get little red bumps in weird places all the time. If you notice more start to pop up then you might try changing her laundry soap to something very mild. If the bump is under the skin like a knot then I would tak her to the dr. Like i said if its a red little bump it happens all the time just make sure you keep her clean and don't use any harsh soaps on her or her clothes.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u need to have it checked by her doc.....only way to be sure and safe...|`|tivpa7Vlaa	sometimes babies get a hernia around the belly button area not sure how it happens i remember something about pushing or hard crying can cause it but not sure. have the pediatrician check it out....i think you should make an emergency appointment..better safe than sorry|`|gC98RlU3aa	ask her pediatrician
PBI3tCKaaa	Their has got to be a manual.  Apple?  Suri?  Zuma?  Are you kidding me?|`|RXNyifIwaa	haha probably. it would explain so much...<br>  like sunday rose......and all those other names.................<br>  <br>  what will happen in the future? anyone with a weird random name will probably be mistaken as a child of a celebrity........lol|`|YGac7SAFaa	you would think there would be a manual, but the celebs just give their kids crazy names to get attention|`|AA11138222	I think they just figure that even if their child gets made fun of at school they can say "my mommy is so and so" and the kids will instantly like them.|`|CdGOuEmpaa	celebs give their kids different names because they don't want their kid to have 2 million other hannahs saying, oh, so and so named their kid after me! or if they meet a fan with that name, they don't want to think of that person everytime they think of their kid! besides, i bet all of ur names were considered weird when u were born, and now they're normal!! so just shut up!! my favorite (least weird ones) are Suri and Sunday rose!! and both those girls are cute too!!!
w5kQ98Fxaa	Try to be understanding of your mom's point of view - you're pulling away from something she's scared to let go of because it's what everybody does and what everybody does is surely right, isn't it? Write her a letter explaining what you've said in this question, and give her all the leaflets/information/everything about these online classes - can you log in without being enrolled just to show her what it's like? Ask a guidence councillor to give you a temporary password or print out some examples or something for you to show her.<br>  <br>  Keep your dad onside and ask if he could maybe talk to her? Explain you think it's a better way of learning for you..<br>  <br>  Google Unschooling resources.. Joyfully Rejoycing and Sandie Dodds are great sources and although unschooling is totally not what you're looking to do, they have some great essays and Q&As floating around explaining the benefits of learning at home at your own pace rather than in an environment which is tailored for every kid instead of each kid.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I was going to do online school until I had a lapse and had to drop out entirely.. I'm in college now (I'm in the UK so that's my last two years of regular schooling - junior and senior year) doing a vocational (hands on, no classrooms) course and it rocks.|`|RjJMV20taa	home schooled kids are messed up everyone that I have known is a recluse and has a problem adapting to the real world|`|5ulr9xLQaa	Instead of being home schooled why don't you ask your counselor if you can be approved to take college courses.  I did that and when my classmates were in their senior year I was a sophomore in College, I graduated one year early and took college classes in the summers.  <br>  <br>  If you do the college thing, you will be challenged and you will get ahead.  You will still have to sit in school and do boring homework but when you are in the college classes you will have so much fun.  The home schooling thing is good but if you are truly gifted then you will get so far ahead by starting college early.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Did you tell her that you doodle all day and don't learn anything?  Could you have your friends who already do it come over and tell her what it's like and why it's better?  <br>  <br>  I don't know what else you could do...|`|4854FMZjaa	Hey Alicia, Waking up early is Good for a Person, U'll understan it later in your life. If u want to be Successful u need to do some Sacrifices. Time is a thing that u can't retrieve, once its past its PAST, u can't go back and change it. So think about it and take a decision.
E7ViD8EWaa	That sounds rather awkward. XD<br>  <br>  According to wikipedia, it is a little metal thingy that goes in your uterus and keeps you from getting pregnant. I don't really get the rest of it, but here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterin...</a><br>  <br>  I think that's very responsible of you! =]<br>  <br>  No, I haven't had "The Talk" with either of my parents, they are rather distant...One of my nannies told me all about it when I was ten. She was very *cough* graphic.  <br>  <br>  =]|`|2tn8EALqaa	What I wonder is why you don't ask your mom?? In your real life home.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	I don't know what the coil is.  I have never had the talk with my parents, probably never will either.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	I'm 16. Never heard of the coil.<br>  <br>  but it is a good idea to get on the pill, and use condoms.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Ask her in the morning :)|`|wztEAVm2aa	i did not.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i dont know what the coil is, so i can't help you there, but i would check to make sure it won't clash with the pill. I think using many forms of contrceptives is a good idea, there are so many people with stories of the condom breaking or falling pregnant on the pill, backing either up with a second barrier is always a good idea!! especially condoms because they can protect from STD's and i would use them at all times regardless!|`|sjlQj4ihaa	Try googling it. But what ever it is you won't need it. If you have the pill and use a condom, you'll be fine. It doesn't sound like a ood idea to have insertable birthcontrol and the pill, I would ask a doctor about the health risks there.|`|OpMS8Gwcaa	Alright, well I did a little research, because I didn't know what a coil was either. I didn't realize it was another word for an IUD. So:<br>  <br>  What is an IUD like?<br>  <br>  It’s very small – not much longer than a matchstick. Indeed, any IUD could comfortably sit in the palm of your hand. <br>  <br>  Your womb (uterus) is actually about the size of your clenched fist. So if you close your hand round a matchstick, you’ll have a rough idea of how an IUD sits inside your womb.<br>  <br>  As I’ve just said, most IUDs are now T shaped. They’re made of plastic and copper, sometimes with a little silver inside. (But the silver is of no real financial value – so it’s not worth saving your old IUDs.) <br>  <br>  All IUDs have either one or two little threads that hang down a short distance into your vagina. These are useful when you (or a doctor or nurse) are checking to see that the device is still in place. <br>  <br>  Also, most importantly, the threads are used when it’s time to remove the IUD; the nurse or doctor just grasp a thread with a surgical ‘clip’ and pull the device out. <br>  <br>  How do IUDs work?<br>  <br>  They sit in your womb and prevent you from getting pregnant. They do this in three main ways:<br>  <br>  <br>  they prevent your partner’s sperm from getting through your womb and into your tubes<br>  <br>  <br>  they alter the secretions (mucus) in your cervix, creating a further barrier for sperm<br>  <br>  <br>  they affect your womb lining – making it less likely to ‘accept’ an egg.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pretty well all family planning doctors and nurses say that the IUD does not work by ‘causing an abortion', as some people have alleged. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I had this talk with my mother when I was starting the 4th grade. It was very awkward, because to me, it felt like everything I had ever thought was a lie. Of course, it didnt' help that they did the Santa Clause talk with me in the same week....<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't have a coil. I'm not too eager to stick pieces of anything up there, honestly, but I think it sounds like a good thing to have. My parents don't insist upon it a)because I'm pretty sure they trust me not to do anything irresponsible and b)I'm already on birth control (not because I have sex, because i dont, but for a medical reason).<br>  <br>  I think it sounds smart of use a coil and a condom, but I don't know about using coils, the pill, and a condom. I think the pill and coil might cause complications when used together, but i'm no doctor, so don't take my word for it. It just makes sense to me that the hormones would be too much or interfere with each other.<br>  <br>  <br>  And it's good that you're going to be prepared, because you never know what's going to happen. Just because you don't plan on it happening doesn't mean it won't. People get caught in the moment.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and stay safe. :)
HclKftzAaa	I learned SO much from my classes. The doctors never have enough time to talk to you about things- particularly about the different types of pain relief ect.<br>  <br>  Also, seeing the birthing and maternity units made me SO excited about having the baby. It takes away a lot of the fear if you can know as much as possible about the processes you are going to go through. Our classes cost us $150 for 4 x 3 hours sessions, so you are getting off lightly if they're only $50 for you!<br>  <br>  You will also get a chance to talk to other pregnant women, and I found that bit very comforting also. :)<br>  <br>  But even if you don't go, the baby will still come out eventually.|`|ROJans2Taa	I never went, I find the nurses give you all the support and advice you need while in labor, if you'd feel more comfortable then I say go right ahead, whatever to better prepare yourself, I just personally found it was fine without. best luck|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I think it would be good to go so that you can educate yourself and know what to expect.  You might learn something very important ^-^  and it'll help ease the scary emotions that can come up during childbirth.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	It didn't make one bit of difference for me. If I were you, I'd save your money and read up on some relaxation techniques on the internet. And those might not help, either, depending on how painful your labor is.|`|GjuRYsITaa	i went to 1 with my first found it totally boring and didn't go back ive been fine ive had 4 kids now on num5|`|AA11538461	You are actually late to start classes.  I started practicing when I was 20 weeks or so.  There is so much to learn.  I'm afraid this hospital class is all about telling you their routine procedures and trying to sell you on them so you will go along with their routine.  <br>  The Bradley method of natural childbirth did help me tremendously.  Your body does not know what to do naturally in labor. The Bradley method taught me how to relax and not fight the contractions.  Over 90% of those who use the Bradley method do not need pain medication and their c-sec rate is only 5%.  I doubt the statistics of those who attend this hospital class and those who don't are very different from each other.  <br>  With the Bradley method, you are even allowed to eat during labor.  Some women who have a long labor can get too weak from lack of food and need a c-sec if they don't eat.|`|fQGzk5izaa	We didn't do it and everything was fine.  The only class I took was the breastfeeding class and I found that really helpful.  As for the others, if you don't feel like it don't do it.  Nothing goes the way they say it will in the delivery room anyway.  So I can't answer if the classes help, but I can say it didn't NOT help me by not taking them.|`|SoRLHQeRaa	Mine was free (UK) it did help cos I could picture the rooms etc but to be honest if I'd have had to pay for it I probably wouldn't have gone. x Good luck with your baby x x|`|wKuQC4yTaa	No, it is good take but all the info they go over you can find online.|`|Ir3XPq4raa	No its not necessary but it can be helpful!!!|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	I wouldn't go.  I had a child and from my experience with having that baby there is no class that can prepare you because you don't know what kind of labor you will have. At 35 weeks pregnant the last thing you want to do is sit in a hospital for 6 hours and hear about the child birth that is impending, you are likely to panic.  No childbirth or pregnancy is the same and they will speak in general terms and its been my experience that people use no tact when it comes to telling pregnant women horror stories or complication stories...there is no need to take a tour of the birthing center, honestly, when you go into labor your not going to care...the real heroes are the labor and delivery nurses, they will keep you calm adn relaxed, they take amazing care of you.  Also, whoever you choose to be int eh deliver room with you will be an amazing support system.  Whatever relaxation technique you learn in this class will escape your mind when your in labor and if someone attempts to remind you, they might get smacked!  I'm not trying to tell you a horror story, all i'm saying is when your in labor you could give a sh*& about what they will teach you in this course, trust me.  Are you getting an epidural?  You really wont care at that point.  Honestly, at this stage in pregnancy spend your time preparing for baby and getting much needed sleep, whatever happens in that delivery room is going to happen and you have to trust you are in the hands of professionals, also you are programmed to be strong, we are women..it's just in us to relax, it won't feel like it at the time but you don't need a class, you will be just fine, congratulations!  I know how miserable it is to be 35 wks along, I would give anything to be that far along right now, I'm 7 wks and sitting at home on bed rest not knowing if i'm miscarrying or not, it's maddening.  Good luck to you mamma, you are going to be a wonderful mother and you will surprise yourself in teh delivery room, you will have strength that you never knew you had. one more thing...along with all those women who tell the horror stories, your going to encounter the women who push their stories of natural childbirth in your face...you don't need to be superwomen in teh delivery room, remember that.  Also, breastfeeding is great in theory but it doesn't always work for some woman so don't let women push that down your throat either.  Remember, every pregnancy, every woman, every labor and every baby is unique...so at this point unless its someone you love and trust just shrug off the many unasked for opinions you will recieve.  <br>  Congratulations again.|`|c62a95c6696d81427b76aa335ba9d509aa	Really it all depends on what type of person you are, if you are someone who likes to know everything you can about something before you do it then I would suggest going. That way you will learn about the medicine and any other procedures they do at that hospital and you will also get to see where you will be having your baby. But you can learn all you need to know online, that is what I did and just took the free tour of the maternity floor! 50 dollars really isn't too bad I would have had to pay 180 which was crazy and that's mainly why I didn't take the class and I did just fine lol. Good luck!
E9F6qjRWaa	Ummm...maybe its just your egg moving down the tubes? I have had the same pain last month but no baby yet? trying today got my first positive opk!!! lol ummm maybe its just gas!! good luck baby dust|`|t0jC2o0Jaa	You can't feel the sperm go into the egg. Which makes pregnancy for some a shock! LOL. But, you might have an ovarian cyst which can make a painful ovuation. They usually go away on their own. You still have a good chance if you BD'd lastnight & Today. Every month it's a 20-25% chance. I'd say your close to the 23-24%. =)<br>  And, yes it was most likely gas unless you have a leaky sink in your tummy haha. Or may have been stomach juice (as my nephew calls it lol) Good Luck!

Miracles do happen!|`|3defa348196fda3e86beb44c494d50e4aa	I just want you to know that you are not alone. My husband and I have been trying now for 3 years. We also just did and IUI last month that was not successful. I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life so I do know how you feel. All I can say is what everyone else says to me - just try and relax, try not to stress about it and it will happen soon. Don't feel like a failure because you aren't - it's not your fault. We had a beautiful little girl 4 years ago with no problems - I guess the babies come when they are ready, not when we are. Best of luck, I understand how you feel. I'm sending baby luck your way!!!!|`|3eb24cc18172f14ffb6a1cce8f3d960baa	You're not a failure...I mean things like this take time...it's when you expect it, that it doesn't happen...just be patient and it'll happen when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	I understand your feelings and I am right there with you.

I know it gets depressing and so frustrating.  I have been there in the past.  I had my first daughter who is 11 right now with no problems.  Then I was TTC again and lost the baby.  After that it was almost two years before I had my next child.  Sometimes it just happens.  You are not a failure.  Sometimes our bodies just don't cooperate.  I think my problem ended up being low progesterone.|`|3874b9da5757db1e9738ada8bc0eac68aa	You are not a failure.  I know how you feel though.  We are going to try IUI next month (if I'm not pregnant this month).  Good luck!|`|6c7909d6f8e1fb0a97a69c393fcd5dcdaa	I know that some mothers really want the experience of being pregnant. But, you really should think about adoption. There are so many pregnant mothers out there looking for a good family for their children. You could adopt a new born and still have all the joys of having the child from day one. Also. I know two families that have adopted, and then months later, when the stress was gone, ended up pregnant. Stop stressing, relax and enjoy life.|`|7be0a65faf9e57bb9d2a3517d6fc8e27aa	Don't worry I know some people that can't get pregnant and they went to the doctor and they are taking pills for it.

c0e181e08a2bf2a705561ac39ed9beb8aa	Your Mom knows it hurt, and she obviously felt bad about, and also she apparently tried not to embarrass you over it.  As a mother myself I would feel terrible if I accidentally hurt my son like that, but I would not go on and on over it because I know that would embarrass him to have his Mom fussing over his privates.|`|xIau7dloaa	I don't have balls, but I would forget about it because she didn't intend to hurt you; she just wanted to pass you the phone.  If it hurts really bad, just go to the doctor.|`|zztpXebdaa	Look, it was in ACCIDENT. its not like she just threw it just to hit you, she is not as dumb as you may think she is|`|Dhujji4Haa	yeah from the way you explained it, it sounded like it was an accident.|`|SRvCbAWlaa	What did you expect her to do?

Listen to my favourite song, went to Starbucks for my favourite treat etc..helps you reconnect with yourself.|`|VKpA3p7haa	Yeah I had days like that, couldn't really put it into words...they were the days i decided to just do nice things that made me feel good (like eating lots of cake,) and allowed other people to fuss over me! It'll pass hon. x|`|p11HaDIWaa	hmmm that's strange just relax and take it easy and don't stress over nothing, u'll be fine, good luck to u:)|`|PRIMPOgYaa	Being pregnant can make you feel odd. Listen to your inner self even if you don't feel sick, ring a friend and have a chat. Maybe a child and health nurse? I am sure it's nothing to worry about.|`|HclKftzAaa	i have had plenty of days where i just feel completely out of place. and like i want to DO something, but i don't know what it is. I think it is restlessness, probably caused by the 'waiting around' for the baby to come, or wanting to get out for a last hurrah before your life changes.<br>  <br>  Perhaps try doing a bit of exercise or nesting?<br>  <br>  It's definitely an emotional thing though, so if you've got someone to talk to, that might help :)|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Relax, Chill out and take it easy
sk46uigvaa	Implantation usually occurs 5-10 days later, sometimes it implants then unattached it's self then reattaches.<br>  <br>  In both my previous pregnancies i never felt implantation but i had sickness and mood swings from about 1 weeks after conception.<br>  <br>  if you do experience symptoms they may be a tiny bit of pink or brown spotting and maybe a few pains in the uterus, but that's uncommon.<br>  <br>  good luck

YCJz2DiWaa	I swear by olive oil. Just clean up the area and rub olive oil with your finger. I really think it feels so good to them. I know that when I have an itch or a rash, it feels so good to have a gentle oily rub.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	stop using wipes; use cool wet washcloths; make sure area is completely dry before putting a THIN coat of desitin on it; give it as much air time as possible; we have only had one rash, but i used the adult incontinence pads and laid her on those in case of accidents while the diaper was off....and if it doesn't clear up soon, take her to the doc, especially if it is a blister, bc just a simple ole diaper rash shouldnt blister up, at least not in my experience...gl<br>  NO powder<br>  make sure u are using the reg desitin in the purple tube with 40% zinc oxide....|`|tivpa7Vlaa	A&D ointment is the best...since my son been born i used destin the first week of his life and i found that he would still get some redness around the anus..one day my hubby bought home A&D ointment and i have never seen a rash since...baby is three months old and i hate to admit that he doesnt get change right away cause sometimes i dont even realized he pooed or peed but that ointment is very good i even put it on any little rashes i see on his body and next day its gone. i dont really like the smell of the ointment but i lotion him up with it anyway. it has a light medicine smell to it i wish it would smell like baby..but hey it works for baby delicate skin|`|PwhrTNZraa	It could get a little messy but let her go bare bum for awhile.  When my daughter was still small enough for a basonette we let her have "nudie time" in it.  I got water proof changing pads and laid her on top, then she was free to have some nudie time to "air out".  I also found that vaseline worked very well to PREVENT the rashes from even starting, and sometimes helped to ease the burning.  Penaten cream works wonders as does Sudacrem.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	The only thing I use for diaper rash is cornstarch.  If you are going to use rash cream it helps to put a bit of cornstarch on first to dry out the area otherwise you are just locking the moisture in.|`|sFpqug2laa	Aquaphor  (not sure if I spelled it right) is very good. It is sort of a medicated Vaseline. I have used it on my grandchildren with great results. The cornstarch thing is good also.|`|xUNowEfQaa	DO NOT USE CORNSTARCH!  If it's due to yeast, cornstarch will feed the yeast and make it much much worse.<br>  <br>  Try exposing the area to air as much as you can feel comfortable doing (as in, allow baby to go without a diaper on, no clothes (or cotton only), no cream)  See if getting air on it helps.<br>  <br>  Try cloth diapers for a day or two until it clears up.  Disposables have some pretty awful chemicals in them that could be preventing her from getting better.  Using 100% cotton diapers on her for a while will likely help.<br>  <br>  I had terrible luck with Desitin.  I did like the Butt Paste, though.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	It's going to take some time to heal.  Just be vigilant.  Also try putting some polysporin ointment on before the desitin.<br>  <br>  Make sure you air her bottom as long as possible during the day.  Put her on a waterproof pad and let her clean bum dry in the air.  An hour is great, but usually unreasonable for a busy mom!  I just do this for 10 min at a time 2-3 times in a day.  I also soak her bum for ten min in water twice a day then let it dry (once during the day, then at her bath before bed).<br>  <br>  It will get better, and it happens to the best of us!  You're not a bad mum!|`|cbmwayh3aa	Hydro cortazone have you tried that? Vasaline to help the sting?<br>  Um baby ointment? Go to a pharmacy if none of those works and just ask them:)|`|HtXYyZPqaa	If A & D with zinc don't work and some cornstarch... then it could be a yeast rash. And, if that's the case desitin and stuff won't clear it up.|`|aMXTsLtdaa	<a href="http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Cornstarch. And also start trying to check her at night! (also try not to use certain wipes or she'll get a rash FROM the wipes, lol. Happened to my sister)|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Try cornstarch.If it isn't looking any better by Monday take her to the doctor.|`|7jXChfBNaa	i use baby vaseline. it works like a charm.|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Just try to change her as soon as you notice she is wet or poopy. It's important to keep the area clean and dry. Try sensitive wipes, or gently cleaning her with water for a few days. I like Budreaux's Butt Paste personally, but Desitin will work fine too.|`|V0yYLtAuaa	my lil sister has the same thing but the best cream is destin thts very good
CwNMq7RTaa	Call a church and ask them.  Or call a pro-life group and ask them.  There are adoption agencies, but you don't know who you are dealing with.  Or call child protective services and ask them.
45xNJ7Ncaa	Many things can cause temps to elevate such as-- <br>  high progesterone levels<br>  a cyst left over from the previous cycle<br>  being sick (even just mild illness can cause a slight enough elevation in basal temp)<br>  lack of sleep or restless sleep<br>  stress<br>  there are others.<br>  I've had an elevated temp all during this cycle.  Like you, my temps always drop but this cycle they stayed high.  I started a fertility cycle --with the stong injection medicines and was being monitored by sonograms.  I had an ovulation then 2 days later another sonogram showed another egg was about to release.  So you can still ovulated when you have elevated temps before ovulation.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sometimes testing with temp isn't all that accurate because body temp can flucuate for many different reasons.
NOz2FRlraa	Try ovulation tests or taking your basal body temp and recording changes in cervical fluid. You can use www.fertilityfriend.com to record the latter for free. This will help you predict when you'll ovulate and confirm you have ovulated...rather than guessing based on dates (not everyone ovulates exactly halfway through their cycle).|`|egME1kB2aa	mt ovulation is 34 days i went to my doctors and they told me its stress so try and relax more if you worry to much you will have more issues hope this helped|`|KvL3L19Raa	I have the same cycle every 28days some month it changes with me as well, i still calculate 28days and have intercourse every Second day.

Good luck|`|fR6Y5q45aa	well to be sure youcould get an ovulation test to find out, search them on ebay, or u could just track down ur changes of temperature n mucus and stuff that way rather than guess what day ur ovulating by doin these things u get a better accurate date of ovulation!
P544Sbmqaa	He may be ready to start transitioning out of the afternoon nap.  I wouldnt force him to sleep at this point, but require quiet time.  Maybe he could read a few books or play quietly with something relaxing or soothing.  It will give you somewhat of a break during the day, but you arent fighting with him the whole time to make him nap when he doesnt want to.<br>  <br>  Of course, if he doesnt nap, until he is totally transitioned out of afternoon naps he will probably be very tired and approaching grouchy by bed time, so remember to be patient.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I have a 23 month old too and can't IMAGINE moving him to a big bed yet.  Both my older 2 were well over 2 1/2 and even in that case, the afternoon nap was out the window when we made the move.  <br>  <br>  If you have to move him, try using side rails (very long ones) on the sides of the big bed and even putting a pillow or other physical reminder at the end of the bed.  You can try putting him back into the bed each and EVERY time he gets out.  <br>  <br>  But in my experience the end of the crib meant the end of naps.

As cruel as it sounds, sometimes as parents, we have to let our children fail as well as succeed. This prepares them for future experiences on the battleground of dating and love. Just be there with a kind word and some moral support when it does happen, (and it will).<br>  Whatever you do, don't just turn a blind eye because he'll be needing you and your insights. <br>  That being said, I feel it's a good idea to wait until he's sixteen to break into the dating scene.|`|n1mwxljzaa	hahaha not mine (:<br>  i'm almost 14 & when my dad found out that i met a 16 year old while on vacation with my friend in another state, & that he's from the same state i'm from, let's just say i'll never mention him in front of my dad again lol.|`|kOBoy6wpaa	i wouldn;t stop it tbh, there is only a small age different and its would be different if the girl was younger but that's my opinion|`|vzWGml26aa	i would if the boy went to a party where the parents are going to supervise|`|AA11296427	LOL.

a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	I wouldn't get your friend a walker they aren't really good for babies. Babies need to have strong core belly muscle in order to walk and crawl. Being in a walker doesn't allowed that. Also it is a fact that babies don't walk any earlier if they use a walker actually quite the opposite. Plus if your friend has stairs it could be a huge safety hazards. An 8 month old is a little big for a walker anyway she should be crawling around and sitting up. If you are really wanting to get her something I would do a bouncer like a jumperoo. Bouncing for babies is a developmental step and it helps with good muscle tone.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my dd is also very petite for her age, this is the one she has and it works great for shorties!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2373425" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|PwhrTNZraa	Walkers are not really a good idea, quite often they are hard to find because of safety reasons (falling down stairs)  We used an exersaucer for our daughter, it's like a walker on stationary base.  It helps them to stand and gain leg muscles, teaches them balance and has all sorts of cool toys on the tray.  Plus, if you turn your back for a second the little one isn't heading down the hall for the stairs!!<br>  <br>  Add:::  It doesn't  even have to be name brand, and with the saucer when she was still a little too short to reach, I put a pillow under her feet so she could still get the idea early on.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I have a safety first model and it has a 3 height levels.  The only thing I didn't like about the one I have is that the batteries in the toy are not replaceable.  This is the one I have <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4810542" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  I'd suggest reading the reviews online to see what other people say about them.<br>  <br>  Thanks for letting me know about the batteries, I guess I'll have to go read some more reviews to see how to replace them.
caM1Syyfaa	God, no! No matter what the problem with your child is, spanking is never the right solution. <br>  <br>  Why don't you try to open a dialogue with her, ask her why exactly is she doing it. Maybe she is jealous on her brother, or frustrated in some way. Try to get to the bottom of the issue. I am pretty sure on her side she feels highly misunderstood, as absurd as that might sound to you. If you spank her, you will just deepen the gap between the two of you, she will feel even more misunderstood.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, kids never forget it. You think they are young, will forget, will thank you when they are grown up etc. But no, they will remember every single occurence and you will be hated by them and alone when you will be old.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	dont ask us, that is something that you have to decide, if nothing else works, grounding, taking things away, and time outs then wack her one. if my 7 year old cursed i would slap her acrosed the face and see how fast she is to curse again, but if she is cursing it says something about your parenting, she had to learn it from somewear.<br>  <br>  <br>  first time i ever cursed i was 11 and i got a slap acrosed the face, and i sure as hell never cursed again.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	No. .  You do not solve an issue with hitting.  If you spank her, I guarantee you she will not just be cursing but she will be HITTING her brother as well. <br>  You need to use your words, and stand by them.  You need to be consistant and talk to her about why it is wrong to be mean, do social situations and put her in a time out in her room.  Repeatedly if needed.  Be firm.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	maybe, and maybe not.<br>  <br>  What age is her brother?<br>  <br>  Do try other methods of punishment.<br>  And remember, as most find out "spanking" doesn't be a once for all thing; so loss of restrictions, etc. also should not be expected to be a once for all method.<br>  <br>  As for "ALWAYS cursing", I'd think MORE discipline and LESS punishment probably is what is needed.<br>  <br>  Why is she "ALWAYS mean" to her brother?|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Don't curse around her.  7 year olds don't just learn to curse on their own.  Kids do often learn to curse from their parents, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, because it's possible she might have learned it from her friends or something.  In that case I'd talk to the friends' parents and stop letting her play with those kids.  But if you are cursing around her, now would be a good time to stop.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	no.  if a seven year old is cussing, there is either a problem with your parenting or your daughter has a behavior disorder.<br>  <br>  I teach in a school.  Trust me, seven year olds are not going around cussing everyone out.  and in the very rare case that i student does cuss, the other students are the first to run to the teacher and tattle, because they know that it is wrong.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	What makes you think it would be?<br>  <br>  Try punishing her the correct way first.Spanking will do nothing but have her fear you.Try finding out the problem...then you can work on a solution.|`|rid4brOnaa	If you tried others ways to get her to stop cussing, then a spanking might be what it takes. Just be ready to spank every time she cusses again. At least for a while. Eventually, she will learn that certain words are unacceptable and will result in a stinging butt.<br>  <br>  Older siblings always torment the younger ones. Unless she is physically harming her brother, I probably would not resort to spanking except if it's a continuous thing. Being sent to her room, to the corner, or taking the TV away may be the path to take.|`|bo4MguzVaa	spanking I'd use as a very last resort.  I was raised without spanking but somehow I always was scared of my parents.  <br>  <br>  I would take everything out of her room that she may find fun if she was being really bad.<br>  If she has an allowance, take that away.  Ground her from tv.  <br>  <br>  Sit her down and have a long conversation & try to get her to understand whats right and wrong and how their are consequences to her actions when she chooses wrong.  Make her also understand that people have feelings and try to get her to empathize.|`|sB5dyaczaa	Yes. I spank my 9 year old brother, 13 year old sister, and 4 year old brother. I only do it to the 13 year old when she is being a spoiled little brat. If she is 7 then she should NOT be cursing. My 4 year old brother curses because of the 13 and 9 year old. I give him 4 swats on his butt and he learns real quick. Do timeout too. Wash her mouth out. Spank her.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	With 17 yrs of Parenting Exp under my belt I can honestly saying Smacking is never a solution no matter what age we are dealing with if your 7 yr old is swearing despite you making it very clear that it's unacceptable then maybe you need to investigate who she is hanging around at home & at School Also remember that if you or other Adults are swearing then she isn't going to stop Some kids don't accept the do as I say not as I do theory As far as being mean to her Brother that's just part of Sibling Rivalry as long as she's not deliberately cruel to him or physically hurts him|`|QTJhbDE3aa	I dont know about your child, but spanking is a very effective form of discipline for my daughter.|`|rBq189W1aa	Spanking is not the right solution for any kid. It's lazy parenting. You can do better.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	yes, thats what todays kids need.<br>  put her over your knee and apply some heat to her seat.<br>  <br>  Any good parent should spank.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	yes. hitting her will teach her to be nice.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You need to sit down and talk to your daughter on why she is cursing, if she is constantly cussing then she is hearing it somewhere and needs to know that it is not acceptable.  I understand that while you may think that spanking is good, as I am a very strong supporter of spanking. I do think what is needed more is to find out why she is spanking and why she is mean to her brother, to sit down and talk with her and ask why is she always mean.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to her and tell that from now on when she is mean to her brother or she is cursing she is going to get into trouble.  If she curses, then you can have her go stand in the corner for a few minutes, and yes while I agree with spanking may be able to help, you can't spank her now for it, when you have never spanked her before.  <br>  <br>  You need to tell her things are going to change and there will be some spanking in the home but that isn't going to happen now but will happen for big things.  So with corner time you try to help her break of the habit with being consistent.  That means EVERY TIME she is mean to her brother or misbehaves she gets scolded and a time out, and you need to keep consistent with that.  Then after a few weeks of doing that, you can use spanking as a means of correction once there is consistency, and once she has had some time to learn to control it.<br>  <br>  Spanking can be a very effective discipline but if you do it without her knowing it will come if she misbehaves, and giving her a chance to improve her behavior it will only backfire.  So while I do agree that spanking at times is a good method of discipline, I think there are more affective ways of being able to correct her.|`|UGSlEhnbaa	No. Spanking is an abusive form of parental misconduct. I would recommend talking to your child about why the things she is doing are wrong and how she can improve. Just be sure to talk in a manner in which she will understand. I would continually reprimand her by revoking privileges such as television or play time as incentive to act better. It never hurts to be frank and tell her how you feel about it. <br>  <br>  If this doesn't work ask some of her friends parents about how they get their kids to behave.|`|98qMZZPlaa	Yeah, Whoop that A**..  Seriously, Tartism needs to stop!!  Back in the day, there was no tartism.  Parents, grandparents, teachers, even neighbors would make the kid go get a switch and whoop that A**!!<br>  <br>  Time out bull sh*t is why all these kids these days are in control rather than the parents.  Parents need to take their parenting role back, otherwise the future will be in worse shape than it is now.<br>  <br>  And~~ I am 100%against any form of child abuse.  Child abuse comes in the form of having NO discipline at all.|`|DzzY78N4aa	yes, its how they learn not to do it again and that you are the boss. she WILL think twice before she is mean or curses again if your more aggressive with the situation. also I'm not saying hit her to were she has a bruise just to were she don't want to get spanked again.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Have you tried spanking her already? If so has it worked so far? I personally do not like to spank,  but only you know what will work.|`|Ou2yNU05aa	Why is she mean? Would you smack an adult who was smaller than you?

263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Not by the birth experience itself. But yes, as a parent I feel empowered because I feel so passionate about doing right by my child. I tend to be very passive when it comes to wanting things for myself and won't ask or have any expectations. But I want the best for my child, so I tend to be more outspoken when it comes to her growth, development, and well being.<br>  Nothing went as I expected during her birth, but I had resolved to let things go as they may just before I went into labor. I just needed to be open to all possibilities and do whatever I needed to do to deliver a healthy baby.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	I have three children and all the births where different. I felt like I could achieve any thing after having given birth. The strength that I found, I never knew I had. To endure such pain for so long was surprising to me.

I was blessed.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	No. <br>  <br>  I preferred to let the professionals do their job, and tell me what to do and when to do it. Nothing happened the way I thought it would.

Hopefully w/out sounding self-agrandizing. I got pregnant at 18 and gave birth at 19. I went from the selfish teenager to an adult mother over the course of 12 hours.

iaPwz2O5aa	Adri, como mulher devo-te dizer k a toma da pilula, seja ela qual for, produz algumas modifica??es a nível hormonal, portanto é normal que sintas os seios mais duros e inchados. E isso varia muito com os primeiros dias de toma ou o período fértil.<br>  Eu tomo a yasmin também, e também tenho alturas que sinto algumas modifica??es corporais, mas é mais natural que as tuas modifica??es ocorram de forma bem diferente, pois estamos a falar de um aumento de hormonas femininas num corpo masculino.<br>  Nunca ouvi dizer k a Yasmin fosse fraquinha.Gra?as a Deus ainda nada me ocorreu nada de inesperado relativamente a toma dessa pílula.<br>  De qualquer forma, se queres ter seios, acho k deverias te aconselhar com um médico especialista e n?o tomar demasiados comprimidos, pois n?o sabes se poder?o ter efeitos secundários indesejáveis.<br>  Boa Sorte|`|5I6IsryYaa	filho se quer ter seios quarde o dinheiro e coloca silicone vai ficar bem mais legal meu seios n cresceram nada e ja faz 3 anos q tomo|`|HfuRZJglaa	Pelo amor de Deus hen????

vGxipYJnaa	You're right to let your little one fight her own battles - it's great that she can stand up for herself. <br>  <br>  It seems like your friend is overprotective of her son and has the misconception that her darling boy is an angel. Some mothers think their kids can do no wrong for some reason. <br>  <br>  Next time her son comes crying to her about something, just ask your friend to let the two of them (her son and your daughter) sort it out themselves instead of involving you. (Unless it's serious).|`|CxCigxZIaa	Ok as far as the age gap..3 and 4 year old's are fine for each other. Most of them will be going to school together. The ONLY thing I think is a bit disturbing here is the BITE MARK. It should have been handled differently. <br>  Example: Once your child said..."so and so bite me" (crying) YOU take your child to the child that bit her and demand an apology. "Ok ____ (childs name that bit your child) I think you owe _______(your childs name) a "sorry" for biting her" - and then that's it. <br>  As for the OTHER mom saying it wasn't her child's teeth marks? That's just silly. Silly silly silly. <br>  You might want to observe these two more closely perhaps to make sure your daughter is being treated fairly. YOU are her advocate - you take up for her when she's not able to. <br>  KUDOS to you for being a very observant mom.|`|AA11537580	no one is the bully in this situation(well maybe your friend..lol)<br>  that's just the way young kids behave, they will learn not to grab, bite, hit and so on as they get older.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Sounds like your friend wishes to wrap her son in cotton wool and thinks he is an angel.<br>  She bite herself till her cried? Yeah right love.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	that's what friends r for!\ lol...|`|HclKftzAaa	that boy is going to be one messed up individual when he's older. He is always getting his own way and learning that he can do no wrong.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you supervise the play dates yourself- with a nanny cam if necessary, so that you can prove to her that her son is behaving the same- if not worse than- your daughter.<br>  <br>  No child would bite themselves hard enough to leave a mark, they don't have the sense to get someone else in trouble this way when they're 3.|`|16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	Your friend sounds like a *****.  I suggest you take a lesson from your daughter, and stand up for yourself to your friend.  She needs to get a life!  I know parents that are like that, and I can't stand them!  Kids will be kids, we're there to guide them and teach them to resolve conflicts, not punish!  <br>  <br>  If her son takes something from your daughter and your daughter shouts at him, just simply encourage her to use her indoor voice, give her the language that she needs to use, practice with her what to say in the situation "That's mine, please give it back" "I'm using that, please give it back". and she should be encouraging her son to say a simple "I'm sorry".  Likewise, if her son comes to her and says your daughter took something from him, she should be encouraging him to use his words, not have you go to discipline your daughter.<br>  <br>  You might wanna try these techniques the next time, but if your friend still isn't treating your daughter fairly, I would call her on it and have it out with her.  Don't let her tell you how to parent your child.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	Shoot, at 2, almost 3yrs old, if there's no biting, hair pulling, kicking or hitting, there's no bullying, lol.  They aren't exactly more sophisticated than that, and you're already ahead of the game if your 2yr old can yell about and articulate a wrong done to her rather than just, say, biting.  Your friend seems to have a really negative, and possibly unrealistic, outlook on your daughter.  I mean come on, whose 2yr old is sophisticated enough to bite herself hard enough to leave marks, muster tears over it, and then blame it on another child.  I mean, you have stay aware of your kid's shortcomings, but you should also be able to expect your friends to be understanding of her quirks, especially in the absence of real harm repeatedly occurring to other children.  By the time a kid is 4, I'm also expecting them to begin learning patience and forbearance in interacting with younger children.  I don't expect them to have achieved it, but I consider it their early lessons in it.  <br>  <br>  I'd try and have a conversation with your friend that you feel she's been really down on your daughter, and maybe ask her if there's something you've been doing that leads her to be more protective of her son.  In the end, maybe you find times to get together with your friend without the kids, or perhaps find ways of including more kids of different ages in the mix.
FiUprYsvaa	She was trying to comfort you. <br>  She was being really nice. <br>  <br>  I hate this whole, laizze faire thing going on with schools. <br>  There have been many times when I have broken down at school from extreme stress and what I really needed was a hug. <br>  <br>  One of my teachers gave the whole class hugs on the last day in class. We were seniors, it wasn't creepy, it was really sweet.|`|2tn8EALqaa	It's not a big deal. Calm down.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	teachers hug students all the time. u r nothing special so get over ur self!|`|CdJtH0xdaa	She was just trying to be nice and supportive. If it creeped you out, just talk to her about it. She probably didn't mean for it to creep you out. Good luck to you and your foot. ;-)|`|XGgPhaDbaa	She was probably just hugging you like she does her own daughter. You are injured.<br>  Don't make too much of it. Unless she starts hugging you all the time.|`|w5kQ98Fxaa	Shrug out of it if it happens again. If anyone puts their arm around your or anything you don't like, take yourself out of it by bending over so they have to drop the arm - tighten a shoelace or point to the bandage on your foot - adjust the bandage, adjust your shorts/skirt/pants.. Anything so that your back/shoulders is out of their comfortable reach.<br>  <br>  Most people won't register this is a deliberate attempt to get out of their grip and most people will feel uncomfortable going immediately back into arm-around-you unless they do it regularly and know you like/don't mind it. <br>  <br>  If they put their arm on your shoulders after you've got out of it once (unlikely but hey, let's cover all the bases here) and you don't want their arm there just smile sort of awkwardly and shrug and say; 'hey, i'm really sorry but i hate people touching my back.' <br>  <br>  They will likely be embarrassed but be as nice about it as possible - just being honest is better than getting into some sort of 'my shoulder hurts' lie that might mean you get a back massage or something awkward.<br>  <br>  As for now, try to stop thinking about it by doing several things at once.. Go cook a meal while also watching the most involving movie you know.. Or while drawing or singing along and trying to remember all the lyrics to every song on the radio..<br>  <br>  Do something you enjoy and know you get super involved in and hopefully next time you see the PE teacher her behavior will just reaffirm for you that it was totally unconcious contact and she didn't mean anything by it.<br>  <br>  Good luck chilling out.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	I have the same problem as you. I know its hard but even though you were embarrassed just shake it off. Its really not a big deal. Maybe avoid talking to her for a couple days or since its the weekend then by monday you will be fine.|`|Z0cmfmo1aa	you probably feel weird cause she'd never done that before she probably did it to be sweet don't think too much of it , if it really makes you feel uncomfortable tell your parents.|`|n5URUEqXaa	She was probably just trying to be nice.<br>  But if it creeps you out, tell a responsible adult<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck!(:|`|6ReruqPgaa	To answer your question: she was just trying to be nice. I'm a little to old for this section, but sometimes I like to see whats going on in you you peoples head, and besides your section is in pregnancy and parenting, and that's where I be. I have a story from when I was in Elementary school about my mishap with my gym teacher but he was a man. At the time he was dating the music teacher, it made for a very awkward atmosphere that even 9 and 10 year old's noticed. I don't know if he missed his bowel movement that morning or injected a ml too much steroid but if I can remember right: I was in gym and he was demonstrating climbing the ropes and I said he looked cool or something and it got back to him via some little turd, I cant even remember, that I had called him a punk or something. Next thing I know he called me out of my homeroom class and basically pinned me up against the wall, not physically but by his presence. And told me in the meanest Mr. Clapper voice ( funny last name right!?) " Don't you ever call me a punk , okay , I am not a punk" Then he went on to ask me " Did you call me a punk?" Remind you to me he looked like hulk hogan or somebody, what do you think I said?
W4zrfzNpaa	i don't recommend it, those drinks are for adults and should not be given to children.  the drinks sometimes hype up adults and its ingredients can build up in time, in your body.  give your toddler plenty of water and vitamins appropriate for his age.  if he has an energy problem check with your pediatrician.  the additives can cause your child to be hyperactive and even slow their mental development.  please don't give it to your baby.|`|wE5JMeesaa	Uhhhh.<br>  Why do you have kids?<br>  Seriously.  What's going on in your head?|`|nDEVWjCEaa	Why in the world would you WANT to give a 22 month old a energy drink?? <br>  they are for adults..|`|HkDUxkS4aa	I dont think so those things are for ADULTS!<br>  <br>  Don'T they make a kid drink like that for young ones?<br>  <br>  I would talk to a DOC before you give him anything like that.<br>  <br>  Besides a young baby like that should be getting all his nutrients with the food you give him, unless he has a medical condition there is no need to give him things like that.<br>  <br>  Those drinks are for people who dont have time to geat proper or who are sick and need the vitamins ETC to be healthy|`|MgvYMfIWaa	why would you give him that anyway. he doesn't need the extra sugar and caffeine. he should be getting all this nutrients through his foods and vitamins. there isn't any reason to give him an energy drink. plus he's not even 2 sometimes i dont understand why parents would consider giving their children energy drinks when they already have enough energy and if he doesn't then you need to take a look at what he's eating or take him to his pediatrician|`|azE51WGRaa	I wouldn't give any kid, especially a 22 month old, any kind of an energy drink. I don't think that would be too good for him. Besides, doesn't he already have enough energy at 22 months? You really want to give him more? =D|`|1U7yLEf9aa	NO... IT DOES NOT SAY ON THE BOTTLE BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF KNOWN BY MOST PEOPLE. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR CHILD. not good for him.|`|kziIf0r6aa	It wouldnt be something a child that age requires as they are pretty full of energy as it is.  My son would be bouncing off the walls if we allowed him to have anything like that.  You might as well give him a cup of coffee and a gurana tablet|`|07fb16ab80bfdbf75e1dc1a451479dcbaa	I wouldn't risk it try pedia sure.|`|hbL99aY7aa	No he can't.
OI3bf4yjaa	Of course everyone will have different opinions. It all depends on your pain tolerance.. if you can tolerate it, you can experience the magical feeling of natural birth! But if you want to be focusing on your baby instead of the pain you're going through, an epidural would be the best way to go. My situation was a funny story, I had an epidural, but it wore off while I was giving birth. So I went from barely feeling anything, to feeling ALOT! It was horrid. You would recover from a natural birth faster though. You would be able to get up walk around, shower, and eat right away. It's also the fastest method to deliver. Since the mother can feel the body reflexes, they can push better and faster. Studies show that getting an epidural prolongs your pushing time. I may also add that, ever since I had an epidural I have been having back problems. So that sucks! lol<br>  <br>  I have to agree with one of the posters above, the mom's who have a natural birth are freakin' TOUGH! I would never have imagined me going through one.. until I really had no choice but to.<br>  <br>  The next child I'm having, it IS going to be a natural birth. Even though it hurts like hell, It's an amazing experience.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	ahhhh EPI! i don't know how women say no pain killers especially if you are in active labor for more than 3hrs...from my experience of laboring for 24hrs but 8hrs of it was very very painful then i got the epi and things sped up real fast once i got it cause i was able to relax and baby came out in less than 20mins of pushing|`|wKuQC4yTaa	im gonna try to get to 6cm, before i have an epidural. depending on how that goes, i may try not to have one, to speed the birth process up.|`|p6AMoTs8aa	i did natural doctors told me epi elongates the pushing process and can lead to back pains|`|57LFRfqCaa	Three natural births.|`|CtENASfvaa	i got an epi at 3 cm and then an hour and a half later i was 8 cm i recommend it alllll the way and i was up walking about 2 hours later and no matter what they will take the baby for about 2 hours to give you time to rest and to check out all the bells and whistles on the baby like blood tests and such the one thing i  do recommend is look into ways that will help you not to tear no one ever tells you about the pain you are in after the baby is born like stitches good luck and congrats!!!|`|zdWDkadraa	I'll be going for natural. It seems safer with less complications, my mom did all naturals, and my hospital specializes in them so... I figure we'll make it through alive either way, so I can endure the pain.|`|OfLyP6mgaa	I had back labor with my son, so I had an epidural! I was actually able to get to 5cms before I had it though, so I think that if I didn't have the back labor, I could have done it naturally.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Epidural.  But natural birthing mom's rock.  I just don't have a high pain tolerance and I kinda freak out about it.  But my labor was wonderful with my epi.|`|ybexjS2Paa	I had epidural with both kids, I'm not very good with pain ;) It didn't slow my delivery process, I could still feel the contractions coming though they weren't painful.|`|SY8b17Ldaa	i had a posteria bbaby so i wanted epi but had a natrual because my bub came to fast but by the time they usually set up for the epi its all over|`|PmOc9qdDaa	natural. much safer and less painful in the long run.|`|LMNHj66baa	epi|`|ClKxHUJpaa	I had a natural birth and felt like the strongest woman alive.  But, if you don't really want to have a natural birth, you're probably not going to pull it off unless you fly through labor. Reducing interventions in labor reduces complications though, which to me makes it worth it.  When a woman's blood pressure bottoms out during an epidural, which is a fairly common side effect, it feels like you are about to die and it's rough on the baby as well.   Your best bet if you want a natural birth is to get a midwife who will support you throughout labor and go to a hospital with whirlpool labor tubs.  Oh, and EDUCATE yourself, take Bradley classes, not lamaze.  Don't expect to walk into the hospital and just be able to pull off a natural birth with the nurses help.  Even if she is keen on natural birth, it doesn't mean she'll have time.|`|AwRrdHmEaa	natural birth...why?...because natural birth reduces the likelihood of needing to separate the infant from its mother after birth|`|kaqPSgTVaa	epidural all the way! I was induced with my first and it was BAD! I couldn't get the epidural because it ended up being too late and I needed an emergency C-Section. I suffered for forever! Or at least it felt that way. With this baby they'd better give it to me the minute I walk in the door! LOL

4BBjhHAnaa	Sounds like the two of you are pretty irresponsible.<br>  What are you doing having unprotected sex when you don't have the financial stability, job security, and functional relationship necessary for raising kids?<br>  <br>  She probably is really pissed about the whole situation.  Honestly it is as much her fault as it is yours.  The most you can do is be helpful and supportive and contribute in both financial support and care for the children as much as you can.<br>  <br>  Be willing to accept the fact that maybe she doesn't want you in her life.  She may still want you to pay child support.  You should.  They're your kids, too. <br>  <br>  The two of you need to sit down and talk about this.<br>  Be mature.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	How old are you? How old is she?<br>  <br>  It is, either way, very, very irresponsible of both of you to NOT take birth control when you cannot support her and baby number one!!! Geez! How can you bring more children you cannot pay for into the world . . .just for sexual pleasure.<br>  <br>  Doesn't excuse her being distant now . . . and yes, it could be hormones. Nevertheless! CONDOMS!!! If you two are still together after this baby . . . no more playing around. Don't be a fool!<br>  <br>  Yes, she could look for a more financially stable mate . . . it still doesn't change your responsibilities to raise these two children you've fathered. Quit worrying about your sex life. If you don't have a job to support these children you keep making . . .your job is to LOOK FOR A JOB 8 HOURS A DAY, five days a week or more!<br>  <br>  Get to it . . . <br>  It is hard, yes . . .and if you need more skills, while your free of time (instead of worrying about sex) -- go to school! Learn a trade that will bring you money . . . You can probably attend school free or on a loan or grant.<br>  <br>  Take care of the child already here and keep your body parts in your jeans, unless they are covered with a condom.|`|jCGyJn5Oaa	Bless you for hanging in there and being diligent in your job search. I understand that things happen. May the lord watch over you and your baby(babies). Play it a bit safer though until u are able to talk with her about your anxieties.

DdLfaEzNaa	I save them for use with future children.  I don't really care if their clothes are "out-of-style", they are only little children after all!  Besides, I have mostly boys, and they wear shorts, jeans and T-shirts mostly.  Those are pretty long-lasting, as long as the boys don't wear them out!  Every time I swap out winter and summer clothes I get rid of stuff, though.  Don't like to hold on to too much.  When we're done having kids, we'll be delighting someone else with a bunch of free hand-me-down stuff.  Only the stuff that has stayed in good condition though.  All else will be tossed.|`|uY3nu8pPaa	If you're still debating whether or not to have another child, I would keep them, just in case.It's good to have a memento of when they were little. My mother kept my baby clothes in the attic and showed them to me when I got older. I love seeing the clothes I couldn't imagine myself in. Giving away to charity is good, as well. Or if you have a younger sibling you can see if they'll need any baby girls' clothes.|`|jBnQiZVFaa	Yup.  Another is usually a good bet.  I did eventually give my daughter's used clothes to another mom who had a daughter.  My second was a boy, so I wasn't gonna be using the girl's clothes anyway.  Now he is 10 months and I have given away some of his clothes.  I kinda enjoy seeing their clothes on other kids.  I had some cute stuff that just didn't get worn enough.  Now number three is on the way...and he/she will get some new stuff and a couple hand-me-downs that I couldn't part with.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Some of my kids clothes I donate to charity. Occasionally I sell a few things on eBay. When I sell them, I use the money to get them new clothes. My sister is pregnant with a baby girl so I have been passing all my daughters clothes to her. A lot of my sons things go in the bin. He's 4 and usually rips the knee out of his pants or ends up with holes in this shirts before he out grows them. Boys will be Boys lol.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	This might get tricky to explain. My sister got pregnant a few months after me. When we both found out we were having girls, one of her friends gave her TONS of girl stuff. She gave it to me, as my girl would be older and could wear them first. I in turn gave them back and whatever else my daughter would grow out of. Now if either of us have girls again, we're set!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I sure do keep all my child's clothing. Some have sentimental value, I just may have another girl, or I have given some clothes away to another couple that needed them. I couldn't stand to throw perfectly cute clothing away!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes I do! I've got 3 girls and hand me downs from sisters are the big thing in my house!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	no but my sister keeps her and my kids old clothes and things?|`|CFFuFof1aa	Well, I've kept certain clothes like the ones that I thought were incredibly adorable or ones she got her pictures made in or wore on special holidays. I don't keep all of them though. There is a consignment sale that happens where I live. I put the clothes and toys that she doesn't wear or use anymore in that. I get 70% of the money and the other 30% goes to a charity. You can get more money out of them at the consignment sale than by having a yard sale. Then I turn around and use the money that I make to buy her new clothes and toys.|`|kjgonYlgaa	Are you going to have another child?  If you are, just look at them as an investment.  I kept mine for 5 years.  My mother in law tried to give them away, and criticized me for being a pack-rat (we didnt tell her we were trying for another).  As my newest little one grows, I take some of the cloths and toys to a consignment shop.  I use the money that I make from those to buy cloths for my older child.  Some of my favorites I'm putting away instoragee.  For how long I don't know.  I have 3 older daughters 16 - 20 and a couple younger sisters.  I know someone will appreciate them.  I do have memory boxes for my children that  I put their coming home outfits and a favorite in.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I kept my absolute favorite outfits through those first months (downsized to like 3 outfits lol) and then gave the rest away to my sister who needed them. I would give them away to someone who needs them, but keep the sentimental ones, like her dress she came home in from the hospital, her first pair of shoes, ETC. Have fun with your little girly!<br>  <br>  Lauren|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I kept the ones of sentimental values.  Her father passed away when she was 2 and so I kept the outfits that were his favorite on her, the ones her grandmother knitted, etc.  The others I gave away.  I am glad I didn't keep way too many cause baby #2 is a boy and most of hers were all pink :)|`|qBFojHLMaa	I gave away everything we had thinking it would be at least 4 years between our children and hoping that even then it would be the opposite sex. But now my son is 19 months and im due in july with another boy and feel terrible that I gave everything away. So i would keep it for a while, I really wish I had. im happy i was able to help others but now I can only hope they help me back!! :)<br>  Good luck|`|QP46eVi4aa	i have 12 tote boxes of little girls clothes that i had when i had my little girl hopeing to have number 2 and finally got number 2 2 weeks ago but he was  boy after i was told a girl so i am taking them to the teen parents program monday for the teens who are having babies and can not afford much|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I have 3 or 4 tubs of my daughters clothes. Im pregnant right now and I dont know if its a girl or a boy but thats why i kept them all. I know i wanted to have another child. If its a boy im going to sell all her clothes this summer at a garage sale and then use that money to buy my son clothes.|`|ied3Ww49aa	I couldn't part with my son's out grown clothes! Since he was my first child...every piece of clothing meant something to me! Sounds weird right haha but luckily I didn't because I am now pregnant with son #2! I guess keeping the clothes did come in handy!|`|zZNv7N1Gaa	What i did and still do is keep the ones that you really like or have a sentimental value(like she wore it on a special day that you remember).|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	I usually give them to a child that needs them.  I see no point in keeping them put up when another child could be using them unless you plan on having more children soon.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I keep my favorite outits and donate the rest.I'm not looking to have another child anytime soon otherwise I would have kept them.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	yes i keep them and since i had 2 boys in a row it worked out well-and now im on my 3rd boy. but dont worry-eventually you will be able to let some of the clothes go. i have told myself-after this baby i will only keep a few of the baby outfits and the rest are going to go to someone at our church. then i can still have the joy of seeing them but i dont have to store them anymore... :0)|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Yes and No.<br>  I keep the more sentimental outfits in a keepsake box for my son. I kept the outfit he came home from the hospital in and his first pair of PJ's.  I kept the shirt he wore in the hospital, his first little pair of socks and shoes (which are bronzed), and his first hat.  I kept one unused newborn diaper as well.  <br>  <br>  The other clothes he outgrows I do one of two things with:<br>  A. I donate them to a charitable resale shop or shelter house to help low income mom's or mom's that are in trouble due to abuse in their home. They need good, clean baby and kids things at those places to help these mom's out for the kids sake.  I pass on thing that are still like new and still in style when I can a few times a year. <br>  <br>  B. I keep ones that are in good repair and that I can use again because they don't scream "boy". I've saved one or two big plastic bins with lids of reuseable things since my husband and I are trying for a second child. I can resuse some of the things from my son and then buy some new that are gender specific as needed so that the next one will have special new outfits just for them as well. <br>  <br>  Socks, underwear, shoes and swim stuff are about the only things I don't pass on or keep (except for the newborn size pair of socks and shoes I kept for sentimental reasons).  Those things to me are like giving someone a used toothbrush. I just can't do it.|`|8RfmosODaa	I am keeping mine. I could have more kids so they would be useful but I also have an idea: To make them into a quilt in a few years. I'm not a quilter I have NO clue how to make one but I think it would be neat!|`|a8IRxC4raa	If you're not having any more kids, give them away.

KlWWh3fgaa	I would assume she's just trying to grasp the whole talking thing. My daughter 16 months, and is beginning to say little sentences, and words. It is sometimes hard to understand her, but, it's a learning process at the end of the day. <br>  <br>  Is her hearing good? Is she talking like a toddler or is she really having any specific problem. Test her by getting her to mimic the vowels = a, e, i, o, u. All with the long vowel sound. Can you explain further on how she is not clear. Our sound are made with different areas of our mouths. Some kids just do not choose to be as audible as others. But that doesn't mean that they are behind. But if their is a problem, it is easier to work with it now than to wait. A bad habit is a baaaaaaaad habit. <br>  <br>  It can't hurt to have her evaluated. If she's fine, you'll know it. If she's not, you'll be on your way to getting her help.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Perhaps she has a deviated septum?

3MrhyHTZaa	i think aborion is wrong... unless the life of the mother is endagered (monetary loss is not considered endagered).  To take the life of a child is murder no matter how you look at it.  And to say that an unborn fetus isnt alive is offensive because if you kill a teenager, you destroy any possible future that he may have had, any impact he may have had on the world.  Its the same with a fetus.  Murder isnt just the destruction of a CURRENT life... but the destruction of a possible future as well.  Also, on a more personal level, she will more than likely eventually regret the decision.|`|QyDjDqLzaa	Well, personally I believe it depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  If you become pregnant and are in a stable mind, surronded with a positive enviornment in your home then you shouldn't abort.<br>  However, if you can not support your baby in a stable enviornment without the resources or love it deserves, then aborting seems like a good option.<br>  <br>  In my case, i have an auto-immune disease which i have to take medication for. If i become pregnant while on my medication, it can effect the baby severly, therefore i would have to abort anyways.|`|kqs3paJKaa	okay so it's MY PERSONAL OPINION...so don't get mad :) first off abortion is wrong UNLESS there is rape or incest involved. Second you shouldn't be having sex unless you are willing to take responsibly for your actions..i'm pretty sure a 17 year old knows what birth control is or how about having your partner wear a condom?? Thirdly there are many women out there that are unable to have children of their own and are looking for babies in this type of situation to adopt. and im sure it might seem like hell to go through school while pregnant but the weight on your shoulders wont be lifted after the baby is terminated...there will probably be even more later on.<br>        ~*20yo..mother of 1*~|`|rx0OyL3oaa	they should have got their boyfriend to wear a condom. but personally im against it. just think how you would feel if your parents had decided to get an abortion its murder whichever way you look at it. plus it would weigh heavy on your conscience.|`|Odnv3Xbpaa	BAD EVIL CRUEL<br>  because your killing a person|`|rEB6RAw6aa	i thinks its an awful choice. its like killing a tiny innocent person:( <br>  <br>  PRO LIFE:)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	A 17 year old is just as capable of carrying the pregnancy to term and is just as capable of raising the child.

I don't know if I believe it is right or wrong<br>  <br>  I don't believe that humans have the right to take someones life, no matter what the circumstances. That is God's job, not ours. Just because the baby is not yet born, does not mean that it isn't a person. People have no right to murder, and it is sinful and disgusting<br>  <br>  but then this little voice in the back of my head says "wait a minute"! what if you were the victim of rape? Personally, I would struggle not to remember the person that raped me every time I saw my child (I'm not speaking from experience though, maybe the parental bond between mother and child eliminates these feelings.

ZDMUW1YRaa	Hi Emily, <br>  Pregnancy tests are very sensitive, they detect the amound of HCG in your urine, I would get a First Response test, is that the one you used?  It's very accurate.  Don't be discouraged it sounds to me like you most definitely are pregnant.  Water can dilute the results for sure.  Also, take your pregnancy test first thing in the morning, when you wake up .  The very first time you urinate for the day should be on that stick, it's the most concentrated urine of the day and will give a more accurate result.  In early pregnancy the hormone HCG actually doubles every single day, so you could test 4 days ago and today get a completely different result.  I would test again in the morning, you will see that plus sign!|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Sounds like it to me<br>  <br>  *Baby dust*|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Hey chick,<br>  very very confusing i no, your hormone levels probably arnt high enough for the test you used to detect yet, try first response that did it for me! one day late and bam i had a BFP!  I had most of those symptoms too altho i didnt think they were syptoms at the time! <br>  Take another test preferably the first response one and do it in the morning the first wee of the day, ive been told it makes a difference altho i took my last thing at night<br>  take another test darlin<br>  good luck and baby dust to you <3|`|YwOLE88Gaa	hi, would wait at least a week if your period is late, it could still come, i find when i worry about it ,its always late lol.  but it sounds like you have the rest of the syptoms of pregnancy sore boobs more discharge. i say wait a ew more days and take the test first thing in the morning. good luck x|`|9f8f47cbb3e9cb809e35c3b98f1a16d0aa	Honestly i think you would have to go to the doctor to make any logical asumptions. i think you probably are, home tests are not very effective and they take more then one try.|`|1cdfec2697940a7924276a038673bb29aa	Sound to me llike you are. And yes drinkin that much water and testing you dilute the concentration of HCG in your urine.
ZZakBjiNaa	so was your first day of your last period 1st February?<br>  when did you have sex?<br>  <br>  well in that case, you'd only be 4 weeks along. it's too early to get a positive one..wait a week or 2 until you take another. good luck x|`|98WKYtfwaa	Take a test in a weeks time. Sometimes the HCG isn't strong enough to detect a pregnancy at this stage.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	I haven't had my period for 4 months (strange) but im definately not pregnant my doctor has confirmed it many times.|`|1cdfec2697940a7924276a038673bb29aa	Go to your Drs and ask for a blood test they are more sensitive than the pee on a stick kind.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I'm in the same boat. Wait 2 weeks and see. If it still shows neg, then go the doctors.
CdJtH0xdaa	Yes, you are a bad girlfriend. You need to tell your boyfriend what you've been doing. And how could you feel you had to kiss the second boy? You have a boyfriend, and he has a girlfriend, for crying out loud! You are such a dishonest girlfriend. I'd hate to be in a relationship with you.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Well yes you are. You sound like you are only young so this is some advice. You need to change your ways as of today. This kind of disrespect for your self will get you no where in life.

You did have a choice about kissing him- if you really didn't want to, you could have rejected it, but from what you're saying, you went along with it.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	So you cheated on your boyfriend with two different guys?<br>  Yeah, you're a bad girlfriend.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Yes! You cheated on him, whether you regret it or not.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	just a slag.|`|wjGj6uU3aa	I think you already know the answer to this question yourself. In my opinion yes you are. You cheated on your boyfriend, you had the choice to say no to the kiss but you went along with it and let it happen.|`|ATxam2HPaa	Well u arn't a bad girlfriend you just don't know what you want anymore. But don't F around your bf do him a favour and let him go|`|kD8iggyCaa	i'm sorry to say it but yea you are!<br>  you are not faithful and honest<br>  it's cheating 100%|`|SWOeg0jFaa	uh, ya.<br>  <br>  that's not really fair to your boyfriend|`|AA11537580	yes, you cheated on him twice in one week!!|`|GBy0W2YEaa	umm yeah you are|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Usually when you cheat on somebody you are...|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Wear something low cut and sexy, Tell him everything that happen, Tell him your sorry, Tell him it wont happen ever again, Turn on the waterworks, Hug him close and tight so he can feel you, cry and say sorry and he will probably forget you this time!!!!<br>  To answer your question, Yes you probably were a bad gf but it depends on how you handle it from now to what the outcome will be..... ;-)|`|IqcQ7pnfaa	That is if you also wanted and was happy with the mistakes you made. You're in a relationship for a year and this makes it a test for you on whether you gave in to the temptation or stayed faithful to your man.|`|ZIjE5R5raa	oooh thats bad<br>  <br>  mistress and cheater<br>  <br>  if you both feel guilty just make sure you dont get it out|`|N9U8KFCMaa	YES|`|jU5wdiCuaa	yes but don't let your boyfriend find out lol|`|mSC7jIUBaa	Your an awful girlfriend !

I had a history of ovarian tumours so didnt think I had much chance of falling pregnant.

The blood test will give you positive answers. Good luck
IU4uNH97aa	Nope not at all. If you love then name then you should use it no matter what time of year she is born around. My daughters middle name is August and even if she was born in september i would still have named her Lucy August, August is after my uncle Gus. It was important for my to name my daughter after him and i would of kept it even if she was born in January !|`|BOJEbnCtaa	no way. I think it's your child you don't have to go by that.|`|8RfmosODaa	Nope, you can use it for any baby :)|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I don't see why it should be.  After all, it's going to be the child's name all year long, not just around Christmas.  I don't think of April as a name that's only suitable if your child is born in the fourth month of the year (in fact, the only April I've ever known was born in Sept).  If you like Noelle, then go with it.  Doesn't matter when your child is due.|`|AA11476951	It's a beautiful name. Who cares when she's born.|`|RLMcpYheaa	No, not necessarily.|`|F37JustBaa	no. i know someone named noelle and she was born in january!|`|uQEM0fIKaa	my friend's middle name is Noelle and she was born in the middle of July!|`|80VUGXNIaa	yes|`|z4blIUneaa	i dont think so?
Xn2BCV8Kaa	if you can remember when in febuary ur period started. (the first day) <br>  <br>  then take off two weeks, you'll have the start of your pregnancy there. <br>  <br>  as pregnancies are counted from the first day of your last period. <br>  <br>  <br>  failing that, your first scan will reveal all <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you were just spotting it's more likely that your last period was in january. Call them back and explain what happened in february. They'll maybe want to do an ultrasound.|`|VzLkSZ4faa	You probably concieved in jan. You would have to count from<br>   the first day of your last full period which I'm thinking was in jan. So you are about 2 months along|`|3F8XBNDNaa	Hi, it sounds like that 'period' you had was implantation bleeding. Many women early in pregnancy get very light spotting or even heavier bleeding (more like a proper period) for anything up to around 5-6 months. The fact you had a faint but positive test line indicates that that was just implantation bleeding, as your doctor has now confirmed that you definitely are pregnant. I would talk to your midwife or GP and explain your experience and give them the date of your period before the spotting happened. This is probably a more likely date.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	You won't know the actual number until your dating scan.<br>  They use your last period as a guesstimate. <br>  When I was pregnant they guesstimated date was 3-12-06, then at my dating scan it was 11-12-06. I had my daughter on 12-12-06.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your pregnancy, it is the best feeling in the world.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Clear blue digital tells you I think that after you take the test you should keep count.

I would go off the 1st day in Feb that you started spotting. Thats what they did with me.|`|BZ5x4gyQaa	i reckon your about 5 or 6 weeks
OCk7I8JVaa	Sorry, I think you are just going to have to grin and bear it. Try lots of hot liquids/ decaf tea (though be careful of herbals) and orange juice. Make sure you stay hydrated and stay in bed as much as you can. Keep taking your temperature- if it goes over 100 degrees then pay a visit to your doctor to see if there is something he can give you (I'm not sure if he would tell you to take aspirin or tylenol but don't take anything without his ok)<br>  what i find really helps is vicks vapor rub. I used it a couple of months ago when I had a cold because I was afraid to use meds in case I was pregnant- it really does help.<br>  Feel better soon.|`|fTd509Qzaa	pretty much nothing.  the only thing that might help a little is regualr tylenol.  You can take robitussin and sudafed,  But I try not to take any of these at all while pregnant.  If you can stand it, take nothing.  Better for the baby.  If not, put a call into the Dr. and see what he/she recommends.|`|Y2fr8jp8aa	try vaporrub instead and other herbal methods|`|5yAsj29Vaa	DO NOT TAKE THERAFLU!  (it even says on the box not to if you're pregnant!!!)  <br>  You need to see your Dr. before taking anything!!!  <br>  For now, plenty of rest, juice, and chicken soup!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Mix chopped raw garlic with honey and eat it a spoonful at a time throughout the day, if taken for a couple of days as directed it will kill anything that is making you sick. Garlic is an anti-viral, antibiotic (it's called russian penicillin) and anti-fungal. <br>  I've been doing this for the past five years and I haven't been to the Doc or ER for a flu, cold or infection. Good luck.<br>  Medicinal amounts ok garlic are okay for you and the baby, I had to do this for three days when my husband brought a cold home from work when I was 21 wks pregnant.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	You're at that stage where taking things too early could possibly cause problems in the future, which is why doctors say to wait until after 12 weeks to take medication if it's necessary. Anyway, the paper I have from my OB/GYN says sudafed, Tylenol (not cold, just regular), and Robitussin with no alcohol is safe to take. Try drinking some warm tea maybe, or a warm bath. Drink plenty of fluids. Sorry, I know being sick sucks when you're pregnant! Hope you feel better.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	As far as medications go, I'd contact your doctor to be sure. I got a bad cold around 8-9 weeks and my doctor recommended I not take any medication since it was so early in the pregnancy. It lasted longer than it probably would have and it wasn't much fun solely drinking fluids, eating soup, and taking vitamin C, but it passed.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	Your doctor can call you in a prescription for a subasatory (not sure spelled right, but its a pill you stick up your butt) I had the flu in the beginning of my pregnancy and that what was called in for me.|`|AA10747002	Go to your doctor and get a flu shot.

oIyXMnmcaa	It would be inappropriate to send a youth to a adult prison no matter what their crime was. It would be like sending them to criminal college---they would be picked up and plucked by the meanest crews (men/gangs) and forced to live a life behind bars that includes gangs, stealing, drugs and sodomy. Why would you want to corrupt this youth further. I think the justice system does a great job here in Canada Ontario. For youth that have commited serious offenses they are put through a mediation program where they face the victims or families of their crimes and are forced to apologise and be re-habilitated into society without ever entering the adult prisons. If the youth dont coroperate then they are sent to prison to face thier sentace without ever having the chance for mediation again. Facilitors work with these youth to keep them out of court and wean them back into society succesfully. Now all this determined with extensive interviews and evaluations. I mean if these young offenders were to offend again, the system would be so leniet and they would spend their immature years in a youth facility and then sent to an adult prison when they become of age. <br>  <br>  Youth are youth and everyone is born pure so they learn and act what they see and experience...its a scary world out there and us adults, parents and community members are responsible for guiding them and teaching them proper values and morals. It is our job to keep them safe and not condem them for their crimes...not everyone is hopeless.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	When minors can do other adults things such as drive get a full time full paying job, watch adult material, indulge in other adult activities and don't need Mummy's permission for everything, then they should be tried as adults.<br>  <br>  If you want children to be treated like children, then that applies to everything, not just situations that will benefit adults.|`|5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	they should not be put in jail with adults because it is more dangerous for them to be there. but no they should get the same jail time but maybe in juve because then they will be with people there same size and can protect themselves i know it may not sound fair but even the adults int he prisons have a chance to protect themselves.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	des- you are an idiot.

j2mRop0laa	That's an amazing idea! I love it. <br>  Yes, my kids would participate. As a matter of fact, I have been shopping for a kitty stroller lately. I wish there was a pet parade so I could get some use out of it.<br>  <br>  Call the city of _____ wherever you live and get some information on how to start one. <br>  <br>  You could also do a Children's Parade section (like right after the pets) and judge the kids on best costumes relating to each years theme. Such as jungle animals, house pets etc.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I would think that would be so cool. My kids both get to march in annual parades as it is but one with animals I would like to see.|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i wouldn't mind them participating in an event like that. i do think i would like it more for them if i knew they were walking the parade for a good cause, say if money donated was sent to the local animal shelter, aspca, or a spay/neuter program. make sure the rules to register were that animals had to be up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered.  have it mandatory that an adult walked with the kid so if things did start to get out of control there is a stronger person that can help calm things down. we have great danes, i  know my kids couldn't calm them down if something happened but i could so i would be the one walking with the kids. just call the local law enforcement and also a veterinarian to ask for ways to do this and ways to prevent the unknown. the city most likely would be in charge due to legal issues but it is a good idea  to push if they won't allow you to do it on your own.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	That would be awesome to participate in though I doubt my cat would do the leash thing.

qRGIWiz6aa	I have taught my daughters that God is real. That the bible is truth, and that God loves us, through Jesus' death on the cross.  And from his death we can also see that he is not afraid to judge sin. The choices we make in life have good, and bad consequences. Treat others as you wish to be treated.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The golden rule, like yourself is the big one.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I agree. I teach ours that yelling, screaming, and crying doesn't work.

Some mothers I know just  buy their kids toys for no reason and I think that's so wrong.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	i haven't had my little girl yet she is due on the 14 of april but i would teach my child all of what you said, it is important to have manners and not to just expect that you get everything from wanting it and it is important to treat others how you want to be treated (to an extent) also sharing is important as well especially when they have sisters lol, i would also teach my children about stranger danger because that is very important especially when they are young girls at school.|`|6wR9QkAlaa	Well for a start I totally agree with you, your lessons are very good and definately what I would want my children to take heed of.<br>  <br>  I cannot abide by spoiled, manipulative children. That's something I would definately avoid letting develop in my child.<br>  <br>  It can be a toughie though. Because in my experience as a young adult the most interesting people I meet have nice parents that they get on with but have generally let te kids get on with their own thing...of course with the right guidance here and there but overall...<br>  <br>  My parents never ever did the whole "DO NOT SMOKE NO NOT DO DRUGS" I tried them, made my own choice. My mum even knows I smoked and tried weed and was very relaxed about it and I'm just not interested in doing either!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Being polite and having manners is important. To have integrity. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Stand up for what you think is right regardless of what others think. Help those that need it. Do not judge people or believe the judgments of others about a person. Not everything is what it seems. Play hard and be fair.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Erm let me think.<br>  <br>  1) If you don't respect others, they won't respect you.<br>  2) You were given words for a reason. Crying and whining won't get you what you want.<br>  3) Be polite. It doesn't cost anything to say please and thank you.<br>  4) Be considerate to others.|`|6nn7f41Faa	My kids are too young to start teaching them very much, but I teach my daughter to share when she has other kids around. I teach her that hitting is not an effective way to get what you want and she has to wait her turn.<br>  <br>  I plan to teach them that everyone is the same, even if they are different (and I'll explain this as they get older and can understand). I plan to teach them that you must give respect to get respect.

She's 16 months. She knows her ''please & thank yous'' & is grasping the concept of picking up her toys when she's finished with them, or they'll be put away for they rest of the day. I'm showing her how to use her fork, and how to hold it properly. She's not quite there yet. She holds it with her two hands, like she's holding a broom, and picks up her food with it. It's adorable to watch, because it looks so awkward !! <br>  <br>  She has respect for people, but she's still little. I can't really tell her how to have respect, but she is very considerate of people.|`|AA10236694	i teach him still @ 16 to always shake a person hand  when he meets them . to never call an adult by there first name. that all people are equal. to never make in fun of a person with a disability.

98WKYtfwaa	I've never heard of those pregnancy tests, but every pregnancy test is effective. <br>  <br>  Some peoples HCG never shows up on a pregnancy test until they get to 6/7months, this could be the same with you.<br>  <br>  You should get another blood test done since January 9th was a while back. If that's negative then you should get a ultrasound done just to be 100% sure you're not pregnant, if you're not pregnant then you should ask your doctor what could be wrong with you, not having your period since November is unusual.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Never heard off those go to doctors I think they do tests..|`|WokwBBGIaa	most pregnancy test are between 96% and 99% effective chances and blood test are very effective probably about 99.9% so the chances of 3 being wrong are very very low so dont worry u are not pregnant dont know what the issue is could be that u are under weight or a hormones inbalance im not a health professional so please take this with a pinch of salt im only speaking from personal experience as i suffer the same i rarely get my period and went though loads of tests|`|ltHKURBhaa	Hey i did like 6 hpt and all of mind came back neg i you my breast and nipples were realy sore and i now something was wrong i had to have a blood test did and it came back that i was pregnant you need to ask for a blood test it sounds like you are pregnant<br>  <br>  good luck
AA11537580	my sisters twins where born a month early and weighed about 2 1/2 pounds each<br>  they are 25 years old now<br>  and they are about 5 foot 4 , their mother is only 5 foot 1|`|hd4H38HSaa	My boys were basically "caught up" by 1 year. They are still small according to the charts, but my husband and I are both smaller people. Honestly though, they will grow when its time. I really would try not to worry about it. My sister was really tiny until she hit 13 and shot up a foot one summer. Now she's taller than my Dad. You just never know. I hope this helps!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Were they premies? If they were you don't start counted their milestones until after their 40 wk due date that could be throwing you off. They could be destined to hit many growth spurts in their teenage years catching up you that way. To optimize growth they should be taking some multi vitamins everyday.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I'm not a parent - but I am 10 years older than my younger twin sisters.<br>  They were born small, and stayed that way for some time.

But me, my mum and other sister and all shorties!
WIeCX71Daa	Oh my dear, sleep deprivation is a killer.<br>  <br>  Could your baby be teething? I have found with my kids if they are in pain, not lots and lots, but uncomfortable then they seem to be able to stay awake like they aren't tired. Give them a dose of baby paracetamol and half an hour later feed them and they sleep better (paracetamol doesn't have a sleep inducing property in it).<br>  <br>  When your baby wakes, does she want to play, or feed or is just awake? <br>  <br>  I agree that even if a baby has a full tum it doesn't stop them from waking and stuffing them full of cereal does nothing but back up their bowels and make them more cranky.<br>  <br>  Um, your baby could be hitting a developmental milestone and feels and needs less sleep at this time. They can last for a couple of weeks then turns into a habit.<br>  <br>  Or your baby could be going through separation anxiety and wakes constantly to be reassured that you are still there and you will go to her. If it turns out to be separation anxiety, you getting her all the time feeds her behaviour. I am in no way saying to do CIO. I have used it before, but have had to use a completely different approach for a different child. Think of your attention as a reward. Baby wakes up, no Mummy, sings out, Mummy comes, baby get rewarded for singing by having Mummy come to visit.  What you could do is gradually lengthen the time it takes you to respond to your daughter. She may get bored and go back to sleep by herself eventually.<br>  <br>  This may seem backwards, and you may get less sleep in the beginning, but hopefully eventually baby will get the hint that mummy plays during the day, night is for sleeping.<br>  <br>  Try to limit eye contact and noises when you go to your baby. It doesn't take much for kids to react to their caregivers attention. Night calm, limited attention, Day lots of fun and lots of Mummy cuddles.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  weaning wont fix the sleeping issue. The non sleeping is a seperate issue, you need to find out why your baby isn't sleeping. If you want to keep breast feeding, go ahead!!  My bets are on seperation anxiety especially seeing as you have returned to work.<br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if you need to vent!!|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Usually the first foods introduced are rice cereal and/ or Gerber baby yogurt.  Feeding her right before bed might actually be a bad idea.  You may wish to do it an hour or so before bed.  Oh, and breast milk is just as much food to the baby as formula is.  I breastfed also, and it was fine for my baby.  He got most of his nutrition from breast milk for the first nine to ten months before he really started eating on a regular basis.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	when they're teenagers....and even older, you won't get much sleep either. <br>  pacing the floor until they're home safe. you may go to bed, but you won't sleep until you hear his or her key in the door.<br>  i haven't slept in 23 years.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I'm right there with ya...my 7 month old has been doing the saaaame thing since we've started introducing solids.  I think a part of it has to do with some of the new things that he can do too.  Now that he's getting more mobile, he likes to scoot around in his crib, and when he wants to go back to sleep, sometimes he needs one of us, my husband or I to come in there and wrap him up again.  (He still likes to sleep swaddled even though he's huge! lol)  I do think that some of it may be the separation anxiety that I've read and heard about...and I agree with whoever else said that breastfeeding isn't the issue...and neither is stuffing the baby with rice cereal, the only thing that rice cereal and the other cereals really is, is to get the acclimated to new textures since none of them really have much of a taste.  Same thing with baby foods too...it's not to fill them up as much as it's to get them used to the texture and consistency and some flavors of new things.  You know?  But you are right, breastmilk is to be baby's main source of nutrition for at least a year, or formula.  It drives me insane to hear my MIL or my own mom thinking that it's because he's still hungry and should be fed more cereal or blah blah blah....old|`|qGmzJQciaa	Hi, first thing is soon as baby is a sleep put her back in crib i have five children and have breastfed them all made the mistake with last child  of trying to feed and sleep like you and she carried on till she was nearly 2 years old, do just try giving her a couple of spoons baby rice last feed before bed and try introducing a bottle of follow on milk before bed to give your self a brake , you need to eat well and rest if baby feeding constantly she's taking everything from you also it doesn't matter if you let her cry for a while try few minutes and then a bit longer next you may just find she might fall back of to sleep .<br>  good luck.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I just went through this with my 6 month old.  She went from sleeping all night to waking every 2 hours. I thought it was teething but after a month I figured out that it was not.  I read the"No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley and a lot of the techniques really  helped my daughter.  Not all of them worked of course, but a lot of them did.  She is now sleeping 9-10 hours through the night agian.<br>  <br>  She may be teething, have you tried giving anything before she goes to bed for pain?  <br>  <br>  I know it is hard, and I hope it gets better for you.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	You should talk to your pediatrician to see what he/she thinks may be the issue. At 7 months, most babies I knew were sleeping at least 6 hours before waking for a feeding. Maybe she isn't getting enough breast milk from you during the night so she wakes. Or maybe she isn't hungry at all. She just simply wakes up and doesn't know how to sooth herself back to sleep so she cries, waking you and you thinking she is hungry get up with her. <br>  I will say my kids did start to sleep for longer periods once I introduced cereal into their diet, but that could have been a coincidence. I didn't feed them the rice (to me it looked like glue) I did give them oatmeal and barley.
kSZx9cY5aa	Some of my favourite parties we've thrown for my kids would be...<br>  My 5yo's 4th birthday. We had water guns, water balloons, cupcake and cookie decorating, pinatas, musical chairs, a treasure hunt, a mini volleyball match and my daughter led them in a big story time thing and activities-she was so good at it 2 seperate moms who didn't realise we were related asked where I hired her haha. Simple but tons of fun! <br>  My 3yo sonsbirthday last month. All our cousins and aunts and uncles, and his friends came down to a great animal nursery. We booked it out for 3 hours and it was great fun! They got to run aroundand play with baby goats, sheep and dear, feed cows and their calfs, pet a pig, have pony and donkey rides, hold rabbits, guinea pigs, ducklings and birds and we finished the day with a BBQ and some activities. The grown ups loved it too!<br>  My 15yo daughters last birthday was also a lot of fun. I took her and 3 of her closet girlfriends to Las Vegas for a weekend and hired out 2 hotel rooms. They spent 3 days shopping, swimming, dancing, sunbaking, bowling, watching music and more shopping.<br>  Her halloween party for her 14th birthday was fun too! (Her birthday is in october).<br>  One party my boys went to that I loved was a pirate party. They were all given costumes and make up to wear and they hadso many elaborateactivities, it was amazing!!!<br>  For my last birthday my daughter managed to get a nightclub shutdown to everyone but us for a night (how crazy is it, when you have a 15yo who can do that haha) and her and my hubby and my friends arranged to throw me a surprise party there with about 50 of my friends. It was a blast!!! One of the best birthdays i've ever had :)<br>  <br>  How much do you love birthdays??? :)|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	We usually have the regular party at home thing for our kids, with the games and food, or do the indoor play centre thing.<br>  However, the favourite party was one my middle son was invited to last year. It was at a "ranch" and the kids got to ride horses, go on the water pedal boats, play with the animals at the animal nursery, indoor golf, as well as the party food. The kids had an absolute ball, it was a fantastic party idea. I had heard of the place, but never actually been there until then. Might have to have the same party for him this year!<br>  Hope they had a great day today!
AA11659150	Call your doctor right now... Mine said that anything more than every 10 mins for 2 hrs (so 6 or more per hour) was something that warranted her attention.<br>  <br>  Also, try drinking some water.  Are you dehydrated?  If you go to the ER they are going to hook you up to a monitor and start IV fluids in case that is the cause.  I'd start chugging and see if that alleviates it.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that those early contractions are very easily confused with BH and not neccesarily that painful.  (Obviously, that changes, but you don't want to wait too long to get checked.)<br>  <br>  Also, not to insult your intelligence, but you are supposed to count them from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next one.  Just make sure you are counting correctly.  :)  GL and try to keep that little thing in there a little longer!!!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Tell your doctor.|`|v3LnJycKaa	first drink 2 large glasses of water, occasionally we wil get "over the top" braxton hicks (a contraction that does not cause cervical change is a BH contraction) when we are dehydrated, it is often refered to as uterine irritability, try to rest and relax by laying on your left side, to get optimum blood flow to the uterus, you may need a few more glasses of water... this shoul dhelp them taper off, if they get stronger or closer together you will need to call you dr, but start here.|`|SRzswqTeaa	Hopefully they have stopped by now (it's been an hours since this was posted).  If they have not, I hope you have been in touch with your doctor/midwife.  Anytime you have more than 6 an hour, you should lay down drink a tall glass of water, and see if they keep coming.  If you have another 4-6 contractions you should call - if you are before 37 weeks pregnant.  (which you are).. especially since your contractions are lasting about a minute, which means they are bit more serious.  They do NOT have to be painful, and they can cause you to dilate when you are this early.  good luck :-)|`|uuHPneEcaa	it could just be braxton hicks contractions. But If i where u I would call the doctor and let them know whats going on. I am sure its nothing but i would just call and make sure. don't worry or stress ur self out over this okay.<br>  <br>  I am sure if they where real contractions u would be in alot of pain|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I would call the doctor. It may be nothing, but I was just at my doctors yesterday (I am 32 weeks pregnant) and she told me that if I am getting more than 6 contractions an hour that is too much and to call them.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	If they were true contractions you would be in alot of pain, I think you are have braxton hicks which those get your body realy for the birth process.|`|eYVv3kSXaa	you should go to the doctor because i never had that 33 weeks i think you should go to the doctor or call him or something that is what you should do|`|LGlj9YRuaa	I think you should go and get checked out, just to be on the safe side. Also it will put your mind at rest. Ooh it is an exciting time. <br>  <br>  Take care of yourself and Good Luck.|`|A9nBzN3Daa	REAL contractions are when your whole belly is tight all over.   good luck and call your doctor anyway to be safe.|`|YUWXuP5iaa	Drink a large glass of cold water and lay on your left side for an hour and see if they go away...if not then you need to let your Dr. know.|`|fTd509Qzaa	could be false labor, but best to call the Dr. or just go to ER to be sure.

I know how you feel. I felt angry too at all the people who get pregnant and don't want to. My husband and i had been married for 4 years and my brother in law and his new wife had only been married 4 months and were trying. I knew if they got pregnant I wouldn't be able to handle it. I prayed every night please don't let them get pregnant before me b/c I really don't think I can handle it. I'm a big believer in God will not give you more than you can handle. Well, I finally got pregnant January '08. My in-laws got pregnant too and were due 2 weeks after us. <br>  I know it's very frustrating but there are other options. All those 14 year olds that get pregnant and don't want their babies, a lot of them give them up for adoption. God lets those people have babies when then shouldn't so that people that can't have babies on their own still get to have a child. I know the pain of wanting your own. Never give up trying, but if you do have such a low chance, think about the other options available to you. Find what is best for you. You will have your baby one way or another some day.  God Bless and truckloads of baby dust to you!!!!|`|h7i9Ngu9aa	aww babe loads of baby dust for you!! im so sorry to read about u situation, i am with u 100% on all these young girls who have babies they should not take their luck for granted a baby is a honor n parenting is a privilege i will pray for you to have u wish and become a mother very soon chick take care n try try try<br>  <br>  <br>  baby dust baby dust baby dust|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	first i'm sorry that has to be hard and second relax and stop trying oh that didn't come out right just relax the more you try the harder time you will have stress can pronloge getting pregant, try some of these things the worked for me after sex lay in bed for 20 minutes on your back, and don't have sex with the same guy all the time like wait a week than do it all day because a man sperm builds up pressure and when he have sex it release and sperm can travel faster and try to do it around say 3 days to 2 days before your period and than not again till the day after and each day than for 3-4 days you are most fertile right after your period i got pregnant with my first day after and with my second like 2 days so it depends, check your temp the cheap way get a glass teromater and place it in the vaginal make sure you can hold on to it wait 3-4 minute high temp means you are ovalutaing and relax don't think about it just make love and forget that your even trying and with a little luck you will be a mom,  and i pray it works out for you|`|tdHIR9cLaa	im so sorry you are going through this.... there was a girl in my home town that went through "the change" when she was 20 also.... all i can say is TRY TRY TRY...BABY DUST DUST DUST...<br>  <br>  <br>  I will pray for you... i really hope you get to have a baby... and yes those little girls should realize how lucky they truly are!!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|qfuhHeDjaa	is there ANYTHING they can do? harvest your eggs before its too late?! i dont understand enough... but anyhoot, you can have all my dust!!! we arent using it any time soon! *~*~*~baby dust~*~*~*
AA11885437	I have a 16 month old and a 2 week old. When I'm nursing, my daughter is content to just be nearby. Or I can read her a book while nursing or turn the tv on and let her play with the remote. I'm not one for letting babies watch tv, but she doesn't really watch anything she just likes to push the buttons on the remote and see what happens. It keeps her occupied at any rate :) I have hubby home right now, but when he leaves I plan to shower while my daughter is napping and put my son (the newborn) strapped in a bouncy chair on the bathroom floor. Cleaning will probably be done between naps or with my son in his sling.My daughter is happy if I give her the duster and let her "dust" while I clean too. but I get the most done while she is sleeping.  I also have a play gate that is about 16 sq feet in my living room that keeps my toddler safely contained when need be. All her toys are in there and we call it her play place. Its a bit bigger than a play pen and she comes and goes as she pleases for the most part, so when I need to shut the gate she doesn't really mind or even notice. So far my newborn sleeps a good majority of the time, so we'll see what happens in a few weeks when he starts to perk up. I find it helps to include my daughter when doing things like changing diapers etc. I'll say, brother has a stinky.. lets go change him! and she loves to come with me and watch and "help" by handing me his diaper. I dont know what to tell you about sleeping arrangements, but I had a friend who just let both her kids pile in. My only thought on that is to maybe keep the new baby between you and the wall and the toddler in the middle between you and dad. Good luck with everything! It will be tough at first but you'll find your rhythm before too long and things will start to flow. I'm sure your children will grow up best friends, being so close in age! I think thats one of the perks to having them close, built in playmate!|`|6fiYhtACaa	You seem very organized so I would loosen up on the whole schedule thing because trying to schedule everything can quickly unravel with two kids and just create more stress. I wouldn't know personally (yet) but my sister has two 21 months apart and gave up on the schedule thing for a while. She took each day as it came until her near two year old adjusted to being bumped out of the spotlight. It wasn't easy at first but gradually she got them on similar shedules and her household seems to be harmonizing once again. But I guess it will all depend on their personalities. Two little boys might equal twin tornadoes or if they're laid back it may not be such a big deal. This may sound like a very tired expression but I guess you'll just have to take each day as it comes. Good luck.|`|Kl0ZxAW2aa	I wouldn't know what to do either..LOL<br>  <br>  But I read in the magazine, when both your babies cry at the same time..<br>  tend to the older one first. The older one remembers but the newborn baby doesn't...<br>  <br>  Good Luck..|`|Xu1lG9Dcaa	Hunny, buy a Sling/Carrier. They are life savers.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	theres a bigger gap i age between my two but you may have to accept that your schedule may be turned upside down! ya just kinda gotta go with the flow for the first few weeks and eventually youll settle into a new routine, dont be too hard on yourself <br>  <br>  if your nursing and he wants to be held can he sit next to you i dont know if you have a specific place oyu like to nurse, i liked my rocking chair at first but that didnt let the older one sit next to me. <br>  <br>  are you against your older one coming into the shower with you, maybe give him some toys to play with at the other end of the tub?
wENdWT5kaa	I think as long as they have clean and decent clothes on their back, they should be happy. <br>  <br>  What is so wrong with Wal-Mart? really, cause they have Peneman on their tag instead of Old Navy??? <br>  <br>  Young kids today are just to worried about fitting in. They'd rather fit in by the clothes they wear instead of who they are. <br>  <br>  I think your way is good tho. There is nothing wrong letting your daughter have one thing that she wants. But young people today, don't need Old Navy or any other famous labels to fit in.|`|vGxipYJnaa	They can let their kids pick out some clothes and follow fashion but I think it's an important lesson that looks aren't everything and clothes don't make you a better person. <br>  <br>  Maybe that girl's mother can't afford anything but Wal-Mart - the girl should have been grateful that she isn't wearing second hand clothes.|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	my parents dont know 2 s.hits about fashion, but then again i dont either. my wardrobe consists of soccer jerseys <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmrKWD1CKDXdqfgZTnf8crjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307052857AAa1i9n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|pDZomZqraa	I can understand both sides.

17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Yes, the clots you describe are very nornal.   <br>  <br>  "I never bleed over night so could it be that my period is just clotting inside becuase its not bleeing out propperly"  -- yes this is probably what's happening.  you are lying down so the blood does not flow out so it clots more.
3EhoJ42zaa	I had high blood pressure, it was pregnancy induced hypertension (it basically means the pregnancy caused it).  Then it developed into preeclampsia and the preeclampsia kept my blood pressure very high.  I ate healthy, exercised regularly, avoided salt, stayed well hydrated, and I still got the high blood pressure during pregnancy.  Pregnancy can do some weird things to your body sometimes.  It can also be a genetics thing as well.  All the women on my dads family have suffered from pregnancy induced hypertension or preeclampsia whenever they were pregnant.  Sure enough I was one of the lucky ones as well.|`|23YPEAqBaa	Never had high bp till the very end of both my pregnancies - pre-eclampsia and bed rest in the final month, they said.  I was also in my 30s.  After the first birth, my bp went down and stayed normal without medication.  After the second birth 4 years later, bp stayed up and I've been on low dose medication since.|`|xy5UNiELaa	I don't have high BP but there are a few causes.  Stress, high sodium intake, high BP pre-pregnancy, family history, immune disorder, biochemical factors, diabetes, or just the pregnancy its self.  The list goes on.  Sometimes it just happens.|`|MyIy9M9Iaa	too much salt intake.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	My blood pressure was fine through my Pregnancy with my Daughter. Then I started having breathing problems at 35 weeks and a burning in my upper tummy. I called the doctor and he dismissed it. My Husband got irritated and brought me to the E.R. The put me in the L&D section, my BP was 210/100. The Doctor was in my room in an 1/2 hour. I had developed severe pre-ecalmpsia. I was induced and she was born 18 hours later. My other pregnancies my BP was fine.
AA12228565	Wait until after March 2 and then test.  Yes, very possible you got a false negative.  Good Luck and if so you baby will be due around  November 9th. <br>  I ovulated on the 23.  Hopefully this is my month too can't test until the 11th.  Hopefully on November 18th I'll be a mom!!!|`|xy5UNiELaa	I took HPTs at 7 and 9 days late...negative.  I didn't get my positive until I was 13 days late.  There's still a chance.  Good luck!|`|kSH2Pzhhaa	False negatives are a lot more common than false positives, so it's very possible.<br>  The only thing though is that is your cycle 100% accurate every time or is it wonky? Those things alone are enough to throw you off of your ovulation date.<br>  I would just wait until you actually miss a period and then take another test just to be sure.<br>  Good luck!|`|plI0WOrUaa	You could have got a false neg.  Its not 100% before your period is due.  I would wait a couple more days until you are due and test again.  There's still a chance that you could be pregnant.  I got a positive 5days before my period.  I don't think that's very common because even my doctor didn't believe that I got a positive that fast! lol|`|23f6eef28bdd237d6c15276e35e40c82aa	If you can't figure out the answer to this, you probably shouldn't be trying for a baby.  The instructions are very clear in the box of what the percentage of accuracy is based LMP.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	it's probably too early for an hpt to detect it, i waited a week after my missed period to take the test|`|9tQvqBwMaa	You probably took it to early. Your pregnancy hormones have to build up enough to register on the test as a positive. Give it a few more days and test again. Remember, a watched pot never boils. I know its hard waiting but its what your gonna have to do. Good Luck!|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	hi it depends on how high your hormone level is. you might be, or not. is it the early response you took, if so, just wait until your period is due, for the most accurate result. good luck.
vnJG8UYJaa	I understand your frustration with this situation.  I give one on one aide to students at the HS level who deal with these frustrations every day.<br>  No, I would not give my child up to foster care.  I do not believe that foster parents are screened as closely as they need to be.  They also do not have any training in how to handle a child like this.  <br>  <br>  You do not say what state that you live in and that definitely makes a difference in what kind of aid is available.  Start at your doctor's office.  Has your child been checked for food allergies?  This is the number one cause of a lot of behaviorial situations.  You can check with counselling services and social services agencies.<br>  <br>  In Ohio, we have special schools for children with disabilities.  Parents such as yourself, over look these schools because we presume they are for children who are both physically and mentally handicapped.  They run pre-school programs for children who need to have help at the pre-school level.  <br>  <br>  I am going to tell you that your son needs consistancy more than anything right now.  He needs to know that breakfast is at 7 every morning and bath time is at 7 every night.  This will help him to build trust in his surroundings.  A lot of day care situations do not provide this because different people are coming and going all the time.  In his world, that creates confusion and causes him to be angry and frustrated.  <br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you he needs discipline.  What he needs is re-enforcement.  Set up a certain routine.  Pick 3 situtations that you want to work on.  For instance, picking up his toys.  Make sure that you sit near him while he is cleaning up.  Divide the clean up into 3 parts.  When he gets the first part done, give him a break.  Color a picture.  When he gets the second part done, give him another break. Share a popsicle.  When he gets the 3rd part done, celebrate!  After he starts accomplishing this, divide it into 2 parts instead of 3 and follow the same procedure.  Lots of re-enforcment with hugs and cuddle time, stories and such.  Once you help him through his frustrations, the anger won't be an issue anymore.  <br>  <br>  You do need to provide time and space for him to get his energy out.  You are not going to talk a pre-school child into sitting down all day.  <br>  <br>  You are in a very tough situation.  It is difficult for any single mom to work and provide a strong, consistent environment for their child, but it can be done.  <br>  <br>  If you insist that he have one on one care now, it will be hard to withdraw him from that later and he will need it all through school.  It is much better to start teaching him how to deal with things when he is frustrated.  You hold the key to his world.  Please do not throw that key away.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	Yes, you have to do what is best for him. Did a county social worker offer a foster plan?  Can you preserve your relationship with him by visiting nights and weekends?  I believe that not all young kids are suited to group care.  I am not a child care professional but I am mum of 3 and when mine were in group care I saw other kids who took all the "teachers" energy/attention and needed the kind of care you seek for your child.  Bless you for seeking the best for your child's needs!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Call your state welfare office and see what they have to offer and if you qualify for any assistance. You may also contact the YMCA or United Way or BigBrothers/Big Sisters and see if there are any programs in your area. <br>  Research ADHD to find out if there are any programs in your area. I'm sure there are sites that offer tips on coping and activities you can do to engage him and help him<br>  I don't doubt that at times you are at witts end, but giving up your child shouldn't even be an option unless you felt like you may harm them in some way.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	If your child does ok in school, then he should do ok in a structured child care environment and obviously doesn't need a one on one caregiver. Daycare is not that much different than school. How does the teacher handle him in class?<br>  <br>  I don't mean to offend you, but you can't rely on spirits to help you and your child, you are going to have to do it yourself. His therapist should work closely with the school and daycare and you with behavior modification plans. My sons therapist did when be was having problems with his OCD. I'm not a big fan of medications, but if your child is truly having that much problems, perhaps he is in the range that it becomes necessary. Again, his therapist should be working with you to make those decisions. <br>  <br>  Talk to the therapist and the school and work on finding a new daycare that will work with you. When my son had problems, I spoke to his daycare and they were very understanding when I explained he was seeing a therapist and we were working hard to help him. Maybe an in-home person would be better for him. See what the therapist thinks. <br>  <br>  If you truly think that a foster home would be best for him, then maybe you are at your limit dealing with it. Maybe you should see a therapist too, to help with your own stress. He's not going to get the attention, <br>  love, caring, and understanding he needs in a foster care environment.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you, but it's possible. Just get the help you need for him and yourself too.|`|Oxbq2uJtaa	There are psychologists that not only work with the children but with the adults, the caregivers, I am surprised you are not receiving this help if he is.  Most want to counsel the parents too.  Coping is big, a support group also helps, friends help but you must have some coping skills and use them consistently with calm at your center.  I know it is hard to pay the bills.  There should be assistance for his needs if he is diagnosed correctly.  And you should take him to more than one certified Psychologist who works with children, a pediatric psychologist if you are in Ohio you can find them.  Call the insurance companies to ask for one, even if it is not your insurance company.  Talk about a payment plan, explain your desperation of being to the point of giving him up perhaps they will work with you.  Leaving your care will be traumatic, and yet if you are always frustrated and do not have calm, focused composure in coping with his energy this can be a lengthy trauma as well. When you are at your wits end, professional and more second opinion professional help is the best you can do.   I will pray for you and your son.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I can honestly say, no, I would never give up my children to foster care. I had six years of raising my children by myself (3 sons) and could never have done that. That is me. <br>  <br>  What you choose to do, however, is a different story. If you honestly feel that putting your child into foster care may very well be what's best then, as much as I do not wish to say this, do it.<br>  <br>  However, if you have not looked into other options first here is one that helped me, the state paid for child care for me to work or attend classes. I believe the state even pays a little extra for a special help for "disabled" children (from what you say you maybe able to file for disability for your son to help offset the expense of a specialized aide for him). Look into these two options first. Maybe they may even be able to help you find more options.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I would do what I felt was best for my child, bearing in mind the fact that he might be traumatized by going into foster care.

wNtW1hXLaa	I am proud to say that i have been breastfeeding for 3 months now. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to embark upon but at the same time the most natural. It was not something I ever thought about doing or not doing before I was a mum. Just tonight I was thinking how much i enjoy it (although i never thought i would say that in the beginning - lol!), especially looking down at my beautiful baby while she is drowsily feeding. My mum who didn't even attempt to breastfeed me told me the other day that she couldn't believe i was considering continuing to 6 months. In fact I plan to go for as long as I can and will take it as it comes. She also makes negative judgements about a friend of mine who is still breastfeeding her 14 month old.  I know deep down she is proud of what I am doing but I really wish she would shut up about it just as I have shut up about her decision not to even try to breastfeed her 2 kids. I put my foot down and defended my friend and my stance and I think she got the message. I don't think she quite understands the weaning process having never gone through it herself. Keep up the amazing work!!|`|GrZTwERlaa	i breastfed for 12 months, i had every joe dick and harry ask me when i was weening and give their judgmental opinions.<br>  I would simply reply that i am giving my daughter the best care and feed i can possibly give her and when my daughter and i decide to wean it will be our business.<br>  Stay strong girl cause you will have everyone down on you...i even had my doctor try to get me to stop as he wanted me to change some medications and i'm like "the ones i am on are ok until i stop feeding"|`|7XQwpBVaaa	Tell her you think it is weird that anyone would want to quit breastfeeding before the baby is a year old. <br>  People need to get over the breastfeeding thing!  It is a great, natural thing to do and I would advise any first time mother to at least try it but if it is something you don't want to do for some reason or another that is okay too.  <br>  Why do women love to make other women insecure?|`|0HnXdI04aa	Wow ! People really should be more sensitive to<br>  personal issues like this, It is ultimately your decision to make,<br>  and it is known that breast milk is full of wonderful and needed<br>  ingredients that boost the child's immune system. you will know when the right time to discontinue is, I am sure every woman knows when.<br>  almost sounds like a envy problem or something ?|`|73nSUKNKaa	Tell them they have no right to tell you how to raise a child, and if they still persist, avoid talking to them for awhile. Don't let their persistent thoughts get to your head, you know how to raise a child and only You can do it right.|`|ybexjS2Paa	Wow that's something new, usually you hear "WHY did you stop breastfeeding?!"  Your sister in low is weird herself for saying that, I've never heard that feeding longer than 6 months is "weird". You feed as long as you want and can. It's your child, your breasts and your milk :) Period|`|dnLL4J71aa	i plan to keep breastfeeding as long as my son wants to, whether that be 12 months or 5 years. my aunt told me that was disguisting so i just told her not to breastfeed her children that long. its a personal choice between the mother and child.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I just grin and bear it. I'd like to breastfeed my daughter as long as possible - but i've been told i'm gross for doing so. People are amazed i've been BF for 7 weeks, because they would've stopped "a lot sooner". At the end of the day, she's MY daughter, I will do what I want regarding her so they can tell me it's gross til they're blue in the face but it won't change anything.|`|PPA30E8naa	Surely it's unnatural to whack a baby on solids|`|a96880bf5ffe6feb382113fc36cc3e9daa	This attitude is so old-fashioned and rude that you don’t have to be polite.<br>  Tell them that it is old-fashioned and that it is not your problem if other people are or were not so fortunate as to keep on feeding their babies as long as they were willing to do it, i.e.the longest possible.<br>  Defend your position with pride, we’re all behind you!|`|vz1gmSM7aa	Do what makes you happy.  It's only your sister's opinion.  It's your child and you can breast feed as long as you want to.

I'm just really blunt about it. If it makes sense I just answer in a way that sounds like, "That's the way it is, and that's the way it's going to be" If someone tells you that it's wrong, I would just spout out all the facts/research done on it and how it's the best way to feed your baby. Tell your sister in law that you'd rather wait to feed your child solids when he's able to at least sit up by himself and has the proper digestive system to handle it. If nothing else, start interrogating her on how she takes care of her kids. I wouldn't be surprised if she even has kids (haha, does she?) It seems like the people who are judgmental like that have no experience with having a child of their own. They think there is one right way to do things and everything will be solved.

C4ibOR7Laa	you hardly had any pee?<br>  i always just fill up a little cup and dip it in there<br>  <br>  the test should have been positive by now, i mean you must be over 2 weeks late, this could be something more, id go and see a doctor|`|5LzZYrQnaa	you still could be there may just not have been enough on the test to detect the levels in your pee wait a few days and test again make sure you really have to pee when you take the test|`|GrZTwERlaa	you could still be pregnant. my first test was negative and i was sure i was preggo aswell, i waited another week and then took another one and i was pregnant. So have a chat to your doctor and he/she can do tests to see why you are not mentruating....hopefully you are preggo but if your not at least he can find out what is wrong so you can fall pregnant in the future!|`|hT0frTVZaa	You can take another test right now to make sure the first one wasn't faulty and see what it does, sometimes people take those urine tests and come up negative when your really pregnant. The most accurate test you can have is a blood test. But there are other reasons why you wouldn't get your period like stress, weather change, medications.

7XBoIgd6aa	It's to the extent that the mother takes it that could be considered abuse. Dressing a kid up every once in awhile for a small pageant isn't abuse and can be fun. But doing what the women do on the new pageant reality shows is to the extreme and I believe borders abuse|`|aOCfLAJJaa	They FORCE girls to do things that they don't want to and give them some serious mental/vanity issues.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i don't like kid pageant, but i don't think it consider abuse because it doesn't put the child in any physical harm, and i know some girls actually like lt.  However, those moms who enjoys putting fake eyelashes on a 3 years old, and "spray paint" their skin are just weird.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I've heard of cosmetic surgery being forced on young girls to correct "flaws" that hinder their scores. It's not legal in the US, but take your kid South of the Border, and anything can be had...for a price.  Since the young will continue to grow and develop, early plastic surgery can lead to them being deformed facially later in life, unless they have a "tune up" every ten years.<br>  <br>  Who would do allow elective surgery on their child, for a rhinestone tiara and a sash?|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I've seen a couple of pageants on TV. The little girls look so horrible. One of the judges actually said "We like the whole glitter and glammer over natural beauty". I guess if the kid is having fun then it's fine, but I have a feeling that even if they wanted to quit, their moms would not let them.<br>  <br>  I don't really think it's abuse. But I do think it's weird. I don't see how those little girls win. Honestly...they look ugly. They would look so cute without the pounds of makeup, fake teeth and hair extensions.|`|HK30PzNraa	Abuse no,sad yes.Also it is almost an invitation to pedophiles.Let kids be little for goodness sakes.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	No i don't consider it abuse.

6XpYk69Gaa	Typically, infants should have at least one BM a day. Have you tried adult apple juice, (not the kind sold in the baby food aisle), possibly an 8 oz bottle, 6 oz of juice with 2 oz of water?<br>  <br>  For most infants, that will clear it right up. Otherwise, I'd say continue what you're doing. It's a positive sign that your son isn't in any visible pain. I would still talk to the pediatrician and see what's going on. The doctor might look at what kind of food he's been eating, and possibly take a stool sample. The same thing happened to me with my 10 months old when she first had oatmeal!|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	call the pramacy  there is a lax you can give him  not sure been so longs  Colace i think is what is is called you place it in the but for a few minutes and poop  my daughter had to use them when she was little they are only like 4-5 dollars for 10 of them|`|VRSUyeqbaa	yes, you need to worry about it. have you tried giving him water? he may be dehydrated.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Here are some things to try:<br>  <br>  ?  Get her some exercise. If your baby's a crawler, encourage her to do a few laps. If she's not crawling yet, try pumping her legs: While she's lying on her back, gently move her legs in a forward, circular motion as if she were pedaling a bicycle.<br>  <br>  ?  Massage your baby's belly. Measure three finger-widths below her navel and apply gentle but firm pressure with your fingertips. Press until you feel a firmness or mass. Maintain gentle but constant pressure for about three minutes.<br>  <br>  ?  If you feed your baby formula, ask her doctor about switching to a different brand. Some babies are less constipated on soy formula. And sometimes adding a teaspoon of Karo corn syrup to the formula also does the trick.<br>  <br>  ?  Switch from rice cereal to barley or oat cereal, or add pureed fruits or vegetables to her regular cereal, once your baby is ready for them. Read about what foods to introduce when.<br>  <br>  ?  Once your baby is eating a variety of solid foods, ask her doctor if you can boost her fiber intake by adding a teaspoon of bran to her cereal. Cut down on constipating foods like rice, bananas, and cooked carrots, and try mixing her cereal with a little bit of apple or prune juice or a few tablespoons of pureed prunes, apricots, or pears to help loosen her bowel movements.<br>  <br>  ?  Increase the amount of fluid your baby drinks to help keep her stools soft. If your baby is older than 2 months, start by giving her 1 ounce of prune juice diluted with 1 ounce of water, twice a day. As her constipation improves, you can cut back. Talk with the doctor first if your baby is 2 months old or younger.<br>  <br>  ?  Talk to your baby's doctor about treatment options. Ask about using an over-the-counter stool softener to make bowel movements more comfortable for your baby, but never give your baby a laxative without her doctor's approval. The doctor may also suggest you try a glycerin suppository if your baby is severely constipated. The suppository will stimulate the rectum and help her pass a stool. While using a suppository occasionally is fine, don't do it on a regular basis, since your baby could wind up relying on them to have a bowel movement.<br>  <br>  ?  If your baby is passing such hard, dry stools that she tears the delicate skin near the opening of her anus (you may be able to see these tears, known as anal fissures, or a little blood), you can apply some aloe vera lotion to the area to help it heal. Be sure to mention the tears to your baby's doctor.|`|AA10648369	My son has chronic constipation! It is NOT fun! If your son is not displaying any discomfort, I would not be too concerned, but still keep an eye on him. As stated my a previous poster, there are OTC Suppositories (SP?) which do help. When my son is straining at all, we go right to a suppository because otherwise we have issues. They are great! There has only been one time (when he was really backed up) that we actually had to use two, otherwise, just one gets the job done, and he is a much happier boy!|`|kPcJmuiZaa	when my daughter was constipated and was straining it really helps them to rub there belly or to bear down onto it a little not to hard and what my health visitor told me which i dont agree with doing but it works apperntly is to get some baby lotion round the bum get a cotton bud and rub it just on the outside of his hole the lotion will help it come out :S good luck to him :D|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would keep giving him more juice. If it isn't bothering him then I would wait it out, you can also try to give him a suppository which are available in the pharmacy section and safe for babies. You could call up to the hospital and talk to a on call doctor.|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Try pedilyte and message is stomach.
fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Our pediatrician told us to wait until our son was 3 yrs old. He's 12 months now and he has 8 teeth. I brush his teeth twice a day. I thought it should be sooner than 3, but by the looks of these answers, maybe that's correct. We have a hard time showing his teeth too. He hates to open up lol. Good luck|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Our dentist told us to bring our daughter in for her first appointment after she turns 3 years old.  Unless she has an accident where she chips or loses a tooth, complaining of tooth pain or something along those lines, they really don't need to see her and to just make sure she brushes daily.<br>  <br>  *Each dentist is different so if you have a family dentist you can always consult with them|`|AA11212578	Technically they don't need to go until 3.  Just make sure you brush AND floss (yes floss).    Use those little plastic floss thingys (they sort of looks like a archery bow with a handle).    Our son got a cavity between his molars (i.e. in a spot that the dentists usually don't x-ray when they are that young) when he was 4 and is now the proud owner of a crown.  That should be about 200 reasons there to floss your kids teeth...|`|HwIi9Tkwaa	Mine was 2 when I took him, I tried before then ans was told to wait until around two yrs old. x He is 4 now and still bites her fingers if he doesn't want to go.|`|D8vOpNWgaa	my son had to start a one month but that's b/c his mouth swelled b/c of how soon he was getting teeth. i would say age one for a check up and then its usally once a year till they start school. my son is fine going to the dentist they used flavored cloves when they did him so it was like he was tasting a banana and they used flavored tooth past too. he was fain and loves going to the dentist.|`|8AmMlAZYaa	some dentist and books say as soon as they start to get teeth just to get like a baseline and also to get them used to the dentist so they won't be so afraid when they do need to have a real exam. and I know about this one. one of my twins lost his mind the first time he saw the dentist|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	It depends who you ask...a pediatric dentist will tell you to have them in within 6 months of their first tooth coming in, a regular dentist will tell you age 3.  I took my son when he was 15 months.  I, too, was wondering how she was going to be able to do anything and much to my amazement she was able to look at all of his teeth and scrape off some tartar build-up.  Pediatric dentists have their tricks and my son didn't mind at all.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Most dentists wont see kids until they are at least two.  Both of my kids went when they were 2.
f29682f37e62ce0c97dbbcb7b4e7a137aa	Mall security is a joke.  They won't do much to help you.  I think if you go with a group a friends you should be OK.  <br>  <br>  Convincing your mom may be tough.  Ask her to go to the mall with you and a friend or two.  Tell her to go to a different store than you and meet her in an hour or two.  Do that a couple of times and BE ON TIME when you meet her.  After a few trips she may become more wiling to let you go.  Also, ask to take a cell phone in case you need to call her.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	When I was your age, my mom would drop me, my friend, and my two little brothers off at the mall to watch a movie, and come back six hours later to pick us up.<br>  <br>  ...and look how I turned out.  No wonder your mother is worried.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	well i would let you go to the mall with your friends but not totally alone. even with a bf id let you but hey what do i know im only 16:P i dont have kids:P|`|vGxipYJnaa	You sound like a responsible young lady. I'm a mother and I would let you go to the mall with a group of friends. It may help your mother to talk to one of your friend's moms so she can be reassured that you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  You know, it's weird for us moms when our kids don't need us anymore. You're by our side for many years then suddenly out alone and it's scary for us. Just make sure she knows you're fine. Send her a text every hour or so to let her know you're fine.|`|HclKftzAaa	I wont be letting my kids go to the shopping malls when they're that age. Young children should not be left to loiter. It'd be different if you were going for a specific reason, such as to go see a movie, or go to a restaurant, and then coming home after said event. But just 'hanging out' can be done at people's houses- where you wont bother people, or be bothered by people. And can be supervised.<br>  <br>  13 is still a child after all. And I wouldn't care what other parents let their children do, my child is my child and they should do as I say.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	no, it's too dangerous to do that.<br>  too many weirdos.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I wasn't allowed to until I got my license. It's not safe.|`|FiUprYsvaa	When I was 13 I was able to go to the mall alone. <br>  You sound like a smart kid. <br>  I think you should be given a chance. <br>  <br>  Just tell your mom that you feel you are smart enough and mature enough to go to the mall with just your friends. <br>  Tell her that you would love for her to trust you and let you try going with your friends just once.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Ask your mum because you sound responsible and if she says no (ask in advance) be really good and then when you helped her and impressed her with something (doing homework maybe) say can I go to the mall as if you never asked before and if she noticed you had been good she might say yes. Never know until you ask.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.x|`|s3FNGNVPaa	im 12 and im aloud to go by myself . you should be able to go by yourself and with your friends.|`|kD8iggyCaa	yea you are able t got to the mall with you friends.. tell your mother about all these.. but it is normal that your mother is being worried ofyou!|`|Ir3XPq4raa	It depends on what the real truth is to why you want to go there...!!!! And I mean the TRUTH!!!!
lGrcLQ49aa	My kids really had no issues with moves in the past - I think people make issue worse by over preparing the kids - You need to let them know what they will understand.  Try to make sleeping arrangements as "normal" as possible and be patient.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - moving can be scary and exciting at the same time.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	we moved when my daughter 15 months and she was upset for a few days.  i wouldn't expect anything from the 7 month old. thats too young to really know whats going on|`|HwIi9Tkwaa	I have a little boy who is now 4 (another who is nine) he has cp and autism and we moved3 times in 7 months I was so worried about him adjusting to it all etc.... <br>  Guess what he was fine, as long as he had all the things that were dear to him and all familiar smells it was ok. He was 2 and three at the time with a mental age of 12months less, so I'm sure as long as you reassure your little ones and they have all their things with them they will be fine, good luck with the move. x|`|8AmMlAZYaa	I have twin boys and we moved into our first house when they were about 2 and they did just fine no problems at all they loved all the new room to run around in and I tried to keep their new (big boy) room very special to them.

VSQYLWt6aa	No, you generally shouldn't ovulate when you don't have a period. The whole point of a period is to "flush out" the un-fertile egg.
VudhjHi2aa	My Son turned One in Feb. and I didn't do one. But I didn't need to it was only family Sisters, Mothers Aunt Uncles Cousins and Grandparents. I didn't even make out invites. I made a few calls and said this is where it is this is what size he is in and HE is One if you want to get him a toy most of them at stores are labeled for each age bracket. I didn't have any problem with the gifts cause most called me and ask if it was ok for them to get him____. <br>  In my personal opinion a big to do is just to much for a one year old they don't remember it anyways just take a few pictures for the scrapbook. My Son had no idea what was going on it was the same as any other trip to Aunties house but with cake he got to try for the 1st time (that he didn't want to eat but wanted to feed to mommy)<br>  <br>  If you are going to have a BIG To Do I would not to a gift registry just Write in the invites the size she is in now and if she is in to something put that in to. ( i.e. Amy is in size 12 to 18 months and she loves any thing sesame street)<br>  I think the guest would like that better gives them a chance to really pick out something they like.|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	I wouldn't do it.  Honestly I think it's a little tacky.<br>  Don't go over the top for her first bday.  I know it's a huge event for you - it was for my daughter too.  I had a huge bash and honestly in retrospect, many years later I'm embarrassed that I did.  I've had so many friends since then who did a very low key immediate family only party and I wish that's what I had done.  Most people don't want to come to a big party for a one year old and the child certainly will not know the difference.  Save the money on what you would have paid for the big party and put it toward your child's education.  In the long run I think you'd be happier if you do that.<br>  However, if you do have the big party, don't do a registry.  The guests won't tell you to your face but I guarantee most will think the party is just a big gift grab.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I have never heard of it, and I'm sure some people think it's a good idea, but I wouldn't do it.  Sounds a bit tacky.<br>  <br>  Honestly, what does a one year old NEED?  Registries are usually done for weddings (when the new couple is supposedly setting up a new household and needs things like pots and pans) and first babies (when the family needs things like diaper pails and strollers). <br>  <br>  What I would love most for my son for his first birthday party is money towards his college fund.  He's got more toys than he can play with, and he has so many clothes, he wears them once before growing out of them.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I have actually never heard of it.  Most people have very small personal birthday parties for their one year old and the people coming are family and close friends.  Generally, they will have an idea of what you like.  At my oldest's first birthday it was just me, my husband, and my sister. At my youngest's it was me and five to six other people including of course his older brother.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I didn't, personally. I gave a general idea of what she was interested in, but she didn't get any of that, lol. I don't think it would hurt. Making a registry would definitely aid in not having to repeat yourself to everyone who asks what she needs/wants. I think, though, in general, people tend to buy whatever they want to buy.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is rude at all.|`|VCCKfT3taa	My baby isn't a year old, but I think they idea might be viewed as rude. <br>  Generally, registries are used to let people know what YOU need. (Weddings, baby showers, ect.) The party is for your daughter, and I think it would be rude to tell people that you expect them to get certain things. <br>  <br>  A more acceptable way of trying to get certain things is to just drop subtle hints in normal conversation.|`|lZkQp994aa	i think its a good idea. i would do it too!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no i didn't make a registry. i don't really think it's a good idea because people might find it tacky. it wouldn't have mattered if i made a registry anyway mainly because people asked me a million times what she wanted or needed and of course i told them and when the day came she didn't get one thing that i had mentioned anyway. i just dont think it's necessary to make a registry for a birthday party to me it says bring gifts but only the ones i tell you to.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I did not make a registry for my son's birthday. Lots of people did call me and ask what he would like and what size clothes I needed for him. Honestly, I would never buy a birthday present off of a registry. I like to go and pick out a present that I think the child will like.
AA11018222	Your best bet is to go see a doctor about the infertility... Otherwise, if you don't want to see a fertility specialist, you might try a birthcontrol pill for 3 months... Sometimes you're more fertile right after you get off the pill.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I would go to your doc and let him/her know that you have been ttc for a year.

This is my first pregnancy, Im ONLY 6 1/2 weeks along and I could just crawl in a hole and die!! Whoever thought to call it "morning sickness" has something SERIOUSLY wrong with them! Its all day, all night, with 10-15 minute breaks every once in a while. I cant eat and have to spend all day in bed. Luckily, I read that it will go away after the first trimester. I drink ginger tea or ginger ale, suck on hard candies or popsicles and take LOT of baths. I was at a maternity store the other day, they sell these things "preggie pops" they're suckers that are supposed to help. I also read that some women wear a motion sickness band and it helps. Good luck, darlin'. Hang in there!!|`|kj1md6t0aa	Promethazine suppositories - only thing that worked for my morning sickness! Ask your doctor about them.

I was sick/throwing up from 6 to 23 weeks, from 4am til 11pm every night! I've been prescribed 3 different things, including Zofran.

If it's only 4mg, trying taking 2 pills rather then one, and only take it every 8 hours.|`|Ql09WZa8aa	My morning sickness was horrible during the 6th 7th and 8th week, I'm taking navidoxin (B6 supplements).. it took time to handle my body, around a couple of days.. eat salty crackers, or just plain bread, and eat it very slowly it helped me .... <br>  Count the blessings that morning sickness means your hormone levels are high ... :)|`|0vpDDM8aaa	had it for 14 weeks with my first pregnancy....this time around, i am 12 weeks and feeling much better already!  hoping to keep on "improving"!|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Yup, I have had that|`|1PAFN8avaa	I also had all day sickness.

Also, try preseed. It's a lubricant that you can order online that provides lubrication, but also helps get the swimmers to where they need to go faster. GL!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Tuck a pillow under your hips so that you are at more of an incline and he can get a deeper penetration.|`|hFsl7WpPaa	Prop your bum up with a pillow during and after so the swimmers are drawn downwards towards your cervix. Also you should be doing it when your cervical mucus is like egg whites and really stretchy. This kind of fluid helps carry the sperm better, and it shows you are in your most fertile phase.

vGxipYJnaa	The only thing I could think of is that she doesn't like that the character is inactive when he sleeps? I don't think it would be death related because I doubt your daughter has much of a concept of death. Maybe she thinks that she's missing something when the character in the book is sleeping. I know our kids don't like bedtime because they feel they're missing out on something.. when really they're just missing out on my husband and I doing chores and watching the news.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Make sure you explain to her and she understands that they are going to wake up later, just like she does.  Maybe somehow in her little brain she thinks they are dying or something.|`|YJGEEJhWaa	Maybe she thinks they have died!<br>  next time shes starts crying, say the teddy is having nce dreams and needs sleep to wake up early and have some fun! haha|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Well first of all I think it is great that you and your husband take the time to read to your daughter at night , not enough parents do this very important thing . It could be just a bit of a phase and perhaps linked to something she has seen or done say at nursery . Maybe if you tried to explain that everyone need to sleep , including teddies !!  so that they can be wide awake and ready to go out and play next day . I am sure this will pass soon , maybe you could look for books that start when teddies or babies wake up !!  Keep up reading to her and in a year or so you should also get her to try and read a few simple words herself . My parents and other relatives would read every day to me including bed time and I could actually read ( limited ) before school . I think all parents should try to give their kids this boost|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Tell her the teddy is dreaming about your daughter maybe visiting her and the teddy doesn't want her to cry anymore.She might think the teddy is not going to wake up so tell her it is.

Go with that answer.|`|RkBHOXs6aa	What Skittles said is a good answer. I would've said that too.|`|OtDPZO3vaa	Hello. <br>  I think that she is relating the sleep to something bad that she's seen and doesn't understand...as most people here have said. <br>  Since you're so willing to read and spend time with her...and you notice the issues, then I would suggest a game (or experiment).<br>  We would play "daycare." "We" could be the teachers.<br>  We could read to the dolls as they sat up along the wall or something,<br>  with the understanding that when the story was finished, it would be nap time.  I'd make little "beds" up for her dolls.<br>  When the time came, I'd let her put the dolls down for their naps and watch what she does. I'd have one doll that I was putting down and say, "She just doesn't want a nap. She's sad and crying...what should we do?" And see what she does. Maybe she's seen yelling, slapping or slamming the babies down at school and that has her worried. If she wants to hug the crying doll, then that's a good thing. If she doesn't seem to know what to do, you could suggest that she rock the doll and make it feel better so it will take a nap. Put the "kids" to sleep and go eat lunch. Come back and have her help get all the kids back up from their naps. Her actions and reactions could reveal a lot.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Aww...! That is so cute. <br>  <br>  I would just reassure her that they're okay, and nothing is wrong. I'm sure she's not equating it with death - but who knows what can upset them or set them off. I bet she will be over it in a few months and it won't even phase her. <br>  <br>  My 21/2 year old currently seems upset about characters in books who have their mouths wide open, whether it's smiling, a look of surprise or anything like that. I don't know what started it but when we get to that part she either covers up their mouths with her hand or covers her eyes. LOL LIke you I just skip that part or say, "It's okay!" to reassure her. :)|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	sounds to me like you have a sensitive little girl ,maybe she thinks the character is lonely

I was so tired for the first 10weeks it was ridiculous.  I felt like I couldn't even move.  Just like you.  It goes away.  Around 12 weeks you will notice an extreme difference in your energy level.  Your body is building a human being and is tired. Don't push yourself too much.  Listen to your body.  Its busy doing a lot even if you aren't.  It subsides for your second trimester, and then returns sometime in the latter of your 3rd trimester.  Don't worry, you'll have lots and lots of energy soon!|`|gqQGG9Wiaa	Keep yourself up on slow releasing carbohydrates.

Now, I'm 38 wks and everyone is surprised I'm not tired or exhausted because my stomach is so huge.  Hang in there.  It gets better soon.<br>  <br>  PS: You might want to ask your OB if you can take iron supplements.  I ended up being short on iron at 5.5 months... Although my early iron levels read normal, it might have had something to do with the early fatigue.|`|QdFOTKs9aa	First thing to remember is that each pregnancy is different so don't assume that this pregnancy should be like the other 4. Each baby is unique, just like the pregnancy. <br>  Also, make sure you are taking a prenatal vitamin on top of eating correctly. Here is a great site to read. It's a great guide to understanding what foods to eat & avoid: <a href="http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/what-can-eat-increase-my-energy-level.html" rel="nofollow">http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/what...</a><br>  And keep in mind... you are still early in your pregnancy and it's completely normal to feel like a big blob that just wants to sleep. Listen to your body & baby. Don't push too hard. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|oCTG5IVvaa	i feel exactly the same, that's just how it is for lots of pregnant women.. at christmas when i was 8 weeks i had to help put up the christmas tree sitting down lol it tired me out doing it. <br>  I'm still the same now and i'm 17 weeks 4 days,<br>  I just go to bed as soon as i can (about 8pm!) and feel no guilt doing it, and on my days off work i sleep in for as long as i want. But then this is my first baby.<br>  Don't feel guilty about your partner, mine has been an angel and cooked, cleaned, fussed over me. It's how they should be when you're pregnant! we should just be grateful we have such lovely caring partners!<br>  Obviously try to eat well, but to be honest i don't think theres much we can do about it!<br>  good luck x x
wKuQC4yTaa	CONGRATS!!! your Pregnant|`|WNsjy5oFaa	congratulations <br>  <br>  no matter how faint the line is if its there then your pregnant<br>  <br>  false positives are extremely rare and only really happen in poly-cystic ovary syndrome but as i said this is very very rare<br>  <br>  again congratulations and good luck for the future|`|WQcxODKLaa	your eggo is prego :)|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes you are pregnant :D congrats|`|RdgzULeUaa	your preggers!  I took 5 tests.  Even the one I took early in the morning had a faint line and thats the best time to take the test.  Get the one that says pregnant or not pregnant to ease your mind.  Althought even though I saw the word pregnant I thought I was seeing things lol.  Good luck!|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Congrats! You're gonna be a mommie..welcome to the club.

They really just don't happen. The test detects the pregnancy hormone and nothing else. If there were 2 lines you are pregnant.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think you're pregnant! congrats girl!
MubTZUKXaa	Your Dr won't recommend that you go on the pill if you are trying for a baby, he may also want you to try for approx a year before you start any treatment.  Apparently most women with PCOS conceive without help in the time spent waiting for treatment.<br>  <br>  Your partner does not need to be tested for you to be prescribed Clomid or Metformin... in my experience this was only done after Clomid+metformin failed to work for me after many cycles.<br>  <br>  Also should Metformin and/or Clomid fail to work for you within a few cycles your Dr may request that you have more tests. (the sooner the better) Tests may include, blood tests at specific cycle days... scans also during you cycle to check for mature follicles (which would indicate that you are able to ovulate alone or have ovulated during a medicated cycle) and maybe a HSG test which is basically a dye test to check your tubes are fine and clear.<br>  <br>  If everything (other than having PCOS!) seems OK then he will probably continue with Clomid and Metformin for a few more cycles.  If you still haven't conceived by this stage I think he will suggest sperm tests for your partner and then maybe advise you on your next step of treatment.. could be injectable fertility meds or IUI etc.<br>  <br>  It's more than likely that you won't reach this stage...Many Women with PCOS conceive without help.  I read that it's only about 10% of Women with PCOS who need treatment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and tons of baby dust xxxxx|`|Wzws8v8daa	i recently went through the same thing - i found out i had pcos and my doctor said that i should take the pill to regulate my period when i'm NOT trying to get pregnant, but since i am currently trying to get pregnant, he said that i should start on clomid. he said that most women with pcos do not ovulate on their own so we need the clomid to force our body to ovulate.  your partner will not need to be tested before you can take clomid.  all it is is a medicine that will make your body ovulate.  <br>  my doctor also said that metforim is not necessary.  he simply said that with women with pcos, you should take clomid when trying to get pregnant, and take the pill when not trying.|`|PQw92IGHaa	I have PCOS and my doctor wanted me to wait for a year before he would refer me to a specialist.  I trust him completely and after I had only two cycles in 7 months he has done all the testing on my husband and I and will start us on clomid next month.  I would listen to what your doctor says and take their steps.  They have seen many patients before you with these problems. Ask them all the facts...how long you are going to be on the pill, what's the standard of care for patient's with PCOS and infertility.  If you aren't happy with how they handle the situation you might look to another OB.<br>  <br>  Also, I know how hard it is to wait.  That will be one of the hardest battles during this whole process.  Make sure they are testing you and your husband and express your concerns about waiting.  Ask your doctor for a timeline that way you know what steps are being taken, having a plan helps calm my nerves!|`|eY3SWMdqaa	I have been off the pill since March of last year. I had only a few periods last year, and my doctor also told me that I had PCOS. About 5 months ago my doctor put me on Metformin because I said I wanted to get pregnant, but I wasn't actively trying because my husband was deployed. So, after he got back we tried for a month, and nothing. I had a doctor appointment about a week ago, and was put on Progesterone Pills because I haven't had a period since before Chrismas. Anyway, after I start my period I am supposed to start Clomid, but haven't had my period yet! It's so annoying!! But, if you want to be on Metformin I would say something. I don't think they will put you on the pill if you are trying to get pregnant. All you have to do is tell your doctor that you do not want birth control. That's what I did, and it was no big deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YzUPmWTBaa	Going on the pill when you have pcos, will give you a monthly period, but will never regulate your period. You HAVE to be on metformin to balance out your hormones and let you get regular and ovulating naturally. This alone is usually enough to conceive, without clomid. Good luck and baby dust
ZZakBjiNaa	If my calculations are correct, you're roughly around 5 weeks along if you are.<br>  wait another week to take a test x|`|ROJans2Taa	I know the stress of waiting, I would definitely still try, not every women ovulates when they say (day 14), I ovulated 6  day 6-8 days after the start of my period and got pregnant, I would recommend having intercourse once every other day, on average takes healthy couples up to 1 year to conceiveve which I know is a long time, just keep trying, best luck|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Okay, first off all this should have been in 'Trying to conceive' section Secondly my link has a article called 'Trying for a baby.<br>  <br>  If my link for some reason doesn't work then do this:<br>  1. Type in 'Gurgle.com'<br>  2.On the right of the page it will say 'Stages'<br>  3.Take your cursor down from the word stages and click on 'Trying for a baby'<br>  4.That's the page.<br>  5.Search the site because it has a list of what you must eat for a healthy baby and also it has tips on birth and labour.<br>  <br>  Hope that I helped.xxx *Baby dust*|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Babies are all natural life stuff and most people who "try" take at least 2 or more years. Just let things happen naturally, don't use condoms if you want to conceive. You go first and then him, make sure it's romantic and body temperature has got to warm, so thing are hot, hot, hot...they don't call it "steamy" for nothing. That's when the women is at her best. All the luck to you and jump his bones when you get the urge!|`|p11HaDIWaa	aww ur not a failure it'll happen soon enough for u! and if still no luck go get tested, how do u know its not his little solders??? good luck to u:)

963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It should be covered.  Especially since your doctor referred you.  In Texas medicaid covers a regular eye exam and glasses.  It only covers the cheapest frames though.|`|AA10458750	You have to call the medicaid number and ask specifically about your case.

zj32aZ2eaa	I'm in the same boat and figuring out it takes about 15days after the bleeding has stopped to get a good reading. Mine are all coming up negative still and have another 8days or so...good luck!|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	After around 14 days it should be correct :)|`|YzCPY48qaa	if it showed a pregnancy then you should have got a positive by now,sorry.|`|GjuRYsITaa	if it showed the beginning of a pregnancy why du need to do a test as well
TMoig58waa	Well, an evap line can have colour. However, as long as you are reading the test within the first few minutes (as indicated on the instructions) then you are definitely pregnant!

Awwww, congratulations dear!!!|`|Faw2iBtfaa	No, the line would not be blue if you were not pregnant.

MubTZUKXaa	My HSG was one of the most painful things I have ever done and I'm not joking!  <br>  I wouldn't believe everything you read on here :-) not being horrible but I read that the test is painful if there is a blockage... SO not true.  I spent ages between my test and the Dr appointment for the results thinking that my tubes were blocked but the results said they were fine.. So painful test does not mean the tubes are blocked..<br>  <br>  Also I never had any results on the day of the test, they never said anything about it.  I had to wait until I saw a different Dr for the results so this is normal.  Doesn't mean there are any problems.  I suppose it's just their job to do the test, not give the results.<br>  <br>  Good luck xxx|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I had one back in Sept. of 2005. Yes, it hurt like no body's business. They told me the same thing that the Doctor would go over the results. My tubes came back clear and open. I got a positive home test December 31st, 2005. We were trying for over 2 years.|`|3eedacdd967671121cd9896508699ccdaa	Yes, it was probably some of the worst pain I've ever felt and my tubes were totally free and clear. I had it done last July and so far still no BFP, but we don't think I ovulate regularly either. I have a super irregular cycle. Meaning I might have 1 AF a year, if that, naturally without medication. They told me my results right away, but there  was a monitor in the office. She said they just started telling you the results right away in that office, so it was a new thing. <br>  <br>  Don't worry!

44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Well if you've been at it for a year I'd seriously consider using OPK's for a few months. Or the ovulation predictor kits. It will help you figure out when you are ovulating and give you a small period of about 72 hours where bding is best. <br>  <br>  And I was pregnant back in December. lost the baby unfortuanately in the beginning of the month. But i had AF like symptoms. They seemed to arrive earlier than they should have though. Pry there at about 6 or 7 dpo instead of at the usual 11 or 12 dpo. Aside from that I pretty much didn't KNOW till AF was late cause I just felt like crap. My back hurt like no other, I was so thirsty, I seemed to pee more, I had severe cravings, and I had hunger pangs that were AWFUL! But that wasn't really that noticable till AF was actually due. Before that it just seemed like she was coming.<br>  <br>  The only other thing was my CM when I was pregnant when I hit about 10 DPO was different than usual. Instead of being water... it had white streaks in it and there just seemed to be ALOT more than usual. But that was the ONLY real difference than a usual cycle before AF was due. That and the earlier than usual symptoms of AF!<br>  <br>  With that said I hope you get pregnant soon. We tried for 3 months before I got pregnant in December... now we are trying right away again and hoping for the best. I can't imagine what it is like to try for a full year. I'd be pretty disenfranchised by now. Good luck and I'm really hoping for you!|`|BhSGUlCgaa	The best way to find your TRUE ovulation would be to start tracking your BBT (Basal Body Temperature). There are dips and rises when you ovulate and it would help you find the exact time for your body.|`|S1t4e9E0aa	i dont think so it takes 4 to 6 weeks
HocTLdleaa	Same thing happened to me and it was just my uterus getting bigger. It can really be painful when your body is stretching so rapidly. <br>  <br>  It could just be the baby kicking you or braxton hicks contrations. If the pain continues call the doctor and they will have you describe the pain and exactly where it is. They will most likely be able to tell you over the phone if you should come in for a check or not.|`|ioZeveazaa	That would be ligament pain. It is your muscles and ligaments stretching around your uterus and baby. It gets really "fun" in a few more weeks because your baby is so jammed in there and kicking around, you will get pains even more. lol Its normal. Good luck!!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It is probably the weight of your ever-growing baby and expanding uterus. I suggest you start wearing a pregnancy support belt to help alleviate some of the pain.|`|plI0WOrUaa	It could be ligament pain.  Does it happen most when you are moving around, or getting up from a sitting or lying position??  Ligament pain is normal during pregnancy.  Its just your ligaments stretching to support your uterus.  It could be that.  If you are unsure, go to the doctor just to be safe.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	ligament pain or your cartilage in your pubic bone is not aligned causing you discomfort and distress. Ask your doctor about it next prenatal visit they can give you exercises to relieve the pressure and pain.
Ql09WZa8aa	You need to buy a pregnancy test, if it is negative then this is a lesson for you to have protection from now on. If positive, you need to tell ur mom or someone close, you're too young you need advices...|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	When you're pregnant, your stomach wont start visibly growing until a few months in! Personally, I dont think you're pregnant but you should probably take a home pregnancy test to be sure. I buy the cheap walmart ones, they work with no problem. If you get a negative, test again a week or so later, just to be sure. If you get a positive, make an appointment with your dr to get a blood test to make sure its an accurate yes.  Other than pregnancy, you could be constipated. My sister (who was 19 when diagnosed) has chrone's disease. It causes severe constipation and makes your belly swell. Its hard to eat and is very painful. If you havent had regular bowel movements, again, make an appointment with your doctor to see what might be wrong with your belly.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	bf gets to go to jail, and labeled sex offender.

cd2ff6d9798215d0536899c2ea1dd9d5aa	I was circumcised as an adult and never felt my parents had made a mistake by not having the procedure done when I was a child. There also was an upside after the procedure was completed. The Dr. informed me that they were able to use my foreskin to replace the eyelids of a girl who had been burned. He said the procedure worked beautifully except that the girl became extremely cock-eyed.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Good question! :)<br>  I wouldn't feel like I made a mistake. I didn't feel comfortable altering my son's body without his consent. If in the future, he feels that he wants to be circumcised, I will give him the money. But there's no reason to feel guilty about leaving my son's body the way it's intended to be.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	Honestly I wouldn't feel like I'd made a mistake.<br>  <br>  I would have made what I felt was the best/right choice for him as a child, and when he's an adult he can make any choice he feels is right for him, whether it's getting snipped or getting it replaced.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yea the joke was pretty funny <br>  but i would Support him <br>  and i wouldn't feel bad if he wanted for skin replaced because cut is cleaner in my thoughts and i was doing what was best for him|`|HclKftzAaa	I would rather he fixed something i didn't do when he was a baby, than wanted something back i took from him when he was a baby.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of reasons why i wouldn't circumcise my baby (if i was having a boy), and i feel that they all outweigh any argument for him having to go through it when he's older. At least that way it's his own choice.<br>  <br>  Easier to remove it when he's older than replace it, as the procedure often ruins the most sensitive part of the penis, and he'd never get that back if he had it replaced.

b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	this is how I was. I thought I was coming down with preeclampsia as well but the doctor said no. My hands would get so bad I couldn't close my hands into fists and you could see where my socks cut in around my ankles. my toes looked like plump little piggys. my face did get a little swollen but nothing comparing to my hands and feet.<br>  do you have a local walmart or rite-aid that has the blood pressure thing in the pharmacy? if so just go and check it. anything over 140/90 I would say call your doctor. plus, the walking is good exercise and it will keep your blood pressure down if you walk. I started walking an hour a day at 36 weeks. it made my active labor go pretty fast. I went from half of a cm to having my baby in my arms in 8 hours-thats awesome for a first baby =]<br>  i would go check the BP and then call your doctor and say you think you are having symptoms of this and you checked your bp it was: <br>  ____ over _____ and did he/she think that was a concerning number.<br>  the worst thing that will happen is they will say no just keep an eye on it. and it will really ease your mind either way. the stress of thinking about it will alone make your BP raise up. <br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|A9nBzN3Daa	i would call and ask last time i was prego and i  had a headache that wouldn't go away it was a sinus infection. so call the doctor!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I think it sounds like Preeclampsia.

Good luck!|`|fTd509Qzaa	sudden swelling can be an indicator of preeclampsia<br>  seeing as you have protein in your urine and sudden swelling, you may have developed high blood pressure since your last appt.  Call the Dr. let her know you are concerned.  You should be able to go in and see a nurse to check your urine and blood pressure, just to be sure.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i would call the DR.  i would call and tell them your symptoms just as a precaution. this way you will have a piece of mind and it's always better to be safe then sorry.|`|AA11481889	When in doubt CALL, that's why they get paid the big bucks.
CdJtH0xdaa	It is YOUR baby; not your parents'. You can do what you want with the baby, and your parents and your little sister cannot tell you otherwise. If your parents don't want another baby in the house, I would suggest trying to live with your sister. You just have to tell your parents that you are planning to live with your sister. Also, if you want to press charges against the person who raped you, I would suggest you do it. He is the father of your unborn child, so he should have a right to pay child support if you want to keep the child. Good luck to you.
aI4wgxRFaa	If you didn't get your period 3 months ago, you are more likely pregnant. Go and take a home pregnancy test to find out, and make an appointment with your doctor.

ioZeveazaa	Sweety I am going to be honest. There is really not too much that can make you more comfortable. It is going to get really uncomfortable from here on out because your baby is just getting BIG and strong. She is moving around alot because she is healthy which is a good thing. Her growth also makes it really hard to get comfortable in bed. I find that putting a heating pad on LOW under my blanket(not directly me) helps me relax and in turn helps my baby relax so try this and see if it helps. The bladder situation will not go away. I go to the bathroom almost every hour. Your baby is producing more urine along with you. Just hang in there. It will be over soon. Good luck!!|`|khSCs1rbaa	Me too..... I feel the pain in my ribcage only starting last night when I tried sleeping on my left. I was sleepless most of the night & have to change to the right or my back. The moment I turn to my left, the pain is there again. Also, I have been going to wee (at least 6 times) starting 3 days ago as well.

It's a tough thing and the end result will make all the discomfort worth while.

I am only 25 weeks.  Just remember its not much longer to feel this way. you should be able to push her legs down a bit by pushing on your stomach|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I know how you feel! You're in your last few weeks, just hang in there. Use tons of pillows. Drink lots of water (4 X 600ml/day), this will help with the swelling, you'll have to pee more, but you'll pee more in quantity and feel better. You can take Ibuprofen for pain and eat soda crackers (no salt, salt causes swelling) for sickness. I also took antacids (not tums cuz they're too week), but the extra strong ones, as my little girl was making puke every night before bed in my last 2 weeks...|`|IVIlMMFnaa	relax and  get real

LlyyGWTYaa	Don't drink, don't smoke, and don't be around people that smoke.  Eat fresh foods as often as possible. <br>  <br>  I have never heard of that.  I have a daughter that was born on Sept. 23 and she doesn't have asthma.  She only had breathing problems when she was a baby and I had put her in daycare for like three weeks.  After taking her out of daycare, she hasn't had any more health problems and she is almost 6 now.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	1) Avoid a c-section, they increase the rates of asthma.<br>  2)  Breast fed only, it lowers the incidence of asthma.<br>  3)  There is some evidence that taking fish oil (DHA/Omega 3 oil) supplements also lowers the incidence of asthma.<br>  <br>  To help with avoiding a c-section, drinking red raspberry leaf tea will help with uterine toning (for good contractions during labor), getting a doula will lower the incidence of c-section, good levels of calcium and vitamin D also lower the incidence of c-section.<br>  <br>  For nursing, start attending La Leche League meetings, and think about hiring a lactation consultant.<br>  <br>  For the oil, krill oil is the source of the DHA/Omega 3 oils in fish, so you can do that or algae or even get it from sunflower seeds.|`|ROJans2Taa	I had read that as well, and I did more digging and found they think it's because the baby would be more likely to be exposed to various virus's during infancy if born around fall time. theres also a genetic link to asthma, so if you or your husband has it, it's in increased risk, however, my husband has it, my daughter was born in oct, had several colds/flu's and has never had asthma. my son was born in sept he is only 6 mths so we'll wait and see, but they say if you stay away from cigarette smoke, delay starting solids till 6 mths (not sure what that has to do with asthma) then it decreases the odds. best luck|`|96ydDKocaa	i dont know if i believe babies born in fall have asthma, but here are a few things you can do to keep you and your baby health as possible take your prenatal, cod liver oil premontes healthey brain growth, and calcium because the babies taking most of yours right now before trying anything else i would consulte your doc as far as teas herbs and other natural or suggested remidies|`|F8iyUqJBaa	HAHAHAHA... that is the craziest thing I have ever heard.

b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Im sorry about your miscarriage I had one too this month and it sucks I know....very badly. Well with that being said I was 4 weeks along when I miscarried. We got right back to trying and had sex throughout the month. Not alot maybe just 5 times all month. I still have not got a period since the miscarriage ( i dont know if thats normal or what) but i was supposed to get it on the 19th. Ihave signs tooooo! my boobs hurt really bad and feek full. I randomly feel sick ( like a car sick feeling but randomly when im not in a car) and I have this pain in my stomache which i motice more when we have sex. SOOO  I know I didnt really answer anything but its just nice to kow we are in the exact same situation. Im at work now for 30 more minutes and when I leave Im going to buy an HPT just so i can have peace of mind either way. Good luck girly!!!!!!!! Let us know what happens|`|YlLmAADraa	I think you are just thinking up these symptoms because you wouldn't feel symptoms yet as implantation takes a few days to occur.|`|LUR9MVaiaa	Usually ur Dr will tell you to wait a few months to try again after a miscarriage to give ur body and mind time to heal, so i think that advice was kind of strange. <br>  And its gonna take a while for ur body to go back to the way it was when you get sick or eat more you will continue those symptoms even when there's not a physical reason for it anymore (in ur case being pregnant). t's the same when you have the flu or something like that; the cough will linger even once ur better. <br>  <br>  I'm really sorry for ur loss i bet it's hard, give yourself as much time as u need. if you have ovulated then it's possible ur pregnant again but idk that the symptoms ur having are because of it just yet. <br>  <br>  best of luck|`|uVEDt4Woaa	Your progesterone will rise after ovulation whether you are pregnant or not and on around day 14 past ovulation if you are not pregnant will fall again. So, the progesterone could be helping your tummy as it has a positive effect on intestinal and smooth muscle (like in your tummy) motility - so you could be pregant or not (sorry that's not much help).<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear of your miscarriage, I also had a miscarriage last month and am now 4DPO. About a week before my HPT positive last month I had terrible diarrhoea (so would have only been about 8-10DPO) and felt nauseous. I thought I had a stomach bug, but a week later when it was still hanging around I did a HPT and was amazed to see a positive. I never thought you could get such early symptoms - so they do happen.<br>  <br>  It could certainly be that you are pregnant, just keep looking out for more signs in the next 10 days or so. I know the wait is agony, but try and distract yourself and DON'T do early tests because they can lead to disappointment. Best of luck to you!!
ROJans2Taa	that's fine for around 6-7 weeks pregnant it can vary immensely<br>  <br>  6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml <br>  7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml<br>   <br>  as long as it keeps going up you should be fine, best luck

b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I felt that way too. everybody I knew said 'you've been having so many braxton hicks and so much discomfort i'd bet money you're going early. everyone said that baby just doesn't want to stay in there. I can see you in the hospital a month early.' I ended up going a day after my due date. I was so sure it would be early. especially by week 36 I said every day this baby is coming! i dont really think there is anyway to know. I think it's just wishful thinking =]<br>  <br>  best of luck. My braxton hicks started to come hard at 28 weeks and came everyday until labor.|`|ioZeveazaa	I thought my girl was going to come early but she hasn't. She is breech and very cozy sitting in me. My doctor has to take her out by cesarean in one week. She will be 40 weeks.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I felt that way when I was pregnant with my son.  Can't say there was any particular reason but I just knew he was coming earlier than the doctor predicted.  And apparently my husband felt the same way.  They had a "baby pool" at his place of work and he won!  And yes, my son came 2 weeks, nearly 3 weeks early.<br>  <br>  So if you have that "feeling", don't wait until the last minute to get everything ready.  Then you can relax and take good care of yourself those last few weeks.|`|BDnSmRE6aa	I felt like this too, had my bag packed for so long, washed the baby's clothes and had most things ready by 20 something weeks. I've also had really bad braxton hicks but it hasn't developed into anything yet. They thought my membranes ruptured at 30 weeks but it was just an infection. I'm currently 36w3d and the baby is still not here. Being induced in 2 weeks due to high risk pregnancy. Even my family thought I was going to go into premature labour. From my experience it's just the anxiety of being pregnant! I still worry that I might go before I'm induced, I'm surprised I haven't yet because I walk so much during the day and tire myself out completely! Every little thing has got me worried for these last few weeks that I've even told my partner no to sex in case it sets something off. I'd say it's good that you're alert to how your body feels, but hopefully you'll go full term =) Good luck!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i am 30 weeks on sunday i the other day i felt that way i hope i am wrong , i am so uncommy to but it does happen for your body to get ready for labor . 10 week really isnt that far away .

I had a feeling when my doctor said my cervix was shortening that he may come early, I had been having a bit of leakage for some time and then the mucous discharge (mucous plug) which I didn't realize. Then suddenly my water broke at 28 weeks. I was rushed to the hospital where I stayed until 31 weeks when he was born. <br>  <br>  It's nothing to be worried about, I'm sure you'll be fine, but in case your baby is premature at least your at a stage where he has a 90% chance survival rate. It is scary having your baby early but you'll feel comforted by the fact that there has been many technological advances in the care of premature babies.<br>  <br>  My son came home after a 6 week long hospital stay, he came home on oxygen and  heart monitore which he was on for only a month or two. He is now a healthy 8 month old and I couldn't be happier about the care he recieved while in the NICU.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and I'm sure everything will be fine = ) I'd love an update from you. <br>  <br>  chelsea.miracle@yahoo.com|`|umca7pwoaa	I'm currently only 22 weeks but from the beginning of this pregnancy (and it's high risk I might add) i've always felt like I'm going to have to have a c-section early.

ybexjS2Paa	I'm a single mum to two beautiful kids. It's not easy being a single parent but you'll be fine. If you have support from your family and friends that makes life much easier. To be honest I don't even think about dating I'm so absorbed with the kids that I don't have time for that. I'm not sure I even want to. You'll be just fine there are plenty of single parents out there and they are doing a great job. Good luck :)|`|kIblsxJQaa	I know this may be hard to hear, but you have to forget dating for the moment and concentrate on yourself and your child.  It is hard bringing up a child with two parents but even harder on your own.  Just enjoy being a mum and when you can have the odd night out with your friends grab the chance and just let your hair down.  Things will get easier and the baby gets older and will be more company for you but youve just got to get on with being a Mum for now.|`|HvX6KvK1aa	i am voting for ruby. her answer is great
7rKUmK0qaa	4 month is more easier because all they do is eat and sleep. I travelled w my son at 4 months and it was a breeze. I also travelled w him when he was 9 months and he couldnt sit still but it was still manageable. <br>  Make sure to bring finger food, milk/juice and some toys for them to play with. Also it is better to travel at night so they sleep. It doesnt matter how old they are. They always sleep at night unless they dont have a good sleepping pattern.. Goodluck|`|52U22fiAaa	It does get tougher as they get older because they get more squirmy.  I traveled with my daughter when she was 6 months old, and it was rough but doable.  It was a 30 hour flight.  <br>  <br>  I would advise you to bring plenty of milk, snacks, and something to distract her.  A couple of outfits to change her into because she will get messy and you don't want her to be uncomfortable, and of course a blankie.  PLENTY of diapers and wipes because airports don't sell those so make sure you're stocked up.  That should do it!|`|TJusfEnlaa	I have flown with my son when he was 5 weeks, 9 weeks, 7 months and 9 months. when he was weeks old that was by far the easiest. He slept the whole time and I just fed him while taking off and landing to help stop his ears from popping. When he was 7 months it wasn't so bad because we flew at night when he would usually be asleep, but at 9 months - uggh! what a nightmare - he was so fidgety and would not stay still - and therefore started screaming because he doesn't like to be restrained! It was horrible, for me, and the entire plane!|`|AA12287257	Wow 13 hrs huh? Remember the older they are the more active. My 3 month old was easier than my 3 yr old when I traveled in 2007. The best advice is to make sure you have plenty of liquids to allow her to swallow when the plane is leaving each way to avoid getting popped ears or you can plug her ears with your fingers. Also, bring her favorite toys and lottttttsssss of activities for her. Also, try to travel when they will be sleepiest.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I traveled a 4 hour flight with my daughter when she was 3 months. It was easy breezy. I just recommend using a sling when flying.<br>  <br>  Also you don't have to have them eat or use a pacifier on landing and takeoff, it's a myth <a href="http://www.comeunity.com/adoption/travel/airtravel.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comeunity.com/adoption/travel...</a>

ROJans2Taa	I had two experiences with bleeding during pregnancy one ended with me being diagnosed with a blighted ovum (sac but no baby) I was officially diagnosed with that at 7 weeks, I got pregnant 4mths later and again at around 5 weeks, had pink spotting, by 6-7 weeks it was red, they did U/S and found baby with heartbeat, I still experienced some bleeding until roughly 11 weeks, With it tampering off near the end, I never had clots though, but did have lots of cramps and the bleeding was really only when Id wipe off, I never really had any left over. it's very scary I do know the feeling, i Was convinced it was over with my son, I bawled my eyes out, now he is 6mths old. there is still hope but do prepare yourself just in case, you dont need to be heartbroken all over again, best wishes|`|YzCPY48qaa	each pregnancy is different,im 14w pregnant and last weekend i have spotting as well,but everything was fine.best thing you can di is get back to the hospital and demand a scan,that's the only way you can be certain if baby is alive or not,good  luck hun xxx.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	It could be either one, honestly. Some women bleed like that and everything is fine. When I bled like that and they didn't see a fetal pole, I was having a miscarriage, BUT I was further along than you...about 8 weeks. <br>  <br>  Are you in any pain? If you bleed through one pad in an hour, you're supposed to go to the ER. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
l79QIWszaa	I'm sure that you've been doing all the right things as far as eating something before you get out of bed and taking your vitamin with orange juice.  Ginger supplements and tea are the newest thing and vitamin b12 can be helpful also.  A lot of physicians will prescribe Zofran and the nausea disappears around weeks 14-16 for most.  Talk with you physician about these things.  <br>  <br>  I hope that you begin feeling better and though it's hard to believe now; it'll all be worth it in the end :)|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	I'm right there with you. It's awful, isn't it?<br>  <br>  If it's too bad, call your doctor. Mine prescribed me Zofran yesterday. <br>  <br>  The only tip I have, and this is gross, is to eat things that won't be so bad coming back up. <br>  <br>  People say eat crackers, but they leave a god-awful taste in my mouth that makes me throw up more.|`|HM0cxcahaa	I was soooo sick with both my bubs<br>  <br>  Maxalon is a prescription drug i was given to take 3 times a day, it did wonders and does not harm the baby.|`|wI5CxSRXaa	start some yog,or join some yoga classes|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Ginger tea helped me out. It will also help if you can identify some of your triggers, for me I had to be very careful where I went at the super market. The smell of meat or cleaning products would give me nausea.

397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	maybe she is over tired. try putting her to bed 30 minutes earlier|`|eZDoQPg8aa	It could be because she's tired and that's her way of "releasing" pent up energy, frustrations and emotions of the day.  Even big people feel more over whelmed when they are tired.  After she's released all that, she's calm and ready to sleep.<br>  <br>  I'd suspect part of it is also that she doesn't really want to go to bed, isn't ready to separate from you but she's tired and that's how it comes out.<br>  <br>  She will eventually learn other ways to exhaust all that pent up stuff and that going to bed is a normal part of every day.

OtDPZO3vaa	Stomach pain could be a reaction to the meds...Advil is gentler because it's coated but Tylenol generally isn't. The lingering fever points to an infection. If it were my daughter or son, I'd be having them drink lots of fluids...non-acidic things like water, clear sodas, or juices...like apple or peach (not orange juice or cranberry).The extra fluids can help flush the kidneys if there's an infection there. Is she going to the bathroom okay? Is her stomach growling like she has a build-up of gas?  Extra fluids can help and even a Tums for the acid.<br>  Pepto Bismal is safe enough, too, if you follow the directions. If you press on her stomach (left side just below the ribs) does it hurt? <br>  If she's not having bowel movements, maybe she's impacted. <br>  The doctors recommended the Advil, so I'd stay on that schedule for a day or two...even if when the time for the next dose , she doesn't show the fever. It could be a low-grade fever that comes back if a dose is missed. I'd press the fluids though.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Go see a real pediatrician. They are the ones who know kids best.|`|Bjad8v8Maa	I would make an appointment with her regular doctor, as he/she knows your daughters health history the best.  Sounds like she may have some kind of infection.  Larry brings up some good ideas in regards to the stomach pains.  Best thing to do would be to get her in to be seen at the doctor...not the ER.
KCduHtlqaa	It is highly possible for you to be pregnant. I had 5 months worth of extremely light periods. I had no idea that all of those 5 months I was pregnant. I also took a test when the light periods started and it was negative. you should see a doctor to confirm anything.|`|Zrdg3XJlaa	Could be many things, but take another test. Some don't come up correctly that early, if negative, see your doctor. could be nothing, but you're better off getting checked.<br>  I had my period, and didn't find out I was pregnant til I was 10-11 weeks.|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	from the sound of it, it does look like you are, do another test! only that way you can find out, because it is about 6 weeks ago you did the last one. good luck|`|9tQvqBwMaa	You should take another test and go to the doctor. Sometimes yor mind plays tricks on you because you want to be pregnant, but go and find out for sure.|`|AA11659150	It sounds like you might be pregnant, although with bleeding lasting this long, I would be worried that it might be an ectopic pregnancy.  Those can be very dangerous if not attended to.  I'd take another test, but just to be safe, you should absolutely call your doctor.

You were probably meant to hear the threat, so you could mend your ways.  Otherwise, when Dad gets home, he'll spank you.  Why didn't you do your chores?  Every family depends on its members to contribute to the well-being of the group, br it a major or minor contribution.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I think what you may have overheard is "corporal" punishment. This is where the inflict pain to deter you from repeating your actions (a swat to the bottom, etc).|`|zxKhnbhNaa	Your dad is talking about corporal punishment, basically he's gonna give you a slap (or worse) if you don't do your chores!<br>  <br>  Better get at them!   ;)|`|6nn7f41Faa	Corporal punishment. It's pretty much you're due for a spanking.
LMNHj66baa	since you've been pregnant before you should know it can take up to a year for your body to return to 'normal'. a miscarriage is giving birth, the same hormones are involved. that said you could still be pregnant. some babies don't show up on u/s until 9 weeks. as for tests, well they measure the pregnancy hormone in your blood. as your pregnancy progresses  it should get higher. have them do a double test a week apart to see if it get higher. if you have low levels, it will come out negative anyway, i've heard that boys give you a lower level. i agree test again.|`|wK4kqhHkaa	If bloods came up negative- its correct.  Blood test can detect HcG alot earlier then urine or ultrasound. Before you've even missed a period.   If the Hcg levels didn't indicate a certain level in the blood test it isn't a viable pregnancy.  Sorry|`|i7G2wtvraa	I don't know, I'm pregnant now and I was bleeding a few weeks ago. If you miscarried it would be just like a period. When I was bleeding I only had a few drops of blood but I still went to the doctor who said everything was fine.|`|dnLL4J71aa	i would say request a blood test and/or and ultrasound. sounds like pregnancy to me, but i would find out for sure<br>  <br>  sorry didnt read the question properly, i hazve no idea|`|lcQ17eDeaa	well you might be having the baby still like still born but with 5 weeks idk for a fact that your pregnant still. The spotting might be were you have the miscarriage but i would keep checking get 2nd opinions go to other places like plan parent hood they have accoride tests.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It was an assumption really.

2N3puedgaa	Just like any other method, withdrawal works for some people and doesn't work for other people. You have to use protection if you don't want to get pregnant. The only method that is 100% effective is abstinence; however, using some form of protection is better than not using protection at all. When I was with my ex, we used condoms and I wasn't too worried about becoming pregnant since the condom is very effective. I'm now dating someone else, and we've been using the withdrawal method. We didn't get pregnant, but I feel very idiotic because now I feel like we should have used another method anyway. Please be very careful in the future. There still could have been sperm in the pre ejaculation, and so you still run the risk of getting pregnant. It only takes one sperm to get a woman pregnant. Good luck to you! :)<br>  Oh, you can also view the link below; it helped me a lot!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you urinated before you did that you are ok. Precum only contains sperm when there had been a previous ejaculation. This happens because when you ejaculate only about 80% of the semen is ejected, leaving 20% in your urethra. When you urinate it flushes out the sperm that was left over. You should be fine, but to be safer have a condom handy so that next time you two want to try (you aren't virgins anymore and you've had sex now I hope you realize) you have a condom handy.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	lmao.... uneducated people make me sad|`|RdgzULeUaa	Personally the withdrawal method always worked for me.  I didnt get pregnant until I was dumb enough to forget my pills for a month.  Some say there is sperm in precum some say there isn't.  I was always led to beleive that the only way sperm can be in precum is if you had a prior ejacuation and some sperm was still in your urethra.  If you urinate you should be ok.  But nothing is for sure.|`|UusqE75paa	You have nothing to worry about if you did not fully ejaculate in her..Next time use protection so you won't have to worry yourself....|`|rJOuo24saa	sperm is still in precum<br>  she can still get pregnant
p11HaDIWaa	that happened to me too and i realized it was from wiping so much, and i always like to wipe like 8 times to make sure i cleaned it nice and fresh...so now i use baby wipes and just pat dry it with toilet paper after. good luck to u:)|`|RdgzULeUaa	I would think so.  I'm not pregnant and sometimes when I shave and am in a rush it sometimes gets irritated.  I actually would hold off on shaving and just trim.  The hair is there to keep out bacteria and since you are pregnant you should take every precaution.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I'd see a doctor to check for any signs of infection. You don't wanna hurt your baby and when you get bigger you won't be able to see there and if it gets worse, then you're in trouble. Also hold off on the shaving and trim around instead.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Yes, the irritation is probably due to frequent wiping.  That can happen very quickly.  The swelling could be the result of pregnancy hormones but that shouldn't cause the bleeding.  See a doctor.  They might not be prepared to give you anything to clear up whatever it is because you are pregnant, but at least you can put your mind to rest as to what it is.
zj32aZ2eaa	I wouldn't be too worried. Usually anything urine related is them checking for infection, diabetes in your pregnancy etc. Ask your doctor to clarify what they're looking for.
zj32aZ2eaa	Your about 10 weeks. Check out the link I've provided for American Pregnancy Association. They have everything on there and it's a very beautiful website.

ybexjS2Paa	Lol I almost forgot what's a ME time ;) I have two kids and I'm a single mum so it's almost impossible to get any time for myself. My older one goes to kindergarten during the day for 6 hours so I try to get everything done around the house then. That is if my 14 months old lets me, but usually she is pretty good. Then after the kids go to sleep I have couple of hours just for myself, I try to relax in the bath then, watch a movie read a book or just do nothing :)|`|lfMJPZ67aa	There is no such thing in my house. I have three children 7, 4 and 1. If it's not one it's the other. House work some times just has to wait. I have made a game of it now with the two eldest ones. It's called "Clean up the house". I got the idea from "Bear in the big blue house" they have this song on there called clean up the house so while we are cleaning I sing the song. It works. As for ME time I have to wait until they are all in bed and I just sit on the lounge in the quiet and I can't believe that silence can sound soooooooo good. Time for me and my husband is soon as they are all asleep. There is not much time for me at all and I get on average 4 to 5 hours sleep a day. I wouldn't give it up for the world.|`|AA10943329	once they are in bed at night DO NOTHING! that is the Me time I always had. No housework nothing....just relax with a book, take a bath whatever you like.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I had my first son at 18 and my last son just as I turned 21 (first born, May 1996, second born July 1997, and baby Dec 1998). Just after our baby was born I got up the courage to leave my abusive husband and was left to care for a toddler, a baby and a newborn all by myself. What I did was I worked out a schedule and just kept to it. My luck, though, was all my boys slept through the night right from the start. During the day, the playpen worked wonders when difficult chores needed to get done but most chores, when the boys could walk, they would do w/me. During the day there was nap time before lunch (about 10-11), in the afternoon (1-2), and bedtime from all three was 7 pm and they slept until 6 am ( I went to bed at 10 pm). The schedule was not always perfect and more often then not, one nap was missed but bedtime was always exact (occasionally w/a drive right before to soften the blow....driving helped put them to sleep). As they grew older I began to separate the bedtimes (as kids grow they have a tendency to play instead of sleep and it also allowed for one on one time). Now, bedtimes are:<br>  Baby (10): 8 on school nights and 9 on weekends<br>  Second youngest (11 1/2): 8:30 on school nights and 9:30 on weekends<br>  Second eldest (12 1/2): 9 on school nights and 10 on weekends<br>  Eldest (17 1/2): 10 on school nights and 11 on weekends <br>  This works out just fine for my hubby and I to either have quality time together or some time alone (for the hour in between the eldest's bedtime and the second eldests, the eldest will either stay out until bedtime, hide in his room or actually attempt to spend time w/us, teenagers you know..lol).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	since your youngest is that young.  it's hard to get that me time.  naps  was when i was able to get some kind of me time.

CdJtH0xdaa	The teacher most certainly tell the parents. If you don't want the teacher the tell, your friend needs to tell her that. Also, you should really talk to your friend about telling her parents this. It's quite serious, and is something they know.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Teachers are not legally bound by the same rules that say a guidance counselor or therapist would be. They can tell her parents. There is no confidentiality agreement with teachers and students. She could if she wants to.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	yeah the teacher can and thats something her parents should no|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Hmm...Not sure....<br>  I don't think they would be allowed to tell, because of confidentiality, but since its quite serious, she could...<br>  The teacher is probably just worried about your friend, because even though it has already happened, it is still a big thing, because it would have left an impact on her...I mean, no one would come out smiling would they?<br>  So keep being a good friend to her, and tell her gently there could be plusses to telling her parents, but its entirely up to her, and if your both worried about the teacher telling, go and speak to her firmly but politely, and tell her thanks for being concerned, but you want to keep your friends parents out of it...Maybe your friend could talk to the school nurse or councilor, because abortion is something that she won't just forget easily.Good luck!|`|FiUprYsvaa	Nope. The teacher is not allowed to say anything. <br>  <br>  Your friend is not in danger and her health in not at risk. <br>  It does not fall under the qualifications for your teacher to be required to tell. <br>  <br>  It would be wrong for the teacher to do so. <br>  It is up to the girl as to whether or not her parents find out.|`|2HNrT4Cwaa	No i would think that shouldn't be allowed, student confidentiality.<br>  hope i was of help=D|`|byNiRl0Xaa	the teacher can in fact ring the persons parents as they are under no obligation to keep something that serious from her parents.<br>  <br>  there is no real student/teacher privacy agreement although the teacher may not because as you said, the issue is now dealt with and telling the parents wont change anything about the situation.|`|IqcQ7pnfaa	Abortion is a thing that shocks parents when they know they're innocent young little girl have had that. Surely, this hiding can't go on forever and someone has to make a change. The teacher can. To make it the best solution, YOUR FRIEND should be the one to tell. It won't come from any stranger but it should come from your friend.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, that does happen. Your blood volume increases by quite a bit during pregnancy and your kidneys and bladder are working overtime. I actually went to the doctor early on in pregnancy because I thought I had an infection, it turned out to be nothing, I guess they were just adjusting to the extra work load. It would probably be a good idea to have your urine checked though just in case, you don't want to have a kidney infection and miss it, they are terribly painful and dangerous too. I'm willing to bet everything is okay though, but better to err on the safe side.|`|v3LnJycKaa	when you are pregnant it is a lot more responsibilty for your kidneys, there is increased blood volume, and we all know kidneys filter the blood, this alone can cause some discomfort... but you are also more prone to kindey and bladder infections when preggo, def have your urine checked...|`|6nahE51laa	this is something to talk to your doctor about asap. i never had any complications during my pregnancy until i was about 8 months pregnant, my kidneys were hurting and i had an infection, i was gonna be induced into labor because this is very dangerous for baby. call your doc to be on the safe side|`|AA10458750	yes, but make sure you are drinking lots of water throughout the day so a kidney infection doens't start up.|`|81Ru1OL6aa	yeah|`|K8le7LRkaa	Yes they can.  Be sure to let your doc know though... could be the onset of an infection.|`|xt5zyXJwaa	Yes|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's not pregnancy, that's a urinary tract infection and you need help from your doctor, your kidneys are working overtime with pregnancy and this can be very bad.
lJ5Ao2aIaa	You don't really need to do anything, but if it bothers you, try shampooing more frequently and gently brushing your baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel.<br>  <br>  For stubborn cases, some parents find an oil remedy helpful. (The oil helps to loosen dry flakes.) If you want to give it a try, rub just a small amount of a pure, natural oil — such as almond or olive oil — on your baby's scalp and leave it on for about 15 minutes. Then gently comb out the flakes with a fine-toothed comb or brush them out with a soft brush.<br>  <br>  Be sure to follow up by washing your baby's scalp with a gentle baby shampoo — the last thing you want to do is leave oil on his head, which could clog the pores and cause the flakes to stick. You might try leaving the shampoo on for a few minutes before rinsing, to help cut the oil.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	My son had it bad and i put baby oil on him then brushed it with a soft brush and then gave him a bath and washed his hair twice with johnson shampoo until it was gone about 3 days it cleared up.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This probably isn't the answer you want, but it's mostly time that gets rid of it.  You can wash his hair each night with baby shampoo and then brush it gently with a soft baby brush, that helps a little.  It took about 3 weeks to see results with my son using that method.  But then it started to go away pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  I was not comfortable using the other methods and my pediatrician recommended against them unless it was a really severe problem.|`|yCwPxulYaa	What everyone else said is what worked for me.<br>  <br>  I gave my daughter a warm bath so that her scalp was soft.  Then I rubbed baby oil on her head and used a fine tooth comb to comb off the flakes.  It worked instantly and has never come back.<br>  <br>  ETA:  My daughter showed no signs of it bothering her when we did this. She was about 2 months old at the time.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I found the best way was a long bath, wash hair, then use a fine (plastic) nit comb to pull all the gunk out. I didn't want to use any special shampoos or anything as we all have sensitive skin.<br>  This worked immediately and it still hasn't come back - a good 12 weeks later.<br>  Remember that it may be unsightly, but it doesn't irritate baby - so be gentle.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	we've always put a little bit of baby oil in the microwave (just so its not cold) and then rubbed that on our son's head and used a good textured washcloth to rub the baby oil in circles where the cradle cap was at...then we would either put a little hat (like the ones from the hospital) on or let him be depending on the weather...worked pretty good for us...|`|qfuhHeDjaa	pour baby oil on her head a let it sit, usually best before a nap so it can sit while she sleeps, then take a fine tooth comb and scrape her head, youll see it all flake off. when your washing her hair take a brush and use a circular motion.<br>  <br>  it might take a few times to get it all but its the only thing ive found that works|`|sAbah6dTaa	there is a lotion made by johnson and johnson (if i remember correctly) it has baby oil in it, put some of that on it and gently scratch at it, i know you aren't suppose to, but i always did, didn't hurt it, did go away, my daughter had it in her eye brows. =/
HocTLdleaa	My doctor encouraged sex because the semen is a natural cervix softener. If your water has not broken it should be ok. <br>  <br>   I had contractions for four days, but it never turned into the real thing. After 20-30 min the contractions would always stop. When I went in labour it felt like my son was dancing in circles, the pain went from mild to worse and did not ever stop until I delivered. It was about 10 hours long. <br>  <br>  If you are having any pain start timing it for an hour. If the contactions dont stop after an hour or are 5 min apart call your midwife. <br>  I dont think you will last until Monday. Congratulations, you are going to be a Mommy very soon.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes it was okay.  The only time it's not okay is if you are supposed to have pelvic rest, you have a ruptured amniotic sack, or you're in labor - otherwise go to it.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	nobody can really give you a specific answer. the sex is fine and is actually encouraged because the semen will thin the cervix which will help it to dilate more. As long as your water hasn't broken you can keep going at it. the worst thing it is going to do is do nothing and the best is that it may put you into labor with timeable contractions. I got the gel inserted the day before i was due to be induced and it kickstarted labor. ask if you can get the gel the night before you are induced. worked great for me. and if it doesn't start labor then it will at least help your cervix dilate more for the following day<br>  <br>  good luck!! it's worth everything once you see your precious baby!|`|kPcJmuiZaa	yes *** is very good for the cervix when i got opened up by the doctor i had sex on the night and i felt my cervix pulling next day i was in labour good look

e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Abortion is legal in almost every country in the world. And pretty much it is not a topic of debate.

P0Fjh59Eaa	What my husband and i have always done was to write down 10-20 names that we like on our own lists, then we switched lists. <br>  if we each had a list of 10 we marked off 5 names from each others lists, then switched back and discussed why we liked the remaining 5 names, then we switched back and marked 3 names off each others lists and looked at the 4 names we had left, (2 a piece). <br>  <br>  he picked his fav off my list, and i picked my fav off his list of the remaining names and then we paired it with our first name choice (or middle name choice) and talked over which ones we liked best. <br>  <br>  sounds forever long, but it really didn't take as long as it sounds and we are both very happy w/the names we chose.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Lynn<br>  Caitlyn (or any other variation)<br>  Rae<br>  Joy<br>  Marie<br>  Rose<br>  Christine<br>  Genevieve<br>  Claire<br>  Heather<br>  Natalie<br>  Brooke<br>  Kelly<br>  Mary|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I think Elisabeth would sound really nice|`|qQsFTkWmaa	you do want do want something short...<br>  <br>  id saw you both need to make a list of middle name that have no more the 5 letters and cant en in a A or start with a U and see f you both come up with one you both like<br>  <br>  <br>  list 10 names<br>  None over 5 letter<br>  Cant start with U<br>  Cant end with a A<br>  he cant use Starr as his 10|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	I would choose Raye!

0EZ0W5FPaa	Pretty quickly.  And it depends on what you're eating.  Some foods within a couple of hours, others half a day.  My daughter always reacted to and type of soda I drank.

z6IekuwSaa	Big Big thing; WRITE YOUR CHILD'S NAME ON THE BAG. Best piece of advice I've heard on the subject. Most bags have a space on top to put your name|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Just put the bottle or bag of breast milk on ice or in a cooler with a cold pack.  It will stay good that way for several hours.  They make insulated bags with slots for ice packs just for that purpose if you want to go look in the baby aisles of stores like Target.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	it is fine to freeze as long as its shaken well once thawed, otherwise keep in fridge then in a cooler bag with ice packs at bottom..
fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	He is still young and needs your help getting to sleep. You might try rocking him before he gets to the point of being really over-tired. He will not become spoiled, but will likely feel more secure and will eventually be easier to put to sleep. He will be independent in time, it will happen when he is ready. <br>  <br>  Best of luck & take care!|`|kj1md6t0aa	You CAN spoil a child at this age, so ignore the other person that said you cannot. My son is spoiled. He's about four months old.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's every parent's decision, I cannot let my son cry, I feel terrible! Haha. Hense the reason he is spoiled. :X My bad.|`|z6IekuwSaa	In my opinion, and I'm not even close to being a parent expert, I don't think you can spoil him at that age. He's communicating to you by crying that he wants his pacifier back in his mouth. You respond by going in the room and doing what he's asked. I think that may be teaching him how talking works, you know without the words. I wouldn't let him cry it out. I'm not a fan of that genre of thinking, you're letting him know you're there for him. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, even if some call that spoiled|`|6nn7f41Faa	He is still too young. You cannot spoil a child at his age. We didn't start the cry it out method until my daughter was over a year and every other sleep method didn't work. Have you tried ferberizing? Or try putting him down an hour earlier than you usually do. Apparently kids are more difficult to get down when they're overtired. Or even just rock/sway gently with him to light music until he falls asleep.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|VCCKfT3taa	At some point in our lives we all have to learn how to soothe ourselves back to sleep when we wake up. By the books, a child should be able to master this skill by 6 or 7 months at the latest. <br>  So now would be a good time to try and work on starting that. <br>  It won't hurt him to, when you hear him start to cry at night, let him wail for about 1 or 2  minutes. Then go in and comfort him, let him know you're there, but don't play or pick him up. Stroke his head and tell him it's sleepy time, maybe sing a little song. <br>  Then leave. <br>  Next time, wait a little longer. And next time, wait just a little longer. <br>  Finally, give it about 5 minutes before you go in. <br>  <br>  Bottom line: if you KNOW for a fact that he doesn't need anything, then it's okay to let him cry for a very short while. It's important to try and let babies work out problems for themselves every once in a while.
kdSuwt8paa	The main worry is that you seem to be in some doubt about whether he is your own child or your nephew.

DDYwnut6aa	Your luteal phase may be more or less than 14 days.  A normal luteal phase can be 10 to 16 days long (though 10 is on the short side).  Mine is 12 days. So you should cover ALL those days.  The only way to know for sure what your luteal phase is is to chart your basal body temperature.  Go to <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a> for more information.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|a1uoxczTaa	i just did a fertility predictor on what you said. it says that best time to baby dance would be march 4-8. your due date would be November 29th. here is the link if u wna try.<br>  <a href="http://www.parents.com/app/fertilitypredictor/?sssdmh=dm17.362024&esrc=nwpc&email=holidaeshawty@yahoo.com&_requestid=174614" rel="nofollow">http://www.parents.com/app/fertilitypred...</a>
DDYwnut6aa	No, it won't stay positive if the egg was fertilized.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|SulyNiY7aa	The LH surge that is predicted on the home ovulation kits is tricky! When you test and get a postitve sign for the LH surge this means only that you WILL be ovulating with 24 -72 hours. The surge goes away after the egg is released regardless of whether or not the egg is fertalized. It is NOT true that it will stay positive if the egg is fertalized.  The LH surge goes away regardless.

l79QIWszaa	Some hospital labs have this service; mostly in places that are far from cities or that do special diagnostic testing.  You will have to talk to your physician about it and see where to go.  I do not believe that you need a doctors order for it, but it will take a few phone calls to figure out.|`|clCF3UfZaa	private labs. be prepared to shell out a lot of money. but first educate yourselves using google about the test and its results itself so you know what amount of information is needed. You dont want to pay for something when you dont know how to read or understand the results.<br>  <br>  Obviously something tells me that you are a very pissed off person|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	If you are in the UK you should be able to at some not all.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I don't believe so. My nephew is going through this right now with his son. His son may not be his. I believe the doctor said that he would refer them to a DNA centre, or they would do the swabs in his office, and send it to a DNA centre, but I don't think hey do it right in the office.|`|2GhwuXksaa	For an accurate answer, you should call or visit your local surgery. If they will not do it, there are many other options such as internet tests where you get the kit posted to you and you send it back.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	At some doctors you can but you can also get it done at a blood work clinic.
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Probably. I know it does for us, to some extent. Not so much political, but religious. I suppose in certain instances those two are tied together. <br>  <br>  But we don't influence our children to think along the lines we do as far as politics. I'm not running around screaming how great the Conservative Party is (because, really, things aren't so great right now!) but my conservative views are manifested in the way I parent, I guess. <br>  <br>  Religion wise, it influences us greatly in how we parent, from prayer at home to church and trying our best to raise our children to know God. This is something that is very important to us. As far as Buddhists or Jews, I don't know - if they practice their religion like we do, it's probably the same, just a different set of beliefs. Atheism, however, to me is just another religion, or an organized set of beliefs (like any religion) that emphasizes a lack of God and faith instead of the presence of God and faith. To me, it's the same thing, only from opposite ends of the spectrum.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that your political & spiritual views shape the kind of person who you are, how you interact with others in the world.  This includes how you interact with your children.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	That depends on what you mean by "the way they parent." Do you mean discipline techniques, or if they're "fun" parents, etc?<br>  <br>  I was raised by Baptist parents, both of my parents were conservative and they taught us to respect everyone regardless of their sexual preference, religion, race, etc. We went to church every Sunday. My mom let me get away with murder but my dad was very strict.<br>  <br>  My husband and I are both liberal. We teach our kids to respect everyone regardless of their sexual preferences, religion, race, etc. My husband and I are not religious and we don't go to church, but we read the Bible to our kids, along with the Qu'ran and the Torah and the Tao Ching. I'm very strict and my husband not so much.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i've often wondered about the correlation between your views on politics and your parenting styles.  i think the norm follows that correlation, but of course there are exceptions to that rule.  i think that your political views and your religious views shape a good number of your values and beliefs anyway so why wouldn't there be a relation to the political side as well.<br>  in terms of parenting differently, of course, everyone parents differently from everyone.  i have yet to meet anyone who does anything the exact same as everyone else, regardless of anything else.  its the same as everything else, a christian democrat name Mary is just as different than a christian democrat name Jennifer.  Same general beliefs but different.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I would think for many it would. I for one changed my religious views somewhat when I became more aware of the political platforms I was taking. That in turn affects the way I handle discussions w/my children about anything from the friends they keep to the choices they make and it also makes me have to re-evaluate certain choices I have made or am going to make. Like the homesteading (I know it's not political but it is a religion to me) I for instance have to remind myself that I wanted to micro-farm and that the shirt from anthropologie needs to wait if I want to buy something for the farm (the same applies to buying crap toys for the kids or saving for something more enriching). I know my values and hopefully I stay true to them when it comes to my parenting.....sorry if the answer went too far from topic.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I think honestly it depends on the person.. for instance "a bleeding heat liberal" (LOL) may be more liberal in their parenting, or they may be the complete opposite and be very conservative about their parenting.. It depends on the way the person views things. Some are able to keep politics and child rearing in two separate places, some aren't! <br>  I think that christian parents are more likely to rise their children to be christian, atheists to rise atheist children, so on and so forth. The religion of a person can have some bearing on how they raise their children, or it can have little to no affect at all.<br>  I think it's important to note here that an atheist parent, a jewish parent, a buddhist parent or what ever belief system the parent(s) have has little to no bearing on the ability to raise a child either. All belief systems have the ability to raise the same type of child! (Except maybe satin worshipers..but that is another story!)|`|laRjvObCaa	I think anyone who strictly believes a certain set of beliefs are going to parent based on that, whether it be a Christian, Liberal, or Conservative.  I think those who are unyielding in their beliefs tend to be more fanatical then about how they teach things to their children.  I personally am more flexible and open in my belief system, which allows me to be a more flexible parent.<br>  <br>  I consider myself a Republican.  I lean towards fiscal conservatism, but am a bit more moderate in my religious and social views.  For example, I support gay marriage, which most Republicans do not.  I am pro-life, but I also do not think somebody who has an abortion is a murderer.  I just think its selfish when other alternatives that would allow a child to live exist, like adoption.  <br>  <br>  My parenting style is... pretty open.  I try to be as creative as possible with my little girl... playing goofy games and really just nurturing her mind.  Though I'm not overally religious, I do want her to have some foundation of faith.  So we pray together, and I try to teach her altriusm so she'll have a giving spirit.|`|fLGWmGgMaa	Well, of course. If I am a conservative, I don't want to instill liberal beliefs into my children, and it goes the same oppositely. Obviously children should decide for themselves,<br>  <br>  This goes even more so for religion. I am a Methodist Christian, so I am going to bring any children up in the way of the Lord as by my beliefs. If I was Catholic, or Muslim or any other religion, I would raise my children by my beliefs, especially if the book I look at as Holy has information on raising children, like in the Bible, Proverbs 22:3.<br>  <br>  So yes, Political Beliefs and Religion (among other things) affect parenting|`|eISzHe5maa	I think in a way it does. My mom is very liberal (but she sometimes leans towards a lot of Republican presidents/candidates). She always taught me to try to always accept people despite what color, gender, or their sexual preference is. My mom is extremely supportive of the GLBT (including transgender!) community. As a result, I'm also very active in our GLBT club in school.<br>  <br>  My mom is very pro - choice and when I was younger I did and as I grew up I did research and stuff to form my own opinion and I am strongly pro - choice. <br>  <br>  We're not very religious either. I've never set foot in a church, I don't think I've even read the bible. I don't know what we'd call us, I personally think I'm more Agnostic but I just think we also don't care to learn about religion and that it's not going to affect us if we do.
uPpBog09aa	It is possible for a child that age to be teething. My son got his first tooth around 2 months. You can give him Ibuprofen or Tylenol  if he seems uncomfortable. You could also try rubbing a cold wet cloth along his gums for him, and give lots of cuddles. My advise though, is do NOT use Orajel because if any goes down their throat, it has been known to stop breathing in babies, so it is not worth the risk.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	that's gas - he is trying to get gas up. he needs more burping...try some gripe water or infacol<br>  <br>  edit - "He will also gum at his bottle, my arm, fingers and his hands.

I'm not a mom, but I do know hair. You're ALWAYS safe with layers because, with me anyway, you don' even have to dry it for it to look good and it gives you an edge.

I'm mixed so my hair has never been the wash-and-go type. It's nice to be able to put it in a bun in minutes and call it a day.

Straight, thin, thick, wavy, curly? How long is it now?<br>  <br>  I think a cute shorter style is the inverted bob. Tell your stylist you want an inverted bob but that you don't want the sides any shorter than your chin (maybe even a bit longer)<br>  <br>  if you don't know what an inverted bob is, it's when the back is shorter than the front, the front (sides) comes down long a bit past the chin while the back is stacked and layered. I'll look for a photo and add it to my answer in a moment.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay here are a few different ones but you can ask her to go longer or shorter depending what you like.  The other thing about the inverted bob is you can have bangs or not have them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/images/_MG_8913_250h.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/images/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/jes3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/jes3....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.index.hr/thumbnail.ashx?path=/images2/holmesbewzbckham222W.jpg&width=662&o=a" rel="nofollow">http://www.index.hr/thumbnail.ashx?path=...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/e1/4/AAAAAr9bB9oAAAAAAOFJBw.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/e1/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/katie_holmes_hair_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/k...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aahairstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2009-Hairstyles-Short-Bob-Hairstyles-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aahairstyle.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/singer/kelly-clarkson/pictures/kelly-clarkson-picture-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/singe...</a><br>  <br>  here is Kelly Clarkson with the inverted bob<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/Inverted+Bob+Haircuts/articles/70/Inverted+Bob+Hairstyles" rel="nofollow">http://www.zimbio.com/Inverted+Bob+Hairc...</a>|`|AA11203836	i recently had the same problem. i had my hair done in a katie holmes style..not the bobbed one but she has it sort of shaggy bobbed now. every one gives me compliments on it, and i have never been happier. its soooo easy to style. i can also blow dry it in about 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes with my hair long. my favorite part is i can get up and take the kids to school and my hair looks just great in the morning when i get out of bed!|`|prqrQcd1aa	I always do long layers everywhere and that shape my face.

I4WfmJMqaa	Ronald McDonald pops out of a big cake and yells "Big Mac!"<br>  <br>  That is normally enough to make most women go into labor immediately.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	they give you oxytocin to make the uterus contract. but i heard its a shitty deal because its basically forcing you to hae the baby and is a very very long process.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	There are a few different ways to do an induction - they can do a sweep as previous said, but that's not really an effective induction method, it's not very successful. Sometimes they will use a gel or tablet and insert it into your cervix, which releases hormones to trigger contractions.  Sometimes they will pop your waters with a stick thingy (doesn't hurt, don't worry you can't feel a thing) and the last resort (although I suppose this depends on the hospital, here in England it's usually the last resort!) is to use syntocinon which is a drug that they administer by IV. <br>  <br>  Once you have been induced, basically, you start feeling contractions the same way you would if you went into labour naturally.  Often after an induction the contractions come on faster and stronger, mainly because they have given you hormones that stimulate your uterus and the contractions. As a result, many hospitals, doctors, midwives really suggest you have an epidural if you have been induced.  But, it's not always the case -  depends on your pain threshold and your own indivudual labour circumstances.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	They first try just...can't remember what it's called, but separating your membranes with their finger. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't send you into labor, they sometimes will decide to chemically induce. First they'll rub some medicine on your cervix to see if that works, if not, they give you medication through an IV.<br>  <br>  For me, the IV medication (pitocin) worked right away and I had intense contractions from the start and they lasted 16 hours.|`|pYzOZP3Xaa	It might be a stretch and sweep where they sweep a finger accross your cervic to try and set you off, or you can be induced by drugs that are given via a drip in your hand, or they may break your waters with a hook, which is pretty self explanitory. None of these methods hurt they are just uncomfortable but they can be side effects such as cramping, bellyache, stronger contractions or NOTHING MIGHT HAPPEN, in which case they may give you more drugs and as a last resort a c-section!|`|AA11746368	They give you an IV, and you start getting contractions.  It's pretty simple, really.  I fell asleep while they were inducing me, as there were a couple of hours before I had to do any real work.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	I was induced with a drug called Petocin, when you are induced it can take a very long time until delivery.  My water broke, I still wasn't dialating to their satisfaction so they induced my labor, I did'nt have the baby for another 20+ hours.  Technically when your water breaks you should have the baby soon there after, so if your water HAS NOT broken then that would be the method they will probaby choose to unduce, they will break your water.|`|AA12138902	well, first I feel I wasn't try that before til now but if I had I will try to think about it " is it good or bad" then I would choose what am I to do next ...|`|tr21QsNcaa	You go right into labor contractions they probably break your water bag and then you have a beautiful baby in a few moments

HPtiIHcjaa	First, it is not too late.  You need to contact a lactation consultant.  Every mother can breastfeed even ones with flat nipples.  I even personally know a lady who adopted an infant and breatfed it... but it takes a lot of work.<br>  <br>  Sounds more like you and bf need to sit down and communicate.  You, without tears, need to say "I need your help.  This is OUR daughter and she needs her daddy to be a part of her life.  That includes helping me by changing her diapers, feeding her a bottle,....  I also need you to be extra sensitive to me feelings because my hormones are all whackeded right now."  Men need women to be very specific (without crying, screaming, demanding).  This is probably all new to him and he doesn't even have a clue what to do.  He doesn't mean to be a jerk, he's just clueless and doesn't know how to cope, either. <br>  <br>  Your emotions are normal because your hormones are all messed up.  And this can't be easy while going to school, also.  Make sure you take time for yourself, regularly, without the baby for an hour (get him to take care of baby ot find a babysitter).  Time to relax, hot baths, pray, read, whatever you can do to destress and regain perspective on life.<br>  <br>  Communication is the key!  Best wishes!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Grief.  Men.  Thank God my husband wasn't like that atleast.  Now, I admit he doesn't change as many diapers as he once did and he never feeds Thomas unless I've already made the food, etc. . . that's annoying and I'm the one that usually watches him unless I force him to watch him.<br>  <br>  Don't feel threatened by him.  Really.  You know what's best for your daughter.  You are Mommy!   I'd love to see the guys take on our job for just ONE full day with breastfeeding, changing diapers, making bottles, etc. . . and see how they feel.  I know they wouldn't be complaining.<br>  <br>  I have flat nipples to for the most part.  Ummm, have you ever tried those medela nipple shields?  It helps your baby latch on and it pulls your nipple to the front of the shield from the suction and helps the baby get the milk out and nurse.  I used those with my son.  =)<br>  <br>  Edit:  Here you go!<br>  <a href="http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/products/breastfeeding-devices/213/20mm-nipple-shield" rel="nofollow">http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/pro...</a>|`|FmSWPS7Paa	thats just perfectly fine that you wanted to breeastfeed but the flat nipples made it a whole lot difficult. I only lasted like 2 weeks breastfeeding my son and gave up because it hurt so much and plus he gave me thrush. it hurt as hell. but i was happy because he was getting his milk from formula and it made it a whole lot easier too because i too am also a full time student. good luck and dont feel guilty at all about this. i guess hes just being a jerk lol he'll come around.|`|9eF6ScG3aa	if he is not in the picture full time what makes him such an authority on how the baby is going to act, just tell him if he wants the baby breast fed to do it himself, you can also tell him that just because your giving the baby formula does not mean that there will be any problems with the baby, yes breast milk is supposed to be better for them but if the baby can't get any milk from you it won't do her much good will it. <br>  you are not being a bad mother as a matter of fact it sounds like your doing every thing possible that you can for your child and probably much more. just tell your boyfriend until he walks a mile in your shoe's not to be so judgmental and that you are doing your very best for your child. do not let him upset you like this you already have enough on your plate just keep taking good care of yourself and your child.<br>  also when he comes over for his ONE NIGHT visit maybe you should go spend the night with a friend and let him take care of the baby by himself and see how easy he thinks it is, plus you need a break every once in a while, take it  from a mom of 3, all grown, all were fed formula and they are fine|`|AA11220327	DO NOT LET ANYONE MAKE YOU FEEL INADEQUATE FOR NOT BREASTFEEDING!!!!! I have been there. My oldest wouldnt latch on, So i pumped and supplemented with formula. Even the hospital staff berated me and made me feel like a bad mother because i wasnt breatfeeding, but i believe that it is a personal choice. She is now a healthy, tall, energetic 5 year old. With my 2nd, I chose not to breastfeed, I didnt want to have the same latch problems, and with a then 14 month old to chase after, pumping worked into my life much better, since it meant that their dad could help with feeding. He is now a healthy, energetic outgoing almost 4 year old. I informed my midwife that i am also not planning to breastfeed this time, as pumping has worked great for me so far, and my husband wants to be able to help with feeding. <br>  Just for the sake of argument, myself and 2 siblings were also not breatfed, and grew up totally healthy, are now healthy adults with kids of our own. <br>  Just remember that this is YOUR choice and no one elses. They are your breasts, and you decide what is done with them and when. If you want to talk to someone that has been in a similar situation, feel free to send me a message.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Your bf sounds like my husband! My husband & I actually got in a fight at the hospital about breastfeeding. I did not want to due to the same issues you have ( flat nipples). So I did pump for the first 5 weeks just to get him off my back. He was persistent I breastfeed the baby so I gave it a try and was bleeding from my nipples due to a bad latch from the baby, once I pulled up my shirt and made him look he finally got over it. Not only are you crying because of hormones but yes he is being a jerk! You are doing nothing wrong for formula feeding your baby, you are giving her what is best for her since you can;t breastfeed. Don't feel bad and tell him to get off your back and that he is making you feel bad! He will get over it!|`|fHgbL046aa	Wow He's being very inconsiderate. I understand he wants his baby healthy but if you can't do it then you can't do it. I tried to breast feed my daughter and gave up after 2 weeks. I did not have enough milk and could only produce 1 bottle for my boyfriend to feed her. She also fell asleep every time I fed her. When she was born she slept 17 hours a day for about a week. I did feel guilty because I wasn't breast feeding her, but I had to realize I am a good mom and using formula is not a horrible thing. <br>  Why is he not changing any diapers that is awful and he may love his child, but he needs to step up and be a father. You seem like a single mom because your doing this all by your self. Someone needs to talk to this guy. Having a baby is a two person job. He must love being able to come and go when he wants and doesn't have to listen to a crying baby. Your gonna need some help because your dealing with a lot and you need some alone time. Why can't he take the baby for a walk while you do your own thing or go out with some girlfriends while he watches the baby. I hope things go well for you Good Luck.|`|1cdfec2697940a7924276a038673bb29aa	he is being an *** believe me you should know how you feel breastfeeding and he shouldnt tell you how you should feel. Thats about it. Its wrong that he makes you feel like that|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I think that's ridiculous that he yelled at you.  What a jerk!  <br>  <br>  I had flat nipples too.  It is possible to draw them out (and I did).  The thing is, if you don't know what to do and have all the support you need, it's near impossible to make it work.  For next time, try Medela's TheraShells for inverted/flat nipples.  You can wear them in your bra during the end of pregnancy (and in the first days of breastfeeding) to help draw the nipples out.  Also, I used a nipple shield (extremely thin piece of silicone with a nipple on it that goes over your flat nipple) and it helped my daughter latch on until my nipple came out.  These shouldn't be overused, though, or they can cause supply problems and sometimes even nipple confusion.  I linked both of these in the sources.<br>  <br>  He shouldn't blame you for not breastfeeding.  If he'd really wanted you to do it, he should've been busting his butt to change every diaper and bring you everything you needed from day one while you sat with the baby and rested.  He should've been asking the nurses a million questions about what they could do to help.  He should've gone and rented you a pump.  He fell short, not you.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	He shouldn't have yelled at you. Nursing is the best and yes baby's who are formula fed do tend to have more problems but it's not a guarantee. Your doing what you have to do.|`|RHX1yFb5aa	Ummm... your dude is a jerk! I did not breast feed my daughter and the nurse at the hospital kept telling me "Breast is best, you should try it, your baby will be smarter!" I found it very annoying I finally told her that it is a personal choice and if formula was bad for baby it would not be FDA approved.  <br>  <br>  As for the breast milk making them smarter, if my daughter were any smarter, I would be truely frightened! She can carry on an intelligent conversation with ANYONE, adult or child and she has been able to read since the age of three and I am not just bragging because she is my daughter, my mother had a daycare the from the time I was 6 until I was in my 20s (I had to help) and my parents were foster parents from the time I was 12-17.  I have only seen one child in all that time who was as articulate and smart as my daughter.  So if I were you I would not worry about the affects of formula on a baby and tell the boyfriend to take a hike!|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Breastfeeding can be very difficult, and I imagine even more so with flat nipples. <br>  <br>  Your daughter will be fine. Yes, it is better to nurse, but not if it's going to cause you such stress.|`|jiTKnCKpaa	I think he is totally out of order, while it may be better to breastfeed not every mother does and they go on to have perfectly happy and healthy children its your choice you are pretty much bringing her up alone anyway and even if you did tell your doctor your not breastfeeding I doubt anyones going to think your a bad parent. don't feel guilt, you tried and it didn't work as long as your daughters being fed that's main thing wheather it be by breast or bottle.|`|laRjvObCaa	I didn't breastfeed my daughter.  With the full support both my ob/gyn BEFORE birth and my peditrician afterwards.  I was going to try to breastfeed despite not really wanting to (personal reasons), and my ob/gyn told me something that finally made me feel liberated.  "However you feed, just feed with love.  If you do not want to do something and force yourself to please other people, you are going to fail and you'll be creating tension between your baby and you during feeding time.  That's a time to bond, so bottle feed if thats what you want, but make sure you create the same type of closeness that would happen with breastfeeding."  (obviously, that's a general idea... not verbatim.) <br>  <br>  That made me feel so much better.  And my husband, who'd been pushing the issue before that, finally let up after hearing a professional say that it was okay to go the alternate route.  <br>  <br>  My peditrician's opinion was that yes, breastmilk was best.  But the formula could provide just as much nutrition as well.  He also reinforced the importance of bonding at feeding time.  He taught me that when I bottle feed, alternate sides (like you would with breastfeeding) so that sometimes she faces me from the other way.  To try to maintain eye contact as much as possible with my daughter during feeding.  Etc.  <br>  <br>  My daughter is now 17 months old - and very attached to me (in a positive way.)
wENdWT5kaa	First you don't need to feel guilty about formula feeding, you might as well say you feel guilty for feeding your baby, period. Formula isn't poison, don't let him or anyone else tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  If he is so passionate about his daughter, why isn't he there everyday seeing her? I don't believe he is,  it sounds like the baby is there whenever he wants to see her. <br>  <br>  As for the diaper changing, that is normal amongst most guys, so don't worry about that. <br>  <br>  Don't let him yell at you. Stand up to him and tell him that what you are doing is right for you and your daughter. Don't let him or anyone else step all over you. <br>  <br>  My husband never yelled at me for not bf'ing after 6 weeks, because, well i had dried up,  but there are times where he feels he knows better then me when it comes to our children, but yet, i'm with my children 24/7 and he's not. He rarely spends time with them when he is home, but yet he feels he needs to criticize some of my parenting technique. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to him and tell him he needs to stop pushing you on this subject. YOu have made a choice, the best choice for you and your baby. And he just has to suck it up and accept it. Or tell him he can breastfeed. (apparently this is possible).<br>  <br>  Again, DO NOT feel guilty for the choices you make as a mother, no one has the right to put you down for your choices or parenting choices.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	There's no point trying to get him to understand, cos some people can't understand how difficult it can be to breastfeed. He's just going to have to accept you're not going to breastfeed. It's not your fault you can't.<br>  There are millions of formula fed babies who are perfectly healthy, don't feel guilty. He should be thankful his daughter is getting fed! Please don't feel bad, you're a good mummy and you shouldn't feel guilty for not starving your daughter. xx|`|AA10202389	Guys are only stupid because they don't use their intuition. If you could read some on all the latest in Emotional Intelligence that applies to counseling, families and for work. It's also used in sports, but if he doesn't get some help, he'll stay a mess. You could tell him what you wrote here without telling him you wrote it here. People need careful detailed explanations when they're left brained and lame brained. Really, there is hope for men, I know. LOL  You'll just have to learn it all for yourself so you can teach it subtley. You will find you become a powerful person also, if you do the work. The downside is that you won't feel you need him anymore. Oh, well.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	he doesnt know and cant possibly know what you are going through, he cant try it and doesnt know the complications of breastfeeding and how hard and demanding it is<br>  <br>  obviously i am pro breastfeeding because of the major benefits for the baby but i am also pro formula feeding if it doesnt work out as i know how hard it is! millions of babies are formula fed with absolutely no problems and are perfectly healthy, you tried it and it didnt work for you - be proud your doing what works best for you and your baby - your being a great mum keep up the good work hunni :) at least you tried to do it - ignore breastfeeding obsessives who only see in black and white xxx|`|ROJans2Taa	I know the guilty feeling, I as well had tremendous problems with the latch and my son is my second, I had bleeding scabbed over nipples, and man did I try, I would cry while feeding him because each time he'd tear the scab off and it would be bleeding through the whole feeding, anyway, my whole point is, you tried, men dont get to have a say, when they grow breast then they can have an opinion, they dont know the pain we go through, I know my husband was  a little disappointed when I started formula, mainly becuase it's costing a fortune, hold your head high, I wasnt even formula fed when I was a baby, my mom gave me cow's milk from infancy, back then it wasnt considered a problem, the main thing is your feeding your baby, my doctor said to me when I was stressed about bottle feeding, in the end when they are 20 no ones going to be able to tell who was breastfed and who wasnt, it made me feel 100x better. wishing you luck!<br>  <br>  added info - Abigail's mommy - I do think men should get a say in 'some' things, just not breastfeeding|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Well firstly I can't believe how judgemental some of these answers are...<br>  Even the breastfeeding extremists admit that in order to breastfeed through obstacles, you need support. It's obvious that you haven't had any. Of course, it's the best thing you can do for your child, but at least you tried. As for the man's say in it - generally yes they should have a say (but not the deciding factor), but if he's not willing to stick around and help and support you to do it, then no - he shouldn't get a say.<br>  You're not letting her starve, that's all I care about. I'd slap that bf of yours myself if I were able to, because if he wants what's best for baby, he'll be willing to do more about it himself.|`|2JkeD3Gaaa	You both have bigger issues- him only visiting once a week is ridiculous!<br>  <br>  For the record, WIC would have given you a free pump AND they now have excellent breastfeeding support.|`|758cDKEFaa	you really need to talk to him about this.<br>  your doing a great job!you dont need to breastfeed to have a healthy baby.<br>  i didnt breastfeed my son and dont plan on breastfeeding my next baby when he/she arrives that doesnt make them any less healthier!<br>  men just dont understand cos its not them that has to do it!|`|955YoHvVaa	The most you can do is try and you at least did that he needs to stop acting like a jerk..he comes around once a week and thinks he can judge how your raise your child?? I'd be hitting him with a reality check..if he cares so much for your child why does he not go with you to appointments? Why does he visit once a week? Are you serious..my husband never did any of that..my daughter was in the nicu and I pumped breast milk for her and thought I would breastfeed when she got out but she was hooked to the bottle and not once did he give me crap for not breastfeeding also my husband goes to all her appointments..you need to tell him exactly how you feel and tell him if he wants to judge the way you parent he needs to come around more then once a week..what a jerk.|`|AA11918778	As long as you tried hon don't sweat it.  <br>  <br>  As for your milk if you truly want to try to breastfeed it is possible (but hard) to get your milk supply to return after it has dried up.  You can also get these little things that you put on that help with inverted nipples and make it so your baby can latch or so you can use a pump.  Talk to someone with La Leche league if you want to try to get started again.  <br>  <br>  If it's just too hard and you don't have full time help tell the boyfriend to mind his business and that you are doing the best you can.|`|AA12243380	*BIG HUGS*<br>  <br>  I can see why you would choose to formula feed.  I honestly can.  I have done both, I formula fed my twins for reasons not exactly the same as yours but similar.  They wouldn't latch on when they were born, there were 2 of them, I worked and I had to return to my job when they were 2 weeks old and while I did bring them with me to work I was still at work and not able to sit there topless with a pump attached to me all day long with customers and workers coming in and out of the office.  I was working for my dad's electrical contracting business and there were men in and out of there all day long.  It just wasn't something I could see doing so after they were 3 weeks old I just formula fed them.<br>  <br>  I struggled with guilt too, my husband was the hardest one to deal with when it came to my choice because he was very, dare I say militant?  He only wanted "the best" for his babies.  The thing is, they were my primary responsibility to care for and I knew that I had a virtually impossible task in front of me given my own circumstances.  My husband just had to understand.<br>  <br>  Now, you tell your boyfriend that you talked to someone who formula fed her 21 month old twins and they are the picture of good health and they're advanced in their speech and cognitive skills!  Formula doesn't always mean that the kid is going to be sick a lot and not as smart,.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Try not to feel guilty but I know how hard it is.  I wasn't able to let go of the guilt until the girls were toddlers.  Even now I feel somewhat guilty but only because I have a new baby that I'm breastfeeding.  The thing is, my life is different now.  I am home full time and he didn't have any latching issues at all.  I feel bad sometimes that I didn't nurse my girls and I am nursing him but I just have to remember that life was different then.|`|Q7jMH5praa	Don't feel bad about not breastfeeding there are millions of formula fed babies out there that are just as healthy as breastfed babies. <br>  <br>  I stopped breastfeeding after a month because of latch problems. My husband really wanted me to breastfeed but supported my decision to switch to formula. He knew that because they are my breasts that it was my decision. The end. <br>  <br>  Honestly if your boyfriend was passionate about his daughter he would spend more time with her. If he's not going to be there through the sleepless nights then he really does not have a say in whether your formula feed or breastfeed. <br>  <br>  Keep your head up, you are doing a great job.<br>  <br>  To Hannah's mommy: What you have seem to have forgot is that those people that are on WIC pay their taxes too. Stop being so selfish and get over yourself.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	It seems to me like you and your fiance have problems that run much deeper than breastfeeding or formula feeding.  That is why you are crying - your fiance is the problem, not whether you breastfeed.<br>  <br>  I breastfed and believe me it is the best thing.  But I cant stand when people tell other people what to do.  It is your life!  I nursed and no one gave me a problem.  My sister didnt and no one gave her a problem.  <br>  <br>  Here is my suggestion:  Let him come to the next doctors visit.  Let him tell the doctor that you do not breastfeed and use *gasp* formula.  While the AAP recommends breastfeeding, every single doctor I have ever talked to supports formula feeding as well and understands that mothers who work/attend school might need to supplement with formula.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|z6IekuwSaa	First off you are being a good mommy! And even though he shouldn't treat you that way, the upside he that he is so caring for his daughter. Don't feel bad about not breastfeeding as long as she is healthy and happy that's all that matters.<br>  I do want you to know though that you can overcome flat nipples with a nipple shield. It is also not too late because you can always re-lactate. And also I've heard that WIC will provide a breast pump for you. I'm not judging your decision, I just don't want you to feel like that option is gone either. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Ms Holli- I respectfully disagree with your statement that men don't have a say. I think they should have a say, just not the deciding factor. We women should give our guys a little credit and listen to what they have to say and take it into consideration at least.<br>  <br>  Hannah's mommy- I'm going to just throw a random guess out there. 7 thumbs down...hmmm...maybe 7 angry WIC users. <br>  You have every right to be frustrated that your forced charity is treated in such a nonchalant (sp?) manner!<br>  <br>  Ok everyone is bashing the man here. Since you are going to college fulltime (which is very good! I think everyone should get their degree) I'm guessing he has a fulltime job so only stays on the weekend. Otherwise how are you taking care of her.<br>  <br>  Lol, I get thumbs up until I defend a man and don't like WIC. lol|`|SJTkW5VNaa	I don't think he should have yelled at you.  Yelling doesn't solve anything and if you want a breast pump, they are very expensive.  That would be your best bet though.  Also, you can tell him that if he wants to breast feed her that bad then he can go buy the pump.  In time he will change the diapers though.  Give it time.
XhIYAH6Laa	Yes babies r us has them and so does Motherhood if you have that clothing store around you.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	BRU and Walmart have them. But I've heard bad things about them - namely that they don't work. And if you can't find a heartbeat or confuse it with your own, it can be very frustrating and scary. I personally wouldn't use them - but I think at around 20 weeks you can get a better idea just by using a regular stethoscope.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I don't know of any retail stores that has them out for people to use. You can buy them, but honestly the retail ones are crappy and most women have no luck finding the heart beat until the very end of pregnancy, if at all. <br>  <br>  In fact, I think these devices make women more paranoid, because lay-persons do not know the tricks of the trade to locate the fetal heart beat, and when they don't find it they freak out thinking something is wrong. Or they catch their own heart beat and think the baby's heart beat is too low, etc. <br>  <br>  Save your money. In a few weeks you'll be feeling your baby moving on a daily basis and that will be all the reassurance you will need.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I know a few people that tried the ones from walmart but it didn't really work until the very end.  I can hear my baby's heartbeat with just a plain stethescope and I am 29 weeks.  You can also rent one for about $20 a month at storkradio.com which is what I did for my first pregnancy and it worked great.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I bought one at BabiesRUs|`|6L4fCcyGaa	I saw them at rite aids|`|laRjvObCaa	I bought one at Wal*Mart during my first pregnancy (within 3 years).  It worked well.  But as soon as I started feeling my baby move, around 20-22 weeks, I stopped using the monitor because I was able to interact with my daughter.  The "aww" of listening to her heartbeat wasn't quite as grand as the "aww" of feeling her alive inside of me.|`|6C4ibyF8aa	if you buy one at a department store, you will probably only get results if your 21 weeks-.
s8VgyzE2aa	I know most airlines start allowing it at age 6 with a flight attendant chaperone. It costs extra money and someone on the other end has to be picking up the child and have ID ready. <br>  <br>  My niece used to fly alone since she was 7 and now she is 18. She always did fine. personally though, I would not be comfortable with it at that young of an age. I am just now starting to feel as if I might be able to allow my oldest to fly alone to visit my mom in Califormia and they are 14 years old (twins) and would have each other LOL One reason is because we are in Connecticut there is always a layover somewhere and I would only want them to fly on a direct flight which is hard to get from CT to CA.<br>  <br>  I don't think badly of parents who allow it at younger ages, it's their choice, I am just too protective to handle it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: the person who said they did it at 4 is mistaken, the youngest I have heard an airline allowing is age 5.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We let our stepson fly alone at age 6 and it turned out very well. I think airlines will start escorting kids at age 5, so anytime after that is appropriate if the child is mature enough to handle it.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I know a lot of people who have sent their kids as early as 6. I personal wouldn't do it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I don't know that I would ever let a child fly alone. Times have changed drastically in our world. My husband flew alone (transatlantic!) at age 10 for the first time - that was like 25 years ago - and I suppose between 10-12 years old, I would consider it. It depends on the child and how 'self aware' they are. <br>  <br>  However, considering I live about 30 minutes from where that jet plane went down in New York State not that long ago, I'd probably have second thoughts about letting them fly alone, period. You just never know. I know the chances are rare, etc. etc. but when it happens close to home you can't help but think about it. I would never forgive myself if something like that happened. <br>  <br>  What do you mean by 'very experienced at traveling'? That almost implies that they've flown alone before. What kind of experience?|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	I think you can pay the airline extra to have the stewardess watch them or someone meet them at the plane. This day and age I wouldn't trust any child under 12 (even then) to go alone.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	9+ provided theirs someone trusted waiting for them when they arrive.|`|IEbAHp0gaa	I myself would not feel comfortable letting my kid fly if he/she was under 8.<br>  <br>  Aged 8 and above I would be fine, they are a little more mature and the air hostess would be able to take care of them.<br>  <br>  But saying that, it all depends on the individual child, some are mature at 6/7 whilst others are at that same level of maturity by the age of 10/11.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I did it when I was 4, it's very safe as long as you give the flight attendants a heads up that the child is alone and have someone at the gate to meet them.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	I would never let my child go on his/her own until 13 because that's when you become a teenager and I would make sure they had full battery on their phone and credit so I could contact them and they could contact me.|`|mLuz6QzGaa	i was 8 and i was fine i actually liked flying by myself!|`|ehrzYOPHaa	I did it when i was like 8, but i had the airport people take me to m flights... i recommend that (its only like 50$ extra)|`|And9dyrwaa	17 years must be completed.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	21|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i would NEVER let my child fly alone until they were at LEAST 12.
s8VgyzE2aa	I would be very nervous about it but at that age and with what you describe I would allow it. My oldest are 14 (twins) and my mom who lives a 7 hour flight away would love for them to do the same but I have yet to allow it because there is almost always a layover and I am worried enough about a Direct flight, nevermind changing planes and waiting at some airport alone. <br>  <br>  My twins are not even comfortable with the idea yet so that makes me feel better about my decision not to allow it but my mom thinks they would be fine.|`|Hhifw93laa	Your a mom your supposed to be nerves if you wernt I would be asking questions. I think that is awesome that she wants to go see her grandparents. Its a way for her to show you that she is growing up. I would let her go. Make a note on the ticket for the tendings on the plain that she sits with another woman so she don't feel weird or that she don't have some old man fall asleep on her lol it happens I would let my 15 year old fly by him self I would hes only 6 now but very responsible now I can only imagine how God will make him when he becomes 15 <br>  <br>  I hope this helps <br>  <br>  God Bless|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I would be a nervous wreck but if she's being dropped off and picked up she should be ok.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if i is a point a to point b flight with no stops in the middle i don't see he problem. you will be at one end and the grandparents at another so she will have someone there at all times except on the plane. and if you are worried when you take her to the air port  you can talk to one of the girls at the counter and let them know you are worried about your daughter flying alone and maybe a flight attendant could just keep an eye out.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	If it's a direct flight, then she should definitely be ok.  I flew by myself (on a direct flight) when I was 13.  Usually if a minor is flying by themselves they are accommodated very well.  When I flew the flight attendant was always asking me how I was doing and when we landed a guy took me right to where my parents were waiting so I didn't get lost.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	yes. i flew alone to russia when i was 12 and to NY from FL. they monitor them on the plane and if you want they accompany them to meet whoever is meeting them at the airport.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would say to let her fly on her own but what you could do is to tell the Airline she is flying with and they will have a stewardess check on her during the flight, and will walk with her to her connection if she has one and will make sure she is getting where she is going.  You just need to tell the airline that this is her first time flying on her own and they will watch over her.  I understand why you are overprotective, and this is one way you can be certain you have done all you can with her flying on her own.|`|mw7UGMGjaa	The first time I flew alone, I was 13.  My parents were nervous too.  I even had a layover!  The flight attendants were with me all the way.  I remember an attendant walking me off the plane, another one walking me to the next gate, and everything.  They let the kids board first.  All airlines are very accommodating and understanding.  Hope this eases your nerves a little bit.  She will be just fine.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	totally fine. I flew alone at nine to visit relatives (it was only 2 hours.) when I was 13 I flew alone to D.C. (from west coast) and when I was 14 I flew to NY. Its absolutly safe, don't worry. :)|`|sesC2speaa	yes let her do it when i was 15 i use to fly from england to canada on my own it will make her more indipendant and respective hope this helps you!!|`|6mOOskuBaa	Given the conditions you mention, let her go.

ay8tXLD2aa	That sounds really crappy.  How horrible that they judge you, especially when you have been friends for so long. <br>  <br>  Easier said than done, but I would spell it out to them bluntly.  Tell them how much you enjoy what you do and love spending time with your child. If they still don't get it, tell them that it really bothers you how they put you down. Or ask them why they think you are "less" than they are because of your job or your income. If you have been friends for so long, then hopefully they will realise how much they are hurting you and want to change. Sometimes with people we are so close with we forget that we can't say "just anything" to them - as in, maybe they think that you are close enough to them that they can tease about this and you won't take it in a way they don't mean it....so possibly they don't mean it that way, you know? <br>  <br>  That said, if it's still not getting you anywhere, the next weekly lunch date that comes around, I would let them know you're not coming because of the way they make you feel. <br>  <br>  And enjoy your time with your child - nothing beats being at home with mom!|`|cYgJQDQSaa	Good for you! <br>  The fact you actually seem to love your children and are prepared to sacrifice for them is an indicator of how much better a person you are. Just sit there and smile safe in the knowledge of that, don't lower yourself to sniping at them.|`|3lqjbusaaa	just say hey at least i get to spend time with my kid. unlike all of you. i actually will get to see my kid grow up.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	usually people who are this way are ignorant. These people are ignorant because they do not know what it is like to struggle. that is why it is so easy to put people down. they dont think about what they are saying , they have learned that money rules and having a heart doesnt. i wouldnt say anything about cleaning houses. its none of their business anyway. you are the one who shines more because you probably spend more time with your children. usually over time as they get older they will realize this.As for you , you are doing the right thing, as for them they need to educate themselves on life.|`|kgLBPkPCaa	Maybe your friends think that b/c you have been friends for so long that they feel they can be candid with you about their "thoughts" and do not realise how unsupportive and condescending they are coming off.  Perhaps if you told them how your feelings were being hurt and how judgemental you felt they were being in regards to your job and child care situation, they would take a look at their behavior.  The proof would be in their reaction to that, I'd think. A real friend will stop saying the things that are potentially harmful to the other's self worth.  If not, then feel totally justified in seeking out other friends and tell them where to stick it.|`|5lfW4v45aa	your friends are jerks.   srry but people don't change just like that.  even if they stop making fun of you they're still gonna feel that way about you and everyone else "beneath" them.  get new friends|`|7SKVCPcSaa	when they make a snotty remark like that, just throw something back like "at least my children know who i am and willingly love me instead of being told they have to love me!"<br>  <br>  because if those people have such bad as* jobs and have kids, you know they aren't spending enough time with them. so just make it known that you dont' care if you're cleaning houses for EXTRA money, at least your babies know you're mommy! and tell them that just because you clean houses and raise your children doesn't make them any better than you. in all actuality it makes you a damn better parent then any of them.. because like i've said several times YOUR CHILDREN KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
CdJtH0xdaa	Of course it's normal. Pubescent teenagers are not supposed to know who they are yet; you are still finding out who you are, which is a part of being a teenager. Good luck to you!|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  Please don't worry about it. It is perfectly normal for both girls and guys, during puberty, to consider what it is like to be in a relationship with another guy or girl. I once read that over 90% of teenagers have been confused about their sexuality.<br>  <br>  Basically, you are still growing up and you havn't fully developed mentally yet (as well as physically). You will probably have loads of mixed feelings about girls and guys but your thoughts will soon settle themselves out! Also, as you said you've liked girls all your life, i doubt you are gay. If you are though, there's nothing to be worried or ashamed about.<br>  <br>  Please don't let this bother you! What will be, will be...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps -x-x-|`|dVe3tqddaa	Absolutely. Your still growing, so your body is starting to create new attractions to people and you discover who is your "type". Its perfectly normal. I went through the same thing when i was 12ish. By the time i was in high school though i had everything figured out, so if your like 15 or 16 and thinking you may be attracted to guys you might want to consider the possibility your gay or bi, but if your younger then its perfectly normal. Hope this helps:-)|`|orGvWwhBaa	Maybe you are asexual? It seems a little early to tell. No offense, but you seem slightly 'young' for your age, if you understand. Time will tell how you really feel and what you really want. Don't go rushing into anything just because everyone else is doing it. Take your time.<br>  <br>  And also, if you are having gay tendancies, it may just be a phase. Only time will tell.
3v9rL5xLaa	Legally it is the other mans child. Your brother would have to have a DNA test to establish his paternity.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Your brother should get a paternity test done to make sure its his.  If it is, he can petition the courts for his name to be put on the birth certificate and for visitation rights.  He will be responsible for child support as well.|`|AA11537580	who ever the biological parent is, is responsible unless the "boyfriend" has legally adopted the child.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	that is very interesting. No matter what we say here of course your brother has to get a lawyer to help him sort the mess out. <br>  <br>  He probably has the right to change the birth certificate legally. this seems to be the big problem for him. <br>  <br>  If they have done a paternity test which I believe they have due to what you say about his confidence that the child is his, then obviously the guy who signed the birth certificate was either mistaken or deceived.<br>  <br>  Aren't people so bad to themselves their children and to others?|`|LVTN2Y6Saa	She can get in trouble for having that other guy sign knowing it is your brothers. He isn't on the birth certificate so legally he doesn't have to pay. The other guy is responsible. The court isn't going to make him pay until a paternity test is done. She is retarded. The stupid a#$ girl sounds like a freak-show. She needs to grow up and stop playing little kid games. Who names someones baby after another guy has him sign the certificate and then tries to get money from the real dad after doing that s%$t. I would beat her *** if I was you or I would find someone to do it for me. O.K. I will shut up know, I know that karma will give her 10 times something worse and she is going to regret what she did.
ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	It sounds to me as if she is fine.  You say she looks at you but you don't say she's crying or upset so I guess maybe she's not hungry but just wants some attention from you.  Babies are very sociable and love you to bounce them gently on your knee and talk and laugh and have fun with them.  Both my sons used to love me to read to them (yes, even when they were very young) as they love to hear the soothing effect of your voice and to be cuddled up warm in your arms.  Maybe she just wants this.<br>  <br>  However, if she seems unwell, or distressed for no reason, then talk to your Doctor or Health Visitor.|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	My son does the same thing right now too. I read a lot about it. I read in a magazine that when they stare at you they are trying to communicate to you that they love you. Your daughter probably just found her hands and is putting them in her mouth, it could also be because of teething. As long as she still has wet and dirty diapers and isn't crying then this isn't due to hunger.|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	could she have a tooth coming in? I know she's too young, but not unheard of. <br>  <br>  Or maybe some other soreness in her mouth? Is she thirsty?   <br>  <br>  If she isn't distressed and is eating, sleeping etc normally I wouldn't worry too much|`|z6IekuwSaa	I think that she's just discovering her hands.|`|foJm2Yftaa	Ask the Docter? %Lol%|`|A9MDoFooaa	she is fine - do NOT give her any food or baby rice before 17 weeks as her intestine is not fully developed and it can cause problems with food intolerances as well as other things - unless guided by a doctor to do so on medical grounds.<br>  she has found her little hands, that's all and the best thing to do with new stuff when you are a baby is to stuff it into your mouth to see how it feels :-)<br>  also her teeth will be moving about in her gums getting ready to come through - so it may be bothering her - just keep up with the breast feeding - well done for getting so far already :-)<br>  <br>  trust your instincts - the doctor is there as a specialist in illness and disease - you are her mummy and will know what she needs - believe in yourself. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|sPWzvWehaa	I don't see any harm in letting her eat, but don't take my advice because I'm a bachelor.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	100% breastfed? Is she not on solids, at all? Not trying to sound rude, but it sounds like she's still hungry. You can breastfeed and do solids too. Maybe the breastmilk alone isn't filling her up. That's what it sounds like to me. Rice cereal doesn't have much nutritional value to it, so its personal preference if you want to do it or not, but I would seriously consider starting some solid foods, if you're not already started.
fHgbL046aa	Your baby moves all the time. You may not feel your baby until later on. With my first I was about 5 or 6  months before I felt her. I'm 22 weeks pregnant with my second and haven't felt anything. I have seen my baby moving around on the ultrasound, but I feel nothing. Its kind of a bummer because I wanna feel my baby. I was told It may be a few more weeks before I feel anything because my placenta is laying low.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	It's been moving for a long time now, but you just haven't felt it. If you're almost 4 months, you should be feeling it any day now.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	its starts moving right away..but if your asking when you will feel it move, if its your first you wont feel it till about 20 weeks or so.

9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	Today is Saturday.<br>  You've had braces for the first time, for...2-3 days.<br>  You will need a LOT of painkillers, and LOTS of mushy food.<br>  <br>  When I first got my braces, every morning I had to take a Tylenol painkiller (I think that was the one), which would make the incredibly pain turn into a dull pain, and then one sometime in the afternoon. I did this for about 2-3 weeks the first time. Every appointment, I had to take a painkiller, for about... the first 3-4 months of appointments, which then would cause me to go into massive pain for 2-3 weeks once more. After about half a year, the time the braces hurt for go down to about a week, and by around a year, the pain should go away within 2-3 days. It is a VERY painful process.<br>  <br>  All you should be eating is yoghurt, porridge, and uh.... jello? I seriously only ate porridge, corn meal, yoghurt, and drank for the first 3 weeks every appointment. <br>  I also hear something about baby food is ok, but take that with caution... Who knows what's in that mush.<br>  <br>  All in all, braces are an incredible pain, you will look bad and feel bad for like, a year. But when you get used to it, and you keep in mind how much better you will look in the future, it actually makes it worthwhile. Especially when I see some people smile. I just think that they should get braces no matter what. That's always an upside too :)<br>  It's a privelage that you get braces ;o<br>  <br>  Good luck fellow brace-person. As someone who had braces twice, and now feels somewhat like a God, it'll work out in the end :)|`|qq8RnW3yaa	I understand your pain completely! When my teeth hurt from my braces I usually try and eat ice cream, soups, and other soft foods. I have found noodles are particularly good, they are like real food but don't hurt. lol. Cold drinks really help. I have never tried it but I heard freezing a banana may help. Sleep is the best way to avoid the pain. I know the Ibuprofen isn't helping so maybe if you have any other painkillers that would help. If not just keep taking them. If you can convince your mom to go out they have some gel stuff I got that helps numb your mouth. Look around the dental stuff and you should find it. Popsicles are good too. Just hang in there and they will feel better soon. I promise.|`|WSwkPljYaa	I got braces in Kindergarten, yes they aren't any fun at all! <br>  <br>  For the pain try Baby Origel. It's medicine used to help soothe teething babies teeth. You can get it at the grocery store in the baby isle I believe. It works great and it's instant, you just rub it on your teeth and they're numb! It doesn't last too long though, so you have to apply it a few times a day, but I highly recommend it. <br>  <br>  As for food, maybe you can dig in the pantry and find some soup? Or soft foods like bread? <br>  <br>  The pain should be gone by tomorrow or Monday at the latest.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <3|`|2diobki7aa	They really hurt, I know. I never had braces, but some of my friends have, and they hurt a lot after getting them on. It's only been a few days, so give it some time. Try painkiller pills like aspirin or Advil. If you're over 11 or 12, the Ibuprofen won't really work that well. Talk to your orthodontist if the pain keeps going for more than another few days. Oh, eat a ton of ice cream! It tastes good, helps the pain, and you CAN eat it! (: Good luck!|`|5eSx3voLaa	I've had my braces before,<br>  yes, i understand your pain...<br>  try porridge (soft foods)<br>  of dip biscuits into milk or hot coffee~<br>  and if you want to lose pain <br>  1.) drink cold drinks.(works temporarily for me)<br>  2.) do something to distract yourself from your braces...<br>  3.) and most importantly! DO NOT BUMP YOUR TEETH ACCIDENTALLY INTO ANYTHING!!<br>  cups, hands, doors etc etc <br>  <br>  that, will hurt A LOT<br>  just be careful...<br>  <br>  how long the pain will last depends on your age,<br>  the younger you are,(12-13 years)<br>  the faster the pain will end,<br>  the older you are...(16-20+++++++)<br>  the longer the pain...<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck with your braces <br>  you won't regret when you finally have a set of nice straight teeth!!<br>  thrust me... =)|`|r4AN8328aa	mhmm well ive been having braces for aboutt 7 monthss now.<br>  so i know whut you mean when they say they hurt.you should ask ur dentist forr sum medication.thats whut i did.<br>  and dont worryy they just hurt because your teeth arent use to the pressuree,the pain will stop like in about 3 more dayss|`|t0sDyzrdaa	ouch.. i just got my braces tightened afew weeks ago and they hurt really bad! it will probably last up 2 a week if not more. but every day, they will get alittle better. just keep taking ivprofin every 4-5 hours and should help. and if ur lips/gums/or like inside of your cheeks start hurting... put wax on the brackets and it will make it so they cant scratch up your skinn... it will get better, trust me!|`|77HV1jsJaa	the pain last a week or so. every time you get them tightened they will hurt but not as bad as they do when you first get them. just take ib/profen and try to sleep. nothin will work so i just slept as much as i could. eat soups also.|`|qH7IA1Staa	take pain killers<br>  and ask ur orthadontist if he/she can give u wax<br>  to put on ur braces so they don't cut ur gums. <br>  oh ya, eat lots of ice cream :)|`|yV8fog7Paa	when I first got braces it was about a week and a half before I can start eating harder foods. Mash up banana and "chew" it with the top of your gum, pudding, rice, ice cream, smoothies...things like that.<br>  Do not have ibuprofen or anything if you're allergic, duh. I am allergic to another kind of antiinflamatory so now I can not have ibuprofen because it's an antiinflamatory, my throat closed and such. Not fun.|`|A03NJA26aa	I was in pain for a whole day when I got mine and I couldn't eat much either. It's hard but it eventually went away. I put ice in a bag and put that on my teeth but then I had to hold it there constantly.They gave me wax but it slipped to much. The best you can do is try and eat liquid foods like soup until you feel that you can eat normal again and when they say not to chew gum, don't do it, my friend did and her braces stayed on longer than they should have and I got mine off before her cause I never chewed gum.|`|Qydtjz2naa	Braces are really painful at first, but I promise, it will get better.  Here's what I did to help.<br>  1. Take a painkiller<br>  2. Ask you dentist about wax.  It helps if a wire sticks out, but I'm guessing your pain is for the actual teeth being soar, so it wont help much with that problem.<br>  3. Eat ice cream!  It will make you feel better.  It might be hard to eat food, so ice cream is perfect. <br>  4. Do something that will distract you.  Go outside, hang out with a friend, watch a really good movie, etc.  If you focus on the pain, it will stay for much longer than it needs too. <br>  5. Punch a wall, that way, you will focus more on the pain in your hand than in your mouth.  Just kidding... kind of. <br>  <br>  I had braces for about a year and a half, and I had very little pain with them.  The first week hurts, and then the day after you have another appointment will hurt.  Other than that, there was no problem.  People on here are saying it hurt a lot, I didn't find that.  Braces are 110% worth the pain!  Once you get them off, you will be so happy!|`|gTXUcd1maa	Hi<br>  <br>    I got my braces on 9 months ago. It all pays off. My teeth are straight already. Take a a piece of ice and put it in your mouth, to kinda get it a little numb. also, tell your mom that they are hurting really bad and that you should maybe try advil if ibuprofen isn't working. The pain only lasted 8 days, and by the end of the 8 days the pain was dull. The first 2-4 days are the worst so hang on, soon your smile will be incredible!|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	I got my braces sept. 07 and still have them. Mine stopped hurting after a week or so. Don't eat solids just eat pudding ice cream etc. But evertime you go to the ortho and get them tightened or get a new wire(same thing) it will hurt for like four days but not as bad as now.<br>  Good luck!

58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	VERY normal. I just went through the same thing. If you go to a maternity clothing store, you can get fitted for a bra. They have some really comfy sports bras (a god-send) and some really nice, comfortable underwire bras. Right now, you need to have plenty of support. I know that wearing a bra is the LAST thing you want but believe me, it will really help the nipple pain. Avoid anything with seams that cross over your nipple.  Also, Target sells an ointment for breastfeeding mothers. Its a lanolin ointment. It hurts a little when you a apply it but it REALLY helped my sore nipples. In the mean time, if you are chilly or leaving the house, bring a sweater or zip-up hoodie to avoid hard nipples. Good luck and congrats!! p.s. throughout your pregnancy, make sure to get re-fitted every 3 or 4 months. As your breasts grow, you will need a proper fitting bra for good support. Good luck!!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Its completely normal and should go away in a few weeks. The first trimester of pregnancy is so weird. Morning sickness, constipation and extremely sensitive nipples. I remember how sore my nipples were that I rarely wore a bra, unless I absolutely had to because the pain was unbelievable. But yes... this is completely normal.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	It's normal and can happen at any point in pregnancy. It happened to me last week once in 25 weeks. Lotion helps along with wearing light clothes that don't rub.|`|RrUticQ4aa	wohhooooooahhh lamo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  <br>  ull live|`|jracq6Lraa	what about your jockstrap
r7q8LW7Aaa	That's kind of considered to be the usual thing to do - then people actually know what to get you and nothing is doubled up. Instead of that, we asked for Going Places vouchers for our honeymoon, and had a fab time in the Maldives!|`|laRjvObCaa	To flat out write a list is rude to me.  But it wouldn't be considered rude to register for a bridal registry.  Then, you guys can let your guests know where you registered.  Most people will buy from your registry so that they can get you something you want.  You'll still have some that get you something off the wall.  But it's a polite way to point people to what you want without seeming selfish or bossy.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Most people nowadays have a bridal registry anyway, or you could do one for your honeymoon, and people pay off your honeymoon, especially good if you already have alot of house hold items, for our wedding we just had a treasure chest and people put money into it. We just had a little poem in the invite, I dont think its rude at all, it would be worse if you got heaps of presents you never used because it wasnt want you needed or wanted.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	at least if your write a gift registry you wont end up with 7 toasters - which is pretty silly ...well me and my partner have lived together for years so we dont need any gifts for the house as we have more than enough of household items and such so my parents were saying ask for money for the honeymoon spending money - i tohught it was v rude but apparantly quite a few couples do this now..|`|mhfgvvrJaa	Yes I think it is rude to expect anything. <br>  <br>  Also you may want to post in an appropriate section. You may get more appropriate responses from people who have experienced it. <br>  <br>  If the question is about weddings then try that section, however if it is about weeding, try the gardening section.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	That does seem rude, but wedding registries are well accepted.|`|955YoHvVaa	When my husband and I were getting married we did a bridal registry and still ended up with 3 blenders.

If you do it tactfully, like you said a registry.  It is not like you're sending out a list "hey we need a roasting pan, a good carving knife . . ." in your wedding invitation<br>  <br>  People are not going to buy specifically what is on your registry but it sure is a good way to direct them toward what you would like.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I think it's time for a gift registry!! You list what you need/want, without having to say anything to anybody, and it gives people a general idea of what to get you.|`|CFiNniZbaa	Well maybe if you send it with the invites, but most couples just choose a store like bloomingdales or something and set up a bridal registry.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Well didn't you register for your baby shower?  I felt really uncomfortable with registering for my baby shower.  It was like I was telling people what to get me.  It just felt weird!  But I know I hate buying something for someone that they wont use.  Then I feel bad, and as it was wasted money.  This just makes it easier on the people buying.  There are usually a lot of people at a wedding, making a lot of chances for the same thing.  So no, it's not rude.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Writing a list? Or do you mean a registry? I think a registry is completely normal. =) It's fun doing the registry too. =)|`|t1fx6kXcaa	A lot of people make a registry or ask for money instead of gifts.<br>  I'm going to offend those who do this but it is tacky and it is not proper etiquette. Telling someone what to buy you is rude. Telling someone that you expect a a gift (which you are doing by including  a registry) is rude.<br>  I agree with you and I think it is rude. A gift should be appreciated not expected.<br>  "Follow-up question:<br>  I am wondering if it is "proper" to place registry cards in the wedding invitations or just the shower invitations.   Thank you so much for your time.  Kathy<br>  <br>  Hi Kathy,<br>  Proper etiquette would prohibit placing registry cards in the invitation.  This is an etiquette practice that has greatly eroded over the last decade.  However, if you are going by the book, the best way to let people know where you are registered is through word of mouth"<br>  <a href="http://ourmarriage.com/html/asking_for_money.html" rel="nofollow">http://ourmarriage.com/html/asking_for_m...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on your wedding.<br>  "|`|nmu6coapaa	Hey hun! I'm from Ireland too and I think here it would be rude but it it's the norm in America! I'm not having a go at the States, just pointing out that we do things different here! I got invited to a wedding with a list of suggestions on what to buy and I thought it rude!|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	In my area, many stores have a bridal registry where you select the things you'd like to receive as gifts.  Then when people go shopping for a gift they ask the store, not you, what you would like.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i would feel weird. but  i wouldn't do it. but it isn't rude. at least you aren't getting something you have to return and don't like  :)
6nn7f41Faa	It does get easier. My kids are 20 months apart. Any time my son (now 3 months) slept, would be my time with my daughter. I would even lay with her on the couch and just watch a movie with her until she fell asleep if it was naptime. Another thing I did was pump. I would pump out milk and let her sit next to me and feed the baby. She felt very important to be included. Now she'll hand me diapers when I'm changing him, and wipes too. She'll take the dirty diapers to the garbage and always wants to feed my son. She gives him his suckey if he cries, hugs him, kisses him. She acts like a little Mommy with him. It is truly adorable.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My 2 youngest boys are now 16 months and 5 months and I am 13 weeks pregnant again, So I completely know where you are coming from.<br>  I still feel like I am not giving them both enough attention all the time, but slowly you will come to accept that you just have to deal with whoevers needs are more important at the moment. I bottle fed all my kids but with the 2 youngest I always let my then 11 month old sit in my lap while I fed his newborn brother. Or I would do so in the bed where there was more room for everyone to spread out.<br>  All I can really tell you is that in some ways it will get easier and in other ways it becomes harder. My 5 month old can now sit in his jumperoo or swing while I play with my 16 month old and they have both become very good at entertaining themselves and each other. It is so cute when my 16 month old holds his brothers hand while he eats his bottle now and always wants to give him hugs and sloppy kisses. As they do get older my main concern is the safety of the baby. My 16 month old loves to play rough with his older siblings and has a hard time understanding why he can't sit on his brother or drag him around the house. Needless to say I don't let this happen but he sure trys like hell any time I turn my back..lol. And now I am dealing with my 16 month old trying to feed his little brother whatever he is eating at the time..not good! Best of luck and feel free to message me if you want.|`|955YoHvVaa	Maybe invite a family member or a friend over a couple times a week for say an hour to watch the newborn so you can spend that hour just intereacting with the older child..before I had my daughter my sister had 3 kids under age 3 and I would go there a couple times a week and entertain the younger two so she could spend time with the older one alone..now they moved away so I don't get to do that anymore but she said it really helped and you could see it in the older child how much it meant to her.
B5MDTdtPaa	actually hard surfaces/matresses are supposed to be good for a bad back!
er7NYdRdaa	I changed my son's nipples at about 4 months. I started noticing he kinda squirmed and could tell he wanted the milk to come out faster. It took only a few days for him to get used to the new faster flowing nipple. He was much happier.|`|p1Jz4BV5aa	My daughter didn't change to stage 2 flow until she was 6 months old.|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	I noticed I had to change the flow of the nipple when my son was trying really hard to get the milk out faster. I changed it and he finally relaxed when drinking a bottle.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would be thrilled if I was you because the lower he is the better for you and delivery.|`|Ql09WZa8aa	It is an excellent thing this means <br>  a) your cervix is very soft and thin you can feel the hair<br>  b) the baby is at position -1 or -2 whihc is excellent for birth...<br>  <br>  You are too close... So lucky.. am still in the 9th week !!! :) ))) <br>  Good Luck|`|foJm2Yftaa	How long have you been pregnant? If you've been pregnant for 9 months its ok, but if you've been pregnant less than 9 months its not ok. For now I do not know what to do! Also you're baby is gonna come out! Congratz!|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	sounds like he's getting ready to make his debut. The lower he is, the sooner you should have him. Good luck!|`|zNSDHpV6aa	yes that normal that baby is really to come out|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	That's a fantastic thing.  That means he's saying, "Mom, I'm coming to see you soon!"  He's definitely on his way and he will not just pop out.  Trust me!  Haha.<br>  <br>  I remember feeling the same way when I was that far along.  My son would also tickle me with his fingers down there.  That was a VERY weird sensation.  Definitely!!!!   I was always worried I'd feel his hand pop out or something.  =)  Congratulations!|`|0TW0zoZUaa	You actually might be dilated if the baby is that low...I would call your dr so someone can check you.  The baby being low is really good though for delivery but I would still go in for a look!  Good luck
AjqO1aJgaa	No, she wouldn't be safe. How would having a five point harness in another car help her if she had an accident while in your mother's? And four hours a week is a significant timeperiod.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would see if you can teach your daughter to fasten her own buckle. I know a little girl who was looked after by her disabled granddad during the day, and she was doing up her own five point seatbelt (encouraged and helped by him, he just didn't have the mobility in his hands to do it himself) from two and a half, when she started playgroup.
zhJOZhKEaa	Yes, the booster seats say 30-100 pounds... but a lot of them say they can be used when the child is as young as *one year* old as well.  The safety experts say wait until *at least* 4 yrs *and* 40 pounds.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/BoosterShop.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/Booster...</a><br>  <br>  "Many booster seats have a minimum weight of 30-33 lbs. However, a booster seat should not be the next purchase when the child outgrows a convertible seat. A child is safest if they remain in a harnessed seat until they reach at least 40 lbs. A combination seat should be used after the child has grown too tall for a forward-facing convertible, but is not yet heavy enough (40 lbs) to move into a booster."<br>  <br>  "It is also important to take the temperament and maturity level of your child into consideration.  To sit in a booster seat, the child must be capable of sitting up without slouching or leaning over, keeping the belts in place, and staying buckled.  If your child is unable to do so (whether because of age, maturity or personality), a higher weight restraint should be considered as the next step."<br>  <br>  If your mom can't or *won't* buckle the child properly... I wouldn't let her drive her anywhere.  She's left her *unbuckled* before... that is scary.  I would sit her down for long talk and make it clear that she *has* to use the seat you provide as it is intended or you will not be able to let your daughter ride in her vehicle.<br>  <br>  I'd take your mom shopping with you so you could let her try out the buckles and find one she could use more easily.  Perhaps something like this: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?povid=cat91365-env198849-module202209-rLink1&product_id=8112222" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> Which is designed to harness longer will be easier for her to get a nice snug fit.<br>  <br>  It is just *way* too soon for a booster seat.  In all honesty... my own children were still *rearfacing* in carseats like you have now at 31 pounds.  Every step 'up' in carseats is a step down in safety.  Don't take those steps lightly!|`|AA11220327	where i live, children are not legally to be switched from a carseat to a booster untill 4 years old, or 40 lbs, whichever comes 1st. I know that here in my area, if someone were to get pulled over with a child in the wrong age/weight seat, they get a major fine, and sometimes worse repercussions than that. It is deffinitly best to keep her in the proper seat untill she reaches the age/weight requirement. it is for her safety|`|Bjad8v8Maa	I would not recommend the booster seat.  The weight limits/age limits are there for a reason.  I would suggest having a neighbor help your mom with the 5 point harness buckling if your mom is having a difficult time with it.  You would feel really bad if something happened, which it could regardless of the small amount of hours spent in her car, and the injury could have been prevented by the correct seat.  The 5 point harness is important to prevent injuries like whiplash and other head/neck injuries in small children.|`|85d880b4c510002b409163300b68601eaa	My daughter is about the same size as your daughter, only she wil be four in a couple weeks. She is still in her convertible car seat. I would never dream of putting her in a booster seat at this size. How necessary is it that your mom drives her around. You could also go into the store and look at more five point harness options with you mom and see if she could buckle some of them easier than others.<br>  My SIL actually was foolish enough to purchase a car seat for her daughter that she couldn't buckle due to a disability. There were plenty on the market that she could fasten.|`|nDEVWjCEaa	No i dont think it is safe... the restrictions are there for a reason... like the others said   ask a neighbour to help your mother if need be... your mother andyou will feel horrible if something happend...  oh and it is against the law... specially if your daughter is only 26 inches tall... my daughter was 22.5 inches when she was born.. and is now 35 inches and she is two. and weights 30lbs   i soo wouldn't do it
CxCigxZIaa	I would urge her to buy clothes that the LENGTH (like jeans/pant) won't matter. I can recall my daughter at 13 and she had 'already' had her growth spurt. Soooooooooo...has your sister had one? (growth spurt) like did she grow taller one summer like it seemed overnight? I don't see anything wrong with buying things ahead of time, like dresses, shirts, shorts, however when it comes to jeans, she might get the right length and I would hold off of that item for sure. (and shoes) <br>  G'luck|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Everyone is different, even twins.|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I did a study on height so I hope I can help.<br>  The problem with age 13 is that everyone grows at different times. Some people have nearly finished growing, but some have hardly started yet.<br>  If she has had her period for more than two years that suggests she will not grow much more. If she has had her period for less than two years she has a chance of a lot more growth.<br>  Another thing to look at is her parents. If they are tall, then she is likely to be tall. But if they are short then she is likely to be short too.<br>  I have loads more info on height issues, how to deal with height problems, what clothes suit shorter people, even how to make yourself look taller! If any of that would be useful just contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|NOYvRabiaa	my friend has been 4'11 all through middle school. when we were freshmans..she finally turned 5 feet.<br>  <br>  but your sister might have a huge growth spurt during the summer..so there isn't really an accurate answer. but i think the highest she may get is 5'2|`|MtzJYAOsaa	It depends on who you are. There is no average 13 year old - everyone's different.|`|Az4uH0H2aa	idkk
oqUlYXqtaa	i think you should get it at the expected time but takl to your doctor to be sure.<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free and find others who have taken the hcg shot, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|GWveqx61aa	id think you would get it at expected time, but you should ask your doctor to be sure?~☆good luck☆~?
SxPhldhhaa	I'd say that she's more intelligent and more mature than her peers, but I'd need to know a lot more about her to call her a genius. In fact, she reminds me of myself so much that it's a little scary.<br>  <br>  I typed at 110 words per minute with 95% accuracy - I could also do 95 words per minute with 100% accuracy with even greater ease - when I was 10 and also had a laptop at that age. I learned to type without looking at the keyboard when I was 6 (my dad taught me - I hated his typing lessons back then, but now I appreciate them so much). In fact, whenever we were typing in class, I'd just be typing away and within minutes the rest of the class would be watching me type, usually without me knowing it. I was also very good with computers in general. I had a greater-than-average knowledge of C#, and now at age 13 I still enjoy computer programming and game design. I had an e-mail address at that age as well, and was always typing up my little stories on my computer. <br>  <br>  I always played pretend-school as well, and like her, I played seriously. I had my own little dry erase board, I'd teach the concepts I'd learned in school that day, and made rubrics for the class to use and graded pretend papers. I also enjoyed dancing, although I never signed up for lessons. And finally, I was definitely obsessed with names and big families! Even though I planned never to have kids in my life (not that I didn't want them; but having kids can be "selfish" in the sense of further ruining the environment) and was an only child, I'd make up these pretend families of about 10 or 12 kids. I was too obsessed with naming, and even now I'm always on the Baby Names section on Y!A.<br>  <br>  In fact, the only thing I can think of that was different about me was that I was probably the most arrogant, self-centered, and vain person in my school. I thought I was just about the coolest person ever - and sadly enough, I still do. But hey, at least I can admit it. (:<br>  <br>  Basically, I'd need to know more about her to declare her a genius (such as her grades in school, any special achievements, etc.) but from what it sounds like she does seem very intelligent and mature.|`|foJm2Yftaa	She is a genious! Its really normal, but it seems shes addicted to the laptop. Tell her she can only have it for like 2 or 3 hours. When I was 8 I got a laptop and used it for 48 hours and I had to wea glasses back then, but when I was 10 I didn't have to use them anymore. :P &Lol&|`|tBtOTiQDaa	well, considering that you can't spell "genius", i very much doubt you are one.<br>  The interwebz isn't for little children, now get off it, before i report you for violation of COPPA|`|AA11193773	So she can type fast. Lets say there is someone who writes cursive really well and she can't, would you still call her a Genius? People are smart in dfferent things. She might be a good typer, but can she do arithmatics as well?|`|u6IY90Jbaa	for the typing thing- normal not super smart<br>  has a laptop- spoiled<br>  dances- wayyy normal<br>  plays school- normal<br>  fake dance recitals- normal<br>  fake families- creepy|`|10b1R3ibaa	I don't think it's genius.<br>  She sounds bright, and probably just likes complicated games to keep her busy.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Normal? She's intelligent but not genius.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	She is very intellgent and she wiuld be in a smart class if her IQ is not 120 at her age she is not genuis|`|kkKfGROPaa	I think it is perfectly normal... a wave of nostalgia struck me as i recall my childhood days... i think i was worse off than her.. i could spend at least 7 hours on the computer per day.. and till now, as a teen, i still spend about 3-4 hours on the computer and 2-3 hours dancing.|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	well, she is super smart, from what i read. she seems very intelligent, but nothing out of the ordinary. <br>  she is a very talented 10 yr old girl.|`|QP6viNZ1aa	It sounds perfectly normal to me.  She's probably  smarter than other kids her age, but it isn't anything drastically odd.|`|pZhqW7k7aa	well the typing thing is probably an over-obsession over the computer|`|C8MN9lklaa	yeah im 10 i play teacher too|`|Vc6eNci9aa	She sounds like my 11 year old daughter Quin... amazing I know! Here is her imaginary family:<br>  Mother: Olivia Tierra Como<br>  Father: Elijah Allen Como<br>  7 yr. old daughter: Elle Dana Como<br>  8 yr. old son: Quentin Dick Como<br>  9 yr. old son: Murphy Elijah Como<br>  Great Dane: Ringo  <br>  Tibetan Terrier: Holly<br>  Persian: Nightmare<br>  So I'm planning to take her to that big store in France for her birthday where they sell actual sized stuffed people of all ages and animals... it will be so cool! She only knows what Quentin looks like. He has short, light brown hair and he is really short for a seven year old.|`|laRjvObCaa	I wouldn't call her genius but I would call her advanced.  It actually reminds me of myself. To a HUGE degree.<br>  <br>  Everyone made fun of me when I was younger because when I got bored, I'd find textbooks or workbooks from school and do homework that we weren't assigned.  I liked making up my own "lesson" plans and trying to teach myself new things.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she's been on a computer her whole life.  The fast typing is likely because she enjoys being on the computer, so she picked it up very well.  I loved to write stories starting around age 8-10, so I picked up typing quickly.  Again - sounds like hers is from about the same reasoning.  I am 24 now with a typing WPM of 95-105.  When I took my high school typing class, my teacher told me I typed better than she did.  They'd actually let kids get up and come and watch me type because everyone was so amazed at how fast I'd go.  Her typing skills will be very beneficial when she reaches the working world.<br>  <br>  As for adult reading, that's a sign that she has an above age level vocabulary.  Again, a very good thing.  I too have always loved reading, and as an adult, go through about a book or more a week.  So it's FABULOUS that she's picking that up early.  It'll stay with her.  <br>  <br>  Certain people have a certain type of intellect.  I don't know how to label it, but your daughter thinks like me.  She has a learning driven mind and seems to love creativity, though not quite the normal spatial artistic way.  She has a word-related creativity.  This is going to help her out SOOO well.  I have always picked up new information fast.  I'm not the most intelligent person in the world, but I'm definitely not stupid.  But the kind of brain that I do have (and that it seems your daughter does) is very good for test taking and absorbing information in a school like setting.  <br>  <br>  Sorry that I kept talking so much about myself in this... but your story just really reminded me of myself at her age.  <br>  <br>  Continue to nurture her creativity by letting her read books left and right.  Maybe get her a scrapbooking kit or something like that for a birthday/christmas.  You may find she has a skill for that or something else artistic.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	She made up fifteen kids names and can type? And? Every child in my nine year old son's class can do that.<br>  <br>  You haven't mentioned a single thing which has anything whatsoever to do with intelligence. She can buy all the books she likes. Has she read them? Did she understand them? Or is she just obsessed with stupidly large families, which to be honest is the only thing I'm seeing here.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I wouldnt call it genius...my 10 year old does all this but the fake family thing...that might be a little different, but i wouldnt call it  genius....my daughter has a desktop instead of a laptop, but same effect, she still types super fast for 10, its just a matter of her being  around it so much, and doing it.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Super smart. ENCOURAGE her more! <br>  I love the Duggar Family and also Jon and Kate (Duggars are better in my opinion though - Christian family)<br>  Anyway..I think it's great that she is a good typist and is able to assist in the class. This will help her tremendously in the future.<br>  By the way: my son is 10 and he just mastered 25 words per min. (which I know isn't great, but it's a start)|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I am not sure how this would make a child a genius since you can't spell genius. <br>  Sounds to me like a normal thing for a child to do. I remember life being like that. I would make up class lists and write letters home to parents.<br>  My 5 year old even write her class list when she plays school|`|Msx6VKHSaa	that is weird ... i am 11 and don't know how to type fast,and don't have a fake family|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its genius..not genious ..so I dont think youre a very good judge of intellect
miXLkKq7aa	take one now. I recommend the "First Response Digital"...don't do the ones with lines you start second guessing if the line is there or not...just do the digital!<br>  <br>  Those are pregnance symptoms and the light brown spotting could be implantation bleeding, which would cause you to start to feel those symptoms|`|fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	Hey there. Remember that february was a short month. Only 28 days compared to 31. So that might have something to do with why you're late. But if that's not the day and yure counting days....u can take a test and get a positive now.
ZDMUW1YRaa	Very very accurate.  It tests for a hormone HCG, this hormone can only be produced during pregnancy, your pregnant! congrats.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Unless you're taking hormones, a positive test is definitely positive.

Good luck and again, congrats!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	You might be 4 months pregnant..you never know,..unless its normal to miss your period like that. Is this the first time you have taken a test? If so then you really need to get to a doctor asap!
d6GvS2Dpaa	I'm so excited that it is going to be light later, but it is so hard to get up in the morning for work at 6:30 when it is still so dark outside.  It's hard enough to get up when I know my little man is sleeping soundly, but now to throw the darkness on top of it...Oh well!|`|fJiUa5ykaa	I'm not happy about it being light out later at night.<br>  <br>  I like it being dark earlier.  Keeps the neighborhood quieter, making it easier to sleep.  I also go to bed early cause I get up at 4 am for work.|`|X1uOh8ylaa	I personally don't! I much prefer the fall when we get an extra hour!

r7q8LW7Aaa	I tried everything - including syringes, those medicine dummies, spoons, mixing it with milk/juice/yoghurt, and the only thing that worked for me was to put the medecine in a bottle teat and let her drink from the teat.

Of course, it might not work - but it's worth a try!|`|nPt7hUE8aa	When shoving it in her throat hold her mouth shut and sorta massage her throat. This action mimics swallowing. Keep holding her mouth shut cos she will eventually have to swallow.

Blowing in the face causes them to breathe and then they swallow.|`|GtwJsTCeaa	I recommend the Munchkin medication dispenser pacifier....... My baby took medicine so easy with this.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Clamp her nose, hold her mouth, she will swallow.  I know that sounds mean, but it is better then having a ear infection.|`|AA11318212	i was told i had a similar problem when i was young. <br>  have you tried mixing it in her food in small doses?<br>  <br>  for example, if the required dosage is 5ml, divided it into two doses that she doesn't know or isn't aware that its in the food. But try to follow the prescribed dosage as much as possible.<br>  <br>  If you are going to mix it in a drink, i suggest mixing it in a drink that has a really strong taste so she cant detect the medicine. Try giving her the medicine in her juice when she is really thirsty, so she wont have a choice but to drink it.<br>  <br>  Be sure that she doesn't see you prepare the bottle or see the medicine bottle at all so she won't be alerted about it as she'll automatically associate the bottle with medicine.<br>  <br>  My cousin who was a food technologist, mixed my meds in a chocolate rice dish called "champorado" its like porridge only its made out or sticky rice and looks like baby food (gerber kind), that helped since i would eat that all the time, so I was told.<br>  <br>  If that still doesn't work, have you tried holding her mouth open while someone else uses the syringe? Just make sure to aim near the back end of the mouth so it goes straight down. Sounds a bit cruel, but its worth a shot. Just had water handy so she won't feel like she's going to choke. Sometimes, its needed to be a bit cruel to be kind if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, ask the doctor for a change of brand or for shots instead.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I like others tried everything. The pacifies,bottles, mixing it with juice etc.<br>  I found if I stick my finger in and open his mouth then shoot a little medicine and lightly blow on my sons face he automatically swallows.<br>  Nothing but a light blow across the face.<br>  **mrsmummy and I have the same idea!!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Does she eat food off of a spoon yet? The only way I can get my son to take his medicine is to put it on a regular spoon and tell him I have a bite for him. He thinks it's food and automatically opens his mouth. And since it doesn't taste bad he will swallow it down.
tSEA42Uraa	When I have kids, some of them will have nicknames.<br>  <br>  Bennett: Would be called Ben.<br>  Joel: Would probably have no nickname; maybe Joelly.<br>  Nicholas: Would be called Nick.<br>  <br>  Caroline: Would be called Cara.<br>  Shelby: Would probably have no nickname; maybe Bee.<br>  Adrienne: Would be called Addie.<br>  <br>  I also like the name Lillian; if I were to have a girl named Lillian, I'd call her Lily.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|6m6LjAVNaa	Well i have 5 kids and i have to say as they get older you have nothing to say about it really!<br>  I prefer their birth names but kids always wind up with a nick name no matter what their names are.<br>  I love my oldest daughters name but she has always gone by her nick name even since she was a baby,its hard to change that .When she got older she wanted to be called by her actual name but it never caught on.<br>  My oldest son i named after his father but i never wanted him to be called by his dads nick name but now he is a grown man and since high school he goes by both his name and his fathers same nick name.<br>  Same as my younger son i love his name but he shortened it himself back in kindegarten actually from Daniel to Dan.<br>  My oldest from Robert to Bob.<br>  My daughter Cassandra to Cassie.<br>  My name is Robyn but as a child some people called me Robbie they still do,dont sweat the small stuff.<br>  Just give them real names,spelled correctly and gender appropriate and they are already better off than most of the kids out there,good luck!|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	It really does not matter to me, because I go by a nickname. My name is Charlena, but I go by Charly. Always have. There a few people that call me Charlena, but not that many. With my kids though my daughters name is Nevaeh, and I usually call her Vaeh or Vae. Alot of people do. With my son, I hate when people call him by a nickname. His name is Damian, and alot of people in my family call him Damy. I hate it. I dont know why I just do.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	you have alot of answers already so you probably don't need my advice but I have four kids so, My first like another answer her name is katherine and we call her katie, my second is piper and sometimes we call her pipes or even piper diaper, my third is bo and sometimes we call her bo bo, and my fourth is zipporah and we call her zippy. so, it is ok that you call them by nicknames as long as they know you are talking to them and understand. As they get older in age and need to learn to write their name you have to show them their full name and the right way, and explain to them both of their names and why we call them by nicknames, so it is ok go right ahead as long as your child don't mind|`|qGeTeZRnaa	I call my kids by their names. I have not giving them any nicknames. When they get older and in school if their friends have nicknames for them it wont upset me if that's how they address my kids. As long as my kids are ok with it.|`|8HQwcstIaa	I am several years away from being ready to have children, but when I do, being a name nerd, I will probably encourage my children to use their proper first name, and not a nickname.|`|RPc63EK2aa	my 10 week old son has 2 names, but we used to call him on his first name, he is linc andrei, all relatives and friends call him baby linc....i dont have any probz with that either they will call him linc or andrei...|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Well... my name is Roxsanna (gross, I know!) and EVERYBODY calls me Roxy, and I make sure of that. :p|`|mSJwKrQIaa	I think it depends completely on whether your child is comfortable with it. My name is Yasmine. I know it's not long, but my friends just call me 'Yaz'. I mean, I have a lot of friends with longer names, and we just can't be bothered to say their name all the time, so we find that it's easier if you shorten it. One of my friends names is Evangeline, but we call her Evie, same with my friend Daniella - Dani. As long as their okay with it, then it's fine. (:<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. <br>  <br>  Yasmine <3|`|KLLjuXo4aa	Go with what the child feels comfortable with.. My daughter had a teacher that wanted to use her middle name rather than her first name. To which my daughter very politely corrected her on..

My kids have never wanted nicknames at all as they all have really cool and unusual names.<br>  <br>  My youngest son is named Takoda and he goes to a special school and the other kids there call him "Koda" but that is about the only nickname we have in our family.<br>  <br>  I think it is totally stupid to give a child a name and then call them something else.  It really annoys me when people choose a name only because of the "cutesy" nickname that goes with it.|`|rHufcHwHaa	My daughter isn't born yet, but in general I wouldn't care if my kid wanted to use a nickname.  As a mom, I'm just giving her a name that I enjoy.  But it's important to remember that any child is going to have his or her own personality and they may prefer to be called something that is better suited.  In my opinion, it's a little controlling to demand that my child go by a certain name--obviously they should go by the name they were given or a different form of it (i.e. if a boy's name is benjamin, he can go by Benjamin, Ben, Benny, Benji, something along those lines...he can't go by Steve).  <br>  <br>  So to cut down on all the rambling, I'd say that I'd let my child pick.  Before he/she could talk, I'd call him by what I like, but once the child starts having a preference for a certain name, I'd go with that.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	My son goes by his proper full first name, but out of all the girls names I've picked out for my future daughter (wink, wink) She will be called by a shortened form of it.

f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Well I call my son by his birth name Liam. There really isn't a nick name for it. I call my daughter by her nick name most of the time.

I think the child will lyke it in the end because they can say so and so picked out this special name to call me so therefore they must care. also some kids grow up not liking their first name too much so they go by their nickname or middle name. This way the child can have a choice of what he or she prefers to be called|`|laRjvObCaa	Dunno.  Haven't been in that situation.  My daughter's name is Kelsey... which is the only name anybody has ever called her.  Any nicknames my husband and I have for her are personal ones.  <br>  <br>  Again, the names I have picked out for my next baby (don't know yet if its a boy or girl) don't really allow for nicknames.|`|aAQmH5Eaaa	well my name is shannon and my mom, dad and my friends call me shan.

The doctors office should have an after hours answering system.  You need to get ahold of them, if not take him to the ER.

8HQwcstIaa	I think you've done a great job coming up with this name!  Honoring your favorite aunt is a touching thing to do, and Monique matches the first name well, considering they are both of French origin.  The name flows well, too.  I like it.  It sounds very upper-class and grown-up to me.  This is a lady to be taken seriously.|`|2diobki7aa	It's a big name if you're planning on naming a little girl that.<br>  I'd shorten it a bit. Jacqueline Monique is very pretty, but quite a long name. You should keep it at that on the birth certificate, but if you're really naming a child, call her Jackie Monique until she's a little older.<br>  (: Sorry if you just wondered if we liked the name, and you're not naming someone!!!|`|6BdI1xnPaa	It's just ok!!|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I think it flows well.|`|aYlxodqIaa	Jacqueline is a great name, however I'm not in love with Monique.

y8d38Sbgaa	you know, I just wouldn't worry that much.  Your goal with solid food is to have your baby eating 3 meals/day and 2 snacks by the time she is one year old.  The serving size that is expected is 1 tablespoon of each starch, protein, and vegetable for each meal PLUS snacks.  Right now, she is getting all the nutrients she needs from formula and the food is added calories  Your job, at this stage is to provide the food and your babies job is to determine how much she should eat.    <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Lisa|`|333e3165a0426e11bbd47089d6ab94a6aa	my daughter is also 7 months and LOVES finger foods, anything she can hold herself and put in her mouth she adores. have u tried finger foods with your daughter? maybe she will eat things like strips of toast or grated cheese, rice cakes, broccoli florrets etc, this may be a good way of re introducing savory foods? just an idea.<br>  <br>  if all else fails you could offer her only savory foods and if she keeps refusing she will take them before she goes too hungry (obviously at her age only let her go 24 hours refusing, then you will just have to give her something she likes) but as shes having that much milk it would be ok to let her miss a meal or two so that the next time you offer savory she will be more likely to take it as she will be hungry?<br>  <br>  just a couple of things that might work but if she carries on then i would speak to your health visitor<br>  x
6Q698g4Paa	Very strange that you are 6 weeks late and had a negative test. Hmmm, I'd take another in a few days if still no period. Are you normally regular?<br>  <br>  If you are not pregnant I would not give up!!! Make an appointment definetly. What can it hurt!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well you've beat me to that one!  I was 5 weeks late for my period when I got a positive with my son.  It was crazy!  So, that means you'd be 10 weeks pregnant if you were.  <br>  <br>  I'd schedule an ultrasound to see if you are pregnant!  =)  Some women just don't get a positive.  It happens!|`|QKGuNLb4aa	go ahead and go, you never know it could be somthing simple causing your problems like a hormonal imbalance. youll never know unless you go!!!!

T9fek24eaa	If you did have true implantation spotting on cd 32-34, then it would probably still be a bit too early to tell. I would wait a few more days and retest. First response, early response is the most sensitive test they have, also if you use first morning urine it will help too. Good luck hun.|`|2f6diQBiaa	The same thing happened to me this last cycle. I got a positive OPK, spotting that went away, negative pregnancy tests. My temps were very variable, so I was unable to detect any shift. I finally called my doctor on CD 38 and he did an HCG blood test and a progesterone test. Turns out that I never actually ovulated. First time that's ever happened for me (it was my 6th round of Clomid- I ovulated every other time) and it was probably due to stress.<br>  <br>  I would call your doctor and ask for a blood test and a progesterone test. You may be pregnant or the Clomid may not have worked for some reason this cycle.<br>  <br>  I hope you are pregnant! Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!
ZA3N1wE4aa	:) Congratulations! It is hard to believe at first, isn't it?! <br>  <br>  Some women have increased discharge and some don't.

SlBsJ3NRaa	Advantages to children close in age:<br>  Built-in-playmate<br>  Once they are a bit older they can share clothes<br>  Hand-me-downs that aren't all that old<br>  Still have all the baby furniture out<br>  Potty training usually comes quicker with child #2 from watching big brother/big sister<br>  All the baby raising rules are still fairly new in your head<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  You're up all night with a baby then up all day with a toddler.<br>  You have endless doctor appointments.<br>  Being pregnant while chasing a toddler isn't fun.<br>  Unless you have gender neutral colors, you have to buy new if it's opposite what you already have.<br>  You could have twins, which guarantees no sleep at all.<br>  Having to strap and unstrap 2 kids from carseats isn't fun.<br>  <br>  Big gap advantages: <br>  The older child can help with the younger one.<br>  With an older child, you can focus more on the baby's needs without worrying what your other child is into. <br>  You can sleep when the baby sleeps. <br>  You can divide up chores with your older child.<br>  Your older child can feel important by helping you.<br>  It can give the older child practice with babies.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  Your older child may resent the younger one.<br>  The baby may keep your older child from sleeping well and effect his/her schoolwork.<br>  Your older child could regress because of jealously of the baby.<br>  You have to buy all new things because the older childs baby stuff is probably long gone.<br>  You have to get used to sleepless nights all over again.<br>  Your older child may want to claim your younger one for their own (I've seen it...)|`|OhYE3GhKaa	ad. it is very nice for the children to grow up close together. I had Rene 13 months after Lee and Nate was born 2 years later then I later had triplets. there is no closer bond. Carrie is in there somewhere. <br>  <br>  they are extremely close knit now even though they are grown with children of their own. <br>  <br>  the other day they went to the circus in Newark NJ Rene picked up her niece and her baby Carrie met them there My sister brought my great grandson and my other daughter, my son Lee and his girl and his baby. I was thinking how wonderful that was.<br>  <br>  We had our rough times as I was the single parent of all those children at one time. there are a lot of material advantages you fore go when you have children close together. Formula and pampers are very expensive. <br>  <br>  so you must put it all together and see what you come up with. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't trade all these kids for ANYTHING in te world.<br>  actually one more advantage to having children close together is take the diaper stage and the stage of never being able to walk out the door without first making sure someone is properly caring for the children, might as well get it over with all at once. Get them in school together. Plus as treacherous as this world is getting it pays for them to have someone who will have their back.
prqrQcd1aa	My youngest two are about 18 months apart. They play together very well, they go to bed around the same time, and they can share a room together with no problems..for now atleast!<br>  Disadvantages would be having 2 kids in diapers i'll have to say!|`|0MunIx8raa	having them close in age allows them to have mostly the same interests at the same time so they can play together.  Disadvantage is that they will fight over their same interests.  With a big gap they have nothing in common with each other and will fight over everything Or the older one may be protective over the younger one and it may work out good...but they won't be playing together.|`|fAN8snFdaa	The benifest for me personally having my first three close in age was that they ALWAYS had a play mate, they learnt from their siblings..<br>  <br>  My older sisters were 13 months apart and they fought like cat and dog..? depends on the child really<br>  <br>  As for larger gaps disadvantages can be that the older one doesnt want to 'play' with the younger.. they younger one can 'cramp their style' when they have friends over (i know from having older siblings) <br>  <br>  Also younger ones can pick up bad habbits and learn undesireable behaviour and language earlier then they normally would have.. <br>  <br>  as for advantages.. kids are great .. i'd have 10 if i could !!  :)|`|BKbEE9qZaa	well my brother is 6 years older than me and I've always felt distance with him. my girls are 2 1/2 years apart - we'll see how it goes.|`|hH8QAictaa	My brother and I are a couple of years apart. I couldn't imagine if he was any younger. We can talk about teen stuff like for him<br>  About girls and me about guys. We both don't watch cartoons any more so instead of fghtng over what to watch we both watch the same thing. We aren't alone in school if I get in a fight with my friends I get to sit with him ( I get attention from this because my bros friends are really popular and cute) if there's something he can't tell mom or dad he just tells me cause he knows I prob have been through the same thng.|`|qCFwSyFAaa	i am 11 and my brother is 10 the good are that we play together a lot the bad things are that we fight to|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Well when they are similar in age they like the same things...but they always fight over them. The big gap of ages is good because they usually don't fight over toys. Disadvantage they are different stages meaning one could be still in diapers and with a binkey and the other one going to school acting like a big kid.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I think advantages are that they have each other to play with and they can support each other. I have twins so for my first it wasn't much choice. It's nice because my twins always have each other.<br>  <br>  disadvantages are you pay for things double, like if you have them close you could have two in diapers at once or two in braces at once (like us). They tend to argue a bit more with each other when they are closer in age. My twins are 14 now and my other two are 11 and 9. My 9 yr old doesn't fight as much with my twins as does my 11 yr old or the twins themselves. they still have their moments but it's different. <br>  <br>  I like having them close, the biggest issue is the cost of things. By the time my twins come out of the braces my 11 yr old will be getting them so no break between.
oj1TszL2aa	I'm sure that your Mum doesn't think that you're a bad person at all, she's probably just feeling frustrated because as you say, you feel that soccer is your entire life and she's worried that you will sacrifice your school work because of it. It's great that you have such big dreams, and want to become pro one day, but there are a lot of people who have such dreams and it's important that you have good grades in your studies to fall back on, just in case you don't manage to get there. <br>  <br>  How can you improve your ability to balance schoolwork, soccer, and any other things you want to do with your time? The easiest way is probably to make sure that you get really organised. Do you really have several projects to work on at the same time, or does it just work out like that because you don't start each of them when you're first set the work, and then end up doing them all at once? <br>  <br>  Use a homework planner if your school gives you one (or if not, get a notebook and use it for that). Make sure you write down all the work that you're given, and when it's due in. Then you need to work out a schedule for yourself - split all your time into blocks, when you have classes at school, when you have soccer practice, when you have other extra curricular activities that you do every week. Then you can start writing in times that you're going to use to do school work, and times you're going to use to go to the gym/improve your soccer skills etc. <br>  <br>  When you've created your schedule, stick it up somewhere obvious, and make sure that you stick to it! You will find it a lot easier to concentrate on your school work if you know that you only have to work on it for an hour or so, and then you can practise soccer or do something else that you want to do, and then go back to studying again, and if you feel that you have to get something done in a certain time (note, I'm NOT saying rush it) then you will likely learn more constructively and get more done. <br>  <br>  I know that soccer is really important to you, that's obvious from what you've written. However I'm sorry to say that your school work should come first - don't rush it in order to be able to spend more time on soccer! Like I said, you might appreciate it later in life. However, I've found that if I start studying and just think 'I'll work until it's done', I tend to get less done and it just drags out and takes ages, so if possible try to do even just a little soccer and a little school work every day.<br>  <br>  It's good that you're trying to resolve the problem rather than just going into a teenage sulk - maybe talk to your Mum and tell her what you're planning to do, show her the schedule that you've worked out (but then make sure you stick to it once you've told her!). Good luck with everything!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|nyeYS0Seaa	fist her asshole.|`|Ga0XjgV1aa	responsibility
DnNkCF6Taa	I would say go in one final time with mediation and tell the courts what has been happening that your son is constantly let down by his father and that you want to try to sue for full custody due to the behavior of the father.  As far as the stepfather if he wants to be a more of a role you could see if the stepfather could adopt your son and make him the legally binding parent as well due to the behaviors of the father and how the step father is taking care of your son.
lGKq9NXbaa	there's nothing you can do about i unless you file for full custody or move all together. one day a week isn't that bad. try talking to your ex about how he is hurting your son. and talk to your son about it too. there's not much else you can do.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Even if you don't want to, you should go back to court and explain all this to the judge and see what he/she thinks. If it's in the best interest of the child to not see him (because of the father blowing him off) the court will be able to come up with when and where he can see his child. I don't think it's right to deny your sons dad from seeing him, but if you are able to limit it to once a month for a few hours, he may come to appreciate seeing him more and actually show up. If you're not already, I would also try to get child support. Just because he doesn't want to be part of the raising doesn't mean he shouldn't help provide.|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Well, that's just what happens when you conduct your life as you have.  People think nothing of moving in with people they aren't' married to, which for 99% of human history was completely unacceptable.  Yet we think we know better today.  You have to do things in life IN ORDER.  You get engaged, then married, THEN you move in together of course, THEN you have a kid.  When you do things outside of that natural order, it will ALWAYS be a disaster.  You have to make a clean break and start over.  If his step father satisfies your son, then that is fortunate and you should take advantage of that, and I hope you have married this person and are not just living with him and "having a good time."  Your son is watching.  Do you want him to imitate this behavior when he is 20 and have the chaos in his life that you (and he) experience now?  Get things in order, in the proper order, and everything will fix itself over time.  If you continue the non-orderly process, the chaos will never end.  Marriage causes commitment and without that commitment, it's always too easy for, especially the man in a relationship, to just walk away.  That's something you should work hard to avoid for your sake and your son.|`|sGa0dahuaa	your son seems like he is in good hands with you and your new husband. Your ex needs to decide if he wants to see his child or not, you should go through the legal process one more time and state that if he doesn't follow through the child is yours and your ex needs to stay away.<br>  you are doing everything you can for your son and unfortunately your ex isn't. Go to your lawyer of a counselor and ask what you should do.<br>  you sound like a great mother, hang in there!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Hi,<br>  I live in Australia but do not know very much about the legalities involved in shared custody. I'm sorry that your ex-partner is being such a lousy father and has put you and your son through so much turmoil.<br>  Obviously mediation is not working if your ex can not abide by the arrangements. If I were in your position, I would go to court and make formal custody arrangements. Where you have sole custody but your ex has visitation rights. Then, when your ex does not abide by that arrangement, go back to court and seek full custody without visitation. Advise your solicitor about the psychological damage your ex is doing to your child by failing to show up for visits. Hopefully the judge will take note and will award you full custody without the visitations, at least on a temporary basis.|`|ybexjS2Paa	I'm actually surprised that you've never taken his sorry a** to court and made him pay child support. There's nothing you can do on your own, you need a legal advice. Do you have full custody? The father needs to know that he's playing with child's feelings and hurts him so either he backs off or starts taking his responsibilities seriously.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	If your last period started on January 17th and you only had a small amount of spotting on March 5th. You would be 7 weeks pregnant. Youd be due October 24th 2009. <br>  The small amount of spotting on March 5th doesnt count. Sometimes women have small amounts of spotting during pregnancy because they have irritated their cervix (by having sex, or overworking themselves). Congrats on the pregnancy.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	You would be 7 weeks pregnant and your due date would be October 24th.  =)|`|KTNqah9eaa	I would check with your doctor.|`|98WKYtfwaa	A doctor counts how far along you are from the first day of your last period.<br>  <br>  If your period was anywhere inbetween the 17th to the 30th then you could be anywhere between 5 and 7weeks pregnant.|`|MkKvGdxKaa	Butterfly baby has this one covered.<br>  <br>  You should let the doc know about the spotting though. It happens all the time and is normally nothing to worry about but it's worth a mention.<br>  <br>  Congratulations|`|jiTKnCKpaa	Between 5-7 weeks it depends what the first day of your last period was.|`|0ejfWPytaa	i would say around a month and half pregnant. but i am sure your not really suposed to be spotting.. i would go see your docor to comfirm things are ok :) <br>  <br>  congrats if you are pregnant :)
laRjvObCaa	Well, I think it depends on whether or not you've missed a period or are having pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  I am 15 wks pregnant right now.  We had been trying.  Before I got my positive test this time, I took between 8-10 tests that came out negative.  But I am also impatient and started testing way earlier than I should have.  I got my positive result on the exact day my period should have started.  So had I been a normal person (hahaha) and waited until I was supposed to, I might only have had 1-3 negatives beforehand.  <br>  <br>  If you are trying and know you'll be taking multiple tests, my advice is to go online and find bulk strips.  I bought a pack of 50 pregnancy tests for $10 on e-bay.  They were more sensitive than most store bought brands and were just small little strips that you dunk in a cup of urine.  I prefer that then trying to catch something mid-stream.  hahaha.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes to you!|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Stop trying to get a positive and just enjoy the sex... then wait for that time of month to come and see if it does... I believe that the body and the brain are most powerful and if you worry and stress each time about getting a positive then the body and brain wont make it happen... if you just be happy and enjoy the sex then good things happen at the right time... but thats just what i believe!!!!|`|BsaJoP3aaa	you should test about 6 to 7 times before giving up  if it has been several months and you are still testing for negative then go to your doctor with the guy you are having sex with then letting you two and the doctor decide what you what for your future the best time for pregnancy is spring or fall or ever summer.|`|ZXyZAm7Qaa	Should never give up :)|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I think that would depend on the other factors that are going on:  How far apart you've taken the tests, whether or not you've gotten your period, what kind of symptoms you're having, etc.  It's not just about the tests.  If you're concerned, go see a doctor and have a blood test done and find out for sure.  Blood tests will give you a more accurate result.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i tested the morning my period was due and there was my two lines id been waiting for. i guess if it was negative i would have waited at least 24hours lol then retested the next morning and the morning after until i got my period or a positive|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	If I don't get a positive by a day or two after my missed period then I give up.  I always take them after I first wake up in the morning because that is when there is the most hormone in your urine.|`|JL9Nwgvwaa	Well I would take one once a week at the same time, about 3 - 5 weeks after sex.<br>  <br>  You could always take a urine sample to your GP<br>  <br>  *Angel*|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I took 13..and finally got a faint positive|`|bVkIEpyGaa	Shouldn't you keep testing until you either get your period or give birth?

SxPhldhhaa	The main points I would bring up would be that having a weekend off is a necessary stress reliever for kids, and that the extra time helps kids do things they wouldn't normally have time to do on a school day.<br>  <br>  First of all, kids (especially those in high school and ones in an advanced curriculum) are likely to be stressed out over the week and having Saturdays off helps them cool off and calm down. I always appreciate being able to take a break from homework when Saturday rolls over. Saturday school would lead to more stress, which can cause health problems, suicide/self-harm, or the urge to harm others. Also, many of us like to sleep in on Saturdays, making up for the lack of sleep we often experience on school days when we're up until 4 A.M studying for exams.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of kids have extracurricular activities to participate in on Saturdays. I take piano and voice lessons and work on computer programming and game design projects over the weekend, activities that would never fit into my hectic schedule on school days. These activities can be just as beneficial as academic-related subjects, if not even more so to students who seek future careers in those subjects (I want to study game design in college, so experimenting with it now might end up being more useful than some things I learn in school), and replacing them with an extra day of school would not be a good idea. Also, students who have missing assignments or projects can use the extra time over the weekend to make them up.<br>  <br>  Good luck writing your essay!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Teachers need time to mark stuff, we need breaks and our parents want to spend time with us.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Because the weekend is for relaxing, and just chilling out with them having to worry about school or homework.|`|GuFwv7Vzaa	Talk about :<br>  <br>  - kids need rest <br>  - kids need time to study<br>  - kids need time to be with their families <br>  - kids need time to meet new people out of school<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|zHRWklEWaa	Everybody needs the down time, children need a day to run around outside, spend time with there families, and just chill out.|`|10b1R3ibaa	Because they may have to go to church on sunday and then they would never get a lie in!|`|2a0f2b5cd5b63b922ee24107d664903faa	First of all, the standards nowadays are rigorous!  They are intense!  Adding a Saturday full of more intense work for kids would not be good for their stress levels.<br>  <br>  Secondly, teachers would pull their hair out and go insane.  There's not enough mental help facilites to help the amount of teachers that will need it if they added Saturday to the school week.|`|foJm2Yftaa	I'm taking an essay for 5 months and its stressing me out (I have kids at home and I need to be with them and be at the essay). Kids need breaks. If they are like doing work all week, they might be stressed and more work than usual. I like how it is right now.|`|AMRNqIAaaa	we're worked hard through the week,<br>  teachers seem to believe that their class is the only one that matters so they don't care about our excuses on why we don't complete our work on time.<br>  stress!<br>  everyone needs a break, why do adults get days off?|`|pW8Hit6kaa	Well, kids these days are getting very stressed, and stress can lead to suicide, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. They need the weekend to rest and relieve this stress.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Because having an extra day in those brainwashing institutions would double the amount of school shootings and suicides.
laRjvObCaa	If you have the money to blow, I'd recommend a hand held gaming device like the Nintendo DS.  It is the most adult friendly hand held system.  They have brain building games, board type games, etc.  I like doing crossword puzzles and suduko puzzles on it. <br>  <br>  Buy some magazines or books.  Maybe some scrapbooking supplies if you want to try light scrapbooking.  Try writing letters and cards for family/friends.<br>  <br>  I think boredom is going to be inevitable for you.  Just keep a positive spirit and enjoy the downtime.|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	I would get creative on painting my nails. That takes time to do designs. Maybe do your hair. Think of a new hairstyle that will help once baby comes. It's so hard to keep up with hair that isn't easily managed. Start a baby book. Put together a scrap book. Obviously the pics will be missing but you can put in the sheets of colorful paper and decorations. So it will be ready once the pictures come of all of the babies firsts.|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	I hear you!!! I'm in the same spot. I'm 37 weeks, 5 days and I have been on total bed rest in the hospital since Monday. I'm so bored!! <br>  I haven't found anything that really works but you could try reading baby care books. If you have any photos you have taken saved on your computer, you could get some free photo editing software onine and play with that for a while to pass some time. I go to addictinggames.com and waste some time on there, too. Also looking up baby care and development websites is interesting. Sometimes my husband plays yahtzee with me. In the end, though, I end up watching a LOT of TV with a shower being my big adventure of the day...lol. <br>  <br>  I hope the time passes faster for you! I'm going home today (still on bedrest) but they might induce labor on Monday. I kind of hope so, I'm so sick of laying in bed when I feel fine!! It's all worth it, though, to deliver a healthy baby!
ay8tXLD2aa	I also disagree with your doctor, but I think that it's a personal choice about introducing new foods slowly. (ie/ my son has major food allergies and so our consultant paediatrician told us to go VERY slowly, one new food per week rather than the usual one new food every 3 or 4 days, while the paediatric dietician we saw told me that rule is nonsense and to just start feeding him! So, you can sit on either side of the fence with that!)<br>  <br>  A few important things to note about introducing solids:<br>  1. Breastmilk or formula is the most important food for your baby until they are one year old. If breastfed, continue to feed on demand, if formula feeding your baby still needs a minimum of 24 ounces of formula per day until they are one year old. <br>  <br>  2. Until they are one year old, solids are for the "experience" - new textures, new tastes, the concept of eating, learning to feed him/herself, etc.  Do not force, rush, or push your baby into eating. You decide when and what your baby eats, your baby will decide how much. <br>  <br>  3. One new food every 3 or 4 days is best, especially if there is any history of allergies in your family.  Offer the new food in the mornings, at breakfast, so that if there is a reaction or if it upsets your baby's tummy, it won't ruin his/her sleep at night, and if it is serious, then there is time to see your doctor.  Once a new food has been proven to be okay, move it to the afternoon, and introduce another new food in the morning. <br>  <br>  4.  Offer milk first, solids about an hour later.  So, if you were feeding at (example) 7am, 11am, 3pm and 7pm,  now you will (roughly) do 7am milk, 8am solids, 11am milk, 12noon solids etc. etc.   The first week or two only worry about one "meal" a day (most likely a breakfast time solid food). After baby is used to the idea of eating, add a lunchtime meal. Once you have a good variety of foods and baby is getting more used to it, add dinner.  <br>  <br>  It is too early to drop a bottle. Around 8 or 9 months you will notice your baby is drinking less milk at either his 11am or 3pm milk feed, and over the course of a week or so, you can amalgamate these two feeds into one milk feed at say, 1230 or 1pm.  By then, solids will be well established anyway. <br>  <br>  Good luck and just remember to have fun!|`|ybexjS2Paa	You have to introduce new food slowly, just in case he could be allergic to something. He still needs his bottles! You normally can give him solids 3 times a day ( that is cereal, dinner, and a jar of fruits) and his bottles at least 2-3 times a day. The older he gets the less milk he'll drink. My 14 month old still has milk first thing in the morning, which is a special one for kids who are over 12 months and of course she drinks it out of sippy cup.|`|Ql09WZa8aa	My daughter is 2 years old and I still give her a bottle, never stop milk from an infant he will need every single drop of calcium... <br>  4 to 6 month old Solid Food Chart<br>  The current recommendations indicate that breast milk or formula should be baby’s main source of nutrition until at least 6 months of age! While we believe it is best to delay solids until baby is 6 months of age, we have included this 4 - 6 month age range because many parents begin solid foods at 4 months of age. Please visit the bottom of this page to read what other sources have to say about delaying solids.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I would say a weeks time frame in between changing foods to see if he's allergic or not. That's the time frame my doctor gave me, and I think its a pretty good time frame to make sure there's no allergies with foods. Yep, still too early to take the bottle away, up until a year. You can start to wean and fully transition to a sippy cup at a year, although if you have trouble, you can always wait a month or so and try again. My daughter finally got fully weaned from the bottle at 14 months, so it took a little bit of extra time to get her off--which is no biggie. The milk (breastmilk or formula) should be the main form of nutrtion up until a year, solids are just for practice, so keep that in mind when you're feeding. You have to worry more about nutritional value at a year, when you transfer over from formula to whole milk (or 2%), depending on if you're breastfeeding or not and how long you plan to do so.
VGq2uAkxaa	R u kidding us? Please tell ur parents ASAP.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	There is no special way to tell the parents of a 13 year old that their daughter is pregnant.  They are going to be upset no matter what.  To ease the blow a bit you should have a long term game plan, and tell them about it when you tell them you are pregnant.  Just say- "Mom, Dad, I'm pregnant and here is my plan.  I'm keeping the baby/ I'm putting the baby up for adoption/ I'm getting an abortion."  If you plan on keeping the baby then you need to let them know what you plan to do about school and money to support the baby.  <br>  As far as food goes, when you make your first doctor's appointment, (Which needs to be ASAP) they will tell you what to stay away from.  Things like raw fish, any uncooked meat, alcohol, any drugs or medications not prescribed by the doctor.  Don't change the kitty litter box if you have a cat.  They will tell you this at your first appointment and just follow the advice of your doctor to a tee.|`|AA11348933	Tell the parents first.  Say "Mom, Dad, I'm pregnant and really scared.

If you're too scared to talk to your Mom I recommend that you tell another female or male adult that you trust. Guidance Councilors are good if the ones at your school are nice and supportive.

However, symptoms of pregnancy are not the same for every woman. In fact, your own symptoms may actually be different from one pregnancy to another.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy symptoms can also vary in their intensity, frequency and duration. The following early signs and symptoms of pregnancy checklist is only a guideline.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that many of the earliest pregnancy symptoms can appear similar to routine pre-menstrual discomforts.<br>  <br>  If you are not trying to conceive, you might think it is just your period coming on again, when in reality you may be experiencing very early signs of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to conceive, you may be frustrated when you think you may be experiencing early symptoms of pregnancy but they are only pre-menstrual symptoms.<br>  <br>  You will experience a wide variety of physical and emotional changes during pregnancy. These may include any or all of the pregnancy symptoms listed below.<br>  <br>  Although each of these are considered typical early symptoms of pregnancy, they may happen earlier or later than the order in which they appear on the following list.<br>  <br>  Remember, some of the earliest signs of pregancy may be subtle, not obvious. Whenever there is any question that you might be experiencing early signs of pregnancy, do a home pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #1<br>  <br>  Missed Period<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most obvious early symptom of pregnancy is when you've missed your period. This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self.<br>  <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many women experience nausea in the morning when they have coffee and/or eat something on an empty stomach. This is known as morning sickness (see below). Other women notice nausea in the afternoon or evening. Others feel queasy all day.<br>  <br>  This pregnancy symptom may often be helped by eating smaller, more frequent snack size meals. Many women say saltine crackers and milk seem to be helpful. This is an early symptom of pregnancy that seems to show up about a month after pregnancy has begun. It tends to level off once you are into your second trimester and your body adjusts to all the many changes it is going through.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #8<br>  <br>  Food Cravings, or Aversions to Foods<br>  <br>  A well-known cliché is the pregnancy sign-symptom of craving certain foods or unusual combinations of foods. For example, one woman said she craved midnight snacks of warm peach pie topped with vanilla ice cream. Everyone has a funny story about food cravings.<br>  <br>  Taking a good pre-natal vitamin supplement and a pure fish oil capsule may ease some cravings and help prevent extra weight gain (see below) ... and of course it is doctor recommended for the health of your baby.<br>  <br>  Less well known but equally common pregnancy signs are aversions to certain foods. You may find that some foods you previously enjoyed are no longer appetizing. One woman told us she had always liked pizza, but couldn't stand it at all while she was expecting. Just the smell of it made her feel nausea. This problem may come and go for some women. For others it could last throughout pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #10<br>  <br>  Morning Sickness<br>  <br>  This pregnancy symptom is well known, and it is related to the nausea symptom.

Less sensitive urine tests and qualitative blood tests may not detect pregnancy until three or four days after implantation. Menstruation occurs on average 14 days after ovulation, so the likelihood of a false negative is low once a menstrual period is late. The amount of hCG increases drastically with each passing day you are pregnant. If you miss this next period take your test about a week after the missed period for better results. Buy a test, First Response is a good choice, get one that has two test in case you need to retest yourself. Be sure when you do test, do it in the morning with your first urination cause first urination carries higher amounts of hCG. If positive feel free to retest the next day and if positive again then see a doctor for confirmation. If you are negative and still having symptoms then you need to talk to your doctor, it may just be stress.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Hmmmm.  Sounds a little heavier then a implantation spotting.  BUT, vaginal bleeding isn't uncommon in your first trimester.<br>  <br>  Try taking a test either once the bleeding as stopped or when you've officially missed your period.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	take if when you miss your period. don't stress too much, that can also cause a late period.
A9MDoFooaa	hi<br>  a false negative is far more likely than a false positive - so theres still every chance you are pregnant. unfortunately the symptoms for early pregnancy and those associated around the beginning of each cycle are so similar its hard to tell the difference.<br>  yes the weakness of your pee will def have an effect on the test. get another one and do not have a drink in the evening before bed and so try and get a really concentrated wee for testing in the morning! <br>  good luck|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	You very well may be pregnant.  Try waiting atleast 4 hours before testing.  Your wee may be too diluted.   Here is some information on discharge while pregnant.<br>  <br>  Cervical Fluid When First Pregnant<br>  When pregnancy occurs, the cervix begins producing a mucus plug, which produces a lot of white creamy cervical fluid. When first pregnant, the fluid may be dry, or you may notice a little more creamy fluid. Usually when menstruation draws near, the fluid will take on a more creamy/watery appearance. When pregnant it will be more whitish or yellowish.<br>  <br>  Both pregnancies my nipples were the part that HURT like a bugger.  It wasn't really my boobs per say, just my nipples.  Keep on testing!|`|AA11785285	Unprotected sex = pregnancy.  LIkely you are pregnant.  That's what it's for.|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Taking the test first thing in the mourning is best. Go see your doctor and take another test there because their one are more accurate. Don't be too anxious because you can be really disappointed if it still comes back negative. Don't give up if it comes back negative because my youngest is 9 and i have been trying for nearly a year now and God has answered my prayer. Keep praying to God he will listen when the time is right.|`|758cDKEFaa	dont drink water beforehand.<br>  i was told that wtaer makes your urine weaker so it wont pick up a pregnancy.<br>  id drink something else or wait all night then when you wake up you should have a full bladder and test agen.<br>  your hcg levels should be high enough to pick up on a pregnancy so stay clear of the water and then test.<br>  good luck and let us know how it goes!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	My period was supossed to come on September 25th...and I didnt finally get a positive till October 8th! So 15 days later after my missed period....And I was taking a pregnany test every single day...So dont give up..It all depends on your body|`|nISYAHkfaa	It sucks that you're having to wait so long! I sympathize!<br>  <br>  From your symptoms I would say you're probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for your question, some women do not produce enough pregnancy hormones for a test to register them properly. You mentioned drinking a lot of water, yes this can cause the test to not be able to pick up proper levels of hormones in your urine.<br>  <br>  Try measuring out the normal amount of water most women drink and ration it throughout the day. Most conventional wisdom states that this is about 36 oz., but you'll also be getting fluid from food, so in reality you don't need to drink that much straight. I generally find a good ballpark is anywhere from 20 oz. to 30 oz. depending on how much watery food you eat a day. If you eat entirely soups and watery fruits, for example, then 20 oz. is pretty good. (But of course, if you are having symptoms of dehydration, go ahead and drink more water, regardless of what it does to your test results--don't hurt yourself!)<br>  <br>  Another thing that can help is to use your first morning urine. Pee before going to bed but don't drink any water to cap off your night, and then take the test when you first go to the bathroom in the morning. Your hormones are most concentrated in the first morning urine.<br>  <br>  Finally, make absolutely sure you are taking the test properly. A simple re-reading of the instructions can work wonders sometimes, this is what happened to me this past time. =)<br>  <br>  If all this fails, then I would go to your doctor for a urine/blood test there, since the doctor's equipment is more sensitive than a used-at-home stick. =)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well the stress and wanting to be pregnant can delay your period and cause phantom symptoms.  I would stop drinking all fluids around 7pm and take another test first thing when you wake up since that is when you would have the most hormone in your urine.|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	it sounds like u may be preg. but i'd wait another week or so to take another pregnancy test. most of them take at least two weeks.
SEzIkGNiaa	Hey, I babysit during full time during the summer and here is what I do (2 girls):<br>  <br>  We sometimes walk to the dollar store, and I let them pick out crafts or coloring books.  We also walk to the park.  And a grocery store and have a little treat.  <br>  <br>  We played lots outside:  Jump Rope, hula Hoop, Side Walk Chalk ect...<br>  <br>  They came over to my house which is literally across the street to play with my siblings.<br>  <br>  We baked!  We made muffins, cookies and cupcakes.  I let them mix and decorate.  We also made a special breakfast, with pancakes and fruits.<br>  <br>  Movies:  We watched movies on rainy days and had popcorn!<br>  <br>  Cards:  We made cards for our parents, telling how much we love them and appreciate everythng they do for us.<br>  <br>  Board Games:  Snakes and Ladders, Hannah Montana games, guess who, connect 4 ect...<br>  <br>  Barbies/Dolls<br>  =]|`|jcEtRUVZaa	There are so many fun things you can do.

1z3C0R2Vaa	Pull out is not safe so wait and see what happen if she is safe use your condom because pull out is trouble good luck.........)|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	there is no pulling out before chance of pregnancy! Sorry to tell you but if your penis is in her vagina, there is ALWAYS chance of pregnancy! Even before you orgasm, there is a chance that you release a few sperm here and there. There is no amount of control that can keep it from happening. If you dont want a baby, you need to use SOME sort of birth control. If you dont want to wear a condom, look into pills (free or reduced cost from planned parenthood) or over the counter methods like spermicidal films, foams or sponges. These methods are cheap and available at any drug store in the condom aisle. they are VERY easy to use and fairly effective if used correctly. I used the films for a LONG time with no problems. You insert one (in to the vagina) 15 minutes before intercourse, it dissolves and then you're fine. You have to use something other than the "pull out" method. Tons of people walk the earth today because their parents pulled out! Use some form of birth control, it will calm your nerves and sex will be much more satisfying.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Noone can tell you the exact chances. If she misses a period,have her take a test. USE PROTECTION if you don't want a baby.

93rcsmu0aa	Well its to late for 'what ifs' now. I take it there is no father around?

I think you know what the other one is, but that's up to you.

Some women have bouts of premature labor and still can end up going overdue. I think since you had a previous early delivery your odds are definitely higher that you will deliver early, but nobody can say when that might happen. <br>  <br>  Just follow your doc's instructions and rest. The good news is that at 28 weeks survival rates for babies surpass 95%. Hang in there!|`|AA10381258	Be careful and do as your doctor instructs you. I went into preterm labor and lost my mucus plug at 25 weeks. I was put on bed rest and medications to stop contractions.

I just keep making goals. At 25 weeks they told me I'd deliver within 2 weeks, so that was my first goal. Then I pushed it to 30 weeks. Now I'm pushing for 35 weeks. Good luck!

You constantly feel like you have to pee, but when you try, nothing comes out. get her to the dr so she can get antibiotics for it.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Sounds like a urine infection, common in pregnant woman. <br>  <br>  She should see a doctor soon, an untreated UTI can lead to preterm labour and miscarriages etc. A quick course of antibiotics will clear it up.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	sounds like a kidney infection. she needs to see a doctor asap and get antibiotics|`|wFe7L1XJaa	take her to the doctor asap|`|laRjvObCaa	Sounds like a Urinary Tract Infection.  I had one my first pregnancy - Pregnant women are more susceptible.<br>  <br>  I constantly felt like I had to pee.  When I did manage to go, only a drip or so would come out or nothing.  While peeing, it was like urinating glass.  And I had a very uncomfortable feeling in my pelvic area.<br>  <br>  She needs to start drinking a LOT of water and cranberry juice to dilute the infection AND call her doctor or go to the ER.<br>  <br>  With mine, I went to the emergency room and they knew within 10 minutes that I had a UTI.  They immediately gave me a shot of antibiotics there and sent me home with a prescription.  I felt mostly better within 8 hours and all the way better after a day and a half.|`|rnOJn2UCaa	Hi there I would say your wife has a urine infection, simply go to the doctor and she will be back to normal in no time. Really.
rJ1uwS0Yaa	Yes these are the pregnancy symptoms and if you missed your period then go for the urine or blood test.They will confirm your pregnancy.Good luck ,lots of baby dust to you.|`|cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	well if you are noticing a difference in your body, feeling hungry, sleepier then usual and a missed period, then it could be possible you are pregnant. But the only way to find out is to take a home pregnancy, First Response pregnancy test is a good brand and comes with two test and it is pretty accurate. Just be sure to take your test in the morning with your first urination cause it will carry more of the pregnancy hormone if you are pregnant. If you are positive feel free to test again and if still positive you need to go to the dr to get a confirmation that you are pregnant and then go from there. Take your test as soon as you can. If your not pregnant and these symptoms are still continuing you should talk to your doctor. Hope everything goes well and if your pregnant congrats.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, if you have missed your period you are ready to take a pregnancy test dear!  =)  I just recently found out I was pregnant and I was 2 days late for my period.

If it shows a negative, try again in another few days.|`|WnlzScIyaa	You can take one now, but morning is the best time to do so. Go get one!|`|BCD3Xo6faa	Go for it! IF you have missed your period there should be enough hormone to register on the test. Good Luck!|`|tSKBsbIyaa	Generally home pregnancy test should be taken after 12-15 days you missed your period, that will give you aaccurte results. The test taken before can also give you result, but at times it may happen that initially you getnegative and later on after several days if you try, you may get it positive.<br>  As per my info, you should wait for atleast 10 more days, after you skipped your regular cycle. Which although i know so difficult live in dilemna. But that will give you assured result.<br>  All the best..|`|jy5mc8nqaa	You can take one now.  Typically the best time to test would be 14-15 days past ovulation.  Since you are already 5 days past your period, go get a test girlie!  You don't have to wait til morning, just hold your pee for 3 hours and don't drink anything in that time!  Good luck! :)|`|bNAqsZgDaa	When I was late bout a week, I took a test but showed negative, but then I tried in a weeks time and it was positive, so i guess you have to have enough pregnancy hormones for the test to pick up, sometimes there isn't enough preg hormones, so you have to wait for a week or 2.|`|rJ1uwS0Yaa	Yes you can go for it now i also test on the 5th day of my missed period and it shows me positive at that time.Good luck to you.Lots of baby dust to you.|`|GHDJCYUQaa	buy a pregcolour card.<br>  and drop first drop of urine in morning<br>  its changed it color if you are pregnant|`|WOpSL0CCaa	wat  a  stupaid  question

SlBsJ3NRaa	My boys know that they are for girls because girls have periods. They are almost 4 and 5. When they asked what a period is, I just said it's something big girls and mommies get every month when they don't have babies in their tummies. They were satisfied with that. Plus, it's telling them the truth.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Depends on your child I guess. My daughter knows that mommy bleeds 1x/month, and that I used tampons or pads during that time. I've told her in about 7-10 years she'll get her period, grow hair and breasts, and then she'll be able to use them as well. *shrug* I'm not big on hiding things from kids or making them a huge (scary) mystery when it's just nature taking it's course.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Assuming the q-tip up the butt wasn't a reminisence of past constipation treatments...I don't see why you can't tell her the truth about periods, now.

Telling her anymore than that will either scare her, or pique her curiosity further which couldn't be good (and could lead to her knowing FAR too much too soon).<br>  <br>  I remember when I was little (probably about 3 or 4). My cousin and I (she was probably 5) found some pads at grandmas house. We were in the bathroom, alone and didn't know what the heck they were BUT we soon figured out they were sticky on one side...much like stickers which any kid that age LOVES stickers. So we stuck them to ourselves, used the WHOLE package, and then went about our playing. When the adults finally decided to check on us they couldn't conceal their laughter. I didn't know at the time what we had done that was wrong or funny, but they just told us not to play with those anymore, that they were not stickers. It wasn't a huge deal. I don't think I pried at all as to why we couldn't have them.|`|OGBP5umTaa	the are only for mommy, but they are a secret.<br>  then change the subject|`|Cz6DDI6laa	tell her it is for Mommy's who have really bad stomach aces
ZbnxGIsnaa	Gosh dear!!!  I am so sorry!!  *huggles*  Well, the only thing I can help you with is you should ONLY be taking Tylenol.  Anything other then tylenol is not good for your baby's growth, but if your OB says it's okay then it must be okay for you to take because they wouldn't prescribe anything to you unless it was fine!

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It all depends on the baby. No one can really say - the doctors and nurses will have to assess his condition when he is born. Some babies do well early on, some not as well, so there's no telling. <br>  <br>  Hope everything turns out okay.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Probably a couple weeks. Because usually at 35 weeks they go home with the mom.|`|ELmRq1zJaa	Congrats on your baby.  I do hope that they are getting healthier each day.  My girls were born at 37 weeks which is premautre but just a little.  They didn't have to stay late or even go into the NICU so it does not really matter on the age of your child as to when they get to come home.  The nurses ad doctors did tell me before they were born that what would determine their hospital stay was how well they were able to regulate their own bodies.  Mostly things like can they maintain a safe temperature, are they eating (even if your child has feeding tube they can go home so do'nt let that get you too worried) as long as they were peeing and pooping they were ok, and finally I'm sure that being able to breath on their own is also a biggie.  Some other things they will keep an eye on is their liver function which is measure by if or how bad the jaundice may be.  My advice to you is to start pumping your breast milk early even if you baby is not able to nurse you can still give it breast millk through the tube and this will really help your baby.  Good luck. and remeber to ask yourself this, while you are eager to have your little one at home would you rather have them home knowing they are heathly or have them home too early and still ahve worries??  Best of luck|`|qImMwhUHaa	32 weeks is considered premature. It depends on the condition of the child, how much he/she weighs, if the child can eat or has to have an IV and whether the lungs are fully developed or not. I would estimate around 5 weeks in the hospital could be more or could be less.|`|T9fek24eaa	Usually preemies stay until about their due date (or close to when they would have been considered full term.) Not all babies stay in incubators either.
vlMd2vHxaa	First off congrats on  your twins and bravo for breastfeeding two! How old are your girls? I have twin girls that are 5 months old and I'm exclusively breastfeeding them. It is definitely hard to breastfeed two babies at once. These are my only babies though so I've never done it any other way. It took a long time to figure out the logistics of feeding two. For me I found it works best to feed them separately during nighttime and the first morning feeding and then together the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  My girls were very close to needing supplementation at the very beginning. I simply refused to do it. Once you start supplementing it is hard to get back to exclusively breastfeeding because your milk supply is determined by how much the babies demand. If they are getting food from somewhere else they won't demand as much from you. If you are already supplementing don't worry many people do it successfully while continuing to breastfeed. It is possible to cut out supplementing as well but you have to work hard and be willing to nurse frequently to build up you supply for a few days/weeks before everything calms down. <br>  <br>  The hardest part for me was no one ever told me that newborn babies usually eat once every two hours! Everyone I know with a baby gave them formula so they would go 4+ hours between feedings. I thought breastfeeding would work the same way. Boy was I wrong. I was glued to my couch with a boppy pillow for probably the first 6 weeks or so. Then I got the hang of tandem feeding and would have a little more time without one or both hanging from me.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding was very challenging for me in the beginning and I wanted to give up so many times. Having two and being their only source of food is very difficult. I hardly slept and considered giving up breastfeeding that way someone else could feed them and I could sleep. The best thing I did was just believe that I could get through it and give myself no other choice but to keep going.<br>  <br>  For my girls I only feed them on one breast each per feeding. So I will start Twin A on my left breast and have Twin B on the right. Then at the next feeding I will switch sides. I found this to be the easier way, but what works for everyone is different. It's easy to keep track though with a safety pin in your nursing bra or a bracelet on your wrist that you can switch sides for each feeding.<br>  <br>  I would try tandem feeding them if you feel it will work for you. It was impossible in the beginning but I slowly worked at it until I was successful at doing it. I have a ez2 nurse twins pillow and it's great! I use a boppy to set one baby in while I get the first onto the pillow then I grab the second one from the boppy latch everyone on and we are good to go. Experiment to see what works best for you and keep it up!<br>  <br>  I found it really hard to talk to anyone about breastfeeding twins because I've never met anyone else that's done it! I feel like I would have been better off if I had asked more questions and looked for more help. Best of luck to you!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I've known women to breastfeed twins until around 1 year without supplementing. You have to give your body a chance and rotate babies with the boobs in case one has a stronger suck or eats more
FXPglziDaa	Yes it can be, but it really all depends if you have had sex lately. When you have sex and a baby starts to be made in your "tummy" it needs food too. So when you eat, most of the food goes to the baby. But if you havent had sex lately I wouldnt worry to much about it. It is probly just a sign of somthing going on in your stomach that is unusual. If I were you I would take a pregnency test and if it turns out negative contact a doctor. If he says nothings wrong then just go along with daily routines and when you are hungry eat!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It could be but usually that symptom comes up when you are further along and would know by now if you were pregnant...the only thing to do is take a test to find out.|`|Ga0XjgV1aa	it's digesting quick|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Yes, it is a sign of pregnancy.  Why not trying the Clear Blue Easy Digital test!  It's brilliant!!!  =)<br>  <br>  Not sure if you have already missed your period or not, but if you've already missed it or are going to miss it.  Try taking a test.  Best of luck to you!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Sounds like tape worms....

LDYAGJCxaa	It's not really considered normal for most women, but yes, it's definitely possible.  I would trust the ovulation test more than the computer.  The website can only offer a prediction based on the numbers you give them, the ovulation tests will actually tell you your hormones are rising.<br>  <br>  On another note, some women get positive ovulation tests when they are pregnant.  It's possible you ovulated at your normal time and are now pregnant.  Have you taken a test yet?  Good luck!  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  If it turns out that you're not pregnant, then next cycle start using the ovulation tests the day after your period ends.  Just be sure to not use the 1st morning urine, it's too concentrated.|`|Wzws8v8daa	women ovulate anywhere from 12 to 16 days before their period.  once you ovulate, it "triggers" your period to come on about 2 weeks later.|`|weBOR9YCaa	I am not going to say that it isn't likely, but typically ovulation occurs in the middle of your cycle. In terms of the opk tests, the test line should be the same color or darker than the test line.|`|T9fek24eaa	If you are ovulating 1 week before your period there is something wrong. After ovulation occurs you have what is called a luteal phase and that should be roughly 2 weeks (14 days) give or take a few days. This is where if there is a fertilized egg it will implant and your body will start making progesterone to retain the pregnancy or after 14 days you will start your period. It can be any where from about 12 to 16 days an still be with in the normal range. <br>  <br>  I would wait and see if you are pregnant or not, then if you are not, start taking OPK's a few days after your period stops (around 9 to 10 days after the first day of your last period.) The lines need to be the same shade in order for it to be positive. For me I could never tell if they were the same or not, so I decided to get the digital ones with the smiley face. They are more expensive but it was worth it just to know when I was ovulating with out a doubt. Anyways track your cycles. If it turns out you are indeed ovulating 1 week before your period start then I would consider going and talking to my ob/gyn about it, because that points to a luteal phase defect (which is not usually a big deal and can be easily treated.)|`|WnlzScIyaa	In order for an OPK to be positive, the test line has to be darker or atleast the same color as the control line. It is possible to ovulate a week before your period, but rare. If you do ovulate this way then your luteal phase may be too short and you would have problems concieving.  <br>  Try taking fertile aid, it is a vitamin that has help wome conceive, and helps to regulate you. I took it for one month, I didn't get pregnant but it did make that cycle normal. I just haven't bought anymore yet I am waiting on a Doc. Appt. Also if you haven't been for a check up yet I would go, it helps ease your mind. Good luck!

ruE0C2Awaa	The 18 year old guy seems all wrong for you, he drugged you? He made you have sex with him? I think that it would be healthier if you dumped him. If you really like the 15 year old then you should go out with him, but I think that you should tell him that you want to wait a little while to have sex with him. You are on the younger side, but I don't really think that any age is "too young" You probably would have enjoyed the experience more if you waited. But what's done is done. I hope that helped.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	Uhm, if you didn't want sex and he forced you, it's called RAPE. You really need to go to the police. He's forcing you to use drugs and have sex; that isn't love, that isn't a relationship.! If you leave him, who knows what he might try to do to get back at you. He'll start raping and forcing drugs into other girls.! You really need help.|`|s2JvJ5alaa	You're too young.<br>  You're gonna get into too much.<br>  And you can't just have sex with someone because they want you to. That's when people start calling you a ****.|`|MtzJYAOsaa	You're way too young, this is so stupid! What's wrong with that 18 year old? He should be dating people his own age! And you shouldn't be having sex! God. It's your life though. Have fun with the kids!|`|KCkhjjsLaa	umm, hello! Yes you are too young! Think of it this way, you had the rest of your life to start having sex. And now you're sleeping with an 18 year old (which is an OLDER MAN) and using drugs? Actually, he's an adult, so your sleeping with him is illegal. You hear that? It's againest the law.<br>  So, my answer. Dump him. Date the 15 year old if you want to. But don't do it only for the sex.|`|iyEYXiq8aa	You are way too young, you shouldn't go out with someone just for sex. Which one do you prefer because this 18 year old sounds like he's using you. I'd also talk to your parents about what happened.|`|64N7oxabaa	Your boyfriend is a very lucky boy, Cause if you were my daughter I would have quite happily have KILLED him for that. have a talk with your parents.<br>  Yeah you'll loose it sooner or later, But that was not the way to loose it.

My son who is almost 3 hates mascots and clowns but my daughter loves them.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	I know a lot of little kids who are scared of those people in costumes lol. My friend played a snowman one year for a christmas thing at a primary school, the majority of kids were crying. One little girl's father asked if she could please see my friend take off his snowman head and show her that he was just a person in a costume. Once he did she wasn't afraid anymore. I think it's pretty normal for kids to be scared of these  kid of things!|`|mrjqc63caa	I guess it's normal thing. <br>  I shriek in fear whenever I see both clowns and mascots and yet I'm 15 years old. I also know adults with the same problem. My problem is that I'm a very cautious person and I have no idea who's in the costume and I don't know what they're going to do and I FREK OUT!!! <br>  <br>  For clowns I have no idea why I'm so afraid of them. They just creep me out. The other day we were driving by Blockbuster and there was aclown in front of the building (looked like Ronald McDonalds) and I screamed and I hid myself from the clown. <br>  <br>  I'm not scared of loud noises though.

Most states, the age of consent is 16, but there are some where it is 17 and 18.  Also, you are allowed to move out legally at 17 years old in SC, but can also be charged as an adult at that age for crimes you may commit.  It is hard to move out before 18 though if you're trying to get your own place together b/c most apartment communities require you to be 18 to sign a lease.|`|BJERgbM5aa	In the eyes of the law, your are not an adult until you are 18 years of age.  Until that age, your rights are pretty much limited.  Unless there exists a circumstance in the home wherein your well-being is threatened.  Like mental or physical abuse.  But even if that were true, the state would place you in custody of an appropriate welfare program.  you best course of action is to wait until you're 18 to do your thing.  If you love him and he really loves you too, then you can wait for each other.  A good test of love.

rnOJn2UCaa	mmmm tricky, yet believe me it could still be simple. the tricky bit is if it is a medical. If so your doctor or plunket nurse will know more. However, this all may have started through her dislike of the work involved in chewing or a initial dislike of texture, (very normal reaction at first) and it could still be that... on the other hand this could be a reinforced response due to the amount of attention she is gaining....that meaning, how much delight you r litlte bundle is getting every time she refuses to eat the food you would like her to by the fun games you are playing . Ask your self this if i give her a choclate biscuit will she suck on it or eat it? Yes ?then its not the texture. Next think if she chews any food at all be it a treat or not, what does she do? Does she spit the less desirable food out faster than the desirable? Yes? then you may have a case of lazy chewing (very normal). Answers ... If texture slowly change, even give her a mouth full of changed more textured food followed by one of her normal. If chewing try to ease her in to it by introducing food that requires less chewing  and gradually build up, banana,s etc (tiny pieces if ness> All else fails? reinforce her on any eating behaviours ignore the rest...do not full in to the trap off fulling her up on a bottle.

7YDeavwnaa	Dear Friend<br>  Basically there is no total cure for any disease in alopathy ( english medicine ) its all only to try and maintine for periods.example bruphine tablet is made up of tar which is used for the road. This tablet goes to the main pain vein and blocks the feel of pain.So suddenly the pain surprise. Second ask a doctor to give a letter that the disease will be cure with certain periods.In english medicines there no cure for even headache or fever.Avoid this treatment first.<br>  Tipi's: =HOMOEOPATHY , Biochemic Combination No 6 is useful.<br>  Natural Takes a long period.how long u are attacked by cold the same<br>  time will take to cure If You are willing to take here is a tipi's:= You can get a powder name ( AADAATHODA ) IN AYURVEDIC SHOPS. You Just blend the half spoon of powder with pure honey and take twice a day morning in empty stomach and night after dinner one hour late.

People who use it regularly(!) for a whole year(!!) with no withdrawals - 3 out of 1000 will end up pregnant.<br>  Millions of couples rely on the pill and nothing else, and they are fine.<br>  Add to this the fact that you used a condom, did not leave any load behind, etc...<br>  The odds that she's pregnant are so infinitesimally small.- why even ask?<br>  If she's that paranoid about getting pregnant, it's probably the stress that is messing up her body. Stress can mess up periods, among other causes.<br>  Tell her to relax.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	ok.... so why has she not taken a pregnancy test? there only ￡1-￡5 you know|`|sPWzvWehaa	Don't freak out. I'm sure you'll be a great dad.|`|4VR1pjCzaa	You need to relax! <br>  The chances are extreamly extreamly small of her getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  Her changing period, is most likely due to the birth control, and maybe even sex. When i lost my virginity i skipped and my cycle changed days.<br>  <br>  & its completly normal for it to change, and most of the time after losing it, your period will get alot more severe, so all these symptoms shes worrying about, probably really aren't aything but paranoia.<br>  <br>  Its always a good idea to double check, get a pregnancy test, but i highly doubt that she is expecting anytime soon.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	It's hard to say without knowing how old she is, but for many women, periods are not regular.  Stress or extreme exercise can make for a late or missed period.  Even if they come on the same day every month, some months it could be lighter, other days it could be heavy.  Yaaaaaay hormones.<br>  <br>  (If she's like in her 40's, it could be menopause starting.  Yay.  Hormones.)<br>  <br>  A light period does not signify 'getting ready to get pregnant'.  It simply means she had a light period.  If she is preg., she won't have one for many months.  At all.  If it bothers you, bring it up to her.  Her other symptoms could be caused by a number of things, which she should probably get checked by her doctor anyway. <br>  <br>  Going by what you said about using safety measures, it seems unlikely that she is pregnant.  But it's not impossible.  Just suggest that she take a test if you want to put your mind at ease.
hl5WdXnbaa	The fact that he butted in and reminded you to say "please and thank you" was rude of him even if he was a parent himself.  MOST of us parents are constantly telling our kids something.. "sit down, eat your dinner, tie your shoes, put down the cat" and do not say "please and thank you every time. Especially if you have been telling you child the same thing over and over again and you are fed up with the not listening.<br>    As far as your daughter falling, again most of us parents have been there. My son was running around the house on thursday like a nut. I asked him a billions times to slow down and never run in the house ( and yes I said please and thank you many times before...and sometimes not). Well he whacked his for head into the counter as he ran by. Of course I felt bad, I gave him kisses and such, but I also used it as a lesson on why not to run. I felt bad,  but now when I see him run I tell him "whack your head again and it's your own fault mister!"  So of course you feel bad, but when you have told your kid over and over to tie her shoes you hope that her accident teaches her something  because next time it could be worse ( like crossing in a street in front of traffic)<br>  <br>  I have no problem listening to childless friends, but yes sometimes they honestly have no clue. What sounds go in theory does not always work in real life. I have a degree in child studies and thought I had it all figured out.... then I had kids and burned my books.lol|`|113FoyMFaa	Yes, I hate that too.<br>  <br>  I even hate it when people come in here and say "well, my nephew was like this", or "this kid I babysit did that".  and they try and give you advise.|`|WI8qeyJmaa	or maybe you're over-sensitive and stressing<br>  <br>  sometimes it's good to listen to others ideas since they might be more objective|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I have loads of friends unmarried and no kids. And they are forever telling me when I tell my daughter off, I am being to hard on her. A direct quote is "Why don't you just let her live!|`|AA11189849	If your guy friend said "Please and Thank You" to YOU, that is rude. Just rude.  I'd have replied, "please mind your own business, THANK YOU." what a prick.<br>  Tell him to get a vasectomy and shut up.  He's rude.  Chances are he has no manners and likes to judge others, right?  And he doesn't have a girlfriend based on his manners (or lack thereof)   Just reply, "Oh thank you Mr. Expert."<br>  <br>  Just say, "When you have kids you will understand... then you will see."  I used to be like that, thinking, "She's not a good parent..." then I had a kid and NOW I see how ignorant I was.<br>  Yeah...|`|J1kJb98Maa	hmmm sorry but i am not getting why you dont just double bow her shoes so the dont come undone so easily?<br>  and velcro forever or for how long she needs so you baby girl does not get hurt?<br>  sorry but i am not getting your point at all<br>  arent mom's supposed to protect their children and i dont think making it so your child doesnt fall down and hurt their chins as over protecting<br>  maybe you need to take a step back and do some owning up|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i think however you want to parent your kids (ie. not doing up her lace up shoes for her) is perfectly fine.  and that guy was obviously out of place.  however i feel a little differently about the childless giving advice.  i don't have any children, i am 20 yrs old. however i have 2 years of education in child development, and have worked as a nanny for over a year.  i do consider myself to be knowledgeable.  many of my friends have young children or babies, and have really no clue about anything to do with development so they call me, or ask me questions for general information.  i give advice if i see an area that could use it.  but i do my very best to be polite, and only give it where i feel it's wanted, or extremely needed.    at work i have been asked for advice regarding many issues, (ie potty training) and i feel this is an example of something that a parent could take offence if i suggested they try something new, but because of the advice i gave, my boss tried it and it worked and she is thankful.   i have never felt like people won't accept what i have to say just because i don't have children, but i also strive to do it in a way that doesn't make the parent feel like a bad person, or that i'm undermining them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I agree with you at that age she should be tying her own shoes so that she isn't tripping on them, I'm shure that you are still worried about her when she gets hurt, like a good mother is, but reminding her to tie her shoes is far better than buying her velcro! Take what this guy is saying with a grain of salt! You know that you are a good mom, nothing else matters. Ignore the rantings of fools! LOL.<br>  As for your question, I actually had friends that would call me to ask me what to do about fevers, and other things before I even had kids...because my friends knew that i'd been helping to raise kids since i was about 11 years old.|`|bZZAYIv6aa	Only take advice from people who are where you want to be. Sometimes I respond with that, people that don't know me, they just change the subject, my friends, usually understand.|`|X8b2zP2vaa	It drives me crazy! But just brush it off and ignore it and parent like you think you should. Anyway, don't get mad at him, just think in your mind you know way more than him and he knows nothing!|`|5RK2PBRraa	Ignore it. they dont know what they are talking bout! Ur girl has to become strong and a good citizen being pampered isn't gonna cut  it. Great Parenting!|`|Urs6AQQvaa	Every parent has their own ways in raising their children whethor it be postive or negative... You didn't do anything wrong by telling her to tie her shoes and forgetting to say thankyou for it... I doubt she even would have caught that anyway. Don't let other adults tell you on how to raise your kids because you are the adult, you carried the kid for nine months you should be Lord and Emporer over them lol Anyways tell them exactly how you feel and don't let some MAN tell you how to raise your daughter unless it's your husband...anyways goodluck =]|`|jwGkGaiCaa	Honestly, just brush it off, it really sounds like with the whole Velcro thing that he doesn't even know what he's talking about. And with the snide tone it just sounds like he's annoyed at your child for tripping. I do like advice from people who don't have kids, as long as its useful and they have some child experience (babysitting, childcare, something...)<br>  <br>  Velcro maybe convenient sometimes but it is usually just better to double knot the shoe laces. I think any kid over say 3-5 shouldn't need Velcro. But that's my opinion|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I kind of think you both are wrong about it, but yes I have friends who don't have kids, but they also don't give me advice on how to raise my daughter. My husband and I are doing a great job.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I agree with you 100 percent on this. People who have never raised kids have no idea what their talking about.|`|1s3nddaYaa	yea i feel ya.  when my son was born a friend said i wasnt supporting his head very well. i was supporting his head, im not sure how i was doing it wrong in her eyes. i would let my son do it himself as well. you cant do everything for them or they wont learn themselves.  im sure there are more times people have told me to do something with my son. well yesterday at golden carrol or however it is spelled, and older woman said that it was to cold for my son to be wearing what he was wearing. it was just overall shorts and a shirt that came with it. it was 65 degrees yesterday lol. my son is hot natured as it is.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, because sometimes it's great to hear others' points of views.<br>  For example, in this case, the guy was right - she should have learned to tie her shoes properly at 5, in K.<br>  It's not that you did anything 'wrong', and I don't think he was inferring you were a bad mom - you are putting that on yourself.<br>  Be confident in your own parenting - but don't shut others out!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	OK there are two issues here One what the guy said to you : That I find completely inappropriate. Not only does he not have children to know what parenting is like to be able to give advise,but he was rude about it. Even if he did have children to each their own!! Or he REALLY felt like he needed to give you advise he could have said it ina  different way and tone. I've found myself not saying please and thank you to my kids at times as well, but mainly when I've asked them to get their shoes on to go outside for the 5th time!! LOL<br>  <br>  Now Second is the issue about your 6 1/2 yr old girl who is learning to tie her shoes... I think it is age appropriate the learning to tie her shoes, though not many kids her age already do. As for falling and hurting her chin for not tying her shoes.. maybe she's fining it too hard to tie them and that's why she's not doing it?? You say you tell her a million times a day to tie her shoes.. so Im wondering whether even after falling and opening her chin she's still not doing it...just a thought|`|jIk2ttH1aa	He was rude and way out of line with correcting you with a " please and thank you."<br>  And you are rude and way out of line for basically saying "ha, ha told ya so" when your daughter fell and got hurt in the garage by "hitting her chin REALLY HARD."<br>  <br>  So, I hardly think you have to worry about your being "overly sensitive."<br>  <br>  That kind of injury on the chin is so dangerous on so many levels, and giving her a hug and kiss and comforting her is part of the job as a Mom.<br>  <br>  I know MANY 1st graders that can't tie their shoes.  Relax with your child.  And don't hang out with losers that are going to give you unsolicited advice.  (you solicited this advice).
x3fQP9viaa	I'm thinking just like a bottle she is sucking on her thumb it's the only way she knows how to make herself swallow.  She is associating thumbsucking with the ability to swallow.  She's just a baby.|`|foJm2Yftaa	Its normal. They all have unique personalities. I used to carry my pillow around everywhere I go when I was a kid. When I fall I throw my pillow down and I always fall no it. XD Your baby will be ok. Mine does it too! Good Luck! &Lol&|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	It probably helps her swallow.  If you insist on not letting her, she'll want to do it all the more.  She'll grow out of it.|`|K6KHL9lNaa	It doesn't sound like anything to worry about, they all grow out of stuff like that, don't worry!!! =]|`|MlLXYGXAaa	its probley to sweet for her get some thing with almost zero sugar in it she sucks her thumb because she may like the cereal but doesn't like to taste of the sugar contence i think she may be sugar sensitive witch is where you can taste sugar even if its only a little bit also try giving her a drink of juice in between each mouth full then she will get in to the habit of this Rather than her thumb but other wise i think she may grow out of it x|`|g4KHXYFPaa	She'll eventually get tired of sucking her thumb and stop doing it.  I think I was 4 or 5.  I remember the night I stopped.  Most people can't remember that.  I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore.  I was getting ready for bed, stuck my thumb in my mouth, and thought,"I don't want to do this anymore", and stopped.|`|1VdQbx3xaa	she,ll outgrow!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	My son has been doing this ever since he was 5 months old when we first introduced rice cereal to him. After every bite he sticks his thumb in his mouth I think it helps him swallow it Im not sure why he does it though but Im not to worried about it. Now he is 7 months old and still continues to do it but with his fruits and vegetables LOL.
giKCTfnfaa	oh my.  i really feel for ya.  if i knew you, i'd be there for you!  i've been in your shoes.  it's tough.  my ex left me for another chick when i was 8 months pregnant with my youngest.  no, i didn't want him in the room.  i didn't even call him until after my son was born.  i knew it would end up in some sort of confrontation. <br>  <br>  my advice...<br>  i can see both sides into letting him be there when your daughter is born.  perhaps he's scared right now and watching you give birth to his daughter will get his head out of his butt.  BUT if it is going to stress you out by him being in there, by all means, tell him he has to wait in the waiting room with everyone else. you need someone in the room with you who will be there for you physically and emotionally.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Well you're just going to have to tell him that you don't want him there, he shouldn't have such high expectations.<br>  <br>  The last person i want there is my ex, i would rather be alone than have him there. <br>  <br>  He expected to be there too, he thought it was his given right, i told him straight that he was NOT going to be there, he could wait in the waiting room but that's all. <br>  <br>  Tell your ex the same, he has no right to be there, it's upto the mother who she feels comfortable with, it needs to be someone you trust and can rely on.|`|KmC0K59taa	If you don't want him in there, then don't.  Child birth is the most difficult thing you will ever do, emotionally and physically.  Have some support ppl in there that you love and trust - your mom, sister, best friend, etc.  You do not need the distraction of him in the room.  You want your delivery to go as smooth and easy as possible.  If you are tense and unhappy, you will have a more difficult time.|`|x3fQP9viaa	You choose who is in the room.  Don't make it stressful, own your decision.  The best part you don't have to say anything to him, the nurses will do it for you.|`|AA10953561	Ouch! What a jerk. It's good that he wants to be in  your daughter's life, but his timing is awful! Is he still be supportive of you and trying to be good to you even though you're not together? I'd see how the next few weeks go and if it seems like he's just not there for your then I wouldn't have him in the delivery room. Having a baby is hard work and if he isn't going to try to help you through it then he doesn't need to be there.<br>  <br>  Have someone you know you can trust in the delivery room with you. Someone who will rub your back and feet, someone who will remind you to breathe, and be there for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|AA12192295	If he was trying to keep you from stressing out, why did he tell you he is going to leave you? He sounds like a total jerk and you don't need that stress while you are trying to bring your child into the world. If you feel like it will bring on emotions that you wont be able to handle at the time or that you don't want to handle, then you don't need him in there. He can wait in the waiting room.|`|AA11348933	If you don't want him there tell the nurses and they will kick him out.  Have your mom or a sister or good friend there instead. <br>  <br>  He sounds like a real winner (sarcasm).  I'd leave him now.  You're better off without him.  He says that he wants to spare you the stress until after the baby is born, but your emotions will be much more "fragile" after the baby is born.  Better to get him out of the house now.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Oh god sweetheart I'm so sorry for you. What a prick can't believe he thinks "preparing you" for him leaving you wouldn't be incredibly stressful...ugh well its completely your choice whether or not to have him in the room. If I were in your situation, I wouldn't want my ex there. Its already gonna be tough, why make it harder on yourself. Anyways I hope you're doing alright, things will get better xxx|`|R9H1IgoBaa	That's a horrible situation to be in when you're pregnant i'm so sorry to hear about it. If you do not want him in there you do not have to have him in there, what kind of man say's hey i'm leaving you but not until after the baby hope you understand. God some dudes just make me so angry. I would not let my ex in a room with me and if my husband were to leave me right now i would not let him in, it would break my heart to have him there. This is a tough decision but you need to do what is best for you and your state of mind not what he wants. I wish you the best of luck.|`|WnlzScIyaa	You know what, I think you should do what ever you want. How stupid is he, to tell you he is going to leave you, but just not right this second? That's the same thing, he is an idiot. You go and talk to your doctor and tell him that you wan't to be in the delivery room without him, so that you can focus on you and your baby. You do not need anything there that might cause complications. Or if anything, don't let him in untill right when your baby is coming out. Don't let him see you through the whole labor process if you don't want him there. Good luck!|`|mGTjFgCwaa	If you don't want him there, he doesn't have to be, and they will keep him out.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I wouldn't let him in. I would much rather have the love and support of my mother or best friend than someone who will leave me when it's over. If he will use an excuse like the fact that you are "too different" to leave you, when he still wants to have the best of both worlds, he's using you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let him in. Ask your mother or best friend to be your coach instead. It will be better for you, I think.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No- when I had broken up with my then boyfriend he was not in the delivery room and everything turned out fine.  (We were actually married two weeks later! Long story.) .  Don't let him be there- it will cause you stress that you don't need.  Just because he is the father does not give him the right to be there.  He can see the baby afterward.  That is what he deserves for leaving you.  He can see the baby plenty after he/she is born.

[:|`|ELmRq1zJaa	That's actually pretty expensive in my book when you can find coupons in most baby maganzine to just to to Sears of JC Pennys and get some really good deals.  It's nice that you got all the pictures but it would have been nicer if they actually made you some prints.  Are they copy writted cause then sometimes places like walgreens and walmart won't reprint them for you so now you still won't get any good prints.|`|db0NnEjGaa	OMG! SHE IS TOO CUTE! TOTALLY WORTH IT!! I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PICTURE OR IF ITS JUST HER BEAUTY! SHE ADORABLE!!!|`|MlLXYGXAaa	yerh thats a good deal i love the second picture its so cute x|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Sounds like a good deal to me.  Especially if she came to your home.

What a beautiful baby you have!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I just looked at these in another question.  They are adorable!<br>  <br>  It is a really good deal!

DDYwnut6aa	Not everyone with a perfect 28 day cycle ovulates on day 14.  That's ridiculous.  Our bodies work the way they work, NOT by a calendar.  A 'normal' luteal phase (time between ovulation and your period) can range from 10 to 16 days, so you may have ovulated anywhere from cycle day 12 to cycle day 18.

For example, Clomid has also been prescribed for men because it increases sperm count. Talk to your doctor about your options.|`|3MDY29gnaa	There are vitamins out there.

rHufcHwHaa	I agree with you completely.  I think a lot of it stems from the new attitude that everyone is unique and special and deserves whatever they want.  In public schools, there are no winners and no losers--everyone is a winner! It's alright for self esteem, but it's unrealistic in the real world because not everyone is a winner, and not everyone gets exactly what they want all the time.  Kids just haven't learned what 'no' means from anyone outside of good parents--just think about how often people are sued for discrimination.  It's a sad world when people are afraid to just put kids in their place and let them learn a few tough lessons.  (And by the way, you sound like a great parent.  All of those things are most definitely privileges that need to be earned.)|`|pJeFpC7qaa	Well I'm not going to disagree with you<br>  we are like that. but you ranting on about it wont change it<br>  <br>  We're teenagers in 2009 not 1980<br>  Whenever we're teenagers (not yet adults) we're going to want the things we want, and do the things we want to do whether you as a parent like it or not. Now I'm not saying that all teenagers don't listen to their parents, because I can't even lie to my mom about the tiniest thing, but teenagers will be teenagers.<br>  <br>  Of course we're going to be mad when we get our phone etc taken away, do you expect us to be all happy go lucky? For a lot of teenagers they text/talk on that thing as must as possible. Therefore we're going to be pissed when you take it away|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Every one is like that, they want to get their way all the time, adults do it too, but the only difference is adults actually get paid to do their job, so they can just go out and buy it, no problem, where as teenagers have no money of their own, so need their parents to provide it for them. Why do parents seem to think they should spend as little as possible on their child?<br>  <br>  Why exactly is it any of your business if she gets a piercing, how does it effect you in anyway, sounds you want some one to power trip on. If I stole your computer and phone you wouldn't be annoyed by that?|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Right on!<br>  Honestly though, it's not the kids fault they think like this. It's the parents.<br>  My kids know that they have to earn things, and some stuff is strictly off limits. If they want a cell, they have to be able to pay for it themselves. (I just got one 6 months ago, my 12 year old does not need one) <br>  Same with car, computer etc. We have a computer for the family and they are more than welcome to use that. <br>  Once they are responsible enough, and can pay for things like that themselves, all the power to them. I don't care what their friends have given to them. You earn things in this world. At 30 no ones handing me what I want.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I totally agree with you and it's time for parents to drop a pair and begin to parent again.  As far as the response by Payton, I can tell she had no active discipline as a child and thus she feels she can do whatever she pleases now.  If she were my kid I would have whooped her butt.  And for all the parents that think spanking is child abuse.  The attitude we are discussing now about teens is a direct result of that thinking.  <br>  There is no excuse for this, and a time line is not a valid reason for obstinence, disobedience, irresponsibility and rudeness.  The whole argument "this is 2009 not 1980" doesn't cut it.  Rude is rude, rebellion is rebellion and it should not be tolerated!|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i agree with you and i am a teenager.|`|tvcgFkgyaa	i agree. i hate going to some of my classes at school becouse i have to listen to kids who wine and complain that they dont get what they want when they want it. its so annoying!
96da11aae7f924df570161a9d700912caa	Well im around the same age of ur cousin, and i was kinda doing the same stuff ( not the boyfriend part) anyways..i think wat she needs its u to ignore her, to make see wat if feels like to be alone. Like u n her, im pretty close to my older cousin and when i started doing all this stupid stuff she was doing the same as u, she tried to help and make me see that wat i was doing was wrong..i always like yea im going to change..one day she found out i was sneaking out to smoke and she didn't answer her phone for 2 weeks..she talked to my dad but not me, same with my dad..the last words i heard was " no tv,no friends,no Computer and next time im calling a Social worker" and he never talk to me for like a month not even hi..he never hit me or nothing..so i think ur Cousin's mom n dad should think about that...since a slap in ur face my hurt today but tomorrow u will forget, but words n the feeling of being alone its worse..try to talk to her..ask her y is she doing this and give her a lil of understanding, we girls this day do stupid stuff either to get attention or to "fit" in our generation|`|47E10snbaa	honestly, I dont think theres anything else you could do... you have to teach a kid discipline at a young age not at 17/18
nISYAHkfaa	Nightmares are a really common complaint in pregnancy (I always have them bad), as are cramps. I wouldn't be alarmed unless the cramps last a long time (we're talking prolonged/nonstop over days here) or are of unusual severity, or they are accompanied by HEAVY bleeding (since light bleeding is also common in pregnancy) or light bleeding that lasts over several days. Another cause for concern is if you suddenly lose all pregnancy symptoms that you had been having. If any of these happen, see your caregiver right away.<br>  <br>  Either way, your baby is most likely fine right now. You haven't said anything that sounds like a cause for alarm. =) If you're unsure, you can call your doctor and ask him/her if there is cause for concern.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Awww!!!

s8VgyzE2aa	using the high chair as punishment is a bad idea because that is where they eat, so you don't want them to associate going into the highchair as punishment or it could cause meal time problems. <br>  <br>  I also don't agree with facing the wall, that is what I consider degrading and humiliating as if they aren't good enough to look at you. It's really a bad idea to make a child face the wall during a time out. <br>  <br>  Other than that I think time out is a good form of discipline as long as at the end of the time out you remind the child why they were in time out "you needed to sit because you kept opening the door, NO opening the door" and as they get older you should also require an apology for not listening. <br>  <br>  Time out should be given in a regular chair. I realize your twins are young but they are certainly old enough to sit in a chair even if you get a child size chair specifically for time out it's better than using the high chair or crib which are for eating and sleeping and should not be associated with punishment at that age. If they get up from the chair you continue to put them back, that is how they learn to stay and take the time out. You should also use a timer so they can clearly see that each time they get up you reset the timer. If you use a highchair now then when they are older and not using high chairs anymore you will have to teach them to stay then, so it's better to do it while they are young.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think redirection should always be tried first at that age, also they should get a warning before the time out. Punishment should be a last resort after trying other creative methods to deter them from the wrong doing.<br>  <br>  Time out for them should NOT last more than 2 minutes, I would personally do 1 1/2 minutes until they are two years old. (one minute per year of age) I can't believe someone suggested 5 minutes in a corner for a 21 month old. Shows how ignorant people are about this sort of thing...scary|`|KICQQxLxaa	The only negative I can think of is that she may associate her highchair with time-out, and not want to sit there to eat.  Kind  of the same way that you shouldn't use the crib for time-out.|`|x3fQP9viaa	You made a decision for them, stick with it.  They may even figure out the safety knob when you get it, a latch installed higher up may be a better solution or peace of mind.  I cannot think why the highchair is bad, other than they may start associating that with being in trouble verses mealtime, but doubt it.|`|ETsUQa0kaa	I think the highchair is a bad place for time-out because this is where they are supposed to eat, and it could cause severe meal time (or any other eating time) problems. Here are some FAQs & answers about time-out.<br>  <br>  How Long? A good rule of thumb for time-outs is to make the time equal in minutes to a child's age. Thus, a 5 year old would receive a 5 minute time out. When time outs carry on for too long, the child becomes restless, frustrated, and often forgets why he is in time-out to begin with. This can lead to a cycle of continued negative behavior. It often helps young children to set a timer, so that they have a visual aide to help them understand how long they should stay in time out.<br>  <br>  Where? It is key to have one designated spot for time-outs. Children crave routine, so knowing that time out will occur at the same place, for the same amount of time, each time, is actually comforting to children. A good time-out spot would be an area of the room that is away from a lot of activity and free from distractions for the child. Designating a chair, mat, or carpet square will help to define the time out spot and keep the child from wandering. Set the child up for success and do not surround him/her with things to get into. Some children may benefit from putting their heads down while in time-out.<br>  <br>  Don't Give In! Children may often resist time out and respond with tears, screaming, pleading, negotiating, and other negative behaviors. Do not give in! Do not let yourself get pulled into an argument, debate, or negotiation with a child. Remember that you are the authority figure and the child must abide by the rules you have stated. Calmly direct the child to time out and then walk away. If the child leaves time out, physically assist him to the spot again and walk away. Repeat this until the child stays in time out for the desired amount of time. If the child is resistant or you feel uncomfortable physically moving the child, ask an administrator for his/her support and assistance.<br>  <br>  Remember that time outs exist to correct negative behavior and help a child acheive desired behavior. Use them only when needed and be clear with your expectations. If you are clear and consistent with your time outs, many children will not continue to need them after they understand you will follow through with your expectations. For those that do, it will be a time where they can modify behavior and come back to the group.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped, <br>  Mackenzie|`|IwvszgPdaa	it sounds like you did a good thing. dont beat yourself up about using a timeout tecnique.... needs must.<br>  redirecting is good too but theres only so much you can do and with 2 other children you must be run ragged.<br>  and you are of course thinking of her safety.<br>  the only thing i can think of as to why its not such a good idea to put her in her highchair is just thats where she has her meals and she might get upset when its meal time.<br>  instead you could try a quiet corner away from distractions. if youve ever watched supernanny she suggests timeout lasts for a minute per year of age i.e age 1 = 1 minute, age 2 = 2 minutes etc....<br>  it might take a little while for her to actually sit still (which is probably why you put her in highchair) but you have to persist and the timeout starts again from when you put her back in the corner. after timeout, explain again the reason and she must apologise. this method does work. but it sounds like you are already doing a great job.<br>  good luck|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I really wouldn't use her high chair. Time out should be a place just associated with time out I feel. Other wise it might confuse her when you put her in the highchair now. <br>  <br>  Btw. At the end of time out, you did right to explain to her what she did was wrong. And then if she can, I guess get her to apologize. But it seems you raised your  voice again to make your message clear. I don't feel that you should be doing that. When you take them out of time out, explain what was done wrong, then get a kiss and cuddle and move on.|`|3bnLSVdqaa	No, it is not a bad strategy. Good parenting will lead to good things. The only thing, if there is one, will be she'll start thinking the high-chair is hers.
3D5Ktk1Iaa	Hi <br>  Congratulations, atleast it sounds like the latent phase has kicked off, normally this last 2-3 days depending on the intensity of the contractions/cramps but may be quicker for you as it seems they are becoming more intense. <br>  Standard medical advice at this point is paracetamol and a nice warm bath. <br>  Keep your fluid intake up and make sure you keep eating even if it's just snacks. <br>  Get rest while you can and call your doctor/midwife when you contractions are coming every 3-4minutes lasting 1 minute or earlier if you can't cope with the pain/are worried about the baby. <br>  Good luck|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	sounds like u in labour<br>  mine took a little while to get regular after my sweep but all the signs are good for you<br>  keep active to try and get them stronger and more regular i dont think ull be going for ur appointment wednesday x x
SEzIkGNiaa	Yes.  You are the one that decided to have your son, thus YOU take care of him.  Don't force you daughter to do something she didn't ask for.  Once in a while its okay to do that, when needed.  Not do go out and party with your friends.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Get the girl to tell someone about this it is unfair and the girls future is going to be pulled down if she fails at school. Talk to the mother and tell he she's a ***** from me.|`|6ArhO4qvaa	HORRIBLE PARENTING <br>  I CAN SEE MAYBE A FEW TIMES BUT THE NAME CALLING AND STUFF IS UN CALLED FOR <br>  ITS THE MOTHERS CHILD NOT THE DAUGHTER|`|oTlwONCbaa	Terrible parenting.this woman needs help|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	yeah, lousy parent. Feel bad for the girl.|`|i6jT4rpOaa	yes. oh my gosh thats so sad. talk to someone about it, like a teacher or whatever? idk. but thats horrible parenting.|`|MtzJYAOsaa	Extremely bad.
s4LWmcTjaa	I'd say yes that is poor parenting.  Your mom needs to care for your brother, not you.<br>  <br>  The only time I see watching your own siblings for that long in your parent's absence as acceptable is if your mom is a single parent working long hours to support the family.  But that is clearly not the case here.<br>  <br>  Your mom needs a big reality check.  Having children means it's not about her anymore.  I'm so sorry you are in this situation.  Talk to your school counselor or a trusted friend and see what you can do about the situation.  Your mom sounds like she needs some real help.<br>  <br>  I will say this though, thank you for being there for your little brother.  I know it's a pain to have to care for him like your his mom, but thank you for being a stable, loving care taker for him.  He's lucky to have a sister like you.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Poor parenting all the way around.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Um, yes, it is bad parenting.  Very bad parenting.  I have no respect for parents who force their children to become surrogate parents to their siblings.  If the parents didn't want to be parents, then they should have thought about that before they had kids.  This type of thing just fires me up!|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes it is bad parenting, poor girl.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	moms dont need to GO OUT to party with friends ..when she has children at home ..you werent born to be her caretaker ..she needs to raise YOU and the other one|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	personally i think that to a certain degree being a member of a family comes with responsabilities, like babysitting younger siblings, however  it should be set up in a fair way, and it feels like you are not feeling fair about it.  at least you aren't being abused by your brother.  when i was 12 we were left home alone and my brother who was 10 (and bigger than i was) would hit, kick, and otherwise beat and my brother who was 8 and myself.  we would have to hide in my parents room and sit at the door trying to hold it closed for hours because he would be outside with a butchers knife.   i'm not even kidding it ws horrible.   my parent's really had no other option though so their solution was to pay me for it.  when i babysat i got money.   you are 16 what makes you incapable of getting a part time job.  if you work those hours that she normally would ask you to babysit you have a legit excuse, and if you stand your ground and walk out the door and she chooses to leave that becomes a CFS problem.    also as long as the mother is paying for an alternitive babysitter, why can't they come to your house?   there are tons of jr. high kids who would love to baby sit for some extra cash and who's parents would drop them off at your place.|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	yes that is bad parenting she's not being a parent the 16 year old is. All I can say is she should get a job she'd probably work with people her age and be less available for her mom.plus she could say on days that she doesn't have to work that she does and then when her mom gets someone else to watch the kid she could say they didn't need her and hopefully she can go out with her friends.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	Well you are older,and she trusts you to babysit. When you are baby sitting cant you invite friends over not a party or nothing but just hang out and watch tv and stuff as long as you keep eye on the 2 year old?<br>  I can see your mom having you watch her while she goes to work.But not for her to go out all the time maybe every other weekend you stay home so she could go out but not every day or nothing<br>  <br>  And name calling you NO is not acceptable to me|`|fAN8snFdaa	I think that is pretty bad parenting personally.<br>  When we have children we need to be responsible for the .. a 16 year old is still a child.<br>  The mother is out quite often and till quite late - unless she is working that isnt good.. and if she is working she should have proper child care.|`|5RK2PBRraa	Im so sorry. Stick up for ur self, dont give up on finding ur dad! Im soo srry for u!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bZZAYIv6aa	Bad parenting for sure.  You see more & more of that these days.  That's what is wrong with our world today.  No sense of urgency or responsibility..|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Yes, it is bad parenting-- out and out neglect.  The teen cannot meet the emotional needs of the two-year old and that baby needs its mother around as much as possible.<br>  <br>  If the mother is not working, not watching the kids, either, and is now pressing the teen to get a job, she is being neglectful.  The kindest thing you could do for this family is to tip off social services and be a soft place for this teen to land.  She needs someone to talk to, lean and to assure her she is not being selfish to want a life of her own, and to be able to devote time to her studies, friends, etc.<br>  <br>  Encourage her to confide in her guidance counselor at school; they can often help troubled teens.|`|jwGkGaiCaa	Wow, this is actually surprising me... Me and a few of my friends had to do the same thing in both middle and high school. We ended up having play dates together so the kids could play and we could hang out, do homework, ect... Except my mom used the line that she needed fun time too... by the time I was 15 though we had come up with a plan of alternating weekends and if I was in a sport or something after school she would stay home or if I asked like a week ahead of time for a day off she would give me one. I ended up taking half days in school so I could work the 2nd half of the school day and still be home for my siblings. By the time I was 16 and 17 the situation greatly improved. Their dad had half time with them, and my older brother moved home so it was the 3 of us on half time so everyone got their freedom<br>  <br>  So what was that rant all about? Maybe the mother and child should have a discussion about making a similar arrangement and if the mother completely refuses then you have to take more drastic measures like calling CPS (child protective services)<br>  <br>  Oh, and I still finished school with a 3.65 gpa but that was because of teacher help during lunch and before school|`|oIyXMnmcaa	I know exactly how this girl feels.<br>  I have been raising my two younger brothers for about 2 years or so now. Our bio mom is a crack head and took off out west...it was a choice I made because I love them and would like to see them make it through high school. I am only 24 so I have lost out on a bit with raising all 4 kids including my own but would not change it for the world. <br>  <br>  Its sad that parents do this to their children...I could not imagine leaving mine behind no matter what the situation. It makes me hurt just knowing that I was left behind but hey what can ya do?<br>  <br>  She first has to step up and call her mom out on this...something along the lines of "YOU start being our mom or I am gone!" Sounds harsh I know but this mother needs to learn some responsibility and she wont if she has someone to force her duties on. I would personally already be gone to the police for neglect with my younger siblings--if party life is what is more important than that's fine...she would living by herself so that loneliness could eat her away on the inside. Neglect on children is something that I am strongly emotional about cause some parents are just sooo damn selfish. Intervention sounds about right to me...something must knock some sense into this mother.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I think it is bad parenting as far as the guilt trips, but if it was once a month putting you in charge of the 2 year old son, then it wouldn't be that bad of a thing.  I understand why you are upset with the situation and that yes your mom is not being a good parent for guilt tripping you and calling you names.|`|enZ5D4NUaa	Every parent raises their children differently but i feel that she should be more of a mom and remember that she has children to take care of and stop going out..Its your turn to live not hers....so yes it is bad parenting to an extent.|`|foJm2Yftaa	Its bad parenting. Tell her to to switch with the 13 yea old. XD &Lol&|`|2281a55099b065396684568bfd6125d7aa	YOU BET THATS BAD PARENTING..or shall I say non-parenting!<br>  She is treating the daughter like she the mother or other parent of the child instead of the sibling.<br>  IT IS the mothers responsibility to care for HER OWN CHILD.<br>  The mother is a manipulating inconsiderate selfish child herself.<br>  She needs HELP.<br>  Id bet she sucks the father dry for child support just to spend it on partying.<br>  Is the mother a gemini?<br>  Does she spend any time with the boy?<br>  I AM A STRONG ADVOCATE AGAINST CPS however in some cases it may be the right course..well its never right for them to profit off of children{which they do $4000 per head if they can adopt out a removed child $6000 per head if the child is special needs} but in some cases some children could benefit from being removed from such a monster. IF the father or other blood relative is unsuitable or unavailable ONLY.<br>  <br>  If possible and if family counseling is not an option perhaps the girl should consider moving in with another relative or becoming emancipated.<br>  Its obvious that the girl is already being emotionally/mentally abused and it could affect her relationship with her siblings which is tragic.<br>  It is also obvious that the little boy is being neglected.<br>  This is very very sad. I wish I could help.|`|dq7nvrfhaa	I lived that life...I watching my siblings on a regular basis when i was 11.Got my first job when i was 13.Started paying rent to my mom when i was 14.Started working full time when i was 15.My mother pulled me out of school to watch HER kids.I got married when i was 17.The really funny thing is that that she was pissed because she was going to loose a baby sitter,renter,and the money she got from my dad for child support.<br>  I am now a mom of two boys.And I can say from experience that yes that is bad parenting.I can't imagine what would make a mother put herself in front of her children s needs. We chose to become mothers therefor we should take care of the children we make.I'm sorry that this is an issue,and i hope that things get better.
rHufcHwHaa	If you ovulated just about a week ago, you definitely wouldn't be feeling a hard stomach due to pregnancy--that doesn't come around til the second trimester (around 12-14 weeks)  You're probably just feeling the effects of weight loss.  Congrats on that, but I would say your other symptoms do sound pregnancy-esque, but it's still a bit early to know.  Wait til you miss your period, and test then.  Good luck! :)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It would be too early to have any pregnancy symptoms.  Wait until your period is due and take a pregnancy test.|`|eMSP740Taa	My advice is to just relax and wait until your next expected period. Don't over stress yourself about being pregnant. I've know A LOT of women who were so obsessed with the idea of conceiving, that they themselves were causing their bodies to not get pregnant. When you stress and over analyze everything, that puts strain on your body. The moment those women relaxed and stopped worrying about pregnancy, they got pregnant. Good luck with it all! And just enjoy the experience of trying to conceive. =] Hope i helped a bit!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I think you need to take a pregnancy test hun.
AA10381258	There are two other possible reasons for a very big belly: She gained a lot of weight, or she has a lot of extra amniotic fluid. The chance that they haven't noticed a twin by 32 weeks is very very slight. Even if the baby is hiding, there would be a second heartbeat and a second set of placenta and cords.|`|pkCpNGzcaa	There is a chance that one baby is hiding behind the other, but also a chance that you just have a large baby. It happens. Either way you could have one or two healthy (but large in one case) baby/babies. Good luck!|`|6ArhO4qvaa	MY COUSIN WAS IN THIS SITUATION AND HE DIDNT KNO HE WAS HAVING TWINS UNTIL THEY WERE BORN ONE WAS HIDING|`|xlvg580Naa	in some case's one twin is behind the other one,so they might be twins|`|JsEd4H0raa	it's possible. one could have been hiding behind the other. Congratulations on your baby or babies|`|F0kjf1j8aa	yes, sometimes you hear of baby hiding behind one another, not all the time , sometimes women can just get really big, as long as you have a happy healthy baby or babies
Ueix2Q7Taa	there's always a possibilty to get pregnant. Your more likely to get pregnant in the middle of your cycle but not always. Wait until you are supposed to get your period. It's too early for a test to pick up a pregnancy. Your hcg levels wouldn't be high enough. Wait it out and if AF doesn't show up then take a test.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Any time you have unprotected sex, there is a possibility of becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  You can even become pregnant while on your period, I've known women who delivered healthy babies after this happened.<br>  <br>  Wait for a while and take a test. You can pick them up at Wal-Mart for less than $10.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	any time you have unprotected sex there is a possibility, so wait a little and if you don't get a period then take a test, but don't worry until you have something to worry about even then don't because worry is not good for baby, next time use a condom so you won't worry
JOVWBOOCaa	Don't get your hopes up but I think you are pregnant!! I also used the answer brand and my first month I tried I conceived! I know that a faint line is negative but mine were completely blank until the 27th and I got a faint line. The the 28th I got a positive and also the 29th and 30th and then they went back to faint lines for about 5 days untill nothing. I bded on 27th and 28th and based on my ultrasounds I conceived the 28th. So I must have povulated less than 24 hours after my positive opk result! Did you have no line results? You definitely timed it just right!!! I did not have spotting although I would say what you had was implantation spotting especially being what could be 5 dpo! I can tell you I had to have had implantation 6dpo because although no spotting, I did have cramping it felt like a pinching or stabbing feeling in my uterus on both sides all day. I also got very nauseous that day with very sore nipples and the next day it was gone. Over the next couple weeks if you are preg, these symptoms may or may not come back. Every woman is different and so is every preg. Some woman have symptoms and some dont . (I definitely did) lol! Things you could look for this week would be blue veins appearing dark in your breasts, nipple tenderness, fatigue, pinching or stabbing feeling in uterus that comes and goes and can switch from side to side,change in your favorite foods, a stuffy feeling (although some people say it is not a sign it was for me in 2 pregnancies as well as my sister), and if you are overally emotional. These are not great indicators however if you have these symptoms normally with af. Also keep in mind that when your timing is perfect and all the stars aligned you still only have 20% chance of conceiving. So IF you aren't this month don't be too hard on yourself (or dh) =) it is not your faults! If you haven't already, I would start taking prenatals, sounds like you have a great chance and if not, prenatal vitamins are great for ttc! Good luck and tons of baby dust! Keep us updated. Oh btw, I didn't know the dates of your ovulation or if you meant this thurs or last for your spotting but you could probably get accurate results with hpt 11dpo or about 4-5 days after implantation, if you get a negative retest in 3 days to be sure. Equate brand is a good early test and only 3-$4 at walmart. Also the digital tests are great! Best of luck~~~~~wishing you a bfp real soon!!!!!!
DiuDO1Weaa	i did hun yes it is normal remeber you just pushedf a baby out! and also it follows the afterbirth and tearinmg if any|`|KmC0K59taa	You will bleed quite a bit.  You will have some clots too.  I had a 4th degree tear after I delivered, and my OB started sewing me up before the placenta came out.  As he was sewing I had the strongest urge to push and they were like No, No.  But I couldn't help it and I pushed out the placenta and it went SPLAT on the floor.  The doctor was covered in splats of blood.  They had someone come in with a mop right away.  That normally does not happen.  <br>  <br>  I was white after I gave birth and very weak.  My husband was down in the nursery with the baby and they had me take a shower.  I was left all alone in the room and I almost passed out in the shower. <br>  <br>  You will be given big ol' thick pads to wear, and after the first few days the bleeding will subside some.  I had what was like a normal period for maybe 3 or 4 weeks after I got home.|`|AA10381258	I'm in my first pregnancy also, but I've been reading up on lots of sites about delivery. Most of them mention that you'll be bleeding through a super maxi pad (a real one, not the "thin" type) at a pace of about one an hour. Apparently its a very bloody experience. If you are concerned, please call your doctor. It won't do a new mommy any good to wind up anemic.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Everyone does. Didnt they give you those giant pads or a diaper to wear for the first couple days? You'll have to wear pads for weeks. Buy the long thick overnight ones
tFQda1nMaa	I'm 25 weeks and I only started showing a couple of weeks ago. Everyone is different. Some people think I'm going to get huge and others think I'm quite small, but the main thing is that you feel ok, and you are feeling movement.<br>  Good luck with your scan! x|`|Bqc86DRQaa	I didn't really start showing until about 25 weeks . your body type has a lot to do with how the baby is positioned inside you and different women show at different times. at 20 weeks i couldn't feel much movement as far as kicks go but i did feel little flutters.  but if you feel like something isn't quite right you should try and get into the Dr. asap just to have everything checked out.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I have a friend who never really looked pregnant. When she delivered she looked about how I did at 5 months pregnant. She just carried her baby internally. Her son was 8 pounds and very healthy when born. There is no "normal" way to carry your baby. Everyone swore up and down that the gender scans were wrong because I was carrying so high. They thought I would have a girl and I have a healthy little boy. Everyone's different. As long as your doctor isn't worried then you shouldn't worry.|`|YFZcl5thaa	1st of all congratulations :D and secondly you shouldnt feel bad about anything especially someone else's rudeness! Everyone's different but give it a few weeks and I'm sure you will see a difference. Make sure when you get your scan done you ask them to estimate size and give you an idea of how you buby is prgressing (some baby's are just small). And get lots of pics!|`|n86nMfbtaa	i'm 20 weeks and still BARELY showing. at most, i have a pudge hanging off my belly. but i've heard some women don't show until about 7 months. so no worries, i'm sure we have healthy babies! is it your first? if it is, that might explain why your muscles haven't stretched as much. <br>  <br>  congrats, by the way!|`|TDH1TxJCaa	Is there anyway you can bring your scan forward?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but i have limited knowledge in this 'Area'<br>  <br>  Sorry & Congratulations BTW<br>  <br>  A,Holt|`|QeALCWbqaa	aw|`|JkBbdg72aa	Well your doctor will let you know if something is wrong. But I noticed with mine that I really didn't put on alot of weight until about 51/2- 6months. It seemed like over night I got huge, lol. I find is best if you discuss your fears with your doctor when you go to your next app. I know that in my second trimester I felt the best, first trimester sucked, and my last trimester was even harder. If you don't have the number for your midwife, how are u supposed to get ahold of them when the time comes? Every pregnant woman feel like somethings wrong. I wouldn't stress it. Remember on the twelfthed you'll have your ultrasound and they will be able to make sure everything is okay. Being pregnant can be a scary experience, but try to not let yourself get upset as that can be harmful as well. I hope this has helped. Good Luck, Jess|`|102a2a2277322fb2778374274b3c83c3aa	the thing with pregnancies are that your baby is growing EVEN if your not. when i was full term i looked like i was having twins. a friend of mine when she was full term wasnt evening showing. so as long as you feel the baby move he/she is fine. if you really want to make sure drink ice cold juice and lay on your left side this tends to make the baby move a little bit. have the technician that does your sonogram check for a 2VC ( 2 vessel cord) it can make the baby more "tired" so to speak and they dont move much. good luck!|`|sstNdyYVaa	hey hun<br>  <br>  im 21 weeks and i dont really look it either! you just need to reassure yourself  that every woman is different and we all grow according to the gentics of our bodies.<br>  <br>  Just feel happy the way you are, im sure your bubs is fine too. mine doesnt kick to often but when it does i know its happy and all. just stay positive and i hope your scan will give you that extra reassurance...<br>  <br>  all the best xxx|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	I didnt start to show till I was about 6 months and then she was there All of a sudden<br>  (I actually weighed less at the end of my pregnancyThaian at the beginning so dont worry|`|uJJPFJoyaa	When I was 30 weeks I have been told by strangers and friends that I look like I was am 4-5 months.

Every women looks differen't, some don't show till later in the pregnancy and others show real early, doesn't matter if it was their first or fifth pregnancy. At 18wks you should be fine, the movement I feel now compared to my second trimester is much more stronger & often now.

YjoFsZuyaa	Speak to your doctor, it is known that women with PCOS have an increased risk of getting diabetes especially when they are pregnant, they may well put you on a drug called Metformin, this has a benefit of weight loss being a side effect, it is also safe to take metformin in pregnancy|`|oqUlYXqtaa	a low carb diet can be very helpful, or a diet that controls the foods and have low glicemic index. also talk to your Doctor about taking something like Metformin who can help with PCOS and losing weight, you can find others with PCOS and ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!

oHNrktxTaa	Although, some HPT's are 99% accurate, I would call your OBGYN & make an appointment to have a blood test done.

But its rare to get a false positive i would go to the dr's or buy 2 of the same brand test do them and see what happens.|`|3MDY29gnaa	Go to the Doctor and get a blood test! <br>  That's the only 100% sure way to find out|`|LWEfc0UOaa	do another one<br>  <br>  or go a doctor they'll find out|`|a1ymHaWAaa	doc can give you a blood test which is very accurate|`|SzNmGV0Daa	You need a blood test but I'm 99% sure your pregnant. When you first took the test there was probably not enough HCG in your system yet. Now that your further along it can pick up the HCG. Congrats and Good Luck :)
DDYwnut6aa	If you've had intercourse recently, what you could be seeing is seminal residue.  It looks and acts identical to EWCM.  The way to tell the difference is the water test - real EWCM will ball up and sink to the bottom.  Seminal residue will float.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  Added:  If you're seeing EWCM, then consider yourself still fertile, just incase.

eUuFPJAFaa	Oh hun, Caleb's just got over it, and he had it for a week. Me and his Daddy both took him to different doctors and they told us to keep offering food - but make it easy things for him to eat himself - so he had little cubes of cheese, cut up sandwich meat, toast etc and he kept the majority of that down. As soon as we tried to feed him "normal" meals, he brought them straight back up - same with full sized 7oz bottles. We cut his bottles to 4oz a time, but gave them more often. His nappies were frequent and vile, but we kept them nice and quickly changed so thankfully no nappy rash.<br>  <br>  The best advice other than that I can give is keep giving her calpol every four hours to help with the cramps and the temperature and let her sleep/have cuddles whenever she wants. It's nasty and horrible to see them feeling that ill but it does pass.
8XcRFF6Taa	If I were you I wouldn't give them that option.  Make a healthy snack and don't offer anything else they will eat it when they are hungry enough.  Same thing for the milk, don't offer anything else.  He really needs the fat from the milk for his growing brain, I would work on that first:)  You can always add healthy stuff to the junk they are eating for mac and cheese you can add flaxseed oil(very healthy, high in omega 3 fatty acids, great for their growing brain and provides many other health benefits:)to make it a little more healthy for him, I would also use real butter, to make up for the milk he isn't getting.  Grilled cheese you can make healthy by using whole wheat or multi grain bread and of course real cheese(kraft singles are processed) you can add some diced onions and tomato, little by little.  Vitamins are very good for your kids, they are growing an need all the nutrients they can get, from foods and vitamins. <br>  <a href="http://www.flaxseed-oil.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flaxseed-oil.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/flaxs..." rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/flaxs...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>   <br>  *making it look fun always helps!|`|zqxP5exvaa	Most people would say to make the food fun. <br>  It actually helps. <br>  He doesn't like chicken?....cook it into tiny little bits and make it into a picture in the plate.<br>  <br>  Usually when they see it as a smiley or something, they don't think of it as chicken.<br>  <br>  As a toddler my mom used to say that if i didn't eat it i would have a hole in my tummy.

ndVPHfmaaa	It is your child!!  This is between you and your husband.  Your in laws have no right to tell you what to do.  They do have the right to tell you how it makes them feel, but that's it.  I was baptized as a child, and it turns out, I don;t believe in all of that now, but back then that's what my parents did.  No big deal!  If they had any respect for you ad your marriage they would not have come at you like this.  They are the ones hurting the family, not you.  I would sit down with your husband and make a decision, together, and then stick by it.  For better or worse right?  If your in laws wont come around that is their problem, and they will be missing out on a lot of happy family memories and joys.|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	You may not like what I have to say, but it's the truth...<br>  <br>  You baby is not just your baby. she is your husbands daughter too.<br>  If your husband agrees to baptize your daughter then go ahead and do so, because when it comes down to it you two are her legal guardians and can make that decision... If he has reservations about the baptism, then NO, you should not have her baptized, you need to be sensitive to his feelings as well...<br>  <br>  Now, i'll tell you why I got my daughter baptized,  even though I believe she should decide on her own what religion she wants to belong to.<br>  I was raised a catholic, more like forced into it... I hated going to church and hated attending the weekly Bible classes for us...but my mother forced me into it...but now when I reflect on my life....going to church actually brough order to my life, it taught me think about good and evil, to think about what choices I have and what I could do to make adifference. If I didn't go to mass and read the Bible I would never know all those things..It's different when someone tells you what to do, it's another thing when you yourself realize how to live your life....and that's what I want my daughter to learn.....to tell right from wrong , good from Evil, and if later on she doesn't like it, or wants to explore other religions, she most welcome to....<br>  <br>  That's my logic behind it.....but I baptized her with my hubby's consent as well....|`|dXVA1wHDaa	She's your child, it's up to you what religion you raise her in.  If you want her baptised go ahead, they cannot and should not try to stop you.<br>  <br>  Have a really quiet ceremony if you don't want to annoy them, but it's your choice and your right as her parent to make a decision on what religion to raise her in.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	It's Buddhist, with a capital  "B" ! And I don't believe your story. True Buddhists wouldn't care about such matters.And Buddhists are not really "strict". They are very open to other religions. And a REAL Catholic wouldn't marry a non-Christain in the first place.You sure don't sound close and loving...|`|h5q89E3Haa	If you feel Strong enough about it you can get your child baptized.<br>  The Catholic Church only requires 1 parent desire to have the child baptized. I had my daughter baptized in secret because there was so much resistance.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Have her baptized and don't tell the in-laws.  I had my daughter baptized in a Catholic church and i'm not religious at all.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	First of all, they are not being good Buddhists. Buddhists do not interfere with the religious choices of anyone, ever.<br>  <br>  Second, Buddhism is not a theistic faith. It is a practice, a way of life. There is no deity. LOTS of Catholics (and other faiths) practice Buddhism (I am one of them!) There is nothing about Buddhism that prevents a person from pursuing other religious practices.<br>  <br>  It is your right to baptize your child as you like. You are not causing the problem; your in-laws are causing the problem.<br>  <br>  You most certainly can raise your child Catholic and teach her all the Buddhist tenets and beliefs. I've done that with my three kids who are now adults and it's worked beautifully.<br>  <br>  You are not forcing anything on your child. You are simply abiding your beliefs. You can teach her Buddhism in your home and abide your husband's beliefs as well.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to stress over. Nothing. <br>  <br>  Your husband needs to speak to his family and tell them to back off. If they are good Buddhists, they would know that there is nothing about Catholicism (and/or the baptism) that prevents Buddhism from being a large part of your child's life. <br>  <br>  For them to argue with you further, disrepect you and cause more drama is a sign of their failure in their faith. Buddhists respect all faiths and endeavor by their own behavior to set an example of tolerance and acceptance.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Actually they have no say at all.  They maybe the inlaws but you and your husband make the final decision.   What you should do is get her baptised catholic and when she is old enough she can convert to whatever she wants.|`|7ocvtrZnaa	This is your daughter, not theirs. I guess it would be nice to skip all the drama, but sometimes this isn't an option. Sorry for your situation.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	It is YOUR baby, not theirs. Let them meddle elsewhere: PS she can be baptized, and then still be free to choose whatever option when she reaches 18|`|heDtLdz5aa	yes i agree with the others..have her baptized without the family knowing...that is what i personally would do..|`|sR4HjV9Paa	Have her secretly baptised by a priest. God's law is to be obeyed when it contradicts what men want.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Its YOUR child. You bring her up how you want to.|`|AA11401784	First off, Buddhism isn't a religion, it's a practice. You can be a Catholic and a Buddhist, too.<br>  <br>  Head over to <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org</a> to learn about true Buddhism. <br>  <br>  Next, have the child baptized, if that makes you feel better. <br>  <br>  Finally, tell your husband and your in-laws that the child will benefit from having spiritual guidance from different cultures, and that she will grow up to be a kind and loving adult if she is led by both the Catholics and the Buddhists.<br>  <br>  And one more thing - quit stressing over this. Not worth the strain. Smile, stand up straight, and state your case calmly and clearly.<br>  <br>  - Stuart|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Ok, I completely understand where you are coming from with this because my husband is jewish and his parents wanted our son to have a bar mitzvah even though they don't really practice anything jewish at all.  They don't even attend temple!<br>  <br>  I absolutely put my foot down on this one.  The dad wanted it and my son wasn't even interested.  Luckily for me my husband backed me up and told them no.  But its really up to you and your husband how you want to handle it.  Of course there will be hard feelings at first but they will get over it in time.<br>  <br>  You could say that the child could decide for themselves what they want to have done.  This would be one way to compromise and is a good idea I think in your case.  See with us, my sister's husband happends to be jewish and they practice so we let our son go to their house for all the jewish holidays, etc.  We will let him decide what he wants to do if anything when he is older.  My mom is Christian and goes to church on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Try and hang in there.  Let your daughter decide for herself what she wants to be when she gets older if you don't want the hassle of forcing the issue of her being baptized.  This will calm down your in-laws.  However, it sounds as though this is really an issue of control instead of religious purposes but that's just my opinion.  Best wishes to you.|`|3zZ6nyuRaa	i think that the decision is up to you and your husband. It is your child, not ur in laws child. They should respect your decision. And they will love the child no matter what religion. So it might make them angry, but they will have to respect you and your husband as parents|`|9Wh3XCn9aa	Well, I am a Catholic, so obviously, I think side with you that your baby should be baptized as a baby in the Catholic church. The decision is ultimately up to you and what you believe in and your faith. Just follow your heart.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Get her baptized and tell them you mean no harm. You want her to make her own decision in religion and therefore you have to expose her to religion. Agree to do something important for them in return.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	tell them to shut the hell up. it's your baby. you do what you think is best for it, especially when it's something that important.|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	She is YOUR DAUGHTER! I can't believe the family has the guts to say that to you. Baptize your daughter and when she turns 18 and she wants to change her faith then she can do so then. Till then you make the choices for her since she is to young and doesn't know a thing about life. I would so tell the family to but out. This decision is strictly on your and your husband. Don't let others dictate to you how your daughter should be raised. My in laws try the same thing, but once I put my foot down they have take it down a few notches.|`|RFzKP7MGaa	they cant be truly buddhist, buddhism is a lifestyle not a religion (that means u can be buddhist and catholic/muslim/whatever). first off im buddhist AND catholic. second buddha believed in keeping family tradition he would have said have the baby baptized then let her choose what she wants when shes old enough to<br>  <br>  oh and it IS your daughter so it IS your choice, above was just to let u know that they arnt following the true teachings (sadly alot of ppl do that, they SAY their buddhist but follow whatever kind of beliefs they want)

I was told at one point that even though you are TTC you should still have fun with sex.  Don't make it something you HAVE to do.  and you don't necessarily have sex everynite.  everyother night and having fun with it will help you not be as stressed.  it takes the average couple about a year to concieve.  so you've got some time.  if you try no to worry about it and make it happen like now.. they next thing you know you'll be pregnant.  thats what i'm doing! :)<br>  baby dust -- good luck.|`|JpG4zaA9aa	Main thing to do right now is RELAX. <br>  Stressing out will not help you to conceive.  <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, it takes about 6 months to conceive and if after 1 year of trying then seek medical attention.<br>  You were on BC for a long time and it takes some time for your body to readjust.  <br>  So, in the meantime track your ovulation dates and take prenatal vitamins.  I also recommend that you take folic acid at least 800 mgs.<br>  <br>  Last thing, enjoy your husband and have fun.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|6ArhO4qvaa	YOU JUST NOT FERTILE YET JUST BECAUSE YOUR NOT PREGNANT NOW DOSENT MEAN YOU WONT GET THERE
cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	Every women's body reacts differently in pregnancy. From what I've read (but I'm no doctor) brown and pink discharges are sometimes ok. It's fine as long as the discharge isn't heavy with cramping or red like menstrual blood and there are no blood clots. I had some discharge at about 10 weeks then it turned into menstrul like blood and then clots, i misscarried 2 days later. If it's persistent you should call your doctor, he should give you an exam maybe even an ultrasound to see if there is ne fetal movement or heartbeat. That is what they did with me. Just try not to worry and stress yourself just try and be calm and see your doctor. Good luck to you, hope all is well!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	yes it is normal..may be what they call "implantation bleeding" only worry when there is bright red blood and pain. good luck|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	nothing to worry yourself about...|`|SzMH2na0aa	I had almost the same situation and I called the doctor, they said it was normal to have spotting in early pregnancy, also long as the spotting is pink or brownish.  If it is red or heavy like your period you need to call the doctor right away.|`|A9MDoFooaa	yep it can happen - brown discharge is old blood - its when you have bright red that you need to worry - and even then it can often not mean a miscarriage.<br>  i bled bright red at 8 weeks - i now have a lovely 7 month old baby :-)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|gen3Tuynaa	yer it`s perfectly normal<br>  in fact that happened with me wen my mum was pregnent|`|pkCpNGzcaa	That can be normal but you shouldn't always trust the internet. I would go talk to your doctor because even though it can be normal, in some cases it can be bad. Talk to a doctor and see what they say.
