For the past few years my parents have done my taxes because I was a full-time student in college and still under their insurance/benefits/etc. Well now that Ive graduated I really have NO IDEA on where to start and when to do. I am 23 years old and have no children.    I was thinking about having a professional do it for me, but I heard it could get expensive.    Last year I worked at one place until April, then I moved and found a new job in October so I know that I need to get some sort of form from both jobs.      Any help would be greatly appreciated as far as where I should go to get them done (somewhere reasonably priced) and what paperwork I will need to bring to whoever is doing my taxes. Thanks!
20090222162957AADeb4h	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Do you believe Obama will raise tax on the rich?	I find this laughable, as he told us he would raise tax on the rich and now he is saying he will raise tax on the rich AND business.      For those of you who can't balance a check book... here is how it works:      You raise business tax 10%, but they are not as stupid as you think. There is a reason they are IN business and you are NOT. They will simply pass that 10% along to their goods sold.      So us poor taxpayers, that think the rich is being taxed, will be paying the majority of the cost to balance the budget. That's right... middle class and the poor... not the rich.      Man this guy is a good talker. No wonder the wealthy didn't seem to care... hell they are getting rich off their businesses and as long as it cost the same to play the game in the business world for everyone, they could care less. Middle class will pay for the bail out and balancing the budget.      Watch the market crash when Obama reveals his plan as they know the middle class, that drives their companies, won't have the money to spend, so profits will be less and layoffs will be the name of the game.      It's all about a big government grab of middle class money, at the worst time of our history, and Obama will simply call it "inflation" so his lemmings following will smile and be happy.       The real question is when the ObamaMiniMe's will wake up and realize socialism has NEVER worked. In my opinion, they are not bright enough to see it until it is too late. They get what they deserve, but the rest of us don't.      Your thoughts?

20090222111430AA4TEvp	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does this sound ridiculous?	We are a young married couple looking to buy our first home.  In this sobering housing market, it seems like we could grab a pretty good deal.  We do not have any kids as of yet but plan to have a good sized family (probably 3 or 4 kids) starting here in the next 2 to 3 years.  We recently stumbled upon a very large home in an area just slightly out of our target neighborhoods.  It is a 6 bedroom/3.5 bath 3000 sqft home...that is the ridiculous part.  It seems to be a killer deal (still in our target price range) in a nice neighborhood...the layout is great, upgraded kitchen, move in ready...there is nothing we can really find wrong with the house except that its a little further out than we wanted to be AND that its so large.  We do not have any plans to move out of the city in the near future (both of us are full time workers so that may change if there is opportunities to move up) but all in all, we are just a little skeptical about purchasing a home that large...but that seems to be the only major problem.  What do you think?

I spoke to the club and they said that they already charged $150 and that he wasnt supposed to need an additional $175, and to ask him for the money back.

I currently just started working back with a company that I have left 2 other times.

Every night I look online for other jobs, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I feel like I would be letting my boss (who values what I do at work) down, my family and friends down for backing out from a good paying job to come home and start over.  I keep looking at UPS for jobs...I think that would be something that I would enjoy, good pay, not sure about the hours, but it seems like a job you go, perform, go home, and have a work/life balance. My current job has the responsibility of a 24 hour operation with 25-30 employees and hundreds of thousands dollars of revenue management.

And Im like    "uh. no." and my friend says    "I think so, yeah" and the women goes on about disney stars like the J. Bros and Miley Cyrus, and CSI and how they helped them start out and things. And shes like    "Okay, so, fill out this card if you're interested, and you'll get a call tomorrow so we can see about when you guys can have an interview! Because, you both are REALLY pretty and it'd be a great chance to take."      It all /seemed/ legit, but, we all know by now not to judge things by their outside appearance (right?).

He is lazy in his work and is not really 'present when he is there.  He wont take responsibility for problems and  takes out his frustrations on the other staff when i am not there and they tell me about it later.  Everyone is threatening to leave.  He is also having an affair with the front of house manageress and they think nobody knows about it.  There are so many issues other than this that need to be addressed in a meeting on Wednesday but I want to approach him tomorrow about the staff morale issues and personal things before that meeting so we can discuss the "businesses issues on Wednesday.  But I am unsure of what to say.  The affair is affecting the other staff and they have no respect for him.   Do i bring it up at all?  What do I say so I don't look like i am attacking him.    I mean, he has stuffed up so many times.  I am leaving in a few months anyway..but this needs to be addressed because its getting pretty claustraphobic and there is so much negativity.  Pointers would be much appreciated.  Cheers!

Hi guys, i made a purchase of ebay recently, the sellers shipping method was stated as Expedited Flat Rate Shipping Service, i got a e-mail with confirmation number stating it had left the facility on the 20th, which was friday, i didn recieve the item on saturday so im hoping i will recieve it on monday, i checked the USPS website, i input the zip codes and box size, and it said the shipping time was 2 days, so im asking, is it always 2 days or is that just an estimate? because the other shipping times were listed as 6 days, and im pretty sure its not going to take 6 days because the ebay sellers feedback all says FAST SHIPPING. So anyone have any experience with this?

20090222191812AAwfLlR	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Help!! I canceled a check for goods purchased and found out they didn't cost as much as the guy had told me.?	Ok here is the run down. Guy had a shop and I picked up a decent size lot from him. I totally bought it on impulse. When I got home I did my research I found out he had lied or maybe wasn't informed that well and I got a bad deal. Well I got nervous and I called him and told him I did not want a part of it and wanted to return the items asap. He said ok. Well next day I couldnt get a hold of him and I call a couple times a day and many emails. I finally get an email and feeds me a whole line of some BS and said he didnt accept returns even after he said he would and that he cashed the check and all sales were final.      Well I cancelled the check and told him I was and I wanted to get the things back to him. He is being reluctant and doesnt want to take it back and said he was gonna go to the police and file a warrant out for my arrest. I told him to pick his stuff up and we wouldnt need to do this.       So what can happen to me? Can I get in trouble??? I jsut want to give the stuff back to the man and call it a day but that obviously isn't what he has in mind.       I Could really use some advice here!!    Thank You, for reading this and will give top points!!
20090222184252AAmOY23	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Discrimination in Fair Housing; Attorneys?	I have 3 girls, and 2 are deaf. I needed to find a rental, and I found one that I loved, but when my realtor (Century21) talked to the Better Homes agent about the home, they stated to my realtor that the landlord won't rent to me because my 2 girls are deaf, and they view them as an insurance liability. My agent explained to the BH agent that this was discrimination based on New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination and the Fair Housing Act. What are my rights? I'd like to sue, if I can, can anyone suggest a good lawyer who handles cases like this? I've worked with a Deaf lawyer who uses an interpreter in the past, he's out of Trenton.
