20090307102539AAtxIJi	Business & Finance;Investing	Would you invest in business plan that generates times return yearly?	I have tested a model which would generate not percentages, but times over your investment per year(more than 10 times yearly). While, I admit that I am yet to test it with real money - it has been tested months with demo software + mathematical formulas + computer code + backed by heavy logic. The only ptoblem is that, since I am yet student in economics...and even not an American, it's hard to start this great idea. I need about 10K at least to meet margin requirements of certain brokers and exchanges.   Here is my plan:      I DON't want any money in advance. You can open a letter of credit on bank of YOUR choice(well I want to review the bank as well - I would prefer banks such as UBS, chace etc...).    Then...once the letter is opened and the conditions set - I would disclose to you the model + I can even trade your money. Then...you release the money and so on...   I am NOT going to disclose my ideas for free, so please, don't bother sending me messages here :). Also, please save the stupid jokes.       Needless to say - the model is legal and it's NOT tax avoidant or etc. Also, despite it's potential - it won't cause major macroecnomics breakdowns :).    If you want to get some very brief idea, here is my website: rexusfund.com       WIthin the website - a few claims are made(about neural networks, kelly criterion, chernoff bounds, etc...). But such ideas, while applied by my model - are NOT the heart of it. I am extremely careful about disclosing the very model. Only people who initiate the investing process - would be given more and more information as the business relations develop.      And the e-mail IF you are ready to invest: rexusfund@gmail.com       Thanks for the attention.

20060725091708AAbulua	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does anyone know anything about deeds?	I am doing research on a house that I want to purchase.  There was a deed of trust issued in which the buyer signed a promissory note for $100,000.  Attached to this was a Warranty Deed with Vendor's Lien that was retained against the property for $25,000.  Does anyone know what this means?  Did the previous owner buy the house for $125,000, $100,000, $25,000 or some unknown amount but used this money as part of the payment towards the purchase?  The initial offering price on the house is $130,000 but the house needs a lot of work.  What do these liens mean to me as a potential buyer of the house?  Would I be responsible for these?  Are they common in Texas?  All the websites say to research this information, but don't really tell what some of these details mean and what to do with the information.  Thanks all who respond.  I really appreciate you taking the time.

I've been unemployed and actively seeking employment for about 4 months now. I interviewed for a job the other day, and they liked me enough to bring me back for a second interview. The problem is, the only day they are doing the second interviews for this position is the same day as my grandmothers funeral. I was never that close with my grandmother, and haven't seen her in at least 10 years. Despite that, I still feel like I should go to her funeral- if for nothing else than to be there for my dad. So what should I do? I'm going broke and need a job ASAP. But it's my grandmothers' funeral. I tried to ask if they could reschedule for another day, but they can't. It's apparently a group interview, so if they get more candidates for the job the will have another day/time for a second interview. If not, I'm out of luck. So what should I do?

20090227135919AAAe72h	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit Card Problem...Please Help!?	I have a problem with a credit card. I made a payment that was rejected because I typed in the wrong account number. When in a couple of days the payment hadn't posted, I called and we went over the situation and even read the account number (which the lady verified as what I sent-of course I couldn't see what I had sent) and she assumed it was because there was no check number. So we resent it. Well, geez, it got rejected again. I finally called again and another lady finally realized the account number was wrong. Now, the credit card company froze my account because I had multiple returned checks and they won't reopen it till I pay off a big chunk of my debt, which of course I can't do. Do I have any recourse? I mean the credit card company screwed me over royally. Sure I made the mistake first, but I even tried to correct it and their mistake is what costs me. Because there were multiple returned checks not just one. I am so angry, I'm sick to my stomach. Please, please tell me there is something I can do?

Should I express my doubts to my manager but I have to work hard to get projects done.      I have 3+ years of experience in web design and development; however the project's deadline is near. I'm glad my manager gave the assignment to another designer. However, now I felt doubts about my abilities and figured that I work too slow compared in the fast-paced world of business. It takes me few hours to complete a webpage -- just web design.       I accepted this job 2 weeks ago. I overheard that the IT team needs the files ASAP. My marketing manager said I should work on projects that matches my skillset and she gave me assignments that are lighter on load not a website that needs to be finished by 2 weeks.

I have worked for my currently employer for 6 years. My girlfriend gave me the ultimatum of moving out there so I must go. I don't have a job lined up, but am confident something will happen once I get there. Thing is, my spending habits have been absolutely AWFUL and I only have a few thousand dollars and nearly 6k in credit card debt. I figure if I can make a mass withdrawal from the 21k I have in my fidelity 401k, I can pay off that debt and have cash to live if I don't get a job right away. So my question is, being way under 59.5, how much could I get total after taxes and penalties, of that 21k? and is this just a totally bad idea to pay off my debts and make sure I have cash to live off of? I figure my 401k isn't going to grow that much anyway. And yes, I sincerely do anticipate changing my spending habits for the better. I just don't want to arrive there broke and with credit debt.

I like helping people, but I don't like conflict.  I'd rather just -help-.     I've had 90+ averages as long as I can remember; I'm best at sciences and social studies.     My brain is good at making connections between ideas, and remembering things.     I would like a good-paying job.     I don't want to sit in a cubicle.     I do not want to a nurse.

20090307110528AA5ZUys	Business & Finance;Investing	Problem with inverse funds - WHY?	The DXD is the double Dow inverse ETF. The chart of the DXD should be an exact upside-down chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, if you look at the DJIA, you'll see that on Jan 2009, it was 9000. On Oct 2008, it was around the same level. So, the DXD should be the same way, but it's not. If you look at the DXD, you'll see that on Oct 2008, it was between 60 and 70. In Jan 2009, the DXD was at 50!!! Calling the "DXD" an inverse of the Dow is a mistake, because it's not an inverse as you can see. There's a huge discrepancy between the Dow and the DXD. Those who shorted the Dow are much better off today than those who bought DXD.      If you look at $RUT, which is the Russel index, you'll see an even greater discrepancy. TWM vs $RUT.      While RUT fell and stayed down, TWM jumped up and then fell back down. It should have stayed up, but it didn't. Talk about MAJOR ERROR here. Who is responsible for managing these ETFs and why do they allow such huge errors to occur in the performances of these inverse ETFs ?

We have organised but not yet signed for, another 3yr fixed mortgage after our last one ended.  We need to borrow approx ￡84,000 (although we need to find out the exact figure to let our new mortgage company know, so they can work out our exact payments, I think it might be somewhere around ￡630 a month, not sure).  Can somebody tell me roughly what the payments will be for that amount?  The interest rate is 4.49% and we have taken it out over 15 years.  Also, can you tell me, I know when you first take a mortgage out that you pay mainly interest for a while first, but does this apply with each new mortgage you take out, or only your first mortgage? and also how much capital on our new mortgage will we actually be paying off each month?  I'd be really grateful for your answers, am only 27 and not too clued up on all this - there's so much to think about!  Thanks.

My parents are not rich, but have 20,000. in savings. Dad has been in hospital for 2 months. Medicare pays 80%. Parents don't qualify for full state benefits (MA) and state wants them to spend down their assets before state will pay bills (that is after a 5500. deductible.) Mom will be broke. We want to set up a bank account such as i.e "The john smith medical assistance fund" so that in lieu of flowers friends and family can make donations to help pay the medical bills, funeral, etc. My question is what name should the account be set up in? If it is in either of my parents names, the state medical fund will view it as an asset and make them spend it down and Mom will be left with no money to live on. If it is in my name, am I responsible to claim this as income? Any suggestions on how to do this? Thank you!!

I was traveling on a dual carriageway (motorway) and I was in the fast lane/overtaking lane.    I was overtaking a taxi traveling slightly slower than my vehicle, both lanes were covered in snow.      I began to lose control of my vehicle and it veered towards the central barrier, I adjusted to compensate and clipped the rear of the taxi.    By the time I hit the taxi I would have slowed to less than 10mph.      We both pulled up and got out. I checked both vehicles for damage, luckily I had only hit the hub cap and it had been damaged but was still attached to the wheel, there was no damage to my car. We exchanged details and went on our ways.   And that was the last I heard of it. Until now...   I received a letter detailing the incident which states the taxi driver sustained injuries to the neck and back as a result of the collision.      What do I do?   (I don't believe for a second he is injured)   What will this cost me in terms of insurance renewals and anything else? I have about 7 or eight years clean insurance.   How can I help my case?    Should I lie and say he drove into me? Or state anything else? I don't want to do this but he is clearly taking the proverbial.      An additional question.    I actually made a claim when my car was stolen just before Christmas will this affect anything?    ie making my next renewal massive?

Had to bank some cash with Barclays on 23 Feb so i could write out a cheque to pay for some IVF treatment.  Have just been doing some online banking and noticed that payment had gone out but no cash had gone in.  Went to my paying in book and noticed the cash has gone but the stub is still there.  When i was doing the banking i had 3 accounts i was paying in to, thought maybe the bank might of noticed their mistake and paid it into one of our other accounts, but no.  Have noticed that the bank teller had removed a slip before the one i had written to order a new paying in book.  Surely if i go to the bank and tell them this, they will be able to check their records and see that on the day in question the had ￡480 over at the end of the day!!!  Helppppppppppppp

Is there anything else I can bring to acquire the funds sent to me?  If I bring another type of state issued i.d.

According to Wikipedia, he donated 28 billion to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Wikipedia).  I would like to know if the 28 billion is included in the 58 billion count.  Please source your information.      I know Warren Buffet also pledged to match 30 billion to the foundation.  But it's spread of multiple years and does not seem to be part of Warren's calculated net worth.  But I might be wrong.  Anyway, clarifications on this topic is greatly appreciated.

I took out a payday loan (dumb thing) and Something came up and I couldn't repay at that time, but sent what I could and now they are saying that I paid the loan in full but there are other charges that I have to pay.  When I asked for a bill or something showing the amount they refused.  They harrass me at work and home.  They now just called and wanted Human Resources so they can do a wage garnishment.  I thought you had to go Court in order for them to do it.  And I tried to look the loan company up to see if they are legal in Illinois and I can't find anything on their business.  It is getting so embarrassing.   How can I make them go away.  How can they garnish my wages.  I don't make all that much and I am supporting my 2 kids, where daycare takes most my check anyway.  How can they get away with this?  They said they are from Westbury or something like that?  Anybody have any advise on what to do?  They are harrassing me..

Our house is close to foreclosure, we may still be able to save it if we can borrow the money from our family. My question is, if you've had your home foreclosed on, did they come after you for the difference owed? Or did they just call it a loss and move on? I am worried that they will hunt me down and garnish my wages until they get what's owed them. If that's the case then I will put the house up for sale or ask the mortgage co. to do a short sale. Any info from people who have been there?

20090307105541AAxKKT8	Business & Finance;Credit	I need to know about my credit in terms of my chances of getting a auto loan with my credit union?	Here is the story, Sometime in January of this year I was turned down for a auto loan for $16,000 for the 2008 Chevrolet Impala LT, so I plan on Re-Applying again for the loan this summer, but here is the thing, Last year I was going through a Financial slump and I wasn't able to pay my credit card bill on time and at times I wasn't able to pay, but in December of 2008 My credit card company put me on a program to get me under my credit limit because through out those times those fees that my credit card company has charged me, got me over my credit limit, so that is why they put me in the program.       Since December I was able to pay all my credit card bills to get me back under my credit limit and current with them once again.      My Question is, If I pay all my bills on time from now until lets say, June will It be a better chance for me to get the auto loan at my credit union for the 08 Impala? I am really trying to get it this summer and I am doing all I can do to pay all my bills on time to have a better chance for me to get the loan. My credit union is offering 5.5% interest rat to pay back the loan. So do I still have a chance? Thanks a lot.
20090307110219AA4Ifvo	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Is it a good idea to save me money to pay off my debt? More details....?	I was looking at my credit report today and was looking at all my debt. I would really love to get my credit back on track, but I don't want to consolidate it or file bankruptcy. I don't really owe that much compared to other Americans, I owe approxamietely $5,000. not to mention I also own my own company, and it is very hard for me to get loans or lines of credit. I have no debt in my company name, but because I am a sole propreitor unforantly it has to go under my personal credit unless I decide to become a corporation and get DUNS number. My FICO score is 528, if I was to pay all my debt off in 1-3 months do your score go up slow, or fast? All approiate answers are welcomed. God Bless.
