Do you think that with Ric Flair's appearance on Monday Night RAW next week, is there a chance that the two will fight eachother at Wrestlemania 25, or is it so everyone forgets about the Mickey Rourke storyline, or maybe even a possible build up for the debut of Flair's son, Reid Flair?

Even if I don't get any answers here, a few links to different websites with suggestions and such would be helpful.

I also do not enjoy swimming.    I have bad feet (almost no arches, and I overpronate) but I have very strong legs and love to run.  I have correctional inserts I can put in shoes to help with the foot issues, but something that requires balance and jumping and such is not good for me.  I am also quite short... 4' 11".

But I'm realizing how important it is to play sports lately. My school is so big on sports, so people stick together more easily and become close friends if they have played in the same sport team. I wanna be like my brother so bad. I wanna be really good at, at least, one sport. I SO want to play either basketball or soccer(or lacrosse). But I haven't played any of them in my life. Well, I know some drills in b-ball and soccer, but basically, I just don't know any of those sports well.   My parents and my brother (varsity b-ball and soccer player) say that it's too late for me to try on those 3 sports. My parents say that they can get me a tennis tutor. But I just don't feel like playing tennis. If I'm ever gonna be playing any kind of sport, I want sports containing vigorous physical activities 'cause when I once played b-ball with my brother and his friends, it felt so good after all those running around(refreshing, shoud I say). Tennis seems like such a lame sport and even though I'm a girl, it looks so gay. It doesn't have any physical contact, dorky.   What do you guys think? Should I insist on playing b-ball/soccer/lacrosse (any one of them)? Or should I steer to tennis?

20090203153723AA5DtPq	Sports;Baseball	Barry Bonds the drug cheat?	A urine sample that Barry Bonds submitted as part of Major League Baseball's anonymous testing program in 2003 has come back positive for PEDs, according to a New York Times report.      Bonds provided samples that did not test positive under that program, but the samples were re-examined by federal authorities after they were seized in a 2004 raid, The Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.      Citing a person who has reviewed the evidence in the case, The Times reported last week that authorities detected anabolic steroids in urine samples linked to Bonds that they gathered in their investigation. It remains unclear, the newspaper said, whether the '03 urine sample and the samples seized in the feds' raid in '04 are the same.      Bonds testified to a federal grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative in 2003 that he used "the cream" and "the clear" but did not know they were performance-enhancing drugs. During that testimony, Bonds was asked if he ever took steroids, and he answered no.      The government alleges that Bonds lied under oath. His perjury trial is scheduled to begin March 2 in San Francisco.      Bonds' lawyers filed a motion last month asking Judge Susan Illston, who is presiding over the career home run leader's case, to exclude several pieces of evidence, including those 2003 urine samples.      Illston issued an order Monday saying that, on Wednesday morning, she will unseal some of the evidence gathered by prosecutors in the case. Illston informed defense lawyers she was rejecting their motion to file a series of documents under seal.      The defense had argued that making the material public now could hinder Bonds' ability to get a fair trial. However, Illston said she received a letter from media representatives on Jan. 30 requesting that the sealing order be lifted, and she ruled Monday that releasing the documents would not impair Bonds' Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.

That's what I'm thinking.    Before Michaels retire, they should have a Morrison and Michaels feud. They should make Morrison the new Shawn Michaels.

I would love to see a single Cardinals fan say that Pittsburgh won that game.  That last drive is proof that Roethlisberger is both clutch and a great QB.  The Cardinals played a great game, but the better team won that game.

Seriously, if it wasn't for Yahoo!

Why don't you do what everyone else does, work your azz off in the off-season and go where your coach tells you to go.  If your D1 or D2 or D3 material, you'll find out.  If not, then follow the 98% of the rest of us, get ur high school degree and go to college or get a job or both.  Professional sports aren't for everyone.

20090304203630AAvb40e	Sports;Football (American)	Steeler fans, what is your counterargument?	Here is my argument to why Big Ben isn't elite, yet. To me, there are two ways to judge a quarterback. You judge them by their individual accomplishments such as stats and MVP's. You also judge them by achievements such as Super Bowls, total games won, etc. You can't judge them based on just of of those. We all know Big Ben has the Super Bowls and the games won. And in reality, people will notice that more than just stats. To me winning games is the most overrated aspect of judging a QB. Jake Delhomme has a better winning % than Drew Brees in his career. Does that make Delhomme a better QB. Heck No. Rex Grossman won 13 games one year Jesus Christ. Ben Roethlisberger has had 19 career game winning/tying 4th qtr drives. But the bad part to that is that he has fallen behind when his defense has given up only 16 points per game in his career. He would have been blown out if he had the Lions or Saints defense behind him. Now I'm not saying Roethlisberger is bad. He is very far from being average. He is the best to Tom Brady in the NFL in terms of postseason wins (where he hasn't been relying on his defense as much) and delivering a clutch 4th qtr drive. But his defense has kept him in many games where he could have gotten blown out. Yes he deserves credit for the many games he has won. But it is much easier to win in the NFL when your defense is giving up only 16 PPG rather than let's day 22 PPG. He's really, really good and is a tough and classy guy behind a horrible O-Line. But wins and losses do not tell the whole story, and you know what, neither do stats.    P.S. Rivers hasn't been to the Super Bowl because he lost in the playoffs in his first year starting, just like Roethlisbgerger, to Brady and Belichick, he lost the AFC championship because he was on one knee and had numerous injuries, and he lost to Roethlisberger this year because he didn't have many opportunities to get on the field before he fell behind due to his defense. His one int was a tipped pass.

20090304214738AAOdEFu	Sports;Cricket	Do umpires and match officials have a say?	New Zealand have not made a final decisionon whether to tour Pakistan later this year. It's HIGHLY unlikely, BUT if New Zealand were to go and play in Pakistan, do the umpires and match officicals have a say on going to Pakistan?      "I'm angry that we were isolated. I'm angry that we didn't get the same level of security that the players got. I'm angry that in our hour of need we were left on our own. I'm angry that the team got to the ground and no-one came back for us."   - Simon Taufel      After this attack will we see a reluctance in umpires and match officals travelling to terror struck countries?   Are they given the same rights as the players to just say no?
