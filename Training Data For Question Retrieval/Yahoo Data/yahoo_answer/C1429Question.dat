20090128154818AAtOoBO	Social Science;Psychology	I feel paranoid whenever I'm around people, I need your advice?	Hi I'm a high school student and I feel like there is something wrong with how I think. How can I explain this...I feel like my brain needs to be washed, I feel like being re-borned into someone completely different someone confident, sure of herself, someone less paranoid. I need my sanity back.     How do I begin? um I FEEL LIKE I PUT WAY TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON PEOPLE. When teachers are talking I can't look at them in the eyes for more than five seconds because I stop paying attention to what they're saying and focus more on what they're thinking.     I feel like someone's always looking at me and that makes me constantly nervous. But when I look around (and its often) and I see no one looking at me I feel a little disappointed. Like I want attention and I want people to sort of praise me per say. I want to make friends and laugh, I love to laugh. When I make people laugh I like how it feels because I feel accepted.    If I'm talking to someone, after I say something I look at the expression on their face to see if what I said made a bad impact or not. It shouldn't be like that I should say things with confidence but I just can't.    When I walk around school I also feel paranoid because I feel like I need to walk a certain way and be a certain way..it annoys me I WISH I COULD BE COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO THE PEOPLE AROUND ME. That way I could just say what I feel, think of other more important things (rather than if someone's looking at me or not and making useless connections), feel comfortable, less anxious, etc.    Also, I tend to make some sort of nonverbal connection with someone, anyone in the room I find interesting. Lets see how can I explain this....I just, CONNECT...and it feels like they're looking at me like I feel some sort of tension. And when they actually talk to me I freeze up and end up making a fool of myself by not saying anything or tensing my face up or stuttering. In high school (and anywhere else i think) when you want to meet someone you would just try to make a conversation with them or join in to one. I on the other hand won't do that because its just too much pressure, I get anxious, so I just keep connecting sort of calling them out, but when they finally come, I stumble.    ***What I want is to be sure of myself, I want to be confident enough to go after the people I like and have fun doing it. To not stumble on my words, to not feel anxious, to not be so sensitive and allow people's words/expressions/actions to impact me so much. I want to be oblivious to the people around me, I just want to walk like I normally walk, and just be me without worrying about who's watching me.  I've been like this for a really long time, I've tried but maybe I'm just doing something wrong, please help me.    I feel like I need happiness, and the ONLY time and way I ever feel like this is when I look at someone I like. There's one person I love that I see around school that is in none of my classes. Whenever we cross paths that is the only time I truly feel happy. I need to change NOW, for the sake of meeting them. I hate myself the way I am...

It began scratching my back with its claws which at first, felt pleasurable and then quickly changed into intense pain as my skin was sliced. Much of the dream was focused on the Werewolf's face. This morning I woke up with a sore back and it has been in pain all day. What does this dream mean and what has happened to my back? I would very much like to know what dreams of Werewolves mean alongside interpretations of other factors (ex. the scratching, focus on the back area, the bathroom). Thank-you for your help!

I feel very insecure about myself because of my ex boyfriend, how do I snap out of this?   I'm 35 and was dating a 25 man, after a year we broke up but during that time, I've learned alot about this man. He had a wandering eye, especially to women that were a) young and blonde or b) young with long hair.      Im not hot as I used to be, but its "still" there.      I don't look like barbie, Im a petite brunette.      After getting to know my ex, looking at his myspace page, all the "people" he wanted to meet, hmm let's see.. some Eagles Cheerleader, some WWE Divas, a super model... and radom other stuff. if i go on I might hurl.....      During the time with him, he's checked out women that look nothing like me, sure I understand men look. I got it.      But I've never had a man make me feel so ugly in all my life, I look at pretty younger women shopping, on the internet and I just think: I'm ugly, not even my ex bf who was no gem couldnt keep interest in me for very long. I didn't feel this way before and now everyday I'm suffering from these thoughts and I cant stop.      How do I break out of this "thing" and live life without focusing on what an ex boyfriend lusted after?      I'm imtimidated to talk to pretty women now, I fear them.

20090128170325AADajPb	Social Science;Psychology	The most likely reason that this person was targeted?	I think I shoudl rephrase the question that I asked earlier. Let's say, that a person had been targeted by another person (whose identity the victim does not know). Let's say that some of the people in the proximity of the victim were homosexual, some racist, some ugly, some beautiful. The perpetrators who targeted the individual are homosexual, racist, ugly and beautiful. Yet the reasons that they provide to the victim for carrying out their actions is that the individual is all of what they are. Would you conclude that the chief instigator targeted this person because that person had a specific trait that he/she did not like, or wanted to settle a persona score (since the victim may have intimately known the instigator)? What would be the other alternatives?
20090128170541AAmBN4H	Social Science;Psychology	Why is my brother acting this way?	What could cause my little brother to be so distant? We used to be buddies. Lately he acts like I'm dirt on the bottom of some shoe. I'm 20 and he's 17, so we're pretty close in age. He's over the immature sister-hating stage. I think there's some reason behind it. I've been going through a lot lately health-wise, I'm still living at home and I have had to drop out of 3 university semesters, I am in my first 'official' semester now and only taking 2 classes. I have been very depressed, and it's taken its toll.       I think he has lost lots of respect for me. we live in the same house yet barely speak anymore. he makes stupid jokes in passing, like whenever I say something that has a negative word in it, he'll reflect it back at me. ie, if I were to say "that is so horrible" he'd say "you're so horrible." or if I were to say "well, that's no good" he'd say "you're no good". And I know it might seem like nothing to you, but he does this whenEVER we speak, and says it as though he believes it. there's no humour involved yet he claims to be joking. it hurts. he acts so bloody condescending sometimes. as though I enjoy being sick and not off living my own life.       It is ruining my self-esteem and making me feel like I am incapable, even though I know I should just shrug it off, and I do, it does affect you on some level and it does wear you down. I would never treat him this way. my parents are extremely overprotective, so it's pretty tense living at home. I have no life. what should I do? I can't move out until next fall at the very earliest.

20090128165740AA2yPrG	Social Science;Sociology	Why are people willing to give up their heat before they will give up cell phones or satellite/cable?	I moved into a low income rural area a few years ago, and I have to say that I am ASTOUNDED at the financial choices of some of the very poor people around here.  My brother knows a guy who had his heat turned off for non-payment, but he won't give up his satellite TV, which is over $100 a month! (there is basic cable available for $10 a month, with about 10 channels, otherwise, only 2 broadcast channels. Satellite without HBO etc. is about $55. We live in north central Minnesota and this guy has his heat off). Other people we know around here can't afford the tiny copays on their prescription drugs, but they have cell phones!  And these aren't like Net10 saved for emergencies/occasional issues - they really yakk it up on the things & get the expensive contracts.  Other very poor people we know will drive around all the time, not bothering to combine trips.  This one lady I know drove 30 miles ONE WAY to town, then her husband made the same drive 2 hours later to return library books. This is normal for them! This kind of serious financial mismanagement is pervasive around here - I just don't understand.        None of these folks are poor thru their own fault - most are legitimately disabled - but is it just stupidity (low IQ) or inability to deny yourself things you can't afford, or what? ( FYI my brother and I are disabled too, but we manage our money very strictly.  I'm not bashing poor people here.)

20090128170633AAOO9Jk	Social Science;Economics	10 POINTS - Economics - supply/demand/efficiency/dead weight loss question?	First off, this is homework. It is due. I am frustrated.   I am not asking anyone to do my homework, but the prof was unable to adequately explain this to me and I am frustrated. I have read the question over so many times it has lost meaning.      So anyone that knows, I'd like help/an explanation/ a hint, something.   I am not asking for someone to 'do my homework' for me.   Just wanted to clarify.      The question is supposedly true/false & relates to a simple supply and demand graph (which I can't draw here but will describe).    The graph is set up where the supply curve = MC; and the demand = MB, and the question goes:      "...suppose the government produced extra macaroni on its own less than MC, such that it created an artificially low price P" [see graph]. There is no dead weight loss here - only additional efficiency, given that Q">Q* [quantity supplied is greater than equilibrium quantity]. In other words, the more of a good produced, the higher the efficiency."      Not I can pick out a few false things - like the law of diminishing returns means the more you produce the lower the efficiency.    I do not understand how the govt' producing more of a good would affect supply and demand. The graph he has drawn I think is supposed to be false as well, but I don't know...       On the graph he gives, the new price P" is below equilibrium price and hits the supply and demand curves to the right of the equilibrium point - giving the impression that said government has created a lot of supply and low demand.      I am also not sure about the deadweight loss/excess burden...       Really confused. Anybody who can help me, even in part, even speculation (economically related of course), I appreciate. Thanks~

As i go through more i tend to wonder if what I think is shared with others. Brutal honesty is what im looking for, nothing else.      I notice people in school, at work, during their lunch breaks, or just simply walking. And i notice that they all seem miserable but are too wrapped up in their career to try anything new. When I sit in class I begin to think, when will i use bio chemics to succeed in my life?      And when i start to announce the way i feel about my life i see that TEACHERS and ADULTS along with kids now seem as if they are brainwashed.       I ask them what they have been through in thier life and they seem so ..fragile..so scared to tell me what they have experienced. So i take all the deaths in my family, the depression, suicides and abuse of drugs and just walk around my town.      With these thoughs in my head I often stop people in the street and ask them what they have gone through. Most take the time and share their thoughts with me. For which i tell them i appreciate it greatly while thanking them for thier time.       I most have talked with over 450+ individuals and learned different experiences. I knew how they beat their obsticles and learn that if that were to happen to me i would have more then one road to go down..      I ask if this normal? I highly doubt it, and excuse me for improper grammar and punctuation im simply trying to get my thoughts out before they vanish. Thanks
20090128164224AARde3S	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Do you think that genetic engineering would stop racism?	It seems to me that most of the people that are racist are racist because they believe that other races aren't as intelligent as their own, so say that scientists would find a gene (or genes) that rose peoples' IQs to the same level. They would then give each race this high IQ trait. I know that genetic inheritance of IQ is questionable for some and that some people believe that differences in IQ is 100% due to environmental differences, but hypothetically speaking say that was the case (i.e. the hypothetical scenario I gave above). Do you think it would put a stop to most racism?

20090128175230AAkdL1E	Social Science;Psychology	Dreaming of a very bad man, who's dead now, screaming at us with his throat open?	I had a nightmare two days ago that I can't forget. Anyone is willing to help explain it to me?      My mom was encouraging me to go visit my father, and I was feeling that I didn't want to go. I feel really negative about him and I kept telling her that he's a bad man and I think its a bad idea that she wants to go see him and making me go with her.      Then we were in some hotel room, with some other people (who in the dream were my relatives). Sitting in a row. I look past the people at my mom and I see the terrified look on her face, and I keep thinking that I told her to stay away but now she got all of us in trouble. Then I see this guy in the room, he was my mom's second husband very abusive but he passed away few years ago. I begin freaking out, since I start to understand that he's up to no good and he was going to hurt everyone. I remember sitting down while he starts shouting at everyone (being emotionally abusive as he was in real life). Then he gets in the shower and says "i'll show you how tough I am" and he turns on the boiling hot water and gets under it, to prove his point. I see he has a big gash on his neck and he tears it open and a lot of blood starts running down, he's still shouting and looks pissed. His blood starts spraying everyone in the room including me, its hot as boiling water and burns. I reach for door handle and its open, I ran out and a teenage boy runs after me, I felt that it was my brother (who died at birth) I tell him not to go back in. No one else leaves the room. I run downstairs and see a Rabbi, I ask him for help. He says that he will go and try to calm down the man. Then I notice that I'm naked and I have nothing to cover myself while everyone is staring, I feel like crying but have to stay strong. I go back to the floor and see the door to the room open, I look in and no one is there. I'm very worried what happened to my mother. I try to get some clothes to cover myself and I see all my clothes on the floor of the bathroom where the man was taking the bloody shower. I feel disgusted, but the clothes don't have any blood on then and I find something that's not totally wet to put it on.      Then I wake up.    I never before had a dream like that, with people from the past who are dead.
20090128175421AAlSuoM	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Nightmare with people from my life?	I had a nightmare two days ago that I can't forget. Anyone is willing to help explain it to me?      My mom was encouraging me to go visit my father, and I was feeling that I didn't want to go. I feel really negative about him and I kept telling her that he's a bad man and I think its a bad idea that she wants to go see him and making me go with her.      Then we were in some hotel room, with some other people (who in the dream were my relatives). Sitting in a row. I look past the people at my mom and I see the terrified look on her face, and I keep thinking that I told her to stay away but now she got all of us in trouble. Then I see this guy in the room, he was my mom's second husband very abusive but he passed away few years ago. I begin freaking out, since I start to understand that he's up to no good and he was going to hurt everyone. I remember sitting down while he starts shouting at everyone (being emotionally abusive as he was in real life). Then he gets in the shower and says "i'll show you how tough I am" and he turns on the boiling hot water and gets under it, to prove his point. I see he has a big gash on his neck and he tears it open and a lot of blood starts running down, he's still shouting and looks pissed. His blood starts spraying everyone in the room including me, its hot as boiling water and burns. I reach for door handle and its open, I ran out and a teenage boy runs after me, I felt that it was my brother (who died at birth) I tell him not to go back in. No one else leaves the room. I run downstairs and see a Rabbi, I ask him for help. He says that he will go and try to calm down the man. Then I notice that I'm naked and I have nothing to cover myself while everyone is staring, I feel like crying but have to stay strong. I go back to the floor and see the door to the room open, I look in and no one is there. I'm very worried what happened to my mother. I try to get some clothes to cover myself and I see all my clothes on the floor of the bathroom where the man was taking the bloody shower. I feel disgusted, but the clothes don't have any blood on then and I find something that's not totally wet to put it on.      Then I wake up.   I never before had a dream like that, with people from the past who are dead.

He hates me and he's THE most popular guy in school so other people follow him and don't like me as well, or at least wont talk to me when he's around.      It feels like it's me against the world at this point idk I mean right when I thought I had everything great: a new guy, a great bestfriend. it all crashes down on me.      Has anyone ever been through anything similar or have any advice for me. Btw I'm a quiet girl I don't bother people so I don't understand.

20090128181336AAs01yO	Social Science;Psychology	Serious Question: How to determine or verify whether strong feeling of dead friend's presence is genuine.?	For the past several months I have had the strong but intermittent feeling that the presence of a deceased but very close friend is nearby.  I have repeatedly attempted to verify this sensation with EVP to no avail.  (Usually EVP works rather well for me with other entities at other locations.  I am somewhat sensative to entities when searching for them, though no feeling has ever been this strong or defined.)  I am unwilling to attempt contact using a ouija board due to my lack of experience and inability to locate anyone willing to make the attempt with me.  Any suggestions as to other methods by which I could determine whether this sense is genuine would be greatly appreciated.  Please note that this is a serious question and is to be treated as such.  Sarcasm or derision shall be neither appreciated nor tolerated.  Thank you.
