e0e20b5ef049b927795b392a2617bd2aaa	I have watched a few programs on this, but your guy is gonna have to be willing to try it.  He can do some excercises to help increase his time.  Have him get an erection, then have him put a wash cloth over it, like hang it on there.  Then have him like lift it.  Contract those muscles.  Have him do this a couple times a week.  That should help.    Also another way to help, it when you guys are having sex, when he feels as though he is getting close, have him stop and hold his penis tight, to make it go limp again, then start over, like get back into things.  Then do the same thing.  It might be kinda annoying the begining but it will pay off after a couple of weeks.      Hope this helps|`|e13fed2e8765acf54f8b4a5d008b8c42aa	go see your doctor he will prescribe something for you|`|AA11938888	swam you ovbiously don't understand the physiology of a woman and who could perform under someone that selfish.|`|AA12235694	Bath twice a day and stop reading , watching things which may make happen|`|AA12218436	No, women need to stop being so greedy in bed.

A urologist is a physician who has specialized knowledge and skill regarding problems of the male and female urinary tract and the male reproductive organs.|`|440755957b51e38f7360edbf982595c7aa	the stoppng starting method     easist thing to do is jerk off earlier in the day it will take you longer to ejaculate a 2nd or maybe 3rd time|`|AA11149875	I'm not aware of any drugs to take, but I'm sure your doctor can help you out.    I would suggest a natural way instead of putting drugs into your body.  If you go to a adult novelty shop or sex shop as they're also called you can ask for something that is called a c o c k ring.  It is a plastic stretchy ring that is placed over the penis and rests on the base of the penis.  The purpose of the "ring" is to squeeze the penis tightly at the base thus causing the blood to remain in the penis causing a longer erection.  Keep in mind though that the ring is only to be on for 20 minute intervals at a time.    Another natural way of preventing premature ejaculation is to ejaculate in private before you spend time with your girlfriend/wife.  Bascially masturbate before you're with her.  Then when you see her you won't get horny as quickly.  There will be time for foreplay without you ejaculating.    I would try the natural ways first before seeing a doctor for a prescription.    Also:  just to add.  A c o ck ring is about $5 - $10 to purchase.
AA10796620	Good for you that you stumbled upon a nice guy!  :)  If he's a nice guy and he does things for you that make you uncomfortable, then, maybe you should just take a hold of yourself, relax, and enjoy the fact that you've finally become lucky and met a great guy!  What one person said here is correct  - you're probably not just accustomed to being treated so well by a good guy so the longer you two get together, then, maybe, you'll get used to it.  Good luck!  :)|`|AA10339249	Makes me curious...what does he do?

If he's as sensitive as you say, he will understand and you two can work on it.|`|bc3740b818721af3d29ce184e9ee05feaa	It's hard to say without any specific details, but you could try talking to him about it. If he really is sensitive -- that is, sensitive to your feelings and not just to his own -- he will understand, or at least try to. Of course, if the problem is just that you're not used to these things, then the longer you're with him, the more you'll get used to them.    Also, you might want to focus on the things that you do enjoy, and perhaps focus on things that he seems to enjoy in the relationship -- maybe he is uncomfortable sometimes too, maybe he hasn't dated a girl like you before.|`|7acb43db4356066048a954e687f3da99aa	i bet hes gay.|`|AA11284466	do just that get over it, u will in your lifetime wonder where are all the good guys are when u run him off.  mark my word u might want the bad boy right now, but the bad boy has never made any woman happy for life.

Dalk kan jy dit 'n reality maak. Doen iets romanties,ek het een keer 'n klein piekniek gehou vir my bf, net ek en hy,in die huis,op die vloer.

Jy weet seker nou al waarvan hy hou,so doen dit maal 10! Hoop dit help bietjie.|`|AA12021701	Okay from the front door you should leave a trail of rose petals leading to the bedroom.

Don't worry about it, as long as it's mutual, go with your heart. Older men are wiser, more willing to understand you, and have the security (usually) of a job, a house, and a car. I don't want to sound shallow, because I'm not, but in this day in age that's really important to have in a guy. Stability is becoming rare, so if he has it, and you both love eachother..no worries!|`|d792197b56ddff9b91d955492f7e4666aa	What's wrong with that? You like what you like.

I dated someone 11 years younger than me - she pursued me.  I found out her father was an alcoholic and in a subconscious level, she wanted to resolve that poor daddy relationship with me as her substitute 'daddy'.      On the other hand, if you are of consenting age and find a guy that is also attracted to you - what is wrong with it?|`|2b6769b4097d023b408accbd41ea4c35aa	First of all, how old are you?    I have always liked older men even when I first started dating at the age of 16.  My parents disapproved so when they found out the guys ages they would make me stop dating them.  I finally married a guy my age and that did not work out.  When I was 25 I met a man older than me.  We dated for 3 years and now we are happily married for the past 5 years. He is 10 1/2 years older than me!  Depending on how old you are depends on if its okay to be with an older man.  There is a big age difference between 16 and 21 or 18 and 30... maturity levels differ greatly.

593f717507c9c30ec85a070ee728e9a7aa	Well I scorn on both sexes who have sex just for "fun." Sex is meant to be just with that one special person. I believe pre-marital sex is a terrible things and it leads to single parents, more STD's and the spread of prostitution. I will not have sex until i am married. I have a gf but we have both agreed that we will both stay virgins until after marriage. (seriously we are both virgins) I hate the fact that women get scorned for that yet men do not. I do not think either sex should do this. It just shows you that there is still that hint of male superiority in our society.
e2023980e76f8f01d5ba81251c994b7caa	Little sister, people are only going to treat you the way you allow them to treat you.  You have to love yourself enough to demand to be treated better.  Say it with me little sister.  I'M WORTHY ENOUGH TO BE TREATED BETTER THAN THIS...I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW TO GO ON ANY FURTHER!    A little advise little sister.  You have control over your life and who's in it.  If you come across someone that is not treating you the way you feel you should be treated.....Don't allow them in your space.  You also need to think  about what your actions may have to do with situations like these.  You may UNINTENTIONALLY be attracting these sorts of dudes.   Maybe it's time to do a little re-evaluating love.  Think about the clothes you wear, the places you go and the people that you hang out with.   Think about these dudes you're talking about.    Get a peice of paper and write this down.   How are these guys all alike?  Do all of them treat you the same way?  Make sure you're able to identify the characteristics of these types of guys. So the next you come around them you'll know.  You'll remember that paper and be like, "Wait a minute, this guy is just like the other guys.  Let me leave him alone because I know I won't like what he's about".  Get out another sheet of paper.  Write down the characteristics of a guy you would like to be with.  For example.....  I want a guy that reads something other than Maxim magazine.  I want a guy who can actually conversate with me on any topic from politics to reperations to pirates.  I want a guy who's physically active and eats right.  I want a guy who's funny.  He's gotta make me laugh.  I want a guy who has ambitions and goals.  I want a guy who is responsible and goes to work everyday  I think you get where i'm going.  And lastly little sister, it's not fair to want to ask for so many good qualities from a person and you not being able to deliver the same qualities.  You also need to be edgucated, sophisticated, classy, cultured, knowledgable, nurturing, caring, ambitious and have goals of your own.    Keep ahold of that list  of good qualities and make sure the men you date have at least half of them.  You'll hit the jackpot sooner than you think.  I hope this helps you little sister.  Best of luck to you.|`|AA10067174	because u let then use u like a trophy ........|`|AA11990068	We don't think too high of our selves now do we? "life is so hard for us pretty people".

If a guy ever does that to you dump him immediately. That is the way MOST guys are. They just look for trophies to add to their collection. You should be more strict with the guys you hang around with. Try not to get into relationships with them until you both know each others personality really well.

I joined band but i never went to lessons. Once i got in high school i loved band. I got closser to the kids in my class. I became popular. Alot of kids know me know. I had to find the group where i fit it. It just happend to be in band. Then becaus of band i became more popular because of the kids in band i was hanging out with had other friends. I became friends with thoes friends and so on and so on. You are NOT a loser. Just find your self in a group that will like you for who you are.    A friend who was once there,  Ashley

da70a6c0a1fa277bf6fdfcb2bd855c80aa	keep trying.    be friendly, not pushy; look for the positive aspects of others; identify things you have in common (everyone has something in common with everyone else) and i've noticed people usually feel more comfortable when you point these things out; also, many people like talking about themselves, so ask them friendly, casual questions about themselves.  if you think of a joke, or something funny (in a good way), share it.  even if it is reeaallyy hard, say something - ('did you see that bug?' 'what did you think about that _____ we had for lunch?'  'do you have any pets at home?'  whatever - and then, if it looks like the person is friendly, try to keep talking with them for a minute or two or three . . when people see you are friendly, they will probably want to talk with you and be friends.  or maybe they are feeling really uncomfortable themselves, and by talking with them, you are really helping them out.  you never know what a difference you can make for someone else (even if they still act like they don't want to be friends).    don't worry.  it does get easier with time.  and you will get better at it, too.  going to camp sounds like a good way to practice.  (actually, our whole lives we are still practicing - it seems there is always more to learn about building good relationships with peole.)  good luck!!    i haven't looked at the website, so i don't know if it is a good one or not, but you might want to check this out:  http://www.shykids.com/shykidsfriends.ht...|`|AA10136499	Relax, be yourself and whatever you do don't force yourself on anybody.....

MSKLQJTeaa	At work, The definition of sexy attire is something that leaves something to the imagination and does not reveal too much. Being politically correct and appropriate in the work setting is important. Too much cleavage definitely misrepresents a woman, as do skirts that are too short or too tight. As a man, I would have to say that well fitting, well thought out clothes inspire me.<br>  At play, something that could be best described as teasing, such as an outfit that compliments ones figure. For example, shorts that compliment ones legs, a shirt that is not too tight but that once again compliments the figure. It is all about accentuating what you have without laying it all out there for public consumption. A secret is that guys like other men to see their significant others as attractive, and there is a thin line between sexy and sleazy and I hope I am clarifying it.<br>  In the kitchen which is ones private zone, the mind can come up with a million answers. So a few would suffice, an apron with nothing underneath seems an ample appetizer for fun later. Boyshorts are fast becoming the one piece of attire that men like as it accentuates the curves of a nice derrier. This is the one area that ones imagination can run wild. Saran wrap creatively utilized can cause a combustion of sorts, putting it on is sensual, taking it off can be a walk on the wild side. All the outfits one has could always come in handy such as the "no underwear when cooking or dishwashing rule" added to the "short short skirt rule while cooking or dishwashing on mondays, wednesdays, Fridays, Saturday and Sunday" could steam up the windows a bit. In the kitchen, just as with cooking, creativity is the boon.<br>  In the bedroom, anything goes, once again boyshorts are at the top of the list, but keep it interesting, lingerie that shows and yet hides (lace, negligees) are definitely a turn on and in the absence of all else, turn off the lights get naked and wait under the sheets and everything will go as desired.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Mike|`|1zPVASkZaa	the lady look sexy in their Bedroom. because the way they sleep or move here& there on bed it looks nice or u can say just like Antramali the actress in film GAYAB.|`|3fd4321191c3947f2938ff72e6bc07c8aa	well its depand on woman not every woman looking sexy in those dresses....some womans looking sexy @ wokring dress (depand on woman fefure) and some looking sexy in the bedroom.....but if u asked me woman looking sexy in............... jeans(tight) and top(littel one).thast make me crazy.....anyway hope u got ur answer miss time pass|`|5pRzJcy8aa	Always her panties because when she takes them off you can still taste her.|`|AA11717279	scottish skirts wawwwwwwww i love them <br>  u knw the red and black|`|b2b2af4b5b801d020ca8947502620843aa	I really like those business type suits that women wear with that split on the side of their skirt.<br>  <br>  Also those tight gym outfits 3/4 pants where you can see the beautiful shape of their legs and bum<br>  <br>  Last but not least i like nickers they don't even have to be those sexy lingerie ones, I just like those pink and white nickers with the pictures of flowers or little bears on them with the frilly seem.    <br>  God that's so hot, why did you have to make me think of that stuff i don't have a girlfriend ah! so frustrating!|`|f53d69c30c7be875370ab31d005c6509aa	Well if we make it more general I can say:<br>  1.

But here are some tips on flirting.     To begin with, there are five attitudes and seven skills you will need to become a great flirt.  For the most part, with flirting, it is mostly in your delivery.     Most women will get the man because of their great attitude towards life; this is very attractive.  Being a good looker and maybe clever with words is worthless if your attitude is poor, energy is low and your outlook about your life is pessimistic . Be optimistic not pessimistic about the event or activity and the outcome of the day.    Your attitude depends on your state of mind and through our research and experience we have identified five states of mind that make up a great flirting attitude.  Adopting a good flirtatious attitude and applying it to the skills you will learn will ensure you become a truly great flirt.    The five states of mind or attitudes are:       * playfulness       * fun       * taking notice       * loving people       * go for it.    In turn each of these attitudes contain certain ingredients:       * playfulness - light-hearted, high-spirited, little mischievous, frisky, teasing in a good way.       * fun - witty, entertaining, lively, willing to play the game.       * taking notice - observing, aware of the other person, showing an interest.       *loving people - appreciation, acceptance, curiosity, gregarious, social.       * go for it - taking risks/take action, liberated, optimistic, opportunistic.    Being playful and light-hearted makes the flirting safe but allows for a little naughtiness.  Using fun attracts people, they are drawn to the energy.  Taking notice allows the flirt to learn about the other person and show an interest, making the other person feel special and appreciated.    Our research has shown that many great flirts have a lot of friends of the opposite sex.  Great flirts love people - male flirts love and have an affinity for women; female flirts love and have an understanding of men.  Flirts also know how to go for it.  They are not afraid to take risks because they have let go of past hurts and are optimistic about themselves and other people.      There was study done with kids learning to play basketball.  The researchers divided the kids up into two groups.  One group got to go straight on the court and start shooting hoops.  The other group had to sit out on the sideline but were instructed to visualize the ball going in the hoop - how they would need to stand and how they would need to feel to get the ball in the hoop.  They were also told to believe they could get that ball in the hoop.  Both groups were then asked to take a series of shots at the hoop.  The group that had been practicing did pretty well but the group that had been sitting on the sideline getting their attitude right, well, they blitzed it.  There have been studies on adults trying to attract the opposite sex using visualizing techniques and affirmations.  These adults used these techniques most of the week and before going out to approach, attract, and get that phone number or even have sex.  The adults that used these techniques had 71% better results than the groups that did not use visualizing and affirmations.     You can change your attitude by changing what you think and how you feel.  To be playful you just have to think playful and feel playful.  If you don't particularly feel playful right now, think back to a time when you did.  Notice what you were thinking and feeling then.  Become aware of how just thinking of a time when you were acting playful causes you to feel playful now.    Another way of getting the right attitude is to imagine what it would be like to already be there, have it.  If you were going to be playful, how would you stand, how would you breathe, what would you be thinking and doing?    When you are feeling playful you are light-hearted, high-spirited, mischievous, frisky and teasing.  How would you be if you were feeling like this?    The same process works for the other four attitudes.  Fun is similar to playfulness.  Taking notice is when you turn up your senses so that you can tune in to people.  To love people, think  of those people you already accept and really appreciate - how do you feel when you are around them?  Now imagine looking at everybody you meet in the same way.    Have you ever been in a situation where you just went for it?  You had nothing to lose and everything to gain, your heart and mind both agreed that this was the right thing to do and you were the right person to do it.  This is the "go for it" state of mind and it is the way great flirts live.|`|AA11006063	Don't feel dumb.|`|8ab375d3103ffb3eca97b5a527edc2f2aa	girl your not dumb its just no guy has stolen your heart yet dont let it get to you because once you have one trustme sometimes it aint so great just wait someone will come along and treat like you should be treated.|`|AA12116512	UUMMMMM, get a boyfriend|`|AA12020399	Dont feel so dumb, there is nothing wrong with that.|`|813a80415c474e102e2187afee926d67aa	Why feel dumb, it is probably not your time right now.

I think you should talk to your gf and tell her that you want to talk to her dad. Go to her house, and ask her dad if he can just spend a few minutes of his time to get to know the boy that is with his little girl. Explain to him how much you respect and enjoy speding time with her. You hae to go above and beyond on this one. Tell him that you are really a good guy and that   you guys are very happy together. Call your girlfriend in and tell her to explain how she feels. Be honest with whatever you say and make sure that if you were a father of a girl, you would like what her boyfriend would have to say. Good luc!|`|AA10042617	You should expect the dad to be a bit protective of his daughter.  Just remember to keep your heads.  He is the one that is keeping a roof over her head at night and let him know that he has your respect and honesty.  <br>  Oh, by the way,  You'll feel the same way when guys start looking at your daughter.|`|pGOvVUu2aa	Some fathers are like that.

AA10615206	what you need to do is reverse the roles you both have in this relationship, meaning: try to put yourself in his place.  If you didnt call for 2 days after an arguement with your boyfriend then what HAVE you been doing with your time?  Plus what is going thru your mind regarding him?  I know when i try to see things thru others eyes a sometimes get a swift bitchslap of reality, at what you will get here if you only would take a step back and observe.  I would be done with this guy, or at least put him in a lower spot on your cares list.  I think that He shouldnt need to appologize, but he should at least call to say he is alive.  And remember, as all relationships have there ups and downs this will not be the last, when it happens again, do you want to be left hanging for who knows how many days? wondering? waiting? wailing? wishing?  because as you get further into it you will have more emotions that can be hurt by this type of situation.  So as I think, you should start shopping fro a newer model boyfriend.  good luck!|`|AA10687058	He could be cheating ya never know i would just forget about him and move on|`|1b793ca8852f421619c5e4e880e120eeaa	If i were you i'd call him and tell him that you're sorry.because if you're wiating on him to do it.sorry to say you're going to be waiting a long time.|`|AA11104967	"So called boyfriend"...."really love this man".....which is it? You're so sure it was his fault huh? Usually takes two to tango....stupid has no e in it stupid.|`|AA11939205	no, he's not stupid, he's probably playing the same silly stupid game your playing...seeing who will give in first! you may want to call him, cause if he's as young as you sound, he'll be looking for someone to take your place in about another day or two...then who wins?|`|AA11921172	he's not stupid, stubborn maybe-  if you truly feel that he should be apologizing and he has not called you DO NOT call him- that will only make him think that he can do what he wants and you will still be there- wait it out!!! and if he doesnt call, then he is making the mistake and he will have to live with the never knowing...|`|AA11000394	yeah maybe he's stupid but he is a man dont expect him 2 call first it would damage his pride call him i wouldn't hurt u will it? U SAY U LOVE HIM SO CALL HIM AND RESOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.|`|b0832da78665372134e1c3361592f152aa	Call him and tell him you want to talk|`|AA11396327	no hes probally just shy you should call him|`|AA11107363	Maybe he's just really really mad at you, and doesn't want to talk to you still.  Maybe he apologizes a lot and makes the first move to make up a lot and he's sick of it, and he's waiting for you to call him.  Maybe he thinks its YOUR fault that you fought and he's waiting for YOUR call, and wondering why you aren't calling.  Maybe he's just stubborn.    Whatever the reason, just call him, and see what's up.  No one here knows what's going through his head, you have to ask him yourself.  When you call, don't demand an apology, just say you missed him these last couple of days, and take it from there.|`|0fb47df0cc925f49516f04b0a22059b9aa	i can tell from the way you're wording the question that you're one of these immature, possibly stuck up, full of herself little girls. you're playing a dam game, saying "He was at fault and should be apologizing. i haven't called him because I feel that he should call me first." for gods sake grow up. you say you love him, then ask "Could he just be that stupied?" yeah you really sound like you love him.   you probably only think you're right, he's probably tired of the way you act or treat him. when a guy feels he's at fault for something he apologizes right away. so keep telling yourself your right and playing your game. also say good by to your boyfriend too.  i may not have answered that the way you would want me too. I'd love to make all my answers to sound like rainbows and flowers. but sometimes, the blunt and honest truth of the situation is what has to be pointed out.

69a5ece8f0ebd5c71b968c1e946fcde1aa	Not being a girl, I would probably be unable to answer your question properly. However, in your case, the better question is what would you like to happen? As long as it doesn't violate any major limits of hers, feel free to have your way with her. After all, being submissive means that one surrenders some control over the situation that they might otherwise have over to another person, and you would be that person.    However, I think that you may be fishing for ideas as to what you would like to do. In that case, let me see if I can guess. :-) I suspect that a lot of women would be willing to be tied up, but not to the point where it causes pain. I also guess that spanking would be a common desire, and as the buttocks have decent padding, it can be on the hard side. Sensory deprevation (blindfolds, ear plugs) would be a big turn-on for some. Being tickled works for some women but not for others.    Role-playing is also a common desire. Some women would find it arousing being made into a sex object. Worshiping a Master as his feet works for some, but it can be a turn-off for others. I suspect that playing the role of the naughty school girl who is sent to the principal's office, or being the fleeing felon who is arrested by a police officer would be common.    You may just simply ask your girlfriend what she would be excited by. After all, she is handing you virtual carte blanche over her, and I wouldn't be surprised if she intentionally lost whatever contest that you had intentionally! ;-)|`|AA12339925	We dream about ironing out the kinks of course|`|cc4a6d9e47d4af24b80cef487851d43eaa	Be tied up and tormeted|`|22d2fef0cf03eb73be1ae026af932d24aa	Well...tie her up, do her till she beg you to stop, but dun stop, instead stop a while, do it slower, when she reach the top, lower the rhytim, start from the very beginning till she collapse! good?|`|9a5d38bba48e34ed4012fe46b6b0ffd3aa	three penises one for each whole|`|2ac95eee95aecb09a64e6428786dd45aaa	Sextoys, pleasure, orgasms....

Also, if you were going at it for a long time, eventually it might dry up.  All depends on the girl.    If a little extra is needed for vaginal intercourse, I recommend Astroglide, because it is very light.    For anal, I recommend Maximus, because it will stick with you for the long haul.    Both are water based for ease of use (my preference).

Por eso amiga, tu y ella deben respetar eso,  ese lugar que ahora el fisicamente ya no ocupa pero espiritualmente siempre llenar.

If your relative "lives" life, enjoys her mother and family now while everyone is alive.

As far as food, what does he like?, some easy finger foods, you can get chummy by feeding each other, it is sensual and (wink) a little exotic. Buy some fresh strawberries, a must! If he likes certain cheeses, they are great, served with gourmet crackers or bakery french breads or croissant's. I would bring a radio/CD player, and play some favorite songs, appropriate for the mood. Honestly, I am not sure about the gift idea? Are you celebrating an anniversary, Birthday, etc.? If this is a "just because" occasion and you want to express your feelings, I don't know if you really need a gift. I don't know how serious your romantic relationship is, but if you are at the beginning stages of dating, I would consider whether a gift is really necessary, and if you decide on yes, then keep it in accordance with your relationship status.

Ich wei? jedoch nicht, was Dein Problem ist. Man kann in den letzten Minuten auch über etwas ganz anderes nachdenken. Es kann ganz banal sein.

Und ihr wi?t nicht, dass ihr hier und jetzt im Himmel seid, weil ihr ihn nicht erfahren habt. Für euch ist das ein Teufelskreis. Ihr k?nnt nicht erfahren - habt noch keinen Weg dorthin gefunden -, was ihr nicht wi?t, und ihr wi?t nicht, was ihr noch nicht erfahren habt. Erleuchtung verlangt von euch, etwas zu wissen, was ihr nicht erfahren habt, und es somit zu erfahren. Wissen ?ffnet die Tür zur Erfahrung - und ihr stellt euch vor, dass es andersherum ist. Tats?chlich wi?t ihr sehr viel mehr, als ihr erfahren habt. Ihr wi?t einfach nicht, dass ihr wi?t. Ihr wi?t zum Beispiel, dass ein Gott existiert. Aber unter Umst?nden wi?t ihr nicht, dass ihr dies wi?t. Also wartet ihr weiterhin auf die Erfahrung. Doch die ganze Zeit über habt ihr sie schon. Ihr habt sie, ohne es zu wissen - was damit gleichbedeutend ist, sie gar nicht zu haben. Also der Punkt ist :"ich wei? das du wei?t, dass in jeglicher Art von sterben der Mütter an ihre Kinder denken. Soviel wie eine sterbende Mutter mit einem Sohn, an ihm denkend die Welt verl?sst".|`|nSxwBvZjaa	nein das wird sie niemals tun!!!|`|r1Ozg6FEaa	Mich würde interessieren, wieso du gerade diese Frage stellst. Ich habe einmal erlebt, dass eine alte Frau einfach nicht sterben konnte, obwohl sie sehr krank war und lange leiden musste. Schlie?lich fand ich heraus, dass sie mit ihrem Sohn verkracht war und gerne ihren Frieden mit ihm gemacht h?tte. Mit Hilfe der Schwiegertochter gelang es, den Sohn ans Sterbebett seiner Mutter zu bringen. So konnte er die letzte Bitte seiner Mutter erfüllen, und sie konnte in Frieden gehen.

9vIBD4oJaa	I agree with you and although they just want you to be happy I don't think in order to be happy you have to lower your standards. So keep your head up and you will find a man with no children, a good job, and self esteem. it's a crazy idea but I am sure it's possible!! Don't lower yourself because they did, don't keep a man around just because you don't want to be alone a no good man is just the same as being alone! You still have to do it all by yourself and pay for him too!|`|AA11118580	Do you live in a small town, or the bible belt?  That kind of mentality seems stupid and antiquated to me!  I'm 29, and actually the majority of my close friends are single, and have no children.  People that think you NEED to get married and have kids right away, have to think that way or else they'd have too much cognitive dissonance.  Their families are most likely the only thing in their lives that they have to be proud of, so they need to think that having children and a man is the most important thing in the world - if they thought that education and career success were the most important things, they'd be forced to come to the conclusion that their lives were meaningless.  I am not trying to put down getting married and having children - those are things that I want to do - but I want to be successful FIRST, because trying to advance my career and education AFTER having children is a lot harder than doing it while you are still single and childless.  You still have plenty of time- times have changed!  Plenty of people have kids after 35, or around 40 now (if you DO want to go that route).  And you're never to old to have a boyfriend - my great grandma had a new boyfriend in her 80s.  Both of my parents remarried around age 50.  My conclusion - they are most definitely jealous.<br>  <br>  Also, have you ever had a woman who has a successful career, and children, tell you that you need to hurry up and get married and have kids?  I doubt it, I sure as hell haven't.  If you're at all logical, that just proves my point.|`|M1EH1HM4aa	I agree with you.  They aren't your friends if they can't stand up for you even though your lifestyle doesn't agree with theirs. It's how you feel about yourself that is important.

AA12198711	Why do you have to be polite? He is not showing you respect in the first place by calling you "mom" when in fact he knows and you know he is not you're son-in-law, yet! It is a of him making himself look good in you're eyes and I would not trust it one bit. Sneaky ways are sneaky ways no matter how you look at them.<br>  <br>  Just tell him point blank that you are not his mother or mother-in-law and you would appreciate it if he would address you as Mrs. ______.<br>  <br>  Expect respect from them. They in return should respect you.|`|AA11996507	Don't make a big issue out of it.  He is probably calling you that because you make him feel welcome and at home.  Just say laughingly:  "You know, I do remember distinctly only giving birth to one child.

It would mean that they feel comfortable enough around you to call you mom, even if they have one.<br>  <br>  If it makes you that uncomfortable, and apperently he's that comfortable around you, just tell him that you're not ready for him to call you mom yet. Depending on how long they've been dating, and how old they are, and if he has a living mom(that's really a mom, and just "the birth mother), should also be brought up. If they've been together for a while, then tell him that they aren't married yet, and you're not suggesting they get married, and it's an uneasy word for him to call you. If he doesn't have a mother, then try to put in consideration the fact that he cares enough about you, to think of you as his mother. He probly doesn't think that it's bothering you, because he's so comfortable around you.<br>  You can always get your daughter to tell him to call you by your first name. She'd probly have an easier time with it then you. But if you want to say it, then just simply say that you're not comfortable with it, and that you prefer that he call you "Jane" instead. It's not that you don't appreciate the fact that he's comfortable around you, it's just that you don't feel right being called mom by him, when a) he has his own living, decent mother, or b) you aren't his mother.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|631af35ac9b16fb8e10ebf32c28df813aa	i think you should just come out with it  he will understand  just tell him it makes you feel uneasy i hope it works out for you in the end.<br>   honesty is the best policy dont you think .|`|AA11632563	next time he says it ... look around like ur looking for someone and then say where? i dont see ur mom.. or just simply tell him  im not ur mom.....  or talk to ur daughter tell her how it makes u feel|`|d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	Perhaps you could tell him nicely that you prefer it that he call you by your first name.<br>  <br>  Some guys are like that and they do it out of respect and they want to be loved and accepted by you.<br>  <br>  You could also say provided that you honestly feel that way that you are reserving that right to the man that marries your daughter.

Just politely come out with it.  If you're not comfortable telling him, tell your daughter.
eAHnyvJYaa	Well, if you still feel you are not ready for the attention, don't do it, and if you really feel like you do want to kiss him, do it (but if he pushes you further, DON'T, cause you'll know that's all he wants from you) ... If he's acting "all weird and lovey-dovey" and you really don't like that, just forget it, because chances are he will always be like that. And at 13, you still have your whole life ahead of you. If you don't REALLY want to be with this guy, just don't be with him, and you'll eventually find someone you really do want to be with.|`|53e2ec9d500a1e40c31049a6ec1b8c1baa	I would say to him that you just want to be friends at the moment as you want to spend as much time on your school work, hobbies and seeing your other friends.|`|bCLyvjCMaa	if you dont want him then keep saying no and tell him to leave you alone... if you do like him back and want to be with him( i dont think you should) then go back with him|`|kpKHwj5Yaa	if u do like dis boy ,, play hard to get,, thats wot most grls do and it seems to work lol and if ur not ready tell him ur not intreasted so he dosent get the wrong idea ,,i dont think ppl can be gd friends after being going out with each other,, not if 1 party feels more 4 the other ,, hope this helps xx

SnWvaSU0aa	Como varón, te digo que una vez me pasó que salía con una chica de la que estaba enamorado. Pero hasta ahí, nunca habíamos hablado de mi trabajo. Un buen día, me dijo que tenía el día libre, y que tenía ganas de ir a buscarme a la salida de mi trabajo. Le di la dirección (la de un supermercado bien grande, en la zona norte de Buenos Aires.). Le dije que entrara directamente al salon de ventas que ahí me encontraría. Cuando llegó la hora, yo andaba por uno de los pasillos, y de pronto la vi. Nos vimos. Ella estaba "divina". Se había puesto "lo mejor" de su vestuario. Y yo, yo estaba con mi guardapolvo azul, todo salpicado con harina, y encima tenía en mis manos una bolsa inmensa de papel donde venían embalados varios paquetes de 1 kg de harina, y lo estaba doblando en cuatro para desecharlo, pues mi última tarea del día, antes de retirarme, era mantener lleno el stock de la marca de harinas de la empresa para la que trabajaba como repositor de supermercados.  Me impactó su "belleza", pero me dio miedo su "cara". Poco a poco se acercó, y me dijo en voz baja "?qué hacés?, yo... pensé que.... eras gerente!!".<br>  Yo sonreí, algo molesto, pues me sentí discriminado, y le dije que me esperara, que me cambiaba y nos ibamos. Cuando sali a la calle allí estaba. Yo había aprendido en la vida que la mejor forma de salir de los peores lugares sociales, era utilizando el humor. "?No te gusta que sea gerente de la mejor harina de este pais?"  Le dije con una sonrisa. Ella se rió un buen rato, y por momentos ponía cara de "?cuando se lo cuente a mis amigas!".  Mi buena trayectoria de seductor me salvó de conservar la relación, porque la quería mucho. Y ella tenía dos nenas de su anterior relación, por lo que "mucho no podía exigir". Nuestra relación se arruinó, el día en que, superenamorado, la cité a un bar muy fino en la zona de Olivos (Pcia de Bs As), en donde mi mejor sorpresa iba a ser mostrarle un poema que había escrito en honor a ella. Cuando vino al principio todo bien. En un momento dado le entregué el poema. Y cuando terminó de leerlo, me dijo: "?Y con esto pensás mantener a mis hijas?".<br>  "Perdón! no sabía que buscabas una buena inversión!, primero menosprecias mi trabajo, y ahora mi arte?". Le saqué la hoja de las manos, me levanté y me fui.  Y nunca más quise volver a verla.<br>  Con los a?os, la vida me fue de a poco, subiendo escalones en la sociedad. Y hoy puedo decir que soy mi propio jefe.<br>  Pero mi conclusión, humilde por cierto, es que el trabajo no hace a la calidad de la persona, lo único que hace el trabajo en un ser humano, es darle "identidad". Todos los hombres necesitan "pertenecer" a "una manada". Lo que observo a veces, es que cuanta más alta sea la categoría de trabajo de un hombre, más baja es la calidad de la mujer que le pretende.  <br>  Respuesta más honesta, no me sale. Un beso.|`|FjmnNU3aaa	Hola:<br>  Creo que depende de la persona porque hay personas que viven aparentando lo que no y muchas que son profesionistas capacitados y no por ello te tratan indiferente porque si deberas le interesas a una persona esa persona desde ese momento te da tu lugar y tu espacio independientemente del puesto que tenga y de quien sea.<br>  Saludos|`|R42kmrYGaa	Si es muy importante por yo estoy vendiendo violecta faviani y avon y me ayuda mucho tener mi ganacia porque yo me compro lo yo quiero.|`|nTuXVvUdaa	Pienso que si es importante el trabajo, no es lo mismo decir robo carteras en la calle a soy médico.<br>  No es lo mismo ser secuestrador, que empleado, imagínate con mucha plata, pero siempre huyendo, mejor un trabajo donde puedas dormir tranquilo.|`|nNzkjfGFaa	Estoy de acuerdo con plasti04. Pero si en realidad tiene un trabajo o una profesión ,para el ser humano es importante realizarse y si se siente realizado con lo que hace siempre va a ser importante para la persona que tu amas.

488f0cba2d05898f57246f611afaefe5aa	I do think it is too soon. Because people are different with friends than they are with romantic partners. In 5 months you cannot determine wheather this is the person you want to be with. And it is really heart breaking to find that out when you are living together and having to move out is really heartbreaking. I have been there we moved in too early in our relationship|`|AQGt5c7Eaa	Personally I do think It is too soon only because I myself moved in with my current boyfriend after we had only been together like a month, but I didn't have any history with him. You may feel like you don't have your own space especially since your dad still treats you literally like a little girl. Once you experience that feeling you may regret that you guys decided to move in together so soon. In other words just make sure you feel confident in your decision.

Its how you carry yourself.  Men get attracted to women, who carries herself well, self-confident, dresses up well and all that stuff, because it communicates to the subconscious, that she's a "catch".<br>  <br>  take this.. i saw a pretty face lady, tall, fair-skin.  she's good looking alright, but dressed up like a grandma, and walking funny.  it aint cool girl, it aint cool, no matter how pretty her face is.

B791qvCEaa	Not sure I understand what you mean, but the words navigation and compass can be used between you and your partner to find the "way" to your "destination". If you understand what I mean.|`|MZ8IBEvYaa	it's more of the word explore rather than navigation.
ua8HhBJHaa	I would stay friends with him and see where it goes. If he doesnt like you in that way, you still have a good friend. But dont rush into a relationship, stay friends first. Maybe invite him to go see a movie with you or out for soda or coffee so you get to know him without friends around you. Good luck|`|f3c2f2db84e69631f5f9fb205c3a050aaa	Ummm, he could not be being more obvious.  He might as well be wearing a sign|`|ee4678869d4897b2132614f58b4c0ecfaa	I'm guessing that you are of either middle school or high school age.  With that being said, why don't you get a mutual friend to ask the guy what he thinks about you?  Your only other option is to flat out ask him yourself.  Good luck.|`|F9OAFyXIaa	don't jump into any conclusions so fast. but it seems like he likes you.|`|HgAu0wITaa	i think he likes u. act really flirty around him. become closer to him. who knows??????|`|aa6f98bed77cb82a4e71563bcce914a7aa	sounds like he likes you. why dont you ask him?
3gQr9dN3aa	I went through the same thing with my mom. It wasn't until I was much older that I found out that she was going through a lot of stuff with my dad, and was taking it out on me. <br>  Your mom could be going through something right now, and does'nt know how to react.<br>  Why don't you sit down with your mom and ask ask her if anything is bothering her. She will love that you are taking the time to ask her about her and her feelings. <br>  Growing up is hard, trust me, but take from me. I am about to turn 30 and I love my mom and appreciate her.<br>  Things will be ok, it may not be today, it may be tomorrow, but they will be ok soon.<br>  I am here if you need to talk some more.<br>  :]|`|9PnN3iUBaa	The way to patch stuff up with your mom is not say anything back to her when she lectures you..if you do it will just go into a cycle and when she realizes you didnt talk back then she will feel bad about just chewing you out..dont leave because your mom puts a free roof over your head.|`|a6c17b633014c5c8550628575321ebb1aa	This sounds crazy I know, but just do something to show that you still love her and then write a note and say,"I'm leaving, but I would like to work this out.Call me on my cell." etc.|`|cf9I7eCjaa	aughh!!!!!  i'm going through the same thing!  she gets mad for every little thing and always takes it out on me.  and then i yell back and then we don't talk for days.  but maybe you should talk to another adult or counselor...thats what i do.  and if you keep warning her and she keeps fighting with you, maybe it'd be best for you to leave.<br>  <br>  good luck! =]|`|kWExfEqAaa	If there is any physical abuse then dont put up with it. If its verbal then you and mom need to have a long heart to heart.(calmly)<br>  Nobody can ever love you like your momma does...after all, she gave birth to you|`|33182261496b89aa6fb8c799d192390daa	No, please don't run away. You obviously care about your mum very much which is a great place to start. I am guessing that your mum is under some kind of pressure that for some reason she doesn't feel able to discuss with you and she is taking out her fear/frustration/stress on you. You sound mature enough to realise that we hit out at our nearest and dearest because we trust them to forgive us and love us regardless. Is it possible for you to go to an adult friend or relative of your mum's and explain that you are concerned about her and your relationship is suffering from continual fighting. Otherwise try to pick a good time and talk to her; find out if there is something worrying her that is causing her to behave this way. She may be ill, having concerns at work or having financial problems. We think our parents should do the right thing all the time but they are just as likely to get frightened and overwhelmed by life as teenagers. Just remember that there has to be an underlying reason for her to be acting this way. Give her a hug and tell her you love her and want to help and you are not happy for things to continue the way they are. Find a solution that works for you both and running away probably is not it. Good luck; be kind.|`|f944ef2ed824a553beb9fd82e2cf9c03aa	baby girl don't leave. your mom is still a person, she's got her own share of issues, she probably doesn't mean to snap at you. be patient with her. i know she loves you.
d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	It could mean any thing and you can draw your own conclusions.  The way to get out of that is to ask him out and find out if there is something more then just staring at each from across the room or places you have met eyes.<br>  <br>  You won't find that out until you try to find out if he wants to just be friends or have a relationship with you.|`|bGLmkdHXaa	it could be either way, i say find out only if you want to sometimes i wonder if my life is better that i never know<br>  <br>  pathetically poetic|`|f0uVevvGaa	that sounds really intense. you should ask him. but it sounds like someones interested in you. go 4 it, girlfriend!!!oWW|`|oJwT4Ixzaa	he likes you girl. and u know it.
bWXozIQRaa	Tell her you have had enough!Then tell him he better stand behind you.If he loves you he will!
jrVijtPWaa	I would figure out where the 'love' feeling comes from. Usually it's just an emotion with not much substance whereas the person she likes is probably because of common interests. I would be really careful with the love feeling - it can be quite blinding and misleading.|`|f6d94bbf974e0f17047fc30b4c9167f4aa	jade call me...we need to talk
uyiHFdb1aa	i guess your right about them feeling helpless. when they don't know how to act they start saying hurtful things or swearing. I think that (some) women have more control over what they say and do, perhaps because most women think before they act.
950fbc0fdd07e3750d2b16c89dad0dc0aa	Sure.........it's my pleasure 2b your friend. Feel free 2message me if u need a friend very badly.|`|AA11388175	there arent "chat bots" here
AA11363175	Take some time off from being together. Sometimes being together all the time actually makes people get on each others' nerves. Some breathing space would probably help you and your friendship.|`|zUABofgNaa	Are you really "best friends" or friends cause your parents are friends? It is too bad your parents are having problems, but chances are if your families do things together a lot now that may change once your parents split up. <br>  Best friends want to be friends with each other they aren't forced to be friends. Maybe you should try doing things with some other friends and you may be able to sort out your true feelings. I am 47 years old and my best friend since childhood recently died.. We were really close but we also had other friends, some we shared some we didn't. Just made us love and appreciate each other more.|`|d829b15d717790615b9287e5495b09bcaa	Just get some space and spend some time alone and relax, maybe she seems annoying because you guys hang out alot. If that's not the case explain to her that you're really have a bad time right now and if she can't understand she's not a real friend.
5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	NOWHERE!!!!<br>  <br>  Why do fat women think that chubby chasers are a majority?! You take any group of 50 men and there will be maybe 5 that like bigger women, but even then, those 5 may not like HUGE women. I like big girls, but even I have a limit. Call me a jerk if you want, but that's the way it is.<br>  <br>  You want a man? Let that be your motivation to start jogging.|`|ghCIB7vRaa	When you find out , let me know.  Been here 6 months!

UbdZFnpdaa	Wow, I am a spring of knowledge about this situation.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend has a very strong willed father, and we have been in a long-distance relationship for a year and a half of our two and a half years together.<br>  <br>  If by hurt you are talking about physical violence or emotional abuse, then you need to gently, and I mean GENTLY, get your g/f to come forward to the police or a teacher/counselor for abuse.<br>  <br>  Provided that the situation is just that her father does not like you and her being together, the best thing you can do is to treat her like a princess, though you will have arguments.  When you show her father that you will do anything for the best of his daughter you will be surprised at how his mind will change concerning the two of you.  Fathers are naturally protective of their daughters, and in  his eyes no man deserves his daughter, so at times it may happen that you will have to not reveal to your g/f the way her father makes you feel.<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting that you bottle things up, rather talk with someone else about it to get it off of your chest.  Your girlfriend's father is probably her personal hero, as many fathers are to their daughters.  So know when you make him look bad in her eyes she is going to defend him tooth and nail.  So do your best to care for your woman and to show her father the type of man you truly are.|`|399226d5094730d171b769cebc7bbf93aa	Uh...more info please.<br>  <br>  How do you keep making her get hurt by her dad?<br>  <br>  What are you doing?<br>  <br>  As far as long distance relationships go, if it's going to be a long haul..it's hard. Long distance relationships create false intimacy.|`|6635873bd73bee9197dcfc6c72510816aa	tell her you care too much about her to know that you are getting her in trouble and that you think this "long distance" thing isn't working out and ask her what she thinks you guys should do.|`|KM8UwucAaa	This is a hard situation to be in. If you really care about the girl, you have to get through this together. If her dad is hurting her, don't talk to him but ask her to talk to him about it. If you keep fighting constantly, maybe you two aren't cut out for each other. It's not what you want to hear, but it's true.|`|p1wOxGrZaa	i dont know why you like her but long distance relashinships never last long if her dad is the problem call him and ttellhim why you like her maby hell come through to you and her

cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	It depends on if she is focused on someone else. Love is an action! Without this action love dies. If she is focused on someone else that's where love will grow, and you won't even be an after thought. However, if you broke it off and she doesn't have anyone else to fall back on, you have a chance! Remember, love is an action! If you don't do something, it will most definitely die!|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Does this look like the psychic friends network?|`|uGdkBYa3aa	depends on your situation|`|TfxGL1luaa	Yes

YES IT DOES SOUND sexual. but make sure you insist that you're going to JUST give her a massage and that she should NOT expect anything more.<br>  when telling her that, you have to believe beforehand that she WILL say yes, (since she wants you to ask her out anyways)..<br>  coming off with such confident attitude. you will attract her MORE than showering her with any "affection buying scheme) that any wimp would do. ;-)|`|097e844c4aeecfe4f4c0e9f6cf039ea4aa	go up to her like you've never seen her before in your life. stand next to her and look her up and down with a grin on your face.<br>  <br>  lean in close and say, " you new here?" hit on her like a stranger for a while and then say, " what kind of chance would a guy like me have of getting with someone as hot as you?"|`|46b5fcf7c4d371e06f9f97a980cc0196aa	why don't you think about what you've talked about in the past, like if she likes flowers surprise her with flowers, if she likes chocolate give her chocolate, etc. don't lose all of your dignity trying to give her what she wants and don't always do what she says but if you really like her try to do what she wants. good luck!|`|AA12225002	send a cute stuffed animal holding  a note asking her to meet you somewhere at a certain time, have a friend there with a flower or another stuffed animal or something else she likes with another note asking her to meet you somewhere else, do this one more time, then meet her with a boquet of flowers and ask her out.|`|BfcPr1Usaa	Aight This Is What You Do.

Remember When Doing Such Things Like This Act Like Shes The Greatest Thing In The World And A The Lowest Thing On The Food Chain.  Tell Her That You Just Want To Be With Her, Hold Her, And Spend All Your Time With And That You Would Do Anything In The World For Her.  Always Act Like Shes To Good For You.

fc0034dcdf406d6086ab1a9fcbf4ece3aa	hi<br>  since I truly do not know the situation, I can only give you half an answer.<br>  Honestly, agree to dissagree. again, I do not know the story, but if you both feel you were right - what can you do! There are some things that I don't agree with with my fiance - and I can't make him understand no matter what I say - ut I have to step back and remember that his opinion and his values are valid. He is a human like everyone else. <br>  Agree to just stop fighting - and truly, don't bring it up again - with anyone - if you are going to hold it against him forever, then you aren't meant to be together (and be happy that is)<br>  no one wants to be wrong. In saying that, I don't know if he was wrong, and I am not saying that you were wrong either.<br>  Remember, you won't always be on the same page with everything, and you have to expect that it will proablably happen again (maybe not the same situation, but you ar ebound to dissagree on something!)<br>  Put yourself in his shoes for a moment - wouldn't it be awful i your girl didn't return your calls and was ignoring you? You pretty much forced him to say that. By the sounds of it, I don't think he really wants to leave you. time to sit down and both say sorry - it doesn't matter who's right, it matters that you don't want to hurt eachother. remember if he makes you happy, and vice versa.<br>  Stop worrying about who's right. <br>  good luck :)|`|90c889e148eedcf85d5edf4e798468c6aa	your story is way to ambiguous to make any good conclusions about it on my part. all i know is not talking to him isn't going to help anything. he obviously still doesn't understand what's bothering you. try telling him whats wrong, but on his standards...like  if he for some reason he says your fat, say its like you saying your 'weewee' is small. I'm sorry if i dont make and sense @.o
qvMYsDtZaa	First of all  you need to decide two things.... <br>  1.) Are you letting go because YOU HAVE TO, such as in the case of a death, end of a relationship, a loss of your job, etc..  <br>  2.) Are you letting go because you THINK you should?     <br>  You have to be the one to decide which best fits your situation.  If you HAVE to let go and are having trouble adjusting then you may want to get some moral support from someone you know and trust who might help you through the loss.  If you don't want to seek help from a friend or family member then you should probably consider getting some  professional help. A good counselor can really help and a visit with one is strictly confidential....  Maybe you are facing a situation where you THINK you should let go or someone else is pressuring you to let go but you just aren't sure that you should or want to.   If this is the case, then you need to take your time and do some evaluating.   Evaluate all of the pro's and con's about what you are letting go of and be very honest with yourself.   Once you are certain that you should let go then accept it for all the reasons that brought you to that conclusion and act accordingly.  Don't get side-tracked or change course once you have decided what you need to do.  Do what is best for you and if you have dificulty in doing that then, again,  find some outside support to help you.  If you don't have insurance or can't afford a counselor but would like to get some help from one then look up Community Mental Health Services in your local phone directory.  Their counseling services are free and confidential.    <br>  I hope the best for you.|`|5NeQmslnaa	Everyone hurts sometimes.  It's hard to let go of someone or something you love.  They say time heals all.  Take all the time you need to have self-pity, feel depressed, cry, cry some more, write down your feelings, indulge yourself in some good ice cream, hide yourself in your home and just shut down.  After a while you'll get tired of all of this and then you'll join the living again.  You're just living life sweetie...ebbs and flows.  I think you're just in a 'holding pattern' for something better to come along.|`|fc0034dcdf406d6086ab1a9fcbf4ece3aa	Ask yourself -do I really NEED this> and WHY<br>  Remember any sentimental value will still be there in your heart and mind after it's gone.<br>  Ask yourself -Can it benefit someone else? Wouldn't it be nice if they found the same value in it as i did?<br>  Picture yourself feeling good about letting it go. - your end result.
f7a2dbe60aafc592e200907f567924d0aa	No, you are only 13. Shame on your parents. They shouldn't allow you to be dating in the first place let alone a 16 year old. For your own good, don't have sex untill you are atleast 16. Then you will be a little smarter and more mature and be able to handle all the complexities of a sexual relationship. Otherwise at that age sex might become meaningless to you in a few years.|`|JYPzJMFfaa	You are far too young to be in this situation. Even though it's only 3 years, 13 and 16 is a HUGE age difference. 16 year olds usually want different things than 13 year olds (which this proves that.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, if he got angry then he doesn't care for you as much as you think he does. Why don't you just focus on being a kid and not worry about a serious relationship? You'll have all your life to worry about this stuff, go play soccer or whatever kids do these days.|`|XwJfzqRnaa	no you did the right thing by saying no.<br>  who cares if hes pissed?<br>  let him cool down and just tell him your not ready.<br>  aware him of the age difference.<br>  and dont let your guard down.|`|wAoOSO8Xaa	No way. You two are way too young to be worrying about sex. Would you honestly be able to care for a child should you get pregnant? Ask him if he would be willing to dedicate his life to you if you did get pregnant. If he truly cares about you then he shouldn't be getting mad. Never do anything that you're uncomfortable with no matter who's asking.|`|xNvP2u1jaa	NO WAY!<br>  If he truly cares about you he will respect your wishes to wait.Never ever compromise your values for anyone!<br>  Be strong - stick to your no - a good guy will love you no matter what.|`|zjd1bzx3aa	No, you shouldn't have sex until you feel right about it, and it is no big deal that at 13 you don't really want to.

tgYEXN8Gaa	That is really cute!  Just act yourself and try not to worry about what to say or do, just let things happen naturally.  And think of it this way, if she didn't like you for the person she's been spending time with, don't you think she wouldn't waste her time?  And as for falling for her really quickly, just remind yourself to slow down and remember that if you act too fast, you may scare her off.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|6UUsFFnOaa	i think your just excited about the potential of this relationship. which is natural. just dont smoother her with these deep feelings bc she will get freakeds out and run the other way. just take things slow and ease into it so you are sure about your feelings an dknow that this isnt a spur of the moment type thing and more of a long term feeling. try to ask her out again and take things slow!|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	Sounds like you could very well be afraid of rejection.

It's true, we've all felt those feelings.  But from what you say, you sound like a mentally healthy guy who's already on his way to moving on.  The fact is that you recognize the neediness you feel and that it would be in your best interest to "chill out".  That will happen with just letting time pass, and in the meantime, don't keep thinking thoughts of how wonderful it was with that girl.  Think ahead of how wonderful it will be with the RIGHT girl for you.  Sounds like you'll be fine.|`|jj2tSASnaa	First do not ACT so needy,BECOME less needy.<br>  You can't possibly be so pathetic that if she left you would be alone FOREVER!!!!|`|AA10515759	Watch the movie "Theres something about Marry". There is a great idea on how to get relaxed just before a date.|`|AA10810682	Aww... you've got it bad. Well, I think that after you go out on a great date with her you should do something equally nice for yourself. Buy yourself something that you like.. a video game... a book... some fishing tackle.. who knows. Just something that occupies your time but you really enjoy doing. That way you'll have 2 guilty pleasures.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|IQEpzqVEaa	If a girl makes you feel insecure than she is probably not the right girl for you. Not everyone cheats. So as long as you are treating her the same way you want to be treated than that's all you can do. I have learned the hard way that you cannot control what other people do. Good things happen to good people. You be the best person you can be and if she ends up hurting you than a better girl will come along. The pain that love causes is a terrible feeling that takes alot of time to fade but you have to be strong cause what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. Just don't be like me and think well if I hurt them then it won't hurt as bad cause it does.|`|ITNzcWHqaa	do some hardcore guy activities like bball or football.  this will sooth some of the girly feeling syndrome...maybe even try boxing LOL anyway if u have fun u'll enjoy her even more|`|JTOD5vn6aa	well you cant get help if you have that feeling i think you just found out what love is!|`|QwoU0C6zaa	How long have you been seeing her?

Hunters use headgear and facial camo and the material is rather sheer but still may be a bit too opaque for what you are looking for.  Check their websites anyway or better yet, ask for a Cabella's catalog in the mail.  It has everything!!  That sounds like a cool idea.  Good Luck!|`|AA10173149	Wow a camo veil, thats awesome, never would have thought about it , is her dress going to be white?

d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	Maybe in some ways she loves you as a friend but doesn't love you in that way if she has another boy friend.  But then again if that relationship doesn't work out then maybe if it was meant to be she could come back to you?   Who knows?  <br>  <br>  Only time.  Let her go and meet other people and if one day you both find yourselves meet up with each then it may be meant to be and if not then maybe you will meet someone else in stead?<br>  <br>  Sometimes you have to let the person go if you love them and if they love you they will come back to you.  My mother told me that one.  She was right because I went through that with someone I really loved or thought was love and I let them go and they came back.  I know that he loved me and we went through some pretty difficult times.<br>  <br>  Only I found out that it wasn't mean't to be.  I don't know if it will be in the future either?  I let go I put my faith in God rather then hoping for something that may or may not happen.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you do something fullfilling to fill your time up where it's caring for someone else like doing volunteer work you can find love in doing good things for others.  In that way you can grow as a person and then you know more about what you really want other then focusing on a relationship so much.<br>  <br>  If you do something good with your time to help others there is no telling whom you may meet in the future?|`|Cc73kdncaa	Never! Fight for the one and only you love! Unless... there is someone else you sort of like... go get your girl! You had her before! But remember she is yours... so take her out and talk to her...|`|Bdy3PMk6aa	Love is blind and its consequence is unknown. LOVE not only bring you closer, it may take you apart from the closest one.

3EdrELkSaa	Wow, this girl really has a handle on things. first if you are truly a good friend to friend of six years you would tell your knew friend that you do not appreciate her bad mouthing your best friend and that you will no longer tolerate it. Also just speak the truth let her know that it is obvious she is trying to come between you and your best friend by doing under handed things and you will reveal to your bf the fact that she is using your bf for her gifts. And don't worry about your brother hopefully he will find out soon what type of person she really is and dump her.|`|XKoxpzUHaa	Any friend who can be "stolen" isn't really a friend worth having.  I would just remain friendly with your best friend and "let the chips fall where they may".  Trying to keep or guard  best friend status, or appearing to do so, will only drive them from you.  Time has a wonderful way of revealing the truth of who people are and their motives for being in certain relationships.<br>  <br>  It isn't wrong to warn a friend about a toxic relationship if your motives are pure, but I wouldn't force the issue.|`|ecd60970f27ab5cc43542c040cb17a4faa	wow..thats some situation you r in!..it stinks...<br>  i think you should sit with both of em and tell them wht you think..its better to have an open conversation than keep thinking things n there is also a possibility of misunderstanding.....so talk to ur best friend and ur new friend,...tell them both hwo you feel when they go out leaving you....and everything..<br>  well if ur best friend is really ur best friend she will realise things...<br>  just have patience..and as long as u have a clear heart..things should work out..<br>  all the best..<br>  Ps: ask ur new friend how she accepts thigns/gifts 4m ur bestfriend if she is so bad..doesnt she have scruples? that might get her thinking!!
d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	Maybe he doesn't realize that he's doing it so perhaps instead of letting it get to you so much you can always change the topic and find something else to talk about.<br>  <br>  Talk about interests that don't involve bragging. Maybe once they see you have no interest then maybe then they could catch on?|`|dwF1ctl6aa	You can tell him about a fictitious problem that describes him and see what he would advise you to do .... or<br>  <br>  you can talk about the importance of humility and start making him aware indirectly of how uncomfortable it is to deal with a brag.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.selfempoweredwoman.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.selfempoweredwoman.com</a>
EJmlrpVHaa	it certainly is possible and I would rather that it happened to you now that after you got married. You have to tell your boyfriend this because it is not going to go away. Do the right thing. Even if you dont end up with the other guy, you have feelings for him and that means that the person you were going to marry is not your soulmate.|`|SnBgoEhyaa	End it! Tell him your feelings have changed. Don't admit you like someone else. Try not to date anyone for awhile after wards. Don't burn your bridge with your fiance, but don't marry him with these doubts. Marriage is difficult enough without it at least starting out with a strong support.<br>  I've been married for 21 years and in the past 4 years I've had to be separated twice for long periods (one-6Mo's, two-8Mo's). I think being apart opened my eyes that my husband really did have some faults and that I could manage fairly well without him. It strengthened my self-esteem, but weakened our marriage. I have been back with him for a year now, and still haven't reached that level of marriage we once shared. I don't plan to leave, he is good to me, but the spark is much less now. 21 years is a long time to put into something and just throw it away for such a minor reason. You on the other hand have yet to begin. If you pull away now, you will give yourself time to really look at what you want. Feelings no doubt will be hurt on your fiance's part, but this is better than putting both of you through a divorce.|`|8GF3Lq7Iaa	It is possible to fall out of love with one person.  I think that if you have any feelings at all for this guy, then you shouldn't be marrying your fiance.  Because remember, when you are married, you are expected to be committed to that person 100%.  It's better to end the relationship now than to want to end it during the marriage.|`|AA11715755	do what ur heart says.. marry the one u love the most so tht u dont regret later.<br>  u cant pretend 2 love some one u dont love. its better u choose the one whom u cant live without

Simple.<br>  <br>  Depending on your grade, job, education, and age, I suggest you go to the fanciest/closest restaunt. Or you can make it romantic - Set up your own 2 chair dinner in your home.|`|000c99e5e8ca4963d8e9ea00230e75c3aa	just ask her|`|9PnN3iUBaa	Well you just kind of start a conversation with her...and bring up the subject of the place you wanna go out with her and then you ask if she'd want to go with you there.|`|AA10953374	ask to talk to her alone then just say"will you go out with me"<br>  girls hate it when u go with those slogans like "wana date"<br>  if she says yes kiss her right away(they love that) and if she says no dont be a puss go hang out with friends|`|NloryOzzaa	yea but what if she has a boyfriend and she don't tell you, then what do you do?

TlL2jWanaa	You will wonder this with every women you ever get into a relationship with. It's a common thing and it does not mean that you are making a mistake by remaining where you are with your current girlfriend. At some point in time you just have to decide to stop the "what if" game that plauges everyone, and make a choice to devote yourself to someone despite the shortcomings. If you can't shrug off the "what if" then you need to avoid serious relationships until you can get a handle on it. In the long run you will be doing yourself and the women that you date a huge favor.|`|muRI850haa	Whatever you do, don't make promises to this girl that you don't intend to keep. If you don't want to be in the relationship with her, you need to end it immediately. You need to decide which is more important, try your luck with someone else, or love someone who loves you back. But if you stay with this girl , you need to commit to her. You can't keep shopping for other women while you are with her. Just stay focused on whatever you think is important, and spare the poor girl's heart from breaking any more than you have to.|`|437c625b88b901d30110ed10a7d130fbaa	Dear confused: It sound like you do not no what you want out of life because you are young. may be you need to tell the girl you love that you should just be friends for now until you can decide what you really want.  This way the girl is not waiting for something that may never happen between you and she can go on with her life. It's not fair to lead someone on if you have doubts it sound like you want to be single and play the field.  I just hope when you do decide if you want this girl who you say you love that she is not taken.  Think hard before you decide what you really want. good luck|`|vSdak9C3aa	It sounds like you are not ready to commit to her completely. You need to take a break and go "explore" your options before you can give her your heart completely.<br>  If you just wait you might cheat on her or two years down the road when you have a lot more invested in the relationship it will be harder.
YWNJduA0aa	I would suggest making it very personal and make a special birthday card just for him.  If you have some pictures of your brother when you both were younger, you could use an older photo for the inside of the card.

ccqIYm0eaa	don't worry, this, too, shall pass.  it might seem like you'll never get over him, and in truth you'll never really forget him, but you will be able to move on and find your perfect man, or at least lots of fun men!|`|eu0eb09Zaa	Have a fun night with friends! and find youself a neww boyfriend, prehaps a close friend?|`|AA10262843	He thinks, he thinks.  He is finish with you.  That's an excuse for him to end the relationship, but not to worry time heals all wounds.  The best way to get back at him is to do something great with your life.  It will make you feel better about yourself and show him and his family.  Take it a day at a time.  Give yourself a chance, use that energy that you waste thinking about him on doing something great with your life.  Start by not calling, answering or seeing him.  You will be glad and say one day what did you ever see in him in the first place.|`|XTQDW3x9aa	u can forget about him cuz u once love him but u can get over him. just go out and have fun and met new ppl and slowly ull get over it|`|hVHVbpdBaa	Courage, girl, it will happen. Read some good books, get into some work, keep busy, and eventually you will see that there are other men, other things to do that may be even more rewarding (yes, it is possible) and one day you'll realize that it's all over for you. And that will be good. There are, after all at least 3,000 people on the planet who would be good mates for us, you will find another. Let yourself think about the possibilities. Your ex may have been right or wrong about whether you'd adapt to his family, but he took that out of your hands, whether through lack of confidence in you or in himself, or just not enough strength and perseverance. So you must move on. He just couldn't do it. Good luck to you.|`|lFdSe6Cnaa	U cant forget about a person when u keep thinkin about all the good times that yall had....try 2 think about all the bad things  that he did 2 u....i can even tell u dat he did u wrong because he broke up with u because u would not adjust well in his family....why the hell would he leave u for some bullshit like dat cause if u love someone u would try your best 2 make things work and it doesnt matter what the sitiuation is

AA10975730	Yo evado preguntas con preguntas... es una forma sutil de decir, que te importa.  El mtodo de las respuestas cortas tambin funciona... SI y NO las palabras mgicas que la cultura nos regal; evitan que te metas en los.  El "no s" tambin suele funcionar...

Por  si acaso  te sirven te dare algunos tips.   Antes de una relacion anal   aplicate un  enema o lavado intestinal puede ser  no muy  fuerte, mas bien suave. Consigue en la farmacia un lubricante    GEL  a base de agua.  No ha de ser crema,  eso ayuda  pero se absorve y  termina  por irritar  a  ambos. Debes estar bastante  exitada, bien caliente, pues, para lograrlo  que  tu   campa?ero  te  estimule  mediante sexo oral pero no llegues al orgasmo.   Tambien  tu compa?ero  utilizara   primero un dedo y prueba a introducirlo  en tu ano,  utilizado mucho gel,  todo esto   en forma  muy cuidadosa cuando ya estes  relajada y tu lo permitas,  intentara meter dos dedos juntos.  Aqui   contara mucho que tu estes relajada y dispuesta a disfrutar  del momento,  si es el caso  entonces continuas y si no  debes considerar  que  este fue un buen adelanto.  Es decir   se puede intentar  todo lo anterior  en otra  ocasion  y esto cuantas veces sea necesario,  pero que tu  te sientas  relajada,  sin miedo y dispuesta a disfrutar., Si deseas  continuar adelante, entonces pones a  tu  hombre recostado de espaldas,  que tenga una buena ereccion  y cuando  lo  consiga,   te le sientas sobre su pene, arriba de  el pero dandole la espalda,   Ambos se ponen mucho gel lubricante,   tu deberas  controlar  la introduccion puebas primero la puntita, y con movimientos apropiados  vas  introduciendo lentamente su pene en tu ano,  primero  una parte,  luego te retiras, y vuelves a introducirlo, asi  tu vas graduando lo que  te plasca.   Cuando ya  logres que entre   facil y te sea agradable,  entonces  puedes  dejarte caer sobre un costado  y hasta entonces  tu compa?ero  puede tomar  mayor parte activa,  En todo momento  ambos deben  tener mucha comunicacion   por  si acaso hay  dolor  o signos de sangrado,  en este ultimo caso deberan suspender  las acciones.Caundo  ya  tu compa?ero tome parte activa  que lo haga   despacio y poco a poco  ira aumentado el ritmo d sus movimientos,  con una de  sus manos te podria estimular  el clitoris.

1e0c76a6b12bfd1c8481134b7432e8c2aa	Estimado Crack,   A veces creemos que para tener xito con las mujeres tenemos que centrarnos ms en ELLAS, pero la verdas es que para ser un seductor y conquistaror, es necesario comenzar con uno mismo: trabaja en tu autoestima, crece en tu seguridad, cultvate (lee buenos libros), socializa (si eres alguien aislado, a la hora de socializar, o simplemente relacionarte con una chica, te desplazars torpemente), s muy limpio (aseo general, tu aliento debe ser fresco, si no ests seguro que lo es, pregntale a tu hermano/a, visita al dentista, usa hilo dental, enjuague), utiliza una locin rica (pregntale a la chava cul es la que la enloquece); ten un buen corte de cabello (trelo siempre arreglado), s extraordinariamente CABALLEROSO...   Y cuando ames, ama a una sola, sele fiel, mustrate protector y atento, con eso tienes amigo...   Suerte matador! ;-)|`|AA10975730	A ver, a ver... para ser todo un casanova... lo nico que tienes que hacer es "tirarte" a un montn de viejas... sin que te importen sus sentimientos... ?Cmo?  Ponte "carita", y consigue un buen de lana, porque generalmete... las viejas as... pues tampoco se fijan en tus sentimientos...    Ahora, tu aclaracin... no habla precisamente de ser un casanova...|`|be5bc2d86c0b2e95c4f1dd0df8124dc9aa	Un casanova no se hace, se nace siendolo.  Lo siento amigo...
AA10975730	Tu pregunta me parece una como las que yo suelo hacer,es decir, dos en uno.  (Suele suceder).  Tratar de integrarlas en una sola respuesta.  Es slo un intento.    Cuando somos libres ejercemos nuestra facultad para obrar o no obrar, somos independientes.  El ser humano es por naturaleza egosta.  Nos centramos en nosotros mismos y vemos por nosotros mismos, por nuestro bien, por nuestra sobrevivencia... Creo que, muchas veces, la mayor parte de lo que hacemos, es por conveniencia.  Algunos tienen complejo de "Buen Samaritano", de "Gandhi" o de "Madre Teresa", personas que se ufanan de ser muy buenos, de pensar en ellos hasta el final y dejar sus necesidades hasta el final.  Pero la verdad, son contadas las personas que en realidad se olvidan de s mismos.    A la hora de la hora, creo que el 90% de las cosas que hacemos las hacemos por beneficio propio... es ms, yo, por ejemplo, casi todo lo que hago en mi vida es para m, por m, para mi goce personal... y muy poco de lo que hago es SINCERAMENTE por otras personas.  Incluso he llegado a hacer cosas que aparentemente son por los dems, pero cuando lo analizo, pensaba slo en m.    Una de las definiciones que ofrece el Diccionario de la Real Academia de la palabra "atar" es la siguiente:    "Ce?irse o reducirse a una cosa o materia determinada".    Respondiendo concretamente a la segunda parte de tu pregunta:    "Porque no deseo atarme a nada o a alguien y continuar viviendo independientemente,hasta conseguir mis metas?"    PORQUE ERES EGOSTA Y NO QUIERES RENUNCIAR A ESA CAPACIDAD INTRNSECA DE DECIDIR LO QUE HACES O NO.  CUANDO DECIDES UNIRTE A OTRA PERSONA (AMISTAD, MATRIMONIO, CUALQUIER RELACIN) TIENES QUE ESTAR DISPUESTO A CEDER.  ?POR QU?  ?HAS ESCUCHADO EL DICHO "CADA CABEZA ES UN MUNDO"?  SUPONGO QUE S.

Los gatos son libres, independientes, elegantes y bastante aventureros.    Uno como hombre piensa siempre que es mejor tener una estabilidad psicolgica y econmica para poder atender mejor las situaciones que se libren en pareja. Al menos eso pienso yo. Pero lo que te sugiero es que encuentres a tu pareja mas o menos parecida at; que comparta tu gusto por la vida y la emocin de lo que les guste hacer en comn. Acuerdate que uno busca una pareja no para atarse, sino para aumentar la diversin de lo que uno no puede hacer slo. En estos temas no soy muy diestro, pero mas o menos creo que entiendes lo que te quiero decir.  Porque yo pensaba igual que t hace tiempo.

So many people get hurt by bad choices they make.  If you tell you'll lose your friendship with the cheater and you'll see the pain on the person who's been cheated on and feel responsible of it.      Probably the one who's being cheated on already suspects it - for there are signs of a cheating spouse... but is afraid to confront it losing it all especially if there are children involved.      Ask yourself, would you want to be told if you were in that situation?  Most of us do......  There is a way you can tell that person anonymously............... sending a note of course not in your hand writting, etc.    This relationship will come to a head and choices will have to be made to either work out the relationship or for them to just part ways..   Who wants to be in a relationship like this - nip the problem early on - who wants wasted years to pass in that kind of marriage not giving the other person the opportunity to find true love and happiness.|`|858f24126ac9f92443ab2d671a1a2ee7aa	stay out of it
AA10975730	En primer lugar, no niego que eso sea una pregunta, sin embargo pienso que est incompleta y por tanto, puede prestarse a muchas interpretaciones.    Aunque tu aclaracin carece de puntuacin, creo entender lo que quieres.    Interpreto lo siguiente:    ?Ests de acuerdo con la liberacin femenina? (Si o no) ?Por qu?    Quiero que den una respuesta y no ms preguntas.    Si es as entonces,    Yo entiendo por "liberacin femenina" un fenmeno social que cobr fuerza en los a?os '70, donde las mujeres exigen tener los mismos derechos y oportunidades que los hombres.  Se llevan a cabo manifestaciones, y "rebeldas" en todos los aspectos de la vida, en el trabajo, en el vestir, etc.    Pienso que hombres y mujeres son ESENCIALMENTE iguales (en cuanto a igualdad de condicin humana), sin embargo, hombres y mujeres somos ACCIDENTALMENTE DIFERENTES.    Las mujeres que opinan que SOMOS IGUALES, me caen mal, somos muy, muy diferentes; simplemente, un hombre tiene ms fuerza fsica que una mujer, y en aspectos psicolgicos somos en extremo diferentes.    Hombre y mujer se complementan en todos los aspectos.    Creo que s es injusto negarle ciertas oportunidades a las mujeres cuando es slo porque son mujeres.    Estoy de acuerdo, cuando esta liberacin es racional y cuando se reconoce que s somos diferentes pero que en esencia ambos tenemos dignidad.|`|b631b7fc1b72bcfc92a109386cc0b4d8aa	Decdete...  ?Libertad femenina o libertinaje?

Perhaps her cell phone was on and she turned it off because the batter was low. If it hasn't been too long since then, ask your Mom if she talked to your Dad that day. She doesn't find anything out, and you get an answer.     You could just ask your father who he was talking to. He'll lie if he has a lover, but there will be tell tell signs on his face. If his face turns red, that's a dead giveaway.     However, I don't think your father would talk to his mistress when he's anywhere near you.

Imagina que tienes que llegar a un lugar muy lejano y ests caminando en la carretera.  En eso, pasa un hombre sumamente atractivo, amable, en un auto convertible de lujo que te ofrece llevarte.  Te subes al auto.  Al principio, tu eres amable con l y l lo es contigo.  Platican y platican y pasan las horas y l sigue manejando y los dos felices porque todo es nuevo, etc.  ?Qu pasa despus de varias horas?  Pues ambos se sienten hambrientos, cansados, etc. Tal vez, cargan gasolina, o se detienen en un restaurante a comer algo y las cosas siguen mas o menos bien.  El lugar est tan, tan lejos que esto los empieza a cansar a los dos.  ?Y qu pasa cuando estamos en estress o cansados de lo mismo?  Pues queremos culpar a todas las circunstancias a nuestro alrededor.  As que l empieza a decir que si tu no te hubieras subido al coche l ya habra llegado y t tambin te hartas de l y cosas por el estilo.    Ahora, imagnate que se hartan tanto que l te dice:  YA BJATE DE MI AUTO y t le dices PUES ME BAJO y ya los dos estn tan hartos que si l no te hubiera pedido que te bajaras tu te habras bajado sola.      Imagnate que te bajas del auto.  Y que tienes que caminar de nuevo... imagnate, ya abajo... vas a empezar a pensar... qu bueno que me baj... si no, estara con ese imbcil y as... despus de varias horas... vas a extra?ar el auto... y vas a decir... tal vez deb aguantar un poco ms y seguir ah... y despus de ms y ms horas vas a pensar que a final de cuentas el hombre no era tan malo...  Y l por su parte... al principio va a decir: qu bueno que me deshice de esa vieja... nada ms estorbaba... y despus de unas horas ms... va a pensar que no eras tan mala... y tambin va a extra?ar tu compa?a.      Ahora... imagnate que l sigue manejando y en eso... choca y se MATA... ya no est ah... pero pues como t vas caminando... crees que l sigue ah... sale?  Y t caminas y caminas con la esperanza de alcanzarlo... porque crees que se detuvo o algo...    Lo que yo veo en tu caso... es que tu ya llegaste al auto y ests hincada... junto a l... esperando a ver a qu hora revive y te lleva en el coche.  Y lo peor de todo es que hay otro automvil que te puede llevar a donde vas... pero como tu quieres que te lleve el mismo.. ah sigues hincada...hasta que se le ocurra resusitar o qu se yo...|`|d454822c59e93b29cbe86d2df3dd9522aa	Mir, yo hago terapia, y gracias a ello entend que uno no slo necesita si no se debe el proceso de duelo. Creo que en primer lugar lo que deberas hacer es tomarte tu tiempo para hacerlo, y despus que ests con alguien se d y te vas a sentir mucho ms segura. Por otro lado pens que eso de que un clavo saca otro es slo un mito que no tiene nada de cierto.  Tu corazn necesita tiempo para sanar sus heridas, ms adelante te vas a sentir lista para sentir nuevamente el amor en pareja.  Esto que conts me pas, y estar con alguien ms no me sirvi de mucho, creo que la persona que pas por mi vida en ese momento fue una especie de consolador, y termin lastimndolo un poco, y calculo que no ser tu idea.  Entiendo que debe ser muy doloroso estar solo, pero a veces estar con alguien no quiere decir estar acompa?ado, te segus sintiendo sola, porque quien te falta no es l, sino otro.  Penso que si la persona con la que sals sabe de toda la situacin, no debe ser una persona muy segura, ya que pienso que cuando uno empieza una relacin, lo hace sabiendo que puede meterse en la vida del otro para entregarle todo de s y no a medias.  Despus de un a?o y medio de duelo conoc a la persona con la cual quiero estar el resto de mi vida.

de8a27f4410807de5f52d7ed149eba41aa	I think in this type of forum, where there are so many different beliefs and ideals, you have to expect some of that. A lot of people feel safe saying things on the Internet, things that they would never say in person. For me, the secret is to just decide that you're not going to let it bother you from the start. You have to remember that different people come here for different reasons. I don't personally see any reason to report anyone, if I'm offended by a question or answer, I just move on to the next one :)|`|AA11852741	to may female hormone.|`|AA11683605	Text sucks.....it leaves the reader to interpret the "tone" of the person responding and mistakes are easily made.

c7e914a98df8d9354bf882d1d19df970aa	There's no problem, honey. You like him, you know he likes you, and you know he's shy. Ask him out, he would probably be a lot braver when friends are not around. I don't think that he would be afraid of kissing you, I mean, if he's afraid , he wouldn't tell your friends he likes you. He just doesn't want to be rejected, so he let you decide. If you make a move, he'll be sure that you like him too, and there's no reason for him to be afraid of kiss. He knows that if you made a move, you will of course await his kiss. If during the date happens the moment when you are both willing to kiss,and he hesitates, Kiss him first. He just might be a little insecure, but when you become a couple, it will change. And I'm sure that you wiill... LOL, best of luck!|`|AA10922351	Make the firstmove, if he's to shy! Hurry up, or he might think you are not interested in him. He sent you his Statement of Purpose.

Make the first move and if he seems uncomfortable (which he probably won't), then just apologize, say you didin't mean to make him uncomfortable, and take things a lot slower until you think it's really time to try again. Don't rush because something like this just can't be rushed and be expected to end well.|`|AA11056379	yes...ask him out~!..But go for something that is not too much for him at first. Perhaps a movie with friends. Then just with him for a coffeee or something after...Then see where it takes you. Even walks or whatever your into..bikes..skateboards togthere. Guys usually love having attention on them..no matter how shy they are . So, asking him out first will def. make him smile!..His shyness will become less after he spends a bit of time with you.

Push him into making the first move.  I can tell you that if he doesn't get over his shyness and gain a little confidence, you'll get bored with him soon enough.|`|7a8f097f47892379190c9c1c668a0984aa	Ask him to do something with you.  Have lunch or hang out and get to know each other.      Don't push the kissing etc until you feel right about it. It's not a race to the finish line if you really want to have a relationship with him.|`|176836149283a1879a013c44c2004180aa	I think you should wait a little longer for him to see if he does ask you out and while you are waiting keep flirting and doing what ever you do to let a guy know you are really interested tell some of his friends to cause guys gossip just as bad as girls do. After a couple of weeks if he has not asked you yet and you did what I already told you, ask him out. The whole kissing thing I would say wait go on a couple of dates and if he has not made a move step up and do it yourself. Hope my advice works for ya.|`|057c0e03b51d26e590969351c5835f34aa	If you are willing to wait and wait and wait, then by all means wait until the cows come home.  If you are interested in finding out if he really likes you then ask him out.  Apparently he feels awkward right now, not surprising with what is at stake.  If you ask him out and he says yes, then great.  If he likes you a lot, which it sounds like he does, then he feels he has a lot to lose and he is reluctant to act for fear of screwing it all up.  As far as kissing you goes, it's like this.  As his confidence increases you will notice his comfort level goes up.  So all you have to do is find ways to make him feel more confident around you.  He has to see that you are impressed (or in better words "accepted") by his qualities or skills.  If he can knock a baseball out of the park...praise him for that.  You know whatever, maybe he draws well or something.  Find it, build his confidence.  This should help, now be patient and understanding and help this poor man out of his shell. ;-)|`|AA11519393	Just make the first move.

f08cdab9e2c1a31c572dcf3f40cf9bfcaa	Be open with him, but hold your ground. You two have been together for this long, you should be able to talk this out and resolve it like the two mature adults that you sound to be. You are right, it is a relationship and it needs to be treated as such. if he starts getting adgitated when you try to talk about it, clearly you are the mature one.<br>  <br>  I'm a male, and I can say it, there aren't many men out there that can put forth the intestonal fortitude to admit when they are wrong. I have had that problem a couple times, I admit it. However I also think through things and will realize when it is indeed my fault.<br>  <br>  The best thing that I can say is to try and talk it out.<br>  <br>  God's Blessings|`|CBbsulYCaa	If you have been together for 4 years it should be ok for you to talk to him about this.|`|HQCt6GYiaa	Well, relationships are tough.  They take a lot of time and effort from both people.  Being stubborn about not talking isn't the right thing to do.  You have the right idea though he should be the one to say he is sorry and make things work also.  This is something you two need to sit down and talk about.  Avoid arguing about it because that won't help any.  If you have been together for almost 4 years you should know how to talk to eachother.  So be the smarter more mature person in the relationship and talk to him and tell him how you feel and what you need from him.  Hope that helps.  Good luck.

Lo que yo he visto en mi corta edad y experiencia es que en la vida siempre hay un equilibrio y no lo puedes tener todo.  Tomas algo y dejas algo, vives algo bueno pero tambin algo malo.  Mientras quieras tener una experiencia amorosa, mientras quieras involucrarte con otra persona, tienes que aceptar que es posible que las cosas no vayan bien, o que sufras una desilusin... esto es parte de amar, parte de vivir y parte de crecer como persona... Adems no creo en la existencia de "hombres equivocados" (en el sentido que tu le das)... ms bien, las situaciones y las circunstancias... el tiempo y el espacio en el que se dan las cosas pueden hacer parecer que se trata de la persona equivocada y tal vez no lo sea.      Adicionalmente, yo te aconsejo que no te agobies por situaciones como sta... una de mis citas favoritas es "Algunos das eres el parabrisas; otros, el insecto".

Tiene mucha mas vala para mi una chica que vive buscando su camino en la vida, que progresa y que de pronto me la encuentro y poco a poco nace algo autentico, genuino a acercarme a una chica que ya subi y baj y no encontr. Creo sinceramente que debes trabajar mas en tu autoestima, no debes depender de un afecto para sentirte completa. Cuando te sientas realizada y llena, entonces atraers a una persona como t a la que si ser bueno que le abras la puerta a algo mas que la amistad, no a cualquiera, no vale la pena.|`|313e171241c6d5138a96b9928e8bd266aa	A mi me paso lo mismo dos veces, la primera estube 2 a?os y medio luchando contra el padre que no me aceptaba, era el unico problema, hasta que me canse y todo se termino a pesar deseguir amandola.

If you got it, you get any woman and any sexual act you desire.    BUT There are SOME genuine women out there.... The numbers are decreasing very rapidly but there are some.    You need to have a good sense of humour, be able to make people laugh and not get worked up about things. If people make fun of you infront of women laugh with them instead of getting upset etc. Handle it like a man and it will be water off a ducks back. Basically have fun and the women will like you for it (The genuine ones). Also don't get nervous - be confident. It's true - I never used to beleive it, but women don't like wimps. Doesn't matter if you are fat/thin as long as you are confident.    Women like maturity... well once you pulled her you can act however you want (once she's completely fallen for you) so maturity can be somewhaty shortlived ;)    If you can find a way to make tons of legal money, do it (and also let me know how)    Good luck    J|`|6528d0f69bf96d6695d5d2e5a7b14652aa	Loads of money, a nice car and a huge mansion.

I know there are some obvious exceptions out there, but I think the money thing is what guys tell themselves just to keep hope alive. Afterall, as difficult as it may be, it's still easier to get a lot of dough than it is a new face. If it's a choice between two handsome guys, then they'll want the one with more money most likely.    But, since you're only fifteen, I would hiiiiighly recommend buying an acoustic guitar, a capo, the Beatles Bible and learning a few timeless tunes. If you think you can't sing very well, just tune the guitar down a step. Take a few lessons to learn the basics. Find a place far away from anyone where you can yell and scream and cackle and push your voice's limitations without people discouraging you. For some reason, often, girls do like the guy who has managed to get all eyes on him, and you can do that by singing. Be aware that guys will get jealous, especially your age. Just keep practicing, patiently. Don't become a drummer. An acoustic guitar is the way to go. It's portable. You don't need a band. It's all you. Buy one that you can either have plugged in or not. Hang out at the coffee houses. Good stuff.

Lew remembers a lot about his grandfather, his grandfather had a big beard. It scratched Lew when he kissed him. Lew remembers his grandfather's big blue eyes. Lew's mother was surprised how Lew could picture his grandfather after so many years. This book reminded me about how I felt when my grandfather died. I really miss my own grandpa. My name is Matthew Stevenson. And the best thing about this book is it helps you remember your grandparents every time you read it.<br>  <br>  Here is reading rainbows video review: <a href="http://pbskids.org/readingrainbow/books/..." rel="nofollow">http://pbskids.org/readingrainbow/books/...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the link to amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/105-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/105-...</a><br>  <br>  It looks like its been reprinted twice.|`|on4ThDkQaa	There are a few books on it.

Maybe you could try this with your sister.  My little ones love doing this and they feel they can connect to their grandma this way.  I also remind them that grandma is an angel always looking after them and smiling down upon them everyday.<br>  <br>  I also bought the following book for my first daughter when my mother died.<br>  <br>  (You can find this book at most book stores or on line such as Amazon)<br>  WHAT'S HEAVEN?  <br>  by MARIA SHRIVER<br>  <br>  Maria Shriver provides a starting point—for people of all faiths—to discuss the difficult subject of death with their children in this story of a little girl, Kate, whose great-grandmother has just died. <br>  <br>  The many childlike and thought-provoking questions in this book come from Shriver's own children, nieces and nephews when her grandmother Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy passed away. With loving, confident and ultimately uplifting answers, Shriver taught her family, and will help to teach yours, how to come together, feel closer to one another and experience peace.

If your friends can read English, an American newspaper might be nice (I LOVE reading newspapers from other countries. It teaches you a lot about that country, what people are thinking, what they care about).  Or magazines for their age group.<br>  <br>  For foods, think traditional American foods that can travel well. Candy like Boston Baked Beans, or something that won't melt.  A box of Cracker Jacks maybe.  Things that have a real American character.|`|1f3b471d5810bc7fd40d10cf16368fc5aa	sounds like you're off to a great start!  you might also include some postcards from your local attractions...I always enjoyed postcards when I had penpals (and still collect them to this day.)

Sit the girl and your brother down and talk to them about this. You dont have to talk to them both at the same time nor do they have to be in the same room, but you are right in your mind to search out the facts before something gets serious and hearts get broken.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

Todas quisieron ponerse un piercing, o tatuar se, pero siempre respetaron la IMPOSICIN de sus padres o los CONSEJOS de sus padres.    Lo cierto del caso es que Nunca hicieron algo que nosotros no aprobamos.  No crees que ponerse esas cosas en el cuerpo podran traer consecuencias para tu salud?     Yo recuerdo que ellas nos decan que cuando fueran adultas , y no vivieran en nuestra casa, iban a ponerse todo lo que ellas quisieran y sin embargo hoy que son adultas ninguna se ha tatuado ni se ha puesto piercing.   Y mas bien en algn momento han dicho que por dicha nunca se los permitimos.  De manera que si pides consejo para ver como le dices a tu mama lo del piercing es porque de antemano sabes que ella no lo aprueba, de tal forma que es mejor que se te olvide ese asunto.   No la hagas sufrir y dale gracias a Dios que la tienes viva y te esta orientando aunque NO TIENES IDEA de lo que cuesta ser padre o madre.  Cuando crezcas y te cases la comprenders.

(?O me equivoco?)    Bueno aqu est el porqu.  En las ltimas dcadas, sobre todo en Europa, la liberacin femenina ya es un modo de vida.  ?Qu nos dice la liberacin femenina? ==> Que hombres y mujeres somos iguales.  ?Y qu crees!  Que no es cierto.  Hombres y mujeres somos ESENCIALMENTE iguales (en cuanto a condicin humana) pero ACCIDENTALMENTE diferentes (en cuanto a caractersticas fsicas, psicolgicas, emocionales y sociales).    Tambin creo que todos tenemos una tendencia a generalizar y hablamos as: TODOS los hombres... TODAS las mujeres... TODOS los ******... TODOS los alemanes... TODOS los espa?oles... etc.  Pero la realidad, es que somos individuos nicos e irrepetibles y esto es irreal.    Los hombres no "slo" piensan en sexo... eso es una falacia... tal vez, piensen en sexo la mayor parte del tiempo, o muy seguido pero "slo pensar en sexo" es una locura... pero bueno, tal vez exista por ah, en algn rincn del mundo, un hombre que de verdad SLO piense en sexo y nada ms...     El que el hombre piense en tener sexo y quiera sexo ms que la mujer, as como que sea infiel no es un vicio.  Es una caracterstica que se da por diversos factores fsicos, fisiolgicos y sociolgicos.  "Vicio" es una palabra vaga para describir algo tan complejo.    El hombre es, por naturaleza ms visual... el hombre enga?a porque ve el acto sexual como una necesidad fsica... inmediata... si una mujer extremadamente atractiva... le abre las piernas... cae directito!!!  La mujer, es DIFERENTE al hombre... para ella el acto sexual, involucra ms el aspecto emocional.  Es por esto que para una mujer es muy difcil perdonar una infidelidad... as como para un hombre es muy fcil cometerla...     Al momento de analizar la infidelidad... la mujer debera considerar las razones por las cuales el hombre le fue infiel... pero no lo hace porque es emocional.    En mi caso, si mi pareja me enga?ara... me sentira decepcionada, herida y traicionada... y si l me pidiera perdn... analizara la situacin bajo la cual me fue infiel... y a partir de ello, tomara mi decisin.    Deseo agregar lo siguiente:    YA BASTA DE DECIR QUE HOMBRES Y MUJERES SOMOS IGUALES... AMBOS TENEMOS DIGNIDAD PERO SE LOGRARA MS SI SUPIRAMOS RECONOCER QUE LA FORMA EN QUE PENSAMOS Y LA FORMA EN QUE VEMOS LA VIDA ES MUY DIFERENTE... SI ESTUDIAMOS MS LA MENTE HUMANA, LA MENTE DE LA MUJER Y LA DEL HOMBRE... LOGRAREMOS UN AVANCE MS EN LA CIVILIZACIN...    HOMBRES Y MUJERES NOS COMPLEMENTAMOS Y ESO ES LO BONITO DE ENTABLAR UNA RELACIN CON ALGUIEN QUE PARECE DE OTRO MUNDO..

Mgoyc9Oaaa	Purtroppo riesco a capirti perchè mi trovo in una situazione simile. La risposta "logica", quella che continuo a dare sempre a me stessa quando mi sento usata e poco rispettata e mi chiedo cosa dovrei fare, è di dirgli basta, che non sei una bambola e che non sei disposta a continuare così. poi però alla fine sono io la prima che quando fa il dolce con me e mi dice tutte quelle cose carine, quando tento di parlargli della situazione, tipo che comunque gli piaccio, che mi vuole rispettare ma che non può avere una relazione seria perchè il lavoro fuori glielo impedisce e non sarebbe giusto neppure per me, mi sciolgo e non posso fare altro che restare con lui. Magari tu riesci ad essere più forte di me e rompere tuto ma se non hai la forza di farlo perchè "quei pochi momenti che è proprio tuo" ti fanno sentire bene, non posso biasimarti. Scusa se non ti ho dato una soluzione vera e propria ma alla fine so quanto è difficile quando ti trovi nella situazione.

XDRYzneLaa	American dating is not neccesarily defined by quick sex, its defined by not having a defenition.  Dating in the US is very awkward with my generation (20yrs old) because some people don't want sex until marriage and others will demand it on the first date to stay interested.  If he is in his 40's he is probably more conservative and won't pressure you for sex early.  This may be wrong, and he may try to have sex with you, but you should still give it a try.  Try asking him to do something in a business setting, like a lunch or dinner to talk.  Make it just you and him so that he knows its not a strictly business affair, but there will still be a level of professionalism maintained.  Good luck and if he pressures you for sex before your ready just walk away.|`|jTHJhy2laa	You have his card,so call him.When you call give him your numbers.Tell him your thoughts in regard to seeing him in a non-work related way.Your friends are right about American men wanting sex quickly,but those are the 16-30 year olds who arent married yet.Give him some credit,and a chance.|`|8fnTSQHlaa	It never hurts to meet someone new. It's a very educating experience. You are both adults too...it doesn't really matter about the age difference. I am an American woman of Puerto Rican descent and met a nice Muslim man last year.

Go to www.dnsstuff.com and type in the originating IP address from the header of the e-mail (assuming you have it) and it will locate where it is coming from.      Or, if you don't have the actual e-mail you can type in the host and get a contact number.  Sometimes if you call them they will give you the e-mail owner's name.    Good luck!

887ee0203d8e48a89e96fce8b83f35e9aa	So the best way around this is to be friends with everyone. When SHE comes along you are friends first. Make sure ALL your friends know that you are a virgin and plan to stay that way until marriage. Be proud of yourself adn your morals! It sound so much better coming from your friends, male ones is best. Then she will know you are for real!!<br>  <br>  Questions<br>  1. As for the fear it is just the unknown, not only  that you will move too fast, but that it wilor even that it won't work.<br>  <br>  2. Be yourself. In front of anyone. Don't change who you are.<br>  <br>  3.No, not always. What if it is a mistake or a bad kiss?? There has to be a talk about you only seeing eachother and a mutual agreement before it is a relationship.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

b3af48a7956596e9b98e122a5e51b828aa	I just dealt with this situation. My friend is an extreme Drama Queen. She causes so many problems in her life. Ex: Last year her husband was helping remodel our house, she accused he & I of sleeping together during that time, nevermind that my husband was with us the WHOLE time and I am happily married. Plus, her hubby is NOT my type. Well, this crap just popped back up again cuz she has created many problems again & her husband just left her. My hubby & I say good for him & we know he'll find another woman soon who'll make him happy cuz he's a good guy. I say bye bye to her cuz she is just a train wreck waiting to happen every day & she drags everyone down into it.  Stop putting up with the nonsense. Friends shouldn't be people that give us headaches, they should offer us tylenol when we have one from dealing with all the morons out there we have to deal with everyday at work, school, etc...|`|421f28f28da7ae5cdc181313a2975b3faa	sure ,, coz she is a best friend..    http://www.thestarlitecafe.com/poems/101...    plese read more poems, and leave me there your comments..  yours  hazem|`|AA11091692	It is better to be friend with oneself instead of compromising your standards.

It is interesting how givers and takers tend to wind up linked to one another...I guess because they complement each other...until the giver is burnt out and the taker finds out there's no amount of giving that will satisfy.    A true friendship is mutually beneficial.  So if you find yourself giving and giving and giving to the relationship and all you're getting back is either "nonsense" or "nothing back", at that point you just need to distance yourself from that person.  You owe it to yourself to surround yourself with nurturers, supporters, and people who are not afraid to be transparent, vulnerable, and real when they need the same from you.

AA10975730	1. Una amiga siempre puede llegar a ser algo ms.  Si en este momento te llevas con ella en plan de amigos y no ves inters de su parte, entonces en este momento es slo una amiga.  Tal vez tu quieres que alguien te asegure de una vez por todas si s o si no, pero esto nunca va a suceder.  Debes tener ms confianza en t mismo y si la quieres... hacer el esfuerzo... nunca nadie te va a asegurar eso.  No puedes decir... con ella no lo voy a intentar porque ella est en la clasificacin de "no puede ser algo ms".      2. Todo depende de su personalidad.  Tal vez tu amiga sea tmida y si le gustas un poco pero tu no haces nada y la tratas como amiga pues nunca se va a dar nada porque ninguno de los dos da el primer paso.  Mira, tu tienes que sentir de ella si hay un rechazo o si hay una ataccin... eso luego, luego se ve... lo que dicen... qumica... primero identifica esto... y... si hay qumica ya la hiciste!      Por mi experiencia yo nunca he visto a ningn amigo como ms que amigos, si l no da el primer paso...     SI QUIERES QUE TE VEAN COMO MS QUE AMIGO... EMPIEZA A ACTUAR COMO MS QUE AMIGO... Y A HACER COSAS QUE HACEN QUIENES VEN A LA CHAVA COMO MS QUE AMIGOS... no tengas miedo... tal vez te rechace o tal vez no... pero si tu no das el primer paso... siempre tendrs la duda...

256b498c67adfe0b13bdc0921ec3daccaa	Welcome to the world of peer pressure.  There is going to be very little in your life tougher to over come then peer pressure.  It is something that you will encounter for much of your life.  As you get older and gain more control over what you like/dislike, want/don't want, it will become easier and easier to over come.  The first thing to remember is that you are responsible for your own actions.  You need to decide what it is that you want and don't want.  Do not let anyone else make those decisions for you, once you start letting others control you, you are going to get yourself into serious trouble.  You need to tell your friends that you do not wish to drink and that they need to respect your decision.  The sooner you get them to understand this the better off you are going to be in the future when the next peer pressure item comes up.  Take charge of your own destiny and don't give in.

AND, even if it was difficult, rape is never excusable.  the nurse is blaming the victim?  she needs help.<br>  <br>  if you don't want father to find out, diffiicult.  you can confront him--with a hidden recorder--can't  use in court maybe, but you can intimidate him--he'll worry.  and he really should be reported so he won't do this to anyone else.<br>  <br>  just keep working on  your own therapy--and don't let anyone  make you think any of this  iis your fault.  good luck!|`|AA10028631	I am soooo sorry that you had to be in this situation.

e21ffd99ebeb3558bd8cbae300b5d3eaaa	I am in the same boat as you. I broke up with my long distance boyfriend recently and I keep thinking about him. I think whenever a relationship ends you have a period of grieving. It is hard to say if you are just grieving the loss of that relationship or if it is something else. The last couple of days I have been keeping a journal of my thoughts about my ex boyfriend and our relationship and it has helped me sort my thoughts. I suggest you try that. No one can tell you if your relationship is truly over but you. And sometimes, the things that are worth having the most are hardest on us and costs us the most. I am not going to tell you that you should go back to your boyfriend or you should move on. But what I will tell you that whatever you ultimately decide just make sure you can live with that decision. Good luck|`|11678e1255841243e42d85f783199a10aa	Try getting yourself involved in other things to take your mind off of the problem. Hang out with friends, watch a movie, read a book.. anything. It may take a while, but eventually it wont hurt as much when you think of him. Don't get a new boyfriend just to distract you, that will only create another issue for you. Take this time for yourself to heal and grow.|`|ffa536b8f85fd05c8d52d57caeda20f5aa	well it depends on how old you are...if you live on your own and you both love each other very much have you considered relocating....<br>  <br>  true love is worth the effort|`|pl9gpFFmaa	It's a bit strange because this seems like a situation I am about to embark on. It all really depends on how close you two became throughout the relationship and how far away you have been for these past six months. I think that if you are certain about moving on and closing this chapter but still remain friends, that you should look for social activities or things that make you happy to keep you from giving in and getting back with this guy. This is only if you are positive about being a single gal though. However, I dont think that a new boyfriend is the right remedy to this issue. It might confuse the new guy (if there will be one) becuase he could be thinking a lot more of you while you only see him as a rebound guy. If you're unsure about the break up then I think you should have a serious talk with this guy. Hopefully he doesn't use persuasive tactics to make you change your mind from what you really wanna do. Be strong and stand behind your decision whatever it ends up being. Good Luck.

f2e275c6c286bc66bf166e78674e9d45aa	It's called the three second rule. If you don't make a decision within three seconds, it's too late. Next time- it may sound nerve-racking, but just don't even think about it, lean in fast and lay one on the lips and keep them there and see what happens next, he will either back off and run-(wuss) or he will continue the kiss-which is the result you want. It works everytime, and NO!  the guy does NOT have to make the first move, I think, in-fact, we like it when the girl makes the first move. Good Luck!|`|278a58QMaa	Pretend to kiss him and pull back, if he wants to kiss he'll follow through|`|RO4vEqnMaa	I second what Thomas said. If he does continue, go through with it.

Es muy difícil acertar, los hay que parecen colegas y luego están ahí cuando los necesitas, y los hay que parecen amigos y cuando llegan los problemas salen corriendo. Es algo en lo que todos nos arriesgamos. Pero de entrada, elimina a los que te hagan la pelota, son mejores los sinceros que te dicen las verdades a la cara; a los que hayas pillado en alguna mentira; y los que tengan una corte de "amigos", hay un dicho que dice "amigo de todos, amigo de nadie". También están los que parece que hacen de todo por tí, como prestarte algo, ir a verte a algún sitio, etc, cosas peque?as pero insistentes, te hablan mucho... al final te pedirán un favor. Cuando se lo hagas o decidas no hacérselo, dejarán de ser tus amigos.

86f427c002bf7802eb337f6998e2989aaa	LOVE IS THE FEELING IN YOUR HEART AND HOW WILL YOU EXPERIENCE THE JOY OF LOVING AND BEING LOVED IF THE PAIN DOSENT COME AND GO     There was a time in my life when I became afraid to fall in love.  Because every time I fell in love, I got hurt.   I thought maybe that's why it's called falling in love.  I would give my all, loving deeply and wholeheartedly.  It would be a truly emotional and euphoric experience.  I would be dreaming about the object of my affection day and night, imagining good times together, thinking of what I can do or buy for him to show how much I care.   I would feel light, energized and excited, blooming with the joy I feel inside.  Then somehow, something would go wrong and my whole world crash.    Disappointed, Resentment, Anger, Pain, Why?  Can we not love without feeling pain?  Is it really a price to pay for all the happiness we feel when we're in love?  It was only after many years of soul searching and reading inspirational writings that I realized that we could love without getting hurt.  Only recently did I understand what unconditional love is all about.    Love is one of the most powerful forces in the universe.  It is the fire that burns inside, the essence of being.  It is a precious gift that defines our purpose in life.  If we keep in mind that we can indeed preserve its true meaning, we can love to the fullest and be truly happy.    Accept the fact that other people express theirlove differently.  How do you express love?  You say "I love you three times a day".  You kiss and embrace as often as you can.  You never forget anniversaries.  You always prepare his favorite dishes.  How does he express love?  He rarely says, "I love you".  He seldom kisses you.  He forgets your birthday and he doesn't know how to cook.  But he works overtime, walks the dog, takes out the garbage,  takes you to the movies and calls you "Honey".  He probably loves you more than you can imagine.  He just shows it differently.  If you can accept that then you will have a healthier perspective of your relationship.    Derive happiness from giving love.  When you love, do it because you want to.  Just give it.  And cherish the satisfaction in having given someone something of yourself.  It's like giving a gift whether it is appreciated or not, find joy in simply giving.  Love without expecting anything in return.  Pain comes in when you demand something in return for the love you give.  You are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Love cannot always be reciprocal.  Love between two people can never be of the same intensity at the same time and place.  No matter how much your partner loves you, he/she will never fill all your needs all the time.  And you will be waiting in misery forever, if you believe you should love only when you are sure to receive equal love in return.    Love now.  The past is gone and the future is justa dream.  All of yesterday's aches and pains, as well as the loves and laughter, are mere memories.  Let them go.  Fantasies and worries are for a future that may never come.  Don't dwell on them.  Live now.  Give love now. Do it and enjoy it now.  Throw away those destructive habits.  When you insist upon yourself that you always have to be in control, that you always have to be right, that others must always please you, you put yourself in a very tight spot.    Loving relationships are flexible- Dynamic and evolving.  Leave room now for a change interaction.  Allow for new behavior and learning experiences.  When we welcome these in our lives, we open ourselves to sharing more love and affection and less frustration and pain.    Yes, you will say unconditional love is easier said than done.  Especially when we have always believed that love is give and take.  But believe that love is simply giving.  And you will be surprised that a lot of it, even more, actually comes back to you|`|AA12231405	READ IT CAREFULLY THEN YOU WILL SURELY KNOW WHAT IT IS ....  Love is a condition or phenomenon of emotional primacy, or absolute value. Love generally includes an emotion of intense attraction to either another person, a place, or thing; and may also include the aspect of caring for or finding identification with those objects, including self-love. Love can describe an intense feeling of affection, an emotion or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience usually felt by a person for another person. Love is commonly considered impossible to define.    The concept of love, however, is subject to debate. Some deny the existence of love, calling it a recently invented abstraction. Others maintain that love exists but is indefinable; being a quantity which is spiritual, metaphysical, or philosophical in nature. The views that love does not exist or is indefinable may underlie the fact that approximately 13 percent of cultures have no word for love. [1] [2] The remaining 87 percent attempt to define this abstract concept and apply it to everyday life. Love is one of the most common themes in art and often times is an excuse for " bad art". Some psychologists maintain that love is the abstract action of lending one's "boundary" or "self esteem" to another  Overview    Love has several different meanings in the English language, from something that gives a little pleasure to something for which one would die. And in contrast to the definition at the top, frequently people use the verb "love" to indicate want or desire for themselves as opposed to for another. For example: "I love that lamp," does not refer to desiring wellness for the lamp, but rather to the desire for the lamp. The word also frequently indicates elevated appreciation or admiration: "I love that artist," An individual might state.    Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. Expressions of love may include the love for a soul or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, and love for the respect of others. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. Many believe, as stated originally by Virgil that "Love conquers all", or as stated by The Beatles, "All you need is love". Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of 'absolute value', as opposed to 'relative value'.      Types      Courtly love  a late medieval conventionalized code prescribing certain conduct and emotions for ladies and their lovers   Erotic love  desire characterized by sexual desires   Familial love  affection brokered through kinship connections, intertwined with concepts of attachment and bonding   Free love  sexual relations according to choice and unrestricted by marriage   Platonic love  a close relationship in which sexual desire is nonexistent or has been suppressed or sublimated   Puppy love  romantic affection that is not "mature" or not "true." The term reflects a bias that love between youngsters is somehow less valid.   Religious love  devotion to one's deity or theology   Romantic love  affection characterized by a mix of emotional and sexual desire   True love - love without condition, motive or attachment. Loving someone just because they are themselves, not their actions or beliefs in particular.   Unrequited love  affection and desire not reciprocated or returned     Scientific views    Throughout history, predominantly, philosophy and religion have speculated the most into the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of psychology has written a great deal on the subject. Recently, however, the sciences of evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, neuroscience, and biology have begun to take centre stage in discussion as to the nature and function of love.    Biological models of sex tend to see it as a mammalian drive, just like hunger or thirst. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg created his Triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components : Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by seperating Passion into two independents components : Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.      Cultural views    Although there exist numerous cross-cultural unified similarities as to the nature and definition of love, as in there being a thread of commitment, tenderness, and passion common to all human existence, there are differences. For example, in India, with arranged marriages commonplace, it is believed that love is not a necessary ingredient in the initial stages of marriage  it is something that can be created during the marriage; whereas in Western culture, by comparison, love is seen as a necessary prerequisite to marriage.      Religious views    Love, in the form of subjective devotion, seems to have been originally understood as the proper response to idealised objective natural forces (pagan polytheism). Later religions shifted the emphasis towards single abstractly-oriented objects like God, the law, the book, and the church (formalised monotheism).    Alongiside these two objects o|`|AA10911176	Love is what makes you smile when you are tired.    I once heard a 4 year old say that.

(No lo tomes a mal, no es por ofender).  No entiendo qu es lo que quieres saber exactamente, tu pregunta y tu aclaracin parecen dos cosas distintas...  Yo pienso esto, cuando conoces a una persona y crees que es el amor de tu vida, idealizas la relacin.  Por ejemplo, cuando conociste a tu pareja actual... en aqul tiempo... pensabas que l sera el nico hombre al que llegaras a amar tanto, tanto... (razn por la cual supongo decidieron hacer una vida juntos)... Sin embargo, esto no significa que todo permanezca siempre igual.  Pienso que a lo largo de tu vida conocers a personas hacia las cuales te sientas sumamente atrada, fsicamente, sexualmente, emocionalmente... pero lo bonito de hacer una vida con alguien es, que a pesar de esto, por amor a l y por respeto... tratas de ignorar esos fuertes sentimientos hacia otras personas que parecen igualmente maravillosas.  S que puedes llegar a amar a alguien ms, pero ?qu ya no amas a tu actual pareja?... Pienso que l est haciendo "ruido" en tu vida y en tu corazn... porque para ser sincera, el amor es mucho ms que sentir un gran aprecio y atraccin por alguien... el amor es algo ms GRANDE... el amor es entrega, sacrificio, el amor es compartir, dar y recibir, el amor es un TODO que se manifiesta en obras diarias... como l est con otra persona t no lo puedes amar... eso de "lo amo en secreto", "lo amo pero el no lo sabe"... son patra?as... para amarlo de verdad tendras que estar con l... sacrificarte por l, disfrutar con l...     T te refieres ms bien a que lo aprecias mucho, te gusta mucho... y eso no es amor, es enamoramiento, que es diferente.

You basically take calls from viewers of home shopping channels.   If you have high speed internet then you are in business.

AA11773820	Challenging and difficult, though they may not be what we want to hear, are the words that best describe long distance relationships. Keep in mind however, that the words are challenging and difficult, not impossible. Many people choose to give a long distance relationship a try, with the constant curiosity if it was the right decision to make and if it even stands a chance. The truth is, a long distance relationship has just as much a chance of succeeding as any other relationship!     Long Distance Relationships share the same facts as an average relationship. It involves two people who share an interest in each other's lives, care for one another and of course have a love for each other that they hope will only continue to grow. On the other hand, a long distance relationship does have its differences as well. It takes away your ability to see each other on a frequent note, as well as the choice of being intimate whenever you desire, not to mention that there would be major trust required. Being unable to spend time together in a physical presence makes it harder to hang on to, but does not spell out doom for your relationship.     The first step is to make an agreement of what your expectations are in the relationship and how much of a commitment you are willing to give and receive. If the two of you decide to be monogamous, then it is clear that neither of you will be dating anyone else as long as your romantic relationship exists. Being clear about what you both want is extremely important, especially in a long distance relationship, in order to prevent future misunderstandings and mistakes. Do not feel afraid to tell your partner what you really need and want from him or her, you deserve the chance to speak from your heart and he or she deserves to know the truth and judge whether they can give it to you.     Trust is a major necessity if you wish to have your relationship from a distance. Without trust and honesty, the relationship is in for danger and unsuccessfulness, just as it would be any other relationship. By accepting the challenge of a long distance relationship, you also accepted the fact that you will have to have the trust and faith that your partner will not be seeing anyone else as promised. Being paranoid and accusing will only grow doubts, insecurity and tension between you and none of those three will help the relationship survive successfully.     Keeping each other informed of the friendships you have with other people and the events that take place in your personal life is a great way to keep your relationship alive and healthy; and continues to make your partner a part of your life. It is essential that you receive the same information from your partner as well, so you both feel the same security and satisfaction that you both crave. Be creative with the way you keep in touch, such as calling, e-mailing, faxing and sending cards. Pay attention to how many times a week you are staying in touch as well. If you want your bond to stay strong and loving, you have to hear from one another often, leaving as little room for any of you to start getting paranoid about anything. Although you cannot be romantic towards each other on a physical note, you can still perform romantic acts that will keep the romance department happy. You can do this by sending love letters and poems, having flowers and gifts delivered, or even sending a video of yourself with a loving message. Reminding your partner of how much you think about and love him or her will score high points, making them miss you more with the constant urge to see you.     Planning reunions play a big part in keeping your relationship exciting, plus serve you the satisfaction of being able to see and touch each other occasionally. It gives you the opportunity to catch up on each other's life in person and to be able to share physical and intimate activities together, which will fulfill both of your needs and desires. Not re-uniting every once in a while will only damage the relationship you have, so if one of you are not willing to visit the other occasionally, then you may need to question the interest and care your partner has for you and should probably end the relationship and move on. If you and your partner truly want this to work out, then you will both continue to be eager to see each other as often as you can and every time to have the chance to.     Setting a limit of how long you will be apart is a wise thing to do if you do not want to end up waiting forever. There will be a day when you and your partner will have to start planning a serious future, which can only happen when you are living in the same area or perhaps even living together, whichever makes you most comfortable. If none of you are willing to agree on a place to settle and start having a relationship where you see each other on a regular basis, then you can pretty much forget about accomplishing anything out of your long distance relationship. If your partner truly loves you and wants to be with you, then they would not want to wait forever to be with you.     With the right amount of effort and interest on both parts, a long distance relationship can survive the obstacles it will frequently be challenged with. As long as you both refresh your memories of why you chose to do this in the first place, trust each other, inform one another of your personal lives, keep in touch, and visit, your relationship can turn out to be one of the most successful and happy relationships that ever existed. You both will be secure, happy and satisfied until the day comes when you will re-unite for good and build your wonderful future together.|`|AA11716484	bcaz the relationships , meant only that relation of one person to another|`|a366c1be331657f515b7983f6a810ee5aa	cause when you're apart.... there are a lot of temptations around.

AA11439736	Sounds like she might be alittle interested in you, but it could also just be her personality.

Is your question "is it incidental"?   if so, prolly she set it up OR incidental and shes using that as an excuse to "flirt" with you. Maybe... Either that, or she really likes you "as a friend" and just wants to know you better. Maybe she wants to just get a better relationship with you as a co worker. Maybe these accidents were minor to you, but seemed like a big deal to her. I guess it depends. go with ur heart dude|`|4289419735dd6d82375a056a47dde820aa	You never know, don't jump to conclusions wait for her to come to you if you want to give her the time of day.

But if your a risk taker ask her?|`|f02ebe299774219b6475c16b0d27b6d9aa	Shutup, go and date other women, learn to please other women and become a MAN. Don't trip over co-workers, cause it goes like this: co-workers have 'crushes' on other co-workers so the day is more fun and goes by quicker, (that's what YOU are doing too). She maybe into you by a 'crush' method, but being in a 'relationship' or even 'dating' this woman who has ISSUES will suck, don't matter if she/he is hot or not, it will cause (undifined) problems. Forget it be a real MAN and get out there and date real women who like to have real fun and are lovable, and most importantly LEARN to give "it" to them (sex).

Maybe, you're so uncomfortable with yourself being single is just more frightening than being with a cheater? You can't give him the benefit of the doubt forever. Ask yourself honestly why would he be emailing another woman? How did he find his email address? To me it all sounds like he was looking for a woman to email.     So what happens if you do trust him this once? You check his email occasionally, with his permission this time, to make sure he's not doing it again, but how will you know if he has set up a second email address for this purpose? you're going to spend the rest of your life checking up on him. you need to find a decent man who you'd trust with your life, and never need to check the emails of.    Take care. Be strong. Katie

I think you were naive in your decision.|`|f9c76a1dd583988f69b56f0365a87ba4aa	See, no living creature ever makes us do, say or think things we do or dont want to. We allow ourselves to respond the way we want. For instance, no one makes us get angry, we allow ourselves to get angry! Meaning we are fully and wholly accountable for our responses to other people or things.     Whereas one cannot injustify your feelings of deception, I think you owe it to your husband to sought out this issue with him being that it is causing you alot of heartache and barring you from enjoying your marriage to him. I say you discuss this issue openly with your husband. Let him know how and why you feel deceived. Avoid doing this when angry or bitter at him. Do it with love and when you are willing to forgive any wrong he has done against you.     When discussing this issues and probably all the other issues against him that are in your heart, be prepared to forgive him and forget about the past. Pray to God to give you this heart. YOu need it in marriage. Marriage is full of sacrifices. We cannot do it alone. We need God's guidance and help. Just forgive, forget and concentrate of building a respectful marriage based on mutual trust and love.    Work on being very open in communication with your hubby. Again love is more than feelings. Feelings change everyday. Try and avoid basing your issues on how you feel and try being objective about them.       As for the other man in your life- stay away from him. He will only add more heartache and more dissatisfaction in your marriage. All you will see in your hubby compared to this man will be despicable and distasteful and you will want out. Remember your vows not only to your husband but before God and the congregation of friends and families who attended your wedding. Set the right example, no one said we are perfect. Love your husband- He is the most important person in your life and you are the most important person in his life.

Aparently it's our minds telling us that the challenge is worth the risked emotion, and when the challenge is met, then our need is fulfilled, and so you stop liking him. I was also told that it has to do with a lack of emotional connection. You don't really WANT to be in a relationship, but you feel the need to be wanted. For example, you can't take rejection, even if it is completely minor.|`|22db9a544654513bdf5832391fd72582aa	then he's not the one for you. the same thing kinda happened to me. you shouldn't hurry into liking someone a whole lot. just wait a bit and you will find a guy that you like and if you find out he likes you, then you'll like him even more.|`|756ca35e732a088583140e98e359afb9aa	It's some crazy unexplainable story, it's like a cycle and this is bad; nothing about it is good. if you've decided to give that person a chance or viceversa, then a difference can be made, don't be too quick to give up because when it seems like that's it sometimes it's not and then you end up feeling sorry for yourself or viceversa. i know that feeling but i ain't plan to go back on that road. so keep it real and God bless.|`|08f3b28ec477b077e04f885afe0f14e7aa	So maybe you just need to rethink this, if you don't like him when he likes you, and he doesn't like you when you like him then maybe this is all about attention, and perhaps just wanting what you know you can't have.  Do YOU think it will work out, becuase that's the important thing.    p.s.

Its probaly because when your at the phrase when you really like him alot, you are liek i guess thinking how he would be if he finally liked you nd if you guys got together, but when he finaly likes you nd the way he treats you or talks to you is probaly different abotu what you would thought, and that would probaly make you less attracted to you. well thats just what i think. hope that helps|`|f54e54fef7ca9b2cd3a39a784875960baa	Nasty, so what your saying is, your a tease. You enjoy getting men to go after you, but when they do, their no longer good enough because you've won, you've conqured another trophy.

If he can't handle the stress, tell him to hire someone who can. If he's an ***, tell him he needs to get over it and grow up. It's part of being an adult.|`|E6x6fYn5aa	1st spend 364 days in preparation by making sure there are no hidden surprises that he will find out about on tax day.  You wouldn't want to find out about a secret fishing boat he bought without telling you, right? Keep everything together, for me the worst part of doing taxes is trying to track down receipts or bills that have disappeared.    2nd, if you don't need to be there, don't be there, tell him you are going to the park, or visit a relatives or some other FREE place.  ...OR...  Offer to do the taxes yourself and let him be the one to have a day off.    3rd, If you do have to be there, refuse to engage in any arguments, if he starts one just close your eyes and take another drink of coffee.      4th If tax time is so pain full for you, you two probably spent to much last year, make a budget and follow it this year.  Or claim 0 depend ants at your work so that too much money is deducted from your paycheck little by little, that way you will always get all that extra money back at tax time.   If you are not making enough money, create a plan even if it is a 8-10 year plan to get your income to where you need it to be, and follow it, if you don't move neither will your income.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Oh escape while you can.

Pj81dRTAaa	You're absolutely right. People aren't willing to work things out and the moment things get rocky, they leave, sometimes regretting it when its too late. Such people hardly ever settle down because, all relationships are like this, things get difficult after the honeymoon period. I think its a level of maturity that many people do not have, as well as what you mentioned about love stories and movies, especially soap operas. You raised a very good point, sorry about your situation though.|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	I agree...|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	Marraige is always sacred unless it is for the  wrong reasons then it shouldn't be so !

I feel Communication is the most important thing in a relationship.  If you can't talk things out then you have nothing.  Keep  your values up & you will meet the right person who will believe the same way you do.  Let me know how things turn out.  I'm lucky I have found someone who believes the same way i do.|`|VDAKIrPraa	I have no clue how old you are but when i was growing up in the 60 and 70;s, no one had parents who were divorced. Those who did kept it secret like it was illegal to be divorced. Was that because our parents respected their vows and stayed together no matter what? Is it to easy nowadays to divorce?? I married someone and stayed with him for 15 years, but I didnt love him. I liked and respected him , but I foolishly thought I would grow to love him. It didnt happen. I told him I was not happy, he told me to get over it, I told him we needed to see a counselor and he told me to find one and go. He never saw my unhappiness and when I told him I was leaving, he was shocked. People you need to communicate with each other, if one doesnt listen, then find a way to make them listen.  My kids were older when I left but it still scarred them, so dont stay for the sake of your kids.  If you are married to someone, you should be anxious to see them, want to be with them, get excited when you hear thier voice. Sure as time goes on, marriages endure alot of ups and downs, but if you can talk things through, you can save your marriage. Giving up is to easy now a days, but I firmly believe once you meet someone you love, its for life, i know for a fact because I found my soul mate and havae been married for almost 6 years, when its right, you just KNOW|`|Yt0z0cu6aa	Well...it's fine to think that way but, we all know that the other person has to think that way as well. I use to be like you. Then I figured out that marriage was only sacred to me, and my spouse who was neither spiritual or god-fearing...didn't see it the same way. She got desperate when she couldn't find a place to stay and a job..so while we were still married, she met another guy. They got married a month after our divorce finalized. During the whole time, I was trying my best to convince her to stay, but I was not aware that there was already another that was waiting in the wings. That explains how my efforts were futile, and my love for her was irrelevant. So, maybe marriage is just a legality issue..not sacred at all.|`|4POGapREaa	I agree with you.  I still believe that there are a lot of people who have a firm grip on reality but being on this board in particular can definitely drag you down.  Never in my life did I think of marriage as a fairytale so maybe that's why I'm always prepared for the ups & downs & I try to just roll with it.  I never dreamed about my wedding as a child & I can't stand romantic comedies.  I gather your issues were mostly about money?  It's really hard when financial issues pop up & I know that all too well considering what's been happening lately.  It has put a major strain on my relationship & for a while I kept thinking that if I just had the job & the money I used to have that everything would be okay.  But that's not true.  The way a couple acts in a time of crisis speaks volumes about their commitment to each other.  If someone wants to walk when the chips are down, then I say let 'em.  That's not someone who's working WITH you, that's someone who's working AGAINST you, and while I'm not an advocate of divorce, I think we all deserve better than that.  You can't force someone to care more than they do so chalk it up to what it is & move on.  You can't be the only one trying.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	It is sad.  But what is also sad is when you are married to someone who thinks they can treat you however badly they want because they know you don't believe in divorce.  Sometimes the other person needs to know you have some serious limits are they treat you really badly.    Sounds like your ex treated you really badly and didn't do anywhere near her fair share of the work.  Find someone else, there are many women who will treat you better than that.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Marriage is just a big joke nowadays. if one spouse is trying to do something to fix the problem, but the other isn't, why should the two stay? And you also got people who married for the wrong reasons, to the wrong person at the wrong time. marriage is just not taken seriously anymore.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Some people will divorce before there is cheating because cheating is where they are in their marriage if they stay.  Just thought I'd throw that in for whatever it's worth.    It isn't just about "being happy."  It can be about being truly miserable and believing yourself to be doing time in a life sentence.      It takes two people, fully committed to make a marriage work.  Never forget that again, if you remarry.   Because this doesn't happen overnight with a woman.  She doesn't just wake up one day and say, "I'm leaving you, I'm not happy."  She has usually exhausted every one of her communication skills and you just weren't paying any attention.  If I'm wrong, I'm sorry, because it can work that way for men, too.  I'm not trying to be gender-biased, but I am a woman who left a miserable marriage behind and I do not regret it.|`|t81MEJ82aa	People have a tendency to romanticize what marriage "used to be". This notion that it was all about love, commitment, and communication is bogus and never actually existed. Divorce rates are high because it is not socially unacceptable to get one anymore. I don't have a problem with divorces per se, just that people are getting married for the wrong reasons to begin with and have unrealistic notions of marriage which brings me back to my first point. The religious base of it has been removed from marriage but yet people are still trying to apply these archaic notions to their own marriage, even though they ultimately do not believe those outdated values. It's time to revamp marriage; people should define what it should be for themselves.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Men and women fall in love because of looks, first and foremost.    Anything else that might be possibly a negative is overlooked in the process. The PROBLEM is, over time, these negative attributes can no longer be overlooked because they assume the forefront of the issues.    That is precisely why couples get tired of each other, replacing affection with hatred.    If 2 people looked the same they did at age 45 as they did at 20, none of this would be happening. Technology is just not there yet.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	What I see is a lot of ding-dongs have married each other.   I for one married a man I know I belong with. 14 years and the inability to leave his side tells me so.|`|NuCu5RbTaa	i would never run as long as ,my husband has a lot of money. money solve everything|`|rx20pKgOaa	I agree 100%.  Did you see the question earlier about, "my husband is annoying, I think I want a divorce?"  Or how about, "I'm just not in love anymore. How do I tell him/her I want to leave?"    Is maturity and responsibility not taught in families anymore?  Don't people realize that Everyone gets annoying?  Every spouse can be irritating?  Good marriages don't happen because 2 people "Just Happen" to be right for each other. Good, long lasting marriages happen because people decide to Be the Right One!    I don't claim to be perfect - both my husband and I were married before.  But we learned when you get a new spouse you only get a different set of problems but there are ALWAYS problems.  It is not the lack of problems that make a marriage work.  It is the willingness of both parties to work through the problems and become better people that makes a relationship work.    Ok, there's my rant for the day. Thank you for asking! :)|`|lGSv138Paa	You have a very strong point!!|`|xGshAiXOaa	We have created a disposable society, if we don't like something we get a new one.  Cars, houses, jobs - why not trade in your husband or wife for a new, better, shinier model?  Simply put, people aren't happy with what they have anymore, they want more, more, more.      No, that's not the way I look at things, but I think that mentality is what has caused the downfall of the institution of marriage.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	No 2 relationships are the same and all need to be dealt with without "sweeping generalisations".  I have been in a marriage with no money worries and parking for 12 cars, dining out 5 nights a wk with not quite celebs but with ppl well known on the Island I lived on.  I have also had a long term relationship where due to a breakdown he had we were left with just 35 pr wk to live on for food.  It was very hard.  Ask me though which one I would choose and it certainly would not be the one with parking for 12 cars - which may surprise alot of ppl.  Relationships are very unique but yes I agree many walk away at the first sign of trouble.  However, long gone are the days ppl stay together in loveless marriages for the sake of the children.  Why should children be brought up in the sort of environment where they pick up atmospheres easily and realise Mum & Dad don't love each other.  Yes try to work things through but sometimes it is just not an option.  I also agree no one shoud feel fear in the comfort of ther own home yet her in UK 2 women are actually killed EVERY week because of domestic violence - the silent killer but it is still being pushed under the carpet - these ppl should not stay yet many do - many have no option they are practically prisoners in their own homes.    You say you shouldn't leave yr spouse beacuse you are unhappy - ok I do feel you should talk things through why someone is unhappy and take it from there but why stay if you are unhappy ??  Surely this is just as bad isn't it as having an affair ?  No one should stay around and be miserable, surely if you knew yr wife/husband/partner whatever was unhappy you wouldn't want them to remain like that would you.  You shold always want the very best for yr partner and aid their development in life surely ?  You cannot do this if you are insisting they stay despite being unhappy - what positive contribution can this make to the partnership ?  None.    SECURITY IS BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT !!!!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	I a gree with you.  i was married to someone who was an abusive drunk who would call me nasty names and who had grabbed me by my throat and thrown me against the wall and who had punched me in the back of my neck. I am now married to the most wonderful man. i would most definitely work things out if things got hard as long as he never cheats  . it is just too easy for people to get divorced. i think they should be made to go through counseling and a marriage workshop type thing first before letting them get a divorce.
fmHHcFd5aa	wow woman on here are stupid lol. its a proven fact sex after marriage slows down no matter what. The woman dont see it. Woman are more sex freaks and after marriage its not a huge issue. theres more to a marriage then freakn sex which is what the woman on here are making it seem like thats the only thing. you shouldnt not stay married to someone becaue sex slows down. nor did u marry the wrong person just bc of sex reasons.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	you get bord|`|XbZIicftaa	That's not always true.  In any case, I think for most people it's not the marriage itself, but having kids, or just the fact that you've been together for so long.

Marriage only makes sex better and better.  I think people use excuses like work, children etc...as a reason not to have sex.

Women use sex to "get" you, and after they realize they  "got " you, now the challenge is over with.    I also believe that once women have children, the reason for lack of sex drive is contributed to the fact that they have reproduced.  They have done their "job" in the natural scheme of being human.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I agree with the others in that boredom is the first thing. Secondly, I'd assume that there comes this mentality of "I've got him/her now", so I don't have to put out like I once did, or do the things I did to get her. It's  really sad actually, but unless these things are squared away before hand, you can expect trouble in the long run.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	If you   - Let your wife know that it is really important to you AND   - You make the effort to learn what makes it fun for her also AND   - You make an effort in general to ensure she is happy AND   - You make it clear that it is not optional to starve you of sex THEN   You should be ok.      If you don't get all those things right, well, hmmm, I think you might end up getting carpal tunnel syndrome from having to provide "self service" in that department.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	If you marry the right person the sex keeps going.....      We've been married for 17 years and we still have lots of sex.
gfHutvEFaa	what....do you think the court will say, "ok, u have too many kids, so instead of being the responsible father and paying for the children you laid down  and made, I am only going to make you pay for 2 of them. The remaining 3 will be given free money from the tax payers". C'mon!    BTW......if the guy just up and quits his job, the courts will still go on the 40k he was making. If the dude gets laid off or fired and decides to just not work so he doesn't have to pay child support, the system will take 40 hours per week at minimum wage and set it to that.    Here is a suggestion to all the guys out there who think they are getting scammed when a women shows up at his door pregnant..........WHERE A CONDOM. DON'T HAVE SEX. USE YOUR OWN HAND. Seems pretty simple to me.|`|ki7NUhU8aa	wow he shoudlnt have been F****** a broad in the first place...typical mistake|`|c68a34d6613d41a3d5423c078cd00b06aa	Pay up --look big|`|rcut6bhoaa	YES ! He pays support.  If you done the deed, now its time to pay the piper!  Makes no difference how much you make,  you will have to pay a percentage according to your local state laws.  WOW......5 all at once.  GOOD LUCK !|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Ok, hypothetical or not, why would you even need to ask if a guy would be responsible for all 5 of them?  Why wouldn't he be?  They are all his kids.  How much he would have to pay depends on the laws of that particular state.  It would be a healthy percentage though, I can tell you that.  Now, as for the point of the guy to even keep his job, if he didn't, and didn't pay support, his *** would go to jail, plain and simple.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yes he would have to pay for all five kids. How much he has to pay does depend on how much he makes. They aren't going to make him give everything he has to these kids but it is going to be hard.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	he helped her make all those kids, so he should step in and help take responsibility for ALL of them.            *edit*  well the guy should have thought about that before he knocked her up. people need to stand back and think before they have sex. now i'm sure the two realize that there was a chance she could get pregnant, but people push that way in the back of their heads and ignore it. so they both have to take responsibility. either he steps up and be a man and pay child support or better yet he can move in with her and help take care of the kids.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Of course he has to pay on all 5.   Whatever percentage the law in the state requires.  Plus meds.

He better start working harder/longer/or elsewhere.    It depends on the woman's income, the situation, your lawyer, and the state in which you reside.|`|4nKP3cWGaa	Wow. Yes, he'd have to pay for all 5 since they're ALL his children.|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	Yes your still responsible for all five. if you only make 40 k then it would be 30 k:)|`|GmTMVmASaa	uh no, he only has to pay for 2 of them.  get serious! of course you do, but marry the mother or not, you still have to support your kid's brother.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Yep, you play you pay!
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	If he doesn't already feel bad about it and he hasn't made any sincere attempts at an apology to you then there is nothing you can do to *make* him feel bad about the one night stand.  There is nothing you can do to make him feel your pain.  Your pain is your own.      All you can do is tell him how hurt and disappointed you are in him and how betrayed you feel by his selfishness and thoughtlessness.    also note that if he doesn't already feel bad on his own then he will do it again.    If it were me, I'd be glad he showed his true self so early into the marriage and see what I could do to have the marriage annulled or go ahead and divorce him.    If you stay with him then DO NOT have children with him until you are able to truly say you forgive him and you know he's been faithful for at least 5 years.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Divorce.Thats the only answer.You my dear,will never be happy.The thought of the bastard cheating on you will always be behind your head.As soon as you hear the word cheat on tv or in a store or anywhere,you will start thinking about it all over again.The anger will start to come out and you'll be miserable.He could never undo this "meant to happen'selfish moment.I dont call it a mistake,because it wasn't.If he really loved you,this wouldn't have happened.|`|L4QhCMcSaa	I think its whatever you think however you feel.  if you think you should end it then end it  if you think you shouldnt then dont!  however you feel! because everything happens  for a reason and wat ever you feel its wat  god wants.  dont listen to anybody on here they dont  know wat your going through.  listen to yourself :)|`|0be284ba9d8943c0f05e1f9205c0b6baaa	You can't make him feel bad, if he doesn't already.  Some people just don't have a conscience.    No one can tell you what to do.  Give yourself time to heal and learn to trust again.  Both of you need to go to a marriage counselor.  But if the hurt never gets better, or he cheats again, you need to consider ending the marriage.    Above all, if you don't have children already, make sure you take every precaution not to get pregnant.  DO NOT bring a child into this unstable relationship.  Children will not "fix" a broken marriage...they put a strain on even the best of relationships, so please don't take that route.|`|JOQJwcR6aa	I know how you feel i also grew up in foster care...but i would say that everyone is entitled to a mistake..he is only human..if above and beyond him cheating he is a good man i would stay...just if you feel the need to get back at him that means you didn't let it go so maybe you need some space to think things over, 2 wrongs never make a right period..just let him know that he really hurt you and that if it should happen again you'll leave him....but there are plenty of relationships that have lasted and held strong even when on spouse cheated..no ones perfect...and no relationship in this world is perfect if that's what your looking for trust me you won't find it....just look at the situation as if  it's something to make you stronger... you can get through it...Good Luck|`|EwNrlF8jaa	I know how you feel, but you can do nothing to make him feel bad. That's going to be left up to his conscience. If you believe in God (not trying to step on any toes) then you know that vengence is HIS. Your husband will "pay" for this in other ways if you leave it alone and let God take care of him and your situation. I tried to seek revenge on my own, with inflicting guilt on my ex when he cheated on me and it backfired on me. Just continue living being kind and helpful to others and let God handle the rest. Good Luck!
O57Ky6D0aa	First of all I'm really sorry your in the situation but you will have a beautiful baby soon and most people say their children are the best thing that has happened to them. I am in a bad situation myself completely different to yours but I am chronically ill and there is no cure for my illness. I am around your age will be 21 in a week or two. May it be very different I empathise with people when their going through hard times because of my own situation.    I can't believe your man won't take responsibility, it's his child that's on the way too. It's hard to know what to suggest if you didn't have a baby on the way I'd say leave but you do.     I think perhaps first you should go to counselling. Maybe then he'll realise how hard this is for you.    You shouldn't have to be in a relationship though where it's all give and no take. That's how relationships work. Do you have a good family or a network of good friends to support you?    If he won't go to councelling or the councelling doesn't make him see sense then I suggest you leave him if you can. Meaning you will have enough money and friends and family to support you.    If you accept this now this is the way it will be forever, you will always be the one cleaning up, looking after the baby, making dinner, putting the pots away and maybe even the one who has to work as well.     If he's not prepared to change and you accept this he will think he can get away with whatever.    All the best xx|`|agTCqkLDaa	Quit doing everything for him.  Move.  Get your own place.  If he doesn't follow, then he's a loser and you need to move it.    If you agreed to live with him and his parents though, then why did you expect his behavior to change?  I know you can't change the past, but you should really try and go as far back as you can and reroute it before he turns into a complete deadbeat.    Tell him that his family will only be an hour away and you promise you can meet them for dinner once a week.  (It's a quick 30 minute drive for both of you!)|`|9kKSIfX7aa	I would keep letting him mooch off you|`|um7GRVKZaa	Girl Run as fast as you can he want change get the hell out while you can.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	I would get divorced. He is not going to be a responsible father.|`|cttRd8Yqaa	get rid of him, he's a no good layabout.|`|lMR4PpATaa	Stay in school.  DO NOT GET A  JOB.  Stop telling him how to dress.  Back off as far as you can.  You are only stressing yourself out and that's not good for your baby.  Get yourself a good book, a comfortable chair and some comfortable house shoes and make yourself at home.  Eventually, he'll have to step up to the plate and be a man.  Don't try to be the man of the house.  Just be the 21 year old girl that he got pregnant.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	That's all really smart.  Dug quite a hole for yourself, swimming in your own sewer.  Only you can change that but whining won't help.|`|MqoQiLcuaa	You can't change people but you can give them a wake up call. It requires moving out, but act like your leaving him and he'll either snap Straight or your one step closer to moving on.|`|f89e7a5b56d3b4714ed4e14a2765ea08aa	I see this all the time as a church counselor.  There is no magic answer, except, of course, prayer.  Do his parents condone this?  I'm sure you've talked with them about it, but do they want to help?  I'll pray for you.    PS...I agree with one of the other answers - don't quit school.  Get your degree if at all possible.  Don't get a job - this will force his parents to do something about it.|`|xGshAiXOaa	You didn't have any inclination of any of these behaviors before you married him?  Maybe the living with his parents could have been a clue.  Now, you can either deal with it, or leave him; either way you will be on your own from the sound of it.|`|claW4UUcaa	in my opinion he doesn't want you the baby or an adult life. you seem mature for your age i'd move back home for awhile. see if your parents can help support you and your baby. finish school and once you start working move out. best of luck sweetheart.|`|kkFK74n4aa	Good lord, why did you marry this person? He clearly has no drive to succeed in life. I hate to say it, but at this point I don't have a lot of faith that you can change the way he is. It may actually be better for you in the long run if you find someone more... good, lol.|`|WLDFpm3naa	You may have to use scare tactics, such as threatening to leave, because there is not enough money, and you want your own home    Also, remind him that if he doesn't get a job, his baby will be in a lot of trouble, because there won't be enough money, and you will have to work instead, and a baby needs a mother.     And if that doesn't work, snap all his games.|`|1eggTgUMaa	You don't sound too mature either. Ditch him.|`|YNoxY6Wwaa	I know it is a useless question, but, why did you marry him? You didn't see this before?    There is nothing you can do. He has to want to change otherwise forget it. If you already told him what you want (which is NOT even remotely unreasonable) and he still doesn't get it, I believe you need to re-evaluate your marriage.    Do what is best for you and your child. Nothing else should matter.    Good luck.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Oh MY! That's not a good look at all!|`|kdgQfXSWaa	You need to leave finish school and find a real man with goals and have a happy life.

I think it's pretty straightforward. Although you are pregnant, it is clear that you (and your kid) will be better off without him unless he grows up.|`|r4fsID9Raa	Just sit down and talk to him and tell him how you feel about him doing nothing.And maybe he'll understand and do a little better.

Remain blessed|`|Ijqf0Sciaa	The vast majority of men do not change which includes yours. It does not matter how many kids you have with him. The only ones that do are the wimpy/passive ones that allow Everyone to boss them around.     The only way to change the situation is to change the man. I know that is not what you want to hear though.    You can keep nagging him about things but all that will do is push him away from you. It will drive him to get away from you, go out more alone or with his friends and possibly even have an affair. But this is not what you want to hear either.    I am very sorry about your situation but this is just the truth from a man's point of view who has witnesses a lot.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I'm sorry you didn't see the warning signs but a 32 year old man living with his parents says it all. Get out now before he drags you down to his level.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I am sorry for you.  Because he is like that at 32 years old he is NOT GOING TO CHANGE.  You need to find another guy.  I am just telling you that by the age of 32 a man is what he is.

One goes straight to the point.    Send him divorce papers. Maybe he will get the point right away.    Continue to live where you live, go to school, don't drop your classes, graduate and THEN divorce his lazy ***.    If he can't act like an adult at 32, what makes you think he is going to change.... ever?|`|vnly39dkaa	thats really bad friend..  i can understand dat how u will be managing all dis even when u r pregnent..  just stop doing anything for and just do your own thing for a while....  and make him realise your importance ..  i hope this will help..

I feel bad for his parents because now they have a no good 32 year old son to take care of, along with his 21 year old wife, and soon to be a new baby.  Wow.  Hope they're loaded.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I'd talk to his parents about this and have them give you guys a time period on when you had to get out.  And tell them to be serious about it.  They are enabling him.  So are you by letting him play video games while you type up his resumes and cover letters.  That would never fly with me.   I'd do it for my husband, but he'd be sitting right there with me doing something useful while I did it.  Not playing video games.  I don't even know the guy, but he sounds like a loser, sorry.  What guy that age stays home and plays video games instead of looking for a job?  Especially when he has a wife and a baby on the way and lives with his parents.  Most guys would be busting their butt to earn money to get out before the baby came.  You have to take a little responsibility in the situation though too because he had to be that same way three months ago when you conceived a child with him.  Why are you staying with him?  Is there no where else you could live and raise the baby?   Stress and depression is not healthy for that baby at all.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	you made a mistake.dont suffer the rest of your life for it.move out cut the cord.things will only get worse.he does not love you or respect you.not only is your life in trouble.but your child is doombed if you stay there.if you have parents crawl if you have to.tell them you are sorry.im pretty sure they do not approve of him.prove to them you will NEVER disobey them again and MEAN it.you sound like a person who knows and wants to move forward.DONT drag him along.do not believe any thing he promises you.HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM EVER AGAIN.good luck.DO IT.
QV5E70e6aa	Does your affair with a guy occurred in your marriage life or before that?  If it is during your marriage life then.  First one is confession: You have to make confession in a proper way so that your husband understand the reality behind your affair. He will forgive you if it was of genuine in nature.  Second One is give him a assurance: You have to give him full assurance that it will not re-occur again.  Third one is Change your life style towards himso that he will understand that what  you tell and what you react are in the same direction.|`|9kKSIfX7aa	do a 3some with a girl of his choice|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	Now that your husband knows the truth..you have to work on trust again.

If you felt you needed someone else, and don't want things to work out with your husband, get a divorce because you'll be wasting his time. Good luck.|`|xtcwWlUJaa	having been on your husbands side of the fence (my now ex-wife had an affair) I may be able to give you his perspective First I should tell you that my now ex wife had 3 affairs during our marriage, the first one I found out about 3 years in. I will tell you how the healing process worked for that one because the second I found out about after our divorce and the 3rd is what ended our 9 year marriage.  I found out about her affair, and she admitted it, although she never told me "the whole story". It is devastating to the male ego, and will take a very long time to get over the ego/self esteem blow that it is. but here is what I think is far more important for you to know, He may over time be able to forgive you (as i did) but he will never ever be able to forget it. never. He will always think back to what happened, he will always be able to picture your unfaithful acts in his mind, He will always wonder about where you are and who your with, And if you did this with someone you work with, he will always wonder about your behavior at work, no matter where you work.  So, basically you've given him something that he will always carry with him everywhere he goes. And he will be very quick to assume the worst every time you are late coming home, or out somewhere without him, or do anything that could be viewed as deceptive.  I got to the point where my ex wife and I could live a fairly normal life and learned to somewhat trust her again, but truly it was never the same again. The fact that she had another affair several years after the first one tells me that there is some truth to the "once a cheater always a cheater" ideaology. So you need to be aware that the first time you do something horrible seems to be the hardest time, after that it gets easier and easier. So try and remember the devastation that you have caused, before you do it next time.   Right now, you need to allow him to feel however he needs to feel, and just accept that this is a long process and wont just blow over overnight. you should be fully prepared for this to pop up in his mind for years to come, He may want to talk about it with you, or he may want to withdraw from you, either way you need to be prepared for a very bumpy ride for quite some time.   It wasnt worth it was it?.... you dont have to answer that, i already know.|`|ruycWDqIaa	some things in life cannot be repaired...if your hubby have the mind of a cheater he may forgive you.but if he is innocent and truly loves you...you dwell in hell..somethings in life we are supposed to learn as we grow.you had your times and you messed with that.lets hope he will forgive..but still you have a troubled life ahead..every time you make him angry he's gonna remember that you cheated him...hold your breath and think where you want to go with your life|`|jufY2X1jaa	if you love him why did you cheat on him????????and try to find your own answers dont depend on others compltely|`|wiiDmSopaa	talk to ur husband...u can conclude better solution...|`|f4fdc7b6741cdd033048faa9ef3e4391aa	Was your affair before or after marriage or after marriage?

I don't understand how anyone can do something and then expect to be simply taken back like that. Of course, I do see how people can make mistakes, and for your sake, I do hope that you really are remorseful about the entire ordeal. The best part about it is that you're acknowledging that you've made a mistake, and just for that, your husband should appreciate your honesty.    Second off, for an adult, your spelling and grammar are horrible. But as for your husband, just tell him that you made a mistake. It really is up to him if he forgives you or not, and I know that that can be a hard thing to accept. But taking someone back after you've been hurt like that can be a difficult thing, and you really do have to put yourself into your husband's shoes. If you show him how remorseful and despondent you are about what you've done, I really do hope that he does take you back. Consoling would be a good recommendation for the two of you to patch up some things that might have lost thread. You seem like a very nice wife who really is apologetic for what you've done, and I really do wish you the best with your husband. );|`|HunSyQaSaa	You made a mistake but the best part is you acknowledge it.

Now, if you really want to go, you better engage on of the guys only, so you will be his company, and no everybody company..you got It?.....if you do not want to engage one of the guys and still want to go, better get another bunch of girls with you.......now, if you cannot do that, and you really want to enjoy the sport part of it, you have to make it very clear to them.......and I mean it, very clear....you want to go for the sport and nothing else.........i do not even think about going wearing spandex or shorts, because the guy will think otherwise.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	do u know if they take any girls with them? i mean their g/f. looks like a guys dayout... or just ask them can i join u guys?|`|DEjb40Lwaa	Maybe it's a "Brokeback" type trip and girls just aren't invited?  LOL  KIDDING...Um, it's possible that if one or more of the guys have girlfriends, but their girlfriends don't go on the trips, it may upset them if you go...Why don't you bite the bullet and invite yourself?  Make a joke of it...Ask them if they need someone to carry the equipment because you'd really like to go with them...Good luck|`|760ccf35c3081a0b188817e21369e533aa	Guys act a certain way around guys and a certain way around the ladies.  They might be afraid that it will really cramp their style by taking you or they may not be taking you seriously.    Let me ask you, have you ever cut a loud one around them?  Did a pull my finger number on one of them?  That sort of thing is going to happen on a guys night out.  There is a lot of guy behavior you probably not privy to.  If they start looking at you as one of the guys, expect to be treated as such.|`|31Ud5YX4aa	Honey..its a guy thing...pitcure yourself going away with the girls..and then there's BOB...think about it
AA11459174	By being interesting.  Seriously though--by showing interest in her.  Make her laugh.  Make her feel good about herself.  Be considerate and respectful of her ideas.  Pay attention.     And be prepared:  always look your best, wear something nice-- and smell great.  I cannot stress that enough.|`|0b7a6457428e0a1a42fe82d56a12e3beaa	sound interesting. bring up topics that are more universal and dont sound rushed.  ask her questions about herself, a girl cant resit talking about herself, it makes her feel important.|`|c815e1de7cbc0f1c94c746889412d81eaa	If she is interested, then she will show interest. If she continues the conversation with you, then gradually hint around that maybe you should go out to lunch or dinner sometime. Don't seem to desperate, women don't like that. Also let her talk, if she doesn't talk much, then she's probably not that interested or she has someone else already. Good luck.|`|3be2d476c83dab2dcfb8467aefff23ebaa	be a lil bit busy body...  but not tooo busybody!  juz go on wif the topics..   move to  other topics gradually and try to go on with the flow.  tell something about you that's different from other guys.  but not somethin toooo weird or you'll be called a freak.  then, giv her your phone number and ask for hers.  or maybe e-mail??  you can hav a long chat in the internet later.  that would be more interesting coz u can send her photos..songs....|`|AA10093905	Ask her to have lunch with you.|`|632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	She won't show any interest unless she likes him back or she's a sociopath.  Good luck!|`|fb9fd1750c993128bc2d9c203ef7d0e8aa	fondle her bOObies|`|AA11394308	invite her to do something with yu. lunch, movies anything.|`|AA10978586	If there is interest, she will show some without you having to put much effort.  You can kind of tell after a few minutes of conversation whether or not she interested.  If you are unsure then you would just have to keep talking with her until one of two things happens: A. She will eventually give you the clue that you are looking for.  B.  Or she will cut the conversation short.
nr1G4uPyaa	I don't see anything wrong with that, besides I would feel good that he told me & if I really loved him I would want to please him anyway I could in the bedroom.  My man loves fish net stocking so I bought so thigh high & even started dancing for him. We have a lot of great sex. So I think You should loosen up & be more open minded. Remember if he doesn't get what he wants @ home he will go find it somewhere else.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	No husband but KOOL ... hope he likes fishnet ...and black lace!|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	sounds good to me|`|agTCqkLDaa	It's probably that you didn't tell her upfront.  Women like to know that their men are interested in ONLY them; there's probably a part of her that thinks you're gay.  We all have our fetishes, yes, but you need to be open with your partners from the get-go.  Tell your new gf this but maybe preface with "do you have any fetishes" and then roll with it from there.|`|GmTMVmASaa	i would probably laugh, and the ask him to model for me, so i can laugh some more. seriously tough, i wouldn't tell the next gf anything. suggest she wear them for you, but don't reveal your secret. some of us girls aren't so open minded as others, and it isn't easy for us to accept theses crazy things.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	I would laugh and then wear pantyhose everywhere I went!

Not everything you want you expect your wife to do. You on the other hand has to do things she like too. And yea once a while is ok. But never everytime you can find her in the mood. so all the best.|`|bwZPqoYhaa	Tell the new girlfriend upfront.  That way if its a problem.  Bye Bye  On to the next one.

EwNrlF8jaa	Sure that is very common now days for pets to be involved in weddings. Just have someone who knows the dog and that the dog will obey commands to "walk " the dog down the isle when its time and have treats for your dog for good behavior/promts ect. You know like on the dog competiton shows. Good Luck!|`|8kdjvWAxaa	that sounds like a good idea.|`|jkDawQVNaa	why not? i think its cute|`|v7tnfgeHaa	I don't think that would be a good idea, but it depends on the wedding. I personally think it is a bit red-neck (I can't believe Pete Wentz and Ashlee SImpson did it), and it would ruin the elegance of the event. And yes, unless it is trained to be ring bearer, it probably will go all over the place. It will be startled with all of the people there.|`|AA10524071	I think the cuteness will wear off with time. The dog won't live forever and do you really want to look at your wedding pictures and remember when Fido died.

We also had two friends walk them down, so they wouldn't wander off in other directions.  It worked well, people loved it!      Even if they act a little goofy, it makes the ceremony a lot more fun :)|`|C3552Zjbaa	no. I can't stand it when people do those types of things. I hate it.  Don't put the dog in the wedding. I wouldn't even allow my fiance to   think about something like that.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I don't like the idea.  Animals can be soo unpredictable.  (I guess we could say the same for humans though...) I just don't like it.  What would you plan to do with the dog after the ceremony?  During the reception.  If the dog is that important to ya'll, take a snap shot and both of ya'll pin it to the inside of your dress/ tux.  That way she's a part without having to worry about her well being around all those people.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Absolutely.  What a brilliant idea. Perfect. Keep the dog, get a new fiance.  You will be way ahead.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	I think it's a cute idea. If you think the dog will run in the other direction then have someone walk the dog down the aisle with a leash.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	I think that is probably the cutest idea ever.  get your dog a little outfit that looks like a suit or dress depending on the sex (you can find them at pet stores or target) and just take him to all the rehearsals. =)  it'll look soo cute and everyone will be in aw.  good-luck!

Nuestro caso era diferente, porque estamos en paises diferentes momentaneamente por motivos laborales (mios). Mir, yo he hecho viajes con l, pero al contrario de tu caso, nunca me pag nada,,,, todo era a medias (y porque yo poda, obvio), yo le criticaba eso y que tambien fuera muy apegado a la madre.... al punto de ponerla como prioridad, siendo que nosotros no nos veiamos muy seguido....  Yo tambien estoy triste, puedo decirte que "me sali el tiro por la culata", y peor , yo soy mayor que vos, y l fue el nico novio que tuve... dado como son las cosas ahora, que nadie quiere compromisos... l pareca ser diferente, pero parece que perdi todo inters en nuestra relacin, y no es porque tenga a otra, simplemente creo que me descart, sea por mis reproches, por la distancia , porque no estaba dispuesto a seguirme en mis mudanzas por causas laborales...  Un amigo me dijo que ]no debo deprimirme, y que cree que la clave es quererse a una misma ante todo..., lo nico que puedo decirte es que me dedico a trabajar, leer, ver filmes... y no voy a buscar a nadie. Supongo que una se vuelve ms dura, el corazn se enfra con cosas as... que se yo. Hoy compre un libro de una psicologa americana, Beth Miller, que se llama "La mujer vulnerable", yo lo compre traducido al Portugues porque estoy en Brasil, fijate si existe en Espa?ol, por lo poco que vi parece bueno para ayudar en estas situaciones y otras.

Claro que duele que te digan esas cosas, pero ahora sabes a qu atenerte. Me parece que en el fondo tienes muchos problemas no resueltos en la relacin y ahora ya sabes que l est buscando otra cosa. Un hombre que te quiere no te va a decir que quiere buscar su felicidad... eso quiere decir que su felicidad no est a tu lado y tu tambin tienes que sentir lo mismo, ese deseo de buscar tu felicidad. Fijate que tu misma dices que su mam es una influencia en la relacin y que adems no te conviene porque no quiere formalizar. Creo que mejor es que te ocupes de ti y dejes eso as. Valorate, quierete mucho y ocupa tu tiempo en cosas para ti, para tu felicidad, ponte linda, ocupate de tus cosas y ocupa tu tiempo para que poco a poco superes esa tristeza. Dos a?os no son poco as que es normal extra?ar a la otra persona, pero debes continuar con tu vida, no sentirte mal contigo misma y ver esto como una ocasin para explorar otros caminos hacia tu felicidad. Suerte!|`|d79e925df25485c11d874a22408911b8aa	te aconsejo que no le llames por un tiempo, lo ms seguro es que l se haya ofendido por cmo lo cortaste y est tratando de salvar su dignidad. no lo llames y ojal recapacite a tiempo y te busque pero no para lo mismo, si no para formalizar-oye a esa edad ya debera ir  por la segunda vuelta!-, si no lo hace al menos ya habrs dejado de perder tu tiempo con l.nimo!|`|35849592e6eb1fdf1a56755cfccfea94aa	preocpate por cosas que tengan verdadera importancia, una ruptura de relacin no es nada comparado con una enfermedad grave de alguno de tus familiares o la muerte (no deseo esto a nadie de tu familia, solo lo mencion a modo de ejemplo)|`|1ded9f53f7b147b602ad0a20e7d843ebaa	es una edad su madre no sera ya una influencia (en un largo tiempo) pero esto es dificil hasta para una chica que solo desea ayudar y ser ayudada solo quiero sentir que ayudo pero me pones en una situacion muy complicada que solo me deja decir sigue a tu corazon y suerte|`|8cc3a0442850e4729ea5d8a12b8f4994aa	Huuuy que mala onda, dile que lo sientes por tus actitudes si es que hay algo que sientas que hicistes mal.

Pero por el otro lado , solo te puedo decir que la entiendo , ms no que estoy de acuerdo con ella.  Cuando pasas por maltratos , eston llegan a fondo, son psicolgicos ya los golpes ni siquiera los sientes porque ya estas tan da?ada que casi nada te puede curar, pero recuerda que esta persona esta psicopata y lo unico que va a hacer es terminar mal, este tipo de gente se siente superior a nosotras pero maltratandonos, para que tengamos miedo y estemos con ellos , llegan a prohibirte todo , hasta te elejan de tu familia , de la gente que realmente te Ama., Si el volvi es mejor que lo hagas a un lado yo se que tu sientes que lo sigues amando pero es mentira , si hay un sentimiento porque es dificil olvidar tan pronto, de hecho jams lo vas a olvidar pero si trata de vivir tranquila, sin temor, que vivas aunque se que a veces sientes que no eres nada, que nadie te quiere, yo se lo que se siente, viv con una persona as, solo que el si me dej marcada para siempre, porque el se ahorc en el ba?o de mi casa en una ocasin que discutimos y de ah para ac vivo con miedo, si salgo con alguien, pero cuando no estoy con el aunque se que me ama y todo el tiempo me habla y me busca, no puedo evitar la soledad y el miedo, el recordar sus amenazas y sus golpes, porque eso es lo que lo hacia sentirse alguien.  Y si puedo decir que lo quiero , que lo ame, pero tambin creo que fue lo mejor, porque el solo pens en el, termin con su vida pero con la mia tambin porque yo sigo aqui, enfrentando todo lo que venga.  Un consejo, deja a esta persona, espero que no termine as pero si cuidate mucho, esta vez se fue el solo, me salve, gracias a Dios no pens en mi, aunque siempre me decia: primero te mato, antes que verte con otro, si no eres ma , no vas a ser de nadie.  Dime si no es lo mismo que el te ha dicho.  Y recuerda , las personas no cambian, 1 persona de un milln puede cambiar, pero es muy dificil.  Cuidate y no le gahas caso. Recuerda que solo es temor, no lo amas. y si creo que necesitas a alguien que te traiga en corto porque te acostumbraste a el , pero no que te golpeen, solo que te pongan atencin, eso es lo que necesitamos.

Nunca he creido que los suicidas sean unos cobardes como dijo otro aqu, lo que creo es que son personas acorraladas y solo encontraron esa puerta para escapar.    ?Matarte para acabar con todo lo que tienes dentro? Tal vez funcionara pero creo que te veras mal de color morado, o toda retorcida y hecha bola por el dolor estomacal, o sin un pedazo de cara por un tiro, o toda plida por vaciarte de sangre, nop, yo creo que no te veras bien, y adems, imagnate a la bola de morbosos viendo si abren la caja para verte y hablando de tu familia pestes. ?Sera un buen recuerdo? No lo creo.    Si te sientes dependiente ?por qu no te sales de tu casa con tus cosas y buscas cmo y de qu vivir? Te aseguro que aunque sea de sirvienta (persona que hace el aseo en una casa ajena) te contratan, o si no quieres porque pagan poco pues ntrale al "negocio fcil" algo de ms riesgo pero mejor pagado. Lo importante es salirte de tu casa para probarte que eres alguien de valor, alguien que ser escuchada ?Por qu no te sales? ?eh? ?Acaso tienes miedo?     En el mundo 23 a?os es mayora de edad para hacer lo que se quiera, as que no veo la razn de no irte de ah. Que vas a batallar, es cierto, ?y qu? Pero vas a ganar libertad, adems con ella podrs terminar tus proyectos y no dejar nada a la mitad. LLvate tus documentos de identificacin y si quieres, djale una carta a tus padres dicendoles que vas vivir tu vida y que despus te comunicas con ellos por correo (normal no electrnico).    Por ltimo, no vayas al mdico (siclogo, socilogo, siquiatra, sacerdote, y otros etc.) mejor reflexiona sobre lo que ests viviendo y por qu, pues tal vez no ves que tu as lo quieres y los dems te estn dando gusto.|`|BVsjykn0aa	bueno ?la verda todo depende del motivo de tu depresion y lo mejor es pedir ayuda al psiclogo o en su defecto al psiquiatra,, solo aslo,,, saludos|`|FsE7tajjaa	meses llevas asi; no tiene sentido tu vida; casa, matrimonio,titulo, dependiente, sii, un caso mas, para nada soy medico o sicologo, pero en mi vida e he topado con chicas con problemas, una de ellas mi gran amiga,tanto la ayude que casi no la veo, de tan ocupada que esta, y pasaba por depresiones, muy fuertes, se sentia tan mal, si consejos de animate, internate, sesiones con el sico... y demas tonterias, lo unico que se necesita es dar el paso para salir de lo que te afecta, soltera eres, joven, bueno tambien crees en alguien aunque a medias, mmm es bueno que tengas alguien en quien creer,pero no es todo, sal de ahi, alejate de lo que te hace da?o, total ,no sera facil, estas acostumbrada a que los demas hagan las cosas por ti, y tu en tu paso tengas muchos postes. hoyos, barrancos, sal de ese camino, puede que te pierdas, pero no sera en tu misma situacin, ten el valor....

Estamos para ayudarte. Cada vez q quieras comentar algo, conta con las personas q formamos la comunidad de Yahoo Respuestas.    En primer lugar, creo q tu vida vale mucho. Creo q vos misma pensas q vales mucho, por eso estas buscando respuestas de aliento.  Tomate las cosas con calma, sos joven y an tenes tiempo para lograr lo q anhelas.     Muchas personas viven situaciones parecidas a la tuya, es algo normal hoy en da. No todos tienen casa, no todos tienen marido, no todos tienen ttulos y muchos somos dependientes.  Yo creo q en lugar de deprimirte tendras q canalizar todas esas fuerzas en lograr algo positivo para vos. Algo que te haga feliz. Podras comenzar buscando un trabajo.   De esa forma, dejaras de ser dependiente y modificaras muchos de tus hbitos.   El poder comunicar lo q sentis, creo q es un avance importante. No todos tienen las agallas q tenes vos, como para contar lo q les pasa.   Trata de distraerte, asi dejas de pensar en lo negativo. Yo cuando me siento mal, miro peliculas q tengan finales felices. Me emocionan y me transmiten alegria.  La muerte es un escape. Intenta enfrentar cada una de tus frustraciones. No te quedes meditando sobre: porq me pasa esto? o quien tiene la culpa?   Trata de encontrar las soluciones.  Si te preocupa no haber estudiado, HOY es el dia para comenzar a estudiar.  Si te preocupa no tener marido, AHORA es el momento para buscar novio.  Si te preocupa no tener casa, HOY es el da para buscar trabajo y ahorrar.  Si te molesta q te manejen, AHORA es el momento para comenzar a tomar tus propias decisiones.  Estar a mitad de camino, es codiciado por quienes an no han inicido el viaje.  Mira lo positivo de lo q lograste.   Igual, sera bueno q consultes a un especialista, el te va a guiar.  Un gran abrazo!!!!!!!!!|`|448ef866da65201ca084514d9428ab95aa	Tengo 28 y te digo que si vale la pena vivir, te haz olvidado de algo: de ti, mujer no dejes de vivir, eres humana y tienes derecho a equivocarte y aunque el mundo te d la espalda, an te tienes y eso es lo ms importante.|`|xJ7q0Rkxaa	internarte? donde?    sabes, curiosamente creo que las dos pasamos por una situacion similar... yo nunca he pensado en suicidarme, pero creo que compartimos ciertos sentimientos.    que te podria recomendar... que vayas al psicologo. no es broma, no te estoy diciendo que estas loca... simplemente creo que te ayudaria; espero me hagas caso, sin embargo es tu desicion|`|KYeZ0sCeaa	yo a beses me siento igual, parece que la vida te la manipula alguien mas que tenes ganas de viajar y no podes ,queres tener algo nuevo y no podes, yo no creo en el destino pero siento que alguien me manejara. quiero creer que mi vida la manejo yo pero no se
cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	This is soooo sweet!  If you are into country, "My Valentine" by Martina McBride is a beautiful song.  A personal favorite of mine is "The Look of Love" by Diana Krall (I have it as a song ring tone!), if you're into jazz.  Feeling a little 80's retro?  "Time After Time" by Cindy Lauper is good.  Feeling really retro? "Unforgettable" by Nat "King" Cole (or a really heartfelt cover done by Cole and his daughter Natalie Cole.  I will admit, you are really raising the romantic bar! :)  If you're into religious, "I Can Only Imagine" (a lot of artists have covered this) is a good pick.  These are only a few suggestions, but I hope you have a great Valentine's Day, as well as a great rest of your life with a good man.

be420c41071c75ca538195887ed6c664aa	La mayora de las personas usan mascaras delante de los dems; no mostrandose realmente como son y como piensan en su interior, si no, mostrandose como conviene para ganarse la aprobacin de los que los rodean y as tener menos dificultades u oposicin en su vida. Por lo menos, eso buscan.    Mucho mejor, es mostrarse como uno s y piensa. No ser hipocrita. Pero en vez dejarte arrastrar por tus malos deseos y por tu inclinacin al mal (que lo hay en cada ser humano) es mejor tratar de vivir una vida recta internamente. Que lo interno coincida con lo externo.    Cristo habl que delante de Dios, no importa que no hagas lo malo, solo en lo que la gente puede ver; si no, que para Dios lo importante es que no desees el mal en tu corazn. El dijo:    "Osteis que fue dicho: "No cometers adulterio". Pero yo os digo que cualquiera que mira a una mujer para codiciarla, ya adulter con ella en su corazn."   Mateo 5:27-28    Este tipo de vida solo es posible si aceptas a Cristo como tu Se?or y Salvador; pues solo l es capaz de transformarte internamente para que seas como Dios quiere que seas, amando lo bueno y aborreciendo lo malo y que externamente seas luz entre las personas.     En Mateo 23; Cristo critica fuertemente a los hipcritas religiosos. Que ticamente se trataban de mostrarse bien ante los dems, puero Dios saba que su interior no coincida con lo exterior.

2QpCk8V8aa	That sounds like a scary situation to be in. The best thing to do is get the police involved especially if your mom is an alcoholic, and definitely if your dad beats her, it's not a safe environment to be in. I don't know if it's a good idea just to go and move in with your boyfriend, there will be lots of legal issues involved with that, but also you need to consider your little brother because he is at risk too, it's not realistic to ask if he can move to your boyfriends too, so maybe you have an auntie or uncle you can talk to about it? or your grandma/grandad even.

But yours is another story,firstly don't feel terrible you are not the only one with these issues in one way or another,my dad is the drunk but my mum has never said or done anything regards it for his her our and the family sake,i think what others have said is right you need to talk to someone just even for the sake of talking it through with someone,but someone oficial ,can you ask at school,or if not sure who to go to and you don't want it to be heard by the wrong people ask your boyfriends parents as they are grown adults to help you out,not only if something can be done for your family eg and your brother,but also to help you out and to get advice/poss councilling to help with this,as unfortunatly not down to whether you've tried or not,you can not change other peoples ways or problems that you care about and are affecting your life and life for all of you as a family,you can only help yourself from it sometimes. Also can you try ans speak to your dad about this is your mum is maybe out of reach,about whats going on and how your worried for your brother,and also yes get yourself organised and stay at your boyfriends at least they are there for you as adults and can offer you some stabilty as you must also be at school i assume,and you need to think about your studies.

I think you should live with your boyfriend, your brother will be perfectly fine, even if they have to take him away, its for his own good. and at this point in time you need to put yourself first, do what is best for you, it's your life, and if they can't help make it good, then make it good yourself. ?|`|rCpU4xkBaa	It sounds like you have a lot of problems going on and maybe you should talk to someone of a status about this, because whatever you do from here it is a big decision to make.

You have a lot on your emotional plate, and I am so sorry that you are dealing with this situation.  If you feel that your husband is supportive, you need to sit down with him and have a heart to heart talk.  If you feel that he is not supportive, you need to seek outside help.  Most cities have counseling services that you can access for a sliding financial scale; look into them.  As for your daughter, it is time to sit down with your child and husband and face some hard decisions.  What is your family feelings about keeping the child or your daughter having an abortion?  What will the father of the child do to help this situation?  Is there a support system in place, regardless of whether she keeps the child, gives it up for adoption, or terminates the pregnancy?  If your husband has a hissy fit, let him know that you are not the first family to deal with this, nor the last (remember Sarah Palin?).  You may also need to get marital counseling; there will be some residual hurt feelings that you didn't tell him that his daughter is sexually active.  Take this time to take a deep breath and realize that you have a lot to deal with; get some help.  Take care and God bless.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	I think you need to see a therapist.

nMR5TfGAaa	Someone very close to me was with a promoter, his clients were high visibility DJ's and very famous in the club circuit.  In order for him to be successful, he had to go out every weekend sometimes weekdays, usually all night - making sure he schmoozed with all the right people (not always good people)- this meant drugs at times and staying for after hours.  Then there's the hotel parties which last all day.  This was his successful career.  The coolest parties at the hottest clubs, hangovers, entourages, hook ups, drugs, and a mountain of debt trying to maintain this image.  Unfortunately there are no longer together, but I am glad for my friend as she is better off.    The nature of the business is not family friendly (unless he's going to do top 40 at weddings and events), and one has to be very grounded to make it work.  There are people who are sober in the business, who have families, and make it work.  There are lots of them.  But one must work against the grain to do so.      If he isn't putting his family first, and says that he won't be tied down, then you have much work to do with him, if your goal is to keep the marriage together.  I sincerely hope you do, for the sake of your family.  All the best to you.|`|XMIjisNAaa	STOP BEING A ******* *****!|`|2xBfTvueaa	*sniff* this is a very sad story but  I really don't know what to do...My parents do the same thing ( i am eleven years old) and if you have any advice for me then plz email me at roaroftime@gmail.com..|`|SAgkmyqYaa	Sounds like your husband wants to be a single bachelor partying and living the club lifestyle, if this is the case you can't do much about it except for put your foot down and deal with the consequences if he doesn't listen or just deal with it and be miserable.

If you're jealous and don't like him being at clubs where there are a lot of ho's, then maybe you shouldn't be with him because if you don't trust him out there doing that then there's no point in being in a relationship with him.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	It honestly doesn't sound like your husband wants to live a normal married life and he certainly doesn't treat you as a cherished wife. No one should ever "stay together for the kids." Kids whose parents are verbally (or worse) abusive to each other, grow up with worse problems than parents who divorced. It is also showing your son that he can treat women the way his dad does and they will just take it.    My ex-husband acted the same way yours does. Finally I removed all emotion from our marriage and learned indifference, it was then that I was able to leave and my daughter is happier than she ever has been. She and her step father are best friends and she loves her step mom, too. My husband is a completely different person with his new wife and I am glad - between both of our new marriages, my daughter will see how she should expect to be treated.|`|VArXPOMPaa	From what you say, he has been verbally abusive from the beginning. The fact that he is finally "making it" has not changed him for either the worst or the better.   You know it is so easy for an outsider to say "leave him, you don't deserve that treatment" but to actually do that is something different. In all honesty you know what you need to do for you. If you want to stay in a relationship where you are not happy, feel sad all the time, and feel that you are the only one putting and effort into your loveless marriage then that is what you do. No one can decided for another what to do in that person situation.   I think that you will eventually get tired of it to the point that you will either leave him and move on or you will stay with him and move on with your own life doing what you need to do to care of yourself. Maybe if you stopped focusing on him and focused on your self and while staying in the relationship did for you with no explanation to him about what or why, you will see things change. The change may be in only on yourself but yet it is a change.  Something that I have to remember after 10 years with the same man is before we got together it was just me. I am my own person, with my own thoughts, and my own feelings and views. I am me. The same thing for him. I may not agree with things that he says or does but they are his thoughts and actions. I accept him for who and what he is and does, and I let him be who he is. They say that if you want to change someone into what you you want them to be, then you don't really love them. You love the idea of what you think they should be.|`|I7qHLCQqaa	If that's his occupation, it sounds like promoting events at clubs is unavoidable. I dont think your going to dissuade him from that as its inclusive to the job description, but you may be able to get him to just do it less often.   Ask him to stay home more often if he can. It sounds like you tried to do that already, but give it another shot in a very sincere context. UUnfortunately it sounds like you gave that a shot as well.   If he is that passionate about his work, and I dont blame the man bbecauseI will probably be the same way, I dont think things are going to change.   If things changed at work, say, he was dissatisfied or business was slow or bad, that may be grounds for him not to.    Overall, its been years and many attempts from dynamic angles have been worked, it sounds like him doing things at work or being seriously involved in it is not going to change.     You know what you do have control over though? Your own choices. Involve something new in your own life that is compelling--this will certainly be something worth trying and it will compromise his perspective that his work is the only work on the planet.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	I would highly recommend some outside counseling for the both of you.............but if he won't agree then you go yourself and have a counselor help figure things out with you.

Stop crying for yourself and be an adult.|`|t81MEJ82aa	From what I know prednisone is that moodiness and depression can be a side affect. I had a family member on it once, but depression wasn't one of his side affects but it can affect people in a variety of ways. If you feel there is some wrong with your medication then talk to your doctor, do not self diagnose.    Are you actually depressed or simply feeling down? For a period after 9/ll, I went 9 months without a full time job so I know from personal experience that the job hunting process can take its toll. Have you considered temp agencies? They can at least help with getting a part-time decent paying gig, I got a 4 month assignment during that period and it helped a lot. You have to do your best to occupy your time, find a new hobby, expand on an interest, dedicate a certain amount of time per day looking for a job, workout more.|`|IcH5gMICaa	I'm sure you don't need to resort to anti-depressants just yet.  ANd I can tell you, they're not all they are cracked up to be.  I wish I could STOP taking them.    And I wish I could dump my boyfriend on your hands everyday.  Trust me, be GLAD you have someone who isn't completely helpless all the time and that your kids are old enough to be in school.  If I had your time, I'd start my OWN business or get into a field that is booming.  You probably could go to school, too.  I wish I had your time!  My house would be spotless and I probably wouldn't be in the shape I'm in mentally if I had some time once in awhile.  Think about it, the economy is pretty bad and jobs are dwindling down. There may not be anything out there for a while.  THink of something you've always wanted to do and you always said "one day when I have the time".  Well, now you have it.    Even if there is JUST nothing -substitute teach.  The money isn't that good but it's kinda rewarding and stressful so you feel like you've had a day.  Go put energy into something and you will feel better.  I say avoid the antidepressants unless it gets really bad where you are crying all the time.  That's how I knew i had to go to the doc.  But it's a LOT of money for those, as well as therapy etc.  YOu might ask your doc for a 2 month RX of Xanax to relieve your stress anxiety.  Those are cheap and really helpful if you don't become dependent on them.
8ee2cf31c7435be22832e02a0e8348d7aa	It doesn't matter how they dress as long as there nice|`|AA11459174	Depends on the occasion.  The layered look can be quite attractive--it's quite cuddly, like a flannel shirt over a henley.  Keeps us wondering what's under there.  One of the reasons I love cold weather.    When you show up for a first date, always wear a blazer, even if you don't wear a tie.  Tee shirts and jeans show no imagination.  Tee shirts are just colored underwear.  Button-down shirts are nice, with the undershirt peeking out and a nice soft cozy sweater pulled over.  Tucking is optional.  Dress shoes or boots are better than sneakers, even with jeans (as a vegetarian, I would encourage you to find alternatives to leather, however).  If it's a dressy event, then dress up, and wear a tie, it shows respect.     I don't know that I can recommend specifically for a blond (no "e," since you're male), but you could try colors that match whatever colors are in your eyes.  There should be flecks of a few different shades in there, I imagine.  Tall men wear can wear many different styles of clothes very well, so take advantage, but remember, it's very important to wear clothes that really fit well.  See James Bond in his tailored dinner jacket.  Swoon!|`|1a201cbca4222ab6f7ad61c7735dc437aa	A haircut?    I'm only kidding.      But hey... even though I'm not a girl, I thought it a good idea to mention to remind you that we guys are notoriously thought of as bad dressers.  Dress too perfectly, and they might assume you're gay.    Okay, so that's in jest too....  but SERIOUSLY....    don't dress in a fashion that you think others want you to dress in.  Women are like us in that their tastes vary greatly, and no matter what you wear, some will like, some will dislike.    If you find compatibility to be of any importance, dress honestly in a way that you like.  Dress in a nature that suits YOU and your lifestyle.  That way you'll have the correct women liking your clothes, and more importantly, you'll have the correct women DISLIKING your clothing.  And all will be good.    Whatever you decide on, avoid bowties with jeans.    Jack|`|0b7a6457428e0a1a42fe82d56a12e3beaa	i believe a guys personality is portrayed in his clothing.  as long as your outer wear fits your personality go for it. a girl will go for a guy they think has style like her, meaning they have things in common.  if what you are wearing does not fit who u r on the inside then dont wear it.  that doesnt mean dont dress up or anything, fit the occasion as well

Tradicionalmente se han clasificado en la familia Pongidae (pngidos). Actualmente se clasifican como Hominidae (homnidos). Junto con los gibones y los humanos pertenecen a la superfamilia Hominoidea.    La taxonoma de este grupo fue revisada porque, tanto por hallazgos fsiles como por la gentica molecular, qued establecido que los Pongidae formaban un grupo parafiltico que no inclua a sus descendientes (los humanos). Algunos "pngidos", como el chimpanc, estaban ms emparentados con el hombre que con otros pngidos. Siguiendo las normas de la taxonoma filogentica, cualquier taxn en el que estuvieran los grandes simios debera incluir al hombre y a sus antepasados bpedos extintos, de modo que se opt por redefinir la familia Hominidae y englobarlos a todos.    Se ha calculado que la lnea evolutiva de los orangutanes se separ hace ms de 11 millones de a?os, en tanto que la de los gorilas hace cerca de 7 millones de a?os, mientras que los antepasados de los chimpancs y los humanos divergieron hace apenas 5  6 millones de a?os.
S8CZBCe2aa	Honey I am so sorry you are going through this.  You should never be caught in the middle of adults fighting.  Call your Dad or your brother.  Tell them what happened.  Your Mom needs to make some changes in her life but she will not make those changes until she is ready (its not about money).  You do not have to suffer like this someone needs to put your needs first.  Remember this was never your fault, but well done for trying to make the situation a little better.  Call someone please! This is one Mom sending you a big hug!|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Sweetheart, this is a very ugly situation, it's not normal, and it's not your fault.  Most adults don't act like this. Your mom and step dad sound like they hate each other.  Tell your mom and step dad how frightened and insecure their behavior makes you feel.  You need to talk to an adult in the family who can help you-your dad? Your brother? Can you go stay with one of them, or at a friends? If your mom and step dad get crazy again, call the police.  It's a huge burden for you, I know, but the situation sounds dangerous.  I care about you, hunny, and I want you to be ok more than anything else.  Please talk to your family.|`|xBd96wvRaa	You should have called the police.   But you did nothing wrong.    Call them every time you genuinely feel concerned for your Mother's safety.     And maybe - not your problem if it doesn't  - but police involvement may open your Mother's eyes to how bad the situation truly is. Your Mother is probably telling herself it isn't that bad.   When the police arrive it will be pretty hard for her to keep lying to herself.    Don't waste your time trying to comfort your mother, shame on HER. She is not the victim here YOU are!    She is choosing to be a victim.     She is exposing you to a horribly abusive situation one that is traumatizing you.     Try to find another family member to live with -one that can provide a proper environment to raise a child.   Even a foster home will be better.    Don't give this anymore thought other then what is best for you.|`|AA11401294	call your dad|`|D3hYbsVJaa	I would scream every freaking time If I were you. This Steve character needs to grow up.

That, however, is up to him.    The silver lining that I hope you see is that as a young lady you NEVER accept a man treating you this way.

I am so sorry you have to be dealing with this.  there is no reason they should be married anymore. They should at least be going to counseling, but their relationship is seriously flawed.    Next time it happens, call the police.  The situation is becoming unstable and i can understand your fear.      I hope things get better for you. Can you move in with your dad?  I knw 13 is old enough to make those decisions, would that be an option?  or maybe a friend would be willing to let you live there.    I dont know, this just sounds terrible.  I hope I helped.|`|cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	I am sooo sorry that you are dealing with this.  Sometimes adults can be more childish than children, and you are dealing with this situation. In many schools, there are counselors and teachers that you can talk to about this situation.  You are too young to be the grown-up in this situation, and it's time that the adults realize this.  Your mother and stepfather need an adult (not you) to sit down with them.  Even if they don't, you need to talk to someone to deal with this.  Most importantly, please know that THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.  I don't know what your relationship with your father is, but if you have a decent one, see if you can stay with him for a bit and sort things out.  Know that you are smarter and stronger than this situation, and that you are not alone.  Take care and God bless.|`|VZN3rT9Waa	Talk to your Dad about it.  Your mom needs an adult to talk to her about it.  She probably realizes you're trying to help, but ignores you because you're "only a kid". Parents are like that.|`|dB9fE7gnaa	My parents are divorced too, I just tried to ride it out in my room when my mom started yelling at my step dad, but if you can do something to make them stop fighting do it, and always be ready to call the police or something if anything really bad happens. I had to call the police on my step dad before when he hit my mom.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	I would consult your father (your biological father, not this Steve guy). He may want to step in and have you stay with him for awhile. Steve definitely needs counseling for his anger, and your mother could use some counseling as well.    The I get paid occasionally won't cut it. You mother could get assistance from other sources so she could still get the bills paid on time.    She need to get out of that relationship for her own safety.|`|ZGReKpK6aa	Youre only young. If you feel afraid or unsafe then you should tell someone. Your mother has heard your concerns but right now she is trying to sort her own head out and i dont think she will confide in you. You are her child and Steve is her husband. Tell your dad. Or a relative or an adult you know you can trust. You need to be in a stable and secure environment. Their fights are not your fault. Dont be scared. Pray for strength. It probably sounds worse than it is from your end. If your mum was really afraid for her life she would have left long ago. Go to your dad or your brother. Im sure it will all be ok. God bless.|`|xSjI44VZaa	For one, you should never ever blame yourself for adult problems. Every young kid does that in a situation such as this and honestly it really is gonna hurt you more because you take so much blame. So, don't blame yourself.   Now, on to the next thing... It was definitely the right thing to do to make sure your mom was ok, even though you went about it wrong. Next time don't run in screaming because if he was going to hit her then he wouldn't think twice about doing it to you, so if you think it's getting way out of control kinda spy on them and if there is a problem then CALL THE COPS!   Also, you did the right thing trying to comfort your mom. Right now she is embarrassed and sad and scared so as an adult she's going to push you away because she doesn't want you to see her like that. If it were me in your position I would force my mom to let me comfort her but that really takes a knowing of how your mom is, meaning- will she finally give in or will it cause an argument.   Lastly, you should really talk to a guidance counselor, teacher, or other trusted adult at school or a friend's parent. The fights could be dangerous and someone needs to know what's going on.     Please though, try to stay as far away from the fights as much as possible. I never want to see a 13 year old get caught up in an adult fight and get hurt.|`|cUpNNn4Saa	Hello, 13 I had the same thing growing up till 9yrs of age and mom had enough. Thank goodness.

As for you , respect the fact that you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge a place that is safe from the out side world that you can call home and a place to grow. As for your adults in the house.. Well, put it in writing that you don't like the fighting and that it disrupts you alot. And ask them to seek counseling .

DON"T GIVE A **** CAUSE YOU CAN THREATEN BY CALLING THE POLICE ON HIM! and if he DOES leave the government will always send your mom money! I'm 13 as well.! :)

Ignoring red flags is how you wind up w/ jerks, creeps, abusers, users, losers, and dangerous men.  You WANT to pay attention to the red flags.  That is what keeps you safe and sane.    two months and he's already behaving like a pig?  Dump his butt.  It doesn't matter if he's seeing someone else, that's the least of your worries.  He's a drunk, he calls you names, he lies to you,  and disrespects you.  and YOU'RE worried he's cheating?    great relationships do not tank in 2 months time.  Great guys do not turn into ogres in 2 months time.  this is not a great relationship and this is not a great guy.  Be grateful he's showing his true colors so soon.  now you don't have to become so emotionally entangled with him that you do something stupid like, marry him or reproduce w/ him.    I don't know if this guy is a violent man but he's sucked you in just like a classic abuser.  Charms the pants off you--probably literally, wines, dines, and impresses you/sweeps you off your feet and then shows little bits of his true self until you're saying something like "I tried to ignore the red flags" because he's such a "great guy" and "we have such good chemistry"(no, you don't.  He's seduced you, but you don't have anything real with him).      I'm not trying to sound mean or disrespectful but I'm seriously concerned and worried about you that you would want to save a short term relationship with a loser.  And you KNOW he's a loser.  WHY do you want a loser?  Don't you think you deserve a good man?  Are you so afraid to be on your own or are you so unhappy with your own company that you will settle (yes, settle) for this loser?  Is your life so boring and unfulfilling that you need to introduce unnecessary drama into it for a little excitement?    houses should be fix 'er up projects.  your partners are NOT.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	oh yeah..you are being played..|`|t81MEJ82aa	Does it matter if he's cheating on you?

It would probably be in your best interest to leave him alone.  There is an old saying that rings true: "If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and lays eggs, get the orange sauce ready!"  If he is lying to you, as well as abusive language, you are worth more than this man.  Take a deep breath, tell him goodbye, and live the life that you were blessed to have.  Take care and God bless.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	lol...lol... it does matter ...he should not do this .  Get rid of the wine cause he likes his BEER .  Men do say things they mean when they are drunk . Yes  n like I would say that that is a possibility and when he loves you he will tell you ,.  Your man should not nor would not cheat if he were ALL too HONEST with you ...

2OBP8fqJaa	Wheter he is cheating or not, he is being passive aggressive and abusive, not a good sign for a fulfilling relationship to begin with. Yes, he does sound like a lieing cheating snake. If you want to know if he loves you for real?...stop having sex with him and see how long he stays.     If you feel there is hope and you want to save this...relationship...give him space and see if he responds. That means, be away from him completely.

Even without rumors of another girl, the obvious mental abuse you're being set up for is enough of a red flag...go now before you invest any more time in this. Take it from someone who's been there. You're wasting your time trying to hang onto this looser, and it will only hurt more if you the longer you wait. This kind of stuff gets a lot worse over time...never better. You can't change narcissistic attitudes, they just treat you with less respect as time goes on. Never ignore the red flags.|`|zTQVC7GBaa	Yes he is cheating.Leave him alone and find someone else|`|mGKQY6OPaa	Yes..you can tell because u heard of that incident with him with the other girl...he doesnt like u and he lied about everything about loving u and stuff...sorry but **** that asshole

Gracias a Dios ya los recupere hace como 1 a?o y ahora estoy sola, o sea que no vivo con ningun hombre.  Pero me di cuenta que mi mejor amigo, el unico amigo que tengo que siempre estuvo alli para apoyarme, ayudarme y nunca me abandono ni en mis peores momentos, es el que me ha dado el amor que tanto habia buscado.  Aunque solo nos vemos los fines de semana ya que el vive como a 1 hora de mi casa, esos ratitos son los mejores de mivida, me comprende, me demuestra tanto amor, se preocupa por mi, me hace sentir como la mujer mas bella del mundo y hacer el amor con el ha sido maravilloso, y el vive en su casa y yo en la mia (ah, no es casado, vive con sus padres y su hija)  Moraleja:  el amor muchas veces esta mas cerca de lo que te imaginas, a veces lo pasamos por alto buscando lo que no nos conviene.

Por otra parte y no menos importante EL AMOR NO SE BUSCA acuerdate del dicho "matrimonio y mortaja del cielo baja", deja de preocuparte por encontrar que te llegara cuando menos lo esperes y en la persona que quiza nunca imaginaste.    Ojala que no seas de esas que lo piden a la perfeccion por que eso no existe en nadie, hay que luchar por lo que queremos como tu dices s, pero no para crear una relacion en la que afuerza quieras solo alegrias, sino luchar para salir de los momentos desagradables tomados de la mano de nuestra pareja  y luchar para disfrutar de los agradables al maximo teniendo plena conciencia de que no son eternos ni los malos ni los buenos.    Asi que solo puedo terminar sugiriendote que no busques espera, y mientras tanto preparate tratando de ser una persona mejor cada dia, veras que al final la espera valdra la pena.

Claro que el amor duele, recuerda que en la biblia tambin dice "el amor es sufrido..... todo lo sufre, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta"1 cor. 13.  Lo que sucede es que Dios nos ense?a muchas cosas antes que conozcamos a la persona que l nos tiene preparada, para que cuando eso pase sepamos valorarla y sepamos actuar bien ante cada situacin. Aunque es dificil para todos, porq siempre queremos a alguien a nuestro lado, el amor siempre estar en nuestros corazones pero debe ser el correcto para poderlo dar a otras personas.  Todo tiene su tiempo.  Pdele a Dios por esa persona que l tambin estar pidiendole por ti a Dios.  Adems piensa que los dos se estn preparando para cuando llegue  ese momento tan especial en que se encuentren y no se separen jams.  Para mi tambin ha sido muy dificil as que s de lo que te estoy hablando.  Y por ltimo primero debes sentir el amor de Dios que es la fuente de toda clase de amor, l te ama mucho y no quieres que sufras slo que esperes y confes en l.  ahhhh..... y recuerda que el oro debe ser probado en el fuego para saber su valor.!

Y si te va a tocar,  !!! como lo mas lindo de la vida no te va a suceder !!!, uno se tiene que ir al otro lado habiendo probado todo lo bello que la vida te pone en el camino. Si te tropezaste con una piedra y esta te tumbo, apartala, y vuelve a levantarte, sin mirar atras. El amor es maravilloso, son innumerables las locuras que te hace hacer por el ser que adoras, a veces como es normal estan las discusiones, pero que eso no te frene, aprende de ellas para que no te vuelvas a equivocar. Te escribire un poema que es peque?o, y espero que te des cuenta que la persona que ama, en muchos casos aunque lo amen tambien sufre:   DICEN QUE EMPEZAR AMAR ES EMPEZAR A SUFRIR  LO LLEGUE A EXPERIMENTAR Y ES MUY FACIL DE DECIR, PARA AMAR HAY QUE SUFRIR Y ACEPTAR TODO CON CALMA, SI AQUEL QUE AMA NO SUFRE NO SABE AMAR CON EL ALMA.

TtUIZ1Tdaa	Wola =)    Hay algo que tienes que tener en cuenta y es que en el amor no hay edad! Pero de verdad sentiras amor por ella? O es solo atraccion?    La situacion seria la siguiente, si de verdad quieres tener algo con ella tienes que saber que una relacion se lleva por 2 personas, y sus padres tambien podrian involucrarse por lo tanto seria muy diferente a tener un noviazgo con una chica de tu edad.    Podrian llevar una muy buena relacion juntos, pero tendrias que respetar sus derechos, y sobre todo abstenerte a tener relaciones sexuales sin anter haberlo consultado con sus padres.    Si de verdad hay amor eso no importara pues podrias esperar a tener muchos a?os de noviazgo hasta que sean mayores de edad y experimentar otras cosas ^^ pero corres el riesgo de hacerla sufrir emocionalmente... A tu edad es posible que llegues a "aburrirte" de un noviazgo con una chica menor que tu por esa razon deberias analizar bien la situacion, talvez tu no pierdas nada pero ella podria perder mucho...

Si decides besarla pues dale un beso de una forma diferente, citala en algn lugar bonito un parque por ejemplo, llevale una rosa o un chocolate, tomala de la mano y dile lo que sientes mirandola a los ojos, luego le das un beso enorme pero suave sin apretarla para que no se sienta presionada y luego la abrzas. Lo demas vendra, a esta edad es facil que suceda todo pero si la respetas y le das su tiempo nada se planea todo sucede, demuestrale que puede confiar en ti.

aDL7xmt6aa	You don't.|`|	just stay out of it.and let your dad find out on his own.that does not mean you can't tell your mother you know about it.|`|	Maybe you should confront your mom and tell her what you told us. Don't accuse her just ask her. Say something like:    "Mom, I'm really worried about you. I think you may be doing something that will affect our family and I am scared."    She maybe going through a hard time and just needs someone to talk too, but she may not know how that is affecting you. You need to talk to her not your dad. If you say something to your dad you maybe wrong and start a lot of crap that could be avoided. Talk to her. You have a legitimate concern and I am sure that if she is having an affair then she may think twice about what she will be losing if she continues. Good Luck!|`|	Tell your dad that your mother has been acting weird towards you but I would try to gather some more evidence before telling on her    Or ask your mom why is she acting so funny towards you...

I understand the heartache, feelings of loneliness and desperation but when you are with him, just have fun and don't think of the relationship, how he feels about you, or the possible outcome. Be the best date he ever had. No high drama. Time will tell. Hope this helps. Good luck. And in the meantime, go out with other guys and enjoy those times too.|`|cb68f95e0458cb403438318e61ff3196aa	As above, he did not make you fall in love. you`ve merely allowed your own emotions to connect with your desires. which as you`ve now discovered are not being fulfilled. life is all about choices, and you can choose to go off and enjoy your life. nobody actually owns you, but you own your own feeling and are responsible for them.

XxPhbwNfaa	If you already have a custody agreement through the court system where you live, read it carefully, and see if it limits you to living within a certain number of miles of the father of your child.  If it does not, then you just move.      If there are limitations on the court agreement, or you do not have a court agreement, then petition your local court for permission to leave the jurisdiction with your child, and specify visiting privileges while establishing or re-establishing child support responsibilities.    It's important to your child, as you have recognized, to maintain a relationship with his or her father, no matter what kind of person that father might be.  It will give your child the opportunity to make decisions based on his or her own observations, un-coerced by your bias.    So long as you are willing to allow visitation whenever possible, the court shouldn't limit your freedom to choose a workable living arrangement.  If you have full custody, that's a plus on your side, especially if he has been remiss in child support.|`|nCWjdyddaa	My opinion is that it would be wrong for you to move your child away from his father. You chose to risk a pregnancy out of wedlock. Now you have to do what is right for your son. And what is right is to keep him where he can see his father regularly.     Your child should not be living with an unrelated adult, either. Don't move in with the boyfriend until you're ready to be married to him.    Okay, folks, bring on the thumbs down . . .|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	Have you tried talking to the father?  If he agrees there is no problem|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hi Sexy.  You didn't give any details about the age of your child or what kind of custody set up you have, if any, with the courts.  These could be important factors in our responses to you.      In general, I would say that a discussion with his Dad would be in order.  Explain to him as you did to us, leaving out the girlfriend issues, and ask him if he is willing to let you go without a fight if you agree to certain visitation as you mentioned.  Let him know that you're not trying to take his son away.  Ask him what would be a good visitation schedule would be for him.  Try and make as many compromises as you can, as long as it doesn't interfere with you having a life as well.      If he acts like a jerk, your only recourse may be to go to the courts.      Good luck.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	The only way you can do this is with the permission of the father.
11aa8135c3596e59ef58444c24f61d62aa	About five minutes. :) If you are living with roommates or taking classes everyone is in the same boat with you and looking to make friends, too. I found making friends in college to be a piece of cake. Joining clubs is a great way to do it, too. Most colleges have lots of different clubs so you can probably find one you're interested in. Or see if your church has a campus ministry- those are great for making friends. Have fun. :)|`|5c3c6d49134ba912d98633a79f71e057aa	i think it would be just like going to a  new school, so however you made friends in your earlier schools, do the same this time too|`|d3c998a073964cd1888be95749ad23d8aa	the people on your floor instantly become your crowd and if ur lucky you and ur roommate will be good friends instantly. leave your door open and be yourself and you'll be fine.|`|22930855cdca3971dece6ed424577472aa	my first time in collage i found a person and i told him you look like a famous charecter     from this moment he is my best friend for 6 years     and i can not get rid of him :)|`|37b910a91ff0bc69493d5f9242e125f1aa	It all depends on your personality.

87pV5lvZaa	You seem like a woman with strong convictions who knows what she wants, and it doesn't seem like you want to be in this relationship unless some serious changes occur.  I don't blame you.  If my husband had cursed at me once or twice in jest, then I wouldn't be asking for a divorce.  But if I talked to him about this and explained that it made me feel lousy and he CONTINUED to to do it, I'd have a serious decision to make.    It's not so much the cursing that is upsetting, but rather what it represents.  Cursing at someone--even in a joking manner--is disrespectful and sometimes even degrading.  It can also represent latent, unexplored bitterness.  Could he be angry at you but be keeping it inside?  Maybe this is his immature way of venting...    Regardless, I would talk to him one more time and be VERY CLEAR that I was not at all okay with this type of joking.  (It's not as if stopping would harm him in any way.)  If he refused, then I would have to end the relationship.  Like you said, this type of behavior is not only rude, but it represents selfishness that could bleed over into other parts of your relationship.  It's like the tip of an iceberg--the part that you see is only a small representation of the danger lying in wait.|`|g6n3OnmSaa	He's driving you nuts, you can't stay with him.  You're waiting for him to knock it off like a normal peson would do when someone told them their "humor" wasn't appreciated, he doesn't soun like he is.  You don't like it.  That's enough reason to leave.  (I'm assuming you're dating and not married, in which case I'd say maybe work on it).  He will give you headaches if you keep him.|`|jntY15Q0aa	Kick this guy to the curb!!!  This is most definitely disrespectful behavior...if he really loved you, he would treat you with the utmost consideration and care possible.|`|ngujdeYAaa	First off.....Any harsh words of any kind to a "LOVE ONE" should never in tail NEGATIVE Verbal abuse like your receiving.  Why doesn't he say Positive playful words to you like, My sunshine, or honey Bunny, or even my Caribbean Queen?  Face it this words he uses are not used in a joking situation are they.  Example does he call you biotch during a happy conversation at the time he uses this word or is he doing it to show his male superiority around others?  Why are all his playful picking at you with negative words and not positive words.  ITS CALL VERBAL ABUSE and you need to give your attention to someone who deserves it and not this Verbally abusive a-Hole....LOL there I go again..Tell him I was just joking with him.........NOT!!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I think you need to nicely tell him that you DON'T talk that way to someone you RESPECT.  It is that simple.  If he doesn't respect you this will simply gradually get worse.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	I actually took the time to read your dilemma, it seems to me as if they are not necesarily jokes, that is just the way he is...He has a sailors mouth...Nothing you say will change him trust me...when someone is used to it it becomes part of their everyday vocabulary...its like trying to change someones accent almost. wont happen, if you feel so offended by it becomes a turn off...you have 2 choices now, ignore and move on, or end it now..you can also participate...one more thing...when he DOES get angry...what do you think hes gonna sound like?? yeah...not very nice...|`|gfHutvEFaa	if it bothers you then he needs to respect that. Find something that you think is "cute or funny" and he thinks is disrespectful and cruel and do that. When he complains tell him "you're just doing it in a loving and funny way".

Being playful and silly is fine, but he has crossed the line.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	okay i only read like 6 sentences and i dont have to read the rest to know that if someone is calling you names that are known to be offensive and down right degrading, WHY in the world are just standing there and taking it. if the guy is simply not respecting the fact that you don't like to be called these names, then move on. if he can't take the hint the first time then LEAVE!!!!!! go!!!!! stop allowing him to disrespect your image and your feelings. have some self-respect and leave this guy. no guy should call their girl *****,  dumdass or anything else.|`|HBUO10i7aa	HE'S A RUDE, INSENSITIVE BASTARD THAT YOU NEED TO DROP LIKE A HOT ROCK.......THERE ARE TOO MANY  DECENT GUYS OUT THERE TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HIS "KIDDING"...LOSE HIM!|`|3ctchU2faa	I would tell him he needs to learn that his words are disrespectful and hurtful to you.

Never are the jokes blunt name calling. he tells you he is joking after because he is naturally verbally abusive and he wants to hide that by saying "im joking". if he is already being like that in three months, can you imagine three years? what would he do to you then? It really irritates me when people try to be funny by making blunts insults. it is so imature and can lead to serious verbal abuse in years to come.

What is it that you REALLY want, desire in your life.     If getting it is impossible, in the most definite sense (like.. for example a child who has lost his mother wanting her back..) then understand that you cannot get it.    Fix the next thing you want in your mind. Write it in big bold letters and paste it on the wall. Every second of the day, WORK towards it. It may be a long-term goal, broken into lil sub-goals.    Man is an animal who reasons. If there is no reason to live, he DOES lose the will to live.     If you are a procrastinative person, you have to SOLVE your problem SOMEhow! Find a friend who has the same problem, both of you can push each other to do the things the other wants to do - but is lazy.

AA11103563	First of all, give yourself a break. Your not crazy! Sounds like you are going through the motions of a break-up. Even though your relationship was bad,  you and your ex were still  connected through sex. Right? Now that she is with someone else, your starting to feel that connection to fizzle as well. My only advice to you is let time heal and realize that your relationship wasn't worth the drama. The hard part is you work together, so you need to find a way to separate your feelings.|`|AA10733221	Yes, you're jealous.  Even though it didn't work out for the two of you, it's hard for you to see her with someone else.  It's normal to feel jealous, so don't be overly concerned about it.  Understand that you can't just "turn off" all of your feelings.

I have bene there and gone through the same, but walk away and find something to focus on to get your mind off her.  You dont want her to see that it buggs you because she might flaunt it more.   You both are having tough times becuase im sure she may be feeling the same, but trying to get away from it.   Takle a deep breathe and get through it.  You wil find someone in time, so dont give in.     Hang in there!|`|194bdb9195d069d50f6138efe4e84e05aa	probably, you got used to feeling that she's YOUR gf. u used to hold her and stuff. but now she together with another man just seems out of ordinary to you. perhaps there's some kind of selfishness involved (but not in a bad way), like: she used to be mine. how dare he?... you have to move on and get used to seeing her not alone. try not look back. if you don't love her, then there's nothing to think about. live your life)
AA10453315	yea, most likely you are just feeling sorry for him and that's the reason why you don't want to leave him, but it sounds like the healthy man is the one you really would like to be with, so why don't you explain to the ill one that you do love him but you can only offer friendship at this time. You need to be with the one that makes you happy and believe it or not, from what you said, it sounds like you already know the answer to your own question, you want to be with the healthy one and you should be if your heart chose him|`|8915b869fec119265c0310df0bc94db5aa	girl...get a life ....that's just not good!|`|42df1ee43205e64e82376f160b4b42dbaa	yeah I think you are, you could hang around long enough for him to pass|`|AA12349394	Yes, you are a good person and you don't want a sicky broken hearted...but you need to live and be good to yourself.

You might love them both but you are missing things that you feel you need to be happy by staying with the sick one. From the way you sound, you already feel as if you should only be friends with the sick one. That's what you should do. You've already started a sexual relationship with the healthy one. Because of history you have with the sick you you feel that the love and promise of a future is equal but as a unenvolved by-stander you seem to be more drawn to the healthy one already.|`|a65fc93fcef4a4a0ca73426b27ed056daa	You don't sound like you are in love with the one you live with!.    You did not say anything about the one you live with like you did about the other guy.     You sound like you are in love with the other guy, but you just love the one you live with.   You just might feel a little pity too!     And now your problem is solved!

Being co-depedent will eventually break a relationship into nothing.     Also be honest with each other. Your spouse isn't going to know what's wrong if you don't tell him or her. If you want flowers, you need to tell her or him. Although it may take out the romance, it will strengthen your relationship.    Don't be afraid of fights. Settle them quickly and be sure to listen, but arguments often strengthen a relationship. There is not a single marriage out there that is perfect. Anyone who says that their marriage has been perfect without fights is lying to someone.|`|AA11727917	You start off loving each other instead of learning to love each other.

A guy who truly loves you will not behave in such a way, because from his actions, he is acting selfishly and love is not selfish. I expected that he would have been more understanding and reshedule the date for another time. Also, you are a lady and you are not expected to do the chasing and wooing; it is the man's part to the chasing and therefore un-ladylike for you to do so. My advice is that you should let him be. If he really loves and care about you, he will call you and resume the relationship. And if he does not, don't fret yourself, you are still young and would meet other fun and exciting young men. Cheers

He has a book too that is better than the movie.  Closed adoptions mean the adoptive parents do not have contact with the biological parent and they do not know any personal information about the biological parent either.  That means a child cannot legally find their birth parent until the age of 18.  But that doesn't mean a child can't try.  It usually means the biological parent doesn't want to be found... usually because they are ashamed that they placed their baby for adoption.
f7657fcfc65b151a3d338af69ef0f8d7aa	I wrote a paper about this whole topic in college and I got an A and I will tell you not only from my own experience, but also from the research i did for this paper.  It is a fact that there are harsher penalties for abusing animals then for incest sex abuse.  If you abuse a child that is not related, it is more serious in a court of law, but if you are related, they do not do much.  You would be in more trouble if you abused an animal. That is a fact!  Look it up. Make sure you look up incest sex abuse, not just child sex abuse. There should be stricter laws on sex abuse but I guess animals are far more important.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	YES, IF YOU CANT PRODUCED THE LETTER AND WHAT  EVER YOU HAVE TO THE POLICE THEN SOMETHING CAN  BE DONE.

The abuse is not her fault and if he abused her, he has probably abused other girls so she could be saving some other girl by reporting her brother to the police.  The most important thing is for her to know it's not her fault and she's not alone.  It's a horrible (but important) battle that she must fight.  The best thing you can do is encourage her to find a therapist who can help her.|`|978d76cf6b89564f2718eae5912fcd3baa	yes he will get arrested if over the age of 18 when this went on but i suggest you give it to someone who is a citizen.|`|f6523036520a2cf841b485fb59e22e72aa	YES!!! it isn't right! she needs to put her brother in jail and be free to not be abused.|`|f8542504b530acf5815fd629f811187aaa	definately yes !!!!! dont let e matter rest , if your a true friend i know you will definately help her out . dont worry they will keep e info confidential and he sld be punished for behaving like a jerk ...

d0669011b9da21dffd0751380127e6abaa	Well lets be real here!, You really have to trust your intuition,(Gut Feelings) Maybe yer bf was acting funny 'cause he wuz play in' another girl, or maybe he had something important on his mind besides you! The truth of your matter is if you do decide to cheat on your man! Things between the two of you will deteriorate rapidly,  no matter how try to hide it he will find out.  And here is the biggest reason your Boyfriends best friend is working you like he is!  He is probably jealous of the time you and your bf spend together, besides if you cheat, you will eventually lose it all, as the best friend will eventually dump you for a couple reasons, One being that he will realize how easily you broke the trust with your true love, and secondly, He, as most  people realize that if a person cheats once, then they will most certainly cheat again.  So My honest advice to you is make your mind up first! Be kind to your bf, be honest with him, let him know how you feel, whats been going on during the time he was"acting funny" (If it was me! I'd want an explanation) and lastly tell him about his best friend trying to make a move on you! If you feel you cant be completely honest with each other, Then your truly not ready to be in a committed relationship. I hope for your sake you take some time to think before you choose your path!|`|AA11326442	If he hasn't been acting right, let him know what you need and want.

Losing a relationship that was really intense is like losing a loved one. Both are dead. I think that there is a mourning process that each person needs to go through, The length of time is set up by how much strength you have to fight off the sadness. I was told by my therapist that I was allowed to be silly it isn't wrong to have hopes and dreams for a relationship to heal. But you can't plan on it. And if you are like me you don't want to date. Sometimes it is hard to open up again and you don't want to take a guy as a rebound. That doesn't help either. Try to do things that you ahve always dreamed of doing.

He has a kid with an ex-girlfriend?. He went for someone much younger (you) because he cannot have a real adult relationship with a female his own age.hence the insecurity etc.  RUN FORREST RUN!!  You see it as "an older  "MAN" likes me.." I suspect you may have had divorced parents as well. My parents were divorced and I used to date older men myself..til wised up, which was some time after I turned 30.    Get this book "The 10 Stupid things women do to mess up their lives."

Victoria Secret|`|62dcaf064231cb5bb51fe4f9d63159e4aa	Hmmm.. He's 14 years older than you, has a son with someone else and feels responsible enough to take car of his ex by paying the bills.  Do you really want this much baggage in your life?     He shouldn't be so insecure about you just because you are pretty and have men hitting on you.  Since he is so insecure, he's probably afraid of being hurt so he keeps you at a distance.  He will never let you be really close to him because he's insecure and that will hurt your relationship in the end.      If you are thinking of dumping him, then I say you should do it now.  Do it while you are strong enough to let go of him.|`|fe9927ceff2ae799881b2f8c7e9ecab2aa	thats a very intresting situation! you really have to look and see if you really do love him!  and it has to be strong love not just sex stuff if you know what i mean!|`|7caecde20078c67fdf70ed12185fdabeaa	It's an unbalanced relationship.  You are the prize and he's afraid he doesn't have a reason for you to stick around.    Truth is, he probably doesn't and he knows it.  He should probably play back in his own league (you're obviously out of his league) and look for someone more compatible.    (If he was smart, he'd just enjoy the time he has with you for now.)

First of all, we have some self esteem issues we need to deal with here. Not to mention health issues.    Men are sluts and women are walking vaginas to them. My husband and I had a talk last night and he pretty much confirmed this for me. They can fall in love, but it's a lot of work for them unlike us.     Sounds like you are looking for someone to like/love you. If you don't love yourself, no one else will. Think of your stuff as a prize... you have to be deserving to get this! Always ask yourself, "What can he do for me besides screw me?" If you can't come up with anything he needs to go bye-bye. Stop being nice and find that inner B*tch! That is the only thing men respect and if they stop talking to you, they weren't good enough for you anyway.     Hold your head up girl! No matter what you look like, how big or small you are, you deserve someone who will respect the fact that you say no. Now if you enjoy it and you are truly a nympho, you should find one guy and explain to him that you are here to fulfill my needs and that's it. He needs to be on call at all times. Trust me, no man will say that he doesn't want to be your boy toy.|`|157549b99ff73136583fa202fbefdf0faa	You are a nympho.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Its not lust, its a search for approval.  You need professional help. With a pastor if you can't afford a therapist. You don't like yourself, and the few minutes you feel wanted by the men who use you make you feel desirable.  Its not making you happy which is the key here, so you have the need and desire to change.

AA10724599	He is buying you things from Dollar General,and passing them off as "expensive"|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Hi..It sounds as if he may be feeling that "he" needs to buy you things. Have you given him any reason to feel that he is somehow not satisfactory? Is the delay in the wedding date an issue for you? From my personal experience, a guy gives gifts out of "really being in love" or because he thinks he needs to "buy" your love or acceptance. Make sure you let him know that you would rather he save his money for your "future together" than to spend it on trinkets now. Maybe you can even talk to him about a financial goal that both of you can work towards....a down payment on a home for example. The main thing is that you need to be honest with yourself and with him. Don't be afraid to talk to him about his finances or to disclose your finances to him. If you are going to be married, these should not be secrets. It is a very big part of marriage and can cause a lot of trouble if things are not open and above board. Good luck.|`|79d1e539728561272751a53d8398a465aa	I would make sure he isn't spending any sort of trust fund or going into significant debt to give you these gifts. It is admirable he wants to give you nice things. You need to make sure he knows he doesn't have to, and that there is no need to go into debt in order to give you these things.     Just let him know that being with him is enough.

6f505bf143962079e9fc1928c849694eaa	Naturally anyone with any self respect would be out of there after finding out something like that.    BUT, you'd also want to know why your partner cheated. Not to put it right with your partner, just to know. You'd want to know if it was something you did, whether he simply got tempted by another person and couldnt say no etc    You'd need to know for your own peace of mind to allow you to move on .. otherwise, the next time you get into a relationship you'd be so paranoid of it happening again cause you didnt know or understand why it happened in your first relationship.    Just my thoughts -never happened to me and hope it never does|`|ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	I had a former boyfriend that later played the role of what he termed as my 'third best friend' (since we'd gotten acquainted thru my two best friends--a couple I know well) and out of curiosity I asked him later about the sequence of events that led up to the breakup, when he'd started dating the 'new girl', etc.  I was curious as to whether he'd be forthcoming with the true facts about the situation and I needed to know in order to build trust necessary for a good friendship.  He dodged the question and/or gave vague responses.  The way he responded told me everything I needed to know.  It helped me make the right decision when he suddenly tried to make out with me again.  I didn't fall for it.  It's hard to consider someone as a good friend once you know that they have been untruthful about an issue that is impt. to you and I had no trouble not dating him again.  I also learned another valuable lesson in the process--that guys say they want to just be your friend but they are secretly hoping they can develop a 'friends with benefits' situation.  That would be fine if that's what two people wanted....it's just not for me.  As to continuing a relationship after someone cheated....I can't see that happening either.  Loyalty and trust are precious commodities.  So I agree with your statements that once someone has cheated, you're aware of it, what's there to talk about.|`|21240bb18b2c3d2006ab81e4ebe5d391aa	first of all this has happened to me and 2nd of all, people just cant always turn their feelings off when this happens and they need an explanation.  What did I do that was so wrong, what was missing, need to know questions so that you can put your mind at ease and be able to cope and move forward.  Like I said how do you just turn your feelings off, even if you are hurt, it doesn't change the fact that you still love that person and now have to move on.  Its the worst feeling in the world.  Take care Heather|`|AA12084419	look i have been cheated on right but ya know wat i moved on instead of doing sumthing stupid if he cheated on you once then you know he is gonna do it again|`|AA11678279	talk if both parties still wants to give it a shot. dont talk if you have given up or he have given up.
ca44c6d491d9fd5bdfebb65804e9ff53aa	Dont worry i use to be like that to, for a few years actually. It changed when i made some new friends. When i first started to hang out with them i was really quiet and didnt say much. But as i got comfortable with them i became the loudest one with the most to say.   So just put an effort into meting some new people and try tp get comfortable with them. If you stay quiet when your around them the friendship might not be right, Just take your time.|`|CAp0lUi3aa	I am the same way but when I am around people I am comfortable with I can be myself meaning I like being goofy and I like getting to know people before I let my goofiness come out.

You need to get tough on him because he's obviously not getting it. Threaten him with a restraining order, and if he keeps doing this, then get one! I know you don't want to have to take it that far, but you might have to. Under no circumstances shall you see him or take his calls. Simply tell him to stop or your getting that order, and thats the last thing you say to him. Any response from you will only make him keep going, Good luck!!|`|R4fnnziiaa	Whoa, sounds like you have a serious situation there.  If I was you, I would have one last talk with him.  You don't want to have anything on your conscious about get a restraining order on him.  However, if it comes to that--then do it.  Some people change their phone numbers and avoid places that are frequent by said ex, but you have to live too.  Also, you might try to get him some help because it this situation sounds like it could turn serious.  I hope it all works out for you and please protect yourself and be safe.|`|9d24d9d0ecfaea29aaa2026dabf75addaa	hah.  Hang out with him as friends.

AA12054301	Its just puppy love. Give some other guy a chance and you will see that he is not so special. I have been upset when I got turned down by girls, then after I got to know them better as friends I realized that it would not have worked out anyway. I was 26 when I met my fiancee, so you have plenty of time left to find your true love, so don't worry about it.|`|dbf03e6ef2dcab397d8484d780c7fbc4aa	Puppy love... don't invest to much time on one guy. Keep searching until you find the right guy that truly cares about you.|`|2601a26d8af2930df851d4cf1990d26eaa	I cant really say that it's true love, but maybe it is love. I'm not  sure since I myself cant seem to admit that kind of thing not only to my friend but to myself as well.     do you accept his flaws as if it's part of him being perfect? it's love.

S0wFNJOEaa	It is all in the mind!  Who cares what a bunch of guys who have no self confidence at all think!  It is not of paramount importance of what other people think of your looks what matters is if you are happy with yourself.  Most people that make fun of others have low self esteem and NO self confidence.  You said that you used to have some confidence well you never lost it it just hid for a bit,look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself your are a compassionate,funny and sexy girl every morning and believe it!   Trust me your confidence be back in no time!  I for one find someone that has confidence in herself very attractive!!|`|pAyl6M1faa	you get it back by NOT listening to other people! I personally care very deeply about other people, but I really don't give a crap how most people feel about me! It's how I feel about myself that counts!    I don't look like a movie star, far from it! But I'm a smart, nice guy, with my own sense of values that I got from two great parents.    Looks are not everything you know! Many of the people with killer looks are not happy people. Some of the happiest people I know are everyday people who could never be on the cover of a magazine, or own a fast car, or live in a home with all the latest crap....but they are good people who are very happy to be alive!    The secret to enjoying life is to realize that all the superficial stuff does not make people happy! When you can look at what is really important (your health, your values, your generosity, your zeal learning, nature, etc.), then you will gain a real sense of self. Everything else is just window dressing! Look at all the people who have great looks and millions of dollars and how screwed up their lives are from drugs, multiple divorces that have drained them emotionally and financially, their kids who get into major trouble, etc., etc. It's because of the waste and misguided belief that looks and money are everything, when they are actually nothing!|`|WyDc0hX3aa	First off don't ever listen to what people think about you everyone is beautiful in their own way, and those 3 guys are jerks.|`|7hmr5aQfaa	by looking at uglier girls around you|`|AA10474060	It is hard to get your confidence back after something like that. You are right that those guys were jerks. What you need to do is tell yourself that you are ok. You might not believe it at first but keep telling yourself it and then you will eventually believe it. Blow a kiss at your reflection when ever you see your self. When you next encounter jerks like those, tell them that you are to fine for losers like them anyway. Stick with your friends they got your back.
DvGBTg7iaa	Ok I disagree with everyone here, mainly because I have been here before on both ends. I am a quite guy, church goer and have been a guy that thinks the girl is into him and also the guy who is into a girl and didn't know if it was mutual. The best thing to do is nothing at all, keep it casual. If he likes you it will be quite obvious, look at his eyes light up as he talks to you or the genuine smile he has when he sees you. watch if he stares as you walk away/toward him. look for the simple subtle clues. Don't ask him because if he dose not like you in that way then it could make the situation awkward and potentially change the friendship. Let the relationship unfold on its own, don't rush it. Just the fact that he is a quite kid that finds it easy to talk to you should tell you something.|`|D8zDIIdWaa	If he didn't like you then he wouldn't want to "Hang Out" Jsut be honest  and upfront with him. I know it seems hard to do, but it's better for both of you in the long run. You'll get major Kudos just for stepping up to the plate.|`|n1yxPDW5aa	Aww that's so cute. Does your church have activities like shows or picnics? You can ask him to hang with you at those. Or ask if he wants to sit by you at church service.|`|FWcBCfawaa	if hes a senior and dating someone whose in 7th grade, and he does anything sexual with her, he might be looking at becoming a bonafied, registered sex offender thats child mollestation!

Once you two are out of school and get going with your lives just hope you can still remain real good friends and eventualy more. Don't rush him and don't rush yourself. Let the relationship happen...     From a 47yo father of two recent teens (now young men).|`|erweVAxhaa	Hm, i think he does like you.    POP the question unexpectedly.|`|HgnkChN4aa	Ask him straight up. And lay all the cards on the table.  But be by yourselves when you do.|`|SxShCxjYaa	yes you should ask him to see then if he does get to know him more eventually if you have feeling for him you willl ask him  out bow chicka wow wow|`|nvbpOnmOaa	aw he sounds like a really sweet guy, maybe u should just be straight forward and ask him if he likes u, wuts the worst thing that could happen?|`|xCYYY93Baa	Why don't you ask him if he like's spending time with you and then if he says yes ask him if he'd like to spend more time with you ? also ask him if he See's you as a friend, but don't say the word GIRLFRIEND if he says no then you haven't made a fool of yourself and you could have just been asking to make sure that he doesn't think that it's going anywhere, then your not making a fool of yourself and not risking rejection flat out.|`|9a1c1c3e11c94fc756292dcf4084bee5aa	Dont play games with asking him just straight out ask him I suggest if you think he likes you. I know from experience I hate knowing someone likes me but they keep acting like there just a friend and they dont both to even hint. The best thing you can do is just tell him and if he does not like you in that way, oh well you tryed and hopefully you two will still be able to be friends and im sure you will considering you two are religous people and learn to forgive and all that idk lol.  but Hope this helps hun and good luck|`|EDdNzVUzaa	he seems to like you.next time you guys go out for coffee just ask him if he likes any girls.and if he pauses and stares at you then you'll know
4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	If your gut tells you not to trust him....maybe you shouldn't.  Then again, if you never date him...you'll never know.  Maybe date him, just not exclusively.|`|71eb194551f71e5eb573dce622125c6eaa	Take it slow, and if he wants to move faster  than you are willing then you know he's not  the one!|`|AA11583701	If you don't try it you'll never know, and you might regret it later|`|ftZO5c4zaa	that doesnt mean you would be 'skanky' for going out with him  you will never know the results unless you go for it  and yes it is normal for ppl to fall in love quickly|`|AA10975730	You'll never know if you don't try it.  You don't trust him yet then...  Let him take the first step, if he doesn't, then it means that he only wants to play with you and be the party guy you think he is, that hooks up with skanky girls...     Give it a try, if and only if, he does the first move.  Do not become the skanky one!  Be smart and good luck!|`|Wm5QUtZiaa	When you have a crush on someone it is pretty normal to have them on your mind like almost every hour.    Take it slow.  Remember a relationship that will last isn't one that is based on the "I like you & you like me" idea...it is based on attraction,friendship and compatibility.  Nobody is the BAD person here.  He might not want to be exclusive...he seems to like to be flirty.  You are probably more on the reserved side.  If this isn't something you can take then it might be easier to just move on.  However talk to him first.  Maybe after he is in an official relationship he kinda calms down and dedicates his time to one special girl.  You won't know until you talk to him about it.  Be sure to be casual,nonjudmental & understanding...and don't get too clingy.|`|LW77L1Zbaa	yeahh  if you like him dont let him go|`|iVjq7o5daa	It's normal for a woman to like a guy very quickly. He obviously did the right things to push your buttons.    Before I date women, I always convince myself that she's just a girl and if it doesn't work out, oh well, I'll get another one very soon.    Always be up for meeting new people because if you find an additional guy you like, you won't care if this one dumps you.    It also helps with breakups. They're difficult to get over until you find a new love interest.

AA10975730	Si tu novio tuviera relaciones sexuales con otra mujer muy buena a la que considerara mucho mas atractiva que tu... que esperarias de el? Minimo que te lo confiese.  Lo unico que te va a hacer mejor persona es renunciar a ti misma, hablarle con la verdad y estar dispuesta a perderlo.  Y con el otro hombre, pues puedes seguir teniendo relaciones sexuales pero no te involucres emocionalmente con nadie mas.  Decirle la verdad a tu novio, va a contar mas en tu libro de acciones a la hora de tu muerte...

Las relaciones humanas son muy complicadas, pero yo solo te dara un consejo: si de verdad quieres a tu novio y con tu "amigo" sabes que solo es sexo, eres tu misma quien tienes que valorar hasta donde te interesa ser infiel a tu novio solo por mantener una relacin sexual con alguien que no va a ser nada ms.  Yo no he estado en tu situacin, pero bueno te deso suerte.  |`|bKcjV4Uaaa	La situacin que expones es bastante compleja y a la vez sumamente comn.   Lo ideal es que te plantees qu es lo que realmente necesitas en este momento. La atraccin fsica la puedes conseguir muchas veces a lo largo de la vida, una relacin plena de pareja realmente pocas. Si con tu pareja actual tienes el contacto fsico que con tu compa?ero sexual y adems tienes la compa?a que necesitas, quiz sea momento de dejar atrs los encuentros con tu amigo.   No has hecho mal. Has decidido sentir y aventurarte a algo. Sin embargo, quiz si dejas pasar ms tiempo, ms de una persona salga lastimada (y posiblemente una de las personas lastimadas puedas ser t).  Tu compa?ero sexual seguramente entender que quieres dedicar tu tiempo a tu pareja actual y podrn quedar tan contentos como antes de conocerse y t le dars la oportunidad necesaria a tu pareja actual para que experimente contigo esas cosas que habas encontrado en otra persona.  Insisto, mal no hiciste. Simplemente, te decidiste a experimentar. Ni te culpes ni te juzgues por ello. Slo decidete si lo que te interesa es dar vuelta a la pgina y tener unar relacin sin tantas complicaciones como lo es ver a dos personas.

yY1qxrI5aa	he should just take the chance.  bleargh to asking beforehand!    you'll know because she'll turn quiet before hand. if she's chattering away she's probably not thinking about it...unless it's nervous chatter of course.    but you should be able to tell if someone likes you because they're smile and looks at you are different to what you normally get with other people. your eye contact should make an unspoken understanding. i think they call that chemistry. i think you'll know when it's right :) :)|`|Ob9ksKYPaa	Me personally, I like to be man handled.   So when a guy just takes charge, I think its really sexy.  But when I was younger I thought it was really cute when boys would ask first.     Just go in for the kiss, show her you have balls.|`|pu0U5FMMaa	if she leans in to you go for it.|`|BZ72klLZaa	meh...if the guy is dead hot it would be, otherwise just go for it lol|`|iDAVHgu4aa	The best thing that you should do is kiss her. What is the worst that could happen? She will move away but if you don't make the move you will never know.    DG|`|AA11678279	it depends in the moment actually.. and it depends what kind of girl you are dating.. if you think the girl is very conservative -- its best to ask her, if she is outgoing -- i think she likes you to take over the moment and just do it..|`|mK2mis23aa	Yes. I don't know about other girls, but I can tell when a guy wants to kiss me. So asking really isn't necessary. Just take the chance and make your move confidently.|`|UXCJ681Faa	It depends on the girl if she's shy or very classy ask her before hand or hold her by the hand and lean slowly for a kiss but if she's very open then there's no point but if you had to ask this question it probably means you do care what she really thinks and if she felt the same it really wouldn't matter. Good luck.|`|GpoXXe6aaa	It's not a turn off.  It's nice if it's like the first time.  If you've been going out for a while, it should be natural for the both of you.|`|rLZ7d5EYaa	make the move|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I HATE it when a guy asks that...it's so dumb. If he comes towards me to kiss and I respond, then I'm into it. If he comes towards me and I move away, then obviously I don't want to kiss! Get the hint!|`|7ciDto6Daa	It would be nice if your just met the girl, but if you've seen each other before then you should just make the move, if you think you too share the same chemistry.|`|9GhVfaIFaa	Just go slowly so she can turn it into a cheek kiss if she isn't into you.|`|l6jfVYVvaa	yes-if the moment is right-dont ask permission-just go for it.|`|ukcNjRA7aa	mmm... it wouldnt turn me off. because i know hes respecting what i want and that is a big plus in what i like in guys. and then you can find out if its what you both want, rather than just getting snubbed if she doesnt want to kiss you when you try.. that would be embarrassing. if its not the first time your kissing her though it might become frustrating to her if you ask everytime!
MLFBsZnUaa	sounds a bit early to send out the invites...im sending mine out two months before n requesting RSVPS for about a month before. Most weddings I have been to have done the same. Hope that helped!|`|nqINitkmaa	Wow, you are sending the invitations out really early. Is it a destination wedding? If its not you shouldnt send the invitations out until at most 2 months before the wedding. The response in the RSVP card is usually requested to be returned two weeks prior to the wedding date    I got my invitations at a invitation store the women has to research on ettiquite for her job, so this is the way she suggested we do it. The guests are from michigan and will be flying to california for the wedding.    The wedding is August 21st 2009  Save the date cards- 02/17/09  Invitations- 06/17/09  RSVP Return- 08/07/09    If you are not having a destination Wedding then, you don't need save the date cards and you don't need to send them out quite so far in advance.    Hope this helped!|`|k6F9zkIRaa	I'd say about 3-2 weeks before your wedding date for the RSVP. This way you can have a pretty accurate count and you can confirm with the caterer how many people will be attending! Good luck and congrats :)|`|DxbaEPbUaa	yes! put RSVP on the invitations. congratulations!!|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Most people put an RSVP date a good week or so before some important deadline for the hotel or something.  Because here's what's going to happen:  only 1/3 to 1/2 of the people will respond by that date and you're going to wind up on the phone.  Pain in the butt, but that's mostly how it goes these days.    I would say put the RSVP date for around 2 weeks after you mail the invites.  If you make it too far into the future, they'll be like "oh I don't have to think about this now" and it will migrate to the bottom of their bill pile.  Just give yourself some time so that after the date passes you (or your fiance, or your mother!) can make all those darn phone calls.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I say 3-4 weeks prior at the latest.|`|oMEtUobVaa	May!
1kZenfZzaa	Boys tend to hide their emotions.  The way they deal is to not deal sometimes.  It doesn't mean they don't care.  Please keep a close eye on him when his dad passes away.  It may hit him very hard.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Each of us display our grief and pain in different ways and he may be in denial or just setting on it to keep from letting anyone see him showing others how he feels     The term is macho|`|xBd96wvRaa	Everyone reacts to trauma differently.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	well yeah its normal  but you shouldnt feel that way|`|PDNNhEs1aa	i was the same way when my uncle was dieing of cancer when my parents said he had died i didn't feel any emotion i felt really bad at the time but my friend said people deal with things differently either that or it will all come at once and you ll just be really emotional|`|S9B8Fr4daa	While you think he isn't showing emotions--He's just bottling it up inside.  This is what is known as the 'Denial' stage of grieving.  and it completely normal.  See if you can get him to open up about how he feels.  Explain to him-That if he does not talk to someone about how he feels before he passes--then it is only going to be worst after he is gone.  I wish you luck and sorry to hear about your 'husbands' illness|`|TaTCbLSzaa	well if you dont want to believe that  this is happening to him i suppose no but maybe your in denial and when it actually happens itll get the most of you and youll prolly show emotion then im like that all the time when someone passes on i dont cry but when there actually gone and ppl start talking about them thats when my emotions start to kick in. Dont feel bad your just in shock and you dont know what to think your only 16 stay strong and just stay by his side they gave my aunt 2 wks to live and she lived for about a month more doctors dont know and shouldnt tell how long they have to live because my aunt proved them wrong and she didnt have oxygen no ventilator respirator thingy and she stayed with us longer then what they had told us doctors PRACTICE medicine just have faith in him and let things go as they come|`|qn9NilP3aa	No.|`|hOTXIrcnaa	he raised you for 16 years  he changed yur diapers  he helped your mom deliver  so ******* show some respect and care for your father  he is the man  and you are being a penis becuase you do not give a ****|`|KMo5TbgHaa	sure.  he probably shows emotion privately away from other eyes.  Also, he's probably already aware and prepared himself for the loss.|`|9MhlmO74aa	Maybe he doesn't love his father for some reason or maybe in his heart he has too many emotions therefore he cant show them on the outside|`|8BG2tqTGaa	i dont think it is, unless he has raised him awfully, or abuses him|`|Ch40nAvCaa	He's probably in a state of shock.|`|cmFU81rQaa	I know that I show the least emotion over things that actually matter to me.|`|9vmnr0iQaa	no|`|hiJ6yKhkaa	he probably raised you that way.|`|eoqTXCGxaa	Yes. (no joke)|`|VBNRtRVDaa	its gonna hit him hard when he actually dies...|`|XczuYnl7aa	no it isn't.  you'll feel **** when he's gone|`|nfgI3Enhaa	yes.|`|de5lDm0saa	yes. People deal with death in different ways. When my father died I couldn't wait to go back to school because I wanted to feel like my life would be normal again.|`|lJrlg5b8aa	no. this boy will have lots of emotional probs in the future if he doesnt let it out|`|6oli1iF4aa	It depends what you mean by "show no emotion". It may be that it doesn't really seem real at the moment and it will take time for a reaction.     Someone appearing zombified / numb is definitely a reaction.     Some people will want to not think about it and avoid he subject, or cover it up by doing "normal" things. There's no standard response to grief.|`|VPptQSBHaa	Yes, a lot of people who should be feeling grief/pain in sad situations don't, myself included.  Some people deal with it differently.  It's almost like a shock or confusion.  It feels surreal but you don't know how to react.  It's normal, don't worry, but I suggest taking advantage of the time you have with him if you're not already.|`|C7jrdNb3aa	He proberly is showing emotions but not around people. He might cry at night or something and just doesnt want to show it to anyone.|`|UBS4jIAcaa	yes it's called denial and/or shock.    he is 16 thus doesn't know his **** from his elbow when it comes to emotions.     make sure he has lots of access to support and keep him away from drink.|`|v0M85GCAaa	People react to things like that differently.  The emotions might come in the form of another one (i.e., hostility to others instead of grief over his father), or it hasn't quite sunk in that it's happening yet.  It could also be that if the illness as been around for a while, it's been subconsciously filtered and processed and accepted on some level as being inevitable.|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Yes.  This may be the way he processes his grief.  It may also depend on what kind of relationship he has with his father.|`|DK3wRkkwaa	if the two were very close, it wouldn't be normal at all. however, if they spent hardly any time with each other, then i guess it wouldn't be unusual if the boy wasn't emotional.|`|Mh99iXFOaa	People deal with their emotions in different ways. He probably is terribly upset but he doesnt want to express his feelings. As he is only 16 he may feel like he cant be a 'Wuss' and get upset, as he gets older he will probably admit that he was upset but didnt know how to show it. Just tell him that you will always be there to talk if he needs help. That way he might feel a little more comfortable coniding in you. Good luck :)
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i think you broke up and you tried to kill yourself.  thats not love, thats crazyness.    go seek help.      your entirely too young to think of getting married|`|nqINitkmaa	So your not even together, and are planning on being together in July. Your too young, that paragraph that you wrote up there sounds like a 12 year out wrote it. You also said that you are probably in love?  When your in love you know it. Plus your too young to know what love is. Grow up hes just a childhood crush, in 10 years you wont even know he exists.     You need to graduate from high school, go to college, and live a little, figure out who you are and what kind of man is going to make you happy. Trust me you have no clue what kind of man you want right now, not to mention you are just looking at boys. You are not old enough to make this kind of commitment, and hes obviously not ready either otherwise he would ask you!  You want to know what I think hes going to say, hes going to say NO, and she should!But as you already said, you don't care what anyone says so why did you even bother asking the question.|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	Seek professional help now.|`|l7awD5mcaa	I would wait because what if something happens between you two or something.  Marrying that young isn't really a good choice, and it could end up in disaster.|`|IxoazyHUaa	the fact that you say you almost killed yourself when you broke up tells me you are waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy too young and immature to be in a relationship, let alone get married.

That's why they're called KIDS and don't have any legal rights until they're 18.  I know you will hate this response but you're TOO YOUNG to even be considering marriage.  Dump the boyfriend, finish your high school education, go to college, and get a career.  THEN you can start thinking about getting married and everything that goes with it.  Live your life for YOURSELF first.  Trust me, if you do, you will be thanking me and everyone else who I know is telling you the same thing.|`|aHmAZeoqaa	I hope your parents say no because you're too young and stupid.|`|EgLTmiTjaa	gud luck|`|cYioBe3Kaa	if he makes u wanna kill urself, u dont belong in a relationship at all. ur too young and you have issues. go see a therapist.|`|0icRIEc2aa	Try and last a year without breaking up.

KwJ9UnO1aa	Well considering if your getting married honesty if a big issue. I'd ask him where he got the ring & if he asked why show him. You can't go around wearing a green ring around your finger. If it was really 14KT it wouldn't. you don't have to buy an expensive ring my engagement ring I love was only $100 from the jewelry store it's small but really nice. If you look don't look for a single diamond but small diamonds or other stones that will always be cheaper.    Heres a hint if you go to a big jelwery store don't tell them your looking for an engament ring they will push you to the expensive rings tell them your looking for a ring & ask what's on sale.|`|5kwKeWsbaa	No one needs a 4 carat ring,  unless your J.LO     Why start a relationship based on a lie.  If he is the guy for you,  you both need to be honest.  Marriage is tough sometimes and requires big truths and compromise.   If you are having issues now, how will you deal with the real big decisions.|`|0be284ba9d8943c0f05e1f9205c0b6baaa	If he will lie to you about this, he will lie to you about anything and everything.    He should have been up-front with you.  If a man proposed to me with  an inexpensive ring, that would be fine, as long as he didn't lie about it. After all, you're marrying the MAN, not the ring.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	you should talk to him about it.|`|5weCrRKRaa	1)  If he'w worth marrying, then you can discuss anything with him.     2)  Something being 14 carat gold means that it's 41.7% NOT gold.  Unless he's a jewelry expert, he doesn't know whether it's really 14 carat, or what that other 41.7% is.  If it's going to turn green, 41.7% is way more than enough to do it.    Tell him about the problem, and work out something.|`|c3COewyhaa	There are special rings that change colors upon different emotions. Loose the ring!|`|a0dc5fd630ab1ed180502b056f66af86aa	I would just keep my mouth shut.  My finger does that every time I put on a silver ring. It could be that you are allergic to white gold. If you are on a tight budget anyway you should stop complaining and just be happy you got a ring.|`|AA10922794	i dealt with this several yrs ago.it had a tiny stone in it, so i just assumed it HAD to be real. well imagine my surprise when i saw the same exact ring at walmart. (cubic zirconia!)- for $28!!.so i "tactfully" called him on it,( since he told me it was $200).he adamantly denied it, and stuck with the story.same deal, if he would've fessed upfront, i would've been ok with it.(he didn't have any money at the time either). needless to say, we didn't stay together, found out he lied about other things too. anyhow, i'd just say the same you said here. " honey, i know we don't have any money, and this ring is all you could afford, i would understand you giving me this ring, what bothers me is that you lied about it".   that way youre giving him a chance to come clean and redeem himself. if he doesn't, i'd definitely rethink the situation.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Just tell him you must be allergic to gold as its turning your finger a funny colour. This in fact could be true as some people cant wear gold or silver, only platinum. You should go with ot take the ring back and if he cant afford to get you yellow gold, it does not have to an expensive one, then you should hold off getting the ring until he can afford it.  Its time to discuss finance or you will never be able to be married to him will you ?  Good luck.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	please listen to the previous posters who told you if you can't discuss this with him then you shouldn't marry him and if he would lie to you about this then he will lie to you about anything and everything.    The way you bring it up is to let him know that you know the ring isn't real and you know that he can't afford an expensive ring and that's alright with you.  You tell him that you didn't appreciate being lied to about it and if he tells you that he didn't lie then tell him he was ripped off and he needs to take the ring back to the jeweler and get his money back. (there is that small chance that he was ripped off and he thought that he was giving you a ring made of real gold)

I think it's pointless trying to get closure because at the end of the day it really doesn't matter.     From the tone of your question, it seems like you still love her and would probably want even friendship with her but the point still remains that she doesn't want that.     I don't know if she is trying to "show off" on you by emailing only during the high points in her life such as her marriage and pregnancy or what. I also know some people because they are happy, they  just want everyone to know without any ill intention.     Cut her loose. Let her go. Don't contact her.

It seems to have lost its spark - many relationships do.  However you are not married.  Hard as it may seem to you, you must tell her how it is for you.  Pretending and trying to maintain this charade is doing no one any good.  They say the first cut is the deepest and it is a pity it has not worked.  You are both young - you are not cojoined twins yet you are waiting around while she is at her parents home.      You could always draw a line down a piece of paper and write for and against at top and fill in the space below and see what you get and which side is longest.  This is always a good starter.      SECURITY IS BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT    Sounds like you are in a rut but only you know if this is worth the long haul .......... somehow I don't think you will be together at Easter if this is how you honestly feel in yr heart!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Sounds like you are just prolonging the misery for both of you.

I would much rather someone be honest with me than to lie or end up cheating (causing major hurt).  Tell her you need a break and space to do your own thing.  Perhaps you are bored because you never do anything with anyone but your girlfriend. You probably need to have a little free time to know if you really still care for her.  As the old saying goes, "absence makes the heart grow fonder" or not. You also need to do things with your friends.  No one person can be your everything.|`|o50tkjFEaa	It sounds like you are in a tough situation... bottom line, you sound unhappy. I was in a relationship similar to that for about a year. finally, I broke up with the guy. It was hard for a while, he was miserable and so was I. Looking back it was the best decision i ever made. I got to move on with my life and found someone i wanted to be with, and that made me happy. You are so young and have some much life left. Why spend it on trying to patch up an ever tearing relationship? The girl that can make you truly happy is out there somewhere. You just need to let go of this girl and find her.|`|n1gaa7Yxaa	Mmh if you still feel that you love her just talk to her about it .   Tell your friends to do something ..

Dont TELL her.|`|DzDOE8PNaa	You guys need to talk with open communication and no criticism, so if you need a counselor to accomplish that, then by all means seek one. Your wife needs to feel comfortable with herself, maybe she's not. Maybe sex was presented to her as dirty when she was growing up, whatever the reason, you need to talk. Talk about what you like, what do you don't like and what you would like to try. As far as talking to other girls, you are married, there is a very fine line between talking to friends and flirting, make sure you give her as much attention as you do the other girls. Remember when you were dating? Do you still treat her the same? Or have you become comfortable and forgot? Marriage is all about keeping that attention to the other person alive, it takes work on a daily basis. Good luck to you.|`|xtcwWlUJaa	I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, You have hurt her somewhere in the past and now you are seeing the result of it. You probably dont even realize what you did or when you did it, but none the less I'm betting thats what has happend. Now then, you decide how to move forward from here... you can either continue to hurt her by talking to other girls, and seeing where that gets you, or you can turn this relationship around. thats up to you. If your actually interested in turning this around, the first thing you'll need to do is stop talking to other girls. Including talking to other girls about your personal problems at home. This type of conversation should only be between you and your wife, it is intimate and should be kept that way. there is never a need to share intimate details of your relationship with another girl. taking another girl into your problems is a betrayal of her trust and confidence and some would consider it "an affair of the heart".   Next, the first step to fixing this is to realize that YOU have to make the first move, and the second, third, etc etc etc. Waiting for her to turn around and make a move is never going to happen. Women give love back after receiving love, And after knowing that they can give love safely without fear of being hurt. Right now she's not feeling safe, shes been hurt (by you) and is afraid to put herself out there again because she doesnt feel secure that you will not hurt her again. Only thru a very long period of your words and actions being kind, loving, compassionate, faithful (this list could go on forever) will she feel confident in your love for her. When she feels confident, you will start to see her effort to reciprocate. But YOU gotta do it first, and YOU gotta be consistant, and YOU gotta make her feel safe, and YOU gotta allow her to feel the way she feels and accept that this isnt going to turn around overnight.  Think about how you interact with her, I'll bet somtimes your words say "I love you"( and sometimes not) and your actions say something totally different on top of it.  Only thru a consistent effort of "loving" her will she open up and "love" you back.. Remember love is a verb, its an action word.     Good luck to you|`|WItKOQh7aa	Get a girlfriend. She'll always be happy to see you, she'll never say no to fun sex and affection, and if she changes, you can just go get another one.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	In states where prostitution is illegal, this would of course, be illegal activity.      In some states, and even counties within states, there are ordinances which prohibit opposite sex persons from touching or giving massages.  I lived in one such county in Virginia.    I have dated men who enjoyed the services of a masseuse and since they were very upfront about the whole thing, I have no reason to assume there was anything but massage going on.  Massage is actually quite wonderful and I enjoy it myself.  Does it bring about ideas of sex?  Sure--you're completely relaxed and someone is totally focused on touching your body--much pleasure.  Does that mean people act on it?  No.|`|AueAwhQeaa	What you are looking for is the "wee wee wash".|`|JyghcEWpaa	umm for some yes that is a service that is provided as some of these said men-only spas...lol...|`|AA11206135	lol "only" hand release?? like that would make it better for a wife to know her husband was "only" getting jerked..|`|claW4UUcaa	some offer "happy endings"|`|aDL7xmt6aa	If it's "men only" why would I want to go there?

b553da45b259fca50eed89cd57ec9ca6aa	With my divorce, we had reached a standoff and couldn't agree to several issues... rather than have it go before a judge, we first went to mediation.  A third party, in my instance a neutral attorney, sat with us and helped us to reach a middle ground on everything except one issue.. it was really helpful, because obviously, when you can compromise it is better than having someone else (like a judge) make decisions for you.  The mediator couldn't MAKE us do anything, but it was a very helpful part of the process. Sometimes having a 3rd person there helps everyone "play nice" and you can kind of understand when you are being unreasonable better than when it's just you and the ex fighting it out... Sometimes you have the mediation with the other person present in the room, sometimes they have you in separate rooms.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	A mediator is basically a neutral party who helps the spouses communicate. Sometimes its required or ordered by the court, but it can be very helpful in a contested or difficult divorce.  The mediator will help the spouses discuss the details of the divorce, until an agreement has been reached. It helps speed up the process, otherwise the couple could be fighting for years!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Mediation is just that regardless of how you got there.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	the weighing of things,go-between if u really wants to divorced,to settle the pros and cons of marriage/divorce.

P.S. If he can afford dates at a comedy club, I think he can afford to feed his son every other weekend or less.|`|AA11206135	That is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard...

Ssssh they kill me!!!|`|gfHutvEFaa	To answer your question, yes it is outrageous that he has the audacity to insist you give him milk, food, clothes and PETTY CASH!!!! Unreal. Take that notarized letter down to the courthouse and show it to them. It is great that you are able to provide for your son without the weirdo ex, BUT, take that idiot to court and whatever the judge decides is the appropriate amount of money he must pay, put it in a separate account for your son for college or whatever. DO IT. You will be (as he will be) grateful you did later.    Good luck.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	he clearly doesnt care about his son - he shouldnt see him|`|aDL7xmt6aa	So ask yourself:   "Do you love your son?"  "Is he worth it?"

I would probably buy the foods that he needs just so your ex doesn't give him something that causes him to have an allergic reaction or just not let your son go at all - but there is no effin' way I would give him cash!!!|`|zHwlGhIAaa	you don't want to keep drama going in your son's life.  either take him to court and get child support (which he should be paying whether you need it or not) or give him the things he needs to take your son.  Your son deserves to see his father no matter how much of a deadbeat he is.  If he doesn't come see him, then it's his fault, but if you stop him, it becomes your fault.  Sometimes we just have to bow out in life and leave the pride and the anger in the cabinet. This is the time.  If he does not have the funds, then maybe he can't do it.  So why not supply him with the foods you already have at home?  Just don't tell your son hes coming until he shows up.  you don't want him to be disappointed.|`|5c4f75a1d34f57b4f0511c3f36f5294caa	Your ex is an idiot.    Tell him that you KNOW how much money that it takes to care for the child and that you care for him all the time!    Part of being a parent is taking care of the kid's needs while they are visiting.  He's the father NOT the babysitter so he is responsible for food and whatever else the child needs while there.|`|AA10859291	Please do not think that I am being disrespectful towards you with my answer.  I am floored that your baby is allowed to go into this man's care!  Why on earth is it being encouraged for your ex to remove him from your supervision to visit with him???  If the description of your ex's behavior is accurate.............for God's sake WHY are you and your husband trusting him with your child's well-being?  I assume that the diet restrictions are so severe due to terrible complications your child has gone through.  Why'O'why would you hand his health-care over to a soul that can't even make his child a priority in his life to pay support or to even visit him on a regular basis.  In my opinion (which you are asking for), your ex should be allowed supervised visits with this baby(yep, he is still a "baby") ONLY.  Please reconsider the risk to your child's life that you are taking each time you allow this jerk to be in charge.  Your son deserves to have the best relationship he can with his dad, that is for sure.  But, your child is in danger every time you wave goodbye to him on these visits with this incompetent man.  Orchestrate regular supervised visits until your son can care for himself!  Best of luck to all of you.    HOLLY!  If your ex pays no support.....shows no interest...........and is asking you and your husband for $ in order to see his own child.........you need to ask for a judge to hear what is going on.............and petition for supervised visits.   This guy(your ex) is a nut and he should not be able to thinks he is calling the shots!  Not good for your son.  :(|`|mfpix8xkaa	Through being generous to your ex, the cretin is now taking advantage of you and your husband, How can it be a headache taking the loser to court. Take the dead beat to court until he has a headache. Do not let him take your precious son anywhere, he is not to be trusted. When you do get to court, inform the court, apart from his non custody payments, he expects all his sons needs to be met by you when your son visits him.  Stop being so generous, the cretin will get worse. Also inform him you have decided to let the court know, of his failure to be a father. One other thing, ask him if your husband can adopt your son, seeing your ex does`nt. provide for him. Then you can wipe your hands of him forever. it might just give him a jolt, and he could change, but don`t hold your breath|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You need to be in court fighting for back child support etc. And, while it might not hurt to send vitamins if you have them, he needs to provide nourishment for the kid. If he doesn't, that is neglect.|`|claW4UUcaa	wow what a douche bag! sorry but yeah....    i'd contact an attorney and see if you could get sole custody. your son is better off without him.|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	i think that is ridiculous. Plus he does not pay childsupport?? I dont think its your responsiblity. I think its his when he takes him. Your job is to just pack his bag with the necessary things he need and thats it. Everything else is his responsibility. when my daughter goes to spend time with her dad. I pack her clothes, toothbrush, hair things etc. Food and other things totally his responsibility.|`|ZGReKpK6aa	WOW, How disgusting is it that he sent your husband a letter of demands when HE is your sons father. Dont let this creep be around your son. He sounds too unreliable and irresponsible to take care of your son. If something ever happened to your son around this loser you will never forgive yourself.  That $65 will probably go straight into his wallet and he will most likely lie to you about spending it on your son. Why should you pay him anything when another man is being a REAL provider to your son! Dont let him hang around. Tell him that if he wants to see his son,he needs to pay child support for his own child. He will probably disappear as soon as he learns how much he owes. What a dad!|`|AA11825142	As far as the food there could be reasons, maybe he is scared he will buy something and your son will get sick... but it sounds like he doesn't want to use any of his money towards HIS son, I hate to say this but if I where you I just wouldn't allow the ex to take your child. He obviously has other priorities and you don't want to send your son over there feeling that he isn't wanted. I would be all over getting the child support under control your son deserves it.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Tell him your son is busy on the times that he wants to take him.  I want to know why you are not getting the support you deserve?  If he is working, make it happen!

Both have to be there.  But in the end we are socially trained (men) to cater to our women.

WA8feS8taa	If he's still married to her, then your marriage is invalid. That means the ceremony, the certificate that you had with him, none of that holds up in court, he is still legally her husband and not yours. I'm sorry about all this, I hope you're okay, he lied to you and that was wrong... you deserve so much better. You need to consult a lawyer about all of this, I suggest you do so. The person above me is right, he committed a crime, bigamy is against the law.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Best guess is your marriage is not valid. Bigamy is against the law and the marriage that has not been dissolved is upheld and recognized by the law.|`|FZLiRKIjaa	get a lawyer quick|`|5CGmDZ5Haa	he is a bigamist, and could get prosecuted for it...and yes, your marriage could be deemed not valid....dump his lying butt

OgT00dW4aa	Don't feel bad about saying NO!  If you let her stay, and she doesn't get along with your boyfriend, the only thing it's going to do is cause you a lot of unnecessary pain.  It's going to put TONS  of strain on both your relationships.  The one with your sister and the one with your boyfriend.|`|AA11401294	give her a phone book and tell her to call her baby's daddy|`|PwRNvAJmaa	No need to feel guilty. if she doesn't like your boyfriend then she has a cheek to ask to stay in your home, it will only cause problems and you will probably be unable to get rid of her.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Do not feel guilty.

Sounds like she plans on getting a little bit of a free ride???|`|0PkFuZMwaa	stick to your words.she doesn't like your man so why should she stay there that long.what she want him to move out until she leave. DON'T FEEL GUILTY.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're right to say no. Don't feel guilty at all. She just wants a free babysitter and maid. Let your mother help her.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Why feel guilty..she has a baby and need to learn to care for herself|`|xBd96wvRaa	Stick to your guns.  Don't forget she is pregnant as a result of her own actions.
fmNEhf3Qaa	If you have stopped loving her, but still care for your daughter, then go fight for the custody.Your gf can't be allowed to ruin a young child.  If you still love her, then at least drag her to sign the papers. You can be allowed arrange for the wedding some other time.  But if i were you, maybe i'll just be irresponsible and give both the mother and the child up. I would want a new life without that woman.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	I think you just wasted 15 years of your life with her.|`|qRuXJI2jaa	Take her to court and get custody. Your girlfriend is a lost cause....

Two people who are self estranged generally don't feel comfortable around each other.|`|5ELpGvMKaa	Happy hiram, you are not lose your ability to make a new friends.They just haven't know about you.

I was born after 1980 and I have a few friends in their late 40's whom I hang with quite regularly. When you meet great people age is of no option. Just relax, be yourself, and love yourself, and people of all ages will be drawn to  your positive energy.    Edit: Exactly what I was saying, before... you lump people into categories. Not all people in their 30's (and in my case 20's) need to be educated. Co-worker's offer an excellent source of new friendship. Also, I live in a very large city, so I meet people in all places. Bars, coffee houses, in the park, even on the bus. I love myself to death and I think I am awesome and people are drawn to that... At least I think so ;-)|`|IsMkhAJ5aa	i think ur problem is that u want a perfect friend and becasue u havent gotten one yet u are being picky. if u just be urself and just relax and not worry so much im sure it will be easier to make friends. try like going out to a bar and talking it up with guys over ur favorite sports and be honest. dont be afraid to get shut down either. ppl will be mean but then other ppl will be nice. i hope it works out. also sometimes its hard to relate to people becasue u dont want to. maybe ur life was harder or easier and u dont kno what to do or what they r feeling. im not rele sure just work on being social and find things that u like that other ppl like|`|VoJR0a2Eaa	Happy Hiram:    You need to join a club wherein you can have an interest in a hobby, sport, culture, antiques, dancing, boating, golfing, fishing, music, walking, etc.  Whatever will give you the most pleasure.    The primary objective should be to exercise your mind and/or you body and the other members should be secondary.....that way you can't lose.  The socializing should be easy as there would be a mutual interest which should bring about a meeting of the minds, at least on your chosen subject, and anything else would be a plus.    It might be even better if you joined two or three clubs and take it from there.  There is nothing better than a good selection to choose from!    Regarding age...     I once heard Jack Benny saying...  Age is a matter of mind over matter,  If you don's mind it does not matter.    Nothing great comes easy.  Everything has a price+  Once more into the breach.....

0EBt1k13aa	WOW. . . haha well ur obviously a role model to her. lol even though it may bug you its still what it is.    If it really starts to bug you to like hte point you wanna kill her then sit down and talk to her. Ask her why shes copying you. and stay calm like do it with only you and her and face to face not over messaging or anything.    Don't over react i know its annoying [trust me I KNOW] but honestly you shud be a little like hmmm whats the word ugh cant think of it like pleased or sumtin bcuz not everyday you have somebody who tries to be you.     And when you talk to her tell her its fine that she likes what you are like but that shes an awesome person too, only if she is who she really is and not try to be someone else|`|EhQyJE14aa	She obviously thinks how cool and awesome you are, and wants to be like you. It's flattering really.    If it's really bugging you, break it to her gently.|`|GtVJpgnUaa	yeah ;] i, frankly, do not know if i can relate that well to your problem -- so just saying i won't try to act like a "know-it-all" and act as if i had an experience like that. i've had somewhat the same where my best friend wanted to be a little like me, but just a little. i think she copies you because she likes you so much that she's jealous of you in a sense? first i would try to frankly talk to her and be honest, because trust me even though that sounds cheesy sometimes it REALLY works. but if it doesn't, then here's a trick but i do not know if it'll work. if she's acting like you, you try to act like her for a little bit. see her own reactions, and hopefully she'll feel in your place. but the reason i say try this only if talking doesn't work is because it could get her angry, and a fire would just burn stronger between you and her   i'm sorry if this didn't help. i'm trying my best! ^___^ but i wish you good luck.

People will judge no matter what.  If they weren't looking at skin color they'd be finding something else to talk about.    I have health problems that effect my physical appearance.  Sometimes it shocks me how insensitive people can be.  When I've talked to doctors about getting pain relief the conversation subject has changed to "how to make me look better in clothing."  One doctor even commented on the color of my clothing (he didn't like black).  The remarks about my clothing have nothing to do with health and I was only asking about pain relief.  The doctors said things about my appearance to me directly.  I don't think they ever thought I could be hurt or offended.  It's hard enough being a teenager and having your body change.  I learned at an early age that even health care professionals can be very judgmental.    I don't base anything on appearances and I actually enjoy doing the opposite of what people expect. It's fun to see people get confused when I don't follow their preconceived ideas. I am a woman and I hope to marry a man that's around 5 or 6 inches shorter than me. If you look at our physical appearances we are complete opposites (not only in height). I don't care what people think because he's my soul mate!    I am sure your fiancee is a wonderful woman!  Most modern countries are a melting pot and there a many ethnic backgrounds.  As I said if people weren't looking at skin color they'd be finding something else to talk about.  Some people get jealous of any happy relationship.  Good Luck!|`|	I can't believe people actually ask you if you feel safe!! I'm gob smacked at that.   I'm not racist in the slightest and work with alot of people from all over the world looking for a better life here, But at the moment there is alot of ill feeling towards anyone who isn't white, (and i'm not making excuses for it ) but with the bombings that have gone off and now in the news that some foreign workers are getting jobs over the british when people are loosing there jobs left right and centre, there is going to be ill feelings.

We don't live in a perfect world and there will ALWAYS be racism in ALL countries, and anyone who doesn't see that needs to take off those rose tinted specs,   Your missus really needs to get herself another job, i know there's not many going at the mo, but if she stays where she is she's just condoneing her managers actions.   Tell her to keep her chin up, hold her head high and be proud to be british, i mean come on how more british can you get, she got brought up in our care system and has turned out a decent person!

rywgn8HLaa	I like the idea of using amber for your color. I would do some research in regards to where your groom/groomsmen will be gettiing their tux. If the groom doesn't have a preference then you can call around to see if they have any vests/ties that will match the amber color.  Have you picked out the bridesmaid dresses yet? I would see if you can find bridesmaid dresses in a color that you like. A lot of bridesmaids designers carry burnt orange or bronze, but I'm not sure about amber.   Alfred Angelo has a color called Spice:  http://www.alfredangelo.com/Collections/...  Or burnt orange:  http://www.alfredangelo.com/Collections/...

You're 12-13 years old--much too young to be even considering such things.  I'm not leaving out the possibility that you may love him (I'm 15 and know very much so that I love my boyfriend), but it's not as if you're going to be with him the rest of your life.    How do you know his ethnicity was the real reason your parents told you two to break up?  Maybe they just think you're too young to be having a boyfriend, which is understandable.  Especially when you have such notions as marriage in your head.    Honestly, I think you should approach your parents and ask them why they disliked him so much.  Like I said, there could be other underlying issues they didn't mention before.  You have to talk to them about it.|`|KSsLV2thaa	Sweetheart, believe me when I tell you from personal experience, that you need to listen to your parents! You are only in the 7th grade, and much to young to be doing what you are doing! I know that at your age, things can be very confusing and frustrating. I have been there, and I have raised 2 kids. Listen to your parents. They seem to want what is best for you. And, the way you are handling things now is only going to cause trouble for you down the road. Work on your education, and have fun with your friends. Good luck, honey, and dump that guy! By the way, if he truly cared about you, would he be telling you or encouraging you to do the wrong thing? NO!!!|`|kPwHlu45aa	I know what you're going through, I'm going through the same thing, my parents hate my boyfriend since he's nothing but trouble, I mean what parents want their daughter dating a pot-head that's almost 15 in the 7th grade..hahahah..but parents are just trying to look out for you.   Not telling them isn't a good idea, but telling them isn't the best either..but I think you should tell them because you can't keep everything from them.   Your parents won't kick you out, I'm sure.  and I know what you mean on the double life thing, in-front of my parents I'm this little 13-year-old girl, that excels in school and never cuss's drinks, nothing, but away from them, I'm THE EXACT opposite, I do cuss, I do drink, I do everything I'm not supposed to...and my parents hate that I'm dating the drug-dealer of our town, but I could care less.  But what I'm getting at is, just Tell them, yeah they'll be mad, but if they want you to be happy they'll let you go out with him!!  Good Luck!    And I'm in 7th grade, too..and I'm in love and I've found the one, so your not alone!
b26NgqOFaa	Well I am not saying this is good advice but if it were me I'd sneak in somehow get rid of all the stuff. I mean I (personally) would probably break in or something.  Like at a time when I was supposed to be at work so it couldn't be pinned on me.  Or I would try to get your MIL on your side and have her throw it out.  And then she could say that she did it on accident- oops sorry.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	sounds like you married and self centered looser.

If divorce is not an option, then you don't have very many.  Life is too short to go through it miserable.  If you make the choice to stay with him, then you make a choice to be miserable and unhappy.  He isn't going to change, men rarely do.

He had boxes of letters and gifts from his exs. I do too. We don't necessarily do anything special for valentines day, maybe just a dinner or a stroll in the park or something. But I feel like I'm the happiest person on earth. You can be happy in the situation if you are still in love with him and if you have faith that this will all be good again in the future.    If you don't feel happy with him, and you have all these complaints about him, and you hate him, like the other person said above, there's only one option.|`|TtsEeJZqaa	Do you have a sister?|`|UNLrYNeUaa	stop blaming him, sit down like reasonable adults listen to each other without interruption, no marriage is perfect|`|E7RhMRKhaa	I wouldn't think a picture in a box should be such an issue.

It may be less the specific things that are upsetting him than it is that he needs emotional support on major things and you're complicating things with what seems to him to be trivia.    I say this because for years I was working long hours and under incredible stress trying to run my business and pay the bills and I would come home needing some emotional support from my wife and get greeted with some jealous accusations and nonsense and it really hurt me that all she could think about was her silly jealousies at a time when I really needed her to be there for me. I was battling the world and then I'd come home and have to battle her. It was too much.

Just be there to listen.  That's what you do, you listen. Offer to help her plant a tree in her yard in memory of her Dad. It is something that she can take care of and watch grow, or you could help her do something else in honor of her father, community service thing, something that her Dad would have liked and been proud to have had done in his name.|`|vBkGGYJSaa	all you can do is spend time with her when she wants to.  there may be times that she wants to be alone and at these times the best thing you can do is let her alone.  when she wants to talk then be there for her and listen and talk to her.  tell her that her dad loved her and wanted the best for her.  meaning that he would want her to be happy.  this will only come with time, you can not rush it.|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	Well you can show your support best by being there for her and her family.

See if you two can answer these questions about each other:  1. What's his/her middle name?  2. When is his/her birthday?  3. What is his/her mother's maiden name?  4. Where was he/she born?  5. What are the names and ages of his/her siblings?  6. How many children does he/she want to have?   7. What is his/her full address?  8. What is his/her boss' name?  9. Where do his/her grandparents live (both sets)?    If you can't answer all of these questions, you have no business getting engaged at all. And I have a sneaking suspicion you'd be lucky to answer one.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	I am sure this is not at all real. If it is, it's warped, and I cannot believe this could even be a consideration for you. wtf.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Not being rude...but you sound like a kid in this question.  You're 18 and you've known him for 2 weeks and he ask you to mary him?  Are you crazy? if you marry him..you're not only desperate but foolish.  Get focused, go to college and graduate.      DO NOT MARRY HIM. YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM 2 WEEKS IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO GET TO KNOW SOMEONE|`|B2HxSOGZaa	Personally, I don't think you should marry him, you hardly know him. He could be putting on a nice front because he wants you, but you don't know the real him. I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year and I am still constantly learning things about him.    This is your decision, but I would say no. Get to know each others personalities before you even think about getting serious.   Best of luck to the both of you!!|`|07640a4b87c92a2c4d16214824dddce8aa	your 18 i'm not going to judge you but is he serious about this ask him to wait so that you get a chance to know him properly, make him wait, if he loves you and wants to marry you then it should'nt be that hard, but lucky you my sister is 28 and never has had a guy propose, but don't rush into this i mean your only 18 live your life enjoy, have fun, do school, get what you want in life down first, if he's willing to stick around he will but you must be the perfect woman to get a guy to propose after 2wks go you :)|`|qfbDMVKKaa	Well, his line isn't as unique as he thinks it is. You sure he really wants to marry you or just try out the honeymoon.  Watch out for this guy, if he loves you, he will wait till you are ready.  I knew I wanted to marry my husband after the first date too.  We were engaged a year after and married within 2.  No rush..get to know the real person not the guy who trying to smooth talk you into something.    And, why did it take him 3 days to call you....think about it.|`|FExpdaBdaa	only you know how you feel.  If you both honestly love each other then go for it.  I know it seems soon to most people,  but true love can develop quickly.  Do you feel the same though, or would you just be leading him on?  There are questions only you can answer.  You can always get engaged,  doesn't mean you'll be married next week :)  xo|`|IUgkylWqaa	What a waste of time.... but thanks for the 2 points.|`|rywgn8HLaa	How old are you? You said that you have been friends for a while - but I don't know too many people who would consider 2 weeks a while. If you had been friends for 2 or 3 years then I would consider that a while, but certainly not two weeks. I personally wouldn't say  yes. I would tell him that I would like to go on another date and get to know each other - but after just knowing each other for 2 weeks and dating for 3 days you don't really know him. You have no idea what you are getting into. Take some time, get to know him and then decide if marriage is right for the two of you. Take things slow - if he loves you and wants to marry you then he isn't going anywhere...|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Maybe.  How old is he?  Baby mother's involved here? Future for College for You?|`|i41tUVtIaa	NO!!! This is not nearly enough time to know if you are ready.  It may be love at first sight for him and if it is he will wait.  I married after only knowing my husband for two months and honestly I wish I would have waited.  I was 25 at the time and just out of a divorce.  I probably still would have married him later but I wish I would have waited.  If you love him tell him you will marry him later like a year or so that will give you time to know if you are compatible.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	i'm sorry but for me thats a little strange, i would tell him that you would rather date and get to know each other a bit better than taking such a serious step, either that or say yes and have an extremely long engagement|`|sMUiGFPraa	You have a lot of growing up to do, i don't mean it in a nasty way, but you don't know this person and you are obviously not in love. If all you think is he is cute and nice then that should answer your question.|`|AA10621162	you're an idiot.|`|ibR6jJgHaa	ain't that stupid question?    completly|`|kw80YHMLaa	not unless u are a fool or just looking for trouble but thank you for an easy 2 points|`|lznoLTZCaa	Yeah, you should totally do it. Good luck with that.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Children playing adult games.  What could he possibly offer you? What do you have in skills and experience to bring into a marriage? Do you have a home? A job? And education, marriage is for adults in committed relationships.    Its because of people like you, that put a horrible image to marriages, and add to the number of yearly divorces.  If you want to be another statistic, go ahead.     But really, come on, why on earth would you ever consider this?  Hes cute? And really nice? Ugh, its so fustrating , your out of your mind woman.
Y3vfrf4Baa	what is the difference, my husband and i woke up next to each other on the morning of our wedding and well we have been married 3 years nearly - and still happy and have 2 kids. So well i feel that it is up to the couple actually but i dont feel that it is bad luck, my point is - if you are meant to be together, you seeing each other will not make a difference for your fate with each other.  But from a womans point of view i should imagine it does add that little bit more excitment into the day.|`|cc0e048495630741cf408149c1f4405daa	I think it's great and not because it's tradition. It makes it that much more special when the big day finally comes and you will be so glad that you did it. You will take his breath away!|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I like it.  We are not seeing each other the night before until the ceremony.  The suspense will be awesome.|`|STFQX45Gaa	i think its your own personal choice...Am gettin married in four months and me and my partner r spending the nyt before together..so we will wake up on r wedding day together..Then am going to my mums to get ready..that way he still wont c wot i look like in my dress until the actual ceremony..Am not one for tradition.I believe that if 2 people are meant to be together waking up togther on your wedding day isnt going to give you bad luck.|`|GgVufxlHaa	I think it's a very sweet tradition. My husband and I didn't see each other before our wedding, and both felt it was for the better. He is very sweet and an old fashioned romantic [aren't I lucky ;) ] and so we had our bridesmaids and groomsmen carry messages from each other back and forth, along with our gifts for each other. It was so sweet, and made our wedding day so much more special. Plus, I liked the shock of him seeing me in my dress for the first time when I waled down the aisle.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	We didn't follow this.....my husband and I had an evening ceremony with the reception immediately following.  I didn't want to miss any of the party, so we did all of our photos before the ceremony!  It was great!  and it didn't take anything away from seeing each other as I walked down the aisle!|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I think it is sweat.  I'm more concerned with him not seeing the dress.  He plans to spend the night before our wedding at a friends house as we live together.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	I like it, I think it adds that little extra 'oomf' in a wedding. Think about it if you haven't seen your significant other for a few days/weeks/months you get excited to see them again, now imagine it's been a day or so since you last saw them and you get to see your groom in a tux and he gets to see you in your wedding dress when those church doors open. Personally, I think it's romantic.|`|LWwGW48Daa	The groom should not see the bride and I like it!|`|LJkPRqN0aa	its traditional for the groom to see the bride and visa versa. just like it SHOULD be traditional for two people to save themselves til after marriage....but we all know how that goes down the drain these days... i guess im just more traditional than the next person....plus i think its cute.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	It is still a custom in India to some extend - the parents choose a partner for the son or daughter .It has advantages but as for me - no way my mother was a good woman but to choose a partner for me ?  Absolutely NOT.|`|u4liwDhAaa	It's just a tradition passed down through the years.   And, who started it to begin with?  LOL    You should do what feels comfortable to you.  (My husband and I saw each other before our wedding and we've been married for almost 29 years!)|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	It's a TRADITION. My god! Yes, people still do it. But I feel like, if you're having sex or living together before you're married, what does it matter? It's a tradition that has been occuring for hundreds of years. You make your own wedding though. If that's not something you want to do, then don't be traditional.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	I like it

Think about life in gaza. If you really want to do something good and fulfilling in life then go to gaza and become a charity worker and help do the funerals which the israelis and americans are responsible for.|`|JQIztxIlaa	Everyone feels like this. That is, they do until they do the exercise that I prescribe for them. This is for guys like you who don't really have a clue of what they actually want.    Go out on a sandy beach by the sea where you can be alone all day. Be there by 9 a.m. I'm gonna give you four things to do that day. These need to be put down on scraps of paper, but you must not see them before the time comes. So I'll give you four suggestions you should do that day starting at 9 a.m. and doing the four things in order at 9 a.m., 12 a.m., 15 a.m., and 18 a.m. while you are on that beach.    Now go get someone to write these down for you in separate scraps of paper so that you don't see them till that day. Ask him/her to give the pieces to you in the right order so that you can look at them just one at a time in the aforementioned hours. I'll write the reverse so that you don't look at them accidentally. Go get someone and STOP READING here!    1. ylluferac netsil, 2. rebmemer ot yrt, 3. citsaisuhtne uoy sekam tahw revocsid, 4. yrrow uoy sekam tathw dnas eht ni etirw|`|p3QdsbR1aa	A life is what you think of it.

I would suggest thinking of something that's always interested you but you just never got round to it.  Go do some research on it and actually try out the activity.  It really feels good when your around people that are interested in the same things as you.|`|xYisIAT5aa	if you stay home every night watching chick flicks or horror movies and sitting with your 5 cats, then you DO NOT have a life|`|LLmDQN7raa	This one lady had 18 kids.

He has just found the prospect of sex with another woman exciting  - but of course, it might lead to love of a sort too.    Some men will have an affair, then after a while (after the initial lust has worn off) decide his wife is the much better woman.  So he will then drop the other woman.    If this is happening to you, I suggest you confront him with it, ask him what he is playing at, and say you are not gonna put up with it. Push him into a corner and make him make a choice. You or her.  It might concentrate his mind, and make him realise which side his bread is buttered.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Dfid you take marriage vows?? do they mean anything come on you do know that whoever he's having sex with he is also bring it back to you have you been checked or STD's please where's your Pride in yourself he'd  been kicked to the curb long ago|`|gC8xO53Oaa	It may be just sex, but that doesn't make it right.

But if this was ever published i think it would be a delightful romance story to read, i dont think the rest of it had the "Hollywood" feel to it, very much real...besides the names xD but that probably has to do with the story more. Hopefully i helped...even if im not married...but i am in a relationship?? Though to adults 15 yearolds are more like puppy love...but whatever :) Im writing a story right now too, and it is hard not to do that "hollywood" feel.    Goodluck on the rest :)

Or starting to.. My boyfriend is currently away for business and has been for the past 6 months. I visited him 2 months ago, and I stayed with him for a month and a half. When we were not living together, we were on eachother like every opportunity we got. The sex was great. But during that stay with him, we rarely had sex. And when we did, it wasn't very great.    His explanation to me was, because I was with him 24/7, we see eachother all the time, and because I was a visitor (I had no friends no family no job there, i was just all alone with him), we didn't have any personal space at all. He said the sex was too accessible and therefore we didn't do it that much. He once mentioned that he wanted to watch porn but didn't want to when he knew i was outside....    I guess it's either he's cheating, or it's the issue with personal space.....

AA11955868	Well you're both obviously biased. They're both stupid programs but that's not the point. You both get entertainment value out of them so what difference does it make?    Maybe he's just uncomfortable because he likes the men in tights. You should probably accuse him of being gay. That always helps things.|`|i7rYRvlTaa	thats immature.  you shouldnt care what he says.|`|MhW3pLhLaa	you are both obviously biased.

di6p10Ifaa	I absolutely love this gown. It reminds me a whole lot of my gown. In my opinion almost any woman could get by with this style because it "creates" a perfect hour glass figure, or atleast my gown does that is very similar. I think she will look gorgeous in this gown. I don't weigh 130lbs but I do have a great hour glass figure especially when i have my gown on! It is stunning she should go for it!! It has a "southern belle" look to me.    P.s. I would go with the salmon and another color. Afterall it is her second wedding and it seems like everyone and their dog is doing the white and red gowns these days. Best of wishes!|`|9rC0xd1qaa	Wow!  That dress is beautiful!  My colors are navy blue with silver and pink but I have always been fond of pink and brown and green with brown.  You could really do anything with this dress.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	Sorry, I actually don't like the dress at all.  And its definitely not right for a 2nd wedding. Don't like the huge bow and the ruching and the pickups.   For colors, I like red and white. Very classy and easy to find & do.|`|mXIVMmPSaa	The dress is so-so, I'm not a huge fan of the "cupcake dresses" with the pick-up skirts, but that's just my preference. But it really comes off as a "young" style, like what I imagine a 19-year old blonde Texan wearing at her princess and butterfly themed wedding. Not what I'd recommend for a woman in her mid 30s- 40s at her second wedding. No offense, but I think it'd be really inappropriate for your mom to wear. It used to be customary for divorced women who remarried to just wear a simple matching skirt and jacket suit, not even a real "wedding dress" at all. Of course, things have changed but people still tend to dress down a bit for their second wedding, especially if they are older.   How about something a little less flashy/ sexy, a little more understated and grown-up? Here's some suggestions of slightly more appropriate dresses from the same collection:  http://www.alfredsungbridals.com/styleht...  http://www.alfredsungbridals.com/styleht...  http://www.alfredsungbridals.com/styleht...  http://www.alfredsungbridals.com/styleht...|`|4POGapREaa	OMG that dress is gorgeous!!  I don't even like big gowns but that's just stunning!!  130 lbs though?  Who knows?  Is she 5'2" or 5'10"?  I would go with the salmon instead of the red.  I'm just not a fan of red in general & I think something a little softer would be perfect with that.
CZFcH1ykaa	I don't think so, if she were your true bff then even if she were mad at you she would tell you and not ignore you. She also would not befriend all your enemies.  Find a new friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ftSsVFQNaa	Well they are probably just worried about your age. They are probably scared it won't work. I got the same feeling from my in laws before we got married. I think more then anything they were scared he was gonna get hurt. Scared that he was taking on to much getting married. My husband was 27 with his masters when I married him. Anyway parents are always parents. I married him anyway and I just continued to be nice. We had a few rocky years. It was very uncomfortable. I just kept being nice though. Don't let them get to you because, it can mess up your marriage if you let it bother you to much. Well after about four years they realized our marriage was gonna work. Also the fact that I just kept being nice to them and all their family. I was finally excepted as one of them and now they treat me as family. I think the main thing with you and your boyfriend is they are scared of your age and that the two of you will get hurt. Just give it time and don't worry about it or rush it this is one of those things that will work itself out as time goes on. You have to understand if they are in their 50's and they look old to you then you and your boyfriend look like babies to them. So they are probably really scared you are gonna make a mistake. Good luck and be strong.    Love,  MIchelle|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	next time you see them, get them gifts. the would be so happy. and maybe spends some time to get to know them. you might be wrong they might really like you. :)|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Maybe you guys should all go do something fun together!

Best Wishes|`|9e20cabaf1ecf0acafc3c11e5cd3f3d0aa	Just be yourself. Don't change once you marry there son. I have a sister in law, that we loved when she first starting seeing my brother, then the real her came out about a year and half later. she was a total ***** and took him compeltly away from family. always be open with them dont hide stuff from them, and when you have babies, make sure his parents get to see alot of them and not just your parents. I say that because most of the time the wifes parents and family gets to see the kids... maybe your just to worried about it, maybe they really do like you and your just a little nervous still with them... idk. my best advice is to always act yourself.
GgVufxlHaa	I don't think it's too soon at all. You have life plans and goals, know what you want, and if you're ready to settle down with this person, then go for it. If you think you're ready, then you probably are.     I was married when I was 20, and don't regret a thing about it. I knew I wasn't going to spend my life with anyone other than my husband, and I didn't really want to wait. I didn't really see the point in putting it off if there wasn't going to be anyone else. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, and do it as soon as possible.     Even if you haven't gotten much support from your family and friends, you seem very level-headed, and they should respect what you and your boyfriend want. If you've both decided that this is what you want, don't let anything stop you.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	If your ready now is a good time to start a 1 or 1 1/2 year engagement.  If your not ready ... wait.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Engaged? No.    Actually married? Yes.|`|819ad8842ebdf96b383c9430aef4be6eaa	You might want to wait longer.  What is the rush?  Get to know each other really well first.  Maybe pick up one of Dr. Phil's books.  Just because your parents and his parents married young and are still together doesn't mean you will be so lucky.|`|8g51eBf1aa	I don't think so. You're old enough, and you've been dating for a year. So why not? Who cares if family & friends don't like it, they still have to buy you presents for your wedding!! :)|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Honestly, no it isn't too soon. If you are both ready to settle down then a long engagement will be suitable and fine. When I was graduating from college several of my classmates were engaged, some were engaged our Jr. year, which would be around 21 yrs old. Maybe it's a southern thing, but it's very typical for young couples to get engaged around graduation or 22 and married either after graduate school or the next fall after graduation. So fine go ahead with the engagement, take your time, and pace things. An engagement is another level of your relationship, but you don't have to rush to marriage. If you guys know you will have a long engagement, which by the way, many people have year long engagements as a min. , go for it.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Well I guess you can always get engaged if you want too. Not many people make it that get married at that age. They used to in my parents time but, not now. Anyway with that being said I noticed you said you plan on a long engagement. That is great especially because of your age. I think if I were you if you really love this guy and think you want to spend the rest of your life together and he feels the same. If you want to get engaged do it but, don't set the date until after you graduate from your four year education. That could be your graduation present to yourself. If the two of you are still together and are as in love as you are now. I think if you get married then things will work. You should always finish your education first because, if you don't so many people end up having to quit. You know because, of money usually. Anyway I wish you the best of luck.     Love,  Michelle|`|YeeYx1XIaa	In my opinion you should wait to get engaged until you have your life in order... graduate college, get a steady job, etc. Maybe try living together before getting engaged
OtqB24NVaa	Its not your problem honey! There having trouble and its easy to take it out on whoever is around, and you happen to be that person. Its not right or fair.

Let them know|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	talk to a counselor. i had kind of the same problem. do you know god. if not pick up a bible. that helped me so much. it still helps me. pray about it to.|`|YDBewAJvaa	have a family meeting. i know it sounds corny but it will make things better:)               Good Luck!|`|K2QwEM4raa	Probably not much, but try to lay as low as possible. It is probably not you that is the problem,  it is their marriage or their money problems. They will have to solve it themselves.  Best of luck to you.|`|J6KraUzUaa	well... the important thing is that for you to understand is that nothing is your fault.   your dad obviously isn't the calm person and has issues.   If I were you I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. It's a normal reaction of someone going blastic on you.   as for what you could do? I  don't really know though maybe you should try to avoid him like how you are doing until you get to an age where you could leave.   or maybe you could talk to someone you know about your dad.|`|xQAcYIB9aa	My Mom went through that phase too, and she will never forgive herself for it. Parents are a tough thing to handle, even though they think it's the opposite way around. You are not doing ANYTHING wrong. Your Father is likely very stressed because of his work, or even his relationship with the rest of your family. They could not be getting along, and somehow they are taking it out on you. Just like you need an outlet-- such as hanging out with friends, listening to music, or whatever you love to do-- parents need an outlet, too. Right now he probably has no outlet that is calming his nerves. Try and keep your distance away from him and know that it isn't you, but it is him.     I am sorry you have to go through that. You are so mature for your age, don't let someone else's negativity hold you back.|`|sy8JaNYmaa	you could try talking to a teacher at school or a friend
lEY4zGM7aa	You gotta find out if she likes you enough to go out with you... I think your story is very sweet but you gotta make it more powerfull and the day you see her (do not text her) you tell her straight up that your feeling her and you want to be with her... Tell her sweet things like I liked you day we became friends and stuff like that stuff sweet that will charm her into getting her to go out with you because if you eally like that's what your gonna have to do... Goodluck:)    
3CVPeDqxaa	well don't give up on being her friend, just tell the girl to knock it off every time she does it.    and then go sit somewhere else.    tell her when she's bothering you. ask her what she means everytime she does it, don't be afraid to argue respectively.    then go out for ice cream so she still knows you enjoy her company! =p|`|i0gIMwXAaa	i think you should talk to her, and i mean really talk to her.  tell her what's bothering you and tell her how you feel about the stuff she does.    hope i helped.  (:
KFJJzLmTaa	don't talk to him either. people change over the year. maybe he has a girlfriend now and maybe isnt comfortable around other girls. maybe he does think u do like him.
0d1ab34e7d8e6be1528a2d3ee4038e39aa	An elegantly wrapped chocolate truffle might be a great idea.  You can get advice on wedding favors at http://www.sandiego-romantics.com/weddin...|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I like something useful. It's perfectly ok if it's not edible since lots of times what is edible to some isn't to all (like salt water taffy ugh!) but it is definitely not cheap. No one expects their favors to be expensive. They can look around and tell that there are 250 people there.    Favors I've loved  Cookies, chocolate  Pens  Matchbooks  Candles  Christmas ornament    Favors I've Hated  Something monogrammed with the bride and grooms name  little tiny note pads  A magnet with the couple's picture  a small picture frame  a metal bucket with taffy in it    Favors I thought were take it or leave it  handmade items like handmade soap  kitschy like a roaster, pot holder, or fake flower  can coozies (personally my husband loves them but in general I noticed a lot of people left them)  pack of wildflower seeds    something you don't even get at all like a star or a donation to charity. umm great.  Most of your guests aren't close enough to want a picture of you in their house and those little picture frames look so cheap.    Edible is always nice and you usually get people willing to take the majority of them so you aren't stuck with hundreds of leftovers. Especially if you have different things. I gave away candles and most people loved them. I had multiple choices though of scents and colors so you could pick whichever candle fit your decor best. Just don't go with almonds. It's so overdone and does anyone actually like them?|`|4POGapREaa	A small shabby chic picture frame?|`|KifasiMraa	my friend had cookie cutters in fun shapes and tied (well, I tied) a cookie recipe to each one using ribbons in her colors (pink and green).|`|G1boIrFuaa	Something edible.

My suggestion is fans -   I had my wedding in July, and I found some nice fans online.  They were simple, but I added my own touch to them to give them the personal effect, and to fancy them up a bit.    I took the fans, and had thin cloth like ribbon and tied tiny bows at the topside of each wooden part of the fan.  Then, tied a few long pieces at the bottom, so they were dangling down.  I then made little one inch notes that said "We are happy you were able to share in this special day with us, thank you! With Love, Kelly & CJ"      The fans were practical because it was very warm that day, they were handed out as people entered the church.  That made it nice because we didn't have to clutter our reception tables with a favor.    Hope that helped!  Heres a link to the site: (I used the pack of 100 whtie fans for 60 bucks)    http://www.japanesegifts.com/search.php?...

For the non-drinkers make it sparking soda. This may get pricey depending on your guest list. Maybe wine glasses (same monogrammed idea). Nice clear/crystal flower pots with a flower (blue/green) in bloom.|`|V4dinhMfaa	I hope this link helps.

3WQOa4sraa	I am starting to go wedding dress shopping now, I am getting married next year (2010) I am sticking to one of those count down to wedding planning calender, it prevents stress closer to the time and you will find that time flies    for now I would concentrate on booking a reception, the earlier you book it the better i.e. your date, before the year prices rise etc     but if your like me and cant stay away from wedding dresses; I have fallen in love with the following ranges;    Mikaella  Paloma blanca  Ellis  watters  Alfred sung  Ian Stewart   Sophia Tolli  Sassi Hotford  Justin Alexander    There are more but I cant think;    I have chosen to visit 6 bridal stores this year making sure I cover these favorite ranges of mine - this took time    good luck|`|Bt3857hxaa	Order a dress from the United States. They have the best dress in New York Fashion and also Hawaii|`|AA11991351	Hiya, i`m getting married next year and have sort of started looking just now, more the styles and shapes and stuff.I think its around 6 months before your wedding you should have a look but then i read somewhere else that you should start to seriously shop for it around 10 months before.    try looking on www.confetti.co.uk, they have allsorts of stuff on there and theres a list of designers and their collections.    xx|`|b1xQKDEraa	mon cheri are good, just type in wedding dresses on a search engine. yahoo.co.uk will find uk websites. you could start looking 12 months before the wedding. try www.weddingsday.com, this will give you step by step guide on time frames etc|`|UKhLLFOMaa	Have a look at http://www.weddingdressplace.com    They highlight some of the best designers and the deals are good if you don't mind buying online.
8XKmMBU7aa	I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	he might just not want to talk to you anymore  or have a girlfriend or something.|`|v6s30PHXaa	maybe he has a girl friend now? idk...guys are jerks|`|pemGyfnwaa	Maybe his girlfriend is jealous. Be careful, she could be after you!|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Maybe he has a girlfriend now, and is afraid she might get jealous.  Or maybe he wanted to more than friends, and once realized or thought it wasn't going to be anything more, he decided not to engage in conversation anymore. Not saying that's right, just naming off some things that could be going on.|`|7iMfRDNbaa	I don't know, I'm in this situation too. Kinda.   He signs in but he doesn't speak much, or when he does he's off. It kinda sucks, but that's life. I have plenty of "real-life" friends that are more than enough! Last time we were talking and he was weird I told him to message me next time he wants to talk. He hasn't, so I guess that's it.    That said, your guys msn might just be broken. :)
xWie9Zavaa	I disagree with David. All vagina's are not created equal! If she needs to do something to clean it up, or make it more attractive then she should if she wants men to pay attention to it. Give it a trim, or shave it. A little heart shaped tattoo on her inner thigh would dress it up. And for God's sake, make sure it's clean, with a cute sexy little pantie covering it up.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Tell your friend to stay out of chat rooms and blogs. And pull her facebook/myspace account too. They're havens for bad folks.    And tell her to be careful about photographs - they will come back to haunt.    As for her thinking how ugly her vagina is - well, a good therapist might help. But there's nothing you can do for that - unless you're physically attracted to her too.    As for you - get better friends. Both of them sound like they haven't any more sense than a box of rocks.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Live and learn. You don't take pictures of things you don't want other people to see. The boyfriend was wrong, and it give you a good idea of his character. Your friend will just have to ride it out. People can be mean, so take their comments with a grain of salt.|`|21TogLbJaa	the  poor girl he is a pig  get back on the horse if you know what i mean the thing is that all woman have the same equipment so we are all ugly if that is the case and as for him he is ugly for doing that to her|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	I know this is going to sound sexist, but I never met a vagina I didn't like.    There is no such thing as a pretty or ugly vagina. They are all made of the same material. Clitoris, Labia majora and Labia minora. There are 8,000 nerve endings on the head of the clitoris.    Also, if the picture is of only her vagina and nothing else, then she shouldn't worry about it. For all she knows it could be his sisters vagina he's putting on the internet.    Tell her to take a deep breath and move on.
oY4vwdjVaa	Lets just say that my father has been in jail since I was 13 and will never ever get out.    As for my mother - she was a prostitute. She gave birth to me in my dads house and left. Never met her. I don't even have a birth certificate. I was just kept in the basement as a toy.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	My best friend (aged 42 now) was brought up by alcoholic parents. Both were actually alcoholics. She seems haunted and bitter that they were always drunk and had little time for her and her older brother. Often her Mother apparently physically and verbally abused her and embarrassed her in front of school friends. The Father left when she was 8. That had a huge impact on her.  My mate stated she was practically brought up by her brother as her Mother became worse when the dad left them.  Sadly her mother died of alcoholism aged just 62.    My friend today admits to feeling hurt and traumatised by her upbringing and her mothers death.|`|zKc66WSXaa	Yes, my father has always had a big problem with alcohol. He rarely gets physical but is very emotionally diminishing. Our relationship has always been this way because he drinks, quite literally, all day long. I've never seen him sober before. I love him to death, but it makes it hard to get a real bond with him. When I was much younger, like 7 years old, I thought alcoholism was normal. I only recently found out he had a problem, because somebody pointed it out. It's a horrible thing for a parent to do, let their child believe nothing is different about drinking beer all day long, one after the other. There is really nothing for alcoholics who wont change to do, especially ones who won't admit its a problem. I'm sorry you have to go through this too, and I hope you stay happy through it.|`|CLpjFB82aa	Yes.. Both of my parents are alcholics, my Mother just recently died from it.. and I haven't seen my Father in almost 2 years. When I did live with him though it was awful he would come home being so drunk he used to hit my Mother and Brother.. for the longest time I never said anything because I was so young and extremely scared, but I finally stood up to my father once and he hit me for it... He sexually abused me until he was finally arrested and put in jail.. Luckily I haven't seen him for almost 2 years now.. I am very sorry for what you are going through. I wish I could tell you that things got better for my family but they didn't.... My Mother is dead. Father in Jail... Brother also dead.. Don't worry I dont think your family will end up like mine.. Good Luck! I will be keeping YOU and your family in my thoughts and prayers..    Addie..|`|nz8o3lLSaa	My advice to you is to never ever ever touch alcohol your entire life.  You might have inherited his genes in that respect.  Do what you have to do to get by, but he is a lost cause.
b1NRf4VCaa	yes|`|GtVJpgnUaa	dude. the fact that people call you gay for tryin to hang out with guys is gay. XD im a girl & i hang out with girls. thats not called gay. dude guys usually do hangout with guys. ;) i mean you hang out with whoever you wanna. it's your choice. maybe you're overfriendly? in a sense? 8D that happens to me. i get overfriendly with people. but i mean its stupid how they call you gay for trying to make friends with guys. i never heard of that before. it's your call on this one. if you wanna hang out with girls then go ahead and do so. or if you wanna have more friends who are guys try AGAIN but try in a less sociable way?   8D would say can be EMAIL pals but once again im a girl XD tough luck. ;)   but dude , your call on this one. i mean i have friends who are guys & girls. im not considered gay , or whatever. if you WANT friends who are girls then go for it all the way! if you want friends who are guys try again, i mean i bet those guys have friends who are guys. maybe it's just your approach on making friends. maybe there's a difference in approaching girls and guys when becoming friends and you're used to girls? that may not be true, just a suggestion.  GOOD LUCK ALL THE WAY 
KifasiMraa	I was MOH for my best friend a few months ago and I learned A LOT about weddings and what's expected.    First of all, I think a wedding shower and bridal shower are the same thing.  A bride may have multiple showers.  The bridesmaids are supposed to host the official shower, but other people may choose to throw one too (like work colleagues or other groups of people she's close to outside of her bridal party). *an important side note* do NOT invite anyone to the shower who is not also invited to the wedding!    For each shower you go to, you should bring a gift. It's very popular for the bridesmaids to all chip in and get a group gift.  This is perfectly acceptable.     You don't usually have to bring gifts to the bachelorette party, but you do have to pay for anything the brides does (dinner, drinks, strippers, whatever).  If you do choose to go the gift route, keep in mind that generally, bachelorette party gifts are funny and even sex-themed (like vibrators, books about sex positions, penis shaped items etc.)  Spencer's has all sort of these things.  They even have a line of bachelorette party decorations.     You are also expected to bring a gift to the wedding (again, it can be a groups gift)      Gifts at the showers and wedding should be things the bride AND groom can enjoy in their new life together. This can include kitchen stuff, lingerie, linens, china...they should have a registry that you can purchase from.  That way they get the things they want. So get something both of them will like. Also, the wedding gift should be the one you spend the most money on.      There are lots of books about wedding/bridesmaid etiquette.  They have whole wedding sections at places like Borders and Barnes and Noble. Go check 'em out.|`|8g51eBf1aa	You and the MOH w/the other BM's are suppose to throw the bride a shower. You need to either throw her a shower (as a gift) or bring one to the shower. Also, a wedding gift for the bride & groom, which you usually bring to the reception. And you spend more money one the wedding present than the bridal shower present.|`|rI7J9M8taa	I would bring a gift to the shower that the MOH is organizing.  And if you are throwing the bride another shower at work, you are probably already spending money on invitations, decorations, shower games and food.  A gift from you should be optional.  Spend about twice as much on the wedding gift as you would for the shower gift.    http://www.beautiful-bridal.com/|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	2|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I thought wedding and bridal shower were the same thing.  One gift for that.  no gift for girls night out.  spend the most on the wedding gift.
bMzEkfjMaa	my advice to you is to stay out of it..ive had nothing but trouble with family quabbles and have learned valuable lessons.. family arguements can ruin a lot of relationships and friendships.. and most of the time the people that get involved because they feel they have to end up being hurt the most..let your father and uncle work it out between them and just be there for them all esp. ur granny..
70792699b0148f1c86dfafe277533b54aa	you know what you better get out of there.  call the cops on her next time and get out because when her husband catches you guys she'll make some cr*p up about how you raped her or something|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	2 words:  chain lock    2 more words: restraining order    even 2 more words: video camera|`|yv3unx5Eaa	Wait until she passes out and put her in your bed. When she wakes up, make her breakfast in bed. That should scare her enough to leave and never come back.|`|hVY2AWEbaa	LOCK YOUR DOOR.|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	put the dresser or the bed against the door or something lol    or hide when she comes in, she'l see your gone and leave maybe. or fall asleep on your bed =/|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Change the lock & don't answer. If a problem comes of it, tell her husband (wait to respond to him only) some hammered woman kept letting herself in w/ a key.. Then let the sentence drift off as you give him a pointed look w/ a raised eyebrow & shrug, walk away. If he doesn't get the message (since probably only they have keys)...well, no wonder she drinks if he's that clueless. lol    Answer the door wearing lipstick & holding a chainsaw w/ a goofy grin.     Get a female friend to stay over & when she comes, you both answer the door w/ hair tussled & half dressed while giggling naughtily.    Put a 'Do Not Disturb ~ goldfish mating season & goldfish lovefest in progress' sign on the door.     Put a rigged can of paint over the door so it falls on her head when she comes in. Or maybe dirty toilet water or something.    Answer the door in a Batnman costume while singing "Nanananana....BATMAN!!!...Sorry, would love to chat, but I'm late TO THE BATCAVE!" Then take off running flapping your cape.     Call the cops, you do have renters rights you know & I believe in every state a landlord CANNOT enter your dwelling w/ out permission or else an emergency. And you can fight that & you will win!      If worse comes to worse & you can't beat 'em...join 'em! lol Call over more friends & get a game of Beer Pong going! Whoo~hoo! YOu can't get in trouble for a party, afterall, landlord is already there drunk! lol     Or tell her husband on the side what has been going on, but you weren't sure what to do. Tell him not to say anything, just to catch her. Maybe a camera or if this is happening while he sleeps, tell him to fake it & then get up & come over when she leaves. Or maybe she waits until he is drunk & passed out. Might be differernt if she was hot, hmm? ;p j/k    Good luck, she sounds annoying as all h3ll though.|`|AA11706291	Get a dead lock fitted or a chain.|`|AA10305048	Change the locks.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Call her husband and tell him make her stop.|`|5oJYzjotaa	She doesn't leave when you ask her to? You don't have a chain lock or something on your door?  Confront her about it while she's sober and if it continues talk to her husband about it.|`|AA11955868	Bahahaha. That's incredibly funny.    Add one of those little cheap dead bolts to your door. Or just shift something heavy in front of your door. She's drunk, how hard is it to confuse her?|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	pray that she get struck by lightning LMAO|`|CKDpbgQWaa	You need to tell her husband about this, and also you need to tell her - when she's sober - that she is not to come to your apartment.  You need to make it clear that if she does, you will call the police and have her charged.    Her husband isn't waking up when she's doing this?  Does he know what she's up to?    For your sake - you need to find a way to stop this from going on.  What if she hurts herself - intentionally or other - while in your place? Are you then responsible for the outcome, because you didn't stop her?  You need to protect yourself until you can get out of there...talking to the husband first, rather than the cops, is the best first step you can make.  Putting a chain on the door, or one of those little alarms that operates on a battery might help too.  Won't keep her out but will make her prowling less secretive, and therefore, less appealing.|`|024Pu2XRaa	bang her in a bad way. punish her so she won't even think about coming back. abuse it.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I'm sorry to say that this is pretty funny. I dont' think you shoul talk to the husband about it. Just change the locks and talk to her about it when she's sober. You wouldn't want to get involved in their marital problems.|`|eArLd5taaa	Just ignore her and lock ya doors...|`|Jwzq6NAZaa	Dude, get a chain lock!|`|DsIQMgfraa	WOOOOOOOOOOW!!!|`|rKY4o3Adaa	Give her all that she desires and then maybe she will leave.|`|GHgptLAsaa	I would let her husband know what was going on and then i would buy another lock or something so she wouldnt be able to get in :)|`|44mmJ14Caa	LOL!!! UMMM...MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER HUSBAND AND TELL HIM WHAT HE IS LACKING....OR TELL HER WHEN SHE IS SOBER WHAT SHES DOIN' IT MAY EMBARRASS HER AND SHE WONT WANT TO DRINK AS MUCH...IDK
1MLIYilNaa	Human friends? No lol|`|EhQyJE14aa	They've never asked. I don't think they go on it. At least, I don't think they do. It would be funny if I met them online..|`|K4DBU7cuaa	they never ask. I would tell them when they ask what did you do this weekend|`|mzkfSwLwaa	haha nope.. when they ask ill tell them|`|MdXwD2JSaa	My boyfriend does.  I don't really have any other friends.|`|Ky60icf3aa	haha, no, not yet. (:
8XKmMBU7aa	OMG, I'm really sorry please.  If your age less than 80 than you may find new husband.  Divorce him fast, no need to think more.  You are only unlucky lady in whole the world please.  Look your locality, Is there any other girl like you.  OMG  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Are these business trips? He may be tired and under a lot of stress. maybe you should just give him his space when he's doing that.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	you might try learning to spell, get a job and leave the jerk you KNOW you should have left already.|`|87WOSjwgaa	My guess would be is that he is having an affair! Confront him about it!|`|WAEDIWz8aa	i think u should hire a detective...    i dont want to say it, but i have to.. i think he is cheating on you.    so why dont u be sure and hire asomeone to see exactly what hes up to?? this is not normal.|`|r1KTZBkraa	maybe he is cheating on you and putting on a show for his lover when you call and that is why he is being so mean|`|0QRDC2R1aa	Girl, serious.....he's f*ck*n' around.  He can't answer the phone cause he's knee deep in some other woman.  And when he does answer and is rude....its because she's right there........If you can't divorce him, then make his life miserable.|`|024Pu2XRaa	He's cheating on you.|`|DuSvfGDLaa	he might be cheating on you or you might just be ruining his relaxation|`|ESKslyfsaa	Do the same to him.  Get away with your friends and have a great time.|`|CFSfyXCbaa	You do the same when he tries to call you, so that he will know how much u suffered when he dont get respond|`|a42c0cbe296fc23ce84147b6dbb01a72aa	I think he like to go trip with someone else and he do not want to be disturb.  Get private detective ASAP|`|AA10381339	I dont want to put thoughts in your head but it would make me wonder if your cramping his style. Hes either very busy, doesnt want u checking up on him as a jealous wife or he is with someone else. What else could it be? Have you guys discussed this? What is his excuse? If its lame, time to start thinking of plan B. I didnt want to go there but you got to look out for yourself too!! Hope it works out for u.|`|AA11678629	HE IS CHEATING ON YOU AND MAYBE HE'S EVEN TAKING THE OTHER GIRL WITH HIM WHEN HE GOES AWAY. MAYBE YOU SHOULD INSIST THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY MORE VACATIONS WITH OUT YOU. MARRIED PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING SINGLE VACATIONS ANYWAY. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS UP. I WOUL'D NOT HAVE LET IT GO THIS FAR.|`|ZUCkh7dmaa	Could be two reasons  1) He's cheating on you  2) He misses you|`|gypWPBvLaa	well im not married never been not even close to the age but he might be with his friends there and he wants to just hang out with them and not have interruptions but that's just a 14 year olds view which doesn't matter to a lot of people|`|WA8feS8taa	First of all, you guys have a young baby, if he's taking vacations then you, your baby and he should all be going together. The fact that he's taking trips on his own, is weird in itself. Also, him acting up like that when you call him is wrong, he's supposed to be calling you and checking in with you and your son. I think you need to talk to him about it and tell him you don't feel good that when you call him, he answers as though he wishes you didn't call. Let him know it hurts you, tell him how you feel.|`|AA10711210	When he's actually with you, have you tried sitting him down and asking WHY he's so objectionable when he's not with you?|`|CXOqnMM9aa	Maybe you're checking on him too much, my boyfriend was first flattered and felt good that I was concerned about where he was or what he was doing, but then he got a bit ticked off that I kept calling him so much during work and all, and would be the same.  I guess try not to contact him for a  week or so when he's gone, it's hard but try to take your mind on other things, such as your baby.  My boyfriend got pretty surprised and even called me back being all sweet and concerned when I ignored him for a week.  If that doesn't work, just leave him alone, he's probably a workaholic.|`|e75a99c9cdf483e5829a4a39a532ff66aa	Well, I would have to say that there is no resolution.  I can understand why you see him as a jerk, but I can understand where he is coming from as well.  One of the things I most enjoy is solitude and independence.....and am assuming that your husband does as well.  This is something that is hard to explain to a significant other because they cannot see it for anything but an insult.  They seem to think that it means that we do not care for them or that we do not want to be around them or something.  Or, maybe you don't trust what he is doing when you are not around.....this is quite natural as males do tend to have a harder time sticking to the rules of a modern day relationship.  The truth is, he probably just wants to be by himself and when you call him it's of course very irritating.  I am speaking from my own experiences of course.
xNkmK0SHaa	"meaning he wants absolutely nothing to do with me"    He only wants something to do with you if you give him everything he wants, when he wants it, and where he wants it.    You are well rid of such a narcissistic manipulator.    You can do better - and you will.    Please don't EVER apologize for setting and enforcing your personal boundaries.  No male is worth compromising the essence of you.|`|cDubFtwlaa	unless u or him are unattractive ur a lesbo but if ur unattractive be lucky u had a chance to get some|`|e6ec83ddcbe49ce178aa921f9c51a662aa	mmmhh,   i would say, he is being unreasonable.you shouldnt  even have apologised, he is the one who should have apologised, how can he just stuff his hands in your bra, thats so disgusting, he should learn the difference between just a friend and his girlfriend, if you know what i mean.  or maybe:-he has been having a crush on you and was trying his chances  but you are not ready to have a relationship with him and want to keep the friendship you guys had from childhood|`|mxVq4mOeaa	there are two sides to this.. yours and his... sometimes we don't understand each other that good.. lol.  so i think on his point of View...  i think he got upset when you told him to stop because you have known him for a while and he didn't think it was that bad..... or something. guys are CONFUSING!    and you point fo view   you don't want him doing this it was disrespectful! and he has no right to go there! and he shouldn't get mad or over react at you like that because he has no right. like what makes him think he can touch you there!?!?! were you leading him on or something?   well i think he is a jerk. and your not being sensitive.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Didn't you hear that song when you were little about'my body is my body"? Let's put it this way, if the guy next door did that to your mom would she kill him? Of course. It is illegal & immoral. He is wrong. BIG wrong. I don't know why you would make an apology. Do not ever let a guy touch you in a way that you are not comfortable with.  I think you should tell your mother. If he would do this to you, he will do it to another girl.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	He was an ***.  Find a better friend.  And you had no reason to be sorry to get mad.  Makes sure he knows that.  He definitely sounds like future date rape material ('I didn't think she really meant No').    You are better off without a person like that.  He disrespected you and is not a friend.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	No, for him not to want to talk to you anymore because you got offended because he touched you is completely wrong.  He's a douche, honey.  Forget about him.
b1NRf4VCaa	well u ca alway,s play with them.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	Watch a really funny movie, nothing makes people break out of the shell like laughter.|`|g9DWi0DKaa	ask them 2 recomend some games and game console they will be talking all nite u may be bored it will keep them occupied
AA10289805	Do the following:    1. Make a list of everything you DISLIKE about your ex, and post it in your bathroom or somewhere close so you can read it every day.   2. Be busy! I cannot stress this enough. Go out with friends, have fun, and do things that will take your mind off of this. An idle mind is the worst thing for you right now.  3. Stay off the computer for a while. The computer will create that idle mind referred to in the previous listing.  4. Read a happy book, see a happy movie, and try every day to BE happy. Positivity will keep you going.  5. Tell yourself that you are beautiful, you are worth it, and your ex made a serious mistake. Pump up your self-esteem. This is important.    I did all of these to get over a previous relationship. Maybe they'll work for you. TIME is the only cure for this. Good luck.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	sounds like he has moved on and so should you. you said he has scared you heart once. What do you need him to do it again and again cause he will.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Decide you have a wonderful life to live and live it..forgotting about him all together|`|rJ9Zkx35aa	Realize that it is over and move on as best as possible|`|dhRWUtkhaa	if you cant have him to yourself,because he has shared himself with another i would get on with my life.....and just go forward ,and not backward,and just pray that the good lord has mr right for you.
AA10941788	If you have proof then yes|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it depends on the state they live in and the divorce laws there.  Most, if not all have "no fault divorce".  that is basically an uncontested divorce. they both agree to the divorce.    community property states, it doesn't matter who is right or wrong.      equitable property states, it does (along with how long you were married).  and the first one to file is the one with all the power--the way for him to force her to file first would be for him to have an affair and humiliate her publicly.  This would then make her the victim.    If he wants to be the victim then he needs to prove that she has somehow wronged him and to beat her to the punch of filing the divorce first.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	The female always comes out on top. Regardless of circumstances.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I'd seek attorney advice, my opinion is some people just don't like to be the ones that file. No other reason except pride. If she does have money and it was hers before they got married, then maybe he'd fair better if HE did the filing. There's only one victim as you put it and it's her if she doesn't want it and he's been demeaning her. Most times unless there are major circumstances involved, it doesn't make a difference who files. If it's a 50/50 state, he or she would only be entitled to the portion that came from the marriage. Other than pride or belief, I see no benefits of him not filing. In fact, if he's been demeaning her, she would have the better reason for the divorce.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|4POGapREaa	I canceled my wedding & eloped instead but it was around $1500 for the florist & we were going to have 50 guests.  I wasn't overdoing it either, it was modest.  That included the guest tables at around $40 per centerpiece, $60 for our table, the arch but I don't remember what that cost, the stairway would have been greenery & tulle, I think my bouquet was around $180, then we had bouquets for 2 bridesmaids, 2 boutonnieres, and one for my mom.|`|ObJTgBafaa	I got some really lovely artificial ones from a website.

They were really good value for money.      Bridal bouquet,   Cheif bridesmaid bouquet,   x2 flower girl bouqets  Groom's botton hole  x4 other botton holes  including p&p around 90|`|ezMoS0mqaa	90 for my bouquet and i think about another 30 on button holes.

LKqbrHNnaa	Definately. I have had the same male friends for years and we've never been interested in eachother. We couldn't stay friends if we thought of eachother as boyfriend/girlfriend material. It would be like going out with my brother.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	defo my sister is best friends with this guy and she's not dating him so yeah|`|b1NRf4VCaa	yes they can|`|ssYAAfEJaa	nope, i don't think it is possible|`|LXkGQXkQaa	Yes, i think the best thing about having a good friend of the opposite sex is that sometimes you can talk to them about more personal things or things you would'nt talk to the same sex about. So as long as one doesent chage|`|g9DWi0DKaa	yes my best mate is a guy and ppl always think were dating i don't care were just really close I can confide in him with anything and having a girl best mate isn't as good because girls are really 2 faced and we cant help it its in our genes
appjNRs1aa	Okay--first, I agree with you, and commend you for making a very hard decision.    Yes, if they are still having explosive fights, there ARE unresolved issued, and you should get out to protect yourself.    As for what to tell him, you can just say that you've been thinking about it, and you need to be in a relationship where someone can offer their whole self, and since he is still legally married, he can't.    He'll deny it, of course, but you know what's best for you.  You can bring up the blog or not, but really, he is going to have so much stuff to work out, and there is no reason for YOU to support him during his divorce.  It should be done, so he can focus on you.    I'm so sorry you're going through this.  Good luck.|`|Jwzq6NAZaa	I say be strong. Tell him that you read her blog. Maybe their divorce is none of your business but what is going on in his life is your business. How can you build a relationship with him if he isn't being completely honest with you about what is going on elsewhere. I think that he has some issues about letting you in.    It sounds like you have been thinking about this for awhile if you've tried to break it off before. He obviously has issues that he needs to deal with and maybe it would be better if you stepped aside for now and let him deal with them. Who knows, maybe once the divorce goes through and all the emotions cool down, he will be in a better spot to be with you.|`|44mmJ14Caa	SERIOUSLY I AM SAYING THIS AS A MARRIED WOMAN  IF U WERE MARRIED TO A MAN HOW WUD U FEEL IF SOMEONE  WAS DATING HIM AND EVEN TOLD THEM THAT HE LOVED THEM WHEN U WERE SUPPOST TO BE HIS ONLY WOMAN FOR HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE...IM SORRY ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT GETTING IN BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE THAT ARE MARRIED SEPARATED OR NOT IS WAY MORE DRAMA THAN ANY GIRL NEEDS|`|5OXtsCv1aa	Dating a man that is technically married, going through a divorce can be hard and down right stressful at times. Maybe his wife was just venting on this blog. How do you know when these blow ups happened. Her feelings are not his feelings. I can't say if dating him is wrong or right for you and your life however, her are some good questions to help you decide.    Are you a secret to his wife, friends, family, co workers? Does he still live with her? Are they still sexually involved? Has the divorce been filed and what is the hold up? If you answered yes to any of this I think you should end it. He is likely playing games.     I have never been a secret to anyone in my mans life. If they are going to divorce there is no reason why she can't know he is dating. My SO & I live at his house or mine when we are together. He doesn't have to go home to anyone. I believe he is in love with me and has no intimacy with her. They will be divorced soon but, the financial agreement is taking time.|`|02f1bc31749f26b37d78e2e8ad505a6baa	I hope you have broken off with this man. Regardless of separation and pending divorce, he is married. If the divorce does go through and you marry him, you will be stuck with his baggage. This will be an albatross around your neck. Your chance of divorcing this guy will be around 85%.    You best get out now and stick with single guys (not even divorced ones either) Single..meaning never married before.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	you shouldn't have to go through the bull sh** that you are going through.i would have done the same thing about the blog. when people are in a divorce it gets nasty sometimes. your divorce is your business, for there are many people who promise to get divorce and never does. if he is dragging it on for trying to get back with his wife i would be furious. any hint that he wanted her back i would tell him good bye. i would tell him when you divorce is final and still want to be with me give me a call. but if there are no signs that he wants to go back, he is just trying to keep you from getting involved. does his wife know tht you are with him?.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	well it's not like you're snooping.  the blogs are publicly available to anyone who knows where to find them.    I don't know that you have to go into any kind of detail.  Just tell him that it's not working out for you and you need to go in a different direction.  Tell him you enjoyed your time together but you don't see the two of you in a long term relationship and it's time for you to move on.  He can cry and beg all he wants, all you have to do is not listen to him and stop taking his calls and emails and tell him to leave you alone.    really, if you don't want to go into a detailed explanation of "I saw blah blah blah on this blog"  all you have to say is "I don't see a future for us."  there is no way he can counter that argument and there is no reason for you to debate it with him.  Say your peace and then leave.  Don't drag it out.    FWIW:  you're probably right to break it off.  It has nothing to do with the morality of dating a separated/divorcing man and everything to do with the drama is happening NOW and it's not over as it would normally be for someone who is already divorced and moved on.  He has unfinished business that he needs to tend to and he's not a good prospect for a relationship just now.    He may very well love you and care for you but the other drama that is going on in his life shows that he is still tied to her for now and also that he could be a problem later if you decided you wanted to leave later as well.  (remember--how they treat the ex could very well be how they treat you if/when you are their ex)|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Just be totally honest.  Just tell him that you think there is too much baggage that goes along with him.  If he is still fighting with her he cares, you are right about that.|`|8FO52r0Maa	Just tell him that although you care about him, that there is too much going on with his impending divorce and you want to be sure you're not just a rebound, and that you both should have some space to think about what you really want.  Tell him once the divorce is finalized that you will consider dating again, but not until that time.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're a bright brave person and can do this.  It takes a strong woman to love a man going through a divorce.    Now, it'll take that strength redirected for your own well-being.  It's just time and many of us have been where you are--into a man that's just not that into us.       But you've shown why it's a bad idea to date a separated but not divorced man.  It's a shaky foundation and you don't know where you stand.|`|0AShsMsoaa	you seem to have a good head on your shoulders and have asked a good question.  simply say, i need some space and distance here, this situation is not working for me as there is unresolved business with you and your wife.      when you are finished completely with your own personal busines with her, and are free and available completely to pursue the good thing i thought we had, i would love to see you if i am available.  i wish you well.        boy i like what i wrote so much i wish i had someone to give that little speech to.  it sounds so self assured.      no matter what he does you will probably feel better just sticking up for yourself.  3 is always a crowd.

5sCpMpbWaa	My friend had the same problem recently.Dont give up as she will win then . try and text him and tell him you want to meet up alone and then i think you should get together and forget the other girl. He will meet up with you if he isnt interested in the other girl.|`|PnDSuCqJaa	I would try asking him to help with something you know he can help with, but know she can't. then you'll have time to talk with him while she isn't around.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Talk to the guy alone, and I think the Internet communication is probably the best idea to do so.

AA11401294	no|`|e76nQKKZaa	For sure.  if you even think about having sex with other people, than i guess that could be a form a cheating..  because obviously, you aren't very faithful.|`|RoR3o6iQaa	yeah thats lik swingers lol,in a way...and i have a feeling this is someone i know lol...e mail if this is you?? lol|`|gfHutvEFaa	yes. emotionally and sexually connecting with someone other than your S.O. is cheating. Everytime.|`|FdY5qFE7aa	Cyber sex gone wrong. What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?|`|cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	Yes.  Any relationship that takes time from the primary relationship and has to occur without the significant other knowing, is cheating.  Ask yourself a tough question: if your significant other was doing it, would it bother you?  If the answer is yes, you may want to not head down that road.  Take care and God bless.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	sort of..it's a kindda emotional contact sport..anything u hide w/no apparent reason is a form of cheating...|`|B1sT1t44aa	Anything that takes your mind away on a sexual level from the real person in your life is cheating in my opinion.|`|E8XGy5Kbaa	YEAHH !|`|E5habPNsaa	!!!|`|sIdoUK2Laa	yes Absolutely|`|h4HL3d3uaa	yes especially if your married too bonnie smith|`|dROrlLvhaa	YES!!!|`|Dmsn6ZNaaa	yes, absolutely.|`|58H53s8maa	no but its stupid when you could just have real sex|`|SX8z9Zg0aa	Who does that?

The sense that you want to have cybersex is cheating on your partner.|`|eoOc3b7xaa	GET A LIFE|`|fc4H4gdKaa	definatly.|`|7erigI6Maa	Of course althought its not contact sex its done thinking and watching someone other than your partner.Sooo cheating|`|Dn8Rc9gfaa	yuh.|`|6zzte15caa	Yeah... Because your being sexually intimate with someone else.|`|yNFkj3Iuaa	As cheating is primarily an emotional act, yes.|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	no i consider it a form of being a pathetic person|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	NO.    It is an exercise of the mind. Role Playing if you were.    Although this question has been debated in this forum, a lot of people are of the opinion that it is, and just as many are of the opinion that it isn't.    It is something for you to draw a conclusion on.|`|pr8LkqXhaa	weird question but ye i guess it is kinda cheating..maybe even worse    as you would rather have sex with metal than your girlfriend/boyfriend|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	Yes of course it is, they even have a documentary of it being a form of cheating.|`|ptg3fzmtaa	yessssssssssssssss|`|AA11825142	yes!|`|8ZI62IHkaa	yes. Its is of course a more harmless form of cheating. But it is still cheating. If you wouldn't like your boyfriend or girlfriend to be talking about wanting to do sexual things to another person... than you'll consider it cheating too.|`|MNNxs5u8aa	Depends on the parameters you and the person you might be cheating on have set to the relationship.  No object is inherent of any ideas in itself; instead it's a measure of the reactions people have to it: if you consider cheating only something of the body, then no, if intent is just as important, then yes.    Lol, I love how half the people answering this question think you're the one having cybersex.  Like, no where did you actually say it was you, or even your partner who was doing the alleged "cheating."|`|P3v6hWyOaa	My general rule of thumb is if you could not do something on the computer without your significant other in the room, then it's wrong.|`|WA8feS8taa	Yes it is.|`|21TogLbJaa	yes|`|AA11678629	YES|`|x3tats3qaa	yes|`|d4fU78sKaa	Who has cyber sex?    I mean come on, really?  are you that pathetic?|`|KenDuMH2aa	yes|`|9P0TiiX4aa	yepyep|`|hfn2wLOAaa	yeah|`|U5AXg5Ghaa	i would think so.  ur getting pleasure off of somebody elses excitement when it could be your partners thing to do.|`|ci8dSwKLaa	yes.  you might as well have REAL sex.  same type of betrayal :S|`|V20PTwMmaa	yes|`|yxoXTmlqaa	No, just you know.  Plain creepy.|`|ZlaxbI33aa	Yes, I learned a long time ago if you put yourself in certain situations then it leads to other things. Even my own pastor says he wont sit in a room alone with another women because temptation is always there.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Technically- no, and this is why many do it. The real problem with this becomes the URGE to carry-out the real act of cheating...which often becomes the case, later.|`|Svgru3Tnaa	LOL! Why would you want to do that? Cant you just watch a porno? Wait, is watching a porno and masturbating, cheating? Its kinda the same...getting off on someone that's not your partner...Hm-mm....|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Sometimes|`|wyRJofXJaa	if u r a woman yes....if ur a guy no....coz guys can do anything|`|om2lE7jfaa	yes.... would you like it if your spouse had to look elsewhere to get his pleasure? i doubt it. its not a very good feeling to know your spouse is getting his/her pleasure from another person|`|FXCoGD44aa	I consider anything that you do with someone else that you wouldn't otherwise do if your significant other was sitting right next to you watching to be cheating. I don't think I would cyber with another guy in front of my boyfriend - that would make him pretty upset. So yes, I consider it cheating.|`|pUTKCxVRaa	yes.  dude..who has cybersex?!  that is so fricking stupid.  who is honestly THAT pathetic.|`|W1MgefrWaa	Yes. At the very least it is an emotional affair.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yes.  When you are with someone, that person should be the ONLY one you engage in sexual activity with.  Cybersex is cheating.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Definitely.|`|2OBP8fqJaa	Absolutely!     "but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

vLRrmVXMaa	yes. but it can get weird if you are very close and you are married. but other then that, absoulutly.    edit about your edit (lol): lying is totally different. that would make me very suspicious. why didn't he tell you? why did he think you would make a big deal of it? he did something behind your back he knew you wouldn't like. maybe you should talk to him.|`|GtVJpgnUaa	honestly i do :) i am a girl who has had a LOT of friends who were guy. especially from elementary years (1st to 5th grade) . but even know i still have friends who are guys ;) they may not be that CLOSE but i mean still they're friends 8D i mean there's this one close friend i have. not THAT close but i mean close enough ;) and hes a guy. i can never imagine liking him XD no offense to him ;D but I dont know. I feel you can be friends just from my own experiences. ;D i may be shy and weird around em, but i feel that guys are cool to have as friends!  8D not as BOYfriends.|`|AA10929980	of course it is. what would make it impossible for a guy and girl to be just friends? I have lots of guy friends and we are all just friends.|`|3A2CB31caa	most definitely. It's very Middle-school (you talked to her? Do you like, like her?) mentality to think that boys and girls can't be just friends. Personally, me, as a guy, have probably more friends that are girls then I do guys. Keep in mind at this same time I've never dated or had a girlfriend. It's definitely possible. However, it can sometimes be awkward, but if you are genuine friends, it fades away. The only time having a friend of the opposite sex is ever awkward is if you or your friend has feelings beyond friendship one way or the other.    It's probably best to have friends of the opposite sex, especially if you want to know how to be nice and friendly with people not of your own gender.|`|VZOisk2saa	i do i have friends that are guys  i dont want anything from them than to just  be friends and they dont want anything from me than to just be friends and i am really close to one of them the thing is some times that is hard for a bf to understand   ~PD
cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	As a black female, my heart hurts for you.  I had hoped that by now, many people would move past the "color line", but sometimes we don't.  The media has NOT helped either; most black men are either seen as rapists, playas or drug-dealing sociopaths.  That is not true!  The best I can tell you is that you need to sit down with your mother and gently let her know that this is who you love; a restraining order would only alienate you from her.  And what if you have children?  She would not get to know her grand kids.  I don't know how old you are, but she should not be able to keep you two apart.  If he is a good man who treats you with courtesy, respect, love and kindness, color doesn't matter. Take care and God bless.|`|AA11825142	Well i think if you love him that your mother will eventually come around. I am also assuming you are 18 or older.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Race isn't important in this issue.    The matters of your heart are.    If you are over 18 she can say all she wants to but legally won't have a leg to stand on.    If you are still living at home, move out.    She can't live your life for you although she is showing her prejudice side.|`|e862349f14022175e522ea786fba3a3faa	Live your life with this man be happy and when your mother sees this she will come around, it might take time but believe me she will.   for the honeymoon just enjoy each other|`|d92d9e4d19ffb819be90e8ef2b343f22aa	How old are you??    While your Mother seems to be using racially motivated disapproval, it might be that she is worried you are not adult enough, to make such a choice in your life at this time.       How can you live with a computer and not do simple basic research on restraining orders??  People can't just put a restraining order on someone for no apparent reason, perhaps she is worried you are not mature enough to be part of a couple much less a marriage partner.    His being cute or handsome has little regard on if he can or will be a good provider or a good man for that matter. So your words show me you lack in maturity to know what would be a good choice as a husband.  Pretty fades, character is what is the issue.    Getting married is a huge choice, something that will affect and effect you for years to come.  No matter what race your boyfriend is or not.     You need to know that making this choice might distance you from your family and especially your Mother, who I think was also there while you fought Cancer.    You also said that your Mother was worried about you just being a sexual toy for your boyfriend, yet you then ask how you can keep him satisfied when you go on your honeymoon.  Which is it?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	how old are you?  If you're an adult then your mother has no control over who you marry.    as to the restraining order?  Has either of you threatened her?  If you haven't then she will be laughed out of the courtroom and it won't be granted.  This sounds more like her pathetic attempt at controlling you.    She's basically told you to choose between your BF and her.    It's your life and you're the one who has to live it.  How important is your mother to you?  Is she a good influence in your life?  Would you miss her?  Could you live without her if you had to?  Which would you regret more:  losing your mom or losing your BF?    When you can answer those questions, you'll know what you need to do.    as to how you show her that you are serious:  you get married and stay married forever.  yeah, sometimes it takes people a long time to know you are serious.  It took my brother almost 15 years to prove to his inlaws that he was a changed man and not the thug wild boy they knew when he was young.  My aunt was married to her Jewish husband for 18 years and had 2 kids before his parents finally resigned themselves to the fact that she wasn't going any where.     How can you make her happy again?  Give her what she wants.  Dump your BF and never make a move without her approval first.  You can't fix everything and  you can't make anyone happy (happiness comes from within and it's a choice we each make).  You have to understand that not everyone will be pleased with your decisions and sometimes we all just have to agree to disagree.    How do you make him happy in bed?  Talk to him, learn what he likes, teach him what you like, experiment and play.    If you want to know what I would do:  If I loved him and he was a good man and I couldn't imagine living my life w/out him then it would be no contest between my mother and my man.  But then much to her disappointment, my mother raised me to be strong and make decisions for myself that I know are right for me--even if she didn't agree with those decisions and I defied her on many occasions and taught her that she couldn't threaten to remove herself from my life on a whim and expect me to cower and cave in.|`|W1MgefrWaa	Wow ur life is a mess. I suggest moving to another state, and starting over. You need to get away from ur family and start fresh.  As far as ur bf. Cahnces are, no matter what color he is the resistance from ur mother is making u want to be with him even more. U need to give that a break too.

AA10065812	Most states take into consideration a percentage of it based on your difference of income from the mother.  Check the child support guidelines to be sure.

There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

Try it, you might be surprised how it works out.
7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	Most states look at it like this:  Who has primary custody?  How much time does the child spend with the parent?  And then... how much does each parent make.    The wife will probably have to pay some support since the husband is the one who'll have primary care.  He's got to be careful that he gets a court order stating that he is the primary... otherwise she could file for support and claim that she has them most.      Good luck... God bless|`|dzyJw0cvaa	The child support laws have drastically changed since 2007 to make it fair for guys in his situation.  It all depends on how much time is spent with the children and then they figure in both incomes.  I think in this situation, having since he will have the kids 95% of the time, she will get very little, if any child support from him!|`|AA10065812	I've seen many of these cases where the father still had to pay child support, but usually when the income difference is far greater.  It is never done in the reverse, as was evident wit Marcia Clark, who earned more than four times that of Gordon Clark, but still demanded child support, plus that he cover her cost for clothes, makeup, shoes, and a hair dresser for the OJ Simpson trial.    He does need to start taking steps to protect himself and the children, otherwise she could come back to take them away.    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

If he is going to be the custodial parent, he will not be paying her child support. However since he makes more than her, he may be on the hook for alimony which is simply maintenance for her to continue the lifestyle she was used to before the split. All of that is determined by the court if they cannot come to an agreement|`|wpi36XBAaa	I would doubt that she would get anything from him if she has the children just 4 days in the month. In fact, even if she has the lower income, he may be entitled to something (money wise) from her.|`|gfHutvEFaa	why would anyone think if they are the primary custodial parent, they would have to pay child support to the parent who will not have physical custody?? We are talking about CHILD support, not SPOUSAL support.    No matter how much she makes or doesn't make, SHE will have to pay HIM child support. Make sure he gets down to the courthouse and starts this.|`|AA11825142	No if your friend has the kids more than 50% of the time he doesn't have to pay her a dime!

And she wouldn't get child support because she wouldn't be the primary parent in this case.|`|AXr4Sx5raa	no!!!! the other way around|`|hsZnjZvoaa	As far as spousal support it often depends on how long they were married, if she gave up a career for the marriage, etc... each state is different.     As far as the child support, the parent with primary (physical) custody is the one that receives the child support.  The amount of time she has the chidren may "reduce" the amount she pays to accomodate her for what it costs when she does have them.  I've not heard of a non-custodial parent getting child support.
RjpPzbBJaa	I would not file until I attempted some marital counceling. If he is getting defensive and angry when you ask why he rejects you, it could be something he's embarrassed about.

There is no law that says the two of you have to have sex a certain number of times a week, month or year.    Some people aren't that turned on by sex. I am, she isn't. But still I haven't gone outside the marriage to find anyone for just a sexual rendezvous.    Maybe he needs counseling or the little blue pill.

AA10065812	Whether or not you are telling the truth about not remembering having sex with her, you are obligated to pay the back support.  Since you have also been ordered to pay for the college education, that you or the child lives in the state of Washington.  I hope you do know that only applies to schools with the state.  I've seen many cases over the years where men have been ordered to pay up to 23 years of retroactive support.  Fortunately, here in Kansas they can only go back 5 years, unless the mother was on Welfare.  Some judges are starting to refuse to order retroactive support, thinking the mothers should have done something before than.    As for your base child support payment, once you have filed for unemployment, you can file for a modification, BUT you will still lose 55% of your unemployment, due to the back owed child support.  It is important that you get it paid down as it is also collecting 5% annual interest, compounded.  So, though you think you you owe $95,000, when that is paid, you will still need to pay the interest.  So you actually owe about $105,000.    If you do think a hotel maid impregnated herself, and you can remember what hotel you were staying in, you might consider tracking down employment records.  If you can prove this is true, you may have an action against the hotel.  You cannot stop the owed child support, as as it is based on the existence of the child, and not how the child was conceived.  A woman in Florida impregnated herself after having oral sex with a doctor, and was awarded child support.  Though he had to pay it, the State Supreme Court ruled he could sue her for  financial damages, though if he wins, he can only collect off her earned income, not what he's paying her.    You can also file to have the child support, and possibly the arrearage, go directly to the girl, which really should irritate the mother.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	That's garbage I can't believe that happened to  you.  You have to try to get a similar paying job.  If you exhaust all efforts and still can't then you go back to court with proof of all this and ask for a reduction.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Get a lawyer.    If you are out of work then you can't pay the child support. Also I would petition the court because DNA tests aren't foolproof.    I don't see why you would have to pay for this child's college education as well. When did her mother decide to go after you for child support in the first place?|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	All you can do is go back to court and see if a judge will side with you on the support. I would guess yes to some degree. this is crazy.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	No court in this country would demand back child support for a 17-year old deliquency.  There would have to have been a court order in place that you ignored, and they could only collect from the time the order was filed and submitted.  Not to mention...even if you ARE the father, you are under no obligation to pay for college.  I couldn't even get that from my HUSBAND when we divorced because a college student is no longer a minor, and the support is moot at that point.  Also...if you owed $96,000 in back support, your butt would be in jail.    I apologize for doubting you IF your story is true...but if it IS...you are getting the royal shaft!  Why have you not even considered getting an attorney?
d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	sounds like a delay tactic to me.    But the other gentleman is correct.

K2QwEM4raa	I wouldn't waste my time on your mother right now because she is thinking only of herself. And this will not change until she wants it to. Tell your brother that she is being selfish right now and maybe someday she will return to her senses.  Good luck and try and move on, because the problem is her , not you kids. What a selfish women!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	What a difficult situation you are in, particularly with the autistic brother.    I'm afraid, my dear, that you are going to have to grow up rather quickly now, because it seems to me that your mother has opted out of reality and is living in some sort of fantasy world. I think that your mother is a lost cause, and even if she does come back to earth and back to you, the relationship with your father is never going to be satisfactory. I'm sorry ..... so you have to grow up, and fast. For the time being, tell your brother that your Mum is living with that other guy now.    You need to talk to your Dad about your brother and about what's right for him, and maybe figure out a way to get help from social services in your area - there is no harm in asking, in any case. Your Dad was very responsible in getting you both out of that house with your Mum's new chap in it, so there's no harm is talking to him about what could be done for your brother.     Let me stress that there is no point wishing and hoping for your mother to come back. You and your father need to deal with the situation at hand, see what options you have in relation to your brother, and of course for you yourself.     This is tough, I know, but you will all get through this .... people who have to cope in difficult situations find that they cope marvellously.|`|hhrMwnMAaa	first i want to commend you for being great with your brother. i think you shoukd forget about her! if you keep on trying then you get hurt. in the meantime keep on being there  for your brother and bulid a relationship with your father.

I dont know what to say to you. But your mom is seriously not a good mom and thinks that she can do whatever she wants and sincerely doesn't care about her kids and does not have any self-respect!! I dont think she's a good role model for you or your brother and i guess for the meantime you guys should stay with your dad. It might be difficult but seriously it's better that way since  your mom does not give a ****!!!!! I would not lose touch with her but really i would tell her how i feel about her doing that! I would be so pissed!!!!! it's unbelievable how she can be so careless and stupid. no offense, but in my honest opinion that is the truth.     I would move on and try to find a job and find new activities and obviously you won't forget and neither will anybody else, but try to make things better for you and your brother. Maybe one day when she's all alone and her new 'lover" gets tired of her, she will see and hopefully it's not too late!!!!!!!      im so sorry, but damn. this really sucks. i wish you the best and hope that everything goes well. :D|`|P4Jc76GPaa	Ciera,  That's a very tough situation to be in. Especially since you have an autistic brother. I would recommend that you sit down with your mother and let her know how you and your brother feel. If it feels like she does not care and does not show any compassion, it may be in you and your brother's best interest to move back with your father. You are in a very tough situation and there really isn't an easy answer. I wish you and your brother the best.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Actually most of my favorite Valentine's gifts didn't cost a lot of money.  What makes it incredible is the skill and creativity behind the gift.  For example, my boyfriend in hs had my mom put a rose on my pillow so it was the first thing I saw when I woke up.  He brought me breakfast on my way to school.    Another great one was a hike in the mountains with a bookbag picnic.  We got to the top and he had a picnic blanket, cold pasta salad, and something else with croissants, and drinks.  It was so beautiful and perfect.    Another idea is to go somewhere together thats a couple hours away.  A get away for just the two of you.  Perhaps a day trip to the beach or a favorite restaurant.    Get her favorite chocolate.  Mine happens to be Turtles which is only like $3.  One year for Valentine's Day I took my boyfriend to my parent's beach place.  It was free and I got one of those chocolate fondue pot with some strawberries and pineapple for us to dip.      One of my friends had a guy friend of his deliver a rose to her work almost every hour.  She got 6 during the day and the other 6 that night at dinner.  That was only like $12 but the time that was put into the gift that matters.    Make a dessert especially something that is difficult like a creme brulee or something.    If you live together, spa night.  Get out of the house and give her a facial kit, pedicure set, an exfoliating scrub, a new book and a glass of wine.  One of those cool little racks that goes over the bath tub so she can read her book and drink her wine in the tub.  Maybe a Yankee Candle and a cd like the ones from Solitude (Bed Bath & Beyond, Brookstone, and Target all sell them) in Spa Sounds or Ocean Waves.    Go anywhere and watch the sunset together.    I'd much rather have any gift like that than just be given a diamond bracelet.  The time and romance and creativity matters more than anything.|`|0AShsMsoaa	take her out to dinner and put it on your credit card|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Nothing can go wrong if you cook her dinner, a nice meal, including dessert with her favorite alcohol/wine. Candles in her favorite color. You can put on a movie that you two love and spend the night in.     Flowers won't cost as much as you think, You can find decent amount for 30 bucks and have those are the centerpiece for the meal.     Or you can come up with a gift basket of things she wants and is looking for all for 40 bucks or under. For example, is there a DVD collection she is working on, buy the next in the series. Is there a CD that she really wants but is waiting to buy pick it up as well, and finish the basket off with something funny sweet like a cupcake. My boyfriend loves chewing gum. So his funny sweet gift was a 5 pack set of chewing gum and he loved it.     You can also get some decent jewelry, i.e. earrings for about 20-30 bucks. Over all the entire night doesn't have to be more than 60 dollars and you would have wowed her with the romance of it all.|`|d02b568e4bf652810518e42077ff6d60aa	do something from your heart like cook dinner for her or something|`|12ORrojXaa	my most favorite valentine's day was last year when my husband cooked me dinner (he never cooks), put some music on, lit candles everywhere, and dimmed the lights.  he even set the table (the correct way and used our "nice" place mats).  he bought me some roses and gave me a beautiful card.  i would love to have that every year!

h2yhL47Caa	My (then) boyfriend in college and I were both nudists and the rule was that we always were nude in our dorm room, even if friends came over. We told them about it beforehand so there were no surprises. Everybody was really cool with it. I suggest that you ask your guests out of respect if they mind you being nude. If you're exploring nudism, good for you - tell them so. Being nude isn't always about being sexual. I am a nudist still and my partner and I are naked a lot without having sex.|`|FoIxsunVaa	When you decide you want to be a nudist, there are places and times that nudists meet. Nudists don't ask their non-nudist friends to try it. What if your friends say "hey we like rolling around in dog poop, Wanna try it?"    I don't mean to say nudism is a bad thing, but to many people it is not something they would ever do. It could make your friends uncomfortable even to ask.    If your friends are male and female, they may think you have ulterior motives or that you being there with THEIR nudity would be a romantic intrusion. if they are one gender (all male or all female) they may think the same thing, or THEY might have feelings which nudism would bring out uncomfortably.    If they are under 18, you risk horrifying their parents, if they are over 18, you are inviting them to a statutory rape charge JUST BY AGREEING. Given your age and the vagueness of your question, I think YOU are sorting something out and this idea is you getting carried away by some ulterior design, like sleeping with one of these genderless "friends."|`|mggll8dRaa	Bad Idea, wear swim Trunks like a normal Person....!!|`|lbvE1bMqaa	ummm...that's a little gross...the guests come first, so make sure they're comfortable with you being naked.|`|EhQyJE14aa	Um... Ew, but ask them first|`|yXbazL5iaa	Play truth or dare, then dare all of them to be naked for the rest of the night, even if someone nocks on the door.  they might dare you to do the same thing|`|4TG8Kg7taa	NO!!! it is not ok and they would not think it would be ok dont ask them either|`|ZSS9Wfraaa	wow, i'll be your friend! :]  joking... either just do it or ask if they care then do it   you know your friends better than anyone on here does so if you think it'll weird them out don't do it, otherwise go for it|`|7OFf25Nkaa	you might want to think about that one because your friends might take your being naked as you trying to get at them or something  i mean if you know that they are comfortable with that than go for it and even though i don't think you should ask aha  if you're going to ask them you have to think on how ur gonna bring that one up in conversation|`|KbKEjfdtaa	I love being naked too.  The hardest part will be getting up the nerve to ask them about it.  Judging from the people I know, lots of people like to be naked and are really cool with it - it's just kind of unusual for people to talk about it or for somebody to actually bring it up.  My friends and I hang out naked all the time now and it's awesome and fun.  I say go for it.  Chances are at least a few of your friends will want to chill naked with you and be fine with being naked all the time.  The ones that don't can either deal or just not hang out with you.  I have some friends who still keep their clothes on when others are naked - they're fine being around naked people, but they just aren't real comfortable being naked themselves.  Personally that doesn't bother me, as long as they're my friends and fun to be around, I don't care what anyone wears or doesn't wear.  Naked is definitely more fun though  :)
cdQryr7paa	Tell him if he doesn't get a job you will stop doing things for him.  Stop cleaning the house, doing the laundry, making the meals.  If he can be home all day, he can do all those things.  Make staying home a living hell so he has to find a job.|`|8tJPK69iaa	I'd last about 2 months ( I know because I did) waiting for him to get a job. If he doesn't have one his bags should be out the door.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	leave him go to your family or a friend and let him know how to get you home|`|IFd94XDkaa	If a man isn't man enough to work and support his family there really isn't any way to force him to do it.  Most men take a great deal of pride in taking care of their family.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	give him a date to have a job and if he don't or hasn't tried to get one then throw him out he is no good and never will be.|`|AA10289805	Too vague. You don't say why he's not working or what he does when he works.|`|024Pu2XRaa	try getting him to work|`|E6x6fYn5aa	What is it that he is supposed to do?    There aren't really his responsibilities\ her responsibilities anymore.  Men and women work, men and women do house work too.  Just don't let him make you do everything.    Make the lack of money more dramatic, beans for dinner, beans for breakfast, etc.  No toilet paper  (keep a hidden stash for yourself  :) of course.)  CANCEL INTERNET AND CABLE (or ask the provider to turn it off for a couple weeks).  Let him think the problem is more urgent than it is.    But really if he is not interested in working there is not much you can do.  Move on and don't let him drag you down.|`|rJ9Zkx35aa	Certainly should be working
688848d500e8dd2311ecc4f3b039b60eaa	You need to take a step back and look at the big picture. Women like your husband's boss have worked hard to gain the position of leadership they have. Your husband has not performed as well as her so he needs to fall in line and do as she asks.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	That's all he needs is his mommy, I mean wife messing up his job for him. If you stick your nose in he'll never live it down.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Your anger is just s smidge overboard and misplaced don't you think? This is not about this person who is ensuring your hubby.s income, it is more about the relationsship YOU share with HIM.   When you look at your relationship you can define what isn't working and how to make it work the easiest fastest way. It is a disconnection with him that has happened. He is just not into challenging his boss for your needs. In otherwords they are not his needs. He has disengaged in the discussion on family priorities. Perhaps because you are angry and he can't deal with it. Try to teach him how to please you, and allow him to find his heroism and masculine strength in the realtionship. Let him be rewarded for being your hero, and learn the word compromise. Support him regardless. Be wonderful to his boss and co-workers as it will help him at work.|`|8tJPK69iaa	yeah, family is more important than his job-hope you fare well on welfare  You need to MYOB when it comes to HIS job and just be thankful that he has one.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	are you sure she's changing his schedule and that's not just his excuse?    he could be volunteering for the changes and using work as a way to escape home or he could be using work as his alibi to cover up something else.    And I could be completely off base.  You may be married to a mama's boy who needs a domineering woman to take charge of him and this is why he kowtows to the lady boss.    or is he concerned for his job?  Does he believe if he speaks up he will lose the job? or are there pressing financial matters that he is worried about?    Your complaint is with him NOT the boss.  He doesn't prioritize family over work.  That's the issue you take up with him.  Talk to him, find out what's going on.  Don't yell and scream, I know you're frustrated but it only puts him on the defensive and you won't learn anything if he's fighting you.    If the job doesn't pay enough or he's not thrilled with the job then help him figure out what he needs to do to improve it or get a better one.      Other than that leave his career to him.  For you to contact his work and complain causes him to be seen as weak and expendable and not a team player.  For him to complain is to be seen as standing up for himself and by him standing up he's better able to offer a compromise to get what he wants where you can't.    So call, complain, and watch him lose his job, see him come to resent you for interfering, and watch your marriage dissolve.    Or talk to him and tell him your concerns, find out what his are, trust him to know what's best for his career, help him find balance between work and family and watch your relationship grow and blossom.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Just in case you miss it the job market isn't looking so great right now,it wouldn't do anybody any good to put your husband in the unemployment right now.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Don't worry, you won't have a husband too much longer.|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	OH yes, we all just love a "woman who runs the show"!  You'll embarrass him to the extreme! And maybe get him fired, and then you'll complain about is "not working"!  Mind your family, and let him make the living!  maybe he went from his mommy to another mommy!  you should be ashamed!!|`|FtyLwqR5aa	seek therapy soon you need help.|`|0AShsMsoaa	you have big balls, dont you?      and your husband doesnt have any.  have you not heard that companies are laying off people right and left.  woman, you should be grateful he even has a job, and should be doing all you can to support him in his job.    do you have a screw or two a bit loose there?|`|pRF5LLloaa	YOU don't EVER tell you husband's boss ANYTHING!  That is a sure-fire way to see that he doesn't have a boss -- ie: gets fired!    Your problem is not with his boss, it is with HIM.  You are right -- you need to convince HIM that his family is more important than his job, and the HE needs to confront his boss with the lack of family time.    But understand that because he has a boss, YOU have the freedom and money to do the things you do.  In this economy, it is going to be hard to replace a lost job.  If YOU cause him to lose his job, he will likely hate you for a long time, and it is very likely that your marriage will be ruined.    So a good wife NEVER pressures her husband into a direct confrontation with his boss.  Instead, you SUPPORT him when he makes a decision to do so.  In the mean time, you may just have to live with the situation for a little bit, at least until the job market gets better and you husband can find another job with better hours.    You're obviously young and inexperienced.  You have a LONG time to go, so you need to learn to relax and let things take their course.  For right now, this is NOT the time to be pissing off the boss!    Pull in your claws, love and support your husband, and make do with what you've got until things get better.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Family is more important than a job per say, but where and what quality of family life would you have without the job? It's hard sometimes to try and work a job around a family, but what he needs is a wife he can depend on and who'll try and understand what he has to do. You may not be able to go and do as many things as you did because of the change, but family is the time spent together, not where or when you can go and do things. You'll still have the time together and that's what's important. Don't hate honey, this is just a part of life and I'm sure you'll have many more times of disappointment. Just make the most of your time when together.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	Hmm....  I think work is more important than family. You can't have a family without putting food on the table. And if the agreement was that he had to work flexible schedule when he took the job, then his boss has every right to change his schedule.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	The best way to emasculate your husband and let him know you have zero faith in him is to interfere at his job.  Keep your mouth shut and stay out of it - he is an adult and can take care of his job.|`|cdQryr7paa	You will think a job is pretty important when he loses his because of your meddling and you can't pay your bills anymore.  Family is important, but so is taking care of your family.  Do you really expect a grown man to call his boss and tell them he can't come to work because his wife won't let him?  Hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs every day.  They wait by the thousands in line for days at unemployment offices all across the country trying to find a job, any job.  I'm sure one of them will be glad to take your husband's job when you finally get him fired.  Be careful what you wish for.|`|024Pu2XRaa	Walk right up to her. point your finger in her face and say "you're a *****".  either that or sleep with her.|`|AA10289805	You need to chill. Wishing death on your husband's boss is a pretty desperate comment, don't you think? Also, you sound like you want to control your husband's life. Just chill out and work within your husband's schedule. if you don't, you risk driving a wedge into your marriage that will destroy it.|`|WokwBBGIaa	ok i can see how that may be annoying but your WAY out of order. what are you his mother and does your husband not have a back bone. you really expect him to call his boss and say " Sorry im not able to come in today becuase my wife said i couldnt" thats crazy especially in these economic times i understand family comes first but you need to be flexible is there something that you had plan that cant be moved to another day just calm down its only small stuff doesnt matter

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Triangle Park is not a Parks & Rec park.  It is run by the Lexington Center Corp.  They also issue the permit for you to have an event there. Call (859) 253-2718 to book events and for pricing. http://www.lexingtoncenter.com/triangleP...    If the park doesn't work out, consider UK's Arboretum.  It's beautiful (no back up building though) http://www.ca.uky.edu/arboretum/FAQs.php Cost is $200.  How to schedule it is at the link.    If you have small enough group, you may be able to pull it off without officially arranging things.  But then you'd have to worry about what if someone complained about a group gathering to the powers that be at either location and you got tossed out in the middle of the ceremony.    You could also scope out local city parks and think about renting a park shelter at Jacobson, Masterson Station, Shillito, Southland or Veterans Parks, whichever is closest or your favorite $30/day. You could even stay and have a picnic or BBQ style reception.  Would be great if you want more family/friends to be there or if people have kids.  If you want this, rent ASAP they go fast.  Contact LexCall (859)425-2255 to arrange the rental and ask about if you need anything else other than your marriage license to get married at a park.    Congrats!|`|rywgn8HLaa	I think that is a really nice idea. I don't see anything wrong with keeping things small.  I'm not sure about the getting married at the fountains, but the best thing to do would be to call the city or go to the city website. They usually have information about parks, etc. You may be able to rent the area that day for a set amount of time. Usually the city rentals are fairly cheap, so it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg.   Here is the website so you can check it out. You can probably send them an email to inquire about it. They actually have some really nice facilities for rent at a good price:  http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?pa...|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	My cousin did this in Mass.

Wz9tSKTaaa	I don't think you understand blood types.    The main classifications of blood types are the ABO system and the Rhesus D factor. The first classifies you as either A, B, AB or O, and the second as positive or negative.    You've told us that you and both your parents have O type - your blood type isn't clearly different, you've just given us more information about it. Each of your parents' blood types, fully specified will be either 'O Rh (D) neg' or 'O Rh (D) pos'.    Even if both your parents are O+ (simplified notation) it would still be possible for you to be O-, as you are. (If they were both O- and you were O+, that would be a bit dodgier, for reasons I won't go into here.)    That's probably as much info as you wanted - you may sleep sound :-). If you'd like to know anything else, feel free to email me (or see my previous answers on this stuff).    By the way, although it isn't the absolutely rarest blood type, O negative is the blood type that hospitals always have the lowest stocks of. The reason for this is that it is the type least likely to cause a bad reaction if donated to someone with a non-matching type. If someone comes into a hospital with severe blood loss and doctors don't have time to check their blood type before giving them a transfusion, they will use O negative (the 'universal donor'). If/when you are old enough, you might consider donating your blood.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	how about your grandparents???|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Good question im going to look it up|`|jtjISk6qaa	O is recessive, so you need a gene from both parents. my mom is AB- and my dad is O+. originally we all thought i had O+ blood but thats impossible. then i donated blood at found out im A+
AA11826328	Don't feel bad that's the way it is in our lives (mommies) it really sounds like you need to talk with an doctor or actually watch Oprah show (no joke) they were talking about something like this for the pass couple of weeks, they say it's depression but, sometimes it's something totally different, if you are on here then you have access to a computer so that means you can look up your problems on here as well, don't feel bad most men think what we do at home is not real work but, if you ask how much day care cost now days then you tell me right  lol you are okay just need a little down time, me time you have to think about you because if you are not well then your household will not be well either......Good Luck Mommy  Lil Angel|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Sounds like depression. See a doctor. Also could you not run your husband to work so you could get out more? As well as that, Check out local Mum and toddler groups, that'd wear the wee man out. l do know what it's like|`|5HqZkJixaa	(((hugs))) I feel you, as I have a 3 year old son as well.  First thing I would suggest is going to the Doctr to get checked out.  You could have a virus, mono, or just something physically wrong with you to cause the fatigue.  You need to make sure.  Also, have you been screened for depression?  Might want to do that as well.    Three year olds are endless energy!  start making friends with some of the other mom's at day care and ask for get togethers where you can trade off babysitting.  That way you can have a night for yourself or for you and your husband and vice versa.    Good luck to you.
9NDKAGLqaa	if she says she didn't then don't worry about it...if she is lying, that's something that is will have to deal with not you....just feed her will a long- handled spoon and keep going about your business...the same thing happened to me when i was your age and i just got over it and still to this day, my friend hasn't told me that she use to talk about me and we are still close like it never happened. and don't listen to what some ppl say  because they might just be trying to break y'all friendship up...just be careful who you listen to...i hope i helped you a little..good luck...|`|AoLS7XXTaa	Talk to her about it. If shes your best friend, then you should be able to talk to her about things like that.|`|bLsWEpDFaa	Hmm.. i had a friend like that, but she moved. the best thing to do in this situation is to think and ask yourself, "which is better, her being my best friend, or her being an ex-bestfriend"  that question is really hard to answer.. i know. but think about what's best for you. be selfish. i hate being selfish, but in this situation, i believe that is really the only way to solve the problem correctly.. and if you enjoy being her friend, and you think she feels the same, then you need to set things straight between everyone. you need to tell everyone to stop lying about "talking about her behind her back" because that's really stupid how they made that up. and you need to figure out the truth about her talking about you or not. but to be honest, all this drama is not worth it, because it's possible that you won't ever see her again after high school, so why make it hard? i hope i helped(:|`|GXKCtmLraa	are u sure u werent talking about her....just not realizing it?.............|`|JpmKtpqmaa	It sounds to me that someone is lying. Either Amanda or Alyssa is lying. But you also said that you have a feeling that she talks about you so why are you still hanging out with her. My advice to you would be to kind of remove yourself away from Alyssa. I am not saying to stop being her friend, but you need to be very careful around her and watch what you say around her. If she is talking about you, that means that she cannot be trusted. Being that you guys have just started to friends I think its time to take it slow unti you are sure that you can trust her...Get a balance on the freindship thing, instead of spending all your time with Alyssa, try hanging out with other friends sometimes... Good Luck!!!!|`|wRuWQA8Yaa	ok, so I had this problem with one of my friends last year too. What I did was I evaluated how much I knew my best friend. I had thought about it for a long time too. Then, I thought of the people who had said these things about her, and I figured out that one of my "sources" didn't like her, and didn't want her in our group. I then sat down all the people from before (my best friend, and my "sources"). We started talking, and finally people started confessing stuff. I think that not just you your self, but the witnesses should all sit down with your best friend and try to sort things out. It worked for me! I know what your going through, it stinks and it makes you feel horrible. I hope you get things sorted out : )|`|Vfa2zae0aa	i have friends like that to.  im just to (i dunno) to tell her that i  dont want to be friends with her.  just  stay friends with Amanda and forget about alyssa .  you didnt need her before you probably dont need her now.  you should try to find out the truth too.....|`|xUW1hTJOaa	just take a break from her for a while|`|AA10198825	Girl, you better straiten up your act and find a better friend!|`|SI09cbuGaa	hey,   It seam like theres only one reason she's your friend-- that reason idk why.

In the mean time be very wary of her and watch her closely to make sure she is really saying things before you chew her out or tell her off. It's better to be 110% sure before you do something you might regret. What I say though. Once a mean girl, always a mean girl. I wouldn't stay to close with her.|`|weaFl9mVaa	I think that your friend is two faced... She's probably jealous and is close to you just to get dirt on you and laugh at you behind your back. I would dump her as soon as possible before she ruins your life!|`|KAp8tSN9aa	Girls can be so mean sometimes!!! I don't know why your friend Amanda would just make something up that Alyssa said, something that detailed. It sucks I know! When I was 13, I had some of my own friends be sooooo mean and bitchy to me!:( It's tough. I would try and spend your energy toward true friends that you really know you can trust. If you have already had a "rough" patch in 6th grade with her and now AGAIN, it's not worth your time honey! There are so many other girlfriends that will treat you better- Im sure of it. Good Luck and know it doesn't get better after high school. :)

For instance, ask her to dance at the first slow dance.  Even if you've already been dancing together to the faster songs, make a big deal of asking to have the dance with her when the first slow song comes on.  Just be a gentleman (hold doors, pull out her chair for her, etc...) and she'll be thrilled.  You can also do flowers without spending too much.  If you go to a florist and tell them exactly how much you have to spend, they will make you something that looks great within your budget, even if your budget is very small.  And make sure you tell her how beautiful she looks when you first see her.  I recommend kissing her hand.|`|e43hjVI6aa	Well since you guys are boyfriend and girlfriend, it should just be obvious that you guys are going together. So whatever you do, she'll be in awe. Ok! So here's what you should do. Don't worry! It's cheap! :]    What you'll need:  -fishing pole, broom, etc. something long you can hold.  -lots of balloons  -large poster board  -permanent marker  -candy, roses, etc. something cute    Okay, so on the poster board, write "Will you go to prom with me?" Tape it onto the fishing pole, or broom or whatever you're gonna use, and blow up all the balloons. Put them around the poster, and don't be afraid to exaggerate! Put it all together and give her some roses (may be expensive) or like her favorite candy or something.

Bride and Groom are getting married here, now.|`|rywgn8HLaa	You can write it like this:    Mr. and Mrs. William Smith  request the honor of your presence  in the marriage uniting their son  Paul Allan Smith  to   Jennifer Marie Taylor  daughter of  Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Taylor    Or here are a few other examples you can look at:  As we shall become one   to share all the days of our   lives...   Mr. and Mrs. Feeney   request the honor of your   presence   at the marriage of their son   Lucas Brooks   to   Patricia Feeney   on the fifth of December   two thousand fourteen   at five o'clock in the evening   Biltmore Resort   19 Biltmore Road   Bellaire, Louisiana     Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Whitlock   request the honour of your presence   at the marriage of their son   Elliot Whitlock   to   Phoebe Luanne   daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Derrick Lee Luanne   Saturday, the twenty-first of June   two thousand fourteen   at one oclock   Heart of the Hills Christian Church   8356 Elmwood Aveune   Rochester, Michigan     Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Holiday   invite you to share in the joy   of the marriage uniting their son   Tucker Allen Holiday   to   Nicole Person   on Saturday, the eleventh of October   two thousand fourteen   The Elizabeth F.

I am serious, there are whole chapters about how to address invitations alone.  Just go, find a wedding book and you'll have everything you need at your finger tips.|`|AA11027952	Are the groom's parents that vain that they need everyone to "understand" that they are footing the bill?  If so then put his name 1st-if not then I say lady's 1st it's just more "gentlemanly".  Maybe a nice toast to the groom's parents at the reception to say "Thanks"-only as long as it is done in a way not to hurt/offend the bride's parents.  I always say it's better to have someone else toot your horn than go around doing it yourself-otherwise you seem self-centered/vain/full of yourself/etc.  Hopefully the future in-laws aren't really that way?!  Good luck to you!|`|AW1dCzH0aa	When the groom's parents give the wedding, it's typically worded:    Mr. and Mrs. James Smith  request the honor of your presence  at the marriage of  Miss Jane Doe  to   their son  John Smith    OR you could include both sets of parents and just put the groom's parents first on the invitation:    Mr. and Mrs. James Smith  and  Mr. and Mrs. John Doe  request the honor of your presence  at the marriage of  Miss Jane Doe  and   Mr. John Smith    Hope that gives you some ideas!|`|DqetlSB6aa	doesn't matter who's paying for it...mention both sets of parents out of respect for both sides. or don't include the parents names at all that way no one feels bad or left out- use you guys names    Together with their parents   Julia Esabella Sanmeters   and   Nicholas Kristoff Demett   request the honour of your presence   at their marriage   on Sunday, the fourth of March   Two thousand and twelve   at six o'clock in the evening   Mount Zion Church   11890 Leaf Avenue   Chicago, Illinois     or    Mr. and Mrs. Tomas Kling   and   Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Langston   invite you to share in the joy   of the marriage uniting their   children   Ashley Marie   and   Patrick Everett   on   Saturday, the eighth of April   at eleven o'clock in the morning   San Bay Yacht Club   42 Burgundy Drive   Los Angeles, California|`|hsZnjZvoaa	I would say   Mr. and Mrs. Groom's parents and  Mr and Mrs. Bride's parents invite you to the wedding of... groom and bride...    OR   Don't mention parent's name - it IS your wedding (the two of you) - so it's irrelevant who pays for it...     Bride and Groom invite you to celebrate our wedding...|`|AA11257038	Maybe you should not write anything new at all. After all, the celebration is for the couple, not the parents. Put the bride's parents first, just like tradition.     The groom's parents wanted and they payed for the whole thing, that does not mean that everyone should knowledge it and treat himself as the groom's parents' guest. It is just mean.|`|kw80YHMLaa	just word it like the traditional way replacing the bride and groom and just put in the brides parents at the end as a type of consultation that they were involved in the planning but did not pay for everything|`|lznoLTZCaa	This site has a lot of options: http://www.mygatsby.com/wordwiz_verse.js...    I am in a similar situation and what I have found is that even when the groom's parents are hosting, the bride should always be given the respect of being mentioned first. Check out the answers I got to a similar question I posted on here a couple of days ago: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

But also it could be that he just really needs a friend. He sees you as someone he can trust and get along with. Maybe give him the benefit of the doubt and just be friends with him. Just because you have a boyfriend doesn't mean you have to give up all your guy friends. Maybe you could introduce your guy friend to some of your girlfriends or do stuff with a group. It sounds a lot like he's craving social time and it's important for people to get that.|`|MEr99qKraa	HE DON'T CARE WHAT HE'S DOING TO U AND UR B/F WHY U CARE ABOUT HIS FEELINGS IS BEYOND ME..Y R U GOING TO DINNER WITH HIM..UR ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE..U NOT HEARD OF THE WORDS ''NO THANK YOU''  YOU GOT UR MAN HE'S GOT HIS GIRL AND NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET..I DON'T BLAME UR B/F 4 NOT LIKING HIM ..U SHUD TRY THE SAME THEN U WON'T HAVE TO ASK WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS..PROBLEM SOLVED AND U NCAN GET ON WITH UR LIFE ..AS THERES NOTHING LIKE PEACE OF MIND

TKf6z1vHaa	I think that you need to be honest with your boyfriend here. Tell him of your indiscretion and then see how he reacts. If he still wants to be with you, then tell him why you ran to your friend. Explain that your craving more intimately. Maybe you could give him suggestions or do some practicing so he can improve. Guys don't like to know that they suck, especially when it comes to sex. What you are feeling with the gay guy is temporary and it will pass. Good luck!|`|FoIxsunVaa	Sex with just about any kind can be made 'wonderful" by feelings. It sounds like you would be second fiddle with your friend if you tried to continue with it.    I am all for free love between consenting adults, but it doesn't sound like you are up for a casual thing with this man. You aren't looking for free love, but that is the MOST this friend has to offer you. I would suggest you break it off (even the friendship) until you have put this infatuation behind you, unless you are ready to be open-ended in your relationships.|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	Your boyfriend is done. He's gone. It's over. You might as well continue with the gay guy.|`|Izv6Qj4caa	omg thats hard..but u dont wnat to lose that friendship..so that tells u the best decision for you..as for your boyfriend..i understand u dont want to hurt his feelings and the best way not to do that is by being real with him and tell him how u feel about the whole situation..|`|1WP3xQNXaa	You fuckedd upp|`|15jfF0tKaa	Ok your mixed up here. STOP  join a youth group and ask the Lord our God for guidance in your prayers.  By the way sexually transmitted diseases are common with multiple partners.

fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You don't have to convince her for any reason.  You tell them you like him because he is a great friend.  Tell them you hate  it when others assume things that are not true.  If they insist on it being more, that is their problem.  They won't believe you no matter what you say.    I believe you.   I was just friends with my current fiance for almost 2 years before we started to date.  It can happen like my story, or you can always have a great friend that doesn't turn into anything else.    Your guy friend will always be there for you, and you know he is a true friend because you don't have to explain things like that to him.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	it doesn't matter girl. if u like him as a friend just say u do don't care what other people say. if ur friend was a REAL best friend then she would stop bugging u. u're probably happy when u hang out with him right? then hang out with him. no one can ruin ur friendship with him just because they say u like him. at least U know u dont.|`|GYJSuTXIaa	You just have to convince her that he is your best guy friend, and if she keeps harassing you about it, perhaps it's just a sign that she might like him, or is jealous of you two.

Do whatever it takes to make them realize that you do not like him, only as a friend.|`|Jlhti4oWaa	Let them think that, they're probably jealous cos you have a best boy bud.    As long as your boy bud knows you don't fancy him!  Just say to your best friend 'Listen, I don't fancy him, and I'm getting fed-up with everyone thinking that I do! Why can't I have a guy friend without everyone thinking I fancy him?!'     I know how you feel. :P|`|7afepwi8aa	Just slap them....|`|kZhswli6aa	You could try not hanging around him so much, just to give the feel you don't like him. OR! you could tell everyone you like someone else. You could also try having a serious talk with your fiend and say that if you think i like this guy, you're wrong, and if you think i do, ad you tease me about it anymore, i don't think we can be friends because that's not what friendship is about.    I really hope this helps! i went through the same thing freshman year, and i told them i like someone at a DIFFERENT school and they totally backed off. But you cannot hang around him very often for the time being.|`|y2jzL4Waaa	Well it seems as though you have a really great relationship with this guy   and maybe your friend just see's it as a way for you to get a guy . she may be tryign to help or she may just be trying to be annoying im pretty sure she might just want you to find the right guy .    you never know maybee in time he could be ;)    you could just tell her , look okayy he is a best friend i want to stay that way and explain to her how its annoying you that she is always asking you if you like him or not .. if you explian this to her she may then understand how annoying it is to keep goiing on about it  xx    Good luck with it all :)|`|jxoZdce7aa	look them in the face and tell her you do not like him and say we are just best guy friends and its really bothering me that you keep telling me this so can you please stop

bwa9hhSpaa	I get like this with my best friend. Sometimes i love being around her and sometimes i wish she would just go away. Little things annoy me about her and which ends up like you - tension building. When i get like this i hang out more with my other friends, i still talk to her but not such in depth. Then after a few days you should feel like you want to hang out again. It works with me. If not maybe there's something bothering you about her. Like something shes done to you or someone else.    I hope everything works out|`|HcBp3cFDaa	hey.  i think my bff is sick of me.  ya know i kinda need a break from her 2.  so you should just take a break.  don't take it so personal. just relax, don't text them as often. don't hang out with them as often. cus blatently, that makes anyone sick if they have to hang out with the same person all day.      xxx|`|9NDKAGLqaa	i have been in that situation before but it worked out because i talked to her about it...we just stopped being around each other as much as we use to but we are still friends|`|r7eJhJvVaa	you just need to see each other a bit less i think.

Good luck.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	I actually think you are being really mean to this friend, she has probably valued you as a good friend, and then you say you have grown sick of this person. What you mean really is that you think you are better than this person now, although at one time you probably envied her and wanted to be like her. You should be ashamed, to turn your back on your good friend like that. Some of our friends irritate us at sometime in our lives but you do not turn you're back on her. I bet you're new friends will not be as loyal as her.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	i didn't have a situation like this. maybe she might do the same to u and then it may work out. if not just bring a friend to her that u think she will really like and then see if they will hang out. if they do she may forget about u!!|`|CeyuSMT9aa	no... no i haven't. but sometimes i am with my friends.|`|GYJSuTXIaa	I have. And all you can do is just take some space from this person for a short while.  I know, that right now you probably feel like you and this person will never be friends again (you will always be sick of her)  but all you have to do, is just not be around each other so frequently and soon enough, you will find that urge to hangout with them again.  But this is only if the person we are talking about is a close friend, otherwise it might just mean you two weren't meant to be friends or something. Well good luck.
mXIVMmPSaa	You're absolutely right in feeling bad! It really has nothing to do with the size of the ring and everything to do with his thoughtlessness. Engagement rings should be given from the heart, with a lot of consideration for the woman receiving it and her tastes and feelings. Budget doesn't really matter in that regard, you can still find beautiful rings (maybe with a different stone or antiques) in any price range.     The point is that it seems he treated the proposal and ring as an afterthought to his own selfishness, getting the cheapest possible thing that "gets the job done" while buying more expensive toys for himself. That screams "self-centered jerk" to me. Is it this just an anomaly or does he usually put himself and his interests first in the relationship? If he has a history of being inconsiderate of you and prioritizing himself first, I would seriously rethink marrying him (or at least a long long engagement), because this pattern will continue in your marriage. "Here's your anniversary present, dear- a spatula! Oh, yeah, and I bought myself an ipod yesterday."    You need to bring this up with him, otherwise you'll be simmering with resentment. Personally, I would call him out on it, not by asking "Why did you get me a tiny ring?" but "Why didn't you put any thought into it? Why did your prioritize your toys/"needs" over me?" If he claims you're being materialistic or greedy, point out the fact that it isn't about the size, but the lack of consideration since it seems he cares a lot more about himself and his entertainment than you and your relationship. Where your money is, there your heart will be also.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Honestly, I would feel bad.  If i knew he could have gotten something better.  If you love him it shouldn't matter but i would still feel bad.  I got to pick out my own ring thankfully and i chose a smaller stone than he would have gotten.|`|AA10045620	I would feel bad, too.  Especially since he just spent all that money on himself and those things will eventually wear out, whereas your ring will last a lifetime.|`|AA11027952	Do you love him?  Do you want to spend the rest of your life w/ him?  Well if so then the ring doesn't matter.  I'm not going to tell you if it's ok to feel bad or not-that's up to you and how you really feel.  Been w/ my guy many, many yrs. (highschool sweethearts)-married for most of the many yrs. and the ring he gave me was by no means huge or expensive by most standers, but I love it because it came from him.  You need to decide what's most important to you-none of us can tell you that or how to feel about it.  Plus if you want to you can always "use" this to your advantage later on-even yrs. from now:).....just kidding or am I?!  Good luck.  One more thought atleast no one can say you don't have an honest guy there!|`|i41tUVtIaa	I think I would be really pis ed if my finance' did this.  But if you really love him it will not matter.  I would point it out to him that he was thinking more of himself because he spend less on something for you so he could get himself something.  Tell him this is supposed to be a symbol of his love to you and him chosing himself over you shows how he really feels.  Also, most men think this way and there is nothing you can do about it.  In years down the road it will not matter what your ring looks like but I would have still been mad if mine did this to me.  I do think my feelings would be hurt too.|`|0AShsMsoaa	that is called a red flag.  that is the way he will always treat you.  why? cause he knows he can get away with it.      x box?  when you marry you will drive a junker car but he will buy a brand new boat.  or two.      he has set a price for you.  if you value yourself more than he does, if you put a higher price on yourself than him, think long and hard about the symbolism of what he did.  at the least, you MUST get premarital counseling, so you can root out other attitudes he has that work well for him, but are horrible, humiliating, embarrasssing, and hurtful for you.    when i was dating years ago, i noticed if a guy had only a dollar to spend on us.  i didnt care if it was a dollar or a thousand dollars, i dated lots of guys, and my observation is how he divided up what he had.  if he had a dollar and a pizza slice was 50 cents, and, he bought both of us one, that was great.  if he bought himself two and offered me a bite, that was not good.  if he had only 50 cents and a pizza slice was 50 cents, and before he ate he bought me the only pizza slice the 50 cents would buy, and gave it to me with a smile,  i would live with that guy in a cardboard box and follow him and love him forever.    that is a true keeper.  that is true love.|`|w1necKzYaa	What a cheap skate!|`|76db084b0636ae593b0b3c0e95cb3838aa	It kind of depends I mean if you live together then the television and the xbox are kind of for both of you anyway...for your home, maybe?|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I think you have every right to feel bad.  A wedding ring doesn't have to be huge or expensive, it is a token of love.  BUT, the amount spent on a ring should show that your partner sacrificed to buy you something that you could cherish for the rest of your life.  It sounds like the money he spent on your ring was an afterthought.  That would upset me too!  I'd talk to him about it.  Make sure he knows that it's not that he didn't spend a fortune on your ring... it's that he spent a fortune on himself and NOT on something you will wear for the rest of your life.  Good luck with that, that surely will not be a fun conversation.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I think that if your upset you should talk to him, although the ring isnt what makes your marriage, but when your engaged your suppose to me on cloud 9 and smiling, your upset about your ring, to me that sounds like a bad start.   The up side, he has time to save up for your wedding ring, no one says you have to wear your engagement ring and your wedding band, tell him to save up his money and when your wedding day comes get yourself the ring you want, and just tuck your engagement ring away.  I was on the other hand very shocked at my ring, it was much more then I was expecting it to be,, but personally, if it was fake and cost 10 dollors, I really dont think I would have cared, the ring is only the material proof were engaged|`|5TLGa3awaa	I think he let you know what his priorities are.  I lot of people will tell you "it's the thought that counts".  And that's the problem here, it doesn't seem like he thought much about it at all.  It seems like he's relying on the "as long as it comes from me then she'll love it" school of thought.  I can understand how it's hurtful.  An engagement ring is something you'll wear for the rest of your life.  He could have saved up and gotten his toys in the future.  I had a similar experience (not with an engagement ring though) and it was hard to get over it.  You should feel as if you're important to the person that you're going to be spending the rest of your life with.  I guess think about the big picture.  Is this a regular occurrence?  Does he normally think about his needs first?  Has he been an inconsiderate bf?  If so, then take it as a sign and have a very long engagement.  It sounds like he has some growing up to do.  If this is the first time something like this has happened then have a talk with him and let him know that it hurt that it seemed that he bought your ring with whatever money he had left over.  I know men are men and don't always understand how women feel about certain things but if he loves you he'll get the point.  Good luck!|`|di6p10Ifaa	I would probably feel bad too. Guys have a way of being selfish when it comes to electronics. For example...my fiance took me out to eat for my birthday, which we do often for date night anyway and that was it. That would not have been a big deal until he said, I think i am going to get this sega dream cast I found on ebay. Ya I thought he was broke...we had a huge fight about it yada yada yada, we are good now. That is just how some men are. they don't do it intentionally they just think that minimum will satisfy us sometimes.|`|DqetlSB6aa	knowing he bought an lcd screen and an xbox...id say Hell Yes.  he was being cheap, only caring about what he wanted.  sounds like after he bought his xbox and tv he used the change to buy your ring.  id say something to him.  normally id say be thankful-but he obviously had the money and chose to make himself happy other than you.|`|AA11104372	What I would feel bad about is that he's buying TVs and video game systems when he's broke.  Does that sound like the kind of guy you want for the father of your children?  "Sorry, hon.  I couldn't buy diapers because I spend all our money on concert tickets."|`|hlW13yCWaa	THis depends on you really. Have ever said something about not spending too much money on you. If you did it might have made him think you didnt want such a big ring.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	I can understand how you feel, and I would be a little upset too.  Not because he got a small ring, but because he was much more concerned with getting his toys.  You should have made him sweat a little!  It seems like he knew you would say yes so he figured he didn't have to try.  It's not the size of the ring that matters, but it does matter that he shows you that he treasures you and that it's worth more to him to have you be his wife than to get a new TV.  Talk to him about it.  Just make sure you explain very clearly exactly why you're upset so he doesn't think it's just because you want a big diamond to show off.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I would be a bit bitter because when you get engaged and married you have to think about the other person's needs too not just your own.  He doesn't seem to be there yet, hope it's a long engagement.  Talk to him about it.|`|lznoLTZCaa	Your feelings are perfectly normal. I'd feel bad too if my fiance spent $1000 on himself and $100 on me. A TV and an Xbox break over time and get replaced, an engagement ring is supposed to be forever.       That being said, I don't know if I would mention it to him though. I think I would feel embarrassed to. But if you are really unhappy with it, maybe you should. Maybe you can tell him the ring is not really your style and you would like to exchange it, and then when you are at the store you can point to a bigger one and say "Oh my god, that one is just gorgeous." Ask to try it on and then see how he reacts. Maybe he will pay the difference so you can have the one you like.     Good luck.|`|pk8uOZiqaa	I don't blame you for feeling bad either.  I think that the ring is important because you are going to be wearing it for the rest of your life.  I am sure you love him a lot so that is not even the issue and you aren't trying to be greedy but every girl wants a nice ring to show off and I believe they deserve it.    I would talk to him about it without being insulting maybe he just does not realize what the ring means to you.  Maybe when you go to chose your wedding bands you can upgrade it a little without hurting his feelings.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I know it's not the size of the ring that counts, but what would make me upset is that he thought of himself first. AND that he told you that he could have gotten a bigger one but didn't. That would really, really upset me b/c it means that he did think about it and decided that I wasn't worth it.|`|XtLZXIEyaa	I would feel bad if a guy gave me a ring that looks like it came out of a Cracker Jack box especially after he spent money on expensive gifts for himself.    Edit:  He still sounds like an IDIOT!
V0muobgFaa	Say that you'll get a job to pay for it.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	a kids maturity is judged by the way they act and their handle responsibilities|`|lidzMiG9aa	I suppose you can say it is for emergencies. But then again you have to be careful on who you are giving your number too.|`|BdDRkt7eaa	Personally, I never got a cell phone until just this year, and I'm seventeen already. I never particularly wanted one, and I don't really use it for anything more than calling to check on the bus.     Phones are more important because you can use them in emergencies, not for picking up guys. Also, sometimes, the bills for cell phones can be quite high, especially if there is a stream of calls and text messages going in and out all the time.    If you want a phone so badly, you should save up for it. At least partially. Then you can tell your parents that since you've saved up all the money, you should be able to buy the phone on your own. The one problem might be that you might have to pay all the bills yourself, but consider it a maturing process.    Be careful who you give your number to. Not every one is a good person.
Leda2ha0aa	I would keep talking with him but don't tell him of your feelings.  He does have a girlfriend and if that relationship goes in the tank, then he will in some way let you know.  You should never try to pursue someone when they already have someone in their lives.  He seems to be interested in you, but wait until he says that he's broken up before doing anything.  Good luck.|`|ooRxjLXcaa	I think he likes you. But wait till he is available then go get him!|`|7j1wVBxzaa	friendsSorry for asking in this section but this is the place I can get mature answers      I like a guy in my college a lot. He never used to talk to anyone in class, but ever time he entered the class all the girls would look at him because he is good looking. One day he sat next to me and he started talking, and i liked talking to him. In the middle of conv she asked me if I am a shy person and I said yes. The second time we meet again we had a nice time talking but he told me about his gf.    I like his personality a lot and we have lot in common, but I do not want to tell him that I like him bc he has a gf.    I never liked anyone like this, never wanted to have a bf till I met him. I don't know wht to do now. :(. I like him but can't tell him because he has a gf. Whenever he sees me, he totally ignores whatever he was doing or talkig to and talks 2 me. What sld I do?|`|qo2P3OoPaa	It sounds like he likes you, he probably is attracted to your personality a lot if you guys have a lot in common. However he does have a gf so just be nice when it comes to her and wait for them to fall apart, and in the mean time just try to get to know him better and get closer. If he relay likes you it will work out someday.. just dont rush things let it workout how its going to.. but yea it does sound like he likes you.|`|b5UV15gCaa	You may want to tell him you are interested in him in a sly way. Like "If you didn't have a girlfriend I would ask you to lunch." or something like that. What ever you do don't get involved if he still has the girlfriend... If he would do that to her he will do it to you.|`|mKCiofUFaa	Becareful, dont get hurt...just treat him like a friend. Being too close when you have feelings for a guy who has a girlfriend whom he's suppose to love is very dangerous.|`|3zOtSsoNaa	i guess he is feeling you too,tell him how you feel.
8XKmMBU7aa	Why people depends on others.  Why they finding mistake in others.  Why they can't see their own week points.  Why they can't take their childs with him/herself.  Go anywhere with your sons. What need to send them in other house.  You may stay anywhere like cemetery, Streets, footpath, religious place etc.  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Basically you are paying double and taking care of your kids. You need to be firm and let him know that you are doing a lot and he is taking advantage of this situation. There's no need to end a relationship because of this. You just need to work together.   If you can't go out because of your kids, have your friends over. Make dinner and have a girls night. You don't always have to go out you know. Then you can star by making short trips outside while he takes care of the kids. Like go to the grocery store, which will take like an hour and he will babysit for an hour.   The highlight of the issue isn't you not being able to go out...it's rather him not taking responsibilities for his kids. So yeah go out for errands and tell him you will be right back...that way you can train him to be more responsible. And if he is being possessive and won't let you go out...then you need SERIOUS talking.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	So what if he takes the kids to his "mum". If you want to go out, and the kids arew ell cared for, I would think it would be okay. At least he's working and helping pay soem bills. It doesn't have to be exactly even does it? You are only going to get half his check for child support, no matter how many kids you have, so you better do the math if its a money thing.|`|M06c7GU6aa	He sounds like..a loser, no offense. Only being able to pay half the rent? And he doesn't even want to take care of his own kids? I would leave his *** and find someone else..someone who actually can make your life more joy full. He seems to just be holding you back greatly.|`|sUMuJjZlaa	sounds a bit like me, my partner left me when i was 6months pregnant and i was gutted but i paid for the majority of everything and always felt like i was hard done by and that he was taking advantage..when i put this to him he upped and left me even tho we were due to get married. its a year on and our son is 9 months old and he doesnt bother with him or pay anything. its really hard on your own im not gonna lie but i suspect in my situation it would be even harder living with a man like that, so its up to you what you can tolerate, he made the decision for me so it was out of my control but now everthing is left up to me and in a sense its easier when u r on your own as you cant expect anything from someone who isnt there. only you can decide really what you want to do, i knwo if he had stayed i probably|`|zHwlGhIAaa	it sounds to me like you are with a very selfish man and you are being a single mother.  he should have some responsiblity of the kids.  he should have more sense then to buy stuff for himself and not for his family.  i think in this situation he is selfish and immature.  his mom is raising his son? this man takes no responsibility for his own life and his family and that seems like a major problem to me.|`|r7eJhJvVaa	Never cheated?  breath of fresh air.    Stay with this man ,he wants you to stay in, because he wants to keep you and is a bit insecure.    Talk about it, at the right time, is the answer.    Don't destroy  a family unit .    All couples have the same problems in early marriage.    I was terrible, but now i can't wait for my wife to go out Lol.    Because i have grown up a bit and am not insecure.    You may end up splitting the family up and then ending up with a real nutter.    Stick at it, that's the test of character and strength.    The grass often looks greener on the other side but it may end up being straw.      Stay loyal and you will always be able to hold your head high and be respectful.    Good luck.
6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	No.   And I don't get vexed about "stupid" questions, either.  I either help the asker to  think, or provide my best answer.  You might minimize conflict by defining you priorities and focusing on them.   I suppose you could flatter the aggravated H/W by constantly remarking how clever they are and how much you rely on their knowledge, insight, wisdom, and capability (but don't lay it on too thick!)    And you could try to think of the answers a little longer before asking the questions.  Or you could ask why being asked questions upsets the other (e.g don't they really want to help - or are they so uneasy about their own mentality that being asked questions alarms them - etc).   And/or you could quietly, patiently, but firmly point out that having an aggravated spouse that treats you like an impatient parent is not the best basis for an adult relationship - and that is the only relationship you will accept.   It can be surprising how alarming Napoleons, male or female, can find the prospect of having to run their own lives without the supports (physical, psychological, and food-wise) to which they've become accustomed.    Some people need to belittle others in order to feel self-confident.   It does nobody any good, including themselves.   Boys just have to grow up some time - and so do girls.   By the way, I never avoid anything - I simply develop my strategy, pick my own grounds, time and place, and put the ball in play.   Never do anything on impulse when it comes to people!  It only enlists you into their game.|`|wcp1uvgtaa	Try not asking any questions for a while. Maybe he'll get the point, though I doubt it. Those "stupid questions" are remnants of mothering behavior. You need to remind yourself that your husband is not your child. Or is he?|`|zrFzbDHUaa	My husband thinks it is cute when I ask stupid questions. Verbal lashing sucks for any reason./|`|fx6pNJ5saa	Every question I ask is stupid...I'm immune to put downs.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	If my husband told me I asked "stupid questions" I'd tell him that normal couples communicate. If that's how he communicates he could use a good dose of counseling.|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	In trouble?  No.  I don't get "in trouble" with my husband for anything.  (And I doubt you do, either.  I bet it is just a curious choice of words).    My husband and I both ask each other stupid questions once in a while.  Stupid questions usually are answered with an extremely exaggerated goofy, "DuH."      We're not above laughing at each other or ourselves.  It works for us.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	It depends on how the question is asked.  My wife has a tendency to ask simple questions in an exasparated way that drives people nuts - she knows this, though and has changed it.  The standup comic, Louis C.K., has a great skit where he talks about how he was asked to load the dishwasher.  Well, he did, and he put soap in, but forget to run the dishes.  His wife asks, "Why didn't you turn on the dishwasher?"  Why??  Why??  To a man, that question is really insulting, because it assumes we have a reason!  We just blew it.  We forgot.  Oops!      Simple statements that don't have emotionally built in accusations are the best way to communicate with guys.  "Could you load the dishes?" instead of, "Why are there still dirty dishes sitting around?" or "Doesn't anyone want a clean house besides me?" are the best ways to communicate.|`|VEwpTOROaa	i ask stupid questions all the time,he never get mad  and if he ever got mad it would be only if he was very very stressed at he s job,so when he yell at me,i would yell back  "back off do not talk to me like that!!!"  and i will bring up all the good things i do to him and the way i get thanked  and he s friend who take advantage of him and he still treats him good  loooool complicated but he never yell at stupid questions|`|aXYiOskmaa	1 - i can't "get in trouble" from my husband for anything.i'm not a child and he isn't my father.   2 - i don't understand the rest of your question. avoid what?|`|nkmwGAKjaa	That is my husband's forte. I am a gal of a few words. Maybe he was just having a bad day.  A verbal lashing however is totally uncalled for!|`|AA11990465	My husband asks me stupid questions constantly and it is SO annoying. I try to just bite my tongue and turn my cheek, but occasionally I'll find myself snapping at him for not observing what is obvious. Do I think it's fair? No, not really, but sometimes it's just unavoidable.|`|LZzsDARUaa	better ask then do it the wrong way.....that would be my response if he call the question stupid|`|GHd84xipaa	first there is no stupid question.if you don't know something then you are stupid for not asking.no a verbal lashing is not fair for asking a question.hey you can't know everything and the only way to find out you ask.|`|G6yyceAxaa	not married, but my girlfriend will often ask a question and I will answer it, but she ask the same question later, used to drive me nuts and I would get mad, but now, I just ignore the second asking. now I am sane and it drives her nuts|`|AA11736322	NO and never whatever i say he has to listen and whatever i say he has to think over it coolly.|`|sK3qibRwaa	I am not yet married!
T8Op8jYxaa	In what way looked at her? If he brushes against you, that's more than looking isn't it?    Make sure you talk to your friend whether you'd like to date this guy, if you both like him things could get awkward.
7D6817LFaa	no, she hates you.  DUH!!!! that means she wants to hang out     geez, slow much .. haha
6C5NDSBSaa	That is EXACTLY how I feel about my cousin Mark. I have done everything in the world for him and he is one of those people that is so charming and so goofy that you just can't be mad at him no matter how hard you try. I have even gone to the extreme of moving in with him and cleanin his house and basically baby sitting him. I woke him up every morning so he could make it to work on time and I cleaned up behind him. He is an alcoholic and I did everything I could to make sure he made it to his AA meetings and stayed away from any alcohol whatsoever. I drove him everywhere when his license got revoked. <br>  Now, he is off  probation and is with a girl that is really sweet and everything, but she lets him walk all over her and it makes me sooo mad. He lets her pay for everything and now he's drinking again. I have built up a lot of resentment towards him for his ways. The last time I saw him he was drunk out of his mind and looked like hell. It hurts and angers me to know all that I've done for him and its like it doesn't even matter.|`|AA11733625	Yes... I most certainly do and I find myself hurt, angry, frustrated, annoyed and certainly resenting on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  But I know this person is not going to change any time soon. So I had to make the decision to distance myself from this person as best I can and not depend on them or count on them for anything. I am cival and friendly when they call.. but for everything else.. I have distanced myself.<br>  <br>  It is hell... when someone you love doesn't show you the respect you have earned and deserve...|`|TcMa4a7paa	Yep, I sure do.  Actually, she is not a relative but she is my best friend.  She is "Catholic" and announces over and over that she is abstaining from eating meat today (Ash Wednesday) and Fridays during Lent. But I have never, in five years of being friends with her, seen her attend mass or practice any other sacraments...  Not one time.  I am not Catholic, but attend church every Sunday.  I do try to live my life daily and quietly as a Christian but do not wear a neon sign every Sunday morning that says, "Hey everybody!  Look at me!  I am going to church!"  I love her to death, but it annoys me that every year she makes that announcement every single Friday during Lent about not eating meat yet never makes the effort to attend mass.<br>  <br>  As far as your relative is concerned, don't offer to pay when it is for something that just involves the two of you.  Just tell her you have no money this time.|`|nCWjdyddaa	When you are dealing with someone who tends to take advantage, the best thing to do is to set boundaries. She can't rip the money out of your purse, or she'll end up in jail. She can only take what you give her. So, determine what you're comfortable with, and say no to the rest. Then you won't have to feel resentful.<br>  <br>  For instance, if she always lets you pay for dinner, the next time she says she wants to go, tell her point blank BEFORE YOU LEAVE, "I'm kind of low on money tonight, so you'll have to pay for your own." She may give you the hurt puppy look the first couple of times, but she'll get over it. Then, when you do treat her to something, you won't feel like you're being coerced.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think to some degree we do, it maybe the one who is boasting all the time, the attention getter, the drunk, etc.  It makes it hard when it's a relative, who you have had very strong ties with.  You didn't come to love her because of these habits, these habits were formed over the time.  But as we grow older and we are instilled with rights and wrongs we start to see the world differently and the people in it.  But someone not paying to make her own way is inconsiderate to say the least, letting someone else give her a fee ride.  When you lose respect for someone there is a reason and your brain is telling you to protect yourself against this person.  The best you can do is sit down with her and let her know what's happening with you and that you will have to exclude her if she doesn't change.  It will be for your own health, for those things that wear on us take a part of away.  good luck
0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Since she just assumed she was going to be a bm and not actually ever asked, maybe your friend could find another job for her to do and ask her to do that (cake server, guest book, hand out programs, etc.) When asked to do the other job, this would get the point across that she's not a bm.     If that won't do, just explain to her that due to budget constraints (whether this is accurate or not), she is only able to have four bm's and are going to ask other people who are special to her to help out with other tasks.     Of course, it is two years away, so your friend could just say that she hasn't picked out her bridal party yet. A lot of things happend in two years and it may not even be necessary to bring it up. Good luck.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	a lot will change in your lives in that 2 years.  do not say anything.  tell the future bride to shut her mouth too...|`|FVFxE6owaa	The bride should wait to pick out her attendants.  Two years is a long time and it's very possible that she won't even marry this guy.      You are all very childish.  You say this girl is a bit younger than you so she will be way too young to be a bridesmaid...well, your friend is way too young to even think about getting married.|`|sMUiGFPraa	You don't say anything. It's not your place. The bride needs to make that decision and tell her in person. you should have no part in it what so ever.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Rather than invite needless drama, why doesn't your friend just not say anything aobut her bridesmaids at all.  Two years is a long time, and it is possible she will not be marrying this man OR be friends with this girl by then anyway.    Childish needless drama.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	This is so wonderful!!!.WHY BECAUSE IT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM!!!....the bride will have to make those decisions and she is the one that will have to tell the other girls...i just wouldn't make a big deal out of it...if you were not chosen does that mean you are less best friends with the bride?????...i don't think so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... that's not going to change anything ...but being in her wedding will make your friendship bond closer...i think you need to relax and not get your panties in a bundle over this...it's really no big deal...but is the status quot....for some..what if you just supported her and said i will be their for you no matter what you decide...BECAUSE I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Its two years away she doesnt need to be saying who her bridesmaids are officially until all the planning starts that way shes not being bothered by people asking if they can, heck i had to look hard for three of mine because no one wanted to be part of my wedding and i had to convince them to do it, pretty sad really when your own family and friends dont want anything to do with your big day really|`|12ORrojXaa	if there is not even a definate date for the wedding i would suggest she (your friend) say nothing....i definately don't think you should get involved in telling her (the younger friend) since it's not your wedding or your place to tell her.  i would suggest to your friend that "is going to get married in like 2 years," not make her decisions now....believe me things and people change....and she has no idea where she will be in her life and who will be in it!  i remember when i was in highschool and even the beginning of college i just knew who would be in my wedding....and, when i got married only 2 of them were bridesmaids....this all seems strange to me......are you more worried about this than your "bestest friend?"|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	DO not say anything to anyone about who is in the wedding party and who isn't, there is a lot of time from now and two years, things change, people change, and stuff happens, DO NOT say anything until at least another year    Take it from me, I regret saying someone could be in my wedding party, I should have just waited, I know you get excited, but resist and if people ask , say I am going to take some time and will decide later who will be in my party.|`|tc2FjM68aa	tell her that your friend only wants four and that you are sorry but she is not going to be a bridesmaid.  Try and find another way for her to be involved such as guest boot attendant if you still want her involved.|`|MSmo6C7paa	just tell her that you can only afford to have a couple of bridesmaids, and she has chosen you because your a really close friends,   tell her she can help with the wedding but she cant afford to have more than four.|`|4dwzZyvsaa	Well, you can lie to her and say that your best friend already has 4 brides maids. or you can just spit it out and say that there are more things in life than just being a brides maid. Trust me, there will be more weddings coming around. Then when your other friend gets married, she would probably not choose one of you guys for her brides maids but that's okay. Everything would be even.
eb51b2a5d9553593735e2748c3c6f209aa	oooh this is not easy.. I think I will try to work this out if i really wanted to be with him, but spend less time with him, see my friends more. Like a fresh start, another way to work this relationship. For example, try a day in the week to see him, dont be too pushy, let him to chase you, and slooowly re-build this relationship. I know you want this to work, and for that reason, dont be too much often after him, let him to miss you. It's' going to be hard because you used to be in touch all the time with him, but try to force yourself to NOT contact him first. yes sometimes, but not always you. Explain to hi, that you want to find a way to have more fun in your relationship with him, to avoid "la routine". I hope it will help you sweetie. let me know!!! xxx|`|fqboOITjaa	I'm afraid I was going to say you should leave him. How can you stay with somebody who isn't sure they want to be with you? I know that sounds harsh but I've been in that situation before and if he's saying he's not sure then he's not happy in the relationship. <br>  <br>  Take some time for yourself to reevaluate what YOU want. You're in the relationship too, what's the point in waiting around to see if he wants you.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	He is not sure what he wants, he is fine as long as you are there and then when he isn't he doesn't want to be with you.  <br>  <br>  You are adamant that you are going to work through this but neither of you have a life outside the other.  You should be able to go and see your friends and not worry that he is suddenly going to dump you.

U will laugh later on in life if u can get over this embarassing moment for both of u.|`|XR3SPPCVaa	Doesn't seem like you took advantage of her at all. It seems like you both made the decision together to make out and I'm sure you both had fun doing it. There is no one to blame so don't feel guilty. Just enjoy life and be happy that you guys did that and you're still friends, be glad it didn't ruin your friendship because it could have. You have nothing to feel bad about so smile would ya?! :-)|`|FU07SiQEaa	blahhhh!|`|eJJwALuZaa	hey if you had fun it's ok.|`|KATCMfLSaa	you rly didnt do anything wrong move on and just kinda pretend like it didnt happpen|`|WXwJnhybaa	if she dont seem sad or depressed then i say dont even trip. if she wasn't ok i think you wud be able to tell .so chill. hope i helped. good luck =)|`|MtDkSw8waa	no it was a mutal mistake. you were drunk too but you should still talk to her about how you feel and make sure she isnt upset|`|IGpCFPWsaa	its whatever. just move on it was  just a little fun.|`|D10tLM5uaa	since you were BOTH drunk,its ok|`|pbkXFhfkaa	ahh! thats a problem. but dont regret it. just move onn.|`|363YPQ62aa	Don't worry just tell her that you both were drunk and your sorry|`|xbjc2yzOaa	Just act like nothing happened, still be chill with her and idk just kind of go along with her smoking i guess|`|5akokd0Faa	you need to sit down and be a man and face up to it and talk to her about this. its the only way to stop feeling guilty|`|8LEPfGoBaa	no, its normal, but if u like her than u should do sumthin. Ask the girl is she ok, and if she's ok yall can just move on.|`|rKwpoU7Raa	No now if you had sex with her it would be different because you knew she was drunk but all you did was make out with her which is innocent so i wouldnt worry about it. Talk to her and see how she feels about it.|`|BiSuCnMUaa	you both were drunk so I don't think it's considered as you took advantage of her !   If you care just call her and talk with her about what you feel she probably feels the same as you do I think :)   GOODLUCK|`|1bQgBhgaaa	Don't feel bad, What was happened that day was mutual and both of you were drunk.....Just talk with her and tell her about your feelings.|`|qlguz6vyaa	If she's smoking she's probably trying to impress you. If it's awkward between you two, I doubt it's because she's ashamed of it. It would be better if we knew how old you were so we could interpret it a bit better.|`|aT5J358Taa	If you both wanted it don't feel guilty!
XLGEwLrqaa	either shes confused...  or being a real ******...  try leaving it alone for a while and see wat she does...  maybe u need to give her some space...  after all you guys dont go out sooo noo biggy unless u really like her...  try it...
LJDiSCCNaa	it has occured to me that when a relationship ends, it's largely due to the expectations of one or both persons towards the other. This 'let down' causes the problem and then one or both try to change the other's personality. When one changes and the other doesn't appreciate it- often times resentment occurs. Once resentment occurs, the love and tender feelings start to wain.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	40 - 60%    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|V1i6c9qMaa	It depends on this situation that ended the relationship...|`|losGznxMaa	50% of the time|`|AA11029380	It's seldom just one persons fault or cause.  Maybe not totally 50-50 but not 100% either.|`|zRTEvp4oaa	it depends did one of u do something to hurt the other? but its 50 50|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	Its always 50/50. If you two don't have chemistry than a relationship is not going to work.|`|YjXmuKuPaa	that depends on what occurred for the relationship to not develop or for it to not work out|`|gT1sWhgpaa	I think that any relationship that does not work out is a 50-50 fault..That's why communication is always the best key.
C8DOT8Y7aa	One Sec.,..............|`|KXiwLOtOaa	well you told her no so she is working on moving on .....as you should|`|NTWZ4rBsaa	SHE LIKES YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... and she wants to see if you are into her so she is waiting for you to text her back!!!!|`|yuwIUlHLaa	well, she probably feels like she's being too clingy...  you rejected her  you never initiate the conversation  you always end the conversation first  i mean, she wants to talk to you but she's probably not getting the vibe that you feel the same, so she's decided to wait to see how much you care about her and try to not seem desperate  text her boy!|`|P0cWf6OHaa	she oblviously likes you!  cos i had a guy friend that texted me everyday and than stopped so i started the convo a few times and yea but than he stopped replying so i stopped cos i dont wanna seem desperate    so she prolly just doesnt wanna seem desperate. lol|`|8V1loJ6daa	I think she wants you to chase after her. Not literally i mean like she wants you to talk to her first. She doesn't like always texting you first. So text her! :)
TShsb3EXaa	Wait it out..

IZ1ZZHyCaa	He must b GAY hahahahahaha!!! if he got mad...IDK|`|	Move on.|`|	If he hasn't gotten mad already why are you assuming he will and then asking a question about it?|`|	I don't know, if he doesn't like you then he wouldn't want to hurt you're feelings if he likes you as a friend I guess. I don't know why they would get mad if they did like you though! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|	don't worry. i know this may seem totally awkward and everything but it's not as bad as it seems. he is really the one who played with your feelings so you are the one to be mad. he is honestly in no position to be mad. he might ignore you for some time which can be hard. but hey! rather have it the honest straightforward way than in a sneaky using you way.   answer mine please  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|	he wasn't mad.. he just had to think if he wanted to go out with you, maybe he was thinking if he wants to go out with you, when you put guys on the spot, they aren't always positive if they want to be with you. Maybe he didn't want to hurt your feelings.|`|	idk either, there is this guy i dated who is so hot. and everyone wants to date him, and i got to. the only girl to date him! noone else has and he just broke up with me. its mainly because they are nervous....well in my case, when 2 stoners date, one is high, one isnt, you fight....lol. he is immature, just let him grow up.|`|	i think he's not mad, i think he's just not interested and now he's just trying to avoid you because its kinda awkward    please answer mine....  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|	Awe sorry to hear that! High school guys can be assholes, and if he's being a dick to you, then he totally doesn't deserve you and if you wait a bit, you'll find someone better then that tool. If he's giving you the cold shoulder on Monday, then give it to him back!  Unless of course he's really shy, then I'd suggest in not giving up...|`|	well i think that if he's mad at u, or ignore u, just move on. There r plenty more guys out there.

pbkXFhfkaa	duh she likes you!! If she talks to you about personal things like that!! But maybe thats just the kind of person she is? It really depends.. I would have to know her personally to decide whether or not she likes you. But Im pretty sure she does!! :))  Hope I helped! [:
2ea7f508e5ceee425b8e39e2ee78ab82aa	i think you should take her somewhere that just screams romantic. Be smooth and just share your thoughts about things other than the office;) that way you get her mind off work and on you. she likes you or she would not be having this" lets get together" lunch again with you, so just be a real gentleman, no roses or flowers yet.|`|363YPQ62aa	Don't try and change the date let it be and see where things go you don't want to scare her if all go's well asked her out for a nice dinner date|`|xgz60izBaa	If you are able to choose the restaurant, choose one thats kinda romantic but don't over do it.  Just play it cool on this first date to see if she seems interested in you.  Talk her up, if she talks freely to you then proceed to ask her (at the end of the lunch) if she would like to get together some time.  If she says yes or hints at the possibility, then go from there and try to nail it down to a specific day.  If she doesn't seem interested then just drop it and don't appear desperate.  Trying to FORCE it will make you look like a stalker.  Just play it cool and act confident, like you don't need her.
9yFdxmHwaa	No. Every girl has the same dream. The thing is, how much do you want to wait for this dream to be true?    See, life is like a bus ride. You have to catch the bus to your destination. You get at the bus stop early, you would have to wait. If you arrive late, you miss the bus.     Only event here is the bus ride. You'll have to wait as everybody else. So, stop being scared. You'll get your prince.    Meanwhile, have you looked among frogs? I hear they hide a lot of princes in them.|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	Love isn't perfect, but love is wonderful.  Love is built on the fights and the laughters and the tears.  That's why it's so bittersweet.  xx|`|NrbLdZzOaa	You're 14...I dont think you realize how young that is. Give it time, time for you to grow up.|`|YjXmuKuPaa	Oh my to be 14 again...sorry dear but you are far too young to be worried about your dating standards.  All you should be worrying about right now is school|`|4PKuVsSzaa	dont worry about it love you still to you worry more about friends leaving dating for later or when you meet the right guy|`|59GGw0WAaa	Delusional but not high at all. For love is not meant to be perfect. Love is painful and yet we seek it daily. Love is surprise on an emotional level. Love is complication and frustration. Love is sudle in appearance.  You won't experience love if it's perfect, that's called fantasy. Love is meant to be lived and fought for.
WJKzAmr7aa	Yes. But the thrill of the chase will make her show it and like you more. So instead of making yourself TOO available right away to her when she writes sweet stuff back say something simple. Thatll make her want you more. Examples:    GIRL:Thanks for stopping by 2nite, it was nice 2 cu!  YOU: No prob. See u next time.    GIRL: Ur kinda cute, u know that?  YOU: Thanks I do now I guess =)    GIRL: You wanna come over after I get off?  YOU: Ok.    The thrill of the chase exites us girls and the more distant you seem, the more we want to persue you. But eventually start being a sweetheart and let the girl know you care. And don't be too blunt when you respond to what she's saying.    =)|`|c5501d7af062f728e28883d70bec4816aa	that's a hard one. maybe she was a little jealous of the other girl. or maybe she just wanted to be nice. but then the timing would be a total coincidence. so maybe she knows that you met someone else. just stay nice toward her and she wont have anything on you. If she starts flirting with you or asking you to meet up then just be honest and ask if its because shes jealous youve met someone. gd luck   answer mine please  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|P1Z5M6xraa	i think so.|`|Ovpghwujaa	uh, yeah. i would think that's quite obvious.|`|eJJwALuZaa	dude she wants to do you, go for it|`|Y3cm5313aa	you can't tell yet.  but keep talking to her, make her love you.   pretty soon you guys will fall in love.  good luck!|`|h06mx3d8aa	she is doing both. i kinda think that was mest up the way she said she was glad she broke ur heart. just my opinion.|`|wzHY9IVPaa	Yes.|`|cxKyHIquaa	Yesss you defo likess youu|`|EL0wq4Zmaa	It could mean either way. You should definetly get to know her more, and then see where it leads. A text surely does not mean a girl wants 'to do' you and might be totally inocent. Get to know her, It will be worth it. =]    Good luck!
1KjfZAWzaa	Well, first of all, I'm not sure hitting on girls at strip clubs is healthy, haha.<br>  <br>  But anyways.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she might really like you. There doesn't look like there is any strings attached. Go for it. If it doesn't work out, it's not a huge tragedy. Just go back to going friends. :)
XAw4cJmjaa	oh yeah, I think everyone has at one time or another. I use to be jealous of one of my older sisters because she was blond, blue eyed, and the cheerleader type. So, you can imagine how people would look at her then at me and say "why can't you look more like her?" It was a hard hit to my self-esteem, but over time I realized that God make us all different for a reason, and He gave us all our own beauty. Piss on the people that refuse to see the beauty in others.|`|DrFJfnpBaa	I have. I learned that who cares if she may be prettier. She's your friend, and thats not worth losing her for. If you feel you need/want to change your look, talk to her about it. She might help you and you 2 will be closer!                  Hope it helps~     -Lexi|`|tS2BpqTiaa	yes i have.  what i did was: i tried to dress really nice depending on the place.  i fixed my hair right.  i put pretty makeup on, not heavy.  tried to look as best as possible.
FXC74TCBaa	There are a few options that you have here:    -Talk to her. Tell her that you do not appreciate her copying your old personality. Say that you have changed and your old personality is in everyone's past, whether she likes it or not. Also tell her the reason that you made these new friends.    -Start acting like your old self. This may not be the best option if you like the new you, but it will get her to stop acting like you used to.    -Find all new friends, ones that will respect you for who you are. If your former friend follows you to this new group, tell her that you do not want her to be a part of your life anymore unless she starts acting better.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	go to a counselor or just find new friends that you know won't betray you!|`|bNx1q5oWaa	cat fight?|`|DrFJfnpBaa	U need to call that girl and talk to her! And if she doesnt back off or admit it say then it's your loss, and don't be friends with her. Talk to your new friends about her. If they don't understand get new new friends and tell them b4 ur so called bff comes and ruins that for you again. She isn't worth your trouble|`|9HaNKSRHaa	tell her to quit it...but then...you'll probably get nothing out of that...but its worth a shot. if that don't work...ignore her...she might come back to u...or u could tell the friends shes trying to take away from u wats goin on...and they might block her out too....so at least SOMEONE has ur back....dont giv in!|`|TR5F3bzvaa	Call your so called "friend" and have a talk. Explain to her how you feel about this situation. If she's really your friend, she'll stop. But, by the looks of how you explained this, she doesn't seem like a friend. Tell your new gals about this problem, and eventually, and hopefully, things will work out. Hope you solve your friend feud!  ~Eve
QAGaQUDRaa	Yes you're pretty short, and with parents that height, I doubt you'll be super-tall, but you still have years of growing left, so wait and see.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	well you probably wont grow much anymore     are you a guy or a girl ?    assuming you a dude thats considered short if you stay at that height    at 14 i was around 6'0 flat and im 18 now almost and im 6'4    so you might end up getting a little taller but my parents are very tall so its probably because of that|`|Y3cm5313aa	nahh you're okay.|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Um...? Drink lot's of milk ?    I'm 13 and I'm 5"3 :)|`|091LTWTCaa	I've heard that playing basketball is helpful because the body motions help your bones elongate. But it really has to do with genetics. Honestly, you still have till at least 17 so don't worry there is a good chance you'll get that tall.|`|AA12357399	well, you are only 14 yrs old, so i think u've got a growth spurt or two ahead of you!  i remember seeing a high school friend (about 16 yrs old then) come back to school after summer break and he had grown at least 4 inches taller!  and even though ur parents are not so tall doesn't mean you won't take after a taller gene/dna trait ie. either set of grandparents...good luck!

I have been there and done that. Its really risky. I say you could give it a try. But theres a chance it could ruin your friendship. Me and this guy just had that same type of thing happen. We broke up and now...We sont even talk!  Not to say that everyone is the same but things are different when your best friends.|`|84H5kMD7aa	he probably likes you|`|iIIXw6f5aa	He likes you totaly!|`|59GGw0WAaa	Take him out to lunch or a movie and have fun, at the end of the day tell him you would like to take the relationship to the next level and you would like to give him a 3 days to think about it. This way when you talk to him again and he says, Well I really didn't have the time to think about it. Tells you that he is not interested in you.|`|NgnbtaORaa	It sounds to me like he is really in to you.  If you like him make the first move he is probably shy.  Be confident and direct.  "So who do you like?" is far to open.  I would, if it were me in your situation, tell him that I like him.|`|eJJwALuZaa	show him your boobies|`|EFhhbS7Eaa	he is sending mixed signals so i have no idea|`|y3tPrTtBaa	he may not feel the same way about you and may have been trying to avoid hurting your feeling - think of him as a friend and move on...

What can a 17yr old girl (shes still a girl) give to a 23 yr old? the things you already went through(because youre past 21) shes going to want to try. Let her be free as a woman for a minute. Let her find herself first. By the time shes 18 or even 19 then you can at least just hang around go for lunch just to see where shes at. then you can tell her about your "feelings"! in the meantime, relax

I was only in my early teens at the time but it taught me that marriage is for adults (as well as having babies) and that a couple should NEVER, EVER get married because they have a child together!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You will not get an argument out of me on this one.  I find myself in total agreement with you.  Although it was very common years ago to get married young.  My grandparents married at 16 and had a hard but happy life together for over 53 years.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I agree with you.  They are not mature enough to prevent a pregnancy, but think they will be mature enough for marriage.

Abortion, adoption, raise it, stay single, get married are challenging options that teenage girls face, and many times without the support of the child's Father  or her family. A lot to deal with for a young mind not prepared or mature enough to handle it. It's understandable why they resort to drugs, alcohol and sadly suicide<br>  <br>  You consider teen pregnancy and marriage stupid, and point out divorce follows within three years. You may be correct, but it's not a solution Those of us who have survived our teenage tendencies, should be more understanding and supportive of teens  struggling with these  difficult issues.To often our only advice is to abstain from sex, which was our  teenage advice too, it didn't work then, and it doesn't work today. We have to show them we care, stand up and support our teens, one day they will show us they care too by standing up and supporting us, as leaders of our nation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless    .|`|pOTigVYPaa	I can totally understand your reasoning and the truthfulness of your statement.  My daughter and her boyfriend (she was pregnant) got married at ages 15 and 16.  They lived on their own, went through the pregnancy and delivery together, and raised their son together until he turned 3 and then divorced.  It showed them what life is really all about including all the ups and downs.  They took responsibility for  their actions and grew up a lot during those early teen years. My daughter went on to get her education while working and now teaches English in high school.  The father is long gone.  It was a hard lesson but well learned.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	What's it matter, people get married at 30 and get divorced a few months later. <br>  No, getting married just because your pregnant doesn't make it right. It doesn't mean your ok now just because your tax papers no longer say single. Forcing someone to get married is never a good idea. But some people assume they should have to take responsibility somewhere. But these kids, are still just kids. They are going to screw up, I'd rather see 17 year olds getting married underage than killing the baby for their idiotic mistake.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	I guess it depends on the person.  My Mom and Dad got married at 17 and 19.  She wasn't pregnant, they are just very religious and didn't want to fool around without getting married.  They have been married over 30 years, so you never know.  I think most kids this age should definitely wait, but a few of them may actually be ready.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	They do it to get the government checks, welfare and host of other benefits, like healtch care, headstart.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Underage is a matter of culture.

"underage defines a set of ages. The term "teenage" is western in origin and we have protected younger people from reality. Because we treat youngsters as feeble and not train them in the reality of life , they do stupid things like get married, have babies. If we teach them about responsibility at an earlier age, perhaps they will make mature choices. In some cultures, (old west, Asia, Europe,{before 1900}) 12 or 13 would be considered Adult. It was expected , no demanded that young people be mature to make better choices. We, Western society, want to coddle kids, raise them longer, and treat them as babies longer than physiologically possible. When the body matures, it is our duty to be sure their mind is as well.<br>  That they are prepared for the emotions and temptations waiting them.<br>  Instead we do not give them the responsibility ( ala, octomom) and they do stupid asinine things.|`|91SFoU14aa	Ok first off why are you judging someone just because of their age ?? Does age really even matter.. My grandmother got pregnant and married at the age of 15 and she is the best mother and grandmother you will ever meet!!! Also just because somebody ended up getting pregnant at a young age does not mean they were being irresponsible.. I myself got pregnant without meaning to and I was on birth control! I think its a really good thing that teens are deciding to get married, that is showing that they are taking responsibility for their actions.. I think you need to have a long talk with a counselor or maybe even god for that matter if you feel you have any right to put judgment on any one because everyone is human and every one has flaws.. your an old grouch I suppose that doesn't seem to be to well educated. Its ridiculous that you would even take the time out to even write this question just so you can ridicule somebody. Get a life please!!!|`|TTjDATeOaa	It used to be a big deal of a girl got pregnant that the father had to marry her for propriety's sake. That's how my mom ended up married at 17 and divorced at 20.

The way you dress those breasts and butt can help a great way to accent them, or if needed to make them less obvious.|`|AIftgLEGaa	In my opinion, big is not always better. small and perky is great! but it all depends on the guy.|`|zRTEvp4oaa	it depends wot the guy likes all preferences are different
23vKOyBraa	Let me get this straight: Your friend HAS a boyfriend. Your friend has another friend (whom she likes) who HAS a girlfriend, and thus will not commit to your friend nor answer her questions.    Uhm, WHERE exactly is the problem? What do I think she should do - concentrate on her (first) boyfriend!!!    Oh, can you send me his contact details, I'd like to let him know the type of girl he is dating - looking around at other guys already. Sheesh, way to create a good relationship foundation.|`|RXQbiRjlaa	don't do anything. they'll figure it out themselves. u definately don't want to mess things up fpr ur friend.
UtwMxaPzaa	Yes. Important, but if your guys not good at it, that's ok. Remember, Romance is better un-manufactured. find romance in the little things- drink wine and watch a movie with him.

Thats what its all about. Its all about romance.|`|g3XVcRJGaa	Yes, it is important. Without romance relationships go stagnant and lose their spontaneity.|`|PCBQbQmraa	Its nice to have, but define romance to me romance is that funny little feeling you get when you see each other when your eyes light up when he walks in the room, and lets face it that only last for a couple years if even that, but romance is nice to have once in a while but its really about love, and knowing that person with you forever and he loves you unconditional, but if it is real love true love then you will have your romantic moment but it won't always be around. So its just a nice thing to have.     Also remember who you are asking on here. Some people are little girls that are hopeless romantic that haven't really had a good long serious relationship, and remember i added GOOD! Then you have those old hags that don't know what a good thing is anymore because they been hurt, and are very judgmental about things. I'm not a old hag and i have a good serious relationship for 3 years! I think old people who been hurt and like to be negative about things just need to stfu. because they will probable say that the romance will not last, and that is true to a extent! You have to work at a relationship not give up.

fTbYEKGuaa	Try slowly distancing yourself from her. You don't owe her anything from the sounds of it, so she shouldn't get mad if you hang out with other people. If she talks about you behind your back, try to confront her about it. I don't know what type of person she may be, but if she really wants to save your friendship she will cooperate and stop the gossip. But if things don't get any better, maybe it is time to give this friendship a break.    Hugs&kisses,  Adrian|`|e1k4Ndj7aa	talk to her about it|`|oAOPphQWaa	this is easy..

How to effectively leave without causing a scene:    1. Start spending more time with other friends. I had the same problem, and when I left my old friend I was a little tempted to go back to her because I really didn't have any other friends to hang out with. As soon as I got new friends I stopped thinking about her altogether.    2. Don't avoid her. Gradually cut down the time you spend with her.    3. Don't talk about it with your friends, but realize that many of them may feel the same way. When she talks about you behind your back, they realize that it's very possible she is doing the same thing to them.|`|evEJxv06aa	talk to her and tell that when she talks behind your back it makes you feel bad and you can't take it any more so please stop that and if you want to spend more time than tell me i will try to have some time for you and if you can't stop it than i have no choice but to break our friendship that's something i don't want to do but if you don't get your act together than you leave me no choice but that ok.
KrdOKdJcaa	You kinda answered that. You're afraid because the last time you let someone get close they burned you. It's a fear of rejection, probably the most common fear there is.    Ease yourself into it. Start by either inviting someone who you're the most comfortable with to something, or accept an invitation to something where there will be a lot of people so you don't have to get too close with anyone right away. Go slow.

Also, you could be passing up some true, life long friendships along the way by keeping that guard up.  Don't isolate yourself from experiencing life to its fullest.|`|0qSpreVyaa	Don't be scared to let your friends get too close. I have 5 really good friends too, and i tell them almost EVERYTHING. (Not necessarily ideal in all situations : ) ) But, we have an honest friendship and we are all really close. If you don't let them get close, you really wont have anyone you can really talk to about your problems... like now for example.    So... don't keep them away, go to some of the parties and hang out with them.    You may just be nervious of the same thing that happened between Alex and you happening again. That is understandable. But other people have close friends, not all friends will change like that, some may, but others wont. The only way you can find out is to be friendly with them, get closer with them.

I had two close friends when I was in high school.  We had been friends in junior high and we had a lot of fun times together.  After high school we kind of lot track of each other.  Sometimes it was sad not having them around.  I made new friends and even though my two friends changed (a lot), I always remembered the good times.  Several years ago one moved back to the town where I live.  I would see him and talk but we never hung out like in high school.  I just tracked the other friend down last week.  We agreed to keep in touch with each other.  By the way, I graduated high school in 1980.     Hope this helped.

You know she's married and has a kid with the guy. If you had a wife or a girlfriend and you went away for awhile to do something heroic like being a soldier would you like it if she cheated on you?|`|eZZ2rclaaa	Don't put yourself in that kind of a position. Get out now!!! Think about how it would feel for you if that was your wife who was cheating on you while you were in Iraq. No matter how much she cares for you, it sounds like she will never leave her husband, and it doesn't sound like you want her to. The best thing is for you to cut all ties with her. Tell her it's over and GET OUT!!! Hope this helps :)|`|BSKJdZK3aa	you are to blame you cant steal someones wife like that its dishonorable and disgusting + you just made your lives more complicated and she cant be blamed because she was nervous and need someone to help her so a woman cant be blamed for these kind of things unless the man isnt a gentleman|`|805f8abbbc70fb17c275e2516344159faa	Ignore her ............

My latest boyfriend and I dated for 1 year and we both didn't have sex, because we were too young.  Just don't worry about having sex yet, later on in the relationship you might feel like having sex with him one day.|`|AA10905383	Let him know you aren't ready for sex. Make sure he knows that.|`|EL0wq4Zmaa	1: you are not just being a 'stupid highschool girl' all girls are like that. (: and your not alone.    2: Don't say I love you to him if you are thinking about breaking up with him.    3: A good suggestion would be to call of the relationship (in my opinion) if he's not "the one" then who knows maybe your missing out on someone that is "the one"    4: If sex is the problem, talk to him maybe hes scared too. But remember a relationship is not all about sex.       Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|nwcJI64naa	Guys will always tell you things they think you want to hear, so they can get what they want from you.    Just so you know... =)    So I think friendship is the best solution, at least until you're not scared of falling in love and whatnot.|`|xgz60izBaa	Don't have sex with him until you are very much in love.  You will regret it.  Sex is not something you just throw around lightly, it is a very special and intimate thing.  ALWAYS make sex special with no exceptions.  Guys will respect you more.  Don't be a phony, if you don't love him, don't say it.  Guys tend to throw the phrase "I love you" around without a second thought.  Most of them have no idea what love is especially in high school.  They can't differentiate between love and lust and most of what they feel is lust.  Trust me, I've been there, done that!|`|lFg1EJeGaa	I always say, "If you have doubts, don't." clearly you're having mixed feeling about your boyfriend. You better handle that before you get in too deep. Maybe you should break up w/ him until you find out what you want.|`|TbQEskNyaa	Heeey tbh imalways in the same situation as you he probably only lusts you which is a teenage thing and you see he might think exaccly what your saying and if you dont really want to have sex with this guy then hes not the right guy just stay with him and see whats right x|`|Fvx6mD4Zaa	no if u like him then obviously dont. and for the sex part if he really wants to do it talk to him first...
BKr3y30maa	I think you are being very reasonable.  He would be paying much more out of his own pocket if he would be living by himself.  I think you should talk to him about it.  If he wants to help out his family, I think that's fine. But as long as he is helping you out too....after all he is using up utilites like you said.  You definetly sound fair to me.
zscuDpaIaa	I love promise rings! Me and my boyfriend have them. We talked about getting them very early on in our relationship, maybe like 2 or 3 months. Then for our 6 month anniversary we bought each other rings. I still have mine, and he still has his. In march is will be 2 years :)<br>  <br>  If you really love the guy/girl your with, and you've talked about it i think around 6 months to a years time limit is good, whatever you feel is right.<br>  <br>  Also i was 16 at the time and he was 18.|`|BO28Mn8haa	what is the promise ring "promising" exactly? i was with my ex two years, we got each other promise rings. he actually gave me two, one each year.. and we are no longer together. why bother?|`|iP863XM6aa	I would go closer to a year than an amount of months...|`|Un9CElCaaa	those things are a joke. u dont need a promise ring to be faithful|`|GBr9YngTaa	This ring represents your promise to each other until you are old enough to get married. You are a teenager, how can you make that kind of promise?<br>  <br>  Fact is that most relationships don't last outside of high school. Yes some do, but A LOT doesn't.<br>  <br>  Do you know what a promise ring really is? A way for jewelry companies to make money. Why do you need a symbol of your love? You just need to know the love is there.<br>  <br>  But if you really wanted a promise ring, a good six months is worthy. Anything less doesn't really signify anything.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	12 months or more, but that's only my opinion, if you can make it a full year together and still be happy with each other, it may help with the second year which is suppose to be the toughest year. Plus it gives you both time to get to know each other a lot better and may help you decide if a long term relationship would work.|`|bc40a69a30a003422da4f7acebd6f59baa	I think it depends on what the promise is for?

q8eue7CRaa	Have you been faithful to your fiance? Your question makes it sound like you haven't. If you've been cheating the whole time, break it off now before she goes through the pains of a marriage that will shortly end in divorce and heartbreak. Then you can have all the flings you want.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I can see how this might be tempting.  about a year or so ago my fiancee was contacted by his high school sweet hart.  They never slept together and were forced to break up by there overly religious parents.  She told him she was moving abroad and wanted to close that past and see what they never got to experience.  He actually considered doing it!  He even set up to go see her where she was living.  A week before he was scheduled to go see "his family" (that's what he told me he was doing) he realized he was an idiot and would be throwing away every thing we had just to fulfill his high school fantasy.  He called her and told her the truth that we were getting married.  After he got off the phone is when he came inside and told me everything.  I had no clue!  Turns out she told him he was a piece of sh%# for leading her on and hung up on him.  To be honest I would have never known, but he would have and it would have made all the difference.  I respect him more for telling me the truth.  It also shows me that his conscience always gets the best of him.  I love that about him.|`|frA6KJwIaa	my jaw dropped when i read your question.<br>  <br>  does "one last fling" mean you've been doing it with other women while you were still in a relationship with you present fiancee?<br>  <br>  sick. i hope this a joke|`|txjE1Dauaa	Why is that women claim to hate guys  like You but still run after guys like You?

RC8Pxx8eaa	Yes, yes and yes, go to www.landybridal.com this is the website for an amazing chinese dressmaker who also sells on ebay. he does all the top name dresses at a fraction of the price. I got mine from ebay before I realised he actually had an online website.  I paid 99.99 for my wedding dress and it was out of this world, it fits beautifully and the style is simply stunning exactly like the picture and it is so well made its almost reversible as the stitching on the pure satin lining is invisible.  Do yourself a favour and go to this site on ebay he is called landybridal and if you see his feed back he is a powerseller with a pure 100% feedback.  Do your research first, check the feedback and then go for it, you will not be disappointed. I got my dress, my 6 bridesmaids dresses from him and also a white satin bolero jacket to go over the top for Church as I have tattoos on my back.  He is truly amazing, check his feedback and you will see, he is completely wonderful.  Please do this before you decide to go anywhere, and as for the horror stories you read about ebay on here, check it out for yourself first before you dismiss him.  I promise you you will not be ripped off and you will be nothing but estatic when you see your chosen dress.  Good luck for your big day.|`|AA11082914	I've never ordered from one of the chinese shops on there, but I've heard some horror stories. One girl I kinda know (a friend of a friend) ordered a knock off Maggie Sottero from one of them (can't remember name at moment, sorry). She paid $300 for it (which, for a Maggie look-a-like is a GREAT deal). Took 6 months to ship to her, and when she got it, it looked NOTHING like what she ordered. (She ordered white, came in in a cream color, beading was NOT in anysort of pattern like it was in the pic, and even though she sent her measurements in to them, it was way too tight in the bust and way too big in the waist.) She ended up trashing the thing and going to david's bridal instead.|`|e50edc701ca7a4e8c4b48c44b142d895aa	Hi Kesha, I bought a wedding dress from ebay, it was a copy of an alfred angelo dress, and compared to the 1000 that his website was charging for the dress 80 was fantastic, however when i received it, the length was too short, it was all out of proportion, the detailing was nothing like the real thing, it didnt stand out as much. Even though the tpictures they show are off the real thing, its not what you are getting. You will also find that it wont be boned, and there will be no underneath to the dress it will simply be the dress, so any underskirting/netting/hoop you will have to buy, you will most likely have to get it boned. Beware also if you are a person who is regular height or tall, as they seem to only make shorter dresses as they tend to be shorter also. I like you thought wow these dresses are gorgeous and thought it was a brilliant idea to save money    To be honest, for your wedding dress I would not reccommend this as i was left feeling let down, and have actually gone out and bought myself a new dress, the real deal this time.|`|yJ3GpnXAaa	There are some stunning dresses available from China.    The most important things to be aware of are:  a)  allow plenty of time for the dress to be made and delivered to you, so order at least a couple of months in advance of the Big Day    b)  that you need to give the correct measurements.    Almost all of the dresses that you'll get made-to-measure from Chinese sellers will be made to the measurements you give - if you give your own actual measurements, the dress will be made to that size and will be too small for you (because there will be no allowance for you to move), so add a couple of inches to each measurement that you give, but do check beforehand with the seller to be certain.      If you're uncertain about the fabric used, you could ask the seller to send you a swatch.  If they're genuine,there should be no problem with that, although if they don't reply or aren't willing to send you a small sample, go with your instinct (if you want to ask for samples, add at least an extra week to your timeframe because it can take a couple of weeks for post to get from the Far East to the UK).    Read the listing thoroughly, make sure of what you're getting from the seller and then your dress should be everything that you hope.    PS I bought my wedding 'dress' - a salwar/kameez - from an eBay seller in India and it was beautiful.|`|UoexcWYSaa	do not order from china it ends up costin u lots more i was going to do it but got it made in uk email me send u pics of dress staciedempsey@yahoo.co.uk sellin it|`|4dwzZyvsaa	I would rather buy it from a department store that sells wedding dresses. Who knows what the person did with the dress? And plus, the dress could be old even though the person said that it was new. People can lie. Trust me, I tried that once in getting a puppy and they gave me a rip off. There was no puppy! :(|`|scS9zqKxaa	I was lookin at thoses ones too.  If you read the feedback of that particular seller, you will see that many are happy but hey do seem to get it wrong sometimes either with the style or size.  However, the ones with the wrong style are still saying that the alternative was still stunning.  Even if there were an error, as long as you order it in plenty of time, you could always have it altered here.  Beware of shipping costs though, although the dresses seem very cheap, you could be caught out on shipping so i would email them first to enquire what the shipping would be exactly for the dress you want to where you live.  Another thing that worried me was that how they made them so cheap, i did not go for it due to the risk of child labour and i dont think there is anyway to be sure that it is not happening on the dress you want.  Good luck in your search. x|`|Ze8YFvjpaa	im going 2 use my prom dress but my wedding is going 2 b a redneck wedding|`|ZcISKmdcaa	Be very careful buying your dress from EBay!  There are some lovely ones for good prices being sold for genuine reasons  There are also some complete piles of *** that are only good for rags! (ok, slight exaggeration but they are quite rubbish!)  The ones from China - be especially careful and check ALL the feedback, some will reach you and be perfect, fit like a glove and make you feel fabulous. Others (and I've heard from a lot of people that have had this problem) will be the wrong size/cheap material/horrendously made/all of the above!    Even the ones bought on the UK can be badly made and have bits falling off them    If you do get one, please check the sellers return policy too    Good luck (and congrats on the wedding!)|`|hSOfnvuaaa	Ive never brought a wedding dress of ebay, but i brought a prom dress. & the pictures dont do them any justice, simply beautiful|`|7CBzMhKXaa	I have heard horror stories from people who bought their dress from Chinese sellers on ebay, I did look on  ebay but only places close by where I could go and try the dress on if I liked it. Eventually bought from Oxfam shop, they have special wedding dress shops in some areas, definitely southampton and poole, check their website for other stores. Feel glad I am paying money to a charity instead of a greedy shop and you can try the dress on as well. Maybe it is worth a look? They are not all old eighties dresses (which was my secret fear)  many are donated from wedding dress shops which need a new range, they have a wide range of styles and sizes. Good luck, hope you find the one!|`|73G030jiaa	My friend got a wonderful dress off ebay for a good price.  I ordered one only paid $80 total for an oleg cassini, that is beautiful but not what I thought. I should have asked more questions.  If you are not too picky go for it but ask lots of questions and check the sellers feed back, use paypal so you have some recourse if item is not received.|`|JZabWXGpaa	Here's a website that has online wedding dresses custom made to order.  All of their gowns are under $500 and they have free shipping worldwide.    The biggest difference here, is, you actually get to see the dresses that they make.  They don't use pictures of designer dreses and then do the knock off.  The are a Paypal verified business and they have a return policy.    http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com    If you want to buy a designer dress at a discounted price, then I recommend http://www.bestbridalprices.com  they also have an excellent reputation.|`|TjNMabEIaa	I bought mine from china, custom made and it fit perfectly. The material was first class and it only took 3 weeks. The dress cost less then 100 including postage and was worth every penny and more.  My husband filled up when he saw me in it.    The only thing you have to do is measure correctly and check out their feedback and you should have no problems.
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it depends on how traditional you are.    if there is an interest, then either can ask.  Sometimes someone is shy and it's always better to be sure than it is to sit around and wonder.    FWIW:  I have asked out men and been asked out by men and I find that the ones who ask me out, I like better.  So I don't ask men out very often any more.  Only if I like them and they seem to be shy and aren't picking up on the "approach me already dammit" signals.    The reason I like men who ask me out better is because they have an interest in me, they are more confident, they are more outgoing, basically they are more manly.    The ones I've asked out after getting to know them seem lazy.  They think because I asked them out that they don't have to do anything, they also don't seem as interested in me.  These are the guys that give truth to the statement:  "he would have asked you out if he was really interested."    as to the shy ones:  it's hit and miss with them. some are lazy and some turn out to be more confident and interested once I've let them know I'm interested.|`|85tAhnM9aa	Either way really. The people who think only guys should ask are old fashion and refuse to change in my opinion. Actually I would prefer if the girl asked but whatever either way.|`|qVCUgKfAaa	a boy ask the girl............it shows that the boy is a true man and Gentleman...|`|pI5pQPltaa	I think the boy should ask the girl, but the girl should make it easier for the boy by not making it awkward. I once tried to ask out a girl but she made it awkward by always standing with her friends when she knew I wanted to ask then I asked her if we could talk and she said why not do it here? So i never asked her. Isnt it on valentines day that a girl can ask a boy or summart like that? or is it a leap year, i dunno.|`|SIxMxu5gaa	Well it is somewhat correct, but either is also acceptable. If you want to be with someone, it is assertive and masculine to ask them out. It is a skill that a gentleman must have confidence in, especially considering many girls will not ask men on dates. On the other hand, some girls do ask boys out It shows that they are confident and it is very flattering when they do so. Society encourages men to do the asking, but a girl asking is acceptable as well.
9sKfvqQHaa	welll, in order to help out with this problem, I need to know why you guys broke up.   did she break up with you, or did you break up with her?  I'm gonna guess that she broke up with you  soo, did she tell you the reasons why?  were you nice to her; honest, romantic, sweet, caring??  what I really noticed in your answer was, "we only went out for half a year."  honey, to me, that sounds like a long time!   you guys must of had something special!  you also stated that she moved on  when I was in a problem simular to this, I went on quickly myself, trying to hide my pain of regret.  I'm not saying she regrets breaking up with you  I'm just saying girls can be kinda confussing like this  lol  maybe you should try talking to her again. find out what you did wrong in this relationship.  DONT, i repeat.. DONT try to get her jealous with another girl  thats just gonna make her mad  I hate it when guys do this  sooo what do you miss about her?  if it's a one of a kind thing: her smile, laugh, the way she embraced you.......  I hate to break it up to you but you cant find this anywhere else  all i can say is try talking to her  dont invite her places; this will just cause confict between you and her new bf  i am going threw the same thing honey, i'm trying to get my ex back after I broke up with him   and I have been going through soo much depression  just dont cry over it and dont give up  you never now.... things might work out  dont say they wont just because she's going out with another man  give her time to clear her mind  help remind her about the special things you guys had  for ex:  think about a time you guys at a good night. did you ever cuddle on the couch and eat pizza?  if you did, you can always have a pizza get dilivered to her house and you could have the pepperonis aranged as saying:  i miss you  I'm sorry I'm not much of a help..... I dont know what to say but try talking to her  and if she refuses, then maybe she's not the type of girl you thought she was........  good luck  ;)
88Hozyl1aa	My mom and Dad did that for about two years. I am the oldest of 4 and I think I was the first to realize this. I'm 16. But over the months of sucking it up and living with each other "for the sake of the children" they grew cold towards each other, and started fighting more and more as time went by. This, in turn put everyone in the house on edge, causing my little brother to get in trouble at school (fights, talking back, etc) and my little sisters grades started falling. When they finally agreed that staying together was not the best option, my mom moved out with us. Her and my dad agreed that we go to his house every other weekend. And now when they see each other (my dad comes to our house to visit once in a while) they are so much more light hearted, and happy. Which keeps us happy. So no..I don't think parents should stay with each other if their not happy "for the sake of the children"|`|BwXpvbxKaa	It depends of the situation, if they can be amicable and keep the family whole while at it,,,then why not,,,after all it was not the children s choice to be here..........I personally would do anything for the happiness of mine.......good luck|`|NctuEmFKaa	No if they aren't happy with each other, then the kids can pick up on that, they shouldn't stay there and make everyone miserable.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	The worst reason for staying together is for the children since it is the children who will suffer the most. They sense when things are not right and the underlying lack of love and hostility will make for very unpleasant living arrangements. No couple should ever do that to children, they need to divorce and move on and get shared custody.|`|uky2nsh8aa	yes and no. <br>  i think they need to work it out because they shouldn't have had sex if they don't love each other.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I have been unhappy for a very long time to my husband and am trying to wait until our youngest son(15) turns 18 to get a divorce. I am not certain that I am going to make it. I don't regret staying with him to get all three of ours raised, I have made it through with our 21 year old and our 19 year old and they are pretty good kids I believe for it but I am resenting my husband more and more all of the time. I don't plan on staying in the same situation the rest of my life.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	MOST people use that answer if they have children - it sounds noble, BUT I know that most men stay married to shrew type wifes, and most women stay with abusive or indifferent husbands strictly because of money.  The Men don't want to give it up, and the women don't think they can make it with less.    All the time forgetting about happiness.  Happiness for ALL concerned.  So sad.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Nope not at all. You may think you are pulling it off but kids can see what is really going on. If their happy the kids are happy.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	They should get counselling and try to sort their problems, a good marriage is hard work.
DB5zieYbaa	Well sure you have to tell your sister, and tell her not to become angry with Daphney, it wasn't her fault to find inapropiate things, even though she shouold'nt be in her sisters room.  I don't know how old is Kandice, but she sould be more carefull with this kind of things, is very private and she sould have it in a place were nobody can find it so easy! <br>  <br>  You wouldn't make big thing out of it , I mean , about you catching your 10 year old sister watching the porno film, because it was a misstake, but try to say to the rest of the familj to have their eyes open, it could have damaged the girls mind in some way, you never know what kind of things she saw exactly.|`|7GsYFjHRaa	wow, thats a weird question to ask. I really dont know what to say. Arent u enabbaressed. And how old r u? where did she get the dildo? Ask more questions DUDE!|`|JlVzCnTJaa	i think your 10 year old sister knows ALOT more than you think she does.. that thing that happened just seems weird..|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	The person to blame is Kandice for leaving things like this laying around where  little sis can find them.<br>   Of course she will look and most likely not be harmed but should be told that these things are for adults only and she should ask before going into others space and looking at private stuff.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	Your sister shouldn't have left porn lying around. Of course she wasn't to know that your sister would find it, but tell her so that she can hide it in the future. Also, a 10-year-old shouldn't know this stuff, so saying that she was amused by it is wrong. You need to tell her that it was wrong, but at the same time, she didn't know that it was disgusting, which is why you need too talk to her.|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	I think the best thing to do would be to make  sure that there were more eyes watching ur 10 yr old sis. So, its better to tell ur other sister and come out with a proper conversation to explain to ur 10 yr old sis abt it.Hope i helped!|`|jxeQWLpWaa	yeah i think you should talk to your older sister and both of you should really watch out for the 10 yr old!!!! <br>  i think its good that she has two older sisters just watch out for her and start educating her in a couple of years!|`|6C5NDSBSaa	I would say something. A ten year old shouldn't even know what porn or a dildo is.|`|djUMvICoaa	Don't kid yourself, that's not the first time she's watched that.  If it was she would  have been scared stiff.  You can and should bring it to Kandice's attention and you should be able to gauge by her reaction if she knows about the younger one.  If you hav e any further doubts about it go to you parents.   No kid should be watching pom or be playing with dildos.
5iHnNGHxaa	Yes its a tramp stamp. That's what its called. And all guys know that if you see one of those on a girl it wont take much to get her in bed.|`|xbjc2yzOaa	A tattoo does NOT make a person a "tramp"..all you f******* people are so close-minded and ignorant. and As for those guys who say that's how they identify a ****-one night stand..then i feel bad for them they must of never had a real women..|`|QPiwb7hKaa	i thought it was known as a tramp stamp because you have to wear a cutoff shirt and low jeans for anyone to see it.   my cousin got a henna tattoo there and she is very refined but she thought it looked nice (it did) i think that's just a stereotype.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	tramp stamp is a slang term for the tattoo across the lower back and not all women who have a tattoo across their lower back are tramps.    Just like some guys claim girls who have their tongues pierced are sluts who will suck anyone and guys w/ their tongues pierced are gay, that's not true either.     what you've found instead are a bunch of guys who openly admit to using women and throwing them away and why would you want to associate with anyone who would disrespect women and use you the same way if given the chance?|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Probably just to get a bf or a little more lol! Mainly cuz they want attention in my opinion that is anyways. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Very true    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Just because someone has a tattoo in that location doesn't make them a tramp, its their actions that make them a tramp.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Getting a tattoo doesn't turn a woman into anything. False, it means nothing.  The reasons are many why some get them others don't. Just as the placement of a tattoo. Some like ankles others shoulders or back, its personal in nature.  I don't find them attractive of a woman, but then again there not worried about how you or I feel or think.  They like it and are happy, end of story.|`|z0Ynd4zRaa	I have one. It has nothing to do with other people. I regret getting it, but whatever. I don't let guys use me. Not all of us are sl*ts.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Yup, guys usually go for them in the bar since it's a easy lay down. It's true.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	i hate tattoo on any part of a girl|`|kANR98tIaa	Sex appeal yeah.|`|FdNbyvJ9aa	That's false. Most women just think it looks nice. However when you get a tattoo there, you're forbidden to get an epidural when your giving birth. They're scared the tattoos ink may sink through once the needle hits it.|`|ulO3556jaa	No its not, that is a generalization.... one should put allot of thought into a tattoo before they get one, it should be something that is very meaningful to them. i don't think they are all sluts if they have one there though. Maybe the guys you have been asking are fags?|`|AA10278534	It's a nick name for that style tattoo. Don't judge anyone by their ink. I know some real fine young ladies who sport 'tramp stamps'. It doesn't make them anything more or less than a girl with a tattoo.    Guys who would treat any woman "like a toilet", will do it to any woman, tattooed or not. Some guys are just a$$holes.|`|9temsB8haa	That is what they are called and most of the time the girls with them are a lot "easier" than those without- which is how they got the name.|`|BBozfXmOaa	well ya thats how guy think they could just use a girl but if u want to get one ..who cares its not like ur going to let some random guy use u ..make sure no guy takes advantage of u show them ur the boss|`|AA11313486	low self esteem, want more attention   etc|`|Dm2zrJCRaa	The guys you are asking are losers|`|9wwhKkWeaa	Good question :S|`|SmzzXJlRaa	Completely true. some girls think its sexy and its just a way to show that they are open to one night stands|`|EDYETUNCaa	Yeah I heard that too. All my guys friends talk about it and say that's how they know the girls are easy. I have no idea why they would want to advertise it. I'm sure not all girls are trashy that get one their. It's more likely a stereotype.|`|izNL76Tvaa	Because she thinks people will compliment it or it shows shes tough, but really she has low self esteem and ill fix that tonight ;)|`|clFTA9fDaa	It's known as a tramp stamp, because a lot of the time you have to wear really low jeans for anyone to see it. But it's not true that everyone with a tattoo there is a Ho.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	Why yes, they are called tramp stamps. It didn't always be that way. Lately, gils are getting them BECAUSE they are called tramp stamps.|`|FU07SiQEaa	I dont agree.  I think its cute and i like them.    Im a classy lady, i dont sleep around and i want one.  Just another stupid sterotype!!!|`|mjzrHAt3aa	Yeah that what every guy i know says that and my bff knows that 2 and she got one ,i yelled at her why would she do that and she told me she wasn't for sure and then she said i think cutter guys will like mme and im like or you will look totally desperate
eJJwALuZaa	I dont blame him, you women are so cruel.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	I think your missing the point that from your boyfriends perspective, he has come home from a hard day at work, to find possibly his two closest people to him cosied up together on the couch enjoying theyre unemployed selves.  Maybe he was a little childish acting the way he did, but his annoyance is understandable, when you look at it like that.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	he thought you and his brother were "hooking" up. Are you blind? He is jealous he came in at the wrong time. Ask him whats wrong and tell him that you and his brother were just watching a movie. there was nothing intimate going on between you guys.|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Well he has the rite to be....  FREE LOADERS  no offense but its the truth|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	cuz your freeloading of him while his working his asss of. be independent. get a job. stop making excuses.|`|sjQKEeOuaa	hes just sounds tired maybe he should take a day off every now and then|`|RtGtbTkPaa	Apparently your bf is jealous of his bro. He think u r closer with his brother than him. He is acting like a jerk because he thinks his bro likes u and wants to steal u from him.    I say it is ur bf's fault for not being understanding and tht is y he is actinglike a jerk.    Soon he will get tht u were just watching t.v. (i don't mean to sound mean or anything but if stll acts this over time he most likely yell at his bro and then he will start yelling at ou then u will start yelling at ur bf and shut him up by saying something real deep and tell him like it is. but he might not even notice wht type of girl he has untill he loses u    hope i made at least some sense. :).|`|A54FZOjQaa	CUZ HE HAS TWO BUMS BUMMIN OFF HIM GET A JOB HO|`|nY2hZrUMaa	cus he thinks u n brother dude are 'an item'|`|9wwhKkWeaa	Talk to him about it.  It sounds like he got the wrong idea and got a little jealous.  Just tell him that you love him too much to do anything, let alone do anything like that.|`|MtDkSw8waa	um why dont you ask?  prob cuz you guys arent doing a thing and he is working his *** off.   at least look for a job and do something productive instead of sitting on your *** all day and he will probably feel better|`|P0CGTAbgaa	WELL SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET LIKE THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOUR SITUATION IS FOR THE REASON YOUR NOT WORKING, BUT WHEN THEY COME HOME AND SEE WHO EVER HOME CHILLING AND HE HAVE WORKED ALL DAY THERE KIND OF PISSED CAUSE THERE THE ONLY ONE THAT IS BRINGING IN THE MONEY AND IF Y'ALL DON'T FIND A JOB THINGS ARE GOING TO GET WORSE....|`|2mla6m51aa	Someone say i need to be afaid of loosing everythang in the LaLa land FOR CHANGE FOR CHAANGE!By Demi  lavota|`|LKchOjCNaa	i am only 11 but i think i can help maybe be a bit more happy when he gets home and dont spend so much with his brother because he might get a bit jelous  also try be a bit more romantic and try talking to him more and dont say how good ur day was talk about y his day was bad hope this help from Rebecca Xxxx|`|4PKuVsSzaa	wat do you think it looks like he works all day while you and his unemployed brother laze around the house he is working to pay for|`|eD9frdYmaa	he thinks you and his brother are sorta mtogeather behind his back if its not about the freeloading thing. you should talk to him and see whats wrong. and tell him you would never do that to him.
ifC1aFHxaa	Sounds like you really don't want to go back to Kitchener if you are reluctant to put yourself back into a place where you say you do bad things. That is a sign of maturity. The Bible  says that God will provide a way out from temptation, so maybe getting out of that town is the best thing.  I would not recommend living with your 19 year old cousin unless she was one really wise young woman who could make sure you stay in school and keep you out of trouble. That is a big burden for a fellow teenager.  What do your grandparents say? If they'll keep you for a couple more years, that might be best.  Make good choices that you can be proud of, and everything will work out well.  Good luck to you, brother.
afa658288307d52339050cbd84cc7a14aa	Gosh why some people write in "text "code, it's really hard to understand and sorry love but too long, too boring to read all.  Hope you get your problem sorted!!|`|W9VLXTfpaa	clean up your typing, its sorta hard to read, but i tried.    From what i understood:  I think you should just get over her, usually its the guy that smokes in the relationship. I think you should get over her because, she obviously doesn't care if she says she doesn't want to ruin your friend relationship. pretty much when a girl says that, shes lying, i've done it before. Smoking ISN'T that bad, but it could cause harm if you don't want them too. My boyfriend stopped pot, but smokes cigarettes but hes 'trying' to quit, but i understand the kind of stress he goes through.      She seems like she doesnt wanna be with you, but tell her that you'd still be good friends with her even if you broke up. Then the anser to that will tell you whats next|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Sounds like she just enjoys getting attention from boys. She may like you, but she sounds like she's also going into a rebellious phase with the smoking and being more sexually aware of herself.  You should steer clear of her.    Also, please use more vowels.|`|JNUWzHGzaa	if you love her like you say you can get by it. Smoking isn't that bad, just imagine if it was u smoking and a girl wudnt get with u coz of it, ud be priddy bummed! So just put it to the back of ur mind and tell her not to do it around u, then maybe shel stop doing it so much and eventually stop. x|`|D10tLM5uaa	you need to trust her again and don't let her feel bad about herself  just always be there for her,you're her friend that's what you're for
0LJde1mPaa	sweetie you deserve more than the guy who's cheated on you.  yeah you love him and its hard but when it comes down to it there really is no excuse for cheating and if a guy really loved you and cared for you then he wouldnt even think of hurting you in this way.  you deserve better so move on and dont get sucked into this kind of thing because if it happened once so easily and if was willing to risk your feelings then he will do it again|`|IE5uQiUMaa	There's always the "once a cheater, always a cheater" statement.  I'd be careful. I'm not sure about a break up but definitely don't trust him a whole lot.|`|XAw4cJmjaa	Forgiving can be easy but forgetting is the real hard part.  Use your own judgment.  I'm sure after 16 months of dating, you have gotten a pretty good idea of who your boyfriend is. If you choose to forgive him and continue with the relationship, you probably will wonder more about what he is doing, if he's doing something wrong, etc. Those type of thoughts can end up driving you crazy, and if you ever act on those thoughts (by asking him about them) he could end up being angry or pushy because you haven't let the past go. When someone cheats on you, its a no win situation afterword's. If you forgive them, then they believe you should erase it from your memory and never think of it again.  Again, use your one judgment and way out the pros and cons of forgiving and forgetting before you make a decision.  Good luck.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Run the other way!    Does not sound like the makings of a good relationship.|`|22d1fdbf6cde18545cea2086d1c58ec3aa	go to survivinginfidelity.com for some good advice.  I am married and I am in the process of forgiving my Wayward Wife.  It is very difficult, but I have a lot more invested than you probably do,  Kids, a House, etc.  You are the only one that can decide if going through tremendous heartache and pain is worth it.  Good Luck!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Would I forgive? I'm not to sure, but I don't think so. It sounds like he lied at first and now saying something different now. How will you ever be able to trust him? Since you're not married, maybe you shouldn't have to think about forgiving him and definitely forgetting it. When one's trust is broken in any way, and you can't overcome the pain and all the emotions it raises, then can you truly regain that relationship back? He did lie at first to you, and to me that 's as bad as the act itself. He didn't betray you once, he did it twice. You have to have peace of mind, heart and spirit to be a good partner and I'm not sure you could be after this to him.It's easy to say move on, and I'd probably tell you to do that, but only you can know what's best for you in the long run, but I will say  you deserve much more.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	If you are 100% convinced it won't happen again give him another chance. If you're unsure or your gut still doesn't trust him, quit wasting your time. "Hurt me once, shame on you. Hurt me twice, shame on me".|`|Leda2ha0aa	I would walk away in a heart beat.  You are not married to him and hopefully have no kids.  It will all change for you once he brings you a lovely STD that you can't get rid of or tells you there's now a child in the picture.    If you don't think you deserve better then that is what you should really be analyzing - not whether you should stay with him.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	If you love him and can forgive him , then give him another chance.  But do not mention this thing ever again if you want your relationship to work.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	The whole point of dating is to figure out if they are a person you want to spend the rest of your life with.  Nothing more.  I know it hurts, but now you have your answer and can go on with your life finding someone who you belong with.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	Wake up girl just the fact he was talking to her in that way was a betrayal as far as if they only had oral sex or not whats the difference he still cheated find some one else|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	"He only had oral sex?" That's sex!    The good thing about dating is that you see a person's character and decide how much of your life you want to invest in that person. On the other hand this also defines your character, you have been with this person for 16 months and sees nothing wrong with him having sex outside of your relationship just for a "laugh".    When you are dating you put your best foot forward to impress the person you are with, Why? So they will stay with you. This is call "courting", you get to decide how much respect or disrespect you are willing to tolerate during this time. You need to ask yourself if you deserve the best in another person that you share your time with.     Ask yourself this, if your best girl friend that you trust with your most intimate secrets told a stranger would you still be friends?    Your boyfriend betrayed your trust, is he your best friend or your worst enemy, he did not consider your feeling when he made his choice.
4IFXHz80aa	In what part of my life. i associate music with almost everything. heres a sample...    Goo Goo Dolls--Iris:  i know this may be a given b/c of my name but there is a certain verse that really gets me, "And you cant fight the tears that aint coming/or the moment of truth in your lies/when everything feels like the movies/you bleed just to know youre alive. these words have proven true through out my life in many different situations. especially the "when everything feels like the movies"    Lenard Skynard--Free Bird:  now its not the lyrics that have effected me but the guitar solo. this guitar solo is exactly how my life was between the ages of 13-18. a lot of really hard and emotional stuff happened during that time and this solo reflects the hecticness of that period.      Deftones--Digital Bath:  the lyric "we are downstairs where no one can see new life break away" has proven true many times. when i listen to this song i remember that time period where i was always in hiding, almost creating an alternate life for myself. after i heard that one song, deftones has stayed in my life on a consistent shuffle.    Elton John--Tiny Dancer:  i just love this song. whenever i hear it, i always feel like i was born in the wrong generation.    The Beatles--Eleanor Rigby:  I like all Beatles. my dad is a fanatic and they were played religiously in my home.  Rigby was one of the first beatle songs i remember hearing besides Yellow Submarine. i love the tragedy of this song. it makes me feel emotions that i dont feel on a everyday basis. i get goose bumps every time its played; every time.    Paul McCartney--Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey:  this is another dad influence. actually RAM (the album) is my parents favorite McCartney. they say they feel in love listening to this album. i remember signing uncle albert at the park with my cousin. we would sit on the tire swing and spin and sing. one of the happiest times of my life.     sorry for rambling. i love posts like this.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	unchained melody - righteous brothers|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	"One of These Nights," by The Eagles.

Not as much now as I did before because I was going through more stuff before. But that feeling of having no one to talk to or reach out too is how I felt a lot. And then just becoming emotionally numb as well and not expressing anything.    Another song I relate to is "HeyYou"-Pink Floyd for the same reason
ENANtueuaa	He's into you! He's using "hanging out" as a casual term. It just means he wants to get to know you better, and enjoys spending time with you, whether he calls it a "date" or not.

Good luck!|`|wfnQNIhCaa	he def likes you...open your eyes|`|pI5pQPltaa	Hanging out in my opionon is just spending time with each other, chatting and talking. Nothing romantic.

Give her a text maybe, and explain  it's because you were 'pissed' and tell her that you won't act like that again because you cherish your friendship so much - which it sounds like you do.  Good luck, i'm sure it'll be sorted soon.|`|s4zxGI4naa	It feels really bad if a guy swore at me, it feels like that he doesn't care about me.

6dHIoJLVaa	Yes it's bad if you cheat, and it's way worse if you keep it on the d.l.  Why are you in a relationship in the first place?  If you don't feel he is worth being exclusive for, then you owe it to him to let him know that.    If you just need some sexual release then... relieve yourself.      The larger issue here is that you think it would be alright to cheat and not tell him.  If he is saying he wont cheat, why should you not trust him?  Part of why you might not be able to trust him is because you yourself aren't being trustworthy.  just be open and honest with what you really want with him.|`|96zZlJVYaa	why can you go over to his house if he can't make it to yours?  if the having that much problem coming over, then it best for you break it off with him and move on.  if you cheat it have a way coming back and bite you in the butt. and whom you're seeing on the side might come out and confront your boyfriend and you have trouble for sure. Or a friend of your boyfriend (you haven't meet) see you and your other lover and tell him what he have seen.  so, if you must then its best for you to break up with him and find you someone new.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Karma is gonn put ya back, so do what you want.|`|AA11313486	SMH.  You're the type of girl that will get pregnant unexpectedly.    get ur priorities in order before its too late.    But,  dump him and move on|`|Dm2zrJCRaa	You always have a choice. The decent thing to do is break up with him and then go hook up with whoever you want.|`|Ipyapngdaa	If hes never there for you when you need him, than simply break up with him, and move on to the other guy.  Don't cheat on him, its stupid, when all you have to do is end the relationship.|`|M63kq3AYaa	So because you don't trust him, for no reason, you think it'd be ok to cheat.   That means it's him who shouldn't trust you, only thing is, he has a reason.  Why not just dump him and go on a street corner, you'd earn some money for it as well.|`|gCR2DaJzaa	Well it's obviouse you don't really like this dude cuz if you did you wouldn't be asking if it's okay to cheat! But you know everything is fair in love and war. So have fun. Do what ever you want, cuz you and this dude don't seem to be allot into each other. so Yeah,|`|hQuYrsWFaa	break up with him.   if you're lonely, and you know he would cheat, and you know YOU would cheat, and you never see him, there's no point in a relationship. Like you said, it's only been a week.. and you're already off to a bad start. So why not break it off?|`|Lkj7HxAwaa	The guy knows something might happen(why do you think he never sent you a message back)    You cheat on the dude it's on you and I he might never want to talk to you again.|`|oZdMcksMaa	I'm always so worried of running into girls like you...|`|LKjMAqXgaa	If you're even thinking about cheating then you should break up with your boyfriend. Then have the other guy come over.  Cheating sucks and it hurts|`|W76Lzh3caa	You shouldn't cheat on anyone!|`|JlDcVTVsaa	How would you feel if your bf cheated on you?|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Cheating is never the answer. If you cheat he will find out someone and it will be over. So why don't you just break up with him then go out.  People these days.|`|VllE2s0qaa	no no no no no no no no!!!!!!!no!!!!!!!no!!!!!!!no!!!!!!!!!!!

uRvwLkIBaa	The best way to make new friends is to "be a friend" to people.  Be honest (no white lies).  If you can't say something positive say nothing.  Don't talk about yourself - talk about them.  Ask them about their sports, etc.|`|jY6eUN9haa	Jus be yourself.  you dnt need to act like someone else and try to impress them. ye i know dis is sed like time afta time but jus be yurself...get out there and you'll make frends...|`|g0CU1fBsaa	hahahah don't start a friendship based on lies!!!    you should join sports team, after school activities, drama club/theater, volunteer somewhere, talk to people in your class, etc etc. Get out there and introduce yourself. at first it may seem hard but keep at it and it'll get easier. just don't expect people to flock to you, you have to do the work.      hope i helped.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  answer mine please?
AikAMGQaaa	People all grieve in their own unique way. You will cry when it's the thing that helps you the most. Don't stop crying until you're ready. Don't over analyze it. I'm terribly sorry to hear about your dad!|`|0693daa45c31e1aac76068665a18a4a4aa	your going through the grieving process, everyone can relate to it.  what you feel is quite normal, the class is usually intended to explain whats going on in depth and  to help prevent any mental health issues [because grieving shouldn't become a mental issue]|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Yes, you'll feel like this for awhile sorry.

SpkWCvupaa	I have an overprotective mother too, and sometimes she can be extremely annoying. She never lets me hang out with my friends either and she has to approve of every single thing I wear, and it's not even like I wear slutty outfits. It's because we have different styles and so she has to mold me into a miniature her.     I suggest you talk to her and tell her that you are growing up, and that you need space. She just really cares about you and maybe there's something in the past that has affected her to be this protective. Just talk to her and compromise.|`|BdDRkt7eaa	She could be doing this because she loves you and cares about you a lot. On the other hand, maybe there is a lot of crime around and she's too afraid to let you out on your own. Another possibility of why this is could be the fact that you might be too young (how old exactly are you?). I wasn't allowed to go shopping on my own until I was nearly sixteen.    The best way to solve this problem would be to sit down and have a long talk with her. Tell her how you feel, and explain the entire situation to her. You could join extracurricular activities at school that would keep you after. I think this is the most effective. Slowly, she'll get used to your coming and going on your own because of school related events.    Another thing you could do would be to go out on your own when she's not there (leave a note, or she'll get mad, probably). Call her in the middle of your trip and explain where you are and tell her it was because she wasn't there. Always make sure to come back on her request or in time, or she might not trust you anymore.|`|tXh84hzSaa	You may already tried this, but talking to her would be your best bet.  Explain to her why you feel you should be allowed to do these things, and ask her why she is so afraid of letting you go. Maybe the two of you can work out some sort of agreement where you call her whenever you arrive, and she can see the things you buy when you get home. I know that probably isn't exactly what you want, but its a step.    Be sure not to get upset, or the conversation will become a fight and make things worse. And whatever you do don't use the "but all my friends get to" line.
ZcISKmdcaa	If you are worried about it then speak to your doctor (you can go by yourself, you don't need your parents with you and the doctor can't tell them anything )    I'd really have a word with your mum though, I doubt she'd be angry or hurt and would probably be as anxious as you to keep you well.    There has been research into a breast cancer 'gene' and as you only have your mum who's had it, (sorry, 'only' sounds an awful way to describe what your family's been through but you know what I mean) doctors may be reluctant to test you regularly (so bug the h*** out of them, it's your life you're worried about!)    Cancer is a horrible disease that affects a whole family, not just the sufferer, any checks that could catch it early should be grabbed with both hands!    Best wishes to you and your family|`|JZG7vpUlaa	Don't worry about it, wait until you are older.   Most breast cancer isn't genetic (or so they say).  You aren't at any immediate risk and if you wait another 10 years they will likely know much more about the genetics involved.
YbwDFvEaaa	I like the idea of distancing yourself physically for a period of time to get a better handle on your relationship. This way you will know that your relationship has standing power beyond pleasing each other physically, which is important when you consider how many people confuse sex with love. You'll be able to discover other reasons why you two are together and if not being physical with each other puts a strain on the relationship, you will know that perhaps you two aren't as compatible as you thought.<br>  <br>  Once you figure that out, you can better decide whether handling a relationship at school is worth the effort or not. Of course it sounds like the source of most of your stress is breaking school rules, not the relationship itself. Perhaps you two should refrain from spending time in each others rooms if it's going to cause trouble. The school enlists these rules for a reason, and whether you like to hear it or not, the school is looking out for your well-being. Pregnancy scares, sex, and all the problems that can go along with it are not something a teenager in high school needs to worry about on top of everything else going on in life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ixDTI97Aaa	You are not using protection?  You are asking to get pregnant.  <br>  <br>  If you want this to work you need to take responsibility for yourself and your life.  Wanting this relationship means doing it in a healthy, responsible way.  If you love this boy, do you really want to mess his life (and yours) up by becoming teenage parents?  Love him (and yourself) enough to really think about what you two are doing.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so hard on you, but one little mistake can change your life forever ...|`|MHgTA9Buaa	take it easy, you guys can spend time together as it is obvious that you two love each other, at the same time you guys need to be careful not to get in any trouble as you guys are in high school you need to try and abide by the rules. try to keep sex out of it at least at school.|`|uhN7WmXhaa	Yup,that is a good idea.If you really love him,stay with him,lest you will regret if you let him go.|`|a0372cd5b33b1ed0a4896118b78024c5aa	what is the question? You've already given your solution in the question? go for it.. i couldnt live without my gf that way.. being just friends was so impossible for me.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	You already gave it up, what difference does it make now.|`|NidCYkGpaa	WOW THAT SUX IF YOU REALLLY LOVE HIM AND HE REALLY LOVES YOU THEN THERE IS UR ANSWER MALE IT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SJasJMa0aa	ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh how i wish i was u! btw what is lint|`|XtsC1vyCaa	If you two love each other then stay together and tell your parents that you two love one another and that no matter what happens in life that you two will always love each other. You two can also just be friends for now and if you two think that is a good idea then just be friends for now and see how it turns out, if you don't think you guys can just be friends then try to work everything out between you two and make it work if it's worth it. I hope this makes sence to u, if u have anymore questions just email me at Mileshope28@gmail.com
4m9Hewq1aa	Aw, I have a friend just like you (although she is 14)! I'm very sorry to hear your personal view of your body. People joke around with my friend calling her a tree sometimes but I tell her she is more like a sunflower, haha. You have to embrace your height, sunflowers are beautiful and tall, just like you. In pictures my friend will try to stand near taller people so that she doesn't stick out but besides this no one even notices her height. Shorter people feel the same way, like they look different from everyone else and stick out bluntly. I'm sure you've heard this before but people long to be your height. So embrace the body which God has gifted you with, I believe that in time you will come to love and embrace your height. Also, where a cute feminine blouse or your favorite outfit to boost your self-esteem. Just remember "sunflower!" haha. Best of luck to you! -Alice|`|uVH046Fjaa	skank is tall! WoaA!    You may have broad shoulders. That sucks. Just wear stuff that doesn't make your shoulders look really big.|`|AA12108398	You will grow out of it. I'm almost the same age as you and sometimes i feel uncomfortable in my body too, what teen doesn't? haha! Don't be afraid to feel normal. I agree, you should start modeling!! It will boost your confidence and help you feel like you belong!    frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|IROLLdMIaa	u should model|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Are you a guy or a girl???? If your a guy and your 5'9 that weighs 120 pounds rofl, your considered a twig hahaha.|`|WcYRd9DLaa	well if you dont  have  wide shoulders  you can forget modeling, how about basketball?   well then maybe you can expand your mind, if you are really that tall, try the medical profession .  it does wonders for people like you who feel inferior to others.  believe me it  works and you will find common ground with your peers. try it. you sound young enough, dont let a physical attribute stop you from using your brain.|`|w5FJ6jtkaa	being muscular is good, its okay|`|yuh7OsHDaa	lol   u must be really skinny:P:P  just iunno dont be shy,  do ur hair nice, wear cute clothes, tall girls can be sexy too:):)  ahah im like ur age and 5'4    wear some nice makeup :)  and who cares about short people ahah  we wish we were tall|`|GapUVw4waa	I am sure you are quite beautiful, I'm short and have always wished I was taller.  Try wearing something that is very modest and feminine and think of yourself as a young lady.|`|gT1sWhgpaa	You sound as if you have the body of a Model...You may not realize it now but you will be greatfull later in life!! It's normal that you fell different because you are taller and people  may even tease you because of it. But one thing to remember is that everyone wish they were tall. You will see in a few years that being different will have a great impact in your life. You are so young now and not realizing how lucky you are.    You will grow out of it and always remember that you are beautiful inside and out

Guys your age probably aren't thinking about dating yet.  You are cute, but don't rush it.  You have lots of time to date.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Are you serious? Your perfectly fine, your just too young.|`|5gANvXyTaa	uhh your young girl forget about dates! worry about something else haha. and no you are not ugly.

Leda2ha0aa	I would pull that pre-nup out and take a look at what was written.  All of that information should be in there because any good lawyer is going to cover something like this.  It will tell you exactly what you would get 10%, 20%, house, etc. in case there was a divorce.    I would think if she was the one that cheated on you, it would favor you more in some way - but it should be written in the pre-nup.  That is why they are written.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	pre-nups vary by couple. They can say pretty much whatever you want them to say. again state laws would come into play here.    some states do not recognize pre-nups and in those cases a pre-nup would be a waste of money to pay the lawyers to draw them up.    some states have time limits on how long a prenup is valid.  That's why all those actors in Cali divorce before their 10 year anniversary.    Your best bet would be to start your research with a lawyer who specializes in PAs or divorce in your state and then to do a bit more research to find the state that has the necessary laws for your story to go in the direction you want.    FWIW:  when a PA is involved BOTH people should have a lawyer and NO lawyer would advise their client, male or female, to sign a prenup that states they get nothing in a divorce.    They would most likely send the PA back to the original lawyer with amendments.  It's called negotiating.      Draw up a rough draft of your plot, do a little research on PAs and divorce since that's the focus of your story, and don't insult your reader by being too simplistic or inaccurate in your details.    Good luck.|`|qwveESAFaa	There is no set language for pre-nup agreements.  A skilled attorney will write one up where all situations are addressed and there are no loopholes.|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	Why would you want something that does not belong to you ? Sorry for the cheating crap, but its not yours.    jp|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	It really depends on the agreement.    But if the lady is well off, and asked for the pre-nup, my guess is that it was NOT written for your benefit.     The thing to do would have been to ask your own lawyer to check the language before you signed.    Good luck.|`|vgNELAQIaa	Prenuptial agreements are in most cases, not worth the paper they are written on. They can be challenged and contested in the courts and ruled invalid. In reality, they are no more than an agreement so that both parties know where they MIGHT stand in a divorce.    In some countries and states, they have no validity whatsoever.    In countries where they are valid, the continuing challenges in the courts has brought about case laws to change the meaning and strength of some clauses in the prenup and again, change their validity.|`|sUMuJjZlaa	i think the pre nup is whatever you decide it to be, its written up as a legal document between the two of you and what you agree to be in there...i think|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Depends on the length of time married and possibly who's at fault. Most times though, I believe the prenup is binding. He may just get a portion of what they accumulated while married, especially if it was a short marriage. I'm no attorney and there may be in some states a way to get around some of them. I'm sure there are strict  clauses in this agreement and I'm sorry for him if she was the one who broke the vows.|`|b5UV15gCaa	"No matter who's at fault in the divorce, the husband would still get nothing". If he signs it and it doesn't state those terms he is screwed.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	There are plenty of ways around prenuptual agreements. Many PAs actually "EXPIRE" after 5 or 10 years and drawing up another one is often necessary.     Laws exist which permit women to have multiple affairs inside their own marriage  . . . . and not be held accountable for it. A man can be a good husband and father, and she can still leave him, take him for whatever  . . . . and even use his children as leverage.    Men are - BY LAW - more accountable than women this way. In fact , they are SO accountable, that if women had to be as accountable as MEN.... many of them wouldn't never even GET married.    MOST MEN DON'T WANT DIVORCE. Men wouldn't even bother getting married if they thought it was going to fail. But women say "Hey, if it doesn't work out, I can always get divorced" - all the time.    70% of marriages are initiated by women (mostly her idea)....  and so are 70% of of divorces.    That's the reality.    You don't even have to discuss the many LEGAL reasons which exist and prove marriage is a lose/lose situation for men . . . . . when women   are not even required to acknowlegde or have any respect for the MORAL reasons.    Even when a married man cheats on his wife . . . . .   he KNOWS he has alot more to lose than she does.    That's called PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. And men are willing (and required) to accept personal responsibility for their mistakes - and PAY for them.    Where women are NOT.
5RZ5tfRYaa	Maybe it didn't seem like it at the time because your relationship with your counselor has been over a year period, but looking back at what you've written here, I'm sure it's obvious to you: This is wildly inappropriate behavior for someone claiming/attempting to be a counselor. For you to be in a position of health and growth, you need to see someone (anyone) other than him as a counselor or psychologist. <br>  <br>  You know that he's interested in you sexually, and you know that he's NOT resisted the temptation to make that a part of your relationship with him. He has made overtures and displayed behavior that you should know is unprofessional, but moreover, is not conducive to any type of betterment on your behalf.<br>  <br>  So, feel free to stay friends with him (knowing he is interested in your romantically, and that he is married, and that any romantic involvement will be detrimental to his marriage and his relationship with his daughter), but for your own sake, do not continue to see him in a professional capacity. It will be doing you no good, it will continue to make you uncomfortable, and he's already broken your trust as a counselor.|`|qWRchU3Qaa	Wow he is extremely unprofessional! That is very inappropriate and not even remotely okay. I would tell him I was going to discontinue my sessions with him. You need to find a counselor who acts appropriately, responsibly and is mature.|`|7Tkf1e1Vaa	its illegal for a doctor/shrink to date patents|`|BO28Mn8haa	Seriously he seems like a creeper trying to find hot 20-somethings to talk to. I would cut ties with him.|`|rMgnmMN9aa	Um, DEFINATELY! He is almost possitively attracted to you and as a counselor it is completely inappropriate. I understand it's hard to cut him off because he's become a part of your life and a friend, but if he's married and with a child it is just not a good idea to let him continue this, it makes you look just as bad as him ya know? If he is really that important to you I would talk to him about it and let him know your not comfortable with this relationship coming from a counselor stand point, he should let up and if he doesn't you need to cut him off. It's unhealthy. The person who should be helping you shouldn't be bringing up more problems and questions in your head. That's just my opinion though, GOOD LUCK!

Self centered people are hard to bear.<br>  Stay strong may good people in the world for you to meet yet.|`|JwnHKTabaa	Tell her you're not interested in it anymore...you can't do much else without hurting her feelings.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	yes she does not want talk with you, the best will be search her in her house.

qwveESAFaa	Wow, this a really hard time for you.  You are grieving, and the process of grieving takes time.  Lots of time.  And, you have the added picture in your head of the way he looked at the funeral.      Try to remember him as we was when he was alive.  Think of what he brought to the world.  Think of ways he made other people feel good.  Maybe visit his family and share your grief with them.  Try to remember all the good things he brought into your life (laughter, friendship, etc.)    Wow, I'm really sorry for your loss.  Grief will end eventually.  You will always miss him, but it will be manageable.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	That image will always stick in your head sadly because you will remember how horrible that day was but as time goes on and it is easier for you to think about his death the image wont be as bad because you will focus on the way he was when you guys hung out and were friends.

Only time can heal the pain.|`|GmTMVmASaa	in truth, that was no longer your friend in that casket. it was just a shell his soul used to reside in, and now he is a spirit. please try to push that picture aside, because your friend is in a much better place. granted, he did go much too soon, but some of us do and some of us don't, you know. give it time okay, and it will ease up, i can almost guarantee that. i lost my brother, almost 25 years ago and it was awfull but we survived. i used to visit his grave sight at first and just sit there, as if i was visiting him. then it hit me, he's not here he's a spirit now and i have to accept that. maybe you shouldn't look at the pictures yet, maybe you should talk to him as if he was there in front of you. goodluck okay, and remember all the good times and keep remembering them.|`|vBkGGYJSaa	the choice is all yours.  you can continue remembering him laying in the casket, or you can choose to remember him the way he was in your pictures and remember all the fun times that you guys had together.  dealing with death is never easy and sorry to say it does not get easier with time.  because with time other friends of yours will also die.  I choose to remember my family and friends that have died, with the good times we spent together. in this way a part of them are still living in my memmories.
AA10905383	Has your mom been hurt by someone? That's always possible.  And I think you should tell your mom something that many many many parents have told us all growing up: "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."    What she said WAS petty and hurtful and wasn't okay. I don't think she's being oblivious. I think she knows what she said.    And you should probably tell her it was hurtful and rude and you didn't appreciate it. You were trying to include her in your happiness, and she was rude to you.|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	Your mum probably just doesn't want you to get hurt like before.Bring him around to meet her and ask her not to be rude to him and when he has gone explain to her how much you like him and ask her what she thinks of him.She might have something to say that you wont like but at least you have involved her and showing how much you like him.|`|pDNMVDZuaa	She thinks she is helping you avoid being hurt by another cheating man, but she's being covertly hostile in the way she tells you. It sounds like she wants you to get back with your ex, but again it would be nice if she could say that to you directly instead of using innuendos.
hKZ5dRbSaa	Not with mine, He gets all moody and starts going onn at me saying dont ******* ignorre mee and all that, then he starts punching things, and saying things that make me laugh.. It's quite funny actually :) But it works forr me|`|dQ99YWeoaa	It depends on the guy and how long you've been dating him.    If you've been dating for a week, he's probably gonna think you're being kind of ridiculous.    But if you've been dating for three months, he'll probably wonder what he did wrong.    BUT all guys are different!
Leda2ha0aa	OK, your name is sex kitten and you're looking for reinforcement that strangers are disheartened to see that you are married.  How about your hubby is sending out signals that he's not the nicest person in the world and this signal is sensed by the person behind the desk?  Don't make it all about you...|`|b26NgqOFaa	Maybe they recognize your husband from America's Most Wanted??|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Oh, get over yourself.      (He he, see what I did?  I reversed my answer and now all those thumbs downs look funny!)|`|bO2rzfISaa	They think you look easy, then they're disappointed that someone else will benefit from it.    Really, get over yourself.|`|hIe7qLN5aa	u know the answer    you want us to tell you that its because you are good looking ..maybe these guys want a chance..when ur husband joins you they know they are **** outta luck    there is the answer u wanted|`|HivQdKgwaa	LMAO at sweet tooth's answer , that's what I was thinking|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Are you obsessed with your looks?    Quit focusing on how other people react to you and focus on being a good person for yourself.|`|22d1fdbf6cde18545cea2086d1c58ec3aa	You probably come off as an easy conquest, to no fault of yours, so when men see a husband they are disappointed,  Get over it.  You are doing nothing wrong.  Most people need this reassurance or they turn into whiny little kids.|`|0C2deRjNaa	they definatly were thinking about hooking up with you but when they saw you had a husband they knew they didnt have a chance.|`|Q2Iq5RCYaa	OMG too funny, good answer Sweet Tooth, ROFLMAO|`|SovaFpN8aa	In the hospitality business, the assumption is made that a single female is more receptive to a friendly disposition. They are smiling and looking at you to give you a good impression of them. By the same reasoning, when your husband walks up, they do not want appear to be flirting with you. They are then trying to make him comfortable. The assumption is that in a couple, the man has the money, whereas a lone female controls her own money. It's all about money, tips and gratuities.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	When she gets to that point she can call the police if the apartment is in her name.  If it is in both names she will need to convince him or she will have to leave. She must first be prepared to kick him into the street even though he has no money and no job.  That's hard to do to someone you once cared.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Call the police and get him removed. If he isn't on the lease they can ask him to leave. Change the locks and arrange an officer to be present as he picks up his things.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	This depends on alot of factors, for instance is his name on the lease, if so she needs to tell the landlord that she wants off the lease and get herself out and leave him with the rent. If the place is under her name only she needs to talk to the landlord about getting him evicted. I don't know that the rules are the same everywhere but in my area you have to give someone a certain amount of days to vacate then the police can come and remove them.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Is his name on the lease? If it is, he has every right to be there. If not, she has every right to kick him out. He'll find a place real quick if he feels like he really has to.|`|4QHanq1Laa	kick him out. straight and simple... "get out of my house, I have given you enough time to get your act together and you havent, bye" then shut the door|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Times are tough, give him a break.|`|D37wc38Caa	ok.... that is ruff if you think about it... i can understand that the way the economy is that it is hard to get a job and a  place to stay... but he needs to be a big boy and grow up and at least look at the world the way it is and get up on his feet... i would give him 2weeks and if not then call the police..... as LAST RESORT!!!!! he cant depend on women to live for him and if he really cares about her he would want to make her happy.... i would tell him that.... but good luck:)|`|ml2FDYECaa	Come on. He has no job, and she wants to kick him out. If she does not want to be with him then she needs to make that clear, but has to be compassionate about his situation as a human being...not just the GF/X. Throwing someone out on the street like that takes no heart. Say she gets her way, and he leaves today...on the street. Will that make her feel better. Having a boyfriend without a job is one thing, and having a boyfriend without a job on the streets is harsh. If he's not looking for a job then shame on him. If he is having a hard time finding one then shame on her. Keep your feelings on the sideline, and look at the big picture from both ends. Even if you don't like him...keep it apart, and look at the situation. What can you do to help out? Help out by going through 'monster.com' to help your friend out...GL|`|W4BsmESnaa	She needs to be direct with him. Tell him she wants her own space and he should find his. Give him until the end of the week/month to find a place. It's not her fault he is a mooch. Helloww!? Why would she wanna be supporting a man with no job/car anyways?|`|16b306f00a8eed0cdd3e6f4dcef7e891aa	she needs to set a date and be firm with him,,,he has to leave,,if not she will have to get legal action,,its a tough one, I wish you luck, she could try and find him another place to make the transition for him easier.  I wish you luck|`|YyiESOpFaa	tell him to get out and watch him pack his bags and walk out the door.<br>  or change the locks.|`|ovrbTxHEaa	She can have him evicted.|`|ycQZQ3IVaa	That Depends...<br>  <br>  Maybe If She Doesn't Like Him Anymore She Can Make Him Repel Her. That Can Be Done By Adopting Habits Which He Considers Disgusting, And Going On Until A Level Where He Freaks Out And Goes Away.<br>  <br>  Or Else Maybe She Can Try Having A Talk With Him. If That Doesn't Work She Can Probably Say "I'm Sorry Honey But Things Are Rather Bad For Me At The Moment. I'll Need You To Pay Me A Rent Of "****" Per Month. And Maybe If You Can Split The Expenses It Would Be Fantastic."
icJ8Epdwaa	yes it worth it go kick his *** dats ur gf!!!
f4gRedsqaa	don't tell him you love him unless you KNOW he won't cheat on you. at that point you realize you can trust him with everything. if you're still having doubts about wether he would or not...probably means you don't know him as well as you could. <br>  i would say wait a couple months after being together to tell him something like that anyways...too soon makes you sound needy|`|TPZZESeeaa	show him you love him but don't tell him if you think it will run him off. actions always speak louder than words, just wait for the perfect moment to tell him or you could always wait for him to tell you. good luck i hope things work out well for you
WF1XnYnMaa	Your not crazy, it will pass have faith in your self and confidence in your abilities  Mildred is my Leader|`|XtLZXIEyaa	Tell a doctor.  Get a physical.|`|0C2deRjNaa	get a docters appointment and describe it to your docter. dont be to shy or afraid. thats what they are there for.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Listen, my son has an anxiety disorder and he takes medication for it.  He is not crazy.  He is smart, funny, and in college now.  You are NOT crazy, but you need to tell someone about this and get help, because nobody can tell you why this is happening.  I know you're gonna think this is the same as telling you you're crazy, but it's not.  In fact, I think YOU are crazy if you don't get this checked out.  Tell your parents and see a doctor and see what's happening.  Take care, okay?|`|wpi36XBAaa	I am not going to tell you you're crazy but I am going to ask you to see a doctor and describe what you have said here.  I think your symptoms are the early signs of an illness presenting itself. It may be a mental illness, but from your symptoms I am inclined to think there may be a physical cause. The "faint music" that you hear when things are quite could be tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) and could be caused by something in your brain/ear not being in balance. That inbalance may also lead to the pressure being put on the optic nerve or retina which may give you the feeling of seeing dark objects in the peripheral vision.  Please get it checked out before it gets worse.
pLExaQG8aa	I think its cute when guys blush and you can tell they are shy... but thats just me.  So think to yourself this is the end of the world. If she doesn't like me I'm not going to die and if I say something about it I might get a chance with her :). So just go up and be like "you are really pretty especially today:)" (don't say you look pretty TODAY cause it sounds like shes not pretty everyday lol). But just step up to the plate and do it or you might not get a chance with her and if you do you might.....|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	change ur frame of mind from I hope she likes me to I hope this girl is worth my time..u have value too...just because they are pretty doesn't mean they are good people. girls want to be more appreciated for their minds than bodies....looks fade with time.|`|bdeb4da71e553971e11438bdeb0fcdaeaa	I am a female and sometimes I blush when I am shy too. I think in the moment you are about to say something (in your case, tell her she looks nice) you may have to think of something sad. It sounds bad to do this, but I think it's the only thing that helps me from blushing. Good luck, I hope you tell her! Maybe everyone is too shy to tell her, and by you doing it, she will notice you.

ef6835c5c9fa76f67d29a4afd4a41572aa	For starters, this person is a waste of ur time and it's sad that u keep dealing with his bull.  It's time to cut him off completely even if he is ur child's father.  You know he isn't going to contribute in any way financially or emotionally, u said it ur self so many times why keep asking.  The only way things are going to change is if u put a stop to this misery that this person gives u and start moving on with ur life.  Don't let the child be the reason u feel u have to get drawn back, let me tell u if he was any kind of a man he would take u to court and get some visitation rights and want to take care of his daughter financially with out a court order.  U really need to grow up, I don't mean that in a rude way but the way I see this, u r not putting ur child's best interest at heart u keep playing at the mercy of this loser of a father's game.  It's really time to move forward and let go of him he isn't going to change.  Wut u need to do is get ur life together for u and ur daughter u owe her that.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	dont give him the number but when he wants to see the kid he knows where you live he can get  in his car and drive over there to see her  if he realy cares for her but sweety dont go back and give in its just false hopes you deserve better if he dont have a job and lies he is not worth the headache you can step up and give your kid a better life you dont need a man right now to tell you otherwise ...take care|`|wTevmGbmaa	I was in a similar situation with my first kids father... it was kinda like, he doesn't want me, but he doesn't want anyone else to have me either.  Anyway, I say NO.. don't give him the number, if he's not the man you want him to be after 8 years, he's not going to change now. And as far as child support is concerned, have you contacted SSI?? By law if he has an income he has to pay child support.  Good Luck Hun.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	I don't think you owe this guy anything.  Let him use his SSI and get an attorney if he really has good intentions, nothing will let him get in the way of a relationship with his daughter.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well i don't think he's gonna change if you give him the number. If you know he is not doing anything for your child, then you step up to the plate. most men do nothing for their child, i was going Through the same problem, but luckily i get child support. You need to be strong and handle the situation in a respectful manner. If you do not  want to give him your number then tell him you are not going to do so until he starts taking care of his child. Until he shows some improvement then you will give him your number. Also why are you still having sex with him if you are broke up..Sex over you number? i don't get that ! You need to end it all together, and have no relationship with him. He'll probably realize he's a loser, but you make sure you take care of your child the best way you can. Leave him in the past. He needs to understand that your number or you has nothing to do with you guy's child, and him taking care of her.

This is why the doctor makes the big bucks.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I'm not positive that I understand what you are asking.

I don't know all the details, but waiting one more week should not hurt either.  Typically the birthing process is natural...it just happens when the baby is ready.  Sometimes due to existing medical conditions the doc may want to induce and will only do so if that is what is best for the mom and child.  Good luck and Congrats!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Your question seems to be missing some information.

nUq4A3Xcaa	No relation.|`|EmuGiGjJaa	Very confusing, just say you are cousins. A lot of people do that in many cultures. All distant relatives are cousins, all older women are aunties.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Assuming that Andy's mom is not related to you by blood (only by marriage), then no...|`|CqB5ryTFaa	not by blood|`|RxjX1enJaa	No.|`|1LqMbG7saa	be more confusing<br>  yeah youre right hes jesus|`|CHCPnvksaa	I was waiting for Tom Arnold to pop up on my screen and sing his song "I'm my own Grandpa"|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	You are his child.
b3b9b6ca017841bec38087eb41e5b265aa	This is farely common in Japan and Korea.  Its an addiction like any other.. its having an adverse effect on his life and costing him more than time and money.  Look for a therapist who specialises in this or addictions in general.    The old saying is that you need tough love.  Thats confronting his behaviour (the elephant in the room) and not listening to any of his justifications for his behaviour (bullshit for short) Your parents are within their rights to make conditions on his staying with you.  They must be united, back sliding wont help him.  Not playing on his computer is not like going to gantamino bay but it'll feel like it to him.     Getting through denial is difficult and he'll be angry cos your taking his bottle away.|`|rEXce6NRaa	Your brother doesn't have his priorities straight, he thinks that the game is what matters instead of his family, his friends, and living a happy, healthy life. His rage is over the top and if he doesn't stop he is going to hurt himself and other people. Your parents love him so much that they are afraid if they kick him out, he won't love them anymore, or they won't see him again. They just have to get the strength to let go because if they don't, trouble is bound to happen. Don't stress too much.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	it would be a shame if the internet or computer went out and no one got it repaired. (hint, hint)|`|BqxYa9tEaa	Break his computer and send him to find another job.  Or better yet, the military. That will straighten him out.    Games aren't everything. He'll learn that on his own soon.|`|yTTXjQSmaa	Well games can get addicting... By any chance is he playing DotA because i know a lot of people that addicted to that game. Anyways you and your parents should have a talk with him. If all else fails its time for tough love. Have your dad threaten to throw out the computer or something like that...|`|MmfMJq9Paa	yes he does have a problem , it's called laziness and no dirve, did he start smoking weed recently?  By now he should be paying for his upkeep.|`|2gdYoVXdaa	"He hardly even sleeps at night because hes to busy playing his game."    Busy? that's his choice. No one can be busy playing a game!    Your parents can kick him out because he is over 18 nd legally an adult.|`|79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	Break that computer but make it look like it wrecked itself, this is a last attempt he needs to be enrolled in the army or something to get his act together, I mean games are fun but come on, I wish I had 2 jobs I need the money, it sounds like he needs to find out that he isn't going to keep getting supported to use everything up, And your parents need to straighten him out, either he gets a job or go to jail his choice, its cruel but you do what you gotta do.|`|8acuNYygaa	I think he does. 20 years old, living at home living off of a video game. Yep, sounds like an issue to me. Tell your parents to tell him to get a job and start paying rent or get out and tell your parents how much it's bothering you!|`|pjECqEVoaa	Yes he has a problem and your parents need to acknowledge that and seek help for him. He maybe going through a form of depression and if not treated could become serious.
mz7QEwWiaa	One of my best friends was dating this guy and we knew that all he wanted was sex and she didn't have a clue and she was definitely not in thepositionn to do anything like that. So any way i kept it to myself, anyway before anything could happen between them she broke up with him for another reason, anyway i was talking to her the other day and i told her and she said that i should have told her while they was dating because she would want to know. And anyway as a girl myself i would definitely want to know if a guy was thinking that way about me and i wouldn't think that the guy who told me just wanted me to go out with him, i would respect him for telling me so. Good luck x|`|fXwdecPyaa	i would wanna kno    and i would probaly beleive u ....if ur a good friend, and not sum jealous loser.|`|b8xZbxZ4aa	Oh my. The classic protector mode that guys often find themselves getting riled into. ;) It's appreciated, but not necessary. You know what? This girl sounds like she's a smart cookie, and I'm sure that she knows what this guy is after while going to a prom. She'll go with him as friends, and if he makes a move that is inappropriate, she'll take care of herself. Especially where there are plenty of people around. I wouldn't worry about it, and when she's done with this loser at the prom with their pity date, you should make the move!|`|wUwO2SW2aa	She knows your feelings are mixed up in this so she might think you are bias. You aren't her husband, her father, or her superman. She has to make her own mistakes; stay out of it.|`|l3HkNtiJaa	Well really if she does like this other guy, then whatever you say wont stop her from going out with him. And if he really is a jerk she will find out for herself. Just be there for her when things go bad!|`|sP0PmGCbaa	Best thing you can do as her friend right now is to tell her to be careful for prom night. Just say you really don't want her to get hurt and that you are just looking out for her. I would want to know as well, but considering the fact if I did like the guy, I might not believe you at first. Now why not go to prom? Go with friends, and in that way it would help protect her if that is what you want to do. Will it be that obvious that you are looking out for her? Not unless you make it to be. Go with a friend that happens to be another girl if you want.|`|tUSx6V0Paa	if she likes him then she will probably think you just wanna mess things up with her and him. if she's not really into him then... well she'll just go with him anyways because she kinda already said yes. all you can do now is warn her that thats all he wants. if i were you then i would get one of her friends to tell her for you (make sure that her friend doesn't say the message is from you) then she will be ready to handle anything that might happen.|`|Svu9RMBUaa	hmm be slick ( yes im a guy but im gettin advice form my cousin) okay so basicially be slick with it ask her acting as if u dont know anything and be like maybe i can take u and ask her nicely and be nice to her for the few days if nothin goes well takle one of ur best (girl) friend out.|`|zMYYow55aa	pretend that you didnt know she's taken for prom and ask her. when she tells that she's going with the other guy, say "ohh..." and tell her the truth about the guy, and how you are worried.|`|l5tEGMtTaa	let me tell you this now. If you tell her, she might get mad at first, and if she does, don't sweat it! She'll realize that you're only trying to protect her.    so! when you tell her, don't just blurt it out! just get the subject on Prom and go from there. Tell her that you really care for her and you wouldn't want to see her get hurt (corny I know but it'll work I promise)  then break it to her, tell her that you just found out that that guy is only going with her because he wants to get in her pants.     Once you do that, it's all up to her. she can get mad, sad or whatever, but it's her choice to trust you or ignore you.    I hope it works out! -__^|`|lgsRPdxWaa	i would want to know asap.   if i later found out that you didn't tell me when you knew i would get annoyed and lose trust with you. so i think you should tell her x    Please Please Please Answer; http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|yfoNIRRvaa	i think you should tell her to be careful, you like her alot and you want to look after her. dont say anything about him being a tool or asshole, just say your not going happy seeing her getting hurt.|`|Vi1tguOBaa	Different girls want different things. Just be you and confidant.|`|O9NIYqkLaa	let's get one thing straight.. i am a female.. so i might be a little bit more of help than a guy would... i would warn her ahead of time about the jerk and even if she does hate your guts for tellin her.. atleast she will have somewhat of a warning therefore she will be cautious about putting herself into a situation where she could be ummm doing something she doesn't want to do.. but is forced.. get the picture..|`|Qg3QBlCOaa	I would definitely want to know, and I think you should tell her. She deserves to know. You are her friend, and as her friend you should tell her what is going on. And since this guy is an ***hole, she should be aware of what might happen, because he might take advantage of her. And I know you don't want that to happen. And you never know, you telling her this might make you and her closer, and she might see you in a different light.|`|R03yB7Alaa	i would want to know.    just be straight forward with her.  tell her  something like "i dont know how you feel about me, but i care about you, and i really dont want to see you get hurt." and add more to that. just be honest.  its not like she'd shun you.|`|W392VlqOaa	Sometimes us woman have to learn from our mistake. Let her find out what a real asshole he is. Trust me she'll come running to you crying on your shoulder that's your time to open your heart to her and be there for her she'll be yours after that. I know you don't want to see her get hurt but sometimes you just have to let her do her thing she'll open her eyes.|`|IsfcnSaoaa	you should tell her. be easy about it though. go up to her and be like hey can we talk i found out some information and if its true i think you should know. and then tell her. if she gets a bad attuide about it just be like im sorry i dont know if its true or not[even though im sure you do] but i dont you to get hurt.  good luck  :]|`|sasDYyTZaa	well she might think that you're jealous so be careful how you make it sound if you do end up telling her.  a better way of approaching this is by telling one of her best friends that this guy wants to have sex with her.  make it seem really bad because thats the only way she'll be SUPER careful!
FfyVPvEYaa	You could sit her down and ask if she really wants to bring a child into her mess.  Maybe you could offer to help her clean it the 1st time, not every time   Some people are just oblivious to what is around them.      Is she suffering from any emotional problems?  That can cause people to not care.  Or maybe she was raised that way, in which case it would be normal for her.  It really isn't healthy, as you know, and you could bring your inhaler out whenever you start to wheeze.    I can't imagine how she will bring a baby up there, without the child getting sick.  And when it's time to crawl, the baby will get into all the mess?!  Uh, uh, you HAVE to talk to her.      Be her friend, tell her nicely, offer to show her how, it's for her and the baby's good.  As far as stress, don't worry so much about her stress, it's obviously got you going!    Hope it works out!|`|6GNqMJB4aa	Well, I don't think that there is any good way to tell her.  She will be offended because if you say something to her, she will probably wonder why you think that it is any of your business.  Trust me, I have been in similar situations when I have become fed up with how someone was doing something and when I finally said something, the person became offended, even if what I said was not meant to be offensive.  Peoples' egos are fragile.  Most people don't take criticism all that well and some people will become very angry if you say something.  However, having said that, I really do think that you need to say something to her because if her house is that dirty and unsanitary, then it will become a breeding ground for vermin.  It is unsafe to live in that kind of filth.  If her stove is filled with dirty plates, then pretty soon she will start to see cockroaches running around the sink and on the floor.  Even clutter can cause bugs, so her kids really need to clean their rooms and keep them clean.  I say all of this because I am not the most organized person and in the past, I kept my apartment messy.  Not to the degree that your friend keeps her place, but I was lazy and did not like to clean. Sometimes I would go into the kitchen and there would be so many dishes in the sink and after awhile, I would start to see the bugs, coming out one by one.  Now, I will clean because I have a daughter and I don't want her to be exposed to a dirty living environment and also, my boyfriend will nag me to keep the place clean.  So say something to her and make sure you voice your concern in a way that includes the fact that she would want her kids and her new baby to live in a clean environment.|`|AA10953999	Suggest a cleaning party, tell her you can start with your house. Try to leave some garbage around or something lol  Then tell her its time to do her house.     If that doesn't work then just tell her look, no offense but your house is a pig sty.|`|taye7BTuaa	she works and has four kids. sometimes people get overwhelmed and things get out of hand. suggest hepling her or for her to hire a cleaning service. otherwise butt out, it is her housr she can live the way she wants, do not go there. maybe someday she will get sick of the trash and odor and stsrt hoeing out herself.|`|AA11615109	Tell her truthfully that you're concerned for her health and also the kids. That's the truth, Right? No Beating around the bush. Don't worry about hurting her feelings. She knows her house is a mess. She may not care. Especially if no one has ever brought it to her attention. Tell me she does not have a spouse.  At this point, it may be too much for her to handle so she's gonna need help. Professional help.|`|P0cWf6OHaa	well if she s not poor.  than maybe like offer her a cleaning lady  just find one and recommend her to your friend. and tell her that the cleaning lady those a great jobbb, for less.    and about the dog well idk if i still had my dog and someone told me the dog is ruining my house i wouldn't appreciate  that but yeah.    i think the cleaning lady is a good idea.|`|NTWZ4rBsaa	well invite her over to your house and brag about how clean it is and tell her how you clean it. Well i don't know i am 10 and i am usually the one who does the cleaning in the house but that makes alot of going to friends houses|`|MRUuRTHeaa	I don't think you are rude at all, you have a legitimate reason for concern.  I'm not trying to be mean, but I feel sorry for her children, she should not be having more if she lets them live in a home like that!  I don't think this is the time to be nice, I think you should be straight up to her about it.  She might even have a mental health problem, if it's really as bad as you describe (and I believe you, I've seen a place like that!  You just wanna hurl!)    I really don't know what the first approach should be, but you really should just be forward with her!
EjyD1sXeaa	if you watch "People's Court" the advice is that especially with friends/relatives you should have a written contract to protect yourselves from any misunderstadnings if things go in the toilet.<br>  if it was just a random person moving in with you, you would definitely have a contract and lease.<br>  <br>  He has to understand that he has to pay half of everything, I mean everything! including half the mortgage.<br>  <br>  If he wants to be a little "entrepreneur"  like you then tell him to buy his own house.<br>  <br>  Also, if he eventually married you, and never paid into the mortgage, or paid only a small portion, then divorced you, who do you think would take half the house from you???<br>  <br>  Be very clear and careful<br>  Contracts and receipts for everything|`|8iYVHA1raa	I agree with you - If he refuses to help with the note, he was trying to use you.|`|s7seaaPkaa	it depends on his income.<br>  and if he makes a big increase in your utilities.<br>  ex. if by your self your utilities were like 50$ and now they are 100 <br>  then yes make him pay at least a part.<br>  and he should definately pay half your rent.<br>  anf for him own food. <br>  and if he refuses tell him he has to pay at least 400$<br>  in utilities and espences for the house a month.|`|FKR45WLPaa	What the crap?!  Was he living for free before?  Of course he should pay some, he should pay half.  You all should split the utilities and the house payment right down the middle.  Then you should each pay your own regular bills, i.e. your cars, credit cards, student loans, etc.  with your own money.  If he is like this now, maybe you should rethink this.  He probably won't get much better if the relationship goes farther.  Good luck with that one.|`|evJ2GEodaa	I think he should pay half of the utilities and also half if not part of the mortgage at least $200.00. However this all depends on his income and how much he can afford.|`|AA10237782	Dont let him move in bad idea u sound very independent|`|AHexXClbaa	Sounds like your boyfriend is either very immature or looking for a free ride.  Ask him to do a little research in your area as to what he could rent for $400. per month and see how it compares to sharing your home.  If he still doesn't want to pay, you would be wise to retract your offer as he is not in this for the long run.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Rent is just as much. I would make him pay half of everything including groceries. If you let him stay there for little or nothing he will keep taking advantage of you.
WF1XnYnMaa	Life is a struggle, he is dealing with his own inner problems caused by the situation, have faith and things will get better.  Mildred is my leader|`|zHwlGhIAaa	first of all, no truly responsible, God-fearing man would let his family not be able to pay their rent.  I can honestly say that my husband would do anything he could to provide and so would I.  I understand that you are big and pregnant now, but while you are at home on the internet you need to be researching childcare.  Because six weeks from the birth of your baby, you really really need to start working.  it's not about him becoming lazy, its about providing.  how are you going to feed and cloth your little ones if you have no money to even pay rent?  I would advise you to  put your pride aside and on Monday morming go to the appropriate place to apply for some assistance.  if you don't have any insurance what are you doing about prenatal care? you are in an awful situation and sitting at home taking care of the kids is not going to cut it anymore.  if he wont work, you need to work-somebody needs to work.  thats all it boils down to.|`|GHd84xipaa	your husband needs to find him a job of any kind right now.i may not be something he likes doing.the economy is touch,but hopely something will pop up when things get better and he will land a job he likes.he really needs to suppport his family.he can go to a temp agency see if they have any thing he can do for now.at lease he would be getting paid.have you gone to the health services and ask for help?they can get you food stamps and maybe other help.good luck.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	face the facts you need to go to work if your man cant support you I am sorry but you made those kids and its your job to feed them if he wont.unless he has some sort of education I don't understand how you thought he could do it alone in this economy anyway.

Is he WIFE - FEARING too?    He could afford to MAN UP immediately. But you could afford to not admit out loud that "you don't want to work because you don't want HIM to be lazy".     . . . . which is only saying YOU are lazy.    Frustrating, isn't it.
DAlakuWuaa	Look you said it your self you did things that made you deserve it. Thats cause and effect. Whatever you did you shouldve though it through. Now you have to face the consequences.

LqtD1uS0aa	try to spend less time with him, and dont allow the sweet things that he says and does lure you into him. he sounds like a girl with a lot of pms problems. lolz, but its true. just talk to him (one on one) and have like a serious conversation. you have to be sure that he knows exactly how you feel, or your going to be stuck in the same position. i think that this talk may make your friendship stronger, but your other feelings weaker. i hope this helps and good luck! 
6mfPS78baa	Not without first getting approval from my uncle who is the owner operator of the year 2009.|`|cLJT3yZNaa	Your still a sick puppy Brendon.
KFJJzLmTaa	you should tell them the truth. i think rob and ur ex is jealous and wants to get u to like them more than the other.
t45fRqbTaa	It sounds to me like he is in a lot of pain.  I lost a girl in a similar situation over a year ago.  I think about her every day and how things went so badly.  It still hurts...However, I, much like your ex, put things in perspective.  It didnt matter how much it hurt me because I did it to myself.  I learned a lesson from my actions, but I still loved her.  She had moved on, and I wanted the best for her.  I called her and left her a message thanking her for the great memories, the great love we had, and the painful lesson I learned when I lost her.      I think he is trying to make peace with what happened.  In my case, my ex never responded and to this day It hurts to think about her.  Now the question for you is do you want to talk to him and forgive him, and jsut leave  the past in the past.      Good luck!|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	You apparently helped him, and he can finally see he screwed up. It looks like he just wanted to say thanks, and sorry. He probably wants your friendship again. You should at least send a message to let him you know you're doing okay, and wish him good luck also.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	You made him a better person and he is thanking you. Text him back and tell him you're welcome and tell him if you forgive you or not. He likes you as a good friend I suppose. I'm not sure if he still has feelings for you.|`|f6qmRicQaa	I think he is trying to make amends for doing you wrong.  But I think you should still ignore it.  If he is the right guy for you it will wait.  He seems like he has some maturing to do before he can offer you what you deserve.|`|qwveESAFaa	I think he is just trying to say he is sorry.  You don't have to answer him, but if you do a simple "apology accepted" should be sufficient.  Then let it go and move on with your life.|`|LNkXcxlfaa	try not to analyze! you're just going to drive yourself crazy. i think you should take it in the most literal way. he messed up, he realizes it now. he knows you are a good girl and are going to go far in life. i'm sure he wishes things could be different but obviously you cannot change the past. i think he just needed you to know how he feels and maybe he needed to also tell you for himself maybe for some closure.  keep being strong!|`|AA11484395	He is apologizing for the way he treated you and he is saying, Good bye. He is saying, Good bye. You now have to accept that.   He just wants to clear his conscience in text before he moves on with his life, which is what he clearly is encouraging you to do in his text message. Accept the apology, and move on with your life.|`|Otu7QfqAaa	It sounds like he needed closure for himself... And from losing you he obviously grew up and is recognizing your talents of being a great friend... I would leave it at that..   You are strong and I am sure you too grew from the experience or learned a lot for you future relationships.. good luck..|`|HyfZ7s2Eaa	By the sounds of it you've obviously knocked some sense into him. Perhaps he's realized he's much better off with you, but as you havent spoken to him he knows he has no chance to get back with you. This may even be a way for him to vent away his feelings towards you.  I wouldnt go back to him though. Just be happy to be single again!|`|hBiKebSDaa	He's feeling guilty and wanting forgiveness so he can move on. Text back something simple like "Good luck to you too" and then he will know you received it and he can move on.  Let go of any anger towards him (for yourself) but don't go backwards (don't give it another shot ... it didn't work for a reason) ... one response and that's it.    Hope it helps.
ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	They try to belittle us. But we work by our blood,sweat and tears and are grateful that we did it on our own. If those women didn't have those men to keep them up then I bet they couldn't make it in this world. I used to have a friend, she worked but relied on her b/f to pay her and her kids bills. She wanted a new car and wanted to show her b/f that she could get one. She was first going to buy a used car and took me to look at it. I told the saleman to forget it, she could get a new car. We went to another dealership where she purchased a sports car that she wanted, fully loaded and with the payments that she wanted. Well, I was the one who did the talking for her. She tells everybody and her b/f that she did it on her own with NO ONE'S help. How do you think that made me feel? We weren't friends anymore after that.  Her choice.   Women like us can pride ourselves of doing things on our own two feet and know we do not have to depend on someone else.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Tell these women to mind their own business and worry about their own lives not yours.|`|b26NgqOFaa	Uh. I avoid talking money with my friends. Who exactly are you talking about anyway?|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	You need new friends.  My friends and I don't talk about things like spending money...|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Its a combination of ignorance and arrogance.  There is almost nothing more pathetic than a person who has not had to make their own way in the world.|`|db306e4bfa25607fa2a51708448bb06caa	They're tired of supporting women and your kids with their tax dollars.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	If they havent walked in your shoes they dont know whats it like and should not be commentating
drxoohVRaa	That is really strange since you said he's your best friend...and you say you have no idea why. Has he ever been this way before? Maybe you hurt his feelings unintentionally. I guess my advice would be to just think hard about when it started that he became mad at you and see if it was something you said or did. Or maybe you could ask him yourself if you feel brave enough, either through email/facebook, or in person. Good luck!|`|qwveESAFaa	Sounds like your 'best friend' is not a very nice person right now.  This is not a stupid question. It's hard to be taken advantage of emotionally by another person who you initially trusted to be your friend.Maybe you shouldn't try to be friends again.  He has breached your trust.  Try looking for other friends who will really care about you for who you are.|`|2srftNhwaa	obvious theres something wrong, but that's wat friends are for, they are ther for you even when their the last person you want to see. you and your friend should talk about what ever is goin on,some times guys just need to talk to someone who will try to understand what there going through and to give them some advice|`|AzyhcaRwaa	confront him about the problem one-on-one, face-to-face. I mean if you don;t know something, why not ask? There's apparently somehting wrong and there's a way out.Be positive and remember every problem has a solution. Crying is a great release/venting form but don't cry unless the problem is really worth it.
Mp9aqqrDaa	I would be pretty upset, too. If anything, it's quite inconsiderate and shows lack of character. Plus it sounds like "thunder stealing" to me. Just a tip: make sure you don't share too many ideas with her or your aunt, or else you might "accidentally" end up with similar dresses or she might copy a cool idea you have or she might like your color scheme so much she decides to go with it, too. It happens! I've been sharing ideas with my friends, and they ALWAYS ask if it's ok if they use one of the tricks up my sleeve, but if your cousin isn't considerate enough to even call you about picking a date pretty much on top of yours (even if you aren't close, you're still family and that means a shared guest list....if it was like, a week apart or something, it wouldn't be a big deal, but one day? Yikes), well, I doubt she'd think twice about snagging some of your ideas. Keep them to yourself and save yourself the deja-vu effect, especially since your cousin's wedding is right before yours.! And good luck with the wedding. Try not to let her ruin your day, it certainly isn't worth it if she can't be considerate.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I know it's upsetting to you, but she's not obligated to consult you before she picks her wedding day.|`|AA10975867	You got engaged and you set your date. Then your cousin got engaged and for whatever reason she had, has set her date to be the day before. Now, there could be some reasons for this date that you are not aware of so please relax and give her a bit of slack. Your wedding is on a traditional Saturday so probably all the relatives will attend yours due to Friday being a work day,etc. Perhaps your cousin has a smaller budget to work with and wanted a much smaller event so she purposely chose the Friday, thinking that a lot of people wouldn't be able to attend and her costs would be lower. That particular week may be the only weekend that her fiance's family is available, or that he can get time off work for. It may be the only weekend that her best friend can attend. Instead of using the same day as yours, she chose the less popular Friday. It has been MONTHS since your engagement and you just found obout about the dates two weeks ago so that tells me that you and your cousin are not very close at all. You obviously have different friends and travel in different "family circles" as well or you would have heard a lot sooner. If one of my clsoe cousins got engaged, her mom would have been on the phone to my mom (her sister) within seconds and all the planning would have been done with constant communication. As this is not the case with you, I would just say go ahead with your planning, ignore the other event, attend the ceremony if you are invited and only if is in the same town- because you will be far too busy the day before your own wedding!! If only your parents are invited, they should simply send a lovely gift a couple of weeks ahead (so they don't think it is a re-gift!) with a note saying "We're so sorry we can't attend but we will be far too busy with last minute functions for our own daughter!" You are not being a bridezilla - yet- and I hope your own good manners will stop you from becoming one. Perfect weddings happen on television. Real weddings come with all kinds of little irritations. With luck, this little glitch will be the only problem you have! Good luck. (I was just wondering - could HER date be June 5, 2010? that is a Saturday.)|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|FXCoGD44aa	You're not being a bridezilla. I would be pissed as hell! She was probably jealous of your engagement... then when she got engaged, she wanted some spotlight too.    But the rudest is the way you found out. Call her up RIGHT NOW and ask her if she is seriously having her wedding the day before yours. Ask her specifically WHY she picked that date.    OMG... I'm pissed off just thinking about it. I couldn't imagine if someone did that to me!|`|i41tUVtIaa	That is a VERY rude thing to do.  If people have to travel far to hers they will not be able to come to yours.  How close are you and this cousin?  It sounds like she is the one being a bridezilla.  Your date was set first and she should respect that.  People will probably have to decide whos wedding they want to go to more. If you cant change the date then all I can tell you is make your wedding so memorable people will be talking about yours instead of hers!|`|w1necKzYaa	did she know what date you set? maybe there is a good reason that she set that date is it special to her? does she know that you are pissed at her for this? I think you are being a bridezilla she could have had the same day as you and she didn't! did you talk to anyone else that is engaged to see if they would care when your wedding is?   don't be so self centered!|`|gli7SbBoaa	You were engaged first, you set the date first (from what I gather anyway), hell yeah you should  be pissed!  Especially to find out that way.      You could try sitting down and talking to her.  That might not work though.  You could also try sitting down with your entire family and explain.  I doubt family will want to attend two weddings in two days.  Just don't try to out do each other, like "Oh I'm getting out my invites first!" or "I booked this place, you can't have it!"|`|AA11082914	No, you're not being a bridezilla. I'd be ticked too. That's kinda messed up, especially if the weddings are in 2 different towns. How in the world are your shared family going to make it to 2 weddings that are 3 hours apart??    One good thing to this- you've got the Saturday wedding. People are more likely to attend a wedding on Saturday than on a Friday (due to work schedules, etc.).|`|5TLGa3awaa	That was mighty insensitive of your cousin to do. Is she the competitive type?  I can't imagine why someone would do that.  You have every reason to be upset.|`|mXIVMmPSaa	Are you close to this cousin? Will you have several family members who will want to go to both weddings? Do you live near each other? (If so, that actually might make travel easier for out-of-town relatives, since they only have to come for one weekend)    It isn't necessarily inappropriate since she can have her wedding whenever she wants, it's just really inconsiderate of the relatives you share who may be in the difficult situation of having to choose which wedding to attend. Have you talked to any of your relatives about it? Or her? Is she even aware of your date? Would either of you reconsider?    If you wanted to be snarky about it, you could just send out your save the date cards and/or invitations ASAP and beat her to the punch.|`|rZXQvA75aa	I would completely be upset.  Have you said anything to her? Are you weddings at least in the same area so that people who are traveling won't have to choose?  If not I would get your save the dates sent out followed by your invites ASAP|`|RuKK1LYiaa	This is completely wrong of her, shes trying to steal the spotlight from you, if she hasnt booked anything yet try talking to her about it and see if she wouldnt mind changing it for you.|`|DqetlSB6aa	No. she wasn't wrong- maybe inconsiderate but not wrong.  you don't schedule weddings around someone else's schedule you schedule around your own.  Maybe there's a sentimental reason maybe it works for them maybe that's the only date that was available at the venue she chose.  there could be so many reasons why she did it.  have you asked or just assumed that she did it to screw you.  you just said you found out 2 weeks ago that you cousin got engaged in September.  You guys cant be that close if you're just finding out, right? Maybe she set her date earlier and your just finding out, like her engagement. Realistically, no one is obligated to share the details of their wedding with you.  Might be courtesy, but it just doesn't sound like you guys are close anyway, why would it have crossed her mind to call you and ask you what date you had set?|`|MLFBsZnUaa	Wow...to me, it actually sounds like she might possibly be trying to out-do you. I say that because in your most recent edit, you said that your aunt told her to discuss it with you first before she chose that date...if she decided to go for it. I would be totally P.O'd as well. I would sit down n talk with her about it n if she doesn't let up at all...then (as I saw someone else suggest this earlier) I would send out your invites ASAP! Beat her to the punch. (Kinda sounds sorta like that Bride Wars movie...lol). Well good luck! June 6 is a great day! lol thats the same day I'm getting married. Have had it booked and arranged since last April, so I completely understand being pissed if someone who knew for quite a while in advance booked for right before mine. lol good luck with everything!|`|T7HuKzZcaa	it sounds like you two are really not that close if you did not hear it from her.  are you sure your even invited to her wedding? is she invited to yours?  are there any family conflicts that made her do this?  sorry to ask so many details, but sure does seem funny that no one discussed this with both of you .  i'm sure some family members will start to grumble if they have to go to back to back weddings in a 24 hour span|`|4n69GRxoaa	a date can be set at any time|`|C3552Zjbaa	I think that she is just jealous. and she wants all of the thunder. I would be so pissed off. Do what you think is right.
8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	If you have her employers information and all her personal information and you have not financial supported her, including insurances, medical, dental...    Comply this information for your attorney, if a judge can see that she has been able to live successfully for all this time without your support you may only have to pay a minimal amount or nothing if she has not contributed to the support of your children, because it will be a wash.     You on the other had will want to keep accurate records for all the necessities of your children, because she will have to paid child support.     If she could get a specific amount it would not come from her just saying so, she needs to get a judge to agree to spousal maintenance, you will have to be served with a Notice to appear and you would be given a chance to respond to a judge why she is not entitled to support.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It could be.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Ask your lawyer. In some states, yes, but others, no.|`|b5UV15gCaa	I think I would talk to an attorney!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	OK.    Spousal support...otherwise known as alimony is a different issue than child support.    If the court orders it, you have to pay alimony.  But without a court order, I don't think you are obligated.    Good luck.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	lt could be possible, depends where you live.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|1lUxd2t9aa	that's embarrassing...but what's there to do now? what's done is done. everyone's human    please answer mine...  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|EsnFmcMFaa	thats funny    im guessing you were freak dancing or grinding    um just say u farted and thats it|`|86Bb8CDraa	Lmao if he asks about it... just say, "oh please, like you've never farted around me before."

EwaPHsNSaa	Uncircumcised without a doubt!    I used to get chafed and raw during sex with circumcised partners (and I didn't know then that circumcision actually drags pubic hair onto the base of the shaft) and we'd go through tons of lube-- and the water-based stuff is full of glycerin so I had chronic yeast infections too.    My husband is intact and the first time we had sex I was amazed at how different it was. Sometimes circumcision proponents will say that the exposed rim of the glans can be felt better when circumcised, and that is probably true. What they don't tell you is the the rolling foreskin on an intact penis creates a much larger ridge that is far more stimulating.    And uncircumcised penis actually lubricates, it glides inside the foreskin so less chafing and the added sensation of the rolling foreskin is a lovely sensation. Plus, stimulating him manually never requires lubricant and there are more oral options. :D|`|Yb99bIdnaa	Male here, but I'm gonna tell you what an ex-GF told me:    She'd been with her share of guys before me, but all of them were circumcised so I was her "first" in that way. She thought it was normal to get sore from sex, and she'd never had an orgasm from intercourse, because after 10 or 15 minutes, the pain from friction would become unbearable and she'd have to stop. Even if she used lots of extra lube, it only bought her a few more minutes.    About a minute into our first time together, I asked her if I felt any different. She said it was subtle, just a bit smoother feeling, maybe more enjoyable but not a big deal. It wasn't until 5 position-changes and about 40 minutes later that she glanced at the clock and did a double-take. There's the difference! The foreskin works to relieve friction, and try as we might (marathon sex!), we never found a point where she experienced discomfort from it.    Cons: It's more complicated to perform fellatio on an uncircumcised guy. Likewise, an F-14 has more controls than a Cessna. Also, it can smell if I'm sweaty, so a moment with a washcloth is a good idea before having a visitor. (The same thing applies to girl parts, as I'm sure we all know. Smegma is produced by males and females!)    Also: I can't prove that this is related to the fact that I'm uncut, but I've been told by more than one lover that my style is very different. One went so far as to call me her favorite lesbian. My theory is that because the foreskin is analogous to the inner labia and clitoral hood, natural guys have a more innate understanding of how to touch those parts. Just something to think about.|`|K4zsztkRaa	All the girls I know have said uncircumcised because it feels better.  These are the girls I know that have been with both. Not just one. You can't not have been with one and have a prefrence. It doesn't make sense. You can't say I like jelly beans over gummy bears if you have never tried gummy bears.    I am gay and have been with both and I like uncircumcised because there is a lot more you can do with it. Plus the guy is more sensitive and thats more fun.    -Connor|`|HbaxtX44aa	eewwwww....  im over it  it looks funny  and if they arent really clean,it smells  it looks funny and it smells...  EEWWWeeew|`|cFigSdt0aa	I prefer uncircumcised based on experience. I just think the movement of the foreskin feels better and makes it "less rough" during intercourse so it feels better. I also think that the guys I've been with that were uncut are more sensitive so it's easier for me to pleasure them, and it's easier to give a guy a handjob when he has a foreskin. The only con I can think of would be if the guy doesn't keep himself clean down there (but so far I haven't had that problem). To be honest, it's just a minor preference and it doesn't really matter that much either way.     Hey Connor, stop stealing my links, lol.  ;)|`|jOFRD9sLaa	who cares girls have foreskin and get smegma too. don't let them fool you.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	Go to this website, it answers your question i think:     http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/...|`|d47a64c1de80df6a39538cd4c77a414faa	I personally think uncircumcised is more enjoyable. Being that it seems to be longer in size and a lot more sensitive. On the other hand, it doesn't look as attractive as a guy that's circumcised, but that really isn't a big deal when every other aspect is supporting the latter.    --And if an uncircumcised guy is "smelly" then obviously he's NOT clean. I've never had that occurr, since I prefer to be with a man that has a good hygiene routine. Hence, if a man smells down there, its not because he's uncircumcised! A circumcised male and even a female can smell down there just as easily, if they don't know how to use soap and water regularly.
E3yOmel9aa	Respect her, she is your mother. Ask her to respect you and your opinions as well. Maybe she has a reason for feeling the way she does that you do not know and are too young to understand. A good reason without explanation can come across as ignorant or racist but you just might be ignorant of her.|`|XR2BCYOSaa	I freaking hate people like that.  Tell your counselor or just give me her number I'll tell her off.|`|03b08a5d9ac92bf7e49cf04e0fc3b46daa	Tell her that race isn't always the thing to be concerned about, its about how the person acts and his/her beliefs|`|JKtthwaMaa	So you're hispanic and your mom is rascist against hispanics? thats odd.    but you can't really do anything about it. you have to learn to deal with it because older people generally alwayst think they are right and don't switch mindsets easily.|`|eoZJO3J8aa	dang that suck. if you guys are hispanic does your mother keep contact with her family in Mexico?   tell her that she came from a "paisa" family (you should know what that word means if ur hispanic) and not everyone is a bad person. tell her shes ruining your youth with her ignorance...|`|LJDiSCCNaa	Did you know in order for a stereotype to occur, there has to be a large amount of truth to it first?    Your mother most likely was raised to have certain beliefs about these races. As she aged, everyone she encountered who was these races, proved the teachings right. Her mind has not been pursuaded to believe any different about these races.     If people realized that we each are embassadors of our race, and we are responsible for how others view us, then perhaps we could eliminate such prejudices and racism.     To dislike your own mother is to dislike 50% of yourself. This is not good for your mental survival. Instead of just pointing a finger and calling her names (which- by the way- is something you learned to do from her) try changing her mind about these races. Help her have positive experiences with these other cultures.|`|8acuNYygaa	That's really odd and a really tough question. I guess just keep being with your friends and prove to your mom that your friends aren't what SHE thinks they are. You know..? If she still doesn't like it, than oh-well. They're your friends not hers. I know that sound disrespectful and all, but she's wrong for being so judgmental about everything. As long as your friends aren't bad influences. Have fun and good luck!|`|jtIOl4t0aa	i think you shoild tell her to face her own race and stick up for yourself even tho she yells at you and show her that when people from black or hispanic races do bad stuff it is there faught cuz they r an indiviual

Look, if you keep your head down and hide, you'll probably be all right for years. But right now, with the economy nose-diving and all the trouble over foreign workers, if they find you they can sling you out.The kids will stay behind with their dad. You need to marry their father if you can; even then it's not plain sailing as you are supposed to return to your country of origin and apply for a spouse's visa, but if you were married there would be a chance. As it is right now, you haven't got a leg to stand on and your only hope is that they don't catch you.

Dont mention it to him cause he might get embarrassed about maybe not being able to spend to much on you.|`|j6PrOaZgaa	lol maybe he just wants to make you feel good about it|`|AN9PdKmgaa	He must feel like it made him more of a man to spend more or he is embarrassed he is so cheap|`|GHd84xipaa	maybe he want you to feel extra special,but he really didn't need to lie about the price of the gift.you should be happy that he bought you something.he probably would think he was cheap.|`|AA11990465	Try asking him why he felt he needed to lie to you about it. My guess would be that he doesn't want you to feel as if you aren't worth more to him.|`|yuh7OsHDaa	well thats gay|`|hlq3Eo0haa	if he told you the truth would you of got angry with him. dont forget  you are not supposed to ask the price of a present as that is classed as rude|`|wjOMEHoHaa	he wants you to feel expensive. like your worth more than that.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I don't know why he'd feel the need to lie unless he thought you may think less of him if he didn't buy you a more expensive one. He may wish he could buy a more expensive gift and doesn't want you to think he's cheap. He wants to see your eyes light up because of an expensive gift, and he knew they wouldn't with a cheaper one. Give him a break and be thankful he remembered you. It's sweet of him no matter the cost. No reason to lie about it though except didn't want to disappoint you and he felt he might if you knew the real cost.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	You can answer your own question with a question:    Why do you feel the need to ASK how much a GIFT cost????    That's tackier than any cheap perfume.|`|zrFzbDHUaa	It was rude to ask him how much he paid for it.  It was the thought that counted.  Obviously he was embarrassed, you should not have put him in that position to lie.
MQ3EyxQYaa	I have really strict parents too.. I'm not sure if they're strict to that degree but they get frustrated and yell and I always rant to my best friend about it. All you can really do is be there for her.. because if you're not living in the house you don't know what it's like and it's hard to give advice. Listen to her, be there for her, comfort her. I'm sure her parents just want the best for her and pressure her because they worry. Remind her that. Good luck to you and your friend.
0BX1yFGuaa	I agree with the first post...they'd be in the trash.  I don't like the shot glasses, koozies, single wine glasses, or pretty much most favors.    In lieu of going with the koozies how about a sample of a microbrew if he's a beer fan?|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	I have been at one wedding where they gave koozies as favors. They were black with white writing - name of couple, and wedding date. Some of the college kids liked them, but I thought it was a bad idea. Mine hit the trash the minute I got home.
c5501d7af062f728e28883d70bec4816aa	its good that you are asking yourself this. you should tell her. why dont you two just have an open relationship. dont know about her but it sounds as if that would meet your needs really well. just make sure you dont end up using her or being unfaithful. and its also important you stay true to yourself. good luck  answer mine please  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|AIftgLEGaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting to take things slower. A relationship is a two way street. You have to think about your needs as well as hers. If she really cares about you as much as you say, she should accept the fact that you want to slow down.|`|YjXmuKuPaa	Sorry but your first mistake was sleeping with her.  Women give sex to get love and men give love to get sex.  Because women give sex with emotions, she feels that you are into her as much as she is into you.  You need to man up and tell her the truth, that although you like her, you are not looking for anything serious and you are sorry if she took your relationship the wrong way.  Either way she is going to be hurt but she will respect you for being honest|`|pGNyeEhRaa	do the "smart thing" don't second guess yourself or her.  If you don't like her- tell her what your feeling.  if you think things are moving too fast, which is probably normal,  just tell her!!  you'll be quite surprised to see what her reaction is, many girls like guys who are willing to take it slow and not pressure her into what shes not ready for.  trust me, i get you.  its the only way you will get rid of that confusion and have sleep for once.    best option is for the both of you to open up and tell each other what's going on.

bvwYVGJOaa	Trust me on this, you don't wanna go Friends with benefits because the other person will develop the deeper feelings whilst other just wants to be satisfied, fulfilled of attention and one of them gonna hurt.    I think you need stay away from relationships like not go for any guys and no sex or snogging as you've just come out of a crazy relationship. Since you're outspoken person, why don't you be direct and honest (whilst being sensitive with him) and say you're not interested in anyone right now and tell him and assure him he'll get someone he will like soon and just to wait for the right girl. Just say something like "I think you're a nice guy but i think you should go for the right girl who is looking for the same thing as you...etc"    Yes you do need a guy who is more direct, speaks his mind and vibrant person like you but it's also nice to have a guy who cares and loves you too so at least have that into consideration but don't go for this guy since you don't want him that way.     ++PLUS++ you don't need your friends infleunce to be with him, its only your decision..|`|l3UZMwOcaa	date him. don't let your friend influence your relationship. i feel that because your friend said that about him, you started to distance your self from him. give it a chance. you have nothing to loose except your meaningless sex with him. and beneficial friends are easy to find. go for it. he sounds nice.    x|`|dLqIpnpdaa	ok so i would say if your willing to be friends with benefits you might as well just say yes and go out with him... and talk to him about the clingy and jealous stuff  and the  fact that yall have diffrent personalities makes the whole thing more fun..thats how me and my boyfriend are and we get along great because of it.|`|urDhIpogaa	just go out with him youd just be doing the same you are now but sometimes you go out on a date. and if it gets to be too much break up with him.|`|CTvjt1PXaa	If you want a relationship then talk to him about the over bearing-ness.  If not it seems like yall have a good thing going right now.  If you can stay friends with benefits and still be ok around each other and other guys and girls then don't rush anything.|`|PCBQbQmraa	Just tell him you need time to be single because you just got of a bad relationship your doing the right thing but the thing is once you see him talking or flirting with a another girl i think you might get jealous as well, but you need this time to be single and just be fun and free!
2vaGZ4eDaa	Well, if you are to assume that Christians must suffer in silence and accept a bad marriage, then you are trapped.  Would God really want you to struggle this way?  I don't think so.  My advice is to see a therapist, because they can help you sort out if there is anything valuable left with your marriage.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Stop believing in fairy tales (Do you have a Christian marriage? No, you don't) and make a real-world plan. Get a job yourself, for instance. Then, when you can support yourself, get a divorce. Your beliefs in "Christianity" and your ideas about how you're supposed to be a wife because of them are just hurting you. Set yourself free; let go of the mythology.    EDIT: Never2lates comments illustrate what I'm saying perfectly. How ridiculous.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	You don't like? Like what? Too little info.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	is your husband a christian also? if so go to your pastor and ask for help if not you have been yoked unevenly which the bible warns against and this relationship may be doomed.|`|Znzx92mEaa	As a Christian wife unless your husband is being abusive or unfaithful the d word can't happen. I'd try spending more time at church and see about consoling for the two of you. Also, maybe your husband needs a check up. If he's a diabetic and his sugar level is up he will be very tired and anxious. Any thing could upset him if he's just dying to sleep. Also if his sugar is low he will be confused easily. Which could also upset him if you insist on questioning him about things that he just can't grasp. I've been there done that.|`|0C2deRjNaa	get a hobby. join gym or pilates class. try to work things ourt with husband like with counseling or go camping with him, or take walks in the park with him.|`|02f1bc31749f26b37d78e2e8ad505a6baa	Is he retired? Is that why he is home all the time now? The best thing to do is get out of the house. Do some volunteer work or get a part time job. Being around other people will give you a break and will boost your self esteem and get you out of this depression.    Also, ask God to soften your heart of stone to flesh and put the love back into your heart for your husband.
3UaRXGWoaa	if he's enough of a jerk to dump you for another girl after being with you for a year;; forget about him. he's not worth it, and would most likely do it again.     what do you expect? he's a guy. they generally act before they think and then dont even notice if they end up hurting you if you dont go right out and tell them that they did.     if he cant hang out with them, and doesnt even talk to them; he shouldnt be going out with them in the first place. that's pointless.    it barely seems like they're going out. and if they are, its probably only for the title.    go ahead and tell him how you feel, he deserves to feel guilty for causing this situation in the first place.|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Move on. As much as it may hurts its what is probably for the best.|`|jCUiWihtaa	just from reading the first part hes a jerk. he just cares about the girls so dont talk to him|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	There's no point in telling him anything until you KNOW he's free again.  And even then he might not want to get back together.|`|nJNsM9efaa	He probably doesn't want to have the phone on him because then you could check it.  He may be conflicted about you and her so it will probably take a little time to sort out.|`|y3tPrTtBaa	You are missing the point - he had no regard for your feelings, he dumped you for another person(more than likely had established that relationship while he was with you), had his fun and totally ignored you and your feelings, now that he is done with her looks for a sure thing, a booty call type of relationship.  When he is not with the flavor of the week he has a sure girl...you should have a little self respect and move on.|`|e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	As you do not know what is going on with him and the other girl ...make it clear to him that you just want to be friends. And while you are at it tell him how you felt when he would not take your calls or texts.Ask him did he think it was fair to you that he treated you like that. Once he gives you the answers to those questions you will know if you should move on or what and where you stand with him.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	If you really love him, tell him. You will feel 100 times better after you tell him. There is always a chance he still has feelings for you.|`|w5FJ6jtkaa	you should know before you tell him, because it may hurt you if he rejects you, again|`|PQ21qz9Xaa	It sounds like since he can't get to her he is going onto the next best thing.

If he really cares he can do the begging.|`|mhqsiiNXaa	Dear Torn,  I think the best solution is to confront him about the issue.

gC8xO53Oaa	This is sad, but be thankful he's being upfront with you. He realizes you want something he can't possibly give you because of what he's already been through, and he knows he's not being fair to you. I think this happens a lot with single dads and I'm sure single moms too! I know it may be hard, but if marriage and children  is something you want, then nothing can make up for it. You'd resent him if you tried to make the relationship work in hopes you could change his mind and you couldn't. There's someone out there that wants what you do and I know you will have a happier, fuller life if you end up with someone like you. Best to you!|`|Awywcn2Caa	You are probably better off.

I am now remarried after 3 years and it is very possible that my new wife is pregnant. We discussed children before we were even married and decided that we would have at least one together.    If he is dead set in his decision, then you can't change him. Even though it hurts, you must respect his view and find someone else. However, I say give the guy some credit. He could have said yes and changed his mind after you were married.

Is he trying on purpose to lower your self esteem?|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No it is NOT normal nor is it normal or acceptable for him to say that to you ever. That is wrong on many levels not the least of which is a total lack of respect for you or your feelings. That is dreadful.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Did he say that or are you inferring it? If he actually said that he was being a jerk. for myself, and I think I speak for most guys there's not really any perfect look. Basically what I'm saying is most all women look attractive to us, and putting them on a scale is close to impossible. So however you look I'm sure you're plenty hot enough.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	That is awful for him to say that!  My husband says I'm beyond hot and that is why he even approached me to begin with but he's a male and men like to look at other women so that doesn't bother me.  Remind him how "average looking" he is and see how he feels.|`|AA12198711	It is very disrespectful and rude of your husband to even imply that to you and make you feel less of a woman for doing it. <br>  <br>  You need to put him in his place and let him know he is not a gift.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I don't know if it's normal to think it but it certainly isn't normal to actually tell you.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you married a jerk.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	START  TELLING HIM  HOW MUCH  MORE ATTRACTIVE OTHER MEN ARE THAN HIM, TALLER ,BETTER BODY, SMARTER..ETC..THEN DIVORCE HIM|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  If he loves you, truly, he thinks you are the most satisfying beautiful woman he has, or will ever see in his life.  And the "Eye" that I am talking about is in his heart.  My husband doesn't talk about how beautiful other women are in front of me, unless I bring it up.  Then he will comment, and usually will agree, but not without ending it with, but she can't hold a candle to you honey, with a sly smile on his face... hahaha... and then I agree with HIM.  and we laugh about it and go on holding hands.  I hope you will get the same respect.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I agree with Magic 8 Ball. He is probably just trying to lower your self esteem. This is a form of psychological abuse and you should get away from him. Psychological abuse is as wrong and as hurtful was physical abuse.  Tell him if he thinks these women are better looking then he should go marry them. Find yourself a man who is worthy of you. I would bet good money that other men would find you attractive.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	OH what a thoughtful and loving husband you have???? Did you REALLY feel the need to ask this question??? I mean come on really.??? Do YOU think it;s normal???? Of course you don't!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just like most of us don't either. You married a very ignorant and crude man!!!!!!!  I know he'd be out the door looking for that better looking someone!!!!!!!!!<br>  YA OK WEISEMHIMER?????????? or whatever your fuc*ing name is??? What about the fat and balding husbands out there sitting on their fat as*es watching sports all weekend!!!!!! Who wants to look at that???? I know>>> It's only the wives who let themselves go???????? YOUR AN IDIOT!!!!! I see a HUGE L on your forhead!!! In case you don't know what that means you moron>>>It stands for LOSER!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  OK? Now that you cleared that up??? he's still an idiot!!! Even if he didn't think it was true, he couldn't just answer you to make you as little happy????|`|IvMPh09baa	no.  and even if my husband thought another woman was better looking, he would never say that to me.  thats really rude and mean to say.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is a very rude thing to say to you.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	Um, no way|`|GGSSxFsUaa	NOPE|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Absolutely not. My husband thinks that I am the most beautiful woman on the planet and never mentions another woman's appearance. My brother in laws are the same way, several of my married friend's spouses also think their wives are gorgeous. I don't know what's up with your husband, but I've never met a man who thinks that most other women are more beautiful.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	THINKING something and actually SAYING IT OUT LOUD are two very different things. Im no supermodel so I would assume it would cross his mind that this woman is very attractive. But he would NEVER EVER say it. Even thenI doubt the thought of "oh man she is better looking than my wife" would enter his mind. <br>  <br>  Thinking another woman is attractive is a 100% possiblety. But I think its incredible that he would tell you they are better looking than you!! WTF??|`|rE9UfNeEaa	This is only happening because you've let it! Have you let him think all this time that is really true it's not him that needs the help in this case,<br>  he needs an attitude adjustment my dear and you need to teach him god make's beautiful men too! If you know what i mean do it in a nice way.|`|TTjDATeOaa	That's not a very kind thing to say to the person you vowed to protect the rest of your life. It's normal for guys (and girls) to check out the opposite sex, but only a jerk would comment on it out loud.|`|ZEitfScGaa	No, your husband should think that you are the most beautiful person in the world. Its ok for him to find other women attractive, but not like that. I can't believe he even tells you that.|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	Might be normal that sometimes he thinks that but he should not say it to you even if sometimes he THINKS that way.  If it is all the time than he might think you are not very special.  What's up with that?|`|ULUpOqplaa	Your husband is really an a**hole.  Men look at other women because they are different not because they are necessarily better looking.  For your hubby to say that means he is an a**.|`|iAFsKI9zaa	Maybe you should show him this posting and let him see what everyone has said. Maybe you should think about leaving your husband and finding someone more considerate of your feelings|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	*Sigh* No it's not normal. Your husband should not even look at other woman that way. If he cared about your feelings at all he wouldn't say things that like.|`|pJJyH3vhaa	No.<br>  <br>  When I first started dating my fiancee, I thought she was OK in terms of looks.<br>  <br>  Now I thiink she's the most gorgeous girl in the world. I only get turned on by her.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	A lot of single women look better than a wife because wives's let themselves go and single girls are still trying to "hook the big one".  That being said....hes' a jerk for telling you that.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Well, he's a jerk if he conveyed that to you.  Maybe you should tell him that size is important and see how he likes that!|`|AA11108897	Sounds like you're married to a jerk. Tell him to find the movie "Johnny Lingo" on You Tube.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	No it's not normal. You're husband is acting like a jerk sorry.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	No, not at all.|`|AA10204462	only if he has an ugly wife
dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Yup, its based on house hold income.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if the increase is due to your income then no.  If the increase is due to his income then yes.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	if it is his income that has been raised then yes....child support is a certain percentage out of his pay. so when he pay goes up so does the percentage.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	The only "funds" that the ex wife can go after is the father of the kids.<br>  <br>  If you are working and have a greater income than your husband, his ex wife can NOT go after your money.<br>  <br>  Only the father of the kids are solely responsible for the kids if he remarries.|`|AA12198711	She could certainly try. It would take her obtaining a Lawyer and taking it before a Judge to determine whether or not her needs with the children were being met.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	ni it is his responsibility so it is based on only his income|`|IvMPh09baa	Oh god... I hope not.  Thats a good question, but i have no idea.|`|Nhje1U06aa	it depends on your state laws  . <br>  Where i am only 10% of your income would be included. That's if she goes for an increase.<br>  That would only happen if child care or school tuition increased. or if he filed for  a decrease. Honestly if your husband pays his support on time and isn't a jerk about you should be fine.. <br>  My Ex on the other hand is a BIG A HOLE!!!! Doesn't pay and thinks I am stealing his money. I had his wife subpoena to court !|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	No...HIS INCOME ONLY...BEEN THERE.<br>   Got married and her income was a little more than mine. My ex tried and failed. It is based on his income only. And as an aside, if it goes down, he should be able to have it adjusted by the same people who enforce the collection of it.(HHS or DHS)|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	More than likely, yes.  Child support is based on both incomes so if one goes up, the support will be altered as well.  However, your income combined with his is irrelevant.  It is based sole on the father/mother's income.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	In most states, no.  Only the parent's income counts for child support because it is his obligation, not yours.|`|T2j7348Iaa	child support is based on HIS income and not a combined income<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***** MEET ME IN MILDREDS PLAYPEN ****|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	I dont think so but she could try.  Hope she does not need to though.  If the children are fine then i hope she would not try.  That will be greedy.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	No, The child support is based on his salary. You do not have to pay for his children|`|QJrlxqj4aa	Only if its because his income has gone up. Your income isn't counted into the equation.
l0opvMfGaa	No you are absolutely right at his point of stage keep it up

If you find something that works for you all then you can do it again, but something team building yet fun, such as paintballing, is ideal for any work force in any area :)|`|SiniSj1eaa	I live in Seattle so we go on camping adventures a lot and go kayaking too..<br>  <br>  The owner of the company is also a photographer so we end up going to a lot of art galleries too..(a lot of times i feel obligated to do this..haha)<br>  <br>  i recommend drinking with your co-workers...thats when you see the true colors.|`|dprURFLxaa	Bowling would definitely be a good one.  What about goofy-golf?  That could be historic too...<br>  <br>  ** edit **<br>  <br>  We have a few laser tag places here...that's always fun.  We actually had that planned for the staff in our department but something came up and we never got to do it.  ★|`|2DNH6maiaa	I work at a Marina on a Lake.

I prefer it like that!|`|VMY7No0eaa	NONE...<br>  when I am away from work I am through with those people... sure don't want to hang out with them.<br>  I don't like mixing business (work) with pleasure (personal time) <br>  it always bites you in the butt in the long run!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Martin... You asked a question that is not about sex? I'm shocked!<br>  <br>  LOL Just giving you a hard time. I enjoy your questions, even if they're not about sex. :)<br>  <br>  I work in a small office (by "small", I mean my boss and I working out of a home office), so we interact a lot during the workday, being that his computer is just a few feet away from mine. But we don't do much outside work - every once in a while we'll do lunch, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  Some of my husband's office mates are buddies outside work, so they often do stuff together, but my husband is not that social; he prefers to just do things by himself or with me. A couple of times a year his office has a BBQ party where someone brings a grill and they BBQ in the parking lot all evening, drink beer and bring out the projector to run movies (projecting them on the wall of the building). Just recently a few of them did a fun thing - the other owner of the company (my husband is one of the owners) is a licensed pilot, so he borrowed a nice plane from one of his friends, and flew several people from the office to Catalina Island (we're in San Diego) for lunch. They had a lot of fun. I didn't go - for one, it was during the workday, and two, I don't like flying! lol|`|fGE7hL12aa	JayJay is right, bowling was a riot. <br>  <br>  We also picked up a cheap grill for the occasional Friday picnic at work. We have about 30 employees, so a few dozen hot dogs and hamburgers was perfect.<br>  <br>  I think Paintball would be pretty cool too.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Bowling would be funny as hell!<br>  <br>  When my husband bowls he looks like he is flipping people off.. I pee my pants watching him bowl... It would make for great entertainment to share with my alcoholic work buddies!!<br>  <br>  Don't forget the bowling team Shirts!<br>  <br>  I want to be on the "We-Suck" team! WHOOO!!|`|RwYIhCg8aa	None of the above! <br>  <br>  The only interaction I want with my co-workers outside the office is waving good bye to them while I'm leaving.... sometimes I use more than just one finger when I do it!
FKR45WLPaa	Go for the one that you want first.  If you don't, you will regret it.  If that doesn't work out, take another look at the ones that like you.  Maybe you will like them more than you think.|`|yb01tlviaa	wow, you are SO super cool...

9D92cgAXaa	i think you where cutting because of what your father did luckily your friend was there for you. i think that something made you snap and go back to the past.|`|3e6a31861945d1557219a2cf18acd5efaa	That is SELF-MUTILATION and is extremely dangerous and can be caused by depression as you`ve mentionned. <br>  <br>  However, it is also caused by stress in normal people also. If you are at high-school, then it could be possibly that you are stressed with the pressure from teachers/exams and so on, which give you a stressful feeling you can no longer take.<br>  <br>  Another reason you should consider is that it could be that you like the pain the cuttings have inflicted on you in the past, and realise only afterwards when they leave marks on the skin. It`s more like an addiction to this pain. In that circumstance, it is not caused by depression as you make yourself believe.<br>  <br>  It depends what kind of person you are. If you are strong-minded and have a powerful will-power, you should have already forgotten the bad past your dad`s presence had on your family, and it would NOT affect you.<br>  <br>  Coming back to depression, which you said is COMMON in your family, then it MAY possibly be the effect of your genes on your personality, which makes you have depression at some point of life, but at only 16, you must be enjoying life and it`s NOT normal to be suffering from depression at this age anyway! <br>  <br>  I conclude by saying that it is hard for me and ANYBODY ELSE overhere to determine what is the REAL problem because we lack so much information to analyze your situation.<br>  <br>  Consult a doctor who can then refer you to an appropriate counsellor and have yourself treated. It is a psychological behaviour pattern going in the wrong way so it needs treatment.<br>  <br>  One day, when you are so stressed up, you might as well take the knife and make a deep-cut on your veins in your left hand....but it will be too late before you realise it. <br>  <br>  SO CONSULT A COUNSELLOR.|`|VFgb3sy1aa	Oh my gosh honey.  If there's a support group you can call and talk to them, please do so.  This is a sign of depression and possibly more serious effects.  No child should feel this way.  If you're close to this friend you call every time you feel like cutting, maybe you could talk to her mom and she could help you find some kind of help.  But, please stop doing this.|`|91580eed17d6767f4f7dbd022b2c2213aa	It can be caused by depression. And also past memories that come back, which in turn can casue depression, can lead to cutting.<br>  <br>  Its a very dangerous thingto start I was a cutter fo alittle over 10 years. I would see a counsler.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon and stay strong

UpRdvpmXaa	Hey, I'm a Christian guy and am engaged to my fiance (we both happen to be virgins and are 25). I would marry her if she was a virgin or she had been with one other guy, if she had an extensive history of sleeping with others then she wouldn't be the same girl that I know and love. But with being a Christian the one thing that is in your heart is forgiveness, we all make mistakes. I can tell you that I've made my own and would not judge someone for making theirs. <br>  If you find someone that you fall in love with and find that like yourself, they've been with someone, would it really be enough of a reason to cut it off. What if God did that to us? What if he only gave us that one chance to forgive us? He forgives us...and calls us back to him once we ask for forgiveness from our mistakes. <br>  If a guy does judge you for being with one partner, then he is not worth your love and do not let him make you feel like you're below him because no one is perfect. If he is a Christian, he'll forgive you and take your renewed vow to heart because you have the true meaning of what the act of sex is really about and when you decide to sleep with him on your wedding night, you're doing so because you love him. We all falter...and that one time you slept with that man...shouldn't shake him. <br>  I would marry my fiance if she had been with one other man that one time...because I love her for a whole lot more then virginity (which I'm glad she is because its shows she stuck to a vow she made), she is a faithful woman, kind, generous, smart, sweet, smart, the list goes on. I'm not marrying her virginity...I'm marrying Faith. <br>  Find someone who will marry you for you...a woman with a devotion, realization that she did something wrong but is forgiven by the one who matters, and someone who has waited for that special someone. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless :)
qFvHH6lUaa	First off, you should let an adult know that her bf hits her.  Do it anonymously if you're worried about making the girl mad, but do something about that.  Secondly, be her friend but don't pressure her for anything else.  You're going to become her constant rebound guy and that's not fair to you.  Go on with your life, date other girls or whatever, but don't wait around for her.  That whole best friend to boyfriend transition is difficult in the best of circumstances and if she's only 15, she's too young to understand that.  Maybe when you're both older and she's more stable you could revisit the relationship thing.  And don't let it mess with your self-esteem.  There's someone out there for everyone and you're still young too.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I think you should leave her alone and move on.. she is to young and doesn't know what she wants. Maybe after she sees you are hooking up with other girls she might get jealous and want you.|`|NGKwsawdaa	It has nothing to do with your looks. Girls just tend to go for the "bad boy" at that age. It's the cool thing to do. I suggest that you leave her alone and let her think things thru. And maybe she'll change her mind and if you are still interested then you guys might have a relationship. Your only 17, move on and enjoy your youth, don't stress too much now, you can do that later in life.|`|AA10204462	you would have waited until marrage and she lost her virginity at 15. maybe you should look else where|`|9QyrW2iCaa	You're not in BIG trouble!  Stop being a drama king!<br>  <br>  This girl that you have a crush on surely is in a bad situation, no doubt.  However, you are not here to be a prince and "rescue" her.  Seriously.<br>  <br>  This girl has many issues of her own to work out and work through, that may take years, if not a lifetime.  She has some self esteem issues (that she may not even be able to put into words herself).  <br>  <br>  I would stay friendly with her when you see her but not go out of your way to call her.  It sounds like the boyfriend may not hesitate to turn on you as well.  If you do want to keep in touch I would recommend a note that encourages her to leave a situation where someone is physically and/or mentally abusive.  I would leave all hints of romance and dating out.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, stop dwelling on your looks.  You look fine enough.  Invest in yourself with your studies, sports activities (running, basketball, judo, etc) and focus on HEALTHY and HAPPY friends (those who don't seem to have so much DRAMA and "bad luck" and bad situations in their lives).<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.  Take care of yourself and the rest will follow!  = )  Huge hugs to you!
S3oiz7vXaa	Honestly, you're correct in putting YOUR parents on the invitations, and you are so NOT obligated to pay for HIS dads tux and his moms dress. <br>  <br>  Go to the knot.com...it pretty much explains EVERYTHING...then show his mom the website. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, its YOUR wedding, not hers. She can just deal with it!|`|884v4VhGaa	Yes, it's the names of the people who are hosting. Not that this is not the same as the people who are paying. Unless his parents don't want to host, I'd recommend against saying that they aren't. It's petty to say "well if you aren't going to pay you can't host", and you would be doing effectively that.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	All the invitations I've seen have had both sets of parents names on it.  I've never seen one without both names.  Just because your parents are hosting doesn't really mean anything.  Both couples would like people to come see you get married, not just your parents, so I would include them on the invite.  But, I don't see the need to pay for your future in laws outfits.  That should be money from their pocket, not yours.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	I just think that the wedding is one day and joining the two families is for life, why burn bridges over names on an invitation.  If your fiance wants to include his parents regardless of contribution than why not compromise.  You can say, "Together with our parents" or something along those lines.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	You could compromise by wording the invitation this way:<br>  Mr. and Mrs Bridesparents<br>  request the honour of your presence<br>  at the marriage of their daughter<br>  Bride <br>  to<br>  Groom, son of Mr. and Mrs, Groomsparents<br>  <br>  That way it's clear your parents are in the host role, but his parents are recognized.  It also helps to list both sets of parents so that people who are invited by virtue of their relationship to the groom's parents know who is getting married and why they were invited.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	In all honesty, I would throw that belief out the window.  In order to keep the peace, I would include both sets of parents' names on the invite.  Truly, this is a good way to acknowledge both sets of parents.<br>  <br>  For my wedding, we paid for it all without any help and still put both sets of parents' names on the invitation as a way to honor them.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well if your family is chipping in and his isn't, then yours is the one hosting.  bride's side usually are the hosts and the ones who cover everything anyway.  if he wants his parents mentioned, you can put 'together with our parents request the honour...' but by no means should you pay for his parents clothes.  or your wedding party, no no no.  if they can't afford a dress or tux, they can't be in the wedding, it's that simple!|`|FXCoGD44aa	You did the invitations perfectly correct. You are right - you're parents are hosting, so they should be mentioned. His parents are not.<br>  <br>  But if it turns into a nasty ordeal, it might be worth putting their names on the invitation just to keep the peace - if anything between the two of you. <br>  <br>  It's amazing how finicky people are about little crap like this, isn't it?!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I think to keep the peace you should mention the grooms parents, but not in a way that makes it sound like they are hosting it along with your parents.<br>  <br>  Mr & Mrs Smith request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their daughter<br>  Jane Smith<br>  to John Doe<br>  Son of Mr & Mrs George Doe .... and so on<br>  <br>  That way the parents are mentioned but it is also clear that they are not co-hosting with your folks.|`|87pV5lvZaa	My husband and I grappled with the wording of the invitations before our wedding, also.  We felt it was important to honor both families even though my parents paid for the wedding entirely.  Here is what we came up with: (I have changed the names for the sake of privacy).<br>  <br>  Andrew and Lisa Smith request the honor of your presence at the wedding of their daughter, Elizabeth Ann Smith, to Devon Michael Jones, son of Jacob and Karen Jones, on Saturday, the 20th of March 2001.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I am with the first poster.  Just go ahead and put both parents on there.  It really isn't a big deal.  My husband and I paid for our entire wedding ourselves but the invitations read "Mr and Mrs. J Smith and Mr and Mrs K Anderson request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their children, Jane Smith and John Anderson"  <br>  <br>  I think it is more of a way to honor both parents than to say "Oh look who is paying for the wedding"|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Your parents names could be mentioned first as they are hosting, but its the joining of 2 families. Not just your family and your day. Its your fiances day as well and if he wants their names on the invitation than what is the issue with that? Doesn't seem like such a big deal to me. Personally I'd be wondering why his parents weren't mentioned on the invite if I got one like that.|`|29I8PWrxaa	It's true that traditionally the invitation has whoever is hosting or paying for the wedding on it.  But it might be a nice gesture to include both sets of parents.  But I don't think you need to pay for the tux and dress - that is their responsibility.|`|AA11380378	You can write:<br>  <br>  Mrs and Mrs parents of the bride<br>  request the honor of your presence to the marriage of their daughter<br>  Brides name<br>  to <br>  Grooms name<br>  son of<br>  Grooms parents name<br>  and the rest<br>  <br>  Problem solved<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|q8eue7CRaa	We put both sets of parents on the invitation even though one set did not pay for any of the wedding. I thought it was the proper thing to do and shows the two families are coming together.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	We paid for our wedding entirely and put both sets of parents on the invite.  It didn't hurt us to do so, and it made them both feel special.

If she doesn't have one then she is telling you she does so that you don't make a move!|`|a7mmLbiRaa	Easiest way to dodge the whole issue is to just ask her out.  Meeting girls in school and such is the easiest way to find a date, because you know you'll get one more chance to talk to her.<br>  <br>  Just strike up a conversation about nothing.  Talk about something she might be interested in.  Start off by making a joke or comment about something around you, or the class.  Then move (quickly, but not akwardly) on to something else, anything really.  <br>  <br>  Then, when she's not nervous (or more likely, when YOU'RE not) about talking to each other, you just ask, casually, if she'd like to hang out sometime.  If the answer is yes, she might just be interested, and then try to get her number.  If she doesn't really make any effort, then I would leave it at that.|`|RLoilwCNaa	OK nooblet, if she is telling you she has a boyfriend she either has one or is just saying that because she doesn't like you. Either way, you lose. Look elsewhere.|`|rnHEdRovaa	just ask her

But I just put on a brave face, take a deep breath & forge ahead. Try to practice/force yourself to talk a little more everyday and interact a little more with different ppl everyday. Start small. One person everyday & move up gradually.<br>  Smile more :). People love to have pleasant ppl around them.<br>  I hope I've helped even a little.

Wv592rOqaa	Hey! You make getting a girlfriend sound like something from a mail order catalogue?  <br>  <br>  You have rules and you are unpredictable but you want a guuud girlfriend?  Perhaps you could start with changing your attitude as females are not like fruit - something that you pick from a tree looking for a ripe one.  <br>  <br>  You can start with making friends with girls and treating them with respect by not thinking of them as having to be "good."  You can make friends by doing volunteer work, attending charity events or in school or at any social gathering, you probably will meet at least a few girls that you have something in common with - from this friendship you can establish a relationship as long as it is mutual.|`|ogtHK7Eiaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD BE A LIL MORE SPECIFIC <br>  A GOOD GURL COULD BE FOUND ALMOST ANYWHERE <br>  WHAT DO U CONSIDER GOOD NO ONES PERFECT U KNOW....BUT I MEANS LETS SEE U CAN GO TO THE LIBRARY, CHURCH, MALLS , I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON U NEVER KNOW THE RIGHT GURL CAN BE RIGHT NEXT TO U...JUST DONT GO OUT AND GET NO HOOKER|`|XQWInrsBaa	U can't make other girls to think like u.

2YKUepLjaa	okay so:<br>  a. you are jealous, please stop lying to yourself.<br>  b. you don't control him, he's the guy you're "talking to" so you clearly aren't totally together and maybe he's in the process of deciding what he wants right now. <br>  c. you shouldn't have made him leave a party of hers in the first place, she is still his friend and as you said she is friends with all his friends it would be rude of her not to invite them ALL to her party.<br>  d. he clearly still has feelings for his ex and you are his rebound, so stay away and if he really does like you he'll come back to you, if you keep texting him and making him leave places he wants to be and not hangout with the people he wants to then he won't want to be with you anyways.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Just tell him that you don't wanna play games. He either wants to be with you or he doesn't. He needs to make a decision and stop being immature. If he wants to be with you, then he needs to stay away from his ex.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Your being too harsh,|`|7nGwou8uaa	he obviously does. why the crap are you threatening to kick her ***? thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard...that might be a reason for him to pick her. i know id pick her...|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	Sounds like he needs his a$$ kicked, not hers.|`|iJwDBFYgaa	yes i do thats really wrong .  i would really be upset and besides the fact that he didnt tell you!!!omg|`|ojiO3svoaa	i think you need to decide what you want to deal with. that was her ex before it was your guy so they got history. if he does not want to move on and respect your feelings then you cant change him and it becomes a you issue. if you want to put up with that then that is your deal. and no, he is probably not over her if you met each other the night they broke up.<br>  <br>  also..... quit threatening her. it makes you look immature. you and him do not have enough history to have that clout.|`|a984cQjKaa	i think you need to grow the **** up.  if he ends up going back to her, it's going to be your own fault.  and you are so obviously jealous it's kinda pathetic.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If you guys are exclusive then he shouldn't be going to parties without you. If you guys aren't you don't own him and he can do what he wants.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	from what you have told me he still loves his ex- tell him to go live with her, kick him out , there are others in the sea.|`|uDkXHaa6aa	Yeah he should decide -- so tell him he needs to, and if he won't then you decide for him by saying Bye Bye!!|`|EEapXFJ2aa	He likes her more than he likes u.Probably. Coz u met him the nyt he broke up with his ex so definitely n ver obviously it was at a tym wen he really was in emotional need.. he needed emotional support n he had not completely moved on frm his previous relationship.. n dats wen he found u n he probably got all that frm u.. the emotional support that he needed at that tym.. <br>  n now he still meets her, goes to her partiesn stuff like that even without telling u n not caring about what u say n not caring about ur felings<br>  Its probably not his fault either.. it happens .. But frm what ure telling... I can extract that he still like s her n wants to get back with her even at the cost of making u angry n sad<br>  Hes being unfaithful to u because of his ex<br>  Now Its up2 u 2 decide<br>  Either u make ur bonding strong with him n make him committed to u so that he dsnt leave u or the second option is that u leave him. Coz if u dont get him Commited n if ur unable 2 make him serious for u n get his ex out of his head than hes probably gonna dump u (mytbe for her or maybe not) sooner or later|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Do you even understand how incredibly immature you sound?<br>  Guys can see that, and its really unattractive.<br>  You MADE him leave? So you are already controlling him?<br>  And you are just talking to him? So hes not even your bf yet? AKA he can do whatever he wants.<br>  You may not think you are jealous, but honey, you are. You def are! Maybe not so much of her, but you are jealous of his and her relationship.<br>  And kicking her @ss will prove what now? That you are indeed immature..<br>  What did she do to you that makes you hate her so much, besides the fact that she dated a guy you like?! Thats it! other than that... nothing.<br>  Get over it.<br>  Sorry to be so harsh, but dang!|`|ohIo9MFxaa	Did  they have a long lasting meaningful relationship? He may have just found you and you are serving as a rebound partner and nothing more.  Do you think he hasn't had enough time to be single and may not be ready to move on with anyone yet. You know him more than us right? Is this break up recent? Are you already a confirmed steady couple or still just casual friends?  Does he know you want him for yourself? If you do, let him know. Maybe he's not aware? Men aren't as complex and don't think about details and scenarios and consequences like us. If you like him and want exclusion and to focus on your new found relationship have a serious eye to eye conversation with him. Exude confidence and captivate him and take his mind off her (if you think these "people" that say he still loves her are right) and fill all his spare time with you for a while and get your relationship off to a solid start. Does she still like him? I wouldn't want to deal with competition and the friction if he is still going to have alot of contact with her. Is he worth the effort? If yes be secure and win him over for yourself.|`|rKaUdhLUaa	What are you like 14? "I'm gonna kick your *** if you invite this guy or his friends to hang out" SOOOOOOO immature!!!! #1 you said your "talking" to him. Not in a relationship with him. Even if you were, you have no right "making" him do anything. If he wanted to be with you he would be with you and not at her party. Get a hint, he's probably just trying to get laid if he hasn't already. Or just using you to make her jealous.|`|At7ynJ2Xaa	To be honest if he is going over there and not telling you then he obviously thinks he is doing something wrong. I am not saying he still likes her but disregarding he is a liar. personally I don't think he is worth it. Find some one who likes you and doesn't hang out with there ex with out telling you.|`|j0W2YSYFaa	hi you i know this felling is normal to fell it . the same thing happened to me and be sure that if he was really in love with you  he won't go to this party so ask him to stop going to her party so if he doesn't stop going to her party this mean that he doesn't love you .|`|A4SU14Wwaa	You can't always make him choose. Some ppl are still friends with there exes I mean. But, if you really don't want him hanging around with his ex anymore talk to him about it. Or just let hiim go and find someone else that is much better then him but if your not dating him actually datin him. You have no say in him|`|ejOvriRuaa	he needs to sort himself out because if you do not like it then you have to tell him that and you need yo tell his ex to make up her mind who she wants more you or him because she can not have both|`|i96olJoMaa	Don't let him worry you. You have a clue of whats going on. Don't let him hurt you. Try to get new guy friend to hang with. Or just try to focus more on yourself.|`|J5HEveZAaa	mira chicka it dosent mean anything if they hangout they can be friends but he still like her and she dosent so there not gonna get back together so stop trying to be with him and find a real ***** that isnt in love.|`|sJ92L6cjaa	Sounds like you are his rebound girlfriend and he still likes her.|`|MTvjvVY0aa	It sounds like jealousy to me.|`|sC2WFC81aa	Go fall in love with your pet rock.|`|YZddsudlaa	hmmm i suggest kick his too the girls not have xxx by herself or maybe she is|`|0LEFco9xaa	I really don't think its a case of who he wants. Obviously if he went out with her a second time it didn't work out. If they have mutual friends obviously he is going to see her out and stuff. If its really bothering you that bad you need to talk to him about it. What it sounds like to me is that you don't trust him and that you think he will cheat on you. He has given no behavior that indicates he will do that. The reason he didn't tell you is because he knew you would be pissed and he didn't feel like dealing with a fight because of it. Guys don't put as much thought into things as we do. Its not like he was going there to cheat on you. If you do talk to him about it you should not do it in an accusatory way otherwise it will end up in a fight. Telling her your going to kick her a** is not the best way at dealing either you want his friends to like you and that is not the way to do it. The best thing you can do is relax and trust him a little more and try to make an effort to be friendly with her and his friends so that way when this stuff comes up you will get asked to go too. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|AA10928214	Well yeah, he should decide what he wants, and maybe if he knows it bothers you so much to hang out with her, if he really didn't like her then he wouldn't do it. But, if he isn't doing anything wrong when he's there then he should be able to go and you just have to trust him.<br>  <br>  Also, to the other poster Candyapple, You never OWN someone even if you are going out with them, married to them, glued to them...|`|LMnofMgXaa	Well, try considering his feeling first. He may want to move on but it's hard if he still loves his ex. We all know that the hardest part is letting go. So maybe he's trying to let go and find something to hold on to. But, if the both of you are already in a relationship and he still feels for his ex then that's when he should decide who he wants. Because emotions are not to be toyed with. If he's still sprung over her he should let you know and let you be. But if he wants to further the relationship between the both of you then he should know that the past is over. Let Bygones be Bygones.|`|fe4a7c5e36d28eb34ebcf6d49980a6faaa	I think your both young and I think she now invites him places because she knows it bothers you. If they have mutual friends then they will end up hanging out together and this and that and you have no right to tell him who he can and can not hang out with. All you can do is tell him it bothers you and that he needs to respect that. But if he doesn't and he keeps doing things behind your back then dump him. Being controlling isn't going to work. He will not pick you above all his other friends just b/c they are friends with his ex.
1JVAZbt7aa	Hi lexy.<br>  <br>  thats gross.<br>  <br>  umm i would freak out.|`|hplJxGa2aa	The closer the related the weirder (and grosser) it would get. If it was like a 3rd cousin and so on, it wouldn't be too bad. If it was a second cousin, a little weird. If it was a cousin, freaky. If it was an aunt or uncle. Really freaky. If it was a brother or a sister, DISGUSTING!!!!<br>  <br>  And I guess if it was a grandma or grandpa (which probably wouldn't happen), then that would be pretty f**ked up.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	It depends how you are related. If it is like, your long lost dad, then tell them. But if it distantly related, don't bother, you are basically strangers.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	It depends on how related. <br>  <br>  I'm not into keeping secrets from people, but this one might be best kept secret. Depends on the child.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	how do you mean related, counsins (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc), father/daughter, uncle/neice etc. All depends on how they are related and to whether it would benefit the child to know his parent's medical history|`|PBDXgNBgaa	i'd be like f..k iono even knw what i would do about that. thats crazy

43f2065c02647908da40c12f178ef19caa	I know what you're going through and to be honest it's not GROSS to me at all. People are just scared of things thats are out of the norm for them, but I think your family might have an issue with it...maybe. I wouldn't care about what complete strangers on here say really but your family opinion does count. If you guys just want to fool around then fine don't get caught. I messed around with my foster cousin but stopped because I thought of my family and he was mad at me for a while not mad but hurt and now when he sees me he flirts alot and wants me but I put my guard up and walk away.(No, we didn't have sexual intercourse)<br>  <br>  So... do whats best for you, and no if your not blood related then in all of reality it is not gross or disturbing but in people who don't understand or actually know whats it's like then it might be,|`|1mxTviGLaa	I would stop. if anyone found out, especially your family, it would probably be bad.<br>  and he sounds kinda like a perv.<br>  i'd either stay away from him (i know that's easier said than done)<br>  or see him but keep things more family like:]<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|3Pe8XYbUaa	You obviously think of him as a cousin blood related or not so i would say that yes it is wrong. Not to mention gross because blood related or not your still RELATED.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	Officially if you're not blood related then it's not technically wrong, but it sounds so gross when you call him your cousin. So don't tell people.|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	He sounds pervy, stay away from him.lol.|`|kWxSHsBJaa	wow.<br>  that sounds kinda wierd..<br>  i wouldnt do that.|`|LTDpbTGXaa	well , dont call him your cousin (because hes not) and i guess its alright.|`|LykjWv6faa	What is this? Alabama?|`|0yaQQSwoaa	What is this your Aunts Husbands son from another marriage??

It is unlikely that any one would rent to you either as your so young?<br>  Have you thought about all the expense of moving out? Do you have a job? Will you be happy on your own? It's hard?

And my advice to you is to ignore this boy, or I might pop a cap up in him. lol  At this age, boys aren't mature enough, and may need some time to get up the nerve to acknowledge his feelings towards you.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	you can love a million different types of people. You can love a lot of things about them. But to be in love with someone means that there is something about that one person that is different from everyone else, they have something about them that you know you will never find in another person. Something irreplaceable. That's being in love.|`|pOTigVYPaa	When you can see all their faults and imperfections and still choose to stay with them, it's love.

WYnaBeIfaa	THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR . . . BUT IT WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION PERFECTLY.<br>  <br>  Because -->> A MAN would rather spend his precious time with a worthwhile girlfriend - or lover - than a woman who is NIETHER.<br>  <br>  Women LOVE to "pretend" they are "friends" with men . . . and they will ALWAYS "SAY" there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it. <br>  <br>  But the "FRIEND ZONE" is actually the place where women try to DISCARD the men they are no longer ATTRACTED to. . . . so that they can have as large a pool of available men to choose from AFTER they are done sleeping with "JERKS".<br>  <br>  LOL!!!<br>  <br>  MEN KNOW -->> Women are LYING when they say they want to be "friends". How does he KNOW she is lying???<br>  <br>  BECAUSE IF HE IS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU AND HE PHONES HOME TO TELL YOU HE WILL BE GOING OUT FOR DINNER TONIGHT WITH ONE OF HIS "FEMALE FRIENDS" TONIGHT INSTEAD OF YOU. . . . YOU WILL THROW A SCREAMING FIT!<br>  <br>  Thats how. <br>  <br>  Fascinating , don't you think?<br>  <br>  A women will "SAY" she really loves to have male friends . . . until HER MAN actually has a female friend. <br>  <br>  Don't BLAME a man for not wanting to be OK with being tossed into the "friend" zone - 'cause that's about as much fun for him as ROOT CANAL.<br>  <br>  No man is interested in going to the mall with you . . . watching you pick out shoes, while listening to you go on and on about 'your boyfriend'.<br>  <br>  That's what your girlfriends are for.<br>  <br>  MEN HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO.<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA12376061	Well, He probably decided that he was there to get an education, and not meet his wife, yet, so he probably over-reacted to the situation, as people do, and feels that he is interested in you, and you might give him diversion from his goals, if he talks to you or gets more involved with you. If seeing him as freind is acceptable for you, try to tell him you just would like to continue your freindship, but not be a couple. Maybe he is afraid he cant be just freinds with you, so he has to put his blinders on. Without you two talking, you may never know why he is acting strangley.|`|e089be72478dfbfa165373c73a5847c9aa	he probably lost interest in you

NqYfsGHIaa	my heart really goes out to you...if you're having these problems, your best bet is to speak with one of your counselor's at school.  They would be able to give you some advice and/or information on what you can do.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best|`|rMmTv5lOaa	I am so sorry! Some people are just born into families where there is no strong support system. I suggest a therapist.

Also...maybe consider moving out and into another relative or trusted person's home|`|WvBDAoHIaa	you have to be strong, those are words, dont let ppl get you down, i know their your family and you love them, no ones family is perfect all families have problems, it is your life and you have to be strong and not let ppl affect you, no one else can walk in your shoes, there will be better days|`|cy39KTKTaa	Do not say that you have no one in this world. You have yourself and that is more important than all those other people. If you feel like your friend is acting different you have to talk to her about it. Use statments about how you feel.. Like "I am hurt" or " I feel like you treat me differently." Your brother will continue to annoy the crap out of you for several more years if he is a teenager one of my friends under took to say I love you every time her brother did some thing mean so everytime he hits you tell him he is your brother and you love him and that you realize the reason he hits you is because he cant express how much he loves you as a sister..... it works as wierd as it sounds. Your mother calls you names? like what? it is very sad to think that someones mother would try to sabotage them that way...try finding a female mentor who can give you a positive female figure in your life, who is supportive. Tell your father you want him to spend time with you sober playing cards or going to the park or something... if he can or if you feel you can tell him this. If your friends wont listen to you or are unsupportive go and look for people who will be true empathetic compassionate friends to you, and then kick your other friends to the curb. You cannot single handedly hold your family together. You have to take care of your self first and foremost if you ever hope to take care of anyone else. Be strong, Be compassionate of others failings, and try to survive until you can move out. there is a whole new kick *** world out there when you do. Good luck Grrrl.

bILC85pPaa	If you are only going to 'chase'  her based on how she'll be in bed, then don't bother. If all it's going to be is sex, then it shouldn't be that complicated.<br>  <br>  Also - there are a lot of people who are different in bed than you would expect.

They seem to be less inhibited.  In my case, they seem to think a little more like me, which leads to them wanting to try the same things that I want to try, rather than resisting my advances, like lots of girly girls often do.<br>  <br>  I'd say your 'tomboy' would be worth a try for you, if you've never dated one.|`|1P578Xwraa	they are more adventourous than others cause they are not so shy and they like to take chances and do crazy things cause they know that they can do anything that a boy can.  so she is not so repressed as those girlie girls.|`|MEOqfiZyaa	If you're just going after her to "get her in bed", don't waste your time and don't waste hers. Come back and ask the question again when you're ready to stop being a juvenile male and looking at women as sex objects instead of being a man and seeing women as the beautiful creation that God has made them. This "tomboy" that you're hoping is good in the sack is probably has an incredibly rich personality and you could probably learn alot from her. But unfortunately you will probably never realize that to any extent because you're too busy trying to get a piece. Leave her alone. Don't bother chasing her. She deserves better than you.|`|ZqtQIYXCaa	Find out for yourself.|`|ycXiCv4saa	We are all amazing in bed!!!<br>  <br>  xxx

IQEf57ANaa	the way she looks at you can tell yout a lot. if she looks at you and then she smiles then you are in a very good position.<br>  <br>  if she tries to sit colose to you. it means she maybe is trying toget close to you to see if you have the guts to talk to her. <br>  <br>  if she talks to you about any stupid thing like " did you hear what the teacher said ?" or " i dont understand this, do you undestand it ?". all this means she just want to open a conversation with you. <br>  <br>  any other kind of signal can tell you if she likes you or not. now be carefull, sometimes girls are jsut friendly and that doesnt mean she likes you.
RjUWPz5daa	This article isn't about raising money but it can tell you how to save money, which in the end is all the same.|`|QilfSBfsaa	You have to plan when to go to Disney and how much will be spent on the vacation.  After you know the amount you have to plan how much you and your brother need to save per week; if you find that amount is too big for both of you to take out, you have to change the itinerary, maybe go to somewhere closer and less expensive, I am sure you and your family will still get the same happiness as the most important thing is to get together.|`|Q5gfCe1Qaa	The best way to save money is to put it under your mattress. As long as you can keep it in your possession, you know that your money is safe. <br>  <br>  The only way to make money these days is by working. Taking on a side job can help bring in a few extra bucks, but I know that will take time away from you being with your family, but I think that is the best route to go.<br>  <br>  I hope your disney trip comes through.|`|h0U42w2xaa	The best way to get money is to work for it.

W4BsmESnaa	She wanted to be gone from your life, let her stay that way! Who needs that kind of drama? I mean, how are you guys 13? (hope not since you're married lol)|`|AA11733625	I would respond... and I would probably say that the drama was too much. It is always good to have friends, but I would take it back quite a few notches and not get as invested in it as you were until you feel it out and see how it goes.|`|Jhr68T0baa	That sounds very childish and immature what she did, but if you value her friendship and miss her enough then why not? forgive and forget. life is too short.|`|ZZkInusMaa	i think you should just wait she made the mess let her clean it up !!|`|tXSPCtHCaa	I think you should respond, but always keep what happened in mind.  Did you tell her before you had the party? Or did you let her find out? I can understand her anger if you let her find out.  So not only was she not invited, but her "best friend" didn't even tell her she wasn't invited. Thats a no no on your part. If you didn't want her to come, you should have explained to her that you didn't want her to feel like a 5th wheel. Or you could have said it was a last minute get together. the truth is always best.|`|AA12184663	see. what she want first she might have a hidden agenda.|`|A4SU14Wwaa	Think before you do that. Do you want her to get angry again that you didn't invite her for a dinner party? But if you want to be her friend then do it I mean
nwuL7M7saa	Maybe its possible to mend the relationship between your mom and your boyfriend. If you feel like hes worth it, try to get them to sit down and have a decent conversation & work things out.<br>  <br>  On the other hand....<br>  <br>  I would hear your parents out... I've always told myself I wouldn't date someone my parents didn't like. They probably have good reasoning behind not liking him. On the bright side, there will be sunshine after the rain meaning, if you break up with him, you could always find a more respectable, decent man whom your parents do like. It would save drama & stress. Hope it helps!!|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	You sound like you still haven't learned from your mistake. This right here is the reason why you don't go outside of your relationship for advice or a vent about your man. If you have a problem with your man, you should be talking to him about it. Whether you talk to someone else or not, it's not going to help your relationship as you and the person involved still have not talked it out. First, you need to realize that while it helps to have your family like your boyfriend, it isn't necessary and since it's because of you that they don't like him I would say don't worry about it. Your family should still love you no matter what, so don't call your sister or mom anymore with information about your bf. Call them to talk about them and your schooling, etc. Do not bring him up in conversation. Eventually they will ask about him and when you talk about him from now on, it should be nothing but good things. Tell them about how he took you out for dinner on saturday night (example) or about a sweet thing he did for you. BUT, whatever you do, don't offer this information - let them ask you for it.|`|uuMCGT9taa	let him go his way for that year and learn from this tell ur gf things not ur family . family only makes things worse and they get in the mix and its hard to think down the road about holidays and bday partys and stuff how will every one get along.   and he is doing some thing with his life tell ur sisters he is going to the military and thats cool. <br>  <br>  just do you for now ur still young to live and love life
GGSSxFsUaa	I'm sure you had to have asked him 1st & if you can't believe him then why marry him?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	The best way is to give your ring back to him.  Why in the world would you marry a man that you suspect has an ex-wife and kids?  You need some serious mental help.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Hire a private detective to dig up his past. I am wondering why you are engaged to a man whom you suspect of having an ex-wife or children. Shouldn't he tell you these things instead of trying to hide them? Do you have trouble believing what he says? Is your intuition telling you something?|`|uetenAeRaa	if you are engaged to him and you don't know if he was ever married or have kids then you must be very young.  why don't you just ask him.<br>  <br>  why would you want to marry someone and yet still have these doubts that you can't ask him or him giving to you freely?|`|fHfVRcqbaa	If you don't trust him to tell you the truth, then he probably shouldn't be your fiance.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	Ask him?  That would work for me!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You got engaged to someone you don't know? You don't know if he's ever been married or had children you don't know him. End the engagement and start dating again. These things are usually discussed in the early stages of a relationship not after you decide to get married.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	hire a private detective. They can tell you anything about his bank accounts, his past, marriages and where he takes his dirty shirts.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	maybe ask him? If you think he would hide such a thing from you......hmmm maybe not the best idea to marry him.|`|by9KuBizaa	Have you tried asking him?<br>  <br>  If you don't trust his answer....it's not a good idea for this man to be your fiance|`|Nhje1U06aa	Well what is putting that question in your head???

8McA6xqPaa	If you WANT this, then you and you alone can change this.<br>  <br>  Take a moment to think and decide what you truly want. If you want to be a 'good wife' as you put it and if you love your husband, then you need to stop lying and cheating and either tell him so you can start again or just move on from this a turn over a new leaf.<br>  If you truly want to change, then make yourself change. Think about what will happen if you don't and commit yourself to the new way - by recognising and diminishing the old behaviour. By acting this way it kinda appears you aren't happy living the life of a married woman to this man and if this is true then you need to confront this and decide yourself which way is best to go about it.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and perseverance<br>  CAli|`|94gC814Eaa	While working on my huge mess of a relationship....I realized that I was rebelling because i did not get the kind of attention i wanted and that translated to me being colder to him and warmer to other certain males. I nearly ruined a good thing. I have realized my mistake and stopped being so bitchy when there was no need to be so in turn he was more loving and less cold towards me. My advice take it one day at a time remind yourself every day you love him and are willing to  be a better you for him.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	There's something about change... If you want to stop, you stop. It sounds like you feel you've got some reason to continue on the path you're on. The fact that he's forgiven all of your indiscretions leads me to believe that while you may want to change, you don't feel like you have to because he will forgive you again. Just keep in mind that people will only forgive for some time. Eventually your rope will run out and you'll be stuck with no man and the past you've put yourself through, creating a horrible future for yourself.|`|SovaFpN8aa	You are in control of your own actions. If you want to be a better person, then you must be a better person. There is no magic answer. Live your life one day at a time. Every day commit yourself to doing the right thing. It's all up to you.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Seek counseling and find the root cause of your behavior before you lose him.|`|PMtqTW6qaa	i wish i could be like him and just over look things like that.|`|XupgzULeaa	Love yourself and stop this reckless attitude and behavior before you ruin your relationship and more importantly ruin your life. Also, exercise some self discipline and control. you must become a better you first before you can become a better spouse. Ask God to help you become a better person.|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	Boo Hoo grow up <br>  <br>  all the things you said about yourself are true<br>  <br>  Only you can stop yourself no one else you have to want it bad enough <br>  <br>  My ? is why are you doing this self destruction <br>  <br>  You do you think you are to hurt other people in this way??<br>  Really what gives you the right??????|`|1Q8T13z6aa	First and foremost, you need to take ownership for your actions. Once you do that, then the work can begin. <br>  Only you have the power to stop the things that are happening. Saying "No" to things that make you feel better and valued by another is not the answer here.<br>  If you truly love your Husband in the way that you say you do, you would not be doing these things to hurt him, since while they are hurting him, in the long run they are hurting you as well.<br>  How to stop all this? Grow a spine, say no and mean it, put all the energy you have put into your own feelings, into your marriage. <br>  You need to find a constructive way to channel your anger, and so does your spouse.<br>  Are you ready to do the work to make it better? Only you have the answer to these questions you have asked here.<br>  Good Luck.
tN1JDXFvaa	yes something very important your self respect<br>  i know it doesn't really seem all that important now, but trust me it is. carrying around the reutation of a **** WILL change everything and not in a good way. boys will treat you different the only thing they'll expect out of you will be sex not a real relationship, and the girls will hate you and talk maliciously about you. PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T GO DOWN THIS PATH STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF AND NO ONE ELSE|`|kr9ajCZxaa	sl**s are most likely broke, trashy, and shouldn't be worth anyone's time.
9Uo8j6kuaa	I think it would be a nice thing to do, but not absolutely necessary. Think about how you would feel in her shoes. It would be a pleasant surprise, and a great way to break the ice. Just get her something casual that you know she likes, so she knows you've been thinking about her and you still care. Good luck! =]
KM61uWuSaa	You never know how anyone is going to think of you regardless of color|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	their main concern is how you are treating her. my fiance' is white and he was scared to death and i had to tell him over and over....they could careless about his skin color. my dad even told him.

e443bee0481cacb886df238a17813ab2aa	try talking to him,see if u have common interests,be natural, don't be anxious or something cause it will show! keep smiling and laughing! u can also play hard to get but not too hard after all u want him to ask u out !if it's not working he may not actually like u but u can also take your chances|`|cI0c1jLVaa	firstly u can act all like interested by curling ur hair and smiling and let it remain the traional way and make him ask u that is <br>  <br>  or be very sure and confident sound genuine when u as and do not panic when he says no "or in other words" just be very ready for a NO and see how it goes i am sure he will say yes|`|60be9b68c67eb17f7315d54616b5066baa	I would say DONT ask a guy out just keep giving him hints that you like him and flirt a lot because if you ask a guy out sometimes it doesnt work out for the best. I say DONT and if you do make sure you are ready to deal with the consequences.|`|0qsDlj6Xaa	im the same with you! so sorry!|`|Hp1eNJo1aa	just do it or have one of ur friends do it. there is nothing to be nurvous about.
AA12198711	She is going to have to want the exact same thing in order for it to happen.<br>  <br>  Communication is always important for the parent and the child. Parents that let their children seclude themselves and think it is just a phase are truly missing out on some very important events and details about their child's life.<br>  <br>  Talk to her, let her know you want her to talk to you. Let her know that she is welcome to come to you and talk to you about anything. A child needs to know that about their parents. They need to know that even if what they have o tell them is wrong that they will not be persecuted for it. So many children are afraid to be open with their parents.<br>  <br>  Respect her.|`|wCFxvJvVaa	Be cool with her and communicate with her that's the main key.
