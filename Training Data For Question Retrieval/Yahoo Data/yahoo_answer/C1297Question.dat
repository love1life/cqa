Let B be the time for the big hole to empty the barrel problem   Let L be the time for the little hole to empty the barrel problem   B+2L=12   2B+L=10      i'd like to think that with that solution the answers for L and B are just switched and that B= 4 and 2/3 and L= 2 and 2/3 and that for 3 big holes and 3 littles holes takes 2 minutes to empty the barrel, if it is thats great BUT i can't show/prove my work because how i found out the answers aren't mathmatical at all just guessing and playign around with numbers, can someone explain to me please. I think my teacher said something about the equations supposed to be inverse? i don't know he was kind of rambling on.

Another car (Car 3) speeds past Car 2 at the speed of light relative to Car 2's speed going the same direction as Car 2.      Shouldn't I be able to measure Car 3 as going twice the speed of light? If not, then isn't that sort of a paradox?

20090226171224AAoUwxW	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does my theory on a Microwave-Nuclear Generator make any sense?	I have an AWESOME theory that I have been working on for over a week now.  I'm a little worried that someone will steal this idea and get the credit.  Please tell me if this sounds plausible.      A microwave oven heats food up by vibrating molecules within the microwave.  So using the theory of relativity, I came up with a great idea.  You put a small sample of uranium inside of a microwave oven.  You turn the microwave on.  Nothing happens....yet.  You then put that microwave INSIDE of ANOTHER, bigger microwave.  The molecules in the bigger microwave would vibrate, causing the ATOMS in the smaller microwave to vibrate at an exponentially greater rate, which would lead to a nuclear reaction.  This theory could save BILLIONS of dollars if it works.  Please get back to me on this ASAP.  I'm considering submitting this idea to the United States Department of Energy.

20090225120403AAjDrsG	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	I need help with a piece of the 2nd part of my project on building a website! help please!!!?	In this assignment, you will add more features to the home page you created for your last homework:         1. Change the background - either change the background color or use a background image. Be careful - make sure that the text and links still show out clearly. You may want to change the color of the text or links.      2. Add a picture -  Make sure that the image files are in .gif, .jpg/.jpeg, or .png format. Do not use image files that end with .bmp or .art - they will not show up on all browsers (even though they may work with AOL.)      3. Add at least 3 links to other pages, with a description of why you chose those links.      4. Make sure that your page includes both a title and a heading (and make sure that you understand the difference!)      5. Your page should contain a form. The form should contain at least one text box and at least one button. (At this point, nothing will happen when the button is pressed, but later in the semester we will learn how to associate pressing a button with some action.)

I'm planning on going to college and being a successful person and i really would love to work with animals. My question is what do you need to do to be a vetenarian?? I dont know much about being a vetenerian and im not too sure if i would like to perform surgery on animals so i dont know if this job would be for me, BUT I HAVE NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE so i have no idea what to expect! Another question is what other job is there that deals with animals? I'm thinking about working with smaller animals than big ones and in a vets office you know like maybe work at an animal hospital and be a vetenarian there i dont think i want to go to people's farms but i would like to work at an office, another thing is that do you think it would be easy for me to find a job as a vet? Or is it a competitive career , and lastly what schooling do i need? I'm a junior in high school right now! Thanks for the info and also if you are a vet, how do you like your job?

20090226192459AAKS9eE	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemistry help, enthalpy lab with ethanol?	Ok, so we did a lab where we put ethanol into a calorimeter along with the temp. probe and it went from 20.25 celsius to 21.3 celsius. it was 0.5 ml of ethanol. so i think this would be the reaction:      C2H5OH(l) + 3O2 --> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g)      and when i calculate the values all out, it turns out to be -1234.8, using Hess's law. So i'm pretty sure that's right (but feel free to correct me if i'm wrong!)      My question is, now that we've calculated the actual value, how do we calculate the experimental value? I'm assuming that somehow we need to turn the temp difference into kJ/mol...      oh, and we had to leave the calorimeter half open to fit the temperature probe in, so it will likely have a lot of error.      thanks for any help!
