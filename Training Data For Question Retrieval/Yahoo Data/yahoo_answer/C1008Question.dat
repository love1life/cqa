20090223162719AAU8M2E	Sports;Surfing	Surfing since the summer of '08?	My first time I ever stood up and did surfing was this summer, of course on a foam board at Newport's Second Beach (In Rhode Island). Got up my first try   This past week I went to Hawaii with my buddy that I surfed with the only time over the summer we took lessons and we didn't really need them because were were up the first time riding the waves in all the way to shore. We surfed Lahaina, Muai and after our lessons the instructors were complemnting us on how well we were doing for only our second time surfing.     some of the waves rose up to my head or my chest   I'm 5'2 and I rode a 7 foot board in my preference it was a little to long.       2 days after the beaches were having high surf, with 25 mph winds coming from the NW I was given a 6 foot board maybe a little longer inches wise and the waves were double the size of my body of course i was getting slammed by the waves, def wasn't the best idea to go surfing that day but I rode 3 perfect waves in shore that were larger than me.       And then yesterday my last day I caught 6-7 waves within an hour using the same board i used the day before the waves were a little smaller butt all the waves i caught were the same height as me a little taller a little shorter.       I live on the north east so I don't get much action over here, I have boatt and a wake board so I'm learning how to wake board over the summer, I also skateboard.       Questions-   1) Are there any good surf spots on the east close near the providence area? (already know bout second beach)   2) Thinking bout buying  a board. I'm 5'2 weigh 104 what would be a good board for someone who lives on the east coast. I travel alot to florida so I can bring my board there and surf there are there any good surfing spots near cape canaveral ?    3) For what I've done so far from what I've given you does it seems like I'm doing well for someone who doesnt surf once a week, and only surfs once ever 3-4 monthes. ?      really important. because i absolutely love surfing, and if I had the chance to do it more I would I jsut live no where near good areas thanks for your help :]

20070323062940AAJEZgE	Sports;Basketball	The Suns dont defend??	so a lot of people are hating on the Suns, especially Nash. all i can say is that Nash has been tehre for 3 years, and all 3 years they have been Pacific Champs. Nash deserves the MVP's he was given and its not because he has all stars running with him. he has turned the players into all stars. lets not forget that these players were playing with Marbury...how did that turn out? no one has yet to give statistical and factual evidence of why Nash sucks. and thats because he doesnt.      anyway my point here is that people say the suns dont defend. but they do!!      sure they let in over 100 points per game, but they also score more then 100 points per game. the suns dont play a style of game that uses up the shot clock. they take quick shots, therefore giving the opposing team more time to come back and take a shot. this in turn means more shots taken. if u take more shots, theres a chance u hit more shots.

But since I didn't make the high school team(i am just a freshman), i was thinknig about trying to convert to being a utility man. I am a natural infielder, but its the outfield position i am having trouble with. I used to start for the travel league 2 years ago, but ever since then, and sometimes even when I was playing on that team, i can never seem to be able to judge fly balls. Sometimes I see the ball going one way, but in reality it goes another. I don't seem to be able to have that natural feeling I have when I play infield, and I am starting to doubt my playing skills. Any way to help judge fly balls or just help get a more natural feel for the outfield?      -mrZ

I bought a new pair ( cause i like thier brand image ) and 3 months later they broke. That really bugged me. So I bought asics. They lasted me 1.5 years of running. I thought I would try nike again and the same thing happend. So I went back to asics and am really happy. I now have the asics Kayano, and think that they are great. A month ago I bought a nike track suit. A week later the seams started to come apart. So i have come to the conclusion that nike is not a quality product, it just has amazing markating skills. I would like to hear from other sports people what they think of nike, if they have tryed and tested their goods. And what you think of asics.

20070522151357AAVquqe	Sports;Baseball	Baseball Ethic?	Is their a certain amount of ethic in baseball?  What in your opinion are some does or don'ts?  For example there's the hidden ball play where say the third basemen carries the ball out of the meeting on the mound ussually the pitcher would be a lefty to more easily hide the ball, or in this case not having the ball.      Also what about a pop up in the infield where the base runner not only runs by screaming but sort of stops and is screaming in the fielders ear.  What if he's screaming vulgar things?  Ok and what if he's just absolutely an inch away from the players ear and he screams to scare the pants off the other guy.  Is that an un written rule in baseball do you think?      Lastly, what about a fake injury?  Say that a fielder does it to get a runner to gamble on another base?  Or for example a hitter falls just short of first base while is team mate rounds third for a close play at the plate with 2 outs drawing a throw to first to get the sure out before the run scores.

20080927141021AA4JaYW	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Looking for a 20 gauge shotgun...help please?	Hey!  I am looking for a 20ga. shotgun for deer hunting this fall.  The thing is, is most stores around here mostly have 12ga. shotguns, 3-30 or 30-06.  Most or all of the employees keep trying to get me into a 12ga. when I clearly say, no 12ga. what so ever and that I want a 20 ga.  Could this be because I'm female and they think I can't handle a 20ga?  I've shot them numerous times before when I've gone hunting (they've been borrowed) and have had no problems.        Here's the thing though, most 20ga. are too heavy for me and some youth or womans models either have too short of a barrel or are pretty light duty and would not shoot the distance that I would prefer.  What would be some good models to check out?  The so called "kick back" I'm not worried about, no I don't want to have to be tied to a tree so I don't go flying the other way it kicks back so bad but I'm not worried about the gun having kick back.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  I have found one gun but the store no longer carries that specific gun or anything close to it so now I am stuck having to start all over again from the begining.

Eso sí, el partido será ofrecido también en pago por visión (PPV) a través de Digital +.      Después de que Sogecable rompiera el pacto con Mediapro y diera el Bar?a-Athletic a través de Audiovisual Sport en pago por visión, Mediapro ha decidido romper también el acuerdo y ofrecer el Villarreal-Real Madrid a través de La Sexta. Hay lío para rato.

20070901234203AASYnu4	Sports;Football (American)	Texas Longhorn fans only! Houston we have a problem!?	Texas 20, Arkansas st. 13.....  Anybody see a problem here? I do, it's going to be a looong painful season.. Texas defense is absolutely horrible, the secondary is horrible. The secondary is very young though, so I'll give them credit. That's just one of the many problems on this team. The running game sucks, why? because Texas can not run the "shotgun spead offense with colt mccoy as the QB. Why? cause Colt mccoy is not a "threat" to take off and run on defenses. Vince Young was great for that offense, but now he is gone so Texas needs to do a total re-do on offense. With Colt mccoy, Texas needs to use the I- formation, shotgun, etc... Texas does not need to use the shotgun/zone read offense, cause again Colt mccoy will not fake anybody out... He is not fast enough or athletic enough to brake a 30 yard run... Mack brown/greg davis need to make a decision real quick like on changing things, cause I feel like the Longhorns will lose atleast 3 games this year. Just a sloppy effort today.

I don't want to hear that crap about being in the division they're in. They still swept boston in the season. They OWED Boston in the season. The only reason they lost 3 out of 4 in the playoffs were defensive errors. Because without the errors the Angels would have owened the Red Sox. Even though, they left so many on base and didn't have the clutch batting. So I ask, what should the next move be with the roster?
