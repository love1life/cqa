20081002094909AA8IFi2	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How should I go about getting recommendations?	I don't like the current university I am at, so I am transferring. I need three recommendations from professors or my ad visors, which is fine, but it is only a month into the semester, and I don't know my professors that well or my advisor. Most of my college classes are huge, so I don't know how you are supposed to know them one on one. The other problem, is that wouldn't it be kind of awkward saying I need recommendations for a transfer because I am leaving their school? My recommendations are not going to be even relevant to my next course of study, which is communication disorders. I am currently in criminal justice. I am just so confused.

20081004142955AAFP8bC	Education & Reference;Teaching	Should I further an education in music?	Hi,    Ive been playing guitar for 6 years, both Acoustic and Electric. I've been taking informal lessons and I have leaned to play classical peices like "Moonlight Sonata" and "Four Seasons - Summer." I have a good grip on my instrument and I learned most techniques. Generally, I can accurately play (sixteenth notes) at a tempo of 160 bpm.      I have moderate knowledge of music theory, such as triads, chord formation, scales and modality..etc My main weakness is reading musical scores; I can read time signatures but i have difficulty finding the actual notes (most of the time I read Tabs/Tablature with time signature). I plan to improve my knowledge of theory and scores as soon as I have polished every bit of my technique.      However, currently I'm 22, a sophomore at business school, I'm doing well enough with a GPA of 3.2. I have always thought of music as a side hobby, but now I'm considering a more formal education in music.       By the time I graduate business school, I should at least have an infallable technique and an extensive knowledge of theory and I should be able to read scores.      Im heavily inspired by guitar teacher, after he graduated Electrical Engineering, he went to Europe and studied in various conservatories there. He's 28 and now works as an Engineer by day and teaches by night (and is amazingly successful!!).      So my question is, should I consider a formal education in music after I graduate business, or is this just a far-fetched dream? Should I just stick to what Im doing right now and focus on my business career? If you recommend that I should go for it, can you spare some advice, please? What else should I need to know or learn before considering a musical education?      Thank you all :-)

Academically, the school I want to transfer to has a better business college, which is important to my degree. They might be able to obtain internships better later on in my college career.    It is also a bigger campus, and I have come to realize how I don't like the small campus I am at now. I do want to try really hard to like my current university because it is so close to home but it isn't working out. I will have to be further from home if I go to the other university but it doesn't matter as long as I am happy. Plus, the school that I am at now it the only one I visited on my college search, so that was probably a bad decision from the start. I should have looked at alot more. Do you think it would be a good idea to transfer schools? How do you know a school is right for you?

20070518093059AABdpMD	Education & Reference;Trivia	L'histoire  d'un toutou  un peu spécial   !!!;-)?	Pour donner un nom hors du commun à mon chien, je l'ai nommé ‘Baiser’ (comme pour un baiser mignon). Ce fut une erreur, mais je ne l'ai remarqué que plus tard :   1) Lorsque après mon déménagement je me suis rendu à la municipalité pour le faire enregistrer, je dis au percepteur que je venais payer la taxe pour Baiser. Il me répondit qu'il n'y avait pas encore de taxe à payer pour cela.   - Mais il s'agit d'un chien, lui répondis-je. Il me répliqua que les relations sexuelles avec les animaux sont interdites par la loi, mais que malgré cela, il n'y avait pas de taxe à payer.   - Vous ne comprenez pas, lui dis-je, j'ai Baiser depuis que j'ai neuf ans.... Il me jeta dehors.   2) Pendant notre voyage de noces, le chien nous avait accompagnés. Comme je ne voulais pas qu'il nous dérange, je demandai à la réception de l'h?tel une chambre supplémentaire pour Baiser.   La dame de service me répondit que toutes les chambres de l'h?tel étaient équipées à cet effet.   - Vous ne comprenez pas, lui dis-je, Baiser m'empêche de dormir toute la nuit. Mais elle me répondit qu'elle aussi, ?a l'empêchait de dormir.   3) Une fois, je me rendis à un concours de beauté pour chiens, je voulais y présenter Baiser. Un gars à l'entrée me demanda la raison de ma présence au concours. Je lui répondis que j'étais ici pour Baiser. Il me suggéra de faire imprimer mes cartes d'entrées privées et de les vendre. Lorsque je lui demandai si le concours était télévisé, il me traita de pervers.   4) Un jour, Baiser tomba malade et je dus le conduire chez le vétérinaire. Le lendemain, j'allai le reprendre. - Lequel est-ce, me demanda la demoiselle en feuilletant dans ses cartes d'admission, Milou, Médor... ou Paf ?   - Que diriez vous de Baiser, lui répondis-je et je re?us une gifle sur la joue.   5) Le même jour, Baiser s'échappa et je le cherchai partout. Je me rendis au refuge pour animaux pour le chercher.   - Que voulez-vous ? me demanda le gardien.   - Baiser, lui répondis-je. Il était d'avis que ce n'était pas le bon endroit pour baiser.   6) Je cherchai toute la nuit. Vers 4 heures, un agent de police me demanda ce que je voulais en pleine nuit dans ce quartier chic, lorsque je lui répondis que je voulais seulement Baiser et rien d'autre, il m'embarqua.   7) Lors du divorce, ma femme et moi devions nous présenter devant le juge pour le partage des biens. Naturellement, je voulais à tout prix garder mon chien, je ne voulais pas le lui laisser :   - Votre Honneur, j'avais déjà Baiser avant le mariage.   Il répondit simplement :   - Et alors ? Moi aussi!

I can easily bring that up so I too won't have to take it, but still, it's unfair that some students won't have to take the exam simply because they got a higher grade than others. I feel everyone should have to take it, even if there grade is 100%. Why drop an assignment, especially a major one that is worth 20% of our grade, from them? It's unfair.

It is just that I don't initiate conversations with others, but once I know someone I am really outgoing. I really don't relate to anyone here, which I hate. My roommate is my only friend.   2. Their business college is one of the best in the U.S, which is really important, and better than my current college.   3. My best friend goes there, which is good, but the least important.   4. There are no clubs and organizations that I am interested in here except one or two, and the one that I did join, is really unorganized and not financially funded well. The other college has many other clubs that I am interested in, and their greek life is bigger. That is something I really like.   4.

20090309193209AAQqWHr	Education & Reference;Quotations	What do you think this statement means and why?	" The most effectual means of preventing the perversion of power into tyranny are to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people. It is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational beings or not, and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand the test of truth and reason. Light and liberty go together. I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource most to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness of man. Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day. If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. No nation is permitted to live in ignorance with impunity. "      This was a quote from a very famous important person, what do you think about this statement & why?

20090309202606AA4HDBN	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What is wrong with me?	I just would like to know if i am normal? i am 25 and scared to death of getting married or having kids. The last relationship i was in was with a single father who was unaffectionate towards me, abused me verbally and made sure i took birth control so he wouldn't get me pregnant but still wanted me to be a mother to his child. After that relationship i have just been all about myself. I don't socialize too much and to make it worse my family says go and be by yourself now so you can figure out what you want. I understand my mother wants grandkids as she approaches her 60s but she thought me to be independent, i was raised without a father and now as grown as i am i feel this is the normal way to be. Right now i am beign courted by 2 older men. One is in his early 40s and the other in his late 40s. these men are desperate to be married and to start families of their own. I purposely got on birth control so i don't have to get knocked up by anyone and be stuck with some man i hate for the rest of my life. I also saw how things went with my sister who lived with her boyfriend for 2yrs and things did not work out. His family came in the middle and made her life hell and then they have a child together and a custody battled ensued for a good 1yr. I know life is difficult but i must say that this whole pressure thing is getting on me and i just don't know how to feel about it.

Three weeks before the show practice is three to six on mondays and thursdays,  so I would have to go to soccer some days and orchestra others.  Then, the week before the show,  I have practice from 6 to ten, so I'd go straight from soccer to orchestra.  All my grades will drop because it will be ten o'clock and I'd have done pretty much nothing, except work in between breaks.      But I really, REALLY want to be in the pit orchestra.

20090309221253AAnKbX1	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I go to this college?	I'm really interested in the Watkins College of Art, Design, and Film in Tennessee. It's very affordable to be a private arts college and has an excellent film program, which is what I'd be going for, to earn my BA in Film Studies. But on collegeboard.com it says that Watkins is a "candidate for accreditation" from the SACS. Would it be a waste for me to go to a college that's just a candidate? Or is it a good chance that the school will be accredited by the time I graduate?      Also, only working in film, would accreditation be an extremely important thing?

Indian Removal: Trail of Tears       From the persecution of Christians at the hands of the Romans to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, the crime of hate has been felt by millions. Persecution it is a sad reality in every corner of the world. It’s based on religion, race, gender, and even the political views. Men, women, and even small children are treated with cruelty, starvation, and are sometimes even brutally beaten very badly and killed. Although separated by geography and time, the pain and suffering experienced by the Native Americans in the Trail of Tears unites them to their Jewish brothers who suffered a similar fate at the hands of the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. The strongest similarities and differences between the Holocaust and Trail of Tears’ can be made through race, politics, and power.  Similarities? Diff?  ^^^      1st Body – Difference   ( Reason why) ^    Holocaust – Jews inferior Hitler didn’t like them, wanted to kill them.    Trail of Tears - Land      Jews inferior, Hitler didn’t like them, and wanted to kill them. Hitler’s reason for killing the Jews was because he thought that Jews were to blame for all the financial problems going on in Europe, so he decided to take them from everything they had ever known, and put them to work in concentration camps to make them pay. Jews were not the only victims Hitler killed. Others were the Polish group, physically and mentally handicapped, and the gypsies. The Holocaust was designed to rid the world of inferior races and to exalt the Aryan race.      2nd Body     Who did it - Similarity    Holocaust   Trail of Tears           The Native Americans and the Jews were both similar and different in the government they had. The U.S. government forced the Native Americans to relocate and to leave their land. Their march when moving out of their tribes was very devastating and deadly. American cities were growing fast, and white settlers wanted to take over all the land in the west to build new cities. One thing that the Native American government and the Nazi government have in common is that the government, in both cases was in control. Likewise, the U.S government was in complete control of the Native Americans. Their leader was Adolf Hitler. He wanted total dictatorship over the European countries. According to one source “In the early years of the Nazi regime, the National Socialist government established concentration camps to detain real and imagined political and ideological opponents” (The Holocaust). The Nazi’s viewed the Jewish population as a problem. They were going to fix this problem by exterminating them. They were a problem because they did not fit Hitler’s standards. He wanted an Aryan race, blond hair blue eyed race. Jews were a problem because they did not fit these standards. The only way to get rid of them was to “exterminate” by the hundreds of thousands.      3rd Body – Similarity   Both lost rights    Jews – go in to pub, ghettos,   Native Americans – forced off land, school? rights?       Both the Jews and the Native Americans lost strength and power during both times. The thing that made each group similar and different was of the leader they had. For the Jews, Hitler was among the greatest leaders during the Holocaust and gained most of the power. However, Hitler’s way of gaining power was to concentrate on the Jews the most due to their religion, and for the blame of financial problems going on in Europe. According to one article “To concentrate and monitor the Jewish population as well as to facilitate later deportation of the Jews, the Germans and their collaborators created ghettos, transit camps, and forced-labor camps for the Jews during the war years” (The Holocaust). The Nazi’s used a phrase called “The Final Solution,” which meant for the Nazi regime to find and easier way to manipulate the Jewish population by sending the Jews, gypsies, the physically challenged and mentally challenged people to a concentration camp for further detainment. With the Jews out of the way, it was believed that the Germans would exalt to the superior Aryan race. Over the years, the Nazi regime developed buildings for the sole purpose of detaining and obliterating people belonging to the Jewish faith. In such facilities, the imprisoned would live under harsh environments with other people. From time to time, people would be taken out to be shot and buried into ditches. Others would be killed massively with the use of gas chambers. Others would be burned to ashes in ovens, designed to burn humans. In these ovens, the human fat would sustain enough of a source of energy to keep the oven lit.        Hate and hate crimes will always exist within our world, we cannot escape it, but we can fight against it. The Native Americans and their Jewish brothers will always have the comparison of hatred against them. Many people found it hard to believe the Jews because the events were too horrible for men and women to believe. We are accustomed to the horrors

20090309210943AAHiO6n	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Does this make sense?	The ocean covers approximately 71% of the earth’s surface.  The mystery of the deep has fascinated people for thousands of years and scuba diving has allowed people to discover it for themselves.  Even though much of the bottom of the world’s oceans is unexplored and unmapped, scuba diving allows ordinary people to explore and experience part of the underwater world.        Scuba is the acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.  A portable metal tank attached to the back of a diver supplies compressed for people to stay underwater for great lengths of time.  Scuba diving as a recreational sport is becoming more popular nowadays.  Recreational diving uses only compressed air as the breathing mixture, is never done solo, does not exceed a depth of 40 metres and doesn’t require decompression stops.  Professional diving, used for military, governmental, commercial and scientific purposes, serves a specific mission for each dive and divers are paid to dive.  Technical diving exceeds recreational limits but is not for profit.  The nature of their diving and type of equipment used exceed the boundaries of Recreational Scuba Diving.         Make any changes you want, to me this doesn't flow nicely. Thanks :)

I only need two more courses that can transfer to another college a couple hours away ( I would have to relocate, and am not ready). My tuition is being paid by financial aid. There are computer courses available from that other school; i was wondering if it's possible to stay at the college i'm at, and while taking those remaining classes i need, if I can also be taking another two online from the other school. I need a minimum of four classes to receive financial aid and wouldn't want to pay and take classes that are of no use towards my major. So is this possible?? How would I go about it? I can not transfer to that other school because i'm not financiallyy ready to live out on my own. Maybe by next spring I may be, but for this coming fall I would like to know if I could carry out these plans.

20090309223501AAwfJ1i	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What does this sound like to you?	Wednesday night i began getting sick. My symptoms included: stomach spasms(worse when laying down), sore throat(hurts to swollow), pain in my right lower rib, nausea, dizziness, and random hot flashes. I have not thrown up although ive felt like it for several days; ive also been constipated. I havent been able to get much sleep because of my spasms, sometimes ill wake up choking on air. I had reason to believe that i have an ulcer since all the symtoms match and the fact that most of the causes were things that i did on the regular basis, such as: Use of anti-inflammatory medications(aspirin), smoking cigarettes(quit about 1month ago), consuption of caffeine, psychological stress, type O blood type, and poor diet(most of the time i have one meal a day and its always either mexican food or something fatty). I went in to see my doctor because i was worried about this, however, she told me that there is no possibility of me having an ulcer. She had me have my lungs xrayed and my blood drawn. After my xrays were taken i asked to look at them, there was an about 3 inch in diameter shape(i dont remember) right under my rib, i asked what it could be and she told me that she thought it was a large air bubble but id have to wait for the doctors to call me. I was also prescriped zantac; then she suggested i get some ibuprofen. Theres no possibility of pregnancy. If you have any idea of what this could be it would really help. Thanks

He will be able to get a much better job if he goes ahead and does the college right now. It will take him approx. two years to do the courses he is needing. Thanks for all your help!! God Bless!

20090309211557AABBqGg	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Will owing another school money stop me from getting financial aid?	When I turned 18, I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker, so I went to an artsy school in New Mexico. After one semester I had to leave because the financial aid department lied to me about how much money I would be awarded. When I left, I owed the school $8,000. This isn't a loan, this is just money that I owe the school outright. Now I'm going back to school. I'm in community college now paying cash because I'm afraid that if I apply for financial aid, I won't be able to go to school at all on account of owing money to another school. If I were able to apply for financial aid, I would be attending the local university, but seeing as how I have an apartment alone, and I wait tables for a living, community college is all I can afford.   On my transcripts I left the artsy school out entirely. I am currently going to school now for counseling and one day hope to progress to medical school to become a psychiatrist. I guess what I'm asking is; if I fill out a FAFSA, will it stop me from being able to finish up my associates degree? The school was accredited, but all I took were ridiculous film courses. I've been searching for the answer to this question for quite some time and I just can't find it. I appreciate all of your input.      Thank you

20090309213358AAErL1j	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I go to Architecture school or work alongside an Architect for 6-7 years?	If the right people are reading this, then you guys would know that there are two ways of becoming a licensed architect.      First is to go through school, graduate, become an intern, and take the board.   Second is to work alongside an architect for 6-7 years and be allowed to challenge the board.      Now the reason I'm considering this is because college is so expensive.  If money wasn't a problem, I would definitely choose to go to school.  Anyway, I was thinking, either way, its probably going to take me the same amount of time to get my license.  And if I work alongside an Architect, I will be learning first hand, working, and getting experience early.  Also, I won't have to sit through all the classroom stuff.      I would like to ask other people for their opinion.  If there are any Architects out there, I would really love to hear fro you. Thanks!

20090309231310AAzD73T	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Help with course selection plz!!!!?	Ok, I'm a freshman and next year I'm going to be a softmore and I can't decide what courses I wanna take next year.      Here are the mandatory courses:   -English   -Social Studies   -Math   -Science   -PE      Then, we have to choose at least 3 electives and 4 alternate electives (just in case it's not possible to get into the 3 electives we've already chosen)      So far, the only elective I'm sure about is Dance.  I've also thought of taking 2 languages (French and Spanish) but I'm not sure about it because it might be a lot of work taking 2 languages and my work habits are not that great.      Also, I've only chosen 2 alternate courses (Cooking and Drama) but I'm not sure about cooking because it was a mandatory course this year and I would always spill stuff or mess up the recipe.  The only reason I passed it was because we were in groups.  Next year, they might make us work individually.  I need two more alternate courses and I can't think of anything else.      Also, I'm really afraid that the school might make a mistake because last year there was a bunch of kids that signed up for dance and they didn't get it.  They didn't get it because the school messed up everybody's course selection.  I really wanna take dance up until I'm a senior (in order to get a dance diploma) but I'm afraid the same thing will happen to me.      One more thing lolz, I'm extremely bad at math and I'm not sure if I want to take Math Essentials (the easier Math) rather than Principles of Math (regular math).      Here are somethings about me that might help in choosing my courses:   -I love to dance, that's why I'm taking the course   -I sort of like acting, but I'm not sure about it   -I like singing a lot but I've heard that choir is really boring and also it's after school everyday and if I make Dance Company (this program in my school that's sort of hard to get into) it's also after school everyday, so that will probably mess up my schedule   -I'm Filipino, and our language is really close to Spanish and that's the main reason I wanna take it (and u know also to get an easy A)   -I live in Canada and that's why I wanna take French and also because it was a mandatory course this year (I'm still taking it right now) and so far I'm getting an A but my grade might change later on so I'm not sure about it.      So, plz help me!

20090309232003AAf5nPQ	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What do I do if I fail high school?	A lot of things in my life have been crap, most recently..    I've been diagnosed with depression, diabetes, insomnia.   My dog died, my father wont talk to me, and I feel my mothers mental health is deteriorating.   All of this is just making going to school even harder, I keep on missing a lot days, and I mean a lot. Right now I'm pretty sure it's just pointless to go anymore. I was doing good, first semester was great, but stuff kept on getting worse.   So now I'm out of school. What now? A year ago I wanted to go to Full Sail University and learn about game development, but without a high school diploma, I have a feeling I'm screwed.   So what do I do now? Can anyone help me?
