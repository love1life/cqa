After that you paint and remove the blue painters tape and your line is "crisp and sharp". What is the NAME of the solution and where is it sold?

20090309183711AAShNby	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What can I do to the rose plant in my garden to guarantee flowers?	Ok long story short, Im renting a place that has about 5 rose plants (are they plants? I almost wrote bush but they are over 1.5 metres high) that I want to have flower.      So my questions are:      1. When do they flower in Australia? Im located in Perth, WA   2. What can I do now that is cost effective (want to spend little to no money) to guarantee flowers?   3. Are there any products in the home I could use?      They are in an ok condition... still green and the leaves look ok (no damage or fungas etc) and I water them on my allocated days. Thanks for the replies  :o)

20090309190603AAykoEf	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How to fill the wood borad spaces?	I just moved to an an apartment complex on the first floor with a beautiful large balcony.  The balcony floor  is made of natural wood boards (like deck boards), with spaces in between of course.      My second floor neighbors, who are very nice, have pets and kids.  I have been constantly seeing dirts coming from my neighbor balcony.  My neighbor apologized several times about these dirts, and we both know that is falling from their balcony floor through the spaces between wood boards.      How can I fill the spaces between the boards so nothing will fall over my lovely balcony...thus keep it clean and away from any falling objects.  Thanks.
20090309192708AAq5aHB	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Vinyl Lattice Panels - Where to Buy?	I saw 4x8 vinyl lattice panels at Home Depot/Lowe's and would like to use these along with growing vines to give some privacy to a patio (but not complete enclosure). Not much in stock but I assume they could order. When I started researching this idea on the internet, it seems that a lot of people think the product sold at the big box stores is inferior. But I can't find anyplace else to get them, whether online or in person. Lumber yards, landscape supply, and fence companies (except very expensive fences) do not seem to have them.  I'm anxious to get this project going but I've hit a dead end. Can anyone help?!  Thanks.

20070329095046AAaj1iZ	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	How do you eliminate the odor that asian beatles leave in a home or room when they expire?	Asian Beatles leave a smell/odor behind when they die.  The ordor is worse than tobacco or pet odors.  They infest your house in cracks and crevases where they die and begin to stink.  No amount of cleaning seems to reduce the odor they leave behind.  The same odor that they emit when you crush them.  We cleaned our motorhome from stem to stern and removed all traces of the dead beatles.  But they have left their mark forever.

Problem is, it looks like a typical garage with bikes, and boxes, and an unused washing machine. We have chairs and a radio and stuff that we use to hang out, and we have a refrigerator sort of for refreshments. My garage is very spacious and would be perfect for us if it didn't look so depressing. There's no air-conditioning, so It gets hot, but I plan on adding fans. The lighting is really bad and I can't stand it. What can I do to decorate my garage, any ideas? My budget isn't too tight.
