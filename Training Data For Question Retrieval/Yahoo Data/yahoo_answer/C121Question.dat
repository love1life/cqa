20090202170120AAJjNZU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How many times should I change diapers?	I got laid off and right now i'm a stay at home dad. My wife has been providing food, diapers etc for me and our child for the last 2 months. So i'm basically home all day looking after our 14 month old daughter. My question is, when she's home do I have to continue to care of the our child, like changing diapers and feeding or she should take that all while I do other things like work on a script that I'm writing.      We just got into a huge fight about the parenting responsibilities. I feel that once she's home, i shouldnt have to change diapers because while she at work im the one doing it.

We are at our wit's end with our three year old son and I am considering buying this e-book to help but want to see if anyone had feedback first.      for anyone who is wondering:   We have tried the positive reward method with him (i.e. giving him stickers to use the potty, etc)   He does not seem to care about being in a poopy diaper for hours on end, so putting him in regular underpants for the uncomfortable experience won't work (and we've been there!)   We are consistent but he just screams when we put him on the potty   We have tried both a potty chair and a potty seat that fits on the big toilet.   He is very strong willed and refuses to listen even with discipline.      any help of any kind is appreciated. This is getting out of hand and we don't know what to do!

My step-mom and i dont agree on anything, we constantly bicker about everything, and its emotional draining. i dont feel comfortable at his house because of her. one of my sisters is 2 days younger than i am. so we have a constant comparison.     both dad and his wife have control issues. they have to control every aspect. One example is texting. for christmas i got texting back, i went with my mom a couple days, and i sent 2,000 texts. they set a guidline of 100 texts a day.   i went over then they block the whole thing, but only let me text at lunch. but other times of the day its blocked.      another thing is laundry, i cant do laundry at my dads, only at my moms. because my step-mom said i couldnt.      no phone when i get home, they dont let me go to friends houses.   its gotten to the point where i dont know what to do, i dont talk here anymore, or volenteer any information on my days, im always away from them.   i think i would honestly be in foster care then be here.      does anybody have any step-by-step planes to get out of this hell house?       how do other people parent thier teenagers?

20090202175116AAyj5lm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you think In Vitro fertilizations should be regulated more strictly?	I've read about the lady who had the octuplets and she has 6 more children at home-oldest is 7!! And they were all conceived via in vitro. She lives with her mom and her 6 children and ina  few months she'll be living with 14 kids...    I wonder who's gonna support all those kids... since she's a single mom... I also worry about her older children, youngest is 2! Who's going to be there for her? Her mom?? She'll be looking after the 8 babies! I think it's unfair to her children and not very healthy for her.   I understand women go to fertility treatments because they cant have children or they want children and they're single-I know some women like that, but they stop once they have their child/children! They dont continue till they raise a football team! Do you guys think in vitro should be regulated more tightly to check on the woman's psychological aspect as well? Whether it's a good thing for her or not? I know they do it for plastical surgery-why not for in vitro treatments where the lives of the future children are at stake too? Im just wondering what do you think the rules should be...      By the way I am a mom of two young children, 4 and 2.

20090202171221AAQtpYQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PREGNANT OR AUNT FLOW? *Help please*?	Hi everyone!      I ovulated on Monday January 19th. And had intercourse the 18th (day before), 15th and the 13th.   All last week I thought I was having pregnancy symptoms. My breasts were heavy, a little swollen, and a little sore. I had some nausea, and a little cramping.      I've also been keeping track of my BBT, and before I ovulated it was anywhere from 96.2 - 96.8. And now its anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7. I've been surprised to see it at 97.9 for a few days.      Normally I dont get nauseated or swollen/tender/heavy breasts before my period. Just some usual cramping.      The past 3-4 days now, I have not had sore breasts at all. I was a little nauseated and light-headed this morning tho. I also had killer cramps this morning too. I had to take some Tylenol to ease the pain.   Is it normal to get cramps like that during early pregnancy?      I'm supposed to start my period today or tomorrow, but there's no sign of it yet. Except maybe the cramping.         I wasn't stressing about being pregnant or anything. Just excited.      I thought for sure I was pregnant. But maybe I was wrong? Does this mean I'm not pregnant? AF? :(         What do you think?   Advice or Help would be appreciated :)   Thank you.

I know there are a million questions with the same type of scenario, but I can't seem to get an answer that pertains to me.      I am 21 turning 22 soon. I have always been overweight. Right now I am around 340lbs.   My period has never ever been regular - Usually I have at least a little bit of a period even if it is just spotting up to uncontrollable bleeding.   My fiance (getting married in July) and I have been trying to get pregnant for a couple of years to no avail. (We don't use any type of protection)   The last time I had any sign of any period was probably about 3 weeks ago. I know that's not a long time for everyone, but like I said, I usually have my period every day for months at a time.   About 2 weeks ago while driving home I felt violently sick to my stomach and again the next day or two - I didn't actually throw up, but felt like I was about to.   Since then I have been very tired, my breasts are sore and itchy and my skin is very dry (mostly on my stomach and my legs). Every once in a while I do feel a little sick to my stomach again.  I have been quite constipated for the last 3 weeks and probably am only going to the bathroom once or twice a week.      Is it possible I could be pregnant? I know it is too early to take a home test - when do you suggest I should take one? With my periods being soo very random I don't know when I should be doing this.      Thank you so much for your help. I know a million people have asked the same question in a million different ways.

The court ordered him to do anger management classes in order to have visitation rights. I have never let him take her alone because he was very abusive towards the end of our relationship. He has not seen her in over a year, doesnt call and i dont get any child support from him. My fiance and I will be getting married this fall, and he wants to adopt her. He has been in her life consistently and is amazing with her. We are expecting our first child in June. I do not want to give my daughter the illusion that he is her father, she will always know she another father...      What is the process that I would have to go through in order to make this happen?

My youngest brother (13) is SO lazy when it comes to household chores. I go to my mom's house every day to help them out with things like doing some housework, getting their bills together and sent off and cooking dinner sometimes for them to help because my step father has cancer and isn't doing well right now. The problem is, my brother absolutely will NOT lift a finger. My mother gives him direct instructions, "Help your sister please, she can't do this by herself." but as soon as she walks out the door, he lazes around on the computer or in front of the television, while I'm doing all these things along with watching my 10 month old. I know I'm only his "older" sister and all, but to some extent he's under my supervision while my mom is out and I do feel like he should obey me to a degree when I ask for his help. What can we do to get him to help? Or better, what can I do to show that he should listen and help me with things that HAVE to be done in the house?....It's his parents' fault for not getting him to participate in any type of chores and hopefully he'll grow out of it, but I need some advice. What can an older sister do to motivate her younger brother to help out? Without sounding bossy or "I'm older than you, do what I say!"

This is her first baby and I've been so supportive throughout her whole pregnancy. It was decided when she got pregnant that I would throw her shower.      Now, after spending a FORTUNE on plane tickets, and will be spending a ton more on food, beverage, decorations, etc (there're over 50 people on the guest list) she tells me she is having another shower for 3 weeks before the one I've been planning.       I feel so deflated! I've spend so so SO much time and money and all that effort for nothing. It wasn't even her first shower. When I told her I was hurt, she got defensive and said her friend forced her to have another shower.      I have no motivation to continue planning, or even to take my trip instead of cashing in my tickets for somewhere else.      Am I completely wrong for feeling hurt and angry?

20090202141336AAUM4wF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Am I just making a Mountain out of a ant hill?	So I became a vegetarian again, which I tried many times before but had to stop because of my mom not being supportive and just buying meat products.   So I started again, because I just want to do it for me and finally stick with something.   I've been wanting to do this ever since I was very young.   But now I asked for something to eat since I haven't eaten something except small snacks in almost two days now. But my mom refuses to help me out, she thinks being a vegetarian means you eat nothing but salads and my brother thinks I'm doing this because its what everyone in my school is doing (which is not true there is only like five people not including the people never eaten meat because of religious reasons) and I just feel like I have no support. Not only that my brother has been harassing me about it.       I'm also not doing this just because I feel bad about the animals I have other reasons to like, maybe I can finally do something without feeling like a failure which I have felt like in my short time of being alive.      Do I confront them of being not supportive of my decision?   Am I just being a drama queen?   I'm hopelessly confused right now.      Oh and by the way my brother knows how my my is not supportive, and use to go through mental break downs cause of her and I was  and still am very supportive of him.   But now isn't he doing the same thing as my mother did?         Thanks for reading and if you did answering.      (Don't be rude, that just makes you look like a jerk).

20090202173151AAp1iPI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why does my 13 mo old have diarrhea?	My son has had diarrhea for the last 36 hours. Yesterday he had about about 2 really full diapers and 4 small ones, about the same today.      I've heard that babies can get diarrhea when their canine teeth erupt, is that true? I know he's getting his lateral incisors on the lower (the teeth right next to the center ones), but I don't see any redness or anything where his canines should be.      Nothing in his diet has really changed. He's usually a really good eater and the last few days he hasn't been excited about eating as he usually is and has only been wanting his bottles instead of solid foods.      His temperament is normal, just a little fussier because his lil hiney is turning red. I'm keeping him really hydrated... But what's going on?

20090202143622AAu6vMI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Women only...Am I pregnant? ?	I got my last period in December (I can't remember the exact days but it was like after the 18th and before the 25th and lasted 3-4 days). Today is the 2nd of February and yesterday, I got what I am guessing is called "spotting". Blood came out when I peed but it was light red with a tinge of pink, and nothing like period blood (dark and clotting). I got spotting twice yesterday and haven't had it since... yet I haven't gotten my period since December either. I have not had cramps but I do admit I feel like I have nausea (suggestion or real? haha). Took a pregnancy test today and it came back negative...    Am I? Could I?     I am going to test again by the end of the week if I don't have my period by then, but has anyone else experienced spotting or negative test results because of low hormones? Just want to know I'm not the only one out here experiencing trouble.    Thanks for your time!! and wish me and my husband good luck =)

All of a sudden she hates going to sleep there and wants to go to sleep on her couch in front of the TV. Once she gets onto her couch she goes to sleep perfectly.

20090202172243AAQqKhi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of using a girl's middle name as her common name?	Basically, my friend is pregnant and we're going over names.  She wants the name to "flow"... and I agree that is an important thing.  Her favorite name is Cerys (its a Welsh name, pronounced kare-iss), but all the names she wants to go with it flow better with Cerys as the middle name.        Example, she is thinking Cerys Esme (pronounced ez-mee)... but she prefers Esme Cerys.  The same for Vivienne (a family name).  Vivienne Cerys is preferable to Cerys Vivienne.       I have told her that I think its perfectly acceptable to name her Esme Cerys and have her go by her middle name.  I know its reasonably common with males, though I've never heard of doing that purposefully with a girl.  Still, I think its fine.        What are your thoughts?

20090202142218AAXwOKj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I find myself wanting a baby?	I am getting married in 2 months and am 25.  My fiance and I have been together for 8 years though (high school sweethearts) and both want to be young parents, so we've talked about starting a family soon after our wedding.  Although I absolutely love to travel (and usually do so about 3-4 times a year) and still have a lot of career goals to accomplish, I find myself wanting a baby more and more lately.  I'm not the maternal type, so this is a surprising development to me. Is it normal to have doubts but at the same time really want to become a mother? I take this decision very seriously because there is no turning back. I would have to go off the pill in order to get pregnant so it would definitely have to be a conscious decision on both of our parts.      Is it a normal development to get baby fever right around the same time as you get married?  We're young, so it's not like my biological clock is ticking or anything, and I am afraid that a baby changes everything and there is no turning back.  Is it normal to have doubts and yet really want this to happen?

Also i have been experiencing spurts of fatigue and hunger, also some constipation and i have no idea if that could be a symptom of implantation or not so i would really love any advice!

Ok....this is a first time for me....I'm just 11 dpo...I have a LP of 14 days....I generally spot on 13dpo and start on 14....or sometimes I spot and start on 14 dpo.   I just had spotting ...just now!  And it's just 11 dpo!  Now you might say that this cycle I might have ovulated 2 days earlier....but no...that's not possible....because this month I had a monitored cycle with ultrasounds almost every other day....    I got a + OPK on Jan 22nd.  I got a vaginal U/S done that day and  also got a blood test done the same day and the doc said the results look good and indicates that I'm soon gonna ovulate.  Ok...now lets say I did ovulate on Jan 22nd....I will be 11 dpo today.    For the past 2 days, I've been feeling hungry (which I sometimes do before AF), very tired and sleepy.    Is it possible that the spotting is just implantation spotting?  Or do you think I'm soon gonna start my periods?    Does it happen this late?

The three of them talk together like they are the best of friends.We've known him for about two months since we've moved Into this new neighborhood he lives alone and seems really friendly but I think he Is a little immature for his age and always talking to the neighborhood girls. He recently just asked my daughter If she and her friend would like to join him for a night out this saturday to see a movie with him and then for a bite to eat afterward. I understand they all have become good friends but I still don't know If I want my daughter and her friend out with a 25 year old man. She says he's really fun and cool to be around and she really wants to go because she doesn't have anything planned that night. I don't usually trust just anyone until I get a chance to know them first. But I find It suspicious that he only seems interested In these girls and I'm not sure If I should let my daughter go or not. Should I just give them a chance?

Admittedly saying that my husband can talk for england and if the baby does recognise him it will prob think "does my daddy ever shut up"      This may sound a silly q but i just wasn't sure if the baby will know who he is whilst its in my tummy as he has not been there all that long.      He will be back when i am 25 weeks.

The only problem is I'm due March 4th :( I can't risk my babies health and get it pulled and they won't put anyone under due to the risks to the baby. But I have also been told that after I have the baby I will need quite the while to recover (C-section is going to the top option my doctor said). I'm wondering what I should do so that I can give my little one the nutrients he needs while he is still inside my body and what I should do about my tooth. I've already waited a month and it only gets worse. I want to feel comfortable after having my child. What should I consider?

My son is five months old and he has been having problems with his belly button leaking for so long.  a month ago he had surgery because they found that the problem was that he had a Rachael cyst. after two weeks it started leaking AGAIN. I have to go to another city that is four hours from where I live because I live in a small city. So we went last week and the doctor told us  that he had another cyst and he needed surgery again.  I am so sad and scared because the first  time he had surgery it was so hard, he can't eat for six hours and its just really hard not feeding him when he wants to.  Has anybody gone through this or heard of something like this? I just need some support.

My moms friend and her daughter are here 24/7, when I wake up, when I take a shower, when I have my dinner. and its driving my crazy, I can't even remember the last time I bonded with my mom alone, I can't even remember the last time our family had a family meeting. honestly, my moms friend and her daughter are here all the time, they might as well live here. they eat dinner at our house every night, and they snack a lot, especially the daughter. even my dad said they should be putting some money in the shopping because they eat most of it. my aunt was other the other day and she said to me "GOSH AREN'T THEY LOUD PEOPLE, I'VE NEVER HEARD A FAMILY TALK SO LOUD!!!" they're here so much that the daughter comes grocery shopping with us whilst her mom stays at our home. she sits on our kitchen worktops (gross! even I don't do that) they lye down on our sofas. they go threw the cuboards. they've seen my mom and I have terrible arguments and I can barely talk to my mom BECAUSE THEY'RE HERE!!! How can I? and worst of all they talk a lot about other people to us so I KNOW the woman is talking about me to people....  and the daughters always comes in my room in the mornings and wakes me up.. I wake up anyway because they;re so loud. my mom hasn't been out for so long because if she wants to go somewhere they're here so how can she go out?    my dad buys them pizza, chinese food, ect and they give no money to it. they even do laundry at our house.  and when we have had IMPORTANT visitors over they've been here everytime so my mom can't even hardly talk to the visitors alone, like last week my moms sister flew in from london (to california, were we live) and they were here, and my dads dad came over and we hadn't seen him in 4 years and they were here. and my dads 3 aunts came over and we haven't seen them in VERY long and they were at our house at the time. its crazy.    any body ever been through this before???! how did you deal with it? the women doesn't seem to think its wrong to be here all the time.

I do daycare out of my home and I have a father that comes and picks up his one year old daughter and four year old son. When he gets here he automatically goes to his one year old and picks her up. His son then tears up my house and acts like a monster. He isnt that way during the day but turns when his dad gets here. This has been going on for months. He hits my six year old and pushes him. I have told the child to stop and the dad just tells him " dont do that. " On friday my husband witnessed this behavior for the first time since he was off. The child picked up our power wheel and dropped it and then was pushing my six year old again. My husband came storming out of the house and told the father that his child will not be riding in that anymore. He also told him that he needs to control his children. Now he didnt do it in a nice way he was very angry when it was said.       I have been trying to do different things for pick up time and venting to my husband. So he just lost it and decided to speak up. Now you can only guess that the dad was angry and likes to blame my children for his child's behavior. He said he learned it somewhere.       What do you think with this situation?

20090202174402AAcniNo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My 14-year-old friend wants to have a baby. How can I tell her this won't help without sounding uncaring?	My friend doesn't want a baby just to have one. She isn't treated too well at home. Her parents scream at her and put her down 24/7. They call her horrible names. She also has a younger sister and brother (they're 1 and 2 years under her) who are very spoiled and treat her the same way. She gets blamed for anything they do, even if she's not there. Her parents even treat her like Cinderella (Seriously, they make her clean, cook and dress like a maid). To put it simply, my friend is treated like dirt. Not only has she told me this, I've been to her house and seen it happen. I don't think I can really do anything to help her (I'm only 14 as well). But because of that, she feels unloved and she wants a baby because she wants someone from her family to love her too (Her parents, brother and sister are the only family she has). She sees parents with their children (small and kids our age) and, in her eyes, the children seem enjoy being with their parents. I don't know what I can do. I can't do much to help her, but I can try to talk her out of trying to have a baby. But I don't know what to say.

I'm ttc and this is the first day of my missed period and still a negative hpt. I took the hpt this afternoon about 4:30pm. Could it be that my urin was too diluted to test positive?

I just want    to know what percentage of woman who didn't get a positive hpt untill days after their missed period. I have no cramping or feeling of my period comming on. I only have extremely light brownish streaks when I wipe. Any one experience this before and was actually pregnant? Did you have any discharge at all or were you completely dry ?

She had her first ultra-sound where she was told she looks more like 6 weeks pregnant then was told she was having twins! Which we were all amazed with cause she is my twin and it is rare for twins to have twins isn't it? Anyway she went to the doctors again to be told she had a blighted ovum. She and her partner as well as myself are devestated to hear about this. My question is, her partner smokes dope everyday. Can this be the reason why? What affects can marijuana have when it comes to pregnancy. My sister has never touched it and I think her partner has done it for a few years now.      Is it likely that she will miscarriage again?

20090202180552AAXl9bY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is This An Eptopic?? Please Help..Need Advice!!!! ?	This past Friday I was "supposedly" 7 weeks pregnant. Friday evening I started seeing some pink in my cervical mucous (when I wiped). There were a couple of occasions there was bright red blood when I wiped. Saturday I started bright red spotting in my underwear and bright red blood when I wiped. It got a heavier all Saturday (but not where it was bad that I had to change a pad very often). It was a mimic of the first day of my period. I had some very mild cramping on and off on Saturday (in my abdomen area). Sat evening the mild cramping stopped and I have not seen it since.       I have contiuned to bleed since Saturday. Today it's Monday and it's a bit less than Saturday, but still bright red. Last night I passed a big clot when I wiped and just before I passed another big clot when I wiped. It also looked like something was in the clot....maybe the embryo???       I had an abdominal and vaginal ultrasound today. It showed that NOTHING was in my uterus. They said it all it showed was how my uterus would look during my period. I also went to the lab tonight to have my blood drawn and levels checked. I won't get those results until tomorrow morning. My doctor wanted to make sure it wasn't an eptopic pregnancy.      I honestly feel great. I just feel like I am having my normal monthly period (with the exception of the clots). I never felt pregnant this entire month. Aside from the missed period and several positive pregnancy tests... I would have never imagined I was pregnant. I never had one symptom.      I took another pregnancy test tonight and it was positive WTF????? I am nervous my doctor is going to tell me this an eptopic. Can it really be one?? Wouldn't they have seen it on the ultrasound?? Wouldn't I have pain?? Would I be passing big clots and what looked like some of the embryo?? If there is nothing in my uterus what can be going on???? Any advice/answers would be great!!!      Would a pregnancy test still be positive if there is just a very low amount of HCG in me??       Please help.... I am SO confused and I honestly just want this to be all over with!!!      Thank you!!

I just had emergency surgery 4 days ago because i had an ectopic pregnancy that was rupturing so they had to go in right away and remove my entire right fallopian tube, i was 2 months along. So starting yesterday, besides all the pain, i started to vomit a little and bleeding a whole lot, like 3/4 of a cup full of blood each time i pee, and im very light headed and unable to eat. And sometimes i'd find myself asleep without realizing it. I called and spoke to my OB/GYB nurse and she said she'll call me back tomorrow to see if i should get blood work done. She did say go to the ER if i feel i need to go. But how normal is all this? Should i worry? I know i was going to bleed but this bad?! and these terrible symptoms? Thank you.

20090202181809AAu2mFt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Concerned about Birth Control?	Well, heres a long question/story but I would like some opinions on this. Around christmas, I had sex but the condom broke. I was pretty worried that I was pregnant, but I went to my gyn and she gave me a pregnancy test and it came out negative. I was put on birth control and I have been on it for almost a month now. I had my period, around January 20th and it ended around January 27th. I had sex with my boyfriend.. unfortunately, unprotected on the 30th. This was with me being on birth control for three weeks. Im just concerned because I have this irritating bulge underneath my belly button, and it has never been there before. Its kind of worrying me.. and im not sure if its because the effects of the pill or if I could possibly be pregnant. I know it cant show signs of the other night.. but from around christmas time. If anyone has any opinions please help me out.. Im just confused. Believe me.. after this, there is definitely no more sex for a LONG time. Its totally not worth it. I actually have a picture, to show you what im talking about. Please dont make a comment saying im "just fat" or anything like that. It wont help me at all if you are just here to insult me. Thanks! :)        http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v352/h...       theres a picture, it probably doesnt help, but Im just concerned on what it might be. :) Thank you again.

20090202182122AALHlPL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Home pregnancy test confusion, please help.?	I hope someone will have some advice on this situation because it has me very confused right now.  I was due to start my period yesterday and my period is always right on time, if not a few days early.  So I missed my period, and I knew it was a possibility that I was pregnant because my husband left on deployment a couple weeks ago and we did not use any birth control the week or so before he left.  I went to the drug store and got a pack of First Response pregnancy tests.  I took one yesterday and got a VERY faint positive line, so I waited another day (this morning) and used the first morning urine to take the 2nd test.  I got another very faint positive line, even a little more faint that yesterday's line, possibly.  My period is still not here, so I decided to go get the Clear Blue Digital tests since they straight out say "pregnant" or "not pregnant."  I took one of those as soon as I got back from the store, around noon today, and it said "pregnant."  I told my best friend and she asked me if I took a second digital test since the first two First Responses were rather inconclusive, and I hadn't so I decided to take another one since they came 3 to a pack.  Well I just took the second test and now it says "not pregnant."  The same test just said "pregnant" 8 hours ago!  I really cannot figure this out, I am following all the directions correctly, but neither of the tests seem to really be conclusive.  I know I need to just go to my doctor's office for a test, but right now its obviously too late for that and I would really like to know something so I can tell my husband, I hate not knowing what is going on!  Has anyone had any similar experiences or know why this could be happening and getting two different responses on the same test on the same day?

I am a 13 year old girl and just started babysitting. I am neighbors and friends with the family and live only a few houses down. (The three kids are siblings.)

20090202182920AA73EBr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the possibilities of pregnancy?	A couple nights ago I had sharp pain about where my ovaries would be. It hasn't happened since then however except maybe a tiny hint of it if my dog steps there or something. I also have been excessively hungry the past week and half- two weeks. It's typically normal for that to happen once a month but generally for only one week. Other than that, there's no other signs. My breasts are slightly tender, but only when I push on certain areas and only when it's me, so that might just be me tricking myself. I don't know. What are the possibilities though that I might be pregnant?      ***Please don't tell me to take a test or wait until my period. I need real answers.

20090202123108AAIoBf3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PREGNANT OR AUNT FLOW? *Help please*?	Hi everyone!    I ovulated on Monday January 19th. And had intercourse the 18th (day before), 15th and the 13th.  All last week I thought I was having pregnancy symptoms. My breasts were heavy, a little swollen, and a little sore. I had some nausea, and a little cramping.    I've also been keeping track of my BBT, and before I ovulated it was anywhere from 96.2 - 96.8. And now its anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7. I've been surprised to see it at 97.9 for a few days.    Normally I dont get nauseated or swollen/tender/heavy breasts before my period. Just some usual cramping.    The past 3-4 days now, I have not had sore breasts at all. I was a little nauseated and light-headed this morning tho. I also had killer cramps this morning too. I had to take some Tylenol to ease the pain.  Is it normal to get cramps like that during early pregnancy?    I'm supposed to start my period today or tomorrow, but there's no sign of it yet. Except maybe the cramping.      I wasn't stressing about being pregnant or anything. Just excited.    I thought for sure I was pregnant. But maybe I was wrong? Does this mean I'm not pregnant? AF? :(      What do you think?  Advice or Help would be appreciated :)  Thank you.

20090202130410AANnDxa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	For those who had a scheduled c-section, how long were you in the OR?	My sister in law is in the hospital right now, she was scheduled for a c-section  at 1:30.  I still haven't received any word.  I'm worried.  I'm stuck at home because the kids and I all have colds and we don't want to get the baby ward sick at the hospital.        Additional information includes that the baby will be almost 10 days early because he's already estimated to be 11 pounds. The new mother's pelvic bones split some time ago and she had major swelling 'down there'.      Her mom is in the hospital with her and I've called both of their cell phones, but no luck reaching anyone.  Do c-sections usually get into the OR on time? How long before everything is settled down enough to call and let me know what's going on?

I take my prenatals everyday, is it nessecary to take this B6 vitamin too? I know it can not hurt, but did anyone take both? I remember her telling me before that she thinks she is "allergic" to prenatals so I'm thinking maybe this is why she was taking the B6? I know extra B6 can help with morning sickness, but fortunately I am not experiencing that any longer! Any information?
20090202190432AA7LWD7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has any one ever read when i was garbage and what do u think of this womans story?	if not here it is sorry its long but what do u think of this story          When I was Garbage   by Allison Crews   Last year, when I was in 10th grade, I skipped a week of school. I was too scared, too humiliated, too sick and weak to leave my house. A week away from school earned me two weeks of "in-school suspension." Ten full school days I had to sit in a boxed-in desk, in a 6-by-20-foot room. Yellowing posters of needles and bottles of beer proclaiming "JUST SAY NO!" hung crookedly on the walls. I was allowed to go to the bathroom only twice daily, for 15 minutes. When you are five weeks pregnant, 30 minutes a day is hardly adequate for throwing up.   I sat at my desk, 15 years old, failing in school, pregnant, sick and terrified. I sat at my desk, rubbing my still-flat stomach and clenching my jaw tightly to hold down my vomit. "Two more hours and I can throw up," I reassured myself. I replayed the moment of truth in my mind millions of times during those two weeks. The moment I saw the second line appear on the pregnancy test stick. POSITIVE. POSITIVE. POSITIVE. But from that moment on, I wasn't positive about anything. Except the fact that I needed desperately to vomit. I wrote furiously in my blue velvet covered journal, tearing the pages with my Hello Kitty pen and smearing the ink with my tears. Fantasies of virgin-white wedding dresses and sponge painted nurseries unfolded on those blank pages, in the brief moments after bathroom breaks, when my fears were purged and flushed away. Incoherent poems and pessimistic single line entries poured out during the rest of the long days. Many pages read only "NO!" in bold letters, traced over and over, the impressions appearing on the next several pages.   I remembered facts I had learned as a freshman in "sex-education" about teenage pregnancy. Teenage mothers are a burden to society. The children of teenage mothers inevitably become crack-addicted gang members. Teenage mothers never successfully complete high school, let alone attend college. These weren't just statistics, I was led to believe, but invariable truths. I had become garbage, worthy only to sit in my isolated desk and cry to myself and throw up in a dirty bathroom stall. I was a pregnant teenage girl.   After my two weeks of suspension, I forced my pregnancy to hide in the depths of my mind. Thoughts of my future and of becoming a mother all but disappeared, forced to linger with memories of childhood and homework assignments. It was forgotten. My boyfriend and three friends who knew of my pregnancy assumed I would abort. I was not the type of girl who becomes a mother. Months began to pass, and the only sign of pregnancy were my swollen breasts and an infrequent fluttering in my belly. These signs, undetectable to anyone but myself, dredged up the fears that I thought I had buried so well. I was actually pregnant, I began to realize again, more clearly than I had since those two weeks I had spent in isolation, with only my thoughts and my morning sickness. I continued to hide my pregnancy, even as it became more and more obvious.   School was dismissed during my sixteenth week of pregnancy. My boyfriend and I were engaged in another vicious, mud-slinging fight. He threw the lowest blow. At the time I was so enraged and angry that I could not imagine a more evil act being committed. He told my parents I was pregnant. I realize now what an amazing thing he did for me, although his intent at the time was only to cause me pain. My pregnancy was real. Not only to me, but also to my parents, to my sister, to my relatives, to my newly appointed obstetrician. I was having a baby. There was no turning back. I watched a fuzzy little worm of a baby dance across a television screen, as I lay on a long sheet of wax paper, my stomach exposed and covered in chilled jelly. This was what had been causing me to vomit. This was what had been causing me to outgrow every bra I owned. This was what had caused me so much heartbreak and pain those first few weeks. What appeared to be a hand raised up, next to what appeared to be a head. "Hello mommy!" my 60-something year old OB said in a squeaky voice that I assumed was supposed to be a baby's. "I'm a baby boy." I realized then that this little worm that had caused my life to turn upside down in a matter of weeks was no worm at all. He was my son.   It was assumed my son would be given up for adoption, just as a few weeks earlier it had been assumed he would be aborted. I am not sure who made this decision. But it was not me. I wanted to be a good mother. My beautiful, fuzzy black and white son, who swam inside of me like a fish, deserved only the best. No mother under that magical age of 18 could provide that, and, being that I was only 15, I would have to let somebody else raise him. That was the 'right' thing to do. My boyfriend and I met with a lovely couple. A very rich, childless couple. While I enjoyed their company at dinner, and definitely enjoyed the food that th

I have a 10 month old that i have to chase around all day long and feed him and everthing  2.I am supposed to get an extra hour of rest during the afternoon but yet I can't get the father to get up so I can..he works from 4 pm till 2 am then comes home and stays up half the night.  3. recently i had a friend text him acting like someone else...needless to say they have been talking and he's been sending her pics of himself and texting her more than he will text me while he's at work...she forwards everthing..the only reason we did this is because he has randomly text women on 5 seperate occasions and was sending pics of his dick and **** to them...and around those times he wouldn't have sex with me ...later i found out why he was ejaculating to pics these women were sending him.  Being pregnant I crave sex like food.

I am pretty smart, but this year I have just been failing test after test. I don't know what's wrong with me!     Sometimes I tell myself it's just school and it's not going to ruin your life. My point of view on life is that you have a life enjoy it. Try to experience the life and have fun because your never going to be a teenager again and you have to make this the best time of your life. But then I know it's a little wrong to look at it that way, but sometimes I just want to forget school and do what I love doing! Being an actress, being the crazy me, write stories on end, outgoing, funny, being the star on my basketball team, hanging out with friends, helping other people and volunteering and doing everything I love doing best. I am also very thankful for being really pretty and one of the most popular girls at school and I feel like I'm wasting that too...    I know I have to focus on school too, but I can't. I hate it and the grades just put me down and tell me to not care, so that study less and less test after test. My parents aren't any help because they don't believe in what I believe in. They'll just tell me and make me study more.     I do want to do well in school but I also want to have fun and I feel like school is taking over my teenage/having fun life.     What do I do?

20090202191434AAM4kwp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding with bright red rash...?	I breastfeed and I have this horrible rash around my nipple. When I first noticed it a few weeks ago it was really itchy, and now it just burns. I cant even nurse for very long because it is so EXTREMELY painful. I am not sure if it is thrush. Doesn't the baby have to have it first? I thought he did cause I saw two little white spots on the inside of his cheek but they are gone now, but the rash on my nipples wont go away. Please help... it hurts to nurse but he absolutely will not take a bottle.

My son has gone from suffering bad constipation when solids were introduced to having what feels like a dirty nappy every hour - lol, ok  so its not quite that bad but he goes pretty much after every breastfeed and during every solid meal - we have to stop, change him & start again!      My mum said that's boys for you, but seriously, will it always be like this?      I was used to a breastfed baby who would go days between dirty nappies - I guess I didn't know my luck!

20090202185029AAL4Tv6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I was just told i have a thin lining. and i want to know who else is out there with the same thing?	I have been charting my cervical mucus and things to find when i was ovulating. It showed i ovulated actually 2 times this month, within a week of each other. - but others have said probably only one would survive if i did get pregnant.       But just after one ovulating tracking, i had an ultrasound for something else, and it did show that one follicle cyst (where your eggs mature from) come out of, had recently popped. and that there was another very mature follicle cyst. and by the end of the week I had the cervical mucus come back, so it was like ovulating again. which i thought was great!   but then the next week i saw my reproductive  endocrinologist for the first time, and she said that my lining was only 5 mm.       which apparently is thin... i didn't tell her about the ovulating. but she could tell that the 2nd follicle cyst had recently burst.    but she said that i would never get pregnant with that tin of lining.    some internet reading ive done said that others have. its not ideal that's for sure. but it could be worse.         Has anyone been in the same situation? know any help. its to late to make the lining thick right now. that's not an option
20090202184134AA21icJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it greedy if I miss my dad?	My parents divorced when I was like 1 1/2 and my mom married my now stepdad when I was like 2. I see my dad like once every other year or so. I really miss him, but I don't. It's like, I don't know him as a person, but I know that he is my dad. Make sense? IDK. Whenever I ask my mom if I can visit him she just says stuff like well you could IF he'd actually respond to my emails or IF he actually flew out here to get you. (I live on hawaii and my mom doesn't want me flying across an ocean and then across America to NC by myself). It's so hurtful. She just keeps nagging on him like "yah know, your dad never did this....or he would always do stuff like this....". I want to get to know my dad and decide what I think of him from my own opinions rather than my mom telling me things about him. I really want to see him and be with him. And it really makes me sad. I keep feeling bad for myself. But then I keep thinking about all "those kids in Africa" who don't have ANY parents and have to fend for themselves. Then that just makes feel "How lucky I am". I know there are people out there who have it WAY worse than I do. But I still miss him. I never talk about how I feel with my friends because I know that they might think "geeze, it's just divorce. Half of the kids at school have divorced parents". I don't know what to think. I always feel like I don't deserve to feel bad because I mean I should be feeling bad for those kids who don't have any parents. I don't know if I made any sense here.

And of course, I am very happy for them. But I am getting pretty irked about being single, especially with Valentines day around the corner...      so heres the deal:   Theres this guy, M, he's in my last class of the day at school so i'm really laid back in that class.    We talk sometimes, not alot at all, but he cracks up at my sarcastic remarks I am known for.    aaand, of course theres always a catch. Her name is C. So, C is one of those (no offense) preppy Oh-em-gee girls and she was pretending to be upset with M and she was all "I'm never talking to you ever again" etc and then later he said he was sorry and stuff and they hugged. I'm not sure I have ever been so jealous in my life! But I am quite sure C doesn't like him because she has a boyfriend but I'm not sure about him liking her...   gah i'm confused. just give me advice please...      thanks.

I first saw him when i was in grade 3 and he was in grade 5 we used to go to the same elementary school. But then in grade 4 i went to a different school. I then saw him next time when i was in grade 7 him in grade 9.       Well im now in grade 9 him grade 11. And as i was saying his sister my brother are on the same hockey team.      So whenever I am around him I just feel so amazing he is so sweet. He's super shy and quiet. I remember even in grade 7 him grade 9 when i went to my brothers hockey tournament and just seeing him and thinking how much i like this guy.      Anyways are parents are friends. And my mom thinks he's a really nice guy and last night she was like 'You know who's a nice guy Dylan when you start to date i want you to find a guy like him. I couldn't agree more with her.       He has such great eye contact and he's not super hot or anything just sweet looking! I think he's only had like one gf too.       We both are quiet people and like are time alone, but he is really funny like me.      And he's so sweet to his mom which i find very nice lol.       But why do i feel so i don't know different around him it's like the best feeling ever i just feel like im in love. I also feel that somehow we are going to end up together? Do you think it's possible that maybe i'm feeling this way because we are going to end up together.      Thanks      Oh and we Don't go to the same school.      also how do i keep in contact with him since i don't go to the same school?      and everything i do i think of him. I thought i really liked this other guy but i just don't feel the same as i do when i think of Dylan.

I have fallen in love with a certain name for our baby if it's a boy... I wanted to keep a "J" name as hubby, myself, and our son all have "J" names. Hubby doesn't really like it but he's a really good sport b/c he knows how much I LOVE it and is willing to go along with it. I told him we should both like whatever name we have, but he just seems passive about it and is like, whatever I like is okay.   My mom keeps pestering me about names... she knows we're going with "J" names and starts listing "J" names to me over the phone to see my reaction, and she said the one I love and basically said she hated it (I did not tell her that was the name... we are keeping it a secret). But it really upset me- I don't like the names she mentioned she liked, and I feel like this is MY baby and I should name him/her whatever I like, right? She even said recently she was worried about me naming the baby (if it's a boy) a "*****" name. That REALLY pissed me off when she said that, first of all b/c that is such an ignorant word to use (and she knows I have a lot of gay friends), and second, because I know she is talking about the name I like...   So did you guys run into this- where family members totally hated your name choice (whether they knew that was the name you were gonna use or not)? What did you do? I felt like the name was so special to me and now it's being ruined!!!

20090202123158AA5HTAB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm in a really sticky sitution with work and am stressing out!?	my future mother-in-law, was told to keep my pregnancy a secret until tomorrow but she decided it was her right to blab to everyone on Saturday.      so this not only spoiled what was meant to be the best time of our life telling all our friends and family (who knew before we got the chance) but it has really put me in an awkward situation at work.      I'm meant to be getting employed by the nhs this week, having been with them through an agency for 3 months hence the reason she was meant to shut her mouth.      Now the lady who is in charge of giving me the contract knows (i know this because her sister knows so its a given) and she's back at work tomorrow.      Now I'm stressing so much that she won't give me the contract and just say that its for another reason :(      I feel sick with nerves

20090202124854AAKc4wt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Depo side effectts or pregnancy?	i have been on depo since 1-10-09, and have recently been experiencing some side effects that could also be signs of pregnancy.  i am told some of these are common, but im not sure if they would have started immediately or if the timing lines up more with pregnancy?   they include:   nausea   headache   fatigue   hunger and thirst [followed by nausea once satisfied]   frequent urination, or feeling of need to urinate with little actual result.   bloody [for lack of a better term] boogers   back pain [which is a norm for me anyways]   sore breasts   acne   trouble sleeping soundly, but not falling asleep   general discomfort/ soreness   increased amount of discharge      i know most people say depo is effective immediately but i didnt recieve it during my period so i was supposed to wait a week.  we had sex after only 4 or 5 days, when i recently discovered i was likely ovulating.  my period is late by roughly a week, which is strange because my doctor said i should expect spotting throughout the month and a heavy period.  the information i was given says that the users period will only stop 50% of the time, and after a full year of use.  the pregnancy test they did before the shot was negative, and so was the one i took barely two days ago.  i have neither the time nor money to schedule additional appointments right now, but im obviously eager to know if this is pregnancy or just the depo messing with my body.  the test i used was an advantage brand test, any other suggestions on better brands?  and any information about similar depo situations or experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Ive just found out im 4 weeks pregnant (the father is ok with me being pregnant, so he says), I went for my first scan today to see how far along I was and to see if everything was ok. I wanted the dad to come, he was with his friend in the pub. I feel scared of making a big deal of it. He's not really reliable anyway, he was with a girl for 4 years and she cheated on him, since then, alot of people have said he doesnt trust women, and he doesn't like getting close to them. But I feel like I'm suffering for what she did to him, I didn't do what she did. Its making me so miserable. He's ruining it for me. Should I tell him this or not? I feel really down.

I'll be 14 weeks on Thursday,  I'm definitely starting to notice that my belly is getting rounder.  But, I can't tell if it's just me putting on weight or if it's actually a real bump.

During a routine ultrasound today (my wife is 13 weeks along), the Dr. became interested in the nuchal translucency (my wife is 35 at time of birth).

He told us he is not worried but just being precautionary.  Of course, my wife and I are freaking out.  Should we be?  What are our chances of a child with Downs?

There seems to be such concern over how upset i'll be since i'm unattached. Funny thing is, I couldn't care less right now.

Anyone else happily celebrating with their kids and getting strange reactions?
20090202193019AAaWYvO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Does this bother you?	A girl of 16 asked a question about the physical pain of losing your viginity, and if it can be avoided, So as the question asked I answered it. She asked for an answer to a question not to be attacked by a bunch of peoples morals on appropriate age for se. I understand people want her to understand to wait, but thats not what she asked.    Just things like that, like asking a particular question and being    bambarded with answers not relevant to the question, Ehh it just bothers me, she asked a question to learn and maybe she just wanted to be informed, I just dont get it, not every family is open to answering those types of questions so they seek elsewhere for knowledge, so why cant people stick to the question?      Id rather have them informed so they have a better understanding for their decision making.

20090202191807AAgxa2z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Partial Birth Abortion?	I dont get them. Why even bother? at that point the baby can be born. they should just have the baby, sure its a premie but at least it will have a chance, they could have the kid and leave it with the hospital       safe haven law (depending on where you live)

20090202192922AAQuYkE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What's your opinion on 13-15 year olds going on birth control?	I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with it. I mean if they want to have sex, then let them and if they want to prevent pregnancy-even better. I think its good they're being responsible and its a good thing. Some people call girls on birth control whores and stuff, they're just preventing pregnancy whats wrong with that?
20090202191924AAcG1Ac	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	A couple Ovulation questions ?	I had positive OPK results for two and a half days. When did I ovulate? is it 12 to 36 hours after the LH surge ended or when the LH surge started? Plus my last positive OPK was the 31st. Today is the second. I have been having pains in my lower tummy region, where I usually get menstrual cramps. What are these pains?
20090202192658AAlQ678	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	If you were a parent, how would you react if you found out your kid was smoking weed?	im a teenager lol, annnnd ive been in this situation before but thats not the point. i was just trying to figure it out from a parents situation. because like, of course i was telling myself weed isnt a big deal (i still dont think its a big deal) and that if my kids did it i wouldnt care. but then i started thinking if like, really, i wouldnt think it was a big deal. cus im thinking i actually would get mad at them. ughh idk, haha i was just wondering.      so i guess my question is would it matter to you if they smoked weed?      and also would there be a difference for you between a continual smoker and someone who it was their first try?      thaankkks.

20090202192657AADP30T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Anyone else feel the same way?	I have given this much thought and it will always be a debate, but teen mothers getting bashed is getting ridiculous. God knows I do not like to see 13-17 year olds getting pregnant because I remember what it was like to be those ages and taking care of a baby would have been so tough for me and it still is. It does bother me when some teens get pregnant and drop out of school and don't think they can have a nice life now that they have a baby. There are a lot of teen mothers I went to school with who are now almost finished with bachelor's degrees and manage children and a household. Not all young mothers fit the stereotypes and a lot of people need to realize that. I do have a hard time on here with not judging teen mothers just because I have seen what happens to a 13 year old pregnant girl and it just breaks my heart. However, I do think babies are wonderful blessings, I just can't help but feel sorry for the poor girls because they are just kids themselves. I can honestly tell you that the 20 years I have been on this earth, I am still not fully prepared as a mother, even with a small, unfinished college education. I work hard everyday to take care of my daughter, my fiance, and our house. I wish young girls would think of their futures and themselves more. Nothing is more important at that age as education. My parents enstilled that into my sister and I. Once I got into college, I had too much freedom and I got a beautiful daughter and amazing fiance out of it. I do not think I should be hated nor judged because I have a daughter 1)because I was a teen when I had my daughter and 2) I was not married. I was one of the lucky ones. I was in a committed relationship when my daughter was conceived and we are currently planning a wedding.     As for my question, I just wanted to see if anyone else agreed with me or was in the same situation, who can relate.     Personally, no matter what I think about teen pregnancy, it is always going to be an issue. I also wish a lot of people would not group all teen mothers into the stereotype that we are bad mothers and should be hated. It is just not right.

20090202191958AAvPq5w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Quick question for those who are already moms!?	At the beginning of pregnancy did you or could you have urinary tract infx symptoms? Like discomfort and slight burning? What about increased vag secretions? What EARLY symptoms did you most experience.
20090202192032AA4LjAK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Ugh. My mom teases me about my butt and I don't like it. What should I do?	My brother said something about me having a flat butt while he was over, while I was upstairs. My mom yelled my name for me to come down and she proceeded to humiliatingly laugh and point out that my butt "is like a shelf and you could put a drink on it". I feel so hurt because I am self conscious about my body and my mom just doesn't get it!! I'm not fat but I don't like it when she talks about my body rudely, or humiliates me like that..       What should I do??
20090202192112AABqG2f	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could this be it??? Please take the time to help a desperate lady! ?	Well we just entered the 12th month of TTC! About 3-4 days ago I noticed a VERY large amount of clear & white stretchy mucus when I went to the bathroom...tmi I know :-) I figured that was a sign that I was ovulating!       Well we had BD'd about 2 days before that, and the day of. It would seem our chances of conceiving are pretty good, but I know all about the statistics of when a woman can get pregnant.      Well since yesterday I have experienced the following things:   *Bloating   *Slight cramping   *Felt really wiped out yesterday and today.      I haven't seen any spotting, but the most unusual thing I have experienced since yesterday is sore Breasts. I haven't had sore breasts in about a year.      so what do you guys think? I know it's to early to take a test, but do those symptoms sound promising? I don't want to get my hopes up, but the sore breasts thing is really getting to me! Anyways thanks for your time and opinions!

20090202193004AAHD7no	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	If your baby is born before the baby shower...?	Should you still go on with the plans? My shower is planned for Feb 28th but there's a possibility of getting induced early due to high blood pressure. Ofcourse I just care that the baby will be ok but I still have the fact that all things are set for the baby shower in the back of my mind.
