20090205085257AAMmFu4	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Trouble with Facebook?	I have had Facebook now for about 5-6 months. When i first opened it, i had no problems but i didn't really go on it until like 3 months after. Now im totally addicted to it! but whenever i click on a picture in an album Facebook goes very very slow and takes ages to load and i have to re-sign in again everytime.      Its very impossible to add photos. None of my friends have this problem. I have had viruses cleared on my PC, and its now starting to do the same with my Bebo account.       But even now on Facebook, its starting to slow down after i join a band or even go back on to my homepage. what's wrong with my Facebook? does it do this to anyone else?      It cant be my PC, because i can re-click on my Google homepage and it comes up straight away, but if i stay on Facebook after it goes slow, it just comes up as 'error'. Is there a way i can contact Facebook? And will they make me open a new account if i do? which is what i dont want to do because it will still be funny if the problem isn't sorted.   Iv known Bebo to go funny sometimes, due to the page views, but it's fine now.      Oh and also, Facebook randomly signs me out now and again.

I just bought a VGA PC to TV Cable Kit so I can use my HDTV as a monitor for the PC.      However, upon plugging both ends of the VGA cable into my TV and PC, I get PERFECT picture quality.      I was also provided with a sound lead. One end has a single plug (3.5mm according to the website) and the other end has two RCA plugs. One Red, One White.      I was told to plug it directly into my soundcard (green hole at the back of the PC) Or the headphone socket at the front of my PC (green).      I plugged the two RCA plugs into the back of my TV - R and L?       & Still I am not getting any sound, just picture.      Does anybody know how to rectifiy this?      Thanks ever so much!

20090205085102AAxdL01	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Geforce 6800 GT questions?	My dad knows this guy that has been dealing with computers for over 15 years. I talked to him for a couple of hours and he said that this card ( geforce 6800 gt with 256mb) would be ample for what i want to do. I bought the game Deer Hunter Tournament and i wanted to play it with low or medium settings with not too much lag. He said that this card would do the trick. My computer specs are   Windows XP Proffesional   Drive C: 60gb   Drive D:30gb   2.53GHz   480mb of ram   Core Cell   And we also have an external hard drive of 500gb so memory is clearly no issue. I haven't received the card yet so i don't know what games this card is capable of playing besides what my dads friend told me. So my question is, do you think this card can play Deer Hunter Tournament? I was also thinking of getting Medieval 2 total war. Could this card handle that game too? From the research i've done, i've found out that even though this card is old, it's pretty powerful. So all i want to know is what you think of this card and if it's capable of playing the games i've mentioned? And one more thing, for those who have had this card what other games can it handle? Thanks in advance for your answers!

Also I tried renaming it but the computer doesn't recognise it as anything but just a File.  Any idea how to undo this and how this was caused would be a great help.

I've recently installed Vista, and the only driver that I managed to find for my soundcard is just that. With XP  I used to have bits of software with it, that I could use, such as EAX, settings, a mixer and an equaliser. They, Creative told me that they have no plans of making these for Vista, so I am left with a good soundcard that I can't get the best out of. Is there anything that I can download (preferably free) that can plug-in and let me change even the most basic things such as bass and treble?

I took my computer to another establishment and plugged the network cable provided by Qwest to another network and my computer was able to detect the LAN and establish internet connection.

20090205091852AA5WDa6	Computers & Internet;Software	Computer Software Question?	Hello all:      I am wondering if there is any Speech to Text computer software out there?

I know that I have speech recognition on the computer, but I am hoping to use the software to convert the speech from my voice recorder (which I use to record lectures from the classes that I am in).  Because it is not my voice or any one person's voice, then the speech recognition program on my computer is not going to help.  Any advise would be appreciated.  Thanks

20090205093526AAwMNwS	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Problems recording sound with computer?	I am having problems recording sound with my computer. I have tried using Sony Acid Pro, Sound Recorder, and recording videos with my webcam. I have tried recording on several different occasions over the past few weeks. I have tried both the built-in microphone and I tried plugging in my own microphone into the 1/8" audio input. In all of these instances, whenever I play it back the sound wavers in and out.    I have an HP G60-120US notebook with Windows Vista 32-bit OS, 3GB RAM, and an AMD Turion Dual-Core RM-70 2GHz processor. The microphone/sound card is Conexant High Definition SmartAudio 221 and my computer says that it is working.    I just bought this computer a couple months ago and it works perfectly for all of the other heavy duty work I do (video editing, gaming, internet, etc.). So I am hoping that this issue is fixable.    Thanks for your help!

I have a schedule and on this schedule I need to calculate the difference between two times, in military time, then subtract 1/2 for lunch, giving me the number of hours supposed to be worked.  Employees aren't scheduled everyday, these are rotating schedules.  On the days they aren't working, I need the display to show the value zero so it equals in my total column.  the column right now is showing a minus because of the lunch.  so can i put two formulas in one cell, one showing the difference in times and the value zero if applicable or is there an easier formula to show all of this?

So I'm getting a little frustrated, I bought a decent working secondhand computer a few months back, and it had a CD Burner on it. I was pretty siked, but then it didn't work. After opening it up I realized it was unplugged and it now opens and the computer reads it. But when I put a cd in to burn, it keeps giving me the message "please put in a blank cd". So what gives? I've checked the 'properties' and it says something like, "drive type: cd-rw", so I bought CD-RW cd's.. and I also have DVD-R and CD-R's. None of them will work. Can you please help diagnose the problem?

20080710003052AA7n3Dk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Hard drive problem?	Hey, I've been having a few problems with my hard drive.      Yesterday, I tried to access a standard PDF file (no viruses, I'm sure) and my computer suddenly decided to conk out. It was running fine prior to this, but as soon as I opened the file, it just froze.      I then restarted the computer, and was presented with a 'hard drive read error'. Figuring something funny was going on, I found that the hard drive enclosure was incredibly hot - far more than usual. I then left the computer for 30 minutes, and tried again.      This time it booted up (very slowly), but worked fine afterwards. However, about 4 hours of constant use later, the computer started stuttering. Switching between programs would take about 15 seconds, and the music which I was listening to began to stutter - I assume this is because it is not being read off the disk fast enough.      Anyway, I turned it off, and this morning I tried again - but, alas, after a long boot up, the stuttering is still there and it's just generally..

Says it worked fine for a couple of months then it makes a noise while playing a game and shuts off.  He had the side off; all fans working; none with bearing noise, same w/HDD's, etc.  Sure enough, when CPU usage goes up their is a mid-pitch squeal that comes from the general CPU area.  I pushed on the CPU heatsink support; no change.  After about 30 seconds of this, it will blank-out, no error.  Just like CPU overtemp.  It's an Athlon X2 5400+ or close.  Not overclocked at all.  I'm going to take it apart, check for thermal paste, maybe bent pins.  Any ideas?      CPU area squeals under heavy processor load.

A few days ago I got a nasty virus.  Up until now, I could still start up and use my computer, but today it wouldn't fully start up.  All I can see is my wallpaper and my mouse pointer.  The start menu is not there, none of my desktop icons are available, and I can't right-click.  When I try Ctrl+Alt+Del it tells me that my task manager has been disabled by the administrator.  I've read about some other people having this type of problem, but they were still able to access their task manager.      The earliest I can take my laptop in to get it fixed is this weekend, but until then, how do I turn off my computer??  If I hold the power button all it does is go into stand-by mode, then resumes on the same screen if I push it again.  If I pull the power supply it will use up the battery then go into standby mode, so that doesn't work either.  Please help!         Also, I have a Toshiba Satellite A105 notebook

Alternately, is there a hub that can receive wired runs from the computes but communicate wirelessly with another hub or router.      The reason I ask is because we've had a couple of network cables fail, but they are very difficult to access to run replacements.

Hers on the other hand stays in there SNUGLY. We are using the same charger, but different laptops. From the outside where the charger plugs into the laptops looks identical so I'm assuming it's an internal issue. Does anybody know if something came loose? Because new chargers are expensive- about $100.

When he went, I just quickly checked through his browsing history, and found out he has been on pornographic sites. Now my parents have told him time and time again to not go on it, but he never listens, cos he's a twat. Now I want to catch him in the act if he does it again, which is proving difficult. So, what I'm asking you is, is there a piece of software that will tell me if anyone on the family network goes on a pornographic site?

20090205104951AAebXIl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Geek squad just fixed my computer, and it's still broken.?	The geek squad guy literally left 30 minutes ago, and my computer still doesn't work properly. He changed the motherboard, power supply, and hard drive. He put the system to restore, with the operating system disk, and then left. After the restore was complete, it said to restart the computer. So i did, and it says some crap like "error cannot read disk, load operating system diskette" or something. I went to the bios and restored to default settings, and tried again. Same problem. When you start up the computer, it gives you the option to boot from disk, with a 5 second countdown, on that black screen. After the 5 seconds, I get that error message if I do not boot from cd. But booting from cd works fine. Maybe this is just some simple error on the configuration of new parts. Please  help.

I've tried all sorts of things, memory scan, memory tests, defrag.  It just gets stuck, the timer is still counting but it freezes. Is it possible I have a virus that's trying to protect itself? If so, how do I get rid of it, if AVG won't scan it.  Also I dunno if its related but when I plug in my phone it freezes the laptop. Last time AVG appeared to turn off? Glitches or virus or another problem? Any suggestions appreciated as it's starting to drive me a little insane :)

20090205103646AA0h8r5	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why does my Toshiba Satellite Laptop switch to the French characters?	My laptop will automatically switch to French characters.  I have tried just about everything to switch them back like left alt + shift and going into the regional language options and playing with that, but nothing works.  Just about the only thing that works is to restart my computer.  Some useful pieces of info could be that I'm using Vista and it's a Satellite L300 something or other.  The last time that it happened I was using Google Chat and I hit ctrl left a few times.  And now, I can't skip over whole words using this shortcut it just goes character by character.  Hope this information can help,  I'd really like another way to fix this other than restarting.  :)       Thanks!

I was working yesterday when all of a sudden this silver shield appeared with my other programs on my toolbar.  I've never seen this before, nor did I download.  It's called Spyware Protect 2009.  About every 20 seconds I get these pop-ups that interrupt my work.  A Windows Security Alert pops up from the silver shield and tells me that my "computer is infected.  Anitvirus software helps to protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.  Click here for the scan you computer.  Your system might be at risk now." And yes it says "for the scan you computer".  When I right click on the silver shield I cannot view the properties, nor can I find it on my add/remove programs.  Are there any computer techs out there that know what this is?  Do you know how I can get rid of it without have to download/buy a program?  I tried a free download of Ad-Aware, but it didn't help.

Okay, I might just be completely computer challenged, but I've been searching everywhere for some help with this and I still can't figure it out.      I'm having a problem exporting a finished video from iMovie to QuickTime. I've worked with iMovie before on my old computer; it was an older version (maybe iMovie 4?) and I never had any problems exporting it. However, ever since I got my new computer and therefore a new version of iMovie, whenever I try to export a video to QT the audio is missing, and some of the clips don't even show up; it's just white for a few seconds, and then shows the next clip.      I'm assuming that it's just compressing wrong, because when I used to export videos it would take 3-4 minutes, but now it takes "less than a minute", which would be nice if it actually turned out right. (And yes, the videos I'm trying to export now are about the same length as the videos I've made in the past, so I don't think it should compress that fast.)      Not only that, but when I try to export in Full Quality, it says that it can't because there is an "Unknown Error". I am so frustrated!! Can anyone help me?

Hi, I'm having (actually, I've been having for a while, but didn't care) problems with my PC's power supply unit. I first thought it's the ventilation and that the GPU was overheating. The first game on which I spotted a little slower FPS, (when rendering large structures, for instance) is Hitman Blood Money. I didn't see anything unusual when I was playing Call Of Duty 4 in spring last year. I played HBM in Autumn last year and then I saw it first time, but didn't care actually. Then I started noting the same thing at Call of Duty 5. But on Far Cry, at Very High settings I was having an unbelievable frame rate of 5-6 FPS. My configuration is:      -Intel Pentium D Dual Core 925 CPU, 3.0 GHz, 2×2 MB Cache   -2048 MB of RAM, 2 × Kingston 1 GB    -NVidia GeForce 8400 GS, 512 MB VRAM   -WD HDD, 160 GB   -1× DVD-RW   -3 fans   -ASUS P5VD-VM-SE Motherboard   -And the Power supply - 165 W! Yes, that's right, 165 watts.      So now you're probably wondering how may a GPU like that work on a so weak PSU, whilst requiring at least 350-400W. I've always thought that the PSU is the last thing I'll need to change, but now... it's the first thing to change, I guess. So, what do you suggest I do?

I have successfully connected my phone to my laptop many time in the past, but it stopped recognizing it yesterday. When I hooked it up, I got a message saying "One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows doesn't recognize it."    I unplugged it, and the message keeps popping up. I hooked up my iPod, and the computer synced just fine. I hooked my phone up to another computer, and that worked fine too. So it's not the phone or the cord, and it's not physical damage to my computer.   How do I get my computer to recognize my phone?

I use Virgin as an internet provider and am connected wirelessly through a netgear wireless card to the router which is directly below my room.A lot of the time though I have a really low signal, the internet drops out every 5 minutes or the speed alternates from 2.0mbps to 56.0mbps.I've tried moving my computer,the router and putting my wireless card in different positions and it doesn't make a difference.Ive been on Virgin before and lived in a house literally 3 streets away from where I am now and had no problems at all.Does this sound like a network problem or a router/wireless card problem?

20090202212715AA65kAc	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Your Laptop Keeps Freezing? ?	Hi, i just figured out myself why my laptop kept on freezing for the past week. It worked sometimes for 5-15 mins, even on safe mode i couldn't enter. I had to try to figure myself quickly how to solve this. I finally realized that i had broken registry files and other files. I downloaded a lot of programs , like spyware terminator, registry cleaner, eunsing free registry cleaner, glary registry cleaner but it did not work. Whenever i tried to run defrag on safe or normal mode, it would always freeze until i found out about smart registry defrag. I finally managed to boot up safe mode or with networking and ran my smart registry defrag with optimising for couple of hours , and after that restarted the computer let the computer restart.    Also try getting Revo Uninstaller, and get rid of broken files/folders , it actually works great!!!! I have a toshibal l300, a brand new laptop and i finally found a way to fix the laptop freeze

When I got it back i knoticed a few programs that were new and that I myself never installed. Adobe Dreamweaver was one of them. I have reason to believe that he pirated it. I asked him about it and he just said that he downloaded it, but when I opened my download folder i knoticed a keygen and a readme file that tells you how to use it and where to install a crack for the full version of adobe dreamweaver. what can i do to get this off my computer. There are also files in my download folder about utorrent is this illegal? I am quite computer expierienced so when it comes to computers i am not completely dumb but i am retarded when it comes to downloads and deleting (illegal) stuff from my computer.      Long question short: how can I delete illegal pirated material/programs from my computer with no trace aka bread crumbs?         Please do not hesitate to get into detail. or post links to software vendors that can do this, or reviews or forums that can give me detailed instructions.      Also please be respectful honestly. if you dont know anything about this question or dont know how to answer it dont leave an answer.      Best answer gets 10 points.      Thank you in advance :D
