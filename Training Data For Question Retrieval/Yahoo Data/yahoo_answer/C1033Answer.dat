Mc1ZRgpiaa	Well Work On Your Jumps And If You Want You Can Work On Flexibility. Make Sure To Learn The Routine And Timeing, If You Don't Want To Look Bad, Then Being A Second Behind Will Be Bad. Don't Be Nervious At Try-Outs, You'll do Great. Cheerleading Is The BEST.|`|GpqwivnJaa	Cheer leading is so much fun once you've learned the basics. Stretch and try to get your basic jumps down--such as the toe-touch, left and right herky, and the hurdler. Practice in front of a mirror and do it over and over. Also, have fun at the tryouts and the judges will see that. If you mess up, keep going and keep smiling. Don't sweat it. Also- remember to keep everything sharp and neat- not sloppy. You'll do great!

San Fransico 49ers - Was having numerous winning seasons thanks to Garcia (QB) T.O. (WR) and the legendary Jerry Rice (WR). But as soon as they have a bad season he quits and accusses Garcia of being gay.<br>  <br>  2.) Philidalphia Eagles - Amazing him and McNabb a match made in heaven. He went to a Super Bowl w/ them. But when they lost the SB against the Pats by 3 points! (23-27) He quits calls McNabb a healthoholic and disses the whole Eagles roster. And to this day if Owens stayed w/ the Eagles he would have AT LEAST 2 Rings because this year the Eagles would of beat the Cardinals and went to the Superbowl and the Eagles beat the Steelers that same season 31-3 or something like that.<br>  <br>  He's not the only one to get the blame. The whole team is garbage. They had good individual players but when you put them together... uggh (ex. Demarcus Ware (LB) Pacman Jones (CB/DB) Mariam Barber (RB). <br>  <br>  Not to mention that the Cowboys owner (Jerry Jones) is an ***. <br>  <br>  Oh and Romo is a Homo|`|VEj7cQWHaa	He was such a huge distraction when they went 13-3<br>  <br>  He had nothing to do with SF's problems he left as a free agent because SF took to long to trade him.

Hope he finishes his career there, cause if he screws this up- NO one will want him and his "Me first" mentality.<br>  <br>  As an aside... how do you think a QB is supposed to function when the jack@ss is b!tching and whining to get him the ball in every huddle, regardless of what the QB sees?  How can you run an offense when you're always trying to please one guy, and that guy is never satisfied with his opportunities?  He would've had more catches if it weren't for the fact he drops so many... Makes me think he is the Paris Hilton of the NFL- if it weren't for the fact he made his "personality" so large and forced everyone's hand into throwing the ball to him so much (which no one should ever give in to), no one would know who he is.  It's a d@mn shame he didn't learn anything about class from Jerry Rice while he was in SF.|`|jIONJZSJaa	Discipline was the problem.  And T.O. was at the heart of it.  He was starting to divide the locker room.  Just like he did in San Francisco and in Philadelphia.  Nobody will ever question his talent.  He is a great player, but a poor teammate.  Its his personality and his attitude that constantly gets him in trouble.  If you don't believe what people here say about him, then pay attention to all the other teams that wanted nothing to do with him.  When 3/4 of the league don't want anything to do with him, the problem isn't the teams, the problem is him.|`|RS3fjNboaa	And you act like he's the best thing that ever happened to the Cowboys. He got so bad he wouldn't even tell Romo where he would be on a called pass play. And you want to say he wasn't a problem? He also divided the locker room. There's your discipline problem. Nobody ever said TO was the only problem, but he sure was a big one. TO's bandwagon just left for Buffalo.

XLXncQu9aa	The news about the Redskins signings is old news.  However I am a bit surprised about the Bills picking up T.O.  Two things are apparent.  The first is Drew Rosenhaus wasted no time getting T.O. signed which mean he gets money if T.O. is signed and is happy.  The second thing is that T.O. was obviously wanted in Buffalo.  The Bills do need a WR and I think T.O. will fit in nicely for now.  It all depends on his attitude and how he works with his team mates.  But one other thing is apparent.  He was signed to a one year deal worth $6.5 million.  Now the thing that sticks out to me is the one year deal.  He only gets one year, which means if he doesn't improve his attitude within that one year, he will be terminated again.  But I believe $6.5 is too much for him.  He should have been paid at least $2 million.  Talent wise he is worth it, but attitude wise and as a person he isn't.<br>  <br>  And also you were wrong.  T.O. wasn't traded he was released.  You obviously didn't get the memo on that.  And Suisham signing a 22 year deal?  That would never happen.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	Was Kobe part of the deal??|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	That's pretty funny...but you can't lead off with them trading their 1st round pick in this year's draft when they don't have one.  Detroit has it from the Roy Williams trade.  And it is impossible to sign someone to a 22 year deal.  It's against the league mandated rules and is illegal in the current cba that expires after 2010.<br>  <br>  Nice try though.<br>  <br>  Did you see the article a few years back where the Yankees had decided to sign every major league baseball player...It was classic.|`|msxGICJvaa	And your point?|`|J9GWbyAvaa	Nice.<br>  Suisham is a MVP in the making.

mr0Hb5fvaa	most teams don't require experience. there are usually novice teams, which is a good way to start college rowing, especially if you come from a small team. it is good that you will already know the basics, but most teams also have their own way to row (when you square the blade, the speed of the slides...) so you will be learning some new technique changes also. although most teams don't require experience, if you are a good rower, and have a decent 2k erg test score ( girls 7:50 or lower)  you should look into a college scholarship. D1 and D2 give scholarships for athletics, and rowing is a great sport to get into, especially for girls (because of NCAA title 9) check it out.

qyATAaeXaa	The whole point of taking a shelter and sleeping bag is to get out of the winter clothes that are either A) Sweaty; B) Soaking Wet; or C) Both. When you stop for the night your body temperature will drop because you are not moving around. Fall asleep outside in the fishing suit or a snow suit and you'll get a crappy night sleep at best. At worse you'll die from hypothermia. A sleeping bag harnesses the core temperature and the dead air keeps your arms and legs warm. Your arms and legs will be much colder with just wearing a suit to sleep in because the blood going into the extremities will slow down. <br>  <br>  Eventually the body just says "F-it, I'm not pumping blood to the freakin' arms because it just comes back cold. I'm gonna save my heart and brain and give this dumbass gangrene."<br>  <br>  It's also not that innovative. It looks like a ski jacket and mountaineering pants I bought about 10 years ago. It's not even Gore-Tex. Some no-name "waterproof/breathable" material...probably the same crap they put in our ski patrol jackets. <br>  <br>  I'd trust a high-altitude mountaineering snowsuit before I tried that fishing suit.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah...the tent. It creates a dead air space that helps reduce the effects of windchill. So with the suit you got an inch or so dead air between you and -30 degree winds...and in the tent it's a toasty 5 above.<br>  <br>  Edit: I have no idea about what the Nazis used. I have a book on WWII uniforms and gear someplace. I'll check it out. On the other hand...Wouldn't it be better to see what the Russians used? After all, the Krauts got their butts kicked on the Eastern Front. (Is it something like a bivy-sack?) <br>  <br>  Additionally: In the worse case scenario you could always just bury yourself in a snow cave like a polar bear. In that event, a suit like this would have some practical applications, but I still don't think it's ideal.<br>  <br>  More: I bet this is warmer:<br>  <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/Product.aspx?top=1621&prod=1311&cat=1662&viewAll=False" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountainhardwear.com/Product....</a><br>  <br>  I bet this kicks butt too:<br>  <a href="http://www.hellyhansen.com/product/OnePieces/OceanRacingSuit/31691/view/2164" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellyhansen.com/product/OnePi...</a><br>  <br>  This is good too, but you'd need something waterproof over it (like maybe a Gore-Tex Bivy Sack)<br>  <a href="http://marmot.com/spring_2009/mens/outerwear/insulated/8000m_suit/info/details" rel="nofollow">http://marmot.com/spring_2009/mens/outer...</a>|`|h2KkiKK3aa	I like my house personally and if camping, minimum a tarp in warmer weather and a good tent in cold weather.<br>  if you want to try this, be my guest, but when first attempting it, try just outside your house and have someone watching you, just in case it goes south and you need assistance.<br>  those gumby suits are only good for a short while, maybe a few hours, not good for permanent shelter.|`|vnJ8mC81aa	This is a stupid idea because I have to carry my stuff.

f9hiPMDxaa	They have always worn shn guards and boxes but most would not field close without a helmet. When you consider how good players like Mike Smith and Greg Chappell in his younger days were in fielding close with no helmet. I do think that helmets should be restricted to the batsman only.<br>  <br>  Tnuc many fielders would not field close to the bat without a helmet. If they want to field close they can do it without one. The only player I can remember (and this was in books) getting hit badly was Sid Barnes.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Close in fieldsmen can wear whatever protection they like, there is nothing in the laws of cricket to outlaw it. The fieldsman can wear a suit of metal armour if he wants but it would slow him down if he has to retrieve the ball!<br>  The fieldsman watches the batsman CLOSELY, if a short leg sees the batsman winding up for a big pull shot, more often than not, he takes evasive action.<br>  Incidentally, in some junior leagues it is compulsory for close in fielders to wear protection!|`|R0NfdgzLaa	why would it be unfair to the batsman??  why would he care what the short leg fielder is wearing?<br>  <br>  edit - bill, i know they wouldn't, but why would the batsman care either way?  isn't that what old mate is asking?<br>  <br>  i get put in close to the bat quite a bit, and i don't wear a helmet, although it's usually when the batsman is pushing defensively at the ball.  i've always joked that it's only going to take one good hit and i'll be padded up more than the batsman, but so far i've felt safe enough.<br>  <br>  edit - ross, i don't think the batsman would care about that.  when a full blooded drive is coming his way, the close-in fielder invariably turns his back and covers up... whenever they're showing a replay of a good cover drive, the fielder (if there is one) is turning away as soon as the bat is lifted - he sees it coming.  if it's just a defensive push, the fielder is ready to snap it up, but the hard shots, they don't want a bar of.  so the helmet is generally there to protect them at times when they're not taking a catch, i'd say.|`|AA11088802	yes they should|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	close in fielder needs protection

I've known plenty of Arabs used for endurance riding that were in the 15.2 range and easily packed a tall but slender rider.<br>  <br>  Also depends on how big-barreled the horse is.  A horse with a wide barrel can "fit" a tall rider as well as a thinner but taller, less barrel-sprung horse.<br>  <br>  It's kind of an individual thing.  I wouldn't rule out a horse that is at least 15.2 if everything else about the horse seemed right.

As you said, the ones who complain are just plain jealous.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I agree totally, Richie. I have brought up the same argument about Steyn's bowling. I had no problem with him bowling bouncers, a batsman has a bat to play them. If he's too slow, that's not the bowlers fault.<br>  <br>  I do think that MBTM has lost it. India losing the tow T20s, Australia beating SA in their last two tests and a possible win again at Durban. He doesn't appear able to handle it.|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Nothing different between them.

And it is that some who make their feelings well and truly known, while the others just ignore the stupidity. But us Aussies will always stick up for and stand by other Aussies - it is our nature.<br>  <br>  And I don't for a minute think that any bowler bowls with the express intention to draw blood. To put fear in to the batsman, for sure. But never to injure deliberately.
90907b7c487c66bf81c4bee8fda1d645aa	Collingwood missed a Grand Final by less than a goal in ' 07 and had a better year in ' 08 considering they had lost Clement, Buckley and Licuria retired and were without Rocca, Rusing, Reid, for most of the season, and Fraser was injured for the finals while Didak and Shaw also missed the finals, due to club suspension.   The Magpies went on to win  a final against Adelaide, with several inexperienced young players and all will benefit from that experience in ' 09.  Barring injuries again, I imagine top 4 is a good expectation for them in ' 09 .|`|VLCUDZlcaa	I think they have the strongest team yet and can definately make the top 4..<br>  <br>  The young players look very promising and are going to be exciting to watch and the older players are playing better than ive seen them. <br>  <br>  I cant wait to see how Maxwell performs as captain - i have full confidence in him to lead the side to success.<br>  <br>  If anyone can stop Geelong and Hawks its Collingwood - as much as ppl hate to admit it right?!!  hehe|`|ma2SXrVfaa	i think they definitely have a good chance of finishing high. unfortunately they are very inconsistent as a team, sometimes they play fantastic, other times i'm riping out my hair because they make awful choices and can't do a thing right, but if they keep playing to the level they are in the nab they have a great chance<br>  <br>  or at least i hope so. i'm a collingwood supporter haha|`|Fohb80yDaa	hey man<br>  girls can also have say too....<br>  <br>  im fairly confident that we will probably make the top 4<br>  we have got our new young guns starting to shine already<br>  and its just the NAB cup.<br>  so as the year progresses everyones jsut gonna improve.<br>  so we may finish off 3rd? 4th?<br>  and if this dont really go to plan... 5th -7th?|`|xmg9CBnCaa	yeah collingwood finishing 4th sounds about right. not good, but right.|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	NO they are going to finish in the eight but not in the top 4<br>  Mip|`|W8SgRKo7aa	they are looking good but have to wait for the real season to sstart.|`|DAQf6k6Waa	no i dont think they are there yet<br>  but they will definately be in the finals|`|4pi34FMeaa	they have the cattle..but,it depends on if the players can keep out of trouble.It seems every year they go well then somebody gets into trouble,the media swarms over them and it falls apart.Its not really their fault after all they are playing for "collingwood" so they get more eyes on them.<br>  P.S this is malthouse's last chance,I don't think sponsers will want to keep supporting an 'almost there team'<br>  good luck pies|`|uJvs4Xnraa	Top eight; maybe.

NR5LhOpPaa	You probably were doing the wrong workouts for tennis.  Most traditional workouts are built around building bulky muscle.  You don't want this for tennis.  The goal to lifting in tennis is building lean muscle.  You don't want to overdo any single muscle.  Flexibility is more important than brute strength in tennis. Even Nadal, who is quite muscular, is very flexible still because of the specific workouts he does.<br>  <br>  Now that you are playing tennis, you are using some other muscles that have been ignored, or at least using them differently than you trained them for.  I'm sure you're fine.  Everybody gets sore muscles from time to time.  The pain will go away soon enough.|`|AA11670411	tennis uses certain muscles, lifting weights won't just cut it, your new to using those types of muscle when playing tennis, I know usually when I get drilled on backhands, my back muscles will start to hurt, mostly because I don't hit enough backhand, nor do I hit it correctly during a match.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	ah well. could be a new sensation for u.. maybe your muscles are a bit tight...  just make sure u drink alot of water..<br>  <br>  and make sure you eat alot of protein to heal and recover your body from the workload u put on it<br>  <br>  also try warm baths with epsom salt|`|B8Gwxo1laa	You're using new muscles. No extra stretching, give your body a chance to get used to these new moves.|`|lbX75d1xaa	There are weight workouts you can do that work the muscles you use for tennis.  This includes core twists, squats, different arm raises, etc.  If you have a trainer or can get one for a few workouts, you can get a good tennis weight routine.

It just came out recently and is very new.  Prices around $400 which is cheaper than the systema obviously.  I'm not sure of the G&G and ClassicArmy electric blowback models have the feature too.

dfCtGuq3aa	If you're not used to sprinting... you shouldn't go all out like that, even if it means sacrificing a few points in football. if your calf muscles aren't used to that kind of strain, you might risk not being able to play anything the whole season just because of a little leg injury. we can't exactly tell the extent of your pain but if you have a trainer in school you should go to him and he'll be better to go to, instead of seeing a doctor because there money will be charged... if its not a lot of pain, like it comes and goes, its probably torn muscle soreness which will rebuild with tissue and add to muscle growth. i doubt you'll be a "slow sprinter" unless your recovery time is extended.. but no matter how serious it it just go to your school trainer so you can make sure everything heals correctly and you don't end up making it worse by trying to sprint more.<br>  <br>  hope i helpedd =]|`|cKXZOLJSaa	Its not too serious but you do need to take it easy and try not to sprint.<br>  I'm guessing one to two weeks minimum.<br>  sometimes calf strains take a little while to heal.<br>  but don't let it get worse, can ruin a season.<br>  But, do ice and stretch it!|`|9jXhZ8Pgaa	its not serious at all just take it easy for a week or two...maybe less, and you should be fine. muscles in the leg heal very quickly.  the same thing has happened to me at least four or five times in my track career.

im8xN545aa	Oh there are many my friend!<br>  <br>  And this is no offense intended to anyone, it's my own personal opinion and not designed to cause an affront to anyone. But I hate all these types of questions (mostly because they've been asked to death): <br>  <br>  -Should Sachin (or whoever) retire?<br>  -Is Sachin the greatest?<br>  -Is Dhoni the greatest? (Any 'who is the greatest' question actually).<br>  -Is Tendulka better than Bradman?<br>  -Is Warne better than Murali? (or vice versa).<br>  -Who is the number 1 team?<br>  -Who will win the first/second/third (ad infinitum) Test?<br>  -Who do you think will win?<br>  -Are (insert team here) rubbish?<br>  -All those guess-the-cricketer/trivia questions that only require a simple Google search to find the answer (the ones that require you to think are fine).<br>  -Where/How can I watch free cricket?<br>  -What's the unlock key for this cricket game?<br>  - Any question designed to insult a team, player, race, creed, country or user.<br>  - What's better Test or T20 cricket?<br>  - Questions asking about cricket mobile phones or insects (or any question that doesn't belong in this section).<br>  <br>  I'm sure I can think of some more! Lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Indeed I have lol. The new 'do' is more reflective of how I wear my hair a lot (in a ponytail). And I don't have straight hair so thought it best to finally change my avatar to something more fitting.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Questions which have no relation to cricket.There have been many questions and I think so you have also seen it.I disagree with your opinion because those questions have relation with cricket and as far as it is related to cricket I really don't mind them.<br>  <br>  Its okay,I really don't feel offended by you.Agreed that the quizzes are more but they have relation with cricket and as far as they are related with cricket I really don't mind seeing them as well as asking them.Its better than some questions out there who have no relation with cricket,right.<br>  <br>  Another question which I dislike is the question regarding some users.<br>  <br>  Another question which I dislike is "Why do people watch such a boring sport like cricket"?<br>  <br>  This is not a question but this is a answer which I dislike to the core i.e., "Dhoni is luck-ridden or Dhoni is lucky".<br>  <br>  1 more question which I dislike-<br>  <br>  "Is Indian Cricket Team Overrated"?|`|kecdkv6jaa	I'm with Markeverest, Binga and Joey "where can i watch cricket online for free?" <br>  <br>  That's asked at least 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  And a guy asked the other day, "where can i watch live streaming cricket in my office" I know crickets great buy do your job!|`|nwZD5mzRaa	When will Sachin retire? <br>  <br>  I mean give the guy a break, he will retire when he feels the time is right. There is really no point in asking that question over and over again.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	I actually don't mind the caption competitions as you can get some funny responses.<br>  <br>  The worst in my opinion is the ones that begin 'Where can I watch...?'|`|GGuXJJeAaa	questions like;<br>  <br>  "who is better"<br>  "who is going to win?"<br>  "where can I watch cricket for free"<br>    <br>  these are the questions i dont even bother to look|`|8FUAMccRaa	This question keeps coming up and I am really fed up with it, Who is better Sachin or Bradman?|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Is this a trick question?|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I tend to agree with Mitch<br>  "where can I watch online cricket or live streaming"<br>  I forgot this one "Where can I get key or cheat codes for cricket 2007"<br>  That's most irritating also, when I look up to an interesting question all I find is this!!<br>  Who is better or which is the best team or some boring unrealistic comparisons whic may involve players of two different era like Ben said<br>  <br>  Then you have those usual racist question which has started to make me sleep nowadays.Sometimes personal fights are also like that<br>  Then this question also<br>  <br>  "Why are so many questions crap"<br>  or "Why is there so much of hatred between users"<br>  <br>  Caption sometimes is boring, same said about quiz<br>  <br>  That's why when I ask quizzes I try to do something slightly different to the ones usually asked<br>  <br>  I dont ask on stats or any such description<br>  <br>  I also try to have fun by asking some funny questions but thats all I have for this week|`|1ayvDGcLaa	Allow me to tell you about my favorite question:<br>  <br>  I forget the answer to it every night so I wake up in the morning with a clean slate. I make my cup of coffee, open my laptop and with bounding enthusiasm open YA cricket and there it is my favorite question:<br>  <br>  Would Bradman do as well if he played today. Would he still have an average of 100?<br>  <br>  I settle down, consider all the factors - the bowling style, the batting style, the nature of the pitches, the quality of the players, the kind of material in the bat and the ball, the commercialization of cricket and if sledging is part of the game, the circumference of the earth, the distance to the moon and if Pluto is a planet or planetoid.  Using my entire intellectual prowess, I come to a conclusion. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately I don't write it down. So come nightfall I forget it.<br>  <br>  And the next morning it is the same joy again.|`|uuHrf7cGaa	A boring question to one may not be the same to others. Repetitive questions which may have been asked the same day are the worst - people do not check if the question was asked before - rather those people want answers to their question. If one reads the purpose of YA is to check for Q being asked.....no one does and that is the glut of questions....At times I have to page out to read Qs that are of interest to me. <br>  <br>  I appreciate what you say are boring to you. For me all those repetitive and guessing ones such as who will win? or who is the best player? - What I see even in the answers - they pick their favorite and do not back up with any stats and reasoning. Without backing an answer is ridiculous and waste of time.|`|mber3JoAaa	The ones that annoy me are the 'where can I get live streaming of such and such match for free'. It only takes a couple of seconds of looking through the list to see there are many similar questions to refer to instead of opening a new question,|`|bHheiqY6aa	I hate "Guess the cricketer...?", question and particularly some answer leads to a first class player who never ever played international games<br>  I feel it is waste of time to answer this type of questions.<br>  Cheers|`|0df7c23b2ec6c594ef9cd80cab3c947daa	This one. Lol, Joke.<br>  <br>  Probably ones I remember after the 50 over world cup.

If you ask me why, the answer will be very very stupid<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I can never guess one!|`|TVuA386waa	This one comes pretty high on the list of most boring.|`|i8QoeiNyaa	Who is the best user in cricket section?<br>  <br>  This question has to be the all time dumbest|`|GhDpVQjhaa	THIS 1 IS BORING|`|b9C8CKo1aa	"Who will win the Toss"..??|`|qrgq7Bauaa	This one wins hands down.|`|d0f04cd8c72152a546d95b7385460a6faa	I'm bored with "Where can I watch cricket live online for free?"<br>  <br>  Same old questions, same old dodgy Indian websites.|`|Fom2temAaa	"What do you think about india's new ODI shirt"?|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Whos going to win?|`|LzkujA3Faa	lol at Tyontyon's answer! The amount of questions asked here about Bradman and the amount of abusing directed at the great man, he must be turning over in his grave!<br>  <br>  I agree with all the  answerers. 'Where can i watch --------- match online for free?" is my personal favourite! So are the stupid questions which abuse players and users.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	The ones wanting to know where they can see a match online free would have to be the worst.<br>  <br>  Edit: I get emails every other day begging me to put on more caption Qs or Who or What Am I Qs, the most recent being from an English female user here. So obviously someone still likes them.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	There are a lot of them that is, after excluding those questions that has nothing to do with cricket. <br>  <br>  Obviously "Caption Contest" has gone too far. And the "guess the player" questions about some obscure players has become monotonously redundant. They were a bit of challenge early on. But too many of them... Familiarity Breeds Contempt.<br>  There are other questions I avoid lately. One such is the infamous comparison between two players of 2 different era. Then there are those questions "which user is the best?", etc. Predicting the score, man of the match, etc. does not go well with me.|`|8yMkjeDdaa	this is the most boring one 1 i have seen|`|AA11088802	any taunting Q for me|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Where to watch live cricket free.

Christian and Edge are not brothers, but from what I heard they started school together. <br>  <br>  Everyone probably knows that their not really brothers,but it is good for tv storylines. TNA even mentioned Christian is Edge brother a couple of years ago just to keep the wrestling fans that are new interested,|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Certain on screen relationships like the brothers you mentioned are indeed just story's. Every wrestler portrays a character none of them are really like that in the ring, Jericho is actually one of the nicest men in the business but at the moment he is a heel character. Most story lines are just that, few have been based on real life events though.|`|855bpb3Caa	When you put it that way,  yes you are right. <br>  <br>  But when people say they aren't brothers, they usually mean that in reality the wrestlers that portray the characters mentioned are not really brothers, not that the characters aren't brothers in the storylines.|`|Pvgzw1bIaa	MY EYES!!! THEY BURN!!! I'm not supposed to know that... next you'll be telling me Bubba Ray and Devon aren't really brothers.

i4bjQbPcaa	Lol! He should have to.  I'm a celtic supporter but I think his reason for playing for Ireland is daft.  He is about as Irish as my made in Japan TV|`|bej55wxUaa	I would think he would be classed as a foreigner.  Otherwise where do you stop ?<br>  <br>  I agree with Bluebell, no Scotsman should turn his back on his country.  I don't agree with what Boyd did and I don't believe the story of why McGeady chose Ireland.  If he was passed over he could not have been considered good enough, not a valid reason for choosing a foreign country.....whereas Boyd chose his dislike for an individual over his country, that's spitting the dummy out way too far.|`|bzwSCm6taa	he should.... he choose Ireland over us......shows where his loyalties lie...<br>  <br>  margaret whatever way you look at it..if he is scottish born and bred he shoul d be playing for scotland...same scenario wi boyd then...not getting picked by scotland..not wanting to play...same thing really|`|bTNxl0ohaa	He is a foreigner in international terms so should be deemed as such in 5 foreigners ruling.<br>  <br>  When Rangers were playing in the first every Champions League, the 3 foreigner rule was in place and that had an effect on the English guys in the team.<br>  <br>  So this should be no different for him.|`|GkFlzMHMaa	Nope because he is Scottish by birth..|`|nH4TOhGVaa	lol he hardly gets a game now|`|LoFCv31waa	No, but maybe he should (according to 'some' Celtic fans!).|`|5Agn35EKaa	No because McGeady is Scottish with Irish ancestry. He will still be Scottish even with the 5 foreigner ruling in place.   <br>  <br>  Bluebell if he had been picked for the Scottish squad before the Irish squad I could see the point of you saying he turned his back on us what did Boyd just do.  Im sure Boyd refused to play for Scotland as long as Burnley was manager totally different scenario bluebell at least he was picked for the squad. A lot of players get picked and don't play, didn't see Boyd refuse to play for Smith when he was leaving him on the bench.   I agree with big chief about spitting the dummy. Maloney is not Scottish but plays for them. Don't see many people complain when foreign players can play for Scotland because of their ancestry do you, or is Mc Geady an exception because he plays for Celtic. Not so long ago people were agreeing that Nacho Novo should play for Scotland so what is the problem with McGeady.|`|SjVukApqaa	He'll just switch his allegiance back to Scotland.|`|jOOyRJR2aa	He'll be off in the summer, his dispute with Strachan, in my opinion hasn't been resolved.|`|bADza5pRaa	Aye, we're gonna trade him for 11 of Derry Citys superstars|`|zDJVWlscaa	He was born in Scotland, to Scottish parents.<br>  <br>  I somehow doubt it =\

Other times it is negotiated, where the player takes a lesser amount than what they would have earned if they had stayed.

ujMsLUcNaa	This article is flawed in many ways.  Allow me to point this out to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Flaw #1 - "anybody seven feet tall and plays close to 40 minutes per game should be able to get 10 rebounds."<br>  <br>  Gheorghe Muresan (7'8"), Manute Bol (7'7"), Shawn Bradley (7'6"), and Ha Seung-Jin (7'3") have never averaged close to 10 rebounds a game.  Some of the more recent players like Zydrunas Ilgauskas (7'3") and Dirk Notwitzki (7'0") has never had a season where he averaged over 10 boards a game.  Yao Ming (7'6") only averaged more than 10 rebounds in 2 out of his 7 seasons.  Now let's move down to the 6'11" range (which is 1 inch from 7 feet) of players who have never ever sniffed an average of 10 rebounds a game: Rasheed Wallace, Kwame Brown, and Eddy Curry.  Mr. Erick Dampier only averaged over 10 boards once in his 13 year career.<br>  <br>  <br>  Flaw #2 - "He (Duncan) literally scores 16 of his 20 points per game by being handed the ball directly under the basket."<br>  <br>  Does this writer even watch Timmy play throughout his career like he proclaims?  TD is one of the most fundamental post scorers in NBA history next to Hakeem, McHale, etc.  The writer also fails to see is how Duncan makes his teammates better by forcing opponents to double team him and creating high percentage shots for other players.    If this was the one of the base arguments for calling Duncan overrated then you might as well add Shaq, Wilt, Moses Malone, and many other great big men throughout history, to the list.  The purpose/duties of a power forward/center is to: 1) score high percentage shots in the paint; 2) create easy shots for their teammates by drawing the double team and kicking it out to 3-point shooters; 3) get 2nd and 3rd chance scoring opportunities on the offensive glass; 4) protect the paint area through the altering or blocking of an opponent's shot and retrieving the defensive rebounds.  Tim Duncan does all that (and more), which is what he is suppose to do.  How much more can you really ask?<br>  <br>  <br>  Flaw #3 - "I have been watching Tim Duncan play for the past 15 years and developed this hatred for him the first time I saw him step on the court."<br>  <br>  The writer claims to have watch Duncan's whole career but he fails to acknowledge the impact he has on his team.  The author also rids himself of any ounce of basketball insight by totally neglecting the criterias of the position Timmy plays.  The fact that he mentioned "hatred", certainly ignites a form of prejudice (or propaganda) that may have clouded his judgment against Duncan without regards to any logical form of reasoning.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Flaw #4 - "Don't be fooled by the fact that he is a career 20-10 (20 points and 10 rebounds per game) or his four NBA titles or three Finals MVP awards. Disregard for a minute the fact that he was named the NBA's MVP twice and that he's been named to the All-Star team 11 times, the same amount of times he has been an All-NBA Defensive Team selection."<br>  <br>  So how else should we measure an athlete's progress in any sport?  The writer takes away the statistics, which is fine since not all great statistical players make it into the Hall of Fame.  The same could be said about being an All-Star.  He eliminates the championship rings, which is subjectable but not entirely unreasonable since some players can ride the coattail of other great NBA players to a title.  Now when he disregards the regular season MVP and NBA Finals MVP award achievement - this is where I draw the line.  You can't be the best player in the entire NBA for a whole season if you don't have the skill, leadership, and dedication it takes to succeed.  It's even harder winning an NBA Finals MVP where (usually) the best teams are duking it out in the most important series of the entire season.  The amount of pressure placed upon a player, the level of composure they must have, and the precision they need to stay focus and perform at the same competitive level is really intense.  You don't win 3 NBA Finals MVP as the leader of your team in these championship series if you don't have that "IT" factor.  The writer forgets to mention the 11 All-NBA Teams (nine First Team nominations) Timmy has earned, which meant he was the best power forward or center in the entire NBA for at least 9 seasons.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have come to the conclusion that the writer is either totally clueless when it comes to basketball knowledge or this entire article was written for the sole purpose of satire.  We should take this lameduck argument for what it's worth.  A good cheesy laugh for killing time and then flush it down the toilet like a pile of waste that has no place in measuring a player's worth or evaluating their career.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I don't think os that Duncan is overrated.He's a very smart player and one of the greatest PFs in the NBA all time.And is a winner so,he's great<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnQOYN6sO0z8T04J8EAu2lHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226104528AACM2answer">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> this Q pls|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Only when they call him "The G.O.A.T." of PFs.

luYkDhOraa	well you are redshirted for a year, but you get an extra one to make up for it.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Some players with pro potential transfer from a NCAA  1A to 2A in order to not have to redshirt.  Example: Randy Moss.   I think the program can waive its objection to the transfer of the player.  It is really a property right issue than any ethical issue.|`|RrKeyYo0aa	you have to sit out a year. the only way you could play after transferring is if you go to a D-2 school or lower. but in a nutshell, after high school you have 4 years to "make it", whether it's J.C., NAIA, D3, D2, or D1. (with the exception of a medical red shirt you have 4 and only 4 years of college football... and only 2 at the J.C. level).|`|6AfM6SWaaa	no idea sorry
xhPKkkELaa	I am tempted to suggest that you just get yourself a nice full length 3/2 suit, which should be plenty for a typical Florida winter. But, hold off on that.....it would make sense for you to go to a good local surf shop with that question. There are some significant variations in water temperatures between north and central Florida (we all know there no surf down south or the west coast). And, the local guys might have a much better idea of what to recommend. I am from up  in the northeast, and I think t there no need for a wetsuit any day the water is higher than 60 degrees.  Good luck. Go talk to the locals, not all us strangers out here in cyberspace.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	I would go for a full wet suit, but not the hoody.

eFQXl7uyaa	The bags are OK. But a one time use expensive bag or replacing home plate is kind of stupid for the cost. The baseball idea is more of a safety issue - do you really want to see a guy get killed by a 130mph batted ball that is camouflaged? There is a reason they change out balls during MLB games beyond the scuff of the ball, they originally started doing this because the grass stained balls were harder to see and were a safety concern.|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Well the bags would be cool, and i think thats actually a plausible idea.<br>  <br>  But the balls would be too hard to see in the grass|`|jIFVydfdaa	distracting|`|k0G58P6kaa	it would be to distracting and blend in to much.|`|wNxVu07Taa	what a great question. it is so simple , it is brilliant. it could be done, should be done. even the first pitch , thrown by irish person. first inning at least. bases makes this question fantastic easily done. m l b could afford the baseballs. since taxpayers were stuck with 100 of millions dollar tax bill from steroid scandal that m l b should have paid. great question long overdue.|`|X3VV159Xaa	Well if the baseballs were green, then the umpire couldnt see it cross the plate very well, bases maybe, but it would look too weird.

i58nZ79taa	Early spring is prime time for catching giant largemouths and smallmouths alike, but you must have the right tools for the task. Here are a few recommendations for this time of year (full disclosure, I work for PRADCO Outdoor Brands who own Lurenet.com)...<br>  <br>  1) Smithwick 5 ?-inch Suspending Rattlin’ Rogue – Clown<br>  <br>  The suspending jerkbait that put suspending jerkbaits on the map, a Rogue is the bait of choice for giant smallies when they stage just off spawning flats. Pause it as long as you can stand between jerks – and maybe a little longer – and remain ready.<br>  <br>  2) 7-inch YUM Dinger - Watermelon Pearl Laminate<br>  <br>  Big, bold offerings often trigger heavyweight spawning fish into committing, and nothing will do that job quite like a 7-inch YUM Dinger. Big Dingers’ also produce hoards of hawgs when pitched around shallow cover throughout the spring. <br>  <br>  3) BOOYAH 3/4-ounce Football Jigheads – Brown<br>  <br>  During early spring many big fish remain in or very near their winter areas, which dictates hitting deeper structure. A BOOYAH Football Head allows you to keep soft-plastic offerings close to prime structure and comes equipped with a 4/O Gamakatsu hook for putting those big fish in the boat.<br>  <br>  4) YUM 5-inch Gonzo Grub - Green Pumpkin/Orange Flake<br>  <br>  A perfect match for the Football Jighead, a Gonzo Grub has a fluttering skirt and twin tails that provide an incredible amount of action. The 5-inch Gonzo provides the necessary bulk to get a lunker to commit. <br>  <br>  5) Bomber Fat Free Shad - Dance’s Citrus Shad<br>  <br>  If you ever travel to Mexico without a stock of Fat Free Shads you’ll buy some before the trip is over, and if you fish anywhere bass grow big without ‘em, you’re leaving something significant on the table. Fat Frees dig deep to get down among ‘em and have just the right profile and wag.<br>  <br>  6) 1-ounce Double Willow BOOYAH Blade - White Chartreuse<br>  <br>  Another trophy bass gem for when the lunkers are laying low in the water column, a big Double Willow BOOYAH Blade offers a large profile to suggest a serious meal. Let it fall to the bottom and slow roll it across the deepest edges of flats and the ends of points<br>  <br>  7) ?-ounce Single Colorado BOOYAH Blade – Coleslaw<br>  <br>  When early-spring storms stain big bass waters, it’s time to pull out a thumping single Colorado. The fish will move tight to shallow cover, and they will dart out of bush to ambush something that’s creating big vibes. Work close and make short accurate casts, working the bait tight to the thick stuff.<br>  <br>  8) BOMBER Deep Flat A - Apple Red Crawfish<br>  <br>  The Flat A’s extra-tight wiggle suggests an easy meal, which is something bass cannot resist while their metabolism levels remain low. Use a steady medium-slow retrieve and kick it off rocks and the bottom whenever possible.<br>  <br>  9) Cotton Cordell Super Spot - Tomato Red<br>  <br>  A first-season classic on grass lakes, the Tomato Red Super Spot accounts for a tremendous amount of hawgs this time of year. Let it fall into patches of submerged vegetation, rip it out of the grass and hold on tight!|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Jerkbaits always worked best for me in spring. I live in Buffalo NY|`|N4t2t3dMaa	Get you self some banjo minnow's alot of people dont think that they work but im gonna tell you that they do because i use them and catch bass left and right if you decide to get them start out with the smallest banjo minnow (i would try the yellow) and the light weight red eye's that go in it and the small hook, i say try the small one fist because if you start catching fish on the small one's then move up to the bigger one's and wear'em out. try diffrent depth's with them they don't alway's work on the surface or on the bottom so you just have to try diffrent depth's. You can pick them up at bass pro shop or order them off line, oh and another thing to try is the Zoom super salt plus  6'' Watermelon seed lizard on a carolina or texas rig i tear'em up with that to. but the diffrence is i live in north carolina but hey fish eat and if you throw something in there that they want then there gonna get it, hope i have helped!|`|9W19U09Kaa	Ok, not a long and detailed answer, but this is what I use and its is GOLD!!! get a 3/0 hook, berkley powerbait bungie worm, color blue flek, worm wait, and giver a texas rig. youll be bringing dinner home for a week just on 1 trip!!! but berkley stopped making the bungie worms so look for them on ebay or craigslist lol, i had to, when i find them, i buy them all lol. they are that great|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	it all comes down to what u have the most confidence in.........for me it is a soft plastic or a jig.<br>  <br>  what i would reccomend is that u try different baits and see what works best for u.<br>  <br>  water temp has a lot to do with what bait u should be using.if the water is still cold u will have to slow down ur presentation because the bass will still be lethargic.once thw water begins to warm u can use different baits that require more speed,like a jerk bait.<br>  also u can use a jerk bait slowly.jerk and let it pause for 3-5 seconds or longer,this is called "dead stick" i believe.<br>  <br>  i would stick with the jigs and soft plastics though............also u might want to use a smaller bait if the water is still cold.1/4oz jig,3" worm with an 1/8oz bullet weight.<br>  <br>  there are so many options.<br>  <br>  like i said to begin with...........experiement,use what u have the most confidence in

He has the tactics to defeat both Federer and Nadal and that in itself is a huge acheivement.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Well talent wise, i really think that goes to roger federer. His style of play requires a lot more talent than Nadals.<br>  <br>  I mean Nadal is very fast and in great shape, but is that really under talent? I wouldn't categorize it as so.<br>  <br>  Thats why I think Roger federer has more talent, his shots require a lot more precision and tactics than Nadals. His small racquet head and his inside out forehand require immense amount of concentration and skill. <br>  <br>  Nadals forehand has a huge margin of error, so not much talent in that, also, he wins in cheap ways like just hitting it to federer's backhand, Not much talent in that.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	federer  and verdasco
jTaW3goeaa	If you go to any resort on the weekend you have to get their early in the morning, the lines get ridiculous around midday and stay that way through the afternoon.

The decision to trade Kellen Winslow($4.5M salary) points to the latter."  <br>  <br>  I say they're getting rid of a receiver who was always either injured or causing controversy.  They have another good TE, so trading for a couple of new players could turn out to be a wise move.<br>  <br>  They were decent, not great, last year until injuries gradualy worked them down to their #4 QB.

I will tell you the pro's and cons of each type; Bootfoot vs. Stockingfoot..<br>  <br>  The bootfoot are good for the easy on - easy off thing. They are also good in cold water situations because the airspace above your toes acts as an insulator and retains some of the heat from your feet.<br>   The cons with bootfoot waders are...They dont give you as much ankle support. When you do a lot of climbing up and down the slippery riverbanks, or crossing rivers with slippery rocks, that can be an inconvenience. They can also blister your foot or ankle by doing that kind of climbing too.<br>  <br>  The Stockingfoot type allow you to choose your boot type and the lace up boot gives much better ankle support than bootfoots. This can make a long day on the river much more comfortable than the boot foots.<br>  <br>  The cons of the stockingfoot waders are that in cold water, you dont have the air pocket above your toes so your feet conduct their heat directly out to the water. A pair of good socks  can help alleviate this problem. Stockingfoot waders also take a little more time to put on than bootfoots. That may sound petty but in the fall when you only have an hour or so after work, the faster you can gear up and get in the water...the better.  Stockingfoot waders and the boots also cost a few more bucks than the bootfoots but I prefer them just for the ankle support they provide.<br>  <br>  Just some things to consider.|`|vv0v03SHaa	I suggest you get the chest waders (overalls) for a few extra bucks they are well worth it.

xKXu0Qb2aa	Yes.<br>  Like I Keep Saying (& I Know I'll Get a Barrage of TD's) - Half of "The Streak" is a Complete Joke.<br>  Only a Few Opponents Actually Mattered - HHH , Flair , Batista , Edge , Kane (x2) , Orton , *EDIT* - Snuka , Roberts.<br>  The Rest - Who Cares.<br>  <br>  HBK may be Only 6-9 in His WM Matches , but at least for the Most Part , He's Gotten Great Opponents - Hart , Flair , Y2J , Benoit/HHH , Cena , Angle , Austin.<br>  <br>  HBK's List is Far More Impressive than that of 'Taker's...|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I will give you my honest opinion. I don't think the opponents have anything to do with it. Taker does a great job either way. I do believe HBK has gotten matched up with perfect opponents over the years though. Taker has too. Anyway, the reason why I prefer Shawn over Taker is because I know way more about Shawn than I do Taker. Shawn's life is an open book (literally). He's more vocal and Animated (so-to-speak). He has a charm about him as well. Even though I don't know Taker as well as I do Shawn...I do see that he is human and he's an awesome guy. I met both men, so from personal experience...I do know they are great guys outside of the character's they portray. I think Shawn had a more adventurous career than Taker. Taker is awesome, I like him a lot. I still prefer Shawn though. I connect better with him than I do Taker.<br>  Edit: It could be part of their gimmick. Not size though. Taker is very talented. His size doesn't matter too much. It's a plus, but there is no negative side to it.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Taker has had to face some bad competition, Mark Henry is the prime example. But you know, he is still 16 & 0, you can not argue with that. But I think HBK has had some of the best matches is Wrestlemainia history, Brett Hart, Stone Cold and Jericho are examples of this.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Yes .<br>  <br>  It depends on your individual thoughts .<br>  I feel HBK is better than Taker .<br>  <br>  HBK Is better than Taker on the mic , easily .<br>  They are about equal in wrestling ability .|`|jWBuMxKzaa	I gotta give it to HBK. He is very athletic and great on putting on show whether heel or face and his age doesn't appear to being slow him down yet. While taker was a big thing back in old days because he was something completely new and was billed as this unstoppable force. His only really strength was his seer size which allowed him to pretty much throw anybody around and make it look good. But at his age he cant do half as well as he use to. For people say his striking and mma is a str is just bs because it scripted and doesn't count for anything. Hell you want striking watch stings old matches, going against 7-10 people knocking them down with striking lol funny how people use to enjoy watching that. Plus if you carefully watch his last 4 wm wins the jumps over top rope. does last ride from turnbuckle, all same ending. Then even gave him this boring submission, old taker would just destroy guy with brute force. They are doing same with kane. A guy who use to be able to take 3 chair shots to face before going down now can be beat by a low guy like mvp.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I think most of the people who prefer HBK like him more because he acts much more human than Undertaker, which means he's more entertaining on the mic and easier to relate to. Talent wise, I think it depends on whether you prefer Shawn's technical/flashy style or Taker's striking/boxing/MMA style.<br>  <br>  Who gives people thumb downs for their OPINIONS? Since when is an opinion "wrong"? Jeez...|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Taker's 16-0 streak is fully overrated.<br>  Every time he is superior then his opponent, in all those years he never faced Bret Hart, Stone Cold, Hulk Hogan e.t.c. at Wrestlemania.<br>  <br>  HBK on the other hand had given best Wrestlemania moments in history.|`|HLsNzQNZaa	There both talented wwe superstars there probally in the same rank,but i think Undertaker has fought harder matches.|`|AA11482019	HBK is better than the Undertaker.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No. I think that Shawn Michaels is partly able to put on such great performances because he alone is an amazing performer but he also gets another great performer in his match. Undertaker is a great performer but he doesn't get a good performer in his matches. Undertaker still manages to deliver some great matches, however, like his match with Batista which was entertaining even though Batista is worthless in the ring.
2zk5K9Njaa	I agree with you. There is always something crazy that happens in the playoffs.

You are an embarrassment!|`|r5V3ZNGfaa	I didn't watch the game... but he didn't do anything terribly noteworthy in the the 3rd, as per TSN's game log, so I'm assuming he didn't play or cooled off entirely during the 2nd intermission. 13:55 isn't a lot for Eric, who plays every situation, and I think was in the top 4 among forwards for time on ice (I remember that from a Bob Q, but it was from quite a bit ago).<br>  <br>  Perhaps there was a limiting of Eric's icetime due to fear of him being injured, whether it would be due to a bitter opponent since he tortured Tampa for the 1st two periods or just from him being on the ice more than he "has" to be. Or maybe he was just held off the ice since it was already a blowout to give guys not on the 1st line some chances.<br>  <br>  Agreed though... Carolina's chasing a playoff spot and hockey, I have learned, is an unpredictable sport. Wouldn't the Canes have been stunned if Tampa scored 8 unanswered goals? Maybe not likely, but certainly not impossible...|`|Ul9rMdseaa	He did play in the 3rd period I'm from Carolina so I got to watch it.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Hmmmmmmm.....he wasn't injured but it is low.<br>  <br>  <br>   On the other hand, up 9-1 and Eric Staal is out there alot looking for that 7th point and he blows a knee then.........<br>  <br>   Also, in a race for a playoff spot but TB isn't going to claw back from a 9-1 deficit.

XRB23VDIaa	Kentucky basketball has always been held to a high standard. A standard that Gillespie has yet to live up to. I hate to see Kentucky lose but I do think he should have one more year to prove himself. If he doesn't, then I will be the first one on the dump Billy Gillespie band wagon. After all, he was left nothing by our last coach.|`|AA11098840	I don't think so.  We need to give him time to get the players he needs to win.  It may just be that this combination of players he has currently just don't work under his system.  Outside of Patterson and Meeks, there's not a whole lot of talent performing well on the team.  <br>  <br>  They're also young and many of them are getting their first full years' experience in division 1 college basketball play.  It takes time to adjust to this level of competition and without any senior leadership (Jared Carter being the only senior), it's just too difficult of a transition for them to come out playing like a national contender.<br>  <br>  Give Gillespie another year and if Patterson, and Meeks return, we should be really good next year.  We'll have a new really talented Center coming in and all the first year players will have more experience in practice.  I look for Darius Miller to come out of his shell and start showing off the talent he has.  The team will be much improved next year.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	We need to give him 2 more seasons. He only has two of his recruiting class in. There are only a few players on the team that are Kentucky material. Porter and Harris are mid-major talent, but they have to start for us. This just shows the bad recruiting that Tubby Smith had. I really hope he is not ran off. Just give him time. <br>  <br>  If you get rid of him after two seasons, there won't be anyone that will want this job. People already think that we are crazy.|`|IiWz11Kraa	Hi, I am from US, and i was kinda interested to know about Europe's basket ball.

Vyz5YnZqaa	Last in NFC east, it was the best thing to happen to the Redskins because they were set to be last again but with Dawkins gone they will now finish 3rd.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	There defense just dropped from #4 to #9.|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	I wouldn't say the Eagles ''let him go.'' The Broncos just outbid them on the open market. The Eagles didn't want to give him 5 years. Not all of it was guaranteed though. Only 2 year/9 million was guaranteed by Denver. The Eagles only wanted to give him 5 million, which was cheap.  Perhaps the Eagles underestimated his value. I understand the Lito Sheppard move more, because they had Assante Samuel and Sheldon Brown, but losing Dawkins is going to hurt. Besides the luck of having everything go right in week 17, what carried the Eagles in the postseason, and passed the Vikings and Giants was their defense.I don't see the Eagles doing much different than next season. They'll probably range in between winning 8 and 10 games, which may or may not be good enough to get in. I think Dallas will do a little better without the distraction of TO. The Redskins aren't bad either. But the team that'll likely dominate this division, at least during the regular season, seems to be the Giants.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	Losing B Dawk is a big lost but it isn't the end of the world....Sean Jones isn't a bad safety and I think him and Quinton Mikell will do good together and as long as Jim Johnson is the defensive coordinator the defense will be fine, but I don't think anyone will be able to replace Brian Dawkins.....I see the Eagles making either the playoffs or at least the wildcard (not last in the division like some people think)|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	The Eagles will do o.k.|`|4SXa9lJWaa	I am just mad they let him go.|`|G07o0cHPaa	They'll probably be better.

7bx2XQlqaa	its cuz he plays for the Clippers.  But I agree Gordon is having a terrific year and should be considered for the ROY.  It should be between Gordon, Rose, Mayo, Westbrook, and Beasley.

b7JS16dyaa	Triple H has the haters who constantly mention his marriage and "backstage powers", while ignoring his overall talent and his work from before he married his wife. He's a great ring-general, and carries some people to decent matches.<br>  <br>  John Cena has the people who hate him for his character, but instead of blaming the writers, they blame him. Sure, his moveset is limited these days, but he can be entertaining when he wants to.<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy has the judgemental haters who hate his life choices and say his moves suck because all he does are crazy dives/flips/jumps, ignoring that it's for entertainment, which is what the "E" in WWE stands for. I think he has the lesser of the haters though.<br>  <br>  I'd say that Triple H actually has the worst haters, because unlike Cena, he can carry others while Cena has to be carried to have a decent match. The fact that Triple H is a good worker is just forgotten due to his family.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ: Career maker: it'll be better than their constant, random, and pointless jobber matches, anyway. With Legacy in the WWE, it could also make an interesting angle if they formed an alliance. I think it should only be a short-term thing though, just to start their careers.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Cena, how can the haters actually make a song about how much Cena sucks? That's  sad|`|JiCfYfLraa	john cena for sure do you remember when he fought rvd at ecw one night stand. they called cena all the names in the book. cena threw his shirt and they threw it back at him. also in that tag match with trish all the fans were like cena sucks and they kept chanting it.<br>  also cena is suppose to be the top face in the wwe but the wwe fans treat him like a heel they boo the hell out of him.<br>  <br>  <br>  wq:career makers for sure look at chris beniot he trained in the hart dungeon.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Hardy has the worst haters. They take low blows and call him a drug addict, you can't get any worse than that.|`|KIOR56r6aa	HHH, he's a bastard|`|EZf00NJJaa	Which wrestlers has the worst haters ? Cena, Hardy or HHH ?<br>  <br>  HHH , everything he did , it is because of Steph . <br>  No logic applies .<br>  This has gone on for several years now , cena hate is newer .<br>  I respect all three , and actually think  John Cena is doing the best he can .<br>  The IWC needs someone to hate , or it would cease to exist .<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ: New Hart Foundation, Career Maker or Career Breaker ?<br>  <br>  Career breaker .<br>  Anyway , they dropped plans for it .|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	hey ofcourse it's john cena<br>  no matter how hard he tries still he doesn't get what he wants to from the fans... even though he's a face when he comes to the ring at least<br>  15% of the crowd booing|`|jWBuMxKzaa	Nope ive hated him for same reason since they gave him his stupid gimick. I just hate wiggers is all simple as that.|`|6d0250ca8941e47460eda0499a69b2caaa	hey do not knock TRIPLE H he is my main man, leave him alone.|`|HLsNzQNZaa	1.John Cena-People call him a poser,worst wwe wrestler call him a white guy who thinks his black,people also hate him because he wins to much matches,supposly gets to much title shots,never loses and sucks in rapping/talking in the mic,some people call him a wana be/poser.<br>  <br>  2.Jeff Hardy-He gets to many chances keeps on loosing till he wins one main match mostly always a title match,some people say he's only good because of his brother Matt Hardy.<br>  <br>  3.Triple H-He gets to much title shots,some people say he should retire he' ruining wwe by him always being the champion,some people don't like him because they hate evalution or dx.<br>  <br>  Thats what i've heard that people say smack about the wwe wrestlers.<br>  The number mean the most hated John Cena is the number #1 hated.<br>  The number #2 hated is Jeff Hardy.<br>  The number #3 hated is Triple H.|`|XmqkzQqvaa	IMHO I think ppl hate on Cena the most because he is just there for the kids and is by far the most corniest wrestler. Most sensible haters know Cena is talented (mic skills) and could be a wonderful heel (like when he started in the WWE). Also because most haters are fans from the Attitude era and expect more than the good versus bad story lines the WWE spews today. I for one don't like Cena as he is today but I don't slander him just to hate.
33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...Well, you can't play collegiately without being enrolled in college...but you could find an amateur team or sport and go out for it...Then just show the coach what you can do...<br>  <br>  Then, if you're good enough, you might be able to go pro...Depends on the sport though, which you said nothing about...|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Get a part time job at Walmart|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	It depends what grade you're in. Are you a senior? I think you could give what ever sport it is you want to play a try. A guy your size sounds like he'd be a decent foward on a HS basketball team though, especially as a rebounder. If you don't like basketball, with your height, you could be good at volleyball (ex. spiking). If you've never played baseball before, it's a little harder to pick up, unless you're really athletic, but maybe you could hit the ball... Bowling is a good sport too. It's actually fun, because the least amount of running is needed lol Plus, you can eat when playing and you usually won't get yelled at by your coach for doing so.<br>  <br>  I played baseball in HS in my 2 of 3 years of HS. I was cut as a freshman. I made it as a sophmore and junior. When I was a senior, I went to a new HS, so I lost a lot of what I put in baseball at the previous school... But I was a role player. I was a decent lefty pitcher, but I just didn't want to go through the running and all that. Especially in the cold and in my senior year. Instead, I tried out for bowling. I didn't think I had a shot in the beginning, because I was only like a 135-140 average, but there were like 18 guys trying out for 15 spots and I just happened to beat out a few other guys lol Chances are, the season is well into play and over, but if you're a sophmore or junior, give that sport a try next year if your school has it...|`|qsx4IyQsaa	they have like softball leagues for older peaple but as far as serious competition your too late maybe you can gather some friends and play football every week or so|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	No<br>  No<br>  Yes|`|JNTQwvtTaa	Your'e screwed.|`|xOW4V7qiaa	Bowling...

ibuqSqBMaa	Hey, im a professional caddy. I think that all three brands make a good wedge. I play with the classic Titlesist Vokeys which i think are the best because they are good for any type of player and they are a good quality made club.|`|YwM8Z14oaa	I know this isn't on our list, but if you try them you will be surprised.<br>  <br>  Bridgestone wedges, they have been rated te best wedges in Golf Magazine before. They are really good wedges, and they play like the Cleavland and Titlest put together. <br>  <br>  You will be happy, they work for any shot your looking for.|`|rqnTGYouaa	Taylormade would be better.<br>  Just like it<br>   TaylorMade Tour Preferred Iron Set|`|d8QBFq0saa	I use Cleveland and they are really good. I have a 60 degree and a sand wedge|`|e7WpIxuhaa	hmmmmmmmmmmm|`|JSGLKnA4aa	none are better it's up to each person to find what works for them. i prefer wilson's.|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	Cleveland- I use a Cleveland wedge and I like the feel of it n I luv using it!|`|sbAXlECuaa	I would say titleist wedges would be your best bet. Taylormade wedges are good weges but not top-of-the line clubs. My buddy has the cleveland wedges and they are great for short pitches and bump and runs, but when it comes to full swings I don't care for them.|`|gAhHCpRNaa	cleveland regular 588. i ordered a couple vokeys, didnt like them, went back to my old groove-less clevelands. i generate a lot of spin with my swing and the spin i would get with the spin milled was uncontrollable.|`|c819b9c0e601697d9b53e747cb45c707aa	Whats good for me might not be good for you , why don't you hit them all and come up with your own conclusion , its free to demo a club .|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	Titleist Spin Milled
pX2ZraBVaa	no he isnt<br>  but definitely eastern conference final or finals for sure<br>  <br>  unless cleveland implodes like dallas did a while back|`|IiWz11Kraa	I wish, but i am not so sure. They are good at home games, but i think they should be more aggressive in the playoffs - home and away.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Nope. He needs a team first. It's him against the world.|`|L66IcsuUaa	Basically it's whoever comes up top. Kobe and Chris Paul were very close in last year's race. However, Lakers came up on top and Kobe Bryant won the MVP. If Lebron can guide his team to be on top, he'll definitely win that MVP award.|`|sOae9LUzaa	I love how Cavs fans say it every year and every year they end up disappointed. I admire your perserverance guys. It's like Knicks fans.|`|6DekjoOpaa	He is the best player. I hope not since I am a celtics fan|`|5EA4XKpZaa	Man I really don't think so, but hey I'd love to be proven wrong.
Vyz5YnZqaa	No, It figures he would go to a division where there would be headlines, TO will play twice against Parcells and all the old Dallas Coaches and players now in Miami and he will go against Randy Moss Twice a year so he's right where he wants to be, in the limelight.|`|g5RS83paaa	I wish the cowboys had kept kim, I think he has a lot of heart and talent|`|MxHIdyVAaa	hahaha, you should be shocked.  you actually think there was any even REMOTE chance the Colts would ever sign a player like Terrell Owens?  As if they had signed anyone Terrell Owens age since Duane Bickett, it still wouldn't make sense as they don't need him.  They already have Reggie Wayne (who is better than Owens) and Anthony Gonzales.  Not to mention, they'll end up with either Jeremy Maclin or Percy Harvin in the draft.<br>  ... ANYWAYS.  A team like Buffalo does surprise me a little bit.  Signing Terrell Owens does sure up there questions at wide reciever a little bit.  But, they're still left with a weak core @ linebacker, tightend, the secondary, and there short two on pass rushers.  If Buffalo can answer any of THESE problems, then they might be able to contend with the rest of the league.  But, all Terrell Owens means in the AFC East is, Trent Edwards might have a new favorite target over Lee Evans.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Honestly, if you would have told me Terrell Owens would be a Buffalo Bill in 2009 I would have called you crazy.  The man is going to be 36 when the season starts and isn't getting any better with age, I really expected him to hold out for a contender to come calling, even if that meant sitting at home for the first few weeks of the season.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	never thought about buffalo. good move by them. great signing by TO.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	I am surprised how many people know who the contenders are in March|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	I don't think there was a contender or big market team out there who wanted to take on the PR issue. Honestly, what I predicted is that he wouldn't get a team to sign him, because of the problems he's caused with teams in the past. I've heard some people on here say all the problems in each team wasn't TO's fault? How do you sour three franchises though? Well, if he manages to screw it up in Buffalo, a less competitive team, with much less media attention than Dallas or Philly, than it's complete evidence that he's the problem. I'll admit, seeing that headline caught me a little off guard. I thought he'd wait a little longer, if signing, but he probably realized it wouldn't be out there forever. It is a tough market, so you take what you can get while it's out there.|`|d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	I'm shocked about T.O. signing with Buffalo. I thought that he would exercise some common sense and sign with a contender. The only problem is that NOBODY wanted to sign him because of his past chemistry problems with other teams. Now that T.O. has signed with the Bills, it's a foregone conclusion and a surefire bet that his NFL career is over! <br>  <br>  He will continue to put up good numbers, but he would've put up better numbers if he didn't drop the ball so damn much! His career with the Bills is over because the Bills haven't been a relevant team since the early-to-mid 90's when they advanced to the Super Bowl four straight seasons.....AND LOST THEM ALL! Being with the Buffalo Bills, he has a chance to add to the Buffalo Bills mediocrity if he can just get the Bills to the Super Bowl, drop some more passes, and add another to make the Bills "5 time Super Bowl losers!" <br>  <br>  But thankfully, the Bills won't give T.O. a chance to cause a team chemistry problem or an individual behavior problem because they have done the smart thing by signing him to a ONE YEAR contract! Other teams have known that signing him to a long term deal for more than two or three years spells disaster! Signing him to a long-term deal on your team is like giving an Army cadet a hand grenade, pulling out the pin, and telling him "Oh please, be careful!" It'll be a matter of time before he blows up!<br>  <br>  I know that the psychologists and sociologists are going to have a field day with this cat if they put him in a room and try to decide what his REAL problem is and why he keeps having so many problems with himself and other teams. Believe me when i say that Dr. Phil would have a field day and would really get his money's worth and then some if he ever tries to deal with him! One thing is for sure: he can't use his childhood and upbringing as a cop out anymore. That's tired and trifling. He and everyone else should've gotten past that. His time for maturing is long overdue.|`|9wblT5sYaa	as a Bills fan I am shocked.  I never thought we would make a bug splash like this in free agency.  I just hope Trent can get back throwing the ball well with confidence, and if he does TO will produce which in tern will help out Lee and the other WRs.  this WILL make us a huge contender.  plus even if it doesn't work out, its just a one year deal. good roll of the dice if you ask me cant wait for Bills season to start.  maybe next year the Bills resign him because they ARE contenders|`|e5d64abaac3b50429d79ed7e1836cacaaa	I can't wait for the sh*t to start dripping from the *** of the Bills when T.O. starts his usual course:<br>  <br>  1.)  Helps the team out the first few weeks, looking like a good pick at first.<br>  <br>  2.)  An upsetting loss has T.O. making accusations and stupid comments.<br>  <br>  3.)  It gets to the point where everyone including fans, players, coaches, and media start asking if the team should let him go because of his crap.<br>  <br>  Hey, but who knows.  Maybe T.O. was one of those children you had to punish three times to get the point through.  Maybe he'll say to himself, "Hell, I've been dropped by teams so many times.  Maybe I should tweak my personality a bit".<br>  <br>  If he has even a small dream about the Hall of Fame he needs to get at least one damn team to like him.|`|HpBKn35Caa	ahahaha im sooo happy i love the buffalo bills and he might sign with the buffalo bills again nextd year if he has no problems so im guessing hes signing with a diff team next year GOOOO BUFFALO BILLS!!!!!!!!|`|BqVcz1R1aa	buffalo WAS a contender...but now they got to contend with this cancer....bad move Wilson.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	a little shocked and no they wont contend.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Nope, I saw it coming.|`|khqWGKU9aa	Buffalo was a contender in the early parts of the season, then they fell apart when Trent Edwards went down with the concussion. And Lee Evans and TO on either side, now Trent Edwards has some players to throw to and not have to worry about throwing to Evans in double coverage. Buffalo will make the playoffs, and TO may sign another year or 2 with the Bills afterwards, becuase he will be the go 2 guy and thats what he is all about.|`|GUjr6whNaa	Im a little shocked that a team like buffalo that rarely makes bold moves like this would pick him up. Plus the bills have always been kind of Anti poor locker influence players so... big move by the bills<br>  <br>  (few highly paid Free Agent signings in the last few years)<br>  (last trade was in 02 or 03 for Drew Bledsoe)<br>  <br>  They will prolly not make the playoffs but they might get close. Very best make the wild card but def not an afc title|`|cngrEZRHaa	Im not shocked they signed him.  He will help their team out and there was a limited list of teams that would take him.  I think they should upgrade their QB though.  It depends how this season goes for him for how next season will be for him.  They have a good receiving core with  him now.

UANpgVupaa	You shouldn't have to feel like you need to find a gay-friendly team. If you love basketball and want to goto a game and make out then great. This is a free country. I wouldn't worry about what everyone else thinks. Be you and do your thing. I agree if you really want a "gay-friendly" team then most likely cities that are open or liberal. San Francisco is an obvious choice (Warriors). Sacramento would be fine (Kings), Los Angeles is very liberal (Lakers), or even New York (Nets). I am sure even Orlando (Majic) would be somewhat fine for you as well. Hope this helps.|`|PBV4l3aCaa	utah<br>   jazz|`|nBbmNmPSaa	hideous flamers. no one wants to see that.|`|AA11488609	I would say:<br>  <br>  1.

Los Angeles Clippers (same as Lakers).<br>  4. New York Knicks (NYC is a liberal city).<br>  <br>  The so called gay friendly teams would be so because they're in large cities which are known for being openly liberal and tolerant, not because some particular player is on a team.|`|IiWz11Kraa	has anybody seen kb24 and pepper lately?|`|VAx6qu58aa	the los angeles lakers or washington wizards|`|fia9gMHpaa	.|`|rQoCc4lRaa	a GS Warrior game|`|v811KD7raa	pistons

People on here are probably going to try and pull out some sort of mathematical guide as to what size woul suit you best, but it's all down to what you feel comfortable with.<br>  I skate a 7.6", which to me is perfect, but it may be thin for you...or too thick for that matter.<br>  <br>  A great average size would be a 7.75". What would be ideal is if you can get a go on a few of your friend's boards, or ask some of the skaters at your local park, that way you can get first hand experience in what you find the most comfortable.<br>  <br>  As for brand, go with whatever takes your fancy.

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Well answered by Alec...<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree that if serious about racing mx you need to get rid of the crf250x and get something like the crf250r or any of the known brand 250f's.   <br>  <br>  I would not go for a 2 stroke 125cc as they are not the future of mx racing and are slowly disappearing from the race grids.  Yes many do still race them but any serious racer will be on a 4 stroke.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	With some very minor changes the X would run circles around a 125. No it won't be quite on par with the 250F MX bikes because of the extra weight, but still far better than any 125. Seriously, no one races a 125 anymore.|`|hfH8c1LWaa	well, the crf250x is a desert runner/trail bike, which isnt meant for track racing at all. if your really serious about racing, i would get rid of the x and get the crf250r, which is just the thing u want. as awesome as 2 stroke are, theyre dying away fast in the racing world and cant compete with todays 250 thumpers. get any 250f and u will be in good hands (if u want to stray away from honda, i would recommend the kawasaki kx250f, that thing is a powerhouse)
AA11231884	it will be hard, tennis is not an easy sport, it requires both ur legs (footwork) and arms (strokes). i dont want to discourage u, but no one will start out good in tennis, u will have to go through some difficulties. but i still think its a good idea to start if u want to. however, avoid any bad habits like moving ur wrist a lot or have an improper form. it will be the fastest way since u dont need to be pulled back due to some things u r doing wrong|`|s7l6oZANaa	wel it depends if the people your playing against is any good.. but tennis is a pretty easy sport to play.. you just have to practise your strokes and accuracy.. and you should be fine.. and...<br>  your lucky your high school has a tram in year 11  mine only goes up to yr 10 =||`|TMVHdNpbaa	yeah why not, as long as you practice! good luck!|`|AA11670411	it won't be easy, people think tennis is very easy to play, but it's not.

Try to at least hit a few balls before you go out for the team, so you can at least get a feel for the game.|`|AA12167151	as one person has mentioned already, it's harder than everyone else thinks it is. it's not just about swinging a tennis racket as hard as you can and hoping the ball will go over the net.<br>  sometimes, it depends on how good your hand-eye coordination or your technique on hitting the ball is. give it a shot and see how you like it.|`|5HT9hgaJaa	Haha i can relate because i left my schools lax team to play tennis.

I can say that the noisiest among the 3 is the Royce which is manufactured in the U.K. I know because I own a Royce 24H hub Shimano compatible laced to a Mavic CXP30 and a Fulcrum Racing 3 Wheelset. Although I don't have a Campaq hub, I can hear their "ticking" noise from some of my cyclist friends whose bicycles are Campaq's equipped.

In this price range they usually are of the quality that they make the sound you require due to better internals.

On one side you have modern budo. These are arts that have only been around for the last 150 years or so. Judo, Aikido, kendo and modern jujutsu all fall into this catagory.<br>  <br>  Then you have the koryu arts. These are the ones that have true samurai linage and date back hundreds of years. Arts like muso jikiden eishin ryu, Hontai yoshin ryu, kukishin ryu are all very old styles. There are some very old weapons based arts still practiced such as kyudo and naginata jutsu plus others that all fall under the koryu umbarella!<br>  <br>  Sensei scandle is correct Karate isnt really a Japanese art and comes under modern budo. Its true roots lie in Okinawa and china. <br>  <br>  Bushido is the old samurai code and you also can add religions such as shinto, mikyo and buddism. The philosophy and views often transend and influence both modern and koryu budo!<br>  <br>  Bujutsu are the warrior arts that come from Japan. The striking arts found in modern budo having nothing to do with the old ways of Japan. They are very much a modern invention. So when someone claims to be teaching a samurai based art and they are a practitioner of modern budo then i'm afraid they are talking out of their backsides! <br>  <br>  An interesting point worth mentioning is that any style that was introduced after the 1500's hasnt really been tested. After this period in Japanese history the arts were changed so much that they dont really represent their true intentions! Hence the large forms and mess that dont make much sense to most practitioners because the real application and spirit has been lost! Intentionally in some cases but more by mistake in others.<br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  idai|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Here is just a few.<br>  <br>  Bujutsu - warrior arts <br>  <br>  ninjutsu - art of endurance / steath<br>  <br>  Karate - art of emty hand<br>  <br>  Aikido - way of harmony<br>  <br>  Jujitsu - art of grappling<br>  <br>  Kenjutsu - art of the sword<br>  <br>  Taijutsu - art of hand to hand comat|`|oTb67zNYaa	karate is not Japanese it is Okinawan most people do not make that distinction|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Jujitsu<br>  Judo<br>  Aikido<br>  Budo Taijutsu/Ninjutsu<br>  Kendo<br>  Iaido<br>  Kenjutsu<br>  Sojutsu<br>  Kyu-do<br>  Naginata-do<br>  Sumo|`|QQHdigH3aa	Bushido. was very popular in the early days.

6Mpi3Bgjaa	Well you can cross out the Magic...I doubt very seriously if they retire Shaq's #32<br>  <br>  Miami?...probably not, the Heat won that championship on Dwyane Wades' brilliance, not because of Shaq's, Shaq was a part, but Dwyane Wade was the player who really dominated during the Heat's lone Championship run<br>  <br>  Phoenix....Don't count on the Suns....all the addition of Shaq did was allow the Suns to get bounced in the first round of the Playoffs in 2008 and they may not even qualify this season....<br>  <br>  Which leaves the Lakers.... I have a hard time imagining someone with Shaq's body of work in LA..(3 championshps, and MVP, 3 Finals MVPS) going unrewarded by a franchise....it is not uncommon for NBA teams to burn bridges with their superstars..(i.e. Chicago/Jordan, Detroit/Isiah, Bird/Boston)....most NBA franchises demonstrate enough class to reward and to express some form of appreciation for producing 3 championships...so I expect the Lakers to do the right thing and to retire Shaq's #34 with the Purple and Gold...|`|UANpgVupaa	Shaq is a player with a ton of caliber  as you mentioned - however I am not all that excited about him. Never have been. There is so much hype around him (or was) that I forgot what kind of player he was. His burning bridges I would say puts him between a rock and a hard place. Not sure if any of the teams will retire his jersey. If you had to choose it would most likely be the Lakers. Yeah he didn't leave on the greatest not with Buss, but, all that behind him, the staples center will most likely take the honor of gracing their rafters with O'Neil jersey.|`|L66IcsuUaa	He'll most likely have his jersey retired in the Staples Center. If he keeps moving every time his team has a bad season, it might become an issue. But right now, I see him having his jersey retired by the Lakers, not sure about the Magics. <br>  <br>  With his abrupt departure with the Heats, I don't think he has a chance.

jDi063pQaa	There are so many different exercises that focus on a variety of abilities related to jumping. It's pretty complicated. I woudl suggest checking out this guy. He knows his stuff <a href="http://youtube.com/jumptrainer" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/jumptrainer</a>|`|SAKHbxrKaa	first you need to make stretch exercises 30 times|`|wDCfu9hGaa	What i do is stand on one foot on a ledge and bend my knee until my hanging foot is 1/2 inch off the ground. I do this +12 times each foot. another thing that i do is jump back and forth the basketball court with one foot, and i do it about 5 times each foot. Also i skip with a heavy object on my hands (medicine ball) back and forth the basketball court.  You can also run up and down a long stair skipping one step at each jump. you can put one foot on a ledge and with the other foot touching the ground you can jump, do +12 times each foot. jump continuously on one foot for +30 seconds, then switch. Lastly, you can do leg presses on a GYM.|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	You can try plyometrics aka jump training. you could probably download some videos off the internet cause its to long to explain all the exercises in it

cZ05mysLaa	i joined volleyball in 8th grade and i am now a freshmen. i got selected to be a swing player but my main team was junior varsity. i have also been selected to go to the far-east volleyball tournament ( far-east is a big deal where i live). now check that out. i did not know how to play volleyball at all last year and now a freshmen was able to go to far-east on only her 2nd year of playing volleyball. that means a lot of improvements has taken place. in order to become an even great volleyball player, you have to listen to what your coach tells you. never get frustrated with what others say. never think of yourself, but think of your team. if you can't get something right, stay cool and keep trying til you nail it. take practices seriously and have fun as well. observe closely on the techniques college level girls play. go to clinics or join an outside league. you make new friends and learn new moves. also try different positions too. all rounded players are the best.|`|iUbLQBHFaa	Great volleyball players really know the ins and out of the game. Great volleyball players are both athletic and intelligent. Play and watch a lot of volleyball. Watch players and teams that are better than you and learn from them and their decision making process. If the opposing team is making a strong side attack and you are playing middle back defense where are you behind the block? Learn every position of volleyball and the rules.<br>  <br>  Now that I got the public service annoucement out of the way I have two very good no fail tips.<br>  <br>  1. Footwork. <br>  Footwork may be the most important tool in a great vollyball players arsenal. Believe it or not you can just about cover the entire volleyball court in just two steps. "Drop step and crossover" usually done for passing to move back or side to side. Also, perfect your approach for attacking. I am right handed so I take one step with my right foot and take off with two feet. Depending on the set my footwork never changes just the timing. Also, you might benefit from looking at basketball. If you watch a basketball player making a chest pass to a teammate the footwork is strangely similar to a volleyball player passing to a setter. They are just more upright.<br>  <br>  2.Elbow<br>  Yes, I said elbow. Also, like basketball a great serve or hit is all about follow through. Have you ever seen a basketball player "pose" after making a shot? Well, it is not always about ego. Through the course of the serve or hit you should be making a "Z" or an "elephant' nose" then you follow through all the way down to your waist. I swear this is no fail you will be able to direct your ball anywhere and see a vast improvement. <br>  <br>  To learn this this method stand next to a wall with you feet, hips, and shoulders touching. I put my right arm straight behind my head as I make my pretend attack or serve. Leading with my elbow I drag my arm against the wall making the "elephant nose" and following through all the way down to my waist. When that feels like second nature  stand at the wall, shoulder still touching however, your arm will be behind your back. This will mimic the mechanics of the complete arm swing for both a serve and a hit. Doing this drill will allow you to place a ball anywhere on the court whether serving on hitting. <br>  <br>  I hope you get to where you want to be. Good Luck!|`|RY4PZ49Baa	i play volleyball too! i joined a local volleyball club and we practice twice a week and go to tournaments. Also, I have my own ball that i practice with in the summer, serving, bumping etc. Another thing i do is rent a volleyball court with a bunch of my friends and go play and practice with them! have fun!|`|GqsZigbXaa	Our coach puts a lot of emphasis on running so we don't get tired in a game and he has us do a lot of diving on the ground to get fast balls.  mostly he wants us to try our best to hit the ball.  if you try you get better, if you move out of the way youll never improve.|`|TMVHdNpbaa	when you have free time study a volleyball...memorize the ball inside out...lol....the point is get used to it so when you play a game you know where to hit it so it would go in....practice your serves on a gym wall, try hitting it harder and harder....good luck|`|hkzWWuSJaa	i was a volleyball player for the very first time this year. i was not very good. the way i improved my skills is i bought my own volleyball and i asked one of my family members to practice with me. then i kept doing hat everyday and i ended up getting better and better. so my advice would be keep on practicing even though it maybe frustrating never give up.
RPvNLrCaaa	Yes the Wings main problem is their goal tending. They will probably go into the playoffs with Conklin as their number one goalie. Conklin has been better than Osgood for most of the year however both goalies have let in to many soft goals.<br>  <br>  Even though goal tending is their main problem another problem they need to work on is their defense. They have way to many giveaways in their own zone. All of these giveaways lead to to many goals. They need to control the puck better in their own zone.|`|RplkclzJaa	3. They will be fine. They have plenty of time to straighten out their problems. i do think their biggest problem now is goaltending. I think Babcock is giving Osgood to many second chances instead of just putting on the bench and leaving Conklin in (Even though this doesn't explain that 8-0 game)|`|J9GWbyAvaa	Its Time to bring back Hasek.<br>  I can't blame Detroit management for not addressing the goaltending issue. Detroit felt they had their #1 in Osgood. Osgood has simply played badly.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Managements refusal to address the goaltending issue.|`|rX0DiVChaa	GOALTENDING.<br>  <br>  they lost today to Columbus 8 - 2. ew. <br>  <br>  theyre not going to go anywhere in the playoffs, without decent goalies.|`|Ul9rMdseaa	I think Defense and Goal tending|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	They can score. They can defend.<br>  <br>   IF they crumble, chances are it was goaltending that let them down. They could still be fine, perhaps one of their goalies gets hot at the right time (obviously what Holland was/is hoping) but I have my doubts.<br>  <br>   Plenty of time to straighten it out? This (goaltending issues) has been ongoing since Game #1 of the season! Time is not on their side. Them giving Osgood a personal leave was an indication that they realize this, it was also them coming to the realization that they are running out of time.....it's them hitting the panic button.<br>  <br>   Honestly, I am suprised they didn't pick someone up.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	if their goaltending goes to crap, they are such a great team, great defense, great offense, great pp kill, that they will be able to compensate other factors of the game to do well in the playoff and bring home the cup; conklin is playing great, but osgood needs to step it up
33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Randy Moss is the best WR in the NFL today, and has put the off-field issues behind him with the Patriots...<br>  <br>  Besides, Randy Moss is more talented than TO anyway...|`|MxHIdyVAaa	I'm gonna go ahead and get the boos right off the bat.  Marvin Harrison has had a better career than both of them.<br>  But statistically, i believe Randy Moss will finish his career with better numbers.  I don't really know though.<br>  I can't back these numbers up yet because i haven't looked, but is it peculiar that they all entered the league two years from one another and all finished with less than 70 receptions last year?  Moss is still a physical marvel, Terrell Owens still has the deep speed, and Marvin still has the hands.  But, have they all begun to lose what gave them the edge?  Randy Moss was the best all around athlete among the three.  Terrell Owens has always been more physical of the three.  And, Marvin Harrison (in my opinion) has best concentration and hands of any wide-receiver ever.  Marvin was an acrobat to the football but has never been able to take a hit.  As a matter of fact, in the Colts 2006 DVD, Marvin catches a go route in stride and runs out at the 2 to avoid contact.  Peyton would have even pushed for the pile-on?<br>  I'm ranting a little...  ANYWAYS.  If it's safe to blame Moss's numbers in '08 on Matt Cassel, Moss will sit at #2 amongst the recieving leaders.  That's my guess.  But, enter in Trent Edwards and maybe Terrell owens can revamp his career.<br>  As for Marvin, he'll end of retiring of wearing the black & silver.  I don't think he's really going to be padding his stats with JaMarcus Russell.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Probably Randy Moss.|`|M5ykrN4Laa	TO|`|HfNralgnaa	Randy.

AA11488609	Mason was the Cinderella story of 2006.  Since GMU is only about half an hour away from my house, I know a bit about them among the mid major teams around DC.  They were 2nd in the CAA this year in the regular season, VCU was the regular season champions led by Eric Maynor, who is expected to be a middle first round pick in the NBA Draft this year.  Anyway, they beat James Madison University, one of their rival schools today in the quarterfinals of the CAA tournament.  No CAA school really has a good enough resume to go in as an at large, so Mason will have to win the whole tourney in order to go dancing.  They're not even the favorite team, which is VCU this year.  Then again, they only played VCU once, on the road, and lost there..<br>  <br>  I don't see the Patriots going past the first round if they even win the CAA tournament, but then again, it's called march madness for a reason.<br>  <br>  Alabama and Xavier were the "quasi-cinderellas of '04", if there really were any since they overachieved in the dance...|`|bVbFAyzjaa	they may not even make the tournament this year unless they win their conference tournament|`|7bx2XQlqaa	that was their once-in-a-lifetime shot in 04.

Cl6KbcAGaa	That Mongoose is not that bad overall. Sorry to burst the bubble of the other answer but Suntour also makes those high end Marzochii shocks and forks too....Suntour has been doing it since 88' and they do it well even though I would rather have a Fox anything, starting with a suntour anything is fine until or unless you spend more for a better bike from the start. Cannondale is also owned by Pacific cycle and is in company with GT . Mongoose and schwinn are owned by the same Co. and are not really all that different. It is mostly just a name and the fact that schwinn and Mongoose put most of their low end junk in the dept stores and they have a bad rep because of that fact alone....Nothing wrong with either one of these. Cannondale has low end junk too....|`|aNlT1NRqaa	The worst Cannondale is better than Mongoose.

MxHIdyVAaa	you'll probably fit right in at full-back.  full-back is the only position on a football team that hasn't seemed to evolve with the rest of the game.  tight-ends becoming primarily receivers, etc.  For example, the Colts haven't had a full-back on their roster for two consecutive years since '04-'05 with James Mungro.  In '06 DT Dan Klecko played full-back.  Klecko actually caught a few TD's.  & in '08 the Colts used DT Darrell Reid as their FB.<br>  Full-backs receive very limited carries.  But, when they do theyre required to take and deliver some of the hardest hits in the game.  The objective of the full-back is to protect the weak side for the quarterback.  And, when possible, make blocks in the secondary for the running-back. <br>  ... ... thats it.<br>  Good luck.<br>  _________________________________<br>  actually, my comment about the position not evolving is a bit of a mis-statement.  full-back has seemed to de-evolve since games of the past.  in former years up until about the 80's, full-backs were utilized more frequently.  but, with the emerging utility of the much more athletic tight-end, FB's became ALMOST obsolete.  A "good full-back" could make a decent run at the pros.  But, to be a good full-back one must be fearless.<br>  _________________________________<br>  This one goes out to "football" :<br>  If you want to try and upstage someone, first off get the facts straight.  "weakside" & "blindside" are two totally different things.  Even then, the left tackle is only the blindside tackle to a right handed quarterback.  A fullback is not limited to only the free blitz on passing situations.  Certain plays (as with any other blocker) call for different blocking schemes.  Against a coverage defense, the fullbacks only objective may be to put a shoulder on an end rusher.  Typically, in a passing situation in which a running back does not run out of the back field, it is his job to seal the middle.  This is because he is unevenly matched with a defensive lineman that will normally be coming from the outside.<br>  It's funny you even brought up any name of a fullback.  The best known fullback still playing the game is Lorenzo Neal (up and coming is Le'Ron McClain) .  In the 16 active years Neal has spent in the NFL as a mammoth FB, he has only touched the football 420 times.  That includes both rushing and recieving.  Ladainian Tomlinson at one time was carrying the ball 320+ times a year.<br>  There have been many great fullbacks to play the game, i.e. Mike Alstott or Larry Csonka, but it isn't a "skill position" .  Fullback requires basic objective in any game situation.  Execution is what makes a fullback great.<br>  As far as Indianapolis is concerned.  One year with poor rushing averages doesn't justify a bad scheme.  It just points to the simple fact that for a stretch of 4 games, the Colts had 5 active offensive lineman (5 being the required bare minimum) including two rookies & an active practice squader.  In todays game, "opening holes" for a running back sometimes only requires a great WR tandem and the best QB to back up linebackers.  But, for a team that is primarily a running offense, a FB sometimes helps to spread the gaps.  I don't want to discourage you because in high school and collegiant football, fullbacks play a larger role.  But, in the NFL they sometimes turn out like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuWYJ6LFx20" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuWYJ6LFx...</a>|`|JNTQwvtTaa	The position of fullback has not de evolved. Although in Indianapolis it has, as the Colts cannot gain any yardage on the ground if their lives depended on it. If Indy is in a 3rd and 12 situation, no problem. But 3rd and inches and the Colts are done.<br>  <br>  Do you know why? because they think a player at 215 pounds like James Mungro is a proper fullback. The Colts beleive (wrongly) that they can pass their way out of a smashmouth situation they should be running out of.<br>  <br>  The fullback also does not soley protect a QBs blindside. This job falls on the Left Tackle. This is why left tackles make so much more money than the remainder of the offensive line. The reason the position of fullback seems so obscure is that it has become highly specialized.<br>  <br>  A fullbacks primary function is to neutralize  Mike, or the Middle Linebacker, a player so difficult to control his own teammates often avoid him. Teams will call on the fullback to often pave the way for the  feature running back, the squad's star ground gainer.. He will carry the football, receive all of the praise, get his picture in the sports section and take the prettiest girl to the prom.<br>  <br>  You will be a bulldozer and simply clear the way for his glory. Your reward will not be a hot blonde haired cheer leader. No, your date on Friday night will be a load of muscle, bone and intensity staring back at you from across the line of scrimmage from the Mike linebacker spot.<br>  <br>  Can you handle it? You want to watch that quitting thing you have going on there.<br>  <br>  Google the names Dan Kreider, Mack Strong, Lorenzo Neal and the massive New York Giant fullback Madison Hedgecock, who at 6' 3" and 266 pounds, is roughly the size of a guard.<br>  <br>  The fullback is alive and well.|`|mmTwQtMLaa	Hopefully you're already a good blocker. if you're not, then stick with the person you're blocking, no matter what. If you're already a good blocker, then let's move on to the football holding. If you're going to get a handoff, right when you get the ball, you have 2 choices on how to hold the ball. the first option is... 1. Hold the end of the football with your right/left hand. Then if your forearm is big enough, place the other end on the opposite side of your elbow. This could force a fumble if you're not careful. 2. Hold the end of the football with your right/left hand. Place the end in your armpit and run. This is a bit easier way to carry the ball, as it doesn't cause many fumbles if you are careful.|`|QXhIRvgLaa	well just know that u can always give 100percent if u try ur best

yuGhmhGuaa	What the heck!!!|`|T0FTAeDoaa	nice football question
GyGhHpRraa	If you are a Senators fan, then you should be VERY happy with the trades they made this year. Did you see how good Leclaire's numbers were last year?  It was almost the same as what Mason put up so far on a less talented team.  <br>  <br>  And Campoli?  At the beginning of the year, I stated to many folks that this kid is a diamond in the rough (Diamond meaning Campoli and the "Rough" meaning the New York Islanders) and how the Sens should pick him up.  Now, by pure luck, the Sens did land him (Eat your heart out, Eklund!) and have had a great record since.<br>  <br>  Overall:  The Senators are FINALLY on the right path and I am very excited to see them hit winning numbers again!|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	What is the question exactly? I am a few beers in and having a hard time deciphering your question.<br>  <br>   EDIT- OK. In all fairness....aside from your question headline, the additional info is mumbo jumbo.....doesn't make a lick of sense. :)<br>  <br>   The next Toronto.....what is the comparison based upon? That they won tonight after the deadline and are being a spoiler? Since their coaching change, they are something like 8-5-3 (?) so them winning isn't a shocker.<br>  <br>   Do you mean in their roster make-up? Doesn't really jive either since Ottawa has a nucleus, something Toronto has not had in some time. Any time you can have a top line of Heatley, Alfredsson and Spezza then you have something to start with. Toronto sports no players on their roster as good as any of these 3. It is their supporting cast that has failed them!<br>  <br>    I think I just cracked the code......your comparison stems from the fact that Toronto got Toskala from SJ (was in more of a platoon than a back-up....regular season anyways) and Ottawa now gets Leclaire (who lost his job to a rookie sensation....I think because he went down to injury)...............<br>  <br>   Nope, Ottawa is not the next Toronto.<br>  <br>  <br>   You are probably right. They don't blow the team up......HOWEVER, I would not be shocked to see one of the big 3 moved to get some depth (but I don't expect it).|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	So you've gone through 15 months of agony as opposed to the 42 years of suffering here in Hogtown.  Yup, no comparison there.<br>  <br>  And still...whenever Ottawa hosts the Leafs half the crowd is wearing blue and white.<br>  <br>  The Leafs have actually said "okay, we're rebuilding".  Briansh Murraysh...what exactly is his plan?  Love that lisp though.  It's so funny that at the start of last season the Ottawa fans were full of themselves, and now...not so much.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Bob, cdn24fan..............even NHL Central Scouting has Spezza ranked in the top 20!  He was also a very popular player at the trade deadline and could have become a Flyer!  So it's not just me.  He's just having a bad year is all (a real bad year)!<br>  <br>  As for Ottawa, the team has underacheived greatly.  Just about everybody in hockey circles thinks they should be a lot better than they are.  So, it's not just Sens management that is dumbfounded, it's most of the NHL (except Adam Mair who thinks Ottawa overachieved for 12 years).<br>  <br>  As for the goaltending issue....Leclaire is a bona fide #1 goaltender.  However, while he was injured this year (He started 7 of Columbus' first 8 games, then suffered an injury is that 7th game), another goaltender stole the show and took over the number one reins.   If Leclaire doesn't get injured, he's probably still #1|`|AA11674745	I can understand why you think so. Hell, if I was a Sens fan, I'd be ripping them at every opportunity. This years team - any injuries aside - should be doing better than last year.<br>  <br>  That debacle that cost Paddock his job has proven to be beyond the coaches fault. This is a team-wide intestinal fortitude problem provided by the management that assembled this roster.<br>  <br>  I could almost agree that they are the next TML, but I doubt the Sens (or any other team) would be comfortable matching even half of the Leafs ineptude since 1967.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	I don't know if Murray is that much worse than John Ferguson Jr. But dammit, he sure looks like it from where I'm sitting. While Toskala hasn't looked great he has been playing hurt and still looks better than the Sen's revolving door of goalies.<br>  Awfully hard to compare these two teams. Ottawa has more talent but no heart. You can trade talent for players with heart but probably going to get less talented players in return. In Toronto, we have a couple good defenders that we can trade and a fine collection of third line forewards. And some fourth line guys. They do put in an effort though, on most nights. The problem is we can't get a top line foreward for someone who wouldn't crack the top six on most teams so, it's draft smart or free agents. We are not going to gain much through trades with the exception of Kaberle and Kubina which leaves a huge void on defence. <br>  Ottawa just needs to tweak and tune, a much more enviable position that the Leafs. And replace Murray before he drowns somebody in spit.|`|lYnkvRASaa	I was at that game tonight, Sens role players played well.  Spezza is the biggest waste of 8M a year ever.<br>  <br>   Stupid penalties, unwilling to take a hit so he gives the puck away constantly.  He looked uninterested.  It was easy to see who was playing for jobs tonight.  Can't blow the team up as I doubt you could get much for Spezza with 4 years left at 8M per.<br>  <br>  Elliot played well except the third goal, Foligno, Kelly and Ryan Shannon looked good.<br>  <br>  Buffalo playing back to back looked tired.  <br>  <br>  Murray is the problem with that team, he gave the big $$ to the wrong guys and stripped what was a good defense.<br>  <br>  Bob, I was a Sens fan tonight since the Habs need Buffalo losses.  Spezza's shifts I would watch him exclusively, he avoids contact like the plague.  He is fine carrying the puck up the middle but as soon as his feet stop moving or he gets pinched near the  boards and might get hit he coughs up the puck. ( tonight at least)  when he doesn't have the puck he in the defensive zone he doesn't get too engaged.  The most talented guy on the ice tonight but he he seems to be trying to become the next Alex Kovalev.  Actually I think Kovalev cares, not sure he does.  Too much money too soon?<br>  <br>  Lity: Talent top 20 easy, maybe higher.  Effort and intensity what I have seen this year would scare me if I was Sens mgmt.  I have watched him live twice this year where I can watch him away from the puck etc and I have not been impressed.  I have also watched maybe a dozen other sens games.  Not as much as you or the scouts but this guy worries me.  He just doesn't seem interested or engaged.  Tonight on at least 5-6 occasions he passed up on making a play where he was gonna get hit, even worse on half of them he gives the puck away with a soft pass rather than dumping it deep.  The talent and potential is there but he needs to grow up and soon.  He's still young but so are Crosby, Richards and Carter- they don't avoid the traffic.<br>  <br>  Take him away from Heatly and Alfredsson and he seems to sulk.  At 8M - not worth the risk.|`|33cd510071aa809f2f5d7ecebf06b3c4aa	I've been a platinum season ticket holder for the Sens for 9 years now, I don't think you could be any farther from the truth.|`|SfTWwm97aa	^^ Lmao

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Buying your own bat is a very good idea. If you are playing high school ball you must purchase the fast pitch bat, the other would be illegal and removed by the umpire upon seeing it. Good advice....the best thing anybody can tell you is to make sure you get proper feel and the right - (minus is the length minus the weight, in high school a good ratio for a bigger, stronger girl is around a -10). But that is just a general rule, you have to decide whether or not that ratio feels good to you. Some will go as much as -13 just because they feel they can generate better bat speed. Again this is based totally on ones preference but at 5'7" I would suggest something along the lines of a 33" bat so try out a 33" with a -10 and go from there. Ask your local sporting goods store if you are unsure of the minus ratio or bat length, they can show you the guidelines.|`|uDDsWEAraa	for high school fastpitch u have to have a fastpitch bat<br>  for ur height i think a 33 inch bat would be pretty good<br>  i'm about 5 8 and i use a 33 24 anderson rockettech and i love it<br>  easton stealth's (and synergy's) also seem like pretty good bats and a lot of ppl like them<br>  no matter what u get, i would get a composite bat bc the ball comes off them a lot better than an aluminum (or whatever alloy) bat<br>  i would definitely recommend u get ur own bat, it'll help when u want to take it home to practice.  u'll also be able to get used to it and feel comfortable with it.  i'm a senior in hs and the 3 yrs ive been on varsity everyone has had their own bat|`|hMo9z0TSaa	The weight...you have to put one arm out and hold the bat out and make it go in a circle or 1 minute and your arm has to be straight.

etErp8rcaa	They do the "sudden death overtime until someone scores" in the playoffs, but I don't think it's necessary in the regular season. That being said, I'm not really a shootout fan. I was perfectly happy with five minutes of OT, and a tie being the result if no one scores. This also gets rid of these dumb 3-point games.|`|MX4AlD6daa	i too am not a big fan of the nhl shootout either the way it is. i think instead of a 3 round shootout it should be 5 like the olympics. a 3 round shootout is waaaaay too short and it isnt much fun to see a game decided in 2 shots which is possible with the current setup. i dont think 4 on 4 will be brought back nor do i think it is exciting, but why hasnt anyone in the nhl committee thought of 3 ON 3! imagine how exciting that would be, breakaways, huge saves, long burst passes and you would see a lot of quality shots,|`|RPvNLrCaaa	Shootouts are fun to watch but are a dumb way to decide a winner. They should go into a 4 on 4 sudden death overtime and if at the end of that no one won then the game ends in a tie where both teams get a point. A team should not get a point just because the made it to overtime. If a team wins in OT then they get the two points. This gets rid of the three point games and wont cause games to go into like triple overtime games when a team might have to play the next day and have an unfair disadvantage because they played into triple OT the night before.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Too many of them? I barely ever see shootouts in the nhl. They are a rare thing. It isn't like they are happening ever single game. Maybe every 15-30 games. Maybe. But do you know how tiring a 4th period would be?(minus the 5 minutes). Not to mention a 5th period or more. In the regular season players need as much rest as possible and at most they are going to play for 65 minutes. Now in the playoffs it's a different story cuz well that's just the playoffs and teams are playing for the cup and a simple shootout shouldn't decide a game of that importance.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Still sitting on the fence about the shootout. I guess its nice that the team that wins gets 2 points, but if you lose you still get a " feel good point"? That I can't stand. I'd rather see ties than that politically correct "feel good point" going to a team that lost.

oeQVK0cmaa	I agree! I am sold aswell, no need for a UFC countdown show or primetime series. That was the way to hype up a fight! I cant wait!<br>  <br>  Rashad via KO rnd 2!|`|CnNAOoWgaa	That was one of the coolest, funniest things I've ever seen in the UFC and I've been watching for years.  One of the greatest moments in UFC history for sure!  And they weren't even fighting!  Seriously though, Dana should allow that stuff to happen more often and unlike WWE, that trash talk and animosity was 100% real.  No acting there!  And as long as there's nothing fake about it and no one's dumb enough to start throwing, I see nothing wrong with allowing it to happen.|`|fWWHMDWQaa	I thought they were gonna throw down right there. Rampage is such a great trash talker like Joe Rogan said. I could see him as a stand up comic . Just get who ever he's going to fight next and pay the guy not to do anything but just sit there and stare at Rampage and hand Rampage a microphone.|`|moa4kjSFaa	LOL nope <br>  rampage|`|9b5QUw2eaa	That conversation made me think of a question Mr. Pink asked on Reservoir Dogs - but I digress.  I don't like the whole WWF look of the thing, but those are two of my favorite fighters.<br>  <br>  I might lean a little more toward Rampage winning because he is so difficult to ground and pound, and ground and pound is Sugar's primary go-to strategy.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	....Is the question wow yes or wow no? (Shoot, now I won't get the best answer.)  No serious, am I the only one who wants to see a line by line written statement about what they said?

This will be sanctioned by the  Yankee front office, and all Yankee fans that use the term "he is a true Yankee". See you at Cooperstown at this beautiful ceremony. There will not be a dry eye in the house.|`|hMkb7H31aa	A dunce cap with the Canadian Beaver logo|`|wmYnJd2jaa	He's going to be pictured in a Winnipeg Jets helmet.<br>  <br>  You know, the way they talk about Stubby on sports telecasts here in the Great White North, you might actually think this is true.|`|qy8czfnCaa	Cardinals. :)
svU3xeotaa	no absolutely not, i think its stupid, whats the point of having money and not spending it on players from different countries, sapp blater and that stupid French men are trying to ruin the beautiful game. leave the game the way it is and move on.<br>  <br>  first it was the video replay, then it was about how much clubs should spend, and now this stupid rule.<br>  <br>  seriously blater must resign, or he will ruin the game.|`|aEntHSbqaa	At first it sounded like a good plan to develop the national team. Teams like England could benefit from this plan as it would give greater exposure and options to the english internationals, but as it would greatly benefit the big countries with big leagues it would be a disaster for smaller countries. Clubs like Man Utd wouldn't buy players like Park Ji Sung anymore or even Fletcher or Oshea. Arsenal wouldn't give chances to small African countries with players like Sagna or Eboue.|`|YbOGOnroaa	The idea is good but it's a bit too quick to be doing 6 + 5. I think FIFA should do things slowly. Some teams like Liverpool and Arsenal may have to sell many World Class players to adapt to this format. It takes a long time to rebuild a team when you sell good players. So I think it should start with something small like 9 + 2 or 8  + 3|`|YuAndWj6aa	Nope. I completely disagree with that rule. Look at the EPL, how many clubs in there put in more than 3-4 english players? For one, it helps develop players from other countries, and establishing good international players.<br>  Secondly,if English players were truly good, we wouldn't need to import so many foreign players. The stupid 6+5 ruling only jacks up the price for local players.<br>  The English FA would not allow it. the amount of money they receive from sponsorships and TV deals is huge. If I were the clubs, I'd break away and form our own Super League.<br>  So, like all of Sepp's idea, its ****.<br>  It doesn't improve the game in any way... Thats what FIFA's rules are for... Not for fun|`|pZvDvI6taa	When this rule voice out , I strongly disagree with it. Because I'm an Arsenal fans and everyone know Arsenal have just few Englishman in the team. But now, I'm agree but not at all, I think it should change to 1st eleven can't have too many players from same country except the national of the league. Look at Arsenal, there are too many Frenchmen in there , Arsene Wenger always sacrifice other countries players for Frenchmen, for example: Arsenal's line-up have 4 France defender against Man Utd and Kolo Toure is sacrifice for Silvestre. It is worse. Arsene Wenger is terrible !!!|`|7kCeVLNlaa	Its not that bad idea. When you look at Arsenal when Walcott isn't fit what other English player do they have in there team. Although it will make the price of English players sky high and the quality of the league will go down. But don't we all want the English national team to improve? And why is Blatter still in his job??? He is a lemon. What happened about the goaline technolodgy. I think he is doing this partly because us English are dominating world football. He wouldnt do this if the French were like us. And lets also follow Rugby League and get a salary cap. I'm a Manchester City fan through and through, but the wages we were offering Kaka were absolutley ridiculous. ￡500,000 a week. <br>  MY ****!!!|`|OYYYNCyCaa	i have to disagree with K9* ManUnitedFan this will help the english players get a game, in 10 years we will wonder what all the fuss was about <br>  <br>  But i do agree with K9* ManUnitedFan that Sepp Blatter should resign he is a goose and Michel Platini should shut the hell up|`|o7gV56ngaa	I think what people are forgetting is that this proposal may be contrary to EU law. Are FIFA going to impose this quota on every country? If not i can't see the top English clubs accepting it. It will be interesting to see how things pan out.
bmoCpcdraa	yes, and if it weren't for teenagers it would be less.we should keep them doctors away from guns, for sure,|`|O3TuQZItaa	Now throw out the numbers caused by the gang bangers, and you will find that more people die from choking on a sandwich from Subway than from an accidental shooting.|`|2YhRMcCAaa	Sounds about right to me. <br>  They won't give this statistic on the ABC nightly news.......................|`|BCnxWpUTaa	I wish everyone knew this.
DBSaeDaFaa	They will always have a chance if Fleury  can become consistent, which he has been lately. Also, they seem like a much tougher team after sHero added Guerin and Kunitz at the trade deadline for grit. I'm not sure yet how they would match up against Boston or the Devils, but they seem to be turning their season around with this five game winning streak. If they win in Washington today, I would say they have a legitimate chance to at least get to the eastern conference finals.|`|CNKBGVgQaa	Defidently, they have won 5 straight and are climbing up the standings. Theres still a long time until the playoffs and we will be fine. With the addition of Kunitz, our offense is even better. Sad to say, but they are turning it around with the addition of the new coach.<br>  <br>  The last 4 spots are taken by teams with either 74, 75, or 76 points, meaning the standings change with each game. If the pens win today against Washington, they will shoot up to the 6th spot and tied for 5th. It's still day to day. A couple of days ago we were 8th, now were ninth, so the standings are day-to-day.<br>  <br>  As long as we get to the playoffs, we will be fine. Pittsburgh was a mad house during last years playoffs, and the players will feel it. We defidently have a chance this year.|`|GyGhHpRraa	The Penguins have the Flyers, Bruins, and Devils to worry about in their conference alone.  If they do happen to beat one of them, they should worry about the Flames, Sharks, and Red Wings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Therefore, chances that Pittsburgh to make it to the Cup?<br>  <br>  1 out of 1000<br>  <br>  To win the cup?<br>  <br>  Almost impossible|`|m2k4yaOaaa	Nope. Sorry. Actually, I'm not sorry..|`|fbG7kjynaa	They do have a chance, but they need to get things straight - which they have been, lately. But, it's the same as everything. Most every team right now technically *can* come back and win, depending on the performance of the other teams.|`|EkgZeAbqaa	with sid and geno we have a chance every year|`|SfTWwm97aa	I don't believe so. Sorry.<br>  <br>  **Lmao at Troll Sammy.|`|Cqe1uWtbaa	No, I don't think so... They lost their grit from players like Malone, and skill of hossa. Sure they have sid and geno, but two players can't make the difference. Their whole team has to come together and mesh with billy guerin|`|pChoen9haa	No.

oSakZ1asaa	You only need 1-2 drops per 500 shots. A third drop of oil on the patch you clean the barrel with. run a dry patch down the barrel to get some oil (and junk) out.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	it gums up the seats and seals and can cause detenation. needs only a drop or 2 every couple hundred shots.|`|9Djep77Vaa	any dirt/dust that comes by an over-oiled anything (not just a gun) can collect a mess and be very frustrating.

The key will be on how well the Bench plays because they have been on and off lately.|`|6UUCCImVaa	i think it is going to be tough especially in portland because they havent won their in a couple of years but i know they can do it if they want to.|`|ZKtvJ8INaa	tough tough games, but the Lakers are rested and I think they can do it. We blowout the Spurs the last time and we've beaten the rockets and portland twice this season.|`|2jeoQpuCaa	3-0 or 2-1 I'm fine if the Lakers finish that road trip with a winning record and I think they can do it because they are the best team right now.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Lakers will go 3-0! sweep that roadtrip!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	yes we can...|`|7e6Vm4cDaa	I think they can go 3-0 and the keys of the game will the bench and the play of Pau and LO. I remember the 6 game road trip where the Lakers finished 6-0 the bench played well and LO & Pau responded.|`|3PWXaOgjaa	It's going to be tough but I think the Lakers can, they also had alot of rest this week.

kDjDfk05aa	Im torn. I'm from Buffalo so granted I like the Bills, but my hearts always been in Dallas. So without a doubt I'm thrilled to see him go, but to stab me in the heart again and move to Buffalo...ugh<br>  <br>  Though, given Trents lack of experience and Evans willingness to step aside..at least for the moment, this combination for T.O. may work out. However, if Trents lack of experience back fires, well lets just prepare ourselves for the old T.O. again|`|pj8GnPUoaa	i love the fact its only for a year. look at what buffalo is going through financially as an organization. if he doesnt help the team he helps the franchise in ticket sales and merch but when you look at the solid core we have hes an excellent fit. look at the 90's we had andre reed and don beebe who were the young guys and james lofton as the vet. i think it was a great move considering other moves in the afc east.|`|paIUgtLRaa	I suspect the suicide hotlines in Buffalo are lighting up right about now. They might want to start giving away anti-depressants any time.<br>  <br>  Not a Buffalo Bills fan, but they have to wait until the 2011 season to start cheering.|`|GxGsJixoaa	i think it will fit the bills nice. unlike san fran, philly, and dallas the bills signed him to one year so i don't think that he will have the troubles with team members as he did with the other teams.|`|VQPgNedQaa	I am very excited. I feel we have either the best or second best  (behind cardianls) reciving core in the NFL|`|cL6CWj2waa	very cool, finally a place where T.O can get more attention from quarterback Trent Edwards.<br>  <br>  T.O, is a good dude|`|ib5nNdsWaa	Instantaneous regret|`|kxMDFPnbaa	i feel like VH1 is going to ask us if we want our own show now|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	More and more excited as I think about it. It's a 1-year deal with no strings attached. He acts up and he's gone.

acc06e32aa1b61885e803d0885de8de2aa	If you really want one and can afford it.. go for it. <br>  Personally I'd never pay that much for a WASR-10. <br>  Before the election they went for about half that... and that's about all they're worth.<br>  <br>  They're pretty cheaply made and inaccurate even for an AK. They will go bang... so I guess they're good for something. Unless you have some 7.62x39 stockpiled.

1ba4117e21f3ec675a8aaa421899d3d4aa	I think you will win your league, Your team is a 9 or a 10, I don't know how you got those guys but your batting is really good, I think you need a SB guy and maybe another average guy, <br>  <br>     As for your Pitchers, I love the Giants but i might wanna trade Brian Wilson and try to get like Kerry Wood or another closer of that sort because Wilson does get rocked.<br>  <br>    As for the trade, Keep what you got, Don't give your best pitcher and a good outfielder for a handful a guys, You need Bay and Webb will get you alot of wins.

And it's traditional that big bowl games happen around New Year's, and the BCS games are the big ones now.|`|kuh7CfcSaa	The Money answer is on the money.<br>  <br>  It is because they want the games played when most people will have the opportunity to watch....so more ad dollars.<br>  <br>  During the holiday break is when most people will make time to watch the games.<br>  <br>  Play them before the year is out and a lot of people will be busy working on closing out the year...not enough time to take in the game.  But play it at the beginning of the year, after previous year is closed out and more people will be relaxed enough to take in the game.|`|KyShUk8kaa	It's all about money. The other bowl games before the BCS can earn more in ad revenue because they are the only games on TV. This process maximizes NCAA revenues. It's a shame that we can never see teams go at head to head in the championship game while they are still in the flow of the season. Three weeks off has to mess with teams that are hot ending the season.

I think it's a big gamble for Buffalo and it will be just a matter of time before TO starts cryin' that they're not throwin' to him.<br>  The Patriots would benefit with a playmaker RB to open up the offense and give Brady/Moss some breathing room.|`|kuh7CfcSaa	I thought it was going to happen.  Thought T.O. would sign for the minimum for a chance at a ring with the Pats.<br>  <br>  Very surprised he went to the Bills.<br>  <br>  Thought we would finally see Randy and T.O. together.   While I am not a Pats fan...just seeing those guys together would have been great.<br>  <br>  I will always think of Randy as the better receiver...hell, I think of him as the best ever.  Not a big T.O. fan, but would have liked to have seen what they could do together.|`|8A6n1AXLaa	dont worry because i have a feeling that the pats will pick a reciever for their first round pick  <br>  i say pats 2009-2010 superbowl champs?|`|KvyS9QuAaa	First off i want to say im a Vikings fan so dont think i like the saints...BUT i thought it would be nice for TO to go to new orleans.

Glad minnesota didnt get him cuz Childress was with him in the Eagles era.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	ohh yeah T.O. will be the player to beat when the patriots come to town! what a mistake  for them  not to sign T.O.|`|MxHIdyVAaa	Randy Moss dislikes Terrell Owens.<br>  <br>  Bill Bellichek only employs players who know how to listen to a coach.<br>  <br>  Terrell Owens would be a waste of space in New England.
6ZXovFOPaa	That guys funny... :)<br>  <br>  And I'm not gonna say that that's a bad offseason at all, but how can you say that the Yankees didn't have the best offseason?<br>  <br>  We got the 2 top Free Agent Pitchers (CC Sabathia and AJ Burnett), the top position player Free Agent (Mark Teixeira), and Nick Swisher, who is on the same level as the players you've listed.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	so they still suck|`|yererDcnaa	haha, yea i agree. the yanks do look like a team made in a video game where FAIR TRADES was turned off. haha<br>  <br>  back to the questions, the a's did not have the best offseason of all teams, but this is the best off season the a's have had for as long as i can remember. im hoping for the best for my boys this year. hopefully they are competing and wont trade all the big name players away like they always do. but for some reason i have a gut feeling that a few of them will be dressed in a different teams uniform before the regular season is over.|`|pEbFh5uXaa	yeah the yankees are ridiculous. it looks like a 5 year old built them by playing mlb the show and trading for all the superstars he could, like a fantasy team almost.<br>  <br>  the a's were smart to add holliday early and cabrera on the cheap.<br>  <br>  nomah is a right handed bat who can come off the bench and hit with two strikes, and play utility if while giambi i think is past it, but may get 20 hr's, maybe.<br>  <br>  i like the a's|`|gUbzHOnmaa	The A's did better than the Yankees or the Mets. The A's didn't have to add pitching like the Yanks did and when Sabathia and Burnett get shelved for the season the Yanks again don't make the playoffs. As for the Mets K-Rod isn't going to do well in New York and Putz might be able to take his place though. <br>  <br>  The A's did something they needed to do and that is upgrade the offense and get a consistent hitting short stop. The A's will compete and should win the AL West this year.

AA12181737	There's really no upside to Jim Thome.  He can get give you 32 homers, which is serviceable if you don't have power from anyone else, but for a bench player I'd look for a good sleeper pick with upside and a good batting average.  A player with a high average will never hurt your team.  Also, you want your reserve players to help in case of an injury.  Thome doesn't play any position so he's really narrow in how he can help.|`|aGAX9Nqyaa	He'll get you some homers|`|cCIQdtlmaa	He's not worth owning.

Shaq had his way with us last meeting, of course there was no bynum but its still a bad matchup.  <br>  <br>  Im confident we could beat either team within 4 games, probably a sweep.  But I'd rather see Dallas.<br>  <br>  I honestly think the Suns won't even make the playoffs anyway.  There ninth in the West right now and I just don't see them improving enough to make a run.

Everyone should jump on the bandwagon of the WINNINGEST TEAM IN ALL of PROFESSIONAL SPORTS: the ever incredible SAN ANTONIO SPURS. Call 'em what you want, the records and numbers call them THE BEST. Sorry Lakers fans, but what have the "wack azz" Lakers done the last six years? Go 0-2 in the finals, run out the only guy who had heart on that squad and watch him win a title with a sidekick who has more heart than Kobe. Big phuckin whoop. Shaq and the Glory days ain't comin back, the Lakers are the new era TrailBlazers or Kings teams they used to beat on, alot of hype, some regular season substance, but ultimately someone has their punk card. <br>  <br>  I can't understand why you Lakers fans still walk around and boast like it's 2002 again, or like the Lakers have been the Spurs for the past five years. They don't have any bigs with heart, Kobe has matured, but where's his heart? Probably up Shaq's ***, that's why he knows how it tastes.

LUnscegvaa	Mae geri ( front kick )<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|gBO908P6aa	The kick that has consistently done the most damage and has the highest KO rate is the Thai round kick, as opposed to just a generic roundhouse kick found in many styles.  In terms of physics, this kick may be the strongest and most damaging of them all simply because of the way it is thrown and the striking surface it uses.<br>  <br>  This type of round kick has been known to bruise, break bones, knock out and on rare occasions even result in the death of an opponent.  <br>  <br>  Studies done in the past on the Thai round kick showed peak forces reaching well over 6700N or over 1500lbs of force.<br>  <br>  National Geographic's Fight Science had also featured a segment where they measured Bas Rutten's "MMA Kick" on a dummy.  This "MMA kick" was none other than a Thai round kick.  Needless to say, they came up with some appalling results.<br>  <br>  The Thai round kick draws its power from the violent torque of the hips and the way the leg is swung with maximum penetration into and through the target.  <br>  <br>  Unlike an ordinary roundhouse, the Thai round kick uses the shin bone, conditioned to be hard as steel, to club an opponent into submission.  The kick is so damaging and effective it is the only kick delivered consistently by Thai boxers and has been widely adopted by MMA fighters everywhere.|`|nRBC4E5saa	The effectiveness of a kick depends on a number of variables.  The most effective kick for one situation would not be the most effective for another.<br>  <br>  The spinning back/side kick is probably the strongest.  The spin builds up momentum, and the muscles of the glutes and quads help to power it.  It's very easy to get your entire mass behind the kick as well.  However, it requires a higher than average degree of skill, and the window of opportunity for using it is quite small.  At best it's a niche kick.  I only use it when I miss another kick and the opponent is backing up.<br>  <br>  The most utilitarian kick is probably the roundhouse kick.  It's used the most, so it has the highest KO rate.  It can be used from long and short range, and aimed at just about any target from the temple to the ankle.  It also fits into combinations better than most other kicks.  If you're only going to learn one kick, make it the roundhouse kick.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	Through experience, round house kicks are pretty useful but they're also predictable--because they're the most used and well known. If you know how to do side-kicks really well (and they're hard to master for yourself.) you can not only surprise your opponent but all of your other kicks will be more flexible and faster. I've taken muay thai for a few years but surprisingly another martial arts is helping me with more speed and accuracy, and that's TKD (no branches of WTF or ITF).|`|CdAE4nXcaa	round house kick to the legs is so devastating and has highest ko rate in mma and pro kickboxing. on national geographic they had a show on that brought many different styles of martial arts and tested their kicks on a force meter and round house won. so round house to the legs, and head.|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Roundhouse kick is what I think.  It's actually been seen in UFC and other promotions..I dont know about other kicks..most effective are the shin kicks.  You kick your opponents shins and you slow him down and his legs give out.|`|riQ24gKWaa	roundhse is powerful but is obvious<br>  spinning hook is the best for countering and knocking out<br>  axe kick is good to bring the guy to the mat <br>  pushing to knock out ( i saw it on youtube)<br>  as long as you know how to execute the kick properly, its the most powerful, deadly and effective|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Bujutsu<br>  <br>  Hardest hitting Kick i think would be the spinning back kick.<br>  <br>  most effective i think would be a front snap kick and round house both stiking low.<br>  <br>  Most damage and knock outs i think its hiza the knee.|`|W0NpcICwaa	spinning back kicks are most powerful but it needs a lot of space and time<br>  roundhouse kicks or knee kicks are very effective and powerful also.<br>  these dont need so much space.|`|SfTWwm97aa	I like the spin back kick to the chest/solar plexus, or the Spin hook kick (focus heel of the foot) to the head... both devastating if you can land them.|`|atbeJLAiaa	crocop's headkick!
FUoKu13Daa	I do not think teams and managers are living for the Lakers,<br>  <br>  Last year I believe teams did try to build their front court to defend against the two headed monster in Gasol and Bynum and teams were trying to make themselves better <br>  <br>  This year it is about putting aces in their places,  Garnett is out for 2-3 weeks and we do not know how this injury is going to pan out so they did go out and get Moore to fill in but you also have to realize they loss James Posey who was huge for the Celtics last year,<br>  <br>  The Cavs pretty much loss Wallace until almost the playoff so they had to get someone to pretty much replace him and that injury also do not know how well it will heal,<br>  <br>  San Antonio been looking for help to get Duncan more rest but Gooden is not playing yet but like I said their hope is on a rested Duncan,  <br>  <br>  and New Orleans is basically trying to save money,<br>  <br>  If you have not noticed a lot of teams are dumping salaries and the proposed trade for Wilcox and smith was  more to lessen their payroll and not necessarily to  compete with the Lakers.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Last season that was the case, when Lakers got Gasol suddenly alot of teams make some trade moves, don't forget Wallace to the Cavs too.<br>  <br>  But this season I don't think it's because of the Lakers only. I think it's because those other teams needed to add players to get better.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	No matter who they bring in, Lakers are on a mission. Come playoff time nobody can match up with the Lakers bench and nobody can stop Kobe in crunch time. These late signings will only give the starters a short rest, they are no threat on the court.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	hhhahaha. <br>  <br>  Some of you Laker fans, you guys think everything's about you, and your Lakers. <br>  <br>  Ignorant. <br>  <br>  Edit: If the Cavs truely were to panic, we would have made that trade for Shaq, but Ferry didn't push for it.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Phoenix made the Shaq move because they realized they couldn't match up with Duncan and the Spurs.  The Kidd trade was probably made to mach up with LA, and you can characterize both of those as panic moves.<br>  <br>  The Marbury signing was a bit of a gamble by the Celtics, but they didn't give up anything to get him.  The Chandler trade was a salary cap move, not something New Orleans was doing to try and match up with LA.  Smith and Gooden were free agents when they were signed.  There was no risk involved.<br>  <br>  So one or two moves that can be attributed to LA, but hardly wholesale panic by the rest of the league.  Teams sign free agents every year, there's nothing special about this one.|`|AA11179568	i think so<br>  the other teams in the west knows they are not enough<br>  im  a spurs fan<br>  and i believe they are not enough as of now<br>  but im looking forward and is exited<br>  if gooden<br>  he may be the missing piece<br>  i believe that the spurs just need that missing piece to beat LA<br>  hope gooden would be the one|`|fz77R5Jmaa	ya but they all fail if Bynum is to play in this year's playoffs  : )<br>  <br>  the New Orleans one kinda didnt make sense....i know it was for finances but idk that if it went through that they would be a tough west team<br>  <br>  if OKC got Tyson that would be amazing for them! i was looking forward to that and was kinda bummed when it didnt happen<br>  Durant just needs a center and they are legit|`|UBIlwiALaa	Yep, although there is one team that isn't sign any body b/c they don't need to .....and that is the Utah Jazz.  Everyone is now healthy and although don't think they will beat the Lakers (no one to really stop KB) they will take them to a 6-7 game series and be very enjoyable to watch!|`|7bx2XQlqaa	of course they are.  The Lakers are the class of the NBA right now and everybody has to use them as the standard for the best talent.  They are the measuring stick of talent for the NBA.|`|270485338479c7d2f655fcad721d5383aa	Remember last year's finals how celtics beat up on the Lakers bcuz they were not aggressive and tough enough, well there goes thy answer|`|RKWTxuz4aa	They did it so they can get better idiot.<br>  <br>  Lakers dont affect every move.|`|5ANmjtLOaa	yes because they need to match up againts the Lakers very deep team.|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	I guess they are trying to match the Lakers.|`|gUbzHOnmaa	No team was in a panic for these players. They wanted to sign them to bulster there bench so they don't have to play their starters once they seeds are made for the playoffs. <br>  <br>  The Lakers aren't going to win it and they will be bounced in the second round. Pau Gasol is a freaking wuss! Constantly complaining and whining to the refs. In the playoffs I bet he gets ejected at least once for being a huge baby! <br>  <br>  By the way how did it feel having the Lakers get their butts handed to them by the superior Celtics? By the way the Lakers swept the Celtics in the regular season too. Again the regular season doesn't matter in a championship series it's who wins then. The Lakers aren't going to win it.|`|1E3MzC3Baa	Most teams in the NBA are always looking to improve themselves. Except for the Mavs and Suns deals last season, I don't see any panic in the moves you mentioned. Even those two did not have much to do with the Lakers. First, the Shaq trade had more to do with the Spurs than it had to do with the Lakers. Then the Mavs made the Kidd trade mainly because it was felt they lacked leadership and toughness in the playoffs. <br>  <br>  For the Celts, they needed a point to back Rondo up. Marbury is a low risk, high reward type of deal for them. The Cavs needed a big man to offset the loss of Ben Wallace. And it was well known that the Spurs had been looking to upgrade their frontcourt since the start of the season, so picking up Gooden only makes sense. These moves were made by these teams in hope of becoming better. Are they keeping an eye on the Lakers? Definitely, but they are hardly panic moves. <br>  <br>  In case you didn't know, the Lakers also made an offer to acquire Gooden. Why did they do that? they certainly don't need him. Could it be they were afraid of him landing with a contender like the Spurs?|`|dcNT65mTaa	That had nothing to do with trying to match LA. The Lakers aren't the center of everyone's focus. As a GM, you're supposed to make you're team better and given the opportunity to do so heading into the playoffs, why wouldn't you. No one is in a panic
l7iZhjoSaa	It varies from school to school. There is usually a time that the coaches decide on, such as a state qualifying time (which varies depending on what division your school is in) or if you score points from them, you should make varsity.|`|5VXSD7C4aa	Most likely the fastest 2 runners in each event. Thats what it is at my school.|`|fOMcLCCcaa	For our school I don't know if there is a "varsity" team, but in order to get a Varsity letter you need to score a certain amount of points.|`|769673b54b5f0954c7e21c7fe2878c65aa	for my school its pretty much around the top 4 runners for each event or how ever many entries are allowed in the varsity meet, so for one meet it may be only top 3, and others schools are allowed like 5 entries.
rwNZO5Llaa	a garmin eTrex can be picked up for around a $100.00 it does not have any of the bells and whistles some units have but it works just fine,i found my first 150 caches with one and have since moved up to a garmin 60cs to have the mapping features.|`|tGw60KJUaa	Garmin GPSMap 60CSx is a good one for GeoCaching.<br>  <br>  GEOCACHING (4/5 stars): The unit offers a special geocache menu that keeps track of the caches that you uploaded into the unit and have yet to find. Since I have a Mac, I'm not able to hook the unit up to my computer and upload the waypoints from geocaching.com. I manually enter the waypoints from the information provided on the web site. The manual provides *no* information on how to manually enter geocache waypoints -- I figured it out on my own. The manual also did a poor job of explaining how to mark a cache as "found" in your GPS so it automatically updates the cache status and enters the "find" date/time in the calendar. Once you figure out how to do everything, it does a good job of managing your geocaches. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D172282%26sort%3Dpmrank%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fst%26keywords%3DGeoCaching%2520GPS%26qid%3D1236533274%26rh%3Di%253Aaps%252Ck%253AGeoCaching%2520GPS%252Ci%253Aelectronics%252Cn%253A172282%26page%3D1&tag=garmin.gps.navigator.cheap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>

cKDralDHaa	I don't 'hate' them but they do get on my nerves when they come out with unsupported opinions and shoot down those of everyone else who may not agree with them.<br>   <br>   I'm sure you've seen a number of them, they will say something along the lines of. "Such and such is an underrated Superstar, if you can't see that then your obviously not a wrestling fan." <br>  <br>   Or: "So and so does not deserve the push, if you think he does then your not a wrestling fan." <br>  <br>   But the most prominent of these haters are the kind you see who say this: "Wrestling is fake, why don't you watch a Real sport like the NBA, NFL, NHL, or MMA where people actually hit each other and not grope each other like gay men in their underwear." <br>  <br>   I could go on for a long time on how Wrestling isn't "Fake" and how the thing's Superstars do in the ring are just as real as any sacked Quarterback or Hockey player rammed into the wall, but I can almost guarantee all I would see is, "wrestling is gay" as their response.|`|JiCfYfLraa	do i especially the ones who always complain about wrestling being fake.|`|zi6Ipmfuaa	ya i hate the haters but it depends on the problems.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Haters get what they deserve, hate!

Wrestling is like any other TV show: for entertainment, just more dangerous. The haters should calm down and quit being so self-righteous and judgemental. I don't "hate" them as much as I get annoyed by some, though.

eIsaihWBaa	Catcher position is fine. there is a very small margin between the top tier catchers and the middle tier catchers you have. good job there. hopefully didnt waste an early pick on one of them.<br>  <br>  you are going to want at least one more closer. One closer will not get you enough saves to even compete in that pitching category.<br>  <br>  also depending on your league settings you might want to look into a couple middle relievers... only the top guns though. they will lower your era and raise your K count.<br>  <br>  If you want to change something else I suggest trying to come about a better 1st and or 3rd baseman. someone a little more reliable and more dominant for his position.|`|AA12181737	Your team doesn't have any power.  Hanley Ramirez could be your only player with 30 HR and that will be a problem.  You should have a better utility player.  <br>  Also, you have very few strikeout pitchers.  Saunders, Wang and Buehrle get among the lowest strikeout totals and I would avoid having more than one of them on my team.  <br>  Iannetta, Huff, Phillips, Hanley, and Magglio are all quality hitters for a fantasy team.  Sabathia and Billingsley will be good pitchers and Wang will supply lots of wins, but that's not enough pitching.|`|11jq3Xb3aa	you have a good speed team but, ull want to be better..being ok isnt what u want. u want to be strong and if u can be strong in speed, go for it...theres only so much speed to go around..blake is worthless..try grabbing pierre or someone with some wheels if u can|`|rYqBGkwjaa	Catcher.

WLwTKS3qaa	I would say it depends on your other rosters. Braun can provide you bit more in power categories while Sizemore can provide more runs and SBs. But in general, I would choose Sizemore over Braun. If you look at their 2008 statics, their numbers are almost identical when it comes to hits (170/174) and Ks (129/130). What Sizemore has over Braun is hard to come by. Power hitter with great speed. Sizemore is more of well rounded athlete and he had a bad season privously. In my opinion, Sizemore second most well rounded player right beneath Hanley Ramirez.|`|1ba4117e21f3ec675a8aaa421899d3d4aa	I have to agree with Steve the Fob, <br>  <br>      It all has to do with your roster, Grady would would be my choice just because there are not many players that can get HR's plus SB's, He will also get you runs<br>  <br>  As for Braun, HR's (Not by much) RBI's (Not by much) <br>  <br>    Go with what your roster needs cause if you get more power but you need SB's and Runs, You wouldn't get the better deal.|`|x4LNlnFBaa	I feel braun is best. He made no errors last season and coming off this year he gets early experience playing in the WBC. Seizmore is hurt right now and could run into some bumps along the way. Braun is also on a great offensive team that can consistently get men on base for him to bat in. hope this helps :)|`|AA11566494	Braun, becasue he is not comming back form an injury.|`|AA12181737	A lot of "experts" have Sizemore ranked very high and he could be one of the few 30 HR + 30 SB guys in the league, and he scores a lot of runs.  I find that Yahoo tends to overvalue stolen bases in general.  But his batting average won't help you (.275) and his RBI total will be meager (around 85).  Braun, on the other hand, is already one of the premier power hitters in the league, plays on a team with great batters around him, and should produce in all 5 of the regular categories.<br>    <br>  These are my conservative projections for the two.<br>  Braun: .300, 40 HR, 110 RBI, 100 R, 16 SB<br>  Sizemore: .275, 30 HR, 85 RBI, 110 R, 35 SB<br>  <br>  Those would put Braun significantly higher than Sizemore in 3 categories and Sizemore significantly higher in only 1.  I'll take Braun.|`|kxMDFPnbaa	Ryan Braun because he isnt even in his prime yet and hes already and all star|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Braun-- more homers and RBI<br>  Sizemore-- more stolen bases and runs<br>  <br>  6 in one hand, 1/2 dozen in the other hand

They will try to replace them.<br>  <br>  Mock draft has them picking up James L.... out of Ohio State to play ILB.   To replace Bart Scott. <br>  <br>  But that was assuming that the Ravens would lose Ray Lewis.  Ray stayed...so<br>  <br>  Now they go for a TE to replace the stud aging Todd Heap and pick up Brandon Pettigrew out of Okie State.|`|UfQhMDeeaa	They will most likely pick a WR. Probably Maclin if he is available, but if he is off the board then they should pick Heyward-Bey. If both those guys are off the board then I think they go with either Vontae Davis or Alphonso Smith to help in the secondary.
7g44U1xRaa	lady bird|`|LrfYI3BRaa	There is something I have been meaning to say to the ladies for sometime.<br>  <br>  It's time to get over your apathy of sport.<br>  <br>  It comes from a place of love but also from frustration.<br>  <br>  Obviously I am a woman. But I am also a woman who has an interest in sport. That's why I have this little spot to vent my views.<br>  <br>  It is not because I am a sports reporter, or because I am an expert or can sprout facts, figures and statistics at the drop of a hat.<br>  <br>  But because when the powers that be decided they wanted a female perspective on the world of sport I was the only gal in the office who put her hand up.<br>  <br>  The only one who had more than a passing interest in the news at the back of the paper or hung around for the fourth break in the nightly news. Lately that has been bothering me. I think it is because of a woman I overheard speaking to a friend the other day.<br>  <br>  Coffee in hand, she told her friend that her husband had tried to "talk sport" while they had been enjoying dinner the night before and she "just totally zoned out".<br>  <br>  "Honestly, who does he think I am? Has he confused me for one of those butch women at the plant? I just said 'honey, the day you want to listen to me harp on about my period is the day I'll listen about your little football games'".<br>  <br>  True story. I almost choked on my milkshake.<br>  <br>  There were two things I wanted to say to this woman.<br>  <br>  First of all why must we label women who enjoy sport – particularly football – as butch?<br>  <br>  OK – I'll admit that maybe some of the female league players aren't the most delicately feminine of creatures. But that doesn't mean every girl who has an interest in football – of any code – is "butch".<br>  <br>  Seriously, you'd be hard pressed to find a girl more girly than me, and I enjoy all the codes.<br>  <br>  Secondly sport is not just for the guys. It may come as a newsflash for some women but the girls have been getting out there and having a go since before the time of the Amazons.<br>  <br>  I can't think of a man alive (outside of my doctor – and only because he gets paid to) who would want to hear about mine or any other woman's cycle. I don't want to hear about another woman's cycle. So it's not a fair comparison.<br>  <br>  The problem lies entirely with the fairer sex.<br>  <br>  Often though, women who don't like sport, often just don't like football or cricket.<br>  <br>  They forget there is tennis, hockey, swimming, athletics, netball, golf, basketball, curling and many, many more sports.<br>  <br>  And if you don't like watching the boys play – how about getting out there and supporting the girls.<br>  <br>  We really only have ourselves to blame for the sporting world still being considered a men's domain.<br>  <br>  Just get over it, stop being such snobs and remember that women are just as competitive as men – and instead of channelling that energy into losing more weight than your best friend – how about you put it into a sport.<br>  <br>  Or at the very least, stop turning your nose up at it.
aNlT1NRqaa	There's also cyclo-cross. Kind of a road bike for off road.<br>  <br>  The best bike for beginners depends on how you plan to ride. Trails, get a mountain bike & racing, get a road bike.<br>  <br>  Whatever you get, go to a bike shop. They will answer questions (when they answer one, you may think of something new). Don't get the cheapest if you think you'll get serious. It's not necessary to spend the most either. A good mountain bike should run between $800-1800 for a beginner; a road bike will probably be more like $1400-3000.<br>  <br>  Don't just go by name brands. Check the components. You might find 2 bikes for $1000; one has Shimano Deore (low end) and the other has SRAM X.0 (high end). As long as both frames are good enough for you (& comfortable) go with the better components. Just remember, if you ride a lot, you'll be replacing some of those parts regularly (at least you should).|`|y4k2sYQCaa	So many categories with so many subcategories.  I know the most about mountain biking, but here's my attempt at covering everything.<br>  <br>  Road:<br>  Track bike<br>  Fixed Gear (can't coast)<br>  Triathlon <br>  Road (standard race bike)<br>  Cyclocross (roadbiking off road)<br>  <br>  BMX:<br>  Dirt Jump (massive doubles)<br>  Flatland<br>  Street/Park (jumps, banks, rails, ect)<br>  Half Pipe<br>  <br>  Mountain:<br>  Cross Country/XC race<br>  All mountain (more than XC less than freeride)<br>  Freeride (drops and jumps, requires a solid bike)<br>  Dirt Jump<br>  Downhill (long travel bikes built for racing on rough terrain)<br>  4 Cross/Duel Slalom Race<br>  Slopestyle (competetive jumping, dropping, and tricks including flips and spins)<br>  Singlespeed (generally also XC or all mountain with one gear) <br>  29er (generally also XC or all mountain with bigger wheels) <br>  <br>  Other:<br>  Unicycling<br>  Recumbent (odd shape bikes)<br>  Folding bikes<br>  <br>  All mountain riding is nice and mellow and would be enjoyable for abeginnerr using an appropriate bike.|`|FIG58FVpaa	You have most of the types listed. <br>  <br>  Road, Mountain, Track, Trials, BMX racing and BMX freestyle are pretty much all of the major types. Mountain Biking can be broken down into Downhill, Dual Slalom and Cross Country. BMX freestyle can be broken down into Ramp, Street and Flatland. <br>  <br>  If you like riding off road on trails mountain biking is a lot of fun. If you would rather stay on pavement, road biking is fun, too!
p3qMXuPGaa	Honestly almost all Union bindings are great for jibbing the Highbacks have a lot of give in them and the straps are very minimal allowing for more forward flexation.  The thing to watch out for is the buckles blowing up and all the screws constantly getting loose.  Just remember to loc tite them and you should be solid.|`|LIKkt8djaa	Not with the DK's but I've heard great things on the Union Force bindings for a freestyle setup.<br>  <br>  A few others I'd consider would be the<br>  <br>  Rome 390's<br>  and<br>  K2 Formulas

fbG7kjynaa	The All-Star events, from the games to the skill competitions, are entertaining for younger fans, and plenty of older fans as well. It's also extremely cheap to get into the even, if you're living at the location that it's hosted in.<br>  <br>  I believe the term would be "giving back to the fans". It also serves as a relaxing event for the players, too, as they get to play a game of shinny, which is basically just a "for fun" game.|`|rX0DiVChaa	cos it rules. <br>  <br>  you see alot of talent on display.<br>  <br>  i think they all just show off|`|axxQzOCHaa	It generates much needed revenue for the league|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Because the kids seem to like it.

0tpLq6meaa	There have been several panthers sighted in Louisiana over the past few years, but with the exception of one sighting, have been tan in color.The word panther is what the southern states call the cougar or mountain lion when it is sighted in the swamplands.About a mile down the road, a guy vidieo taped a panther and her 2 small kittens as she crossed an opening behind his house.He has been reporting seeing them cross several times , but people had their doubts until he got them on film. Another was seen by several of my friends last fall. They had gathered for a cookout at a friends house and the kids were playing in an open field in front of the house. The children started screaming and when the adults looked, they saw a large panther walking toward the kids.The adults ran at the panther and chased him away. They didn't know if the cat was stalking the kids, or was merely curious. But the bottom line is, there are panthers in Louisiana!|`|6pUzzsuhaa	you kinda really need to stop goin out there at 1 in the morning with that panther there<br>  you need to be a LOT more aware of your surroundings, and like how Mountain Man suggested, take a dog or two- they will pick up on the panther's scent and they'll alert you to it way sooner than you ever could<br>  <br>  i personally haven't had a encounter with a panther- but i will tell ya this much- people say there ain't many here in the southern USA, but here in south GA, there's a good few of em- i know for a fact there down here- and there's some in northern FL also..<br>  my boyfriend's grandpa and uncle had one on their 300+ acre farm, a friend of mine has seen 2 on his property and both have been caught on a trail camera<br>  <br>  i suggest putting up a trail camera near where you found the tracks and around the property else where too|`|QZUxiZpNaa	I have heard rumors but no i have not seen any|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Yup, son you got yer self a genuine cougar track there if not it's a saint Bernard with no toe nails!

A black panther is not a breed of large cat but an ordinary mountain lion or jaguar that just happens to be born black.  None of the big cats native to North American are particularly interested in humans, other than to avoid us.  Exceptions are if they are sick, or old or if you mess with their cubs. <br>  <br>  Yes, I've heard rumors of large cats making a come-back.  Stands to reason that some would be black.  I think it is kinda cool, actually.  Last deer season hunters spoted a mountain lion on my South Texas property.  <br>  <br>  H

Board-breaking is merely just a confidence test but not as important as your confidence to defend yourself.|`|2eztcCO0aa	In my system, we don't break boards.  We figure that boards never did anything to us, so why hit them?<br>  <br>  But if it's important for your test, try a makawara board.  If your school doesn't have one, you can build one yourself.  However, I wouldn't recommend it if you're under 16 because you're bones aren't fully grown, and you can cause your hands to be deformed by using a makawara board.

0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	Rashad is def. going to win. You can tell after Rampage vs Jardine, Rampage isnt what he used to be. He had a hard time, and Jardine's chin isnt that great. Page is slowly fading away, and Rashad is going to put him to sleep...|`|f9soMMuiaa	They both have very similar attributes and strengths. Both men have a good wrestling base, but Ramage is probably stronger in a strength war once they're up close. In a distance, I'll have to say Rashad's got a sharper stand up than Rampage. But Rampage got good KO power and once he lets out his fury, it's dangerous. This would be a very interesting fight. And I was surprise to see that Rashad is actually bigger than Rampage size wise.|`|oeQVK0cmaa	Rashad's hand speed is faster, has about the same amount of power in his fists, is bigger/stronger, more explosive and argubally is the better wrestler!

Rampage isn't on a downhill slide, in fact he's on the uphill again. he's an insane fighter, and although rashad is a badass, jackson is a competely different calibur than what he's faced, and I think rampage is better on his feet than rashad, and i cant remember the last time he was on his back. im thinking KO in the 3rd or 4th.|`|ZHX1Uzdqaa	Quiton "RAMPAGE" Jackson!!! his like a beast after the low blow that keith did to him
Tu9S1WaNaa	It depends on what brands they are and the demand of the paint scheme.  Also, it depends on the production number.   If it is one out of 5,000 or less it is worth more. Also, it must NOT be a remake. Banks and Black window cars are more rare.  If he does NOT have the boxes, it isn't worth $1,000 for all of it.  The boxes are worth more than the cars.  Plus they need to be graded.<br>  <br>  Really it depends on what somebody is willing to pay.  With the down economy,the collection is probably worth 50- 75% of what people would have paid just 2 years ago.

If he also has all of the QVC cars, I would add another 2,500.<br>  <br>  I would say Gordon's are worth 60-75% of Earnhardt.  I would say $4,000 to $7,500.

Accurately, its probably about 100-300 yards (with 300 yard shots being lucky to hit a milk jug due to wind and the fact you're lobbing the bullet in due to drop), though I'd say most people would find anything over 100 yards.

There would be no accuracy firing it like that and even a light breeze moves the bullet a few inches even at 100 yards.

These are measurements of the width of the bullets.<br>  <br>  That's one question: which is bigger, the second question, which is more powerful is harder to answer.

Vyz5YnZqaa	They will win the AFC east.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Bills still ain't going to the playoffs!|`|15wwA3jjaa	I really don't think so, if this were 2 or 3 years ago then I would say yes, but the guy is going to be 36 when the season starts and he simply just doesn't have the skill he once possessed.  Don't get me wrong, the guy can still play, but he just isn't the beastly wide receiver he once was.  He will make some big plays, but he isn't going to be the key to competing in the AFC East that Buffalo hopes he will.  Their biggest problem is the horrible offensive line, just look at what the Patriots do to them every time they play.  Buffalo picked up Owens for the deep threat, but Trent Edwards isn't going to be able to capitalize on his new weapon when is o-line doesn't give him enough time for T.O. to get deep.|`|9wblT5sYaa	I just hope Trent can get back throwing the ball well with confidence, and if he does TO will produce which in tern will help out Lee and the other WRs. this WILL make us a huge contender. plus even if it doesn't work out, its just a one year deal. good roll of the dice if you ask me cant wait for Bills season to start.|`|MxHIdyVAaa	the bills didn't do good with lee evans.  AND, the cowboys really didn't seem to get much spark with Owens.  i don't think Terrell Owens was necessarily a bad acquisition for the Bills.  but, it doesn't solve any of their real problems.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	hell yeah|`|2d61caac30a1c63cec56eda253cdb990aa	It's a prove it year for Owens, so he'll put up the beast numbers buffalo needs him to,(he's gotten 71 touchdowns total in his "prove it" years) besides, the trouble from him has never started in the first year, he knows what his job is, he'll do it, and leave for greener pastures and more money after the year is up. Also, none of the money is guaranteed so since he knows he has to produce, you can bet he will.|`|KvyS9QuAaa	Im gonna say that, he will be good for the field maybe but NOT good for the locker room. He will also get pissed because the bills suck, and he will complain like to does all the time.|`|GxGsJixoaa	just saying TO is a good receiver, if he can keep the ball off the ground i think he will contribute. but one player doesn't mean anything unless the rest of the team is going to do anything.|`|hSOHLKUNaa	horrible|`|wObCwOWKaa	BIG PROBLEM LOOK AT THEIR DIVISION AND JUDGE

gUMucKOkaa	The best hitter available. Utility can be any position. Many people like to have a second 1B or another OF there as they usually are good hitters.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	i like to get a good power hitter for some extra HRs|`|AA12181737	It's usually best to make sure your required positions are full before choosing a utility player.  But if it's your turn and there aren't any available players for those positions that you are particularly interested in, then pick the best hitter available.
gUMucKOkaa	Can be any Pitcher. SP or RP. Gives some flexibility to your lineup. Particularly if you wish to have additional RPs in your everyday lineup or for the days that you have several SPs starting.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	P just means Pitcher. But i noticed that a "P" pitcher will be in the line-up w/ out moving him to SP.  His stats will count still. Same w/ a closer. If he is marked as "P", his save or innings pitch will still add up.|`|AA10545938	Well yes, SP is starting pitcher and P means Pitcher. This means that they can either be Starting Pitcher or RP  relief pitcher. You want to have about 5 SP and then have the rest RP. Cuz you want saves. This will wn you a category itself and SP get more K's than a RP because USUALLY starters ptich more.<br>  Good Luck this year in FB

DEXSuqT7aa	Yes you will, I would say your muscles are stronger than theirs, because of the fact of the more weight you carry.  It would be like finding someone you are same speed as, and putting a 40-50lb backpack on them, you would be faster.  If you lose the weight and keep at the exercising you will increase your overall speed.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	yeah more than likely.<br>  My stomach kind of sticks out too haha.<br>  215 is pretty heavy for a sprinter but hey, you said you're fast.<br>  anyways, you do need to workout some and have a LITTLE bit of muscles in your legs.<br>  So lose some weight and work out some and do some sprint work and you should do pretty good.|`|JNTQwvtTaa	Are you kidding?|`|5VXSD7C4aa	Most definately. Less weight and the same amount of muscual = faster. lose the weight and keep practicing and u will go faster.
cKXZOLJSaa	Well, for one.<br>  start with your lead foot.<br>  have someone push you and don't pay attention, whichever foot goes forward to catch you is what foot you want as the farthest one back.<br>  second, the do feel awkward but they help a lot.<br>  you need to gradually come up, don't shoot up otherwise it doesn't help.<br>  you need to push off hard with both of your feet for the exploding part.|`|l7iZhjoSaa	First off you need to make sure that you're comfortable in your blocks, play around with it a little, it usually takes a couple of years until you find the most comfortable position.<br>  As for the take off, shoot your butt straight up, and when you push off, the leg that is in the back should come out first. Your first step should be big, make sure you drive with your knee going forward, and keep your body low as well. When you get out, your first couple of steps should be short, to help you gain speed.
bFPhiJXFaa	hmmm, yeah i have this problem too:/ it sucks.<br>  try to keep your shoulders squared with the board and stay on top of it. if you keep landing with say only your right foot then try to land with only your left foot and once you know how to land with your left then try getting your right to land on the board too.

I think boxing is fun if you don't mind being hit and you don't mind working hard. I don't really like the atmosphere you get at most fighting places though is all|`|vyGyLV7paa	i do some MMA stuff and i am only 13.  MMA is fun and there is kickboxing involved.  MMA is mixed martial arts, it is 100% real fist fighting, that is fun even if you lose.  the only down side is getting knocked out, it hurts.  I go to the same gym as Kimbo Slice and i got to know him pretty well, that is how i got into it 3 months ago. it takes a lot of training too.

7bx2XQlqaa	They work but you have to stick with them consistantly.  Follow the workouts exactly as they tell you and don't quit.  If you do this you should see results.  I had them but I stopped using them after about a month.  I only increased my verticle by maybe an inch at the most.  I think it says you have to work with them for like 3 months for you to see any real results.
SqgXLLnwaa	If the runner on second tries to advance to third, yes you have to tag them. Steping on the base would be pointless. When you get the ground ball it is always te best idea to "look the runner back". this means that you stare down the runner until she goes back to second. If she goes back, you throw to first, if she continues to run at you, you tag her.

2eztcCO0aa	I've been studying the martial arts for more than 10 years.  I remember that feeling very well. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, you need to stop taking such good care of your feet.  Let them get some callouses on them instead of trying to keep them soft. Go barefoot as often as you can instead of just in class.<br>  <br>  Let your feet toughen up.  Keep the toes looking good and forget about the rest.  They won't look that bad, and you'll start to appreciate your feet for the useful tools that they are.

f9hiPMDxaa	He is a very good cricketer and probably the best all rounder in cricket at the moment. But nowhere near the greatest. Sobers would walk that one in hands down. Hadlee and Botham were great all rounders and could you imagine how good Keith Miller would have been had he been able to play in the same number of tests as Kallis.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	no he very is slow and boring ...<br>  Ian botham is best~<br>  <br>  <br>   another completed 45000 in cricket<br>  congratz budd~|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Yes,he is really the best all rounder at the moment.Congrats to him for completing his 10000 runs.|`|mber3JoAaa	He's definately in the top 3 in my opinion.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Stats dont lie.. And the stats say kallis is the best|`|4VoQduaZaa	There is no doubt Kallis is one of the great all rounders. But calling him the greatest will be doing injustice to the past heroes. If you are going by numbers, then Kallis may seem to be better than others. But you also need to look at the number of matches that are being played these days, which provide more opportunities for a player to score runs or take wickets. I can not answer who is the greatest. But Kallis sits in the ranks of Sobers, Kapil Dev, Imran, Hadlee, Miller and Botham.|`|eHcXI4jFaa	I know he is a good bowler, but I do not believe his bowling is good enough to be considrerd the greatesr (all time).

f7qVtYfaaa	very surprised, i can't wait to hear what the patriots are getting back because vrabel plays the postion that they are otherwise very weak at. there must be more to come from this deal.|`|zhH36xEHaa	C'mon now guys, why act so surprised? I knew the second that Scott Pioli went from NE to KC and took over as G.M that it was only a matter of time before he brought some of his guys with him to K.C. Pioli built NE into what they are today. And things look bright in KC|`|bC9bwpBhaa	I'm a Patriots fan and as sad as I am to see him go it's the right move.<br>  <br>  Vrabel is turning 34 soon and is starting to lose a step. There are also reports that he's been hampered with a shoulder injury that could come back to bug him. He only had another year in him too.<br>  <br>  The Patriots need cap space, and Vrabel is taking up quite a bit of it. They have a lot of draft picks and need the money to sign them and the free agents they are getting. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be suprised if the trade included Matt Cassel and some good draft picks. Vrabel is old but he still brings a ton of leadership to the team so there's still a lot of value there. Pioli knows this and probably thinks the Chiefs need more leadership and a good defensive veteran for the younger players. <br>  <br>  Now the Patriots are probably going to draft an OLB pretty high. They could always draft D backs and see how Shawn Crable turns out too. I always thought Crable would be a good player. Too bad he got hurt last year. I'm hoping for either a top CB or OLB. No one knows what's up Bill Belichick's sleeve except for Bill Belichick, but it usually seems to work out.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, I scratched my head at first, but then I remembered the Patriots have the best front office in the NFL, and not to question it...The Patriots D is among the oldest in the NFL and Vrabel is not getting any younger...The Patriots are gonna plug in some of the younger LBs next season...|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Unless the Chiefs are going to use him as a "surprise" tight end in goal line situations he'll be useless in Kansas City... just as he was in New England.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Well I think that the Patriots are wanting to get the younger guys. There were a few linebackers they were looking at in this years draft. Might be their first round draft choice!|`|5db8a4d79ef1c9ff462987bc954ba65baa	Don't forget who's running the Chiefs now; Scott Pioli.  He obviously thinks that Vrabel can still play.  As far as the Pats go, they were getting old at linebacker and probably feel Vrabel's best days are behind him.  Now they can get a young guy to work with Mayo and Bruschi.  Within a year or two I imagine Bruschi will be gone as well.|`|H9Ult8i2aa	I heard vrabel for the 34 round pick. and matt cassel is gonna be traded (IDK) wat team but the pats get a second round pick. also we r sendin this and next years picks to the team that gets cassel|`|gY5zAf9yaa	I'm kinda excited. I want to see what the pats do now. I'm thinking Ray Lewis, Jonathan Vilma or Julius Peppers. i also want to see what we get back.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	I'm with Moy but they must have another trade in the works there are a bunch of real good young LB's in this Draft, they must be thinking he is getting old and lets get something for him.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	not sure what the pats are getting for him but as a pats fan i dont like the trade but belichick is a genious so there is something going on|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	JESUS CHRIST I CANT BELIEVE IT!!!!i just came back from school and i read your question then i search it up.damm what are the patriots thinking?who did they trade him for??|`|omqQHSUlaa	The Pats have something up their sleeves <br>  they may draft James Laurinatis or Clay Matthews from USC|`|ILW3vkhEaa	he won't be as good cuz the team sucks|`|9OpembrGaa	They are supposed to get a draft pick i wonder what round.
rseD4OG2aa	Unfortunately, I don't think so. There are a ton of people out there who really hate Shawn Michaels, and while some of it is warranted, a lot of it isn't.<br>  Have you ever read HBK's biography, Heartbreak and Triumph? It's an awesome book and Shawn writes it himself. He brings up the point that before he got hurt and had to miss four years, he was a huge jerk backstage, and you know, from what I've read from a lot of sources, he was.<br>  Now, Shawn Michaels is easily one of my favorite wrestlers of all time, so I'm not trashing him. The thing is though, by his own admission, he was not a good guy. He complained a lot, he was in tight with Vince and he wouldn't do jobs on occasion without putting up a big stink. Then there were incidents like the Montreal Screwjob and the MSG thing, which only augmented people's hatred of him.<br>  But when Shawn left wrestling for a few years because of that long injury, he changed, and that's what I admire most about him. He kicked his pill problem, got married and basically grew up. I just think that is so cool. Since he's been back I've only heard positive things about him. He puts guys over all the time. I mean, look at his feuds with guys like John Cena, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Triple H and a lot of other guys. He put them all over big time and made them look fantastic in the ring. He sold well for all of them and put on some classic matches.<br>  Still though, you'll find guys who won't forgive and accept that Shawn really has changed for the better. He may not have been 12 or 13 years ago, but Shawn Michaels is a good guy now. I have this friend who's also a big wrestling fan. We usually go and see the PPV's in theaters together. And he just hates, and I mean HATES, Shawn Michaels and Triple H. Now Triple H I can understand, but he just despises Shawn for the role he played in the Montreal thing and a few other incidents over the years. <br>  However, he has very slowly started to change. He admits that Shawn is a fantastic in-ring performer. But he still doesn't like him. So even if Shawn puts Undertaker over, which I'm sure he will, those type of people will still not like him. <br>  It's too bad.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I respect and love them both, but I think anyone who realizes wrestling is scripted wouldn't care who wins, they'll just enjoy the moment when these two legends meet.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yeah, I'd prefer to think of them as even, but it feels weird when they put Taker over. At least Shawn has a victory over Undertaker. >_><br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. What's up with the sudden surge of trolls? I miss the days when if you didn't watch wrestling, people would say you're missing out on something great. Now, it's the complete opposite. Plus, the trolls are so immature and self-righteous that it seems like they're 8 year-olds or just really angry people who didn't get enough hugs.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	No.<br>  The People Who Hate Shawn will Always Hate Shawn.<br>  Wrestling Fans don't have a Reverse button , Once They've Made a Decision , That's Their Decision for Life.<br>  He'll Never be Forgiven for the Screwjob , The MSG Incident , or the Barbershop by Any of the People who Hate Him for that.<br>  <br>  And What is that "IF" at the Beginning of the Question???<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - No. Especially Not the RR. HBK had Already Won it Twice & it was 'Taker's Turn.<br>  HBK has the First Ever HiaC Victory Over 'Taker , That Covers & Evens Them for Any Other Time 'Taker beat Shawn.<br>  <br>  Why is it that way with You? - Because You're a HUGE HBK Fan , He's Your Hero , & You Bond with Him Closer than You do with 'Taker. You Said that Yourself.|`|4eQqTiYwaa	I think hes already regained people respect|`|0cfmyIytaa	I cant even believe people dont respect HBK he is one of the hardest working employees the WWE ever had and IMO the greatest wrestler alive.A majoriity of anti-hbk fans are canadians after the montreal screwjob,will he gain more respect? Not to sure on it but most likely yes<br>  <br>  BQ:Yes i was i felt bad for shawn after he got out he just walked away i was on the verge of ..... i hope i dont get heat for this but i was really sad almost on CRY mode.<br>  <br>  To teh Troll-One who talks about someone telling them they have no life is just talking about themselves<br>  examples u sya she has no friends well u have no friends in reality ur just a little no life TROLL living in ur parents basment eating microwaved burritos while jackin off too barney the dinosaur.|`|HhXQnSznaa	Who will gain respect? Taker will win for sure, and he's got everyone's respect backstage. He's been there since day one and is pretty much the top guy along with HHH in the back.|`|KIOR56r6aa	For the respect part....unfortunately, no. For some people, a past can never be forgotten.<br>  <br>  BQ : Taker never won against Shawn Michaels in one on one match, this victory wouldn't bother me.|`|7916aa06aa7095ef0a8db07a09419b0daa	they are both good wrestlers it will be a great match
rseD4OG2aa	No, it won't. No matter what happens from now on, Shawn Michaels will always be the true Mr. Wrestlemania. <br>  I understand that The Undertaker gets more attention for it because of his undefeated streak, but really, that isn't what makes a great Wrestlemania performer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Undertaker fan and I'm not trying to take anything away from him, I just don't think that he's on the same level as Shawn Michaels, even with the streak.<br>  Sure, the streak is impressive, but almost every one of Shawn's Wrestlemania performances have been for the ages. More than anyone else in the wrestling industry, he has the ability to turn it on, with almost any opponent, when the lights are at their brightest. Look at his match last year against Ric Flair. Flair was a shadow of his former self and yet Michaels was so good that it turned out to be "match of the year" in most people's books.<br>  There is a reason why Shawn Michaels has helped put on the match of the year at Wrestlemania for most of this decade and many times in the mid-90's. Plain and simple, Shawn Michaels is the best ever. At his age now, he's still amazing, and when he was in his prime, he was a major part of some of the greatest matches we've ever seen. Look Shawn Michaels-Bret Hart at Wrestlemania 12. That was one for the record books. And the entrance that he had? The best ever, bar none. <br>  Just look at how many Wrestlemania's Michaels has either headlined or made memorable. The legendary ladder match at Wrestlemania 10 with Scott Hall, main eventing with Diesel at Wrestlemania 11, that classic with Bret Hart at Wrestlemania 12, he missed the next year, but his match with Steve Austin at Wrestlemania 14, where Mike Tyson was the "special enforcer" was responsible for launching the Attitude Era. Plus, Shawn wrestled that match with pretty much a broken back, and he did it well.<br>  After he came back from retirement, he was just as good. The matches he's put on with Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Ric Flair, John Cena, Triple H and Chris Benoit have all been spectacular. And he hasn't won all of them. He's just stopped the show and made the night the best that it could be. So it doesn't really matter whether he wins or loses, because no one can take that away from him.|`|KiOd1Udvaa	Well look at it like this.Undertaker:16-0<br>  Shawn Michaels:6-9<br>  The Undertaker has a better record at Wrestlemania.The Undertaker is highly respected by fans and wrestlers alike as is Shawn Michaels.So for either of these two to lose to each other would be no shame.To lose to an athlete of such a calibre would not mean that Shawn would lose his title as Mr.Wrestlemania at all.Being Mr.Westlemania is about giving it your all.Fighting with your heart and soul and giving every fibre of your being to entertain the fans!So no,*when* Shawn 'The Show Stopper' Michaels loses to The Undertaker,he will remain <br>  !!MR.WRESTLEMANIA!!|`|GQWGLSexaa	Nope it will be on as amazing the match went and how they beat each other<br>  <br>  HBK is called Mr. WrestleMania because of the great matches and shows that he puts on and for the Fans in WWE <br>  It has nothing to do with his record|`|b7JS16dyaa	Why would losing to a legend like Undertaker hurt his status? He's already put Cena over at Wrestlemania, and has let guys like Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy pin him cleanly. Shawn knows he's already cemented his legacy to the point where scripted loses can't hurt him; Shawn actually requested his match with Taker.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	No,<br>  HBK is not known for wining matches, but unlike taker all of his matches are great.

Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|kurIRZeCaa	No i dont think it will because he will always be Mr.Wrestlemania..if you look back onto his career and see all the things and moments he's created at Wrestlemania..losing to Undertaker will just make it more memorable..|`|08c83c602388f929bd8807d854eaf1bcaa	No way!

He is best known for always putting on a good performance at Mania.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	mr wrestlemania will never been taken away!
CnNAOoWgaa	What impressed me even more about Carwin is that he can TAKE a hit as well as he can give one.  Gonzaga hit him with some monster shots that would have done in a lesser man but Carwin amazingly recovered, got to his feet, then knocked Gonzaga out with one punch.  The ability to take punishment in MMA is just as important as the ability to dole it out and Carwin (and his extra thick skull) just proved that he can take a hit with the best of them.  One more big win for him against either Velasquez or Kongo and he should be next in line for a title shot.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Carwin looks like the real deal.  I see Lesnar and Carwin as the best, but Kongo very close, then Velasquez somewhat  close.   I think that these 4 fighters will be battling for the belt in the next 18 months.  Unfortunately, Fedor is not in the UFC, but certainly belongs at the top of this group, with Lesnar and Carwin closing the gap each day. <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't see Couture, Nog, etc in the "true contender" category in the near future.  Mir has an outside chance to be a true contender, but he looks awful small next to Lesnar.  I really do not see him beating Lesnar this time around.  I hope he proves me wrong, but I doubt it.  We will see in July.  If the UFC created a 235 weight class, I think Mir could easily drop and hold that class, but there is no such class, so I think it's going to get harder for him to compete with bigger guys that are emerging as top contenders.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I said going in that people who hadn't seen Carwin fight were in for a treat<br>  <br>  11-0 with 11 1st round (T)KO's-He will be a HW champ in the future.|`|oeQVK0cmaa	Yes! Gonzaga is no push over and he levelled him! One more win against another big name, lets say Kongo and he should get a title shot! But I am impressed with that guy!|`|ULw1777caa	Carwin is a beast.  I knew he had a chance in this fight, though many did not.  Good for him.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Carwin impresses me more every fight.  He is a powerhouse wrestler, who proved to me today that he has some serious power.  What impressed me most was his chin.  Gonzaga has some heavy hands, and landed some clean hard shots on Carwin's jaw.  Somehow, Carwin fought through and came back with power punches of his own.  He is rapidly rising up the heavyweight ladder.<br>  <br>  The problem, however, lies in the major gap between the best and the rest in the heavyweight division.  Right now, (hate to say it but) Brock Lesnar, Randy Couture, Antonio Nogueira, and Frank Mir are the division's top 4, and are at a different level than anybody else.  The best of the rest are Shane Carwin, Chieck Kongo, Cain Velasquez, Heath Herring, Gabriel Gonzaga, and (maybe) Mostapha al-Turk.  It seems like  you need to be at the top of the "normal' tier to challenge for a spot at the "top" tier, then become the #1 contender, then get a shot at the title.  In order for Carwin to get a title shot, he's going to have to go through guys like Kongo, Velasquez, and/or Herring.  Win one or two of those, then get a shot at one of the big guys (probably not Couture).  Win that, then get a title shot.  The top 4 (or 3 of them) are all so good, its hard to say who would be champion at the time.<br>  <br>  So yes, Carwin is definitely validated.  The question is, can he beat Kongo or Herring? Then can he beat Nogueira, Mir, or Steriod Yeti?  Then, can he win the title?  It's a long way away, but definitely possible.

My opinion only.  He wants to be a starter, so, the Bengals & Bucs may be at a disadvantage as they want to pair him with others.  Broncos & Browns may be looking at him as a starter.Coles MIGHT be on the Browns menu.  Other Mangini favs that may be available and on his wish list are:  ILB Eric Barton, CB Hank Poteat, and ILB Cody Spencer: <br>  <br>  "Free agency was seen as a litmus test of whether the Browns would try to win with their current roster or rebuild from the ground up.

313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	Shawn Michaels is truely one of the greatest perfoermers there is.  He came into the WWF/E during the Rock & Wrestling Era as one half of The Rockers.  Even though the Rockers only lasted a couple of years, people still talk about that tag team 20 years after Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels split up.<br>  <br>  As a singles performer, HBK would go on to become one of the best in ring performers of all time.  His matches against Bret Hart were some of the greatest matches of the 90's.  And who could forget their 60 minute Iron Man matches?  And let us not forget the ladder matches that HBK was involved in.  For years, his ladder match against Razor Ramon was considered the best ladder match ever.  He's also had memorable matches against the likes of Stone Cold Steve Austin who won his first heavy weight title from HBK.  HBK also was involved in the first Hell in A Cell Match against The Undertaker.  Another memorable performance.  In recent years, HBK has delivered great performances against the likes of Cena, HHH, Angle and will again deliver another memorable performance this year against The Undertaker.  My opinion of HBK is that he truely is one of the greatest and most consistent in ring performers of his generation.|`|77b5BDf3aa	ok first of all taker is 16-0 right now so he would be 16-1 not 15-1.<br>  <br>  Taker is going to win MARK MY WORDS. 17-0 R.I.P HBK.<br>  <br>  Also HBK will be around for about another 5 years and he most likely get the belt again gooo HBK.<br>  <br>  Taker is awesome and he will be around another 10 years easily.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I love Shawn Michaels.<br>  I like this match though because of the match. I agree that they probably won't break the streak but we rarely ever see HBK vs Undertaker match. And on top of that, it is at WM so it makes it really big. They've made us wait for years to see this matchup at Wrestlemania.|`|b7JS16dyaa	He's a veteran, an inspiration for many, and was/is one of the greatest performers in the business.

It bothers me for some reason. When Shawn lost the Rumble and Taker won, I was happy for Taker. I was more upset about Shawn though. The way he walked away and the way it all happened...I was in tears. I didn't want this match to happen to see HBK lose. I guess, for such a huge Anniversary, in their home state...it works.

Mx1ETvqcaa	I take it that you are not that interested in running the 800 for the season so while you have to try and do well in the race it is better to concentrate on the sprint races. <br>  How I would approach the race depends on where the 800 metre races are in the event program. If it is first or near the start of the day you have to go out hard at the start of the race. You will start to feel fatigued probably at about the 400 metre mark. If you are not out in front at this point then look at the person in front of you and try and push to get up to them, then do the same for the next person etc. It is important to try and place as far up the pack as you can because it will set you up mentally for the rest of the meet. The 800 metres is a mental game just as much as it is a physical game. Try not to concentrate on your breathing because time seems to go slower and also tell yourself that you are feeling fit and strong during the race even if your are not because you will automatically feel better. If you go out hard and are right near the front of the pack I wouldn't be the leader setting the pace because it tires you out more, sit on the leader and then make your move towards the end. If you stay near the front of the pack you should be fine.|`|eELS8zSRaa	Have a great start and then slow down a little bit. the last 500m you should start stepping it up every 100m until you are sprinting the last 200/300m.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would keep close to a sprinting pace for the whole time if I did it, but I'm probably more in shape than you are. Just try to stay close to some of the people in the top 3 and safe some energy for the sprints at the end.|`|l7iZhjoSaa	From what I can tell you don't have much conditioning training. A good time for a sprinter girl or boy without any conditioning training, is around 3:00. Don't go out too fast. I'd bring a watch, and time myself. At the 400 split it just depends on how you're feeling. If you feel good keep on going at the pace you're at, until the last 200 or around the final turn of a 400m track, and then give it all you've got. If you feel tired, as in you can't move your legs anymore, just take a little off, and at the final straight away give it your all.<br>  Really without and conditioning training, it'll be hard to get a good time, unless you happen to be one of those sprinters, whose also good at longer distances.|`|MxM4ZZngaa	I'm an 800 runner and I can tell you that when you start, unless you're straight beastin its gonna be kind of slow. If you want to get faster, run "quarters". That means run a bout 6 or 7 laps, taking a 4 to 5 minute break between each lap, and try to run the same speed each lap and stay consistent with your times. Try doing this at least once every week and it will give you your 800 pace and you'll get faster each time. Do that and eat right and you'll see great improvement. Last season it helped me cut my time from 2 minutes 27 seconds to 2 minutes 12 seconds. And you gotta take the pain. That's what track is.
paIUgtLRaa	People hate the Steelers cause they do win. They are jealous, and they hate seeing the same team, regardless of who it is, win again and again.<br>  <br>  Most people don't remember Super Bowl XL, but they go along with the false theory, because they are sheep and will believe what anyone else says. <br>  <br>  Just like people that hate the Patriots, for the most part, the team that wins the most, will draw the most haters.<br>  <br>  Conversely, the Steelers also have the most fans. So it evens out in the end.|`|zqc0ugtlaa	Because when a team starts winning a lot, they get band wagon fans. And the people who are hating have been long time fans of their local team and stuck with them thru thick and thin. They are jealous that the bandwagon fan doesn't know what it's like to lose (especially if their hometown isn't a "loser mindset franchise") because once their hot team starts losing, the band wagon fans find a new team.|`|g0LP0Cx0aa	Because they get everything they want as far as calls in a game! and they should not be credited the win for SBXL!!!!!!!|`|cXAzfS46aa	The only people who hater the Steelers are cardinal fans.|`|HjS2tlTDaa	Because they wish their own team was that good.|`|I1kfSC1Daa	I dont hate the steelers|`|19iD220Jaa	No clue|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Cos they're too tight to put a logo on both sides of their helmets.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	fuzzymime nailed it.

VFkw8kqwaa	Hola Jumalo,<br>  Muy interesante tu pregunta..<br>  <br>  Yo también tuve la oportunidad de ver la trasmisión del partido y si fue comentado lo de los abucheos al himno a la bandera Estado Unidense.  Debido a la animosidad q siempre ha existido entre México y EEUU no es de sorprenderse q eso suceda.  <br>  <br>  Por la inmigración, el racismo, la intolerancia y las tantas injusticias q sufren los nuestros a diario en este país, es q la gente manifiesta su descontento de esa manera. Abucheando durante el himno es solo una de las tantas  maneras q la gente suele a mostrar su sentir… <br>  <br>  Ahora en el caso de q también otras naciones están mostrando el mismo comportamiento ante el Himno Americano o quemando banderas Estado Unidenses (entre otras cosas) es mucho mas sencillo. Tiene q ver con lo cansado q esta el mundo de la política Americana y sobre todo de la Guerra en Irak.. Hay poca tolerancia ya así a una guerra sin sentido y por ende hay protestas a diario contra Estados Unidos en el mundo entero.<br>  <br>  Un gusto saludarte,<br>  Andrea|`|joAbc0acaa	Son genocidas<br>  abusan de nuestros paisanos<br>  son racistas<br>  engreídos<br>  degenerados<br>  drogadictos<br>  etc etc etc|`|knkE6816aa	Por que te dicen la Nariz|`|8d2afe94ba3f1834f0ace1cb49578d29aa	Resentimiento ante el maltrato.

And let me tell you if you keep doing what I tell you for about 2 weeks you'll be able to go under the water again.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	YES. It is extremely important to know how to swim. 1) you can save your own life 2) you can save someone else 3) by having this knowledge, someone else won't have to risk their life trying to save you.<br>  <br>  There are these silicone/wax earplugs that seal the outside of the ear from the water.

PA0gmwd5aa	I'm a black man (39 yrs old),and I don't really think you should look at things that way.I never looked up and said "why is the president always white?" Well he's not now,but I lived in a small Arkansas town and lots of white guys in my neighborhood could really play.I'm not gonna say they were tremendous athletes,but they competed and challenged me always.Let me let you in on something....most of these kids that play ball feel like it's their ticket to a better life whether they stick with it or not,it's a way out for some.They're hungry and ready to eat you alive if you stand in their way.I don't care what color you are if you can play then dammit you can play.Most blacks are just athletically gifted for whatever reason,but that doesn't mean they have an advantage. An example of that can be seen in the NBA.You gotta be smart also.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	well it's obvious...In general black people are more athletically gifted than white people<br>  ___<br>  but you must be pretty good if you play on Varsity as a Sophomore|`|Ef3VReezaa	Blacks are Superior in Basketball for Each sport a Race is better at like<br>  <br>  Baseball-White<br>  Basketball-Black<br>  Boxing-Black/Spanish<br>  Football-Mixed<br>  Hockey-White<br>  etc|`|piZ4xDBqaa	There are a whole bunch of factors involved..   sociological, economic, psychological, and yes, physiological.  Certain body types are better suited for certain physical activities.  To say otherwise is just ignorant.<br>  All you have to do is look at how Kenyans dominate long-distance running.<br>  <br>  But there are many, many other factors involved besides physical makeup.  Skip Bayless wrote an article a few years ago about Manu Ginoboli.  He claimed that one reason for the decline of white American basketball players was simply that the Americans are taught to believe that they can't compete with blacks on the court.  Ginoboli grew up in Argentina and never learned that, thus he's a great player.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	ok well lets think about this larry bird one of the greatest basketballs players of all time wait two of the greatest point guards of all time are white john stockton and jason kidd. what about Kevin McHale, Bill Walton, Brad Miller, Steve Nash just a few of the greats for you.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	i would say yeah we do but its because some white people do really lik basketball to much i think its because football everybody likes football but i would say its probably the school city or zip code ur in|`|7qEjVGetaa	There's no advantage to being a certain race, it's just that more African-Americans play basketball, like more Whites play baseball, and more Mexicans play soccer.|`|NxKjrz7xaa	they can jump higher and talk a lot of smack but they really arent anything, hardwork beats talent anyday|`|eypjP9Hqaa	Athletic wise  yes they do...shooting and passing belongs too the white boys tho|`|NEtVRjplaa	This does not sound racist to me. In fact I think it's a very good question. I have no idea though. The only theory I have is:<br>  <br>  1. Cultural Advantage- Because many Basketball Legends tend to be African American, the black community may see basketball as a way to succeed; thus instilling the need or want to participate. <br>  <br>  Myself, growing up in my house, basketball was a big deal, a HUGE deal. My brother and I had to play lol. My dad made us play for our school teams, and in the summer for outside leagues. It was a way a life. So I feel that basketball has become a huge part of black culture and is it much more important for black people in general. <br>  <br>  btw..

z7JsVzcnaa	Luongo is back playing at a high level and the chemistry on the first two lines is there with Burrows settling in on the top line with the Sedin twins and Sundin playing on the second line.<br>  <br>  The defense is also finally coming around as well given the injuries and trades that have been made this season.<br>  <br>  So yes, they are better and they're hot right now.  Still don't think they have what it takes to make a deep run in the playoffs though.|`|K9nWS2kIaa	hey! i'm a Canuck fan too! i think their getting better, big part is their confidence and chemistry. they played pretty well tonight i think and Loungo made key saves when they needed him to. i think San Jose played well too but couldn't get the goals. now they huv to catch Calgary for the division and i can't wait for playoffs!|`|n9py5Dreaa	I think it's MOSTLY luck<br>  of course they are into their game these days<br>  but San Jose was terrible tonite|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Luongo is healthy and,when healthy, is the best goalie in the NHL. Also putting Alex Burrows with the 2 Sedins seems like a stroke of genius. Mats Sundin has shaken off the rust, giving the Canucks 2 solid lines. They could shock in the west.
360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	They both played four years of college ball, so it actually makes it very easy to compare their stats side-by-side:<br>  <br>  James:<br>  Tot Tk: 376 (Solo - 160; Ast - 216)<br>  Sack: 13<br>  FF: 4<br>  Int: 9<br>  Yds: 72<br>  Avg: 8<br>  Lng: 25<br>  TD: 0<br>  <br>  Rey:<br>  Tot Tk: 272 (Solo - 163; Ast - 109)<br>  Sack: 9<br>  FF: 2<br>  Int: 5<br>  Yds: 76<br>  Avg: 15.2<br>  Lng: 48<br>  TD: 1<br>  <br>  The only thing Rey beats James in is INT return yards. Going based off of stats alone, there's no way you can say that Rey is a better LB. Sorry, but it looks like your friend wins this one.|`|wAiQOP0Laa	You can't just measure ability, it's cliche but Laurinitas has the "intangibles".  Malauga is a better athlete and playmaker (not by much have you), but Laurinitas is a leader and wherever he goes he'll make his teammates better.<br>  <br>  It depends on what you prefer though.  I'd take a leader over a playmaker, personally.  (e.g., Dawkins/Reed over Polumalu/Bailey).  It's whatever you prefer.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Rey Maualuga is the better player here.  Look at how many highly touted Ohio St. linebackers have gone to the NFL and barely made a contribution.  Maualuga is ready to step in at the next level and make an immediate impact.|`|cDKkKEgvaa	I'd go with Malauga.....he reminds me of Troy Polamalu when he was at USC and if comes anywhere close to having the type of career Polamalu has he'll be a beast|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Malauga... Samoans are beastly.
4kdlE54Paa	The Patriots are famous for reviving veteran players and using their strengths consistantly to the teams advantage.  He will likely not be an every down RB, but in a RBBC.  This is actually a pick up I saw coming when Taylor was released.  This was a very good move on behalf of the Patriots.  Especially since Lawrence Maroney just can't stay healthy to be productive.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|apfvBQ9Waa	It is honestly the end. He got a lot of years under his belt and he should just stop trying and retire. He wouldn't get many plays ant New England any way. They have lots of running backs all ready.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Beginning of the end, he won't do much for them seeing that they don't really run the ball that much|`|i0QzvbSnaa	2 words will describe him there - BACK UP|`|5B6w8mxVaa	he just wants a ring.|`|9429f58cf47195a2f788dc97e48b211caa	He may have a breakout year..at first it would appear the Pats are a throwing team, but lately they've become a more Efficiency team, and with Tom being a pretty sensitive assett right now..they may just honor Taylors abilities for one of his final seaons..and we already know he can tear the AFC up..he will run wild on the AFCs ***.|`|aHmrd3tiaa	New England is the Bermuda Triangle for running backs.  They go there to disappear into obscurity.<br>  <br>  Dillon, Marony, Faulk...Bilichick must have something against running backs.<br>  <br>  Last prominent running back in NE was Curtis Martin, and he left with Parcelles.|`|tOp7S0xpaa	He won't be as effective as he was with Jacksonville. I see the pats releasing Maroney, and starting Taylor. Taylor will end the year with at the most 850 yards rushing. (Brady or Cassel, they'll be throwing more often)|`|f7qVtYfaaa	this is the end but it is likely that he will do well only getting 8-10 touches a game , he could have two more enjoyable years
7a4be0ccfeaad7f23fda8c4df26efe8daa	i love cross country it is an amazing experience<br>  the first two weeks are the hardest<br>  hardness- it all depends on you and how hard you want it<br>  it gets you extremely fit<br>  breathing tips- in through your nose and out through your mouth <br>  eating tips- carbs and cut back on junk food<br>  it can be very time consuming you lose your saturday mornings<br>  <br>  for me i have practice in the morning then i try run after school, i run on saturdays, most sundays, i have 2 hrs of homework a night and i am a straight a student so for me it is a big chunk of my life but i am very dedicated<br>  <br>  but do it you won't regret it<br>  <br>  ohhhhhhh and you get to see a lot of hot guys run in short shorts|`|0dbDQh8Haa	the good things:<br>  -- people on cross country are the nicest people you will ever meet in your entire high school career<br>  -- after the first 3 weeks, you can do any workout your coach gives you without feeling a lot of pain<br>  -- in gym class, when you run your mile, you beat everyone in your class (including the boys :]) without even breaking a sweat<br>  -- after the first TWO weeks, you''ve got yourself a hot bod!<br>  -- you get in the best shape of your life<br>  -- can you say psych parties?!<br>  -- you get to meet everyone in other grades that have the same general interest: running!<br>  <br>  the bad things:<br>  -- at first it's gonna be really hard<br>  -- the reality is, it's a tough sport<br>  -- cross country doesn't get nearly as much respect as it deserves<br>  -- it's kinda time consuming<br>  -- you probably wouldn't be able to do dance also<br>  <br>  you're gonna need to have A LOT of healthy food in your house, because although you feel like you can eat whatever you want as much as you want, because hey, you just ran 10 miles! if you eat bad food, that NEXT 10 miles is gonna be awful.<br>  <br>  cross country is amazing, and i think you should give it a try!|`|X13XFZ3Laa	Oh gawd... I wish I asked this question before I tried it myself. If you never ran before, it will be hell on earth, no doubt. Running 3 or more miles almost every day without stopping (remember RUNNING, not JOGGING) its soooo hard but you can do it if you put in the effort! I'd suggest start running now to get ready for it!|`|zJ6gH2Hzaa	well you will probably have to do a lot of workout like push ups sit up and other stuff and hills but no worries practicestretchh you need sunblock and keep your mouth close so you won't get cramps.|`|k4vciZryaa	Croos Country is pretty cool<br>  You get in shape, and meet new people<br>  It is a co-ed sport so that's cool too<br>  It does get you shaped up, but it is pretty tiring and time demanding<br>  make sure to control your breathing and slow it down when running even though it's hard. It's true you will have to change your diet but dont start eating too much because its a common mistake with new runners to consume much more calories than they burn. I'm not too sure if you can do both the dance team and cross country though. Often times the sport takes up too much time. Your weekday afternoons will pretty much be filled with practice and depending on how serious your school team is, you may have some weekend practices are well. But I would definitly suggest doing. I started doing it my junior year and found it pretty cool<br>  Cheers<br>  rigginit|`|u3kj7c4taa	cross country is amazing, i did it in high school fresh soph and jr years, then had to stop and switch to swimming and waterpolo bc of an injury. you meet such good, determined people on the team. we won states my 1st 2 years. it teaches you dedication and willpower, and its very very hard, but its definitely worth it. i wouldnt trade it for anything, and i still run (im in college), but only for fun.<br>  <br>  as for meals, i didnt really need to worry about anything, im a skinny girl and i would always basically eat whatever i wanted. pasta before a race day for the carbs. it wasnt a dieting thing for me or anyone on our team, so honestly i never ever thought about eating more or less, i doubt i knew what calories even were!<br>  as for breathing, if you dont smoke youll be fine, just regular breathing... once you start youll get in a rythm and you will get better as you get in better and better shape.

8lsBBK62aa	Have a couple of each way bets on Barbers Shop and Albertas Run in the Gold Cup.<br>  Both of 'em are around 20/1 and should give you a run for your money. <br>  Furthermore Barbers Shop is owned by Her Maj so it will be hats off to a royal winner (Gor Bless Her!) and you could always tell your grandchildren in years to come that you were on Lizzie's horse when it won the Gold Cup!<br>  <br>  PS Have a decent bet on Walkon in the first race on the Friday. He's got a great chance of winning.|`|dC4qmz8aaa	I think you need to ask this question next Friday when more is known of exactly who will be running and riding.  It's still just a bit too early but I am on Kauto Star for the Gold Cup.<br>  <br>  It might help if you put your bets on before you go as it is going to be really busy there and to see all the horses, get from the paddock to the bookmaker and bookmaker to a good viewing position will be difficult with so many people about...Have a great day and win or lose it will be an experience you will never forget...Jac x|`|DMUqnTnvaa	a little bit to early yet as all the declared runners wont run but if walkon runs he will take all the beating in the opening race on friday .as for the gold cup i wouldnt look past the first 3 in the market i would of said denman but he hasnt had the best preperation compared with last year and may not be 100% . kauto star has had a better preperation and the trainer has him cherry ripe .another one to consider is neptune collonges. 3rd last year. enjoy your day and have fun
KmMRHKTNaa	Maradona. He has won everything.<br>  Messi is only 21 but hasnt won a world cup and other trophies....|`|f4w9NkETaa	Hahahah Dynamo doesnt know nothing!!, haha go back to watch ur mls games.. <br>  <br>  i think messi is better just the fact that maradona was a drug addict through out this careers... messi is a good role model, who play the game well and makes it look beautiful|`|IWM1khX7aa	Give Messi a break he's only 21!  He hasn't been at his best yet and since he's like the best in the world, then he will be much better than Maradona.<br>  <br>  Maradona was centered around ONE game where he scores two goals: The second greatest goal ever scored (the best is Messi v Getafe) and his hand of god (which should have obviously not been counted and he should have gotten a Red Card).  All of this happened against England in the 1986 World Cup Quarter Finals.  Infact, both goals took place in 3 minutes, so he's actually only centered around 3 minutes.  Sure Maradona was the best player in the tournament, but he was only that good then.  Argentina probably wouldn't have won if he didn't punch the ball.  He also didn't score against Germany.  Maradona wasn't even that great.  He was a cheater.<br>  <br>  Messi has cheated (hand ball), but only in a La Liga game not a World Cup match.  Messi can improve and I would say he's as good as Maradona.  I think he is better than Maradona.<br>  <br>  Edit: I still think Maradona is highly overrated even if he was best player in football next to Pele.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Well.. I hope that Messi wil not end up like Maradona.. being drug addict, alcoholic, and wasting his life away after retiring from football.. Ah Well, At least Maradona got his life back and becoming Argentina coach and that's good for him.. I haven't heard about Messi getting himself in to trouble off the field..|`|VIyKGiNXaa	Tarique H are you craxy he is the best he might not have free kick abilities, but that doesnt matter becaue he can soar right through defenders and almost anybody plus make great shots. He is the best, but maradona was still a better player he will always be compared to messi|`|VhgyQES9aa	lol, its not even close, Messi has proven nothing.  Maradona will always be the best
QCkanmR9aa	Hi baseball yes|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Even in the steroids era I couldn't (can't) watch a whole game of baseball, it's just too boring.  Football, on the other hand, is much more exciting.|`|SpSnRor6aa	football duh I'm British/pakii (so that is soccer if your American)|`|qcIfCt5haa	i like watching baseball more|`|lXdIpYpqaa	Neither I prefer my contact sports to be one on one and no audience is needed if you get my drift. Always considered football to be questionable anyway.  Where else does a man reach between another man's legs searching for a ball while wanting to make a hook-up with a tight-end or a wide-receiver, hmmm makes you wonder doesn't it.|`|Y9S3G9CNaa	watching would be football, playing would be baseball, but with fantasy i like both equally.|`|4C1gjMwbaa	I CAN"T STAND anything to do with baseball.

Ppo0sGiZaa	I believe one or both of the williams sisters and the tennis pro with the dog/camera commercial Anna K. I think? Many do but for contact sports or cheerleading/gymnastics the judges will take off for it. Belly piecing is more popular & easier to hide.
i0QzvbSnaa	I keep hearing that San Francisco wants him, but that the only place that seems willing to pay for him right now is Seattle. That could change now with Washington again pouring the money into things in the NFC East and pressuring the others into going beyond what they want.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	"Can you imagine what I would do, beating 1-on-1 coverage playing with Adrian Peterson?" <br>  <br>  Wow, I didn't realize he was so 'cocky'... pretty big mouth for a guy who's lived in Chad Johnson's shadow his whole career. <br>  <br>  turnxx5: where have you heard anything about the 49ers wanting TJ? If you could please post a link or something... I'd like to see it.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	The Vikings would be stupid not to get this guy it would help whoever the start at QB to have Peterson and T.J.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	I think if the Vikings could get him then they would be the team to beat in the NFC. I think trading Rosenfels has been the most logical, non-ridiculous move so far this offseason. The Vikes would be a real threat with Housh. I don't think they'll get him. I think New York will come up with something if they end up deciding to deal Plaxico. Seattle has the $$ to spend. Minnesota has Peterson, but I just don't see it happening.|`|f13c61e5eac8be2f275c050b8cdb9a2aaa	Well philidelphia can suck my ******* cock. I hope he comes to the vikings. Than we will pick up julious pepper like we were also speaking on.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	hate to say this but he will end up in philly.|`|520a1181e4e292a59e757be6387e684faa	He would fit n Philly the best and the Vikings are questionable at QB.

khbLZQHIaa	I know what you're saying, and I was mad when I heard this too.<br>  <br>  But the thing is ... Heidan, Dinkins, and Rucker are all pretty good TEs.  And it would be easy for the Browns to pick up another young TE in later rounds.<br>  <br>  So, this move will be good in the future.  Especially since Kellen wasn't happy anymore.  He may have said he was, but he hated the way we treated him this season ... and he's done with it.|`|jjzK1pOaaa	i agree...hes is the second best player on the team aside from cribbs who can do anything...but why...i mean come on...he still managed to put up over 800 yards with no QB...thats talent...sure hes a loud mouth...but atleast he backs up what he says...and i think that this might have something to do with the new coach and GM...cause during last year savage said he would keep him even after the whole staph infection thing...im with you...i hate getting my hopes up every year...there a have only been two good years... when they went 10-6 and when they got a wild card in 2002...other than that they just suck up all the fans money and have sellouts with the fans only going to see them lose...|`|4kdlE54Paa	It isn't as stupid as you think.  Kellen Winslow has had many prior injuries and constantly ailes from scar tissue in his knees.  The Browns know what is going on with him physically and understand he will not last long in the future.  So that said, they are thinking about now and the future.  They will likely finally address the issues on the O line and defence, which in my eyes is the immediate need for the team.  The Browns are getting compensated in draft picks to help fill in the void.  winslow's value is high rigt now and the Browns decided it was best to get the most out of him before his productivity tanks to the bottom.  Believe it or not, it was a wise move.  You just have to see the big picture.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i don't see the sense of this move either and it appears rogers wants out ,apparently there are just draft picks coming from tampa bay so maybe they have plans to package some picks and do something big but this really makes them a rebuilding team.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Supposedly the Browns got undisclosed draft picks...Better be a 1st rounder in there somewhere, or else the Browns screwed themselves...|`|TuOp3hNPaa	wow ya i jus heard about winslow.  thats the stupidest thing. he was one of our only threats. then if we lose rogers its def not gunna be good|`|uGv87fvKaa	Winslow is a good player but he is always injured and i think with Mangini the Browns wanna make a new start .

axxQzOCHaa	I don't know much about Janik, so I don't have an opinion on him just yet.<br>  I will miss Begin though. Despite being injury prone he is fearless, a good penalty killer, plus he was born in the same town as I went to university (Trois Rivieres) .. sad to see him go.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	He is a grinder........he can lay some big checks.........low minutes and can PK.<br>  <br>   Les Jackson's take (along the same lines).........“Steve is a gritty, honest player with a very strong work ethic,” Stars co-GM Les Jackson said. “He’s good on the penalty kill and he is a competitor in every sense of the word. We think he’ll be a very good addition to our group as we continue to fight toward the playoffs.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   With a couple of centers out for extended periods, this move is more out of neccessity.<br>  <br>   Comparable to? Ian Lapierre maybe.<br>  <br>   He is quite injury prone and can take some stupid selfish penalties too.|`|lYnkvRASaa	He is going to give you an honest days work.  Don't expect much offensively, he'll chip in the occasional goal but he is a solid grinder that will hit and give it all each shift.<br>  <br>  It seems in recent years he can't play like that for more than 8-10 games at a time before breaking down, he has been injury prone in recent years.  Plays center but has played mostly on the wing in Mtl recently.  great 4th liner, adequate 3rd liner and can fill in on the top two lines as needed without looking out of place although he won't provide much offence on the top lines.  He will dig it out of the corner for the skilled guys.  He will help you, plays big in big games.|`|naZQqrNeaa	I wished I had my old account during times like this.  Janik is a train-wreck......and should have never been allow to play professional hockey in the first place.  The only thing nice I can say about him.....he is not a bad fighter.....too bad he doesn't at least TRY to be an enforcer.  <br>  <br>  At least Begin is part of a Calder Cup winning team.|`|Ue5mbS5Laa	he dosnt speak your language!

3m9DQuDRaa	Randy Orton blindsided Undertaker during his entrance, and Stone Cold has as well.  Muhammad Hassan also attacked him during his entrance.  Kane has attacked him shortly after his entrance...  Eddie Guerrero TRIED it, but was taken out.<br>  <br>  The reason why you don't really remember any is because Undertaker is usually the last person to the ring.  It's not often when he's the first in the ring, and when he is, it's usually right before the commercial, when he has a surprise opponent.<br>  <br>  But there have been a few times when Undertaker was attacked.  And in most instances it STILL wasn't enough to keep the dead man down.  Another thing is that WWE likes to keep the crowd in awe of the Deadman... and having an attack happen in the middle of his entrance ruins that.<br>  <br>  Second question:  No.  The few times that he's been attacked during his entrance has basically just enraged him to the point where he wins pretty quickly (minus Orton's attack).|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Wow, that issssss amaaaaaaazing!!!|`|IkXU06wpaa	im sure boogeyman would attack him from behind & try to take his soul|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	i dont know but man taker is getting old, i doubt he will be wrestling for more than a couple more years|`|SyYXzAt0aa	becuas takers a 6'10 demond from hell u would be nuts just to insult him sorta like that small cocky whimp jamie noble look what happend to him against kane|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Yea it pretty funny|`|d403efcae775ea6e4ae5473282e93466aa	its a tv show|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I do think its strange now that you do say it but tbh I don't think people attack him from behind because I say they know Taker would beat the life out of them if they tried it!!!<br>  <br>  Plus as well i'd say the WWE writers know that it'd be creative suicide for a storyline where Undertaker gets attacked down the ramp.  He has one of the greatest entrances ever in the history of wrestling that people flock from all over the world to witness so I don't think fans would appreciate it being interupted....by anyone!!!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I also can't think of a time when Undertaker was blindsided on his way to the ring, and I think one possible reason for that is that, in a majority of his matches, his entrance is the last one before the match begins.<br>  <br>  I actually think it would be funny if an opponent (possibly Vladimir Kozlov) attacked him from behind (possibly at a PPV), only to end up losing in a squash match.  I'd prefer to see a long and breathtaking match, but I'd still be entertained by what I've just mentioned.<br>  <br>  For your other question, it might give opponents a better chance of winning, but that's a double-edged sword because you know Undertaker's going to be PO-ed, and the last thing you want to do if you're the Deadman's opponent is make him angry.

I also like the Taurus 24/7 Pro.<br>  <br>  I will say that if you are newer to handguns or not very experienced, the .45 is not going to be a good caliber. I would suggest a 9mm. 9mm is by no means "weak." Many police depts. by me still use them and provide you with good stopping power when accompanied with good shot placement. 9mm has much lower recoil and low price for target ammo.<br>  <br>  here are some links to some handgun suggestions to look at. You will want to pick up as many handguns as possible to see what fits best for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/products/product-details.cfm?id=112&category=Pistol" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/products/product-details.cfm?id=157&category=Pistol" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php?version=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php?version=127" rel="nofollow">http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...</a>|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I can't talk with great conviction about the double-action semi-autos, but IMO, the best compact single-action .45 ACP is the Colt Stainless Officers' ACP.<br>  <br>  I've had mine since 1988 and it will feed anything short of an empty case.  It is 100% reliable with my chosen ammunition, CCI 200 gr. "Flying Ash Cans" and 230 gr. Federal Premium Hydro-Shoks.  And not every pistol will feed those stubby CCI 200 grainers.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|hcGHj2ICaa	springfield makes a great .45 ACP compact pistol line, from long barrels to a 3(?) inch snubby pistol. ruger also makes a lot of .45 pistols that are the right size for compact carry. which one you pick is all up to you, just go lood at their websites, you should find some nice ones.<br>  kimber makes a few nice concealed carry pistols too.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Mine is the Kimber Pro Carry II, an alloy frame with stainless upper.  Kimbers all come with all the whistles and bells, which set the stage for the other makers to do the same.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Colt Combat Commander.*|`|4KvLIa6Saa	I carry the Kimber Ultra Raptor II 45acp 3" very little recoil> Cost more but it worth it>|`|qoE9H2WNaa	Especially if the pricetag is no object, the .45ACP H-K USP is about your best choice. This goes for their compact models, as well as the full-size pistols.<br>  Rather than deal with amateur opinions, I have found that the professional evaluators, both commercial and independent, have given a slight edge to the H-K pistols, from tests run by evaluators from such sources as Guns & Ammo, American Handgunner, and Gun Tests magazines.<br>  In such tests, the H-K USP models had fewer malfunctions and NO (0) failures when tested against, not only the Sig-Sauer, but Beretta, Springfield, and S&W models, as well.<br>  <br>  I've run nearly 5,000 rounds through my H-K USP .45ACP, including Hydra-Shok, Cor-Bon, and several equivilent custom handloads, with 0 stoppages EVER, and it's tolerances haven't measureably changed since I first aquired it.<br>  Know also that I carry my USP .45 in 'Condition One' (c0cked & locked) with a round chambered, just as safely as one can with the 1911.<br>  The only negative factors I've dealt with carrying the USP, inherrent in the SOCOM, as well, is it's larger size, but I'm a larger guy and LIKE the more impressive size, and the limited availability of carry systems, but I carry concealed in my own unorthodox manner, anyway.|`|Pp3WHtSFaa	What is best is hard to say. If you want reliability at a good price go with the Glock variants like the Glock 30. If you want Quality, fit and finish go with the HK variants. I like the HK USP compact in .45 and would vouch that it is the best from experience. The 1911 compacts are not reliable, certainly not reliable enough to carry concealed daily. <br>  <br>  Kahr makes nice concealed carry pistols but again, HK is the best IMHO|`|ZzR63qYRaa	To me I'd say Glock 30,I fired a lot of rounds through mine and it never malfunctioned, and it is more accurate than most full size 45s.
gUbzHOnmaa	The A's have a lot better offense this year and it means that the AL West is there's for the taking. The Angels did not do much to improve their team. If the A's are in playoff contention or leading the West near the trade deadline no one is moving. <br>  <br>  The A's starting pitching is their strength and it was what kept them in ball games last year. If it wasn't for the A's having the worst hitting coach in Major League history they could have competed for the division as well last year, but of course that didn't happen because Ty Van Burkleo refused to do his job and get his players to hit for a better average.|`|GD7FIO25aa	No, you need pitching to succeed in the AL West, and that they don't have.  They have a pretty good offense, but young and inexperienced pitching.  The Angels lost Teixeira, but they had the best record last year before they got him.  They lost K-Rod, but Fuentes can be just as good in that system.  The Angels will go on to win the division again. The A's can't make up the amount of games from last year.|`|ACGBj2liaa	I AM Him  the A's have pitching it is just young,  my son wrote for Scout.com 3 years ago mostly about the A's minor leagues, some of those guys are here others gone, we have a chance if the Angels slip a little, that is what Beane is hoping for. we will know how good they are about 30 games into the season|`|Lu607L7Zaa	i dont think that a's will be that good this year mabe finish .500. they dont have a good pitching line up. and still they cant compet against Angels they are way better|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	no pitching|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	very un-A's like..........and i love it<br>  <br>  GO A's!!!!!!!!|`|vw201sblaa	i just dont think they have enough talent, along with pitching, and then pile up the fact that they have a reputation for trading at the deadline, so that may scramble things up a bit as well, making them lose more games then they should. And then, you rarely see teams go from terrible, to great, most of the time its a gradual incline, so if they do improve, itll only be by about 10 games i think. :)|`|v0FVM6vHaa	They don't have enough starting pitching even if everything else goes right.|`|W4ydOMYjaa	they are better...<br>  but<br>  not better than the angels....|`|PMSSoTqNaa	yeah i think so, and their pitching is better than people give them credit for

1a1d63b050745400846bd3903bef99d4aa	Maradona fue mejor que Pelé....no me importan sus más de 1000 goles si los marcó con el Santos en América. El fútbol de Europa es mas fuerte y Maradona ganó mucho aquí con el Nápoles, Sevilla y Barcelona. Logró el mejor gol de la historia de los Mundiales a Inglaterra y fue capaz de hacer una pillería al más estilo D10S al marcar con la mano un balón aéreo sin que el árbitro se diera cuenta...a esa maravilla se le llama "mano de Dios". Pelé ganó mas Mundiales y es un grandísimo jugador pero Maradona...lo dicho...es mucho Maradona.<br>  <br>  Ducktoy|`|OGrA1txzaa	La respuesta no deja lugar a dudas el mejor a sido DIEGO ARMANDO MARADONA.|`|e3331d063914f770bd4b33e09ff6aa48aa	tu mismo lo dijiste el rey pele, la pelusa es buena , pero su apodod viene de algo muy mal hecho y aparte es cocainomano|`|QgW9s6eaaa	para mi ninguno para mi messi|`|VaI8Uje5aa	Sin duda alguna Pele.

Ambos nacieron en países que son potencias mundiales en cuanto a fútbol se refiere. Ambos muy parecidos en su contextura atlética. Ambos No. 10. Pero quizá la diferencia que determina quién es el mejor no está en lo extrafutbolístico, sino en la realidad que les tocó vivir en su momento, en especial, en el ámbito de selección, Pelé jugó siempre al lado de otros diez genios, mientras Maradona no tuvo más que a su lado a diez simples guerreros. Así, el fútbol, pienso, se hizo más fácil para Pelé y más meritorio para Maradona. Esa es la diferencia por la que puedo decir que Maradona fue el mejor.|`|0JU00HAVaa	fueron expetaculares lo dos|`|7e5fee7aa40496ad9d42e898cb94f227aa	pele|`|85b8272f0d505ebde72df3710faf7218aa	La respuesta es simple, Pele, Maradona no hizo nada mas que la mano de Dios y por eso gano el mundial, es decir por un despiste del arbitro y hacer trampas, eso sin contar con que ha consumido y consumira drogas, entendiendo que a saber si no las consumia antes y por eso corria como corria... Pele gano mucho y como persona es 1000 veces mejor que Maradona... <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|HHeStwhUaa	Sin dudas que es, fué y será... Diego Armando.

You can't the only real person that makes sense is Triple H, like him or not. Triple H and The Undertaker both have a lot of locker room power, loyalty and respect earned by the old guard has a lot of weight backstage so if they want to demand something they can. They need to do what is best for business and storylines, generally that is what they do.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	Of course he does.|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	If you think that you know absolutely nothing about Vince or Triple H himself.  He has worked his a@@ off to get where he is!  Taker is the one who said he didn't need to win the elemintaion chamber match!  He was having a match WM anyway!  In fact it is the fans not Taker that is wanting him to have another title run.  HHH has not asked to be the champion and if you would do a little research you see that he has said in several interview that he doesn't need to be the Champion.  Anyone that thinks othewise does not know what they are saying!  Everyon thinks he and Vince each have these super big ego's because that is what they see on TV.  They are nothing like that.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	LOL he was doing back stage politics long before he married her , he was a member of the clique - they are well known through the wrestling world - of course he uses politics , h e may deserve to be champion , but that many times ? get real he is a sly person .|`|4tvI9WYjaa	gees have a cry triple h does not get special treatment cause he married stephanie and is vince son in law  he work his a$$ off to get where he is   not cause off steph or vince but triple h was born to be a champion|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	You bet he does.

54XYA1XZaa	I coach my LB's to read the uncovered lineman.  In a 5 front, unless they are eagled the offensive Guard will be the uncovered.<br>  <br>  The offensive lineman can do 6 basic steps, or reads.  He can Down block (Block down on nose)  He can come straight ahead at you. He can Pull inside(Like on trap, counter, sometimes waggle) He can pull outside, on sweep, or to kick out TE.  He can Reach block (Hard 45 step to the tackle or a seal block on ILB. Then he can Pass block.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds confusing but with plenty of practice on reads you can get pretty good at reading.<br>  <br>    As a LB we take what is called a read step or a zit step.  I is a half step forward.  It takes you closer to the action giving you only an instant to read and react.<br>  <br>  Lets take the Down Block.  On the snap of the ball the OG blocks down on your Nose tackle .  You fill the hole directley infront of you.  It will be Dive, or a full back will be leading on Iso.<br>  <br>  OG comes straight for you.  Fill whole directly infront of you.  (Take on block)<br>  <br>  The OG pulls inside.  Usually you will see a trap or a counter.  Depending on your defensive scheme the LB's do different steps.  If you are in a defense where you have two inside backers, say a 5-3 or a 4-3 so you are the only ILB You Phil opposite A Gap from where OG started.  So if he starts on the left and pulls right.  You fill Right A gap.  A good aiming point is off the OG backside (Butt) after he crosses center.<br>  <br>  The OG pulls to the outside.  He is either pulling for sweep or for a kick out block.  The LB attacks his A gap to check gap then, flows to the football.  Again a good aiming point is off the pulling guards backside.<br>  <br>  Reach Block.  The Guard is blocking on a Outside zone play or something off takle.   You have to check you A gap and scrape to football.  <br>  <br>  Pass block.  Now it is a different read on play action.  But on a 3 or 5 step drop the OG will make a kick step, and set up for pass protection.  When you see this.  Open your hips and drop to your designated zone.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Now every defense is a slightly different read but these are the basics.|`|BVe32H7naa	all i know is if they drop back its a pass play, & if they block immediately either forward/right or left it's a run play.|`|1c1fd7eb3a0235d61ddb77cc0dee1be8aa	ok if you a linebacker you need to be watching everyone.more importantly than watchinthe linemen is watching the QB, hes the one that tells you if its a pass or run. If he drops back to pass you need to drop back into your zone the linemen wont give it away as much. however if its a run play and a guard pulls running behind the other linemen to one side to block on the end or outside linebacker thats where the ball is headed. but is could also be a boot, so you still wanna keep an eye on the QB.|`|v3okWSQaaa	Hmm.<br>  I don't quite understand your question.<br>  However, I play linebacker AND offensive guard, so email me and ask.<br>  spencerstanley@rocketmail.com|`|xZxLj0JKaa	i really don't know
Xk8z820Uaa	well the way my coach teaches me to tackle is<br>  but you NEVER EVER EVER stand there you always run towards them, if you stand their, they are more likely to either truck you, juke you or if they are really good, jump over you.<br>  so....<br>  <br>  1. step into the ball carrier, (you step into the ball so, if the ball carrier has the ball in his right, your left then you step with your right foot)<br>  2. wrap up, (grab onto him tightly around the waist, as you go in for the wrap keep your head up and using your shoulders into his gut, have your shoulder to target the gut).<br>  3. as you have done that, then you would push up a force at a 45 degree angle and push your legs as they should be bent.<br>  <br>  ps. remember to keep your head up, most players get neck injuries because they go into a tackle all wrong with their heads down,<br>  <br>  so remember.<br>  step, wrap and push them back. if you do it all right and you run at a fast force then the tackle will be hectic the second you hit impact,<br>  <br>  heres a video on when it is properly done..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-LHc3Z2gPg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-LHc3Z2g...</a><br>  <br>  this is not my team. nor do i own this video, but this would show a clean good hit.|`|Lu607L7Zaa	never tackle with your hands the RB or WR will run you over. lower your shoulders get low hit him put your hand around the guy bring him down. dont ever stand and wait u will get hit hard go for the person|`|IE1LvgD9aa	If you stand there and wait for him he is going to run you over or juke you every time.You have to attack!|`|v3okWSQaaa	Break your hips down right in front, attack on the inside hip of the ball carrier(so no cutback), put your head on the ball, wrap up completely, roll your hips when you lift, throw down.
ACGBj2liaa	first you want to make a block the RB can make a play off of, if your to slow he blows by you and you look like a douche for not hitting anyone, to fast and linebackers cut behind you and again you look like a putz, you have to learn to read the play, the RB's speed, it takes time and practice, but when you hit someone act like you are knocking them into next week. they will think twice before jumping in front of you to make a play especially wussy DB's here is an example if you lead block in say A gap you hit the first guy you see plugging that gap, square your shoulders, plant feet and drive him anywhere to leave room for RB, on a sweep pull and look for the first guy to hit, work with the RB and see if he likes to cut inside or outside, or listen to coach he always knows best.<br>      good luck|`|J7TKG7Hfaa	In football, you never want to run at someone at full speed to tackle them. You always need to be balanced and controlled when approaching them. For a fullback, you'll need to get low and power them straight at the legs...

5fVZJ3ERaa	i really doubt those times. If you do the 200m in 28.56 then you must have some amazing endurance to do 2 200s consecutively, each less than the time to do one of your 200s straight up. But i know you do not have the endurance because if you do the 100m in 12.86, then you should AT LEAST be in the 26 sec range for your 200m.  One or two of these times are off.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Your 200 time is not very good when you look at your 100 and 400 times.<br>  You should be able to run the 200 much faster.<br>  The 400 time is good.<br>  You need to stay with the coach's training program you are not going to be able to do another program during the season.<br>  Eat healthy and stay away from junk foods, drink plenty of water.<br>  Warm up before running and cool down after.|`|eELS8zSRaa	Those are pretty good times, when I was in 8th grade I did<br>  <br>  100m: little more than 12<br>  200m: 26 seconds<br>  400m: 52 seconds<br>  <a href="http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/records/outdoor/men/hs_outdoor_records.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/records...</a><br>  Those are the actual records for high school, go check them out.<br>  <br>  And those are great times, I got conference in both the 200m/400m so you're doing great! Keep running the 200/400m while running the 100m in practice still. Maybe you can pick it up later?<br>  <br>  Also I would start running long distance after practice if you can? Or more sprints if you don't have the time in practice to do a lot of them.|`|l7iZhjoSaa	I would stick to the 400, because that time is an amazing time for a 13 year old, considering that that will hold up in a relay leg at the high school level. Your 200 time to tell you the truth is not that good, considering that your split for the 400 at 200 should be faster, so I believe that your 200 can be A LOT faster I know of 13 year old's that can run high 25's. I think that you could be good at any of those events, though I would do the 200 and 400 combo if I were you. As for training do conditioning training. That involves sprinting for longer distances for more time, quantity over quality.<br>  There isn't much you can do to improve your times except conditioning, so try this: run a 200 in around 30-33, rest for 30 sec, then do another one at the same pace, repeat six times then take a 5-10 minute break in between, jog around to get rid of the lactic acid build up, grab some water. Then repeat the whole process again. When you're done with the second set take a 10-15 minute break, or however long it takes you to get cool down a little. Finally do a 200 as fast as you can, take around a 2 minute break, then do another one.|`|lkKvfVRdaa	Once you get to a reasonably high level these times will get completely destroyed. At 13 you should (if you want to be competitive at State level) be running at least 11.5's over 100m. Your 200m needs to get down to atleast 26 as well. Your 400m seems ok. Try dropping a second off and you'll be reasonably competitive. <br>  <br>  Find yourself a sprint coach. One that knows what he's talking about. Train three nights a week after school. Get him to work on your technique, that's where all your speed will come from. I wouldn't be too concerned about hitting the weights yet. Not at your age anyway. Just work on your fitness, technique, and develop some tactics for how you run your race (for the 400m and 200m).
rK74l2hpaa	Mine does the same exact thing, I usually wait a week or so and pull the trigger and it works. I have never upgraded mine, so im not sure the problem i think the problem on mine is that it isn't shot enough to get the gears moving. So once it starts working again try to shoot 300 rounds through it a week or so.

b5d3986c6fa45aca76d7de43538a83b6aa	Sí existe la corrupción en los mundiales en el 78 ganó argentina porque la dictadura así deseó y porque argentina compró la selección de Peru que fue corrompida por los argentinos para que la Selección Brasile?a no continuara en el mundial (el portero de Peru era argentino naturalizado Peruano e por mucha plata le vendió este jugo a los argentinos), en el 86 el gol de mano de maradona la cosa mas fea en un mundial, una tranpa que mancha la historia del futbol.<br>  <br>  Después en el 90 cuando jugó Brasil y argentina y la llamada agua bautizada que los argentinos habían bautizado con drogas Y habían dado para los jugadores de Brasil la bebida de modo que los Brasile?os no pudieran jugar a su normal el propio maradona confieso en la televisión esta historia a poco tiempo, entonces mi amigo Uruguayo Brasil siempre sufrió da?os por una Conmebol que ayuda los argentinos y una FIFA que ayuda los europeus.<br>  Si no tenía tanto robo contra el Brasil nosotros ya los teriamos 6 o 7 títulos mundiales. En 50 la partida entre Brasil y Uruguay fue un jugo igual pero Uruguay ganó porque marcó 2 goles y Brasil 1 gol entonces fue merecida la victoria de Uruguay. <br>  <br>  Nosotros Brasile?os no nos quejamos de los da?os que nos causan vamos en otro mundial con el orgullo herido y ganamos con la garra, honor, dignidad y "jogo bonito", o alguien tiene alguna excusa idiota y mentirosa para no concordar con algun de los títulos de Brasil lo de 1958 (Pelé, Garrincha, Vavá, Zito, Mazzolla, Didi, Gilmar, Zagallo), 1962 (Pelé, Garrincha, Djalma Santos, Zózimo, Nílton Santos, Zito, Didi, Vavá, Zagalo), 1970 (Carlos Alberto Torres, Piazza, Everaldo, Gérson, Tost?o, Jairzinho, Pelé e Rivellino) la mejor Selección que el mundo ya vio jugar, 1994 (Romário y Bebeto), 2002 (Ronaldo, Rivaldo y Ronaldinho) que el Brasil ganó con todo el mérito de su fútbol maravilloso que encanta el mundo.<br>  <br>  Uruguay tiene una buena selección, buenos jugadores pero excusas como esta que ustedes utiliza para perdonar los fracasos de su selección no ayuda en nada que Uruguay vuelva a ser grande. Es en los fracasos que el hombre tiene que levantar y hacer mejor, llorar como ni?os y culpar los otros por sus fracasos es cosa de la gente sin fuerza para luchar. <br>  <br>  Un Saludo desde Brasil<br>  <br>  Muy Bien, Muy Bien nico sigue pensando así que todos los fracasos de Uruguay si debe solamente a las ayudas a Brasil y de esta forma Uruguay será siempre una sombra de Argentina.<br>  Por Favor hombre tiene orgullo asume los fracasos de su selección y no culpan a los otros por su própia incapacidad.<br>  Porque no contexta a el Argentino Mixi que dijo que Uruguay fue ayudado a ganar la copa de 30 donde dijo que quién tendría que ganar sería Argentina, será porque tiene miedo de contextar a ellos???<br>  En Brasil nunca creemos cuando los otros países dijeron que Uruguay era una sombra de la Argentina pero ahora con su pregunta y sus explicaciones realmente yo tengo que concordar pero eso no nos gusta porque Brasil siempre respecto y siempre admiro el orgullo y el fútbol de Uruguay, pero ahora creemos que tanto el orgullo como el fútbol de Uruguay quedo la por los a?os 50 excesivamente lejos...............<br>  ni?os, ni?os, llorar, llorar por favor.................|`|LdoSKp1Caa	Cuando mencionas a Brasil. no identifico en que mundial se le favoreció, pero estoy de acuerdo cuando mencionas Inglaterra 66, y a Italia 34.<br>  Creo que Uruguay tiene un rica historia Futbolística, y siempre destacó por su garra.

Inglaterra ganando el mundial 66 con un gol que no fue,  e Italia ganando el 34 con la ayuda de <br>  Musolini. <br>  No podés decir que argentina robo el 78 porque si hubiese entrado el tiro holandes que pego en el palo a los noventa minutos del partido hubiesemos perdido y no existia ningun alargue. Directamente el campeon era holanda|`|c98564e3e276027430df43b1d46a96fcaa	Me parece el colmo que vos digas eso porque se sabe que  el mundial de 1930 estuvo arreglado para que Uruguay le gane a la Argentina en la final. Me explico: al finalizar el primer tiempo de la final, Argentina ganaba 2 a 1. Fue entonces que el jefe de la seguridad del estadio centenario entro en el vestuario argentino y les dijo a los jugadores que si les ganaban a Uruguay, no iba a ser capaz de asegurarles que los 80 000 espectadores uruguayos no los iban a linchar! Probablemente hubiera ocurrido porque en esa epoca la FIFA era amateur y no podia hacer nada para mantener el orden. Ademas se le aviso al mejor jugador argentino (Luis Monti) que su madre habia sido raptada! Todo esto es VERIDICO. Su madre no habia sido raptada pero Monti no quizo salir a jugar el segundo tiempo sin averiguar antes que su madre este en buena salud. Fue una politica de intimidacion vergonzosa para que pueda ganar Uruguay,y en el segundo tiempo -o milagro!- Uruguay dio vuelta el partido y gano 4-2! En ese entonces, el pais que organizaba el mundial tenia todos los derechos. Esto recien cambio en los anios 70 gracias a la television y con la comercializacion del futbol ya que la gente empezo a seguir los partidos por TV y se volvio imposible robar de una manera tan descarada. Igual, no se puede negar que los paises que juegan de local siempre fueron favorecidos: le paso a Alemania en 74, Alemania de vuelta en el 2006, Francia en el 98, Argentina en el 78, Inglaterra en el 66 etc etc. Pero igual eran todas grandes naciones futboleras y tenian el nivel para ganar el mundial. No era el caso de Mexico, de Corea o de Espania que tambien fueron favorecidos en sus mundiales de manera escandalosa pero no tenian el nivel para salir campeon del mundo, mismo con la ayuda de los arbitros.<br>  <br>  El unico mundial honesto que ganaron los charruas fue el de 1950, y tuvieron suerte que Argentina no lo juege porque en las 3 copas americas anteriores a ese mundial Argentina siempre le habia ganado a Brasil y a Uruguay, con lo cual era visto como el favorito logico para ganar el mundial. Pero bueno, ese mundial lo gano Uruguay en buena ley porque Argentina decidio boicotearlo luego de las presiones brasileiras (que no querian que vayamos porque asi pensaban asegurarse el titulo de campeon mundial. Les salio para el culo a los brasileiros!).<br>  <br>  PS: No quiero desprestigiar al futbol uruguayo porque son un pais de 3 millones de habitantes y ganaron TODO, lo cual es algo extraordinario. Todos los argentinos le tienen un profundo respeto al futbol uruguayo. Es el unico futbol que respetamos en el continente americano, junto al futbol brasileiro claro! Uruguay siempre ha sido una de las grandes potencias futboleras en el planeta. Pero si averiguas lo que te digo de la final del mundial 1930, veras que tengo razon. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|ff20e87ad8dd4ea3ce4acbf193b141aaaa	Grande equipo en 86 y perdieron por 6-1?

Luego lo del papel que tenia lehmann no se si era el dinero de la corrupcion o justo le acerto con el machete. Y lo de poner a Julio Cruz en vez de a Messi fue nuestro error<br>  <br>  Final 2006 : Francia - Italia: quedemos de acuerdo en que barthez nunca en su vida atajo un penal, pero lo del cabezazo de zidane (y eso que lo respeto mucho) fue o para destacar su ultimo partido o para cobrar el cheque de 20 millones.<br>  <br>  por lo tanto parece q ultimamente el ganador del mundial sera el que tenga mas dinero en el bolsillo|`|yS4Oym82aa	Concuerdo con vos, la copa de Inglaterra fue una verguenza, la de brasil en el 94..bueno tenia que salir campeon por el hdp de joao havelange y el unico equipo que podia sacarle la copa a ese brasil era argentina y con todo lo que hicieron al diego era mas que evidente. Y en la del 2002..no recuerdo una copa mas vergonzosa en la historia, arbitros favoreciendo a corea del sur y a brasil en una forma tan descarada..y bueno el futbol es un negocio mas que un deporte.

Sí sabes de futbol y ademas lo sigues por eso conoces algo que solo aquel que ve un minimo de futbol lo sabria.<br>  Y sobre lo que planteas, el futbol es una herramienta muy poderosa que es utilizada por las grandes marcas para venderle sus productos a la masa consumidora de este espectaculo. Estoy de acuerdo contigo en que no se deberia lucrar a costa del futbol y menos aun cuando se beneficia a ideales antideportivos por ser nocivos para la salud publica.<br>  Tal vez las leyes ya existen aunque no se cumplen pero no por eso hay que matar un deporte tan apasionante como el futbol.<br>  Saludos y para la proxima elige mejor el blanco de tus reproches que en tus anteriores preguntas (a excepcion de esta) no esta bien justificado|`|ea23483a382d17b2a721388a573fb35eaa	Ya ven por que los productos omnilife son buenos para la salud, jajajajaja.<br>  <br>  No te moleste Elizabeth, asi somos de llevados aquí, esto es pura carrilla y claro que reflexionamos y no solo las cervezas, checa la publicidad de los cigarros en el deporte.|`|r8XQr9Ofaa	Te faltaron el Queretaro, Atlante, Necaxa, Monterrey, San Luis, etc..<br>  <br>  Y lo que tu dices que con solo ver la playera con esa marca ya se le antoja a la gente, es algo muy poco frecuente. El verdadero objetivo de las empresas, segun la MKT, es siemple presencia de Marca, esto ayuda a que el consumidor recuerde la marca, por que no es lo mismo comprar una cerveza que no vez anunciada en ningun lado a comprar una cerveza que tu vez en la palyera de tu equipo, en TV, periodicos, revistas, etc.<br>  <br>  Ademas, la venta de cerveza en los estadios es de los principales ingresos para los Clubes, por ejemplo Chivas que tiene un contrato con Sol, aunque no aparce en su playera, tiene la exclusividad de vender ese producto en sus partidos.<br>  <br>  Y como tu misma dices en tu pregunta, no creo que sea nocivo si se toma con moderación. Y espero que no sea tu ultima pregunta, por que me parecio buena..  Saludos!|`|vKs6nc1Waa	claro que si es nocivo sobre todo por que muchos se creen directores tecnicos otros los mejores jugadores del mundo y hay hasta a quienes les duele mas que ofendas a su equipo de futbol que a su familia...<br>  como deporte es divertido pero ya ves como es la gente bonita|`|CrjvyKJaaa	Amiga seguro le vas al ATLAS eres igual de amarga que ellos y a ti que chingados te importa si pisteamos o no!! muy nuestro pedo no???

0Cq6yQkTaa	The obvious answer is not to fight, avoid it at all costs. Fighting is bad even for the best fighters because it gives you a chance of getting hurt.<br>  However there are some situations where it is unavoidable and that's why I do martial arts.<br>  Use fluid motions, don't 'grapple' your opponent. Use your reach to your advantage if you can. Strike quickly and hard and don't linger on a strike. Don't stop until the opponent stops moving or yields. Fists are not the only weapons at your disposal, you can kick, use your elbows and knees, and of course use other weapons you can find.<br>  The best practice is probably to do the hardest punches you can as fast as you can from a standing position on a punching bag or similar.|`|4pyizcP5aa	if he is shorter then you need to know how to punch and use the length of your arms to keep him at a distance b/c being shorter he is going to want to fight in a way that is called fighting on the inside which is close to your body. if you let him get close it will be harder to release your arms.<br>  <br>  for someone taller you would fight them just the opposite. bend you knees, get low and go inside on them and hit them from close range.<br>  <br>  the key to fighting is to not allow the other person fight the way they want the fight should go b/c then you give them all the power in the fight.<br>  <br>  go to a boxing gym and learn there. plus don't get into street fights and if you do there is no honor in a street fight and ending it is the best thing you can do which is why the following are best for street fights...<br>  kicks to the groin, elbows, eye gouging, choking, grabbing and hitting, biting and others.|`|BMGiHYQYaa	well the shorter kid is probly slow keep ur hands up on ur cheecks and throw strate punches the whole fight but dont get to close cause he has the advantage in close, the tall guy u have to do somthing i like to call counter punching if he throws all these big round shots simpilly bend ur body duck ur head and then as hes of balance from mising drop the straightest right hand and the hardest uv ever thrown on his chin if he dosent go down he will be hurt BAD then just get in kinda close not chest to chest but close enough so his arms cant really reach around and through as many hard punches as u can but just watch keep ur eyes open for any big punches hes a big boy so he will be slow but powerfull dont wrestle with him if he grabs u throw an uppercut to his face hard but another thing trust ur self if u dont trust ur self then ull lose

1uSoU8Lpaa	No way is Brett going to deal with "divulging" Packer secrets. He'd never do it. He loves to play, he's not unhappy he came back. The media is grasping at straws.<br>  Brett Favre is a competitor, I grew up watching him. He is incredible and the 6 touchdown game was amazing. <br>  I belong to the Church of Favre. I have no hard feelings against him, I wish him the best in New York, and the media can move on to something else.  I believe it's the media who can't stop searching for a story.|`|eNt9C860aa	Im not sure about the 6 td game and that stuff, but I think he's extremely bitter towards Green Bay and Ted Thompson as well as Mike McCarthy and it wouldn't surprise me to find out he was giving away information like that.  If thats the case, the media has every right to tear him apart because thats a completely classless thing to do.<br>  <br>  I'm also more inclined to buy into it given the fact that he admitted to talking w/ Vikings coaches while "retired" so I wouldn't put it past him to try and screw Green Bay one more time.|`|ghUm8M3laa	I don't know.  It seems to me that Brett is doing a fine job discrediting himself so I don't know why the Super Secret Media Conspiracy Committee would get involved.  It probably has something to do with Roswell, NM.|`|tPaRZod9aa	It was just a rumor, and its over with. Brett has more class then that, everyone knows it wasnt true.<br>  <br>  Besides, Lions need a miracle, not a few pointers.|`|xipzB5Tgaa	I spent my childhood in Wisconsin. I'm a devoted Packer fan and also a devoted Favre fan. So I say this in all honesty. Favre is the one who discredited himself by being a wishy-washy Charlie Brown for the last two years and toying with Packer fans' hearts about his retirement. True, others have retired and come back; but not in the manner that he did. He settled for a worst team than Green Bay to "prove himself" and when he doesn't win in the playoffs or either make the playoffs, he will say that others were right about his retiring and he'll do it again. This time he won't come back because he'll realize his mistake in leaving Green Bay. Meanwhile, Green Bay won't be hurt at all since Rodgers learned everything he knows from Favre. And he will quietly relish that fact. He tried to give up a couple years ago by playing poorly, realized that wouldn't work in the eyes of Packer fans. So he came up with this scheme that will work for him. But in the end he did discredit himself in the eyes of Packer fans. But due to the numbers he put up in his career, no one (except me) will ever say anything.|`|AA10614163	I couldn't agree more. I hear every day how much I'm holding on to the past but I watched the best ever for most of my life.  If I were a Jets fan I'd be celebrating. He may be aging but a Brett Favre team always has a chance to win.  I think they want to pet Aaron Rodgers.  They kiss his a$$ like he's a superstar but the Packers have set him up not to fail with their 2 yd passes all game long...|`|Tk78IDpBaa	How about you stop worring about what other people think of an NFL player and go about your business?<br>  <br>  |`|XtyQy0jGaa	i already think brett farve should have retired last year,  he had his whole career at greenbay butt he is always going for more money.

And many "types of bowling" weren't even introduced then....It's easy to be the best among a few but it requires real talent to be THE BEST among the best.

You said Bradman didn't face McGrath, warne et al.  Tendulkar didn't play against Larwood, Voce, or Bowes.  You said that many of the bowling types used nowadays did not exist then.  Larwood bowled at about 150km/h on uncovered pitches with batsmen wearing a couple of leg pads and gloves.  And as I keep saying over and over, if it was so easy to have a high average back then why aren't more batsmen from that era in the same region.<br>  <br>  So to sum up, Tendulkar, like WG Grace, Victor Trumper, Frank Worrall, and Viv Richards is the best batsman of his time, but not the best of all time.|`|VCHCanJnaa	Tendulkar should be on top and he and Gavaskar would be the only ones to make it in to the aussie top ten it would be much higher skill not with players  inside the top 10 as batsman with a average of 41 ahahahahahahahahaha lol that's soooooooo **** he wouldn't get a game here in australia you see we have standeds|`|WjSyLVtFaa	1.SM Gavaskar 10122 51.12 <br>  2.SR Tendulkar 11939 54.02 <br>  3.Dravid 10279 54.10 <br>  4.S Ganguly 6961 41.93 <br>  5.V Sehwag 5125 52.29 <br>  6.VVS Laxman 6042 43.78 <br>  7.M Azharuddin 6215 45.03 <br>  8.DB Vengsarkar 6868 42.13 <br>  9.GR Viswanath 6080 41.93S<br>  |`|Ef607Kfwaa	Azharuddin is better then Sehwag and Dravid, Shastri is better then Laxman who shouldn't be on the list <br>  <br>  1) SR Tendulkar<br>  2) SM Gavaskar<br>  3) M Azharuddin<br>  4) R Dravid<br>  5) DB Vengsarkar<br>  6) GR Viswanath<br>  7) R Shastri<br>  8) VS Hazare<br>  9) SC Ganguly<br>  <br>  Yeah that what I would say|`|yr9GMHqaaa	anwesha- your frivolous statement of Tendulkar as the 'all time best cricketer anywhere' is ridiculous- Tendulkar is not fit to tie Sir Donald Bradman's shoe-laces.....as he himself admitted in an interview with 'The Don' himself while he was still alive...........he was happy to be even compared to him but in no way is anywhere near him now or ever.........|`|qKDBml4Jaa	1.
