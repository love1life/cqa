However, there is a program called iPod Access that will temporarily block your iTunes and will take the songs off your iPod and put them back into iTunes for you. It's free at this link: <a href="http://www.jakeludington.com/downloads/20050420_ipod_access_for_windows.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jakeludington.com/downloads/2...</a><br>  <br>  It might ask you to pay for the full version, but you don't have to. You can do it quickly by fives with the free version. It's really easy to figure out and works well.
nntRdg9eaa	Call into your provider and ask them to block all premium text messages. :)|`|AA12181093	Don't type out the words please stop sending messages or anything like that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just hit Reply then type STOP, hit send & you should receive one final text confirming that your texts will end or stop with them.<br>  <br>  <br>  I had this problem when I signed up for text alerts with Weather bug.  Verizon's tech support was the one who told me how to do this after fixing another issue with my phone.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit after viewing this answer:<br>  <br>  If sending STOP won't work, then call your cell phone provider & have them block text messages for one billing cycle.  That should stop the texts completely.  If that doesn't work, change your cell ph #.
m8QGphI0aa	hi I decided to get an ethernet cable 4 months ago when I got xboxlive instead of the wireless adapter. It has worked great so yes it should work fine. If your xbox isn't near to the wireless router I would go for the wireless adapter however if not go ahead with the ethernet cable. They are pretty cheap and affordable and they are just as good as a wirelss adpater. Hope this helps :)|`|fLYMqZ8zaa	Yep, a long ethernet cable is fine. Note that your router 'strength' may not be the issue- it could be that you have not got a high enough internet speed. Test it with the ethernet cable and if it works fine, ignore my advice on internet speed.|`|8V3z1bd5aa	Well, go to the Dashboard,<br>  Test connection (i think)<br>  X-box live connection, it will tell you whats wrong<br>  Good luck.

Some computers have a 2MP camera though.

qv25Q4aaaa	Well on the 360 yes there are games that you can download for free BUT they are pretty much just trials and demos, not 100% full blown games.<br>  <br>  if you buy yourself some "microsoft points" then you can download anything you want, even FULL games|`|QxtdyNvgaa	i hope you like your 360!|`|8V3z1bd5aa	Sorry, you can't, at least that's what i know. You can download demos and game trials off of marketplace.<br>  Good luck.
noU2uKEoaa	When you buy a branded phone ( in your case Orange) you do so at a subsidised price. That is, the network absorbs some of the cost of the phone since the phone is locked to their network. Network branded phones will have specific software installed to <br>  enable you to gain the most benefit from your network operator services such as internet and WAP services.You should contact your network or visit one of their stores if you think a software upgrade is required. Your handset manual or technical services department will be able to advise you on the keypad commands required to display the software/firmware version of your phone.<br>  The use of third party software may case damage to the handset and will likely invalidate any warranty claim as the phone has been "tampered with".<br>  <br>  If branded phones are a problem you can purchase the same phone SIM free which means it is already open to all network sim cards.<br>  The downside is the phone will be more expensive as there is no network subsidy.<br>  You don't specify the particular problems you have but they are unlikely to be due to the branding of your phone, more likely due to a handset malfunction.<br>  <br>  Note:-  All UK mobile phones which carry a network brand are now "locked" to that network sim. If another network sim is to be used then a network unlocking code (NUC) or subsidy code has to be requested from the network. This may incur a charge.|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi its not becuse its got the orange software in the phone infact it doesnt matter if you've got the sonyericsson software in the phone ! the software in these phones are a common fault if your phone is under waranty then take it to an orange store & get them to send it away for repair ! if the phone is under waranty & you start debranding the phone then it invalidates the waranty on the phone ! i have a k850i & my phone is generically unlocked i.e its never been locked to a network from new & i had problems with mine so i sent mine back to sony & they sorted it out for me & since then ive not had any problems... hope this helps|`|fLYMqZ8zaa	I'm sure there is a way to do it for free but would you rather use some dodgy non-guaranteed method that might break your phone or pay ￡10 for professional software and the knowlege you probably won't break your phone. Note that it may not be the branding that slows the phone down- it may be you have so much music, so many pictures and so many contacts that is making your phone sluggish.|`|2c681c5f6e2e4e1cbfeab89982abdd65aa	Might be worth trying the Sony Ericsson update service first. It's free to use and downloadable from the website.<br>  I recently used it for a w760i and they're renowned for software problems and locking up etc. Seems much better since that (touch wood!).<br>  Just make sure you follow the instructions to the letter or it could all go horribly wrong.

Those are pretty good combat games. Microsoft Flight Simulator isn't exactly what you'd call a "combat game" but it is pretty cool. Even my grandpa likes it. He's been playing those things for years. Since like late 90's. I haven't tried the HAWX demo yet but... I know it's not TOTALLY realistic but have you tried warhawk online? You can set up an air battle only mode and it's really fun and the planes, or "warhawks" handle great.<br>  <br>  I really wish they would come out with a game like that too. They have Ace Combat 6 on the 360 but I wish they could port it over to the PS3 and stuff. And it would be wrong to have a game called MICROSOFT Flight Simulator on a PS3.

JjKpIoxAaa	It really depends on what you are wanting in a new netbook computer.  Here are the main differences between the NC20 and NC10 models (NC20 specs are listed first, NC10's are second):<br>  <br>  1.  Bigger screen (12.1" vs 10.1").<br>  2.  Better screen resolution (1280x800 vs 1280x600)<br>  3.  Bigger keyboard (97% of normal vs 93%).<br>  4.  Larger chassis size (11.5x8.5x1.2 vs 10.3x7.3x1.2).<br>  5.  A little heavier (3.3 pounds vs 2.8 pounds).<br>  6.  A little lower battery life (3 to 5 hours vs 4 to 6 hours).<br>  7.  Higher cost ($599 est. vs $480).<br>  <br>  By far, the main "pro" for the NC20 is the bigger screen.  <br>  <br>  The main "pro" for the NC10 is that it is available now in various colors (black, white, and blue).<br>  <br>  The NC20 is not for sale in the US as yet but Samsung tells me to expect it around mid to late March.  If the UK release is any indication, the NC20 will only be available in white at first.  Other colors will likely follow soon.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm waiting for a black NC20 although the NC10 is a very good product.  As for a price drop on the NC10 in the near future.... maybe.  It is already priced a little higher than other 10" netbooks.  My guess is that the release of the NC20, as well as other manufacturers upcoming releases of 11.6" netbooks, may add additional pressure to drop the NC10's price to about $399 to $429 or so.|`|WnxCyGVAaa	Hang on for the nc20.

6GIrW5eWaa	the number from the first responder is correct. The other answers are as follows.<br>  <br>  Call MS and they will walk through some troubleshooting steps and determine what you already know. It needs to be sent in. They will give you a return authorization number that needs to go on the outside of the box. During this call they will determine if it is or is not warranty. <br>  <br>  They can repair this issue once received. <br>  <br>  Not sure of the cost, if out of warranty they will request a Credit Card for the repair.<br>  <br>  3 to 5 weeks is the normal turn around for most issues. Could be shorter, doubt it would be longer but could happen as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck

akvrwpywaa	LCD's are crap in general, it's not a brand-specific thing.  They are prone to dead pixels if pressure is applied to the screen (something hits it, someone pushes on it, etc.) and this damage is, for all practical purposes, irreversible.  It sounds like that's what happened to your TV, which is why they'd need to put in a new display.  In fact, some manufacturers will even sell brand-new TV's with a small number of dead pixels and include an arcane disclaimer in some place that few people pay attention to.  If it's been going on that long, I'd just get a whole new TV, and not an LCD.

VOSyb1fcaa	No. Here's why:<br>  <br>  1. It's really slow<br>  <br>  2. It can't download. That means no plug-ins, that means no for most games and videos (sites like Youtube work, but they're still really slow)<br>  <br>  3. It's blurry (poor quality)<br>  <br>  The only plus side is that you can't get viruses and families won't need to fight over the computer.<br>  <br>  So really, unless you really need another internet browser, it's better just to stick to the computer. <br>  <br>  I'll take it free, but it's not worth the trouble of getting 500 Wii points.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	pointless, just use your computer.|`|EpvHhbByaa	No, the flash player is trash and the web browsing... *sigh* words cannot express how inconvenient it is.<br>  <br>  The only reason why I have it is because it was free when I downloaded it.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	Honestly, I have it, and unless you don't have a computer it is pretty useless to you, there really is not much you can do with it.|`|nmkIVZfVaa	no way...<br>  there are wii download sites that give you unlimited downloads for like 50 bucks. take a look at this site i found...<br>  <a href="http://www.thewiidownloadsreview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewiidownloadsreview.com</a><br>  hope that helps dude..|`|SlQD7cpnaa	yes its much funner with internet u get to do things that u wouldnt regullry get to do without internet!!!! <br>  <br>  cj

A little Silver box should pop up with blue text saying "Download this video to RealpPlayer". And there you go, click that and another window pops up. A red bar will pop up letting you know how much is downloaded, if you have problems. Refresh, or click download video again.<br>  <br>  When your donw it should be in your library.

hJP9y6kjaa	I disagree.<br>  <br>  Tubes are much less fragile than you might think - the only times I've ever broken tubes is when I a) leave them out in the garage or wahtever and they are subjected to freezing temperatures, b) when I've dropped them, c) when I've not paid attention to the retaining clip while taking them out of their socket and twisting too hard.<br>  <br>  I've never had a tube blow on me. I've also never purchased the cheapest tubes I could possibly get, though. Maybe that's a problem with some people? You get what you pay for to some extent....<br>  <br>  You should take care of your tubes, though. Always use your standby switch, leave it on standby for 1 minute before you power up all the way, if you aren't playing it for a while (ie 15-30 minutes or more) then put it back on standby, and leave it on standby for 1 minute before you turn it all the way off.<br>  <br>  I have normally replaced my tubes every year, although this is usually overkill. Every 2-3 years should be sufficient if you're only playing a few times a week.<br>  <br>  Preamp tubes aren't expensive - maybe 12-20$ a pop. Power tubes *can* be expensive, and they need to be matched, which can raise the price a bit. I wouldn't bat an eye at paying over 80$ for a matched quad, I would completely expect it to be in that range.<br>  <br>  Tubes rule, especially when you can swap them out for other types of tubes. An amp that takes 6L6's can also take EL34's and KT-66's, for instance - and each type has a different sound to it. You will need to have your amp rebiased, but that's not too crazy.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the new purchase... the only real drawbacks to tube amps is a) they're heavier than solid state amps, b) 100 watts is a lot of power - you'll have to turn your amp up to get it to sound really good. Consider getting an attenuator (ie THD Hot Plate, etc) so you can turn it up and get that "cranked" sound but still have reasonable volume levels. Another option is to get a booster/overdrive pedal to hit the tubes harder and get a more wicked crunch without having to turn it up so much.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Pretty much "yes" to all your questions.  Just make sure the amp has cooled down before you move it around a lot.  Tubes do not like being subjected to shock when they are warm.  They are pretty expensive and many musicians have a spare set on hand.  They should last a few years with normal playing.  You might consider getting a solid state amp for gigging - they are much more durable.
VJ1C5JsYaa	First off there is just about 0% chance that xbox live will ever be completely free.<br>  <br>  secondly A run down of the two different types of memberships: Gold and Silver<br>  <br>  Gold Membership<br>  <br>  Xbox LIVE Gold is a premium membership that lets you play games with friends online. Gold membership includes all the features of Silver (below) PLUS additional benefits and features.<br>  Multiplayer games: Invite your friends into a multiplayer match and compete against each other or play co-op through expansive adventures.<br>  Marketplace: Gold members get early and exclusive access to select game add-ons, demos, trailers, videos, and more.<br>  TrueSkill matchmaking: For every ranked game you play, TrueSkill finds the best match for your skill level.<br>  Parties: Invite a group of friends into an Xbox LIVE Party, then you can all join games and play and chat together.<br>  Gamer feedback: Use the feedback system to select players you want to play with (or avoid) the next time you're online.<br>  Watch Netflix movies: Xbox LIVE Gold members who also belong to Netflix can watch Netflix’s extensive library of streaming movies and TV shows right on their console at no additional charge. <br>   <br>  A Gold membership costs $49.99 for one year<br>  <br>  <br>  Silver Membership<br>  <br>  Xbox LIVE Silver is a free service that allows any Xbox 360 user with a broadband connection to get online and interact with the Xbox LIVE community.<br>  <br>  Gamer profile: Showcase your online reputation and achievements for your friends to see.<br>  Avatar: Share the customized Avatar that represents your online identity.<br>  Friends list: Add other Xbox LIVE users to your friends list and chat using the headset or send text messages.<br>  Marketplace: Download free content from Marketplace such as demos, trailers, music videos, dashboard themes, and lots more.<br>  Microsoft Points: Redeem Microsoft Points (available at retail stores or through Xbox LIVE) for extra game content, Arcade games, movies and TV shows, independent videos, and more.  <br>  Gold Weekends: Look for special offers from Xbox LIVE that let you experience the excitement of multiplayer gaming free.<br>  <br>  The Silver membership is free BUT you can not play with other people.|`|fLYMqZ8zaa	Silver Membership means u can talk to people on Xbox Live, but you can't play with them online. You need a Gold subscription that costs about ￡40 ($50) per year that lets you play with everyone on Xbox live (as long as you have the game!!) but I heard a roumour they might be making it free soon...|`|RpCwfcRzaa	Silver is the base membership. It allows you to access the Xbox Live Marketplace where you can download movies, TV shows, game demos, and extra game content like map packs and expansions. It also allows you to send and receive voice/ text messages and privately chat (1 on 1) with a friend. Gold is what you pay for and it allows you to do everything Silver does along with online multiplayer, Party Chat which is 8 people in a private chat, and access the more high profile game demos a week before Silver users. It costs $8 for a month, $20 for 3 months, or $50 for a year. You can buy pre-paid cards in stores or pay for it over Live with a credit card. If you plan on playing Live multiplayer on a regular basis, I'd go with the year. Gold will NEVER be free so don't believe that. It's what makes Microsoft all the money on Live. If you're connecting to Live for the first time, select a Silver membership in the membership area and it will ask you if you want to try a month of Gold for free.Select yes and that way you can try it and see if you like it enough to pay. This can be done up to 3 times on a 360 to give people who share a console a chance to try Gold, but each time you need to make a new gamertag.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	If you camera does not have a mic jack, the only thing you can do to improve audio is to get close to the source of the sound (maybe a person speaking?) and make sure there is as little background noise as possible.  That is a general principle when using any microphone or camera microphone.<br>  <br>  There is no wireless microphone that can connect to a camera without a mic jack.|`|3CJAUyqPaa	Since you did not tell us which camera, we have no way to know what capabilities it has through that hot shoe.<br>  <br>  Certain consumer Canon and Sony camcorders have a shoe that includes specific - and special - mic connections - but if you are using a DSC or DSLR, it is likely that hot shoe is only for flash control. The Sony Active Interface is smaller than a standard shoe and only certain mics made by Sony will work. The Canon camcorder hot shoe is standard sized, but only certain Canon-branded mics will work. In either case, the compatible mics are typically listed in the camcorder's manual in the Optional Accessories section.<br>  <br>  Having a mic input is only part of the equation - manual audio control is also required for recording "good audio". If the audio being recorded is really loud, there is no mic in the world that will limit the audio being recorded when the auto-mic-gain "feature" is used. Only manual audio control will be able to limit the loud audio getting written to the storage media. As well, if the audio is really low, the auto-mic gain will "listen" for audio - upon playback, this sounds like hissing or whooshing. Using manual audio control bypasses the auto-gain and can eliminate both these issues - and an external mic is not required... but helpful.<br>  <br>  You could get a field recorder like any of those from M-Audio, Zoom, Edirol, Sony, Marantz and many others. When you edit the video, import the audio from the field recorder, sync with the poor audio from the camcorder, then mute the camcorder audio...

This is not uncommon on Thursdays because Thursday is the day they update the Playstation Store with new content.<br>  <br>  If your signal strength is low, try turning your router's antenna so it's exactly perpendicular to the line between it and your ps3. Do the same with your ps3. If it stays low, find an online how-to for making a parabolic signal booster out of household materials. This fits over your router's antenna and concentrates the signal in the direction of your ps3. <br>    You can't put a Pringle-can antenna on your ps3 without opening it, so a signal booster is the best last resort. If wireless won't work, consider getting a long ethernet cable.<br>    Bad wireless strength has nothing to do with PSN.

Xxviy63Paa	Yes, all you need to do is go to a Radio Shack and spend 3 or 4 dollars on an RCA signal splitter. You may need an extra RCA cable too. You might need more than one signal splitter if you're planning to record audio along with the video.<br>  <br>  If your capture card supports video pass-through so you can watch it on your pc monitor, you could just use the pc monitor for the stuff you record. You might as well do that anyhow - you will pretty much need to use standard definition resolutions. HD capture doesn't work well unless you use expensive equipment.<br>  <br>  Any dvd player that has an input and more than one video output would work also. So would a vcr with 2 outputs.

3CJAUyqPaa	No. There is no adapter.<br>  <br>  The only camcorders that allow direct connection to an external hard drive have a firewire port and are generally miniDV tape based. Check the FireStore drives from FocusEnhancements.<br>  <br>  The Sony HDR-SR11 is a hard drive based AVCHD camcorder - that does not have a firewire (DV) port. It has a USB port - but it will not do USB streaming. It has an AV-out port for analog video - You might be able to use this along with a "capture card" from Canopus, but your computer will need to be part of the mix... of course, this assumes you figure out a way to disable the camcorder's built-in power-down process (highly unlikely).|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Get an adapter

You would have to get a USB ethernet adapter (to make another ethernet port available on the laptop to connect the 360 to), set up internet connection sharing on the laptop (as described in my page below), and sign onto your internet using your laptop. Boot the 360 and you'll have Xbox live.<br>  That is, unless your dorm also restricts the MTU size.  (More details regarding that also at my page below)<br>  <br>  The PPPoE credentials that the 360 does support allows you to connect directly to a PPPoE modem, which wouldn't work for you.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Little confused by the ethernet wall jack and when you say "However i still need to put in a password to connect on my laptop.".<br>  <br>  If you do not use a modem of some sorts to connect to the internet and only need to plug into the wall jack then you are on a school administered network. Which I don't know if your school will allow the xbox 360 connection. You will need to have your own network through phone, cable, or a wireless card. Perhaps check with some of your other residents to see if they have xbox live setup in their rooms and ask them how they did it. Or possibly as your schools network admins if they can assist. The reason you will want to verify this can be done is because sometimes troubleshooting a  xbox connection requires to reboot router or modem which sounds like you have access to neither.
PUPFWEZxaa	It is nearly impossible to provide detailed specifics without knowing your viewing habits or what type of viewing environment you have, however I will provide a few basic guidelines and recommendations.<br>   <br>  The Optoma HD80 DLP projector is a very good performer in its price range and it produces a sharp and moderately bright image once it has been properly optimized (and/or calibrated) to achieve its best image fidelity. I highly recommend that you start by basing your screen selection criteria on running your Optoma HD80 projector in the low power lamp mode, i.e., setting the Brite Mode to Off in the Lamp Setting menu under SYSTEM settings. While you’re at it set Image AI to Off. As a result you will likely need to adjust the iris on the projector to nearly full-open, give or take, depending on—among other factors—the particular movie or video content. These settings will not only help reduce the fan noise level and power consumption but will also help to extend the life of the lamp thereby reducing your operating cost. (The OEM replacement lamp assembly for the Optoma HD80 projector has a suggested retail price of US$479.99.) The following are a few other recommend settings. Under the IMAGE - Advanced settings menu set Noise Reduction, True Vivid, and Edge Enhance to 0 (i.e., Off.) Set Degamma to Film, Color Temp to Warm (if you will not be professionally calibrating your projector or using another user’s recommended color temperature settings,) and experiment with the Gamma setting to achieve optimum shadow detail. Under the DISPLAY menu set Format to Native (i.e., Optoma’s setting for 1:1 pixel mapping.) Overscan should be set to 0 if you will not using your projector to watch a lot of television. The Color Space setting should be set to Y′CbCr when viewing Blu-ray Discs and television content. Also, when it comes to watching movies on Blu-ray Disc it is beneficial to take advantage of the projector’s support for native 1080p/24 signals (providing the projector firmware has the proper EDID support.) Likewise, you will also need to make sure that you are using a BD player that properly supports 1080p/24 output. For more projector-related information, if you haven’t already done so, I highly recommend that you read through the relevant AVS Forum discussions and HD80 reviews to which I’ve posted links below.<br>   <br>  Most DLP projectors such as the Optoma HD80 offer a fairly limited range of projector placement. Using a (16:9) 100-inch diagonal screen, the 1.2× zoom lens allows for a “throw” range of only 161 inches to 193 inches, which of course necessitates placing the screen on your 12-foot wide wall. (For the best performance you should give strong preference to mounting your projector to the ceiling. Use a heavy duty ceiling mount, for example an inverted projector mount such as the RPA156, RPM156 or RPMA156 models from Chief Manufacturing along with a 6- to 9-inch extension column, to properly mount your projector to the ceiling.)<br>   <br>  If there will be any ambient light in your room during viewing then you may want to use a gray high contrast screen material with a screen gain toward the higher-end of the typical 0.9 to 1.4 screen gain range. Just be aware that, among other things, the higher the screen gain the narrower the viewing angle and the worse the image uniformity. Therefore, when it comes to selecting a screen size, you will need to balance the latter with projector light output, ambient light control, the number of viewers that will occupy the room at a given time, your goal with respect to image fidelity and your budget. Speaking of budget, you will be best served by using a fixed-frame screen (preferably with a black velour finish) if you want to keep your costs to a minimum. I encourage you to read through the Da-Lite resources listed within my Yahoo! Answers to which I’ve provided links below.<br>   <br>  There are several manufacturers of video projection screens from which to choose. Focus on projection screen materials that have been optimized for HD video images and have a screen gain of 0.9 to 1.3. A diagonal screen size of approximately 100 inches would be a very good match for the Optoma HD80 running in low lamp mode (with ~450 to 500 real-world lumens of light output) in a moderately dark room.<br>   <br>  You can obtain fairly good performance from lower cost brands such as Carada and Elite Screens; so I recommend starting there if you’re on a tight budget. Another wildly popular and extremely inexpensive projection screen is Optoma’s own retro-reflective Panoview GrayWolf II? high contrast, high gain (1.8) screen. The Panoview GrayWolf II screen may be a bargain IF you do not expect more than three to four viewers clustered reasonably close together at any one time. With such a high gain screen, however, you may be able to get away with using a 106-inch screen. Other higher performance—albeit more expensive—choices would be Da-Lite’s High Contrast Cinema Vision or HD Progressive 0.9 screen materials or any of Stewart Filmscreen’s latest G3 screen materials. Throughout the screen selection process you should take advantage of the interactive Projection Calculator Pro utility on ProjectorCentral’s Website to verify which screen size, screen gain and projection variables will provide the best performance for your viewing environment. Also do not neglect to take into consideration the viewing distance, which will be optimum (and minimum) at roughly 1.6 times the diagonal size of a 16:9, 1080p image - depending on the source material, your viewing environment and your visual acuity.<br>   <br>  ######################## RESOURCES ########################<br>   <br>  Carada<br>  <a href="http://www.carada.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carada.com</a> <br>   <br>  Da-Lite Screen Company<br>  <a href="http://www.dalite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dalite.com</a> <br>   <br>  Elite Screens<br>  <a href="http://www.elitescreens.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.elitescreens.com</a> <br>   <br>  Stewart Filmscreen<br>  <a href="http://www.stewartfilmscreen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stewartfilmscreen.com</a> <br>   <br>  Panoview DE-GWII9106E GrayWolf II?

Neither of these types of camcorders use a USB for download.<br>  <br>  With minidv (cassette) camcorders you can't erase sections, you have to record over the sections. Just buy another cassette and once it's o your computer, rewind and tape over.

Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder.

There's a telescope being build that will have a 3200 megapixel sensor.<br>  <br>  As for what you can actually buy, the other posters have your answer.|`|i5OVORXgaa	There is no maximum... in fact, the newer cameras seem to come out with more and more.<br>  <br>  The Leaf Afi 10 which is a digital back for medium format cameras has 56mp and it's very expensive!!! I'm sure you won't need that though.<br>  <br>  Having more mega pixels doesn't make your camera better... it just means you can make bigger prints easier. You might want to read Ken Rockwell's article on the Mega Pixel Myth:<br>  <a href="http://kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm</a>|`|SmWoRu3kaa	There's no actual maximum; right now, the highest available is something like 37.|`|OdlhvQ4xaa	As we sit here the highest i have seen on the market is 24.9 megapixels , but you are talking thousands to own one of those bad boys, and the truth be told, you can win photo competitions with any camera, if you take your time to learn what it will or will not do. Happy Snappin to Ya
mhvb9eFkaa	I have seen prices ranging from exactly $40 all the way up to $99.<br>  What is the difference?  I couldn't find any!  I bought the $40 and my dad bought the $99 and after installing both, I could not tell the slightest difference.<br>  Hope this helps!

qGfAlDd2aa	A lot of it depends on what you want to watch and how much of that is in a particular programming package.  Get the package from the provider that gives you the most of what you want for the least money.<br>  <br>  We've been Dish subscribers for about 8 years and love it.  We will never go back to Time Warner.  Dish is less expensive, more dependable and they have only raised their rates twice in 8 years.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	In general - they are a Coke vs Pepsi decision.  They seem to leap-frog over each other with more channels or better equipment every few months.<br>  <br>  Right now - I dont believe DirectTV offers the Tivo box which used to be a big selling point for Direct.<br>  <br>  The Dish 722 HD receiver is an outstanding dual-tuner HD box with great software and features.  It won "Best of the Year" in magazines last year.<br>  <br>  Dish has also gotten aggressive with HD and offer packages that include only HD channels.<br>  <br>  So right now - Dish seems a better choice.  I suspect Direct will try to top this in a few months.

TbTO5SXlaa	Congratulations on your new camera. The XS will serve you well.<br>  <br>  The best way to learn to use your camera is to actually READ & STUDY the Owner's Manual that came with it. Another good learning aid is the Guide written by David Busch ( <a href="http://www.dbusch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbusch.com</a> ) for your camera.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to learn to use the camera's built in light meter in Manual Mode. Actually setting the shutter speed and f-stop (aperture) yourself will do two things: 1) Show you the effects of different combinations of shutter speed and f-stop and 2) Slow you down.<br>  <br>  I really believe that digital photography often causes people to develop what I call the "machine gunner mentality" - take 300 pictures and hope a few hit the mark and are worth saving. Someone will likely tell you to just shoot and shoot and shoot. In my opinion this is no way to learn unless all you want to learn is how to press the shutter release.<br>  <br>  Good photography requires thinking and thinking requires time. You must learn to see (in your mind) the picture you want to make and then (initially) think about how to make it. I encourage people to develop what I call the "sniper mentality" - one exposure, one good picture. "Pictures are not taken, they are made." Ansel Adams.<br>  <br>  While you are learning to use your camera's shutter speeds and f-stops you'll also want to be learning about light and composition and ISO. Your local library should have a good selection of books on photography so take advantage of them.<br>  <br>  I also suggest subscribing to at least one photography magazine. Read the ones your library has and choose one to subscribe to. My personal favorite is Shutterbug.<br>  <br>  When looking at a scene, try moving a couple of feet right and left. Sit down on the ground. Stand on a bench. Zoom in or out. Don't just look at a scene and immediately release the shutter. Think about what you want the person looking at your picture to actually look at. That's called a point of interest.<br>  <br>  For the very best results always shoot at your camera's highest resolution and use a low ISO.<br>  <br>  Learn to pay as much attention to the background as you do to the subject. Pictures of people with trees or poles growing out of their heads aren't very flattering. Power lines running thru  people's heads are also a no-no. Pay attention to the sky. If its an overcast blah day work to keep as much of the sky out of your picture as possible.<br>  <br>  I suggest making the following purchases: A UV/Haze filter, a circular polarizer filter and a lens cleaning cloth. Your lens - if its the usual 18-55mm lens included with the camera - uses 58mm diameter filters. Do not waste your money on cheap, no-name filters. Buy quality: Heliopan, Hoya, B+W, Tiffen, Singh-Ray. Buy both filters in a "thin" or "slim" mount to prevent any possibility of vignetting (dark corners on your image) at 18mm. The UV/Haze filter is to protect the front element of your lens. The polarizer is used to darken a blue sky and to remove glare/reflections from glass, water, sand and painted metal - but not polished metal. It also enhances colors. The cloth is to clean your filters.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Canon Rebel XS is a great camera to start with.You can fine the differ from XS and XTI here.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fremote-comparison%3Fie%3DUTF8%26asins%3DB001CBKJGG%252CB000I1ZWRC&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|i5OVORXgaa	Here's a side by side comparison that you can look at:<br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=canon_eos400d%2Ccanon_eos1000d%2Ccanon_eos450d&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  Tips: Don't be afraid to use it on manual!

O0KAySsNaa	1. How long is my iPod covered by Apple's warranty?<br>  Your iPod is covered for one year by Apple's Limited Warranty for iPod. Warranty service for eligible repairs is available at no charge for twelve months from the date of original retail purchase (date of purchase).<br>  <br>  2. How can I tell if my iPod is in-warranty?<br>  ? Your iPod is covered by Apple's Limited Warranty for iPod for one year from the date of original purchase. To determine your warranty coverage, enter the serial number of your iPod in the Online Service Assistant section on the Apple Support site. Apple may need to examine your proof of purchase document to verify your iPod's warranty status.<br>  <br>  Note: The service coverage information described at the Apple Support site is based on the date of purchase information available to Apple, depending on when or whether you registered your product or if you purchased it from an Apple authorized reseller. If you believe that the information is inaccurate, please update the information by contacting Apple using the appropriate links on the Apple Support site.<br>  <br>  3. Can I extend service coverage on my iPod beyond the warranty?<br>  The AppleCare Protection Plan for iPod extends the service and support coverage for the iPod, its included accessories, and iTunes software to two years from the original purchase date of the iPod. The AppleCare Protection Plan for iPod must be purchased while the iPod is covered under Apple's Limited Warranty for iPod.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	depends on how long ago it was purchased and then registered|`|DEIxwvKPaa	nope.  the warranty is up.

AA10912074	Both Nikon and Canon make excellent cameras that can do what you want to do.  They are different but not too different.  I don't think you will be disappointed with either.  <br>  <br>  Suggest you hold them in your hands to see how they feel - too heavy, too light, too big - can't get your hands around them, too small, your hands get in the way.  <br>  <br>  People that have bought the Nikon D40 or D60 love them, people that have bought the Canon XS or XSi feel the same.

uym2BFVYaa	I experience the same thing sometimes between my boyfriend's cell phone and mine.  We both have Blackberries, but on different providers.<br>  <br>  I am fairly certain that it is a problem between the providers, and not the phones themselves.  Usually when I can't send/receive messages with my boyfriend, I will test it with my sister who is on the same provider as me and it works fine.  I assume it would be the same for you... a problem between Verizon and Sprint.<br>  <br>  I don't have any really scientific explanations... I think it's just about the connection between the different towers used for different companies.  And stuff gets backed up.  Sometimes if I try to send too many messages to my boyfriend (if it's not working), all of a sudden he'll get them in a big flood and vice versa.  They get stuck in that middle ground...<br>  <br>  If you want to avoid it, when your contract is up I would suggest switching to Sprint.

4G41Z3RJaa	A Direct In Dial line is one that you can use to call a PBX extension withoug going through the Attendant.  The DID is a specialized line that passes exta information to the PBX to allow the call to be connected to a specific extension by dialing a seven digit (or ten, depending upon where you are calling.  Plain Old Telephone Service is a single line that you can use to receive and to make calls.  POTS can be a single business line or a single residential line.  Using POTS to a PBX all calls will go through an Attendant or a Call Director to all calling to an extension.

AA11256390	No, legally if you upgraded your handset and took out a new contract as long as you cancelled and returned within the 7 day distance selling law then they cannot hold you to the contract. Unless you were upgrading early in the contract then you will still be liable to the remainder of however many months were left before it would've come to an end. If you had a contract with a high street/online store but upgraded directly with the network I'm not quite sure what happens there. Basically, speak to the people saying you still have a contract and explain that you cancelled and returned within 7 days and that the law covers this.

j5Apt8hWaa	There are actually charts that will tell you what various size memory cards will hold with various camera resolutions settings.  <br>  <br>  BTW where did you get the information that each pixel has 24 bits? ... That is a JPEG and BMP figure and sensors also and saves image data to RAW files.<br>  <br>  RAW = 12 or 14 bits.<br>  TIFF = 48 bits<br>  <br>  You can find charts in your camera owners manual.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	approximately 100|`|eVptHOOBaa	Do you need a theoretical or practical answer?<br>  <br>  In theory, 24 bit is 3 bytes (one byte is 8 bits), 5 megapixel, is roughly 5 million, so times 3, that's 15 million bytes, or a little short of 15 megabytes. 512 megabytes divided by 15 is about 34....<br>  <br>  But, if cameras stored pictures that way we would've been in much trouble, because being able to fit only 34 pictures on a 512mb card would've been a disaster!<br>  <br>  So the images as they are saved to the card are always compressed. Now this is the question of how they are compressed. A compressed 5MB RAW image, would take about 8 to 10 megabytes, because they are unprocessed, and compressed using a lossless method, meaning when uncompressed they'd come to exact same form they were in. RAW is a lot of work to do later, even though it gives you the best quality. So most people (professionals aside) save their pictures as JPEG files. Jpeg is a lossy format. What it means - when uncompressed the result will look very close to original, but not exactly. To what extent? At low compression ratio - nearly unnoticeable, at high compression ratios - very bad. The way JPEG works, in simple terms it rather than saving a picture pixel for pixel, it splits it into small pieces, and comes up with "formulas" to approximate each piece, rather than saving all of the data. The more variables you put in the formula, the more exact recreation will be, but the more space it will take. Also, if picture is uniform in colors and shades, it will take less data to recreate, if it's very color rich, more data...<br>  <br>  So basically with JPEG, how large a file will be depends on:<br>  1. Level of compression<br>  2. Subject nature<br>  <br>  Typical JPEG sizes for 5MP vary from camera to camera. I would say from 500KB to 3MB per file. All depending on your settings. That means your 512MB card will hold from 170 to 1000 JPEG files depending on compression, or around 50-60 RAW files....<br>  <br>  LEM.

They have recently upgraded to their own DVR service, but it works exactly the same as the original TiVo, so I'm a happy camper.
AbRfd29Haa	The first tape recorders were called "reel to reel". You had a reel of tape, you would thread this past the tape heads, and attach it to a takeup reel. You could play the tape, then rewind it. When they went to stereo, they built tape heads with two parallel music tracks, to allow for both channels. And most of these allowed you to flip the tape over and record the other way.. adding two more tracks in the other direction. So in essence, this was a 4-track design. Most of the 4-track decks when I got into recording (the 1970s) used 1/4" wide tape. More expensive professional tape decks used wider tape widths, to allow for more tracks and/or better quality. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel-to-reel_audio_tape_recording" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel-to-ree...</a><br>  <br>  A cassette (properly called a Compact Cassette, introduced in 1963) is essentially a pair of small reels, with the tape permanently attached and housed in a protective shell. This was much more consumer friendly, but retained much of the same characteristics of reel to reel, including tape reels that mounted on two moving hubs. They did some compromises here, though. They changed to 0.15" tape, to keep it small, and they ran the tape at 1-7/8 inches per second.. most open reel decks could go to 7-1/2 inches per second. Tape speed was a bit like MP3 bitrate... the bigger the number, the better the quality. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_ta...</a><br>  <br>  The 8-track (officially called "Stereo 8") came out in 1965 as a very different kind of tape. It was based on a continuous-loop tape... there's only one reel.. the tape loops form the outside of this reel around to the inside, and as a result, it can play forever, never needs rewinding or flipping over. To store more information on the same tape, they put in four stereo tracks, all going in the same direction. A bit of metal foil at the splice point (as a continuous loop, there had to be a splice) was detected and used to move the stereo pickup heads to the next of four playback positions. <br>  <br>  8 track used the normal 1/4" tape, but with 8-tracks, it wasn't an obvious improvement over cassette. They also used a 3.75 inch per second playback rate, which did help on sound. <br>  <br>  But one of the cool things about the 8-track was also its downfall. Unlike the driven reels in the cassette, the 8-track's single reel moved freely, just pulled along by the tape. No mechanical reel made it easy to design a tape that just popped into a player and out, no need for the player to be told to unload. Movement of the tape was achieved by rollers at the opening end. 8-track could sound better than cassette, in the early days. But due to is design (both the cartridge and the need to mechanically shift recording heads), players were easily knocked out of alignment, lowering the quality. Meanwhile, all kinds of technology got applied to the cassette, as it was quickly becoming the standard for portable field recording. 8-tracks made poor recording units, due to the endless loop and the jumping between tracks.<br>  <br>  The relative huge size of the 8-track was probably due to the length of tape needed.. the slower cassette could use shorter tapes. Also, the back of the 8-track tape medium had to have a slippery coating, to keep the continuous loop mechanism functional. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_8" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_8</a>

aKBVJI0Faa	More compact than most Windows Mobile phones, the Pantech duo sports a dual-slider design, so you get both a QWERTY keyboard and numeric keypad. (It's actually kind of addictive.) Other highlights include high-speed HSDPA data and easy access to instant messaging. It's not nearly as innovative as the dual-slider Helio Ocean, and the keyboard could be better, but the duo still supplies messaging-savvy consumers and young professionals with a good all-purpose device that won't weigh them down.<br>   <br>  The dark-gray body with textured metallic trim has a simple elegance suitable for the boardroom or a night on the town. At 4.6 ounces, the 4 x 2 x 0.8-inch-thick Pantech duo slips easily into a shirt pocket and is lighter and more streamlined than the 5.6-ounce, 0.9-inch thick Ocean. (On the other hand, the Ocean justifies its bulk with a sharper two-megapixel camera, more robust instant messaging, better MySpace integration, and GPS.) The duo's round corners felt good in the hand, providing a solid grip even for those with large mitts. On the right side of the phone are keys for launching the voice recorder and 1.3-MP camera. We appreciated the raised volume keys on the left side.<br>   <br>  Sliding up the bright and colorful 2.2-inch (320 x 240-pixel resolution) display reveals a good-sized numeric keypad that makes for easy dialing. Flipping the duo horizontally and sliding out the QWERTY keyboard changes the orientation of the display to landscape mode (sometimes with a noticeable delay). We were able to thumb text messages, craft e-mail, and type URLs with decent accuracy. The duo's flat keys have a decent amount of depth, but the cramped layout takes some getting used to. Most frustrating is the placement of the soft menu keys in landscape mode; they're positioned on the extreme opposite ends of the keyboard instead of right underneath the menu options on the display.<br>   <br>  Multimedia options abound, but none exactly wow on this device. Riding AT&T's 3G network, the duo offers Cellular Video, which features programming from Comedy Central, ESPN, HBO, and other content providers. We launched a clip of The Colbert Report, which buffered quickly, courtesy of the HSDPA connection. However, even though the video stayed in sync with the audio, the picture quality was less than stellar. On a few occasions we couldn't tune in and were greeted with a "We are temporarily experiencing technical difficulties" message. A free three-day trial to MobiTV ($9.99 per month) offers a smoother experience and adds shows from The Discovery Channel, Fox Sports, TLC, and more.<br>   <br>  Users can sideload all sorts of music (MP3, AAC, AAC+, WMA) and video (H.263, MPEG-4, WMV) files to the Pantech duo via the microSD Card slot (which is located on the top of the phone for easy access). For now, you can subscribe to Napster ($9.95 per month unlimited) and Yahoo Music ($8.99 per month unlimited) from the phone, but they're sent to your home PC for downloading. Unfortunately, over-the-air music download services, including Napster Mobile and eMusic Mobile, won't be available on the duo. If satellite radio is more your speed, we recommend XM Radio Mobile ($8.99 per month after a free three-day trial) which streamed smoothly on this device so long as we were in a 3G coverage area. Pairing the duo with our stereo Bluetooth headset for an untethered audio experience was simple; a 3.5mm adapter is in the box for using traditional earphones.<br>   <br>  Web surfing was quite speedy. CNN.com Mobile loaded within 8 seconds; the mobile version of NYTimes.com took 13 seconds; and Gizmodo.com took 26 seconds. We found text generally easy to read despite the duo's small display, but some may prefer Opera Mobile 8.65 ($24 after free trial), because of its better page formatting and zooming options. Instant messaging clients from AIM, MSN, and Yahoo are included and performed adequately, and we like that they're easily accessible from the Today screen. However, it took the duo nearly a minute to log us in and display our contact list.<br>   <br>  Like all Windows Mobile 6 Standard smart phones the duo includes Office Mobile, which let us swiftly download and read and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint e-mail attachments. Speaking of e-mail, the included Xpress Mail client allowed us to painlessly set up our POP3 Gmail and Yahoo accounts.<br>   <br>  The camera implementation is a bit awkward. The live preview defaults to portrait mode, and it fills up only half the display. We'd prefer a full landscape view, and for the camera button to be positioned on the bottom part of the right spine instead of the top part. That would make it easier to hold and use the duo like a regular digicam. Image quality was fair for a 1.3-MP sensor, and we appreciated the quick shutter speed.<br>   <br>  Call quality was good in our tests. Other callers said we came through fine, and a test voicemail message we left on a landline sounded louder and clearer than one left with the AT&T BlackBerry Curve 8300.  With moderate
xUFw5MMhaa	It depends on what you want to do with your phone. If you are looking for a "plain jane" phone with no frills there are some relativley nice phones from Nokia, Motorola, and LG (The Chocolate and the VX5500 come to mind). If you are looking to do everything under the sun I would also recomend the Blackberry Storm or LG Dare. I have the LG Dare and love it! The touch screen is pretty responsive for text messaging and the quality of videos and photos is great! It also runs games very well and has an expandable microSD slot which I use to store photos and music.One of my complaints about the phone is that it sometimes is too sensitive and I tend to mistype stuff sometimes. The other is that it doesn't have cool apps like the iPhone. Before you buy a phone I highly recommend you do some research at these following web sites:<br>  <br>  Cnet Cell Phone Reviews: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/</a> <br>  <br>  PC Mag Cell Phone Reviews: <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,2806,2357,00.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,2806,23...</a>  <br>  <br>  I also suggest looking at the articles they have for picking cell phones for your needs and also remember that high speed phones like the Dare and Blackberry Storm will require a data plan in order to get the full experience of the web and videos.

And yes the xbox records your play time and stats.|`|IzJ0QgN8aa	Get XBL, first of all. Most games for the 360 are built for Live (Halo 3, Gears 1 and 2, CoD, etc.). Also, don't spend your cash on any stupid accessories like the wireless headset and mini keyboard. The wired headset works perfectly fine, and the mini keyboard's keys are far too small to type with. Also, don't bother buying the 60GB system, as an answer above suggests. The games that it will come with will most likely suck. Save your money for some good games, an XBL subscription, and some more good games. Here are some of the games I own: Halo 3, Gears of War 1 and 2, CoD: WaW, The Orange Box, Prince of Persia|`|Tqk7qTRoaa	Take a look on <a href="http://www.everythinglink.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythinglink.com</a> I got mine from there at Xmas much cheaper than other places I looked|`|BWtUpBXNaa	I agree the 60 GB is  a great deal.

You can play MK deception on it. if you go to gamestop they will have little letter that say BC meaning backwards compatible. check the games before you buy them. also get a hard drive and have fun. I don't know if they make premium, you can check e-bay though|`|PZGPcrLHaa	First I would advise you don’t buy it from Game but buy ins-store from GameStation instead. GameStation are much cheaper (even though they’ve actually been bought-out by Game / practically the same company). Don’t ask, I don’t understand why and neither does my work colleague who is actually a dm for Game. Game staff are generallly minimum wage incompetant morons (fact), cant speak for their online depo<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 hardly plays any old games, only select titles, some of which aren’t even multiplayer. You need live in order to play these old games because when you insert original titles - your xbox downloads emulation software inherent with that game.   There’s a list at MS which has been in circulation since 2007- ms said they would eventually update to accommodate more titles, they never did. There's currently around 300 titles which work. That sounds a lot (but isn't compared to the final 3,500 release total). Eg- Mortal combat selection is one of those unlucky unsupported, it will not work on 360. Additionally, you will also find a lot of original xbox games will not run through current VGA technology setups. Tvs and resolutions moved on since original xbox.<br>  <br>  Automatically recording how long you play- is totally dependent on the title and genre of game. Some games feature your progress (time spent playing, achievements etc), others don’t.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped - ultimately advise you to get a PS3 but you don't wanna read that :-)

XcF4L6KMaa	Actually, the last time I checked it was 249 up front, with a 50 dollar mail in rebate. But that could have changed. The phone will cost you an extra 30 dollars a month on top of your normal phone bill, because it requires a data plan. It comes with a 8 gb memory card, but will handle up to a16gb card. Yes the phone has a good mp3 player on it, I have 500 songs on mine right now, and it works great. The phone was a little quirky when I first got it, but I loaded the newest approved operating system, and it cleared up all the bugs I was having. I quite imagine by now they are shipping direct with the new software, so I don't imagine you will have any probs with it. The phone itself took a couple of weeks to get used to, but I do love it now. It has alot of features, and within a month or 2, they are launching an app store, comparable to what apple is doing with the iphone, so there will be alot of apps rolling down soon. It will do all the normal stuff a phone will do, like pix, text, record video, watch internet video, web browsing. Email is second to none, Blackberry leads the market on email.  I would say this is definitely a love it or hate it phone. I read alot of mixed feelings about it. But like I said I love mine now that I'm used to it.
xG5ZlJDqaa	Buy a used digital camera at your local second-hand or flea market. I saw a digital camera at Value Village for $30.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Ok, all digital cameras have lag time and review mode. Pictures take more quickly with fresh batteries and a class 6 memory card (whatever brand) at least 2 G. If you don't need the fash, turn it off. Many things contribute to lagtime. Turn review mode off. Use a tripod to avoid blurry. <br>  I like my canon a570i , but my sony takes pictures quicker. It is only a 4mp so takes less time to write.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	you wont find any under 50 dollars I can tell you that much. You will need to spend at least 70 bucks for one. Kodak makes the C813 but they are known to have latch problems. I would hold out for like a Nikon S210 or even the Kodak C893.|`|AA10929465	You are out of luck.  The cheapest digital camera I'd recommend getting is the Fujifilm Finepix F10, which is $110 on ebay.  Even the best camera doesn't take pictures by itself.  For one, if you having blurry pictures you need to get a tripod, get a much faster lense, or get a camera with image stabilization.  There are $20 Targus tripods that might do wonders for your current camera.  As for speed, this is another case of getting what you pay for.  My F10 takes less than on picture per second.  You'll need to spend money on an SLR if you want to take pictures really fast.|`|fe1fb057c5c82b734b2027481e503befaa	Keep what you have, anything you can find for under $50.00 isn't going to be worth the time it takes to go to the store to buy it. $50.00 digital camera = $50.00 spent on junk.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	check on dell.com<br>  I don't know of any|`|Jio3d8bYaa	they have great 99.00 camras in Costco. they look legit! :)

tzYbeZw8aa	I cant imagine any of those games being good, sorry.
lhzpq7ATaa	Go into the settings and set the backlight time to 10 seconds or so, and turn down the screen brightness. Turn off Shake Shuffle and Rotate Cover Flow if you don't use them. Use the hold switch whenever possible.|`|bPrR6IxBaa	Mine's not that great either but I'm always playing games on it when I'm using it so that's probably why.
6JdjvwRUaa	Yes it is possible.<br>  <br>  You don't need to burn them to a cd to put them on your zune.<br>  <br>  Open the zune software and go to the top right (settings). The first thing you will see are a list of where the zune finds your music. All you have to do is locate the folder that the Itunes downloads music into usually <br>  user/music/itunes/itunesmusic<br>  <br>  Once you add that folder you put any music onto your zune that has been downloaded through Itunes.|`|dfo5eKcbaa	It can be done and you dont need to burn to a CD you can add to the zune right from  i-tunes just sync your zune with i-tunes and if you really want a CD,just put CD in drive and make a play list on desktop and import to the zune|`|znxbqEv1aa	you can definately put it on your zune, i just odn tknow how you would do it|`|xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player. The easiest way is to burn the music to an audio CD and then rip it back to Windows Media Player or a similar program as an MP3. Or you can get some software to help you. I use TuneClone to do this. Though not free, it is very well worth a try.<br>  <br>  Below is its step by step tutorial about how to get iTunes 8 music converted to MP3:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-mp3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-...</a>
PKEGeibhaa	I've had the Glyde for about five months. During these five months, I have had to replace it three times. The touch screen is just very tempermental, and it leaves me not being able to click what I want to. Also, I would have problems with it randomly shutting off. You may want to wait until a newer generation of the phone comes out so that they can fix the problems that the first one came with. Verizon really has crappy phones though, so I guess its as good as any other|`|OsnCPSsoaa	I have several friends who have had both the Samsung Glyde and the voyager.  They like it at first but later they change their mind and they both stop working and get very annoying.  The Voyager is better than the Samsung Glyde if you need to get one of those two.  I would get the Env2 from Verizon.  Everyone I know that has it likes it and doesn't have problems with it.

ApZ0qS88aa	Dust is the likely culprit, try using canned air to at least clear out the fans, if you're out of warranty already you can crack open the case and give it a proper cleaning (canned air, not a vacuum cleaner) without losing anything.<br>  <br>  Make sure there's adequate clearance around all vents and elevate your power brick. Don't set the console on carpet make sure to keep the area around it dust free.|`|YSSJcy59aa	Whilikers and Andrews are right. Keep it in a flat, dust-free area with open space on all 4 sides, and not near or facing sources of heat (radiators etc.). You could try airing the vents with compressed air or vacuuming it may help a bit too if you want to get rid of the dust. The cooling fans, which is what I suppose you have, can help a bit, but the inter-coolers that are embedded inside the console are very risky; they can often mess up the 360 more than fixing it (not to mention your warranty is voided).|`|D0dcRRtMaa	I dont think there is much you can do for it if it already has the cooling fan. I did happen across this website a little while ago, looking for a similar solution:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/10091.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/10...</a><br>  <br>  You could try sending it in for repairs i guess.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.<br>  <br>  C17|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	Well there's always the towel trick.

Put it on a flat surface out in the open, and keep it away from sources of heat including vents, baseboard heaters, and other electronics.|`|Mboh3eVCaa	Give it plenty of room to breathe and get rid of that fan (most of them actually make it worse and can turn your xbox yellow).
dpRQeob8aa	Well I am sorry, but if your firmware is the official kind and it is NOT 2.60 or under, then you will need a pandora battery.

It really adds up. Also, keep it in a designated spot. I try to keep my phone in a zippered pocket in my bag, because it's easy to just leave it in a cab or a at a store. Lastly, keep it new looking by having a case. You can find really cute ones at Gucci or Coach, or you can knit one. Just for fun, I just remembered a cell phone horror story that happened last year. I had just gotten a new sidekick, and I was going to the movies with some friends. I had been texting, and when we parked and got out of the car I threw it into my bag. After the movie, I realized I didn't have the phone, and I assumed I had accidently left it in the car. When we went back to the car, it was dark outside and the phone was nowhere to be found. I gave up and said that i'd probably find it later. Just as I was about to close the door, I saw it lying on the grass. It had fallen out and lain there for a few hour!|`|bPrR6IxBaa	Don't take it out when you're drunk<br>  Pay attention to your usage<br>  Buy a case/sleeve for it

You didn't specify how old he was, what his interests are, or even if he might use it for his line of work.<br>  <br>  I'll make one recommendation, and he really doesn't have to be all that musically inclined to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  A Nintendo DS, and the Korg DS-10 software for it.<br>  <br>  The Nintendo DS is a handheld gaming device, but even if your boyfriend doesn't play many games, there are other things he can do with it.<br>  <br>  The Korg DS-10 software is not a game, it's actually an emulated version of a hardware music synthesizer/sequencer which could even potentially be used for professional music production.  It only takes a limited level of intelligence to figure out what each function does and it allows for an infinite number of possibilities.  If he has an interest in this sort of thing, he'll stay busy with it for hours.  See the link provided in my sources for a rundown of the features and even some examples of music.  It really is an amazing piece of portable software.<br>  <br>  Tell him to write you a song, and even sing it, hehe.<br>  <br>  I hope you'll consider it.|`|LfXJOk0baa	I think the best present i have gotten ( if you don't mind spending some money) was a dirt bike or a dune buggy. something that gets your boyfriends adrenaline pumping.|`|VbA5GiDVaa	hi i think a great gift for any male is an ipod touch. i love them as they never get boring x <br>  hope this helps .|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	ps3 160 gb.|`|n0uMBKtJaa	GPS system is awesome, especially if you guys like to travel a lot, keeps ya from getting lost.

It has 13.6 mega pixels and a 3.6x zoom. I recently bought this camera and have had limited time to use it. Although I haven't take a large quantity of pictures, the ones I have taken are phenomenal, even in low light situations. This camera also has dual image stabilization. The reason I bought this camera is because I was looking for a point and shoot camera that takes high quality pictures. In fact, Consumer Reports rates this camera Excellent for image quality while no other cameras are rated this well. It also takes nice videos. I bought mine for $180 from Amazon and they offer many different shipping services. Good luck|`|W1wDHUYoaa	theres quite a few.

AA11056614	No. But DVDs will play as upscaled pseudo HD on a Blu-ray player.<br>  <br>  Note there is no benefit to a Blu-ray player over an upscaling DVD player unless you have an HDTV and are willing to pay the ~30% premium for Blu-ray disks. Blu-ray players only make sense if you have a 1080p HDTV and a good sound system. Otherwise save your money and stick with DVD.<br>  <br>  EDIT: HoffDNA makes a point and it's valid for some, but the fact is there is a significant difference in price (~$200 vs $75, and that assumes they don't already have a DVD player) and, more important, DVD isn't on it's way out (at least not for many years yet) and for most people ... despite all the hype ...  won't see an appreciable difference from Blu-ray. So, sure buy Blu-ray if money isn't an issue and you have the equipment to truly benefit ... but for well over half the population that isn't the case.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I disagree with the first answer. The cost of BD players is so competetive now, it does make sense if you are continuing to expand your disc collection. Why continue to buy DVD if they are on the way out? Even if your output is not 1080p, I say go with Blu Ray. You can still play your old stuff, you can play new stuff, and when you're ready to upgrade your TV you will already have some excellent stuff to start watching right away.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	NO<br>  <br>  But BD players can play regular DVDs

GyZuqT4daa	Amazon has them listed for around $14.<br>  <br>  You can use any flash drive that will fit (I wouldn't buy anything bigger than a gig, it won't use it anyway). The reason they suggest that model is because Sony makes it and I don't know if you've looked at the back of your BDPS350, but the EXT port is recessed about and inch and a half so not many models of flash drives will fit.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	The USB port is standard so any USB Thumb-Drive will work just fine.

This is because of the problems that have been happening lately with Zune.  Although I know they updated it, it may not work.  But yes it does have a built in radio and it can wirelessly sync<br>  <br>  The iPod Classic is good if you LOVE music.  I mean, I have a 16 Gigabyte iPod Touch with not many songs, tons of apps, and 2 movies.  I still have tons of room left and probably will never fill it!  The iPod Classic  can hold 30,000 songs, 150 hours of video, or 25,000 photos!  That's A LOT!  But, I heard with so much memory, it sometimes freezes and everything.  Also, the screen isn't as big as the iPod Touch.  I'd strongly suggest the iPod Touch 2nd Generation 8Gigabyte ($229) or 16 Gigabyte ($299 but you could probably buy it cheaper on Ebay)  But, if you have a PSP or Nintendo DS I wouldn't think you'd need one.  This is because of all of the apps that you can get for the iPod Touch.  The iPod Touch can get radio IF you have Wireless Internet Router (<a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8741365&st=Router&type=product&id=1202648529130)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a>  Then, you buy an app, I'd get either AOL Radio or Pandora Radio.

On my windows machine I moved any oddly formated video file that I had into a separate folder than my regular videos. Using the file browser on the ps3 I then keep clear of the odd video format file folder. If you want to watch those oddly formatted files I would either install tvercity (another media server) on your windows machine or convert the offending files to a regular format. Try googling "lifehacker video converters" for some good suggestions.<br>  As a side note .avi files are capable of being oddly formatted.|`|jUNG80sZaa	I'd recommend installing TVersity on your PC.

You will NOT be able to view HD channels however. You need an HD Box for that. You might be able to watch HD shows that come on channels like CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX but thats about it.|`|bPrR6IxBaa	You'll still be able to view the same channels you are now. If you eventually wanted HD then you'd have to upgrade your plan and get an HD box.

H0cYxs4Xaa	I have resistance 2 and it should remember your checkpoints or the points were it breaks to a cut scene.  But try saving and quitting while in the middle of single player mode, or just try to reinstall the game data, I do not know what to tell you.<br>  <br>  Or when you started a new game it re-saves over the data before so wherever you left off on that level it will be erased you only have one single player file mode its not like other games where you can pick a profile than start.|`|1aqrRzqLaa	There are checkpoints and savepoints. <br>  <br>  Checkpoints are where the game will save your progress throughout the level. Very common. <br>  <br>  Savepoints are actual saves the game is making to the HDD, and happen a lot less often than checkpoints. When you die you won't respawn you to your savepoint but your checkpoint.

Jn7bt3JTaa	Yes. I was a freshman the year Nike First came out with Nike Airs. My Mom bought me a pair and Someone stole them while I was at P.E.<br>  I wore plain, simple P.E. shoes for P.E. and l put my Nike Airs in my Locker. <br>  <br>  I never found out who did it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: See the below links, and know that any Schmoe can learn to pick a lock over the internet.

The coaches surely do not realize, especially if there are two entrances or the locker room is far away from the gym.<br>  <br>  The stealer does not care if it's smelly - it's worth the couple hundred bucks (depending on your ipod). Because guess what? They don't just steal them. They sell them.<br>  <br>  This is actually good for you if they sell them - they might sell it to your friend or a jabbermouth who brags about how cheap they get it. <br>  Keep your ears open for any news of a ipod on sale. Heck, the stealer may not even know it's yours.<br>  <br>  What you can also do, is find the box in which it originally came in. On it, there is a serial number, which is also on the back of your Ipod. This way, if you suspect anyone of having your ipod, you can check it. Although they can change the 'name' of the Ipod, they can't get rid of that.<br>  <br>  In the future, whether it's this Ipod or another, at gym just give it to one of your coaches - he'll put it in a safe place like his office.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|8Ld9Dmgeaa	yeahh.... they lock the lockerrooms after everyones out at my school because of thiefy... sorry to tell u but it prolly got stolen....<br>  <br>  will u do mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqVVL96jOImpQIw61Ub4ow_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224153106AA2wxfY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|zKUzxPseaa	Proably, i had my purse stole from mine. and i had the lock like your. plus that makes it more noticable cause when there is a lock half closed you know theres stuff in there and easy acesse|`|9Gwc5Sxraa	Yep, I think it was stolen.

lHLDvVALaa	I've never seen rotary phones from GE. <br>  <br>  By far and away, my favorites are Western Electric. They're built like tanks, plus all of the subtle variations and refurbishments that they went through over the years are a collector's dream. <br>  <br>  Western Electric made the "gold standard" telephone. The vast majority of them still work great even 80 or 90 years after they were made with little to no working needed on them. That, in and of itself, tells me something. <br>  <br>  I have over 40 Western Electric telephones, and don't consider my collection anywhere near complete. <br>  <br>  A distant second favorite for me would be Automatic Electric, which later became GTE. Telephones like the AE40 were real classics, although they're not nearly as well-built or as reliable as WEs.|`|t4lza1Igaa	i like GE but i think Western Electric has better quality phones and the dials are smooth with dialing and have some cool features.|`|YFoCftplaa	GTE by far has the best rotary phones and they come in many colors and have some amazing features on it like long cords and a shoulder holder so that you can balance it on your shoulder when you talk!

AA10690306	Forget it, Sony purposely removed that capability to make you buy new games.  They only made 1 run of PS3's backward compatible before deciding to abandon their customer base.  It was purely a business decision.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting how many here are saying that Sony's own press releases were a lie.

YSSJcy59aa	Yes, the early generations (2005 to mid-2006) of the 360 did have cramped and ill-designed hardware, which caused problems (RROD) in many systems. Since then, however, Microsoft have improved the design; the Falcon chipset introduced in late 2007 greatly reduced the console's failure rates, and the failure rates went down 1-5% (which is average) when the Jasper chipset was introduced in mid-2008. If you recently got your 360 and still got the RROD, you're just unlucky - but Microsoft should fix it for you free of charge. However, it is still prone to overheating, but that can be taken care of. Admittedly, even as a 360 owner, the PS3 does have more reliable hardware.|`|AA11264416	well im not sure what percentage of the XBOXs purchased have got the "red ring of death" but i got a PS3 about a year ago, january of last year, and it hasn't given me any problems, never over heats no matter how long i play, even if it does it will give a warning telling me its over heating, i've played games and then watched a movie and played some more all back to back and never over heated, its worked just fine and i play everyday, all i play is racing games though, but i haven't heard of any problems the PS3 has had, the 360 might have more games but thats just because its been out longer so that makes sense<br>  <br>  also Sony actually sells the PS3s cheaper than what it took to make them, which isn't a profit for them but that tells you that they're good reliable products since they were originally $500<br>  <br>  <br>  Andrew - i could care less why they sell marked down, my point was that the 360 was having problems from the start until they did fix it with the newer ones, the PS3 hasn't had any problems, of course it might have been a few here and there thats normal but nothing close to how the 360, and by the way i don't buy a whole bunch of accessories, just 1 extra controller thats all so who cares that they mark up the accessories, im not a hardcore gamer since i have a real life so i don't buy a new game that comes out, all i play are racing games and only a few i've them i've bought and ended up selling once i beat them, i only have 2 now that i've kept because they're good games, the 360 still isn't as reliable like a PS3 especially since i've heard of some people thats had to send their 360s off 2 or 3 seperate times for the "red ring of death" and they have to wait at least a month to even get it back each time<br>  <br>  - haha fan boy? i know you wasn't bashing PS3s, i was just letting you know i don't care why its sold cheaper than what its made and i was just saying PS3 is more reliable, and by the way you wasn't really correcting me, you was just adding to what i said, so go watch star wars and finish your homework|`|ApZ0qS88aa	Yes, MS built their console to fail costing them millions in tech support and replacements as well as potentially exposing themselves to liability under consumer protection laws. It all makes sense as part of the following 4 step plan:<br>  <br>  1. Develop faulty hardware.<br>  2. Release faulty hardware to an unsuspecting public, angering thousands and handing a loaded PR gun to the competition.<br>  3. ????<br>  4. Profit.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Chevy,<br>  <br>  Nintendo is the only company currently selling a seventh generation console at a per-unit profit. Both Microsoft and Sony are taking a loss on every console sold due to high manufacturing costs as well as the astronomical cost of R&D. Ever wonder why you're paying $60-70/game and buying accessories at previously unheard of mark-ups? (I'm looking at you Xbox wireless adapter.) It's because that's where the money is for manufacturers. Consoles are sold at a loss to establish market penetration and install base then the losses are recouped in the form of licensing fees on 3rd party games and mark-up on accessories.<br>  <br>  Don't go all fanboy on me, nothing I said had anything to do with bashing your chosen console I was just correcting you and letting you know about an interesting facet of the videogame industry that few people are aware of.

I532I4o5aa	Personally in my opinion both of em are  nice, but I would go with the Nikon Coolpix S610. Not cause of the name or how many magapixels it has, but with the CoolPix s610, you would have better manual settings, a bigger ISO range and you have a little quicker shutter speed (which would be nice).. The only real advantage to the Olympus, is the Panorama setting and the price. Its really up to you though! <br>  Hope all goes well![=|`|j5Apt8hWaa	If your memory cards are xD, then the Olympus is the only camera that uses them, but for a very few older Fujifilm P&S cameras.<br>  <br>  If your memory cards are SD or SDHC, then you can use them on almost any P&S camera, including the Nikon Coolpix cameras|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>

3CJAUyqPaa	Try adjusting the shutter speed and have the camera as close to the foreground subject as you can. Even better, make every effort to have the backgound stuff REALLY far away.<br>  <br>  When you increase the shutter speed (likely defaulted at 1/60) to something faster like 1/500 or even faster than that, then there will be some depth of field created. This is the effect you are seeing - with the foreground subject being in focus and the background out of focus.|`|AA11539218	if your camera doesn't have the manual focus option....you won't be able to use manual focus...and the Coolpix is a "point and shoot" so it will not have that option anyway.  <br>  <br>  Also this effect is produced more so because of the aperture setting to adjust the depth of field so that the subject is in focus and the background is blurred. You can not change the aperture setting on point and shoot cameras...it is one of the many benefits of the professional slr models.|`|AA10722993	Some of the Canon Powershots have adjustable controls.  The A590IS is a reasonably priced camera and you can change the aperture and shutter speeds.    Less than $150.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	you need to be able to control the apature to do something like that, not sure if the collpix does it.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	check out the canon a2000<br>  it has manual controls|`|1jFG5h1iaa	There should be a setting where you can manually focus it. I know with my Casio I can but it doesn't work very well. To get a picture like that I think you'll need a digital SLR.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	There are many point and shoots out there where you can manually adjust shutter speed and aperture. I don't know how this would lead to focussing on a subject. According to dpreview.com you can not focus the L18.
b8tgCAQJaa	Not on an unmodified console, unfortunately - you need a mod chip or similar device, as the PS2 has a protection system to prevent you playing games from different regions.<br>  <br>  If a cheap UK (PAL) version of the same game is available, it's probably easier just to buy that, rather than fiddle around with your console trying to get the NTSC U/C version to work...<br>  <br>  Fortunately with the Playstation 3, Sony have largely abolished region protection, allowing any PS3 console to play more or less any PS3 game from anywhere in the world.|`|SDhKNBBkaa	The Americas (north & south) have different TV systems and mobile phone frequencies from Europe and most of the rest of the world!!!<br>  <br>  Send it back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

GksSFTcVaa	This happened to me before too except I paused it and the screen froze and the light continued to stay on. What I did was I left it on all night until the battery died out. I charged it on my iPod charger the next day and everything was back to normal. Since yours does not turn on at all, I think the battery may have expired already if you have had yours for awhile now. I have had mine for 2 years and it is still working for me.

BWXZf6j4aa	Get another box to watch and use the original to record.<br>  Get a twin tuner recorder box.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	No the box has one tuner it can only access one channel at a time, so you have two options by another reciever or buy a recorder with a built in digital reciever.|`|A4P3ot4xaa	Your gonna have to buy a Digital box that will have duel tuners thus allowing recording one while watching another.

HekFanRvaa	you can't find that part anywhere else but only in Sony service centers. Even if you find one it's gonna cost you around a $100 and you have to pay a professional to install it for you. Just send it to Sony (even without warranty) and it will get back to you like brand new. trust me.

It won't work with the ones that are already premade, i tried it and it didn't work, but if you upload and make your own ringtone from an mp3 file, <br>  Ventones will work with Rogers|`|e1jG5fhLaa	LOL idk im in the same position as u right now trying to figure out what to do XD
nC7Cxf2eaa	it depends how your internet settings and protocols are set up.<br>  some games like cod 4 and 5 use different settings and protocols so some games will work better than others, im the same with cod and midnight club. there are tons of guides on google on how to configure your router for different games(opening ports and dmz settings)|`|FIL4vngsaa	It's most likely that the servers are bit full or one of your connections are weak.<br>  It happens to me when I'm trying to play with my friend. It takes a few tries until he can play with me.<br>  Just keep trying.
b2OyCIqcaa	Yes the phone can. <br>  I am current using a 16gb San Disk micro sdhc card.<br>  The card wasn't out yet when the phone came out, so they listed it capable up to 8gb. But the Dare is fully compatible with micro sdhc and its listed in the specs.
z88IMXNFaa	No, you can't.  You have to purchase a phone (any phone) outright.  Also, you can't get the reduced price without signing a 2 year contract which you cannot do.|`|WfC3sDTHaa	Your only 14? Then i wouldnt worry about it, cause you cant get it anyways, you have to be 18. and i have never heard of down payments on a phone
AA12180617	YES it is much more than an iPod, its a PDA, its a GPS, its a Games Console, its a Netbook, its a toolkit and many other things.<br>  <br>  its reliable easy to use, slim (fits in pocket with no bulge) and long lasting with great screen.<br>  <br>  bad points they are not the cheapest players around (but if you take into account the extra bits it works out cheaper than buying all the bits together). and it is limited at the minute to 32GB.<br>  <br>  buy the biggest you can afford as once bought you cannot add xtra memory  and they are so useful you will nearly fill whatever version you buy.. there are so many useful APPS and games out there you will want them all and also you will fill it with movies too..|`|AA11209831	I have the 32 gig 2ng gen and I love it.<br>  <br>  It is well worth the money.|`|ooiLqSpQaa	you should !<br>  i love how its touch screen :)<br>  its so fun playing around with it|`|chuHbpJZaa	Yes, If you can afford it then YES. Good Luck.|`|ohq6qrFaaa	No<br>  <br>  If you shop around you'll get a MUCH better player, more suited to your needs and probably for cheaper to. <br>  <br>  With iPods you get :<br>  <br>  Bad battery life<br>  Bad Sound Quality<br>  A not very powerful amplifier<br>  You NEED to use iTunes, lots of people hate it<br>  Poor Value<br>  Features you don't need<br>  <br>  <br>  Shop around, look on websites. And ASK. There are many people who have lots of knowledge in this kind of area. They can tell the differnce between an MP3 of 192 kbps and 320 kbps they are that awesome.<br>  <br>  So in short, no, I don't think you should get an iPod touch. Check the website below for a lot of information on other players.|`|V7mp8RCdaa	if you can live without it then there's no point. A new generation will come out which you can get. Also if you are not going to use the whole 16gb why buy it, why dont you just buy a 2GB ipod shuffle which will be more value for money.<br>  <br>  <br>  at the end of the day its your money and decision do what you feel right with.|`|wiLJlRDbaa	Meh, honestly you don't need all of the features.. they're still very pricey, so it all comes down to you. I have an 80GB ipod video and it does everything I need it to do.. I don't ever have to worry about storage space.. so if you want to listen to music, get a regular ipod.. if you want to look trendy, it's a good bet too.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Yes, fully worth the money.  And the battery lasts me like 2 weeks without chargig it.  And it has a big screen so you can see everything really clear and go on the internet.  Get it!|`|pN0Xiz7naa	Yes!!!!!<br>  It is the best ipod ever!<br>  <br>  You can have sooooooo much stuff with it and they are the most durable device.<br>  I have dropped mine on concreate and it still works like new!!!<br>  <br>  HoPe I hElPeD!|`|65RZ441Zaa	YEAH, I"m about to order mine from apple :) If you get it online, you'll get free shipping, and free laser inscribing!|`|y332rI1Vaa	i have one and there amazing. its better than anything out there!!|`|NK6AtTWBaa	YES!!! i got one and it is the best money i have ever spent in my life.  ilove it!!!|`|5KfxsOcNaa	If you are okay with paying extra just for the touch screen, plus if you want any good apps you will have to pay a lot.|`|vtCdNx3caa	Absolutely, it's awesome. (:|`|U91xlYS8aa	Get an 8GB<br>  16GB is a waste. But yea you should, I have one and it's amazing!|`|9wGsFBZPaa	YES!!! I love mine, it is my new best fiend (jokes) <br>  But, it IS very amazing  : )|`|kRMGq2MOaa	yes it is soooooo cool|`|jdVxsK4yaa	yea...my friend has it, its better dan mine|`|D9QLM6sRaa	Yeah do it, it's cool simply the best ipod ever and it has everything. You won't regret it :). Trust me :).
qGfAlDd2aa	The law to move the transition date did allow people with expire coupons to reapply.  So, go apply for a new set of coupons.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dtv2009.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtv2009.gov</a>|`|gUzmQ8eQaa	No, Unfortunately stores will not honor expired coupons, However you can order a total of 2 coupons from the gov't so if you only ordered 1 coupon you can order a second. If you ordered 2 and they both expire you can either order it to a friend or job's address or reorder it from your address however if you order them from your address you must provide a reason you are ordering more coupons and if you have a solid reason (you just moved in your house and the previous homeowner ordered them not you) <br>  <br>  <br>  ps; Your coupon expiring is not a solid enough reason.
52zR9SHDaa	Because the current is inversely proportional to the impedance. So, if you half the impedance the current should double.<br>  Don't mess about with it because there are other factors involved and you might burn your amplifier out.
4Uq1tVmtaa	I have a Blackberry Curve from Alltel and I've been trying to get the gps on that to work. I downloaded Google Latitude, another 3rd party gps application, and also tried the Blackberry Maps program to no avail. I called Alltel and they told me that I had to subscribe to their service to unlock the gps capability.<br>  <br>  Basically my impression is that unless you pay their fee, you're screwed. I had the most luck with Google Latitude, if your phone supports it, I recommend trying it. Latitude gets your location based on the cell tower you're operating from as well as gps, so even if your gps is locked it will still tell you where you are within a few miles--better than nothing I suppose. In addition, Latitude lets you share your location--in other words, it integrates with the online version of google earth so your friends can see where you are from their computer and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you find a solution that doesn't involve paying.
xMa9M0dVaa	1. go to google images and type in the name of the album. <br>  2. open the picture to its full size.<br>  3. right click on the song and click get info<br>  4. when the information comes up click on the tab that says artwork. <br>  5. Drag the picture to the artwork square<br>  <br>  You might have to save the picture to your computer then drag it to the artwork square. <br>  <br>  note: This will only work if you have all of your limewire music in the iTunes library. That is the only way that I know how to do it|`|5c53212d56c3ba5557f12f6094faea4caa	You can right click on the song and click on "Get Album Artwork"<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, copy and paste the album artwork from the internet to the square in the bottom left of iTunes.<br>  <br>  To change any information about the song, highlight it and press Ctrl + i|`|bzin6asEaa	right click on the song, "get album artwork".
AA10179458	Sadly no. The new generations of Ipod's use a different pin configuration. While you can still play music, you can not charge your Ipod.
tlBBwNwTaa	Go to your options page. Depending on your phone you will need to go to either security or password. On my curve it is password and you simply change the setting to on and be sure to set a password and save your changes.|`|DkYGl11naa	<a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/deliverables/1202/userguide_bb8330_cdma.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://na.blackberry.com/eng/deliverable...</a><br>  <br>  Everything you need to know is within the user guide...in particular how you can set in under the options menu.

You can't add more than 4 at a time, so try it by adding 4 each time. Should work.
3CJAUyqPaa	1) Normally, the hard disc drive (and flash memory) camcorders mount to the desktop, you copy the video files to the Mac, CONVERT the video files using StreamClip (or Handbrake, see details below)<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/mpegstreamclip.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/vi...</a><br>  to a format iMovie and FinalCut likes (like .mov, .mp4, .dv or .hdv among others). Once the files are converted, quit StreamClip, Launch the video editor and drag the converted files to the Log/Capture area or directly to the timeline.<br>  <br>  2) Most video editors do not deal well with the VOB files on DVD burned for playback in normal DVD players.<br>  <br>  Download and install HandBrake<br>  <a href="http://handbrake.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://handbrake.fr/</a><br>  and use it to rip the video from the DVD to a format your video editor can deal with. Once the files are converted, quit HandBrake, Launch the video editor and drag the converted files to the Log/Capture area or directly to the timeline.
q33O1AaOaa	go to the store and get them to give them a diffrent card also take a report so that they can sea that it relly happend if they dont beleive you than your screwed
82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Your friend or your parents probably disabled the WiFi option on your iTouch. You want to select Settings – General  - Restrictions to check it out. If it is enabled and passworded, you need to ask for the password in order to use WiFi.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!
RpCwfcRzaa	The salesman is wrong, but the 360 can be made wireless by buying the wireless adapter which is $100. It's expensive so if you don't want to pay that much (and I don't blame you), stick with the wired way.|`|AA11682618	no the xbox 360 isn't wireless if that was the case i would be able to connect my 360 to a wi fi and i can't do that|`|3dT7f39maa	Yes it is as long as you buy the Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adaptor
