From a photon's perspective, its emission and absorption are simultaneous events, involving neither time nor distance in its own frame of reference.      But can a photon, after being emitted, NEVER be absorbed? All eternity passes, and that photon's still going. Does the photon ever experience time? Does zero times infinity give a finite product?      Or is it, perhaps, that all photons MUST be absorbed, eventually, on account of some physical law or other?

Refer to the phase diagram for substance X in Problem Set 60: Phase Diagrams, in the Chemistry: Problems and Solutions book.      In the phase diagram for substance X, what is the triple point of substance X?              0°C, 0 atm              22°C, 4 atm              60°C, 5 atm              29°C, 2.2 atm      4. Which of the following occurs when the temperature and pressure are below the triple point of a substance?              The substance melts to a liquid.              Only the solid form of the substance can exist.              Only the gaseous form of the substance can exist.              The substance cannot exist in the liquid form.            5. Refer to the phase diagram for carbon dioxide in Problem Set 60: Phase Diagrams, in the Chemistry: Problems and Solutions book.      For a given sample of carbon dioxide (CO2) you increase the temperature from 80°C to 0°C and decrease the pressure from 30 atm to 5 atm. On a phase diagram this causes a crossing of both the solid-liquid boundary and the liquid-gas boundary. Which of the following best describes what happens?              The solid sublimes to gas.              The gas condenses to liquid and then freezes solid.              The gas deposits directly into a solid.              The solid melts to liquid and then vaporizes to gas.

Now when one drinks alcohol you kill brain cells.  Logically you kill the slowest and dumbest brain cells essentially making you smarter right?

I am currently studying chemical and petroleum engineering.  I would like to know what I would need to transfer.  Give me all the details.  I might not stay in engineering, I might switch over to chemistry or physics so that is an option.  Let me know what I need to have as in GPA, Classes, etc.  Also, does Berkeley offer finanical aid for transfer students?  Also, what does it actually cost yearly or by semester for an out of state student at Berkeley.  I have seen a wide assortment of numbers.  What is the cost of on campus housing, meal plan, the works.  I would also imagine that it is harder to get into Berkley as a transfer student, than a HS student. Am I correct in saying this?  Any Berkeley students willing to give some advice, lol?  I am currently researching schools that I want to transfer to, and I have heard so many great things about Berkeley and want to know more.  Also, would it really be worth it, i.e. money, time, etc, or should I just not even bother.  I would like honest opinions.
