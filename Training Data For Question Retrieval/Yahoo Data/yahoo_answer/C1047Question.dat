20090309131824AAQePjU	Sports;Other - Sports	How much is my card collection worth?	I know that when selling cards, you get about 20% of the actual book value, but I have about 7000 baseball, hockey, basketball and football cards from the early 90's and probably 90% of them are just commons and all of my doubles / triples etc.  (There's nothing special about any of the cards)  They're all in mint condition having been in boxes since day one, (some even in original packages).  I know that alone they are worthless, but 7000 of them has to be worth something to a collector right?  What would be a good selling price?  $200?  $300?  $500?  more?

20090309132537AAqKkAg	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Which player do you personally rate who everyone else thinks is rubbish?	You know who i love watching at Arsenal no matter what anybody says, Nick Bendtner, i know ive said some things in anger about him but i think hes going to be quite decent one day, hes young and he scores goals...he may miss the odd sitter but you can tell he actually wants to make up for what hes done wrong unlike others...he gives us a strong aerial presence which is slightly different to Adebayor...also Bendtner sometimes likes to slip out wide(alot like Henry lol)...i reckon if he works on his finishing and build up play he could be a really good striker...      Also Eboues a decent lad, he loves to attack and when he gets on the ball hes always looking for something to happen in tight games...he may pick a bad pass(which gets a few people on his back) but what he brings to the Arsenal team is something we dont have alot of(Walcott being the other) Eboue gets defenders to turn towards their own line and he enjoys getting to the by line. He is abit lost in the midfield because hes forced to cut back inside and let the RB have the space to exploit, which Eboue was very good at...      At Liverpool Lucas isnt all that bad by the way if you watched him and looked at the things he is good at you will soon realise...i think if you fans continue to get on his back he was just go downhill get on the lads side if hes playing for you!

20090227152339AAd6HA7	Sports;Cricket	Ian Butler in NZ side?	I have been impressed with the new Ian Butler, and some of the papers are picking him in the NZ 12.  Slightly slower (still 1380-40ish) than the before injury but a great 3/4th seamer.  He would be in the side at the expense of Broom.  (Styris is not in good enough form).  He would effectively bat at 7 in that case with Elliot/Oram and 5/6.  Or does NZ already have enough bowling depth with Ryder and Elliot as 6/7th bowlers.           Any thoughts on his recent performances in 20/20.  Don't see him much domestically (aucklander).

It's almost my 12th b-day and my parents said that they would take me somewhere to get a paint ball gun. They said nothing over 300 dollars in total.

I would like to know which kind of gun to get, and all the accessories and everything. I may be able to go a little over 300, oh and I live in Grand Rapids MI so if you could give me a close place to go to that would be nice.

20090309172704AAAOYFy	Sports;Baseball	How should I handle an unfortunate tryout?	For our school baseball team, our coaches evaluate over a week and a half period before making the cuts. I know I am a great player. On the first day of the evaluation, I performed fantastically. On the second day, my arm felt fine, but about half way through practice I started getting sharp pains when I threw. The pain is unbearable. The whole rest of the evaluation I have been throwing like a pansy. It is embarrassing, and I am EXTREMELY frustrated, because my performance has been nowhere near my ability. Today, I visited our school's trainer, and he found that the problem lies in my rotator cuff. It isn't serious, and I shouldn't be out for long, but first cuts are tomorrow, and I don't want to be cut because of this misunderstanding. How can I let the coaches know that I am a better player than I probably appear to them? I want them to know that my performance shouldn't be taken seriously. I am a good player and I deserve to be graded fairly.

20090309170308AASc7F0	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	Hypothetically, "IF" Hendrick was to try a different crew chief for Dale Earnhardt Jr other than Tony Eury Jr?	then who would be the most likely candidate that could serve as a crew chief for Dale Jr.?      It was noted in an article last season (2008) how Darian Grubb kind of helped Tony Eury Jr out while coming to HMS and who's input  kept Tony Eury Jr's and Dale Earnhardt Jr's conversations about setups and strategies from  ... quote ... "going in circles".   http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup...       Well now that Darian Grubb has become Tony Stewart's crew chief who would be a prime candidate that could fill that role should Eury need replacing? Remember this is a hypothetical question.      A lot of Dale Jr's success last year was attributed to input from  Darian Grubb. Do you think Darian Grubb being Tony Stewart's crew member this year may be part of the reason Tony Stewart is running as good as he is and Ryan Newman is not having as easy of a time getting settled into his new ride this year?
