20090223155153AAbGvO6	Pets;Other - Pets	My rabbit has gotten really skinny.?	My rabbit is 5 ? years old. She had nine babies about 4 ? years ago, way back in 2004. After she had her babies she was pretty large but she wasn’t fat she was kind of just normal. Now she had recently gotten really skinny and bony. She lives with two of her daughters in one cage and her daughters are fat, but she seems malnourished. I always have fresh food, water and veggies/fruits available. She is acting just like her usual self. Could it just be a phase.? She loves milk so today I gave her some milk in  a bowl and she loves it. I also put vitamins in there food everyday. Are there any kinds of foods that I can give her to fatten her up a bit.?
20090223155210AAonUst	Pets;Dogs	What kind of dog would be the best fit for us?	I live in an apartment which has strict restrictions on dogs.  Dogs must be a year old when they move in and the dog must not be over 25 lbs when fully matured.        I do not want to get a chihuahua or dachshund or other very small dog.        Unfortunately, I just don't know of any dog breeds other than these that fit these strict guidelines! Any one have any suggestions out there?!

I've only had him a few weeks and I guess I haven't sat at my desk for so many consecutive hours until today so I've never noticed how often he normally 'breathes' this way.

20090223155953AA10iP2	Pets;Horses	Any Jumping Techniques?	I am just starting jumping, and I ride a 13.3 quarter horse x Welsh Cob who is a little pony, but loves to jump. I noticed that I get into a position with my back hunched or I guess arched. Is there anyway that I can stop my arching so high?      Plus it would be great for some good jumping tips, since we jump only a foot(30.48 cm) and sometimes a foot and a half I would like for it to be on my level. Further info on my riding, I have awesome seat, my heels are always down(sometimes not in jumping but my instructor catches me on that), I can stay on a bucking pony, I ride at a dressage barn, and my(the farm's) pony loves to jump. Any tips, answers, would be great! And I will answer any questions if you aren't for sure what I am asking.      Sorry for my previous question, she only bucks once, when she notices that we are jumping. Its a habit they are fixing, but other than that she is a sweet little pony. I know we are jumping low, but learning positions are good for me since I have improved greatly in only a few days of getting my seat balanced and like I'm sitting in glue. My instructor said I would soon be jumping higher in a couple of months since me and my friend have been improving in jumping. But due to weather we aren't for sure.

But my hubby's one 'Sakura' was really scared and jumped onto the floor it's a good job I'm quick because I managed to pick her up fast but she jumped another 2 times before I got her back in the cage. I'm worried she will be very timid I'm going to get some treats and try bribing her but I'm really worried she seemed quiet when I put her back in the cage but has since calmed down. They were from the same litter.

Whenever I try to pet or stroke him he shy's away from me like I'm going to hurt him and last night he came in and was all wet so I tried to towel dry him off and he went crazy.       Tonight, I walked up to him to pet him but he wasn't fast enough to move away and started panicking when I put my hand on his shoulder. So I put my right arm around his neck and placed my left hand right above his nose to control him, but he still seemed a little edgy.       I need some help! Anyone have any ideas?

I stay right with them when they are outside or keep them tied up when I can't be outside with them.  So why should I have to put up my neighbors dog that comes into my yard and messes with my dogs (the neighbors dog is big and my two dogs are both small)?  I call animal control and the dog never gets picked up even though I'm not the only one who complains.  And the one and only time one of my dogs gets loose he gets picked up right away and I have to pay a fine to get him out.  I'm starting to feel like I have to sneak my dogs outside so they can do their business without getting tackled but she's allowed to leave her dog run free to tackle other small dogs in the neighbor hood that are leashed.  The city wont do anything about it.

20090223160924AAlCLnG	Pets;Horses	Teaching my horse to jump?!?	I have been going through level one parelli program and one of the tasks you have to be able to do is send your horse over a small jump while you are on the ground. I have a half arab horse that has never jumped before in his life and I am not sure how to go about teaching him. At first I started with a low pole jump, but when I sent him over it, he would just try to pick up his legs high enought to trot/step over it instead of jumping it and he justing ended banging his legs on the pole. He didn't hurt himslef, but after that I couldn't get him to go over it anymore even if I lowered it. So next, I tried using barels laying on their sides. This is what they reccomend in the parelli program,  but once again when I ask my horse to go over them, he just stops in front of them, looks at me like I'm crazy and then tries to trot off in the other direction on the lead line and then stops in front of the barels again from the other side. Any Help????? I really need to teach him how to jump and quickly!

I have had a lot of wonderful people help me with many issues on here, but there are a few smart butts, who like to be rude.  I need some advice.  Okay, I have a cat that has been peeing on my carpet for years, not days, not weeks, not months, BUT YEARS.  It is the same vicinity.  I am good at keeping up on it, and believe it or not it doesn't smell unless you lay on top of it or get down on your knees in the area, this is still bad, but you don't walk into my house and get smacked in the face - just don't want you to think I'm a pig in a stinky house, LOL.  But seriously I have tried it all, I AM CONVINCED it will not stop.  I have been told it would be more humane to put him to sleep rather than take the chance and put him in a humane society and have someone adopt him and perhaps he does it again, and they aren't so nice.  I don't know if it is possible if he were in a one animal home with not so much going on - we have a baby, teenagers, etc. that maybe he would not do this.  He is by nature scared of his shadow and a nervous wreck - which is what I was told maybe why he does this.  Any advice??  I have been more than fair and loving to this animal, but it is at the point that he is ruining my home.  So unless I want to remove my $2,000 carpeting and never have a rug in my home, I cannot continue.  I am the softest hearted person when it comes to cats and any animal for that matter, but I am really in a bind.  Please give me some advice.  Also if you have ideas to help with the smell that would be great also!

20090223163701AAv9czg	Pets;Rodents	What is wrong with my hamster? I think he is dying!?	A few months ago, I noticed he had a bump on his jaw. I figured he bumped it on something. A few weeks later, I noticed it got bigger. I asked my dad to call the vet. The vet said that as long as he his eating and drinking fine, then he will be ok. The bump got bigger and bigger, and then I guess my hamster popped it because it got smaller, so that there was barely a bump. A few weeks later, he has two bumps on his jaw (one on left, one on right) and he has a small bump on his stomach. A couple days later, I cleaned his cage and I filled his water bottle. The other night, I noticed it was full. Now, sometimes when I take him out, both of his eyes are sealed closed by puss (I think) and his penis is shriveled up. Just now, when I took him out, there is a bald spot under his ear. What is happening to him?   Yes, I already asked my parents to take him to the vet. They said, and I quote, "that there is no point in spending over $200 for a $2 hamster." My hamster is pretty old, I have had him for two Christmas.    Please, can someone tell me what is wrong?

20090223163026AANZHyM	Pets;Dogs	How to train a dog to be calm in new situations?	I have a 6 month old pitt/catahoula bulldog. He is already 70 lbs and pretty well trained. He knows how to walk on a leash and to sit and stay as well as some other commands but this is only if we are in a familiar enviroment like our home or our neighborhood. When we go to the vet or dogpark or someone visits he is out of control pulling on the leash or jumping on people. How do you train a dog to listen to you in ALL situations?

20090223162929AACN3hN	Pets;Rodents	What's the way to quickly euthanize a baby mouse HUMANELY?	(PLEASE DON'T SUGGEST BUYING ALREADY DEAD) Hey guys! Sooooo, I need a little help! So, the other day, I saw my cat trying to stick his paw under the fridge. I thought he was crazy or trying to get one of his toys or something, but he was doing this for hours and dramatically meowing like when he sees birds out the window or something. GETTING to the point, I ventured under the fridge to find that there was a sort of mouse nest! I feel really sorry for the mother though. I noticed she had some sort of bite marks on her, my theory is that my cat saw her running around or something, and chased her back under the fridge, but somehow i guess my cat pawed it out before it lurked too far back, and took a snap at it. Overnight she bled out i guess because i found her in a tiny pool of blood (like maybe like 2 - 3 inches long, it was like 2 cm away from the mouse all around, not that big) ANYWAYS, the baby's were still alive. I have a White's Tree Frog, and i feed him freeze dried crickets. Occasionally (Don't tell me that this isn't good for him, i know how to take care of my own damn frog) i feed him live crickets i find outside when getting my mail and stuff. JESUS I talk a lot! Now, let's get to the point. I need a way to euthanize (fastly pre-kill) the baby mice. There's 8 of them, so i want 1 - 3 methods. I already have one which is spinal de-location but i really don't know how to attempt that. If you know how please leave a detailed step by step thing on how to snap it's neck. Thanks, and I'm not going to a store. So give me a way i can do it from the house, not like "Go out and buy a Co2 canister" or "Get some dry ice" Also, please people, HUMANE ways, and make them, scientific... I mean that like, biological methods, like spinal dislocation, or somehow putting pressure on their heart and they die instantly, I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE THE ANSWER PEOPLE DUDES!!! JUST, thanks! Before i continue my ranting about the story! -coffee         PLEASE READ THIS (ABOVE) BEFORE ANSWERING!!!

She was inactive for that entire month up until last week (almost took her to vet) now she is out and about in her cage but still isn't eating the rat.       What should i do? Take the rat out and give her a smaller meal?   Or leave it in there and hope for the best.      The rat isn't that large 3 inches without tail or so, its a medium/large. I have been feeding the rat grape nuts so it won't die, but a month is a long time almost feels like I have two pets in that cage.      Thanks for any help

Whenever he needs to go to the bathroom he goes and stands by his leash or the front door. He never pees in the house when we are awake. He always lets us know he needs to go. At night, he sleeps with us. He never used to get up at all. Now, he is starting to get up in the middle of the night and pee on the carpet in the living room. I am worried that something might be wrong with him. He has been fine for 4 1/2 years. Any suggestions?
20070203152942AAD4UmT	Pets;Other - Pets	Online Dog Rescue Shelters... has anyone ever actually had success with these?	I have been trying for about 2 months now to adopt a dog through an online Rescue.  I have filled out a few applications, sent emails, etc. - but NEVER hear a response.  I have a nice home, I have previous experience (good) with being a pet owner.  I have verifiable references, a job that would allow me to pay for unexpected vet bills, etc.  Should I give up on these volunteer run groups who seem entirely ineffective and just purchase a dog from a breeder or visit my local shelter instead?  After all of my research and attempts to communicate with and adopt a dog through one of these seemingly "real" rescue shelters online, I'm ready to advise folks against using these services.  Any ideas/advice/comments?  Real answers only, please.

I thought I knew so much about hermit crabs, but this is stumping me!!       My hermit crab (Helmet) is at least a year old, so I have taken great lengths to care for him. I have noticed lately that he appears to have whiteish, blueish spots on his claws, that look like mold, or some kind of fungus/bacteria. I'm terrified, mostly because I don't want him to die from something like this!      Is this fungus deadly? Harmless? Can it become harmful? If so, WHAT CAN BE DONE TO GET RID OF IT? It looks like he has had it for about a week and a half now. I can/will provide additional details, if asked, but I don't know if it's his shell, the items in his cage (I can list that, too), what I feed him (I give him popcorn and he loves it, never caused a problem before...could the salt cause it?), etc. I just cleaned his cage, but I usually do it once a week, and dry it out thoroughly, so I don't think that has to do with it.       THANK YOU for taking the time to read this and provide some help!

20081109105456AAz3zsb	Pets;Dogs	Could this dog be pregnant?	My husband & I took in a dog (Aussie) whose owners could not be found.  We have had her for 4 days.  She is quite over weight.  She has been adjusting well with our dogs and has been doing great.  But today she suddenly wants to be left alone.  Staying in laundry room and not wanting to come out.  I eventually forced her to go out, thinking she surely needed to go out by then.  She went directly to the dog house and won't come out again.  Now I am thinking maybe she is not just overweight, but pregnant.  I see no signs of milk, but does that always come before puppies?

I have a 14 year old Chihuahua/Beagle, and sometimes when she lies down I can hear her joints in her legs, make a popping sound. It sounds like when someone cracks their knuckles.

20081010133245AArYEB4	Pets;Other - Pets	Mama rabbit and kits nee help?	Okay, my rabbits had 2 kits yestudaray. Its her first litter, and she didnt really know what to do. I found the babbies RIGHT after she had kindled, and there was no nest, only like 2 chuncks of fur, and the babbies were in diffrent corners. AND she was a week over due.       I made her a nest, the best I could, and gave her a hair cut, and put the fur in the nest. But the babbies (who are very, very, very small) keep getting in the back of the nest somehow. I have fixed it a few times, but they keep doing it. I dont think mom has fed them. She has milk, but the babbies are getting wrinkly. Oh! And I went out there to check on them, and I cant find one of them. One was under the bedding, and the other is missing. There is no way to get out of the cage, but i am afraid mom stepped on it, and klilled it.       I dont know what to do. Should I keep the babbies away from her, and feed them moms milk? (by holging them, and letting the babbies suck) or should I just leave be? I am afraid the babbies will die. Help? Thanks so much.

20081026193602AAM2yqJ	Pets;Dogs	My dog freaks out sometimes when I try to grab his collar and take him somewhere?	I'm fairly confident that I have a good pack leadership role with my dog. He obeys me, and I control every aspect of his life(food, affection, etc.). However, when a situation comes where I have to grab his collar for some reason or another, about 25% of the time he FREAKS OUT. He starts making this horrible snarl/scream sound, first tries bucking backwards so I will let go then buckles and goes to the ground, whilst still trying to get ahold of my hand to "mouth" it and snarling and kicking me and carrying on. Let me point out that he doesn't bite, but mouths.. Leaves scratches, but never punctures skin. And I don't pull away. When he does this I do not let go, but I keep him on the ground until he calms down and I remain calm, and don't take it personally. But its getting worse. This last time he did it(15 minutes ago) he DID puncture the skin, not horribly but its there. What should I do?

20080313181331AAnFTIB	Pets;Dogs	My dog is dying, what do we do?	Bell is 12 years old and has epilepsy (sp? cancer?) and she is on PhenoBarbital and she has been having seizures lately everyday around the same time. Like 2 a day. One in the morning and one at night. We don't want to put her down right away, but we want to know is there a way we can save her? We think that since she had a tumor in her neck, it spread fast to her brain, but we are not toatlly sure. We are taking her to the vet this weekend. We want to get her to stop having the seizures and being healthy. After the seizures, it takes about 2 or 3 mintues to come back out of it, and then she gets back up and walks just fine. We want her to live as long as possible without pain. Is their anything we can do to help or save her? It hurts seeing her with these seizures.      BTW, she is a beagle.

But it didn't, and every 20 or so minutes for the past 3-4 hours I've taken it outside to see if it would poop, and it hasn't.  It's peed twice since then and I'm starting to get worried it ate something it wasn't supposed to eat.      I feed it Purina Puppy Chow.      Any help is greatly appreciated!

On closer inspection, I found an odd looking scab (?) - the best I can describe it, it looks like a small volcano shape on her actual skin with an elongated scab protruding from it - about a cm long. It hasn't got any worse since seeing it, it's not inflamed or anything but it does seem to be irritating her sometimes. Today I found another one on her back that looks exactly the same. I've scoured the net but I can't find anything. I will of course take her to the vets if nobody has any ideas, but it's my last resort as she's really does NOT like the vets at all, or other dogs so it's all a bit stressful when we have to take a vet trip! Any help much appreciated!
20081106133709AAB6jTg	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my dog to calm down? ?	I have a 3 year old dog who is just way to hyper! He really isn't trained (my fault, i know). Is there something that we can give him so we can file down his nails or AT LEAST give him a decent bath!?  He's about a medium size dog and really sweet just a little hard to control.

We have a 5-month-old female little yorkie-poodle-shitzu and a 8 month male yorkie-poo. We are not sure if our female is eating enough because she has a hard time chewing food. I am guessing that she is only able to eat ten morsels of food a day. What are some ideas of foods I can give her that are safe for dogs?

20090223113302AAlvgpH	Pets;Dogs	Any experience treating K9 liver disease naturopathically?	Recently discovered my dog' liver values were out of whack, after many months of dealing w/incompetent vet, complaining of shortness of breath, lo/ no energy, swollen belly. Today's ultra sound revealed her liver to have a 'mottled' appearance, to my layman's eye.      Had her on Baytril 9 days... did nothing for her but make her worse, ataxia, very sleepy, nearly unresponsive, first bout of diarrhea since this condition came to my attention.      So, here's the question: I have an appointment with a naturopath tomorrow who practices acupuncture, chinese herbs, other modalities. She extended the live of my last dog 3+ yrs when conventional medicine had given up on her (it was cancer).      Can I expect similar results with liver disease? Do you have any experiences you'd like to share?      Dog is a 9 or 10yr old Rescue, owned f. past 7 yrs. Chow. Only other medical issue is hypothyroidism.. lives on half .7mg Soloxine tablet once a day. And of course, eats the organic meals I cook for her.      Thanks.

20090223111149AATrsmC	Pets;Horses	What kind of vehicle do you tow with?	I'm just starting to look around for a truck and trailer combo. We don't have our own and when I start showing again, it's going to be a hassle hitching rides or borrowing trailers. I'm just curious as to what kind of vehicle you could tow a 2 horse trailer with that's still small enough that it could be my everyday vehicle. I really don't want a huge truck or something. I've got no plans on having a bigger trailer anytime soon. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

20090223134407AAYhS83	Pets;Reptiles	Is it okay to put my baby turtles in the tank?	it's winter now and they don't move much in the little tank, so i decided to put it in my empty fish tank. they seem to be more lively and swim around more. i think it's the heater that helps, warming the water up to make them more active. i was wondering if it's okay to put them in there, because they're so use to shallow water in the little tank and all of a sudden i put them into the fish tank. anyone know about this? they're red eared slider turtles. they're a little bit bigger than a size of a quarter..
20090223141116AAQG9Am	Pets;Other - Pets	HELP!!! What do I do with baby squirrels?!?	This morning, I heard this really high-pitched squeaking noise so I went into my backyard to see what it was and saw two baby squirrels!! I thought they might have fallen out of a tree, because they were right under this huge oak tree so I left them, thinking their mom would come get them. I got back from school, and they were still there!!!!! They were just curled up in the freezing cold grass. So I put them in a cardboard box and put a towel in there so they could keep warm, but now what?! The animal rescue place closes at 5:00, so we have to wait until tomorrow to bring them in. What do I do until then? What do I feed them? How do I house them? How do I keep them warm?      They look like they are brand-new babies, they are TINY, and they have really shiny, velvety soft fur. It looks like they just opened their eyes. Every once in a while one of them will do this really high-pitched "EEEEP!! EEEEP!!!" sound.       HELP!!! I FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM!!! THEY ARE, LIKE, ON THE VERGE OF DYEING!!!
