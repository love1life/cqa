20090226130947AAMZVAd	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why won't anything run?	Background:      - My computer is about 3 years old with Windows XP.      - I had a problem with Spyware Guard 2008 malware. Nothing I tried would get rid of it (I tried Spybot Search and Destroy, Trojan Remover, Malwarebytes and several others) so I left it alone until I could find something that would work.      - About a week ago, Spyware Guard 2008 started giving me warnings about Internet Explorer (which I had never gotten before). I don't even use IE, I use Firefox. They popped up constantly and got to the point where I couldn't do anything because I had to keep clicking "cancel" and "ok" buttons. I managed to download a newer version of Malwarebytes and rebooted. But about a minute after I logged in, it rebooted again and kept doing that every time I logged in.       - From there, I rebooted in safe mode. That worked, so I ran Malwarebytes. It removed some things, but SG 2008 was still partially there. On another computer, I looked up a manual way to get rid of it. This included ending a few processes. I'm familiar with ending processes, so I'm fairly sure I didn't end anything I shouldn't have, but it's possible. Finally, by the end of the day, it looked like SG 2008 was gone. But now when I log in, very few icons appear in the task menu (no volume icon, no internet connection icons) and nothing happens when I try to open most programs (including drives and control panel).       I'm completely at a loss as to what to do. If I can't figure it out, I'll call someone to come look at my computer and figure out what's wrong, but I figured I should look for help on the internet first. Does it sound like I ended a process that I shouldn't have by accident, and if I did, any idea what it could be? Could malware be doing this (one of the processes running right now is reader_s.exe which, according to a google search, is malware)? Any suggestions as to what I can do or where a better place to ask would be?

Just now my PC does not respond at all when i push the power button, last night it was working just fine? Nothing between the then and now has happened so i have no idea whats going on. I did however months ago installed a new video card on my pc, an nvidia 8800gt. that was during christmjas and has since worked just fine on my pc. Only thought i might be having is if the card might have been too power hungry for my psu to handle, but on the video card box it says 400 wats and my psu is 500wats so i dont think that could be a problem. so any ideas what might be wrong and what can i do about it?

How long does it take to get the CCIE certification -- 6 months, a year, 5 years? I know I have to pass more than one test on the way to the CCIE certification.

I have an HP computer operating with Windows Vista Home edition. I got my computer in August of 2008 so the machine isn't even a year old yet and I'm already having issues. About a month ago I was using it when it just shut off. There was no warning that it would restart or was preparing to shut down. The screen just when black as if the plug came out. I checked the plugs and everything was perfectly intact. When I tried to turn the computer on again the buttons lit up like normal then there was these two little beep beep sounds and it turned off again. I felt the machine and it was very hot at the top part of the base where the start button is located. I waited a few minutes and then turned it back on and everything was fine. The machine worked great and I just took what happened to be a fluke. Now however, my machine has been doing the same thing only more often. I would say it probably does this at least once a day sometimes twice. Does anyone know what's happening? Is this really serious? Please help, I have no clue what's going on.      Also, I usually have my laptop on for a very long time each day, usually the entire day. I'm in college and have to use it constantly

So, I was sound asleep in my bed, with my computer running beside me, and when I awoke the next morning I turned on my screen(s) to discover a "Machine Check Exception". I thought nothing of it at first, but upon trying to reboot the computer, the screen displayed nothing. Nothing at all. No bios message. It simply recieved no signal. Also, the system lights did not come on, except for the one in the disk drive bay. Strangely, the disk drive was making a skipping noise, as if it was trying to load a disk. It was empty, so I tried to open it, and it would only open half way then close again.      I unplugged both disk drives, along with both RAID harddrives, and it still didn't boot, so I don't think that is the problem. The motherboard does not appear to have anything broken/leaking. The cooling system seems to be working fine.      Does anyone know what this problem could be? Is it one(or both) of my GPUs? Is it the power supply? The mobo? Please help...      This is what I have in my computer.      Intel Core 2 Processor @ 2.66   nVidia 7950GT 512mb x 2   700 Watt Power Supply.   250 GB x 2 RAID 0 Hard drives.   2 x 512mb DDR2 ram @ 800 MHZ   2 x 1GB DDR2 ram @ 800 MHZ      This computer is a few years old (3 maybe?) and has worked perfectly since last night.

20090226131155AAHiuu2	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Is it normal for Hard Drive to make some noise while working?	Sorry for this long description, but I can't make it shorter.      I have a Hitachi HDS721616PLA380 160GB 7200RPM SATA II Hard drive. It is almost 85% full. When I copy, move, open big files from it, it create slight clicking type noise which is audible over my CPU fan and Chassis fan. I thought it was normal because, my old PC's Quantum Fireball LCT20 20GB 5400RPM ATA drive also created that kind of noise. But I'm asking this question because, one of my friends gave me a Samsung HD322HJ 320GB 7200 SATA II drive (which is only 20% full and well defragmented) to me to give him some files. I hear no or very little of that kind of noise from it while moving files from one partition to another of that drive. In fact, once I myself had a 80GB samsung ATA drive for a short time before I upgraded my whole PC and I can't remember of hearing that noise from it either. So why is my hitachi noisy? Is it because It is defective? or is it normal and the samsung has special silent features? or is it only because my drive is full and fragmented and his is empty? Will the samsung also get noisy when it feels up? I didn't measure the speed, but when I hear the silence of the samsung, I feel like the samsung is faster than my Hitachi.

20090226133337AAX27sJ	Computers & Internet;Internet;MSN	My MSN messenger shows people different status's and its getting annoying?	okay, this might be a little hard to explain so read carefully      i compared both my email accounts by signing into msn messenger and yahoo messenger.        now my contacts, i compared one of my contacts who was online, both showed that contact online just like it should.      now my other contact was online, but on my MSN it said she was offline, on my yahoo it said she was online.  i talked to her on yahoo messenger to see if it was a glitch or something, and she responded.  on my msn however, i talked to her and she did respond, but her status was offline.        and another detail, when i added her on my MSN, it told me that two of those accounts were found, they were the same, i deleted one of them since i thought it would just take more space to have two of the same kind, do you think this is the problem?       thanks, it will really help =)

Okay so I have a Apple iBook G4 laptop and a while back I had dropped it outside on the pavement and the corner of the screen hit first so I know that the screen doesn't work but is just kinda flopping there and I was wondering is their any way that it can be fixed, like a new screen etc......the computer will still turn on and everything you just cant see anything.      The screen has a huge crack going from the top right corner to the bottom left corner, and all the wires are hanging out from the back of the screen and where it flips closed. Is it fixable?
20090226132234AAuNOzy	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Question about NetGear Wireless Router?	When I turned on the router this morning I had the following issues:      1. Security on access to the network was disabled.      2. The UPSTREAM light indicator did not continuosly flicker as before.       3. The router is not able to obtain time and date from the server.      4. The CONNECTED DEVICES item in the Router Configuration Application menu, that would allow me to see the names and MAC addresses of  the computers connected,  is no longer there.      Even though I was able to restore the security enabled setting, and have wireless and ethernet access to the internet, I wasn't able to solve any of the other problems.      Has something similar happened to you?       I'd appreciate ANY info or suggestion...         Thanks for taking the time!!

20090226135121AALQ7kg	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Core i7 or Core 2 Quad?	Hello      I will be building a new computer in the summer of 2009.  I am wondering on buying a core 2 quad q9550 or core i7 920.  I will overclock, but that is not my issue.  Currently, i am hearing that LGA 1366 will be replaced in late 2011 or early 2012.  Now, since that i want my pc to last at least 5 years if I'm going LGA 1366.  So really, the question is,  buy LGA 775 now and upgrade to Sandy Bridge 3 years from now or i7 now.  I currently have a 1.7 ghz celeron, so anything would be a major upgrade for me.  Oh and,  the PC will be for mainly gaming and hopefully it will last 'till college assignments.

Just recently I received a Dell Studio 1537 with the following specs:   Intel Dual-Core; 2.00GHz, 800MHz FSB, 2MB L2 Cache   4GB DDR2 800MHz RAM   250G 7200RPM HDD   256MB ATi Radeon HD 3450      And that's the important stuff.. but when I received it the LCD screen was a failure so it remained black - customer support offered to replace it, and I have another Dell Studio with the same specs being built right now to be shipped with Overnight (broken one was shipped 2-day shipping). My question is;      Now Dell has offered another sale with the Studio 1537, and to upgrade the processor to an Intel Dual Core P8600 (2.40GHz, 1066MHz FSB, 3MB L2 Cache) it would only cost an extra $20 or so since this time around the fingerprint scanner and Bluetooth upgrades were free..   Should I cancel the current order and go for that? I know the clock speeds and L2 Cache are better for the P8600, but on benchmark charts the T6400 outperforms the P8600 by a small margin. Also, with either processor, will I be able to run simple games like CounterStrike or Team Fortress 2 with no lag?       Thanks for any help!

I had the live version of Linux on a USB stick.   I installed it to the hard disk.   I understand this is not the full full version of Linux   I've tried a fresh install with a DVD install.

20090226135652AAVw9Kl	Computers & Internet;Security	Why did Comodo bust my net?	I recently installed Comodo Internet Security, I did so because Zone Alarm was conflicting with utorrent and this program came highly recommended. During installation of the firewall kernel driver the installation process appeared to freeze, it got stuck with the progress bar at some 1/4 of the way there. At this point my internet cut out, I am connecting to the net wirelessly via a netgear router located the floor below me in the house. I eventually found I had no choice but to reboot, upon which the problems persisted. I tried the installatio process again, this time completely uninstalling and removing zone alarm before proceeding with the installation (I thought Comodo had done this automatically as the wizard prompts kind of suggested it was going to). This time the program installed fine and comodo is running apparently fine except that it is completely useless to anyone as I cannot connect to the internet, I can see the name of my network in the wireless connections network manager but when I try to connect to it, it says connection unsuccessful. Oddly enough every time I've tried connecting since it's been necessary to disconnect from the wireless network that vista would have me believe I was never able to connect to in the first place. The little red cross remains on the double computer icon in the system tray regardless of this, even when the network manager says "connected with limited access". Seeings how I'm on the internet now on my eeepc on that very network I can't figure out why this is happening and as Comodo is freshly installed, there are no settings or preferences for any programs or services or anything and it would seem odd to me if the firewall by default blocked the routine which allowed windows to connect in any case.      Anyone think they can shed any light?

Basically I bought it second hand and didn't realise that the brightness keys were broken and I couldn't find anywhere on the system to change it so I bought a new keyboard and have just connected it up and it works if I want to type or use the touch pad but still I can't adjust the brightness. Pretty annoying since it's on the brightest setting and often sets my migraines off.      Anyone else had this problem? Is there another way to alter it besides using the keyboard? I've had a look at the remote but there seems to be no way of adjusting it on that either.      Any help/advise is appreciated! Please don't recommend visiting a Sony centre though - we've tried that and they're unwilling to help us (Sony build great stuff but they're pigs for customer service) and I tried to get the previous keyboard fixed but the guys at the only 'specialist' place around messed it up by losing the power button from the keyboard when they took it apart so we couldn't turn the board on (grr)

My friend dual boots XP and Linux, I know that most servers/supercomputers run some sort of Linux, my Uncle dual boots XP and Linux, I believe...      I don't really do any coding/hacking/programming (Don't know if that has anything to do with it or not...)      I do gaming and stuff like that, so I of course need the ability to just basically do the same things that XP does. I need to be able to open up a folder and have all my music and stuff there. I want to use my familiar programs like NOD32, Paint.net, Notepad++, etc. I want to open up Steam and play games like Crysis, CoD4, but also older games like Doom and Quake III Arena.      I'm probably not going to switch OS until / when I feel that I need to, but, just out of interest, what reasons would you suggest I do/don't use some sort of Linux OS? Which one should I use, if any? Why is it hackers/programmers/servers/supercompute... use Linux? What can it do that XP can't?

While I was in PC World, the man was trying to sell me this, and I said to him that I wouldn't be able to install it because there was no dvd drive. However he insisted that you can download it online, and as long as you have a serial number, there would be no charge.      I already had the unused software at home - but having got home, I don't know how to do it.      Anyone got any ideas?

I have a friend we live in same "network" (city/town) and recently I was "DE-friended" by this person... But I can still see the formal-friend profile since we are in the same 'network' (region)... Said friend deleted one of my image/photo posts on his wall (I uploaded it from his page onto his wall using the upload photo tool on his wall page when I was still a 'friend') and I didn't keep a copy of that photo on my harddrive and I don't have it on my own facebook profile... SO when he removed it from his wall I thought it was gone for good... Then today magically it came right back... Reappeared out of nowhere like it wasn't even removed (but I was SURE it was removed and he must have took it off...) So my question is how in the heck is it possible for someone to undelete a deleted post??? How come I can do this? Or is there a way to do this or was this simply a server glitch or something?

20090226150420AAmFBdX	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Bad video card or poor Power Supply?	I just upgraded my computer.  Currently running a 2.6 GHz Dual Core AMD with 2GB of Ram.  I also purchased a 512 MB PCIe Vid card (Sparkle brand, Nvidia 7300GT).  When the video card is installed, the BIOS bypasses it, and uses onboard (which is automatically disabled when a PCIe card is recognized).  Windows XP doesn't see it either.      If I put in a 256 MB Video card, the system has no problems.      Currently running a 350w Power Supply.      Should I look at buying a new video card?  Or could my problem be a too weak Power supply?

I currently have an ADSL connection that is supposedly able to run up to 24000kbps but it actually runs at 5000kbps. I want a faster connection than this if possible. Would cable give me faster speeds since its more likely to be a newer and more trustworthy line than the copper cables are of my phone line? or does it ultimately run on the same lines? or would wireless/satellite be a better option?   Could I do anything about the phone line at all (we have all new wires in the house as its only 1 year old). like complain to telstra or such?

20090226094458AARMlWa	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My mom's Dell Computer is under warrenty but they won't fix it?	So my mom has her Dell Laptop and it is still under warrenty. Something happened with the Window XP I believe and they sent some new pieces out for my mom to put in. My mom is decent with computers but she is no engineer. So she told them she didn't want to fix it herself because she didn't know how and she also didn't feel it was her job. She wanted to sent the computer in and have them fix it. They refused. So they sent a man to come fix it and it took him all day. Now the keyboard is tilted and the mouse doesn't work right. The settings are all off on the touch mouse. She doesn't want to pay anymore for something that doesn't work. She has the money to pay for the computer in cash but won't until she knows it will work. They seem to just want to talk to her on the phone and walk her through fixing it. She doesn't have time to do this as she works over 50 hours a week and even so, doesn't feel it's her job to fix something that was not her fault it broke. I think they should just send her a new computer and take the old one back or accept to take it on and have their people fix it once and for all. How do we get them to make it right? Any suggestions are welcome! Thank you

All right, here's the deal:      I sent my dell laptop under warranty to best buy last Friday, best buy will send the computer to the manufacturer(dell) to have the damaged fan changed.    Now I was wondering how long does that repair REALLY take, they best buy said 3 weeks which I find to be WAY out of limit and unreasonable.       So from personal experiences or knowledge, how long does it really take?

20090226094416AAFxK5G	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why are brand new PCs today, 3 or 4 times slower than PCs were 5 years ago?	We provide a software product.       The system used to install in two minutes on an xp computer in 2003. The same installation now takes an absolute minimum of 5 minutes on xp computers - often much longer.    The Vista installation takes an absolute minimum of half an hour partially due to additional items that are needed.      I am starting to wonder if PCs are actually still usable for people who just want to get on with some work... Perhaps its just me?
