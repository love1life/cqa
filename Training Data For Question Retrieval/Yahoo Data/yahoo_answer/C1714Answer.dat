c1XvN0BVaa	I don't agree with having children if you cannot (financially, emotionally, physically, etc) take care of them. This nonsense of this OctoMom having all these children without a job, is ludicrous!|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Boy, despise is such a strong word. Do you despise everyone who doesn't do what you think they should?<br>  <br>  I have friends who have 17 children. The Father is a respected doctor in the community and wealthy. The Mother, who gave birth to all 17, is a warm, multi-talented and well rounded individual. They spend almost all of their time together, they all get along, the older children adore the younger ones. I not only respect them but am a bit jealous.<br>  <br>  So what you beef? First off, it really isn't any of your business as long as they can provide for them. You are not the population queen, who makes the rules you want others to live by. ( I believe 6 are too many unless you adopt them. What is this, an edict?) It isn't against the law to have several children and perhaps you know that you couldn't personally handle having that many children, so what? You not being able to doesn't mean others aren't.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	I was one of 5 and my dad was the youngest of 9.

S8RL9lieaa	There was I hoping they would be banned on trains and they are now going to let the morons use them on planes too. I use a mobile all the time but never on a train and certainly not when I'm driving. Those are my choice and when I'm on a plane it's more often or not to get away from the bloody things.

I can't do anything about what is going on in the world and it saddens me no end. <br>  <br>  When the plane landed in the Hudson, such an amazing heroic story and people went nuts and it's no wonder.

I mean a tragic story can be upsetting, but in general, I guess I'm 'jaded'. <br>  <br>  And our local news, there are a lot of 'happy stories', too. And some even on the national news.<br>  <br>  On the local news, there are a lot of murders reported, but now and then there will be one in a neighborhood I am familiar with and where there is usually little crime. Local news gets a little repetitious, because there is local news, national news, then local news again; one station in our area runs local news, with national and international stories included from 5 PM until 6:30. It's great if you are just getting home, but the same story is run at least 3 times in that period. <br>  <br>  I do watch the weather.

She wants it to be a deterrent to other would be attackers, and I suppose also retribution. The initial violation of human rights was denial of her right to see, and if you believe the story, simply because she spurned his clumsy attempt at seduction. People can`t have it both ways! Either they are for Womens rights and preventing oppression by men, (often culturally based) or are ready to uphold the rights of the attacker, but did he not himself forfeit those rights?|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	He started it .... and the punishment usually isn't just for the criminal, it is also for others to take it as a lesson and to think even more than twice before they want to commit any horrible thing like that.<br>  <br>  If every israeli pilot who bombed the civilians of Gaza in his plane, knew that his own family will be bombed too, do you think he would continue ?|`|1lCUPVAkaa	My opinion is this is evil and too cruel to conceive for a loving heart.<br>  Of course it is barbaric, to say the least, from both sides.<br>  Certain people use words from the bible for their own advantage and<br>  their sick false reality...........disregarding truth of metaphors at times,<br>  or whatever else. yet I leave God to be her judge, not i.<br>  <br>  "Those without sin cast the first stone" is too clear for some to understand.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	All punishment is barbaric, the deterrent theory, but some go beyond that and better to leave them be than become victim to their psychosis.

I don't agree with the an eye for an eye thing, but I do see its practicality rather than have burns on her eyes for life while this guy gets house arrest he suffers the same fate. If she were here she would probably try to sue but her case would be thrown out over some couple suing over the husband spilling the ^&&*( milk. OUr laws are flawed, they protect the offender but offer little remorse for the victim, so I say let them if she feels that this will make them equal then go ahead.|`|DB0LYUGTaa	Those who do such crimes should also get punished with the same way so the rest see it and don't dare to do the same. The case of course should go to court and the court will check and decide. My opinion is that this is fare coz if i will take it personally, if someone hurt anybody of my family of course i will want the same pain for him. No one have the right to hurt others in any way and if he do so he should be punish.|`|6NrkBdInaa	yes i agree with you that it is barbaric gross violation of human rights,but you must understand Iran is a msulim country and it follows sharia law and according to this law the victim is asked about the punishment to be meted out to the offender and i think girl wanted him to suffer in the same manner in which she suffered.<br>  <br>  if you want to know how stupid and primitive sharia law is read khaled husseni's thousand splendid sun and also his first book kite runner.women are treated worse than animal under sharia law.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Sin.<br>  I do but as a Christian I know that God doesn't want me to live my life like that. Vengeance in mine....says the Lord and what he does will be far worse than anything I could come up with. For some, it is our outrage at injustice that drives our thinking in such matters. Acid dropped in his eyes will not undo what was done to her and after she rejoices for a while she will be back where she was before. I don't think it is a good idea to do the same thing to him. It reduces those to his level which is as low as possible.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	I'd normally quote Ghandi, 'an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind', like Wheatsto... before, but in this case maybe it's justified if it will discourage other men from this kind of action.  Iran is not a civilised place.|`|YJKS5v4iaa	Gandhi said  that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, will make the world blind.<br>  And viola,the Muslim Fundmentalists are now out to show how it can be done.|`|cZc4C4Mpaa	I thing it's far too just ..think for a moment what would your reaction if you were in her place would you say it is barbaric to punish him ! I don't think so...<br>   God bless you|`|D0nnNVyGaa	"An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind." <br>  <br>  Mahatma Gandhi wrote that.

Women, stereotypically are not into punishing people, and I for one take her at her word.|`|wWL934E8aa	In Iran, that is the only "justice" she could get.  Women don't have the freedoms we do and so, when they get the chance to make a statement, they REALLY make a statement.<br>  <br>  I think love and forgiveness is better but even in the US, people aren't happy until 'someone pays!'  not as barbaric but the adage is the same.<br>  <br>  just saying...|`|HkXYGAOdaa	I condone it.  That will teach every man in Iran not to batter their wives.  Unfortunately, the government there has not much respect for women, which makes it more surprising they agreed to her wish.<br>  <br>  It's not barbaric.  He is a savage man.  She will never recover what was viciously taken away from her.  Let him taste his own medicine.  That will definitely prevent other Iranian men from doing the same in the future.<br>  <br>  Sorry if others disagree with me, but this is my honest opinion.|`|GOifC7i3aa	i believe it is barbaric but i haven't been brought up with primitive laws<br>  <br>  she is just getting her own back ......it is too common place for muslim men to throw acid into women and girls faces .......it is an evil crime .......<br>  usually the victim has no revenge ....at least she gets the satisfaction of revenge<br>  <br>  of course it is barbaric but it is the problem we have in the west trying to understand and rationalise primitive traditions<br>  <br>  in pakistan or afghanistan he would have gotten away scott free....|`|S9bEtVCSaa	That is a good question ... I see how morally it rubs us the wrong way.<br>  But - I know that "eye for an eye" thought is very prevalent in many Muslim countries. It used to be in Biblical times as well.

So as much as I don't agree with it - I can see how some would. <br>  <br>  Honestly he should just get attempted 2nd degree manslaughter and spend a few years in prison but that's how Americans think.|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I think it is barbaric; however, if it had been done to me, I wonder what I would feel.

Israel didn't solve any problems, neither side achieved what they were seeking for.<br>  What was clearly a sign of this weakness is the defeat of israel in Lebanon 2006 as vino grad reports.|`|IwlFHNLGaa	no, their international image is weak but their army is stronger than ever. <br>  in 1948 when they pushed back surrounding arab enemies without any army at all, it ws clear that they had to establish a very powerful one in order to avoid further attacks.<br>  its no coincidence that israel hasnt been invaded in a very long time; even Iran is scared of israel.<br>  <br>  if israel wanted to, they could have won the lebanon war, and could have totally wiped out hamas in the more recent war in gaza, however they put the lives of innocent muslims before their need for victory.  this does not show weakness, it shows immeasurable mental strength|`|81Iglngeaa	What a stupid question, how would they be weaker than ever? did they just give up all there weapons all the sudden and go back to fighting with swords|`|20BKec9aaa	When A country has the most powerful country in the world supporting it and giving it as much weapons as its needs you tend to forget weakness.

I bet she thought she would be getting endorsements from pampers, and johnson and johnson, and probably hoping to get a reality tv show out of it, but yeah her plan failed miserably.  <br>  <br>  and also she said she is going to school to have a better life? She could have a great job now with a bachelors! the problem is that she is not working period! and i wonder if her parents are gonna live with her in her new home, because i read her current home is in foreclosure.|`|T0rzivAcaa	i think she shouldnt have had anymore babies! and if she wanted more she should have just adopted. i think we take advantage of new technology too much when there are already children in orphanages all over the world that NEED a place to live. im not saying her children arent a blessing because they are and thank God they survived, but now that she DID have the babies, i dont think they need to be adopted or put into foster homes. i think their mother shouldbe able to take care of her own kids since it was her decision to have them. I also think donations WOULD help nadya and her kids so she can have more room in the house and a better foundation to raise the kids on.|`|s4KZRtF8aa	no.|`|cnMT4pzuaa	I believe what she did with those 6 left over fertilized eggs was the right thing to do. Having them destroyed because she didn't want more kids would have been extremely inconsiderate and selfish. Life starts the moment an egg is fertilized, because of its growth. SO it would have been the same as aborting 6 fetuses. I don't think she should attempt at having anymore kids, but what she did was the right thing to do. I pray that God will give her the strength, patience, love, and kindness to ALL her children, and that he will somehow find a way to let her support her and all of her children without too much struggle. God bless her!
jsj8dqOOaa	Ways to counter terrorism are:-<br>  1) Anti-terrorism legislation to be implemented,<br>  2) Some countries see pre-emptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack.<br>  3) The human security paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity.<br>  4) Police, fire, and emergency medical response organizations have obvious roles. Local firefighters and emergency medical personnel (often called "first responders") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.<br>  5) Whatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place Jersey barrier or other sturdy obstacles outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and truck bombing. Aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening.

Rather than let this group gro and gain support simply make it an out law group and provide American forces to help rid them of this group, then when these misguided "Terrorists" in American and other countries see this their morale is likely to go down because they no longer represent the true people and are exposed as the small group they truly are.

It has been called the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The shootings began in the Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory at 7:15 a.m.  Eyewitnesses described the gunman as an Asian male about 6 feet tall. He apparently shot himself in the head after the killings; part of his face was missing when his body was found. <br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3045574&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=304557...</a><br>  <br>  He was said to have quarrelled in a dormitory with his girlfriend, whom he believed had been seeing another man. A student adviser was called to sort out the row. But the killer produced a gun and shot dead both his girlfriend and the adviser. <br>  <br>  The second shooting was at Norris Hall.  Two hours later he rampaged through an engineering building on the other side of the campus in the town of Blacksburg, killing indiscriminately. <br>  <br>  The gunman was said to be of Asian appearance and dressed in maroon hat, leather jacket and black-military style shooting vest. <br>  <br>  He had ammunition strapped across his chest as he calmly walked from room to room refilling his two 9mm handguns as he shot students. <br>  <br>  He locked the doors of several classrooms to stop anyone escaping. Some terrified students jumped for their lives from fourthfloor windows, while others used desks to barricade doors. <br>  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=448955&in_page_id=1811&ct=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/ar...</a><br>  <br>  The gunman has been identified as a Chinese man who arrived in the United States last year on a student visa.

The CoLB is the freaking _original_. It's _better_ than the abstracted version. I've seen Obama's BC on the web - it looks just like all the other dozens of them I've seen over the years. He's produced it; it's there; people have looked at it. What more do you want? Is he supposed to have certified copies mailed to every nutjob on the planet?|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Obama supporters only hear what they want to hear and deny the rest. I cannot tell you how many questions I have seen in the last couple of days which present factual undisputed information negative to Obama which they have accused the questioner of making up. Simple conclusions. They do not care about truth. They do not care about character. They do not care about integrity.

They read those lies and here's an excerpt for you who idolize Osama:<br>  Re: Obama was born outside the United States and is ineligible for the presidency.<br>  <br>  The Obama Web site dismisses the claim that the candidate was born anywhere but in the United States as “completely false” and “groundless.”<br>  <br>  As proof, the Obama’s campaign has produced a “certificate of live birth” from Hawaii indicating that Barack Hussein Obama II was born Aug. 4, 1961. Critics, however say the document could have easily been forged and is not a substitute for a certified birth certificate.<br>  <br>  No reporter has been allowed to see the original certificate of live birth or its certificate number, which is blacked out on copies of it on the Obama site.<br>  <br>  Skeptics note that Obama’s “Father’s Race” is identified on this document as “African,” a geographic and modern politically correct term rather than a 1961 racial designation. The standard term used on American birth certificates until the U.S. Census changed it in 1980 would have been “*****.”<br>  <br>  Former deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania, Philip J. Berg, a Democrat with mixed credibility (he has supported conspiracy theories involving 9/11), has filed a lawsuit to force Obama to produce a certified copy of his birth certificate. According to Berg, Obama’s paternal grandmother has said she was present at his birth in Kenya, after which his mother promptly returned with her baby to the United States.<br>  <br>  If that is true, Obama could be constitutionally ineligible to be president. |`|xGmkwI8kaa	What is your source that he refuses to produce a certificate?

Why won't Obama do the same thing? <br>  <br>  Sorry but an issue like this needs to be settled and a certificate of live birth is something a hospital gives new parents.  It is NOT a birth certificate that is issued by the STATE.  I just went through this crap to get my son a passport and had to send to the STATE for a BIRTH CERTIFICATE.  Yes there is a seal on a certificate of live birth, but legally it doesn't mean a darn thing.  They are two different things.  <br>  <br>  It's really simple.  Man-up and show your BIRTH CERTIFICATE.  But hiding it and (oh, by the way, the people demanding to see it...is the court system in Pennsylvania...not just Joe Plumber) fighting a court request for presentation of it just concerns some that he is hiding something.<br>  <br>  Want to make a non issue of all the documentation things....how about everybody Man-up(well....except for Palin) and show what you've got.  That way everybody will shut up about it.<br>  <br>  Oh, and certificates of live birth are embossed with a seal, but it still doesn't make it a LEGAL proof of birth.  And yes you can get a job and a drivers license without a birth certificate.  The only document you can't obtain without a birth certificate is a social security card.  I'm 48 and I've never been asked for my birth certificate at ANY job interview and they wouldn't be able to read it anyway.  I was born in Italy and I'm a naturalized US citizen.

I'm disturbed by the recent IDF action in Gaza, but don't really know what the heck Israel is supposed to do in the face of continued random rocket attacks that reach further and further into their country.    I'm also disturbed by the Hamas Charter, Hamas's seemingly ignorant supporters and the wave of anti-Jewish/antisemitic feeling that seems to have been unleashed over the past month or so.    Finally, I'm interested in why this particular conflict bothers people so much considering the greater loss of life in ongoing conflicts in Sudan, DCR, or Sri Lanka to name but three.

And now put up a question why cant we produce a large portion of our own goods, i bet you ll hear, its too expensive to produce here. Then ask why is it so expensive then? They may try to tell it would even more expensive if it were made here. Which is wrong since there was a time when home grown factories produced many goods, until the early 1980's when there was a slow in economic and and increase in inflation and job losses, and so that led to a great idea to outsource because foreign prices are much cheaper. This led to economic growth for big companies that can survive tough times and only have to fire their workforce and shift it overseas,the next week the person laid off will spend his meager handful of hard earned dollars on basics he used to produce, but affordable because they pretty cheap. So this led to more lost jobs, but there were always ways to counteract this with wars, invention, mining, trade, stocks, and a credit card culture with mass lending and brand new money from the mint. Every time you swipe a credit card you have transferred some electronic digits that the banks transfer to the corporation.Although you have to pay that card off along with millions of others, there is always a huge amount of money in circulation that doesn't exist yet it, that hasn't been earned yet. So essentially the bank is producing fake money, toy money, in the form of debt, with interest on top.This has had the effect of increasing the price of production of those outsourced goods because more manpower is needed along with more  infrastructure for new technology, more education to keep up with it,which only covers raw cost.This is compounded by their race for modernization, which demands of higher prices, prices controlled by multi corps saturation of global markets, enabled by massive debt. This my friend, is where were at now, does "bailout" ring a bell? Why does Obama talk about jobs being shipped overseas? Why does he mention making energy advanced cars in america and not in japan? Why is he telling everyone there's a massive energy crisis that needs in house solutions to release the control of oil corps.

However; he's also the most famous Scotsman in the world, an absolute literary genius spoken of in terms akin to William Shakespeare, and in Scotland all you have to say for the majority of people to know who you are talking about is 'The Bard.'    He was Scottish and British in equal measure, in that he could see the flaws in the Union which was recent history in his lifetime but believed it was a good thing if only it was done properly.    A man with as many flaws as qualities, he is an ideal figure to be commemorated as he is known the world over, and as such is known by every descendant of every Scot who has ever left this little land for another life. He is perfect to be used to issue a call to all expatriot Scots and their descendants to return home.    And after all,  as the Bard said, 'A man's a man, for a' that.'|`|oQOFRBd5aa	I dont see why not- hes an iconic scottish figure... and- although i dont think its that amazing- his poetry must be pretty good if its still around 250 years later. plus, we celebrate his birth every year, and (as far as im aware) we dont do that for any other scottish person.

The very first question was the perfect chance for McCain to plant Obama in the flower bed, but instead he spent his first several minutes reassuring the viewers that America is going to come through our financial difficulties okay.    Had he not donated his first several minutes to us, he could have used the time to explain the difference between the Democrat and Republican plans for the bailout. He could have explained that Obama is in lockstep with Bush while he and other Republicans prefer loaning money to these failed financial institutions and making them dig themselves out of trouble. He could have pinned Obama to Bush, then pinned the socialization of our financial industry on the two of them, together--Obama and Bush.    Instead, he used his first several minutes to speak directly to us. He spent the first several minutes reassuring us that everything was going to be okay. Senator John McCain gave up precious air-time to us, because it is, and always has been, Country First with him.     I don't mean to make Obama and Bush out to be bad people here. I don't believe they are. It's just that there is a fundamental difference between people that are true American patriots and those that just talk the talk, then do things to the contrary. This is not a party issue. This is a man compared to a man issue.
