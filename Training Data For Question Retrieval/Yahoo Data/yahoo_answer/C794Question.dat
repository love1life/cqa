I live in Upstate NY and I normally order out at night but I didn't tonight cuz i wasn't hungry at the time but now i'm hungry (my parents are asleep right now and i usually don't go to sleep till 4am).  I'm really hungry right now and i could go for a nice juicy New York Strip.I can go for just about anything right now.  McDonalds & Burger King I think are closed so I'm not sure what to cook. And I don't know how to cook.  So, i had a bowl of ceral, it didn't even satisfy me.  Who's opened 24/7? Tim Hortons & Wendy's are 15 minutes away, I really don't want to go that far.     If I go on the thruway and then go to one of the service areas, are those food places opened? i'm hungry, help. and i'm 21 years old, and I don't know how to cook.!!!

I have never actually tasted rubbing alcohol.. it's a thing where it tastes how it smells.  Anyway, I'm just wondering what could be causing this. Either what's wrong with me or what is being put in the food to make it taste this way. It's very sudden and very obvious. As in, I have to spit the food out because the bad taste is so overwhelming. Any thoughts?

20090307223947AAJhTMj	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What goes well with homemade macaroni cheese?	My mom is a very picky, simple eater. She doesn't like anything "weird," using a lot of spices, or a lot of ingredients. Her usual idea of a good meal is plain old meat, mashed potatoes from a box and a can of corn. So, just to emphasize, nothing that uses a lot of stuff or is "weird" to a middle-aged woman from the south.      I'm making homemade macaroni and cheese; just plain old elbow macaroni in two kinds of cheese and baked, and I'm sneaking a little parsley on top.      What goes well with that? I was thinking of maybe some fried ham, or pork chops. My mom hates lima beans, which sucks, because I love them. :( Corn on the cob with fried ham and macaroni and cheese? What about fried chicken? Thanks!

20090307231043AADtdJC	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Baking apples/apple crisp?	I tried making apple crisp in the oven earlier and the apples did not turn out to be juicy and the topping was extremely dry.  I followed this recipe:    Apple Crisp   2 large baking apples, peeled, cored and sliced   1/3 Cup old-fashioned rolled oats   1/3 Cup firmly packed brown sugar   1/3 Cup all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg   1/4 Cup butter or margarine   Prepare apples by peeling, coring and slicing. Place in bottom of a small casserole dish. In mixing bowl add oats, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and butter. Mix together until crumbly. You can use your hands to break up clumps. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.            Did I need to also add some water to the apples?  The topping turned out more dry and powdery and like I said, the apples did not get moist.  They started to seem to over cook after leaving it longer to bake the apples longer.        Any suggestions? Thanks!

There seems to be quite a number of people who understand the concept of the hard pack but what significances does the soft pack have. The soft packs are still in production and the sales for both are split even.    People can not just be buying the soft pack because they grew up on them because a large contingent of that generation has passed away.   So what is the difference between the soft pack and hard....aside from the physical packaging.

Devo fare una tesina sul gelato e per renderla affascinante si svolgerà così: Intervista ad un gelataio (video), tocco finale con assaggio, sondaggio sulla cittadinanza e pensavo anche sondaggio fra tutta Italia e anche estero. Per l'estero userò Answers estero (Argentina...) me per l'Italia uso questo. Ecco le domande:   1 - Qual'è il vostro gusto preferito?   2 - Quanti gelati mangi in Estate e quanti in Inverno?   3 - In che formato preferisci il gelato (cono, coppetta...)?   4 - Quanto denaro spendi in media in un mese estivo per il gelato. Quanto in uno invernale?    5 - Dove preferiresti consumare un gelato (casa, parco..)?   6 - Con chi preferiresti consumare un gelato (da solo, amici..)?   7 - Cosa pensi del gelato (un qualsiasi tuo parere)?   8 - In che fascia d'età ti trovi (fino 18 anni; 18-30 anni; 30-45 anni; 45-60; oltre 60 anni);    9 - Come sono cambiati i tuoi gusti in base all'età (usa le stesse fasce d'età precedenti fino alla tua)???   10 - Se avete qualche altra domanda è ben accolta.

Per mancanza di tempo non faccio più la marmellata in casa da anni, ma quando la facevo per me la pectina era irrinunciabile... è un prodotto naturale tratto dalle mele, quindi non chimico come pensano in molti, e riduce il tempo di cottura a pochi minuti preservando quindi gusto, colore e profumo della frutta, mentre le cotture prolungate trasformano la marmellata solo in un ammasso zuccheroso! In Italia la pectina è stata messa a disposizione delle massaie solo una ventina d'anni fa, mentre in altri paesi si usa da più tempo (leggendo il Diario di Anna Frank ho scoperto che l'azienda del papà di Anna produceva pectina per uso domestico già nel 1939). Io comunque dico: pectina sì!
