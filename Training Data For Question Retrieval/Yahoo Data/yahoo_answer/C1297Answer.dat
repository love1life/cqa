AA11146651	Ok, first summarize your variables, like this:<br>  1.  X = the amount she invested at 3%<br>  2.  Y = the amount she invested at 5%<br>  3.  Y = 3X<br>  4.  (3% x X) + (5% x Y) = $7,200<br>  <br>  Now, looking at the summary, you see that Y is the same as 3X.  So you could substitute 3X in place of Y in #4, like this:<br>  (3% x X) + (5% x Y) = $7,200<br>  (3% x X) + (5% x 3X) = $7,200<br>  .03X + .15X = $7,200<br>  .18X = $7,200<br>  X = $40,000<br>  <br>  So X, the amount invested at 3%, equals $40,000.<br>  <br>  The other problems can be answered in a similar manner.  You can do it.

Personally, I think intellect can be judged by one's critical reasoning skills.  Are you good at social studies because you are good at memorizing facts?  If so, then that has nothing to do with intellect, that's memory.  Intellect, as far as I'm concerned, is about how you process and use facts.  A person's aptitude for math is one of the best indicators of this because simply memorizing formulas won't get you very far in the subject.  In order to succeed in math, you need to have a solid understanding of the meaning behind the symbols.  You need to be able to process information and arrive at solutions using logical reasoning.  This is critical thinking, not regurgitating information from a textbook or lecture notes.

J6Ksn0P7aa	Your orchid is fine, actually seems to be thriving.  The black spot is a scar, possibly a water spot or from shipping damage, but does not seem to be a pest or anything like that.   The white spots are also nothing to be worried about, many plants are sprayed with plant shine to make them look shiny and healthy.  It is a harmless waxy substance.   The other thing that it could be is spray fertilizer from when the plant was in a nursery.  The stem is another flower bud that is growing, and means that your plant is extra healthy. <br>  <br>  I can not tell from the picture about the small black spots, so watch them.<br>  <br>  The best way to take care of the waxy stuff on the leaves is to give your plant a gentle shower in the kitchen sink, and really wash the leaves off, be careful about getting the flowers wet though.  I use the spray attachment on my sink, but you can use your hands in the spray.  This is actually the best way to water orchids.  Get the bark completely wet once a week or so.  Do not just water it with a watering can, because you are probably not getting it quite wet enough.  Then put it back in its spot.   Never let it sit in standing water for long (an hour or more).<br>  When properly taken care of many phalaenopsis orchids will bloom for months.<br>  Oh, as an extra hint for long flowering, when the flowers have all fallen off and the stem is not brown you can get them to rebloom by trimming the stem above the spot where the second flower from the bottom was attached.  Many healthy phals will rebloom with a second spike.  I had a super healthy phal that I was given that bloomed for 9 months (it was in the most perfect spot in my office).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

klmAEcCraa	i like to drink hot tea and take a couple benadryl. hope this helps!|`|lhm8UVckaa	Most physicians try to get patients to alter their routine sufficiently to include a wind-down period before sleeping. It's also important to avoid sources of caffeine for quite a few hours before sleep. Caffeine is in a lot of things from coffee to tea and chocolate.  It is also known that regular exercise, even 15 minutes a day not only burns off excess nervous energy, but helps to make us tired enough to fall asleep.  Exercise should not be directly before bedtime however.<br>     If these fail, there are a couple of things you can do in order to try to repattern your sleep.  Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) is an OTC antihistamine that ,as a side effect, can make many people drowsy.  An adult over about 150 lbs. can take 50 mg. (Two 25 mg. tablets) at bedtime with sufficient water, and most will become drowsy as a side effect of this commonly used antihistamine.   Sometimes doctors or nurses will recommend that you use this three days in a row in order to repattern your sleep.<br>       Another alternative is Melatonin, an alternative medicine available OTC, directions are on each package. Melatonin is a hormone that is made in our pineal gland which helps to regulate our Circadean rhythms, and regulate sleep. You can use a standard adult dose (from the package) three days in a row, to repattern sleep also.   Some people use Melatonin occasionally to repattern sleep following jetlag.<br>        DO NOT USE BENADRYL FOR THIS PURPOSE IF YOU HAVE SLEEP APNEA OR SEVERE GERD. DO NOT USE BENADRYL IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF ALLERGY OR BECOME HYPERACTIVE WHILE TAKING IT.<br>         DO NOT USE MELATONIN LONGER THAN THREE DAYS IF YOU HAVE ANY ENDOCRINE ISSUES. (Thyroid diseases, Type I or Type II diabetes etc.)<br>         This is a good strategy for a normally healthy adult.

When the spring is let go it pulls the string which is wrapped around the axle which in turn rolls the wheel and moves the vehicle<br>  <br>  But the mouse trap vehicle itself is NOT a simple machine, by definition (there are six simple machines - screw, incline, wedge, pulley, wheel&axle, lever)

Mr4DFAVkaa	Carbonic anhydrase converts CO2 and H2O to bicarbonate, which makes the blood alkaline (raising the blood pH). Somatostatin release is increased by the presence of secretin, which is released when pH levels are low. <br>  <br>  Without carbonic anhydrase, no bicarbonate will be produced, and thus neither secretin or somatostatin will be released. Somatostatin inhibits the release of gastrin, histamine, and HCl, so in this situation, the amount of these substances will be increased.
WRyHOEjSaa	The genotype refers to the gene - the sequence of DNA at the location in question. The phenotype refers to the morphological or behavioral effects of that gene (if any).|`|gf0tOrcpaa	A phenotype is a visible trait such as yellow flowers vs. pink flowers vs. blue flowers etc.  A genotype is the genes that make up yellow vs. pink vs. blue flowers.  Therefore the Genotype makes up the Phenotype.  The phenotype is expressed as Dominant gene --> recessive gene.  Therefore if we take a blue vs pink flower example you will get B for blue and b for pink B is uppercase so it is dominant and b is lowercase so it is recessive.  A GENOTYPE of BB gives us a phenotype of blue flowers, and GENOTYPE of Bb still gives us a phenotype of Blue flowers (because B is dominant over b) GENOTYPE bb gives us a phenotype of pink flowers.  Get it?  Hope so!!! PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!!!! thanks!|`|7orzm3kNaa	Phenotypes -  what you SEE, due to the genotype.

9PIyHfzGaa	if you take the mass of the earth to be M and the mass of the baseball to be m, then the force of gravity from of the earth on the ball is equal to G(M x m)/(r^2) and the force of gravity of the ball on the earth is G(m x M)/(r^2), where G is newton's constant and r the distance between the ball and earth. Now, the masses of each object are quantified by some real number which commutes under multiplication, i.e. (M x m) = (m x M). Thus, the force of gravity between the earth and ball are equal and opposite, which agrees with Newton's Third Law of Motion! Now to compare this earth ball system to the magnet (200g) paperclip (20g) is a good idea, but should be done in an appropriate setting. When placing the two objects on a table in a room on earth, the magnet and paperclip will exhibit a frictional force due to their contact with the tables surface and their respective weights. Since the magnet is 10 times heavier than the clip it will require 10 times the amount of force to set it into motion compared to the clip. Thus, when perturbing the clip from rest with the magnet, the clip will move towards the magnet and not vice versa. How ever if the table's surface was frictionless, in accordance with Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force between the magnet and clip is equal and opposite and thus, the magnet and clip would move toward each other, meeting at their common center of mass. Since the magnet is much heavier, their center of mass is closer to the magnet's original position. The earth is so much more massive compared to the ball that their common center of mass is nearly the center of the earth. Thus, though both are moving toward each other, it seems the earth is still and the ball is the only one moving.|`|He2WsvBcaa	Because the earth is pulling the baseball towards itself (gravity).<br>  Take a magnet (500 grams) for example and you place it on the table, and you place a paper clip (20 grams) near it. Does the paper clip or magnet move? The paper clip moves towards the magnet.<br>  So the object with the larger mass will stay in place while the smaller object with the smaller mass will move towards the larger object exerting the force of attraction.|`|Xs58PYEnaa	because earth has greater gravitational pull and it attracts the particles of less gravity towards itself|`|bCktqpr5aa	The Earth has the bigger mass so its gravitational pull is much bigger than the baseball's. That's pretty much it!

Most expeditions during the Age of Exploration were driven by a desire for profit and commercial advantage, hoping to find new trading partners, precious metals and spices.  The big goal was to find the source of spices, the Indies.<br>  <br>  These travels sometimes took them far from the coast, picking up whatever winds were to their advantage.|`|a496cf97cb71588d9eff553551e31603aa	The ships needed the wind because they were powered by sails.

Good luck, and I hope I helped.|`|e1zvb2ADaa	You will need plenty of food, and bottled water.

Severe thunderstorm watches just mean high winds and lighting. You will receive a tornado warning for your county if a tornado is coming. If that happens, get a flashlight or candle, a telephone (keep in mind if a tornado comes through the phone lines may be down though), a battery powered radio (to listen and make sure the warning is over before you come out) and possibly a bottle of water and go to the shelter. In the mean time, stay away from windows and you should probably turn off and unplug your computer and other electronic in case lightening strikes (it can fry your stuff).|`|ph4psSwNaa	Bring some emergency snacks/ flashlight, maybe a blanket, just in case.

lsUMe5WVaa	Permanent magnets are objects whose electronic structure is arranged in such a way so that the 'spin' of all of the electrons in the material point in the same direction (or at least a large portion of the electrons do).<br>  The reason they're called permanent is because they don't require any sort of external source to maintain their magnetic fields. Fridge magnets are examples of permanent magnets.<br>  <br>  Electromagnets on the other hand, are just coils of wire which are not magnetic until you pass a current through them (hence the 'electro' part of the name), at which point the coil will generate a magnetic field through its core. Electromagnets can be turned on and off at will, however, keeping them on requires a power source. Electric motors contain electromagnets (as well as permanent magnets usually).<br>  <br>  Electromagnets are generally made to be a lot more powerful than permanent magnets.|`|Xs58PYEnaa	permanent magnet-A magnet that retains its magnetism after being removed from a magnetic field<br>  <br>  electro magnet-it means we are applying external electric field to produce magnetism|`|bCktqpr5aa	A permanent magnet does what it says on the tin- it is always magnetic. Examples would be iron or nickel.<br>  <br>  An electromagnet is an artificially created magnet made by wrapping a wire around an iron core and running a current through it. The electric field around the wire induces a magnetic field which is your electromagnet.

The planets closer to the Sun than Earth go through phases, just like the Moon, and from the same cause, the angle from which the Sun illuminates them. When Venus is on the far side of the Sun, it appears in a telescope like a tiny Full Moon. At greatest elongation east (January 14) it was a small half Moon. It's crescent is now narrowing until it becomes a thin hairline as it passes north of the Sun on March 27. It then becomes a morning object and its crescent widens until it again looks like a half Moon at greatest elongation east on June 5. It then moves towards looking like a Full Moon again reaching superior conjunction on January 11, 2010.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	No, that was Venus's shadow you saw.

MXoBrPcMaa	Just 'cause!|`|y6hhAKDNaa	A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight. <br>  <br>  In the evening, the sky sometimes looks orange or red because of air pollution. Dust and other floating particles in the air act as a filter on the sunlight. When the sun is low the air layer is thicker and the light is more filtered, so it looks yellow, orange and finally red. <br>  <br>  A simpler way of explaining it is that during the day, when the sun is out, the light from the sun reflects off the ocean (which is mainly a blue colour) and transfers the colour onto the sky, which is why we say the sky is blue. For example, if people decided that they should dye the sea purple, the results would be that the sky would change to the same colour. <br>  <br>  At night, the sun sets and it stops reflecting off the ocean, which is why at night we do not have a blue sky. <br>  <br>  <br>  In scientific detail: <br>  Light of a particular color is determined by its frequency. The higher the frequency, the more blue it appears. <br>  <br>  Sunlight is made up of many frequencies that when mixed together produce white light. You may have seen a rainbow or the prism experiment where the white light is split up into several colors (frequencies). <br>  <br>  The earth's atmosphere is filled with minute dust particles that act like a filter, scattering the light rays. The rays of light with the longer wavelengths, such as reds and yellows, tend to travel more easily through the atmosphere, while the rays with the shorter wavelengths, like blues and indigos, tend to be dispersed more easily. These more easily dispersed shorter light rays are what give the sky its blue color. <br>  <br>  Incidentally, red skies at sunrise and sunset are caused by the same phenomenon. When the light hits the Earth at an angle it has more of the atmosphere to go through; this increases the filtering effect and that is why you see a red sky.|`|HksTtfNgaa	because of the Universe|`|yzEC5O6gaa	i ask that same question all the time<br>  <br>  aha<br>  <br>  but my science teacher says because the watever reflects off the sky or somthing like that|`|AA11447210	You could've easily looked that up online yourself.

qDYzdz5daa	Assuming you mean intelligent life?<br>  <br>  Well, I think by now enough of the people who actually run the Space Program have seen "Star Trek" (it did inspire many people to pursue space-related careers) that the ide of some kind of non-interference directive would be put in place.<br>  <br>  We'd likely use orbiting probes, since we can put pretty good cameras on them now, and this would certainly speed development of surveilance technology.<br>  <br>  There might be a few extra-stealthy missions, but these would be few because we wouldn't want to risk a malfunction and discovery of our tech (and that would hold true even if we didn't have a "Prime Directive," just for the sake of security.)<br>  <br>  That's one of the reasons I don't believe abduction stories.

If it's an exoplanet, that means already having the technology to send spaceships a long way in an acceptable time.  That means getting up to a fair fraction of the speed of light, and slowing down enough to be able to land.<br>  <br>  We wouldn't have sent out humans, as it would still take many years and life support would be difficult, but robots could do it.  I don't think we'll ever send out humans unless we're able to terraform a planet.  And that would most likely be done over a long period by robots.  1000 year project plans.<br>  <br>  If we discovered intelligent life, that would be different.  It would depend how far away they are, but if there's any prospect they're still a civilisation, we'd try to make contact.<br>  <br>  We'd start out by trying to interpret their signals, understanding as much of their culture as possible. then send continuous signals directly to them.  There's be no chance of a Q&A because of the enormous time delay, but we'd beam out a whole bunch of questions as well as ongoing information about ourselves.<br>  <br>  If they're at a distance where travel may be possible, then that would encourage us to develop long-term life support systems and spaceships capable of supporting generations of people, with all their needs and psychological aspirations being met.  What would happen when they arrive?  Who knows?<br>  <br>  Again, this sort of thing could be a 1000 year project.

YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT THERE!<br>  <br>  These kinds of predictions come from self-credentialed quacks, crackpots, and scurrilous media opportunists. This would not have been nearly such a big deal if it hadn't been for the History Channel and its unconscionable programming decision to air that abysmal documentary -- not once, but several times.<br>  <br>  Nothing that has been rumored about some disaster or the end of the world in 2012 is true. There will be no galactic "alignment." The sun appears to cross the galactic equator on December 21, EVERY year and it does not, and will not, cross the galactic center. And even if it did, there would be absolutely no effect from it.<br>  <br>  The Mayans did not predict or imply the end of the world. And even if they did, so what? Various people or groups claiming some special insight have predicted the end of the world numerous times, just within my own lifetime and we're all still here. Some claim this was predicted by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Aztecs, the I Ching, etc., and every one of those claims is bogus. No, I don't just mean the predictions are wrong; I mean those people never even MADE any such predictions. Again, this is the result of liars and frauds who post things to the Internet or who manage to write a book or get their faces in front of a camera. Some television networks will air anything they think will get more viewers to see their commercials. It's all about making money from their sponsors.<br>  <br>  Other claims people make are equally bogus. There is NO planet Nibiru. The earth's magnetic poles will NOT flip in one particular day -- or year -- or century. That process takes thousands of years. And the earth's axial poles, don't EVER flip. People who talk about this Planet X are equally ill-informed and need to learn which sources of information are reliable. There is no such planet. That hypothesis was ruled out over a decade ago. If such a long term planet existed and it was due to be close to us in 2012, it would be inside the orbit of Saturn by now. Astronomers everywhere, even amateurs, would know about it. But there isn't a single one who claims the existence of this object. Again, this comes from people who post to the Internet without having a clue what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  There is NO computer program which can predict the end of the world and the creep who says he wrote such a program is also a liar and a fraud. And no, none of these claimed sources ever predicted 9-11 like their advocates say they did.<br>  <br>  There is no cyclical event which is due to recur in 2012, except for a solar maximum. These happen about every 11 years and there is no reason to believe this upcoming one will be any more harmful than any of the previous ones.<br>  <br>  This bunk is being pushed by unprincipled people looking for a profit, (like the History Channel), or out to scare kids or terrorize people back into church, (like St. Birgitta, on Youtube.)<br>  <br>  I can't imagine what kind of preparation there would be, but this isn't going to happen anyway.

Gmvldblraa	No. You do not need 150 N to move the combined weight. With lack of friction it is possible to move any distance sideways with no transfer of energy.<br>  You need 150 N to lift Bob. Once lifted, no more mechanical work needs to be done. Just the same as putting something up on a shelf.<br>  However in holding something up with muscles while we might not be doing mechanical work but we do heaps of biological work. Our muscles relax and contract, generate lactic acid and we get exhausted. But from the physics point of view nothing has happened.<br>  Its a trick question - one of the biggest conflicts between everyday experience and the definitions of physics. We have no easy way to account for biological work and I think this question is really just pointing this out and hopefully all your future questions will be set up to avoid the possibility of misleading people, as this question does.<br>  <br>  There is another legitimate "misleading question". "A slingshot is loaded with a 0.5 kg stone. The sling is 1.5 m in length and whirled around the slingers head in a horizontal circle at 3 revs per second. What is the work done per second?"<br>  You should recognise from the context - no work is done because the force, the centripetal tension in the sling does not shift its position with respect to the centre of the circle.<br>  <br>  Hope this all helps - its only physics, no need to get worried about it.

AA10335036	You have to pay attention to the polarities of the charges and the relative directions of each charge pair.<br>  For each charge, calculate the contribution to force from each of the other two charges:<br>  F = SIGN(r)*kq1q2/r^2,<br>  where SIGN(r) is the direction (+1 or -1) FROM the contributing charge TO the target charge. Assume rightward is positive, like a conventional x axis. Then, e.g., the force contributed by qr to qm is positive (q1q2 negative * SIGN(r) negative), but the force contributed by qm to qr is negative (q1q2 negative * SIGN(r) positive). Sum the two force contributions to the given charge that you calculate to obtain total force on that charge. Then you'll have a number representing the total force in magnitude and direction.

If you push (apply force) to an object on a frictionless surface (theres no such thing as real frictionlessness) it would keep going without slowing down until it encounters something with friction. However when you push it on a floor or table or something like that with friction, it only goes a certain distance before the friction force slows it down enough to stop it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

This has led scientists to extensively study the possible influences of solar activity on terrestrial climate, as well as examine other stars for evidence of activity cycle behavior similar to the Sun's.<br>  <br>  The existence of the Maunder minimum is interesting on purely astrophysical grounds, because it suggests that the regular rise and fall of sunspots observed from 1715 all the way through to the present day may not be a permanent, or even typical, aspect of solar behavior. It is possible to create a rough reconstruction of the sunspot record prior to the invention of the telescope, using indirect indicators of solar activity, and there is evidence for other Maunder minimum-like periods intermittently from about A.D. 1250 through 1715. The solar cycle as observed today, is therefore not the state in which the Sun spends all—or even most—of its time. Having only observed one Maunder minimum, we have no idea whether the Sun spends 10%, 50%, or 90% of its time in such a state.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	It was a period of solar inactivity from 1645 to 1710<br>  <br>  When there are very few sunspots for over 50 years, that indicates a decrease in solar activity. The sun is a slightly variable star. That is very interesting, because i the decrease in solar activity decreased the average annual temperature on the Earth and meant that large rivers in Europe, like the Thames, froze long enough every year to walk and ice skate on

bCktqpr5aa	Consider the forces acting on the car. In one direction you have the force provided by the engine pushing the car forwards, in the opposite direction there is an opposing force due to air resistance or drag (this is a simplified model ignoring resistance from the road surface etc).<br>  <br>  Drag for an object travelling through a fluid (air is a fluid) is given by:<br>  Drag = 0.5*Cd*rho*A*v^2<br>  where Cd is a constant dependent upon the shape of the object, rho is the density of the fluid, A is the area of the object and v is its velocity.<br>  <br>  Thus looking at this equation if the area is increased the opposing force is increased and the forwards force from the engine must be increased to continue at the same speed. So the more streamlined the car the less force the engine needs to provide and the better fuel economy.|`|AA11828439	Less friction|`|AA12283595	A streamlined vehicle will have less wind resistance, <br>  thus the engine will need less power to keep the <br>  vehicle pushing thru the wind.

D65nmX0Eaa	It would depend on which chromosome it was linked to and if it was dominant or recessive. If the trait is X linked and it is dominant, then both would only need one copy of the gene, but the female could have two. The female could be X,X or X,x. The male would be XY. If the trait is Y linked and is either dominant or recessive, only the male could get it and it would only have the possibility of getting one copy. If the trait is X linked and is recessive, the female would need two copies xx, but the male would only need one copy because he only has one X chromosome, he would be xY.

Also, the double helix is easily unwound and broken apart, allowing mRNA to be created rapidly.|`|LgTHnTtqaa	The double helix shape of DNA is important for its relationship with the resulting phenotype. The shape of the DNA allows DNA binding proteins to access the genes with in the helical structure.

The slightest change in the structure would prevent the genes from being expressed since the DNA binding proteins would not be able to access the genes.
KJHw0oI3aa	I have a short-cut into identifying acidic, basic, and neutral salts.  Look at their "family tree".  A salt may be obtained by reacting a base with an acid.  Therefore, a salt may be looked upon as an offspring of two parents:  mother base and father acid.  As the human children inherit characteristics from their parents according to the rules of genetics, salts also "inherit" ions from both "parents" and often resemble one parent more than another.  To use this analogy, we must first identify the salt's "parents", decide which "parent" is stronger, and then apply the principle that the "salt takes after the stronger parent".<br>  <br>  Ammonium cyanide is the offspring of <br>  base: ammonium hydroxide - weak Kb = 1.8 x 10^-5<br>  acid:  hydrocyanic acid - weak - Ka = 4.9 x 10^-10<br>  Since both "parents" are weak, but not equally weak, the salt will take after the stronger one with larger ionization constant.  That would be ammonium hydroxide.  Therefore ammonium cyanide will be slightly basic.<br>  <br>  Ammonium acetate is the offspring of <br>  base: ammonium hydroxide - weak Kb = 1.8 x 10^-5<br>  acid:  acetic acid - weak - Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5<br>  Since both "parents" are equally weak, the salt will not take after either of them and remain neutral.<br>  <br>  Sodium fluoride is the offspring of <br>  base: sodium hydroxide - strong<br>  acid:  hydrofluoric acid - weak - Ka = 3.5 × 10^?4<br>  Since the "parent" base is stronger than the "parent" acid, the salt will take after its "parent" base, and be a basic salt.<br>  <br>  Ammonium hydrogen sulfite is the offspring of <br>  base: ammonium hydroxide - weak - Kb = 1.8 x 10^-5<br>  acid:  sulfurous acid - weak - Ka = 1.5 × 10^?2<br>  Since both "parents" are weak but not equally weak, the salt will take after the stronger of them and be slightly acidic.<br>  <br>  ammonium sulfide is the offspring of <br>  base: ammonium hydroxide - weak - Kb = 1.8 x 10^-5<br>  acid:  hydrosulfuric acid - weak - Ka = 9.5 × 10^?8<br>  Since both "parents" are weak but not equally weak, the salt will take after the stronger of them and be slightly basic.

2YmCCr82aa	Spectacular, powerful, and sometimes deadly, lightning is one of the most common weather phenomena. Satellites detect more than 3 million lightning flashes each day around the world, or an average of more than 30 flashes per second. Lightning has also been observed on the planets Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Yet despite its frequent occurrence, lightning is still not completely understood.<br>  <br>  How lightning forms<br>  Lightning is generated in cumulonimbus clouds (thunderheads), which typically have a negative electrical charge near the middle of the cloud and a positive charge at the top. These charges are believed to build up mainly through collisions between small ice particles and very small hailstones or graupel. When they collide, the lighter ice particles tend to come away with a greater amount of positive charge and carry it high into the storm, while the small hail obtains mostly negative charge and stays lower in the cloud. The negative charge causes a "shadow" of positive charge on the earth below. <br>  Conditions are then right to form an electrical circuit--this is what lightning is. An insulator--the air--keeps the connection from forming, but eventually the charges within the cloud grow too great for the air to restrain them. An electrical impulse, called a leader, reaches downward from the cloud in steps, each step covering about 50 meters (150 feet). When the leader nears the earth's surface, streamers arise to meet it, and the circuit is complete. A bright streak of electricity, the stroke of lightning, ascends along the same course the leader took. Several more strokes may follow this same path or a slightly different one. <br>  <br>  The whole sequence is "lightning fast." The leader travels at 220,000 kilometers (136,000 miles) per hour, the pauses between steps take 50 millionths of a second, the return stroke moves at over 100 million kilometers (62 million miles) per hour, and all subsequent strokes are so fast the eye sees a single flickering lightning bolt. <br>  <br>  There are many variations. More than half the time, lightning occurs within a single cloud or between clouds rather than reaching the earth. An uncommon but powerful type of lightning occurs when a flash originates in the positively charged region of a cloud, often when the wind has torn it away from its negatively charged parent. Lightning can appear in different forms as well: a ball, ribbon, sheet, or string of beads. <br>  <br>  <br>  Studying lightning<br>  Benjamin Franklin grossly underestimated the force of lightning when he did his kite-and-key experiment. An average stroke can easily release 250 kilowatt-hours of energy, enough to operate a 100-watt light bulb continuously for more than three months. And at 30,000 degrees Celsius (54,032 degrees Fahrenheit), lightning is five or six times hotter than the surface of the sun. All of this energy is contained in a channel about the width of a human thumb. (Why can't we harness his energy for human uses? As powerful as they are, lightning flashes are so brief that their energy pales next to the amount we use in our industrial society, and learning how to collect and direct the lightning energy would be an enormous task.) <br>  Modern-day Franklins at NCAR use up-to-date techniques to investigate lightning. A specially equipped sailplane has gathered data from inside electrical storms over Florida, New Mexico, Montana and Colorado. Recent studies have used specialized lightning detectors to count all of the flashes in a storm, both those that remain wholly within the cloud as well as those that make it to earth. Scientists have also mapped entire paths of lightning flashes inside clouds to track where they originate and how they create chemical changes in storms. And scientists are getting a much clearer picture of lightning distribution over the U.S. with a nationwide network of detectors that tracks cloud-to-ground strikes. Data from this network often appear on television weathercasts. New instruments can monitor the total amount of lightning activity, including intracloud and cloud-to-ground flashes. These sensors will help scientists gain much more information on overall storm intensity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lightning safety<br>  Lightning kills more people than tornadoes, hurricanes, or any other kind of bad weather except floods. But because lightning usually kills people one at a time, it tends to be underrated as a hazard. The best protection against lightning is to stay indoors during a thunderstorm. But stay away from the telephone; about 1% of people killed by lightning were talking on the phone at the time. If you cannot reach a building, a car offers excellent protection. <br>  The highest point within the positively charged shadow under a thundercloud--a hilltop, a tree in a meadow, a golfer--is the easiest place for the leader to reach. So avoid high places during storms. <br>  <br>  <br>  Never take shelter under the only tree in an open area; if you must shelter under trees, look for a grove of uniform height. <br>  If you are t|`|cqvh15Tbaa	Please take a look at websites below: <br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this will have enough useful info for you.|`|ikUQfpd9aa	lightning is different then thunder.<br>  lightning is what helped benjerman franklin create electricity. <br>  <br>  Sorry if thats not alot but hey im only 10.

AA10112320	The snout of dik-diks forms a proboscis, interpreted as an adaptation for cooling (the blood that flows through the proboscis lining is cooled by evaporation). <br>  Its small body size is the result of its evolutionary history - the ancestors of dik-diks were larger. Small size can be advantageous because it allows animals to rely on hiding for protection, and a small body requires less nourishment... of course there are also advantages to having a large body, and also tradeoffs, so being very small is simply their particular evolutionary strategy. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by "ant ancestors". Ants have nothing to do with the ancestry of dik-diks; they are deer, and closely related to the other ruminant families (antelopes and sheep, and giraffes). <br>  <br>  See the links below for reliable information:<br>  <br>  ************<br>  EDIT. Thanks for clarifying. Well, the dik-diks (genus Madoqua) are traditionally classified with other "dwarf antelopes" in the deer tribe Neotragini. In turn, this group's closest relatives are another deer tribe, the Antilopini, which comprises the well known gazelles and the saiga antelope.<br>  Here's a scientific research paper about the family relationships of the dik-diks that suggests that these "dwarf antelopes" are not closely related, but that they have been lumped together because of their small size:<br>  <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/q486117161438339/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/q486...</a><br>  <br>  In any case, their closest ancestor must have been an animal similar to a gazelle, and larger than the living species.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The common name comes from the call this animal utters—a dik-dik or zik-zik sound —as it dashes away in a series of zigzag leaps when startled. Kirk’s dik-dik and Guenther’s dik-dik are the most common species. Both range into Tanzania and Kenya, and Kirk’s dik-dik also is found in Angola and Namibia. <br>  <br>  An adult dik-dik is about 52 to 72 cm (about 20 to 28 in) in length with a short tail about 5.5 cm (about 2 in) long, stands about 30 to 45 cm (about 12 to 18 in) at the shoulders, and weighs about 3 to 7 kg (about 7 to 15 lb). The dik-dik has small horns, sometimes concealed in a tuft of hair on the head, and a long nose. Coloring varies from yellowish-gray to a reddish-brown, and from gray to white. <br>  <br>  This shy, elusive animal lives with a permanent mate, occupying a territory of 5 to 30 hectares (12.5 to 75 acres) for several years, or even for life. The dik-dik is most active in the morning and late afternoon, grazing on grasses and shrubs such as acacias. It apparently lives for months with no source of water except dew and the moisture in the vegetation it eats. One young is born about six months after mating. <br>  <br>  The dik-dik is hunted by humans for its hide, which is sold as gazelle leather and made into gloves. Because at least two hides are needed for a pair of gloves, the demand for dik-dik hides is high.

This relates to impermeable and semi-permeable membranes found in a cell. The plastic bag is impermeable, because it doesn't let anything through. However, the cheesecloth is semipermeable because it only lets certain things through. <br>  Basically, certain membranes only let certain things through.|`|QPRwqbDlaa	Well the cell membrane has two main functions, to allow nutrients in and to keep unwanted substances out.

These are in fact artificial satellites, shining by light reflcted from the Sun. They fade when they enter the Earth's shadow. If you're watching them with binoculas, you can actually see them fade to orange and red as they're lit by the setting Sun. And you're right that they're more common in the summer, because the Earth's axis is tipped towards the Sun, and the upper atmosphere is more in sunlight.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Some satellites are irregularly shaped, with dark and reflective patches, sometimes coloured, and can spin in orbit.  These will blink in the sunlight.<br>  <br>  Others are more regularly shaped, regularly (un)reflective, or don't spin.  These will probably not blink.<br>  <br>  Some are in low, fast orbits, and seem to streak across the sky.<br>  <br>  Others are in higher, slower orbits, and slowly drift across the sky.<br>  <br>  When satellites move into shadow, it's not a sharp boundary.

AA11513203	What evolution says is that the human species with males and females, evolved from an earlier primate species that already had males and females ... and those evolved from earlier mammal species that already had males and females ... and so on, and so on .... all the way back to the early vertebrates.<br>  <br>  Now you may ask what was the first species with males and females and this is itself a big question.   (And if you want, I can go into this a bit too.)<br>  <br>  But first, does this explains that it is NOT like the human species evolved first, and *then* "split" into males and females?

Please don't start out thinking that I'm trying to "sway" you.   All I want to do is *explain* how evolution works.    It has to at least *make sense* before we can even begin to talk about whether there is evidence to support it.   But if it doesn't make sense to you, then there's no point in even discussing evidence.<br>  <br>  P.P.S. ... iseahjones' answer misses the point.   He just shows the confusion that happens when you decide *beforehand* to reject a theory before you are even close to understanding it.  For example he is confused that "some" think we evolved from monkeys, and "some" think we evolved from the sea.   This is all mixed up.   *ALL* evolution supporters (including pretty much ALL scientists) will tell you that we evolved from an earlier *primate* species (not any kind of "monkey" species that still exists) ... and that long, long, long before that, the land vertebrates evolved from sea creatures ... so implying that these are separate theories is just muddled understanding.   <br>  <br>  And when he says "all i can say for now is that your question can not be answered with evidence that support any answer"  ... he is getting confused between *EXPLANATION* and *EVIDENCE*.   You are asking for an *EXPLANATION*.   Forget about evidence until the *EXPLANATION* makes sense ... or else you won't know what the evidence is trying to show.<br>  <br>  UNDERSTANDING (explanation) first ... evidence later.<br>  <br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Back to you Lindsay.

The white paper by the National Academy of Sciences on evolution is quite good ..as is the web page with references  for the National Center for Science Education.

kPG2g4iSaa	There are several problems with your hypothesis. <br>  <br>  First, you incorrectly assume that placing a smaller operating microwave oven inside a larger operating microwave oven will somehow cause the smaller oven to be more powerful. In all likelihood, the smaller oven would simply be destroyed because of the necessary metal content of the smaller oven - especially the metal in the magnetron.<br>  <br>  Second, in order for anything to heat up in a microwave oven, it must have a molecular dipole moment. Uranium has no such moment. UO2, commonly used as nuclear fuel, may have a dipole moment, but I was unable to find it.<br>  <br>  Third, even if your sample could be heated in a microwave oven and even if that oven's power could be increased by putting it inside another microwave oven, the net result is simply that you''ve heated up your uranium sample. Simply heating up uranium in any form does not cause a nuclear reaction.<br>  <br>  Fourth, you don't explain how the theory of relativity pertains to your hypothesis.<br>  <br>  If you get a really good idea, the last place you want to discuss it is Y!A.

These are the pretty streaks of light that you see in the sky which some people also call shooting stars.<br>  If the meteor does not burn up and ends up hitting the surface of the Earth, it then becomes a METEORITE. If you can hold it in your hand, it is a meteorite.<br>  <br>  The true source of Meteorites can be from the earth orbit passing in the same path that a comet might have passed through, It could be a piece of debris ejected when a meteor or asteroid hit a moon or planetary body.  They could originate from a long ago star supernova.  <br>  <br>  I am not aware of any meteorites with extraterrestrial biological material.  ----well in the movies maybe.

CCeRdaoLaa	Retroviruses inject their genetic material into cells like any other virus, but once there, the material is reverse-transcribed into DNA and integrated with the host's DNA.  At a later date, the viral DNA can excise itself and trigger normal viral replication.<br>  <br>  Like any viral process, though, it's messy.  Viruses don't have the strict controls that cells do, so they tend to make a lot of mistakes.  Sometimes the virus can remain lodged within the host's DNA permanently (everyone has many of these - passed down from generation to generation all the way back to the first one to be infected - we even share some with other animals, indicating common descent).  When the virus gets lodged there, sometimes it can alter the expression of an existing gene, boosting it or knocking it out entirely.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, when the virus excises itself, it can take part or all of another gene with it - the next host to get infected can thereby inherit the gene, sometimes even jumping between species (sort of a natural transgenic animal).<br>  <br>  We can also make use of viruses, ourselves.  They play a huge role in biotechnology and genetic engineering, since they're an easy and reliable way to introduce a new gene into another cell.  We're a ways away from it, but eventually they may be used to carry new genes into a host as part of gene therapy (to replace a defective gene in someone with, say, cystic fibrosis).|`|wNjTwJ5daa	One example is the Bacteriophage -- it kills certain bacteria.

koniJEZaaa	The distance doesn't matter for this problem. Let us define our coordinate system as polar with east as 0 degrees. On this we shall have the three vectors, the propulsion from the wind, the propulsion from the plane, and the path of the plane. The vector of the path of the plane is made up by adding the vectors for the propulsion.<br>  <br>  The plane must travel 30 degrees east of north, or 60 degrees in our coordinate system. This makes up the angle of the vector of the path of the plane, the magnitude undefined. Since the prevailing wind is from the west, it is going east. Hence the wind is traveling at 0 degrees with a magnitude of 80km/hr. The propulsion of the plane has a magnitude of 300km/hr, with the angle undefined.<br>  <br>  From this, we can see that the Law of Sines can solve for the angle between the propulsion of the plane and the path of the plane. At that point we will have two of the three angles making up the triangle enclosed by the three vectors, and can find the third, which is supplementary to the angle we want to find.<br>  <br>  300/sin(60) = 80/sin(θ) ---> θ = sin^-1(80/300*sin(60) )= 13.35 degrees<br>  Heading = 180 - (180 - 60 - 13.35) = 60 + 13.35 = 73.35 degrees

As another said, donkeys and horses can breed to create mules, which are sterile.  Lions and tigers to create ligers, yes I've actually seen a stuff or mounted one presented at the Hogle Zoo and they exist, but they're sterile.  If two animals can't have children who are not sterile, the logic behind it is that they're probably not the same type of animal.  Rattlesnakes and boa constrictors cannot even breed, for example.  If they look a lot different but can still have children who can in return also breed, ex. different types of domestic dogs, then they're probably just different races of the same species, or subspecies.<br>  <br>  Geographically isolated is something I've also seen as a description, but at the same time deer and bears live in the same habitat, but are not the same animal species.<br>  <br>  B is the closest to the truth out of them all, so I'd say B.|`|51b3b4072d7710ba8a5f993e35fe50b0aa	e. is the correct answer.<br>  <br>  b. is not the correct answer because it is possible to interbreed some closely related, yet different species.

70ab19d1a0d8e7e1eb468613b9030ebdaa	Some plants, like succulents, or cactus, conduct photosynthsis by using what is called CAM photosynthesis, where they uptake all the sunlight and water and only open their stomata at night. This allows the plant to not become dehydrated since they respire during the night instead of the day.  Other things plants use are a heavy wax cuticle that lowers evaporation loss, sometimes trichomes (the white hairy substances on something such as lamb's ear), which reflects light and keeps the plant cool and thus less water loss, and also plants like corn, among other plants will roll their leaves to reduce sunlight exposure.  <br>  <br>  hope that helps, i'm a senior in agriculture, and i think that's pretty much it... it's been a while since i've had the full photosynthsis thing, though, so you might want to double check...

The equation of the combustion of Mg is:<br>  Mg + 1/2O2 --> MgO (the 1/2 O2 is basically a single oxygen atom)<br>  So when one mole of magnesium burns, the amount of magnesium oxide formed will have a mass in grams equal to magnesium oxide's molar mass. When double this amount is burned, double magnesium oxide's mass will be formed in grams.

Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a>|`|96705959f78f5df65e5b7ed5348ec228aa	Seriously, if anybody had the true answer to this question then they would not be from this universe.

This also means that your 14 will have its decimal moved over two spaces, changing it into 1400. The fraction is now 1400 over 9. I'm almost certain that this is the simplest form of this fraction, but that is besides the point. <br>  <br>  The reason you multiply 14/9 by 1/100 is because .9 is equal to Nine hundredths. I'm thinking that here you would cross multiply the two fractions, changing the 14 into 1400 just like the way I just explained it.<br>  <br>  That book of yours seems to be very misleading, but I'm hoping that my explanation will further your understanding.

ejodXS5naa	They are roughly the same.  Absorption spectra refers to the medium absorbing the radiation while excitation spectra refers to the frequencies that the medium is excited at.  Excited means both the wavelengths that the medium absorbs at (the absorption spectra) and the wavelengths that the medium emits at (emission spectra).  In most simple mediums (like atoms or simple molecules) the absorption and emission spectra are exactly identical and that means the excitation spectra is also identical.  In a few complicated molecules (like laser dye molecules) the emission is different than the absorption and that means the excitation spectra is the combination of both emission and absorption.  But for most simple mediums (atoms or simple molecules) they are all identical.
HxXduL1maa	Photons always travel at the speed of light, but they lose energy when travelling out of a gravitational field and appear to be redder to an external observer. The stronger the gravitational field, the more energy the photons lose because of this gravitational redshift. The extreme case is a black hole where photons from within a certain radius lose all their energy and become invisible. Indeed, light in the vicinity of such strong gravitational fields exhibits quite bizarre behavior. Here are links to some movies illustrating virtual trips to black holes and neutron stars. <br>  The event horizon is the point outside the black hole where the gravitational attraction becomes so strong that the escape velocity (the velocity at which an object would have to go to escape the gravitational field) equals the speed of light. Since according to the relativity theory no object can exceed the speed of light, that means that nothing, not even light, could escape the black hole once it is inside this distance from the center of the black hole. A more fundamental way of viewing this is that in a black hole the gravitational field is so intense that it bends space and time around itself so that inside the event horizon there are literally no paths in space and time that lead to the outside of the black hole: No matter what direction you went, you would find that your path led back to the center of the black hole, where the singularity is found. <br>  Black holes almost certainly exist, and one of their basic properties is that they trap light. However, it is also true that nothing exceeds the speed of light. In fact, the theoretical prediction of black holes is due to the General Theory of Relativity, which is built on the principle that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant. The analogy of a cannonball falling back to Earth with the trapping of light in a black hole is only a crude and suggestive one that is not correct at a fundamental level (for one thing, the cannonball has mass, but light does not; it turns out that this difference is critical, because massless particles MUST travel at light velocity, but massive particles CANNOT travel at light velocity). <br>  To understand fully why a black hole can trap light but the light still always travels at constant velocity requires an understanding of the General Theory of Relativity, but the essential point is that the black hole curves spacetime back on itself, so that all paths in the interior of the black hole lead back to the singularity at the center, no matter which direction you go (an analogy in two dimensions is that no matter which direction you go on the surface of the Earth in a "straight line" (what mathematicians call a "geodesic" or a "great circle"), you never escape the Earth but instead return to the same point. Imagine extending that analogy to the 4 dimensions of spacetime and you have a rough explanation for why light travels at light speed, but cannot escape the interior of a black hole.|`|NMAfFeNcaa	well you are right. but some light that is relatively far but close to the black hole gets bended by gravity. so since the light got affected by the black hole but escaped the gravity it is visible. but if the light gets completely sucked into the hole it can never be seen/absorbed.|`|ps0tupqAaa	The emission of rays are not by the Black Hole itself but the material surrounding the Black Hole.  As a material falls into the Black Hole, it doesn't just fall straight in.  Instead, its orbit becomes smaller and smaller.  As this happens, it will encounter materials.  The friction between these materials cause tremendous amount of heat which leads to the release of x-rays and such by the heated materials.  <br>  <br>  A pulsar is formed by a dense gravitational body that some how focuses the materials falling towards it into two narrow emission beams along its poles.  This is most likely caused by the intense magnetic field surrounding these bodies and can be either a Black Hole or a Neutron Star.  The distinction is by the mass of the radiating body.  If it reaches a certain limit, it is most likely a Black Hole.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	The light is not visible. Also black holes can only be seen when gas from the companion star is about to be sucked in. It emits X-Ray light and that is what we "see."
oVz6sPsIaa	First, a car or any other object cannot attain the speed of light.  However, for the purposes of discussion, let's pretend that it is moving at 99.99% of the speed of light, which IS theoretically possible.  Well, strangely enough, when you turn on the lights you will see the light wave or photons (depending on your point of view) to be leaving the headlights at the speed of light, relative to the car.  A person by the side of the road would see the photons passing by at the speed of light relative to them.  In fact anyone either moving in any direction or standing still will all measure the light wave to be moving at the speed of light relative to their reference frame.  It sounds strange, but that is how light behaves.  This behavior is one of the basic foundations of Einstein's theory of special relativity.  Google 'speed of light' or 'Michelson-Morley experiment'.|`|KAA76hhMaa	If an object was accelerated to the speed of light it would turn into light, therefore Light cant make more light from a lightbulb made of light|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	You'll see the light from the headlights traveling away from you at the speed of light.<br>  <br>  Doug|`|LDBvgEG0aa	You turn into a goat.|`|SS5py9jIaa	I gotta get me one of dem cars.|`|FHHzOy9vaa	The light would emit from the headlights at the speed of light, not twice the speed of light as you might expect. If you were to ride a bike and throw a ball forward at the same time, the speed of the ball would be the speed you throw it plus the speed the bike is going forward. Light is different though. Light speed is constant no matter how fast the object giving off the light is going. So the light would come out of the headlights and travel at the same speed as your car is traveling.|`|MXoBrPcMaa	Goats, huh....<br>  Well, that sure explains a lot.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Which is another way of saying nothing can be accelerated to that speed, as the resulting infinite mass you would have to push would require an infinite amount of energy.  This was Einstein's happiest thought from which he derived his theory of special relativity.  Light is constant, no matter what one's relative motion through space is.  If you  managed to get the car to move at 99.999999999% the speed of lights and you turned on the headlights, the beam would jump ahead at exactly the speed of light, no more, no less.

eyVnSFnFaa	In order to answer your question you must first know the chemical reaction that takes place..<br>  So i guess that the reaction in the first example is<br>  2H2O--->2H2+O2 (because H and O never forms in single bonds).<br>  So the reaction takes place like this:<br>  2moles of H2O decays in to 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2,<br>  So 10.5 moles of H2O decays in 10.5 moles of H2 and 5.25moles of O2.<br>  Now, if you convert 1mole of H2O in grams you would get (2xH=1.0079x2=) 2.0158 + (1xO=15.994)=18.0098. <br>  So 1 mole of H2O is 18.0098 gram=1mole of H2O<br>  so 10.5 moles is (10.5mole x 18.0098) / 1 = 189.1029 gram.<br>  And i think you would be able to do the next one yourself.<br>  Hope you learnt something :P|`|AA10067857	The Mole, abbreviated mol, is not complicated.  Simply think of it as a new unit of measurement, because that is indeed what it is.  Americans use inches, Europeans use metric, and chemists use moles.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately though a mol is not always the same amount of grams, or liters or whatever you may be converting from.  You mentioned you are specifically interested in grams so that's what i will focus on.<br>  <br>  Each element has a molar mass, they are easily found by looking at the periodic table.  When given the mass of a sample, it can easily be converted to moles by dividing your given number of grams, by the molar mass you find on your periodic table.<br>  <br>  For example, lets start with a  simple element, Hydrogen, represented by the letter H.  Hydrogen exists as a gas as freestanding element, but this does not matter, whether solid, liquid, gas, or whatever, if given grams you use this same method to convert into moles.<br>  <br>  Anyway back to Hydrogen, it exists as H2, but don't worry about why for now, has to do with BrINClHOF.  If given say...15g of Hydrogen how many moles do you have?<br>  <br>  To start write down your number of grams...15<br>  Next find your molar mass for the element....1<br>  Keep in mind your finding the number of moles of H2, so when you divide use 1+1 or 2 since there are two hydrogen atoms. <br>  You then divide, 15/2=7.5 moles of H2.<br>  <br>  When multiple elements are involved add their different molar masses together before you divide.<br>  20g of MgO will be 20g/ (24.31+16) = .496 mol MgO<br>  <br>  To go further you need whats called stoichiometry.<br>  Don't let the name scare you it is just means after you balance an equation the moles will equal each other depending on coefficients.<br>  <br>  In the example H2 +O2 ----> H2O, When balanced becomes<br>  2H2 +O2 ---> 2H2O<br>  <br>  You can see with the added coefficients when balanced that for every 2 moles of H2 in the reaction 2 moles of H2O will also exist,  When no coefficient is present it is one, so for every 1 mole of O2, 2 moles of H2 will exist, you can compare any through out the equation and find how many moles will exist of the others once one is found out.<br>  <br>  If given that 64g of O2 reacts with excess H2, meaning only that much O2 and however much H2 can react until the O2 is used up, how much Water will be formed in grams.<br>  <br>  Using what we have learned, 64 grams/32 =2 mol O2.<br>  2 moles of O2 x (1/2)=1  <--Here we use a molar ration, because there is one mole of O2 for every 2 moles of Water we know there are half as many moles of O2 as Water, so we multiply by one Half, this gives us the moles of Water.<br>  <br>  1 mol x 18g(molar mass of H2O)=18g of water.<br>  <br>  Your done!, all these steps can be reapplied to many problems. another questions ask.
DhLIo8nbaa	Yes it will be fine to use.  They are over the counter for a reason.  If they were really harmful then they would be behind the pharmacy counter and you would need a prescription for them.  Women get yeast infections some times and it is very itchy and uncomfortable and by the time you get to see a doctor some time it takes way too long.  I wold reccomend the Monistat one dose ovule that one is only one time and it seems to work the fastest.  For some reason any time I take antibiotics for anything I seem to get one, and it is pretty obvious that is what it is so I never see the point in going to the doctor for them to tell me something I already know.  You can also use vagasil cream to releave the itching immediately because the monistat takes a couple days to work.  But if the Monistat does not work within about a week or so then she should contact her doctor because that means that it is not a yeast infection and could be something more serious and she will then need an antibiotic.  If she is woried though then she could talk to the pharmacist when she buys it and ask them any questions she might have.|`|2rdIhvjtaa	Sure it's safe. I use them a couple times a year.

A car battery's WH rating is rarely stated, but one way to get there is from the "reserve capacity" rating, which is the amount of time it can provide 25 amps before the voltage drops below 10.5 volts. A largish car battery typically has a RC of about 2 hours. If we assume an average voltage of 11 volts through that period we get a total energy of 550 watt-hours. <br>  <br>  So to provide 16,000 watt-hours you'd need about 30 batteries.  And this doesn't account for losses in the inverter.  Call it 40 batteries. <br>  <br>  This doesn't seem practical. <br>  <br>  Indeed, a gasoline-powered generator is a much more practical solution.

YrOTZsjtaa	When an object follows a circular path, a centripetal acceleration occurs. When the car reaches the top of the arc, its weight acts directly downward and the normal force directly upward.

M6AySVxOaa	Elodea is flowering plant that lives in the water. If you place a leaf on a slide you will be able to see the cell wall, a nucleus (if stained), and some chloroplast concentrate along the out side of the cell. If you are lucky you may even see the little green footballs we call chloroplast streaming around in the cell. In the center of the cell it should be clear. The clear area of the cell is the vacuole, the cell membrane is so thin you will not be able to see it but it is there next to the thick cell wall. If you apply salt water to the elodea cell you are changing the normal isotonic(balanced) relationship of the water outside the cell and inside the cell. The addition of salt to water causes the water concentration to diminish but the solute(salt) to increase. Since in this condition more water molecules are passing out of cell than into the cell the cell membrane and vacuoles membrane began to shrink (dehydration). You then may see a little irregular ball composes of things inside the cell membrane as the cell dies. This process is known as osmosis and osmosis always takes place when water pass from a high concentration (in this case, inside the cell)through a membrane to the out side where the low concentration of water of salt water exists.|`|J6Ksn0P7aa	Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.  Basically water follows salt until the concentration is equal on both sides of the cell membrane.<br>  When you add the salt water to the slide you are introducing solutes (salt) into the water surrounding the leaf.  The salt can not get in the cell membrane, so the water goes out.  The area outside of the leaf has high concentration of salt and the area inside of the leaf has a low concentration of salt.  When the water leaves the cell it looks different because the water in the cell helps it be full and happy :)|`|G9EJuDyGaa	I'm sure this was discussed in class.  Do your own homework, hun.

D6dnVzChaa	Embalming does not prevent decomposition. <br>  <br>  There are numerous factors that affect the rate of decomposition after embalming.<br>  <br>  To name a few factors:<br>  How well they were embalmed.<br>  <br>  Depending on medications that the deceased person was taking, can adversely affect the embalming fluid.<br>  <br>  Type of casket, or vault.<br>  <br>  The climate conditions and soil conditions. <br>  <br>  The cold also aids in slowing down the decomposition process.<br>  <br>  Embalming delays the decomposition process.

TBVrxEv7aa	There are three main plate tectonic environments: extensional, transform, and compressional. Plate boundaries in different localities are subject to different inter-plate stresses, producing either earthquake and/or  volcanic activity.<br>  There is no specific type of plate movements which cause only volcanoes or only earthquakes.However, many of the earthquakes  are located in the areas where plates collide (compressional) or try to slide past each other(transform). <br>  Volcanic activities occur frequently at areas of plate boundaries. Plate tectonics causes movement in the plates and crust, resulting in cracks being formed. These cracks allows the pressure underneath the crust to push the magma, or sometimes water and steam, up the crust.<br>  I understand formation of cracks from mantle to crust is required for any volcanic activity to occur. where this does not happen we get only earthquake. Sometime volcanic activity is accompanied by earthquake which are generally localized. <br>  Why only earthquake and not volcanism or vice versa is not  well understood, at least there is no unanimous conclusion.  It is mostly agreed upon that both earthquakes and volcanic activity are linked, not necessarily as cause and effect but as two different symptoms of changes in magma flows and temperatures in a given location.  Both appear to be related to either changing tectonic or magma conditions.

DO1ebm95aa	An ounce weighs an ounce.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to actually be witty, ask whether a kilogram of lead weighs more than a kilogram of copper as weighed at standard temperature and pressure (STP).  The answer is that the lead has a greater downward force because it has a smaller buoyant force from the atmosphere, and therefore weighs slightly more (measured in newtons), even though their masses (measured in kilograms) are equal.  Or ask whether an ounce of gold weighs more than an ounce of feathers, since one is weighed in the Troy system and the other in the English system.  Then You'll get some witty answers.  But the way you've formulated it, it's a pretty boring answer.|`|XxBQ1x7zaa	They're the same because they're both an ounce...which happens to be unit of weight measurement.|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	ha ha trick question!<br>  <br>  They weigh the same!!! :)|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Ounce copper, ounce lead same weight, ounce gold heavier though, precious metals use troy weight have 480 grains ounce, other metal use avoirdupois weight have 437.5 grain ounce.

SvmZlLdaaa	Both are solitary members of the cat family, Felidae, and both belong to the genus Panthera. If you don't count size, all felid species have a remarkably similar body plan. Scale up a domestic cat, and you basically have a leopard or tiger - scale down a tiger and you have an ocelot or a margay. The reason is that they have numerous features that make them very efficient predators - strong, shortened jaws, large canine teeth, claws that are kept sharp by being retractile (except in the case of the cheetah, whose claws are only semi-retractile), etc. These features are shared by all cats because all cats are predators. The felids have taken a successful design and produced a number of species in a number of sizes to take advantage of various different prey animals.<br>  <br>  The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family, weighing up to 660lb. It is found exclusively in Asia, and has a distinctive orange coat with vertical black stripes.

White tigers, which have blue eyes and white as the background coat colour instead of orange, are caused by a genetic condition called leucism, which results in reduced pigmentation. Black leopards are caused by a condition called melanism, which is an excess of the dark pigment melanin, resulting in an almost totally black coat (the markings will still show up against the background in certain lights). Black leopards like these are often called black panthers, or just panthers - indeed, some people do not realise that a panther is just a black leopard, thinking it to be a separate species.<br>  <br>  White tiger:<br>  <a href="http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh85/..." rel="nofollow">http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh85/...</a><br>  <br>  Melanistic leopard (panther):<br>  <a href="http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview..." rel="nofollow">http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...</a><br>  <br>  Pats!!! - leopards are found in Asia as well as Africa, and tigers do not have a mane.

k5Ece8BTaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Execpt on Mars there aren't no earthquakes Mars being smaller than Earth and lacking a large moon to stir up the inner part through tidal effect, its inner core had more opportunity for colling down. As a consequence, its surface is no longer very geologically active, and as a consequence, there are no plate tectonics moving around. Faults between moving plates and subduction zones are at the source of quakes; and Mars is essentially lacking that activity and those features.<br>  <br>  And Venus?<br>  <br>  Well, we assume earthquakes are on Venus, but we aren't sure <br>  <br>  And gas planets don't have quakes.

qEET2iA6aa	Pluto being the furthest planet (well, former planet) from the sun is extremely cold. The temperatures on its surface range between -396°F to -378°F (-238°C to -228°C). That being said you'd have to expect life to be unlike anything witnessed on Earth. However, if life on Earth 'was' any indication to what you would see on Pluto, you'd expect a land dwelling life form to be extremely well insulated whether by fur, fat, or something completely unfathomable. Like some fish on earth, species on Pluto may have a special protein in their blood which acts like anti-freeze to help them survive very cold temperatures. If there was life similar to what we have here though, its a lot more probable that it would live underground closer to the core of Pluto where it would be warmer. <br>  <br>  It is a lot more likely though that on the off-chance that Pluto did have life that it would be a simple form, like a single celled organism or bacteria. Bacteria has been known to thrive in extreme conditions on Earth where life originally was thought impossible to exist.|`|NMAfFeNcaa	this is a highly theoretical answer. if life on Pluto existed. then it would be like a marine creature, because scientists think there could be liquid material under the surface of Pluto, (liquid nitrogen maybe). so it would be highly aquatic and it would have skin with a really low thermal conductivity (for insulation).|`|dhJbBVjyaa	It would most likely be bacterial as there would not be enough energy in the system to support anything very large.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	They would look, move, and live just exactly like Plutonians.<br>  <br>  Doug
ADDEKw29aa	Ok so u start with:<br>  Mg+Fe(NO3)2<br>  as your reactants<br>  You need to be able to identify this equation as single replacement from this point<br>  Since it is single replacement, I know that the single material(Mg) will bully off either Fe or NO3<br>  I also know that Mg can only form 2+ ions since it is in group 2 on the periodic table which is a positive ion like Fe, therefore Mg can only bully off other positive ions like Fe.<br>  <br>  Now, for single replacement reactions, we always must first check if the reaction will occur by checking our activity series chart. <br>  If Mg is higher on the chart than Fe, then a reaction will occur and Mg will bully off Fe.<br>  However, if Mg is lower on the chart than Fe, then no reaction will occur.<br>  If you check this chart you will see that Mg is indeed higher up on the chart than is Fe, so the reaction will take place.<br>  So the equation must be:<br>  Mg+Fe(NO3)2 --> Fe+Mg(NO3)2<br>  and it is already balanced.

It remained opaque until the first stars began to ionize the gas that filled the universe.  (Google 'cosmic dark age' to find more complete explanations of this.)<br>  <br>  This means that there is an actual physical limit to how far away we can look:  there will be no light to detect at some point because light did not yet exist and/or could not yet penetrate the opaque universe.<br>  <br>  Given that we have imaged galaxies at 13 and 13.2 billion light years distance, we are probably fairly close to that limit now.|`|AA10222010	We've been able to "see" galaxies at a range of about 13.7-billion light years.

8891f12e3b80bcc7c7aec7f94acdb8ccaa	You need two numbers, and their sum is 20, so you could call the first one x, and the second one (20-x). Any two numbers, x and 20-x will satisfy that first condition.<br>  <br>  Then you can set up the equation:<br>  f(x) = x^2 + (20-x)^2, and then try finding the minimum. This is fairly easy to do with calculus, but you mentioned algebra 2, so it's a question of thinking about what numbers will do when they are squared. <br>  <br>  At one end, you have 1 and 19. The sum of their squares would be 1+ 361=362.  As x and 20-x approach each other, the sums of their squares get smaller. 5^2 + 15^2 = 25 + 225 = 250.<br>  <br>  Reasoning in this manner, the smaller the difference between the two numbers, the lower the sum of their squares. So we should ideally use 10 and 10. If you need two different numbers, you would be trying to do something like 10.00000000000....1 and 9.99999999999.... as far as you can go.

YmNi3uL4aa	Are you asking for plasmid isolation protocols, or for protocols to isolate genomic DNA from cells?<br>  Heating and the use of lysis buffers are necessary to break open the cells you want to isolate the DNA from. Homogenization is necessary to mix the cells thoroughly with the lysis buffers. Filtration over a column is often not really filtration (esp. in genomic DNA isolation), but ion-exchange. It will retain the DNA but all other compounds (membranes, proteins, carbohydrates) will flow through. In plasmid isolation, there is often a filtering step to filter away the precipitated non-DNA compounds.<br>  <br>  The addition of ice cold ethanol is not necessary. It was done in the 70ies and 80ies (and I have done it myself) but currently it is believed that opening a bottle of ice cold ethanol will actually attract so much water (look at the condensation on the outside of the bottle!) that the concentration of ethanol will go down. In most protocols it is sufficient to add ethanol and then perform the precipitation at -20. At that stage the concentration of ethanol is around 70% so attracting water is not going to be much of a problem.

SIhxrxD3aa	Veterinarian is the only job that works with animals that pays well.  You can work with animals in other ways, but you wouldn't make much at all.  Veterinary technicians only go to school for 2 years, and their is a big demand for techs right now.  However, they only make about $40,000/year on average, just out of school you'd only be aking about $25,000.  Even those with a lot of experience don't make over $50,000.  You could be a groomer or trainer with very little education, but again, you wouldn't be making much at all.  One option is to get a business degree and start your own business.  Doggie day cares are very big right now.  Animal photographers are also doing well now because more people are wanting professional pictures of their pets.  So, there are some options if you get creative.<br>  <br>  Veterinarians do need to go to school for 6-8 years.  And even after that, it is a lifetime of learning.  It's also a lot of math and science, and you would be required to at least learn to perform surgery.  There are veterinary specialties that do not perform surgery, but that's an even longer path.<br>  <br>  One thing you can do when you are old enough is go shadow at a vet's office.  Most vets allow students interested in the field to come hang out and see what it's like.  You could observe surgeries and get a feel for whether that's something you could do or not.<br>  <br>  Vet school is extremely competitive.  It's very hard to get a spot in a veterinary program.  But, once you do that, after graduation finding a job is very easy since there is shortage of veterinarians.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	You'd be smart to take lots of biology classes now while you're in high school. Chemistry would be good to have as well. Why don't you do some volunteer work for an animal shelter, you'll gain lots of insight and experience.<br>  <br>  You would need to go to a veterinary college after high school and you could specialize in small animals as opposed to large ones. Once you finish your schooling (and there is a lot of it) you should not have a problem finding a job, you could even open your own clinic if you chose to.<br>  <br>  You could do a two year veterinary technician program but the pay won't be nearly as good.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you are successful!|`|zrKuaiDLaa	My dad is a vet! If I were you I would see if your high school has a program like this. My sister is a ton like you! (from your description of being a vet) Anyways, my sister participates in a program called: Zoo School. She spends her afternoon at the zoo feeding, cleaning, learning, etc. about the animals. She covers math and science with this! She LOVES it! I would suggest just getting some information and trying it out. I don't really know much about the whole job thing, but I hope my other information helped!
AA11824362	It is never too late. You don't need to get a PhD, an MS in Geology would suffice. I only had to take up to Calculus II, but in a few of my Graduate Level classes, there were topics about which I didn't have the math to fully understand. I just talked with my professors and everything was fine. Since you already have an MBA (I assume), in route to your MS you will need to take all the undergraduate classes you need for a BS in Geology. This includes Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and required undergraduate Geology classes. Good luck on your endeavors!|`|RvYipnBZaa	I couldn't agree more with the answer that was first given.  I also would like to add that I am a geology grad, and one of the most influential professors I had going through school was a non-traditional student himself and had just defended his phd and started teaching at the age of 39.  His students would have been lost without him.  If geoscience is where your passion for learning leads please follow it!

You can most definitely see the center of the Milky Way Galaxy from the Earth if you know where when to look.<br>  <br>  Paste of a previous 2012 response:<br>  <br>  The Aztecs conquered the Mayans and absorbed the Mayan culture. There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round.

It doesn't say that there IS any energy now, it says IF there is energy it will be disrupted.<br>  But I question that as well - why will any energy coming from the galactic centre be disrupted?  How could the sun, 150 million kilometers from Earth and EXTREMELY tiny compared to the galactic centre, affect any energy coming from the galactic centre (which we can't detect anyway so its irrelevant).<br>  <br>  The 12/21/2012 at 11:11 is valid information - that is the UTC time of the winter solstice.

Not very likely though.|`|CCeRdaoLaa	To be honest, no one knows.  <br>  <br>  The 2012 junk is all just another doomsday fad (everyone always forgets about them when they've come and gone, like in 2003, 2000, and countless times before then).  It's all based on the Mayan calendar... but the Mayans never predicted that the world would end in 2012!  They had 2 calendars: a yearly one, and a 5000-year one.  The 5000 year one is ending in 2012, but there was no prediction at the end of it!  They simply didn't get around to planning out the next cycle before their culture collapsed.  To claim that this is the end of the world is like looking at the calendar on your wall and saying "Oh no!  There's nothing after December 31, 2009!  That must mean the world is going to end!"  All of the "predictions" attached to 2012 are complete nonsense or twisted pseudoscience.  Trust me when I say that there is absolutely no reason to think that 2012 will be more dangerous than any other year.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that we're safe, though.  Now that many nations have nuclear capabilities, we're always at risk of death by nuclear war.  There's also the threat of natural events (asteroid impact, nearby supernova, etc), though most of them are so unlikely that we don't really have to worry about them.  Despite what the doomsdayers might claim, there are no credible scientists who think that any of these will happen in 2012.<br>  <br>  Humanity's extinction is inevitable, though.  If we do survive, then evolution will eventually take its toll.  We will evolve into something else.  It may happen in tiny steps over millions of years, and whatever we evolve into may be just as intelligent (or moreso), but the form we have now will be left behind, just like every other species in our branch of the evolutionary tree.<br>  <br>  I've attached a link to a book called Death From the Skies! by Phil Plait.  It details 9 different *plausible* (i.e. science and reality-based)  ways that life on Earth could be wiped out, but also explains the odds of it happening (so it's not nearly as scary as the title suggests).  It's all written in a way that the average person can understand, too (without oversimplifying it), and it's wonderfully entertaining.  I know very little about astronomy and physics, and I was able to follow it just fine.  I very highly recommend it.

Meanwhile brain comma takes years.|`|3bwTO2RIaa	If we medically induce "coma," meaning general anesthesia or deep sedation, it can be quite short (under an hour for a routine surgery for example), or it can be for several weeks (like in an ICU).   <br>  <br>  Generally, if someone is going to be sedated for a prolonged period of time, then we try to wake them up at least for a little while each day and give them "sedation holidays."   Usually the ICU nurse will turn off the infusion of sedative and stay with the patient.  We try to wake them while their families or friends are at the bedside.    Usually after a few weeks someone who is that critically ill will go one of two ways.  Either they turn around and improve, requiring progressively less sedation. Alternatively,  they will get progressively worse and either die, or have not enough brain function to be agitated, thus decreasing the need for sedation.<br>  <br>  As people come out of anesthesia, they are usually disoriented for a while.  Usually the nurses will help to reorient patients either in the ICU right after awakening, or in the "recovery room"  after surgery.

mjaMF5mIaa	These are the features of the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) Double Helix:<br>  <br>  1. It is formed by 2 strands that coil around each other to form a long twisted ladder<br>  2. Each strand of DNA is made up of repeated parts called nucleotides attached to each other by covalent bonds<br>  3. Each base (nucleotide) forms hydrogen bonds with the one directly opposite it, forming base pairs (also called nucleotide pairs) and forming the rungs of the ladder.<br>  4. The side of the ladder is formed by the backbone formed by alternating five-carbon sugar (pentose) and phosphate groups.<br>  5. There are four different bases that might be present: thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine. These four bases are the foundation of the genetic code. Sometimes represented as T, C, A, and G. These four nucleotides encode everything an organism needs to live and protects its genetic information with incredible accuracy.<br>  6.The side with the phosphate group is bonded to the 5' (5 prime) carbon atom of one pentose that is covalently bonded to the 3' (3 prime) carbon of the next phosphate <br>  7. The two strands run in opposite directions and are then "antiparallel"; that is, one strand runs 5' to 3' while the other runs 3' to 5'<br>  8.There is an average of 25 hydrogen bonds within each complete turn of the double helix providing a stability of binding about as strong as what a covalent bond would provide.<br>  9.

You might want to talk it over with your doctor if you are really having a tough time with it.|`|3Y8QkaMUaa	It can be many things actually and it's important you figure out what.   It is a medical condition related to autonomic nervous system function.  It's described as a "temporary glitch in the connection between the brain and the body during sleep".  My honest theory is many people who have this are not getting enough melatonin (which is made from seratonin).  You can take natural melatonin and see if it helps:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthproductsusa.net/30_melatonin_nano-plex_health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthproductsusa.net/30_mela...</a><br>  this brand is far safer than synthetics.<br>  <br>  Now, I do think lower astral entities and interdimensinals exist and I think when you're talking nightmares and figures nearby, you're usually looking at those types (unless you're under some kind of MKUltra mind control program).  You can deal with them by putting a crystal under your pillow or have some "orgonite" near by.  I haven't been plagued by nightmares or any of it for a decade now since I started to pay attention to "energetic hygiene".  <br>  <br>  And finally, there are some people on here who think energy isn't real and I find that silly.  Science has proven every feeling you have creates electromagnetic impulses that instantly shift your body chemistry.  Sleep paralysis when coupled with FEAR would create all kinds of uncontrolable muscle tension.  Make sure you stay hydrated and get lots of veggies and fruits for minerals.  Magnesium is also recommended, they also have it at the link I gave you.  <br>  <br>  Remember, fear generates energy.  This energy is food for lower astral parasites.  You don't have to believe me to know "fear is the mindkiller" just like in the movie Dune.  Good luck.|`|Wf8lTab6aa	Me and my brother both had this happen to us, i guess it is kinda common, but different people have different experiences i guess, some more frightening than others, my first experience scared the **** outta me and i thought the devil himself was in the room, i felt as though my soul was being sucked out of me and i couldn't move but i was conscious throughout the whole thing, yea it would happen to me when i was wide awake!

SvmZlLdaaa	Hippos kill more people than any other animal in Africa (with the exception of mosquitoes, which kill indirectly by transmitting the malaria parasite). They are extremely aggressive and territorial, and will attack anything that ventures into their stretch of river, including boats. When on land, they will run for the water if alarmed, and anything that gets in their way will be mown down, humans included. They seem to feel that attack is the best form of defence. In Kenya a few years ago, I heard a tale from a safari guide about an American woman who approached a grazing hippo, despite warnings of the danger, and tried to take its photo. The flash startled the animal, and its immediate response was to attack - the woman was bitten in half, literally.<br>  <br>  Lions, and other large predators, very rarely attack humans - it is usually only old or injured individuals who can no longer hunt their natural prey that turn to man-eating. Aside from this, the only time you really risk being attacked is if the animal thinks you are threatening its young, and even then most carnivores will first make mock-charges to warn you off - it's only if you don't take the hint that they attack in earnest.<br>  <br>  It is a little-known fact that herbivores kill more people than carnivores, world-wide, every year. Many people have the idea that, because something doesn't eat meat, it won't hurt them. This is often a fatal mistake. After hippos, the most dangerous animals in Africa are buffalo and elephants. All these animals are herbivores. Hippos look rather comical, buffalo resemble large cattle, a docile animal, and elephants are often portrayed on television as 'gentle giants' - these things can lead some people to think they can approach and even try to touch these animals in the wild. Several people every year are killed in this way. No-one would dream of going up to a wild leopard or lion and trying to touch it, even though the chances of injury are far less (leopards, lions and most other carnivores will run from humans on foot) - many people are simply uneducated about wildlife, and accord herbivores less respect than carnivores.|`|AA11673762	The mosquito is the most deadly animal in the world.|`|AZKbJESUaa	Just because a animal is a herbivore doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. People in Africa fear Elephant, Hippos, and Cape Buffalo more then lions. The Kids that have to walk miles to school walk past lions calmly, but freak when they walk past Elephant or Buffalo.  <br>  <br>  The reason Hippos are the most dangerous and most feared is because hippos kill more people in Africa then all the carnivores combined. Hippos are very territorial and will flip your boat and drown you in the water, stomp the crap out of you, or just bite down on you.  <br>  <br>  It is demeaning and arrogant just to assume Lions are more dangerous just because they are carnivores. I would rather walk past lions then swim with Hippos any day. <br>  <br>  In north America deer kill more people annually then any other animal.|`|D0i0RDmraa	Their really the most dangerous animal in Africa.They can reach a really fast speed despite it's size.In fact,there are more deaths caused by Hippos than Lions and Crocodiles placed together.Hippos over turn boats,their jaws can quite literally rip you in half.Hippos are really dangerous to be honest.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I like Justin C's answer. <br>  Hippos are extremely foul-tempered!

We are very "hands-on" at the sanctuary I work at, so I am no stranger to being in close quarters with large, potentially dangerous animals...but I wouldn't get too close to a hippo for all the money in the world! They kill more people each year than lions and rhinos combined.|`|4tFuosueaa	Hippos are considered the most dangerous because they are aggressive, they will attack a boat and turn it over. The don't eat people but they are extremely dangerous due to their size.|`|CJeufMTWaa	Because hippos are very aggressive and territorial.  They have been known to frequently attack humans.  Also, they mostly eat plants, but they occasionally eat meat.  I saw a hippo steal a zebra carcass from a crocodile on an animal planet show.  Lions are dangerous too, but I think hippos attack people more often.|`|ZBK8IbxEaa	it probably has something to do with the size of their teeth, and the fact that their skin isn't easily penetrated or something... well they're very territorial and, unlike lions, they attack almost always when something comes into their territory|`|c6606b7a2cc2afdc1c2b8b13026a7a9eaa	Actually the most dangerous animal in Africa or anywhere else for that matter is the one that is attacking you.|`|a7755f42f69cefa52515f7b509e000ceaa	Because they're HUGE and get angry really fast!

It requires chloroplasts in order to be able to create glucose from light energy and I'm not aware of yeast possessing any.<br>  <br>  Creation of ATP is a catabolic pathway- means it involves breaking down, not building up.  The ATP is released when certain bonds are broken. Creation of glucose is an anabolic pathway- it builds up and invests rather than releases energy to do so.<br>  <br>  Protein synthesis is also an anabolic process.<br>  <br>  Starch is a large molecule so logic would dictate that it would be broken down, not created by digestion.  Also, digestion suggests something catabolic, not anabolic- so nothing would be produced but broken down into smaller units. So starch would be broken down into units of sugars like glucose.<br>  <br>  CO2 is released by respiration.  That one is correct.<br>  <br>  I cannot see the diagram you're talking about but I hope this is helpful.
AA11824362	I am going to clear up a common misconception first: magma is molten (liquid) rock, and the mantle is solid. The mantle acts like a fluid, it is able to flow, due to the immense pressure exerted on the rocks. Heat generated by thermonuclear decay of radioactive elements (uranium, thorium and potassium) causes the mantle to convect, and lithospheric plates move in response to mantle convection. The is the mechanism set forth in Plate Tectonics Theory.

4J8X1aKkaa	The climate lends itself to a very distinct plant community (and consequently animal too).  Because they don't have constant downpours the soils are generally better than in traditional rain forests. The filtration of sunlight means the canopy doesn't have to grow as tall. The constant moisture means there's more mosses and epiphytes. Plants have to be specially adapted to getting water from fog vapors. In a rain forest the canopy is so thick little light reaches the floor, ergo there's little floor growth. But in a cloud forest the understory can be quite dense since the canopy is lower.<br>  <br>  If you want deeper information and have access to a university library, refer to academic journals for better scientific information - most internet info is rather general and tourism based.|`|2Y33uftwaa	there is a very distinct wet and dry season

AA11824362	The Ventura Basin was formed by a process known as transpression. The San Andreas Fault Zone is a transverse fault; also known as a strike-slip fault; but every strike-slip fault has a certain amount of dip-slip component in it. If that dip-slip component is normal faulting the transverse fault results in a transtensional fault, forming basins. A reverse dip-slip component results in a transpressional fault, forming mountains. I am not sure about the age of the Ventura Basin, but it probably formed within the last 10 million years.

91bhiXTVaa	In my MS thesis, I investigated the possibility that the most likely organisms to speciate sympatrically would be organisms of limited mobility, such as plant feeding invertebrates who rarely leave their host plant.  The model used was a treehopper, Enchenopa binotata, found on 9 host plants in the Eastern United States.   The adults are about 1/4 in. long, dark brown or black bugs with a "unicorn horn" and two tan spots on the back.  The young of the populations on each host plant have different appearances, for example, the young of the population on Black Locust plants are green and hairless, while the young of the population on Black Walnuts are fuzzy with "zebra stripes", thus the recognition that they are different species or in the process of speciation.  I haven't checked to see if they have been officially recognized as different species and given appropriate species names.<br>  <br>  The reason that they are considered likely candidates for sympatric speciation are:<br>  1) Limited mobility.  Though the adults can fly, they are not long distance fliers, they don't migrate or travel further than the surrounding trees.<br>  <br>  2) Host fidelity.  They prefer to feed on the plants they hatched on.  Experiments at the University of Delaware in association with the late Prof. Thomas K. Wood found that populations forced to lay eggs on new host plants suffered heavy mortality, but refused to lay eggs on the original when offered the chance, within 3 years after the switch.<br>  <br>  3) Egghatch is triggered by start of host plant sap flow in the Spring.  <br>  <br>  more later

OWtx0a8taa	Hey, Im not 100% sure on this one, but it may help. anyway, it takes 4.2KJ of energy to heat up one water molecule by one degree, and as it has a PH of 7/neutral, same as ethanol, it could be the same, so you would do the difference in temperature of 20.25 - 21.3, which is 1.05, and times it by the 4.2 which gives you 4.31KJ/molecule, again im not positive on this, but I hope it helps :)

luYtFLSUaa	Mass will be conserved. Start with 40 g and end up with 40g, however you will not get 40 g water. Hydrogen and oxygen react according to this balanced chemical equation<br>  <br>  2H2  +  O2  ----->  2H2O    That is, 2 moles of H2 will react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of H2O<br>  <br>  or put it another way - atoms do not react in any way you might desire - there are rules.<br>  <br>  THe above equation also says that 4 g H2 will react with 32g O2 to make 36 g H2O<br>  <br>  20 g H2 would require 32/4 X20 = 160 g O2  or<br>  20 g O2 would require 4/32 X 20 = 2.5 g H2<br>  <br>  Consider the last example. 2.5 g H2 would react with 20 g O2 and all O2 would be consumed in making water. The other Hydrogen (20-2.5 = 17.5 g) would be unreacted and left over.  the H2 and O2 that did react would make 22.5 g water - note: 22.5 + 17.5 left over = 40<br>  <br>  Doc|`|AA10067857	This seems to be a limiting reactant problem.  You need to find out which reactant will be used up first.  First convert the grams into moles.  20g of H2 is 20/2= 10 mol, and 20 g of oxygen is 20g/32=.625 mol 02.  From the equation 2H2+O2 --> 2H20 you can see that every 2 moles of Hydrogen will make 2 moles of Water.  Every 1 mole of Oxygen will make 2 moles of Water.  Oxygen is clearly the limiting reactant as we have 10 mol of H2 and not even one of O2.  To find mass of water produced, multiply the limiting reactant, O2, by the molar ratio 1:2, and then convert to grams.  .625 x (2/1) x 18g(molar mass of water) = 22.5g of water would be produced keeping to significant digits. Conservation of mass can not be used because both reactants will not be used up completely.  Extra Hydrogen will be left over.  Hope this helps, if i could type out the equations better it would look better, sorry.

YHNK9UrQaa	In everyday life, when something happens, it is usually difficult to say EXACTLY why that something happened. For example, if your house plant dies, you might think it died because you forgot to water it, or maybe it died because it didn’t get enough light, or maybe it died because it had the wrong soil, or maybe it died because your friend spilled hot tea into the soil when you weren’t looking. Usually, in everyday life, you can’t always be completely sure exactly why something happened because there are too many things that might be the cause. There are too many things going on.  There are too many "VARIABLES" that might have been the cause.<br>  <br>  In science, most experiments are “CONTROLLED”. Scientists usually put a “CONTROL” into their experiments to “CONTROL” the “VARIABLES”, so they can be more certain why a particular result happened, so they can be more certain that their results are dependable.<br>  <br>  Usually, a “CONTROL” involves setting up another nearly identical experiment where the only difference between the two experiments is the “VARIABLE” that you are testing.  (You can run the control experiment just before, just after, or at the same time as the main experiment).  That way, if you get a result in the main experiment, but not in the otherwise identical “CONTROL” experiment, you can say that the result was caused by the “VARIABLE” that you were testing, and not by some other incidental “VARIABLE”.<br>  <br>  In an experiment, the DEPENDENT VARIABLES are the things that change because of the INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. <br>  <br>  In your experiment, you are examining the properties of the enzyme CATALASE:  “Enzymes are proteins that speed up the rate of reactions that would otherwise happen more slowly. The enzyme is not altered by the reaction”.  Catalase “...  speeds up a reaction which breaks down hydrogen peroxide, a toxic chemical, into 2 harmless substances--water and oxygen”.  “... enzyme activity depends on the temperature, ionic conditions, and pH of the surroundings”.  <br>  <br>  Your lab consists of four activities: <br>  Observing normal catalase activity - catalase is reusable <br>  identifying tissues that contain catalase <br>  1. Measuring the Effect of Temperature on Catalase Activity <br>  2. Measuring the Effect of pH of Catalase Activity <br>  <br>  In your experiment, enzyme activity is the DEPENDENT VARIABLE, while temperature and pH are the INDEPENDENT VARIABLES.

1BeKAfS6aa	Probability is a main factor in genetics. For ex: If your mom has brown hair (hybrid) and your dad has blonde hair(recessive) the punnet square would be Bb x bb which gives u the possible offsspring of Bb ,Bb ,bb and bb. so u have a 50/50 shot at have blonde or brown hair. If a couplw with this same situation has 4 kids. Its not guarenteed that 2 will have brown hair and the other two will have blonde. A punnet square shows the options of pairs of alleles for a zygote. This goes along with the rule of independent assortment.<br>  a person can get dwarfism like this: <br>  <br>  <br>  1- Autosomal recessive trait--Both parents pass on a recessive gene and the trait is expressed in the offspring.<br>  <br>  2-Autosomal dominant trait--One (or both) parents pass on a dominant gene and the trait shows up in the offspring. The trait would have to be expressed in one of the parents or could be [caused by a new mutation (Crandall and Crosson 1993)]<br>  <br>  There are over 200 variations of dwarfism characteristics which have been cataloged and well described in humans alone. Most of the human dwarfism characteristics have been proven to be genetic in nature. In the dwarfed miniatures, most of these characteristics are recessively inherited (both the sire and the dam appeared to have normal conformation). Many of the scientifically identified characteristics have been researched individually
LqnWk9Ilaa	Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.<br>  <br>  Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. Aphids, slime molds, sea anemones, some species of starfish (by fragmentation), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.<br>  <br>  When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	The aphid does, along with many other animals. <br>  <br>  Humans do only sexual reproduction.

MMUGLjsPaa	Well, ...<br>  The light of an oncoming car analogy is just an example of the ability to gather light not see into the past or the future. Your friend with the scope was able to gather more light (with say an 80mm objective) than you could (with a pair of 7mm objectives - your eyeballs) and so he saw the car before you could.<br>  <br>  Consider our Sun for a moment.  It takes ~8 minutes for light to travel from the sun to our eyes.  So the image of the Sun (even if you are looking at it in a telescope) is an image that is ~8 minutes old.  If the sun at this very moment were to suddenly go dark you wouldn't (nor the world for that matter) perceive it for ~8 more minutes until the last photon  had streamed past your eyes. Since the light you currently perceive is ~8 minutes old then you are looking at the sun as it was ~8 minutes in the past not as it is now.<br>  <br>  When you look at an image of Mars the image you see is ~12.5 minutes old.  That is the time it takes for light to bounce off the surface of Mars and reach Earth. The light you now perceive is ~12.5 minutes old so essentially the Mars you are looking at is a Mars that is 12.5 minutes in the past!<br>  <br>  Now, let's go out to M31 the Andromeda Galaxy.  It's so bright that in some places you can see it without the aid of binoculars, yet it is ~2.5 million light years away. In other words light had to travel ~2.5 million years to get to our earth.  If you were standing on the earth were when M31 was only 2 million years old you would have to wait another 500,000 years before you could see it in the night sky above earth.   So when you look at the Andromeda galaxy tonight you don't see it as it exists tonight you are seeing it as it as it existed ~2.5 million years ago.  Essentially seeing into the past.<br>  <br>  We don't know what M31 looks like at this moment. We only know what it looked like ~2.5 million years ago. For all we know, it could have been completely consumed by it's central super massive back hole 2 million years ago but we won't know that for another 500,000 years.<br>  <br>  Yeah it's not an easy concept to get your head around but if you think on it a bit, it will come to you.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Your example about the car is true when very small distances (such as on Earth) are involved.<br>  But when you are talking about distances to objects in the universe, its a little different.<br>  <br>  Light takes time to travel huge distances.  <br>  For example, the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light years away - that means that the light we see today left there 2.5 million years ago.<br>  So what we are seeing today is the way that galaxy actually looked 2.5 million years ago.<br>  That's what is meant by seeing into the past.<br>  <br>  Even when we look at the sun we are really seeing it the way it was 8.3 minutes ago - it took the light we see right now 8.3 minutes to get from the sun to our eyes.|`|M5NtAkfvaa	It's because the light travels and it takes time for it to get to Earth. So things change over time, but we see it as it was because the light it just hitting us. For example you have another galaxy, and it takes a very long time (not sure exactly how long) for it to get to Earth. When we finally get the light, thats how we see it, but because the galaxy may have changed during the time, we'll have to wait another "x" amount of time to see the change cause we're waiting for the light to get to us. For example, I think it takes 7 minutes for the light from The Sun to get to Earth. (Don't do this, it will damage your eyes), but when we get the light from the Sun here on Earth, it is 7 minutes old, so that's how the Sun WAS 7 minutes ago, even though the Sun looks the same all over if you look at it (again don't do it, it will damage your eyes) you're looking at the Sun how it was 7 minutes ago. Therefore we're looking at the past!! Same goes with galaxies, etc.|`|luYtFLSUaa	You may be a little mixed up here. Distant galaxies move away from us and are many many light years away - say 1000000 light years - that means that any light we see from them tonight left them 1000000 years ago, so we see them as they were, not as they are.  The light we may see tonite could have left those galaxies before the Earth was born.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|yaq7oaH6aa	No, ....mostly.<br>  Yes, you can predict, based on what you see, but that's virtual not actual.<br>  (You predict in your mind, you might be wrong, it's not reality.<br>  Joe's car might stop or turn off before it gets to him.)<br>  What you see occurred in the past. The farther away it happened, <br>  the older the news you get.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	No.  You have no idea at all what you're talking about, but I'll try to explain it.<br>  <br>  It takes light (moving at 300,000,000 meters per second) about 4 years to arrive here from the closest star.  So you're not seeing what the star is like at this exact instant, you're seeing it as it looked 4 years ago.<br>  And the further away from Earth we look, the greater that effect becomes.<br>  <br>  Doug

2lQ8DJAcaa	Just as we are happier and healthier when we receive adequate sunlight, so are the plants and vegetation that we grow. Sunlight, or other means of artificial lighting is essential to help a plant grow into maturity. It is also necessary in aiding the plant to get the nutrients it requires to mature into a strong healthy plant. <br>  The process of the sun or other light helping to feed the plant is called photosynthesis. The light acts as an energy source to help the plant separate carbohydrates from carbondioxide. Moisture mixes with this and turns into a glucose and feeds the plant. The plant in turn releases oxygen into the air to make the air we breath cleaner. <br>  The amount of light the plant receives will drastically affect it's growth cycle, as it is being deprived of the ingredients necessary to feed itself.<br>  Some plants have a healthier appetite and require more light than others, to continue to grow and stay healthy.

DAMZKbpDaa	Mosquito population varies depending on several factors, the most important being the amount of rain. In a drier than normal year, there are less than normal mosquitoes. Some mosquitoes lay eggs that stay viable for years, so a strong rain can bring a "flood" of mosquitoes.<br>  <br>  Maybe that is what happened the last few years?|`|OFFjKX72aa	Hm.

May God be with you and the rest of your fellow Aussies.|`|AZKbJESUaa	from what I hear Australia is going through another year of serious drought, and are even filtering ocean water to drink.  <br>  <br>  Mosquitoes need water to lay eggs on. That is why there is always more Mosquitoes at the cottage by the lake then at your house in the desert. It may be the drought and lack of water causing low Mosquito populations.  <br>   <br>  Global warming is supposed to be helping Mosquitoes in the sense that they are able to reach higher altitudes then they ever have been before.

So we don't want B or C.<br>  <br>  But of course the problem doesn't show us any definite amounts for those two teams, so we're going to have to find them in terms of A.<br>  <br>  And we can do that from the equations we have.<br>  <br>  Since A=B+8,<br>  we know that<br>  B=A-8<br>  ...correct?<br>  <br>  And since C= 2*B,<br>  and B is A-8,<br>  C is basically 2 * (A-8),<br>  which, if you use the distributive property, is<br>  C=2(A) - 2(8),<br>  which means that C=2(A) - 16<br>  <br>  And since you know that A+B+C is 72,<br>  you can just plug in your values for B and C in terms of A.<br>  <br>  So now you have, instead of A+B+C=72,<br>  A+ (A-8) + 2(A) - 16=72<br>  And of course those two equations are the same exact thing.<br>  <br>  And now you can finally solve for A.<br>  <br>  Keep all the variables on one side.<br>  <br>  A + (A-8) + 2(A) = 72 + 16 = 88<br>  <br>  So...now you can take off the parenthesis since everything outside parenthesis is positive (plus signs) anyway, so parenthesis or not makes no difference.<br>  <br>  A+A-8+2(A)=<br>  4(A)-8=88<br>  <br>  4(A)=96<br>  A=96/4<br>  A=24 pancakes.<br>  <br>  Yay!<br>  <br>  <br>  For the second problem, you know that if x is the number of hours it takes you to drive,<br>  then<br>  60x is greater or equal to 172<br>  So x is greater than or equal to 172/60<br>  <br>  You can reduce that fraction to 43/15.<br>  <br>  That number represents the number of hours it takes to drive, and if you multiply it by 60, you get the number of minutes it takes to drive.<br>  <br>  And you have to round UP, so it takes 172 minutes to drive.<br>  <br>  All you have to do now is track back from 11:45 172 minutes.<br>  <br>  That's 8:53, by the way.<br>  And sorry about how I made a big unneccessary loop in the middle of my exlanation, if anyone noticed lol. :)|`|NGf3l9Otaa	1) Let team A's amount of pancakes be represented as x+8, <br>  team b = x, and team c equal 2x  this means that 2x + x+ x+ 8 =72<br>  This means 4x + 8 equals 72<br>  Subtract the 8 from each side of the equation and you get 4x = 64<br>  Divide by 4 and you get x = 16     Since team A=x+8, that means it is 16 + 8 or simply 24.<br>  <br>  Team A made 24 pancakes<br>  <br>  2) divide the 172 miles by 60 and you get 2 hours and 52 minutes.

bYaRRLKjaa	In general, animal testing will be required to prove that the drug or device works safely as designed in animals before it is used in people (functionality testing). Animal testing will also be required in most cases to demonstrate biocompatibility - lack of immune response or tissue damage. <br>  <br>  Biocompatibility testing generally uses a mix of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, and cell culture techniques. Typical tests would include hemolysis (exposing the device to rabbit blood in a test tube and measuring how many blood cells are damaged), maximization sensitization (checking if guinea pigs develop an immune response to the device), cytotoxicity (putting the device in among growing cells in a dish and checking if the cells die), genotoxicity (checking whether bacteria exposed to the device develop genetic mutations), and implant studies (implanting the device in rats/etc. and examining the tissue a few weeks later to see how the body responded to the implant). <br>  <br>  Functionality testing varies depending on the type of drug or device, the number of similar devices already in use, and the anticipated safety risks posed by the material. A trivial device that isn't necessary to keep someone alive, like a catheter made from a plastic with a long history of safe use, might not need to be tested in animals at all, while a new, complex device that is necessary for survival, like a pacemaker or artificial heart, would require years of testing in many animals before being tested in humans. <br>  <br>  Animal research is based on the three r's : reduce, refine, replace. Every effort is made to use the minimum number of animals required for statistically significan results, to design the studies as carefully as possible to minimize animal suffering, and to replace animal models with non-animal testing where possible. Unfortunately, since we are such complex creations, cell culture techniques and computer simulations are of limited value in determining how a complex device will behave in the complex human body. Animal testing will therefore be around for a long time to come.|`|AA11570236	Its difficult to find people to willingly test drugs.Imagine how many people are needed to test drugs.Drugs are made from chemicals.<br>  they have many side affects.How many people are willing to being <br>  the Guinea pig.There not standing in line.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	First off I'm not for animal testing, I am against it.

Animal's bodies react differently to substances than ours do. Take chocolate, for example. It has the ability to kill a dog, but has no adverse affects on us.

This way, scientists can test their genetic theories in less time than with a long-lived animal that has a slow reproductive rate.  <br>  <br>  I'm not giving an opinion one way or the other- just trying to answer your question objectively (which, I imagine, is the point of your debate).|`|qkuMPSczaa	as many ppl have said, there is no risk to humans if things are tested on animals.

HxXduL1maa	Everything we know about Uranus comes from looking through a telescope. Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, has ever made a close flyby of the planet. Astronomers suspect there is lots of water on Uranus. Since they've never actually sampled the surface of the planet, how could they know?<br>  <br>  It all comes down to density.The density of Uranus is the second least in the Solar System, after Saturn. In fact, it has a density that's only a little higher than water. Since water is very common in the outer Solar System, astronomers suspect that the whole planet is made of mostly water. But it's not like any water you've ever seen.<br>  <br>  The temperature at the cloud tops of Uranus is 57 K (-357 F), and that temperature increases as you go down at a very predictable rate. It's believed that the temperature at the center of Uranus is about 5,000 K. Liquid water can't survive those kinds of temperatures without boiling away, unless you hold it under huge pressure. The water should be a vapor, but the heat and pressure turns it into a superheated liquid.|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	Simply put, you can't...Uranus is an ice giant...No liquid water, no surface to grow on...You can't get blood from a turnip...<br>  <br>  Your project may as well be finding a way to get water and grow food on the Sun|`|bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	The "water" that exists on Uranus is ultra-dense "slush" that is mixed with various toxic substances such as ammonia and methane. Furthermore, after descending thousands of miles down through the clouds, you would find yourself crushed by the immense pressure by the time you found Uranus's "ocean" -- which would be very hot as well.<br>  <br>  You would have better luck mining water from one of Uranus's satellites. At the cold temperature you would need a powerful jackhammer to get pieces of water ice from the ground, as water ice is as hard as granite at 86 degrees Kelvin.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi.

CCeRdaoLaa	It's better to think of evolution as a branching tree, rather than a ladder.  This is because evolution branches out, rather than following a set course.  It's sometimes hard to wrap your head around, since it goes against many different cultural beliefs - humans aren't the apex of life.  Sure, we have intelligence somewhat beyond that of animals (though many animals are much smarter than we give them credit for), but we're still just organisms, and we follow the same biological rules that all life does.<br>  <br>  Take, for example, the fact that all apes, humans included, once shared a common ancestor.  At some point, different groups of that ancestor became separated, and went down different evolutionary pathways.  One of those groups would live on the savannas, and eventually evolve into humans.  The other group remained in the forests and evolved into chimpanzees.  They took different pathways because they lived in different environments.<br>  <br>  Another way to put it is that the common ancestor of humans and chimps was very different from both humans and chimps.  What we know as a modern chimp never existed between our ancestor and humans - since chimps are on a totally different branch of the evolutionary tree.<br>  <br>  All the animals alive today exist on their own branches of the evolutionary tree - they aren't "un-evolved" intermediates below humanity.  In fact, assuming that we don't go extinct, humans are simply another intermediate species between what we were and what we may evolve into in the far future.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	So, when you were born did your parents cease to exist?<br>  <br>  Why not?|`|AA11513203	No.  Why?<br>  <br>  What is your understanding of "macroevolution" that would imply that every living thing should turn into the same thing?|`|9d3ce70fe723c76264a9f283d685bce2aa	Not every living thing lives in the same environment.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be very good in the ocean, and a dolphin wouldn't be very good in Missouri.<br>  <br>  If all the life evolved to live on land, the huge empty ocean would be like a buffet for something that was getting crowded off the land.

6rmLrZoEaa	I was asked this same question fro Biology; I figured it out so here is the answer: (The definition of life-history patter is: an organism's pattern of reproduction; may be rapid or slow (short or long). <br>  <br>  Short (rapid) life-history patterns are common among organisms from changeable environments. Rapid life-history organisms have a small body size, mature quickly, reproduce early, and have a short life span. Long (short) life-history patterns are large species that live in more stable environments that usually have slow life-history patterns. Elephants, bears, whales, humans, and plants, such as trees are long lived. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!

mCAWxobNaa	Most of the pain/discomfort associated with HSGs is because the uterus is literally trying to "push out" all the radiocontrast (omnipaque) that's used to demonstrat spill from each fallopian tubes in addition to the contour of the uterine cavity.  Now, the uterine cavity fills ups with a relatively small volume of the contrast.  But in response, the uterus will contract and it'll feel like bad menstrual cramping.  If you have no contraindications, normal renal function, often patients going for an HSG are advised to take ibuprofen 200 mg (Advil, Motrin, etc.) before and then after the procedure.  Most patients are much more nervous than they need to be, frankly.  It's normal to have some bleeding after the procedure but you should be fine later in the day.<br>  <br>  So basically, you can expect it to feel like menstrual cramps but the ibuprofen is quite helpful for most patients.<br>  <br>  I wish you very well for the exam.
CjJKUMl8aa	Alveoli has many blood capillaries, moist, and one cell thick enable oxygen to easily diffused from alveoli to the blood capillary. When Oxygen was breath in. Oxygen binds with haemoglobin to become oxyhaemoglobin. Then, when reach muscle cells, it gives oxygen gas to myoglobin following Bohr effect. <br>  <br>  Extra information:<br>  Partial pressure increase and pH is reduction affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. Dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin increases and oxygen is released to respiring tissue. The oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the right.<br>   <br>  Then, exchange between myoglobin with haemoglobin was carbon dioxide. Not all the volume of carbon dioxide is taken by haemoglobin. 5% carried in physical solution, small amount carbonic acid.10% combine with NH2 to become carbaminohaemoglobin. Then, 85% transported in form of hydrogencarbonate ions. Then, when the carbaminohaemoglobin goes back to alveoli. It diffused from haemoglobin to alveoli. Then, later breath out.

SG2UCUmpaa	Okay! Firstly, I want to ensure you realize that Warfarin is a drug that is taken to prevent clot formation in your body and that this will prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or strokes from occurring. So, it is necessary to take your tablets. To answer your question, you could wait until later to take your Warfarin even as far as 10pm or 12pm. However, I would recommend not leaving it any later than that. Warfarin stays in your body for a long time (which is a good thing), but high levels are needed for it to function and that is why it is recommended to be taken at the same time every day. You could even change your time of dosing if you wanted to later if you wanted to always take it just before bedtime, for example, if that were more convenient. Please don't miss a dose, though! Hope this helps!|`|EN32vSsCaa	If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day.  Do not double up the next dose.  If you are unable to take the missed dose, inform your Physician as soon as possible.

qozdiWpIaa	The raining and thunder shows a larger development of weather activity near your residence/ or office as the case may be. The clouds and thier development may be such strong that a series of nearby thunder might have occurred and their nearness caused the longer and loud spell of thunder. It is not a wonder but a possible fact of thunder and thunderclouds.|`|HUWW6UJwaa	That means the thunder is close to you. Sound wave dissipate the further they get away form its source thunder is very loud and what you were hearing is the reverb of the thunder bouncing off things but the closer you are to the source the longer its takes for the sound to dissipate|`|xVPdciIaaa	The reason the thunder was so long is that the lightning that created the thunder was moving sideways. If lightning travels vertically you're getting sound from the top to the bottom from one distance. It would take a small amount of time for the higher sound waves to reach you, so the thunder may last a short period of time. But if it were moving cloud-to-cloud the closer part of the lightning would make sound sooner. After the close part sounds the part farther away would begin to reach you. Since it was farther away it would take more time. Long thunder means cloud-to-cloud strike, short means a cloud-to-ground strike.

Atm74ULtaa	Genesis is right, you seem to be missing a key piece of information, such as the mass of CaCO3 that you are dealing with. So, lets assume that you have 150 grams of CaCO3 and you are being asked how many moles of CaCO3 you have.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to figure out is the molar mass of CaCO3 and you do this with the help of a periodic table. Using a periodic table, you look up the atomic mass of all the atoms in the compound that you are dealing with, which in this case CaCO3. So, you have one calcium atom (Ca), one carbon atom (C), and three oxygen atoms. According to the periodic table, the atomic mass of calcium is 40, the atomic mass of carbon is 12, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Keep in mind that you have three oxygen atoms and so you have to multiply 16 by 3, which gives you 48. If you add 40 + 12 + 48 you get 100 and so the molar mass of CaCO3 is 100. This is often written as...<br>  <br>  CaCO3 = 100 grams/mole<br>  <br>  Now, assuming you have 150 grams of CaCO3, you can calculate how many moles of CaCO3 you have by dividing the mass of CaCO3 by the molar mass of CaCO3, like this...<br>  <br>  150 grams / 100 grams/mole = 1.5 moles<br>  <br>  I hope that you like this answer. If so, please vote for it as the "Best Answer". As you may have noticed, most of my answers include a detailed explanation, so that the person who asked the question can learn from it. This takes more time to write, but is certainly worth it from an educational point of view.<br>  <br>  -- EXTRA INFORMATION BELOW --<br>  <br>  Now that you have added more information, namely the mass of CaCO3 that we are dealing with, your question can be answered properly.<br>  <br>  So, the initial mass of the chalk was 30.6 grams and the final mass was 13.8 grams. Therefore, you used up 16.8 grams of CaCO3 by spelling your name.  (30.6 g - 13.8 g = 16.8 g)<br>  <br>  To find the number of moles that this represents you do the exact same calculation that I showed you previously.<br>  <br>  16.8 grams / 100 grams/mole =  0.168 moles<br>  <br>  Once again, I hope that you like this answer. If so, please vote for it as the "Best Answer". As you may have noticed, most of my answers include a detailed explanation, so that the person who asked the question can learn from it. This takes more time to write, but is certainly worth it from an educational point of view.|`|NzCgZILtaa	Actually, if you're given just that, then you assume that it is one mole of the compound. If you want to know how many grams there are in one mole of that compound, you add up the molar mass of each element,<br>  Ca=40.08<br>  C=12.01<br>  0= 3(16.00) because there are three oxygen atoms<br>  so, you get 40.08+48.00+12.01<br>     = 88.08+12.01<br>     = 100.09g/mole<br>  If you want the number of particles you multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022x10^(23) particles/mole)|`|NQdlEvz0aa	Hmm... not to sound rude, but I believe you may be missing some information here.<br>  <br>  Usually in stoicheometry (mole conversions), there is a specific weight, usually in grams, of substance you are converting.

How many grams would we have then?<br>  <br>  If we consider that the there are 100.09 grams to one Mole of CaCO3, then we can use Stoichiometry to find how many grams that would be. We get that number by taking the mass of each element and adding them together. Carbon is about 12, Calcium is around 40, and oxygen is 16(3)=48. Remember, when using Stoichiometry always put your units so that they cancel each other out.<br>  <br>  4 mol CaCO3 | 100.09 grams<br>  --------------------------------------...  = 400.36 grams in 4 moles of CaCO3.<br>  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\|1 mol CaCO3<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you out.

DhLIo8nbaa	Well im not sure what drug you use, but the only way to pass it is time.  You will probably get alot of answers on here giving you false hope of quick easy ways to pass them, but I can promice you that even trying them could probably get you in more trouble.  I am a drug and alcohol counselor and I have to urine test my clients on a regular basis.  The things that people usually try is drinking a ton of water which we can detect because your urine will be nothing but water and that basically shows your guilt.  When people take the niacin is just doesnt work.  Some people put bleach in your urine and we can detect that as well because it makes the test void and the stench of the bleah reaks the second you open the cup.  Also there are those over the counter meds that you can get at the vitamin stores and they do not work either.  The only way to really pass it is to put time between your last usage and taking the test.  you are in lick because the urine test is the shortest test so depending on the drug you are using it will all be different.  Marijuana is the longest in your system.  It takes about 10 days for it to come out of your urine.  As far as heroin and cocain it is about 5-7 days.  Methamphetamines is about the same.  Those are the main drugs but if you use something else the pleasee mail me and I can give you the length of time.  <br>  <br>  I will not sit here and lecture you on the dangers of drug use, but if you do need someone to talk to about it feel free to e mail me.  Good luck on passing your test.|`|WnlYQecTaa	It depends on if you are going to be observed while you fill the cup. If not being watched the best way is to substitute with some non-contaminated urine. If being observed you will have to flush out with coffee and water. you will need time for this, and, you don't want your urine to be clear cause the do a specific gravity test, if it is the same gravity as water they will kick it back as being altered, so you have to put a little color into your urine. they best way is to take alot of vitamins as you are drinking, before you pee into the cup you want to make sure you have at least 6 full bladder releases.|`|uAAwgeI2aa	depends what you did. <br>  drink more water than you think you can<br>  til you think youre gonna puke. constantly.<br>  and run alot.|`|luYtFLSUaa	stay off the street stuff~!  forever|`|voTyeJexaa	study|`|2rdIhvjtaa	I have done so by drinking at least a half gallon of water and peeing several times before the test. You can also google urine replacement and find a site that sells lab created clean urine. The smartest thing to do is to stop using drugs. I did that, too.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	Don't smoke the green stuff.
G3LpGWXbaa	Some aquarium pumps have inlet ports, and they are usually designed to be quiet.<br>  <br>  You could use a really cheap pump from Walmart. It would not have to have an inlet. You could place the pump inside a sealable plastic container. Drill three holes, one for the power cord, one for the pump outlet hose, and one for a hose coming from your gas source that will dangle free inside the container. Just seal the holes with some silicone and put the lid on.

648027ace1a4720fb2f2c005258439e1aa	If the magnet is swinging freely, then the magnet will rotate so that it will line up with the poles of the Earth (which is magnetized). The north end of the magnet will point towards the North Pole, and the south end of the magnet will point towards the South Pole.<br>  <br>  You can try this yourself, if you like; get a bar magnet, tie a string around it right around the middle, and hold the other end of the string between two fingers. You should be able to figure out from the magnet where north and south are on the Earth.<br>  <br>  This is exactly the principle that makes a compass work.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I had it backwards before, but I've edited my answer so it is now correct.|`|AA11148143	One end would point North.
