20090304154533AAP34Q9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What did your kids inherit from you...?	What did your kids inherit from you, that you really love?      I love that my 15yo daughter inherited my love of dance, music, clothes and my diverse taste in music and love for horror movies. Also her opinionated and crazy fun personality-I love debating things with her.      I love that my 5yo son inherited my protectiveness of his family, my energy, loves to dance and he loves writing lists.       I love that my 3yo is a mommas boy (I was a Mommy's girl), that he inherited my energy (actually he is too energetic for me lol), and my ability to laugh easily (anything makes us laugh) and love of reading.      My 4 week old inherited my love of sleep-wooo hoooo!!!       I love that all of them got my "asian eyes" (my husband is the one that has a chinese grandmother, but I'm the one that looks asian, and the kids all got my eyes hehe) they are mini Lea's.       What about YOU??
20090304154530AA5WjQs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Trouble with Fiance's daughter?	My fiance's daughter is 15 years old, 6'1" and about 220 lbs. The doctor said she could grow until she is 19 or so, but nothing is certain. I am 5'8" 140 lbs. and my wife is 5'2" 95 lbs. She gets the height from her real father side of the family and her grandmother on her mother's side (5'11")  Here biological father is 6'6".      Is she really going to grow until she is 19 ? She has started to develop an attitude and we recently had a situation where she got physical with my fiance and me. We have already contacted a school councilor just today and are arranging a session with a child psychologist. We have talked to her about everything and we are very involved in her school, personal life, etc.      But is she going to get physically taller ? My fiance is worried because her daughter has already shown us that she is stronger then both of us combined, which she proved to us recently in a disturbing situation. (I posted this not too long ago.  I am figuring out the INs and out of Yahoo Questions.  thanks for your understanding)      Thanks for your support.

I had sex for the first time 2 days after my period ended, we used a condom with spermicide but the condom fell off. We both determined that he was no longer inside me however, the condom did get stuck in me for a few seconds. (not deep) I recently noticed that I had symptoms of UTI. In addition I've had cramping, bloating, a little trace of blood in my urine and fatigue. I don't know if this all goes back to basic symptoms of UTI or what could be early signs of pregnancy. I'm scheduled for my period again in a little over a week.

I took a test in Feb. and there was a very faint positive  line I took another one and it was negative. Do you think that I could be pregnant or am I just gaining weight or something else?

20090304155812AA4124y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What on earth is going on with my babies poo? tmi?	My baby had diarrhea a week ago for 4 days. He then started vomiting every formula bottle he ate. So under my drs advice he had unflavored pedialyte only for 30 hours. He did not get dehydrated and he was able to keep his formula down after the 30 hours. But that was 2 days ago. since then he has had a couple mire bowel movements. Not often, they are regular frequency but they are so odd. There is white flecks in them my pediatrician told me is probably undigested formula powder. But the real worry I am having is that the stools are an army green color and grainy coated in a clearish yellow mucous type of fluid w/ the white flecks in that, not the actual poo. My dr for my son is a new 1 i have chosen due to insurance issues, so I have never actually met him yet. But he said this mucous fluid could be from teething.       does any body else know anything about this?
20090304155415AAGvMI1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Early pregnancy and found out my husband has an inappropriate "friendship" with another woman!?	So, this weekend my husband left his email open and I found emails between he and a classmate. He is in graduate school and is away during the week, coming home on weekends because I am in graduate school, too. Anyways, in one email she is all upset because he didn't come to see her and in another they both say they love each other!!! Come to find out he has become supposedly very good friends with her and even has spent the night on her couch. I blew up about it, of course, at first and told him he has to go to counseling, confront the girl, etc. But only a few days later I feel like I don't even care. It's so weird. I think I should care and be upset and hurt, but the thing is, I just don't feel that way. It's like I am so excited about the pregnancy that his indiscretions are not as important. I mean, I know he didn't cheat on me (and yes, i do know), but he did hide the entire friendship and he has said he loves her so, why don't I care?? What's wrong with me??

20090304155513AApheQl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Getting rid of pre-birth matching?	So many people think that pre-birth matching is wrong and coersive (me included).  What I am wondering is what could a woman who decides to relinquish but has not matched pre-birth realistically do to plan adoption for her baby post-birth without turning the child over to social services, thus causing the child to spend time in foster care.  I do think that foster care for a few months in some cases for babies who surely would find families quickly is a lot better than the coersion going on.  I'm just wondering if there are any processes or agencies available to avoid that.

No sleepovers or get togethers with friends at all.

Please don't make a joke about this this is something very important to me and to my son
20090304160314AAmOaHE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	No intimacy now that I am pregnant?	I asked this in another section but thought it should go here.       My fiance and I don't have an active bedroom life, (not by my choice) I am 25 and he is 42. I am 9 1/2 weeks pregnant and the last time we were "together" was when I got pregnant. He doesn't even touch me now, unless it is to give me pecks on the mouth when he leaves for work and when I wake up.       To say the least I am getting pretty frustrated. Is it normal that it went to non existent when we found out I was pregnant? Could it have something to do with his age? I think he is getting bored he has never been in a committed relationship. So what can I do?          ADD: Please don't say anything about the age difference, he lied about his age when we first met, he said he was 35, and he looks it. By the time we moved in together and I found out, I loved him.

20090304160614AAiCALz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am curious as to why everyone is so?	cautious throughout their pregnancies...       You have to realize there is nothing wrong with doing a lot of things while your pregnant.  Think back 30 years, smoking/ drinking wasn't frowned upon while pregnant and you turned out fine huh?      So what is all this new found fuss on being a pregnant health nut? Can anyone enlighten me?      Please don't misunderstand this. I am pregnant and I no longer smoke and drink, and I am trying to eat a little more healthful. But I don't load up on greens. I am just wondering why do some women do some drastic things while pregnant?

20090304161448AAzT7nW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I complain - asked for toddlers proof of age?	I took my daughter to a soft play place today which is free entry for under 2's (she's almost 18 months).  After an hour or so, we sat down to have something to eat and one of the staff came over and asked how old my daughter is.  I thought she was just making conversation, and told her she is almost 18 months.  She said 'Do you have any proof of that with you?'!!  When I asked why she would want proof, she said that based on a) how well my daughter can throw a ball (!) and b) that she could hold her own bowl and feed herself with a (toddler) knife and fork which the other children there who had paid to get in (were over 2) couldn't do, she didn't believe she was only 18 months.  I told her that, seeing as i was the one who gave birth to her, I'm pretty sure about when she was born!  But she insisted that next time I go, I have to take 'ID' to prove how old...or in this case - young, she is!  How ridiculous is that.  Would you complain about this?  To be fair, I think I just won't go back.

Okay so I know plenty of guys here, but I'm going to Florida on Spring Break for two weeks and I want to meet new guys there.      I'm 14, so nothing like going to a bar. There won't be parent supervision and I'm probably going to be hanging out at the beach with my friend the entire time and that'll get boring after a while.

20090304162616AArbzgc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is this normal for a 3 year old boy?	My 3 year old son currently comes over for visits ever 2 weeks, he is just about done potty training. He is constantly holding himself and when I ask if he has to go pee he says yes, or sometimes, he even dances and says he has to go pee. But when I take him in there he sits there for a split second to like 5 seconds and then says he is done, but he has not gone, or has only forced out a few drops.  5 or 10 minutes later he will tell me that he has to pee. this goes on all day long!!! Is this normal? Should I be concerned. His mom has not mentioned anything to me about any concerns she has, but I have not yet asked her.  Anyone else had this problem?
20090304162844AA4W9M1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Guys out there would it bother you if your friend when out with your ex, who broke up with you?	I'm in 8th grade if it matters. There is this guy at my school who I like so much and we would be so great togther I think. But, I went out with one of his best friends before for like 2 weeks last year I never even kissed him though and I broke up with him. He was the first and only guy I've only dated. We were nothing alike and it was absolutly horrible, but the guy still looks at me with stupid sad eyes half the time. I try to avoid him, but when he sees me he always trys to talk to me like before. I under no cirumstance want to go out with him, he and I are nothing alike, he is most of the time the opposite of me. Now I don't know if I can ever be with the guy who is so perfect. Any guys out there who have an oppion about if it would bug you if one of your best friends went out with your ex who broke up with you? I don't want to ruin his friendship with him. I won't let myself no matter what I won't do that to him.

20090304160216AAs2iwJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Fetal movement patterns at 21 (almost 22 weeks) - is this normal?	Hey everyone! I'm pretty sure this is normal but I just like hearing stories from other women in the same situation as me. Like my question says, I am almost 22 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I've been feeling little movements since I was 16 weeks (my placenta is posterior so I can feel movements easier). Ever since I was 20-ish weeks I have felt kicks and wriggles every day, but some days I go hours without feeling much of anything. The baby is most active early in the morning, like until lunchtime, and then late at night. Is this normal to go hours without feeling anything? Sometimes I get really worried. I had an ultrasound this past week and everything was 100% normal...heartbeat was great & baby was measuring right on target. Any advice would be appreciated! :)

When we give people advice about stuff we KNOW or at feel we know and type out our similar situation, have you ever wondered if people actually believe you?

What do you think about Nickelodeon making a dora doll that is more mature?She will have long hair and long legs. I could only watch 1 1/2 min of the video. I just watched a video of it on cnn, and they said that people are making a petition to not change her.      My cousins watch Dora the Explorer. Do you think it's OK for an older "Dora" doll? I think that Dora should stay the same, because kids are going to move on anyways.

Of course when I told my parents, they freaked. My dad wants grandchildren to keep the surname going. And my mother, she's saying "Just wait till you meet the right woman". Yeah, I'll find another woman if she was desperate to have kids. I just don't have any tolerance for kids.      Of course I've gotten the usual statements most parents would say. I am of legal age, but won't state the exact age.      How can I get my parents to respect that I'm never going to have children? And another thing, how is it that people are too young to choose NOT to have kids but they aren't young if they have or want kids?

20090227081749AAPBK0W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What are some good remedies for growing pains?	My 2 1/2 year old daughter has started waking up in the middle of the night crying that her legs hurt.  Our pediatrician told us these are most likely growing pains and to give her some Tylenol or Motrin when she complains of the pain.  She takes the medicine and asks why, I tell her it will make the pain go away.  Right after she takes it she looks at me and says "My leg still hurts."  LOL  So I'll rub her leg(s) to help until she relaxes and drifts back to sleep.   Is there anything else I can do before she goes to bed to help ease the pain or when she wakes up to ease the pain until the medicine kicks in?

20090227084236AAZZHAL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What could this be? Implantation or something else?	I had a miscarriage a little over a month ago and had my first AF 2 weeks ago. The doctor told me my levels are down to zero as of then and I could start trying again as soon as I am ready. We have not really been trying and figured we would leave it up to God for the next couple of months. Yesterday I went to the bathroom and had pink spotting when I wiped and that was the only time it happened. The next time I went to the bathroom there was only a tiny spot o the paper( sorry tmi) and the rest of the night nothing. My AF was on feb. 13th. I did have sex frequently after my AF so I was wondering what this could be.  Implantation or something else? Since the miscarriage I have had no problems and my AF was normal. What do you think? Oh yeah the day I noticed the spotting was 2/26. Thanks

20090227082644AAWSvoY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question about responsibility?	So the question about the 11yr old boy who shot his pregnant step mother in the back of the head and killed her.      Lets talk about this      Do you think the father of this boy should bear some of the responsibility with jail time for NOT keeping the guns out of reach and under lock and key ?      To me, an 11r old IS OLD ENOUGH to know not to kill and if they aren't then we should look to the parents on how they raised their child and if it's proven the child was raised with right and wrong then I think heavy therapy is needed to turn on that childs brain to know right from wrong       I hope that boy spends up to 15 yrs in prison and along with it mental help, I think the father should be held responsible as well and serve a few yrs.      it doesnt matter if you've taught your kids to hunt and the safety of guns, its still the parents JOB to keep everyone in the home safe

20090227081247AArU0vp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What can I do with my older sister?	My sister has three kids. One lives with her real mother, her only daughter lives with us, and her other son is with her. They came to live with us recently. I don't see how she can call herself a good mother. She keeps the 19 almost 20 month old in a playpen all day, and sometimes she doesn't change him when he needs it, and sometimes she doesn't feed him when he needs it. She hasn't started trying to potty train him, she has yet to let him eat by himself, and if it's still early and he cries, she puts him down for a nap. She never lets the child out of his playpen, because she doesn't have to watch him if he's in there. Also, she looks at her children like they are possessions, not human lives. Her daughter is five, and no matter how much she begs for her mother's attention, her mother just shrugs her off and tells her to go play. She was away from her for six days, and she didn't even call once to check on the girl. The only time she talked to her was when I called her. We have tried talking to her, but she's one of those people that manipulate the story to her advantage and she can't reason. She is also a compulsive liar. She hasn't yet gotten a job to support herself or her children, and I'm afraid that her children aren't getting all that they need. I try to give them as much as I can without making it look like I'm taking care of them, because she would get very mad about how "those are HER kids and nobody will take care of them but HER". She yells at them constantly because they annoy her though, and she acts as if the 19 month old comprehends whatever she's saying.      Nobody can talk to her about it. So what can we do? I'm tired of watching her kids suffer because she wants to be their friend and not their parent.      And their father isn't that good either. He's addicted to drugs and he's fixing to lose his job also. I can't really do anything myself because I'm only 17, but I'm also fearful of children services taking her children away. I don't want to see them go, and I know I could take great care of them myself.

20090227081755AAkTBpZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Opinions from moms who have let their babies cry it out?	My daughter is almost 11 months old and has never been a good sleeper.  My husband and I, after getting up with her several times a night for almost a year have decided to let her cry it out.  We have tried this once already for 2 days when she was almost 9 months.  She would cry for a least an hour.  It seemed like when i went in her room after a half an hour or so and laid her back down, without talking, she would cry even harder than previously.  She didn't need anything although, i think she just wanted me. For those 2 nights we tried it last time, she cried for around 1 to 2hours plus got up several times that night as well crying.  I stopped due to my 7 year old telling me that he didn't get a good night's sleep because the baby was crying too much and he has school in the morning. I felt bad for him.  We then decided to wait until spring break in March (lasts one week) that way he didn't have to get up for school.  Anyone have any advise?  How long did it take? Will she always cry herself to sleep.  Please help!

20090306160108AAmD88W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Different breakfast for your child?	What do you serve your child for breakfast, before he / she is leaving for school or kindergarden etc. I remember how dull my childhood breakfast meals were: cereals with milk, or cheese and ham sandwitches. I don't want to repeat this pattern with my daughter, who is still a baby now.      I was thinking about the following breakfast ideas:      - blend milk, yogurt, a banana, few frozen berries, sugar-free cereal biscuits and a bit of acacia honey; so the kid will have a good calcium, vitamin, fibre and starch intake and it will tase great, can be eaten quickly w/out much fuss      - do a fresh pear and apple puree in the blender, and serve that with crunchy sugar-free cereals; also offer a glass of milk-chocolate sweetened w acacia honey      - porridge with milk, cinnamon and bananas      Any suggestions of breakfast meals that would be healthy and fun for a child would be really appreciated!       Also, any tips about determining one's child not to be fussy and pretentious, despite the various fun meals (as in, they should naturally eat plain vanilla food once in a while).      Thanks

20090306160230AAOt2Uv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pain after a miscarriage?	I recently found out ive had a miscarriage at around 5 weeks pregnant. I didn't have any pain at the time and only had a light bleed for 1 day a little over 2 weeks ago. Im now having pain in my lower abdomen every now and again, mainly on the right side but at times has been both and is sometimes in my lower back as well.    Ive just come back from the docs who have told me that your body goes back to normal, more often than not, straight after a miscarriage and that im getting pains due to constipation (which as far as i was aware i didn't have as ive experienced this before and its nothing like what im feeling now!), this totally contradicts what the nurse at the hospital told me as i was told there that it can take a few weeks for your body to get back to normal. Ive not had any signs of bleeding since, still leaking slightly from both breasts, and still feeling sick at times. Doc has told me that if ive not had a bleed in the next couple of weeks then to go back but i don't feel like they've helped me at all!! Im totally confused has anyone else experienced this or can offer any advice??!      I wasn't given an ultrasound coz the nurse at the hospital told me it would be too early to see anything, she just did another test which cam out negative and said id miscarried.   I have 1 positive & 2 negative altogether

I am wondering if anyone has had their child on it for the same reason and if so how long until they saw results.    She was originally breastfed, then started getting extremely gassy/fussy/acid reflux, the works, dr. put me on elimination diet, which yielded little results.  I then bought her lactose free milk based formula, and saw improvement but not all the way, then bought good start soy and saw dramatic improvement, but then she got/has been since extremely constipated with pain and crying.  The doctor said soy causes constipation and put her on Alimentum, she has been on it for 2 days now and some karo syrup with little results.  Has anyone had these problems, and how long should the alimentum take to regulate her and will it help with her appearant allergies?  Sorry so long, I am a first time mommy and this is all new to me!

20090306163000AAMzvOo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Should moms be able to bring their baby in a stroller up to the bar and have a drink?	Some women think that they should not have to change their lives just because they have had a baby. They actually meet up at a bar as a social event.     Other people think this is totally unexceptable.  People go to a bar to have fun and unwind, not hear babies crying.  They don't have to worry about setting a good example for the babies or small children.

What was your first job?   (Okay I know i have an issue and I can't help asking more than one question at a time)      I was 15 (outside of babysitting) and I washed dishes in the summer time.  I never appreciated my money more than that year.     I dont know that I will make my kids get a job.  School and activities I do believe are important.  Although, the maturity that I gained by working was priceless and just as important.  I did learn very quickly about the value of the dollar and how it felt to earn something.  I had a lot of respect for everything I helped pay for.  Its still a long way off for my kids so I have more time to mull the possibilities.   What are your thoughts?
20090306190102AAN8IQ9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When to leave? Before or after?	Just a question for all you ladies who got pregnant and found yourselves alone upon finding out.  My "ex"/soon-to-be ex has just informed me that he does plan on leaving me as soon as the baby comes, but didn't want to leave during my pregnancy because he didn't want me to feel stress and hurt the baby.  He thinks it will be easier to leave once the baby comes.  Personally I think this is cruel, and it is worse to leave once the baby shows up...because how do I ever explain that to our daughter?  He is expecting me to give her his last name, as well.        Here's the question--do you think it is easier to go through the pregnancy alone or go through it with someone that you know is going to be leaving?  I of course know that I have the option to just stay out of contact with him, but it is difficult because I'm very close to his family and he just won't go away at this point.  Sorry for the rambling...but I hope this all makes sense :)       Thanks for answering in advance.

20090306171936AAFVCf4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is Breastfeeding Really Good Now?	My son is 11 months old and he has been breastfed since birth.  He has never taken a bottle and despite our efforts he just prefers the boob which is fine with me.  I have noticed though that he isn't gaining any weight???? He was 17Lbs 8 oz's at his 9month check up and he is still that weight now at 11months old.   He is more active now with walking around furniture and crawling like a madman and he does eat normal food.  Whatever i eat he eats but he still fails to gain weight.   check his weight every couple of weeks and there is never any change.   According to his chart he is lower than 3rd percentile which concerns me a bit.  He appears healthy and happy and i've never ben told he isn't unhealthy.   Is breastfeeding maybe the cause of his weight problem as formula is heavier and thicker than breast milk?   is there anything i can do to help him pick up a few pounds? He is very tall but i am concerned that as he grows in height his weight won't grow with him as it's not now. What should i do?

20090306171630AADgM3U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Flannelette sheets and quilts for babies?	I bought some flannelette sheets for my 6 month old baby the other day and saw a warning on the packaging that said "not to be used for babies 12 months and younger". I thought flannelette sheets were great for babies in the cold winter months. Does anyone know why they put this warning on the package? Are they just trying to cover themselves for lawsuits?      Also about quilts for babies. I know that most people in Australia (and the US) use sheets and blankets for their babies. In Scandinavia (where I come from) most people use quilts. Most Australian and US websites I go onto tell you not to use quilts because of the higher risk of SIDS but less babies die from SIDS in Scandinavia than eg. in the US so I don't know why people believe there is more risk of SIDS if you use a quilt than 3 blankets. Quilts are so much warmer for winter. Does anyone use quilts or is everyone using blankets?

There's so many warnings of death and illness out there now, even pharmacists  won't recommend medication for small children for a cold. All they recommend  is Benadryl or Claritin, all stuff for allergies. I've been through the whole routine with the doctor waiting  in the waiting room just to hear "it's a cold", so I would rather get  something to comfort my THREE year old daughter through it, but I'm scared to buy just anything now. Has anyone found anything that  works for colds? Stuffy noses and coughs.  If so, I'd love to hear ideas. I know no one on here is a doctor, I'm just curious what everyone else is giving their young children to help them.

I guess I'm still in love with who I thought he was. It's complicated. He makes me sick. A coward. He says I should do what's fair and abort "this thing growing inside of me--this clump of cells." I know I should terminate the pregnancy as my baby will be raised without a father. I know what I should do. Thing is, I've fallen in love with my baby. I think about how he/she will look like. I dream of holding him/her. I dream of what sports he/she will play. I dream of teaching him/her. :(      It saddens me. Between him and I, we are beyond reconciliation. But I dont want to lose my baby. It's mine. My baby will be beautiful. I just... still have things to do. And I want my child to be raised in a traditional home with a mother and father. I am rambling and confused... Suggestions?

Am I doing everything right? I just found out when I went to the hospital on March 2. The doctor said I was 4 weeks and due November 9th. I do have a son who will be 3 in August and he was born at 29 weeks and I guess that's why i'm so scared.

Then she'd roll her tougue as if she need more milk, but we know she had 20-30 mins worth and she's full. If we leave her along to fall asleep, she'd cry. We try not to give pacifier for breastfeed baby until 1 mth. She cry for 2-3 mins and I go and pick her up, then when she's drowsy I put her down. Within 5 mins she's awake in bed again and cry. I keep repeating this 10 min cycle of crying, pick her up, sooth, set her down and she starts all over again. In several cases it lasts for 3 hours so by then it's time to feed again. After another round of feeding, it starts again. Not until she's really tired would she really then fall sleep.       I am out of my wits cos no music, cuddling, more milk seems to be working. I am really going crazy. Any thoughts or ideas? Help me please.
20090306193518AATw5q1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Swaddle or not to swaddle?	I want to know if every baby should be swaddled in bed. I do that to our newborn after every feed. She hates it and cry and struggle. My pediatrician said they don't need to swaddle in bed. But then, when I let her arms and legs go freely, she'd cry after 2 mins. I am lost as to whether she hates swaddling or be free. So far, at least if she's tired swaddling will eventually calm her to sleep. I have yet to see her sleep without swaddling. Bu then I am also worry that if she gets used to swaddling she may not grow out of it and will always need it.      Anyone come across this issue?

20090306212547AAaTBrJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	WIC in California, 2 year old package?	Can someone who received WIC in California please tell me how much milk they are getting from WIC for their 2 year old?  My sister, whose daughter is 2 1/2 years older than my son, said her duaghter got 4 1/2 gallons of milk at 2 yrs and it stayed that way ever since and she is now 4.  I asked WIC and they said the packages for 1-2 yrs are the same, which are 3 gallons and the packages for 3-4 years are the same which is 4 1/2 gallons.  It doesn't make sense to me that they say the children 1-5 years need 2 8oz cups of milk per day, which would require 4 1/2 gallons, not 3 gallons.   So yeah can anyone tell me please what they get for their 2 yr old or if they work for WIC in california only though because I know it can differ from state to state.      Thanks so much.

20090306195743AA2FhdN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	To women that used clomid to get pregnant and is using it again or had used it again to...?	get pregnant, how long then it take you the first time you used it? How long then it take you to get pregnant the second time around? Are you having the same side effects you had the first time you used it? If so, what are or was your side effects? And was your dose the same as it was when you used it the first time? And are you taking it on the same days of your cycle as last time? I ask these question because, I want to see if I'm the only woman having a hard time getting pregnant again using clomid. The first time I used clomid I got pregnant on my second cycle.I was taking 50mg on cycle days 5-9. This time I'm on 100mg and days 5-9. I can't remember if I really had any side effects, I believe that was due to the fact that I had a job and was real busy. So just tell me about your experience with it this.       Thank you all that answer.

20090227090548AAakxeo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Most of the things I read on abusers state that they have poor relations with their moms, but...?	It was about male abusers. But my ex was terribly abusive to me. Most on here agree this too. So I'm not just over reacting, or being spoiled. But he had a great relationship with his mom. In fact, she not only doted on him...but she spoiled him with what she had. She never spanked him. In fact, the last spanking he got from his dad, was when he was three. Not that he was an angel, but one day his dad spanked him a bit too hard and he cried uncontrollably and had a fever, so his dad quit disciplining him from that day fwd. His mom hated to see him cry, so she never disciplined him either.      But when he grew up, he was the man of the house, so mom and sis listened to him(dad was off in the gulf working), and so even when dad got back, he saw his boy became a man, and he just kinda let things be. ANd when my ex did get opposition, he'd get mad, and storm off, or say something to that affect...as if he was just telling all for their own sake, so they should listen. So then when I came into the picture, all were appalled that I didn't know the system(even though I told them I  grew up differently). So I got physically abused for not following his orders as the rest of his clan did.  I only ask this q because I wonder if men who have a great relationship with their parents can be abusers too.

20090227090038AAMhSPr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms - I've got a question for you...?	Is it reasonable to discipline your child like you normally do, at a time when you know they are misbehaving because they are simply overtired?      Example - we were at my parents house, stayed later than I had planned.  My daughter was getting very grumpy, and gave me a hard time about getting coat/boots on when it was time to go.  Normally I would take something away for her not listening and cooperating, but I didn't know whether to or not in this case since it's my fault she was grumpy because we stayed out too late.  Would you 'forgive' the behavior, or treat it like you would on a regular day if she weren't listening to me just because?

20090306200046AAMzk6a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Qestions about expressed milk?	I just read this on kellymom.com      To warm milk       Heat water in a cup or other small container, then place frozen milk in the water to warm; or    Use a bottle warmer.    NEVER microwave human milk or heat it directly on the stove.    The cream will rise to the top of the milk during storage.

I'm completely taken back, there was nothing that could even prepare me for that. My father is trying to convince me to be patient with him, that he's scared and reacting.

I understand that on some level I should move on, and take care of me and the baby and that I deserve better, but this is the father of my child, don't I at least owe it to him to forgive him?

My job requires heavy lifting and I am 5 months pregnant. After a couple days of work, I was suffering from severe back pain. I knew I would be doing a lot of heavy lifting before I applied but I didn't think it was going to hurt this bad. I want to keep working because I have bills to pay especially with this baby coming. I asked my doctor for a back support and she said I should really be on lightduty. My workplace is short on workers right now so that means we have to work extra hard and there probably won't be any light duty. I have not informed my workplace of my pregnancy therefore they will not assume any responsibility if I got hurt. I'm unsure of what to do, especially since I'm new and don't want to make a bad impression. Would I get fired or layed off. Will I get disability leave? What will probably happen? Should I just not give them the lightduty paperwork and continue working with my back support?

He started taking 4 oz of formula every 3-4 hours when he was about 2 weeks old. But I can not figure him out. When it is time for him to eat he screams and carries on we go to feed him and he nibbles two ounces out of the bottle and then absolutely will NOT take anymore. Sometimes he does want to eat about an hour later to finish his bottle, but this just equals him eating constantly. Any suggestions as to why he eats less at each feeding and won't just eat his regular amount? He has been doing this about the last week and he is not sick. Just wondering if anyone else had this happen.

20090306203307AA9YXEQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What would you do if this happened at your doctor's office?	I'm 16 weeks pregnant and get really bad sinus headaches occasionally that last 2-3 days. I was at work with no internet access so I called my doctor which should have been the best choice anyway to ask about an OTC medicine. I told the nurse it contained phenylephrine, and she said as long as it didn't have aspirin it SHOULD be okay. First of all it makes you think anything that does not have aspirin is okay which is obviously not true and second, SHOULD be okay? Are you kidding me? My baby should be okay if I take it. So of course I did not take it until I could research it on my own and it is a class C drug which has not been proven safe for pregnancy. My question is should I call the office administrator and complain, this could have been an ugly situation. If I would have taken it I would be freaking out right now and if someone takes the time to call and ask a question, shouldn't they at least take the time to look it up? I'm just so irritated right now.

So I'm 7 months pregnant and the last couple of days I've been noticing an odor when I go pee, it smells like I am on my period. I researched this a little and found out that it could start to smell like period blood "down there" when your mucus plug becomes looser and your body is preparing itself to go into labor. Is this true??   I've also been having very light period-like cramps in my lower abdomen today.    Please any advice or input would be very much appreciated. I am only 7 months along and if I am going into labor soon my daughter would be born premature.

20090306211559AAeNJlO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	MY GIRLFRIEND LIED ABOUT BEING PREGNANT WTF!? SHOULD I DUMP HER? DOES SHE HAVE PSYCHOLOGIAL ISSUES?	SO, here goes:      Now the situation is a little bit complicated, or at least it seems so to me.  I am currently overseas studying abroad and my girlfriend is back in the states at school. We have been dating for over a year and we both knew that i'd be leaving for study abroad this semester.   Now im not really sure what the deal is with my girlfriend.  She usually gets her period around the 20th of every month, give or take a few. For some reason she didnt have her period on time, she took 2 pregnancy tests which both came out negative (one 2 days before and another a week later)  She ended up having her period nearly two weeks late.        I was a little concerned but not really. As we are sexually active we had talked about what we would do in the event of a pregnancy, I was not worried. We are pretty diligent in using contraceptives (condom, VCF)  But there is always a chance.  So we had talked about this, quite a few times actually.  We loved each other (and have been moving towards marriage) and of course the responsible thing to do would be to get married and raise our baby together.      Now what blows my mind is why the day that she got her period she decides to mess with my head and tell me that she took another pregnancy test and that she is in fact pregnant!!  ON TOP OF THIS SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE WANTS TO HAVE AN ABORTION!!      I cannot understand this, abortion is completely opposite of everything that i've been taught and believe, I think its an EVIL, disgusting thing. I told her I WOULD NOT under any circumstances support her (emotionally or financially) or her decision to have an abortion unless it was threatening to her health. (eptopic pregnancy etc.) This is very hard for me because I want to be there for her but I cannot support this sort of thing, we had talked about it before, numerous times and in depth about what we would do if there was an unplanned pregnancy and abortion was not even considered.      What blows my mind is that she tells me this, rants and raves about getting an abortion, she actually told me that she wants to have the abortion and then get married later, and that i have to marry her because its my responsibility because i got her pregnant and she had to have an abortion!!?  She says "our baby is going to be so beautiful.. butshe has to do it.. WTF>, then after 2 hours the phone card runs out.  2 hours later we are on the phone again and she tells me that maybe she doesnt want to have a pregnancy...      I figure that at this point that she is very hormonal and scared and upset, this whole time on the phone ive been very patient, caring and loving.  I love her and want her to be happy, we already had planned to maybe get married this summer, but not sure yet.  We talk about the future, what we will do and how we will do it.  She wasnt sure what she wanted to do and finally was so tired that she went to bed.  In the mean time I sit down and plan exactly what im going to do to be able to financially support us for the next few years till we get out of college,(i've got 2 years left) which is no real big deal for me, just have to make some adjustments, and work hard, which is fine.      We only talked briefly on the phone the next two days because of phone card issues and finding a time that we could both talk for.  Today when we finally connect we are talking and after about 10 minutes or so she tells me that "SHE WAS JUST FREAKING KIDDING ABOUT BEING PREGNANT!!"      now, i can see that maybe that in the first phone conversation that she said she was pregnant, then told me right after she was just joking.. ok sure ha ha... but no. this was days we are talking about, im abroad and have so much going on i am barely staying afloat.  She DROPS THIS BOMB ON ME AND THEN SAYS IT WAS A FREAKING JOKE!?      I was ready to sacrifice everything for her and the baby! (transfer schools, jobs, move away from friends, family and support networks to somewhere i dont even know anyone... she just transfered to another school)  Last night on the subway I sat and watched the cutest baby in the world cuddled in some moms arms, and thought to myself, wow i'm going to be in the same situation soon, and I was OK with it.  yeah sure an unplanned pregnancy is an adjustment for everyone, after the initial shock wears off you have to decide what you are going to do about it, and i thought that what i decided was the right thing to do, yeah sure even though we talked about it before its still a shock and its very emotional, goals and plans and other things have to be adjusted and changed right? but its ok, somethings are more important, like raising a child, Whats the value of a life? I couldnt go my whole life knowing that I was responsible for someone else's death, for killing an innocent.  I Had no idea that she was actually like that, that she would one, consider killing her own child (which i know people from different backgrounds and cultures consider ok or commonpractice,, but i dont)      What gets me mo

20090306212704AA4qV0t	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do in this situation?	I'm 38 weeks pregnant so I'm pretty much due to have my little boy any time now. Throughout my pregnancy (since it was very noticeable anyway) my fiances ex-wife has been telling her son (who is almost 3) to hit me or kick me in the tummy, etc. We tell him its not okay to do that and he will say he's sorry and that mommy told him to. Then he usually won't do it again until coming back from visiting her. My fear is if she is this petty what if she tells her son to hit his little brother?? I think he would do it if she told him to because he listens to everything else she says...and really what child at that age wants to disappoint their mommy? So I was thinking do you think I should call her and discuss this with her? Or should I just bite my tongue?? My fiance and her are currently in the middle of a huge custody battle (and i'm sure thats at least partially why she tells her son to hurt me, and that i'm mean, and that i dont love him, etc) so I don't know - what should I do? I doubt my fiance will say anything to her -- he tries to avoid talking to her at all costs...so it's pretty much going to be left in my hands.      thanks for any advice :)

However when I was three months pregnant he walked out. He has been really nasty ever since and accuses me of telling lies about his family when I really have done nothing. I think that when I started having to ask him for a bit more help he just freaked out. Anyway baby is due in May and since we have split he hasn't asked me about the baby once and has done nothing in the way of showing any interest. He says that once the baby is born he would like to see it just once a month! Does any one know if I legally have to tell him that the baby has been born or can I wait for him to find out for himself?       I would rather he was was completely absent then turning up once a month and taking my child away from me for a couple of hours.He has made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me and won't even go in the same room as me.       I have tried everything to get him involved with the pregnancy and offered him as much time with the baby as he wants but he is just not interested.       I appreciate any advise of help that you can offer.       Thank you,

20090227091712AAokeQb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Very light brown spotting before period?	I'm hoping someone can tell me what this might be.   My last period began the 4th of Jan and I'm usually 27 or 28 day cycle. My breasts get sore well before I start and have always had severe cramps. I usually start with light to moderate brown discharge (sorry for details) 1 or 2 days before I start. All in all pretty predictable.   My husband and I use the withdrawl method going on a year now, but not always the most careful.   This month I started very light brown spotting that is light at its heaviest, and only specs of brown mucous at its lightest. Its all very off and on. I have sore breasts (thats usual), cramps, and a bit of nausea. This started Monday 23rd (about 5 days ago), with a little over a week to go until my period.   What do you think?

20090227101247AAnNz0e	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Not the right section, but just wondering why you think this would happen?	I had given my daughter fish sticks and a tiny little bowl of tartar sauce. She had some on her arm and a little on her face. Every spot she had it it turned her skin red, like a rash. It was not from rubbing to hard, because it was in the exact same spots that it touched her skin. It was there for like an hour maybe, fading slowly the entire time until it was gone. She in not allergic to it to eat it, but is it possible that something in it could cause a skin allergy?       And there was no need to take her to the doctor, it nothing serious, it just appeared to be at the least a skin irritant.      Only posting here because i feel most comfortable here.
20090227092521AAmVIwi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you have prenatal depression?  If so, what did you do?	I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I'm sure that's what is going on. I am 41 weeks, 1 day pregnant and for the past month or so, I've been so moody, so irritable. All along, I've said I want a natural, drug-free labor and delivery, but my body is showing no signs of upcoming labor - the baby hasn't even dropped yet! I am really, really uncomfortable and just want this baby to come out, by whatever means. Honestly, sometimes I think I am starting to resent the baby for making me so miserable. I've always thought I'd be a good mother; even all throughout this pregnancy (up until lately), I was so excited and ready to meet my little one, and be a good mother. I tried to talk to my husband about it, but he didn't get it. He was just like, "Think happy thoughts; imagine how wonderful it will be to hold the baby. You'll be okay; it's mind over matter." I've tried not to feel so bad. I've tried to imagine what it'll be like to have my baby. But really, I just can't! I feel like I'm never even going to have this baby, and I'll be stuck in this pregnant misery forever! I don't really have anyone to talk to who would understand! What can I do? I don't want to take medication...

20090227104851AAhdLwR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should I Do This? Or Would it Be Considered Lame?	I'm a natural blonde (dirty ashe blonde), but I've always had my hair the lighter blonde.       Well, I want to spruce it up a bit and put pink highlights through my hair. I have natural highlights (from light blonde to dark brown). However, I'm afraid it will look extremely tacky when it grows out (the pink).       I'm a college freshman. I'm insanely crazy, but I'm also one of the most intelligent in my class.       That's the thing. Would doing this with my hair be appropriate??      Please answer! I always choose a Best Answer if that's an incentive!!

20090227114530AAysL5z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Any ideas about how I could APOLOGIZE to my BFF?	We had this HUGE fight about literally nothing lately, ok I have been the one who brought it up and I've been really mean and nasty to her. I apologized and said I'd been out the line and such and she said it was ok but we haven't talked much and when we do it's just like "how're ok" and "ok have a good one" kind of stuff. She's been kinda busy lately, her bf is sick so she's taking care of everything so that's her excuse but I think she's still mad, I asked her but she said she wasn't.    I feel really bad about what I did and I want to do or say something really nice, it's just she moved away two years ago so we don't get to see each other more than once a year, we're way too far apart so the only options I got to talk to her are calling or mailing her.    I was just wondering what I could do, like I'm definitely gonna call her tonight and talk to her once more, I was just thinking maybe there's something I can do to show her how much our friendship means to me.. Any ideas???   Thanks!
20090227093044AARLIkA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it wrong to take away 4 month old's pacifier?	My husband and I gave our daughter a pacifier when she was a newborn.  She is now dependent on it.  She can't go to sleep with out it.  It is becoming a problem because she has started pulling it out and crying when she can't get it back in, so one of us has to put it back in.   This can go on for 30 minutes.  We would really like to break her dependence on the pacifier but feel guilty because we are the ones that gave it to her.  Is it wrong to take it away?  Is she to young?  Should we try to break it now or wait till later?  Any advice would be great

20090227094216AAqYwdc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you keep children/teens in their room?	when they are grounded?  I think they should be allowed around the house.  Some children have really small rooms (we live in Manhattan) and I won't turn my home into prison.  Like this:     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I usually only take away one thing, like TV or computer for a few days.  If they stay out late or do something dangerous, then grounded for a week at home, no going out, but they can still have their possesions.        I tend to think grounding is a cop-out anyway.  I rather prefer natural consequences; make a mess, you clean it up.  They screw up in school, they do extra studying BEFORE any TV or going out.

20090227094324AAIre5q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Which name do you like?	I like "boy" names for girls but then I choose a feminine middle name. My daughter is named Rowan Olivia and if we have another girl these are the names we love.       My husbands favorite is Charlee Grace,   but we also like   Finley Grace   Devyn Grace      I also like the girl name Ainslee Grace   and no we dont like girl names for boys.       Boy names we like   Declan Gerald   Daxton Gerald   Rylan Gerald   Landon Gerald         Let me know what you think and though they may not be your choice there is no need to be rude or mean about them. I am not naming my child Apple, Mowgli, Auto Science, Moonunit or Pilot Inspektor if I was then I would understand why people would be mean.
20090227095023AA86YUi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should I hold my middle school aged daughter back?	My daughter is almost 14 and should be going to 9th grade (high school) next year. She has had a very bad couple of years academically and is very unmotivated to get better no matter what reward/punishment she receives. I believe it is in her best interest to be held back at the end of this year. I want opinions on this please. Anyone been held back in high school or middle school? How did it affect you? Did it help you in the long run?
