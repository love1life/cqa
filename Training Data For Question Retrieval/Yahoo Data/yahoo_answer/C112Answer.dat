A person entering a place residence to work should not smoke while working unless given permission by the resident.  My question would be is if you are in construction can you smoke outside if that is where you work?     The bigger issue is that if you have a place where the majority smoke (mechanics shop as an example) and a person comes in that does not smoke the rest would be expected to comply with the no smoking in the workplace.|`|97c0c32c93779fc914dc48e8c22d526aaa	I'm sure every state law or city ordinance trying to legislate smoking has a definition of workplace in it.

Which  is fine for his enthusiasts, but it makes it difficult for the average person to understand his views and intentions.    I don't believe the breed of average American today is even worthy of what Ted has to offer, nor do they understand him.     But that is the price of liberalism, like communism, the blind lead the blind. Ted is fighting a huge uphill battle, and despite his wisdom and morals, eventually his views and those of others like him will be squashed by ignorance and a lack of continuity that was created by the wrong-doings of the left.

i0LUuhyLaa	I can give you one story as I had an opportunity to speak at length with an illegal. The youngest son in the family he never wanted to leave Mexico. As his brothers married and left home there was less and less money. His aging father was no longer able to farm. He left home and traveled all over Mexico working. He got a job servicing windmills, fell and was in a coma for a week. It was then he decided to cross the border which he did via a coyote, his sister and brother in the US paid his way. He met an American almost immediately who helped him get a job, obtain a TIN and started learning English.  That was 9 years ago. He sends money back to his parents, his father is now completely disabled. He dreams of being able to return to his homeland but still doesn't know how he would support them. He never heard of NAFTA. He is 35 years old. Yes, I understand. I do not agree with crossing illegally, but yes I understand.|`|OgmG9f2zaa	Honestly, until they started with the marches and such, I had a live and let live kind of attitude.

How does one turn a blind eye to that kind of idiocy?  And La Raza, they make the KKK look like a bunch of nice guys!  I felt that huge slap in the face and it began!  I investigated the costs and the break down on labor and wages, etc. and I've been seriously annoyed since it has begun.

What is a 'valid cause' to steal my child's education funds that my child needs, too?    If you mean a 'justification', I simply don't see it.    If you mean 'cause and effect for some', I absolutely see it and agree it should be changed and that NAFTA, the Doha round coming with India, the Korean trade agreement before Congress and SPP should be dismantled and we should take and entirely new approach to trade that doesn't see trade as the ends, but only a more important means, if it works, to a better life here at home.    If we can solve the problem going forward I have all kinds of flexibility regarding those here who are not in gangs and are not criminals.  Horrible as many here think me, I don't really like the picture of kids in my kids's schools and Boy Scout troop being taken from the country in waves.  (I live in LA, and I can just imagine, although I have no idea who is and isn't legally here.)    However, 'justification' not only ISN'T in my analysis of the situation, I think the argument really pisses people off on the anti side - particularly those who have gone through periods of poverty without taking anything illegally from anyone else.      I think I know what you are after, and while we come to it from different sides, I frankly agree with you.  I think Kennedy was an idiot to go to big business to carve his deal, and think our side would have a hard time carving one with him.  However, I think there is a middle ground we can come to that our political leaders are oblivious of, and I support you in trying to find it.    In that scenario, only big business really loses, and I can't tell you how that prospect breaks my heart.  What is right for GM stopped being right for America when GM stopped thinking its jobs should be filled with American workers.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Your questions as usual are thought provoking and give pause to think about what lies ahead.  I understand NAFTA quite well. NAFTA was and is a disaster.  Thank you for that one Slick Willy. While I see what you are getting at, I see it as a rationalization of what still remains an illegal act. I DO see the reason why they come.  It remains illegal.  The "reform" we need to see is:  1: Come up with an effective means to close off the illegal influx ftom the south. That means a partial fence/wall/whatever in some places as well as the high tech toys that will allow illegals to be detected and interdicted.  The technology is there. Build it, integrate it, and they WON'T come. This is paramount.  2: Round up and deport to their countries of origin any active criminals in gangs.   3: Immediate deportation of anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving violence/identity theft/forgery/and a few more I won't bother to add. You get the idea. This of course assumes that the border is secure.  4:Background checks done in a timely manner (and I don't mean 24 hours...that was the biggest joke I've ever seen) on all people in this Country illegally over a 2-4 year period of time. Those who fail to show up for the background check....Gone. No messing around. They are out and never to return.    There is a lot more, but I'll leave  writing books to the Authors out there.|`|3x4PILA5aa	NAFTA has destroyed a lot of jobs in the US, thankfully Bush no longer has fast-track authority.How is their search for a better life more important than my protecting my way of life?

I personally know many construction workers (citizens, friends, neighbors) who are having to fight tooth and nail with NON citizens for employment, that is not right.  I live in one of the fastest growing housing markets in the country and I am seeing citizens loose to cheaper labor, those citizens have families too. I understand they are looking for a better life but if that better life is itself harming some is it right?    I am NOT a fan of NAFTA it has hit the middle class pretty hard and not just Mexico, the United States has been the hardest hit if you want to look at sheer figures.  Canada, Mexico and the United States have all lost many middle class good paying jobs to NAFTA and our people face this issue also.    As DAR pointed out this is harming more than just low skilled labor, the education system is taking a pretty good knock also but even if education were not affected should we turn our backs on those citizens who are directly affected by illegal immigration just because we are not?  That is the part I do not understand, some of our people are without a doubt being affected should we ignore this?    I am also pro reform, something is seriously broken here and in desperate need of repair.
sTWXtUQUaa	yea. its not that they don't wanna be legal. they wanna become part of america and pay taxes and such    they are just forced into hiding because of the risk of deportation    they came here illegally in the first place because the wait and cost to enter the united states was greater than they could afford to spend due to the fact that they were slowly dying of poverty and hunger|`|jNGg5JOsaa	They want to be legal not so they can start "paying for everything"....    but so they can get jobs that pay more (employers who hire illegals know they don't have to pay very much) and so they don't have to live in fear/hiding of being discovered of being illegal and being sent back.

We legalized 2.7 million illegals in the 1986 amnesty, and you know what that did?  It is estimated that for every illegal legalized, an estimated 4 new ones have replaced him.  Legalizing of 12 million illegals is only going to encourage more to come.  If we only enforced the laws that were set up since 1986 then one by one every illegal would start packing.|`|6Wi5wvA3aa	I think legalizing them would make it easier and less worry-some for them to live legally and out of the shadows.

The KLA (UCK Albanian) was a splinter group of Albanians that got fed up with the non-violent policies of then Kosovo-Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. This group begun recruiting young men in Kosovo and abroad. It also raised millions of dollars through donations ( and yes some may have been dirty money) . Their popullarity eventually spread and came to be seen by the Albanian popullation as brave freedom fighters.      Now I do admit some Albanian criminals individuals caused terror to some folks (no different that those rogue soldiers we read about today in Iraq murdering someone there). But these cruel individuals were not under the direct command of the KLA. They acted on their own. These incidents were rare and it pails in comparison to the torture and inhumanities the Albanians suffered at the hands the Serbian organs of control.      The KLA was not a terrorist group. It was reported that way to the UN by Yugoslavia and other nations in the beginning. As the UN  issued travel warnings to Kosovo and in 1997 the world had no idea whom the KLA was and took the Yugoslav statements for face value(anything that come out of that governent was BS). So the US quickly removed them from the State Department's list of terrorists group and in 1999 made them allies in working together for a common goal and that was to expel the real terrorists whom were sent into Kosovo to terrorize, expel, murder, rape and plunder the Albanians of Kosovo.     The KLA has been disbanded for some time now. But according to some of the posters here they still provide 90% of the heroin in Hamburg and other European cities?     To the guy that said we(US) supported the wrong side- On 9/11 the Serbs were dancing jubilanty on the streets of Belgrade. While the US is incorporating more and more ex communist nations into NATO, Russia and it staunchest ally Serbia are on the brink of starting another cold war. I have seen your antiAlbanian rhetoric before and my advice to you is do more reading and less writing because you are a little mixed up.

02abadc75852efa59adbb5e9501234f1aa	Well you know about the Bush/Clinton dynasty right? They are in cahoots together to bring about the North American Union and Hillary has also pretty much been endorsed by Bush. She is also the media darling so I would say Clinton will be the next president and no amount of voting otherwise will make a difference.    Edit: CNF you and I apparently share the same politics. Good for you. Tell it like it is.|`|AA10542692	You really shouldn't judge our country cause you are only able to base your info on what the media feeds you. And to accuse our president of 9/11 is really disrespectful big time!|`|qIuoNztPaa	Yes,   The other day when Bush spoke, he said he was surprised that Romney was polling ahead of the pack. He then commented that he "expects" Clinton to be the frontrunner for the Dems and win the Dem primary.    Hillary has actually been a Republican several times in her live, as media has been reporting. This just goes to show, they're both corrupt parties and it's all set-up prior to elections. I'm writing in Al Gore in hopes that his environmentalism will help our planet, which I'm most concerned about.    Living in America, soon to be fascist nation. We can Do Better than this. It's 2007. We should be helping one another, children, healthcare, peace, environmental solutions to clean up the planet. I don't get the greed, power thing. It's a ridiculous pissing contest that never seems to end in all of world history.    And so many of us here don't even know what the hell to do about it. We're already slaves any way we look at it. What the hell can we do?  By the way, more than 75% of our country feels this way. How's that for little or no hope.    Oh, and don't listen to the faceless Pro-Bush responders all over this website. They're paid by Bush to respond, as if the American people actually feel that way.  Give me a break.  All the poles show the truth, not the War-Hawk's Propaganda campaign. Suck-It Creeps!

I can't say I believe it all but I learned a lot from it and I have been investigating the new word order conspiracies and it is very interesting. I believe that this is what they believe.                Subjects:The Beatles spies from Britian sent to the US to create a drug culture planned by Crowley? Adolf Hitler a bastard child of Hebrew Zionist Rothchild bloodline? Prince William the Antichrist and direct bloodline of King David? All I know is that this was more interesting then anything on TV. If people believe in shows like Ghost hunter this is more convincing. Its 31 segments about 10minutes each. If you like to think this will make you think. Skull and Bones,Free Masons,Jesus Christ, Egyptian Pharoahs. You will never see this on tv even if it was presented as fiction. Media mind control. And to think thats just the tip.

B has "volunteered". This agreement will not be enforceable unless it is in the form of a deed.    However if it was B that hurt A's foot, and B made the agreement in order to settle any claim A might have against him, it will be enforceable -- this is because A has given up a right to sue, enough to be the basis of a contract.|`|AA10298137	Oral contracts are perfectly enforceable, if you can prove them.  If there are witnesses around, it shouldn't be a problem.      If A is a minor, then his parents have the right to represent him and the contract is valid.  If A is an adult, then the contract is also valid provided that A doesn't object to it (which I don't see why he would).|`|uFGRSRNSaa	The parents of A have no legal expectation unless A is mentally incompetent and the parents function as A's conservator/ responsible persons. depending on the court whether B is responsible or negligent for the injury to A would determine whether B can be held to the oral agreement by A.|`|FxA8P5Gdaa	well the only contracts that are effective in court are signed documents with witness signatures.

From that site, the beginning of an article entitled, "Trends in Political Values and Core Attitudes: 1987-2007 Political Landscape More Favorable To Democrats."    March 22, 2007    "Increased public support for the social safety net, signs of growing public concern about income inequality, and a diminished appetite for assertive national security policies have improved the political landscape for the Democrats as the 2008 presidential campaign gets underway.    At the same time, many of the key trends that nurtured the Republican resurgence in the mid-1990s have moderated, according to Pew's longitudinal measures of the public's basic political, social and economic values. The proportion of Americans who support traditional social values has edged downward since 1994, while the proportion of Americans expressing strong personal religious commitment also has declined modestly. . ."|`|24XGvxUjaa	Um no and the American people I don't think will be supporting the Democrats in return when it comes time to the voting block...|`|AA10809357	From the stupid ones.|`|uEM1p5b2aa	You might check the 15% or lower approval rating that the Democratic run Congress has.|`|JdOhkCPAaa	no - I dont believe in polls they are done very creatively and numbers can be manipulated - and the same would go if you asked if the GOP had the support for the population|`|z1WladkKaa	There was another poll similar to that one done by Rasmussen.

Obama is not right, but he's better than McCain.  Obama is gonna promote war.  He's heping Pakistan to raise an army against India, and the Pakistanis don't deserve that.  They only hate people. They are never content with what they have, and they want more.  First Bangladesh, and now India.  India is a better country, and Pakistan has always hated India.    So, just promoting the war will only increase unhappiness.    He is also not going to stop the wars that are going on (related to USA)    That's not good.    BUT    He is in for the LGBT rights, and McCain isn't.  So, since he's gonna lead his country, I guess it's best for everyone...Obama should win.  McCain and Sarah Palin are silly fishes.  Experience isn't everything....Obama will learn a lot if he wins.    Actually, someone like Oprah Winfrey should run for the elections.

In his 422 page autobiography, 'Dreams from My Father', he never expresses any pride, love or appreciation of America or say anything POSITIVE about American government, culture, society, freedom or opportunity. He calls his book 'A record of personal, interior journey to establish himself as a black American" & that he 'Lives with a nightmare vision of black powerlessness'. Voters should be wary of the motives behind Obama's desire to be a leader of our country when he openly admits his obcessive hunger for power & has targeted unregistered blacks to do so & vote for him. In his book he sounds like a bitter man wanting to turn the tables on white Americans due to the unjust treatment of blacks in history. Obama is a wolf in sheeps clothing with a flock of obamabots so caught up in his obamamania that they are blind to the truth. But if Obama wins, his supporters will suffer the same consequences under his leadership as those who supported McCain.

I voted for Obama this morning and I feel on top of the world.|`|fh12fkNWaa	No, they are both doing it today.|`|012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	No that's called being smart, and both McCain and Obama are doing it.|`|944b14f23dca16304ce58a5d55e2a97daa	Nope.

On June 30 I celebrate my independence day and on July 4 I celebrate America's. This year is special, because it marks the 40th anniversary of my independence.    On June 30, 1968, I escaped Communist Cuba and a few months later I was in the United States to stay. That I happened to arrive in Richmond on Thanksgiving Day is just part of the story, but I digress.    I've thought a lot about the anniversary this year. The election-year rhetoric has made me think a lot about Cuba and what transpired there. In the late 1950s, most Cubans thought Cuba needed a change, and they were right. So when a young leader came along, every Cuban was at least receptive.    When the young leader spoke eloquently and passionately and denounced the old system, the press fell in love with him. They never questioned who his friends were or what he really believed in. When he said he would help the farmers and the poor and bring free medical care and education to all, everyone followed. When he said he would bring justice and equality to all, everyone said "Praise the Lord." And when the young leader said, "I will be forchange and I'll bring you change," everyone yelled, "Viva Fidel!"|`|QtiMP3qYaa	Well at least he's trying and did not give up,nice effort though.|`|XRXG0MIIaa	They are both campaigning today. I guess they are both desperate...|`|9b1e98c8fc05481b0450ee39fbab38c3aa	Of course not. Campaigning always goes to the last minute.    JMB
nisHjIvfaa	(It's okay, Carlye.  I don't think you're being mean.)    Well, if he DID do it, he could have bet on getting these kind of responses from most.  I mean, com'on, who would rub out their own granny?  (Although, it's about as heartless as letting abortion-survival babies die in a hospital linen closet.  Perhaps more-so, since they don't even get a chance to live 86 years.)    Having the devious mind of a mystery writer, I find the timing is quite coincidental.  Dare I saw it: maybe for a sympathy vote?  Anything is possible in this very odd (presidential) race.    What I find more odd, though, is that when he flew out to Hawaii to visit her last weekend before it was too late, he didn't bring his daughters to see Great-Granny one last time.  Nor did he stay for (what was to become) her last birthday . . . the day after he left.  He couldn't have stayed for that?    There are some questions that need asking.  And most are too afraid to do so.|`|ZN9TAufPaa	I think he might have had something to do with it, I mean if you seriously think about, and get your head out of the gutter, it is very possible. But horrible to think that this man who may rule over our country would do that!!! I mean he already believes in burning christians. And went to a church that dissed white people......his grandmother was white. |`|52UwQKmWaa	That is pretty low of you. It shows a lack of good character. Would you like it if people bashed members of your family that you looked up to? I doubt you would.|`|AA10719402	You'll grow up to be a good little conspiracy theorist.    P.S.  No he did not.    Did you kill your grandmother?  I mean.. there's nothing to prove otherwise, so you must be guilty.|`|44e4b7f98f10c547282e34b36740cb76aa	No...|`|2BdxLgO4aa	Karma is going to get you VERY badly for this one girl. |`|5TOqorawaa	No You Fool Leave Obama alone the biggest night of his life   is coming up he is taking this hard right it will be sad  if he lost. he already lost his grandmother. and it will be fuc*ed up he lost the election to the gay homo John Mccain|`|AA10071149	No, we all don't.|`|G15dXNlKaa	I doubt it. Democrats don't care about the Constitution and Congress would not force him to resign. He has not proved he is a natural born citizen and they don't care.|`|57a8b67165413ee3e594a712114ca312aa	I kind of wish he did so nobody could vote for him, but that is messed up. This question is messed up, but to answer the question NO! I am an avid Republican and would love to mess up his campaign before tomorrow, but please! Horrible, messed up question.|`|7lYxPRiQaa	He was born in America with his white mom from Kansas  No nr did not kill his granma his granma died of cancer just like his mom|`|R2MRsvVJaa	You are the ultimate poster child for abortion, your mother did the world no favor allowing the likes of you top live  You are a scumbag loser and any bad that ever befalls you you will have earned|`|DlzSQxXcaa	no,,Mc Cain DId it   !!Stop asking ,,"BuSh Doctrine"questions.HA aha hah|`|AA12054301	Anyone can correct me if I am wrong but this was his maternal grandmother that died.  His paternal grandmother who lives in Kenya is the one who said that Obama was born in Kenya. Also I think cancer is not something you can control.   By the way you misspelled resign and maybe.  I am a strong McCain supporter, but this allegation is ridiculous.    But you are far from the only stupid person her.   Props to the liberal idiots as well you know B.R. Squidbill and questions. All three have no argument worth making and are even more stupid than they think others are.|`|MiB5fhePaa	I love it when people say, "I'm just asking."  When people say that, it's clear that they already know that what they're doing is offensive.    For a minute, I thought "rezine" was some kind of drug.  It took me some time to figure out that you meant "resign."      No, Obama did not kill his grandmother.  It's a sick thought and there is no evidence for it.
QfRWOzUWaa	This would fix most of it in less than a term:    Domestic    A. Cut Federal Income Taxes by 2 percent per year over four years, for a minimum total of 8 percent over four years.    B. Reduce Federal Government Departments in size by 4 percent each year, for a total reduction of size by 16 percent over four years.    C. Eliminate all public assistance for able-bodied recipients.

Increase the subsidies for each year the couple remains married.    L. Repatriate all illegal immigrants now incarcerated. Encourage all other illegals to self-repatriate through double taxation on wages and fines on employers.    International    A. Iraq. Send in Iraqi troops to mop up pockets of resistance. Make Iraq pay with their oil for the cost of the war. Cordon off Sadr City, force all residents to leave, then go in and mop up all resistance fighters. Divide Iraq into three to four sectors; Sunni, Shiite, Kurd, and International. Next, remove all U.S. troops after above achieved.    B. Iran. One, sanctions embargoes and mine their harbors. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out.    C. North Korea. Destroy their launching platforms, impose a Naval blockade on all goods coming in or out, except food.    D. Israel Arab Entities.

Force Mexico to pay one barrel of oil for every illegal alien in the United States of America per month.|`|hzwuqBEpaa	This is a defining time for the US.  They are no longer No1 as they believe they are.    They are LAST in enviromental policy , Massive poverty in their country and NO ONE CARES , Health care system is a JOKE , and now the government is going to save all the businesses they are in bed with.  unbelieveable.    If they don't make a change they are GONE!  and the sad thing is that they are so big that their stupidity will affect us all!    please dump the republicans  NOW , not later NOW!    _______________    I think the US is pretty awsome,  just the capital society gone mad at the top,  and unfortunatley thats the end that makes all the difference.    Money isn't everything but thats how the rest of the world views the US' take on it.    -------------------------------    would you not agree that the cause of all the problems noted above is $$        -----------------------------    the rest of the world has a saying that:  "people get the Government they deserve"     I think NO ONE deserves Bushs' governance , lets see if they change.  God I hope so.      ------    thumbs down on THE TRUTH , truth hurts.|`|kgEy8d8Gaa	r u serious????      If we pulled out of the great depression we can pull out of this.      So be more supportive and hopeful.       You seem to be a hopeless person - if you dont have any hope.       This is america, we can work out of this. It will take work but we will pull out of this.       BTW - we have always supplied a lot of jobs abroad. Almost every single major company uses workers overseas.      So be more supportive instead of making the situation seem like the USA is gonna crash and burn.             |`|9nksKk6maa	Yes, it is over for this government.    But don't rule out the American people.  We believe in freedom, both for the individual, and for the free enterprise system, and we want to get back to the Constitution and the beliefs of our forefathers.    Communist such as you, have people like me to fear.  Not the other way around.  Your governments failed, and your attempts to make the US a communist nation will also fail.    As an ex-military person (please see my profile), you will realize that you have no place in our government, and the people will take our government to task for their mistakes.  That is the problem with your form of government, your people aren't allowed to speak out against it.  We will speak out!    We will wake up and put our government back to the Constitution, because until the second coming, and God's government is put in place, the Constitution is the best form of Government man can come up with.|`|e90176c07b1407c7ff422c7f67eba392aa	Over? That's a bit inflamatory, but I get your point.    I think when Bush took office, we started on a download slope that we may never recover from. We may actually still be the strongest, richest, most charitable country in the world, but I'm not sure we'll ever regain the lead we once had.    When Clinton was in office, the U.S. was dominant in a number of areas. We were the only real super power. Now Russia and China have realized that the U.S. is just a bad president away from becoming a bully. We were the shining beacon of democracy. After the Bush/Gore election and the partisan politics of this nightmare administration, the U.S. political system has become a punchline around the world. Financially, I don't think I need to go into how far we've fallen.    America is probably still the best country in the world. But we're not so far ahead anymore. And we might actually lose our lead altogether one day.    We need more patriotism. But not the type of patriotism that we've had up 'til now. Patriotism isn't just waving the flag and criticising anyone who points out flaws in the system. Patriotism is loving your country, acknowledging the flaws, and rolling up your shirt sleeves and fixing them.  |`|0jmVA50Jaa	America is strong and full of knowing that times will get better.  The Republican Party, almost took us way down, but now they are working hard to turn their greed around.    Yes, we have faith, that Senator Barak Obama will bring better times for all of us.  He is Fair, Kind, Honest and Friendly.  He will bring Peace and bring good communications to all other countries.   He is well liked and will bring Peaceful Negotiations to all Foreign Countries.     We have been through difficult times, before, and pulled ourselves out of deep **** and we can do it again with Senator Barak Obama and Senator Joe Biden, leading the way.   God Bless the United States of America.  |`|fWrygrgMaa	Not yet. We still need socialized health care and a few more environmental restrictions, then we'll be done.|`|alKMvKvWaa	How about you worry about the thousands of infants in China who were poisoned by your country's baby formula.....|`|JLy1cZVpaa	If we dont buy stuffs from walmart...........u people go hungry.|`|G3EHDf11aa	the farther we get away from a free market system, the more trouble we'll be in. This socialism of our economy and our lives has been a failure at every turn. Socialism does not work. We are probably screwed because too many people want the government to provide everything for us for "free."    All the government should provide us is an unfettered path to live our lives and strive to be what we can be, not provide us cradle to grave benefits. The government sucks|`|Oa2q6DFYaa	You're probably heard the saying 'Its not over til the Fat Lady sings' well there are many singing 'the End Is Near' now!|`|JQyA0cSKaa	i think our beloved country is on a downward spiral due to the lack of patriotism and not buying made in USA products anymore  and even though george bush did cause us a lot of problems we need to stop throwing him under the bus for everything and i personally hate bush but he is our commander in chief and people must respect that

They have said things that I can't even comprehend thinking.  They are also very self-righteous and assume that anyone who has a opinion that differs from theirs is uneducated, a sheep, brainwashed.  It's unbelievable and I fear for our country and our new president!|`|9QhUzgLmaa	Muh Ha Ha|`|TBjIJnWvaa	Yeah a little bit..

We are Americans! That might not mean anything to someone from Russia or Saudi Arabia, but damnit that means something to us!|`|j3nKvmNyaa	well, i'm a republican ( i'm not saying stuff like that btw) but i understand why they'd do that, they're not saying that they'd do it, but some people might get fed up, i mean....he wants to change the u.s. flag, and the national anthem, i think thats taking it a little too far, but no reps dont scare me in the least|`|I8Xwe16Kaa	I agree. I actually think it's sad that people can begin to think that way. One thing is to dislike obama, but to hate him without knowing him? I wonder if it's due to poor education.|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	They are just upset  I was upset when Bush won.|`|d30bfaf5425d2cf9c1ba97361dd5d4d2aa	It scary both ways. I was in a conversation about the election that I didn't bring up and the "black woman" said in front of another "black woman" that people have been talking about if he gets elected and he gets assassinated, that they "WOULD BURN THIS COUNTRY TO THE GROUND" so what is the worst of the two evils?

It is time for them to become Americans because there is great diversity in America.|`|bC04obPkaa	No.     A. I've been to presidential events and know no one is getting past the Secret Service these days. It's not like the 60's.    B.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to understand why they feel the way they do about certain issues... but I simply cannot.  I was born and raised in one of the most liberal, democratic states, Massachusetts.    I wish the parties could understand each other more, rather than just saying "that party sucks, because they do!"|`|AA11944813	No, Because the Democrats scare me worse in not realizing what Obama's past is.

First he picked Sarah Palin which was political suicide for him. Secondly some of his supporters were ignorant and selfish.

LOSERS!!!!|`|75BaN3R3aa	No but uninformed Democrats do.The Majority of Repubs play by the rules - it was not us that threatened riots in the streets.

I hope for all our sakes we are not sorry for this move.      I agree with Dem above about how he will run us into the ground - check out the history of raising taxes in a recession - An PLEASE realize it was the DEMS that put us here with F&F.

He has the strength that our country needs, the strength that Bush took from our economy. Just my thoughts :D|`|5C4ucItpaa	You're scared of this, whereas myself and other McCain supporters are scared of the fact that Obama is associated with well known terrorists, one of which watched his children as they were growing up. He was raised muslim, was preached upon, the "pros" of hate, and wants to take away the right to bear arms (some say you can't take away the second amendment, but you can make new laws to ban weaponry-there are ways around everything). Seriously this scares me, because I think he is a terrorist who was taught well, who was taught to speak well, that is; wouldn't it have been a smart move for the terrorists to have bypassed national security, all the way to the presidency? I hope this isn't the case, but all the facts are there, if you actually look at them. I'm scared for the fact that the people may have elected someone that could do more harm than most people see he'll do. I've looked into both aspects of the presidency...one, being what I've explained, and the other, what you have explained (they've already canned two supremacists who were planning an assassination)...this election is byfar the most tense one, in the fact that either way, there will probably be violence. It is scary, and I hope that things aren't blown out of proportion too much. I was angry with the outcome of this election, but now, that I'm more calm, I really just hope that the president will do what is right, leaving all the outter bull aside, being race, religion, or whatever, and look more into the more serious issues, to make America a stronger America; as it is now, I feel that America may become weaker, just because of all the irrational behavior from personal issues between both parties.|`|VbfYf1n3aa	Repubs in general scare me a little. |`|2167d2011d7d369092bbca044839d70caa	Yes.

This is why the army of McCain voters will probably show up on election day and slam Obama. They won't put a sign on their front lawns or put stickers on their bumpers or wear T-shirts for fear that roving mobs of Obamabots and Demobots will attack them, sue them, call the cops on them, having building inspectors torture them, and run them off into the night.    No. They're just going to quietly go to the polls, vote secretly (which thankfully we have a constitutional right to do) and pull the lever on McCain's side of the balance sheet.    Then what? All of your making fun of McCain and people that seem to be supporting him, even when they ask a simple question or give their opinion will come crashing down on you. Just like Pelosi stood up there during the voice vote and castigated Republicans when the blame was equally if not more on the Democratic side of the aisle.     Typical Demobots. Have no shame, take no blame, its all the same and always lame.    How about Ayers dude? Is Ayers an unrepentent terrorist who wanted to blow up the capitol and white house? Yes, yes he is. Did Obama hang out with him? Darn skippy.    Did Joe the Plumber do anything to you or anyone else, other than express his concerns and opinions in a civilized manner? No. He was acting appropriately. And now he's being attacked by people who hate McCain.    So because he asked Obama a question, and had the temerity to ask Obama a question, you want to throw him on the BBQ pit and skewer him.    Sheesh! Now I know. |`|AA12261133	i tip my hat to you, as you are clearly a gentleman and a scholar.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	I hear he has changed his name aover 17 times and holds congress with a Mason.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	LOL!

This is getting funnier by the minute, a guy who is obviously in the tank for McCain, turns out to lay out this nonsense story, he clearly is going to pay less taxes under Obama than McCain, and turns out he isn't even registered to vote, and now turns out he may be closely conntected to Charles Keating, a relative of Robert Wurzelbacher of Cincinnati, Ohio, who happens to be Charles Keating's son-in-law and a big Republican donor. They've also found at least 4 companies registered in Joe's name right in Cincinatti dealing in construction, painting, investments, and and repair of septic tanks. Hardly an average Joe

In just a few days millions of Americans will go to the polls to cast their vote in the most historic election in our lifetime.  Your vote is your voice, and it's up to you to make sure that it is heard on November 4th.    With unprecedented numbers of voters expected to head to the polls, you should consider early voting or vote by mail options if they are available in your state.  Otherwise, you can expect the lines to be long. Nevertheless, don't be discouraged. Instead, be prepared.  Bring a book, water and even a folding chair if you must. But whatever you do, get in line and stay in line. We do it for concert tickets and the latest gadgets, now we must do it for something that really matters. Our future!     Once you head to the polls, know that the NAACP and its coalition partners are doing everything within our power to ensure that your vote is protected and counted. As we have in the past, the NAACP is partnering with state and local organizations, legal advisors, and community and faith leaders, in conjunction with our 1,700 branches across the country to ensure the integrity of the voting process. We will be especially focused on 750 precincts where there has been a history of voting problems.     The NAACP believes the promise of this nation can be made real for all of us and it begins with voting. At the same time, the NAACP will not tolerate violence or tactics to suppress vote. If you experience any problems at the polls or have questions before Nov. 4, call (866) OUR-VOTE for immediate assistance. While the NAACP will do everything we can to ensure that your vote counts, the success of this effort is in your hands -- you must get out and vote!

Would that satisfy the conspiracy theorists?  No.    Suppose there were a conspiracy and that is revealed.  Would that satisfy the theorists?  No, again.  They would look for a bigger picture.    The only thing that I know of that was ever resolved completely is the riot at the 1968 democratic national convention.  After several years it was definitively classified a police riot, where the constabulary went out of control.|`|AA11744200	If they reveal no conspiracy happened will that ruin your day?|`|XuYPddLuaa	Hopefully! I have my fingers crossed. Obama will probably look into it + Biden was hinting about it. I head Bush actually apologized to one of his ppl for what's going to come out. If Mccain had won, no offense, I wouldn't have much faith in knowing the truth. But Obama seems like a person for justice so yeah : ) Maybe they'll have strong enough evidence to build a case on him. |`|NS0LjZ68aa	Apparently, you haven't read the 9-11 Commission's report!  There was no conspiracy.  Just google the report dude.  This is really old news..like two years ago news.       Yes, it was well planned by Al Queda who took responsibility for it.

Even if there was some sort of conspiracy, I don't think we could deal with it right now.  We have real problems to fix.      I don't like Bush, and I believe he was the worst President in modern times. But I think we need to move on and solve the country's problems.     I don't think our country could handle the investigation, etc. etc.       We need to move on.

He is most definitely a U.S. citizen because he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on August 4, 1961. Hawaii became the 50th state of the USA on August 21, 1959. That's almost two years before he was born.    Yes he lived with his mom and step-father in Indonesia for a few years as a child. But he returned to the USA to live with his grandparents at the age of 10. His mother's foreign marriage may have entititled Barack to have Indonesian citizenship by default - but this would never have affected his U.S. citizenship at all.     It is a common myth that gaining another citizenship will automatically cancel out the other one - this doesn't happen. Even if Indonesia didn't allow child dual-citizenship the United States wouldn't recognize that Barack had the intent to give up his citizenship unless he had physically walked into the American Embassy and renounced his citizenship in person before a consular officer. Which never happened. :-)|`|NqNbIp2caa	Let's wait and see if it actually happens - somehow I don't think it will.    You state numerous "facts" yet provide a source for none of them.  1. Going to school somewhere does not automatically make you a citizen. And becoming a citizen of Indonesia does not stop him becoming president.  2. Please provide any evidence that in 1981 Pakistan was limiting visas only to those muslims - I sincerely doubt that. Whatsmore - this would not prove he used an Indonesian passport - there are millions of American muslims and millions of Indonesian Hindus. Please also provide any evidence that Indonesian passports require updating every 5 years - again this is extremely unlike the norm.    Factcheck is owned by the Annenberg Foundation. Yes they did sponsor the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, but far more to the point they were founded and owned by lifelong Republican and Nixon appointee Walter Annenberg. It's current chair and president is his widow who has publicly endorsed McCain  To try to present them as a leftist organisation goes beyond ridiculous. Whatsmore the statement (again unsupported) that the Annenberg foundation donated to Obama's campaign is nonsense. A google search for "Annenberg donation Obama" produces no matches to support such a statement. Had the Annenberg foundation donated to a policital campaign that would be a breach of thier tax free charity status.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Phil Berg's lawsuit is rubbish.  Have you read the complaint and the answer?  The guy is in so far over his head that he'll be lucky not to drown.  He lacks standing to sue, and the evidence he intends to submit is mostly inadmissible hearsay.    The people who believe this kind of nonsense will not be satisfied no matter what proof you show them, because they're convinced that they know the "truth."  Obama has already produced his birth certificate, but he doesn't have an obligation to send an official copy to every moron who demands one.    Edit:  You have proof that Obama ever had Indonesian nationality?  The only "proof" I've ever seen was Obama's school registration form, which his step-father filled out.  As far as I am aware, it is not possible to change citizenship based on a school registration form.    The Indonesian Nationality Law lays out the methods by which a person may acquire Indonesian citizenship.  At the time Obama was registered for school, it would not have been possible under the law of the time for him to be an Indonesian citizen.  Indonesian citizenship may have been completely unavailable to Obama, since neither of his birth parents were Indonesian citizens and his mother Ann Dunham never acquired Indonesian citizenship.    You're talking nonsense, man.|`|9kd7FGk5aa	You want me to finish your science fiction story, well I'm sorry but I believe Obama could not have made it this far with out being a US citizen.

He won't answer any question in a straight forward way, basically he aggravates the hell out of me because he won't go into detail with any answer to any question.    I don't like his misleading statements and also the promises he is making are impossible to keep especially given the economic meltdown.    I am going to vote for John McCain.

IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER AFTER BARACK OBAMA'S MOTHER AND FATHER DIVORCED, THAT OBAMA'S MOTHER MET AND MARRIED AN INDONESIAN MAN AND MOVED TO INDONESIA WITH BARACK, AND HAD A DAUGHTER WITH THIS INDONESIAN MAN. LATER BARACK WHO WAS STILL A CHILD WAS SENT TO LIVE WITH HIS MOTHER'S PARENTS AND WAS RAISED IN HAWAII.

j1teGwiBaa	While the republicans do not have a monopoly on greed. I do see a consistent pattern of defensiveness.     Republicans seem more concerned with protecting exiting wealth than the well being of there fellow Americans. one of the pillars of republican ideology is the theory of trickle down economic. While its a compelling theory it has not yielded results, but instead has lead to a widening economic gap which in it self disputes the theory. Despite this evident failure the policies supporting it have continued.     As the gap widens the least of the rich are increasingly in peril of falling into the gap while the middle class are constantly being pushed into the depths of poverty. hence the shrinking middle class. both of these groups are up in arms. The rich defending there right to maintain the life style they've worked so hard to build are seen as greedy and the middle to lower income people watching there opportunity for a better life recede ever faster each year are perceived as looking for a handout.    ---    Whats more alarming is the consistently negative reaction on the part of republicans when face with criticism of there party or candidate. A more productive use of those energies might be to present a logical argument in defense of there candidate/ideology/party/policy.    This reactionary approach can be explained by the fan syndrome. As any sports fan knows criticizing a friends team inevitably leads to protracted argument with neither side willing to acknowledge the merit of there opponents argument to the point of illogicality. "Fans" are almost never persuaded by argument and rarely convinced by even the most dramatic failures/defeats.    While this "Team" sprite is commendable and has served the republicans well it inevitably leads to the "Fans" supporting the "Team" in spite of its failing. Its time to take a look at what will benefit America as a whole and not let party affiliation guide us into a repeat of the same policies that have put us here in the first place.   |`|NvW6voPJaa	Wow!  I couldn't agree more!  Very well said.  Have you thought about going into politics?    The biggest thing that struck me in your statement is...."the gap between the rich and the poor is getting larger every year."  SO TRUE!      I live in Michigan.....the state that is feeling the brunt of the economic disaster in this country the worst.  People are leaving the state in droves.  No jobs.  No homes.  So....now what does that do to our tax base....i.e., school funding?  The children will ALL suffer.  And, for what?  Corporate GREED!

Thank you for posting this.    Incidentally, I'm a stay-at-home-mother and my husband, our sole source of support (I have an autistic child who makes conventional day care arrangements very difficult so getting a job outside of the house has never been viable), makes about 60K.  We have a family of four.  I don't have to tell you what kind of financial position that puts us in.  But you know what?  I gave a homeless man five dollars today because he needed it more than I did.  Because I did it, I had to put something back at the grocery store.

In the primary debates Obama stated that he'd tax people making 90,000 a year    90,000? that's not rich, that's middle class.. with inflation and prices rising people can bearly get by.. now he is move it up to 250,000    I think it's great to tax the the rich and I agree with your premise, but Obama has changed his position, so I'm unsure whether I trust him.. |`|29QuImNwaa	Thank you so much for this. I though that this would finally get through to some, but I guess not. Can't say you didn't try! Their comments support your question though!  It is not a matter of being lazy and recieving handouts.  Do you all have ANY compassion whatsoever? You must be very sheltered people. Most of the country does NOT make 250+  A lot of people make just enough to buy the essentials. This is not doing much for our economy. Think of your tax raise (if it even affects you) as an investment. If you pay a little more now, the middle class might have a little extra money to be able to go to school and get higher paying jobs. In turn they can use this extra money to invest, buy houses, or other things to stimulate the economy. Then this money +more makes its way back to you.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	I find it amazing how Democrats ignore empirical evidence.    To have a strong and well educated nation, you have to get the economy and education as far removed from D.C. as possible.  "Trickle down" is a derogatory name Democrats applied to reality. During the Reagan administration, revenue to the treasury doubled, GDP growth, real wage growth and every other indicator of economic strength shot through the roof. Employment and real wages grew most for minorities and the poor, about 80% of whom moved out of the bottom quintile. Fully 1/4 of those in poverty in 1980 were in the TOP quintile by 1988. Democrats hate that a LOT. Poverty is supposed to be permanent after the trillions they spent to make it so.  We've also done it your way. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment ALL in double-digits isn't what conservatives have in mind when you say, "raise up those in need" but apprently, that's what Democrats mean.    A pause to examine this brace of sentences:  "It seems that greed is the fuel of the modern day Republican party. The biggest red state is also one of the poorest."  Yeah. You really typed that.    I invite you to download and read Obama's tax plan. If you haven't noticed the following read it again:  Every reference to tax cuts is based on comparison to 1990s rates. What about the few of us so unfortunate as to be paying taxes in 2008 instead of 1998? We ALL get a tax INCREASE. Kindly explain how vacuuming the wallets of the middle class will "stimulate" them?    From what you typed, I know you can find demographic data. Therefore, I can assume you KNOW that on average, conservatives absolutely kick liberals' buttocks with respect to charitable giving. I infer therefore that you define "greed" as making direct benefit where it's needed instead of filtering the money through D.C.  Oh, My mistake. You think there can be such things as "free" health care and college. In your imagination, is it magical fairies that provide these things or is it elves?  The "gap between the rich and the poor" is reliably blurred when conservative (aka reality based) economics are applied. I refer you back to the 1980s numbers of unprecedented poor-to-rich mobility.  Over most of the 20th Century, poverty rates fell steadily and the numbers of individuals in persistent poverty fell even faster right up until "The Great Society" was implemented. AFTER that, the poverty rate stopped declining and the "permanent underclass" became a fixture of the American economy. Good job liberals. How compassionate of you.    I apologize for the disjointed flow. I was following the format of the question.      I really doubt the statistical abstract has a memory lapse. Under Clinton the economy tanked until GOP '94 won Congress. At the end of his term, he released "revised numbers" showing there was no surplus; that he had actually ruptured the budget as badly as every other administration.  As for what you call "trickle down economics" there has never been a time when it failed to yield improvement on the economic curve. Not once. Recessions: most recent and back: Post '06 election, Post Clinton interest rate hike, Post GH Bush tax INCREASE, Carter administration . . .I can go on . . None relate to conservative policy implementation.  I invite you to check the abstracts for "80s" data. It was an unprecedented boom.   In countries like Canda, Denmark, and Austrailia, people flee to the U.S. if they can for life-saving care. People DIE for want of procedures available same-day in the U.S.|`|aFnXBpi7aa	I'm glad that some of us have brains ;D |`|c0fded412e2f6885dbe299e7d76531f3aa	Amen!  Very well said!  I totally agree with you.  It astounds me that people who make so much money gripe about paying a bit more taxes.  How much "stuff" do people really need?  I know a man who makes about $500,000 a year and gets 1 million dollar bonuses (guess what, he's a banker and a Republican!) and he never donates anything to anyone yet he has 5 cars -- 4 of which sit in the garage all the time.  He has about 40 watches -- what does he need all this stuff for?  If he paid more taxes it would just mean he could buy one less gold watch per year.  Boo hoo, poor him!

I know how McCain has stood by Bush the past 8 except when he was campaigning of course.  |`|AA11575292	what happen if McCain is elected and a lot of people have no health insurance.? |`|HdgA8pLqaa	I remember when Clinton was elected in 1992.  As soon as he won, the Repubs came up with, "He didn't even get 50% of the vote."      While true (Clinton had 43% & Bush Sr. 37%), it was because there was a strong 3rd candidate,  Ross Perot, who received 19% of the vote.    As soon as Clintons moved into the White House, the Repubs threw up roadblocks fast & furious.  They opposed the changes Clinton had promised before the election and they kept setting up investigations.  Remember Travelgate?  White Water?  All of those millions of dollars spent and nothing could be found against Clinton.  So many of his appointments were investigated that he had trouble filling positions because they couldn't afford to pay their attorney bills.  (The gov't didn't always pay).        The Repubs even brought the gov't to a halt over the budget.  Clinton wouldn't blink, though, and they ended up backing off.  In fact, it was during this time that Monica had access to the White House.  What Clinton did with her was absolutely 100% wrong but a lowly intern would never had had evening access if the gov't had been running as usual.  (There had been temporary layoffs  and so interns were used in certain jobs - no not THAT kind! - instead of the regular White House employees).      When any president is elected, there's always grumbling from the other political party but what happened after Clinton was elected was on an entirely new level.        The reason I'm talking about Clinton is because I  have no doubt all of this will happen again if Obama is elected.        Just ONCE, I wish the losing party would work WITH the incoming President instead of against him.  It will be a new administration and the slate will be clean.  I wish they would think of the country instead of their own political party.  And I also mean this if McCain wins - we've got to pull together.|`|qfS0tJDNaa	End of the world.|`|zl5eZN6zaa	When i read, and see whats happening as of late to the rat ship of a campaign called Obama/Biden 08, and the abandonment of credible "elite", it is strange to me that CLG Founder and Chair Michael Rectenwald, Ph.D just dumps on flips out over this empty suit a.k.a.

But, even if he were 100% white and had a name like Smith or Jones, the Republicans would think of something.  After all, look at what happened to Democrats in 2000 and 2004.  In 2004, Kerry was white, a war hero even!  But what did they do?  They actually got veterans of the same war in which Kerry was wounded and decorated to lie about his record in order to diminish the impact of his three (yes three) Purple Heart medals.  In 2000, against another white man, they couldn't think of anything Gore's name rhymed with or any good lies about his military service (another veteran), but they did manage to screw with the voting machines in Florida and the ballots.  Disenfranchised a whole lotta people most of whom, strangely enough, were Democrats.  Strange how that turned out in a state governed by the brother of the fellow running on the Republican ticket for president.  Mighty strange indeed.|`|jtemGznHaa	I don't know who these people are who say Obaama is a terrorist. But that being aside, white or black a threat is still a threat and hate is still hate. I do not want a president who thinks it is okay to associate with them and then when called on it (just like the lawyer he is) deny that it's not what people think or know to be the truth.|`|AA12261074	Yep still terrorist even if he was white    Unabomber and Timothy Mc Veigh both white both terrorists  skin color doesn't matter |`|Zxl4fec2aa	Yes. There have been many white terrorists too so skin color is secondary.    Much of the older population still hold on to the racial discrimination days of their time. It is unfortunate they still harbor some of that negative sentiment.   It is very unfortunate that many people today, in this time and day, don't realize that we are all human beings and skin color is just another attribute that makes each of us unique. Just like eye color and height.  
4s9OvB4eaa	She has hunted moose and field dressed them - there was a story a while back about animal rights people worried that she was in favor of some deal where hunting of wolves from helicopter was taking place to control population, I believe.|`|lWZi2p70aa	She approved aerial wolf hunting which is not the same thing.  At least at this point the State Department of Fish and Game is careful to not let wolves be over-hunted.  The idea is to suppress wolf predation so human predation can increase and keep things balanced.      Helicopters are a horrid way to suppress predators.  They get wise to the rotor beat and hide, and you fix a helicopter  for 4 hours for every hour you ride.  I saw a Piper Super Cub outfitted with semi-auto shotguns on the wing struts, four in all, collimated to converge at 105 yards, and there was a circle on the windshield that an average wolf would fill at 105 yards.  00 Buckshot was used.  Now that is efficient except you have to land to reload every three wolves.     But Sarah Palin personally shooting wolves from a helicopter?  Not likely.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Can we all just let Sarah Palin have a rest,if she hunts from a Jet it makes no difference,if she eats Moose thats fine too,rumors are like wildfire they spread and destroy everything in its path and for no reason what-so-ever!

I would think not.  Fact is that 1/3 of the voters in states that allow early voting already voted and that the democrats outnumber repubs by 12-1---and so I don'[t think that people will just go vote for Obama because his grandmother died---I feel bad for him because to see him win would have been the crowning of her life--and he knows it.|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	Maybe a few...This is a man who called his grandmother a "typical white person" and he threw her under the bus...She is now at peace with the Lord...I cannot extend my sympathies to a Marxist.

LMgUpEgjaa	I think that the GOP controls Hannity, O'Reilly and the Fox so called news. It is a well known fact that Bush gave Fox news press releases before any other news station.  I don't know much about Rush. I tend to avoid listening to people who spout negativity and try to distort reality to suit their own agenda.  The News broadcasters are suppose to be a watchdog for the people by the people but this type of news propaganda we are better off without.   I like to do my own thinking and I want religion and government kept separate.    Obama & Biden|`|OzoZ4LL0aa	They seem to just be a voice of the working people.  People that look at it from a reality point of view verses the blinders on type of view.  They do wish to keep America a free nation instead of a socialist state.  Nice to see someone will speak out for the rest of us that have to work so hard to keep up.|`|IiQNfmhhaa	They are certainly not in the 9% that approve of congress!    Rush and Hannity don't control the GOP. If they did John McCain would not be the Repubican candidate. McCain is the most liberal candidate the GOP has nominated in recent years. But he is conservative compared to Obama.    Rush and Hannity only report the other side of the story that mainstream media refuses to report. Most media people are elitist and know what is good for the American people. The mainstream media is in the tank for Obama.  They want to take care of us since we are soooo naive.  Rush and Hannity know that American people are some of the most intelligent and kind people in the world, capable of taking care of themselves.    Most media believe to a great extent in the ideas of Saul Alinksy. Read him and make up your OWN MIND! Journalism is dead in America.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Control?    No.    20%? Last I saw, Bush supporters where in the teens, not 20%.    The person who said they speak for the majority are living in fantasy-land, not the real world. Most Americans are liberal in their views.|`|Qjb1qRbYaa	There are a hell of a lot more than 20% of conservatives who still support Bush.  The media chooses to poll who they want to so they can get the result they want.    Rush and Hannity have two of the largest listening and viewing audiences for a reason.  The conservative movement is growing.  Unlike what the media wants you to believe.  We aren't going anywhere!|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Hannity supports Bush.  Rush does not.    They don't run the GOP, but they are strong voices of the silent majority of Americans. |`|TD9T9dNlaa	 nope---I like alot of what the GOP stands for- but as long as the ultra-right and "christians" control it, I can never support them|`|REiQzRB3aa	Supporting someone is merely saying you agree with them. Hannity, Rush, and many other conservatives don't agree with Bush all the time. Most of what he has done recently has been against the conservative ideology and people still call Bush a conservative when he never has been. He is a typical new age republican, not a Reagan conservative. I bet you didn't know that Bush had an approval rating that bounced around 38% and 50% up until 2 years ago. That's actually not bad compared to many of the other presidents. Then, the past 2 years when the democrats took over Congress to work with, Bush hasn't been able to accomplish much and ended up with an approval rating down in the 20th percentile. So when you give a president with 38%-50% approval rating a 9% approval rated Congress, you can only expect his approval rating to drop as well. Hannity and Rush are just journalists who happen to be conservatives, so what - they will admit and tell you today that they only approve 75%-85% of what Bush does, and I would tend to agree.

hMl6pQ7zaa	I agree with her. It's a fact that the Earth does go through global warming/cooling without anyone doing anything to cause it. I do think that we should try to stop pollution, but I don't think we cause so much of it. Also, nobody gave a care about global warming until Gore came out with the 'inconvenient truth.'   The press is always attacking Palin and criticizing every word she says, but they say nothing about Biden and his fat mouth, do they? He said that "Roosevelt got on TV when the stock market crashed" but 1.) there was no TV and 2.) Roosevelt was NOT president back then. The press didn't do anything about him!  I have great respect for Mrs. Palin and when the press does that to her, it ticks me off. And the comment Oprah made about her not ever having Palin on her show, that was out of line. She needs to keeps stupid comments like that to herself. Who would want to watch her lame show anyways?  People need to research some of the things they say. McCain DOES want renewable energy to clean the air. Anyways, McCain would be a great president because he has been to war. Obama hasn't. Plus, McCain was a POW and he knows what it's like in war.   McCain-Palin 2008!!|`|dgbz5CvBaa	If u take a decent Geology course u will find out dat global warming does not exist.

His plan says that he will cut taxes.Whether or not he would do that as president is something that we don't know,but that is his plan as of now    McCain and Palin have been lying about it for months now.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	If you want to define socialism (incorrectly) as "spreading the wealth," so be it - but by that definition youre also calling Warren Buffett, Ronald Reagan, John McCain, and Sarah Palin socialists as well.    Why?    - Warren Buffett has come out publicly in support of Obama.  - Ronald Reagan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (the single most wealth-redistributive policy in the history of our tax code); also, the highest tax bracket under Reagan was 50% - the highest bracket in Obamas proposed plan is 39.6%.  - John McCain has publicly supported the EXACT same tax policy that he is NOW calling "socialist."  Don't believe me?  See for yourself:     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYsF1Mer...    - Sarah Palin imposed a windfall profits TAX on oil companies in Alaska, and cut a $1,200 check to every Alaskan with the proceeds.  If that's not "SPREADING THE WEALTH," I don't know what is.    John McCain is depending on the ignorance and intellectual laziness of the American people.  Without it, he doesn't stand a chance.  |`|EPqnB7Epaa	Remember the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?  It didn't work out too well for them.

The reason why America has the largest economy in the world is because of capitalism. Capitalism is also the reason why poor people in America has roofs over their heads, ipods, cellphones, etc.. In socialist countries, the poor have nothing.    The founders of this country were strong capitalists. They valued the works of Adam Smith and other writers.     It was Madison ("Father of the Constitution" ) who wanted the Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" to be added to the proposed "Library of Congress".|`|61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	Considering the current US systems has more socialistic than capitalist, then I would say that the US currently believes socialism is better then capitalism.    Funny.... how people are so ignorant about capitalism.  The USA is not truly a capitalistic country.  There is no free-market here in the USA.  If there was, Wal-Mart would out-compete any local mom and pop business.  The US would not have tariffs on foreign imports.  There would be no regulations to hinder companies....

However, ne-socialism such as French Socialism is far superior to New-Capitalism, which is the system we are currently suffering under right now.|`|AA11980369	Socialism is an old form of government that gives everyone "what they need" and no more. It means you will never become rich: the government will take your wealth from you. So, If you get the winning lottery ticket, kiss it goodbye. It also means you will never go hungry and you won't have to work very hard to get your basic needs fulfilled. But, if you ever want to have a better life than the one you have, too bad for you. It will never get better either. Eventually, the government has much power, wealth, and prestige and the population just "barely" has "enough". Socialism doesn't work because it does not reward hard work so why would anyone work hard? No one invents things. No one is very happy with unending problems that don't get fixed.  Capitalism frees people to work at a dream and watch it come true. You can become wealthy from your ideas and hard work. Your inventions and ideas are used by the whole world. the world becomes a better place. The problem is that too much wealth usually means too much power and corruption, so unless laws are put through to keep that in balance, capitalism is not perfect, either. And again, if you are lazy or do not want to work, you will suffer in poverty. But at least you have the freedom to choose to be poor. In American society, we do not want to see anyone suffer and the line between helping people and doing it for them is often blurred.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	We have lots of examples of Socialist governments.

He has raised taxes on people making $42,000 a year so unless you make $41,000 your screwed.  But if he really does do that it is stupid in my opinion, they already pay 36% of their income to taxes, that's ridiculous. And his amount would be over $200,000-$250,000(he has said both those numbers), then he would raise your taxes.    Someone said something about "Joe the plumber"....If he got his plumbers license and his own plumbing business he could make that much money.....my grandfather was a plumber and had his own business and he made that much money, and he worked his butt off. Why should they be punished for having a dream? Take their hard earned money away? Yeah, that makes sense. I bet of you made that much though you wouldn't want to be taxed even more then everyone else. Personally I think it should be a set percent for everyone, because the rich would still pay more, but not a ridiculous amount, and the poor would still pay less.|`|0dQP8CZ7aa	Trickle down, is Socialism..  amazing how well trained you've all been.

They are making more money, they can afford giving a little bit more back in taxes. Someone making $30K shouldn't have the same amount of taxes removed from someone making $250k.  What if that person making $30k is working on improving them self, going to college to become something bigger.  How about teachers? They don't make that much money a year but are so instrumental in our society that to tax them the same amount as someone that makes more than them isn't fair to them what so ever and not fair for the rest making $30k. Not everyone is able to go to college or afford it or have the mentality to go there. College isn't for everyone, so does that mean they shouldn't be able to have benefits that others do? Sounds greedy to me!

kxEl2TvRaa	It's perfectly legal for him to be carrying the firearm with a permit, but HOW he did it is technically illegal- NYS is NOT an "open carry" state for handguns. However, during hunting season most LEOs don't have a problem with hunters doing it while hunting. In NYS ALL handguns carried out in public MUST be concealed and the carrier MUST have a CC permit. Him carrying in a "grocery store" is NO different than him doing it in a hardware store, barber shop, clothing store, etc. The main places off-limits in NYS are courthouses, jails, secure government buildings, airports (beyond the TSA check-points), bars, schools/colleges, & secure mental health facilities.    S. J : You wrote-  "It is totally illegal. And as a result, no-one needs to."  &  "It is important to realize that if no-one is armed there is no need for anyone to BE armed.  That's hard for an American to understand, but it's true."  You are incorrect. Why, well several reasons-  - Firearms are NOT just for defense against other firearms, but also knives, baseball bats, vehicles, sheer phsyical size, scissors, broken bottles, metal pipes, rocks, pitch forks etc. Has Canada also banned all of them so they can't be used as weapons too? - 90% of ALL violent crimes in the U.S. are NOT commited with a firearm, instead they use the items above, and more. That means that only 1 in 10 crimes uses a firearm. Also in >80% of crimes where the perpetrator possessed a firearm, they did NOT use it in any way.  - Firearms are also used against dangerous wildlife, and don't try to tell me that Canada doesn't have them.    See also-  http://www.gunfacts.info/  Myth: Countries with strict gun control have less crime  Answer: FALSE- In Canada around 1920, before there was any form of gun control, their homicide rate was 7% of the U.S rate. By 1986, and after significant gun control legislation, Canadas homicide rate was 35% of the U.S. rate  a significant increase. In 2003, Canada had a violent crime rate more than double that of the U.S. (963 vs. 475 per 100,000). The crime rate is 66% higher in four Canadian prairie provinces than in the northern US states across the border.    Canada's Crime Rate 50 % Higher than U.S.  http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2...  'He also cites the most recent complete data available from both countries that shows that in 2003, the violent crime rate in the United States was 475 per 100,000 people; while up north, there were 963 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The figure for sexual assault in Canada per 100,000 people was more than double that of the United States: 74 as opposed to 32.1; and the assault rate in Canada was also more than twice that of the states: 746 to America's 295 for the people.    Moreover, he cites research that showed the figure for sexual assault in Canada per 100,000 people was more than double that of the United States: 74 as opposed to 32.1; and the assault rate in Canada was more than twice that of the United States: 746 to Americas 295. Also, in 2005, Toronto had 78 murders; thats a 28 percent increase in homicides since 1995."

And also we don't have the gun crime that Americans have to put up with. It is important to realize that if no-one is armed there is no need for anyone to BE armed.  That's hard for an American to understand, but it's true.

Some supporters of McCain and Palin are emphasizing Obama's middle name to play on people's fears.  It feeds into all the rumours and rhetoric that Obama is a Muslim, doesn't see the world the way the rest of Americans do, and 'pals around with terrorists' (e.g. see Scythian's answer above)|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	Yes, and there are countless mass murderers, child molesters, serial killers named John...

I think that Obama would be a good guy for the country, but his Political Experience in the National Arena isn't developed fully ,and it's hard for me to vote for a guy with a weak Political record.

They believed that he is a typical 2008 millennium black American. America is starting to see Obama is a man driven by more. He is driven by the black supremacy movement of the 1960s, because assuming that militant anger makes him feel closer to his father who abandoned him. It also gives him an emotional release in that he can blame white supremacy for his abandonment rather than his father, and he can feel closer to his father by "walking in his father's emotional footsteps" so to speak.  The addition is that Obama is also far angrier as he is avenging his childhood abandonment.  |`|AA10287176	In a way it is a good thing for Obama.

Oil prices are finally dropping just in time for the elections that are going to replace him. Coincidence? It'll go back up if his puppet gets in, then they can go back to business as usual.
dORUrbtFaa	HELLO!!!  Why does this matter. He is not applying for a job for the FBI.  He is running for presidency.|`|AA10873763	No, it's not true.

Because he was associated with former terrorists, he cannot get security clearance|`|0cYtUMuiaa	If you intend to make accusations  as you have, you may want to hire a fact-checker. You make it sound like Obama does drugs. He doesn't. He said he tried it when he was young and wreckless. McCain went to war, i refuse to believe he never tried drugs there. McCain himself admits to being wreckless in his youth.  McCain shouldn't even be qualified to be president, he was born in panama.     If Obama was half black, but looked white, and you couldn't tell, i guarantee you that you wouldn't have put this question up.  And the whole "McCain is a war hero" thing, it's not working for you republicans.      You give a bad name to republicans.  You are the terrorist, using scare tactics to get people to vote for McCain.  Newsflash: it's not going to work.  You're making the republican party look bad.  Stop before you get McCain supporters to switch sides.  Actually, keep going.  You're doing a great job.  he got captured.  he didn't try escaping.  he didn't make any "heroic" attempts to save everyone.  he stayed as a POW, without resistance attempts.|`|zqWKHbcmaa	no the cia and fbi use druggies and bad people all the time .. bin laden used to work for them    this whole election makes me feel like that TV show "24" was based on reality, and totally non fiction

baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Yes, or something similar - the poor can get healthcare, the general health improves and you make provisions for the worst off people in society.     Take for instance a sharp decline in medical research.  Which would be why a university in the UK has recently found a breakthrough treatment for alzheimers?|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	Yes, absolutely. Half the cost per capita and better results by any obejctive metric, e.g., infant mortality and life expectancy. The only reason we don't have it is because the greedy insurance companies control too many politicians, particularly Republicans. Suggest you download and watch "Sicko," it's amusing and you'll get some great facts there.|`|OtwdO39yaa	The most expensive sick care in the world can be had for a few in the USA who can afford it. It has an atrocious infant mortality record, and some of the most unhealthy children in the world. The elderly are faced with a barrage of rules and regulations and have no idea what care they are entitled to get.  The USA needs "A Health Care System"  of some type since at this time what is available is the most expensive, wasteful care for very sick people without any provisions for developing a preventative medical plan to help keep Americans fit and healthy. |`|FXZlC8XYaa	yeh and the laundry thing too, which they show it on sicko documentary by M.M|`|rJlOrKzUaa	Wikipedia would probably be a better place to get info.    I have two sets of friends in European countries (England and Germany)  Neither set of friends is really happy with their healthcare options.  They carry supplemental insurance so they can get into the best possible specialists should they ever need to.  I've heard it over and over that socialized health care is not a good idea over all.      Why do the poor always think they have no health care available?  My self employed sister has zero insurance (and zero savings) but is always able to get into the local hospital for emergency asthma assistance when she needs it.  No one is dying because they cannot get into a hospital.|`|gyyoQTXhaa	To say we don't have it only because of "greedy insurance companies control too many politicians" is ridiculous.  While socialised health care has it's benefits it also has a whole bunch of problems that come with it.   Take for instance a sharp decline in medical research. There also can be a rather long waiting period for basic medical procedures, or even important procedures. Plus it would require more funding in order to provide even the most basic coverage to people. That would require either a significant increase in *everyone's* taxes or an overhaul of current government spending, neither of which is a realistic option.  And like the person before said, we'd need to have a smaller population like Frances too for it to be feasible. |`|Xure6Nwfaa	of course! we have one of the worst healthcare systems in the world. i have friend from here, europe, and latinamerica, who have to go to europe to get treated because getting treatment here is just not the best thing, actually, the second worst in the world or something like that. the private healthcare system is good if you re healthy, and stay that way for years, but if youre sick then youre pretty much screwed. France has the second best life expectancy rates in the world, after Japan, which makes me wonder...these two countries also have the largest number of smokers in the world...look this up, doctors call this the "French paradox" I say we should have a healthcare system like that in the army, instead of spending money on things we dont need...this is why also Europeans always find cures for most diseases, their governments are pressured to find cures so they wont have to pay for their citizens coverage anymore. while in the usa, the insurance, and pharmacy companies block reasearch so they can keep making money from the population|`|3f7405e04e7fd2f458a0aec63bc0e40eaa	Capitalism usually improves the technolgy. The US has some of the most advance medical procedures. So in the extreme for the rich who can afford it in the US they'll have better health than the people in other countries. However the poorer people and lately the middle class who don't have insurance or cant pay out of pocket for medical procedures they'll overall health will be lower than the rest of the world(well not all of the world but other Industrial nations).    A Socialist healthcare would make it so more people can get health care, however people will be paying more taxes to have it. Some people argue they do not want to pay higher taxes to support a prostitute that gets an STD, or a druggie, or a person who doesn't eat healthy etc..However other argue that's a small minority and you'll be helping out a lot more people that need it.    Also the waiting time. Some people will complain that you'll have to wait longer to get treatment for minor things. My teacher is from Holland or something like that and her sister had to wait near 3 years to get knee surgery because its not consider a major life threatening procedure.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Yeah sure if we cut down our population by 50% I'm for it but since we have 6 times the number of people than France does and we don't poop out money then I don't think so. |`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Absolutely not. Few Americans would be able to understand medical forms written in French.|`|jLaDJYJRaa	No. Nationalized health care means rationalized health care. Doctors will be getting paid substantially less money and many will quit to find better paying jobs.
ktXhbE31aa	The largest we have are the Ohios, also known as "Tridents" or "Boomers". In our Navy, we have 4 classes of submarine. Ohio, which is our only class of ballistic missile boats, and Los Angeles, Seawolf, and Virginia classes, which are all "Fast Attacks". The only thing I can say for maximum depth is greater than 800 ft for all classes.|`|LUosDsYaaa	We do still have one diesel boat operating.    Our largest class of boat is the Trident. I served onboard the USS Alaska SSBN 732 for 5 years.    Among our large boats, we have had Poseidon and Polaris boats.    They each go to the bottom :)  |`|5B5pirFWaa	The US has been operating exclusively Nuclear Submarines for 20 years now. (USS Bonefish was last, caught fire in 1988, never returned to service).     The largest Class is the Los Angelas Class over 60 Units.    The Largest boat in size is the Ohio Class SSBN/SSGN.    Max operating depth of all Combat Subs is over 800', the exact is classified.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	the largest are the boomers or ohio class.    there are several different classes.    the max depth is classified for all classes|`|2qQPBDlkaa	the largest class of submarine is the Ohio or "Trident" class of SSBN     no there are several class of submarine they are broken into two basic class of subs SSBN's carry nuclear missiles and are basiclly americas "Big Stick"    SSN's are attack submarines.. their job is to go out find the other guys assets and destroy them.    the ONLY existing class of SSBN in service for the US is the OHIO    the most common SSN is the Los Angeles class  class    Max Depth is classified information and anyone who tells you what it is guessing      |`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	All nuclear boats are nuclear powered and come in all sizes from the large Ohio class to the little Skipjack class that is no longer in service. The Ohio is the largest class of sub ever built in the US navy. The largest in the world is the Russian Typhoon class they are basically two subs side by side welded together and given a hydrodynamic shaped skin. These subs can dive to 1,500 feet or more but the true depth is classified.   |`|9rEI0TnUaa	The largest is the Ohio class missle submarine.    Its diving depth is classified information.|`|FYwc4pC1aa	true 100ft|`|de4ccdea8ddfffe166a3494f3eabbce8aa	Yes they are all nuclear now but no they are not all the same. Some carry missiles, some hunt down subs carrying missiles. As for the largest, the physically largest belongs to the Russians, it is almost as big as an aircraft carrier. The missiles subs are bigger than the attack subs. A missile sub is about 300 or so feet long. Most nuclear subs can go to about 1000 feet or so. The actual depth is highly classified. Depth is not what is important, stealth and the ability to detect your opponent before they detect you is!  There are some Navies of the World that still use diesel subs, they can not go as deep nor stay down as long. Nuclear subs can make and clean their own air at depth and since they do not "burn" fuel they can stay down a LONG time!!

PS- http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/bottlene...  If you don't want to read it, basically Bush signed a bill giving Amtrak nearly 12 billion in October of 2008.

Fly?    Bus?    Car?    Train?    Now if you want to control people,  you restrict their travel.   They have ID requirements for train, plane and bus.  The only way you can move from state to state without someone being able to track you is to drive.   I would not worry about the trains, planes and buses,  I would watch very closely for any way of restricting or TRACKING your motions in cars....    Oh wait....    Read this news story......is it as up front and honest as it appears?    If they use a GPS to track your car so they can "tax" you,  can they not also use it to track your movements?

Great question, I am sure our saviors in Washington will let us know.|`|64SObnr5aa	Look towards the future    Let me put something in perspective.    I live in China as a transplanted American.  I can take the bus from one side of this city to another for slightly less then 8 cents.  It costs more money to run that bus then 8 cents per passenger, yet the government understands that it takes moving people around to help economic growth.    I can take the train, here in China, from this central part of China to Beijing for about $14.  If I want to get a sleeper, I pay about $35.  I can also take a bullet train from Shanghai to the capital of the province I live, about 1,000 miles for $40    Therefore, public transportation should not necessarily mean profit, it should be there to help economic growth and to help the people have better lives.    With that being said, in the future, when airline travel is too expensive and damaging to the environment, we will be glad we kept our train passenger system in place.

I don't think anybody needs to worry about North Korea because if we do, we'll just end up creating more havoc than necessary.  North Korea is weak and is just trying to split up the American people once again, like what happened during the second world war.  I think N.

As for the rest of your question, what you are referring to comes from the "Old Testament" and was rescinded by the "New Testament". That was due to the changes made, over the years/centuries, in the preservation of certain foods.  As for not reading the bible, please tell me where, exactly, hell is described as anything other than the grave. I have tried for years, reading through several different versions of the bible and never found that reference, or the one that describes hell as a fiery place.    PS: I hope you don't eat catfish.

Kaudz4Msaa	Yes, I think your last choice is ideal...invite third parties.    In reality, there is almost no difference between Republicans and Democrats, so they have to EXAGGERATE THEIR DIFFERENCES and play to very nuanced differences in their bases.  Of course, if you look at the extremes of the spectrum:  Christian Fundamentalist Conservatives vs. true Progressives....      Instead of focusing on issues, the public is distracted by abortion, gay marriage, gun control, and even a tax stimulus.    There should be more fundamental debate about the nature of government in this country.|`|AA10958272	Not at all -- they carved the system into 2 (themselves).    It's near impossible to develop a 3rd party (and more) because of the restrictions on ballots, primaries, getting signatures, every little nuance and nuisance that keeps people from running -- entrenched Clubs on local levels, judges in the tank, election boards owing jobs to a party 'in power', so many elected officials that aren't there for anything other than staying there and getting what they can (that's 99%).     The media took advantage of this dual BRANDING in the late-90s when cable first realized it can have and sell shows/channels -- with a NICHE viewership. Like only Democrats that watch these sort of shows... then, the rehashing & repeating of NYT columns, etc. started with yapping heads pretending they just didn't read & repeat for example a Maureen Dowd column of 2-3 days prior.. and the he/she said rehearsed HEATED debates & controversies sold entire RADIO stations -- branded both ways. They could play off each other. NPR vs. ABC, FOX vs. CNN and now MSNBC.. AP/Yahoo vs. Drudge.. just over & over, getting BRANDED PEOPLE to adhere to what THEY say vs. the created "other side". In 2000, Al Gore Jr. & GWB were the same person -- silver spoons, mega millionaires that never really HAD to work, but set up by electorate Name recognition. Gore dropped the Jr. just before the election, since he didn't need it after 30-45 years of using it back home where dad was a media kingpin (and reported Southern Dem segregationist, to be nice).     Micheal Moore made $130mil within a few months with a position-piece movie vs. the Iraq war and this BRANDED industry bloomed. Al Gore didn't waste much time looking for another ISSUE movie, for the same money -- and won an Oscar, too. More BRANDING, Hollywood style. Now issues separate people, not just the Party BRANDING. (Can a GOPer believe in Global Warming? How could any Dem not? just like THAT.) And on we twist. Partisan thought, created and marketed to.. Stimulus Package? good for Dems by Dems, bad by GOPers. Will it work? that's less important.. because one side says there's no pork, and everyone falls in line... anyone says there is? they're awful GOPers, siding with each other and little angry pissants...     There goes another $800 BILLION -- and shared among their lobbyists, pork projects and locales... they're the same, just using their media to make us, at home, believe there's some difference. After the BILLIONS thrown-away in the SCARE pre-election that were at the worst of times, since the Depression (not exactly). BILLIONS given to bankers, brokers, and for what? for a chance to do the same? now? no accountability -- and no problem for the copy/paste media, that doesn't really WANT to work and research and write.

Finally! A distant echo of wisdom dwarfs to silence the endless, mindless roar of illusion.     The Party Machine has adulterated the simplest truth.     TV news, newspapers, magazines and every existing outlet avoids relevance and contextual-accuracy like the plague, spouting, instead, the same pointless nonsense like:     candidate X perspired during a debate  had a five-o'clock shadow  pointed  blinked  pointed with his/her thumb  allowed a band-member to nod his/her head    Have we ever seen any news-source attach itself to the topic of the Incumbent Congress?     Has any ever gone on at length, day after day, comparing how similar we voters are (regardless of party)?    -- how similar those in Congress are (regardless of party)? and - MOST IMPORTANTLY -   -- how different WE are from the Congress?     Nope.     Thank you so much for asking!!    =====    As to the abolition of parties, I would love it. But, given the power to abolish any party, government will adjudge the People as a party and silence us, too.     As such, I prefer an "Unconscionable-Items Citizens'-Veto Amendment" that would restore our power to usurp despot-leaning government.     It may seem complicated but, compared to the average law/bill Congress slams on our heads without our knowledge, it's very terse and simple.    From each lower house district :  - select, at random, a hundred (est) voters ("Jury Congress"  [or 'JC'])  - inform them of the item in question  - provide inclusive, yet brief, documents/videos of all concerns   - permit members of "Jury Congress" (JC) specific time to digest info  - require each to demonstrate an understanding of the issues at hand (educators do this all day long and know about standard deviations, standardized testing, its flaws, its weaknesses, strengths, effectiveness, etc)  - set the curve so that at least 80% - on the average - pass by the second try.     When the 80% have passed, they vote strictly on whether the item is conscionable or unconscionable.     Just like Congress, each district has one vote*. If two-thirds vote against an item, it's toast.     ...       [one vote is defined as a majority of those in that District's JC, who've demonstrated a reasonable grasp of the item's content, reasons for and against, as well as other pertinent concerns]|`|AA10250939	No they did not divide the nation.

However, even if they had, there is something called 'tyranny of the majority' when the majority tries to take rights of the minority.  To prevent that we have something called a Constitution.  I forsee many court battles over this, but the basic plan is that you need a 2/3 majority, not 60 % to alter the basic structure of our country, for good reason.    And only 52% of those who either voted for Obama or McCain  voted for Obama, anyhow.  And that is only of the about 60% of eligible voters who DID vote.  When you add the about 40% who didn't vote to the 48% of those who did vote for a major party candidate who voted against Obama, and people like me who were too pissed at the choices not to vote but wrote in other candidates (Ron Paul, here) it is a distinct minority of eligible voters who voted for Obama.      And since Obama/s supporters kept denying he was for socialism during the campaign, one has to assume they didn't vote for that.|`|AA10382849	Please leave the country now.|`|KOF2lcydaa	I reckon it's because the other 40% are the people who are going to pay for it.

If 60% of the people wast socialism, then 60% of the people are not true Americans.  Real Americans have fought and died to maintain the liberty and freedom we have. We fought and died to keep our Constitution the law of the land.  If 60 % of the people want socialism, then they will have to defend themselves against the 40% of real Americans, for I am one of those 40% and I will not give up my freedom and liberty with out a fight, and may God have mercy on the souls of that 60 % because I will not!|`|92iuiuZKaa	LOL. i think it's the other way around.

But suggest you reduce it or cut in for those on it and they call the AARP and fight tooth and nail.    The same with welfare.   Why work when the government will give you money?   Now they want to give free medical care to anyone who is on un-employment.   The more you reward NOT working the more people you will have who do not want to work.    And it goes on and on.   Socialism rewards failure.  Look at the bail outs as another example.  Why should GM and Chrysler get money for bad management?  There is a process in place called bankruptcy that they can go through to try to get back on their feet.  Giving them a bailout only rewards failure.   Nothing is going to change.    Lastly,  Socialism also includes denying rights to the people.   Look for attacks on the Conservative talk shows,  probably under the disguise of the "fairness doctrine."   Look for attacks an gun rights.  Look for suggestions of an internal passport to fight terrorism.       Once you put something in place it is hard to remove.

They seem to be BELIEVING this watered-down version of what they are being told it is. The end result of Socialism is that EVERYBODY IS POOR. They tax you so badly that no one can afford to live. The taxes go to pay for all of the programs they are now responsible for funding to provide for the people. However, these programs are not expected to turn a profit and therefore are often poor in quality. Socialism doesn't work.       I've seen people call Bush a dictator. BUSH! You idiots don't realize what a real dictatorship is even about! People actually think they are oppressed in this country. That is unbelievable to me.     To directly answer your question, if 40% of people DON'T want to give their money to somebody else and the government says they have to, THAT is Socialism. Do you understand that now? Why ANYBODY would want that is beyond me.|`|sd82DokUaa	i think they are scared that socialism works!!!

Having said that, politicians don't follow the constitution, and America already has a mixed economy, not to mention if every other country is more socialist than the US, there's no other place to go, and in my opinion the other 40% don't have to respect the 60% who foolishly want to throw their liberty away.|`|zB7Hl7x2aa	if the american are for socialism,why didnt the donk's come out and say they are socialist-communist.i will tell you why,they would neever win an election if they told the truth!!|`|baa1b33fddaadc8ca925a52923e3a3ffaa	ok, I can't really explain how hard it is to keep my head from exploding right now, but I'm going to give an honest attempt at calmly and rationally answering you.    first, we aren't a democratic republic. we're a "federal constitutional republic". The fact that a constitution exists that limits the government's power makes the state constitutional. That the head(s) of state and other officials are chosen by election, rather than inheriting their positions, and that their decisions are subject to judicial review makes the state republican.    We are NOT a "democracy."    As such, it is not "majority rule". Our founding fathers did not favor democracy at all, in fact most did not even like the idea of high level government officials being chosen by commoners that they perceived to be uneducated. At first glance, this may sound oppressive, but as Thomas Jefferson once said, A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine.    Constitutional republics are a deliberate attempt to diminish the perceived threat of majoritarianism, thereby protecting dissenting individuals and minority groups from the "tyranny of the majority" by placing checks on the power of the majority of the population.    The object isn't to ignore the will of the majority, its to please the largest number of people on both sides. The notion of the constitutional republic originates with Aristotle's Politics and his notion of a possible fifth type of government called the polity. He contrasts the polity of republican government with democracy and oligarchy in book 3, chapter 6 of Politics. Polity, in the general descriptive sense, can refer to the political organizational system that is being used by a particular group, be it a tribe, a city-state, an empire, a corporation, etc. In Aristotle's second, more specific sense of the word, he envisioned a polity to be a combination of what he thought were the best characteristics of oligarchy (rule by the wealthy) and democracy (rule by the poor). The polity government would be ruled by the many in the best interests of the country.    Oligarchies favored the wealthy members of society and featured elected leadership positions. Democracies favored the poor and middle-class members, of which there are usually greater numbers, and had features such as legislative assemblies open to citizens of voting age. When taken to heart, so to speak, and used correctly, the polity form of government would be the most ideal government possible, thought Aristotle, because it could take input from community members of all levels and rule fairly in the interests of the whole community and not just the majority.    moving on...secondly, I don't think that many Americans actually want socialism, especially if they really knew what it meant. Europe has socialism, and it looks great on paper, but it doesn't actually work the way it's supposed to. Look at the unemployment rate in France, socialism headquarters. Even when times were great, their unemployment was higher than ours is now. Also, Europe and Asia's markets crashed even harder than ours during the GLOBAL economic meltdown.    third....why the constant calls to revolt? As John F. Kennedy once said, "The men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the Nations greatness, but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable, especially when that questioning is disinterested, for they determine whether we use power or power uses us."      How about a compromise? If you want socialism, give half of your income to the federal government. You can literally write a check the the US government. There are no hoops to go through, you don't (and can't) designate a specific purpose for it, you just write them a check. No one is stopping you from giving more than the minimum amount required by the IRS. So how about all the socialists just break out the check book, and no one has to force a new form of government on anyone...|`|CDkUMzzCaa	Take a vacation in a Communist country.

If socialism is so great, why to people risk their life every day to leave a socialist country to come to this great land?|`|4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	Because if we're to accept socialism or communism then you would not have the right to ask the question .  So if that's  what you want   to live without a Constitution and the  Bill of Rights, it would be my suggestion that perhaps moving to a country that supports that would be in order for you.  Try China, Venezuela, Russia or Arabia some of the countries in Africa just any that supports your views.  When you get there email us here at Yahoo! Answers or better yet ask more of these types of question about the country you moved to.    Friend you know absolutely N*O*T*H*I*N*G about the history of   The United States of America and even less about why the Constitution was written.    Open the links below; Read them, study them, learn to appreciate them.  Millions of people would would be happy to have them.  Thousands lost their lives so that we can have them.  *********Most of all********  DON'T FORGET THEM!    The Constitution of the United States of America  http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/...  Bill of Rights   http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/...|`|WKyPDbglaa	Because the USA is not a democracy. The USA= A Constitutional Republic.          Besides major sweeping changes need a 3/4 not a simple majority.           And most Americans do not want socialism, they just hated Bush.              But if socialism was enacted in the USA and an open revolt happened I would be honored to follow in the foot steps of my ancestors who fought valiantly against the british in the revolutionary war.         I strongly urge you to read the declaration of Independence and the US constitution because socialism and communism is not what some of our ancestors(I recognize some americans have no colonial heritage) fought and died for when they established our country.|`|RbPEwvTaaa	Because those of us who have studied our history know that every time socialism and communism have been tried they have FAILED, and miserably.  Besides, I don't think that 60% of Americans want socialism.  I think they have been duped by the media and Obama-maniacs into thinking this will fix our problems when history plainly shows it will NOT.    Canada has socialized medicine.  The average patient waits over 4 months there just to get an MRI.  My former employer....who left Canada to work in the US....told me horror stories about the medical system there.  Her father, who was a nationally renowned physician, was made to wait almost 2 DAYS in a hallway in the ER before he received treatment for a stroke.  Is that what you think the majority of Americans want?    As for the cheaper drugs in Canada, well that may be true, but America is doing all of the research to make new and better drugs, not Canada.  And if you live in Canada and need one of the new and better drugs, well you are just plain out of luck.    Anytime the government takes control of any aspect of our lives it makes a mess out of it.  Until just a few decades ago, we had none of the hundreds of government departments that exist today.  People kept more of their own money, and as a result had more personal freedoms with what they earned.   Socialism and communism were created for the disaffected...those who do not want to create a better life for themselves, but want the government to take care of them.  It is pure nonsense.

I hope he succeeds in all that he does, just as I hope any president will.  My hope for him is rooted in my belief that he is a very clever, intelligent, thoughtful and perceptive person.  He has surrounded himself his whole life with people of all different religions and philosophies, some even highly controversial.  He has great insight from life experiences.  This leads me to believe he will make sound decisions based on information and opinions from all sides, not just those who agree with him.    I could be wrong and he could be an abject failure.

It's up the business leaders, political leaders, community organizers, educators,  US citizens and leaders of the world etc...not Obama.
AA11875616	It's not, at least in my book.  The more complex just getting by and making a living in America becomes, the more simplistic are the solutions they demand.

Here's something I'd like to know. Why is it Republicans are against abortion AND welfare? Let's say we have a young woman who is working a minimum wage job, she has sex with her boyfriend and the condom breaks, and she unintentionally becomes pregnant. Now let's keep in mind that this woman is having a difficult enough time paying for her own bills, much less would she be able to afford a baby. Now Republicans want her to go through with the pregnancy and keep the baby. Well, a minimum wage job is not going to be able to pay for a child. Now if Republicans are against welfare (which in this case, would be needed, especially if the father chose not to be a part of the baby's life or is not financially stable), how the hell is she supposed to raise the child without any help at all? First she would have to take time off work for maternity leave (and not all jobs offer paid maternity leave). She would then have difficulty going back to work because she doesn't have enough money for daycare, and she can't always have her parents watch the baby for free.     So you tell me what she's supposed to do. Find a better job? How? Is she supposed to go to college so she can get a better job? How the hell is she going to do that if she can't afford it and can't afford daycare for her child for when she's in class? Give it up for adoption? You act like that option is just so easy. Biologically, you become attached to the baby throughout your pregnancy, and it becomes very hard to simply give the baby up for adoption. And believe me, I have an enormous amount of respect for women who have the strength to go through nine months of pregnancy and give the baby to a couple who cannot conceive, but remember that forcing a woman to go through an unwanted pregnancy, giving a baby up for adoption, or raising a child when she's not ready to can do SERIOUS mental damage. Choosing "life" is not as easy as you Republicans like to think. We need to worry about the people who are already alive, and not so much about an accidental cluster of cells.|`|RsXOS3aqaa	pro-choice    and really youve noticed everyone that is pro-choice has already been born?  i had no idea   good observation|`|9cpKYneZaa	Well it seems to me, facially, Obama wants your fetuses and guns.

Abortion is killing the fetus.  Abortion = murder.|`|FT7W3f6yaa	you people have nothing better to do or think|`|oW2UQMRCaa	Pushing your beliefs on other people is wrong. People should be able to think for themselves, not have some crazy a** anti-abortionist tell them what to think.     I mean seriously, if abortion is murder, then why do you extreme anti-abortionist bomb the clinics and kill the doctors and people inside? Isn't that murder too. Stop being such damn hypocrites and let people decide for themselves what they want.    Personally, I would not have an abortion but I should have the right to choose. Everyone should have a right to choose, and that shouldn't be taken away from anyone.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	It stops being your body when another human is inside you.

Abiding by that way of thinking is basically just punishing the children for their parents mistake. Someone that doesn't want to have kids should not have kids. By people saying that they shouldn't have sex then is not the answer to the problem because ppl will do as they please, but someone who did not ask to be here shouldn't be responsible for their parents faults.       Now the tax payers money...now as much as I hate to say it, I think allowing people to have abortions with gov asst. is the only way to be fair ...(of course there should be some strings to the deal however)     Because it you take a situation where someone that's poor that wants or needs an abortion, but can't afford one. You are developing a situation where the rich get what they need and want the poor get what they can afford and you have a new baby to basically raise (through gov asst. [If this is the case, not everything is as black and white as I my sound like I am making it out to be]) in a not so good life that can contribute to TONS of unpleaseant things that affect everyone of us.    ...hope this help ;)|`|CZdFWit7aa	I'm for Obama, but against abortions.

Also please come up with better sources than youtube.|`|RbPEwvTaaa	I love how pro-choice people are always accusing us pro-lifers of pushing our agendas down their throats, when Planned Parenthood takes MY tax money to perform abortions WITHOUT my consent !!!     Planned Parenthood is an evil institution and if they ever call my house asking for donations, they will wish they had never called.   They were responsible for a terrible injustice done to me when I was young and pregnant 28 years ago, and I will never forgive or forget.  I am not going into the gory details, but believe me when I say that my well-being and the well-being of my baby was the last of their concerns.    You will find that some of the most outspoken and passionate pro-lifers out there are women who have gone through abortion themselves.  Especially a late-term abortion. There is no one out there that can convince me it is not killing a baby and it is not evil.  Every day of my life I will carry this guilt and pain with me.  There have been times that I wanted to die.  I do not blame the women who have been naively convinced to participate in this horrible "procedure".  I blame the people who promote it, who perform it, and who advocate it.    And to take my hard-earned tax dollars to perform abortions is extortion.  Do not believe anyone who tells you otherwise.  The people of Planned Parenthood will have to answer to God for their atrocities.  And so will the politicians who support them and advocate their evil doings.

I absolutely believe in the death penalty when a child has been the victim of abuse.  People who would hurt a child will never serve any good purpose here on earth.  They should not be allowed their freedom and I certainly don't want to pay for their jail housing.    Caylee Anthony received a penalty of death.

I can't recall any execution carried out in the past several years where the victim was a family member.  The state will be wasting the taxpayer's money if it tries. The prosecutor can get a notch on his pistol but that is about all that would be accomplished.  Regardless of your personal opinion about the death penalty, this one won't make it.|`|pWNPWYSIaa	I honestly believe that they should go for the death penalty because it's sick to take someone's life, especially the life of a child.

Uma elei??o reveladora  Por Flvio Loureiro      As elei??es de 2006 se afiguram um marco na histria poltica brasileira. Se   entre o final do XVIII e incio do sculo passado a aboli??o do voto   censitrio (s podiam votar e serem votados cidad?os que tivessem posses e   uma certa renda), a amplia??o do direito a voto s mulheres (1932) e mais   tarde aos analfabetos, protagonizaram um sensvel avan?o no processo de   radicaliza??o da nossa democracia, o processo eleitoral em curso demonstra   que, embora formalmente tenha sido superada aquela lgica eleitoral   elitista, do ponto de vista ideolgico ela permanece presente.    Bastou a ascens?o poltica de um partido, o PT, e de uma lideran?a poltica,   a do presidente Lula, claramente identificados com aqueles que ao longo de   mais de quatro sculos de histria brasileira tiveram suprimido o seu   direito a voto, e, para esses, governado prioritariamente, que fosse   desvelado o dio de classe, adormecido durante o longo perodo em que o povo   e os trabalhadores brasileiros delegavam a sua representa??o para os   diversos segmentos dos representantes da nossa elite poltica e econ?mica.    Uma elite cujos interesses amide estiveram mais voltados para fora do pas,   primeiro para o continente europeu, depois para o norte-americano, o que   contribuiu peremptoriamente para que o Brasil seja um pas que ostenta uma   das mais densas desigualdades sociais em todo o planeta. Uma elite que   jamais investiu no pas, sem que o Estado brasileiro, a "Viva", lhes   garantisse retorno seguro e sem riscos.    O processo de enfraquecimento do papel do Estado na economia nativa, quando   a nossa elite brasileira diante da perda daquelas garantias optou por se   tornar scia minoritria de grandes empresas transnacionais, e de   privatiza??o, desencadeados pela Era FHC, cuja parcela majoritria de   dinheiro investido teve a sua origem em recursos do BNDES, desviados do FAT-   Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador - e dos Fundos de Pens?o das estatais (t?o   execradas pela modernidade tucano-pefelista) s?o exemplos bastante   cristalinos.    N?o  nada fcil romper com uma lgica (hegemonia) dessas, t?o sedimentada   na histria do pas, t?o cultural e ideologicamente alicer?ada, cujos   valores s?o reproduzidos no cotidiano pela grande mdia impressa e   rdio-televisiva, que termina por auferir um falso estatuto de naturalidade.   N?o  por outra raz?o o nvel de virulncia dos ataques que a campanha Lula   vem sofrendo. N?o  por outra raz?o que se conta nos dedos das m?os os   colunistas e articulistas polticos que manifestam algum grau de simpatia   e/ou ades?o  campanha de um partido popular e de um operrio metalrgico,   que ousaram e lograram disputar o protagonismo na cena poltica brasileira.   Coisa rara!    Tanto n?o  fcil romper com tal lgica que a cada denncia que surge contra   o PT, o governo Lula ou o Congresso Nacional, sustentvel ou n?o, qualquer   investiga??o mais ou menos profunda revela que todos os "esquemas"   descobertos tm seu nascedouro em perodos bem anteriores  ascens?o de Luiz   Incio Lula da Silva  Presidncia da Repblica. Muitos deles com "vida   prpria", j que em alguns casos funcionam  revelia do gestor da ocasi?o,   t?o incrustados que est?o na mquina poltico-administrativa brasileira, que   n?o foi constituda pelo PT ou por seus aliados do campo popular, que est?o   pagando um alto pre?o por n?o dominar a sua liturgia.    Claro que isso explica, mas n?o justifica erros cometidos, que devem ser   apurados e, se comprovadas responsabilidades, exemplarmente punidos, seja no   ambito dos partidos envolvidos, seja na esfera dos poderes legislativo e   judicirio. Quando Lula declarou, logo que assumiu o mandato, que n?o   poderia errar, para justificar algumas decis?es que surpreenderam parcela de   eleitores, militantes e dirigentes petistas, mas que ele avaliava serem   inevitveis para aquela conjuntura, n?o tenho dvida que nem ele tinha a   dolorosa dimens?o proftica daquelas palavras, com se tem hoje, decorridos   trs anos e nove meses de mandato.    Essa elei??o  reveladora porque desvela e n?o deixa dvidas de que a luta   de classes no Brasil, que no debate entre setores da esquerda brasileira   andou enredada em uma mera categoria da formula??o terica marxista,  uma   realidade factual, inexorvel, que move e escreve a nossa histria. Revela   para muitos, inclusive no interior do PT, que a despeito da necessidade   ttica de se compor determinadas alian?as, dada a correla??o de for?as   realmente existente no pas, que a nossa principal alian?a deve ser com os   trabalhadores e o povo brasileiros.    Essa elei??o  reveladora ainda porque desnuda a existncia e a truculncia   de uma direita poltica no pas, que se escondia sob manto ora do   paternalismo oligrquico, ora da promessa de moderniza??o conservadora; e   revela ainda que, por n?o conhecer e/ou desprezar o pas e o seu povo, tanto   as elites polticas brasileiras, atravs das suas mais diversas   representa??es, quanto o esquerdismo doutrinrio, que caminham lado a lado   no plano ttico, nessa reta final de campanha, est?o at?|`|f7a846bad15a01f722d230cf4997d898aa	 n?o fazer uma avalia??o detalhada do poltico antes da elei??o.|`|926eec05a359c67a96f3195be8c70873aa	N?o se informar e acabar cometendo qualquer um dos erros citados acima.|`|a45c252efd693c64b50bc5d58f836f0daa	Como eu tambm li a SuperInteressante deste ms, o eleitor tambm vende o seu voto (um erro gravissimo); no caso dos jovens "n?o querem peder seu primeiro voto" e votam em quem est na frente das pesquisas; e tambm n?o pesquisar a pessoa que est recebendo seu voto (como governos anteriores, vida pblica, escandalos com seu nome, etc), considerando apenas em quem amigos ou parentes votam, esse erro tambem  vital.|`|4f9e6a2e83be83dab674abef0e1e9b0daa	Oh Papori, eu queria inverter a sua perspectiva pra poder responder: Eu  diria "quais s?o os erros comuns do sitema poltico brasileiro"?

Every person is accountable to himself for that, and it is none of mine or anyone else's business how godly he is. I do think that he tries his best, and has done as well as he could in fulfilling his job these past six years.    Also, let's remember that the pain and death would have been happening anyway. There has never been peace in the entire world, and I admire anyone who has the courage to stand up for what's right in the face of so many who lack the strength to do the same. Also, I admire those who protect the weak with their own strength.    The truth is, it doesn't matter how good and godly Bush is.

Beware.    The claim that the 16th amendment was never properly ratified is an old claim, and has been around for decades.  It has never found to have any legitimacy in the courts, and those who refuse to pay their taxes based on it lose. They then face significant fines and penalties, as well as the possibility of prison time.    FURTHERMORE:  Promoting the fact that you can avoid taxes by using this argument is a further violation of the law.  The promotors of such a scheme can be and often are sentenced to huge fines, confiscation of assets, and prison time.

66035e75326c85a7e9c976cb2b39506baa	Bill Clinton, a ssay d'tablir une paix juste et accepte par tous en Palestine. Il a failli russir. Mais un point, un seul et unique petit point, a empch la signature de Arafat :  Les lieux saints de Jruzalem.    Si on reprend la feuille de route, les accords d'Oslo, etc, et qu'on dcide enfin de rflchir srieusement  ce problme des lieux saints, alors on sortira peut-tre de cette guerre ternelle.    Proposition concrte :    1) Retirer  Isra?l la tutelle des lieux saints.   Les sionistes extrmistes refuseront et tueront  nouveau des responsables juifs pour viter cela. Nous le savons. il faudra s'y attendre. Ce terrorisme Juif contre d'autres Juifs sera, pour Isra?l,  le dur prix  payer pour cette paix.    2) Crer avec l'ONU, une sorte de "Vatican Musulman", comprenant l'esplanade et la Mosque. Avec les mmes prrogatives Etatiques et d'indpendance que le Vatican en plein coeur de Rome, demeurant capitale de l'Italie.    3) Ce "vatican Musulman" sera gr par des musulmans, dans le respect de la charte des Nations Unis, notamment au niveau des Droits universels de l'Homme (issus des droits de l'Homme et du citoyens de 1789). Par consquent, le message universel qui en manera concernera un Islam de paix et de tolrance. Donc l'inverse de l'islamisme. Donc un islam moderne et rform (un peu comme l'actuel processus de rforme du Coran et de la charia en France).    Sans ces 3 points fondamentaux, vous aurez la guerre continuelle en Palestine. mais aussi la guerre continuelle sur toute la plante qui hberge actuellement 1 milliards 400 millions de musulmans diviss, dboussels et, pour certains, fanatiss;    Les Chefs d'etats membres du Conseil de scurit et de l'Assemble Gnrale de l'ONU devraient se pencher sur cette option qui demandera beaucoup de travail et de patience, mais qui, au moins, est une source d'espoir pour la paix mondiale future.    Les candidats  la prsidentielle de 2007 devront galement se positionner sur cette proposition de "vatican Musulman" pacifique ou faire une proposition alternative, avant de prtendre gouverner la diplomatie Fran?aise et s'assoir au Conseil de Scurit de l'ONU.

Si les Arabes le quittent, il nous suffira [...] Il n'existe pas d'autre moyen que de les dplacer tous; il ne faut pas laisser un seul village, une seule tribu... Il faut expliquer  Roosevelt, et  tous les chefs d'Etats amis, que la terre d'Isra?l n'est pas trop petite si tous les Arabes s'en vont, et si les frontires sont un peu repousses vers le nord, le long du Litani, et vers l'est, sur les hauteurs du Golan."  Dans le grand journal isralien Yediot Aharonot, du 14 juillet 1972, Yoram Bar Porath, rappelait avec force l'objectif  atteindre:  "C'est le devoir des dirigeants israliens d'expliquer clairement et courageusement  l'opinion un certain nombre de faits, que le temps fait oublier. Le premier de ceux-ci, c'est le fait qu'il n'y a pas de sionisme, de colonisation, d'Etat juif, sans l'viction des Arabes et l'expropriation de leurs terres.""    Comprenez donc l'humiliation subie par les Palestiniens par les militaires qui regulent tout leur deplacement. Aujourd'hui le terres des Palestiniens sont comme une prison, sont deplaces, expulses, voient leur maisons detruites, leur terrain confisques. Ils vivent dans des conditions excecrables, alors que leur voisin Israeliens vivent dans un pays tres occidentalise, avec des beaux quartiers, des routes bien entretenues, des parcs, des grattes-ciel a l'americaine...   Tel est le programme constant du sionisme: l'puration ethnique fonde, une fois de plus, sur une lecture intgriste, littraliste, de la Bible, qui crerait ce dualisme irrmdiable, cette ternelle opposition entre le peuple lu et tous les autres hommes.  De plus, Israel a une armee tres puissante, avec un materiel performant fourni par les Etats-Unis, sans oublier plus de 250 tetes thermonucleaires egalement fourni par ces derniers. Les Palestiniens eux, tout ce qu'ils ont c'est les yeux pour pleurer, d'ou les Kamikazes (imaginez le niveau de desesperance pour en arriver la). De plus, les conditions de misere causee par les politiques d'Israel sont un terreau de choix pour les fanatiques integristes religieux, qui a leur tour portent prejudice a toute une religion dont le nom en arabe signifie "PAIX" (Islam) d'ailleurs assez similaire au terme Hebreux "Shalom".    Malheureusement (ou heureusementt pour les Israeliens), le reste du monde arabe reste impuissant et divise face a cette injustice. Nombreux etats arabes frontaliers (l'Egypte, la Jordanie...) recoivent chaque annees des milliards de dollars (USAID - aide des Etats Unis) - 3 milliards pour l'Egypte, ce qui permet de conserver une stabilite precaire dans la region.    Je n'ai strictement rien contre les Israeliens ou les Juifs, mais contre leur gouvernants politique, militaires et financier, ainsi que leur grand allier l'Amerique, ou l'on peut douter qu'elle soit puissament influencee par certains lobbys. Plus l'Amerique apporte son soutien aveugle, moins il y aura de place pour la diplomacie et une chance de sortir de cette impasse.    Je terminerais toutefois par cette question (je pense que je vais la poser dans le Q/R : considerer une religion comme une nationalite, est-ce un danger?|`|6eb3daf5f0e1e730c4748c86aa23c2b1aa	Toutes les communauts doivent vivre en PAIX.

Alors, aujourd'hui ce n'est qu'un retour chez soi, et non une spoliation des terres, comme en revanche les autres civilisations ont t champion  la colonisation, c'est d'ailleurs pourquoi encore aujourd'hui il y a des ?les fran?aises  l'autre bout du monde.

AA12341057	Get some water tablets. They don't go bad, and they'll let you purify water once you've run through your supply, in case the emergency outlasts your provisions.     A rifle and a shotgun, with ammo for both. Maybe you don't like firearms, and you don't have to tell anyone they're there, but plan for the worst and hope for the best. Situations like that bring out the very worst in people, and you'll need to be able to protect your loved ones. Also, you'll be able to bag a duck, in case the emergency outlasts your provisions.    A compass, in case you need to leave. Look how many people were stuck in New Orleans, with other cities just a few days walk in every direction.    The way I figure, if you have a plan for Armageddon, a simple earthquake or hurricane will be a piece of cake.|`|43473eebab19f84de20de18779f31575aa	water candles port radio, lots of batteries, lots of canned foods.|`|AA11720613	Ammunition    C'mon looters!

This means for each member of the family, there should be 72 hours worth of food, water, hygiene, medications.  Like someone said, think in terms of camping.    Have a plan for evacuation.  You should keep a half tank of gas in the car (or store it in gas containers but it is safer and more convenient in the car.)  You will need this for a quick exit.  A half a tank of gas for most cars will get you a couple of hundred miles away.  Have plan B.  If you can't use a vehicle, then you need a way to bring the survival gear with you.  Those garden wagons witht he big tires are a very good solution.    You need to think of self defense.  There may be human and animal threats.  If you can't or won't use a gun, then look into other options.    You need to bring cash.  Small bills and change.  In an emergency, if you had to purchase more fuel or a motel room, the clerk may not be able to break a "C" note.  If you come accross a vending machine, you can purchase snacks with the change.    Phase 2:  Plan for a month of survival.  Consider doing this at home.  It is too expensive and difficult to move a month of supplies for a family of four or more.  But, towns have lost power for several weeks before it was restored.    Phase 3:  Expand the plan to a year.  Most people think of survival in terms of natural tragadies.  But, what happens if one of the parents have an accident and can't work for a year.  Without their income, the family may lose the house, can't keep the electricity on, and have a hard time putting food on the table.    This plan should include the following.  No debts except for house or car.  A year supply of food/water/medications/hygiene supplies.  A year supply of money to pay the basic bills and the house payment.    I hope this will help get you started.  This is just a brief plan.|`|19f038c651a2b78d2c6a4c16153c1be6aa	Canned Food or other non-perishable foods  Can Opener  Utensils to eat with  Waterproof mathces  Cookware  Warm Clothing  Pet Supplies if you own pets  Copies of important documents  Emergency Cash  Tools, a variety of tools is good  Battery operated radio  Paper products, TP, Paper Towels, etc    Basically a mini house, stock like you were going camping for a week.|`|b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	Nothing really.

The ONLY reason this has become and issue is to divert our attention away from the most serious problems we have in our country - the illegal war that is sucking us and our economy dry, 47 million Americans without health insurance which is breaking our hospitals and entire medical system, our jobs being outsourced to other countries, the disappearing middle class, "war on drugs" costing billions and billions of our tax dollars and is totally ineffectiver, extreme violence in our cities by drug gangs fighting over turf....    The "immigration" problem pales in comparison.  But it gives the dummies among us something to complain about and somebody else to hate.

Quand tu sais que, systmatiquement, le Prsident lu, a obtenu la majorit  l'Assemble aux Lgislatives qui ont suivi, il en ira ncessairement de mme ici.    C'est d'ailleurs logique : pourquoi penser que les lecteurs sont stupides au point de porter Bayrou au pouvoir, pour 3 semaines plus tard, ne pas lui donner les moyens de sa politique ??? C'est bien pour cette raison que le Prsident a tjrs obtenu la majorit.    - Pour anticiper ce que te diront nos chers amis de l'UMPS : d'abord, tu observeras qu'aujourd'hui, personne ne peut revendiquer une majorit certaine  l'Assemble, puisque les trois gros partis sont (sondages prsidentielles) entre 20 et et 30%, ce qui, aux dernires nouvelles, ne fait pas une majorit.    Je te donne ici un raisonnement a contrario, mais qui permet en pratique de constater une chose : c'est que personne, ET PAS PLUS SEGO ET SARKO (c'est l que nos amis de l'UMPS sont d'une hypocrisie sans limites), ne peut te dire "si tu votes pour mon champion, c'est la majorit assure", sans tabler justement sur la rgle (qui s'appliquera  Bayrou comme  quiconque) que j'ai rappele avant et qui veut qu'un Prsident fra?chement lu se voit tjrs donner une majorit  l'Assemble par les lecteurs (ce qui, encore une fois, est parfaitement logique, saus  prendre encore une fois les lecteurs pour des cons).    Dernire chose : sachant pertinemment que cette rgle est intangible, certains vont mme aller jusqu' t'crire que "oui, mais Bayrou il va prsenter des nouveaux candidats dans les circonscriptions, alors que le PS et l'UMP, ils ont dj des dputs sortants".    Argument irrecevable  nouveau : d'abord, parce que justement, des ttes nouvelles, c'est justement ce dont on a besoin et les candidats pro-Bayrou, pour se prsenter au nom de son parti, devront tre justement rallis  son principe majeur d'ouverture politique.    Ensuite et enfin, parce que la seule tronche du dpute, en gnral, on s'en tape, ce n'est pas ?a qui le fait lire .   D'ailleurs, connais-tu le nom de ton dput ?   Et idem pour la plupart des internautes ici ?

Elle propose la dmocratie participative, mais c'est un leurre  l'chelle d'un pays comme la France! A terme c'est dangereux!   Le programme de Royal s'est invent au fur  mesure qu'elle a avanc dans la campagne!   Simplement et non pas grace au peuple, mais surtout par le travail des experts, des politiques qui arrivent parfois  bloquer les drives de Royal! Pas tout le temps!    Elle annonce des choses et le reste de l'quipe doit se dbrouiller pour soit pour annuler les irresponsabilits, soit pour rduire les ides fumeuses de Royal!    Saviez vous que Royal a mit en place la prime  la mauvaise conduite.  Ex : Peillon et Montebourg taient des dissidents professionnels depuis 2002, par rapport au PS, Royal en fait ses 2 porte-parole! -     Puis elle nomme comme porte parole (pendant la campagne interne) Chritophe Careshe, dput et adjoint au maire de Paris parce qu'en tant qu' adjoint  la scurit il avait expliqu que si Lionel Jospin ne retirait pas sa candidature, des militants iraient manifester sous ses fentres!   C'est cela la bravitude! Elle se place en victime, dsigne un bouc missaire et invite au "linchage"! Vous la voyez prsidente?    Quelle est la personnalit politique qui pour rgler ses comptes avec la prsidente d'une grande entreprise fran?aise qui avait  juste titre, refus un transfert de technologie innaceptable, c'est mise  tirer dans le dos des entreprises fran?aises, en expliquant que c'tait parce qu'elles ne faisaient pas leur boulot, qu'elles n'arrivaient pas  s'implanter en Chine" ROYAL!    Les fran?ais peuvent ils faire confiance  quelqu'un qui rgle ses comptes personnels, au dtriment des intrts suprieurs de la France, en dvalorisant nos entreprises?     Qui dcide, sans consultation aucune avec ses conseillers, comme par inspiration divine, des choses incohrente, inapplicables et dangereuses pour la France! ROYAL!  Je cite " un pouvoir ultra personnel, sous des formes videmment charmantes, pleines de bonnes intentions affiches, de discours compatissants et de le?ons de morale.   Une com'sirupeuse, s'il y en eut. Mais cette com' masque un pouvoir personnel sans contr?le aucun, qui annonce le pire si jamais elle l'emporte.

xgqFmVBDaa	On a su recemment, que Nicolas Sarkozy a menac certains journaliste qu'il jugeait trop virulants dans leurs propos, c'est  dire tous les journalistes de gauche pratiquement ... ^^ bref. Il aurait dit "faites attention  ce que vous d?tes, je ne vous oublierais pas aprs les lctions ..." Il aurait ainsi menac plusieurs redactions, et tout le monde sait que ces menaces sont dangereuses pour ces journaux (marianne, charlie hebdo) tant donn les moyens de pression dont il dispose. Vive la libert de presse !    En ce qui concerne le Parlement, il est contre les proportionelles ( vrifier tout de mme, car je tiens cela d'une personne et non d'un mdia), ce qui signifie donc que la droite sera largement majoritaire, voire omniprsente...    En ce qui concerne la justice, les mesures qu'il entend prendre sur les mineurs, et les multi recidivistes, sont longues a rsumer, mais trs faciles  trouver sur le net. Pour ma part, elles sont trop abusives. Je ne pense pas qu'elles sont  mme de rsoudre les problmes d'insecurit.    Mais toi qui n'a pas l'air encore vraiment decid, je te conseille juste de prendre du recul par rapport aux discours de sarkozy, qui est formidablement enjoliveur, et convaincant presque, malgr ses ides plus que dangereuses... c'est un sophiste parfait !|`|8RpclKtdaa	Comment convaincre un centriste (je suis centriste) de voter pour Mr Sarkosy, c'est trs simple :   1) Le PS a toujours rejet le Centre depuis 30 ans, refusant historiquement toute alliance avec l'UDF... et encore pas plus tard que Dimanche 22/04 jusqu' 19H59.  2) Mme Royal n'a pas d'autre choix que de faire des courbettes aux centristes pour tre lu Dimanche 06/05. C'est sa seule motivation pour rencontrer Mr Bayrou. Ceci ne veux pas dire qu'elle adhre en quoique soit  la politique de F. Bayrou. Et le PS encore moin.  3) Les Elus UDF donneront leurs voix  Mr Sarkosy sachant que l'UMP  trs souvent sign des accords ave l'UDF (centre droite) pour ne pas mettre un candidat en concurrence dans la mme circonscription et pour viter les triangulaires aux lgislatives. La Gauche ne le fera JAMAIS !  4) 2/3 des lecteurs UDF sont de centre droite et la politique de l'UDF est bcp plus proche de l'UMP  5) Mr Sarkosy n'est pas seul  l'UMP. C'est un parti composer de dputs, snateurs, ministres... On ne peut pas tout ramenner  Mr Sarkosy, il ne dirigera pas seul.  6) Mme Royal est une danseuse. Elle retourne sa veste toutes les 5 minutes au point de crer une confusion sans prcdent. C'est trs dangereux et incontrolable si cela se passe au niveau de la prsidence.  7) Elle veut instaurer un chevalier blanc (elle) et un chevalier noir (Mr Sarkosy) en diabolisant ce dernier  outrance.  8) Si l'UDF veut des lus aux prochaines lgislatives, il ne faut pas que la gauche passe. Car si elle passe la gauche ne fera aucune concession  l'UDF contrairement  l'UMP par fidlit aux nombreux lus centristes qui ont maintenu leurs soutiens  Mr. Sarkosy    Je pense que ce sont de bonnes raisons de voter pour l'UMP. La diabolisation de leur candidat devient ridicule et absurde. C'est mme triste d'en tre arriv l !|`|u6dTVrRAaa	Moi je vote Nico !|`|618c109bc5b3a210e304ffcfdcf37e33aa	les engagements de Sarkozy n'engagent que ceux qui les coutent ou les entendent.    la dmocratie est plus importante que l'conomie|`|32fd15a5cd80add0963c077042c4410caa	Je suis dans le meme cas que toi.

D'autres sont des socialistes d?us, ils reviendront vers le PS.     Pour cette nouvelle "catgorie" d'electeurs qui n'ont pas de sympathie  gauche, ni  droite,  il faut attendre que m.bayrou mette en ordre de marche son nouveau mouvement...  (et avoir confiance)|`|a63885f3e8164c6ea1b625880ab6245baa	ds que Sarkozy promet de faire lire le parlement  la proportionnelle intgrale je vote pour lui, donc jamais..    Sarkozy a peur du peuple et de la dmocratie c'est pour ca qu'il garde en l'tat des institutions primes et dvoyes par l'UMP et le PS  leur seul avantage..    quant aux pseudo-centristes de l'UMP, chaque jour qui passe ils se dcrdibilisent un peu plus par leurs attaques hystriques contre Bayrou (Veil, Robien, Douste-Blabla, Santini etc), tu parles d'une ouverture au centre..    je vote blanc ce coup ci et Bayrou en 2012, aux 2 tours !|`|7000e90be637c63a888f425d462d0d1faa	le pb, c'est que la majorit des mdias sont... de gauche, et donc diabolisent totalement sarko pour faire ressortir royal comme une sainte.    Sarkozy peut parra?tre assez raide dans ses mthodes.. mais un chef qui se plie  toutes les exigences ne peut pas tre prsident selon moi.   Et puis sarozy prvoie tout de mme des mesures pas si bte que ?a, pour relancer le travail et lutter contre le ch?mage, ce qui permettra aussi de relancer la consommation et amliorer le pouvoir d'achat. Par exemple, les formations pour les jeunes de banlieues.. ben c'est vrai que c'est mieux qu'on les aide  bosser plut?t que de les laisser ne rien faire ! il va les former  des mtiers et hop, ils pourront travailler sans pb.  donc il ne faut pas croire que c'est un tirant, ils prevoient quand pas mal de petites choses pour lutter contre le chomage et amliorer notre conomie (qui est en sacr dficit)    Ars royal, commence  copier ses ides pour s'attirer les voies; mais ce qui ne me plait pas du tout en elle, c'est que j'ai beaucoup plus l'impression qu'elle esssaye de s'attirer des voies et que son prgramme sera diffrent que celui propos ( savoir plus "rouge").  Selon mon avis, augmentez les aides sociales sans aucun plan de financement efficace derrire est une catastrophe.. ou le meilleure moyen pour que l'on ne puisse plus avoir de retraites (qui ne pourront plus tre finances) et plus d'aides... On ne peut pas se permettre de faire que du social... on n'en a pas l'argent ncessaire.    Aussi, Sarko se montre totalement contre les golden parachute, il l'a encore dit hier, pour lui, le patron d'EADS n'aurait jms du toucher cette somme. Il n'est donc pas compltement pour les dirigeants.. au contraire, il veut que le travail soit justement rcompens, et non rcompens comme l'a t le mec d'eads pour foutre une boite dans la pannade et sortir ave des millions dans les poches.    Contrairement  Royal, Srko vient d'une famille immigre o le prea boss dur pour y arriver,... et c'est honnorable.. Contrairement  Sgo qui prtend venir d'une famille trs modeste, alors qu'elle a quand mme eu une enfance assez gate pour ne pas dire qu'elle a toujours plut?t pter dans la soie !    Et puis il ne faut pas oublier l'affait battisti qui a disparu de la circulation bizarrement alors que l'on reproche encore  Sarko d'avoir dit le mot "racaille" (mais je crois que quand on est les parents de la femme handicape qui s'est faite br?ler vive dans un bus, "racaille, c'est encore modr non ? Surotut que les jeunes de moins de  18 ans ne risque presque rien au niveau pnal, sauf un sjour en maison de redressement,e t c'est pas si mchant que ?a en a l'air) .  Battisti qui a tu trois personnes il me semble en italie, il fait partie de l'extrme gauche Italienne.. et c'est marrant, mais il a t largement protg par la gauche durant toutes ses annes alors qu'il y avait un mandat d'arrt intrernational. Sarko l'a fait arrt et il me semble que c'est normal. C'est s?r que la gauche s'est insurge, puisque ?a faisait des annes qu'elle le protgeait ( surtout la mairie de paris....).    Donc.. n'coute pas que les mdias pour rflchir  ton vote. Pense aussi  notre conomie qui est assez fragile et qui demande de rel plans de financements... pour sauvergarder notre Etat providence.  Pense  la vision de la france que tu voudrais voir se dvelopper.  tu restes libre de ton choix|`|J9C7gPfkaa	Si tu crois  toute la diabolisation, la calomnie et les mensonges (comme celui d'aujourd'hui) du PS, ce n'est pas la peine de t'expliquer...Je perdrais mon temps.

Les UMPistes y sont beaucoup trop radicalement rigides comme le dis Fran?ois Darras en page 4 :  "Il y a donc les accros. Ceux qui le sont  Sarkozy ne changeront pas de cheval, mme s'ils apprenaient que leur hro avait assassin et dcoup en tranches sa grand-mre. Entre eux et lui, il y a fusion.

"    Et bien les autres sont dans la vraie vie, pas dans l'anonymat de Q/R qui permet d'exprimer les ides les plus inacceptables. Et dans la vrai vie, le message de Marianne passe trs bien, il est un appui inespr  tout ce qu'on dit depuis des mois.     Et surtout, c'est un appel fort aux journalistes dans grands mdias fran?ais (alors que la presse trangre est trs claire vis--vis du danger Sarkozy), pour qu'ils cessent cette connivence indigne de leur devoir d'informer.    L'info, nous l'avons, depuis longtemps.

Il y a l une indcence flagrante (que mme les soutiens UDF de NS ont fait remarquer)!  En outre, que l'argent roi soit rig en idole est tout simplement trs inquitant pour la France et ses valeurs (si souvent mises en avant par le mme NS).  Rhabiliter la valeur travail, pourquoi pas?

Personnellement, j'ai mon avis ("panach") sur la question, mais je me garderai bien de vous en faire part...     Je note cependant qu' chaque fois que l'on met en avant ce dbat sur les vacances de notre nouveau Prsident, les seuls arguments auxquels on a droit sont :     1/ "Il a bien le droit de prendre des vacances" ! Mais naturellement, personne n'a dit le contraire, mme Hollande (que je n'aime pas) le dit... Le pb, c'est la fa?on dont il les passe, aprs avoir fait campagne sur des valeurs de vertu, de repsonsabilisation, d'humilit et de respect des lecteurs...     2/ "Et Hollande et Royal, ils ont pas d'argent peut-tre ?". Ben si, ils en ont, tant mieux pour eux d'ailleurs... Mais le truc, c'est que c'est Sarko le Prsident et que les UMP-istes n'ont eu de cesse de nous dire qu'il tait justement mieux que Royal, plus intelligent, plus cohrent... Donc arrtons de renvoyer la balle aux socialistes et expliquons franchement les choses sur sarko, non ?     3/ "Et toi, si un ami te prtait un bateau, tu refuserais peut-tre ?". Probablement pas, mais tout d'abord, je ne suis pas Prsident de la Rpublique, qui, me semble-t-il, doit avoir un comportement irrprochable et ensuite, si  j'tais Prsident, je ne suis pas s?r que sit?t lu,  j'irai m'enfermer au Fouquet's pendant 2 heures avec une star du show bizz qui a quitt la France our ne pas payer d'imp?ts, avant de passer le nuit dans un palace, puis de partir en jet priv passer des vacances ultra-luxueusues dans un yacht (le tout devant les camras de tlvision naturellement)...     ...yacht prt par Vincent Bollor, multi-milliardaire, dont Sarkozy est trs proche, qui est galement le beau-frre de Grard Longuet, ancien Ministre et Conseiller politique de Sarkozy, Vincent Bollor qui a nomm  la tte du dpartement "Afrique" du Groupe Bollor, Michel Roussin, galement ancien minsitre, muiltiple mis en examen dans les affaires de financement occulte du RPR...     Je trouve cela juste parfaitement indcent et rvlateur, quand je pense que ce mme Sarko est all faire le tapin dans les usines auprs d'ouvriers qui se lvent  5 heures du mat' pour gagner le SMIC et  qui il a dclar dans les yeux "je suis comme vous, je suis avec vous, je sais ce que vous vivez"...     Que pensent-ils aujourd'hui, ces gens ?     Sachant tout cela et y rajoutant notamment que l'un des frres de Sarkozy est l'un des anciens dirigeants du MEDEF, je ne vois pas en quoi cela est scandaleux et/ou illgitime de s'interroger et de s'offusquer de cette "Rpublique des copains" qui est manifestement en train de se renforcer, l o Sarko le premier est venu nous parler d'un Etat impartial !?     4/ "Les gauchistes sont de mauvais perdants". Peut-tre effectivement que certains ont la dfaite amer... Mais tout d'abord, il faut arrter avec ce termes "gauchistes", d'abord parce que tout ceux qui ne sont pas d'accord avec Sarko et ses sbires ne sont pas forcment de gauche et ensuite, parce que si vous mettez le nez dans des manuels d'histoire, vous verrez que ce terme rappelle des heures sombres de notre pays... Ensuite, "gauchiste" ou pas "gauchiste", admettez a minima que l'on conserve une seule libert fondamentale, celle de l'expression et de la critique... Je note que, depuis dimanche soir, on ne peut plus rien dire sur Sarko, sans tre des ennemis de la Patrie, amis de la racaille..., c'est ahurissant !     Je parle avec d'autant plus de libert que j'tais pour Bayrou et ne me sens pas donc un dangereux "gauchiste" !        Je sais que les assidus de ce forum s'agacent de revoir passer cette rponse... Naturellement, elle ne leur est pas destine, mais d'autres gens ne l'ont pas forcment lue et leur avis m'intresse...

EJ4sB2JBaa	?Estamos de acuerdo en que el tabaco es un tipo de droga?  Yo soy fumador, si ma?ana me levanto y despus de tomar mi tazn de caf no me hecho un cigarro, me entrarn sudores fros por todo el cuerpo..... Para mi el tabaco es una droga, blanda, pero una droga.  Tengo fotos de mis abuelos fumando, y a mi padre le dieron su primer cigarro a los 8 a?os para que demostrase su virilidad..... El arraigo que tiene el tabaco en Espa?a, est justificado por motivos "casi culturales".  Un da me levant de la cama, y el tabaco era malo: haba pasado de moda, era ilegal fumar en sitios en los que el da anterior poda pulirme una cajetilla sin ningn miramiento...  En EE.UU, por ejemplo, pasaron del Cowboy de Marlboro, a casi ser un excluido por ser fumador.  Y la medida en s, yo s que es buena: en principio, parece que se ha tomado por vigilar nuestra salud...........  ?A dnde quiero ir a parar? Al punto en que se toman las decisiones. ?Fueron motivos sanitarios los que empujaron a restringir mi consumo de tabaco? Pues en parte s, pero sa medida se empez a tomar justo en el momento en que la factura sanitaria derivada de los gastos por enfermedades del consumo de tabaco, super al ingreso de los impuestos en concepto de ventas de cajetillas.  Nadie pens en mi libertad para tomar una medida que me afectaba directamente, y he tenido que soportar cmo en los eventos deportivos (no te lo pierdas, "deportivos"), se ha concedido una prrroga de dos a?os para permitir la publicidad del tabaco..... Es decir, que yo, que soy el afectado directo, que dependo para mi desgracia del tabaco, no tengo una miserable prrroga para adaptarme, y los anunciantes del tabaco ?s?.    Con las drogas, sucede algo muy parecido.  No interesar remover el asunto mientras que genere beneficios econmicos. Entindase por beneficio el dinero ***** que derrochan los narcos en actividades legales, de cuyos impuestos nos beneficiamos todos.   Cuando te pasan 20 euros de porros o medio gramo de perico, el camello en cuestin va a tener que gastar se dinero en el comercio legal de debajo de su casa: har que mejore su calidad de vida, y se beneficiar el que tiene un restaurante legal, un concesionario legal, y otras actividades legales.... As sucede a todas las escalas de narcotrfico, desde financiar guerras en pases remotos, hasta el que taleguea en el parque, y con sus beneficios se compra una bolsa de gominolas, en una tienda legal, por supuesto.    Por so no interesa, de momento, acabar con el narcotrfico. Y tampoco interesa que sea legal, porque mucha gente ve en la droga un tab, algo impopular que hara tambalearse a cualquier gobierno.  Nadie, nadie actuar de forma eficiente mientras que el negocio genere beneficios.   Y slo cuando deje de ser rentable, slo entonces (como ha sucedido con el tabaco), se perseguir el narcotrfico de forma eficiente, no cogiendo un barco y dejando que pasen cuatro.  Dinero, estimado Anthony, slo es cuestin de dinero....|`|CaDwYGIBaa	Muchas preguntas, muy interesantes y dificiles. La respuesta global es No.  No existe interes genuino por acabar con el narcotrafico y aunque tu lo expones como un tema meramente economico el transfondo es mucho mas profundo, es un tema cultural, social pero sobretodo humano. Desde hace muchos siglos los humanos han requerido estimulos para buscar una paz interior, y en las drogas encontro una via practica de subir o alterar su conciencia. Estar dopado es una condicion intrincica del caracter humano, chamanes con peyote, magos orientales con opio, revolucionarios con cucaracha (la que no puede caminar), deportistas con esteroides, estrellas de la farandula adictas a tremendas rayas blancas, ni?os de la calle cuya primera necesidad es el thiner o resistol... en fin, la droga no desaparecera por la obra y gracia de ningun gobierno, y no es por el beneficio economico eso es pecata minuta, es por que el hombre necesita, necesito y sobre todo necesitara de sustancias externas que cambie de algun modo su entorno y de esta manera hacer mas facil y llevadera su ya de por si complicada vida|`|be38beb26cb469198167d3c7ef20b04caa	La respuesta es no y existen varias razones    indudablemente el beneficio economico.Siendo esta una d las actividades mas lucrativas en la relacion costo-precio de venta, la droga se convierte en el producto so?ado del capitalismo, algo que me cuesta poco hacerlo lo vendo a 10, 20, 30 y hasta mas veces su valor original. Y como todos sabemos que el capitalismo es la dictadura del mundo, por consiguiente su maxima creacin (la comercializacion de ellas fue el invento) no podr ser eliminada mientras este sistema exista.    dinamiza la industria de las armas. alli no hay mucho que explicar.    se dice que la religion es el opio de los pueblos, pero el opio de los pueblos es el opio, o sea las drogas como tal. es la forma de dominar a los pueblos, de idiotizarlos, de hundirlos en la miseria, de destruir los cerebros de personas de todas las edades, de que se maten entre ellos, para que asi la clase poderosa siga dominando ya que ellos son los que si se interesan en la politica y son los que no estan perdiendo el tiempo en alguna esquina, sino que estan metidos en las universidades estudiando las ciencias que les permitiran seguir manejando al mundo. asi que mientras mas personas se alejen de los estudios por las drogas, o si en tal caso acuden, son los idio.tas de la clases que razonan menos que una ardilla, esto sera menos competencia para ellos.    todos sabemos que pablo escobar gaviria fue el capo de la droga de todos los tiempos, y si bien el hecho de que fuese asi hace que lo consideremos una mala persona, el pensaba lo contrario. toda su red de produccion y trafico, aparte de ser por enriquecimiento, fue ademas una venganza en contra de los estados unidos por sus infulas de amo del universo, y los inundo de droga a mas no poder, les llevo hasta sus manos lo que querian.. todo esto con el objetivo de destruir a la sociedad norteamericana.    en fin.. son muchos los factores que influyen en esta actividad y que hacen que ese fin se vea muy lejano|`|YzWHGNeuaa	Creo que deberas saber que el C?amo, una planta que se conoce desde hace siglos, se usa para ropa, goma, neumticos, entre otros usos. La droga que tiene, el THC, se puede variar, llegando a ser casi nulo cuando se usa el c?amo para produccin de estos materiales.   En Europa era un cultivo tradicional antes de la 2a Guerra Mundial, luego lleg la crisis despus de la guerra y EEUU trajo el algodn, lo que hizo desaparecer este tipo de cultivo.  EEUU prohibi el cultivo del c?amo, no por la droga, sino porque no le beneficiaba economicamente.  Aun y todo estoy deacuerdo con la legalizacin de la Marihuana para el uso teraputico..

Also, Europe would have simply colonized the U.S. and it would have made for a violent land grab when Britain lost control of its territories.|`|abaf923a34ee9c58296df504faad9d74aa	NO NO NO. Maybe it would be better off if you weren't around on here asking such daft questions. America helped us the Brits in WW2, and helps all over the world even now. They would be  richer and far better off if they didn't. Their country can sustain itself as it has everything it needs as it is a self producing country.|`|KTM5JEkLaa	Tell you what, think about all the opportunities you have had living in this free country, think about all of the liberated people in Europe that benefited from America's efforts in two world wars, think about all of the technological & medical advances our system of economy has allowed to take place, and consider all of the millions of people who have been imprisoned and killed for speaking out against their governments in other countries, and then answer your own question.|`|8VeiQNRBaa	Probally not|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	I don't really care to be honest, although it would mean there'd be a lot more stupid people in England.<br>  <br>  Quite a few of you Americans answering this question are labouring under the illusion that the rest of the world would be still living in the dark ages if it wasn't for all your marvellous inventions. Hahaha, what inventions would these be then? Please could someone enlighten me?|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	No, because Europe would have been ruled by dictators so the Western world would be a mess. The 2 World Wars could've been won by Germany...can you imagine that? I guess the rest of the world would be much poorer too in the lack of the huge contributions Americans make. The world would be a lot different, that's for sure.|`|bgP32Aiuaa	Why Do You Hate America So Much...its the greatest country on EARTH|`|fynzkVK4aa	I'm not American and I love Unseen47s idea too...if you stopped dragging us into pointless wars we could tell you to stuff your so called aid (and your air force bases, without which you have cat in hells of hitting Russia should you need to in future).<br>  <br>  The US joined WW2 because Japan attacked pearl harbor.  Before that they didn't care at all about Europe or the war, so lets not pretend it was an altruistic gesture.<br>  <br>  The USA has now what Britain had in the 1800s...look where it got us (not to mention previous superpowers such as the Spanish, Romans, Egyptians etc, etc..) Every dog has its day so enjoy it while it lasts..my money is on China for the next stint as "big man"...|`|9b8d95d8f696f93ee3cf175a015f246eaa	In short - Yes|`|tzIoe6CAaa	Well i dont really think so. Think about all the technology, medical, government, ect. advances that have been made here. We've been first to do a lot of things.  The world would definatly be different. Better or worse? Who knows, so why even worry about it?|`|3249da600ad1d0abc22a5fdfd634fb67aa	i'm an american and i love your idea maybe america should keep to itself let all other countrys deal with their own problems close the borders don't let anyone in,buy only american goods.stop sending billions of dollars to other countries for aid|`|nDAnSuVBaa	It'd be a quieter place, not sure about better.<br>  I'm not from there though.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Unlikely. Europe would have lost World War 2.  The Soviet Union would still be threatening nuclear holocaust.|`|967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	Then where would all of the "sick, the tired the hungry" have gone.|`|F2jOzkmTaa	no the world would be better without mexico|`|q7MQhS6baa	No, because as a superpower there are insurmountable benefits to America being, well, America. Just the same as Great Britain, China and Russia are beneficial (if not tense).<br>  Would the world be better off without arrogant Americans who seem to think they won the two world wars single-handedly? Of course.|`|G0MVoleoaa	urm, im afraid to answer....<br>  actually i can't even imagine that.<br>  thing is it could have been 'worse'.|`|7CeXTRA8aa	In short, No.|`|TLiYEkOJaa	No because we would never have Barack Obama as President|`|j30FIDGjaa	no, not really.|`|NUJWnszcaa	yeah|`|2cfbc3429eac9ab963770c91b91642d5aa	Yes it would have been better if you wanted the world to be run by dictators, drug cartels and communists then fershizzle. Its better not to have a united states of america.|`|yarGNc61aa	No I totally think that would not be a good idea. But as for Nathan's comment? About Yanks???? I think your really low. I don't even consider you human! joke or not boo
sA7DuUUBaa	no they wont call the system don't do anything but take take money there 100% takers and if there not a profit to be made that's why they don't call. as far as it being a year ago if it was a misdo miner then it would have been droped if it was a felony then it only last a year depending on the degree of the felony will depend on its time expiration. and if its a real serous felony like murder or attempt then that never expires. But it probally was dismissed or went he next police run in would have brought it up.  minor misdemeanors are usually droped in 6 to 8 month. felony's are 12 to ongoing

Ceux-l n'ont mme pas eu droit  une stle, ni  une commmoration. Il n'y en a eu que pour les 2 abrutis qui ne savaient mme pas lire une tte de mort sur un transfo.  - L'attaque d'un bus  Marseille dont une passagre a t br?le vive.  - L'attaque du train Paris-Nice en janvier 2006 o des bandes afro-maghrbines ont dvalis les voyageurs comme au Far West. De tels vnements se sont renouvels depuis.  - Les ratonnades anti-blancs lors des manifs anti-CPE de 2006  - Le problme des SDF  qui on ne donne que des tentes pendant qu'on s'vertue  donner des 6 pices  des familles polygames de clandestins, aprs les avoir logs  l'h?tel  nos frais (un exemple entre mille: les squatteurs de Cachan).   Il y a 7 minutes  -La multiplication des saccages d'glises et de cimetires catholiques ou juifs dans la plus totale indiffrence, pendant que le ministre va se dplacer en personne pour un gribouillis sur une mosque.  -La progression de lislamisme : on ne peut plus rien faire qui puisse choquer lislamiquement correct (violences aprs le discours du Pape, affaire des caricatures de mahomet, agressions des mdecins dans les h?pitaux)  -Progression de la dlinquance violente  -Fraudes massives (plusieurs millions deuros) aux Assedics, aux allocs, etc.  -Dette abyssale non ma?trise (2000 milliards deuros !)  cause des gaspillages en tout genre.

Cette dernire n'est pas prte de reprendre l'initiative car elle n'est pas soutenu par son parti dont les 2/3 des tnors n'attend que de la voir chuter. Elle a ancr son programme trs  droite ce qui la met en opposition non seulement avec la gauche de sonparti mais avec toutes les factions d'extrme-gauche dont il n'est mme pas s?r qu'elles lui apporteraient leur soutien lors d'un hypothtique deuxime tour...

Plus que jamais Fran?ois Bayrou est en position de passer au 1er tour et de fdrer sur le second l'ensemble d'une classe politique qui refusera de suivre le populiste UMP.

Le cirque mdiatique fait que les faits d'actualit influent beaucoup sur le vote, compte tenu de l'indcision.   Malheureusement, comme les actualits aiment montrer des vnements problmatiques franco-fran?ais (fermeture d'usine, mort violente, meutes), les faits d'actualit risquent de renforcer tel ou tel extrme plut?t que les candidats modrs.  Hier, le fait d'actualit qui a influ sur la campagne, c'est l'indemnit norme de dpart de No?l Forgeard...    On verra ensuite.    C'est vraiment chaud.    Il faut s'accrocher.

Who said that SC/STs have not attained a status? They are there in very many govt. departments,organisations, universities etc etc atleast after 60 long years.    Mother Truth knows that her favourite children would not have had a chance otherwise.     So they definitely have attained a certain status.    Their more unfortunate bretheren do look up to them for elementary guidance atleast.     The percolation theory is working in the reservation system atleast.     What is still unfortunate is that the so called "talented guys" do everything possible to keep them in the dark as regards everything pertaining to the particular organisation in which they happen to be employed,  - and this is common knowledge.    Thus they ( the "talented guys ") ensure that  the system of Segregation is perpetuated without respite. The "talented guys" would leave no stone unturned to use all their "talent" towards this end.And they would not lift their little finger to embrace them into the realm of progress and development.     My God, why the talent brigade would not use their forte to spend a thought for these unfortunate bretheren, heaven only knows.     Cruelty ,is thine name Talent?    Point to their dirt, filth,poverty,habits and all and preen yourself and kith on your divine talent.And there ends your "Talent".    Pause to think O'  "talent" whence and how would a newly "Uplifted" be able to give a helping hand to his bretheren when "talented" hawks,and vultures are ready to swoop and throw the newly "Uplifted" into infamy at the slightest pretext ?   Here too Survival becomes paramount my friend.     And how heartless of you to accuse that they are "ASHAMED" to mingle my dear friend "talent"!! They are "hesitant and even afraid" to mingle my dear,for fear of accusations by the "talent" brigade of Favouritism,  Neo-casteism and what not?     They certainly do not have the "talent" for this my dear.  They certainly do not and would not.    Therefore the solution that you seek for their betterment is to give them more reservation in education, jobs and promotions without any reservation in your "TALENTED MINDS" ,and for heavens sake, do not be bent on pulling them down or maligning them even as some of them are becoming collectors or police officials or other govt. officials,after considerable struggle.|`|3b5f0ab8c2e3b68a1bac04317d287d97aa	all i know is that if im starving in calcutta im gonna find the nearest cow and have the biggest cheesburger u ever seen.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

By Paul Harvey    Conveniently Forgotten Facts. -- Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers  decided that a fellow black panther named Alex Rackley needed to die.    Rackley was suspected of disloyalty. Rackley was first tied to a chair.  Once safely immobilized, his friends tortured him for hours by, among  other things, pouring boiling water on him. When they got tired of torturing  Rackley, Black Panther member, Warren Kimbo took Rackley outside and put  a bullet in his head. Rackley's body was later found floating in a river  about 25 miles north of New Haven Connecticut.     Perhaps at this point you're curious as to what happened to these Black  Panthers? In 1977, that's only eight years later, only one of the  Killers was still in jail. The shooter,Warren Kimbro, managed to get a  scholarship to Harvard and became good friends with none other than Al Gore. He  later became an assistant dean at an eastern Connecticut State College. Isn't  that something? As a '60s radical you can pump a bullet into someone's   head and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an assistant  College dean! Only in America !    Erica Huggins was the woman who served the Panthers by boiling the water  for Mr. Rackley's torture. Some years later Ms. Huggins was elected to a   California School Board.    How in the world do you think these killers got off so easy? Maybe it  was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of  the Panthers. These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale  University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers  during their trial. One of these people was none other than Bill Lan  Lee.    Mr. Lee, or Mr. Lan Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean. He is  not a member of a California School Board. He is now head of the United  States Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, appointed by none  other than Bill Clinton.    O.K., so who was the other Panther defender? Is this other notable  Panther defender now a school board member? Is this other Panther apologist now  an assistant college dean? No, neither!    The other Panther defender was, like Lee, a radical law student at Yale  University at the time. She is now known as the "smartest woman in the  world." She is none other than the Democratic Senator from the state of  New York ----our former First Lady, the incredible Hillary Rodham   Clinton .    And now, as Paul Harvey said; "You know the rest of the story".      This is proven right by both SNOPES.COM, and TruthorFiction.com|`|AA11824468	She's a disgrace.      I hope that someone is copying all of these comments and letting her know what the majority of us truly think of 'her'.|`|Wfz67PHEaa	Simple, she is a Socialist. Plain and clear. Just look at her policies.

She does not possess the qualities of a person who would be President of the United States. She displays an heir of entitlement (meaning she believes she simply DESERVES to be president), she clearly does not have the interests of the country in mind, nor are these interests where they belong, in the forefront of her character. She despises the military, the very organization she would be leader of, which in and of itself makes no sense.    Ultimately, she lacks the character to be a good President. Anyone can get elected to the Presidency (at least according to the Constitution) but it takes a special person to really lead this country in the manner as was intended. She cannot do this and has proven her lack of creditability and credentials in the past.    Does that answer your question?

UaAy01yjaa	Maoists are, by nature, violent.  It comes from Mao's philosophy.  Nepali Maoists were anything but peaceful in their efforts to gain recognition.    Actually, all types of state-based communism must, at some point, also support violence - against those who do not accept state control over their lives.  Communism in general, an Maoism in particular, always descends to authoritarianism.    I'm very supportive of the idea of communal living, as long as it is voluntary.  Once it becomes state policy, and requires conformity of all citizens, it requires enforcement by violence.  At that point, it is a horrific and dangerous phenomenon.|`|0WLSvVY5aa	In future

It is there everywhere. Are people not noticing double talk of leftists these days? They do something in West Bengal and Kerala while advocating for  just the apposite in Centre. So no polititicians including leftists can set example of clean public life these days.

POFXeLrGaa	im not sure if she will do it or not, it tripped me out when i heard that story, but I DONT think she should do it because, i think they are just trying to test her self respect, she is already looked bad upon many people, so if she does it, she will have to live with that kind of reputation forever...and be mocked and teased her whole life, the only thing that she can do is to do something really good in her life to pick herself back up therefore she can recieve the proper respect that she and her children deserves.

6OLiuM9Gaa	It's difficult getting inside the head of a fanatic. <br>  <br>  He's said that the only reason he's fighting is to kill infidels. If we leave, he'll have to follow.<br>  <br>  I believe that, if the Iraqi military and police aren't prepared, all the work, all the sweat, all the blood, all the lives will be wasted because I think he'll declare a victory, announce he's in charge (kind of like Hamas) and Iraq will have another Hussein wannabe in power... or maybe several.. like we're fighting in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, I see the peope blaming the military rather than President Obama. To punish the military, the government will furher cut the military budget. In six years, if Obama's still in office, he'll have to face the badgering from the people and from Congress for pulling the troops out too soon.  He'll, of course, point the finger at the military. "I said 16 months. they wanted 19 months... so i gave it to them. I did what they asked... and they still couldn't get the job done." <br>  <br>  Now, having sat in on these kinds of "negotiations.here's what I"ll bet transpired:<br>  <br>  President Obama: Ok, you guys, you have 16 months to get th troops out.<br>  <br>  JCS: Mr. President, the Iraqi military will take another three years, maybe four to be fully functional. If we leave before that, the insurgents will take over almost unopposed. And they'll wipe out the elected Iraqi government and any army and police personnel who won't roll over <br>  <br>  President Obama: I promised the people 15 months. Tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 18 months... take it or leave it.<br>  <br>  JCS: : We need more time. If we pull out that soon, all that we've done will be gone...<br>  <br>  President Obama: Take it or leave it.<br>  <br>  JCS: Yes SIR,, Mr. President! We'll take it. (I won't tell you what they'd be thinking.)<br>  <br>  I'll bet you that after that meeting JCS were burning the midnight oil trying to figure out how (1) to expedite training Iraqi troops, (2) how to convince somebody who doesn't know anything about the military that there's such things as strategy and tactics nad maybe get him to reconsider.<br>  <br>  In the mean tine, the terrorists are also in a quandary. How are they going to continue instilling terror if their rallying point is gone. They can have no idea of withdrawing. They don't want to lose whatever they've gained any more than does the US military. <br>  <br>  I would guess they'll use subterfuge. They'll go to the Iraqi government and promise that they'll stop all hostilities. However, the hostilities will continue. "It's not us," they'll protest. "We promised not to fight or terrorize, or anything like that. It's got to be some radicals. We ave no control over them. You can't blame us for their actions." So, I see, at best, perhaps a short-term let-up in the terrorist activities. But I see it coming back to its current level, if not a higher level.<br>  <br>  This is my reasoning. <br>  (1)  The initial drop in terrorist activities will support the terrorists' contention that they're honoring their promises to cease and desist.<br>  (2) The continued -- and projected gradual increase in terrorist activity (in spite of the promises of the terrorists) will be testing the Iraqi military and police to see how well they've been trained and how loyal they are. No doubt they'll be recruited by the terrorists.<br>  (3) Depending on how things work out for the terrorists in phase two, they'll either reinforce from Pakistan, Iran, or Afghanistan, or they'll strengthen their numbers from the Iraqi military and police... PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRAINED AND EQUIPPED BY US!<br>  (4) If the military can hold them, I see the terrorists with another problem. It'll be the same problem Hussein faced when he tried to play the "holy war" card during Desert Storm. The Muslim nations of the are didn't buy it because he had, after all, attacked a Muslim nation. The terrorists will be terrorizing Muslims, to wit, the Iraqi people. If that's the case, they may just fold up their tents and wander off to terrorize some other place.<br>  (5) They may broaden their horizons. They may "follow us." That's probably a little misleading. I have little doubt they're already here. Because nobody sees fit to police our borders and enforce our immigration laws, there are over 20 million illegals in this country. Of those about half a million are NOT from Mexico. The terrorists don't need a lot of people here. No more than a handful are keeping thing stirred up in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a pretty sizable Muslim population in the US. Terrorists have no problem mingling, and intimidating. A dirty bomb can be carried in a suitcase. Enough biological agent to destroy the  Northeastern United  States could be concealed in about the same space. So they're here. All they need is a phone call, or a birthday card, or maybe the dedication of a piece of music on a certain radio station.<br>  <br>  Why don't they do it now? Because thanks to the politicians, they're winnning one in Iraq. They don't want to distract from that. If we beat them in Iraq, we'll still have a strong military and they have a better chance of being hunted down. In spite of his protests to the contrary, I don't believe even a fanatic relishes the prospect of getting killed. If they did, we would be fighting an army of martyrs... very tough opponents. The only way to kill a martyr is to discredit him. And a martyr is almost impervious to that. So, we'd be fighting Hussein, or a slew of Hussein wannabes for decades as people rallied behind their memories and fought for their causes.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Probably, with the announcement there will be a short increase in danger while they get their last "official" licks in. Then I see a sharp decrease in danger while they pretend to honor their word. Then I suspect the danger will increase until we withdraw. "See! We drove the infidels from the land! You doubt? We are here. They are not."|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	It is difficult to say. The terrorists are not an organised army with a distinct chain of comment, and they are fanatical. Logic would say that they hold back lest they force a change of heart about the withdrawal, but logic and terrorism don't exactly go hand in hand. I would not count on it, particularly in the final days when things will be a little chaotic.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	You can't second guess the mind of a terrorist.  I've been wondering the same thing because I have relatives in Iraq and in Afghanistan.  I'm also worried because Obama is in office.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	They would be less safe. The reason is because unless you can pull all of your troops out in the same time span (very very short one at that) you are left with a lower number fighting the same number of guys. And on top of that the enemy would probably get even more ferocious since they want to "make a point". <br>  There would be too few soldiers to fight a war that more did.. it's very dangerous. Anyone who studies war knows this, it's very risky and not intended. Nobody goes into a war with the idea of pulling out.|`|92jr44kFaa	What makes you think we're leaving?

Pour ce qui concerne le budget de l'Elyse, elle devrait demander  son camarade Jospin, il en sait quelque chose.    En effet, ce que dit Mme Royal n'est qu'une demi-vrit. Avant 1997, l'Elyse bnficiait (comme la plupart des ministres) de fonds secrets, ainsi que de personnel rmunr par des ministres.  En 1997, Jospin ( la suite d'un scandale) a supprim les fonds secrets, et l'Elyse a d? vivre sur son budget, et seulement sur ce budget. Prcisons que ce budget est approuv par l'Assemble Nationale.  C'est pourquoi le budget a tant augment entre 1995 et 2006, car il fallait compenser la suppression des fonds secrets.

That liquor store is not a public place.  There is a difference between a place the public goes and a public place.  A public place is the street or a park.  Anyone can use the park and no one but the government / law can refuse someone entry.  However, a place like a store, shopping mall, shopping center etc. is privately owned and they are allowed to prohibit anyone from entering (except for those who are covered under a law - you can't deny entry to someone based on a disability, race, religion, etc.).      If that shopkeeper thinks your boyfriend drank that beer in the store, then he has the right to ask him to leave and not come back.  The only legal ground your boyfriend has is if the shopkeeper threatened him with bodily harm or assaulted him, then a police report could be filed or if your boyfriend believes he was asked to leave because of his race or religion, etc.|`|AA10754383	In the state of Florida and I believe in almost all states the owner or Representative of a business has the right to deny anyone the right to enter into their business.   Unfortunately the store owner would probably win out and if your BF returned there the owner potentially could call police to have him removed and or arrested for trespass.   At best if you have the ability (you) see if you can find out who the owner is actually. This may be a confused employee. Explain the situation to the owner and that there was a mistaken identity.   If things don't work out and he refuses to allow him back in or cooperate I would simply let it go and take your business elsewhere.  Good luck!

Il faudrait supprimer l'ide de profit dans une entreprise. Et vu qu'il veut limiter l'immigration qui reprsente une aubaine en main d'oeuvre bon march. Ce sera pire pour les entreprises.       Il ne veut pas supprimer les 35 heures (car il sait que c'est une bonne chose), les entreprises ne jouent pas le jeu du recrutement et useront et abuseront des heures supplmentaires qu'il souhaite defiscaliser.       Pour ce qui est de l'conomie internationale, la tendance va de plus en plus  la dlocalisation. Chose inquitante, ce n'est plus uniquement le secteur industriel mais aussi le tertiaire (avec les centre d'appels) qui dlocalisent.      Je pense sincrement que dans les annes qui viennent le chomage va devenir encore plus inquitant en Fance.  En parlant de cel l'annonce des chiffres corrigs du chomage ne paraitront qu'aprs les lctions, pourquoi ? je vous laisse deviner.       Pour finir, une chose certaine est le truquage des chiffres, reconnu comme tant un outil de droite.     A l'intrieur (ex. un chquier vol tait comptabilis en autant de chques en bois mis par le voleur sous Chevnement et  depuis Sarko, on ne compte plus qu'un seul dlit : le chquier vol).     Pour le chomage, on l'a stabilis, non pas en creant des emplois mais en radiant les demandeurs d'emplois (qui ne touchaient dj plus d'Assedic).

The USA supported the undemocratic regime of Cuba's president Batista. The result was that his regime was replaced by Castro's regime. Loser: USA, human rights.     The USA supported the undemocratic Vietnamese regime of president Diem. The result was that it was replaced by a communist regime.  Loser: USA, human rights. Winner: Lockheed, Boeing...    The USA have supported several potentates in Nigeria. The result is that one of the potentially richest countries in Africa is in deep trouble since decades. Loser: USA, human rights. Winner: Exxon Mobile, Halliburton.    The USA acted likewise in a large number of countries, especially in the other americas. Let me mention Nicaragua, Panama, Chile, Argentina...    If the USA had struggled for their own ideals instead of struggling for resources the world would be a better place.     But american politicians constantly made compromises with dictators, oil companies, death squads and drug lords.     In the case of dictator Chavez I expect that a number of consultants from Langley is already at work. Chavez is a nutter, but I am afraid his successor will be worse.    Let me suggest one thing:    If you bang your head against a brick wall you find out after a while that it really, really hurts.

Dubai city locals do not want the money which is in the governments hand because locals have an income of more than $ 150,000/year because as i told you Dubai people are traders and merchants. Also Dubai's people know that the money is wisely spent on the infrastructure " or where will you find a city that has a road with 7 lines, or cheap electricity that never had a blackout, or the most advanced airports and seaports in the world".

AA10464818	You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs     The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.    There is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	Start by going to the library and asking the Liberian to help you find the right reference book, you will be surprised by what is there......|`|80ef545ddb07b3917c2e0eb8bd674295aa	I don't know.

fYyMh3rxaa	California officers have jurisdiction throughout the state.  A peace officer can detain and arrest for any offense committed in his presence.  However, outside his or her primary jurisdiction, the officer generally has to call the local officer to actually transport and book the suspect or to write him a ticket.    Officers within the same county are generally part of a mutual pact among the various agency executives granting each agency PRIMARY jurisdiction within each political subdivision within the county.  This effectively allows all the agencies to issue citations for offenses observed elsewhere in the county without having to call for a local officer.    When officers travel from one city to another (transporting prisoners, attending meetings, etc.) this allows them to conduct themselves as police officers in their entirety without having to make the detention and call the local cop to do all the paperwork or write the ticket.    If you are seeing a lot of this in your cities, then it is possible that they are part of a multi-agency task force of one kind or another.  Many counties operate multi-agency traffic enforcement details, or, "road shows", as we sometimes call them.  Officers from a dozen agencies might descend on one locale to conduct high-visibility enforcement.    Without knowing the details, this is simply speculation.  But, at least in CA, our peace officer status does not end at the city limit or the county line.     - Carl|`|AA10298137	Any California peace officer (police, sheriff's deputy, CHP, etc.) has full authority anywhere in the state.  They each have areas of primary responsibility, but if they happen to be out of their area for whatever reason (training session, conference, driving home, etc.) they still have full police powers.|`|82c034bbba1a57407446ce3e9b74f6f2aa	They are probably CHP, or Sheriff's department.

liq6focoaa	Si votre mre habite au Portugal, c'est la loi portugaise qui s'appliquera. Je peux seulement vous donner quelques rgles juridiques dans la loi fran?aise (peut-tre il y a-t-il des similitudes).     Tout d'abord s'agit t-il d'une maison propre  votre mre, je suppose que tel est le cas, mais je pose quand mme la question.    Vous dites que votre mre a constitu un usufruit, elle peut annuler l'acte pour vice de consentement (il s'agit d'un contrat unilatral). Pour cela, il faut qu'elle prouve l'erreur ou le dol. La jurisprudence fran?aise retient le vice de consentement du fait de l'illtrisme des contractants, donc si votre mre souhaite agir il sera fort possible que l'acte soit annul. Elle peut galement invoquer la violence morale ventuellement, le rsultat sera le mme: l'annulation de l'acte. En revanche vous ne pouvez pas agir  sa place, sauf  chercher  la mettre sous un rgime de sauvegarde de justice, tutelle ou curatelle si elle remplit les conditions et si cela est conforme  vos souhaits.    Dans tous les cas, je vous conseille de vous renseigner auprs d'un avocat ou juriste au Portugal.|`|S0vWslwDaa	Si ele est saine d'esprit c'est elle qui doit tout regler.

Hz7ZRuKiaa	Security guards used to dress as closely as possible to the Chicago police officers: blue shirts, dark blue pants, and pie piece/teardrop shaped shoulder patches.    Superintendent O.W. Wilson redesigned the CPD hats in the 1960s.  He was familiar with the design of the police hats in England, where their hats have 3 layers of "checkerboard squares."  Wilson decided to use 2 layers for the CPD hats, with blue & white for police officers and yellow & blue for supervisors.      Security guards in Chicago couldn't use this hat design, in order for people to be able to immediately distinguish true police officers from security guards just by looking at the hat.|`|bc0bb2f863caac6bfc841de531d04b91aa	To the best of my recollection, I believe it was styled after the British Police Hats.

AA10254615	You're right, but the tricky situation is that as long as there are Americans and British there, then the Muslims are going to attack attack attack. Nobody is sure how strongly the Iraqi military has been trained, or even if they are being seriously trained and vetted for sectarianism, so when the west does withdraw, will there be a coup anyway?     I seriously doubt that Iraq can be a functioning democracy, there is too much bad blood which goes back to the 600s AD. If they are killing each other now over a 'wrong' succession from 1400 years ago, then they cannot cope with minor disagreements now. The Iraqis who are sensible, and not on the lunatic fringe have largely emigrated, and the poor have no choice but to be caught up in it, or join in it.    Bush has a lot to answer for, for opening this can of worms. Terrorism has been increased by it, but you're right. With the oil, they, the terrorists who might gain control, could be a force to be reckoned with, and the only solution then, would be sanctions against oil exports. This in turn, would force more anti-Americanism. And oil prices would continue to rise.    Nightmare.|`|AA10114303	You are wrong. Bush and Cheney should be impeached.

Concern in Hawai'i is running high due to the number of soldiers from Schofield Barracks who are operating in the area where the crash occurred.      AP file photo | June 2006                 A Black Hawk helicopter tied to Hawai'i's 25th Infantry Division went down today in northern Iraq, killing all 14 U.S. soldiers aboard, the military said, marking it the deadliest crash since January 2005.   The military said initial indications showed the UH-60 helicopter experienced a mechanical problem and was not brought down by hostile fire, but the cause of the crash was still under investigation.    It was one of two helicopters on a nighttime operation. The four crew members and 10 passengers who perished were assigned to Task Force Lightning, the military said. It did not release identities pending notification of relatives.    Concern in Hawai'i is running high due to the number of soldiers from Schofield Barracks who are operating in the area where the crash occurred.    Maj. Gen. Benjamin "Randy" Mixon, the commander of the 25th Infantry Division in Hawai'i, heads Multinational Division-North and is in charge of U.S. forces in northern Iraq.    The task force in Iraq has five to six combat brigades and includes more than 7,000 Schofield Barracks soldiers. Included in that force is the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade from Hawai'i and 90 to 100 helicopters.    Schofield soldiers, including the aviation brigade, are expected to begin rotating out of Iraq next month after 15 months of duty. The task force also has units and helicopters from outside Hawai'i.    Lt. Col. Michael Donnelly, a spokesman with Task Force Lightning in northern Iraq, said this morning that the notification is ongoing, and out of respect for the families and loves ones, "it is too early to say where the crash victims were from."     "This is a grave loss for Task Force Lightning and we are doing our best to be there for the families, pray for them and keep them close," Donnelly said. "We lost 14 great Americans and warriors; it is a difficult time for us all.    "We will get through this and stay focused on our mission here to bring peace and security for the Iraqi people," Donnelly said.    The U.S. military relies heavily on helicopters to avoid the threat of ambushes and roadside bombs  the deadliest weapon in the militants' arsenal  and dozens have crashed in accidents or been shot down.    The deadliest crash occurred on Jan. 26, 2005, when a CH-53 Sea Stallion transport helicopter went down in a sandstorm in western Iraq, killing 31 U.S. troops. Twenty-seven were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, at Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii.    Kalana na Koa! Ikakai! Imua!

Donc ils ne peuvent absolument pas jouer sur leur marge. dans ce contexte l'EURO nous pnalise normment plus que les allemands.  Les syndicats se fichent bien des problmes rencontrs par les entreprises et la France. Ils s'en fichent d'autant plus qu'ils ne cessent de demander des embauches dans la fonction publique alors que la France n'en peut plus et qu'elle vit au-dessus de ses moyens.  Tout ceci est de la faute de notre mauvaise gestion depuis plus de 30 ans (Dernier budget en quilibre vot par l'assemble en 1974).

En France, le syndicat auquel il appartient fait une grve de solidarit pour protester.   La diffrence rside dans lexercice du droit de grve et dans la comprhension des intrts gnraux.    Pour parvenir rapidement  des accords gagnant-gagnant, ou donnant-donnant, et viter ainsi des grves, il faut ds le dpart une confiance rciproque entre les partenaires, chose qui n'existe pas en France, chacune des parties, par exprience et connaissance de la partie adverse, ayant tendance  rclamer l'impossible pour obtenir un peu.

Et puis les patrons fran?ais sont frileux. A la chute du mur de Berlin les entreprises allemandes et d'autres ont toutes ouvert des filiales dans les ex-pays du Pacte de Varsovie. En France on a attendu. Et puis quand ces pays sont rentrs dans la CEE on s'en est proccup, mais toutes les places taient prises !

EjX9p9dBaa	Well since you asked this question in the military section, I am going to answer assuming that somehow the USA and China set aside their differences and became allies and then told the rest of the world to screw off and start a fight.    In my opinion this war would be bigger than all other wars combined.  Assuming no WMDs are used cause if they are the war is over and the insects inherite the earth.    First the USA and China would have to fight the developed nations of the world and defeat them.  These nations would would pose the biggest threat to the USA and China.  These would be nations like Russia, UK, Germany, France and so on.  These nations have military power that when combined would be a major force.  China would have the advantage of population on its side and the USA would bring technology, although even if they were allies I don't think they would share technology.    After the developed nations were defeated the new allies would have to fight the developing nations like India.  These militaries are up and coming and could soon be a force.  After that would be the undeveloped nations that while militarly would not be a threat, they still would need to be defeated.    A war like this would not be fought be the rules of today trying to minimize civilian losses, I think it would be more old school where the bombing and leveling of major cities would occur.    In the event of this happening though I think the world would be left a disaster because of all the destruction.|`|38cb0ddf2ca1a32947b42567d9cd4291aa	china is our mortal enemy,and we send them billionsof dollars a year to help fund there military, by buying all of the cheap crap that they produce. it wasn't enough for them to kill our dog's and our cat's, now they are sending us tainted food and toothpaste. they are also the biggest polluters on the planet. one day we will have to deal with these evil people.|`|5ThWoOPaaa	I hope we aren't allies with a country that kills its own citizens, and harvests organs from political prisoners.|`|UKajN3CAaa	Grow up.

The fact that they're advertising on television more than likely means that they are able to take on more clients than they currently have.     In addition, when they advertise like that, you have to keep in mind that they've just opened themselves up to everyone, including those who are in charge of mandating their ethics. So, if you have a problem with an attorney who advertises, it's more likely than not that the person you're going to talk to has seen that commercial, they're going to know who they are and where to find them. One might think that they're more reliable. But, again, you can't base reliability on advertising. If we did that, everyone would buy the "Magic Bullet" (TM) and the "Food Saver 9000" (TM again).|`|AA10515896	Sometimes yes, sometimes no -- just like any other business.

This is just another check on the government that Americans created to keep them in line.|`|8kV0nNHeaa	I think the framers wanted the President to at least appear to be directly elected by the people, not by the legislature.    In the sense that we have the Electoral College, we do have a Parlimentary system. We elect that legislature to elect the President.    I think the Parlimentary system is worse than ours could be. Most people who like the Parlimentary system actually like the fact that they tend to have more valid parties. I think Americans would be better served with more than two parties, not necessarily a parlimentary system though.

zEHU0E9Yaa	Fortunately, I had the good luck to be able to attend college under the professorship of people who had actually taken part in the civil rights movement. People like Herb Simons, Bobby Seale, and Sonia Sanchez. There is nothing like learning from someone who was there first hand.    The ACLU is an organization that was born out of the necessity that even though the ERA has been put to vote for decades now, the United States is closer to passing a flag-burning amendment than one that grants all of it's citizens equal  rights. Even South Africa has passed an ERA as part of it's constitution, and one that includes sexual orientation at that.    There is a definite smear campaign by conservatives that the ACLU is controlled by left-wing radicals, but in truth it's similar to the pro-choice/pro-life arguments.    On one hand, the pro-lifers are saying that no one should have abortions. By no means does that qualify that people who are pro-choice are claiming everyone should have an abortion. It simply means that they are saying that the option should be available.    And, like I was comparing, there are those who do not believe in ensuring civil equality for all citizens. The ACLU is not a facility that only grants favoritism to one minority group, and it is not an institution where minorities are chosen favorably over the majority. The whole point behind the Union is to ensure equal rights of everyone. Including minorities. Including conservatives. Everyone. Because they understand that until an Equal Rights Amendment is passed, everyone is at risk. Even those who are in power today may be at risk tomorrow.    We should be making arrangements to make sure every law-abiding citizen has the rights and opportunities to achieve the ideals set forth by our forefathers, belief in the rights to life, liberty and property.|`|ZaLPd25Yaa	No otherwise they would not fight for Hush Bimbo.|`|b74222ab84625a98e519e55038843a30aa	No.  They are an organization that fights for civil liberties of all people.

"George Bush's Crime Family" who wanted to go steal from the "Bank of Iraq" (Iraq's oil and the no bid contracting game) were warned about this, and as long as they continue to not use adaquate people to clean up this mess (which never was done even from the get go) no one will hold them accountable because it isn't most people's kids going in there, it is your friends' friends' friends' kids.|`|fa7f74e81e43f2d7b309f4c3c767cc99aa	yes|`|2662bff905d732c360e759fb500fa522aa	Can you give me the source of the info.|`|uVZXENs2aa	Your facts are a little bit slanted!! do you think he was a little pissed by being replaced by Paul Bremer??|`|z6vLJ0uOaa	The Pentagon plans a troop reduction and disbandment of Iraq's army?

GZpqWb9taa	Absolutely swimming is part of the training regimen for US Marines.   WWII taught the military a great deal, the hard way,  about what to teach its recruits.

You must of been released into your fathers custody or you would have Had to go for a bail hearing. Get this part straight, you have been charged and that's the bottom line Mr. Capone, a lawyer will be appointed to you or you can have your father hire you a lawyer. The lawyer will go to court with you and he or she will be provided with all the evidence the prosecuter has against you, this is called DISCOVERY. Then you and your lawyer will go over all the evidence including the police officers notes that they took during their arrest of you. Any thing you said will be put there in evidence. It's not a kids game, you have been arrested, you have been charged, and you are now released under your fathers supervision. As I said you will go through the whole legal system of the courts and you now have a record for life guilty or not guilty.

There are way too many people who would be in on it and with a crippled administration you'd have people running to the first microphone.

Certainly the circumstances were rather suspicious, but it's hard to say just to what extent there was a conspiracy. I would say that at the very least the american government was probably aware that something was going to be carried out beforehand and deliberately failed to do anything about it. At most, it's still quite concievable that they could have set the whole thing up themselves. There are a lot of loose ends involved that would be tied up neatly if there had been a large-scale conspiracy, but at the same time I think many of the things that the conspiracy buffs have pointed out aren't really that important (like the 'pod' and the 'UFO').

Let us presume that the average person has a 0.1% chance of leaking a secret each month, which is pretty small.    10 such people over the course of 5 years have a...5.66% chance of leaking the secret (according to the calculator).  That means there is a 1 in 20 chance that someone talks during that period.    25 people over 10 years = 22.2% chance, or about 1 in 5.    And so on and so forth.  What this means is that the more people who know about something and the more time passes makes the secret coming out almost certain.      The only way to keep a secret is to kill everyone involved; if you are the perpetrator of the conspiracy and everyone around you is dying, that always looks really suspicious.     *********    The real problem with many conspiracy theories is that they rely too heavily upon coincidence, they link events that are truly unrelated, and they state claims with absolutely no tangible, credible, or physical evidence to support them.  They are mostly guesswork and are generally born out of fear.|`|UEU6snzfaa	Naw.

zgiTwzhSaa	My son will be 16 in June and he very much wants to join The U.S. Army too. I really hope that he does because I feel that it is something that every young American Male should do. I know that it can sometimes be dangerous but so can walking across the street. I think that you should also be Proud of your son, as I am of mine. Even more so if they do decide to enlist. As a father, what could make you prouder than having a son who has served in the Military? Especially in today's world.|`|fRAY1iJdaa	Service to one's country should be a duty, not a choice in my opinion.  But do encourage him to join a service other than the Army.  Unless we're trying to establish long-term military bases in Iraq, it's time we bring the troops home.  Remind him that the war is no longer about freedom or safeguarding our way of life.  If he dies in Iraq, he's dying for a civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.  If Al Qaeda does establish training camps in Iraq, we can take them out the same way we took out the Taliban in Afghanistan without so much troop commitment.|`|AA11538654	If your son asks for your input, give him honest answers to his questions as best as you can.  If he makes the decision without your input, support his choice the best you are able, but remember that you raised him to become a MAN, and in this country that is one of the first choices a man must make...all must register, but actually enlisting is different.  Should he go into the service, there are many things he can choose to study that will not put him in the middle of the war in Iraq.  He will need to take the ASVAB, if he has not already done so, from the scores he receives there he will be able to choose his formal training after basic training.  It is our job as parents to guide them the best way we can and then let them go to learn what they need to in the real world.  Unfortunately they can not learn from our life experiences, but must learn from their own.  My daddy always told me he wished I could just learn from HIS mistakes instead of having to make my own and learn the hard way...Listen to his ideas, hug him, tell him you love him and then let him decide!

People from all the nations in the world dream of the educational opportunities of the United States; they dream of becoming doctors, scientists, astronauts etc and here you are already in this country and you believe sending your son into harms way is an honorable thing to do?

They found a medical problem (thank God or we wouldnt have known) and was not allowed in. So, I can only answer as a man who enlisted in the Army in 1972 as a 17 year old. This was just after Viet Nam. My friends said the same thing. I was fully aware of the negative responses the Vets of Nam went through. I still enlisted. It was the best decision I have made to date. The service literally made a man of me. I gained more knowledge and street smarts than I could ever acquire by going to college. I may not have a degree or the most prestigous job of those friends, but I know how to get through life better than they ever will. Love him and let him make his own choice.

Les partis "troskyste" dont la LCR se sont justements consituts en opposition  la politique men par Staline. Trosky lui mme fut assassin sur ordre de Staline et sur les 100 millions de morts du rgime stalinien, on peut compter un nombre non ngligeable de troskyste. Dire que Besancenot est un hritier de Staline est un non-sens qui dmontre que celui qui pose la question n'a pas rellement cherch  se renseigner sur ce dont il parle.     Quant au PCF, on peut effectivement dplorer son alignement pass sur Moscou. Nanmoins, si certains hauts dirrigeants du PCF de l'poque sont clairement coupables d'avoir dissimul la vrit et peuvent tre considr comme complice de Staline, la trs large majorit des adhrents du PCF de l'poque tait maintenu dans la totale ignorance du rgime Stalinien.     Pour ma part, j'ai adhr au PCF il y'a une paire d'anne. La chute du mur de Berlin et la fin du rgime sovitique est pour moi l'un des vnements les plus heureux de ces dernires dcnies.   Le PCF d'aujourd'hui a clairement reni toute filiation avec l'idologie stalinienne et son programme est le programme d'un communisme du XXIme sicle sans rapport aucun avec l'ex rgime sovitique.   Staline a dnatur le mot "communiste", mais ce mot existait avant lui, tire une partie de ses origines dans la commune de Paris de 1870, une autre dans les oeuvres de Marx et Hengels et peut exister sans Staline.     Bref, cette question est un non-sens car aucune comparaison ne peut tre faite entre le PCF et la LCR d'aujourd'hui et l'URSS d'il y'a 50 ans.    Petite prcision sur l'influence du communisme : certes, le PCF a fait un score faible aux prsidentielles, mais si on additionne LCR + LO + PCF + Schivardi + Bov qui relvent tous plus au moins d'une idologie d'extrme gauche, on approche des 10%. Loin d'tre ngligeable et en tout cas "suprieur" s'il faut faire une comparaison avec le FN, Megret et De Villier.   On ne peut pas parler d'une "majorit silencieuse" d'extrme droite et une minorit ultra mdiatis d'extrme gauche. Ce serait mme plut?t l'inverse.     D'ailleurs, comment se fait-il que le PCF dirrige de nombreuses mairies, conseil gnraux, aient des lus rgionaux ?

Hamilton was responsible for framing the finicial skeleton of the republic and also shaping the role government would play in free enterprise. Had Hamilton not been of foreign birth (and seriously undisciplined) he certainly could have been considered a serious candidate for the heated election of 1800.

Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist at the time of our nation's founding, was more idealistically aligned with today's Republican Party policies and platform.   Alexander Hamilton was in favor of a strong military, influential federal reserve, and rule by elitists. Sounds a lot like today's Republicans.   Thomas Jefferson was more inclined to back farmers rights and ideals then those of wealthy merchants. He felt that the less the government interfered with American's personal lives, the better. He was not a deeply religious man and felt that federal funding could be accomplished through import tariffs and not through the taxation of land owners.   Both were great Americans and both sides helped shape the United States by drafting a much needed constitution (with the Bill of Rights) to replace the weak Articles of Confederation.|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	I don't understand your question.

Je pense aussi qu'il faut faire vraiment attention  ceux qui travaillent dans ces milieux. Les mdecins, les gardiens et autres. Leur permettre de changer d'air rgulirement, les accompagner pour dcompresser...  Et bien s?r, ne pas enfermer des enfants, des innocents...  Trs idaliste, tout cela, n'est-ce-pas ? Mais certaines choses sont pourtant possibles, avec de l'imagination, de la bonne volont et de la solidarit.      PS : Et attention aux mlanges dtonnants, qui engendrent la violence !|`|MLjCIX5Taa	La prison devrait en effet rinsrer, et surtout ne pas enfermer des personnes qui n'y ont pas leur place. Car il faut savoir que beaucoup de dtenus souffrent actuellement de pathologies psychologiques svres et que leur place serait davantage dans un HP. mais comme il n'y a pas suffisamment de lits mdicaliss, on les met en prison. Il y a alors d'normes souffrances car on le sait, il n'y a aucun  soins adapts en milieu carcral (je me rfre  Nathalie Mnigon, qui a fait plusieurs  ruptures d'anvrismes).   De l  dire que la prison s'est peu  peu transforme en mouroir (cf les longues peines, d'hommes malades de + de 80 ans : un reportage intressant sur France 3 il y a peu).  Pour ce qui est des plus jeunes, la prison n'est bien entendu pas la solution. la solution est l'ducation que certains parents ne sont pas en mesure de donner.  La rflexion devrait tre mene galement sur le sol amricain : Guantanamo n'est pas le reflet d'une trs grande lgalit.|`|zHWzbizYaa	La socit met en prison ce qu'elle de ne veut pas voir: la pauvret, la misre, la dchance, les ames perdues...    Dans certaines tribus amrindiennes quand un homme tuait un autre homme, sa peine tait de subvenir aux besoins de la famille de sa victime, et d'duquer les enfants.  C'est pas mal non ?  Je propose que les prisons soient dtruites et que les coupables soient au plus vite mis au travail pour le bien de la communaut. C'est ainsi qu'il rpareront leur faute le temps qu'il faudra suivant la gravit de celle-ci. Dans un premier temps il auront obligation de rintgrer une unit d'habitation surveille, mais ds qu'un jury populaire donnera l'autorisation, et s'ils se montrent coopratifs, ils devrons aussi reprendre la responsabilit de leur vie...logement, nourriture, habillement,ect... Jusqu' prouver par leur comportement qu'ils sont totalement rinsrs dans la socit. Tout ?a tapes par tapes. Et cela doit tre un long chemin pour un criminel, cela peut tre plus bref pour un petit dlinquant, mais il faut qu'il sorte "guri" des affres de sa vie antrieur. Quand aux malades mentaux dangereux, leur place n'a jamais t en prison mais  l'h?pital psychiatrique.|`|1263b9724a038cff617e4fb259696393aa	La prison est avant tout le meilleur moyen de protger les citoyens des dlinquants et criminels. Ensuite, elle est la punition que le dit hors-la-loi a mrite de par son attitude et ses actes.  Un criminel ayant t condamn  la prison  perptuit (pour un crime particulirement odieux) ne doit pas tre remis en libert. Cette peine est proportionnelle  l'acte commis. Combien de ces dtenus ritrent ds sortis de prison ! A-t'on le droit de mettre en pril la vie de tous les autres parce que l'on veut faire preuve de mansutude envers un seul ???   Le r?le de la prison est multiple : dissuasif car rpressif, mais galement social ; tout est une question de relation de cause  effet. Un petit voleur ne doit pas tre trait de la mme manire qu'un pdophile multircidiviste, par exemple... La prison devrait tre aussi ducative, pour permettre  de petits dlinquants d'tre recadrs trs srieusement, pour une bonne insertion dans la socit (je ne parle pas de "rinsertion"  dessin, car certains n'ont jamais t insrs...).

Quand on voit de nombreux multirecidivistres, pour la 4 ou la 5me fois devant la mme chambre correctionnelle, ayant fait de la prison ferme, (sans sursis) Toutefois sont but originelle tait et est toujours de  faire prendre conscience de ses actes, de reinserer ou de tenter de reinserer une personne qui s' est loign du droit chemin. C'est aussi une mesure de protection pour la socit mais aussi de l' individu contre lui mme. En effet la prison permet de recevoir les premiers soins necessaires. Faute de mieux la prison est un mal ncssaire. Cela fait videmment de la peine de voir dans un tribunal des personnes qui certes n' ont commis que de "petits" litiges et que l' on est oblig de mettre en prison mais il faut ce dire que d' un cot c' est pour leur bien. Mme si il y a des cas dsesperant. Je me situe dans cette rponse sur vis  vis de la correctionnelle.|`|PIaAUcjZaa	Aujourd'hui, il existe tout un tas d'alternatives  la prison, le problme est qu'il n'y a pas de fond pour que leurs mises en oeuvre soit efficaces. De plus, La politique actuelle n'est plus  la prvention mais  la rpression, c'est que ce doit tre, soit plus conomique, soit trs lucratif. La prvention, malgr ce qui a t dit, est une bonne alternative, cela a empch pas mal de jeunes de se casser la gueule encore plus, l'conomie...les prison vont tre privatises.......  La prison doit avoir pour r?le de protger les citoyens lambda. Il y a des dysfonctionnements qui servent la peine de mort car lorsque l'on entend qu'un rcidiviste a massacr des enfants, cela donne la haine aux gens!  Le problme est que les rcidivistes pdophiles, violeurs, et autres psychopathes de tout genre, ne sont pas pris en charge psychologiquement. Il y a quelques annes, les subventions se sont taries et les fous se sont retrouv hors des h?pitaux psychiatriques  parce que cela cout moins cher, mais cela tait fin au dpit du bon sens car les "fous" se sont retrouv livr  eux mmes, avec des fois des visites accompagnateurs, sociaux, insuffisantes, d'o des drives et le remplissage des prison!  Bref, ce n'est pas simple!  Pour moi le premier r?le de la prison est de protger les citoyens, mais cela devrait tre constructif pour la personne emprisonne, ce qui n'est pas assez le cas.|`|Gk9108BLaa	la prison n'a plus vraiment lieu d'tre dans son tat actuel sauf pour protger la socit des vrais criminels.

Il existe les personnels de surveillance (les "matons") et les personnels d'insertion et de probation.  La peine d'emprisonnement est uniquement la privation de llibert et rien d'autre.   Il existe bien entendu des peines alternatives  l'emprisonnement mais un r?le plus humain de la prison est de permettre aux victimes et  leurs familles de faire le travail de deuil ncessaire  toute reconstruction aprs une agression, quelle qu'elle soit.  La libration de criminels ayant purgs leur peine est normale, nous sommes dans un tat de droits et maintenir une personne en prison sous pretexte que son geste est impardonnable d'un point de vue strictement moral irait  l'encontre de cette notion et ouvrirait la porte  l'arbitraire.  Il est vrai qu'il faut rflchoir sur le sens  donner  la peine et au temps d'emprisonnenemnt et l'associer  d'autres moyens pour viter ou limiter la rcidive. C'est le cas.  Chaque dtenu arrivant en dtention fait l'objet d'une priode d'observation, il rencontre diffrents partenaires (mdecins, psy, ducateurs, assistantes sociales, conseiller d'insertion) qui dtectent chez lui des lments sur lesquels travailler pendant l'incarcration: analphabtisme, dpendances, alcoolisme, en fait tous les facteurs qui ont conduits  l'incarcration et il est alors mis en place un parcours personnalis en fonction des individus. Certains recevront des cours ou des formations professionnelles leur permettant de retouver une place dans la socit  leur libration, d'autres auront des soins mdicaux pour lutter contre la toxicomanie et l'alcoolisme et d'autres auront un suivi psy. Certains auront droit  la panoplie complte.  Chaque cas est diffrent .  Le taux de rcidive est certes lev mais les intervenants du milieu carcral font un travail norme pour le faire baisser et dans certains cas ce taux de rcidive baisse ds lors qu'une prise en charge efficace est mise enplace ds la premire incarcration|`|5868343a81ff28d3c5ad868b3e7ca677aa	La prison ne devrait tre utilise qu'en cas de crimes graves car sinon elle fabrique des dlinquents encore plus dangereux  leur sortie !

TwqpkWfZaa	Emancipation in the United States  Emancipation is not available in every state in the United States. Where it is available, emancipation is a legal process by which minors can attain legal adulthood before reaching the age at which they would normally be considered adults (this is called the age of majority). The rights granted to legally emancipated minors might include the ability to sign legally binding contracts, own property, and keep ones own earnings. However, each state has different laws governing emancipation and some states simply have no law or legal process concerning emancipation. In states where minors wishing to become legally emancipated will have to break new legal ground.    This page is designed to give minors information on the laws and available legal processes regulating emancipation in their state. The information is based on available state legal statutes and in some cases also includes information obtained from various legal aid organizations in that state. Some states have different legal terms for emancipation and can also differ in their definition of the rights granted to an emancipated minor.

Nothing on the planet is perfect but to allow this part to get so far out of control is not acceptable. Talk to the few truly honest and respectable cops who you might find here and ask about the crimes they commit that are charged to others! And don't think for one second this doesn't happen. If cops kill 2 people and capture the third, that person will be charged with 2 counts of murder. Sound fair! Justice is not blind it is IGNORANT!!

kif21UOdaa	Get some free legal help, but make some calculations to start with. You've spent $90K. Is that just on renovations or does that include rates, expenses, etc? That figure amounts to $173 per week (average over the years). Did she provide both food and lodging, ie, food? I'm guessing the rate notices were in her name, and even if you paid them, you could not claim full ownership of the property. You may be able to take her to court for some compensation of the amount you've put into the property, but the magistrate would look at whether $173 per week was an appropriate amount of "board and lodging" by looking at what was the standard of accommodation provided to you, and what else she gave you (such as free use of phone?)    If you simply had a room, and got a meal a day, that amount would be considered excessive and she may have to reimburse you "x" amount.    More questions in deciding:   Were you in a defacto relationship? That is, did you have a relationship that could be considered to be that of a married couple? Because this could also make all the difference, and you'd be entitled a share in the property. But to do that you also have to go to court.    Most legal companies will give one-hour of free legal advice. You may also qualify for free legal aid if you're living in Australia.     Please feel free to email me directly if I can help further.

So, applying from Singapore would be advisable.     Regardless of the country you reside, H1 visas have its own qualifications that you must satisfy. A special number of H1 visas are given to SIngaporean CITIZENS. But I do not think you can qualify for this, because you are still and Indian Citizen. You must have an employer from the US to support your application and various legal papers to produce before and H1 can be issued.|`|Kq9kYxcQaa	better if u apply from india

Creo que cambiar o no cambiar es bueno de acuerdo a lo que hayas relexionado sobre tu vida, porque si lo que tienes o lo que eres te hace feliz para que cambiarlo? sin embargo estoy de acuerdo en que en general los cambios nos dan miedo pues aunque nos traigan un beneficio siempre implican una perdida que a veces nos es muy dificil de aceptar, son las consecuencias de nuestras desiciones y pesa mucho esa responsabilidad!!!|`|AB4jGgtVaa	Francisco el hombre por naturalesa va en contra de los cambios me refiero directamente a los cambios en uno mismo no en los demas|`|GMfPSCkGaa	Mas facil :  Creer, asumir, ceder.

MAs util, creo que dudar, pero no seria una regla general, se me ocurren muchas situaciones en que no seria lo mas util.    Y para concretar, tambien tendria la pregunta que ser mas concreta. Por ejemplo, que la intencion de la "reforma energetica" sea privatizar Pemex,  ddalo.  Otro, que el rayito gan las elecciones con 500,000 votos de ventaja, como el dijo, ddalo. Que el Tribunal dio su veredicto legalizando el fraude y que por lo tanto, al demo?o las instituciones, ddalo.    Y dudar lo que te puse de ejemplo, no te hace fascista, ni panista, ni fecalista. Simplemente pone en accion a tus neuronas, nadie te pide que apoyes a lo que no le crees, solo te invito a dudar de los dogmas del rayito.

En el caso del gobierno mexicano ha sido opuesto ya que todos los candidatos presidenciales que ofrecan cambios radicales y extraordinarios de hacer poltica (Fox por ejemplo) terminan siendo aun peores que sus antecesores, por eso el dicho de "mas vale malo por conocido que bueno por conocer" y se que es una frase de lo mas conformista pero es una realidad, por eso la mayora de los mexicanos ya no creemos en polticos supuestamente "honestos" que ofrecen maravillas (tipo Lopez Obrador), all radican los 70 a?os del priismo y como vamos el 2012 retornarn.

Creo que tu pregunta es referente al ser humano en si.....    Para mi la zona de confort es la mediocridad y conformismo del ser humano, caemos en ella precisamente por los constantes cambios al hacer un balance nos quedamos ah    Yo creo que el plantameamiento es relativo, porque depende de los cambios, dudas o creencias y lo que influyen en la vida de cada individuo afectan o benefician en la medida de su capacidad de respuesta    Saludos|`|152ff4cb2ef39ad397d5557ea44d8ad5aa	Muy difcil cuestionamiento:    Toda persona quiere estar en la zona confort, obviamente porque es lo que mas le conviene, en una u otra forma.    El cambio no siempre implica perdida, ni siempre es bueno, puesto que hay cambios negativos.    Hablando de nuestro pais, y de las cuestiones politicas , es reallmente concretyar algo, el cambio tiende a residir con que la gente quiere y entienda EL BENFICIO DE UN CAMBIO.    Los PANISTAS se quejan de que la ideologia de los"mugrosos" como despectivamente llaman a la gente de bajos recursos(salvo unas contadas y respetuosas excepciones) no quieren crecer, porque les gusta que les regalen, pues si es cierto, desgraciadamente la gente movilizada por la caja de ilusiones, cree a ciencia cierta lo que le dice, como debe de vestir, llamar a sus hijos, enamorarse y comer, diciendoles que el pobre le va bien, el rico es malo porque es villano y tiene poder, si tu te vuelves rico, seras malo, por esos quedate como pobre, claro hazme rico consumiendo mi porqueria que te vendo, que te envenena y que te hace gordo, pero a mi me hace rico.    Ahora los PEJISTAS, AMARILLOS(la supuesta izquierda, pues) dice que cambio reside en quitar las bases la corrupcin de gobierno, transparentar y sin embargo tiene en sus filas a muchos parias que el PRI ya no quiere, que son mas ratas que nada y su regimen de trasnparencia es dubitable(multiples soliccitudes a los organos de trsnparencia en revisin lo comprueban).    Del PRI ni hablo, ya esta mas hundido que nada, si votan por el , volveriamos a redundar en que la gente tiene conformismo a saber lo que segun le conviene.    Lo que es necesario si es cierto, cambiar es parte de la vida, pero internamente; ahora hacer que la gente quiera entender la necesidad de un cambio, ESO SI QUE ES DIFICIL.    SALUDOS|`|bo9GKtmsaa	Mas facil: Creer, Resistir  Mas util: Dudar, Ceder

Obama 08 (although if hilary got it i wouldnt be too upset, she'd probably still do a good job. or at least she'd do a hell of alot better than any republican)    ps and if your getting bogged down with all these little things like this then it makes me think you dont really care about this election that much. focus on the facts and things that might actually have a chance on affecting the way our country runs like foreign policy, health care, tax reform, civil rights, ENVIROMENTAL ISSUES, homeland security and all those other topics that dont have to do with dirty politics and shamelessly tearing down each runner with comepletly blown out of proportion issues. lets focus on the ones that acually matter, c'mon people! think!!!|`|AA10146150	Neither of them can come up with there own stuff.

pyEwubiFaa	Sarkozy est  mon grand regret, le choix de la majorit des Fran?ais qui ont vot.  Qu'il prenne les Fran?ais pour des ahuris, est une vidence ; mais il est lu et il faut faire avec.  Il est surtout le valet des grands industriels dont il admire la russite.  Il croit faire partie de leur monde car il les c?toie depuis plusieurs dcennies, mais en fait il "n'a rien compris au film".  La plupart des gens qui ont vot pour Sarkozy n'ont vu dans son programme qu'une ou 2 mesures qui les intressaient au premier chef, mais certainement pas les consquences pour eux, d'lire quelqu'un qui de toute fa?on, n'a pas de politique.  Il navigue  vue au gr des vnements, sans se rendre compte qu'il se contredit  longueur de temps et, de ce fait, perd de plus en plus de crdit auprs des gens qui se rendent compte de ses errements dans diffrents mondes qui n'ont aucun rapport avec mener la politique d'un pays.

Y de no convencerme con el anlisis, de todas maneras correra gritando y se?alndolo ante el mundo gritando...    ?URIBEEEEEE!|`|WMrWaDdiaa	Es buena imaginacin, Primero no deberamos matar porque es un ni?o y es austriaco y era judo y puede ser quienes lo hicieron prejuicio sino llvalo a Israel para acostumbrar o convertirlo al judasmo o juntar con buenas personas a otro lado para evitar. Y tambin los rabes tienen reconocen antes quien lo ocuparon los judos en sus tierras. Aseguramos no haran ms Las guerras y los  terrorismos!!!
coitA4n1aa	Who's heard of the No borders policy and RFID chips already started to be put in use? The NAU is already here.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	Hey aren't those the guys that make that yummy breakfast cereal, Amerios ?|`|fnNIcSuJaa	America is bigger than the United States. Borders are nothing but illegitimate man made lines in the dirt. No one has any right to say that because they happened to be born in one state that they get to decide who can enter or leave the entire united states. The only land you have the right to control who comes and goes is your own.|`|rZoyQGmsaa	I have heard of it and fear it.  That said, the only way for it to occur is to have the people of all 3 countries vote on it and though Mexico may support it you can bet that the US and Canadian people will not.|`|g9TDdjYaaa	I think it's already here. The EU went off without a hitch and I think that the NAU is right behind it. I agree with you, I don't want to be an American or a Mexican, I don't have anything against you or them but we need to preserve our national sovereigntys.|`|YY17shmVaa	its all part of a big plan the new world order. everything that is happening in govt all revolves around that idea. visit threeworldwars.com|`|kbZC2foiaa	Canadians don't want to be Americans or Mexicans either.    The third world sucks.|`|yIng1lL6aa	its happening, behind closed doors, with no approval of the American people or anyone else, just the elite, by 2010 this could become  a very real fact.|`|QYYhIlAZaa	yes the "amero" or something in that aspect like the "euro"  for the currency,it wouldnt help,and the reality of being fenced in is not good|`|7V1eMyh6aa	It can't happen, its against the consitution.
77XKYNY5aa	I think that the theory behind it is good; to have a place for nations to settle disputes, but in practice it stinks. Imagine this corrupt organization dictating to countries such as the US, what we can, and can not do. Look into the Law of the Seas Treaty as an example. I think that the current UN has outlived its usefulness and it totally worthless at resolving any disputes.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	Get out of it.  Tear the building down and put in a parking lot, something the people of New York could actually benefit from.|`|Aaobhxlnaa	It's just a do-nothing organization with terrorists inside funded mostly by the USA and wastes our tax payer dollars and demonizes Israel (and the USA).|`|qVtZWhdyaa	I think it's a corrupt and defunct organization. I also think the US government is corrupt and defunct, so it's not like I dislike the UN because it resists the US government. They both suck. The thing is, the UN receives most of it's funding from the US and that's what pisses me off the most about it. How is the UN "international law" when it would collapse if the US did not support it?|`|6hWvYNbiaa	The UN is a necessary evil. Not for what they do but for what we can learn from it.    History has shown that we are continually growing larger and larger. Small communities banded together to make states, states come together to form nations. I believe the idea of a world-wide government is going to be inevitable but we need to learn how to make it work. The Articles of Confederation were a learning experiment that showed us how NOT to run a federal government. The UN is teaching us a myriad of things. I hope we have the wisdom and intelligence to learn them.|`|JxeZUJIYaa	the UN is a tool of manipulation for the so-called first world.|`|J16FOdVeaa	The UN is a rat-infested organization.  They want America to intervene everywhere and then villify us when we actually do.|`|TGHckD8faa	Like the Mafia and other organized crime groups, they struggle for a mantle of respectability, but it doesn't quite come off as believable.|`|Yfckwv1paa	i think they're neat. so is the UNCF. yay!|`|YY17shmVaa	the un has failed everywhere they went.
lb9oPQUvaa	Ustedes necesitan libertad. Cuando tengan verdadera democracia recien podrn empezar a cambiar. Antes no porque vos quers terminar con los viejos rencores cuando esos "viejos rencores" siguen en el gobierno. As no se puede.|`|633356e783c2be973239be08e473cbb1aa	Espero que lo hagan.|`|J7njj7coaa	TENDRIAN QUE DARSE VUELTA COMO UNA MEDIA Y ACTUAR|`|9972a3e99fa6adb6e254df788e4ae679aa	pues entonces deja de quejarte y termina con tu gobierno socialista|`|59MoXPbxaa	Todos tienen que poner su granito de arena para que Cuba sea Feliz despues de ese infierno que han vivido y todavia viven.La democracia los va ayudar.Suerte por una cuba libre y democratica.|`|afUTyUJyaa	Soy Venezolano, exilado y gran admirador de la historia de Cuba. Que viva una Cuba Democratica y Socialista! Que viva una LatinoAmerica Unida y Democratica!       Todos los LatinoAmericanos debemos luchar juntos para llegar a una verdadera democracia, con garantias de desarrollo para eliminar la pobreza y un plan diplomatico para acabar con la ocupacion Yanki en Colombia y America Central. Con un plan para eliminar a los rufianes de la FARC, regular a las corporaciones gringas y desarrollar las industrias nacionales.      LAU!!! LAU!!!      Que viva la Latino America Unida y Democratica!!!!|`|f113b2ecb1ccbface51a3d9962397bacaa	Quizs deba ser como dices, pero me quiero imaginar qu hara yo si regreso y veo viviendo a otros en mi propiedad. No revanchas, pero s justicia y la nica que se me ocurre es que haya devolucin o compensacin a toda propiedad que  demuestre due?o anterior a la era Castro. Por de pronto........pido perdn por opinar en algo tan delicado, cuando lo que yo s de Cuba es que me gusta el cuba-libre y poco ms.|`|21YEggJNaa	Lo primero que tiene que pasar es que  se termine el castrismo y  despus comensar una democracia que pueda hacerlos olvidar  pero como veo las cosas  todava falta un buen rato   paciencia companero|`|Uptt6YLqaa	Bueno sinceramente y sin el animo de ofender cuba tiene mejor estatus economico que algunos paises de latinoamerica....Lo digo porque e visitado la habana..ademas la gente que vive en cuba no se queja tanto de vivir alla..lo unicos que se ponen de bocones a hablar mal de cuba son los que se an ido de la isla.....ojo que no me an contado yo e estado alli y lo e visto,,los unicos que se quejan de esa forma de vivir sos los cobardes que an dejado la isla y lo digo con toda sinceridad sin el animo de molestar a nadie.......
