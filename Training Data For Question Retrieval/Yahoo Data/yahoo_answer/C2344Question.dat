Ok so I was at school today and i had written a science test so i was going to my locker to get my science textbook to work on my science homework. I remembered while at my locker that i needed to change my tampon but i only had a pad so i stuck it in my binder and headed back to class. Well this really really cute guidance counsillor at my school was walking down the stairs as i was walking up but i tripped on the stair i guess and kinda stumbled and my pad fell out of my binder! (Big red face) anyways,   he said "Hun you ok?" and i was like "um yeah yeah im fine" and went to walk away and he said "oops you dropped something" and i was thinking dropped what and then remembered my pad. and he picked it up and handed it to me. Well i got like super embarrassed so my eyes started to teary. and then he said "you sure your ok"? and i said yeah and kept walking. Well im so embarrassed i walked by him like 3 other times today and couldn't even look at him!   Omg what do I do??

Il 12 febbraio ho un esame di economia aziendale su un libro di 320 pagine. Si tratta di un esame a crocette in cui devo fare almeno 12 punti (1 domanda giusta vale 1 punto, sbagliata -1). Se lo passo vengo ammessa all'orale. Il voto che verrà registrato sul libretto è solo ed esclusivamente quello dell'orale.   Sono indecisa su cosa fare:      - Prepararmi "alla cavolo" e cioè leggendo e ripetendo tutto quanto giusto x passare all'orale;      oppure      - Studiare bene facendo i riassunti.      Nel caso scelga la prima ipotesi potrei anche passare lo scritto, ma dopo per prepararmi all'orale x un buon voto non ce la farei a fare i riassunti. Se scegliessi la seconda, non ce la farei ad essere pronta per il 12.      Potrei anche iscrivermi all'appello successivo, solo che il 26 febbraio iniziano le lezioni del secondo semestre e sicuramente l'esame mi si sovrapporrà a queste lezioni, più un esame di matematica.

20090227053208AAq1xR6	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Will my college record make up for my high school slacking?	I didn't do horribly in high school--I took a handful of AP/Honors classes, a smattering of extracurricular activities--and I graduated with a round 3.0. Not bad, but certainly not stellar.      However, I've been in college for close to two years, and I've made stellar grades here. I usually have a 3.8 GPA, made the Dean's List, never a C, only the occasional B... I'm doing very well, basically. And I write for the student newspaper and play active roles in the Gay-Straight Alliance and the Economics club. I entered college in August 2007, and I've built a very strong transcript since then.      Recently, I sent transfer applications to the College of William and Mary, American University, and UNC - Chapel Hill. I've been looking at those kind of colleges--a tier below Ivy League, basically. I know that my college transcript is good enough to get into one of them (W+M is my dream college and their "competitive" transfer GPA is 3.5) but here's my big question:      Will my college transcript redeem my high school mistakes or will my lame 10th and 11th grade report cards prevent me from getting into a place like William and Mary?
