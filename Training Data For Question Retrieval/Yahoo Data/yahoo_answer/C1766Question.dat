Or do they sit there in Parliament and have silly ideas based on miscontrued ideas of what our society is really like?

These people are idiots!

20090310031924AAXBhH2	News & Events;Current Events	What will we achieve by hanging Ajmal?	I'm talking about Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai Attacks.      So by hanging him can we stop terror? No! If you follow the news, you know how different terror outfits like Taliban,Lashkar,Jaish are all getting increasingly dangerous. They don't care if one of their foot soldiers is hanged. They have thousands others. These youths are made to blindly believe in "Jannat" post "Martyrdom" in "Jihad". So often they want to die more than live. Death is not a deterrent even for ordinary criminals, let alone Jihadis. Death penalty has been abolished in most countries.       By hanging Ajmal we can however avenge the losses of his victims. Let me tell you. Even Ajmal came to avenge the so-called "atrocities" on Muslims in certain parts of the world including India. You might be knowing he was shown such videos for brainwash. So the terrorists will avenge us. We will avenge the terrorists. Silsila jari rahegi. Result Nil! Why don't we strike at the roots instead? Like poverty, ignorance, fundamentalism, extremism? And we also need an improved security system to protect ourselves against foreign and homegrown disturbances.      About justice to Ajmal's victims, AJMAL HAS TO BE PUNISHED. But he can be given rigorous life imprisonment. The form of extreme punishment in most civilized nations. Hanging him won't bring back what his victims have lost. I say this with DUE SYMPATHY for the victims. Remember even ME AND MY FAMILY can become terror victims! So u can't say since I haven't suffered any personal loss I say all this. I may suffer such loss anytime. The world is unsafe today!      Many say giving life imprisonment to Ajmal may invite incident like the IA plane hijack in 1999 to releaze Masud Azhar. But remember Ajmal's situation is DIFFERENT. Ajmal doesn't occupy an important position in terror hierarchy like Azhar. Moreover ISI and LeT themselves want to kill Ajmal. So they don't care if Ajmal is releazed or not.       Some people have talked about Ajmal's rehabilitation. I don't wanna comment on whether there is any such scope. However it wouldn't be bad if that could be done. I say this for all criminals. If people can be turned bad, why can't the reverse be done? Nobody is a born criminal and anybody can turn into a criminal given the circumstances.       Regarding the Ajmal issue, we are becoming more emotional than patriotic I think. I know my post might invite some VERY STRONG COMMENTS AGAINST ME since this is a highly sensitive issue. The readers are free to or not to agree with me. But I'd like to request you to avoid using abusive words and express your free, mature opinions on my post.       Thank you.

Does this policeman have a right?      on march 9th, Javid Iqbal police officer, 'poor guy', says that the big bad mean "white" police officers made fun of him. Well shouldn't police officers be made of stronger stuff? Could it be that Javid Iqbal is merely trying to stir up resentment among Muslims toward the British authorities, once again deflect attention away from Islamic terrorist activity by portraying Muslims as victims, and divert attention away also from his miserable performance as a police officer?  Did Javid Iqbal really need to sue?      Source: was browsing, saw on Jihad Watch.
20090310040518AADufGj	News & Events;Current Events	Do you want the bankers who wrecked our economy let loose on our kids after half the required training?	 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/793...       Why oh why does the government still worship at the high alter of banks and the financial industry???      'Intelligent' money focused people muck up the economy by taking untold risks that they don't really understand. The government decides the taxpayer will bail the institutions out and will now find 'respectable' jobs in teaching in super quick time for the little dears that caused the mess. It is assumed because these people have a 'head for numbers' (which I'm not quite sure is the proven case) they will make great maths and science teachers in 6 months flat (half the current teacher training time).       Why do the government think they will know more about how to relate to children, psychology, lesson planning, the national curriculum, discipline - all the skills that good teachers need beyond the basic subject competence? Because they've worked in the city...well I suppose it was a rich kid's playground for much of the nineties and naughties...      I would most welcome views from those in the teaching profession and those in the financial industry.

Recently, a U.S. naval vessel was conducting "routine surveillance" (spying) in "international waters" (yeah, right!) near China. I highly doubt that's true since the article made no knowledge known about the exact location where this took place. The U.S. naval vessel was undoubtedly in Chinese waters. Read the story here-->  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090309/pl_n...       My question now leads to, why were they there?      I think it's to spy on China's underwater military base that is a possible UFO holding facility similar to that of Area 51. I got this idea because I saw some documentary that showed evidence of aliens entering the sea and the fact that little is known about the sea that an alien base in it is not that far fetched. Then I later read that China builds an underwater submarine base that was very costly in terms of money. Coincidence? I think not.      What do you think?

More military officers demand eligibility proof   Plaintiff: 'In the worst case … it's going to be revolution in the streets'   --------------------------------------...   Posted: March 02, 2009, 8:18 pm Eastern   By Bob Unruh | ? 2009 WorldNetDaily       Military officers from the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines are working with California attorney Orly Taitz and her Defend Our Freedoms Foundation, citing a legal right established in British common law nearly 800 years ago and recognized by the U.S. Founding Fathers to demand documentation that may prove – or disprove – Barack Obama's eligibility to be president.       Taitz told WND today she has mailed to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder a request that he "relate Quo Warranto on Barack Hussein Obama II to test his title to president before the Supreme Court."       The lengthy legal phrase essentially means an explanation is being demanded for what authority Obama is using to act as president. An online constitutional resource says Quo Warranto "affords the only judicial remedy for violations of the Constitution by public officials and agents."       Requesting the action are Maj. Gen. Carroll Childers; Lt. Col. Dr. David Earl-Graef; police officer and Selected Reservist Navy Commander Clinton Grimes; Lt. Scott Easterling, now serving on active duty in Iraq; New Hampshire state Rep. Timothy Comerford; Tennessee state Rep. Frank Nicely and others.      Some of the lawsuits question whether he was actually born in Hawaii, as he insists. If he was born out of the country, Obama's American mother, the suits contend, was too young at the time of his birth to confer American citizenship to her son under the law at the time.       Other challenges have focused on Obama's citizenship through his father, a Kenyan subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom at the time of his birth, thus making him a dual citizen. The cases contend the framers of the Constitution excluded dual citizens from qualifying as natural born.      Where's the proof Barack Obama was born in the U.S. or that he fulfills the "natural-born American" clause in the Constitution?

Is this just his lack of experience and naivete?  Does it show that after all he does agree with his pastor, the Rev. Wright who preached that America being attacked on 9/11 was our own fault?  Will it work?
20090309123255AAztaUF	News & Events;Current Events	Why doesnt Britain retaliate against the IRA like lsraeli style?	Israel now that's a country you call a proud country that despite what anyone says will do its job, make up its own mind no matter what in protecting its people from terror.      If an outrage like happened in Israel e.g them 2 poor soldiers dying like they did in Northern Ireland Israel would have turned the other guys home into a desert. Look at Lebanon and Gaza what they did to them!      So my question why didn't the British army retaliate by firing a few cruise missiles into County Armagh or other Catholics areas of Northern Ireland? and show them what happens when you dare mess with the greatest country on earth that invented Fish and Chips, Cricket, tea and crumpets, nice cool autumnal rains and the sliced bread?      Why dont Britain like Israel start taking out the Sinn Fein leadership e.g tit for tat like the Israelis have done so successfully against Hamas operatives, and nearly crippled Hamas ability to continue terror?      Why dont the Brits also attack the Republic of Ireland too and send a strong message to the Irish goverment and people in the south that we will no longer tolerate them supporting terror?       Why dont the RAF turn the clock 20 years back on Ireland and Dublin the same way the Israeli airforce did to Lebanon and made Hisbollah in the end Beg for a ceasefire?      Especially given the lesson that no amount of "talk" or agreement will suffice the terrorists given the fact Gerry Adams not condemning the attack on Sunday.

Does anyone agree with me that News Shows need to start focusing on all the good things that happen in this world rather then all the bad things?   I mean seriously when ever I turn on the news they're always talking about something bad, most recently the stock market going down and OctoMom. I mean come on lets talk about something more positive! I'm sick and tired of hearing all about the bad things in life I want to hear about the Good things!!      Does anyone Agree with me?
