20090205083934AAliP6n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My mother never breastfed her babies but she is giving me advice on how to breastfeed my 3 month old daughter?	My mother tells me often to stretch my daughter's feedings out. She says that my 3 month old daughter should go 4 hours between feedings. Some days it seems my daughter wants to nurse all day long. Sometimes she just nurses for comfort, and I was under the impression that this was okay.   My mother is telling me that I am doing it wrong and that I should only feed her every 4 hours. My mother is telling me that I am teaching her it is okay to nurse for comfort and that I shouldn't do that.   I do comfort my daughter in other ways, so I don't think I am "ruining her" (like my mother says)   My mother thinks my baby should associate nursing with strictly feeding, and nothing else, not comfort, just feeding.   Is she right?

20090205084340AA5XS8X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Anyone else think that people should not have kids?	I believe the earth is overpopulated.  Not only that, I believe people should PLAN before they have kids.  I believe only the wealthy should have kids to keep the kids happy and support them until they're 18.  Then, I believe the kid should get a job, and if there are money problems, they can just ask the parents for some money to help them out.  Unfortunately, it's the opposite - poorer countries are having more kids.

I am going to go back to studying once she starts school but I will still be there to take her to/pick her up from school etc.  I know a lot of people are of the opinion that it is not justifiable to be a stay at home mum once children are at school, and that they should go to work at this point.  I know personally, I could easily fill the days with errands and household/child related tasks and I only have one child at this point.  What do you think?  should mums still stay at home once their children are in school?

That's what they're like. But that moment when they put the baby on your chest – that's deep. It's a deep experience."       I agree with her on experiencing the moment your child is born (there's nothing else like it), but contractions are like bad cramps?  WTF?!?  Thanks for discrediting women everywhere, Jess.

I'm normally a 28 day cycle but from my period on Dec. 11 - Jan. 10th, that is a 30 day cycle right? Which means I must've ovulated on the 25th of Jan? Or am I wrong.. Today is the 5th of Feb. It's been 13 dpo, can I take a test yet? I seriously think I'm spotting, I'm wearing a pad and there are just spots of brown blood. When I wipe it's pink.. don't know any more. My symptoms include: lower back aches, very little cramping, twinges and sore by the ovaries, and entirely fatigued. Notice that I've been going to the restroom a lot too. No bloating, no feeling like I have to vomit or morning sickness. Any help would be great! Thanks.
20090205084722AA6cVx6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Some opinions about co-sleeping?	i know co-sleeping is a touchy subject, people seem to be either Absolutely against it or they are all for it. anyways down the street from my house a 1 month old baby was suffocated while co sleeping. the news paper is acting like the only issue is that the parents fell asleep. even in the same article, they report that meth was being made in that house, and that the dad was arrested on drug charges in a different place. now i am going to be honest, i haven't ever heard of anyone crushing or suffocating the baby that did not have Alcohol or drugs involved.we co-sleep , and i am constantly aware of where she is at all times. when she is in our bed its almost as if i am not really sleeping. we are transitioning her to her own bed, because she is getting close to sleeping through the night, but anyways what are your opinions on this? here is a link to the article if you want to read it. http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/artic...

My daughter is 3 months and after she was 2 weeks old, she could not sleep in our room at night, would not sleep in bed, nothing. I think because she is easily over stimulated. So basically do you co sleep because it's what your child wanted and how would you handle it if they didn't want anything to do with even being in the same room?

20090205090206AASQOiT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How independant is your toddler?	From the start, family and friends have told me in no uncertain terms that I am doing everything wrong and would end up with a very clingy child (extended breastfeeding, co-sleeping, never leaving to cry etc).  My daughter is now almost 17 months and completely the opposite - she is SO independent.  She will happily meet strangers, she will only look to see where I am every 10 minutes or so if seperated in a room/place, she feeds herself, is content to play alone or do things alongside me if I'm cleaning, she wants to wash herself and dress herself etc.  Then i see children of friends at a similar age who hate new places, are scared of new people, cling to their comforter/dummy and refuse to be away from their mums and it really hits home just how independent my little one is.  Of course, now family/friends have a new complaint and say she is too independent and not attached to me!!  But she is so affectionate, she just doesn't need mollycoddling!  How independent is your toddler?
20090205085953AA2CPZE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What do you think about kids not being able to have snacks at their school parties?	My daughter is in first grade and this is the second year in a row she has not been allowed to have any holiday parties with snacks, treats for birthdays, etc; due to a couple children in the classroom being allergic.This isnt every class or school rules just for the classes where children are allergic. I think this is wrong I do feel bad for the child who is allergic, but I also feel it is their parents responsibility to send in snacks their child can eat. When we were kids this was the best part of school when we had our holiday parties and our parents made all different kinds of decorated cupcakes, cookies, and rice Krispy treats. Its bad enough everything has to be packaged/store bought and now they cant have it at all. Maybe this sounds mean but am I really wrong. They think its unfair to that child , but I think more so when the other children know which child is the cause of this they will prob. be more mad, just because kids are evil like that. If your kid was the one who was allergic wouldnt you go out and buy them special snacks for snack time that they can eat? Thats another thing every other first grade class in the school has snack break, but not my daughter class they can only drink milk. AM REALLY NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN , but am I?

Because it didn't fully go in. It probably went in like HALF of an inch and was in there for about I don't know NOT EVEN a full 2 seconds. But, I've heard of pre ejaculation and he had kind of already earlier, but he cleaned himself, but YOU NEVER KNOW. That's what freaked me out. So, I took "Plan B" 34 I believe hours later. You have 48 hours. My period came 2 weeks later. Right on time. My full period. It was normal and everything. Then I took a pregnancy test 37 days after the "sex" day. It came out negative. But I've heard that many people have became pregnant even after their periods came. A friend of mine took a test it said negative and then she took 2 others & it said positive. But I think she took the first one too early. Anyways, I'm young. WAY too young to become pregnant. I belive in the lord VERY much, and I regret what I did everyday. TRUST me. If I could go back I would in a heartbeat. Well, I just am very freaked out still. I don't have any symptoms, but I'm just uhg I don't know. So, help? Give me some facts or something. Is it possible I am? Am I? UHG. :/ Help. Please & Thanks.         The date of "sex" = December 27   The date I took Plan B = December 29   The date my period came = January 17 (right on time)   The date I took a home pregnancy test = Febuary 1st

20090205093832AA60pHi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What was your first thought when they handed you your child?	A friend told me his thought was, "Oh my God, I forgive my Mom and Dad for everything." Also it was like from now on he was wearing his heart outside his body. I thought that was an odd thing to say- maybe I will understand when I have mine in a couple of weeks.       What went through your head?
20090205093452AAXHR48	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How much milk do you think is enough for a 31 month old toddler?	I am in constant argument with the nanny about how much milk to give my son. She gives him approximately 8-9oz in one sippie cup. I told her that is too much. He is to small for that amount. I mean that is about how much I would drink. That to me is considered an adult size serving. I usually give him about 4 ozs if he asks for milk. He likes to try to spill it everywhere as well if you don't watch him like hawk.      This is 1% milk by the way. This is just for drinking purposes. He eats regular meals at somewhat normal intervals.       What do you think?

He has cereal and fruit in the morning and cereal and veggies at night (2 ounces total per feeding).  From 10 pm - 7:30 am he is up 3-6 times to nurse (average is 4, lucky if its only 3!). At 7:30 he's up for the day. We were co-sleeping and he now sleeps in his crib. He usually falls asleep nursing so I put him back in the crib. On bad nights his dad will get up once and make a bottle but I cannot expect his dad to get up more than that, he does have a full time job.

My friend is still exclusively breastfeeding her 8 month old daughter (ie no bottles, no formula, but she's having solids), and the last two times I've seen her she's got really drunk. These have both been day time functions (the second was her daughter's christening), and she even made a joke about the fact that she's till breastfeeding, how hammered she was, and that her daughter actually liked it!      Obviously I don't know what her drinking habits are like on a day to day basis at home, but I'm worried about her daughter as she's not particularly alert, and seems to just fall asleep anytime, anywhere. I know all babies are different, but could the alcohol be affecting the baby?      Also, she drank throughout her pregnancy (eg only a week before she was due, she came to ours for dinner and had about 5 glasses of wine!).      What kind of affects can heavy/binge drinking have if you're breastfeeding? Will it make baby drunk? Can it cause any long-term damage? I'm just really worried about her baby girl, and also worried that my friend doesn't seem to see anything wrong in it.

My son just turned 5 months old today and I was wondering about his schedule. It doesn't seem as though we have made any progress in stretching out the time between feeds. I am exclusively breastfeeding and I feel like he wants to eat all the time. Could that mean that he should start solids? Here is my daily schedule:   5:30am - Wake for feed and right back to sleep.   7:30am - Wake and feed   8:00am - Play time   9:45am - Feed and put down for nap awake   11:00am - Wake up   11:45am- Feed    12:15pm - Play time   1:45pm - Feed and put down for nap awake   3:45pm - Wake up and feed   4:00pm - Play time   5:30pm - Walk around the neigborhood   6:00pm - Feed and possibly a short nap in the swing   6:30pm - Play time with dad   7:30pm - Bath to get relaxed   8:00pm - Feed and put in bed for the night awake      Suggestions are so welcomed. I started out when he was little trying to follow baby wise but I was unable to get him to sleep for more than 15 minutes with out feeding him first. My ped said that was ok as long as I was putting him in his crib awake so he could learn to fall asleep on his own.

Well, first of all, im now 2 and a half weeks late. i couldn't help myself and took a home pregnancy test on january 26, which came out negative. then a second one 5 days later, which had the same result. but im afraid i took both of these too early, or maybe my body is just not producing enough of the hormone?      i do have some symptoms, including:    1. headaches. which i can blame on the stress ive been under lately as well.    2. fatigue. i get tired during the day no matter how many hours of sleep i had the night before. even the simplest activities seem to wear me out.   3. nausea, but no vomiting.   4. constipation, sorry if that's TMI!   5. mood swings! this ones really annoying me now, even though i didn't notice it so much at first. my husband first pointed it out during a game of monopoly!      no weird cravings, no urinating more than usual, no swollen or tender breasts, i did have heartburn once, but that's just one time so i wont count that as a symptom. i haven't gained any noticeable weight. and one thing thats been bothering me is my upper ribs, right under my breasts, im not sure if its related. To be so early in my possible pregnancy i dont think my ribs would be sore yet, right?      im thinking maybe i just have a bug thats not making me feel so good and causing the symptoms, especially with 2 negative home pregnancy test results already, and maybe stress is causing my period to be late. but then maybe, just maybe, i might be pregnant. id appreciate anyones views on this matter. Thanks!

20090205095133AATjQ12	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it normal to question having a baby?	My boyfriend and I want to have kids. The problem is one week I will be positive that I want to have one now(start preparing) and like a week or two later I will start having doubts.       My doubts are usually because I am still in school. (jr. in college). I have always had a lot of my plate( in high school I went to high school for 8 hours to 6 hours(per week) of college classes after school and worked too) So its not that I don't think I will be prepare as far as mentally to do so many different things. And also after I graduate I plan on going to law school and then working at a law firm ...so at times I feel like it would be easier to do it know then later b/cuz law school is no joke and b/cuz it will be hard for me to get a good job when I maybe out for a 3 months or whatever to have my baby and most clients or jurors may not accept my judgments because they might assume it is hormonal ....And the other thing I deal with  is people being someone what disappointed in me for having a baby before I finish Law School and develop my Career. But I don't want to be old having kids I want to start no later than 22 and be done by 27...      My boyfriend is always constant in his answer...he wants to have the baby      Is it normal to have these back in fourth debates about getting preggo??

For as long as i could remember when i was supposed to get my period i would have the BIGGEST urge to pee and PFF there it was... but not now.. i have the urge to pee like ever hour and a half and every time I DONT get it. I had a doctors urine test on the 13th and that as negative and had bloodwork done but they didnt test for pregnancy because the doctor said that the urine test was good enough... If they tested for std's and highblood pressure and stuff like that it wouldnt show that i was pregnant right? Anyways... theres still a chance that im pregnant right?

This is baby #2 for me and although my first labour and delivery was a nightmare.  Im pumped and ready to do it again. I was scared for the longest time.  But Im SO uncomfortable and in pain as it is labour doesn't sound so bad.  Its pain for a purpose not pain for "no" reason.  Like my bits are so damn sore now and I haven't had the baby so I would rather be so from having him or her.  So anyone else ready not just to see their baby but to have him or her?  Having the baby is awesome I agree.  And Im not looking forward to labour to just end being uncomfortable.  Ive been like this through the whole pregnancy.  I guess Im weird but with all the issues that went wrong last time I want to experience a labour not full of problems.  Like most women get to have.
20090205112818AAes2jE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why does my child like to eat these kinds of things?	My son is 20-months-old, and I gave him an orange slice to eat.  The rind was still on.  I just cut the whole orange into four slices.  Anyhow, my son flips the orange over onto the skin and bites into the rind.  Yuck!  He continues to eat it like it's a potato chip or something.  By the time I came back in the room to check on him he had devoured the whole entire orange slice peel and all.  Also when I give him a chicken drumstick, he will turn it upside down, and suck on the bone, and eat a little, then suck on the bone on the top part, and never really eat the meat of the chicken.  For pizza, I will hand him a slice, and he will flip it over, crust facing his mouth, and eat the crust first, then eat the toppings and that is it.  Is this common for a toddler to eat the skin of oranges, he likes banana peels too, but I won't give him the banana with the peel on.  Why does my child like to eat these things?

The thing is, she vomited twice yesterday, then ok all today ate fine, I gave her plenty of water, and now she has just had dirrareah. Is this a vomiting bug even though she isn't vomiting all the time and still eating fine?   I bought hydration drinks but she isn't taking much of it. Anything else i can do?      Now, my question is:  How do you know if it's vomit vs spit up?  and I don't know about all of you, but until recently, and even now my daughter's poop is always like diarrhea.  Mushy and gross.  Sometimes she'll have solid poops, but most are still mushy.  So anyone know the difference?

I'm 14 weeks and 2 days today :)      This past week and especially past few days, I've been experiencing pulling and stretching whenever I get up, my doctor told me this is due to my uterus rising above my pelvic bone. Does this mean I'll be showing much more in the next few weeks?       Does the uterus rise only to the belly button during pregnancy or does it rise above the belly button?       In pregnancy do they cut weeks into five days or seven? One website calculator tells me I should be 15 weeks and 2 days. My calculations tell me I'm 14 weeks and 2 days.      How do they categorize trimesters? Some websites say you're in your second trimester at 14 weeks, others tell me 15.      This one is for fun...

20090205111544AALDy63	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why does he always get blasted about it?  I thought you were supposed to do what's best for your child?	I don't understand.  Maybe you guys can explain to me.  My fiance has a daughter.  He and her mother had her young and her mother passed away.  So he left his newborn with his parents.  He felt it would offer her stability and a sense of a normal home life.  He himself has been in the army since high school and felt that she would just stay with them while he was deployed anyway.      It's not as though he's thrown her away.  He makes sure she's safe, she's got what she needs, and she and his parents are taken care of.  He calls to check on her and goes over there as often as he can.      I've asked questions for him on here and a lot of people have insulted him for the way he takes care of her.  Most everyone offline tends to be supportive and understanding, save for a few.  And I don't see the problem myself.  He was nowhere near as bad as my father.  But can someone explain the problem to me?

SIDE NOTE:  I just want you all to know that the cheapie pregnancy tests off the internet do not always work!  I used one this morning with FMU with the FRER and the cheapie one didn't even have a hint of a line and it's suppose to be early result test.  The FRER was positive :)

Leiden Factor 5 is a blood clotting disorder that is genetical. Anyways, the doctors didn't tell me whether or not it was safe enough to breast feed my daughter, so I didn't. Does anyone have some insight? I'd like to breast feed our next child, but not if it may cause blood clots in my breasts.

20090205095913AAa4OK4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Hubby wants our newborn to sleep in the bedroom, I don't- what do you think?	Our baby girl will be born in a couple of weeks. My husband says he wants her to sleep right next to the bed in a bassinet for safety. I'm against this because my husband snores very loudly- and it stops and starts several times a night. Plus after his paternity leave (5 wks) he will start setting his alarm clock. It goes off at quarter to five (a.m.) with loud music, then he hits the snooze button six times over the course of an hour. Sometimes entire songs will play. (He's the soundest sleeper I've ever seen.) This even wakes me up, even after six years of "getting used" to it. I don't want a newborn baby being woken up that many times a night! She's going to need her sleep.       He originally wanted her to sleep in the bed with us but I put my foot down. First of all I don't think it's safe, we are both flippers in our sleep, and the smoke alarm won't even wake him (!). plus he is 250 lbs and I am really afraid he would accidentally crush her.       Anyway, I think the best thing for her is that she is in her crib in the nursery (right next to our room) and that we have a loud baby monitor. I even told him we could get a movement sensor if he was that worried. Do you think that's unreasonable?

Since my son learned to crawl, he was less interested in eatting and more interested in doing, so my milk supply is down to almost nothing. He hasn't been eating very much latetly and I've been worried, he has gotten smaller too. Well I gave him some of a free sample of Similac advance infant formula I got when I was pregnant in a sippy cup. When he was younger he would GAG on formula, now he is drinking it up. Has this happened to you? Should I just start giving him formula til he is 12 mo?

20090205110939AAO4YvA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should he or Shouldn't he?	My 18 year old niece was recently in the hospital for a couple of days to basically have a "non-functional" embryo removed from her right fallopian tube. It was about 9 weeks along and was basically stuck in the tube.       She loves her step-dad, my sisters new husband. I must admit of the two men I have in my life both my husband and my brother-in-law are tops in the male food chain.       He was so disappointed in her. Not that she was having sex and had gotten pregnant but that she didn't go to him, or my sister her mom, and ask for assistance in preventing pregnancy. They have always had an open, honest and loving relationship.       My borther-in-law has gotten her a counselor to deal with the postpartum depression over the loss of the infant and some other issues he thought she needs to resolve. He has done many things in the past couple of days except he is torn between a request my niece made of him.      My Niece told my borther-in-law she knew what she had done was wrong and deserved to be punished. She told him that she had a lot of pent up guilt as a result of this and asked him if he would spank her.       So the question is Should he or shouldn't he spank her.

I get the occasional attitude and we have our occasional fights, but we get along fairly well.      But I have friends with older teenagers--around 17--and they are telling me horror stories about their teenagers not talking to them anymore and treating them badly, fighting the rules, not being home, etc., etc... It sounds like constant warfare.      Is this what I have to look forward to? :(  Does this mean EVERY teenager has to go through that stage?

20090205094747AAPMICq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What is wrong with her?	Ok, one of my really good friends is trying to make herself lose weight. She's approx. 5ft 6in, and a UK Size 12. She's going to turn 13 in Spring.      She told me she's takes slimming pills for lunch instead of eating and then she said she was just joking and said it was for the rash on her cheek.      She doesn't have any appetite for foods with flavours (because it makes her sick) and can only eat custard       She eats less food then average at home (like breakfast and dinner sometimes lunch) but eats less at school.      She says she;s just like that because her auntie was losing weight before and now she's anorexic, so she's trying her method to lose weight but not be anorexic.      She watches me and my friends eat so she can develop control to not eat when she sees food on purpose.      I have tried telling her she's pretty and how dangerous it is. And that she should stop it and then she said she wasn't losing weight      She didn't eat lunch but after school she ate a small bag of gelatin sweets      What should I do to make her stop doing this that's really going to make her stop and what's wrong with her?

He has gone through a toddler talking program and I have received very little information. We have seen my family physician and all seem to be baffled. I hear alot of it could be this or this. He has excellent problem solving abilities , can communicate via gestures and sound excellently. He makes all sounds but seems to have some problems forcing out the consonants. BATMAN becomes ba ma. He spoke very well at nine months old was saying mama dada ni ni for night night hi bye and an assortment of others and they seemed to drop away until for 1 year he said nothing. Now they appear to be coming back but very slowly and not quite clear. There has been no physical trauma or abuse of any kind. He is a very happy loving interactive child and can pick through a wide range of dvds by sight no pictures on the dvds just the new silver ones with words. He knows which one is which and will grab a specific one when requested, although he has never watched tv in his life up till the past 3 mnths.  I have average communication abilities and his sister was talking in complete sentences at 13 mnths. If anyone has any insight or advice please help.???????????

(grandmother is mentally unstable and refuses to get help- she was threatening to come after her kids and grandkids and to kill people. we had to get a restraining order!) Now, this all happened about a year ago- my 5 year old went from seeing them about once a week to not at all. She has started telling people her grandparents are dead. I addressed this with her the other day explaining they were not dead, and the adults were just not getting along so that's why we can't see grandma and grandpa right now. Since having that conversation with her, she has been refusing to eat, she is awake to the wee hours of the night just staring at her ceiling in bed and she just wants to sleep during the day. She does not want to play with her friends at school on the playground. Monday I had to pick her up from school because she was throwing up... yesterday she threw up in the morning and again this morning... after eating breakfast. She is normally a happy spunky child- who never misses a meal.       Is this all a result of what has been going on between my husband/I and his parents?      What do I do? I'm really worried about my 5 year old!

My Daughter is only 9 (she will be 10 in July) and she has been having alot of changes over the past year. Last July I noticed she was growning armpit hair. And now she has started to break out her breats are also "budding" I think she is WAY TOO YOUNG to start but I thought i would ask just to make sure. Has anyone ever heard of a child that young starting? If not what else could be causing the hair???       Thanks

20090205101417AA4JKTv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What was your experience  medically and financially with Reproductive Endocrinologist?	Hi Ladies,      My OB/GYN referred me to an RE. I have PCOS and have taken Clomid 50 mg for two cycles.  I want to know roughly how much does this cost per procedure or per visit? What was your overall experience with your RE. I just don't know if I can afford to go to the RE all the time. I have heard some women on here who go to their RE's a couple of days throughout their cycle to check for follicles. I'm just worried that I will go broke having to go to a RE often. My husband says not to worry we will handle it. We have some money saved, so I guess that will help.      Guys, I guess I just need advice, encouragement, and you experiences.

We are trying for a baby so I guess I am going mad...Just about a week before my period I have started getting stomach pains, they are all over the stomach, mainly lower side. I get aches in legs as well when my stomach hurts. There is lot of gas formation. This is usually in the night and in the morning. I feel a like throwing up as well during this time.I read these could be the signs of implantation.  Can anybody help, I want to know whether I am pregnant or not. I checked my body temprature using a normal thermometer first thing in the morning, it came out to be 98.3 as opposed to my husband whose was 97.8. Usually it is the other way round. I can't wait for my periods...really anxious. My breasts are normal. I do have certain amount of gas formation normally as well.

20090205101509AAArSEA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Green discharge during pregnancy (28 weeks)?	I'm 28 weeks pregnant with my first baby.  Yesterday I noticed a snot colored discharge after I wiped - not a lot - just a small gob - it was like rubber, not slimy - no smell.  That happened twice.  Noticed a tiny bit today too.   I know green means infection and a couple of months ago, my fetal specialist gave me an Rx for Diflucan (1 pill) for a yeast infection under my breasts and inner thighs.  He also gave me a refill if I ever needed it.   I didn't have discharge then, only severe itching.   Does this sound like the same thing again.... the itching has return also.  No burning, etc.  Just itchy and occasional green snot.  I know Monostat-7 is safe, but 1 pill of Diflucan is so much easier.      (just went to OB on Monday - baby and fluid level is fine)      suggestions/opinions?

20090205095816AAfo0fg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Could this be a miscarriage? Or something else?	Ok, so here's my info. I'm a little worried.   I'm on Loestrin 24. I stopped taking it for about 3 weeks because they raised my prescription price and I couldn't afford it. In those 3 weeks I did have my cycle. It was normal. Lasted me about 3 days. Not heavy bleeding. The usual. Also in those 3 weeks, my fiance (we've been together for 5yrs and already have 2 children) and I did have intercourse a few times.   So, I was able to get my pill after those 3 weeks. So I started it on a sunday. My doctor said it was fine. I did consult her just to be safe. She said 3 weeks wasnt enough to worry. So to start it on the Sunday that was coming up. So I started it. Now, I was assuming to get my cycle within the first week or two of starting my pill. But, I didn't get it. So I thought, well, maybe I will get it towards the end of the pack. So in all of this, I found out that I had a very bad tooth infection. Was put on antibiotics. I was VERY sick so I wasn't having intercourse. But then out of no where I got my cycle. This was a week 1/2 ago. At first it was really light. Then after 3 days of that it got really really heavy. I passed this really big clot. it was dark red and then kind of light pink in some areas. I passed 3 of those. But had quite a bit of clotting. This bleeding lasted a week. I had lots of lower back pain. Nausea. But the pain was very tolerable. I didn't even have to take anything. So my bleeding stopped about 3 days ago. But, today, I'm having a lot of cramping again. Lower back pain. I'm not too sure whats going on. Has anyone experienced this? Know what could possibly be going on?   I already have an appt. So I am going to the doc but they cant see me until next week. I just need to set my mind at ease. I'm a ball of nerves.

Alright so Monday I had sex and today I'm ovulating..I'm just wondering I know sperm stick around for quite some time...however I know this may not effect anything but I went in the hot tub after ( I heard that it will kill the sperm) but being somewhat educated I know different seeing as my body was then protecting the sperm however I also picked up that being a hot tub after is like douching it pushes the sperm further. And I know that even if you are on top you can still get pregnant but I heard it chances less..So what would be the chances of something actually happening?

20090205105901AAYxyPI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 18 month old won't sleep in her bed anymore...?	My 18 month old daughter has been so good at sleeping in her bed all night, up until 2 weeks ago. For some reason she has made her mind up that she no longer wants to sleep there, and that she now sleeps in mommy and daddy's bed. Once about 3 weeks ago we allowed her to sleep in our bed becuase she had a lot of chest congestion and last winter she had pneaumonia; so it made me very nervous. I was only for one night, and then for almost a full week she went back to her crib and slept fine. Nothing about our lives has recently changed, so there hasn't been any major emotional stressors to cause this. The only thing that I can think is that she does appear to be going through a bit of a growth spurt. Anyhow over the last two weeks bascially at some point between 11:30pm and 5:30 am she has ended up in our bed, she will literally scream for over an hour. I don't know what to do anymore. We were thinking that she may have been "over" her crib. So we converted it to a toddler/day bed. Well this hasn't made the situation either better or worse. Two nights ago she actually fell right asleep in it and then didn't wake until almost 5:30 because she adn't eaten well the previous night and was hungry. And then after she ate she came back to bed with me; for a very early morning nap. She has also over the past few weeks ben wavering if she does/does not take a nap. Some days she'll take an 1hr30min nap. Others she doesn't sleep at all. I'm sure that is part of her growing/shifting biologically and will soon get straightened out. But this bed thing is killing me. I don't know what to do. I absolutely CAN NOT let her scream/cry for over an hour; I just can't. And I can't sit up all night either. Please any advice at ths point would be appreciated!
20090205110414AAApZF8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	When did/will your toddler go to a "big" bed, what age is too young?	Right now we are going through a hard time with our daughter sleeping properly in her bed. It was set as a crib, however since she basically decided to quit sleeping in it, we decided that since we have to retrain her somehow to sleep there; we might as well make it into a toddler/daybed (its a convertible kind). After that it can also go into a full sized bed. She loves to sleep/play on out king size, she uses an ottoman we have to get up there, and then scoots backwards off of it no prob. Now I am not ready to give her a full sized bed wuite yet, as I fear she may fall trying to get out of it in the AM or middle of the night. But It does have a head and foot board, and will be against 1 wall. So if we were to put a guard rail across most of the other side there would only be a small opening anyhow. What age did/will your toddler move to a "realy" bed? How soon is too soon? We have to go out anf buy the full mattress and box spring so I am not going to put out the $300 if she isn't going to use it. But would 21-24 months in general be too young for this?

20090205113007AAdIzkR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My little baby's first cold!! Help?	It has been 5 days now since my 5 month old girl was exposed to her cousin's upper respiratory infection. (They didnt know he was sick until the next day go figure!) I haven't noticed any out of the ordinary signs that she was sick and I thought we were in the clear! But this morning she started coughing a little. Her nose has been a little congested but never runny. Is it possible that the she caught the illness but her body is showing smaller signs of it? Her cousin (who is only 6 hours older than her) has been so sick and he has been throwing up when he coughs and his nose is terribly runny. I just figured that by 5 days, if she was going to get really sick, she would have be now.

20090205114255AAe53Ue	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Bad news for the husband and I :(?	So we just had our visit with the RE yesterday and my husband's sperm came back not so good.  His count and mobility were above average, but with very high abnormal shaped sperm. Only 3% were normal.  When he was a really little kid he had a hernia and a torsed testicle.  Because of these issues when he was developing it caused his sperm to be abnormal and there is nothing we can do to fix it since he's one of the most healthy people I know.  Making any sort of lifestyle changes won't make much of a differnece.  Our chances of conceiving naturally is 1-2% chance.  The only option we really have is IVF.  He was so upset about this because he knows how badly I want a family.  We are both very young still so I'm okay with doing IVF because I know it will be successful.  I'm 25 and he's 28.  I am healthy and everything is fine on my part.  The only thing that is alittle low is my progesterone, which is an easy fix.  If there is anyone who has had success with IVF or has been in my shoes, I would love to hear it.

My son is 7 1/2mo and has been eating one meal a day of spoon fed veggies or fruit mixed with cereal-so it's real thick. He is a really good eater, and I feel he's ready to move on. I am just scared to death of starting him on finger foods. I could cut up bananas for him, but is he going to chew anything or just swallow? I am worried about bits of toast or cheerios, they just seem too dry. Maybe pasta would be better? Smooshed peas? Help!
20090205115347AAU9pGi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	First time mothers and experienced mothers What was something you did that wasn't right with your first child?	I am a first time mother and realizing some mistakes I have made with my own child.  One is I feel guilty when he chooses not to eat his vegetables.  He never eats them and I know other parents have found ways to hide them and still give them to their toddlers.  I wish I could say the same but my son is a picky eater and would detect this. I have also failed because he is still on the bottle at 20-months, I wish I had've started weaning him earlier than maybe he would've had a better appetite.  I wish I would cook him more homecooked meals and less processed.  But I'm not a good cook, and most of the time he won't eat my food.  I have some health problems like thyroid which makes it harder, even with medicine to have the energy to cook home-cooked meals.  I go to school, work full-time, single mother and only have one day off.  I am not rich, so a lot of times I can't afford to get fresh veggies at the store only canned and sometimes frozen.  Also, my son watches a lot of TV, which may explain why he doesn't talk at his age.  I know I sound horrible, but this is my first time around parenting by myself.  It seems like the toddler years are the hardest.  What mistakes did you make with your first child or that you are making now as a first time parent that you regret or wish you could change?

She sleeps in pajamas, in one of those baby sleeping bags, with blankets over the top. I always tuck her in up to her neck, but her little hands are always finding their way out from underneath! Her room is quite cold even with the heating on and I'm not sure how to keep her hands warm.      It might sound silly to some, but it's not just that they're a little bit chilly, they feel like blocks of ice! I know you can grows for littler babies that have the fold over hand flap things, but I haven't seen any for older babies (she's 6 months) Any ideas??

20090219112539AAoCtaI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 3 days past my due-date...I had a feeling I'd be overdue & I was ok with it but now I'm starting to worry?	my first baby   and I know that the majority of first timers usually go 41 weeks instead of 40   so I wasn't worried      I had everything ready at 34 weeks, just in case   car seat installed, nursery finished, hospital bag packed, etc...   but I figured I'd be somewhere between a week and two weeks overdue anyway   so I spent my last month of the pregnancy scrapbooking and sewing...   things that would calm me yet keep me busy during the wait period   (seems like my whole pregnancy has been "hurry up and wait")      I took several classes while pregnant-   a prenatal health class, a birthing class, a breastfeeding class, an infant parenting class   well last night was the "reunion" of my prenatal health class   we were all supposed to come back with our babies and have a big pot luck dinner   out of 20 women in the class, only 2 of us hadn't yet given birth   the other woman isn't due for another 2 days, but I was due earlier this week   the other 18 women in our class not only all gave birth already   but 17 of them gave birth earlier than 40 weeks!      we were all first time moms   and all the classes, all the books, all the doctors all told me it was normal for a first time mom to carry 41 weeks   but being in that room   with 17 women who had all given birth anywhere from 1 week to 4 weeks early...   it just freaked me out      and of course they were all asking me when I was getting induced   I haven't even talked to my doctor about inducing yet   I told my doctor that I wanted this to happen naturally   and that as long as the baby is healthy I won't discuss induction before 41 weeks   now...I figured that if I don't give birth by 41 weeks,   we'll schedule an induction at 42 weeks (because we want the baby out before 43, of course)      I don't know what to do   twice in the past week I've felt like I was going into labor   I had strong contractions that were about 15 minutes apart for 9 hours one night   but nothing happened   and its starting to make me worry...I really really really don't want to be induced      I already walk 4 miles a day   (which is a step down from the 10 miles a day I walked in my first trimester)   my husband and I have sex at least 5-6 times a week....   besides walking and sex, I'm not sure what is safe to help encourage labor   it feels like I've researched everything except for natural induction methods...   I really didn't think being overdue would make me so worried      I don't think I would be this worried   except for the two times I thought I was in labor and I wasn't kinda freaked me out   and seeing all those other first time moms who gave birth early was so unexpected...      any advice greatly appreciated   if you have none to offer, thanks anyway, it helps to have vented my concerns

20090203035202AAmUScI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Names Needed, Desperate For Help.... Easy 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!… PLEASE HELP?	I know this is baby names but I thought that people might be able to help with names more here than in books and stuff.      Ok I'm writing a story for an AS English piece and I'm having some trouble with my character names.      Here's the people I need with their temporary names:::      Josh & Matt (really don't like matt, josh i'm undecided) - 17?or18?      Josh - Main Guy, Story in his POV. Him and Matt (IT, identical twins). Falls in love with main girl. Brave, caring, 'cool guy' at school, everyone likes him (and his brother)      Matt - Not so important but still in it alot. Alot like Josh (but doesnt love girl) Kind of class clown, always got something funny to say.      Cloei - 17?      Cloei - Main girl, vampire?(or some form, i thought vampire as she's a sort of princess/queen) Falls in love with josh. English but lived in Romania, France and England, just moved to America? Lonely but very popular at school. Very pretty gothic/casual style. Smoker (as are boys but not really essential just thought i'd chuck it in lol) Rules/looks after some form of kingdom in USA (maryland or DC which seems better?) Sweet but aggresive when needs be, very mysterious/secretive (for obv reasons)      Pierre - 20      Pierre - Cloeis brother, rules/looks after kingdom in france. Very protective of cloei, embraces being a vampire, not to keen on anyone non vamp. Scary but sexy, always up for a good fight. Very Sarcastic.      Jason - 22      Jason - Cloeis oldest brother. Not to keen on non vamps but tolerant of them (unlike pierre) always looking for ways to avoid fights but won't hesitate to defend himself or his family. Rules/looks after kingdom in England. Very mature.      Mitch - Vampire, the bad guy, wants cloei's kingdom (its the center of the whole of their vampire community, mitch is from the outcast community, not sure why they are outcast yet lol)      All names are up for discussion please help.      Shmo   (yes cloei is named after me, not for any reason other than i couldn't think of a name)      p.s.   Just so people know its not a publish project its a piece for class and i know everyone is all 'rah rah rah tiwilight excite no can't dupe twilight rah rah rah' but to be honest there are so many better vampire stories out there eg, dracula, the original vampire story, and the vampire shrink by lynda hilburn.      my story is nothing to do with twilight and more to do with 'josh' as a person and 'cloei' as a person than the whole vampire thing

20090219112527AAd09b2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My fiance and i fight all the time over childish things...?	my fiance and i have known each other over 2 years. This is just 1 of many examples i could give u, but last summer i purchased a boat.      my fiance, greg, wanted the title to have his name on it along w/ mine but i said no. i kept it in my name only.    Now, this year he wants to add a buncha new things like a new radio and a new swim platform, ect.   He also is getting a bunch of new and very much needed safety features added to the boat, but they cost alot of money.   I'm trying to save $ in a savings account but greg wants us to both spend our tax returns to get as much as possible in order for the boat to be ready this summer. I am willing to put the boat in storage this summer until i can get a job and our 5 month old can get a lil older but greg is not. he says if we can't take it out this summer, he's going to take out all the engine parts he bought & put in and strip the paint he painted on and sell the parts and accessories on ebay he also says "if i'm gonna be like that" then he refuses to haul the boat, work on it, ect. ever again. i explained to him that were just putting it in storage for 1 season until we both get a better job and can save some ect. but he says we can afford it now and i don't have a job so i needen't worry about what things cost and do as i'm told to do.       This is 1 of many things we argue about almost daily. When i mentioned i wanted to get a job before we did anything big like that he said you don't even have your license to drive to a job and your too stupid to learn how to drive any way or to get a good job thats not fast food.       later he always makes up w/ me but doesn't apologize. he says things like "i'm not trying to be an ****** but this is how i feel." and he talks nicer about the subject and we reach a peaceful agreement.      is any1 else going through this or something like this and how do you deal w. it? i normally just listen to him and whatever he says in the end b/c if not he gets loud and screams at me and it scares our baby. so what should i do?

I know some woman "nest" or act differently shortly before going into labor, but how did your pets act? Did they behave differently or act stranger than normal?       The day before I went into labor with my second baby both my Pug dogs got very nervous and jittery. Normally they sleep 90 percent of the time (they are lazy and older) but for some reason shortly before my labor started they wouldn't leave me alone. My one dog even came over and licked my belly and insisted on using it as a pillow while she kept staring at me with those big pug eyes. lol      I was nesting at the time my dogs acted differently so I always wondered if they were just feeding off my energy or maybe somehow they just "knew" I was going to go into labor.

20090203032426AAXHCbI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Having too many  Kids! Need Help?	I understand the fundamentals of having to many kids and the pro's and con's about them. Some may argue though their religious beliefs allows them to have as many kids possible some people oppose the opposite and think that their insane.   We have many senario's in which the problem to bare children come as a problem.      One may be people having kids they can't afford and use government help that come out of tax payer's money. 2nd people who have kids and take care of them but don't treat them well. 3rd people who have kids but limited themselves to how many kids they want, because they find raising kids is hard,and last but not least 4 people who have more than 5 kids and keep having kids. they are taking care of them not living on any assistance and treat them very well. Then we have irresponsible parents who have kids and their kids wind up in foster homes.      My question is this, why do America, society bash couples who have more than 5 or 10 kids who take care of them and don't recieve any assistance as a bad thing. I fell that just because certain women feel as though 1 or 4 ids may be enough for them, that it should be enough for others. Of course kids are hard to raise and take care of but it is also a good thing to bare a gift that others can't. We have plenty of women who pay fertility clinics to have kids who can't have none on there on. For some reason people is beginning to think that after a certain of number of kids a cap should be put on.I do not think people should keep having kids that they cannot care for or take care of. I do think people need to stop bashing moms who have more than 5 or 10 kids and say that they are insane. Some religious do not believe in birth control and others think it is wrong to limited your womanly body to not bare children anymore all because of their selfish reasons.    not everyone wants to adopt other people kids, being pregnant and being able to witness a life you brought into this world that you carried for 9 months, is worth more than money and any aspect of your life. My and my husband planned on having as many kids as possible hopefully 20 or so. My grandmother had 15 and my mother had 10. no assitance but love.      Stop bashing moms who have plenty of kids. Just because you don't find yourself financially stable enough to care for many kids, doesn't mean other women have to stop who have the mean. Just because you find yourself not strong enough for plenty of kids, doesn't mean the strong ones have to stop. You do not have to be a doctor or lawyer or rich to raise a big household.

20090205114256AApL1ht	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there a chance that a child with Spina Bifida can have a happy life?	Just recently, I became 18 weeks pregnant and my doctor told me that my child could possibly have spina bifida. I know that in most cases you can only abort a child up to the 3rd month... unless it has something like spina bifida or downs syndrome, and then you can abort it later on as well. I honestly don't know what I would or will do if it does have spina bifida, but it seems that I may want to abort it in fear of my child not being able to have a happy normal life.      I guess what I'm asking for is some opinions.... what you would do if your child had spina bifida ... or if you have any personal stories of someone you know. I do know that SOME kids with Spina Bifida can get operations to fix it, but only some. So please... I'm a young and scared possible to-be mother and I don't have anyone to turn to.

20090203034852AAjwLmz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think about "Baby Grace"?	Baby Grace is the 2 year old little girl found in Texas that was torchured and killed by her parents and then her body was dumped in Galveston Bay.    "The girl was beaten with leather belts, had her head held underwater in a bathtub and then was thrown across a room, her head slamming into a tile floor, the mother said in the document. She said they kept the body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in a plastic bin and dumped it into Galveston Bay."    Like how can someone do that to their own child?  I started crying when I read that.  I mean I know us parents get frustrated, but what the hell?  That poor little girl never even had a chance to live.  How can someone be that cruel and not love their own child?  Especially someone that young and innocent?

Only problem, I don't have a family doctor where I am living. I just moved here two months ago to live with my fiance. He and I should be getting our own place within the next month (hopefully). I know I should probably go to the clinic for the test but would they refer me to a doctor so that I could get all of the prenatal care I could and such? I'm not really sure where to go from here.

20090219111707AANJkuv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Third trimester diarrhea?	Im 32 weeks pregnant and I've had diarrhea for over 2 weeks now. I have been to the doctor, she told me to take Imodium AD and drink Gatorade. Which was what I had already been doing. I talked to another OB over the phone and he told me the same thing after I told him the whole story. I went to the ER at the hospital Friday because i had went to the bathroom at least 10 times and each time it was like brown water. I also had cramps and shooting pains in my pelvic bone. They sent me to Labor and Delivery. They monitored the baby for 3 hours (NST) and checked my cervix (closed). Finally yesterday the doctor called me in a RX for a drug called Lomotil. They seem to think its normal for a pregnant girl to have uncontrollable diarrhea for 2 weeks. I just don't think that this is normal. I had also lost 3 lbs in 2 weeks at my last OB appointment last Wednesday (feb 11). I know the weight loss was because of the diarrhea. I am not dehydrated, they checked my urine at the hospital and at the doctor. I drink a lot of water and Gatorade and I always check my urine to make sure its not bright yellow, which could mean that I am dehydrated. What do you all think, is it normal for me to have such severe diarrhea? I have been not been eating food that can irritate my stomach. Ive been mostly sticking to toast and crackers and chicken for dinner.

I just got a call from my Dr. and my glucose levels were elevated for my first Glucose test and I will have to go get the 3 hour Glucose Tolerance Test done. I realize that many women fail the first test, and pass the 2nd test, and there is a chance that I may not be diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes.       However, I AM a little concerned. I have been quite fatigued lately, almost as bad as I was in the first Trimester. I also have been throwing up 2 or 3 times a day, and I have been seeing "floaters" often. I had very bad morning sickness from week 5 to weeks 16, where I was vomiting 10 to 20 times a day and ended up receiving prescription medication. I had just assumed that it was normal to feel fatigued in the 3rd Trimester, and I figured that the vomiting was not a big deal because it is nowhere near as bad as it was in the first trimester. The floaters I was a bit concerned about, as I know that they can be a symptom of Pre-Eclampsia, but I haven't had any extreme swelling, etc.       Does anyone know if vomiting, fatigue, or floaters are common symptoms of Gestational Diabetes? If you have/had GD, did you have these as symptoms?       And also, how did being diagnosed with GD effect the last part of your pregnancy? More Dr's appointments, diet, early labor, etc????      Thanks so much for any help.

He refused and cried on and off ALL NIGHT refusing to go to sleep.  Also, same thing in the day.  He would literally go all day without sleeping even as a newborn, if we put him in the bassinet.  So, we decided to let him sleep with me in the bed so that #1 He could finally get some sleep and #2 I could finally get some sleep.  Well, even as a sleeper in the family bed, he still is very restless, wakes up and stirs frequently through the night.  The only thing that puts him back to sleep is the boob.  Sometimes, I can rock him to sleep but it doesn't always work.  I AM EXHAUSTED.  I have now gone 8 months with no more than an hour of sleep at a time.  Sigh.  With no hope of him changing around the corner, we are wondering what to do?  He eats solids 3 X a day, takes 2 regular naps a day (in our bed) of 30 minutes and the next one about 2 hours, goes to bed at 7 and wakes up around 5:30 AM....with of couse, the many wake ups through the night.  It is like he WANTS to go back to sleep but cannot self soothe himself back to sleep with my boob.   Due to stern advice from family and friends to let him "cry it out" we have tried that several times, but no improvement.  He cries for HOURS, finally falls asleep and then STILL wakes up again an hour later and we have to go through the whole process again.  I asked this question last month and a lot of people said that I should let him cry it out.  But, all night?  He literally will cry all night!  I do not think that is healthy both physically and mentally for an 8 month old to cry all night like that.  So, the question I ask is, "HELP!"  What do I do?"  Any suggestions are helpful....I just won't do the cry it out thing for HOURS but if you know of any ways to do a more modified approach, please let me know.  Thanks!
20090219113042AAozfaG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does the picture from a vaginal ultrasound...?	I was wondering if the picture from a vaginal ultrasound look the same as the abdominal ones? I'm going to get my 12 week ultrasound on May 5 and my doctor informed me today that it will be a vaginal ultrasound. I just want to know if the pictures I get from it will look the same as the abdominal kind... like will I get a profile view and what not? I've known alot of pregnant women before and NONE of them ever had to get a vaginal ultrasound so I don't really know what to expect from it. Please share your experiences with a vaginal ultrasound so I can be better prepared!

20090219114111AAoj9t2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Delivery Room Drama....?	I'm 38 weeks pregnant and originally it was just suppose to be my boyfriend and me in the delivery room and recently I've decided I really want my mother to be in the delivery room with me when I have my baby; she's done it before and I really want her there to help coach/support me.       When I told my boyfriend he flipped out and was extremely upset and said he didn't want her there. He told me I needed to choose between him and her and I told him it's a nonnegotiable issue and I'm not choosing, I want him and her both there, but if HE choose not to be there that is HIS choice; he hung up on me and haven't talked to him in a few days.      Am I in the wrong? Or is he?      We are bringing a new life into the world and it should be a positive experience and he just turning it around, creating unneeded drama and making it about him(which he always does)...  It should be about the baby, and making giving birth more comfortable for me.      What do you think?

20090219121226AAaWy9Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Baby Lexis is here =D?	My baby was born Monday at 1:26 AM after 26 hours of full labor, but it was about 7 of active labor in the hospital. They put the gel on my cervix to kickstart it to dilate so I could get induced on Monday morning and it had an unusual reaction. I went from bearly one cm to 2 1/2 in 35 minutes (the contraction felt like just one big one with no break at all. It took 3 hours to go from 2 1/2 to 4 (when you can get in the labor tub and/or get an intrathecal epidural) Once I hit 4 I ordered my intrathecal and in the 20 minute wait for my doc and the anesthesiologist to get there my water broke itself. 10 mins of paper work then I got it. About 5 minutes after when it kicked in they checked me and I was ready to push. It took 6 pushes and she was out!      She was 6 lbs 12.4 oz and is 22 1/4 inches long. Full head of hair and is absolutely gorgeous. Good luck to all you women waiting!!!      Tips to you pregnant women: Nothing I tried (which was everything except castor oil, black/blue cohosh.) Walking, I do believe, helped make the active labor go fast. I walked 2 hours a day for the last 2 weeks and I walked the entire time I was in labor because the pain made it impossible to lay down. I swayed and danced my hips over the bed and sink. I also kept squatting on the toilet and sitting up as straight as I could and leaning towards the handle. The breathing helps. Breathe through every contraction the whole time. It helps you focus and pull through each contraction one at a time.
20090219122440AApXEfL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I Pregnant Again....?	I have a daughter who is 3 and half month, she's turning 4 in 5 days. I've been strictly breastfeeding since the day she was born. I had intercourse with my partner at least once a month.. My last period was on the 1st Of January.. and I haven't gotten it yet. I've been feeling real nauseated, hungry, head ace and back pain. I thought there were 98% chance of me getting pregnant while breastfeeding?? Do you think I'm pregnant??
20090219121540AAttLyf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 33 weeks pregnant and I have bad cramps?	Not trying to gross anyone out, but this past Sunday I had to go to the ER because I had an allergic reaction and broke out in hives. The doc gave me benedryl and zantac through an IV and then prescribed zyrtec and zantac pills to take for 10 days. Since then I've have diarrhea for the past 4 days and today it's gotten worse. I have to go once every hour now since I got up and nothing much comes out, but the cramps are so bad.       I called my MD and left a message with the front desk so that she can call me back, but its been 2 hours and I'm curious if I should be worried. I know Zantac can cause diarrhea, but its been 4 days and I'm getting progressively worse. Could I be in labor?

20090219122124AAYfgXy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are these signs of early labor or me just hoping they are?	I am 39 weeks and 2 days... I am 2cm dilated and having irregular contractions... They're not too painful, just super uncomfortable and coming anywhere from every 10-20 minutes, sometimes more frequent... I've had menstrual like cramps for about 1 week and lower back pains for the past few days... I did have some pink/brown mucous (sorry for the TMI) but it was after a pelvic exam, so I know that's probably nothing... Is this early labor, or just normal pains for being this far along?? I'm so anxious and I keep hoping every little tinge of pain is a sign of labor! :)

20090219115229AA0BLXG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like possible pregnancy or something else (playing the waiting game sucks by the way)?	I am playing a waiting game and going nuts in the process. Since I have never had a baby before, I am not sure what is going on and need some oppinions/advice.   I am 10-11 days late for my period which is usually right on schedule, and when it is late it is no more than 2 days late. been having on and off nausea, headaches, lower back aches, cramp like feelings (more like tugging than cramping), more trips to the bathroom, moodiness, increased vaginal fluid (sorry TMI), pressure in my lower stomach that is not gas although I have been a bit gassy lately (sorry again), somewhat forgetful and clumsier, and no signs period is coming although I have had a couple days I thought it was going to come but never showed. I have been having all of this for about 2+ weeks now. I have taken HPT but they came back negative. I took the first 2 (dollar store brand) the day after I missed my period and the following morning and the other one I took this past Monday when I was about a week late but I took it at like 12 in the afternoon.So, my questions are:   1. Do you think this sounds like I'm pregnant and if so   2. When do you think I should test again?      Just to add a few notes:   I have not been under any stress and nothing has changed diet wise, sleep wise, etc. And my Fiance and I have not been actively trying to conceive, we figure what happens happens and if we have a baby then they will be well loved and cared for and if not then that is more time for us to prepare for when we DO decide to actively start trying.

20090219115458AA2e9mk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Advice for cloth diapers?	I want to use cloth diapers and need some assistance.  First, I will only use them when we are home.  So when he is in day care, they will only use disposables and on occasion when we are out and about, I would have disposables.  So, I would anticipate using cloth diapers after work, during the night and weekends.  I need advice as to how many I need, diapers and liners.  I also want advice as to the "all in ones" or the ones that have sizes.  For example, Bum Genius has one that goes from newborn to toddler, and Fuzzi Bunz has sizes.  Second on the actual use of them, do you change the diaper and the liners when they are soiled?  Third, if you can give me any more practical advice on cloth diapers (best to use, cleaning, etc), it would be greatly appreciated.  I feel awful for all the disposables that I am depositing into the landfills and want to help all I can, even if it is only a few diapers a week.  Thanks!!!

I checked it at the pharmacy. I thought it might be high and I thought I had the flu yesterday but I think what I was feeling was more from sinuses.
