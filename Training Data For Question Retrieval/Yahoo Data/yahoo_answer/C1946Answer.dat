C7rV71Cjaa	No you can't there is no way to do that.|`|kgTPnjhkaa	shure you can i really would'nt recomend it though its really hard.....|`|EpvHhbByaa	You actually can't play Gutar Hero World tour with the wii remote. When the wii remote is plugged in, the game assumes you want to do vocals. But you can't do that unless there's a mic plugged into the wii.|`|sY5cptAvaa	I know you can play guitar hero 3 with just a wii remote, I guess you can on world tour too, but its quite difficult to play without the guitar.|`|Hip706GEaa	u sure can. although its much harder!
MOimIcdVaa	That is jest when your limewire is on is you turn it off it will go away and its not you actual ITunes library you have to go to add song or add file to library depend witch itunes you have the go to shared files|`|RtIbnlcpaa	isnt that good that limewire put the songs in your itunes library???
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	California is one of the worst states to go to to buy anything.  The state's tax rate is 8.25.  I think only New York has a higher tax.  <br>  <br>  There 60 gb has been discontinued for well over 2 years now.  <br>  <br>  The 40 gb has been upgraded to the 80 gb.  It's 400 bucks.  With tax, it's about 433 bucks.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	Sorry to say that the 60GB PS3's are out of production since summer 2008. Although there are some people who are willing to sell theirs for about $600+. The only PS3's that are available in California are the 80GB and 160GB Uncharted Bundle. The 80GB will cost you about $450, and the 160GB bundle will cost about $550, both including tax. Remember, if you plan to purchase from California, there is an 8.25% tax charge.|`|dUyBF4yOaa	hiya! i live in california, and hope you enjoy your trip there. Anyways, they do not sell 60gb or the 40gb ps3 anymore. They were discontinued. The 60gb was discontinued in late 2007! They were taken out because people like xbox fanboys were whining about how much they costed. ($600 usd) so sony decided to take out backwards compatibility. The 40gb did not contain backwards compatibility, and in my eyes is the most plain version of the ps3. It contained a 40gb hdd. 2 usb ports, no media reports and no backwards compatibility.! <br>  <br>  the 40gb was then replaced with the 80gb. Its the same thing as the 40gb except it comes with 40 more gb and an upgraded dualshock 3 controller.<br>  <br>  Now you can buy the 80gb version of the ps3 (no bc) for 500 usd and the 160gb ps3 which is the same thing as the 80gb except more memory and it comes with uncharted (one hell of a game!) for 500. Uncharted is a 60 dollar game so if you want to dish out the extra 40 dollars for double the hdd space go for the 160gb bundle. and of course tax in out state is 8.75%<br>  <br>  if you have anymore questions be sure to email or IM me at:<br>  redlightning7@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED and enjoy your trip over here =]
EfejPjIMaa	You can not change the button layout on controls except for when a specific game allows you to.  <br>  <br>  You have a bad converter.  You can do one of two things:  1. Take the wires apart are rewire the converter.  2. Return the converter and get another one. <br>  <br>  Those are your two options.  Of course, you could also buy a PS3 controller.|`|RWVQS0ZRaa	the ps3 wasent designed to use ps2 controllers (even though ps3 to ps2 converters were made and sold) the ps3 needs more buttons than some ps2 controllers can allow which is why a ps3 contro;;er is essential (some games require sixaxis which is another control of the ps3 controller)<br>  <br>  best advice is - buy a ps3 compatible controller (upto ￡34.99 Dualshock 3)|`|aL0dgQgKaa	you cant change it it has blue ray <br>  ps2 has re ray or something like that
IoKjLtN9aa	No it will not charge you for finding artwork. If all of your music is tagged properly then it will find 99% of the album artwork. iTunes will always notify you before it makes a purchase. So you can click away with confidence.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the apple family!|`|YdMmERk1aa	No. iTunes does not charge extra for album art.  When you buy music, you will automatically get the album art. If you have songs that dont have album art, you can just drag their album art from like google images.|`|MOimIcdVaa	If it doesn't...go on the internet search the album in images copy the picture (the full size one) and go to the song right click hit more info and click the album artwork tab and paste it|`|4dXSD60Zaa	you dont have to pay for it.|`|RtIbnlcpaa	if you buy a song from itunes the artwork is free.<br>  but if you have CD ripped music, itunes will get the artwork that it can find at no charge.<br>  <br>  hope this helped ;-)<br>  <br>  btw please add me if you want a good answerer.
IoKjLtN9aa	You must hold down the sleep button. Are you holding it down? I'll be back to read your updated question.|`|RtIbnlcpaa	hold down the power for like 5 seconds<br>  then slide for it to be completely off<br>  then hold it again to turn it back on.<br>  <br>  Please add me people....|`|8d68b9a0d30f2b2999111a2249eb8541aa	Hold it down. It will come up. If not, you may have a faulty ipod. But that is not very likely.|`|9VXIfyjvaa	Hold down the button in the top left corner until it comes up and says: <br>  Slide to Power Off<br>  Slide it and it should turn all the way off. If not, take it to the Apple store to be examined and if it has a defect they should give you a new one. But that is officially how. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck!<br>  =D|`|4518209454611c009896abb518972d8daa	Hmm...I don't know what to tell ya.  It seems like your doing the right thing by holding down the button on the top left for 5 seconds, and sliding it off.|`|YdMmERk1aa	You have to press and hold the top button for five seconds first. ;-)
bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	reset your ipod unplug it and press menu and the center buttons at the same time until the apple appears|`|YdMmERk1aa	Hold the top and home button for ten seconds then release the top button. Keep holding the home button for ten more seconds. Then it will always connect to iTunes. Then just restore it.|`|4dXSD60Zaa	go to apple.com and choose ipod + itunes. look up troubleshooting. hope you find something.
Sm6IBKYjaa	What is better.. Unlocked phone if it is working great would be better. But you spend your time on searching for an unlocked phone when you can buy a locked phone and unlock it using  the jailbreak software. <br>  Jali break software is a software that is used to unlock the Iphone. While you go for a jail breaking version just look for three features. Whether the version offers continuing support? whether it is in tune with Iphone? what is the price. <br>  I have used <a href="http://www.easyiphoneunlocking.com/index3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.easyiphoneunlocking.com/index...</a> to unlock my phone. I have tried this version to unlock over 30 pf my customer phones and I must say I have positive feedback from all of them|`|4cMuedpWaa	First of all, it's not clear of which iPhone you're talking about.<br>  <br>  Is it the iPhone 1st Gen. or the iPhone 3G ?<br>  <br>  If it's the iPhone 1st Gen. then you can unlock it (and jailbreak it if you want to) and use it with T-Mobile's GSM/GPRS/EDGE network.<br>  <br>  To unlock and/or jailbreak your iPhone, go here and find the info you need:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.iphone-dev.org/</a><br>  <br>  and here for a step-by-step instructions:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2009/02/stepbystep-guide-to-jailbreak-iphone-3g-and-preserving-baseband-using-pwnagetool.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iphonehacks.com/2009/02/stepb...</a><br>  <br>  Now, if it's an iPhone 3G, while you definitely can use an iPhone 3G using the quad-band frequency (just like the iPhone 1st Gen.) with T-Mobile, you will NOT be able to take advantage of the iPhone 3G/UMTS frequencies.|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	PLEASE buy one that is unlocked or they can unlock.<br>  Jailbreaking it is unlocking it, but you do it on your own.<br>  It is illegal and can ruin your phone.<br>  If it does by chance ruin it, you are without a phone and they will not help you.
lJAaBmlyaa	It's like 4.99 a min and you will be charged for each text and you can even be charged even if you miss a call. I would suggest making sure that you leave the phone off when not in use. Also, you should call verizon because you may have to get a international loaner phone.
QCWGObuuaa	You have to have the internet no exceptions!!!|`|4cMuedpWaa	If you buy it from AT&T, they will force you to get the data plan.<br>  <br>  My ex-girlfriend tried twice and both times they told her to get a different phone if she didn't want the internet.|`|w1bgdByuaa	Yes, if you get an iphone 3G you're required to have the internet package and sign a 2 year contract.. no matter what.
AbRfd29Haa	There are a ton of resources online. You will need a basic understanding of electronics -- you can find schematics and other help, but you need to know what to do with all of that. <br>  <br>  As you've probably read, a theremin starts with an oscillator, same as any musical instrument (in synthesis terms, this is the "exciter", the source of the sound). The rest is basically a radio receiver, which modulates pitch and volume based on your hand positions. Of course, there are many varieties of these, and some people have made similar instruments based on optics rather than RF. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you won't get the whole answer here, but here are some good places to start:<br>  <a href="http://www.thereminworld.com/schematics.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thereminworld.com/schematics....</a><br>  <a href="http://psychevanhetfolk.homestead.com/THEREMIN_linkspage.html" rel="nofollow">http://psychevanhetfolk.homestead.com/TH...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.oldtemecula.com/theremin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldtemecula.com/theremin/</a><br>  <br>  There's even an article from the 50's by Robert Moog (yeah, the synth guy, who also founded a Theremin company called Big Briar), though he's using tubes.. something of a problem today. But reading the theory is worthwhile, even if you find a good schematic with easy-to-find parts. A good source for parts you can't find at the local Radio Shack is Digikey <a href="http://www.digikey.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.digikey.com.</a>
8zt7m010aa	Apple signed a contract with AT&T.<br>  <br>  So unfortunate. Apple first went to Verizon to sign a contract, and they were turned away. Worst decision Verizon has ever made.|`|z88IMXNFaa	The iPhone is exclusive to AT&T until at least 2010.  Also, the iPhone doesn't work on Verizon's network so either the network will have to change or the iPhone will have to be re-engineered.|`|rl6MRtVWaa	Nope, AT&T|`|NdyIFPKWaa	no but verizon made a sim card and you can unlock the i phone and put in the verizon sim card                                                                                                                                    all you  haters but the blackberry storm is on a sim card  so what not cdma

You may need to upgrade your Satellite to HD programming.<br>  <br>  2. Did you guys use an HDMI cable? If not, you should, it'll infinitely improve the quality of the images.

IoKjLtN9aa	You can black list them. The easiest way is by going to www.trapcall.com, they have a free account that's called "fly trap" basically you can find out who "unknown" callers are easily and blacklist numbers. Trap call won't sell your phone number so it's 100% safe. <br>  <br>  Set-up will take about 2 minutes but once you log into the account online you can add numbers to be blacklisted, add the Cancun-crazed telemarketer and say your goodbyes!<br>  <br>  Note: this isn't spam :). It works and it's great, if you need extra help email me! The Do not call list does not activate instantly you may have to wait a while for it to take affect. Your best bet is trapcall for immediate relief.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Contact the Do Not Call list.

EpvHhbByaa	1. Don't know try your local mall. (Live the US so can't really help you there)<br>  <br>  2. More wii remotes, that's it. Oh and a 2nd Nunchuck, for Wii Boxing.<br>  <br>  3. Well as homebrewer, I don't recommend updating, but if you're not a homebrewer, then update it. You have to connect your wii to the internet to update. To update the wii you have to go to the wii settings and choose the one that says update. Then from there it should be straightforward. The updates or normally done against homebrew (cause a bunch of people pirate stuff using hacks) or to make the system run faster, but that's about it. You can also connect to the internet in the settings<br>  <br>  4. There's nothing to worry about different versions. Updating your wii guarantees you the latest version of the wii. The only ones who would worry about the different versions are hackers... well more specifically pirates.
vIKimNDUaa	Rock music like from Linken Park, B.M.T.H., As I lay dieing, <br>  <br>  this is music for parties or getting pumped to do something|`|z86yqj8eaa	Oh my God.<br>  <br>  I don't know for what kind of situation this is, but put yourself in their shoes.  The message you're giving off is, "Live life to the fullest, because you're dying."<br>  <br>  Someone who is dying doesn't want to be reminded they're dying, even if the message you're trying to give off is positive.  This is a VERY sensitive topic.<br>  <br>  If I were in this situation, I would take the person out and have fun with them, make them join clubs or activities to get their mind off of the matter at hand.  Join with them, and have fun.<br>  <br>  Making them a CD telling them to live life to the fullest because you know they're dying is a sweet thing but hard to grasp if you're in his/her situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

pl2SocVKaa	i would stick with my ps2 getting all the games i wish i would have gotten and some good exclusives this year here are the top ones this year<br>  not including god of war 3 because its supposed to come out next year<br>  Quantum Theory<br>  Uncharted 2 Among Theives<br>  inFamous<br>  if it does come out this year Massive Action Game aka MAG<br>  those are the tp 5 exclusives for this year that have been announced already|`|Xxviy63Paa	I would be forced to keep using my ps2 because I am a sworn enemy of Microsoft. I have made a sacred oath to destroy the beast and drive Bill Gates back to the hell he came from, and save the computing world forever.<br>  <br>  And because I don't need no stinkin' Wii. It is like a ps2 with a fancy controller where they only make the sort of games I always hated.<br>  <br>  Look forward to Massive Action Game the first massively-multiplayer shooter on console. It is made by zipper though so it might be good and it might not. Look forward to Fuel which is an off-road racing game on a gigantic online world. It's over 80 miles by 80 miles. That's something new and is worth paying money for.<br>  <br>  Killzone 2 is a neat-looking game with some fancy graphics, from the demo. They make water look like water. The Helghast thoughtfully designed their grenades to leave bright tracers so you can see them before they land and get out of the way in time. They apparently don't have the superhuman ability your side has to be shot about 100 times and still fight at full strength, merely from getting a jolt of electricity. Like a lot of the "look at these graphics" games, the players move kind of slow. Nowhere near as bad as in resident evil though. The mission objectives are confusing. Whenever the squad leader talked, I couldn't figure out what he said, or even which of the 4 surviving dudes was talking. As far as I could tell, my character wasn't wearing goggles, yet there were constantly drops of blood splashing on the visor, or screen, or something. Just like most first-person shooters, you apparently have a camera for a head.<br>    At one point I had only a pistol, trapped behind cover, and there was a dead guy lying there on top of an assault rifle, but I couldn't pick it up because the square wouldn't appear. Laaaame. How long did they work on it, and you can't move a dead body? That's ps2-level engine stuff.<br>    Didn't seem all that great to me. Reminded me of Resistance but colorful instead of brown, and a bit slower. yawn.|`|pOi0wewIaa	I would stick to the PS2 since it would be ridiculous for me to pay $50 dollars online for a year.

It cost around 300$ a month for the phones, not to mention some other fees. So he decided to switch to Cingular, and it has the strongest signal of most cell phone providers. I am glad he got us these phones as they are also very cheap. Hope that helps.

Reason for unlock should be you are travelling overseas and will be using a local sim. They will fill out a request and email you the numbers within 2 to 7 days.<br>  If you dont meet the requirements above, you would have to bring it or mail it to a cellular shop that has unlocking sevices. These are the only 2 ways you can get it done<br>  P.S - Dont let anyone tell you Cingular will not give you the code, if you meet the above requirements, they will submit the form, I have had 4 phones unlocked by Cingular<br>  Cheers

088e45b22430d31bc40cac7b20fa4ccaaa	If your Nokia 7710 belongs to any of the asian countries, then check if your charger supports the VOLTAGE that is used in USA. Observe the charger unit. Does it mention 110~240V @ 50~60Hz? If it does, then it at least supports the voltages here in USA. If your charger does NOT support the voltage, then you need a voltage convertor and is not very cheap..but not too expensive. In this case you will need a 110 to 240V convertor. <br>  <br>  If your charger does support the voltage here in USA, all you need is a socket (pin) convertor. USA uses flat pin sockets in the wall. So the rounded pins of the asian chargers will not go in. So with this convertor (not the voltage convertor) you will be able to plug in. <br>  <br>  Also, was it properly charging when you were in your homeland?

d501dac47140a38c0f40dfe01ff56577aa	If you mean can you use a different services sim card other then orange with your sony ericsson phone the answer is probably. I recently had the same situation on a sony ericsson T226 and I had to bring it to a cell phone store that was not affiliated with one particular service provider and they made it compatible with the service I was looking to use. The trick is finding a store like that. If you call around to some of the "shiftier" stores and ask them if they are capable of unlocking the phone then I am sure you will come across one. The cost of this service is typically about $35. If you are in NYC then look no further. I can tell you where I got mine done.|`|3f2b0e6d5464fa71b768400f0ba688c5aa	Orange are extra difficult because alot of the time they done use sim cards,but at the same time anything is possible but you will have to pay and you will need to work out if its worth paying or just getting another phone.

Either make sure they are on a playlist that syncs to your ipod or if your whole collection does then you are fine.<br>  <br>  For Step 1.<br>  To convert videos to watch on your ipod you need to use a video converter (there are lots available. I use PQ DVD to iPod Converter. This one includes a free trial) . This will compress and size the films so that they look good on the ipod.<br>  <br>  For Step2<br>  This is the same for video as for other files. Use File - Import.|`|AA10406797	OK, please ensure your movie file is ipod readable form, mp4. If not, please get some video converter to covert your video.

Now, you can view you video on your ipod|`|03dfa7e84e779aaad83459db6050e4e0aa	hey<br>   I had the same problem a few days ago when i got my 30gb white video ipod. K so first you have to make sure your computer disc drive reads DVDs, if it does then you have to get a video ripping program my dad said i could go buy one for $25 but I went on google and found this one <a href="http://www.magicdvdripper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magicdvdripper.com/</a> It works really well and its free for the first 5 times you use it, but its not by number of movies, but how many time the program is turned on so collect all the movies you want to put on, and put them all on your computer in one sitting it will take awhile but its worth it :P then once the movie is copied onto your harddrive as a file, you find it then drag and drop it into itune's movie library section. Then the next time you plug your Ipod in to charge and update it will automatically put the movies on for you! :) hope that helps, it worked for me so if you have any trouble or have any questions send me an email :)<br>  Roxy

I wish I could remember the icon on the button.  I do have one correction for you, however.  The answer your calculator is giving you IS the exact answer.  The decimal is an approximation that must be rounded.|`|82b55d95c9ae7573f09a79b422741071aa	hey! i was having the same problem earlier as well.

Check out CNet or Amazon for some good reviews.<br>  <br>  You really need to understand what you want in a new mp3 player.  Different size/form factor?  Video features? etc.<br>  <br>  I recently switched because I wanted to sign up to a monthly subscription music service, and my Ipod can't do that.<br>  <br>  Make sure your existing music library can be ported over to the new device.  It is my understanding that if you bought music from ITunes, you can not easily port this over to a non-Ipod device.  BIG issue if you switching player manufacturers.|`|1cz8m1cMaa	WHY!!!!!! ipods are like so much better than mp3 players cuz u can have pretty cases for them and they work much better than mp3 players u know that its true!!!!!!!|`|HOfrvC91aa	it matters if you have a ipod vidoe go for the sansa connect it has wifi access. if you have a 1 gig ipod get the sansa c240 that i have now. with the c240 you can add more memory. in the box it comes as a 1gig but with more memory you can make a 2gig.|`|MqaDW5v7aa	yes they r i have a mp3 player and it looks like a ipod and everybody says nice ipod and i don't correct them. its a sansa e250 or somthing like that they r really nice too|`|odYYdDvXaa	Get Nokia N91 Music phone with 8Gb internal memory or Sony Ericsson W880i.

AA12123970	Pros: Packed with many useful features<br>  Cons: Not compatible with all bluetooth headsets. Can't find any compatible software for the USB cable (purchased seperately.) Internet usage has too many bugs<br>  Additional Comments: Battery life is incredible! Photo & video features are great. Once you learn to navigate the menu, text messages are sent with ease. Tried to send ringtones to the phone via bluetooth (followed instructions to the letter) but still couldn't download them to the phone (received an error message.) I bought a USB cable to try and transfer ringtones from my computer, but there's no software compatible with this phone to be found anywhere! Also, phone will not connect with the Samsung bluetooth, so I had to buy another brand. Overall, this is one of the best phones I've ever had, but they really need to work out some of these compatibility issues...

If there was such a feature, Apple would put it on their website along with all of the other amazing features intended to impress potential customers. (See <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/iphone</a> if you want to look for yourself!)<br>  <br>  2. A number of sources state that the iPhone will not be a 3G phone, which means that it doesn't have such capabilities. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3g..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3g...</a> for more info about 3G capabilities)<br>  <br>  3. If you've seen an image of the iPhone, or watched the MacWorld Keynote, you'll notice that there's one camera, on the back. Now - it'd be pretty difficult to make a video call if the screen's on one side and the camera's on the other, wouldn't it?<br>  <br>  No idea about the Roborior, so sorry about that!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

You can't go to recovery mode (like that one guy advised) because you flashed 1.50 and there is no recovery mode in 1.50.  The only way to fix it is either replace the motherboard (which you cna do yourself) or install a mod-chip (which yuo can also do yourself).  You can get the motherboard on Ebay (about $50) and the installation is pretty simple.  They usually come with instructions.  If you want to put in a mod chip, google or yahoo search "mod chip". There are several online stores that sell them.  This method will require that you do some soldering.  Unless you are really attached to that psp, I would recommend you sell it on Ebay as a "bricked" psp.  You should get about $60-$80 for it, if it is in good cosmetic condition.  Hope this helped.

lhV2FGXlaa	Refurbished phones in general are SUPPOSED to be factory certified back to original settings but I highly recommend you test the refurbished device to its fullest. I have seen refurbished phones come from the warehouse in worst conditions than a customers phone, some will be missing screws, lcd defective, mic defective, corrosion or liquid damage may be present inside. Who knows this until you request them to check and test it. Check the liquid indicators on the battery and on the back housing of the device, if it is red or solid color beware. Test the charging ports and keypads also. Refurbished phones come with a 14-30 day warranty period, double check with your carrier on this.|`|yNvFETzcaa	>.< refurbished is another word for, something went wrong, sent back to get fixed, hopefully got fixed.  On the serious side, if you're buying a Blackberry, don't get a 'referbed' as they are dub'd, get a 'used' one.  I have 2 blackberry's, work on them and update them...basically, everything under the sun to them.  Once it goes bad, you're heading down that path of "when's the next data loss and will I lose anything important".  Have them clarify if it was truly 'refurbished' or just "used" as in their 14-30 day trial period time frame.  Then the price should be adjusted pertaining to how many minutes are on the "Total Talk Time" or "Life Time Timer". The other thing is ask how much manufacturer's warranty is remaining, if less than 8 months (3/4) is not intact, then I 'personally' would avoid that unit.  Hope this helps:)

So, if you decided to change to another provider, you can still use your phone. Unlocked is better.  If you really won't it locked into Cingular, you could probably take it to a Cingular store and get them to lock it for you.

If that's okay, turn the volume up all the way and hold the microphone cord, the end that connects to the microphone.  Hold the rubber part, with your left hand, not touching the metal part of the plug with either hand.  Then wet a finger on your right hand and touch pin 2 or 3 of the connector.  If you year a buzz in the speakers, the cord and amplifier are working, the microphone is probably bad.  If you do not hear the buzz, either the microphone cord, or the amplifier is not working.|`|1fhP1oddaa	It works great with this that has phantom power and xlr mic pre amps - <a href="http://www.americanmusical.com/sort--s-behringer-mixers-8-track.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanmusical.com/sort--s-b...</a>

ovoXycdhaa	el Z6 amigo es muy bueno <br>  <br>  Aparece una nueva alternativa para escuchar música digital. Y no es un iPod. <br>  <br>  El MOTOROKR Z6, tiene la capacidad de descargar canciones completas en 2 ó 3 segundos, soporta tarjetas microSD de 2 GB por lo que permite almacenar hasta 1000 canciones, cuenta con reproductor MP3 y está equipado con aplicaciones de Linux/Java Windows Media que le facilitan interactuar inmediatamente con computadoras con Windows Media. <br>  <br>  MOTOROKR Z6 permite al usuario comprar y descargar música en más de 200 tiendas musicales en todo el mundo, incluyendo Napster, una ventaja sobre todos los otros equipos. <br>  <br>  Las innovaciones de dise?o icónico creadas por Motorola también se encuentran en el MOTOROKR Z6; presenta una cubierta deslizante y un sólo botón que permite el acceso a la biblioteca y para pausar la música cuando entra una llamada.

AA12180617	YES the APPS and music are stored on your PC and not the ipod the ipod is a slave device to your PC and its your PC that needs backing up not the ipod.    simply pair the new ipod with the computer an it will sync all your music and apps from your PC.    The ipod is designed to work with and be the slave to itunes on the computer to which its paired.    If you do not pair a ipod to a computer you cannot alter its settings.    If you pair your ipod to a new computer it overwrites what's on it.    Simply dragging music onto an ipod does NOT make that music playable it then acts as hard disk. To make the music playable you MUST use itunes to sync with it as only itunes can put the music files in the correct file names (not the same as on the computer) in hidden folders and create the hidden indexes for them to be playable.    When you pair the ipod to a computer it erases ALL the previous library and tracks and replaces it with what the current computer want it to.    if you want to erase the ipod you select RESTORE form the ipod's tab in itunes then it re formats and re installs the ipods firmware resetting everything to default values and removing the lock (except for the touch which asks for the code to allow this)    the ipod needing a master player to sync with is NOT unique to apple Creative, Zune, Sony al have one of one sort or another.|`|ARYLg8ghaa	2 ways as i know, utilize the ipod to ipod tools or the ipod to computer tools, these 2 tools are both for transferring files from ipod to (any new)computer and backup your ipod files.   you can have a look of below review site, which provides the free trial and step by step instruction, hope it useful.

vYG0Hi0iaa	If you bill is due on the 28th, it doesn't mean that that is was when the minutes stopped. It's just when they want their money    here's an example of how my att bill works:     My minutes start on Feb 3rd and will cover Feb 3rd to March 3rd. I will most likely receive my bill for Feb minutes mid-March and the bill will be due, let say March 28.     So it seems to me your bill that is due on Jan 28 might just cover the minutes you used Dec 3rd to Jan 3rd. The minutes you used yesterday will be on a bill you will receive in Feb.     I hope I'm understanding your question right.|`|1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	i work for vodafone... im not so sure about t mobile but im sure they work the same.   u pay for the month previous... but that bill is charged for the 30 day period... automatically ur minutes should renew once that bill has been cleared (do u pay direct debit? its the best way to avoid suspensions on your account or late payments). so the monent your bill comes out of your account, your minutes and texts etc will renew. if you are billed the 28th jan it will usually be taken out of your account 5 days later... meaning you are still under the previous months usuage. so the only way u will be charged in your following bill... is if you have gone over your allowance for the month of january. then u will be charged your standard network rate (i know with vodafone its 10p per text and 25 pence per minute as standard).  have i made any sence? i havent worked on customer services for a month now as im now on credit but im pretty sure thats h0ow it works.    best bet is to call customer services and ask them... as maybe t mobile works a little different from us at vodafone.|`|AA11083274	Yes, on your bill it will say somewhere what dates it covers.  So the bill in hand will have had the last date sometime before you received it.  The next bill you get will cover the overage.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	The only thing I can think of is that turning on the lamp somehow drops the voltage to the clock.  If you have the right bulb in the lamp so too big a bulb isn't the problem, there could be a weak electrical connection that causes a drop in voltage or current as the lamp is turned on.  If the lamp in incandescent, there will be a high inrush current as the filament warms up.    I suppose it's also possible that the lamp switch is faulty or dirty and causes enough noise to confuse the clock, but this wouldn't be very likely.|`|AA12180617	is it a touch dimmer lamp  as they an interfere with electrics, try another lamp as either the lamp /bulb (if CFL) or DAB are faulty.    sometimes changing the bulb (if CFL compact fluorescent can remove the interference)    otherwise its a fault with the DAB.|`|LddkW0JFaa	You mean that the clock radio is plugged into a switched outlet? Plug it in somewhere else. Switched outlets are not suitable for clocks. It might be possible to have the outlet rewired so only the part that the lamp is plugged into will go off with the switch.

0m7kEIDiaa	I started on Jan 1 st and have done an hour a night.  I have lost 10 pounds BUT I have lost far more inches.. two around my waist, two around my thighs, two around my chest etc.  So if I were you, I'd measure as well as weigh.    I do ten mintues running, ten minutes boxing, and ten inutes stepping.. then I do quarter of an hour muscle ones and the same yoga.  Just for fun I do some of the balance ones if I feel I want to at the end of an hour... but I think the mixture of exercises is the important thing really.

1yov0JF9aa	it could be that the answer machine is full, could be that the remote is a access number for some other device.|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Sounds like buddy has an IP service  "VOIP" I could be wrong too but I think that's  it.   the  ring cycle can be change  to answer after a longer ring.|`|wMA2k9nzaa	Mine does it all the time to people, if i dont check all my messages on my portable answering machine, it will get full and when u call me it says enter the remote access code..It means if im calling from another place to home and i wanna punch in my access code, i can retrieve my messages and then empty my machine..I know its a pain, but we all get too busy or too many calls, i wish it was not like that too, maybe as simple as turning the access code part off.
qaPyaFUcaa	yeah you have to flash the firmware from the old drive and put it on the new one.  It's a SATA drive so you need SATA ports for the computer and it will take a bunch of work.      I think that spending the $100 may be worth it.  A new DVD drive is only like $30, but if you don't have experience doing something like that it will probably be more than $70 of your time learning how to do it the first time.  And I'm sure it will take at least a week for delivery and at least another week to get it working right.  Also, if you don't have the right tools/parts, expect to be going to a hardware or computer store to get the right ones costing even more money.    If you know what flashing firmware and hooking up SATA drives is and have done it many times before, then it's just about a 1 hour process.  If you haven't done it before, it will take a day just to figure out what is going on.

Good Luck!|`|3LjMWownaa	the 65nm is better.  Something like the smaller the chip, the faster it can process.. I can't remember why exactly its better :P
AA11486803	Ur battery is probably a pandora battery. Did u use while u were hacking it? If that did happen. Then u have a pandora battery. U have to buy a new battery.|`|febPjyGHaa	Your battery is probably dead. After so many re-charges and uses, the battery goes KAPPUT! My laptop's battery was so fried that it would actually shut off the computer.
