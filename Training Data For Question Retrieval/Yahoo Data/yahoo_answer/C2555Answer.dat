i5lk5eN2aa	Sounds like your vehicle has a passive anti-theft system (PATS) security feature which recognizes the key. Your remote start system bypasses that system which is why your remote start still works after the battery has been disconnected. But disconnecting the battery for such a long time has caused the key electronic identification code which is stored in the PATS control module and PCM to clear and so your key will not work. If you had only disconnected the battery for a short time, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, it would only be necessary to re-mate the PATS module code and the encoded key to restore communication between the key and PATS module by turning the ignition on and off 3 to 6 times with the your key before attempting to start the vehicle. But the PCM is another matter. If the battery is disconnected for a long period of time the backup power which is stored in it's capacitors will drain and the PATS code which was programmed into it will clear. So if by chance your vehicle has a passive anti-theft system and encoded key, I suspect you will have to take it to the dealer to have the PATS code programmed into the PCM again.
Yq2CUhtYaa	So take it to autozone, who will read it for free.<br>  <br>  If they say the same thing, there's your answer.<br>  <br>  Seems like that would have been the first, and logical thing to do: get a second opinion.|`|VC7PyH53aa	The service engine soon light usually doesn't warn you on upcoming service, it's usually a problem detected by the computer. <br>  Make sure the gas cap is on tight, tighten it then turn it until it clicks at least three times. <br>  Most "service engine" lights are caused by emissions. <br>  <br>  If they checked the computer and no codes were returned more than likely it's emissions related. Cap, bad gas, etc. If it's one of these the light will usually go out after a couple days. The computer will continue to sample the emission sensor and when it gets a certain amount of good readings it will extinguish the warning light. <br>  <br>  If you continue to get the light and there's no problem the dealer may be able to download new software to the onboard computer that may decrease the sensitivity of the computer. <br>  <br>  Had a similar problem with a 2003 Nissan Altima and the dealer loaded new code the fixed the persistent "Check Engine Light".|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	When the MIL light comes on (service engine soon) it sets a code in the computer. Find out what fault code is being set - I've never heard of a "false code." If the computer is kicking out random codes that aren't listed - it's probably a bad computer - otherwise, it's receiving an input that's out of range or defective.|`|5HYabirzaa	If it's been running OK, then you shouldn't have a problem.

When illuminated, it is typically either a red or amber color. On vehicles equipped with OBD-II, the light has two stages: steady (indicating a minor fault such as a loose gas cap or failing oxygen sensor) and flashing (indicating a severe fault, such as catalytic converter damaging engine misfire). When the MIL is lit, the engine control unit stores a fault code related to the malfunction, which can be retrieved with a scan tool and used for further diagnosis.
pZ9eA5rYaa	If you car isn't out of alignment changing the rims won't matter. But it is also a good idea to have the alignment done once in a while.  If you don't by the time you notice your tires wearing unevenly it's too late to save them. It's just good maintenance.|`|jI2frGsraa	You shouldn't need an alignment after changing wheel sets.

If you are regularly speeding up on yellow, and haven't cleared the intersection before the light is red, you are driving dangerously, not to mention illegally.<br>  <br>  Sorry,
QcENsfCEaa	The car can be a the auction for many reason the only auction that has the best cars are the dealer closed sales. To get access to those he has to be a new dealer for that brand. In an open sale the car could be there for many reason repo, overage dealer inventory, bad history, wrecked and rebuilt lemon car bought back by dealer. If the car has not been a buyback the factory warranty might still be in place but you don't have much protection on the auction cars.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Cars bought through the auctions are sold as is.

2F5XkiHLaa	The vast majority of auto experts will tell you that GM vehicles do not have quality issues like was the case in the 80's & early 90's, and that American cars are equal to or better than imports as to quality. The customer surveys also concur with that evaluation.<br>  <br>  The problem is that US automakers are not making cars that have the styling or features that consumers want. And being too slow to adjust to the market when it changes. And legacy costs that add over $1500 to each car made. When the top management has to be health care experts & operate hospitals for the retired help & all their dependents, that's a problem.<br>  <br>  As to your Caddy problems, I would find that totally unacceptable & it would be at the dealer until they fixed it, or they give me a new one.

Lastly the tyres could be on their way out  so check for proper pressures, tread and life.<br>  good luck|`|G5zN12dbaa	Check for warped rotor's, or sometimes a sticky piston on brake caliper can cause this.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Standing next to your bike, apply the front brake and push down hard on the bars, if there is a noise or grindy feel, that will be steering head bearings. Get a mate to support the bike and try to move the front wheel sideways, too much movement will indicate worn wheel bearings. Attach a pencil to the fork with a cable tie or tape with the point just touching the disc and rotate the front wheel, if the gap varies it is warped.

If you do sell it, be prepared for the buyer to call you with any problems they find. <br>  <br>  If you owe more on the car than it is worth, you will have to pay the bank the difference to sell it yourself. A dealership can just add it on to the new loan.<br>  <br>   If the Malibu is paid off, and you are not happy with what the dealership is offering, just keep it and put it on craigslist. It is free, and you do not have to put your phone number in the ad.<br>  <br>  If there is a carmax nearby have them appraise the car for you. They will buy the car even if you do not buy one from them.<br>  <br>  If you are financing the new car, the dealship can give you time to sell the Malibu yourself.  They can put your first payment due day off for 45 days. You can also negiotate to have them make your first couple of payments to give you even more time.
KtlurIK8aa	Its there in case you need it not that you may ever. If a car was designed to only drive a maximum of 55 and you drove it at that speed there would be no safety margin of error - you would be at the maximum all the time. You would have no ability to pass someone if needed. By designing the ability to drive faster they make it a safer car. Same with brakes. They stop faster than you need to with big caliper, rotors and ABS. Most of the time you don't need to stop quick but if you do it's there for you.

9irae1CRaa	Every car can have a different cause for the same problem. Start with the easy stuff first like the reservior cap for leaking under pressure. Remember as the temp increases in the system it creates pressure which inturn raises the boiling point of the coolant.So any part of the system that flows with air/coolant can be at fault.A real technician can figure it out without changing a bunch of parts to find it. To confirm or deny the head gasket take a dry compression test. If two or more cylinders record low reading theres one problem.Restricted air flow or restriction of flow to the radiator is another problem. Also air pockets in the system can cause overheating. By the way northstar engines usually start to leak internally on the rear head. The problem with these engines the threads in the block start to go away with coolant failure (corrosion) the block will have to be rethreaded with special tools  a 11mm hole   block is junk if this cannot be done.There is a update to the block with threads/inserts its less expensive to replace the engine than buy the tooling.|`|777f732c652de904558ecd13874c531faa	when a headgasket goes there many signs smoking is one of them but it can still be the head gasket . is there oil in your coolant bottle or water on your dipstick or oil cap,you can some times smell cardon in your coolant bottle.<br>    hope this helps|`|xTt2jqxeaa	a few other things can cause it to, like maybe it needs flushed out, ok try this, once the engine is hot, shut it down and feel the radiator next to the fan and see if you feel cold spots, and if you do, the radiator needs flushed out, also you could have a hose going closed, while your driving and also it could be the water pump acting up, but if i were you, i would give it a good flushing out first, oh by the way, i almost forgot, see if the fan is kicking on.|`|NRtqNelmaa	Do you see an antifreeze leak?

Frist look for a  constant or continuous flow of large bubbles (like a pot of boiling water) which indicates compression gases are in the cooling system. These bubbles are typically larger than 1”, and bubble at a rate greater that 1 bubble every 2 seconds. No bubbles or intermittent bubbles indicates the assembly<br>  is OK.  Perform a Combustion Gas Leak Check (Block Test Kit) on the cooling system to verify “bubble test” before proceeding to pull the heads. To confirm combustion gas leaks into the cooling system, recheck the system with a fluid<br>  type block checker (combustion leak check).<br>  <br>  Block tester available as:<br>  Snap-On GDCT16<br>  Napa BK. 700-1006<br>  <br>  1. Disconnect or clamp off the coolant reservoir hose so that the tester does not draw coolant from the reservoir.<br>  2. With the radiator cap off, drain or siphon the fluid down to the bottom of the filler neck.<br>  3. Start the vehicle and let it run until it reaches normal operating temperature (so that the coolant has already expanded).<br>  4. Continue to siphon fluid down to the bottom of the filler neck while squeezing the upper and/or lower radiator hoses.<br>  5. Add test fluid to the tester and perform the test according to instructions for your equipment. <br>  6. Identify the color of the fluid after performing the check (BLUE or YELLOW):<br>  <br>  If the fluid remains BLUE, the block is OKAY. If YELLOW you need to replace the head gasket and inspect for any cracks.|`|vvgw5MBTaa	1. Have the cooling system pressure checked. Should hold 15 PSI with no variance.<br>  <br>  2. Check that the rad fan is operating correctly.<br>  <br>  3. If the coolant has never been changed, then have the radiator flushed  & pressure checked.  The anti corrosion additives break down in the antifreeze, then the aluminium begins to corrode plugging the tubes.  <br>  <br>  _ _ _
fMZnduYoaa	Para la comodidad no hay nada como el AUTOMATICO, con una mano manejas y con la otra muchas cosas,  para revolucionar un auto y sacarle toda la ventaja de ahorro de gasolina EL STANDARD,<br>  Y con respecto a la traccion, nada mas te lo dejo a tu cripterio, Que se te hace mejor????<br>  Jalar o Empujar?????<br>  Pues eso es lo que hace la traccion delantera (jala)<br>  Y la trasera (empuja) tu decide...<br>  Atte<br>   Masto|`|f3c473a4919bb4254ffee71c90f48aa2aa	En primer lugar, el decidir que transmision te conviene mas dependera del uso que le vayas a dar a tu auto; si deseas un auto para carretera, divertido y que puedas sacarle todos esos caballitos que lleva dentro, la transmision manual es la opcion. En caso de que prefieras la comodidad y manejkes en trafico muy seguido (como en la Cd. d Mexico), es mejor un automatico.<br>  <br>  La diferencia mecanica de las transmisiones es basicamente en la manera en que se hacen los cambios, la standard los haces tu mismo cuando kieras con un clutch y la automatica lo hace en base a la potencia que le demandes al auto con el acelerador.<br>  <br>  Una transmision standard ayuda en el ahorro de combustible. claro que esto tambien depende de los habitos de manejo de cada persona, actualmente existe la transmision CVT (continuamente variable) que mejora el consumo de gasolina por arriba del consumo de las transmisiones standard.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, como bien explicaron anteriormente, la traccion trasera empuja, la delantera jala.<br>  <br>  La diferencia radica en muchos aspectos y no solo en lo que mencionan anteriormente.<br>  <br>  Un auto normalmente es traccion trasera debido a que esta enfocado a la mayor transmision de torque posible al eje, por ello los autos de alto desempe?o y las camionetas de arrastre usan este tipo de traccion. Otra caracteristica importante es que los autos con traccion trasera son mas estables en las curvas debido a que su peso esta mejor distribuido a todo lo largo del auto, casi todos los autos y camionetas traccion trasera (excepto pickups) tiene una relacion muy aproximada al 50/50 (esto significa 50% del peso de la unidad sobre el eje delantero y 50% sobre el eje trasero), es debido a esta caracteristica que los autos deportivos de alto desempe?o usan este tipo de traccion en su mayoria, aunque actualmente se usa lo denominado AWD (all wheel drive) que es un sistema de traccion en las 4 ruedas pero no como la de un todo terreno, sino enfocada a la mejor estabilidad y agarre de los autos. Igualmente, un auto de traccion trasera es mas dificil de controlar en situaciones climaticas adversas como lluvia, hielo o derrames de aceite o combustible sobre el pavimento.<br>  <br>  La traccion delantera es usada mas comunmente en los autos de uso diario y vehiculos con motores que no proporcionan una cantidad de torque muy grande, sobre todo es usada en motores que son muy revolucionados para poder ofrecer alto caballaje usando motores de menor capacidad para asi ofrecer una muy alta relacion de consumo de gasolina/potencia (puede observarse en todos los subcompactos, compactos y familiares actualmente). Ademas su construccion es un poco mas sencilla y al ser una traccion que va en la parte delantera del auto, no se necesita un chasis a todo lo largo del auto para soportar toda la transmision, esto reduce el peso de los vehiculos y por lo tanto el costo sobre los materiales. Es mas comoda debido a que el auto es mas predecible y se pueden instalar suspensiones que den mas confort, ya que normalmente un traccion trasera (sobre todo de carga y arrastre) no tiene suspension independiente en su eje trasero. Su mas grande desventaja viene en la estabilidad en curvas, ya que al tener una distribucion de peso de 60/40 aprox, tienden a sufrir fenomenos como el sobreviraje o el subviraje. El gran problema radica que la tendencia normal de los autos de traccion delantera al subviraje, hace que en condiciones de alta velocidad se pueda pasar de subviaje a sobreviraje de un instante a otro por la perdida de traccion de las ruedas traseras. Generalmente, un auto es mas resistente a impactos frontales cuando es de traccion trasera debido a su chasis, por lo cual en caso de colision frontal es muy probable que un auto con traccion trasera no se convierta en chatarra como lo hacen los de traccion delantera, claro que tambien depende del impacto (ojo: con mas resistente no me refiero a mas seguro, eso depende de otros factores).<br>  <br>  Por su construccion, los autos con motor adelante y traccion trasera, tienen una distribucion vertical (a lo largo del auto) de sus componentes (motor, transmision, flecha, diferencial), mientras que los autos de traccion delantera usan una distribucion transversal (a lo ancho del auto), es por esto que normalmente los autos de traccion trasera tienen la "trompa" mas larga.<br>  <br>  Para explicar facil dos conceptos que talvez no sean del todo familiares: Subviraje es la tendencia de un auto a seguir recto mientras se toma una curva.<br>  Sobreviraje es la tendencia del auto a cerrarse o "trompear" en una curva.<br>  <br>  Espero se haya resolvido tu duda y haber respondido lo que deseabas, saludos.|`|8CagqESmaa	el  automatico es aquel donde sacas dinero " cajero automatico" y el standar es aquel que manejan ciertas emprezas etc. para llevar un control de sus productos.  traccion delantera = adelante de   y traccion trasera atras de=  las 2 son buenas|`|Gk09WNPLaa	mira, la transmision automatica no tiene ninguna ventaja sobre la standard, (si acaso la comodidad) pero el standard, tiene muchas ventajas del automatico, <br>  1.- es mas barato<br>  2.- es mas fuerte la tranmision<br>  3.- gasta menos gasolina<br>  4.- es mas barato las refacciones<br>  5.- hace al carro menos vulnerable<br>  <br>  ahora, sobre las tracciones,<br>  <br>  la traccion delantera arrastra al carro, mientras que la trasera lo empuja, eso significa que:<br>  <br>  en la delantera tendras mas seguridad, por que evitas mucho los derrapes en las vueltas, patinara mucho menos el carro,  y sentiras una aceleracion suave.<br>  <br>  mientras que en la trasera, sentiras mas empuje, el carro "coleara" o se te derrapara de atras si metes toda la fuerza del motor,  por eso esa traccion la tienen los carros deportivos, <br>  <br>  la traccion delantera es por seguridad,<br>  la traccion trasera es para diversion, pero nada recomendable para cuando llueva<br>  <br>  espero y te sirva<br>  <br>  saludos!|`|OtnrMtCAaa	partimos de la base de que a mi me encanta conducir.....por eso prefiero el manual, lo manejo  yo .......el cambio de marchas , controlar la velocidad etc , en el automático sólo tienes que agarrar el volante, te relajas......, te olvidas de todo lo demás,  es como si el coche te manejara a ti, mis amigos y familia me dicen que no entiendo.....será eso,  de momento yo me quedo con  el manual.<br>  un saludo

All parts must be stripped off - fenders, tanks, engines, footpegs -- everything. Label them. Metal parts need sanding, priming and painting. Fiberglass parts need different paints and primers. Plastic parts also need different paint. Chrome parts need rechroming. Engine block needs sandblasting and repainted with heat resistant paint. DIY on a part time basis - give or take 3 to 6 months. Then you have to replace cables, broken screws and nuts. Take my advice. Get it done at a shop.

e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Your rotors are probably warped.  Take it to a mechanic and get them checked out.  You will need them either resurfaced or replaced.  <br>  New Front brake pads and rotors will run you about $375 at a local mechanic.  <br>  Not sure if the 2000 accord has rear disc or drum brakes, but If you also need the rears replaced, it would run you about $700 total.  <br>  A Honda dealer will be closer to $1,000.<br>  <br>  If your car is in the 70K-90K mile range, you will probably need the front and rear replaced.  Of course, this depends on prior maintenance and your driving habits.|`|0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	Everyone is right on with what the problem is. Your front disc brake rotors (the large metal discs behind the wheels) are warped (side to side) from the excessive heat they endure causing your brake calipers to move rapidly from side to side causing the pulsing of the brake pedal and under heavy braking you will get vibration throughout the car and steering wheel. <br>  <br>  You can usually get them resurfaced if they have enough metal left to do so, but usually there is not enough left to do so safely (any good shop can measure them and tell). It would be quicker and easier just to get them replaced, but buy them from a Honda dealer or, if you go to an auto parts store, get the premium higher priced rotors as they will have a much higher grade of steel and be much less prone to warping in the future and be much more reliable (know from experience, cheap ones will go out within 1-2years, good ones will last 2-3 times longer at least).<br>  <br>  You should check the rear brakes too just to see how they are doing, but they will probably not need anything as they do very little braking of the car, most of the braking is done by the fronts.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KtlurIK8aa	Warped rotors. Get them resurfaced.|`|dXW3xD0gaa	One or more of your brake surfaces are warped.  The fact that you feel it in your steering wheel tells me that it is the front brakes.  But it seems that it is only slightly warped because you only get that during hard (harder) braking.<br>  <br>  You can just go get new brakes, and make sure you get your brake discs rotors machined (or resurfaced, etc.).  If I was doing this I would just get new rotors (new discs).  It is almost the same price of having the rotors resurfaced.<br>  ===<br>  Brakes are fairly standard technology and you could take the car to brake specialist and save some money.
xXQEhTyHaa	You got some kine of short in circuits and the parasitic draw drained the battery.  After getting the battery properly recharged (not jump-starting, but use a battery charger) and once fully charged, go into your fuse box, the one at the driver side dash and start pulling fuses until the interior lamp goes out.  Unless something else on that circuit you cannot live with out and do not want to spend  money, leave the fuse out and hopefully no other draws are present, otherwise time to take it to a shop that specialized in automotive electrical, or take it to your nearest Oldsmobile.....(Oldsmobile died in 2005)...make that Chevy or GMC dealer since the Bravada is the same as the Blazer and Jimmy.  Oh yeah, check both front door dash areas to make sure the switches are not broken.|`|NRtqNelmaa	Disconnect the battery from the car and charge it.

Until there are hydrogen "gas" stations EVERYWHERE what good is the car?|`|HPqA4P5Laa	As far as I'm concerned, they'll never be practical.  Hydrogen can only be used to store energy; hydrogen can not be used as a source of energy because it is not readily available by itself; though, I guess maybe you can find clouds of frozen hydrogen gas in space, but good luck ;-).  The energy it takes to aquire hydrogen, such as from water with electrolysis, is more than the energy the hydrogen releases when it's combusted.  In addition, the current energy density of a tank of hydrogen is much less than that of gasoline due to the practical limits of storage tanks we can build.  Therefore, I believe we should look at other, more practical sources of energy for the automobile.

fJpRCaVDaa	The larger the engine, the more exhaust is produced and a larger outlet is required. This can be done many ways, such as one large pipe, or two or more smaller pipes. On smaller cars that are not focused on performance, one pipe is used. If the car is a performance car, there are performance advantages gained by using dual exhausts. It allows the gases to leave the engine quicker and smoother, providing more power. But this costs more $$$. It is very rare for a car to have more than two exhaust tubes. If you see four round outlets on a car, they are usually tied together, and there for just looks.<br>  <br>  The silencer (muffler) is larger as it is designed to absorb noise by using baffles, and/or tubes with holes drilled in them. This has the effect of silencing the loud noise.|`|KtlurIK8aa	One pipe (usually) per cylinder. 2 cylinder harleys have two pipes. 4 cylinder bikes have four pipes.
KtlurIK8aa	The float stuck is what it sounds like. Smaller engines use gravity to push the gas to the intake. If the float sticks gas will continue to run into the engine even with it off.

r9H8AXIsaa	That doesn't make any sense....<br>  The daylight running lamp uses the same filiment as the low beam headlight.  The control circuits are not headlamp dependent.  The only thing unique is the ground side, each has it's own path.  The only thing I can think of is the ground for your headlight is missing and is getting it through the high beam elements from your other lamp.<br>  <br>  There are a number of ways to test this.  Remove the lamp bulb from the socket on the one that is bright and turn on your lights.  If you are missing a ground then the dim bulb will not light.  Or you could run a short wire to ground from the ground wire, on my Taurus it's Dark Green with an Orange stripe on it that then gets connected to a Black wire.  You should see a difference by grounding it.<br>  <br>  Do your high beams work?  If you're missing a ground, it won't work either.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,  Good luck!|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	clean ground wire at the body screw - rust or loose|`|0Nwt0H7aaa	I think you may be on the right track by guessing the problem is related to a short.  I would check the socket that attaches to the bulb(the wire pigtail). Look for broken or wires that are nicked, corroded or pulled out of the socket more than the others.  If possible, gently push the wires tight into the socket with a needle nose tool or your fingers.  A multi-tool is handy for this kind of stuff.<br>  Compare the two sockets and the wires going to them, they should look the same and the wires should be clean and tight.<br>  If you have access to a multimeter, you can check for power, ground and short.<br>  A simple 12 volt test light can be used to confirm that there is power to the socket, ground the clip end to the cars frame and use the probe to find the socket for power, again both the right and left sockets should test the same.  Good luck.<br>  This should be an easy fix, any repair shop should be able to fix it  cheap and easy.|`|DUnx53cOaa	Sounds like a poor ground. Unplug the lamp and turn on the lights. Using a multi-meter verify that you have 12v at one terminal,hit the brights and verify 12v at 2 terminals. The remaining terminal is your ground. Switch the meter to ohms and verify ground at that terminal. My hunch is that the reading will not be 0.00. You should trace the harness back (peel it apart as you go) and you will most likely find corrosion at the next ground connector you come to. Repair that connection and apply an anti-corrosion grease. This is one of those fun mechanic things you run into but just take your time and don't "yank" on any wires. Remove what you have to to gain access to the harness and you should be fine.

If the paperwork signed says it's theirs then they can legally retain the deposit. However, most reputable dealers would understand and refund the deposit as they were able to sell the boat.<br>  <br>  Bottom line...the buyer should visit with their attorney, with any/all paperwork in hand, and find out where they stand on this as the deposit is more than likely more than would be allowed in a small claims court case.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Boater can sue for restitution arising from "unjust enrichment," where by virtue of his ability to sell the boat to Sail, Boatee has been enriched at Boater's expense.  Boatee's enrichment was unjust due to the absence of consideration.<br>  <br>  Boatee might be able to demonstrate some expenses related to finding a new buyer, inventory carrying costs, etc., that reduced his enrichment.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Yeah.<br>  <br>  Pay it off.<br>  <br>  You want to protect your credit, but you bought a boat on a loan. Which is a complete contradiction.

NwHRr3ieaa	HP is an HP whether it's electric, gas diesel or steam.  That's the short answer.  Length of running time on charge is the limiting factor.<br>  Here are some sites that will give you some specs so you can make an informed decision <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.outboardelectric.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outboardelectric.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://electricoutboards.com/motors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://electricoutboards.com/motors.htm</a>|`|RjUhISEIaa	I believe since you referenced the size of a gas motor that you may be talking about an electric trolling motor. Correct? If not I do apologize but if so...<br>  <br>  If heading directly into a strong wind you could indeed have problems with a trolling motor not having the power to get you back. Course the same could happen to you with a 9.9 hp gas outboard. <br>  <br>  My preference would be to go with the gas outboard just because it will have more power than the trolling motor.|`|1X8Kjdilaa	Never heard of a electric boat motor,I know they have small bow thrusters that are used for sneaking into spots to target bream<br>  <br>    I have looked around on some sites, they have transom mounted thrusters,can't seem to find enough info,to many options, i would talk to your local boat shop<br>    Alot of it depends on the size of your tinnie,and its weight|`|I7NkFJo2aa	Of course the really cheeky answer would be to put a sail up on a windy day and use pure solar power!!<br>  <br>  Sorry, I just couldn't resist.<br>  <br>  Electric motors were very quickly banned from drag racing because no fuel engine can compete.  A 200 hp electric motor is about two foot long by one foot or so through. An equivalent to 10 hp will be about the size of a roll of toilet paper.  (off the top of my head around 6.5 kW?)<br>  <br>  The problem will not be the motor, it will be the battery capacity.  Huge strides are being made in this field as we speak, but the other issue will be expense.  I have seen an eighties model 8 hp Suzuki with the two stroke engine removed and an electric motor grafted on happily planing a small boat with a big bloke on it.  It is great fun for an hour and then you plug it in and wait ten hours for it to charge, that's the only serious problem with it, apart from the cost of batteries in the first place, but if money is not an issue then it is very viable.  And yess you could have a generator to back up your batteries, but why not go diesel/electric instead?  It is viable too but a lot of simplicity is removed and that is always a negative in practice.  The more complicated a system is the more bits there are to fail.  <br>  <br>  Given the necessity to find alternatives this link is interesting indeed... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.electrygen.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.electrygen.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.  ^ _ ^  
nAzbLdBCaa	I've been around boats for sometime and I don't have a good suggestion that would meet your needs.  I guess you need to be creative.  maybe a pontoon boat with some type ramp or well cut into the deck.  Most cruisers would have to be very large to handle the weight aft. Say in the 50 and up range.  A lot of 80-90 footers would have deck space and hoist to lift the jet ski's aboard, but i don't think thats what you have in mind.  I'll look around and get back to you if I find something.  Good luck!|`|RjUhISEIaa	Carrying 3 skis could be done Laura but the vessel of 50+ feet would have to be specially outfitted to do so. You'd be looking at a cruiser with a sedan bridge that has a cover going over the aft section of the boat. You'd have to place a davit on the cover to raise/lower one ski to the water. You'd have to have a 2nd davit on the bow to raise/lower the 2nd ski to the water. The 3rd ski could be placed on an extended/modified swim platform that could be raised/lowered into the water. Seating/sleeping on this vessel for 3 would be no problem but your folks may have a small little problem with the price tag that could be in the $600-750,000 range...even for a used vessel.<br>  <br>  It can be done but it isn't going to be cheap.<br>  <br>  |`|dve7lfcEaa	Your only option is to get a boat that hauls one, and ride the other two, and anchor or tie them by your boat when you get there, Tying them in a line is not very smart, you have to idle, and also is not safe at all, but you really don't have many choices with having three jet ski's.|`|PXa3IUWHaa	you can tie your jet skis  in a line one behind the other and tow them behind you boat|`|3q2xvG1waa	My dad's boat can hold 2 jet skis.  It is about 75 feet.  I think it was expensive.
I7NkFJo2aa	I wasn't going to get into this, as there is no answer that is not based on personal prejudice.<br>  <br>  No material is any better than it's maintenance schedule and how skilfully the boat was built.<br>  <br>  Steel rusts, rust never sleeps, neither do lazy owners.  fairly noisy.<br>  <br>  Wood is my personal favourite, the epoxy encapsulation method is really quick and very strong compared to more traditional methods, it would be disingenuous suggest it will outlast in practical terms a correctly built Fibreglass or similar synthetic structure.  Traditional wooden structures well maintained can last much longer. Quiet.  <br>  <br>  (edit <br>  <br>  Timber is a maintenance issue to the uneducated, however there is a big plus in the absolute life privilege of care taking all those tonnes of irreplaceable timber - exquisitely formed by craftsmen into the highest physical representation of a human dream.  Have you ever considered the reason why that incredible shape of a Spitfire speaks to so many millions for so many decades??   Consider that the steel tea clippers were a copy of the timber originals, yes there was a technical reason for the new materials but the form came from wood and it's craftsmen/caretakers.) <br>  <br>  Fibreglass up until recent years was commercially applied using chopper guns to a great degree, unfortunately it was only realized very recently that this method caused osmosis problems by the very act of combining air gasses with the resin under pressure - also overworking with rollers etc.  Modern chopper guns use well under 2 psi to reduce this significantly, and the technique of vacuum bagging, or resin infusion is very good.  Most marinas and pull out services in the world have osmosis treatment of fibreglass hulls as a core business.  Fibreglass is low maintenance in the short term but there are many silly claims made about all forms of boat materials I find.  Quiet. <br>  <br>  Aluminium is light and strong, it has terrible problems with electrolysis and can be affected by other vessels and marinas with lots of strange sediments and any electrical fields.  I found this the best material for commercial boats but it is not low maintenance - again many claims to the contrary but it is hyperbole, It is prone to internal condensation if not well insulated.  Very noisy.<br>  <br>  Rotational moulded polypropylene boats with expanded foam internally are very very light, very strong, and probably impossible to sink, they are best as runabouts under 7 metres from reports, they are very new in the scheme of things and I felt like I was driving a really flash icebox, very quiet.  They just don't quite feel like a real boat to me but I am a timber freak.<br>  <br>  Ferro cement is guaranteed to polarise responses.  I like it but it has a bad reputation due to often hysterical claims and many foolish and doomed designs dramatically failing.  Done right is very satisfying and long lasting, Very quiet and soft riding.  Most people who object to the material have never owned one, nor had any objective information in it's pros and cons.<br>  <br>  I have owned, worked on and sworn colourfully at most of these materials for over thirty years now.  Cabinetmakers like wooden boats, (and ex-farmers I note but don't know why)  Engineers like metal.  Accountants and white collar workers like 'glass.  Handy people who like to do all their own work often gravitate towards ferro. <br>  <br>  All of this is a generalisation and only based on my twisted ideals, in the end it comes down to a very simple formula - go with what you can afford, go with what makes you feel good, go now.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|VhhEz92Oaa	Boatin' in VA and Trunorth both said it best.  Although it's just my opinion, a well maintained wood boat is far superior in looks and warmth than a fiberglass or steel boat, and just as seaworthy, but you either have to do a lot of maintenance yourself, or be able to pay someone else to do it for you.<br>  <br>  You might buy some magazines that specialize in wood boats, fiberglass boats and if you can find one, steel boats.  See what is really involved in the maintenance and ownership of each type and what owners think of them, then decide.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	My vote goes to a Marine-grade aluminium alloy (there is a BS number but my tame graduate metallurgist isn't around at the moment!).<br>  My boat is 8 years old and has had no hull maintenance, nor do I expect any during my use of the boat.<br>  Have a look at the web site of "Sea Otter Boats" for further info about this material and the Organisations who use boats made of this metal -The guys in Oz and NZ call aluminium hulls "Tinnies" by the way!|`|AA11432856	I have owned all three  a 1920 49 foot Seawitch  annual haul out and bottom paint  Ouch <br>  <br>  A 36 foot steel trawler   forever scraping and painting Finally bit the bullet and had it painted with Veratane;  you know off shore oil rig paint. <br>   <br>  26ft  fiberglass  boat (notice how they got smaller as I got older) give me glass any time, never rots, never rusts and it is  not susceptible to galvanic corrosion  ever see what happens to an aluminum boat when the uninitiated use copper bottom paint; or heaven forbid there is bronze  or copper in the water next to it .|`|74bb06db9c32162f9863d7db7741a968aa	In my opinion:<br>  <br>  Wood is great, if you have a LOT of time on your hands to repair it.<br>  <br>  Steel is cold, and hard to repair unless you have a welding torch around the house<br>  <br>  Fiberglass is much easier to repair, and minimum maintainance, if you can glue two peices of wood together and then sand them, you can repair a fiberglass boat.|`|FaUXuLxRaa	WOW!<br>       You are bound to get many a varied answer on this one, as we all have our preferences...<br>       Today however, (if you want a good, solid, quite, smooth ride) the very best is fiberglass over good solid wood. With today's high-tech boat epoxy resins (which by the way they are now even coating steel with)... a solid wood boat with a good saturation and lamination of epoxy is pound for pound stronger then steel... add to that a layer (or two even) of fiberglass over the hull - and you have yourself a vessel that will out live your Grand Kids' Grand Kids.

Why? Washing and waxing is all that's required and not washing, waxing, stripping, refinishing, etc. Fiberglass definitely allows the mariner to enjoy their time on the water yet does not carry the beauty of wood or the durability of steel.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Wood is my love. I currently have six wooden boats, and you must have a special relationship with them because they take a ton of work. Classic lines, great fun to drive, and the sound of that inboard engine is music to my ears.<br>  <br>  For fishing boats aluminum seems to be the best. Light, strong, and low maintenance.<br>  <br>  For ski boats and cruisers fiberglass is the way to go.
HSK6P8ZYaa	As you are in UK - I have tried Mr Muscle on boats with some success (as it happens on a Picton). Don't sand it there is no way back from that process!  There are also some proper prodcts avaibale from chandlers.|`|RjUhISEIaa	There is a product on the market called "Slimy Grimy" that is supposedly a non-toxic hull bottom cleaner. You can order this online from West Marine and Boaters World that should do the trick.<br>  <br>  While designed for the bottom it did a great job on getting stains out of our 89 Chaparral. You will though have to apply marine wax over the areas treated as this will remove the wax from the vessel.<br>  <br>  Car polish and a kitchen surface cleaner will not do the trick as you have learned. If you don't want to try the "Slimy Grimy" you may want to give a light rubbing compound, applied with a buffer, a try. Make certain though it's marine grade and the same holds true for the wax.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|n12lbVvFaa	Complica: it's because the manafacturer of the boat is called Picton. |`|dKBE7Cf0aa	The best thing to try is a buffing compound,with an electric buffer.If this does not bring it back you may need to wet sand the hull first with some fine sandpaper.600 or 800 grit sandpaper.If you decide to do the sanding make sure that the sandpaper is a type used for wet sanding.<br>  I have done this many times and it does a good job.I hope this helps and good luck.|`|iAp0M0Exaa	Don't know. Just intreagued why it is called team picton|`|AA11432856	Get a piece of the same material as your boat and  practice sanding and polishing  on it before you touch your boat  not knowing what your doing may make things worse. If it is truly plastic then,unfortunately there is not much to be done for discolored plastic,you should  not sand a plastic boat . <br>  <br>  If by  plastic you mean fiberglass then sand away use 1000grit wet/dry  paper and wet sand.You can buff any sanding  marks out and make it look like new. <br>  <br>  To test  if it is even possible to bring the color back try using a vinyl protectorant spray like armourall,   spray it on a small test area and rub it in with your bare  hand until the liquid is absorbed . If this brings the color back then the top layer (a few microns thick) of the finish is dead, and sanding is your only option.<br>  <br>  For the inexperienced I recommend buffer speeds no higher than 1500 to 2000 rpm and fine grit polishing compound followed by a good glazing compound, finishing  with a  coat of Marine Boat wax..

You should also have taken your heads (both of them) to a machine shop, where they would have pressure tested and if needed milled your heads flat again(would cost about $100 and is very important after over-heating). You are most likely going to need new oxygen sensors and catalytic converters if you have been running your vehicle in that condition for a long time(anti-freeze destroys both over time(not much time either)). Honestly this could get a lot more expensive and because you are not working on the car yourself, you could save a lot of time, hassle, and likely money also, just by taking your van to a reputable and licensed service center. Sometimes your auto-insurance will cover it if you go to a licensed mechanic, look into that.

VhhEz92Oaa	Crunchy or smooth?<br>  <br>  I ask that because the amount of toilet paper you'll need is directly proportional to the amount of smooth peanut butter you eat.  On the other hand, if you intend to take crunchy peanut butter, you'll need to recalculate using this formula:<br>  <br>  1 lb of CPB consumed = 4.23 rolls TP (on a standard day)<br>  <br>  1 lb of SPB consumed = 3.48 rolls TP (standard day)<br>  <br>  I won't bother you with temperature and humidity factors.  The most effect would be very low temperatures, which I assume you'll avoid.<br>  <br>  Another consideration is the weight.  Every school kid knows that a 1 lb. jar of smooth peanut butter weighs almost 3.5 ounces more than that of crunchy peanut butter.  The reason being, that the solid peanut chunks are less dense than the finely ground material in smooth.  Also, smooth peanut butter has more oil by volume than crunchy.<br>  <br>  I'd consider taking fishing tackle to supplement your PB meals and don't forget, for every jar of PB, you'll need 0.72 jars of the same size of jelly.<br>  <br>  So, I'm pretty sure that you can get by on 14 pounds of smooth PB and 10 jars of your favorite jelly.  Naval jelly, right?  And the math says you'll need almost 49 rolls of TP, but you can get the double rolls in a twelve pack, so get two of those.  A couple of plastic bags would be handy as well.  And take some crossword puzzles.

Stability is key to a sailboat, but long and skinny is better than short and boxy.  A pointed bow and square stern.  You need a simple way to steer, like a fixed rudder, but not too big.  The sail can be alum foil, paper, or other stiff material. Cloth, while more realistic, doesn't work well.  A keel, helps keep it upright, I like a weight on the end of a rod. I like a bullet shaped limp of clay on the end of a pencil. I've seen waterproofed paper, wood and even ones made of soap, but it's your project, you choose!

AA11599219	The one thing nobody here has addressed is that this may depend on location.   In the U.S., radio use is regulated by the FCC.   They have purposely designated some frequency as Citizen's Band i.e. CBs which have very little regulation.<br>  <br>  VHFs however do not use citizen ban frequency and have many regulations.  Among these are that they are supposed to be use on the water or shore to ship, and not used like CBs on land.<br>  <br>  This is true regardless of the output power or channels used, however there are additional regulations about what channels are supposed to be used for certain purposes, as well as many other rules about hailing, call a mayday, pan-pan, etc.<br>  <br>  For inland use, you can use your cell phone in most places or you can get affordable citizen band walkie talkies which perform in much the same way as VHF radios, but are meant to be used on land by the average citizen.<br>  <br>  The U.S FCC has no jurisdiction in other countries, so different regulations may exist, though I know marine VHF protocals are similar though out the world.|`|q3aq7IoCaa	Hi ,<br>  you actually need to hold a license to operate any sort of marine radio which would involve a short course.Marine radios can only be used for marine purposes and have many channel guides-working port etc.Im afraid it would be illegal for you to use it just to talk to friends even if inland sorry but I hope this helps|`|iaVo3t2oaa	actually it isnt i work for amajor marine engineering company and as said not illigal but think you,ll find using them inland you,ll get a lot of taxi traffic "same freqency we control our dredgers from shore also so puts pay to the argument about using them off a boat|`|AA10110341	Marine radios CANNOT be used for land communications.

I agree that every boat is a little different and if your not trained or have years of experience, you can miss something.  It's not "Rocket Science" but one mistake is costly. There are a lot of factors involved.  Particularly with EFI systems.  There's also been a lot of discussion of what to do about E10 fuel...

I7NkFJo2aa	In the end it all comes down to quality, of product, of service, of communication, of backup and complete professionalism and absolute honesty.<br>  <br>  Seems pretty straightforward but it is hard to do it perfect without total commitment of your entire team - and your customers will judge you by the action and attitude of all your staff, even the work experience kid.<br>  <br>  The one's who only shop on price are like mayflies - very fleeting and as loyal as a total stranger's dog.  In the end it is much harder to get a loyal customer base than to lose it.  Advertising should be outside the square if you don't want to get into a spending war with all the like businesses in your market.<br>  <br>  Get a bright junior and set up an internet based window to your business - with as near to immediate response as a priority.  Double check and send orders ASAP.  <br>  <br>  One thing in business is to do the opposite of the current 'normal' thing, obviously not to be stupid about it but you must create your own niche.  No-one can outspend and compete head to head with the giants, so don't try. <br>  <br>  Run your business efficiently, but do not lose sight of the requirement for quality over all else.  People are not offended if something costs a bit - even a lot - more than an alternative as long as the value for money is apparent.  If it costs another $20.00 per hour for a service but you are getting a lot more for the money there is no issue.  Sometimes quality costs.  If you discount too much you will go broke anyway.  That applies to your service and sales staff - invest in accredited up to date training so your team becomes cutting edge - if people are worth more then don't pay more - establish a bonus share scheme so if you benefit so do they - in cash and kind.  Make it clear why a job has gone sour, explain why there is no bonus and use it as an improvement tool internally, for all staff, keep them in the loop and have a tool box meeting once a week where all issues can be aired and grievances and praise dealt with no matter how small.   Make your most expensive asset - your staff - want to stay so you do not waste effort and time training all the time and that loyalty will make you sales and money.  In this day and age you should police check your staff, and enforce drug free workplaces.  How you use this information is up to you - I won't necessarily get rid of someone with a record or an occasional binge but I INSIST on knowing all about it as a condition of employment so I can make an informed decision - also you the employer are liable potentially so you have to know.<br>  <br>  Don't leave customers to float around for ages before they are politely asked how you can help them - but also don't drop on them too aggressively, you might scare them away.  Train staff to be honest if they don't know something, and that they will immediately find out about it.  Customers need to feel important and wanted.  By the same token do not allow debtors any slack at all.  If someone cannot pay then immediately get some small agreement in place for whatever they can afford - if you wait a year for $200.00 then that was a total  loss after three months.  Do credit checks on everyone - it is cheap insurance for you.  <br>  <br>  I buy from places I feel comfortable and whom I trust, places that give me confidence in the product and the service.  I have had some good runs with the cheap Chinese product but it is fair to say that there is a lot more rubbish than good in that market.<br>  <br>  We are all being pretty conservative at the moment in this current low cycle - I don't entirely agree with the over simplistic 'spend money to make money' mindset, as it is far more important to keep debt low, and spend money intelligently to grow the business in a controlled and steady manner.    |`|AA11599219	I've purchased several boats ranging from a used kayak to a brand new Beneteau 33.

What are you selling? Are they bass boats? Runabouts? Cruisers? A combination of all? Where are you located? Winters get cold? Do you have or are you associated with a marina? Here's why I ask...<br>  <br>  Bass boats...offer to throw in free tackle or uprgardes to the boat that won't break your bank, free service the first year and winterization. And maybe $500 dollars of free gas?<br>  <br>  Runabouts...throw in ski or tubing equipment, free 1st year service and winterization and $500 of free gas.<br>  <br>  Cruisers...at our marina, depending upon the size of the cruiser, they will throw in from 6-12 months free slippage, winterization, and/or free 20 hour checkup plus $1000 of free gas.<br>  <br>  Pricing...the biggest issue and for those of us in the know it's understood that boats have a huge markup from the dealer. Our dealer tells this to every customer..."The vessel is listed at $X amount and why don't you 1) let me know what you want on it (equipment) and 2) what you are willing to pay for it and I'll let you know if I can make the deal." Even during these down times they sold a good sized number of boats (more runabouts but small cruisers too) for they are still able to cover the cost and price reduction with the markup they have and make a profit.<br>  <br>  It's not always what you can give away that will make the deal but the deal itself. If you can lessen their upfront cost and out of pocket first year expenses you should be able to make more deals than the competition. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|csmEH6qsaa	Shop your competition and make sure that your prices are 'right'.  Have a clean and organized show room, shop and parts room.  Offer a training trip with new owners or an electronics training for new customers. <br>  <br>  Think up some thing for the wives or the family - offer upgraded safety equipment - colored PFDs instead of the standard orange for inland vessels, or host a boaters safety class for the new owners family.<br>  <br>  Get out in you community and talk to fishing groups, yacht clubs, any boating groups about boating or how they can save money on their boat.  Don't make it a commercial for your shop, but if your make friends with the boating groups they are more likely to visit your showroom to look at your models.  <br>  Keep your overhead as low as you can too, makes it easier to offer a little better deal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck !

AA10346371	All of my cars have always been American.<br>  <br>  My last 4 have been General Motors products.  I currently own 2 General Motors products.  I have always found them to be well built reliable cars.<br>  <br>  I currently own a 1995 Pontiac Grand AM that I bought new. It has about 150,000 trouble free miles on it.  It never had any major mechanical failures.  It uses no oil. It always starts. it always gets me there.  It still drives and rides well.  Everything still works.  I really got my money's worth out of this one.<br>  <br>  My other car is a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu that I bought new. It has about 130,000 trouble free miles on it.  It never had any major mechanical failures.  It uses no oil. It always starts. it always gets me there.  It still drives and rides well.  Everything still works.  I also got my money's worth out of this one.<br>  <br>  My brother owns a 1990 Buick that he uses as a daily driver.  This car has over 300,000 miles on it.  My brother-in-law has a 1985 Chevrolet pickup truck with almost 400,000 miles on it.<br>  <br>  Who says American cars don't last.<br>  <br>  The idea that the Japanese make cars are better is a myth created by good marketing.<br>  <br>  My son owns a Dodge Avenger.  This is a Mitsubishi with a Dodge body.  What a poorly designed piece of crap.  Especially the Mitsubishi engine, transmission and suspension.  His next car will be a Chevy.<br>  <br>  Toyota is the company that really has everyone fooled.  What crap.  To see what I mean, open your favorite Internet search page.  Search "Toyota Sludge" or "Toyota Rust" without the quotes.  Of course, Toyota blames these wide spread problems on the owners.  But this is happening too much to be from owner neglect.  It kind of says something about how well Toyota stands behind their product.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is that everyone is ragging on the Unions that protect the American workers.  Here's what's not so funny.  American workers working in the Japanese assembly plants are paid less and have less benefits.  But the American made Japanese cars still cost about the same as their American counterparts.  So where is the excess profits going for these cars?  You guessed it, Japan.  Japan makes all the money while the hard working Americans get screwed.<br>  <br>  So what would make these American made Japanese cars better?  Are the Americans working in the Japanese assembly plants any smarter than the Americans working in the domestic assembly plants? No.  Are the materials used in the Japanese cars built by the American workers any better than the materials used in the domestic models? No.  Are the engineers in the domestic companies less educated than the engineers working for the Japanese companies. No.  The only thing that makes the Japanese cars better is marketing.  They have everyone convinced that the domestic makes are still made to the same quality standards of the late 70's.<br>  <br>  My next car will be another General Motors Product.|`|wpgRMjgraa	The cars coming out now form America now are just as good if not better then imports.<br>  <br>  America now has the BEST warranty ANYPLACE from Dodge "LIFE TIME" not one import has that!<br>  <br>  Imports save money by using cheap labor to build parts and cars for them, they are able to invest into better stuff because they save the money on labor, when they built plants here in America they do it as a loss to save face.<br>  <br>  Why? because America is on a come back and Japan can no longer keep up building and selling cars/trucks sold here in the US paying labor.<br>  <br>  This is why America lost ground, our unions are killing the American auto company, the 1920s are over we don't need unions anymore.<br>  <br>  Invest in an American company, invest in America buy American cars.<br>  <br>  I would hate to depend on Japan or any other over seas factory to build trucks for our troops.<br>  |`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	I like my Chevy Aveo, Jerry, and I think MOST of it was made in the USA.

Back in the 1970's the US automakers were making horrible cars that no one wanted and eventually Chrysler needed to get a government loan to keep from going under (and under Iaccoca they paid it back early).  Now it is happening again because the car makers just won't change with the times.  Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that the current CEO's have any ability to turn things around, so a bailout would probably be a total loss unlike with Chrysler in the 80's.  They need to get fresh blood and ideas in those companies or they are doomed.<br>  <br>  PS - stop blaming the people of the US.

Granted, of all those, there are only two foreign made cars, but in comparing them to the others I have to say the US-made vehicles are just as good as the others. I LOVE my Passat, but it's a 2002 model; I don't like the newer ones styling as much. German-vehicles seem to have smaller controls (at least our VW does) than American-made vehicles. American vehicles seem slightly... cushy, with big buttons and some "clunky" mechanisms.  That being said, however, when we purchase a new car (not lease) in a few more years, we're already planning to buy one from a US-owned company, preferably a vehicle with a high percentage of US-made parts (yeah, I know, good luck). We thoroughly investigate all our purchases and our next car will be no different.<br>  |`|d937aff3a2e8203ec212c1f181e66e05aa	I have had many GM cars in my life and have driven 500K miles with the 4 cars I had the longest (Cavalier, Lumina, Regal and Colbalt). The ONLY mechanical problems I had were on the Regal after I hit the 147K mile mark (fuel pump, fuel pump relay and ABS module in rear brake hub). All told, these repairs cost me around $2000 to fix. The one Ford I had did not have any issues. American cars have just as good quality as the foreign brands, it is just the perception of the consumer is hard to change. Yes, the Big 3 did not build the best quality back in the 70s and early 80s, but have made great strides to correct this and they sure have better looking designs than Toyota, Honda et. al. Lexus looks like Mercedes and BMW, Toyota and Honda are bland, Hyundai and Kia are not sexy at all. Take a look at the 2008 Cadillac CTS, Saturn Aura, Mustang, even the Chrysler 300 still looks good.|`|RjUhISEIaa	This answer may anger so folks but we have only ourselves to blame and by this I mean us as purchasers and the big 3 in what they've produced.<br>  <br>  The big three gave rise to two issues. First that they thought bigger is better. Take a look at Fords lineup. How many SUVs do they really need to build? Yes, we were in that market for some time but they were not quick to change when the gas prices went up. Why? And why come out with a new one when gas was almost at it's peak? Doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Add to this that the big 3 still are allowing the unions to control what the workers get paid. Foreign manufacturers who have plants int he country have kept the unions out. This means lower pay but good benefits for the the workers yet lower prices on their vehicles. A great example of this is Hyundai who is building a quality vehicle with an excellent warranty that in reality transformed the warranties offered by the big 3 and other foreign manufacturers. To this individual while there was a time for unions in our country they now are doing us more harm than good by driving up the prices on what we manufacture.<br>  <br>  The big 3 need to redefine how they do business or face having to shut their doors and have millions laid off. To have the US Congress provide them with 25 billion may/may not be the answer. This poster does not want to see a single American manufacturer go out of business in our current economic state but you and I cannot hold out our hand and get a bailout, right? If we are faced with it we would have to declare bankruptcy and either restructure our debt and move forward or get it all written off by shutting our doors, selling thru the courts what we own and paying the debtors pennies on the dollar. AND the workers for the big 3 come are not guaranteed to get a single cent of salaries owed, compensation for unused vacation, etc until the guaranteed debtors are satisfied...meaning they are screwed and receive nothing.<br>  <br>  Our vehicles are just as good. The pricing is becoming better but still not there yet. We just need to review what the market wants and wake up and give it to the people or face losing 1, 2 or all three of our vehicle manufacturers and putting millions onto the unemployment lists.|`|CoCn3GbOaa	The domestic Trucks are the best, especially the GMC Sierra and F-150.

The only reason you would need to have one re sleeved is if it is cracked, other wise just replace the pistion rings. If your not getting enough compression you may have a blown head gasket.

On all matting you activate the adhesive with a heat gun. The 80 not so flexible, therefore a good candidate for floorboards firewalls and large flat surfaces. The thinner can be molded and handle easier after heating.<br>  <br>  Also if you apply the think materials behind plastic panels the may not fit after application. Screws may not be long enough and the plastic panels clips will pull themselves apart in time.|`|PIuEcCRPaa	you want to use 80 as much as possible but if your trunk has a lot of curves and corners only use 80 on the floor and use 50 which is thinner to curve around the sides and stuff like that.
7bf29965ca07a3a325e65f762653f5b0aa	Check your oil using the dip stick after you run the vehicle.  During this check you want to see churned and heated oil to inspect its color only. If the oil is milky like chocolate milk colored THEN you have substantial water to be worried about.    What you are seeing is most likely simple condensation, with very little actual volume of water as long as the oil is not milky colored.    I have seen plenty of water(I should say condensation) in an engine. Usually when ever we start running a new truck(new used) during the first splash down, that little bit of water will condensate and usually escape up through the distributor shaft. And will kill the spark in the engine until that condensation is cleaned out of the distributor. In my opinion it is nothing to worry about, just do an oil change.    However, if the oil is milky and white colored(not yellow/clear) at allthere is substantial water in the oil. It either got there from submerging the engine or fluid incursion from the cooling system because of a blown head gasket or cracked block. Hopefully you just have a little condensation from atmospheric humidity.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s normal on cold days to have some moisture around the cap. you might want to check the pcv valve to see if it,s working.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	It's time to clean or replace your PCV valve, throttle body and idle air control valve. A little moisture in damp climates is normal. Too much will goo up your oil.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Excessive moisture might indicate a restricted PCV system, but some moisture, only on the filler cap, is pretty much normal depending on the weather conditions and drive cycles.|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	that's hard to say it could be a cracked block or it could be a bad seal on the dip stick if ur getting close to needing a oil change i would drain it & check it that way if u see a lot of water in the oil then i would guess a cracked block|`|HUluAQM3aa	Some moisture is normal when we think about the Internal workings of the engine and the change in temperature that occurs.|`|c48nm70gaa	The oil fill cap and tube is the coldest place in an engine all the time. If the thermostat isn't operating at it's rated capacity and you do a lot of short stop and go trips the crankcase oil can't get hot enough to drive off condensation. A properly working PVC system helps but it's not the total eliminating answer to moisture under the oil filler cap. Shorten up your oil changes and make sure your thermostat's getting the motor up to it's maximum temperature.|`|H8sqQxBbaa	It's probably just dew.    However, just to be safe.  Check your coolant (let it cool first of course).  If it is a brownish green color then your head is cracked, guaranteed.  If your coolant color is normal then check to see if the moisture on your cap has a white film/foam around it.  If it does then your oil and coolant are mixing a different way, in which you still have a cracked head.     If neither of these are the case then your truck is probably fine.|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	that is condensation due to the outside cooler then the inside because there is no vapor barrier. It is either because the gasket is leaking, or not secured to the valve cover properly.  It should be a tight seal anyway for order for smog system to work properly.  The older cars have a PVC that often gets worn out and has to be replaced.   I would keep an eye on it in the future to assure your head is not leaking coolant into the cylinder head.   You can verify the water by lighting a match to it and it will boil if you have coolant leaking.
TdrgZwnoaa	You are clearly full of the milk of human kindness. Unfortunately your actions could get someone seriously injured or killed. Stopping with the right of way and a line of cars behind you is begging for an accident. <br>   Case in point - there was an accident here a few years back where two person died. A bus driver did what you propose. A vehicle behind the bus passed said bus and caused the car turning left up onto the pedestrian sidewalk hitting a group of people in the process. One gentleman died from blunt force trauma and a lady died as a result of striking her head on the sidewalk.<br>   Our defensive driving course instucts us to never do what you propose in heavy traffic. And if traffic is that heavy the other driver should turn right, go around the block and cross at a traffic signal rather than hold up traffic in their lane.|`|AA12103453	Sorry but if you have a line of cars behind you then you SHOULDN'T do it. If you are alone on the street then by all means let as many cars go through as you want. If there is a turn lane for the other car then they wouldn't hold up any traffic, if there isn't then people have a habit of going around the car on the right if there is enough room. Yeah it sucks to be the driver trying to turn and not being able to, but that's why you should avoid left turns if possible. If you have to turn left you should try to do it at a light.|`|2e4136dce9654275a96b53a0c5bb55ffaa	What you are doing is highly dangerous. Tough luck for the guy who has to wait to make his turn. That's the way life is.<br>  <br>  One of these days when you stop to allow someone to make a left-hand turn, a vehicle is going to pass you on the right and clock the poor fool who tries to make that turn.<br>  <br>  We have right-of-way laws for a reason. This is one of them.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Too dangerous and by doing this you are assuming the position of a traffic controller and if anything would happen you would be responsible for the accident and or worse.<br>  <br>  This was explained to me many years ago by a police officer..|`|qDQ5uLrSaa	Hi, Whilst it is courteous to let someone in/out/turn across you, you should be careful not to signal that the way is clear, if there are two lanes or more, someone may come up the side of you and hit the car that thought it was clear to turn. this would legally be the other drivers fault for not checking, put you would have caused the accident.<br>  <br>  I would also consider if you are causing an obstruction by doing this too.<br>  if you are in slow moving traffic and you allow someone to cross by not moving off yourself, that  shouldn't cause a problem, however if you are driving along a 30mph with a row of traffic behind you and you slam on the brakes to let someone out, you could end up being shunted.<br>  <br>  In short, decide if it is appropriate to stop, and allow the other driver to make the decision to turn rather than flashing your lights or gesturing them across.<br>  <br>  courtesy on the road is a good thing, if people were always courteous and made allowances for each other, the roads would be a lot friendlier place.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Danny
Q4O1v13Qaa	The rotor is supposed to go on in one certain direction only. (supposed to be foolproof in fact) If you got it to go on 180 off from each other the 2 different times, you must have mashed the heck out of it, or it was off kilter (not fitting flush) one of those times. So take it off, and look closely at the bottom of the rotor and the part where it bolts on to, and make sure it's on right. The rotor has a notch in the one side, that corresponds with a tab on the mounting area. It's almost certainly not the main problem, but it's a problem that should be addressed. The guy who mentioned marking the rotor was talking about it's relationship to the distributor body and/or the distributor's position in the engine.    In order to make sure the distributor is timed properly, you will have to disconnect the power lead for the distributor, remove the  1 spark plug, and have someone crank the engine over for you (or use a remote starter switch) until the timing mark lines up with 0, while at the same time, with your finger over the spark plug hole, you feel air pushing your finger off the hole. This will insure you are at Top Dead Center on cylinder  1. Then check the position of the rotor tip in relation to the  1 terminal on the distributor cap (also notched, to go on only one way). If it's not far off, you might be able to turn the distributor, but otherwise you will have to take it back out and reset it. Keep in mind that the rotor will turn as the distributor drops in the last little bit, so you need to compensate for that. If it won't go all the way down, bump the motor over a little with the starter (with key or remote) while gently pushing down on the outter shell of the distributor, so it will plop in the rest of the way. If it still won't start, (after tightening the hold down, putting the cap back on, and plugging the power feed back in) there's something wrong with the distributor, or some other part of the engine. Start with spark and fuel checks, and if those look OK, check the Timing Chain.  http://www.misterfixit.com/chanslop.htm    BTW, why did you think it needed a new distributor in the first place?    Additional Details  Bummer! You could have gotten a new vacuum canister for like $15-$20?, and installed it in 5 minutes without even taking the Distributor out.|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi you can IM me and I`ll talk you through it. Click on my avatar. I need more info|`|64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	Sounds like the distributor is out of time, likely 180 out.  Just moving the rotor does not matter if the distributor gear is out of time with the camshaft.  If the motor was turned over with the distributor out, you'll have to start from scratch.  Bring the  1 cylinder to TDC, align the timing marks and install the distributor with its rotor pointing to the number one spark plug cable in the distributor cap.|`|7274403b2b4f83ec6c150a8f7b80a02aaa	Was the problem there before you worked on it? Perhaps the timing chain is bad.|`|57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	May be off a tooth. Get a timing light and see where the  1 plug is firing. Did you carefully mark the location of the rotor on a fixed location so it is pointing exactly at this mark with the new distributor?
TdrgZwnoaa	It's not impossible at all. Which one do you prefer.      The one that is too heavy to be responsive in the air.    OR    The one that is so light that you can't drive over bumps without it folding up on itself.    ...............................YOU CHOOSE.......................|`|XLXncQu9aa	I believe that the technology is there just like you said.  The only reason why they haven't been made or sold on the market are for two reasons.  The first reason is because of money.  It costs a lot of money to have that technology made available and created into a hover craft of flying car.  Also that would mean the government would have to lend a lot of money out which is not what is needed at the moment due to our economic status.  Secondly, there is no need for flying cars.  The way our society works doesn't constitute for flying cars mainly because we the money being made are still used on carbon fuels and gasoline.  So as it stands we aren't in need of flying cars.  Regular cars have not yet been outdated.  Many thought by the year 2000 it would have happened, but it hasn't.  Its not that its not possible, but funds are need which we don't have, and the fact that cars are still the primary source of transportation are the main factors into why it hasn't happened.|`|FxAD44Moaa	but we already did?    it's called a private jet. (for the rich folks...)  (private plane)   the  cessna.....

No, I'm not talking about the cars that look like planes. Those are pointless...    I'm not even going to get into the possibility of accidents, poor drivers, etc. It would not be very good to have humans manually flying such vehicles. They would need to be on autopilot.|`|c6702586c95b5021c90acb04c379882daa	What you post is partially true. But think about the enormous amount of fuel and engine power it takes for a plane to take off, fly, and land.    Technology is close to replicating this on a smaller scale but not enough to be able to commercialize it, just yet.    We may or may never get there. Remember that everything revolves around money and politics. If it was that easy, we would already have electric cars, electric planes, etc.|`|1NWjta2jaa	The technology is here and some people actually made working flying cars. The problem is logistical. How do you control and organize millions and millions cars flying all over the place?|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Impossible? NO.  Impractical? YES.

It's just not release to the wide public due to safety reasons, air traffic control, large enough roads to accommodate the wings, etc.     when they come up with smell-o-vision, now that's something to talk about!|`|6xyeYjkkaa	It's not only possible but some were built, by individuals and on an experimental basis after WWII. However getting one that will meet all the flight safety requirements and the auto safety and smog requirements at a cost that would make it worth while manufacturing is a stretch. It has to be a reasonable enough price that it could be mass produced to sell to most anyone. And then how are you going to insure it? I can just see the insurance companies thinking about what would happen if one clown broadsided the other and they crashed into a house or shopping mall. No one would want to insure against that risk.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	Why do we keep asking this question? I think this is kind of  like asking...is it impossible to make a boat that can be used on streets, not water?    We also have the technology to make a piece of metal takeoff and start flying, you know? If we made a flying car, it would have to look like an airplane or some other aircraft in order for it to fly.    And how would flying work for some regular guy? You're going to get in your Gulfstream just to go half a block to get some food at your favorite fast food fly-through? Flying isn't needed most of the time.    Everything weed need to travel easily is already here.    Want to go down the block to the market? Walk.  Need to go 15 miles to get to work? Drive.  Need to go from New York to Paris? Take a Jet.|`|AA12339318	It doesn't matter what I "believe."  The fact is that there have been many "flying cars" invented over the years.    But the practicality of the devices proves to be more of a challenge.    Smaller?  There are some VERY small airplanes in the air.  Some smaller than MOST cars.  Even the wings on some of these "ultralights" aren't much wider than a Humvee.    I think that it is YOU who haven't been keeping up with the technology.
dsODBNXFaa	Well, you can swap Honda clusters obviously.  All you need is the wiring diagram for the Civic and for the BB6 cluster and just wire it together.  But, make sure every wire is covered somewhere between the new cluster and old harness.  I am thinking of doing this to my CD7 accord.  Great looking cluster at night.  Good luck bro!
jO7EiSmeaa	You are probably getting "full replacement cost on contents", which is technically an endorsement on most policies.  Unless endorsed, you would get ACV or Actual Cash Value for your property in the event of a loss.  Or, if you schedule jewelry, guns or other those are also endorsements to the policy.
TbiSBXclaa	Depends on the year and which engine for the Benz.  Some of them are really prone to breaking down and when they do it's a small fortune to fix it.  Old Merceseds aren't known for their reliability.    I would avoid a Sonata unless it's the new body style.    Basically you need to determine which car is in better condition to know which one is the better car to own.|`|AA10724010	I'd go with the Sonata since it is the most reliable and has the fewest miles, the Taurus isn't a bad option either if it has a V6 engine.  That Mercedes must be really old or have something wrong with it to be selling for only $2000, probably needs thousands of dollars worth of repairs/maintenance.|`|c6702586c95b5021c90acb04c379882daa	Never buy Ford unless you're buying a truck. The compact car engines are worthless. Both in re-sale prices and engine quality.    Depending on the kind of Benz you're buying, it could be way too expensive to maintain. For a Benz, definitely make sure you have all the books and records. If everything looks in order, it probably could be a wise investment. Although the repair prices on these high end models is not cheap.    Hyundai, don't buy one unless it's new and comes with their 10 yr warranty. My in-laws being the cheap people they are purchased a Hyundai with about the same mileage. The car ran great for the first month and then it was all downhill from there. I believe the car stays in the shop at least once every two weeks. Trust me on this one.

The sooner we notice small cuts on our skin, the sooner we can treat them to guard against infection. Similarly, bees are yellow to warn potential predators that they are poisonous. We have been taught to use caution near brightly colored insects, reptiles and amphibians. The choice of green is more arbitrary. It is certainly a friendly color in our evolutionary minds because it is symbolic of plant life, on which humans rely for survival. We have been conditioned to seek it out. Alternatively, maybe it's just because "green" and "go" both start with the letter G. Your guess is as good as mine...|`|JyOUODDXaa	Just the way it is, and I wouldn't advise going against it.

It has a whopping 478kW of power (650 horsepower), and was limited to only 20 cars. It is also the meanest looking, and most expensive - estimates at the undisclosed price tag of the Reventon are usually around 2 million dollars. Youch.<br>  <br>  But if you want the best lamborghini you can actually buy, it'd have to be the Murcielago LP640 - it has 471kW (640 horsepower), so it's not far off the Reventon. Although the design of it is 6 or 7 years old now, and nowhere near as good looking as either the Reventon or the Baby Lambo - the Gallardo.<br>  <br>  Yes the Gallardo looks better than the Murcielago - but the Murcielago is bigger, meaner, and faster.

If he is here as a resident then the same applies but he may exchange it for an U.K licence  In both cases valid until he is 70.    When he Applied for his U.K licence he should have surrendered his Greek one  Easiest solution would be to surrender the Greek one as he is not allowed both.

EWzEgEDPaa	Let me clarify and correct what has already been posted and answer your question. The C-6 trans was available in various bellhousing configurations. The one in particular you need fits the 4.9L 6 cylinder and the 5.0l and 5.8l V-8s. They came in a long output shaft version for 2WD and a short output shaft for 4X4 applications. Your 1986 302 Bronco is equipped with the AOD most likely. Yes, the correct short shaft C-6 will fit, but the transfer case will not bolt up. The C-6 has a larger diameter output shaft than the AOD, so the transfer case would have to be changed. You will also need the shift linkage and the kickdown rod for the C-6, and run a vacuum line for the modulator. Since the 5.8L (351) was offered in a Bronco, you may be able to find what you need in a salvage yard. The F-150 4X4 with the correct engine/trans combination is the same as a source for your parts. The Full-size Bronco was never offered as a 2WD, so don't even consider any vehicle/trans that is for 2WD. With all that said, you're probably better off keeping the trans type you already have.|`|teAtI3Itaa	If you truck is 86 4X4, an automatic, it has a C6 in it.

Nothing really insurmountable.|`|0plFo5A1aa	probably. if it fits a 302 it will fit the bronco
c0a6f2352a51ac4457b597bf96be168caa	JUST FYI- They make 6x9s in both kappa and type R, so if your vehicle is designed for 6x9s, don't settle for 5x7s.<br>  <br>  I personally prefer the Kappa's but there is something you need to understand.  6x9 speakers arn't designed to be a full range, front stage speaker. They are designed specifically for "rear fill", meaning that they arn't actually meant to be listened to, only slightly heard.  What you will find is that the higher up you go, the more and more you will notice 6x9s that sound sort of "muffled", and not quite as bright as a comparable 6.5" set.<br>  <br>  With that said, if you are going to be using the speakers for full range front fill, I would go with the type r's, simply because they sound a little more natural than the kappas.  If you are going to be using them in the rear of the vehicle, however, use the Kappas.  They perform wonderfully as rear fill speakers.  The type r's almost have too much direction to work as good rear speakers.<br>  <br>  The power difference is hardly noticable.  Although the Kappa advertise 2ohms, the nominal is actually closer to 3ohms, and most alpines test closer to 3.4ohms, so you shouldn't see any huge difference.  Normally a higher impedance speaker is a better alternative, but when it comes to speakers as heavy as car audio speakers, the difference isn't noticable to most ears.|`|vtfgeCsXaa	Dude, def. the Alpines.  I have heard terrible things about the newer kappas.  I have also owned a pair of type r 6.5 coaxials and they sounded better than my $300 pair of Focal coaxials.<br>  Go for Alpine.<br>  Hope this helped.

oGqMC4Eyaa	The Infinity Perfect 6.1's are 4 ohms and 100 RMS per channel.  The Rockford Amp gives off 100 RMS per channel at 4 ohms which is perfect for your speakers it will be hard to blow them b/c they are not overpowered.  The Kicker gives 175 RMS per channel at 4 ohms.  If you dont crank the speakers you won't blow them but the risk is still there due to over powering.  Your spending extra $$$ for power you can't use and that may damage your speakers.

The factory cats are pretty restrictive.

Catback and long tube headers will get you where you want, but it'll probably set you over 1k.  Get the catback first and see if you want it louder, also that'll allow you more money to save up for more to get the headers.

Here's an example for you and there are other styles if you do your homework. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gangsterchoppers.com/catalog/Parts-Components/Builders-Section/Gas-Sight-Gauge-Kit" rel="nofollow">http://www.gangsterchoppers.com/catalog/...</a><br>  <br>  Get the idea ?|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	Your bike will quickly show it's limitations if you take in on a trip that requires fuel stops.  These bikes are great for in town and short road trips but if you start having 500 mile days or better it will quickly suck the big one!!  Also Bart is right about the trip meter thing too.

sCqdisvnaa	There are several 3-series BMW's running around with LS1 motors in them.  I've never heard of a 8-series with one, though.  There just aren't that many 8-series cars out there for this to be common.  I suspect that you're on your own with this one.  Good luck (you're going to need it; the 8-series is a fiendishly complicated car)|`|cn0ALwwLaa	I hope you are starting out with an 8-series that has been beat on so much, it will not be missed by turning it into a project.<br>  <br>  You will need to put the speedo and drivetrain in the 8-series as well.<br>  <br>  The cars do have similar proofiles, but a lot of things will need to be 100% custom. <br>  <br>  Got time and money?

RXMHqNhsaa	First of all to the guy above - the WRX STi is an Impreza.<br>  <br>  Right, well I've compiled a list:<br>  <br>  Volkswagen Golf R32 (if you can still get your hands on one - they're in run out)<br>  Renault Megane Sport 225 (again, depending where you are in the world, it could already be unavailable)<br>  Nissan 350Z/370Z (I know it's a coupe, but still)<br>  Mazda RX-8<br>  Mazda3 MPS<br>  <br>  But you're right, with the exception of the Nissans, which aren't as practical anyway, there really is no "price to performance" formula that matches them.<br>  <br>  Unless of course, you live in Australia, like I do, where you can get locally made V8 supersedans from Holden and Ford that are faster than Imprezas and Evos, and more practical for a family (though thirsty on fuel...!).|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	How about the Vauxhall VXR8?|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	The Impreza is a nice choice. But I am not so keen on the EVO.<br>  Another one to think about is a Mazda Speed 3.<br>  I think for the investment it is a better buy and only a few horses short on power. But because it is FWD only, it should out pull the WRX version.<br>  Another one to think about is the good old Mustang.<br>  If you are willing to pay for all that maintenance and increased costs of the EVO (cost of ownership for 5 years estimate of almost 64000), then (IMHO) the RX8 is another to think about.|`|sDVL420taa	Well the Lancer Evolution and standard Impreza are on two completely different levels.

g4vPxFCbaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

The Supra has higher performance but the Celica is not a tortoise either.|`|ccvxxnScaa	you cant even compare the 2, Supras are 6 cyl, Celicas are 4.

Up shifting will be fine.|`|EmgiGg17aa	simply no.  VW came out with auto stickshift.  Which meant you shift into 1 and drove it and when the engine speed reached a certain level, you let off the gas and shifted into 2 and applied gas.  The difference  between auto shift and manual shift was that a clutch pedal was missing.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	if you can't drive a standard vehicle, don't mess with the automatic's option to shift. really, BAD idea. you could totally kill your car|`|AA11275863	You could if you aren't careful.
RXMHqNhsaa	No, because firstly, a Toyota Camry is not a luxury car. It is a practical, average car in western countries, and is used frequently by fleet buyers for its acceptable economy, durability and reliability (Camrys just DON'T break down).<br>  <br>  A Ferrari is a sports car, with limited space for passengers (due to only two doors), disastrous economy, and a reliability record that is light-years behind the Camry. They are sports cars, and not practical or usable enough to become a taxi.<br>  <br>  And just one final point: If Ferraris were going to become taxis, they would have done so by now - Ferrari has been around longer than even Toyota.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Absolutely no chance.|`|2l2Rr8Mfaa	There is a huge difference between a luxury car (Camry) & a high performance sports car (Ferrari) therefore my answer would be NO. Luggage storage would be a problem as would any child seat, let alone only having room for one passenger. Camry's are fairly economical, Ferrari's are not.|`|q8NCrzjnaa	Very unlikely.  The reason for this is that a Taxi or "Hackney Carriage" has to fit certain critera laid down by the local licensing authority.<br>  <br>  For a Hackney, these conditions will be 4 doors and ample luggage space.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that if Mrs Smith books a Taxi from the supermarket to get here and shopping hime, and a Ferrari turns up, then it wont be fit for purpose.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a Ferrari can be licensed as a "Private Hire" vehicle, and can be bbooked for events such as school proms and the like.<br>  <br>  To be licensed as a private hire vehcile, the owner / operator would still have to appear before a licensing panel to explain why the vehcile should be licensed when it doesn't meet the criteria set down by the licensing authority.<br>  <br>  This would be overcome by explaining that people would be booking the ferrari, knowing that it only had two doors, etc etc.|`|mmavy34kaa	Er...is it just me, or are you comparing a Toyota Camry to a Ferrari?

L0gAD5BHaa	Hey.<br>  If you're still experiencing the same problem after putting a new exhaust on it, then you're either not getting enough air, fuel or spark.<br>  It'll be cheaper to take it to a mechanic to take a peak at it then it would be to start randomly swapping parts.<br>  One thing I have seen that can cause that problem is when the spark plug wires are hooked up wrong. Two switched wires can cause exactly what you're experiencing. Check where spark plug #1 hooks to your distributor, then make sure they're in the right order (1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2 counter clockwise I believe) If they're hooked up fine, it's mechanic time!<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10331789	The engine needs to breath fresh air in and exhaust the burned fuel mixture out the exhaust. I'm sure you've got a good air filter and you've made sure the exhaust backpressure is normal by installing a new exhaust. Make sure all the exhaust components were installed correctly and not inadvertently reversed as to the direction of flow. You could measure the exhaust backpressure as below.  Next, I'd ask whether the fuel pressure reads correctly by hooking a fuel pressure gauge to the engine and taping it to the bottom of the windshield so a passenger could watch the fuel pressure as you drive. Also check the fuel volume.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aa1car.com/library/fuel_pump_diagnose.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa1car.com/library/fuel_pump_...</a><br>  <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3828/is_199807/ai_n8795921" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa...</a>|`|2l2Rr8Mfaa	Did your car have the problem before you replaced the exhaust? If it was fine before the exhaust went on, put the old exhaust back on. If it had the problem before you put the exhaust on, you would be pretty safe in thinking its something other than the exhaust causing the problem. Take your car to a reputable mechanic for a diagnosis.

If you have a particular question about a specific model ask it. If you have no questions don't worry about it at all, tell them thanks for asking when they do (and they will) and ask if any come up. <br>  <br>  We as owners of a Chaparral work the show for our dealer. We actually spend more time BS'ing with those on the boats than we do answering questions. And you know what? Those looking are more appreciative of our being there and just talking to them than trying to sell them. End result...they usually end up buying one. Win for them. Win for the dealer. Win for us as our slip rate hasn't gone up in 5 years!<br>  <br>  Enjoy the show!!!|`|AA10255553	First, wear white soled boating shoes when you go so you can board the boats at the show and not scuff the decks. Don't wear one of those tourist captain's hats. Figure out what kind of boating you like: sail or motor, lakes, bays or offshore, fishing or cruising. Start looking at magazines in the libary in your area of interest.
