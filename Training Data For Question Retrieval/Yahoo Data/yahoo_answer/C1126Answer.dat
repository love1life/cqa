3801WCKjaa	ur hair is dead because u straighten it so much, what i suggest is putting olive oil in ur hair, leave it in for a few minutes b4 u take a shower, and then after just wash ur hair normally, or u can do the same thing but with avocado, mush up the avocado like ur making guacamole put put it in ur hair and wait 10 min, and take a shower normally. and also try a new hairstyle that doesnt involve to many products or styling with hot irons|`|D0E3csbKaa	at night put olive oil on your hair cocnut oil works really good too<br>  but I'm guessing you have olive oil at home.

4UXJoMbKaa	Yes, it will. Water will keep your skin healthy and moisturized from the inside, so your skin won't have to overcompensate from the outside. Don't expect it to get rid of all your oil, but it will definitely help quite a bit. Also, eating plenty of fruits will help cut oil production. Make sure you're using a light, oil free moisturizer as well. Moisturizing keeps your skin from producing excess oil. I like Clean&Clear Dual Action moisturizer.|`|e0848503e661b7bce4423b6ccc3b1360aa	yes it helps also using a good cleanser and scrub will help <br>  I have and avon store that is totally awesome and the prices are wonderful!!

Use an oil free face wash, and an oil free moistirizer.  I like the one from Aveeno.|`|TZBrjuwkaa	not necessary but it can help but the best way i know is to get a good facial cleanser and use it day and night|`|YwHl37Hgaa	It is sure to help. An oily skin , as the name implies, is one in which the sebaceous or oil-producing glands are over active. As surface grease tends to attract dirt, an oily skin acquires a dirty surface film , that needs to be removed daily.

I would think that getting your conch pierced would be similar.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	It hurt pretty bad, but the worst part to me was the barbell going through after the initial piercing with the needle. The threading on the end of the post going through that new fresh meat hurts like hell. It heals/stops hurting within like 5 weeks though.

1xwyCxdUaa	The belly piercing could get infected if you touch it a lot without washing your hands first.  <br>  <br>  Your clothes will also rub on it, making it irritated and open to infection.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to just clean it twice a day, do a sea salt soak once a day, and always wash your hands before cleaning it.  Don't touch it, play with it or move the jewelry unnecessarily.<br>  <br>  Once it has healed completely, there's not a huge risk of infection.|`|CvEERKQuaa	its in a place where a lot of bacteria gather ,and animals and worktops are near it ,they carry germs and bacteria which can enter your peicing ,whcih is still an open wound till it heals.|`|kN5xtzq7aa	Since it is a scar that is (usually) inverted, dirt and bacteria gets caught in there. This gets into the piercing, causing it to become infected. <br>  Other than that, your clothes create constant irritation on the area, opening the wound and making it more likely to get infected.|`|7Svg4ySJaa	By not cleaning it or not washing your hands if you touch it.<br>  Also don't play with it. It's tempting but don't touch it unless you need to clean it. Also if it's not clean where you go to get it pierced.<br>  I just cleaned mine twice a day with salt water. If you have any problems see the piercer for advice|`|flgSIFNhaa	There are many ways it could get infected, not being clean enough, being rubbed against clothing or playing with it. Just be sure to wash it everyday if you haven't had yours very long and a saline solution helps out too.|`|AA10711210	By a germ getting into the wound from the needle, the stud, the operator's fingers, the air, your fingers, clothing near the wound and a few other things.

TjPwxbuJaa	It depends how long you've been wearing 1/2 inch and how loose they are. If you can get the 5/8 inch in without too much pain, then it shouldn't be a problem. However, I always think that smaller increments are better.<br>  A 5/8 inch plug is 1/8 inch bigger in diameter than a 1/2 inch plug. That's more than 3mm, and the circumference is about 10mm bigger, or more than 3/8 of an inch. That's a lot to expect the skin to stretch all at once.|`|xK5mxlmnaa	That's exactly what I did about two months ago. It does kinda depends on how well your ears usually stretch.

You need to actually use a scar minimizer like this stuff called Mederma.  It is made to fade away scars and that stuff takes months of using day and night.

FHLL2vIlaa	I don't know what type of earrings you're wearing , but usually the first few times and scarey, it's all new. I suggest studs, hypo-allergenic for a few more weeks, no need to take them out just turn and apply alcohol to site before turning.

Always keep a pair of piercing studs because they have the point and will be able to poke the hole more easily than regular earrings.

Pa4uek59aa	Buy (at your local store) a facial cleanser that you can use in the shower, and then get some cleansing pads (also at your local store, many bands sell them) and then something called a "vanishing acne cream," there are also some called, "tinted acne cream." Anyway, they are very reasonable, and if you have tried everything, and nothing works, somtimes thats just the way it is, and unfortunately, sometimes there is nothing you can do about it- but-----------before you go that far, just simply make sure your face is clean! <br>  ***Also- if you put a lot of oils (lotions, etc.,) they can make you have more breakouts!

I would suggest to stop using neutrogena (sometimes, when i use it, it would dry out my skin and it would take days to regain it again).  <br>  <br>  I don't really like to use any types of acne medications unless it's serious.  Washing your face with water is usually the best way to go because water doesn't contain any chemicals.  But our skin types are all different.<br>  <br>  I would reccomend using toner, to take away the oilyness from your skin.  I would let the pimples run it's course, possibly stop using Neutrogena if it really irritates your skin badly.  Maybe try Maybelline Concealer or any type of Concealer (can be purchased at Victoria's Secret, Rite Aid, CVS, Duane Reade, etc.) that will cover up your pimples and heal them at the same time (it could be good use for the pimples underneath your skin too).  Do not pop your pimple!  Infection could occur and it might spread into other areas.  Just let it run it's course and maybe one day after your shower or when you wake up, it will be gone.  Pimples aren't a shame, everyone gets them from time to time.<br>  <br>  If you insist on using acne medication, try Proactiv.  You can get the 30-day trial and test it out.  If it works, then you can buy it at proactiv.com or order it at 1-800-730-0500, absolutely toll-free, 24/7.  You can also see a dermatologist to provide you with information you might need about your skintypes and what your skin might need.<br>  <br>  Also, exofoliants are great for your skin because they remove dead skin cells and often make your skin nice and smooth if you don't use them too often.  You can try H2O or St. Ive's Apricot Scrub for Blemish and Blackhead Control.  <br>  <br>  I hoped that helped!  And good luck(=|`|dNEADrY9aa	Get something to wash your face every morning with for oily skin, to rid your skin of the gunk clogging up your pores.<br>  <br>  About every three days use something that exfoliates, to rub out dead skin. <br>  <br>  Don't use facial lotion, ever. That's for really dry skin.<br>  <br>  You may want to see a dermatologist, if this bothers you a lot. They are paid just to know what works well on different skin types to make them healthy and clear. They can prescribe really strong washes and even medication.|`|w0rXQ4Dgaa	Well, proactiv does not work. It will keep pimples, zits, blackheads, etc. at bay for a while but the acne will eventually come back. Neutrogena isn't really much better...<br>  Solution - I have always had skin problems and my doctor recommended that I go see a dermatologist. His name is Doctor Daniel Chang and his office is in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.<br>  He prescribed tretinoin 0.25%<br>  it works !<br>  ~Hope I helped~|`|EItXIEc3aa	I used to get really bad pimples and i had no idea how to get rid of them! But then i went online to Neutrogena.com. They have this test you can take that evaluates your skin type and what products would be good for you. I took it, and it really helped me find what i was looking for and helped me get rid of my acne! The link for the test is below if you want to take it, and it's completely free. <br>  (although it's a good idea to look up reviews for the products the test matches you, with just to make sure they're worth it.)  <br>  And if Neutrogena products in general don't really work for you, then i'd try Clean and Clear. They've also got some great skin care stuff.<br>  Hope this helps you! (:|`|xt1MvFLiaa	Go to a dermatologist or a doctor to get Finacea prescribed to you. IT works really well. I used to have horrible acne, but I have it under control now with Finacea. It's one of the best topicals out there for acne.

Does it hold any personal values with you or is it coz it's fashionable right now same as chinese writing was in the 90's?<br>  Secondly, 'you want to get something like wisdom or something spiritual'? I think you should think a little longer and find something that means something personal to you.<br>  Thirdly, you shouldn't be getting a real tattoo if you are gonna rely on the tattoo parlour catalogue.  <br>  Maybe go and find someone who speaks arabic and get them to write a few words for you. Then start drawing it on yourself to see if you like it first. <br>  Just remember that old cliche, tattoo's are forever (unless you go for laser removal).

DO NOT WEAR IT!**<br>  because one day you have a 'flat butt',<br>  then the next day it's all big and different<br>  then you forget to wear it,<br>  and it's flat again.<br>  that's weird and people will be like,  ???<br>  <br>  there's exercises to tone and lift!!!!!!<br>  <br>  it's a really bad idea.<br>  maybe you should talk to your mom or best friend.|`|iXMHf5zwaa	yes they make you look bigger.<br>  WEAR THEM IF YOU ARE GOING CLUBBING!<br>  To school or work, people will notice the size of your butt changes and that is not sexy at all!|`|AZRj3vaLaa	yea i have seen them at a local store where i live...they are like buying padded bras or silicone boobs..no big deal for a event..just dont brush up against anyone and stay away from botty grabbers|`|7qNJg8DTaa	Yeah|`|zGtELDrnaa	i have no idea, but they would be good cushion|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Okay I'll give you a serious answer!<br>  <br>  So personally I think it's just one more thing to have to worry about.... we already wear makeup (fake), style our hair with irons and products (fake), wear padded bras (fake), etc, etc. I think if you really want a bigger butt than go for it, but realize that you're going to have to wear one pretty consistently or people will catch on and be like 'uhhh why is her butt huge some days and non existent other days?' much like wearing a padded bra everyday. And it would probably be kinda disappointing to a guy like thinking his girl has this great *** and then getting into bed with her and being like 'uhhh where did it go??' but if you really want it then go for it!|`|AQo9Zuwwaa	Wow...

They use silicone & latex to make up some body's body to either enhance or emulate someone and the actor does not fit the body part? For example. The movie Monster. with Charlize Theron? she was portraying a serial killer called Eileen Wornous. Well we all know what Charlize looks like and they made her up as Eileen who was heavy and rough looking. Believe me what they do in Hollywood is incredible? So some got the idea to make these silicone padded under garments! If you want to make your thighs or busts look fuller Go ahead and try them, But they are just as a fun enhancement! Nothing is better than what you have naturally! so in my opinion go and purchase them and have fun. But I hope you don't give someone the wrong impression of yourself while your wearing these fake prosthetics :) I would love to hear all about it if you choose to purchase these items! Then maybe you will allow me to laugh lol :) Kyle|`|46BXDvopaa	Don't be insulted from the mean answers because a lot of people on here are jerks. I never had padded underwear before but it should work good and when you get it and it does make your butt look bigger where a little bit larger pants or stick with just regular pads. maybe you should buy one pair and see how it is. Hope I helped!|`|mi6khKHIaa	honestly all i want to say is imagine you're on a  date or something and it gets to the point of you know, undressing..... what the hell happens then "Oh by the way i wear butt and hip enhancements" like imagine how awkward and embarrassing!!|`|cGKDJaqpaa	UNBUTTLIEVABLE!|`|AA11244888	Honestly.... I would be very upset if a date went real well, then one thing led to another, and find out the butt was not real. Just eat proper and exercise. lots of guys like small perky butts.|`|LWEn1p5raa	wow.<br>  i see your desperate for a new and 'bigger' butt.|`|ip0VuS3Daa	i think it's fine. just make sure it doesn't make your butt TOO big!
ss48BEk5aa	AHHH! Whatever you do, do not take it out! That is bad bad bad!!!! The infection will stay in your skin! You need  to get rid of the infection while the jewelry is still there. <br>  Sea salt does wonders for infections. Boil 1 cup of water and add 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt to it. Dip a clean wash cloth in it while its still hot (but bearable) and apply it to the affected area for 20 minutes, re-soaking the towel once it gets room temp. Do this 2-3 times a day. Worked great for my infected tattoo.|`|hwMP5n7Aaa	You need to take it out and let it heal. Make sure you're constantly cleaning it while its healing though. You can get it re-pierced after its fully healed. If your really set against taking it out, check back with the piercer first.|`|jNw8AUzUaa	dont take it out! the infection will get traped inside of the hole. it'll be worse. just start cleaning it more. if you want, go back to your piercing and see what they suggest. if they make you take it out then you will know better for next time.|`|q0XlILu4aa	That depends. Where is the piercing? How bad is the infection? How long have you had it?
hUsW2Iymaa	Loreal Sublime Glow.<br>  <br>  Ive been using this for about 2 years now. I put it on every night......doesnt make me orange! Doesnt clog my pores! Gives me awesome color, I get compliments frequently. Its also a moisturizer as well so its actually GOODD for your skin doesnt just change its color. Cost about 10 bucks for the good sized bottle.<br>  <br>  I suggest using the Medium Skin Tone lotion (also comes in fair)|`|Ch8Z9buGaa	Jergen's Natural Glow.<br>  <br>  looks like you came back from the beach :]
JTHCvRj7aa	sorry in advance for lengh of the novel ahead lol but you asked for everything you could get ....<br>  I can't tell you whether it's worth it or not that is something for you to decide before you go through with the piercing but I as a pierced female (tongue,belly,nose,ears, and side of lip) every one of my piercings was worth it, it shows a little about your personality.a belly piercing should cost you anywhere from 20-35 dollars anything more i'd find somewhere else to go. the piercing is very quick like 3-4 seconds, he will clean the area, clamp your belly button (which helps with the pain a little, it kind of numbs it), mark it with a dot and tell you to take a deep breath in and then it's over and in most cases people get themselves way too worked up for nothing and are actually kind of disappointed it didn't hurt more..the pain for me was like a quick sting nothing big at all like you got alcohol in a cut but it will be tender for a couple days after but more irritating than painful...aftercare DO NOT DO NOT use rubbing alcohol it does nothing for promoting the healing, all it does is dry it out and actually prolong the healing process which is usually about 6 weeks. I suggest using regular antibacterial soap and water and this stuff called bactine you can get it from walmart is has a slight numbing agent and it will make it heal up like miracle spray and the healing process will shorten..also if it does by chance get infected DO NOT take it out this poses the risk of the skin growing over the infected part and the infection getting into the blood stream it's best to leave it in and treat it as any other infection anything else just ask i hope i helped <3|`|z3uUtr33aa	hello, i got my belly button pierced and i promise you it was nothing. everyone says pain is different for everyone but this is just like the pain of an ear piercing, the needle goes in smoothly without feeling a thing! i was so shocked when it was over. i even got my bottom part of my belly button done. it looks like this:<a href="http://z.hubpages.com/u/94747_f248.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.hubpages.com/u/94747_f248.jpg</a><br>  <br>  mine cost 50 i think, my mom paid and i was too busy looking at it in the mirror haha. oh, and it takes like 10 seconds which is really short time! it's sooo worth it. i love mines to death! i cleaned it soo much because i didn't want it to get infected and end up having to take it out. <br>  <br>  <br>  that's all the information i think you should know but just in case here's a really helpful website that helped me a lot on information before i got mine pierced: <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/body-piercing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/body-pi...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Don't do it.  Spend the money on something else.  Ear piercing is nothing.  This is a big needle & they are tugging on your belly button when then are doing it.  YUK!|`|IHwMbLX5aa	I think its cute for young people. I think it cost around $80 in most places... but I live in Canada so it might be different.<br>  <br>  It does hurt! I would compare it to a paper cut... but more of a nagging pain until it heals. Just clean it with alcohol free anti-bacterial soap a few times a day and it should be fine. <br>  <br>  And it usually takes around 20 seconds because they do it with a needle... then put the barbell in. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|q0XlILu4aa	If you are in the U.S. you cannot legally get your belly button pierced until you are 16.|`|a5cBUpplaa	haha if you are scared to do it... it is obviously not worth it... yes it does hurt it IS a sharp Hollowed out NEEDLE going threw 2 thick layers of skin and in fact removing 2 chunks of flesh... Only in turn for someone to shove a piece of metal threw the open wound!!!! There is an EXTREMELY HIGH chance of infection from minor to sever... what i am trying to tell you is... if you really want it GO FOR IT!!! or... if you can wait until the age where you will most likely be WAY MORE responsible... therefor there will be a WAY LESS chance for infection AND you will have had the time to REALLY think if its something you really want and want to risk... If the PAIN of it is really worth the piece of metal threw your stomach... <br>  <br>  There is a REASON and I can not stretch this ENOUGH for you kids interested in body modification, why they made the 18 year age limit law on body modification... including getting plastic surgery!!! It is simply because your body is not even done going threw its natural changes... and your already thinking about changing that... that right there doesn't show a whole lot of maturity and or responsibility... <br>  <br>  My advice is to wait until you are old enough to really know what if best for your body... but on the other hand if this is something that means THAT much to you go for it... just please please please be careful and take care of it... and for god sake take care of your body you are still SO YOUNG...<br>  <br>  Much luck to you...<br>  ~Courtney<br>  <br>  PS. FOCUS ON YOUR EDUCATION!!! Forget about your looks!! They don't even matter until your out of high school anyway and are looking for a REAL job in the REAL world... Focus and really listen and learn to what your teachers have to tell you... there is SO much intresting stuff about the world out there and RIGHT now in your life YOU have a chance to LEARN IT ALL... FOR FREE!!! once you get out of high school if you wanna learn something intresting... im not even kidding you it will cost more than you could ever imagine... Welcome to America... LEARN IT WHILE YOU CAN and figure out NOW what it is your most interested in set your GOALS high and LIVE THEM!<br>  <br>  : )|`|znngp3E0aa	There is nothing wrong with getting a belly button piercing at your age. It is super cute, and is definitely worth it. For me, it cost $42 plus a tip. I gave $3 for the tip...I don't really know what you're supposed to give, but that made it an even $45. And yes, it does hurt. Not unbearably, but not like a pinch either. It's kind of like a mild  throbbing pain, but it doesn't take long for it to go away completely. It takes like 5 seconds for them to clamp it and make sure it's the way you want it, then 1 second to actually pierce it and like 5 seconds to put the jewelry in it. So it's a really short procedure. <br>  <br>  <br>  The only problem with belly button piercings is that there is a slightly higher risk of the piercing rejecting. Basically what that means is the body treats your new piercing like a splinter and tries to push it out of your body. I've seen scars and it's NOT pretty. But just buy some sea salt and distilled water to clean it, not alcohol or neosporin, and wear loose clothing at first and you should be fine. Don't clean it too often or it will dry up and become itchy.<br>  <br>  Listen to your piercer about how long to wait until you can change it, and you should be fine. That's all I can think about for now. Good luck with your new piercing!!

Incompetancy does not reside in humans who have a certain hair type. However, this labelling may contribute to the way some women act. They are often labled 'dumb blondes' but may continue to act in such a way to seek attention. <br>  <br>  However, there are a number of humans, of all ages and cultures that can have motivational difficulties and/or are challenged by certain situations. Some very pretty women have been known to use their beauty to pass certain subjects... and some fail altogether and become working class citizens or prostitutes (which is perfectly legal where I'm from). <br>  <br>  Interesting how you say some people look for 'blonde mistakes' instead of 'brunette mistakes'. which is true due to labelling.

DiVqUSlraa	It's not just about dieting, sometimes if you are struggling with diets you may want to incorporate some exercise in there to help get the ball rolling.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Well you might not need it, depends how tall you are.|`|hQ82X9gEaa	eat healthier and go for a jog every night
Cbb0NDL9aa	My piercer said 4 weeks too, but most people want to get the downsize after 2 weeks.  I think it's just a guage as everyone's healing time is different.  A big bar is uncomfortable to feel in your mouth all the time, plus eating with it is awful as your teeth keep catching on it.  Also talking is a nuisance - something as big as that in your mouth = spitting, tripping on words etc.  As soon as you feel like your tongue is back to normal, go back to the piercer and ask if they can give you the downsize.  Chances are they'll say yes.  But definitely go back to the piercer.<br>  <br>  As for the guage stuff...I'm not sure what you mean...stretching?  If so, there are bars you can get for that...but it'll be best to wait 'til the piercing is healed to avoid pain.  <a href="http://www.piercedandmodified.co.uk/Stretched-Tongue-Piercings-sub-137.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.piercedandmodified.co.uk/Stre...</a><br>  If that's not what you meant, sorry!|`|z3uUtr33aa	um, your gonna believe your friends over your piercer? don't change for 4 weeks. and i don't know what your talking about with the 5/8 of a 16 gauge bar but a 16 gauge is smaller than a 14 gauge so if you change it to a 16 gauge bar that might not be the safest thing to do. why don't you just buy a 14 gauge jewelry? good luck!|`|ss48BEk5aa	If your downsizing to a 16 g it won't be very difficult to change it. One thing about changing a new piercing though is even though the swelling has gone down, it's still not healed, so any "trauma" to it will make the swelling come up again. I would wait another week just to be safe. And of course, make sure to clean the new jewelry very good!|`|znngp3E0aa	The standard bar size for a tongue ring is 14g at 5/8 inch, so if you downsize to a 16g, it'll be a lot harder for you to find cute jewelry. I would definitely recommend staying at a 14g. My piercer told me to keep my long bar in for 4 weeks too, but I kept mine in for 2 weeks because no one wants a gigantic bar in their mouth for a month. So yeah, just wait until you're sure that your tongue is back to it's normal size (probably around 2 weeks) and change it. If you're scared, you could have a friend change it for you. That's what I did. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C3aviMmyaa	1) Are you seriously going to believe your friends over your piercer?<br>  <br>  2) 16g is smaller than a 14g, so no, you won't hurt yourself. But why would you want to go smaller?
h46Oxo95aa	Maybe because it's new trend now these days.|`|lF65kGdyaa	Its symbolic to some of being an individual.

b1NMh5K2aa	I think makeup artist- They get so much money|`|g2qyhEJ5aa	It's a cross between makeup artist, hair artist & opening your own beauty salon.<br>  <br>  It depends on how good you are.<br>  If you open a salon and it becomes best known in the state, that's the best. But you could become a famous makeup artist known throughout the world.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	depends on your clientelle,no clients no money in any area of the industry|`|AA10792562	Owning your own salon has the potential for the most money.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	best way too get money from the beauty business is probably ( around my area at the moment) is as a paint sprayer and do the orange colour that girls like quicker and easier without any missed spots
qwwJOJmfaa	well most of the time, someone won't shop at both hot topic and aeropostale. they're dual styles. Hot Topic is definately more... rocker, emo, goth type thing. aeropostale is way more preppy and in my oponion... cuter!!! =]] but it depends on your style. If you usually shop at aeropostale than my guess would be that hot topic isn't for you.|`|ipRPrvzxaa	hot topic is overpriced<br>  i've only bought things from their sale section<br>  aeropostale's clothes are cuter, h.t.'s clothes are cooler (but the novelty wears off)|`|qmqzVsfWaa	hot topic<br>  waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better<br>  but it is overpriced|`|uvICu0gNaa	hot topic is overpriced but their clothes are awesome!!! The price is worth it (well to me)|`|2diobki7aa	I sometimes go to Hot Topic just to browse. But I never buy anything, it's really expensive. ($25 for a tee shirt!) If you're choosing between that and Aero, it depends on your style. If you're more of a punk style, definitely go to Hot Topic. But Aero is the way to go if you're more preppy. (: I hope this helps!|`|P2EhkEJVaa	i love hot topic! they are nothign like Aeropostale. first of all hot topic is more emo, punk, scene, goth clothes and the store is based on music. they are lightly over priced, but its worth it. if you have any doubts about whats in there check out there sight www.hottopic.com <br>  remember you dont hvae to have a style to go in there. they have band shirts and everything. dont be scared ether when you go it. yes the music is screamo and the people have many many peircings, but they are seriously the most friendly store. and the guys are supper hot ;P
SjBw4wuEaa	no, it really depends on the shape of your face.<br>  i have a friend, and her forehead is quite big, like it sticks out from profile view. so side bangs dont work on her. i've seen other head shapes it doesnt work for either.|`|J8LASik0aa	I think so! Unless you have incredibly frizzy, curly hair, but you could always straighten the side bangs!|`|rs0leGv5aa	Pretty much yeah|`|32N7lygtaa	i think so, yes.|`|MitVhIK9aa	nope all depends on the face|`|i9BgSAMjaa	yes
nNSoOWQDaa	Pin them back with bobby pins. Or you could wear a hat and tuck them under it.|`|gTXUcd1maa	When that happened to me, i swept them to the side everyday. You could also pin them back on a little bump on the top of your head, or pin them with a barrette to the side of your head. good luck.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	the first answer is your best bet.  until they grow out more your options are limited.  headband sounds fine for now.|`|jvWAiGSwaa	you could do a pompadore.<br>  (just your bangs pinned back.)<br>  <a href="http://trend911.com/wp-content/101408_duff_300x400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://trend911.com/wp-content/101408_du...</a><br>  depending on how short they are  you could pin them to the side too.|`|S93MrATlaa	if you can, clip them to the side or pin them back.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223145326AAuAXWR&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
LBHJaqXoaa	Sounds like the classic case of a Keloid scar. The bump will never go away and if you repierce it, the scar is likely to get even bigger. Sorry to tell you this, it's probably not what you wanted to hear... You can always try to repierce it, maybe the keloid won't grow any larger... I guess you won't know for sure unless you try.

oYmZUO8Caa	Are you looking for millimeters? <br>  <br>  Each cm has 10 mm. So it would be 320 mm.
r4i7xPnMaa	The only suggestion I can offer is to figure out what's going on with the bit of hair hanging in your face. Is it bangs? If so, cut it. If not, put it back with the rest of your hair... It looks really really awkward just hanging in front of your face.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you're far from ugly, so I'm sure a new hairstyle and a bit of makeup to boost your confidence would help the boys notice you. :)|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Work with what you have and just be your self.|`|Oti6JXJIaa	ya definitely straighten your hair.|`|l22I9eAQaa	cover up, eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, blush, and lipgloss, maybe a hotish pink lipgloss, green eyeshadow, brown mascara, brown eyeliner. good luck!|`|MfxQv0k8aa	you look thirteen.<br>  straighten yr hair.<br>  make-up.<br>  thats what i did, & im much more confident (:|`|gXrwqoTGaa	I'm going to be honest so don't be mad.<br>  <br>  Lose some weight.<br>  Shape your eyebrows.<br>  Put on some lip gloss.|`|7wFSTmwfaa	well, since ur only 13, like me, u should go light on the makeup. girls look WAY too plastic if they put a ton on. some mascara, light eyeshadows, maybe a lil blush, and possibly a lil eyeliner (dont over do it) u might want a light powder foundation. and if u play sports, like me, waterproof is best!!!<br>  good luck, and luv urself the way u r<br>  guys will luv u|`|c0JhgIKyaa	Why the heck should she straighten her hair! No, you shouldn't straighten your hair because your wavy hair is awesome.  Besides, It would look so flat if u straightened it.. like spaghetti! Leave your hair like it is ..|`|yrwq0gNcaa	like 11
YS5osEzFaa	They usually sell it at Wal-Mart or CVS or basically any grocery store. You can buy them in a travel size. Or if you can't find that, get a little container (like the kind they give foundation/lotion samples in at the mall) and put some in there and carry it in your purse.|`|JbeuWHG1aa	I'd recommend going to a health store & getting something with pure, non chemical ingredients.  Vaseline is a petroleum product.  I think you can find something better & healthier.  The Vaseline might appear to help but be detrimental in the long term.|`|zWo03iLNaa	You can just go to walmart or something and they will have the vaseline in the little tube that resemblex carmex.  May even be in the check out aisle
df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	do you use product in your hair when you straighten it?  if so the product is causing it to get oily.  also if you're using product, don't put it directly on top of your scalp.  start at the end of hairs and work up.  if you're not using product, then something about straightening is causing natural oils to be released.<br>  <br>  i say leave it natural.|`|dnND6BJEaa	try cleaning your iron and using a "cleansing" shampoo. neautrogena makes a good one (anti residue). that will help. and the more you touch your hair, the more grease its transfered to it from your finger.s|`|7D44tO9Daa	im going to guess and say that the heat brings out the oils....
sUO7BB1yaa	I don't have any personal experience with Japanese Hair Straightening, but I remember my friend having it done and she loved it. She had naturally brown, kinky, curly hair. When she had the Japanese straightening done it became as straight as a ruler and was much shinier. She said she loved it and it was permanent. She only had to worry about curly hair once her started growing out.<br>  <br>  I think you should give it a try!
VbsHJGDxaa	I have gone through short to long and all over. In my opinion I like long hair better for me. But short hair is easier to handle. Do whatever makes you feel right though.

Y5WJWnvbaa	i would say go for it.<br>  <br>  your hair is definitely long enough, and the layers are more of a blessing than a curse with perms, otherwise you can end up with something of a 'pyramid' effect, where the hair sticks out more at the bottom, where there is less weight.<br>  <br>  the only thing i can advise is that you go to a good, reputable salon, as the last thing you want to do is run the risk of coming home with a perm disaster!|`|n5G5IIbOaa	What kind of perm do you want?<br>  I really don't think it's a great idea as it is supposed to be very damaging and sometimes they don't even last.<br>  :) x|`|HIwJFtNlaa	It sounds like it's a good candidate because it's healthy and perms usually aren't as bad as dyes. With the length, it depends on the curls that you're looking at. and the layers aren't such a good idea with a perm but maybe you can wait a little bit for it to grow out and then perm it, but generally speaking, layers aren't as big of a factor as you may think, but it may look a bit funny.<br>  well i hope i helped!|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Yes

Ls93X4ufaa	No Paypal does not automatically send anything. You must sign into your Paypal account after winning and choose to send a payment now. Since some people win and don't pay, that's why they have the received in three day rule, so they can re-list the item if it is not payed for within the limit.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	No, you have to sign in to paypal through ebay and click confirm or whatever to confirm that you want to pay for it. People say payments must be made within 3 days or something like that, because some sellers accept other forms of payment... such as money orders and what not. Paypal is the fastest and safest way for payment, though.

SjBw4wuEaa	wow. shes kinda creepy....ahaha.<br>  but as for the eyeliner, try liquid? it is really bold.<br>  i recommend rimmel's or maybeline. both found at drugstore for a cheap price. if you dont like liquid, you could try covergirl perfect point plus, its not a pencil, but its pretty much like that, only you roll up the eyeliner. good luck :)|`|JIel7eM5aa	it's just a huge amount, under her eye.<br>  don't do it.|`|L6wcyVwyaa	eyeline your inner lids and slightly outside with a normal eyeliner and (i use MAC kohl eyeliner for the inner bits and a rimmel one for slight outside) then use a black eyeshadow (i use a MAC one) and a small brush to brush over the eyeliner line to create a thicker line that doesn't look too harsh and it also smudges it. i do this, it looks the exact same! oh and don't forget loads of mascara when you're done.|`|BbwI6CJqaa	Ok first you need to get yourself the cake eyeliner and some water fastener.  you then mix the two to form a paste, you then mark it on your lower lid.  You then go over it with black shadow and rub it so it looks like that.|`|81tlBAwIaa	Take a still shot picture of it, then bring it into Bon Ton, JCpennys, Sears, and where with and make-up counter, and they'll ususally show you for free. :]|`|krIKhZzcaa	Start with a normal amount of eyeliner then slowly add more. Then you may want to add some black or dark gray eyeshadow to make a smokey effect.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)
PvdJd1Ttaa	Oh yes of course, I used orajel on my lip piercing it works fine. You should probably get some disinfectant spray though if your planning on doing it by yourself though. Or Water mixed with salt cleans it a little. But yeah Tooth ache stuff works :)|`|qifVpv4jaa	The place you go to will most likely have numbing stuff for you, but I would ask before I go to get it done.
VN2wyTnFaa	Sort of. The coverage is really light, the shade seems a bit grey, and the undertones seem a bit cool for my skin. Also, it feels like it takes a lot to blend it into a normal looking color. I'd honestly just go for a tinted moisturizer instead, the product is sheer so it's easier to find a shade that will match you. Good luck!|`|YS5osEzFaa	I've never used it. But, if you really want to know if it works- when nobody's looking, squirt a little but on your finger and apply it to the back of your hand or on small part of your face. Lol!! You'll know if it works! =-)
5xobrNbBaa	<------ my hair was purple be sure u really like it because the only way to get it out is to dye it black <br>  <br>  it costed 15$ for a big bottle and since your hair is already light u dont need to bleach it so dont get the spat brand get manic panic it does NOT damage your hair at all<br>  <br>  do it behind you moms back and if u think it looks good she probably will to and if u think it looks terrible cut it off and if she asks why u cut it off say you just wanted to cut off your split ends<br>  <br>  oh and if your still in school run when you see the teachers they will RPC or suspend u just RUN thats what i did|`|aVqzz5wAaa	1) anywheres from 20-100$<br>  2) I like Goldwell Elumen<br>  3) Yes<br>  4) It might if you have had your hair chemically processed before. Talk to the stylist who would be dying your hair.<br>  5) Yes, sure you can cut it off. It is just like any other hair! If you liked your length, though, you can just dye over it your original color.<br>  6) Tell her you'll pay for part or all, and if it doesn't look good, you will cut it off.<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  <br>  Purples really cool!<br>  <br>  p.p.s.<br>  <br>  Goldwell Elumen has the absolute BEST purple.|`|GG5CFTrmaa	well they sell semi-perminate hair color at sallys beauty salon (www.sallybeauty.com)<br>  so if your mom doesnt like it you wont have to cut your hair.<br>  the color will last for about 4-6 weeks.<br>  hope i helped =) and the dye itself costs about $10|`|PlUUIyoJaa	1.) About how much would it cost? CHEAP! If you want just the tips, it will be inexpensive. (:<br>  2.) Are there like ceritain hair-dye products that are better to you? Manic Panic, or go to a professional that really knows what they're doing! They can make it hot.<br>  3.) and if so, will I be able to get it at a hair salon? Yes! Not Great Clips or Super Cuts!<br>  4.) Would it damage my hair at all? EVERY dye damages hair, but a little purple on the tips? Nahhh. Nope!<br>  5.) Since its only the tips would I be able to cut it off it I dont like it?  Duh! But you sound pretty, so go for it.<br>  6.) Do you have any suggestiong on how to convince my mom to let me? Show her this answer! Your child is only young once, so let her go a little bit "wild". I'm fourteen, and I've dyed my hair waaaaaay crazier. (My hair is all orange now). It's an inexpensive, fun way to be creative! (:<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  :D|`|tQeptUw8aa	It doesn't cost more than twenty bucks. Go to Hot Topic, I am telling you. They give you kits with permanent and temporary dye so you can try it and out use the perm. if you like the result. Hair salons do not regularly hold that type of dye. The closest you would get it probably a eggplant burgandy.. and you want Purple, soo. To convince your mom though, tell her its a temporary dye and it lasts two (or three) weeks..and then see if it grows on her, if it doesn't why don't you just trim it off?.. Always use temporary first though please. I have been through every color of the rainbow and I came out looking like a chewed up skittle..yeah.. so just be smart girly =) good luck!|`|vzr1qfQ9aa	1.) Cost all depends on the salon, I suggest you go and talk to each salon and find the right price for you.<br>  2.) I prefer loreal and I  just search the salons and ask what they use.<br>  3.) Ask at salons<br>  4.) And time you colour, perm or straighten your hair you  are damaging it, so yes, you will be damaging your hair<br>  5.) yes, if you don't like it you can sut it off, as long as that is okay with you.<br>  6.) Wait for the school holidays and suggest it again, and tell her you will have them cut off by the time school starts again. Or try a semi colour.
u6BNPURKaa	Casual is jeans and sneakers.. Everyday wear for around the house.<br>  <br>  Semi Casual... Think dress pants, skirts.. Nice blouses. Nice shoes you wouldnt wear every day.. Not heels, but kinda stylish.<br>  <br>  Formal fancy dresses with heels and good jewelry. Think Prom and Winter Ball type clothes.<br>  <br>  <br>  In my book, you could get away with a dress that you might wear every day, or be willing to wear out on a date.. But not a dress you would be willing to wear to prom. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://style-damsel.blogspot.com/2008/04/style-damsel-new-clutches-and-dresses.html" rel="nofollow">http://style-damsel.blogspot.com/2008/04...</a><br>  <br>  They do a good job of illustrating what Im trying to say.|`|DtuVDpqKaa	it really depends on what the event is.  if the event is a concert for some school program it should seem fine.  It also depends on the person that wants you to dress casually or semi casually.  If the person seems very strict about what you should wear, then try something a little more dressy, or if they aren't as strict, what you have should be fine.  I would also say that you don't have to buy anything to wear to this event, go in what you already own, there is no reason that you should have to buy something new.|`|uD4sxYhNaa	Do you think its a little to kiddish?

If you've ever used wood stain or painted a room without ventilation you'll know what i"m talking about. <br>  <br>  ANd what, thats not cool. They've clearly never done any real drugs.|`|SuMwWNfyaa	no<br>  <br>  we just joke around by pretending to get high|`|5oSnHPYSaa	yeah it does kill your brain cells but only if you sniff it constantly..|`|fC5X8swbaa	It can.<br>  <br>  And what does this have to do with the beauty and style section?|`|l8HTrNyIaa	Yes, it does. It can kill you. Common house hold products used in that manner(by directly sniffing them)is a kind of drug called an inhalant. It can kill you on your first time using. If a friend is doing that, they need help, and fast! Other inhalants include gasoline, cleaning products and markers.|`|9YM0whxLaa	oh please lord<br>  do not do that crap<br>  its immature and stupid<br>  getting high is ridiculous<br>  don't lower yourself to there level!!!<br>  and it can kill you or make you brain dead<br>  i just never can think that 5 mins of feeling stupid is worth that!!|`|wjA9ytO0aa	this isnt about beauty or fashion.|`|KlPBXPo3aa	it does if you sniff it to much but it could also kill you|`|y4ZB492oaa	yes don't do it|`|5wkeQLERaa	hardly, i always try it and it never works. i enjoy the smell [:|`|QuokZhuqaa	no, I don't think so. Maybe after a long period?|`|0yuB02OSaa	if u sniff it for to long then yes expo markers also make you high
WPVpOfuwaa	Haha what?!<br>  <br>  It is called your cuticle. It is not bad for you but it pay look bad unless you think it looks bad.|`|x7vB4P5Naa	uumm...I think the job, relationship and bad breath things are all old wives tales.  The only way it's bad is if you pick at it too much and cause them to bleed, causing a possible infection.  That happened to me once...the side of my finger was sore and red and had a bubble of pus next to the nail....gross!!!|`|MhzlKnrWaa	I Bite My Nails and All Around Them haha Its Nothing But A Bad Habit.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Picking or biting your cuticles is not only unbecoming, but it can be very unhealthful.  A friend, who frequently bit her cuticles, contracted a painful staph infection in that area and had to take antibiotics as treatment.  Regarding the career area, it might be considered unprofessional (and annoying) to see an employee nervously harming herself.  Better to quit than to cause future problems.  <br>  <br>  If a person practices life-long habits of dental visits, flossing, brushing, etc., it is doubtful that bad breath will occur in old age.  Of course, bad breath can happen at any age depending on a person's diet and health.|`|2diobki7aa	I don't think it's going to mess up your future or anything.<br>  But it doesn't look very attractive, so I'd stop.<br>  (:
QUE9Nca5aa	Take a darker brown blusher or bronzer and suck your cheeks in. Apply this to the underneath of your cheekbones lightly all the way up to around your eyebrows.  Then take a lighter blush (peach, pink) depending on your skin tone, and apply this the apples of your cheeks (the chubby bit when you smile). Then take some highlighter and apply this to the very top of your cheekbones just under your eyes.<br>  <br>  Hoola, Georgia and Highbeam by benefit are what I use and they are brilliant.|`|KWl605JTaa	blush|`|zNHjkQsHaa	suck in your cheeks (like a fish lol) and the bone there will be a bone showing at the top. put blush there|`|CGSehbsKaa	Use an angled face brush with a bronzer, blush and highlighter.  The basic technique is to suck your face in like a fish and apply bronzer in the hollows of the cheek and on your temples.  Then apply blush just above where you applied the bronzer and blend them both out with a clean kabuki brush.  Apply the highlighter to your cheekbones.  <br>  <br>  As for products, if you have money to spend I suggest using the MAC 168 brush, Coastal Scents Pink Kabuki brush, NARS Laguna Bronzer and Orgasm Blush duo and MAC Cream Color Base in Pearl or Luna. (www.maccosmetics.com, www.sephora.com, www.coastalscents.com)  <br>  <br>  If you don't have a lot of money, you can purchase the Coastal Scents Angled Blush brush and Pink Kabuki brush along with their Contour & Blush Palette on their website, www.coastalscents.com.  Their products are extremely close in quality to MAC's for about 1/3 of the price.  <br>  <br>  If you need any other tutorials, YouTube and www.makeupgeek.com are great places to look.  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps and good luck!|`|4cM3njVOaa	more blusher and toner :)
DoO04zsqaa	first: using a pencil liner, liquid or gel in black. draw a line on top of your lashes down to the end leaving a little space and wing it out upwards. not down because it'll leave you looking drupey.<br>  <br>  Second: with a liner pencil in black line your bottom eyes.<br>  you can also and a little under your lower lashes with pencil or a little shadow to make your eyes pop.|`|AA10626996	Okay this is a power look. Simply apply to lower inner eye lid area top and bottom. You know that little white area when you pull your lid out a little ( good luck w/ that top part . It's not easy) then apply to the top and lowers lash area as close as you can get. Smudge a tad bit to get a smoky look but not too much. Its a very powerful look and it may take a bit to get that look right . Practice and you will have it in no time :)|`|ZMn9vY7Jaa	kajal eyeliner on the bottom lashline, and then a whole bunch of liquid eyeliner framing your eyes. Also, a bit  of black shadow and mascara.The top lid also haas some white eye shadow too by the way. <br>  Watch videos on youtube, type in kajaleyeliner or liquid eyeliner.|`|eqCfPDpRaa	idk about that top .. but to do the bottom .. you would have to use a good eyeliner .. waterproof maybe .. and go under the tear line to create that bold look <br>  <br>  sorry im not much of a help|`|YS5osEzFaa	Trace your bottom and top lashes with a thick, heavy line of black eyeliner. And make it kinda point out at the outer corners of your eyes.|`|MW1BiwhJaa	wow i would like to know that also!!|`|CGSehbsKaa	You will need a long-staying black pencil eyeliner and a good black gel liner as well.  I suggest Urban Decay 24 hr liner or Styli-Style for the pencil and for the gel MAC fluidline or L'Oreal HIP gel eyeliner.  Use the pencil to line your waterline on the top and bottom, all the way around the eye.  Use a good brush, such as the Coastal Scents Angled Taklon Liner brush, to do the gel liner on the top and bottom lash lines, making the liner thicker towards the outside of your eyes and thinner towards your tear ducts.  You may want to set it with a black eyeshadow, such as MAC carbon with a small brush, like MAC 219 or Coastal Scents Chisel/Pointed duet.  <br>  <br>  Check out YouTube or www.makeupgeek.com for a step-by-step tutorial.|`|uWpeO1Ngaa	dis needs a proffesional nd iz hard buh u cn still get it<br>  <br>  u can but alot of inside eyeliner then put some eye liner on your elyelid neatly on the white area nd a smudge it a bit den do the same to der buttom bit nd get closer on the corner of ur eye nd for a finish u cn go over it wiv liquid eyelina buh u need 2 practic cuz its hard nd needs time<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4cM3njVOaa	the lady would have hired a person to do her make up for her so i dont think you can get yours exactly like the lady's BUt :)<br>  <br>  you can get liquid eyeliner and smooth it across the outside of your bottom eyelid to make it stand out.

qQ9RVkvWaa	hmm.. mi hermana says that you should try straightening it the night before and then the morning. use smoothing/heat protection products. and if its really bad try taking a shower early in the day, sleeping with your hair natural, and in the morning all the oils from your hair should tame the frizziness a bit.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	when you take a shower, put mousse and maybe gel in it. never touch your hair a lot. the more you touch it, the more frizzy it gets.|`|G0O1M5XZaa	Don't straighten it every day as it is drying it out and that is why it is frizzing. If you have dry hair try a good treatment like pantene. Usually a good cut fixes the problem. You can buy like anti frizz from the supermarket to stop it frizzing.  My daughter has the same problem. She uses the anti frizz. I cannot think of the name off hand and she has taken it to school with her in her bag. A few off hand are garnier or pantene or sunsilk. Speak to the hairdresser. I hope I have helped.|`|GPWfzOUhaa	I apply a "cocktail" of two products to my towel-damp hair every day before gently blowdrying on low with a bowl type diffuser.  I mix two pumps of Hask Pure Shine Frizz Ready with two dollups (about quarter-sized) of L. A. Looks Curl Gel (blue) in my palms for a few seconds and apply on the most frizzy areas and sections first, and work it through with my hands and fingers.  I bowl diffuse upside down, scrunching as I go, and only drying until it is still a bit damp.  In other words, I keep my wavy hair.  You could also straighten using these products, but try going naturally wavy instead.  I have not found a better mix of products for this purpose.  Both are available at Rite Aid.  The gel runs about $3.50 and the serum runs about $7.  <br>  <br>  And yes, the other respondent is correct...try not to touch your hair as much as possible.  I usually just finger style after drying.  Tourmaline hair dryers are supposed to help with frizzies, too, but they are pretty pricey.  I hope this helps!|`|5KzOOjHuaa	Get a good straightener.<br>  Get hair serum or hair cream<br>  use the straightener and cream when you striaghten your hair  section it, Put cream in it, then straighten it.

XsrpFrEMaa	Start with half head highlights, and if you want to go blonde get it done professionally. Seriously. Or it will not be blonde, it will be orange.<br>  If you start with the highlights and don't like it or it doesn't suit you then you can dye it brown again without having damaged too much of your hair.<br>  If you like it and want to take it further, move on to full head highlights and from there take it to fully blonde.<br>  Bleaching, if you do it at home, will not only turn out orange, but will ruin your hair, and it will be more frizzy. If you get it done in a salon, they will know how much your hair can handle strength wise, they will use better quality and less damaging products and will be able to tell you how to care for it and prevent it from becoming too damaged.|`|c3CVY87caa	Bleaching basically ruins your hair... put straight bleach on a paper towel and it will make it break down and look awful... same thing for your hair: it will make it very thin and break easier.  This could make the straightening of your hair even more damaging and basically it will look really bad in the long run.<br>  <br>  I will have to agree with your mom on the blonde thing... it wouldn't work and it would do the same thing to your skin as it did to Lindsey Lohan's when she went blonde (not good).|`|zprAkP3eaa	Anything would look better then that color.

Bleach blonde is way too light. But if you use the color "golden blonde" it will look really good.

Don't listen to the others. Don't go platinum, but a very soft blonde would look gorgeous. <br>  <br>  Bleaching is a very damaging process if not worked properly.

zhzJoZ26aa	Try a brown liner on your upper lashline, and a white liner on your waterline (it will make your eyes big and beautiful!) Try also a brownish-black mascara. :D I have dark hair/green eyes too and that's what I do when I'm driving to walmart, or going into school for a few hours.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also get a smudger and smoke it out if you want it more dramatic (say a day to night look in one easy step.)|`|CGSehbsKaa	Instead of using black eyeliner on the top and bottom lash lines, use a dark brown eyeliner on the bottom and a thin black line on top.  I also suggest using black mascara only on your top lashes and a dark brown mascara on the bottom.

It is a drugstore product, but it is especially designed for Dry or Sensitive skin and is made with no talc, which absorbs oil and is thus bad for dry skin, talc also settles into fine lines and wrinkles which is bad for older women.

The key to keeping eyeshadow from melting into your eyelid crease as the day goes on is to kept eyelids oil-free. To do this start with an eyeshadow base (also called "primer"). I prefer to dab at bit of MAC's 'paint' on lids before shadow application. Or try Fresh Freshface Perfecting Eye Primer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Apply eyeliner. If you're going for a typical black, brown or gray smoky eye, apply liner in one of those colors above the upper lash line, drawing line thicker in the middle of eye. If your opting for a jewel-toned eye (violet makes a gorgeous smoky eye), line eyes with a purple, blue or deep green liner.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blend in color on bottom lashes For color on the bottom (a key smoky eye look) you'll want a lighter eyeliner. The key is to "smudge it." You can also apply a bit of shadow to get full smudge effect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Apply light base color Again, the key to a smoky eye is pairing a lighter base with the darker hue. I prefer a nice cream shade for my base. Sweep a light, shimmery shadow over the lids to your browbone. I love Stila's whipped eye shadows $20. The moist "mousse" consistency seems to stay on forever. My favorite colors are taupe and pearl. <br>  <br>  <br>  Blend in darker color, but keep dark color below the crease. Now that you have the base and eyeliner on, it's time to get the smoky effect. You need a darker eyeshadow shade. Using an eyeshadow brush blend in color starting at your lash line, blending up. Make sure to blend color into the lash line so the eye liner disappears. Stop deep color at crease. <br>  <br>  <br>  Doublecheck your work Make sure eyes match and blend color with a Q-tip if need be.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finish with several coats of volumizing mascara. Tried and true mascaras (featured in "Elle" magazine's March 2006 issue) include DiorShow Mascara & L'Oreal Paris Volume Shocking Mascara. Elle's writer says they are the best volumizers she's tried.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  Remember to keep lips nude. When applying strong makeup (like smoky eyes or red lips) put the focus on either eyes or lips, never both. (Think Angelina Jolie: She either plays up her huge eyes or her huge lips, never both. If she did, she'd look like a clown).<br>  For a bit of fun, try a blue or purple mascara. It will make blue eyes "pop."<br>  Liner doesn't have to come in pencil form. Makeup experts know eyeshadows make some of the best eyeliners. To do this take an eyeliner brush (available at Sephora, MAC or any dept store), wet it, then dab wet brush into the dark shadow. This allows for a deep, precise line. You can also use the dark shadows without wetting brush first. Either way, eyeliner is necessary for smoky eye.<br>  This season go jewel-toned (blue is great for you blue-eyed girls) and keep your eyes smoky but stay away from dark browns and black. Instead, go for a deep purple, a gold-brown or any of the many vibrant colors in this year.<br>  What You Need:<br>  Eye primer (you don't need it, but it's great for keeping shadow in place)<br>  2 Shadows: One light, one darker<br>  Eyeliner<br>  Makeup brushes<br>  Mascara|`|Bp5THu35aa	<a href="http://www.polyvore.com/hollister/set?id=677666" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/hollister/set?id...</a><br>  idkk da skirt is just dere but hope u like da outfit but yeaa|`|ktFJa6dWaa	u should wear a detailed (kinda like ed-hardy) long t-shirt that ends rite below ur butt and black leggings : )|`|LjiExIU1aa	Never look like you try to hard :)  So, that being said, I'd go for a fitted top, maybe something with a ruffle or a bitt of fluff to the sleeve.  Skinny jeans with a rockin pair of low heel shoes (maybe a red wedge shoe ~my personal favorite!)  A clutch bag and either hot earings or a statement/bold necklace.<br>  <br>  I'd go with a really clean face and make it a bit glowy.  For the eyes, tonight practice with adding a bit of white to the inner part of your eyes (near your nose).  Put white or a very light color on  your lid.  Find a smokey color for the crease of your eye lid and a light color (white like) for the lid closest to your brow).  Make sure your brows are flawless though!   To get a smokey look for the eyeliner I love to use this trick.  Find your favorite smokey grey shadow, lightly wet your eyeshadow brush (dap a bit to get some of the access water off) then take your (now damp) shadow and put it as close to your upper lashes as you can.  Apply in a narrow line, but fairly heavly.  The real success can come with the mascara.  Be sure to get the base of your lashes really dark (this well help your shadow to pop).  Too often we focus on lash length and forget the value in the base of the lashes.  A bit of shimmer on your eyes will help too.  Just make sure you only focus on your eyes...keep everything else light and glowy (or else you'll look like you robbed a cosmetic store).  A glossy pink lip is always a it.

I had worn dark blue skinny jeans, a white tank top with that lace stuff at the bottom, my moms black vintage vest, and my old skull lace up Vans. Its a super simple outfit, and fits both the Hollister and Hot Topic look. <br>            If that doesnt work for you, I would suggest another pair of dark wash jeans, one of those lacey undershirt tanktop things, and a button up plaid top. Id prefer to wear it with some Vans or Converse, to add that grunge flare to the preppy shirt. It will be a tad warmer as well.<br>            As for the eyeliner and smokey eyes, to apply eyeliner I pull the outside corner of my eye to make myself look almost Asiany, and apply just barely over the lashline, and right on the edge of both my upper and bottom lids, but only on the outside half. For the smokey look, you should put a tiny bit of lotion on your eyelid to keep the eyeshadow on longer than first period. I would recommend using a dark grey shadow opposed to black, and blend onto the lower half of your top lid, getting lighter the higher you go, ending around the crease. You can even brush a bit of a light shadow onto your brow line to highlight the shape and contrast the darker shadows beneath it.<br>            Even I might wear something like this tomorrow. :]

4AQ3KsIcaa	Okay here are  a few I can think of:<br>  <br>  For curling your eyelashes, heat up the curler with a blowdryer for about 10-15 sec. and make sure you test it before you use it on your eye so you don't burn your skin!! (trust me, it hurts!)<br>  <br>  For eyeshadow, you can wet your brush a little bit to make the eyshadow more pigmented.<br>  <br>  Wiggle your mascara brush when appyling mascara to the left and right to help seperate clumps.<br>  <br>  When you sharpen your eyeliners, put them in the fridge for a lil bit so they can harden and not break when you sharpen them<br>  <br>  Make an eyeshadow eyeliner by dipping a liner brush in water and then carefully lining your eyes like you would with liquid liner|`|BbwI6CJqaa	The best advise i can give you is to exfoliate you face twice a week then apply moisturiser everyday.  You also must use a primer so your makeup lasts longer.  For a eyes you can use eyes shadow mixed with water for a longer wear and always usewaterprooff eyeliner and mascara.  If you need any more advice you can email me, I can give you lots of hints.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|B3D2ctCWaa	Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize....Figure out what you think your best feature is and then learn how to play it up..For example I really like my eyes.  To bring attention to them without making them seem really far apart or anything I use three colors on them.  A base color all over brow and eye area, something very neutral and light.  A main color on the eye itself depend on what color I am wanting my eye color to appear and then just as the corners of my upper eye lid a darker color in the shape of a pie wedge...|`|0O0lnEgWaa	For makeup i would use a denim blue color eye shadow, then get a light green and mix it in together.

Hair coming back darker and faster is a myth.  People using leg hair as an example are wrong.

Get it waxed is defenitely the best option. Even if you don't want to to go somewhere and get it done, you can easily do it yourself. If you really don't want to wax then probably buy a hair removal cream for sensitve skin.|`|YS5osEzFaa	Don't shave it!! If you get it waxed, it'll grow back thinner and less noticeable. You can wax it yourself with one of those waxing kits. You can get them by the shaving cream/kits.|`|tA3TZGzEaa	get it waxed

VHDLTFG2aa	PROS: that looks can be deceiving..also that they should love who they are because they are beautiful no matter what. <br>  CONS: it kind of puts down advertisements that use photoshop.<br>  <br>  i think that it is promoting the right thing because they are telling women that they shouldn't believe everything they see.<br>  <br>  i do think it is effective advertising. <br>  <br>  *good question*|`|sZMa0s7Baa	I remember I saw one ad where they showed a picture of this girl without any makeup on and then they completely touched it up with photoshop and showed how she looked afterwards, and it definitely made me feel better!! But it isn't going to completely solve the issues with body image, because I think those sort of things have been so brain washed into us that it's pretty irreversible at this point.|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	pros-<br>  more women accepting their bodies.<br>  less young girls thinking 'beauty' is a size zero with no boobs or butt.<br>  relates better to the general public who aren't model-like.<br>  <br>  cons-<br>  not as attractive advertising.<br>  <br>  Effective?  Possibly.  But honestly, models are models for a reason.  I think that teaching young girls that the thin, airbrushed models you see on magazines, commercials, etc. don't actually look like that is just as effective.  People need to learn to love their own bodies (and get healthy if they're not already).

I like their liquid mineral makeup.  I like Maybelline's liquid mineral makeup too.  I am using Rimmel's Stay Matte powder for oil control.  Try using a face scrub for your dry patches.  I am using St. Ives Apricot scrub for sensitive skin.  I have sensitive combination skin.  Make sure to use a light moisturizer too.  I like this moisturizer by Purpose.  You can get this all at Target or any drug store.  Target will be cheaper though.  I think these foundations have good coverage.  It all depends on how much you use.  Mineral makeup is very good for breakouts.  Invest in Bare Essentials blemish treatment. It cost $28, but it works.  I personally don't like powder mineral makeup.  I think it is too light and it makes my pores stand out.|`|wWbE3YKcaa	maybelline pure makeup! little blue tube with a silver cap. my favorite :] i put a pressed powder on over it.

Y tambien verás bajitas, gorditas o flacas en todo tipo de mujer. Porque los paises de latinoamerica hay mucha diversidad.  Por ejemplo, hay videos de un grupo de mexico, que salen las se?oras y las chicas "tipicas mexicanas" comoles dicen algunos,  de piel trigue?a, gordas y cuadradas.. que no tiene nada de malo, pero que generaliza a que todos piensen que las mexicanas son así.. y como dice otro mensaje acá, la verdad es que miren a Thalia, Paulina Rubio, etc... de colombia, shakira, de argentina Luciana salazar, es decir...no todas las latinas son como tu dices.

SDHvDNGJaa	Porque es una parte en la que la piel forma muchos pliegues que son difíciles de mantener bien limpios. Además porque es una zona que tiene roce frecuente con muchas cosa y eso puede inducir mayor produción de melanina en la piel. Intenta un tratamiento abrasivo natural. Usa el jugo de un limón, a?ádele azúcar, haz con esto una pasta y úntatela en tus codos, haz movimientos circulares constantes. Luego enjuaga con agua tibia. Pon tu crema favorita y listo! Poco a poco tus codos irán blanquándose.<br>  Saludos!|`|24bf8f721ca4d3091c270372802a19c8aa	porque no los tallamos bien;te doy una receta limón;baking soda;los mezclas  con el jugo del limón luego los tallas en los codos y en dos meses ya no los vas a tener negros;si sigues las reglas';|`|7bd6e87abcadfc6b4d3657a3c938edd7aa	Hola mi amigo.

En pocos días notarás como lucen naturales y bien cuidados.<br>  2-Qué contrariedad resulta que, al querer llevar una prenda de vestir que deje al descubierto codos y rodillas, estas zonas del cuerpo muestren una piel oscura, agrietada, áspera y excesivamente reseca, como si fuera de cocodrilo. Pese a que pudiera atribuírsele al descuido la razón de este fatal estado, la realidad es que la piel que los cubre, —aun siendo igual a la del resto del cuerpo— tiene características especiales. Internamente tiene pocas glándulas sebáceas, distribuidas en forma irregular, por lo cual es una zona poco lubricada que tiende a estar reseca con frecuencia. No tiene glándulas sudoríparas, es decir, a nadie le sudan los codos, por fuera, ni las rodillas, por delante. Por lo general, en especial en las mujeres, posee escasa presencia de vellos y hay más fibras elásticas, debido a los movimientos de extensión y tensión. Precisamente esos movimientos, más el roce con la ropa, con los golpes, y por ser zonas de apoyo, engruesan la piel, la vuelven más fuerte, pero no más sensible, ya que si bien tiene terminaciones nerviosas normales, hay menos fibras sensitivas.<br>  <br>  También es una parte de la piel que tiene más melanocitos, las células que se localizan en la capa basal (base de la epidermis) responsables de la producción de melanina, la sustancia que da a la piel su pigmento natural y la protege del sol. Esto quiere decir que quienes tienen codos y rodillas más oscuros, o más pigmentados, no se debe a la raza sino al incremento de melanocitos. Por ello, a la hora de tomar sol, se deben proteger estas áreas, ya que pueden tornarse más oscuras. A diferencia del rostro, la piel de los codos y las rodillas no envejece, sino que debido a los movimientos propios de la zona, va generando que la piel se pliegue como si fuera una cortina.<br>  <br>  A esto hay que agregarle que la falta de atenciones y cuidados estéticos suele proporcionarles un aspecto rugoso y poco atractivo.<br>  <br>  Propuestas eficaces<br>  Desde el punto de vista cosmético, la exfoliación e hidratación son los tratamientos obligados para que la piel de los codos y rodillas se vea libre de rugosidades y manchas oscuras.<br>  <br>  Al realizar una exfoliación una vez a la semana, se evita que los diminutos y finos vellos se atrofien en los poros creando puntos negros, los cuales resultan bastante dolorosos por ser ambas partes puntos de apoyo. Permite, además, eliminar las células muertas que ocasionan esa resequedad tan antiestética, y que debido a los pliegues de la zona, se les dificulta desprenderse por sí solas. Resulta muy provechoso que durante la exfoliación se efectúe un enérgico masaje circular, con un cepillo de cerdas suaves o una esponja vegetal, cuidando de no excederse para no maltratar la piel.<br>  <br>  La hidratación diaria también resulta altamente beneficiosa. Al aplicar sobre codos y rodillas una dosis generosa de la habitual loción corporal, la piel se hidrata y se conserva mucho más tersa, suave y lisa. Ayuda, también, aplicar una crema nutritiva así como mascarillas (las mismas que se usan en el rostro) para regenerar esa piel tan frágil y delicada.<br>  <br>  Las más recomendadas son las cremas con liposomas, tecnología de avanzada que ayuda a que el producto penetre en la piel, permitiendo que los nutrientes y aceites sean absorbidos con facilidad; otras contienen vitaminas A, E, C y complejo B, las cuales proporcionan protección contra los rayos solares y contaminantes ambientales, aunque no por ello deja de ser indispensable la utilización de bloqueadores y filtros solares.<br>  <br>  La norma de oro es beber de 2 a 3 litros de agua diariamente y seguir una dieta balanceada; de esta forma, la piel se mantendrá en buenas condiciones y lucirá radiante.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la paleta de colores, cada firma de belleza tiene una gama de unos seis tonos como mínimo. Aquel que más se parezca al de la piel es el que se debe usar; nunca uno más oscuro para parecer más morena o más claro, para lograr ser más blanca. Si se selecciona un color que no corresponda al de la piel, la base se volverá visible y marcará la línea entre el maxilar y el cuello. Suele pasar que no hay un tono igual, por lo que se recomienda mezclar dos colores, para dar con el que más se asemeje al del cutis.<br>  <br>  3- Si los codos ya están rugosos y resecos puede aplicar todos los días aceite de germen de trigo o frotarlos suavemente con piedra pómez. Después se debe aplicar una crema hidratante.<br>  4- Antes de exfoliar ambas zonas se debe emplear agua caliente para que la piel ablande y cueste menos tratarla.<br>  5- No olvide que siempre que hidrate las manos, debe hacer lo mismo con los codos. Igual con las piernas no pase de largo con las rodillas.<br>  6- Pruebe un tratamiento de choque que incluye un par de sesiones de exfoliación intensa y la aplicación de una mascarilla hidratante o nutritiva, en el centro de estética de su preferencia.<br>  7-Evite apoyar codos y rodillas en superficies duras, y por mucho tiempo.-<br>  Espero haberte ayudado.<br>   Muchas gracias por preguntar.<br>  Elige mi respuesta.-|`|4fIJzrqfaa	Generalmente es por el roce que hay ente tus brazos y mesas, escritorios o similares. si te pones limon prosura que no te de el sol porque eso lo mancharia mas ya que el citrico y el sol no se la llevan nada bien!<br>  suerte|`|HFcq2IPFaa	tritura arroz, mezclalo con agua y despues ba?ate|`|J5bL2GEEaa	De estar apoyandolos se blanquean con limon y azucar.|`|exK8lvFyaa	por que asi es tu genetica.<br>  YO POR SUERTE LOS TENGO ROSAS?|`|gSVfIPVgaa	Hola Luis , para mi no es genética sino resequedad por ser un lugar que esta en continuo roce , compra una crema humectante con vitamina E (hay por todos lados baratas) y cada vez que te ba?es pasate un poco vas a ver que mejoras ... si quieres puedes hacerte una exfoliación para retirarte toda la piel muerta que tienes <br>  Suerte!|`|pj6omIfeaa	puede que sea de erencia, pero si no es asi te recomiendo que antes de salir del ba?o despues de darte una ducha, te aplikes jugo de limon, tambien te puede servir para aclarar tus rodillas. espero que te sirva. adios.|`|w2j1MHdHaa	Es depende cada uno la piel pero hacete lo mismo q en las manos azucar, limon y aceite y esponja vegetal para ba?arte buuem ojala q t sirva a mi en los codos me funciono bsoo<br>  <br>   pero depende d cada uno si no te funciona anda a la dermatologa q te va a decir q podes hacer bsitoo|`|138fb6217fec56871263b28686c902d6aa	CREO QUE ES GENETICA!!<br>  yo tengo muy poco

También los puedes encontrar en la mayoría de las verduras como espinacas y alcachofa y en frutas como el kiwi, naranja y limón.<br>  <br>  Lo importante también es hidratar la piel cada día por la ma?ana con crema, protegerla del sol, de vez en cuando exfoliarla, poner una mascarilla que vaya con el tipo de piel, beber alrededor de 1 Lt  1/2 de agua y desmaquillarse bien.<br>  <br>  Intenta comer carne sólo dos veces por semana y evita las grasas saturadas de origen animal porque contienen muchos oxidantes.<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva de ayuda!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Comiendo muchas frutas y verduras, evitando comer muchas grasas animales, comiendo pescado. Evitando asolearte mucho. Si lo necesitas, usando bloqueador solar. Si no necesitas mucho maquillaje, no usar demasiado. Tomando agua regularmente, por lo menos dos litros al día. Usando una crema humectante por las noches. También puedes usar yougurth natural como mascarilla nocturna, por las noches. Lava tu cara con abundante agua. Luego aplica yougurth natural, dejálo hasta que lo soportes y  luego enjuaga. A veces si tienes piel muy sensible esto es menos de 5 minutos.<br>  Saludos y espero te sirvan mis recomendaciones!|`|8OygbU9Taa	segun estudios, dicen que la mejor crema para la belleza femenina es el cemen del hombre, suena gracioso esto a lo mejor, pero segun estos estudios, las celulas que companen al cemen son celulas que regeneran el cutis y la piel en general, ahora bien, lo que digo es por lo que lei de un estudio que se hiso y se comprovo buenos resultados en un laboratorio de mucho prestigio en cremas para la piel....|`|YcpDHJjCaa	yo tngo 25 y lo q hago es limpiarme bien la cara ma?ana y noche, echarme una buena crema antiarrugas pero q no sea demasiado fuerte porq aun pueden salir granos y un contorno de ojos q parece q no pero despues de usarlo un tiempo se notan los resultados. lo q tienes q hacer es cuidarte para evitar arrugas prematuras, manchas en la piel y marcas ya q estas ya se t quedan, las de la adolescencia se han ido quitando por regenarse la piel, pero ahora ya no se quitan tan facilmente. tb es conveniente no maquillarse demasiado porq estropea muchisimo el cutis, pero si t gusta maquillarte elige productos con doble funcion, es decir, q cuiden tu piel a la vez q la maquillan. exfoliarte la piel de vez en cuando y esas cosas. lo fundamental es limpiar e hidratar la piel a diario.|`|bcd3496fcf4584e7f977683f1247ed6eaa	Ha de ser limpiada, una vez antes de acostarse, y otra al levantarse. (Eso las mujeres de todas las edades) y además las mayores de 25 a?os, después de la limpieza, han de utilizar al menos, cremas hidratantes. <br>  Los que tienen el rostro de pizza, es porque tienen una hiper secreción de las glándulas sebáceas, y hace que se llenen los poros de espinillas, si encima la limpieza no es mucha, o es demasiada (más de tres veces al día, o con productos excesivamente fuertes), las bacterias hacen acto de presencia en estos taponados poros y dan lugar a los granos purulentos.<br>  Las limpiezas, pueden ser realizadas por líquidos de Clean & Clear, que son muy eficaces, y relativamente económicos.<br>  La marca Ponds tiene unas cremas, muy buenas, y relativamente económicas, para hidratar la piel (después de limpiada).|`|kTmAUkWAaa	hola amiga, tienes que desmaquillarte la cara tanto si te has puesto maquillage como si no. Prueba un dia que no lo hayas usado y limpiala con un algodon, este se volverá *****. Tienes que usar desmaquillador de ojos, leche limpiadora y tónico. por la ma?ana un contorno de ojos y una crema hidratante anitiarrugas y por la noche lo mismo pero cambiando la crema hidratante por una nutritiva. Tambien puedes usar un sérum por las ma?anas antes de ponerte la hidratante. <br>   Una vez por semana hazte un peeling seguido de una mascarilla. Un truco casero es ponerte un dia que estés relajada y puedas descansar, rodajas de fresa o pepinillo por la cara, o empapar un algodón con té verde y frotarlo suavemente por la cara. <br>   Pero ante todo, recuerda que los que tienen premio, són los que han sido constantes, y con la piel ese es el secreto, la constancia, SIEMPRE hay que desmaquillarse.<br>   un beso

Throw it out.  It's not worth it.  You probably have sensitive skin, in which case I would say READ LABELS of every make up you buy.  If you're going for a drugstore brand, I would say Almay is probably the best because it's noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic (look for both of these on the labels).  Neutrogena is also pretty good.  When in doubt look for makeup brands that also have skincare lines.  If they are known for skincare, chances are their cosmetics will be of good quality that takes skincare into account.  Loreal is also pretty good.  Perhaps you can look into their mineral foundations.<br>  <br>  I love Clinique best.  It's pricier because it's a department store brand,  but it works best on my sensitive skin.|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Yikes, sounds like you could be having a reaction. <br>  <br>  Try Almay's concealers and foundations. They're all hypo-allergenic. They come in tons of shades, and they're really good for your skin. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Covergirl is the worst for foundation and concealer. It always make people break out. I will recommend something like Bare Minerals or if that is too expensive maybe a cheaper mineral makeup. Or just make sure your makeup says the words "non-comedogenic" on it (most likely on the front since makeup companies like to advertise that info to get consumers to buy it). That means it does not clog pores. If it does not say the words then don't buy the makeup.|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	try for a hypoallergenic makeup like almay, its a little more expensive but its better for sensitive skin. Your skin may just be allergic to the ingredients in it.|`|AA10626996	Allergic reaction... Stop using it.|`|14IvGui8aa	Either you are wearing too much makeup or you are not wearing the right kind. If your foundation/concealer is too thick it will clog your pores. You will know you are wearing too much if it gets all cakey and you can totally see it. It is possible that you could be allergic to the type of makeup you use. Also you should not wear it for more than 8 hours without washing it off. I suggest a light mineral makeup if your problems do not go away. Good luck :)|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	You want to stop using this make up ASAP!!!  I suggest an inexpensive mineral make up like avon's or loreals if Bare Minerals is too pricey for you.   I have really sensitive skin, dry skin, oily patches, dark circles, and redness.  I use the mineral make up that is inexpensive- if it doesnt cover everything use a tighter brush (concealer brush) and dip it in the minerals then apply with a Kabuki brush.  GOOD LUCK!|`|LdlNMvsbaa	I guess it's not non-comedogenic make-up (make-up that won't clog pores. Try buying a coverup/foundation that will not clog your pores. May I recomend Bare Minerals makeup? It's truely amazing- it provides great coverup while actually clearing up your skin. (Doesn't come off during the day either.)<br>  <br>  For more of my advice, please check out my advice website and ask for help anytime :)<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/advicebuzz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/advicebuzz/</a>|`|YS5osEzFaa	It's probably just a reaction to the foundation. I use Neutrogena Skin Clearing foundation. It has salicylic acid, which helps clear your skin.|`|pj1NZfuxaa	I would try a different kind (not cover-girl) to see if your having an allergic reaction to the cover up or if your skin is just sensitive to all kinds.|`|BbwI6CJqaa	It could be that brand, try others and see what happens.  It does sound like you are allergic to that brand. <br>  <br>  Hope you have luck with the next one.|`|aCs7RxHUaa	Maybe you are alergic to it.

To my surprise, their makeup is actually really good quality, but definitely not the mascara.

P5CyGvZuaa	Liquid eyeliner is NOT supposed to go on your bottom lid.  Put it on your top lid instead and extend it out a bit.  The purpose is to make your eyelashes look thicker and give you a sexier, more almond-shaped eye which is one of the most attractive attributes of a woman.  If your goal is to make your eyes look more open, I would say skip the liquid eyeliner all together.  Instead, invest in a white stick eyeliner, a good mascara, and a good eyelash curler.  Curl and swipe mascara on your top lashes.  This will open your eyes more.  Put the white eyeliner on your bottom waterline.  This will make your eyes appear wider, brighter, and more refreshed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AktmOvVmaa	i really like the liquid. i started using it like 2 weeks ago, and i like it a lot better then a pencil or pen. those usually smudge at the end of the day, but my liquid does not. i warn you though, its harder to get off especially if you use waterproof. i have to use my makeup remover to touch it up after i apply it because i have not gotten good enough yet. ;)|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	don't use liquid eyeliner on the bottom of your eyes on the waterline.

lU8e0VQFaa	It will cost just as much if not more to buy a kit with everything you need to SAFELY pierce yourself at home, not to mention you don't have years of training to ensure that you are doing it correctly. Most likely you would need to be 18 as piercing minors without permission is illegal, but if you truly have permission, then just give your parents the money to pay for it. Some piercing shops will sell autoclaved needles and jewelry but they will definitely NOT sell it to a minor unless a parent is involved. Otherwise the internet will be your friend. I cannot stress enough the importance of research if you are that intent on doing this your self, hit the library and get a book on piercing, anatomy and cross contamination (you can probably also find it online, but usually I tend to trust books more in cases like this). Make sure your parent is home and aware of what you are doing so that if something happens they are there to call 911 (if required).<br>  <br>  I do however, commend you on at least knowing that a safety pin/sewing needle that's been "sterilized" with a lighter is unacceptable for piercing.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	remember in the Parent Trap? Just sterilize a needle with fire and go for it.. lol jk<br>  just go to a pro. You can get seriously infected|`|D6ZIfDiYaa	If you aren't medically trained in what it means to use sterile techniques or how to achieve them, no matter what type of kit you buy, you aren't going to be able to perform a sterile piercing.  <br>  <br>  Body art suppliers will not sell to minors (that can get them sued) and many won't even sell to anyone who isn't a licensed body piercer.

CqFUQt2oaa	As hair grows longer, it will get more mass. Therefore, the gravitational pull on your hair will be greater, and you'll start to lose a few more hairs each day.<br>  <br>  Either that, or your hair will flatten out and not look so bushy.|`|u18GBKmiaa	It means your hair will be less thicker as it flatter and not so bushy|`|85KrSJh3aa	www.howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution|`|WpUzboV1aa	To thin your hair does help it grow and will tame the frizzyness of it. You don't cut your hair when you thin it, a hair dresser takes a pair of scissors that have many slits in the blades and goes almost to your roots and then cuts, you do not lose length, just hair. Then she brushes your hair out and then hair she cut comes with it. This does not damage your hair and will not make it uneven. It will make it more manageable and will make it easier to grow out. I do it every few months to my hair, if I didn't, my hair would be a mess since I have very thick hair.|`|TZu1bixraa	thinning means the hairdresser will use special scissors which have a blade that is half missing so it cuts some hair but not all.<br>  <br>  since your hair is short its likely to stick out more but if you want it long it would be best to keep its thickness so its more versatile for styling once it gets longer.<br>  <br>  its also possible that thinning it now will mean it stays bushy for longer as it grows out, as the hairs that are cut will then be shorter... and shorter hair naturally sticks out more.<br>  <br>  you'd be best using styling products which will tame your hair for the moment there are loads of different types so it depends on the look you like to go for as to which one, but that way youll have plenty of hair to do what you want with when it gets long :) xxx|`|m60VYVl7aa	Ive had this done, my hairdresser uses a sort of blade, and runs it down your hair, so you get really thin layers, but they're so thin it really just gives the appeal of a less volumized hair. <br>  Its good for thick hair, and even if its not that "bushy". I really like the edgy look it gives mine, even though mine's already thin.<br>  <br>  -your welcome-|`|2niwR5rMaa	no no its good at first but it can make ur hair volumized and when it grows back its gnna grow back weird

vDky5V15aa	I use aquaphor by eucerine. I have used it since it came out and it works wonderfully on tattoos. It is also great for chapped lips, dry cracking hands, feet and it's safe to use as a diaper cream. <br>  <br>  My tattoo artist recommends it over any other product out there. Including tattoo goo.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	There is no 'best' - nobody can say what is best until they have tried everything. I'm sure there are many products that work very well. I can tell you what I use, which I've had 100% success with, and which everybody I know who uses it have also had 100% success - that is Bepanthan, it's a brand of nappy rash cream (I also use it on my son's bottom lol). I use it twice a day and it's great stuff, I've used this on all but the first of my tattoos, and they've all turned out absolutely perfectly. Not saying this is the only thing that works, but I can only share my experience, and I have no right to claim what's 'best' or not.<br>  <br>  As you've left it three days, can I assume you've scabbed quite a bit already? In this case, I would get some of whatever you choose fairly quickly, but you may also be okay to begin with an unscented moisturiser straight away if you prefer, as presumably most of the scabbing has taken place already. If you want to get some ointment first, you should switch to the moisturiser after a few days anyway. As long as it's unscented (for the first month or so) it doesn't really matter what brand - I use vaseline intensive care lotion which is great (not the same thing as vaseline petroleum jelly - this will suffocate your tattoo - I never understand people who use this!).|`|XrMMH5tZaa	there is no "best" thing<br>  because everyone is diff<br>  but most popular is a&d <br>  if ur like me and have sensitive skin try lubriderm sentless lotion<br>  cause a&d made me break out<br>  if not go for the a&d|`|AA12188347	NO petroleum based products!!  <br>  A plain white NON SCENTED lotion not creme....lotion.<br>  Thats all I have ever used on mine and they healed up awesomely and the tattoo on the top of my foot, which by the way isnt gauranteed and they said would most likely need touching up is perfectly fine and never been touched up and its been over a year........<br>  also dont soak it but its good to let water run GENTLY over the tattoo and dont do any rubbing ........|`|LBHJaqXoaa	A&D Ointment is the best for a new tattoo, but any good quality scent-free, dye-free lotion will also work. Try to stay away from lanolin and aloe and petroleum products like Vaseline.... they tend to be too heavy for the healing process and I have heard pure Aloe pulls color. Hope this helps!|`|Bv3Dm11paa	The only thing I ever use on my tattoos is Bepanthen Nipple Cream! It's all any tattoo artists recommend here too.|`|0CA5eNOCaa	Use some A & D ointment. U can find it in the baby section or the first aid section of any pharmacy store. The generic brand works just as fine. I think i read not to put any vaseline or neosporin on new tatts. also, no alcohol. my tattoo artist also said that a good hand lotion is fine, too. I used Tattoo Goo and A & D ointment on all mine.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	nothing with oil, or that smells.<br>  go for some straight up Aloe

LBHJaqXoaa	I know a few Catholics with tattoos. I don't think it's a sin. Why don't you ask your priest if it's a sin?|`|vDky5V15aa	Regardless of you religious beliefs, you should be absolutely certain that you want and can live with a tattoo. Tattoos are permanent body modifications and there is no room for impassivity when deciding on a tattoo. If you are at all conflicted, don't get one. <br>  <br>  I usually suggest that once someone decides to get a tattoo and have picked out a design, they wait a minimum of one year before getting it applied. If after a year, you still want that tattoo and are sure that it is right for you, then you are probably safe in getting it. <br>  <br>  I love tattoo's and am a huge advocate of the art. But, too many people have had bad experiences. Mostly as a result of immaturity, impulsive decision making, and ignorance about tattoos.     <br>  <br>  Forget about it for now, and revisit the issue once you have a better understanding. Also, you might want to consult your priest and get the churches official stance on the issue. That may help guide your decision.|`|H4dswqRlaa	I have seen tattoos which are satanic or angelic.

El chiste es que las zonas problemáticas sean bien impregnadas antes del lavado.<br>  Verás como se va el olor y las manchas.<br>  Saludos y suerte!|`|58d996374de7af7c70413ec02724903aaa	Si le hechas suavizante no seas tan agarrad@ y hechale un chorro mas largo.

SDHvDNGJaa	Pues mira, no se si una crema, pero si se que hay recetas ancestrales que sirven mucho y no son tan caras. Escoge en el supermercado o en el mercado un buen pepino. Pártelo en rodajas. Ponte una rodaja en cada ojo. Déjalo allí todo el tiempo que aguantes, empieza por diez minutos. Puedes cambiar varias veces la rodaja de pepino, las que aguantes y creas necesarias. Este tratamiento te baja las ojeras y además te deja una sensación de frescura y ojos descansados. Inténtalo y te sale muy barato. Suerte!|`|e09f027914b35f80ead6af67e5fc679eaa	SOLUCIONES NATURALES<br>  * Rallar una patata con su piel bien limpia y una manzana verde. Mezclar bien y a?adir unas gotas de hamamelis.

Seguramente si tu usas la ropa apretada, tus pantalones por ejemplo, el simple roce de tu ropa provoca que tu piel se oscurezca en esa zona. A muchos nos pasa, por ejemplo en la zona de la cintura, o bien en la entrepierna con el roce de los resortes que ajustan tu ropa interior. Para evitar esto, puedes usar por las noches crema de concha nácar y en las ma?anas lavárte muy bien. Espero que así se te aclare esa zona de tu piel y procura usar menos apretada tu ropa.<br>  Suerte!|`|3cd05f16a165c9e57b3b7ed4bd60bd08aa	quien sabe...<br>  seguro no le hechas jabon!|`|AopkjK8xaa	no manches wuey si te la jalaste...si nunca te limpiabas esa zona a la hora del ba?o ese color ya no se te quitara...eso si es en toda la region de las nalgas..AHORA QUE SI ES EN LA REGION DEL * asterisco* del uyuyuy..o como quieras llamarle ,.la coloracion se debe a los frijoles que ti?en la salida cuando defecas ...y si hay metodos para blanquearlo pero son muy caros..jajajajaja|`|kYWljwIiaa	jajjaa  pues ba?ate seguido es muy  benefico para la saluda ba?arse a diario no se por que no lo  haces otra pregunta como alcanzas  a verle las nalgas? o te dijo tu pareja??? que pena si fue por que te dijeron|`|1a19d4894c6c8eda7f6e927920e8f070aa	no mames wey, que pedo hasta ahorita te viste en el espejo o que tranza, pues usa una piedra de rio si sientes que es mugre por no ba?arte.

SDHvDNGJaa	Puedes usar una mascarilla hecha con yougurt natural, aplícala en la noche por 20 minutos, o lo que aguantes y luego enjuaga con abundante agua tibia, después pon tu crema humectante favorita.<br>  Si no tienes yougurt natural, puedes conseguir crema de concha nácar y aplicar pero solo en la zona de las manchitas. Pero hazlo solo por las noches...<br>  Si tampoco consigues esto, puedes hacer una pasta con un poco de azucar y limón, y aplica una mascarilla, con las yemas de tus dedos haz ligeros masajes redondos. Espera 10 o 20 min y luego enjuaga con agua tibia de forma abundante, al final aplica tu crema humectante favorita, esto también solo házlo por la noche..<br>  Y por último, si consigues gel de baba de caracol, es maravilloso y lo puedes usar de ma?ana, tarde o noche, lo estoy probando y realmente da muy buenos resultados!<br>  Suerte y saludos, que se eliminen esas manchitas!|`|OxDEeRiDaa	con crema de concha nacar Te la aplicas po las noches creo que la venden en farmacias o tiendas naturistas ok|`|qJQ27kVoaa	Andale....

xR2oJzHxaa	en realidad el hombre se siente siempre mas atraido por lo sexual, y generalmente este tipo de chicas estan dispuesto a todo en una cita, cosa que generalmente el resto de las mujeres nos hacemos esperar un poquito para entregarnos en cuerpo y alma al ser querido. De todos modos las mujeres pensamos y accionamos distinto, somos mas cautelosas a la hora de elegir pareja y cuando nos entregamos a alguien queremos que ese momento sea "especial". En cambio el hombre es mas instintivo y se deja llevar por sus impulsos, por eso hay veces que hay detalles que ellos olvidan y que para nosotras son importante. Por ese motivo, por ser mas sexuales, es que se sienten mas atraidos hacia las mujeres mas faciles, pero ellos saben que no es para tener algo serio!!! Asi que no te preocupes que si tienen que elegir aquella mujer que va a ser su esposa y la madre de sus hijos se van a fijar en una mujer con TODAS LAS LETRAS!!! suerteee|`|Dpj47yJeaa	hay  xk  el hombre  es  mas  del lado  sexual  y  la mujer  es  mas  sentimental , pero  las mujere  tambien  tienen que reconocer  que  les  gustan los  hombres  golfos  o  llamemoslo   rudo y  no  los  ni?os  mensos   yo  como  hombre me  gustan las  chavas   asi locochonas pero para  un rato  ( sin  ofender ) pero  ya  para  una  relacion  estable  mas que  obio  se prefiere  a una  chava   desente  si  se puede  virgen  pues  que mejor .  y  las mujeres no  ellas prefieren  al 100  los  chavos  super  rudos   por  fuera  pero  bien  tiernos  por dentro  digamos  un buen  amante   cari?oso  y  tierno por dentro  pero   por  fuera  alguien  rudo  malo  y  todo  eso  alguien   conquien se  sientan protegidas pero  ala vez  amadas   alguien  que presumir|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Jajaja, por la libertad que tienen y aparentan, no son vulgares, solamente extrovertidas!!!<br>  Saludos!|`|lLAHw9q2aa	es que siempre nos gustaron las mas perras!!!|`|216d4b49fc4873685d8e31155e364adbaa	Yo creo que a pesar de que son vulgares son bonitas en el caso de parís son mujeres atractivas y sexis el problema es que a los hombres les gustan las mujeres así entre mas ense?en mejor, aunque algunos estén casados con chicas que no sean tan extrovertidas ellos fantasean con las chicas como las que mencionas.<br>  Unos amigos me han dicho que ellos prefieren para casarse a las chicas tranquilas inteligentes y que no sean facilitas, sin embargo no dejan de pensar en las otras chicas que son fáciles de atrapar. <br>  <br>  Suerte|`|4377df15372f3e839bc1801be2904948aa	es porque son mas desinhibidas, ese tipo de mujeres están dispuestas al sexo en cualquier forma y cualquier lugar. eso las hace mas atractivas, pero de una forma animal. una combinación de puritana y prostituta es lo que un hombre debe tener en su casa para no buscar fuera. puedes intentarlo, solo platica con tu pareja.|`|TeQg6vcqaa	Porque ellas nos permiten realizar las mas osadas fantasias sexuales que una mujer decente o criada de una manera pulcra y decente jamas lo haria.|`|WXul1A3Haa	porque los hombres son muy tontos y obviamente las vulgares como son mas dejadas pues los hombres se van con ellas pero no se dan cuenta de que una chica mas decente puede hacer sexo iwal ke la perra solo que no lo demuestra tantoademas las golfas no valen la pena no sean pendejos chav0s|`|pPrYlFdfaa	ES AL REVES, las mujeres les atraen los hombres mas GAMINES, esta comprovado cientificamente.|`|bfe00a4909187aed8d4abe299c7d8be0aa	jajajaja  no todos tienen mal gusto amiga|`|2b2e21e0f5080928b722ae40307111e7aa	nunca me ratonie con ellas<br>  <br>  además, sólo seria algo casual jajaja!!! o por intere$ jaja pero no me importan

LwdOUBHGaa	Me parece que las emociones son cruciales en la vida e influyen en la belleza, ya que muchas veces las emociones afectan nuestro estado de animo y a la vez pueden deteriorarnos en forma de enfermedad ya sea física o emocional, por esto se debe tener una actitud positiva ante emociones desagradables porque por más que queramos esconderlo ellas si realmente nos afectan inconscientemente.con respecto a la pareja debería uno sentir amor hacia ella ,por que es el único remedio que puede sanar nos como persona y darnos la verdadera felicidad ,sabemos también que las personas que reflejan amor ya sea así mismas o al prójimo,son las personas que son bellas por dentro y por fuera.-|`|4kCgaQhHaa	las emosiones van de la mano de los estados de animo hay momentos en los que estamos tristes y no nos pro boca salir ni arreglarnos y hay momentos en los que nos sentimos felices y queremos comernos el mundo, ponernos nuestra mejor gala y por que no una sonrisa que irradie alegría. la felicidad es vida  y la vida es belleza cuando se siente con verdadera pasión y amor. no necesitamos tener a nadie a nuestro lado para sentirnos felices la belleza empieza por querernos  y aceptarnos tal como somos, en la medida en que internalicemos esto seremos felices, aremos felices a los demás y por ende de actitud positiva y de belleza ante los demás.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Mucho, la belleza es el espejo del alma!|`|CRFYQmLvaa	Yo creo que influye mucho porque se dice que como te sientes es como te ven... asi que imaginate.. una persona muy segura de si misma, que es feliz... imagina lo que proyecta.. claro que se ve lindísima...<br>  pero estoy de acuerdo con eso.... yo me casé y  nunca nadie me ha hecho un comentario de que me vea mal o que haya un cambio para mal... al contrario!!!<br>  saludos|`|DrYFDgsUaa	Cuando alguien  es feliz, se le nota en la cara, ella está enamorada, es feliz. entonces se dice "le sienta el matrimonio". Pero se alguien se casa, y encambio de ser feliz, sufre, no tiene cari?o, todo es una pesadilla "el matrimonio NO le sienta". Notás la diferencia?    Besos.....|`|FlkdiLRWaa	Cari?o las emociones influyen muchisimo en la belleza ya q tu te ves según como te sientas, tu aspecto exterior es solo un reflejo de lo q eres por dentro... seguramente su felicidad le permite sentirse mejor consigo misma y esto no solo le permite dibujarse una sonrisa en sus labios si no q tambien le proporciona el autoestima suficiente para cuidarse mas, hacer ejercicio, alimentarse mejor, maquillarse mas linda.. entro otros...<br>  Espero haberte ayudado...|`|nE7OZIAlaa	Compa?ero hay algo que se llama energia, mientras que tus energias sean positivas y esto es generado por tus estados emocionales uno mejoro en todos los ambitos, pero si te rodeas de energia negativa producida por tus emociones entonces desmejoraras en muchos ambitos y en este caso afecta tu exterior  e interior. En fin si afecta o mejora mucha tu fisico|`|uW13Vseyaa	Pienso que como uno se siente es como se muestra ante el mundo. Mucha gente trata de ocultar emociones y sentimientos pero eso al final es imposible, uno mismo se delata. No hay nada mejor para verse bello que sentirse bien con uno mismo y con los demás.

Yo fui estudiante de medicina y el hospital de especialidades dermatologicas el "Dermatologico de Pascua" es lo MEJOR que existe en Mexico, obviamente es gubernamental pero por lo mismo es baratisimo y no hay falla, estan los mejores dermatologos del pais. TODOS los dermatologos si no es que la mayoria han pasado alguna vez por ahi. Si vas con uno particular, seguramente te va a cobrar mucho y el mismo trabajo te pueden hacer aqui por un centimo del precio. Lo malo es que tiene mucha demanda y tienes que sacar lugar como desde las 6 am formandote.

Y por no usar protector solar. El sol y las camas solares tienen el mismo efecto. <br>  Si tus lunares tienen el aspecto que te describi, no dudes ni un instante en consultar a un especialista.  <br>  No  es que quiera asustarte, pero el cáncer de piel es un tema de moda en estos días. Y siempre es mejor descartar esta posibilidad.  <br>  Averigua en varios especialistas ′′Buenos′′. Pregunta precios. Y no des tantas vueltas. Hacete tratar lo antes posible. <br>  La operación dura unos minutos, nada más. Ojalá pudiese darte precios. Pero no soy de mexico. Asique solo te puedo dar algunos concejos. Y desearte mucha suerte.|`|tFpKNkkJaa	a′quí en costa rica si tu lunar es muy grande te lo quitan en la clinica y de gratis, a mi papa le quitaron uno

Prácticamente sin darnos cuenta, cambiamos de aroma según el estado de ánimo o de momento del día. En ocasiones despertamos llenas de energía y buscamos un aroma suave y ligero; otras veces, nos sentimos seductoras y nos inclinamos por aromas amaderados e intenso.

Además agregaban al huevo unas gotas de aceite de oliva. Esto lo fortalece. Tratá de evitar la grasitud del cuero cabelludo enjuagándolo con té de ortiga, porque la grasitud hace que se afine y debilite. También el té de romero es excelente para el crecimiento. Sirve para enjuagarte y te da brillo. Hay unas pastillas que son para el crecimiento del cabello y de las u?as. Se llaman Megacistin y tienen L-cistina y Piridoxina HCI. El cabello se fortalece y crece rapidísimo. La vitamina B6 también sirve.

Recuéstate 20 minutos, luego quita las rodajas de pepino y enjuaga con agua tibia. También puedes usar rayadura de papa. Pónla sobre tus ojeras, espera 20 minutos en reposo y luego enjuaga con agua tibia. Y puedes luego usar también una mascarilla de yougurt natural. Igual, lava tu hermoso rostro, luego aplica el yougurt natural en tu cara con las yemas de tus dedos. Espera 20 minutos en reposo, luego enjuaga con agua tibia y listo.

Por ultimo, no fumes ni te rodees de gente que lo haga, has ejercicio y empezaras a notar cambios muy favorables, ponte una mascarilla de miel de abeja cada tres o cuatro días por el resto de tu vida y prepara te de manzanilla para que uses las bolsitas bien frías para ponertelas sobre tus ojos mientras te pones la mascarilla de miel, eso relaja mucho y sentirás un gran cambio.|`|85da4381cffff8429996564a10092045aa	Un nuevo truco para quitar las ojeras es meter una cucharara al freezer hasta que estén bien frías luego póntelas en los ojos..

Yo te aconsejo que compres corrector en barra marca loreal, de un tono más claro que tu piel, para borrar las ojeras y además uses polvo traslúcido, (no compacto) sino hecho polvo, y lo pongas en toda tu cara con la motita o brocha. Veras que con eso es suficiente y no te saldrán arrugas porque no son pesados para la piel. Espero esto te ayude.|`|FlkdiLRWaa	Cari?o calmate un poco no te deprimas.... mira... utiliza maquillahe de marca reconocida `ya q aunq son un poco mas costosos la verdad es q están mejor fabricados con ingrediente cada vez menos nocivos....<br>  Maquíllate natural, en lo particular yo a diario solo uso base cob fps, un poco de blus (por cierto mi blush es cover girl y me encanta) y gloss es todo... y cuando vas a una fiesta pues tratas de lucir mas...<br>  Usa tu corrector pero úsalo de marca, lee las características del producto y no te sientas mal....<br>  La belleza externa no lo es todo... pon tu mejor sonrisa y serás sin duda la mas hermosa...|`|IAOUilwuaa	Bueno, empezamos, las ojeras se pueden tapar con un corrector blanco, usalo debajo del maquillaje, después puedes comprar el maquillaje de LOREA'L que es en crema pero se siente como polvo, y en cuanto a que hace da?o y envejeses pronto....Yo tengo 40 a?os y 23 a?os usando maquillaje y no he dado el VIEJAZO.

Las mismas actrices, que slen espléndidas en cada una de la sproducciones que protagonizan se maquillan y lo hacen por obligación, porque si no creeme que no saldrían tan bonitas. Por tanto, ante todo, quítate esos complejos que no sirven para nada, quiérete a ti misma y, luego, utiliza esos productos de cosmética que no hacen da?o. <br>  Así, te doy un consejo: utiliza siempre cremas hidratantes antes y después del maquillaje.

Como es muy difícil ponerlo todo aquí, te pongo una serie de páginas web con ejercicios y dietas y unas recomendaciones que creo que te serán muy útiles. No hay nada milagroso, lo siento. Todo requiere un poco de esfuerzo, con fuerza de voluntad y haciéndolo realmente TODO es efectivo.<br>  Empecemos por el ejercicio. Aquí tienes las dos mejores tablas de ejercicios para lo que tú me pides.<br>  Lo primero es empezar estirando, unos buenos estiramientos son estos:<br>  <a href="http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria.jhtml?ID_CATEGORIA=3409&RUTA=1-3-65-271-3409&ABRIR_SECCION=3&ALEATORIO=PMDRPMQWAEDRPMDRQWQW" rel="nofollow">http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria....</a><br>  Después, puedes hacer cada día una tabla de ejercicios. No hagas las dos en un mismo día. La primera es esta, para todo el cuerpo. Te recomiendo que la hagas 4-5 veces a la semana:<br>  <a href="http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria.jhtml?ID_CATEGORIA=102669&RUTA=1-3-65-271-102669&ABRIR_SECCION=3&ALEATORIO=YXPMYXKVAEGSDRHKGS" rel="nofollow">http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria....</a><br>  Y la segunda tabla es esta, especializada en el abdomen (la tripita), que te recomiendo que hagas 2-3 veces a la semana:<br>  <a href="http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria.jhtml?ID_CATEGORIA=3409&RUTA=1-3-65-271-3409&ABRIR_SECCION=3&ALEATORIO=PMDRPMQWAEDRPMDRQWQW" rel="nofollow">http://www.pulevasalud.com/subcategoria....</a><br>  <br>  En cuanto a nutrición, lo mejor es que te ponga una dieta un especialista, para lo que te recomiendo NaturHouse, pero si quieres algo básico y efectivo te recomiendo que sigas la dieta de los 14 días, que sale en este foro en el tercer o cuarto comentario. Es realmente efectiva y además muy saludable =D, no cuesta mucho de seguir pero claro, hay que seguirla estrictamente:<br>  <a href="http://foro.adelgazar.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5132" rel="nofollow">http://foro.adelgazar.net/phpBB2/viewtop...</a><br>  Por último, te recomiendo combinar esto con ir al gimnasio una o dos horas por semanas a hacer aquagym, cinta de correr, bicicleta y natación (lo mejor es braza y croll).<br>  <br>  En cuanto a medicamentos, lo mejor son las láminas saciantes de Comodynes, que encontrarás en cualquier farmacia, que te ayudan a calmar el apetito. Respecto a pastillas, solo conozco unas que sean realmente adelgazantes: las Xenical, y cuestan 100€ la caja, así que no malgastes el dinero en las demás cosas que puedas encontrar y o compra estas, o las láminas saciantes.. o simplemente haz tu dieta y ejercicios =).<br>  <br>  Puesto que vas a adelgazar, te recomiendo que utilices una crema anti-estrías en la tripa, la cara interior de los muslos y las caderas.<br>  <br>  Y nada más chico, suerte y no te sulfures, que no hay prisa: mejor adelgazar paso a paso y como se debe, que hacerlo fugazmente y ver regresar tus kilos igual de rápido.|`|XBd7D21waa	Trata de comer mas proteina y menos grasa y carbohidratos, has las tres comidas fuertes al dia y a media ma?ana y media trde come una fruta o una gelatina, algo ligero, consume muchas verduras y frutas.<br>  <br>  Para las pompas....sentadillas!!|`|XW2vFTOQaa	creo que no hay nada mas efectivo y sobre todo seguro que hacer ejercicio y evitar los carbohidratos.<br>  Sin ejercicio no vas a lograr nada, y si comes muchisima azúcar tampoco.|`|tnbB8NJoaa	oie creo k el alimento seria bueno mucha papa pero no en exceso de preferencia sin grasa para k adelgaces i tmb muchas sentadillas

SDHvDNGJaa	Mira hay varias formas de eliminar manchas. Una es tomar un poco de yougurt natural y ponerte una mascarilla con el sobre tu cara bien limpia. Déjala actuar por 20 minutos y luego enjuaga con abundante agua tibia. Seca y ponte tu crema de noche preferida. No te expongas mucho al sol. Otra forma es toma un poco de miel de abeja, a?ádele un poco de limón. Haz una mascarilla nocturna, aplícala con la yema de tus dedos, frotando ligeramente tu piel. Déjala por 20 minutos y enjuaga con agua tibia abundante. Tampoco te expongas mucho al sol después de tu tratamiento. Pues el sol induce la producción de melanina y la formación de manchas. Suerte y que quedes muy bella. Estas mascarillas las puedes aplicar una vez a la semana, puedes inclusive alternarlas.|`|dN4Itku3aa	Un buen peeling pero hecho por un buen dermatólogo|`|BC6rLW8haa	las cremas que compras son de descamacion minima. devea ir a un dermatologo a que te haga ona profunda con acidos , con punta de diamante o con bisturi( te raspan la piel con un bisturi) asi quitaran las capas mas profundas de la piel que es donde esta manchada. haz el tratamiento en invierno ,son varias las opciones pero debes hacerlo con un profecional , de otra manera estaras tirando dinero sin los resultados que verdaderamente esperas.|`|nz3UYQApaa	De acuerdo con Rosaura L.

ObMIH2nOaa	Yo tengo un piercing en el labio, 2 en cada oreja, uno en el ombligo y 2 tatuajes ocultos que me gustan mucho, el primero me lo hice por alguien a kien amo, el segundo por diversion, pero me he arrepentido un poco por el segundo, puesto ke no tiene ningun significado en especial, me kisiera hacer otro en la baja espalda solo por estetica pero no estoy segura, pues conforme voy madurando me he dado cuenta de ke debo respetar mas mi cuerpo y que tendre que lidiar con los comentarios de mi familia ke son muy conservadores. <br>  Hace una semana me kite los de las orejas, solo me deje los 2 del lobulo, hoy en la ma?ana desperte y me dieron ganas de quitarme el del labio, me sentia muy rebelde pero no c porke ya no me senti agusto. <br>  Yo creo ke deberias dejar que esta persona haga con su cuerpo lo que guste, siempre y cuando no sea algo de lo que se vaya a arrepentir toda la vida, recuerdale que los piercings se pueden retirar cuando guste, pero los expansivos y los tatuajes son para siempre, si es alguien de tu familia, apoyalo para ke se haga un piercing, hasta dale el dinero y llevalo a un lugar donde veas que son higienicos, asi no lo hara solo por rebeldia, si es joven como yo, seguramente despues de unos meses terminara aburriendose de el y se lo kitara, debe experimental por si mismo el rechazo social al que te refieres, que por supuesto no creo ke este justificado, pues lo que vale es la persona, no su apariencia.

Después matizas al color que tú quieras, o lo dejas así. No te va a quedar rubio.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pues mira, para quitarlo de lleno, pinta tu pelo del color que desees. Si no quieres te?irlo todo puedes intentar pintar solo mechas y tendrás un efecto diferente, disimulando el color negro que te disgusta.

Por lo cual la única solución probable que veo es volverlo a pintar.<br>  Saludos!|`|4WHEMgvFaa	Mucha gente tiene resultados desastrosos con la henna. La henna no solo penetra en el cabello, también tiene resultados impredecibles para muchas. Como ya te paso la tragedia, ahora ya  aprendiste a apreciar tu cabello.<br>  Te voy a dar el viejo consejo del aceite mineral:<br>  Alguien me dio este consejo para aminorar el color de la henna y hasta lo puede quitar.<br>  1.Satura las mechas del cabello con alcohol al 70% (o de 70 grados) y aplicalo con bolitas de algodon EVITA el cuero cabelludo.<br>  2. Espera de 5-10 minutos y despues aplica aceite mineral encima del alcohol. EVITA otra vez el area del cuero cabelludo.<br>  3. Cubre tu aceitoso cabello con una gorra de plastico o algun plastico similar.  <br>  4. Ponte debajo de una secadora de cabello de esas que usan en los salones de belleza o si no pues usa la tuya por 30-45 minutos. <br>  5. Para quitar el aceite y PRIMERO impregna el cabello con shampoo, antes de ponerle agua. luego lavalo, necesitaras lavarlo mas de una vez para quitar el aceite y la henna. Repite todo el procedimiento si es necesario.<br>  6. Cuando hayas quitado toda la henna, asegurate de ponerte un buen acondicionador o un tratamiento de acondicionamiento profundo para restablecer la humedad del cabello.<br>  Cuando tengas dudas de los resultados de un procedimiento en el cabello, mejor no lo hagas, tomate tu tiempo e investiga.|`|JEBTGqWMaa	el tinte negro es muy difícil de quitar pero se puede hacer .te sugiero que vayas a una peluquería .espero que vas a solucionar tu problema.<br>  saludos!|`|zWGbzDqVaa	todos los tintes tienen una duración hasta que se vuelva a empezar a ver la raíz, lo malo es que luego se te queda el tinte hasta que el pelo crezca y lo vayas cortando. como eso queda algo mal tendemos a te?ir nos el pelo de otro color o del mismo. al ser semi vegetal seguro que es menos agresivo y quizás dure menos pero la solución pienso que es te?ir lo de otro color. Quizás lavandolo a menudo consigas que se vaya antes. no se si te habré ayudado, suerte ;)
