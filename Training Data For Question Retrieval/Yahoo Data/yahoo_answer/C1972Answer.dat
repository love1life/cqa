694bff6930252c5c87075cf1a039938caa	The two most important things I look for are:<br>  <br>  1) Are their contact details street address etc on the website?<br>  2) Do other web sites give them good reviews<br>  <br>  Looking around their web site, at <a href="http://www.digicombos.com/camera-shop/static/contact/1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digicombos.com/camera-shop/st...</a> I found their phone number, street address etc. So that is a good thing. Shows they aren't hiding from anyone.<br>  <br>  A great site to check for the reputation of online vendors is reseller ratings. Looking up digicombos I found this page: <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/store/DigiCombos" rel="nofollow">http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Dig...</a> the reviews are a mixed bag. Given that some people are basically saying they are dishonest, I would be inclined not to deal with them. However read the reviews in detail and form your own opinion.<br>  <br>  teef_au

AQ4b4Iilaa	Neither, you should be getting a Sony A200, compare their features and don't be suckered into buying a Nikon because it is a Nikon.<br>  <br>  After buying the Sony, go to eBay and buy some 20 year old Minolta AF lenses for it, unlike the D40 which can not use old Nikon lenses (you'll be stuck in manual), old lenses from film SLRs will work properly on the Sony.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	I recommend that you bypass all of them, and get the Nikon D60. The Nikon D40x is the exact same camera as the D60 except the D60 has a self-cleaning sensor, and i don't believe that the D40x does. A self cleaning sensor is definitely important, seeing as attempting it yourself can be mildly dangerous. i would say the D60 is the clear winner. You can get it for a really good price on <a href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com</a> that is where i always buy my cameras, and my lenses, and i am always happy with their service, etc. Get the Nikon D60|`|d55HYaktaa	The Nikon D40 has bigger pixels (6Mp vs 10Mp), and hybrid eletronic-mecanical shutter that provides a flash sync of 1/500s, and the base sensitivity is ISO 200.<br>  <br>  The only advantage of the D40x may be the VR lens... but anyway the D60 replaced it and has a better firmware, dust reduction and dynamic range optimizer.<br>  <br>  You should buy the D40 instead of the D40x, and an external flash too (SB-400 or SB-600).|`|HX6JjCTyaa	If you are looking for an easy to use DSLR which take excellent photos I would definitely recommend D60 over D40x.unless you are saving a couple of hundred dollars or more then go with D40 which is an excellent camera and should now be even cheaper. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OGF6Q?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0012OGF6Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OG...</a>|`|mhQbtz1Yaa	Canon Powershot SD790 IS

For repairs in Canada, please allow 14-21 business days from the time we receive the product, to when the product is back to you. The times listed above do not include the time it takes for the product to get to Nintendo.<br>  <br>  That comes straight from the nintendo website, but of course that is just an estimate. You could possibly get yours back sooner since you live closer to the facility|`|AtLdnZd5aa	you will never get it back. that is a government conspiracy. they are collecting as many wii's as they can from stupid little kids then they are gonna put them all together and tie them to a wii mote and nun chuck that will be placed in barrack obama's office. this way he can control a huge wii bot and take over the world. also this is why the cod waw was created to turn wiis into a war machine. but they don't realize that the wii's will become self aware and start a new world war. and finally in the year 2278 they will send a robot back in time to give president Schwarzenegger a warning message, but they will over shoot their target and he will get the message too early and make the terminator movies instead.|`|hwaTOBL7aa	OMG i live in Washington too man.

PDLSQj2qaa	It depends what way you use to connect to the internet. Either Dial-Up, Router, or Modem. I use modem and it works pretty fine. The modem comes with the AT&T Plan of Home, Cell Phone, Dish, and Internet.<br>        1. If you have an AT&T Modem!! Go To Settings.<br>        2. Go to Wi-Fi [1st Row on top.]<br>        3. Pick your network. <br>  For example, if you have the AT&T Modem it will read like this:<br>  2WIRE###. The number sign is the type of modem you have. Hope this helps!! Bye!! Have a good day. ;) :)|`|NPFuyuKiaa	Yeah, u need the password though, if u don't know it look foe the code on the side of the modem, router, if that doesn't work call ur internet provider,they should know it|`|CMrt9xIkaa	yes as long as you know the password

TwIK4Ivlaa	The card seems corrupt. <br>  <br>  You can try reading off the card using linux if you have it installed. If not just boot from a 'knoppix' disc (free software) and see if you can copy the files.<br>  <br>  If you still get the error, use a file recovery program to save all the photos that you can.<br>  <br>  Don't insert the card back into your camera till you have saved the photos. After that try if your camera can read the photos. If it can, then connect the camera using the supplied cable to the computer and save whatever photos you could not save earlier.<br>  <br>  In future, always format your card before starting to use it and everytime after saving the photos to your computer. Never delete any photos on your card directly. Do it through your computer.

SKkE3fK1aa	3G is a type of connection to a network. It is faster connection than GSM (its the one before 3G, aka '2G'). With 3G you can<br>  <br>  1.) Surf the internet faster on your phone using your network (364kbps - 1.5 mbps)<br>  <br>  2.) Use Video Calling<br>  <br>  Well, those 2 are the mostly used features of 3G. Remember, if your phone says that it supports 3G, and your NETWORK is not in 3G, then it will be useless to have a 3G phone. 3G features are only if your network allows you. So if you are on a contract, make use of the Data Plans, MMS, Video Calling, etc.

jLTDqVHsaa	Just making sure we're on the same page - your cable comes through a box that's plugged into your TV, correct?  The new remote turns the cable box on/off, and changes the cable channels.  You still have the old remote, but it doesn't change cable channels; it changes TV channels, which means you can't see the cable anymore.<br>  <br>  If all of the above is correct, then.......<br>  <br>  Just use the old remote to tune the TV to 00 for PS2, and when you're done, switch it back to 03 to go back to cable.  Plug the PS2 into your TV as you always have; you're still using the same TV, correct?<br>  <br>  So, do the following:<br>  -Leave the cable hookup the way it is.<br>  -Plug the PS2 in front of the TV as you always have.  Tune TV to 00 using your TV remote.  You should see your PS2.  Your cable is still working, your TV has just been switched to another channel, that's all.<br>  -When finished with your PS2, use that old remote to switch your TV back to 03, and your cable will be there.<br>  <br>  When you want to change cable channels, use the new remote while the TV is on 03.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions or want anything cleared up, feel free to ask!  I know it can be confusing when you have some new connections hooked up, but you just have to plan it out, that's all.|`|lhzpq7ATaa	Try plugging the yellow and white cables from your PS2 into your cable box, not your TV.

STAY AWAY!  PLEASE!<br>  <br>  First, it takes a long time to even find their address on their site, and when I found it, it turns out that as I suspected, they were one of a bunch of linked scamming outfits with Brooklyn addresses.  This particular one is located here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=337+e+89th+st,+brooklyn&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=59.467068,135.351563&ie=UTF8&z=17&iwloc=addr&layer=c&cbll=40.647306,-73.91516&panoid=KCjv-mxTApICSPI4zzG4zg&cbp=12,323.60620869573734,,0,3.91586399776097" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s...</a><br>  <br>  That's the address from the site.  Doesn't exactly look like somewhere I want to go to buy a camera.<br>  <br>  Here's the routine: you call, you place an order.  They pressure you hard to buy "upgrades," which are really parts that the manufacturer includes.  Buy the upgrades, and your price is equal to or higher than the regular retail price.  Choose not to buy the upgrades, and you'll either get some really cheap parts, or you'll find that your product is mysteriously "not in stock," but only AFTER you place your order and give them your credit-card information.<br>  <br>  Not worth the hassle.  They even go so far as to plant good reviews on review sites to make it look like they're legit.<br>  <br>  Hey, how about we check the Better Business Bureau, right?  Well, they are NOT BBB-accredited.  Then, go and look at their listing.  WOW, look at how many different names they have!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.aspx?pid=44&page=1&id=68047" rel="nofollow">http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.as...</a><br>  <br>  Then, look at the descriptions!  Abusive!  Unsatisfactory!  HUNDREDS of complaints, many of them never resolved!  And I won't even get into specific customer horror stories, you can search for them easily enough yourself.  In short, THEY SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS!<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and go to a place like B&H.  MUCH better with customer service, and I plan on making all of my big video equipment purchases there over the years.  Their prices are still VERY competitive.  Then, their BBB profile.  Much nicer, and only a fraction of the complaints:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.aspx?id=429&pid=44&page=0&FindStr=b%26H&SearchBy=company&Address=&City=&Phone1=&Phone2=&Phone3=&MembersOnly=False" rel="nofollow">http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.as...</a><br>  <br>  I've made all my big video purchases there (except for a demo-unit camera from another reputable dealer I discovered after a lot of research).  They have been great, and I never hesitate to buy from them.  Great store, I'm like a kid in a candy store in there.  It's easy for me as it's a subway ride away, but they ship as well.<br>  <br>  Good job asking questions when you didn't feel right.  Turns out your fears had a whole lot of merit.

Good luck!|`|9YWvGTjuaa	THE SIMS 2 or 1!!!
eTLOZkZwaa	Umm you would actually have to go lime wire it really good i thought it was really hard to use it but i found it really easy you just have to download it and most interesting fact about it is it can go through the internet and the music you want or you can go to this link<br>  www.spiralfrog.com and this way you just have to make an ccount no need to download anything <br>  Thanks <br>  I am really looking for best answer <br>  Thanks again|`|3Ndk5RHXaa	Limewire is illegal and it is loaded with viruses. The same goes for all the other "free" music sites and programs.<br>  <br>  Just buy your music, you can get heavily fined if you are caught with illegal music.|`|Iqjm4zLsaa	Limewires great.<br>  <br>  Or frostwire, frost wire might mess up your pc though.|`|TtvCFolNaa	Limewire illegal but nobody cares yet its really bad to get caught...But the other places besides Limewire are all places that you have to pay a monthly fee and have a TON of crap thats messes up your computer(which is stupid)...I wouldn't recommend buying movies off Limewire just because it's way easier to get caught because theres warnings and stuff...if you wanted to rent a movie off iTunes (which means, once you start watching the movie, you have 24 hrs. or so to finish it) and thats what I normaly do. iTunes also has a diffrent free song each week or so and $1.00 rentals (best pick). Hope this helped!|`|AgsU0Eyvaa	Limewire is slow and loaded with viruses, <br>  torrents are much better,<br>  look for a quick tutorial.

c3b645N5aa	Stickam.com, ustream.com justin.tv, there are lots of places<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get caller audio would probably be to use Skype, you could always buy an adapter to plug your phone directly into your computer's sound card, but that'd almost be more trouble than it's worth.<br>  <br>  edit: the adapter will vary from phone to phone. If it's a cell phone than you'll want to see if you can use the phone's data cable and the included software for going through the computer. If you're using an analog phone than you'll need to take it to Radio Shack or somewhere and ask them if they have anything for you specific model.
3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	Journey to the centre of the earth in 3D. You should not have to adjust the tint, just use regular settings, 3D movies are generally blurry and not perfect. I watched this one last week and it takes a while to get used to it, in fact I remember feeling a little motion sickness at various points during the movie, but it was a riot !<br>  <br>  P.S. There are two versions of most 3D movies on the disc, make sure you are watching the 3D option.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah I believe you have to go through the custom setting to adjust the tint... I do TV calibrations for my business so I'm adjusting those colors all the time.. There should be different modes like cinema, etc..etc.. select custom settings, or advance settings to adjust the tint !!<br>  <br>  See your owners manuel.. for more details :)

VgIBEANxaa	Yes, your TV will work with your BluRay player.  Your TV has a 1366 by 768 resolution, which means it will support 720p and 1080i high definition, but not full 1080p high definition.  Only TVs with a 1920 by 1080 resolution support 1080p.<br>  <br>  BluRay is capable of sending a 1080p signal, so it would look a little better on a 1080p TV, but it does not have to be a 1080p TV to work.  You will still be able to watch your movies in 1080i high definition which is better than watching regular DVDs in standard definition.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	Just so we're on the same page...are you saying that your TV is HDTV, handling 720p and 1080i?  If so, then yes, your Blu-Ray player will look great via HDMI.|`|usIma0vIaa	Yes.|`|f9c10f470f3f0acd2faaacacb18411c3aa	The security on a Blu-Ray disc stops any TV which isn't HD ready from playing discs.|`|0NVypgGSaa	Joe is absolutely correct

kgTPnjhkaa	I wouldn't be surprised if one day Nintendo made an adapter akin to the Game Boy Player. The wiimote could easily duplicate the touch screen, so it would just require the Wii to render both DS screens on a single television set. Such a device would probably set you back at least $50 and there isn't even a hint of one so far. So, I say take the plunge and buy both. They offer different experiences and I don't think you'd regret it in the end, but for now their's no way you can..............|`|raEUval8aa	No. It can't.|`|h2ShPEVXaa	No, only Wii and Gamecube games can.|`|ZsnelFnkaa	WHY WOULD U THINK THAT|`|lhzpq7ATaa	No, they can't.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	nope|`|yAv5Zs7Oaa	no

qGfAlDd2aa	If you are connected to an antenna, make sure the TV is set for "antenna" tuning and scan for channels.  Digital channels will have a dot or a dash in the channel number (60.1, 5-2).  If you are missing channels, you probably need a better antenna.<br>  <br>  If you are on cable, you may or may not get digital channels depending on how the cable system is set up and what package you subscribe to.<br>  <br>  If you are on satellite, you must have the HD package - it will come with an HD receiver.  Otherwise, you will get standard definition (SD) which is basically analog video.

IQZxdghGaa	Heck yeah, for kids that young, yes go ahead, Look my cousin bought a PS3 for her 5 year old for Christmas last year, by febuary it was already dead. Also, a friend of mine bought a PS3 for her 6 and 8 year olds, and she ended up selling it because she couldnt really find any good games that would be suitable for kids that young<br>  <br>  So yeah, buying a PS2 for them is a good way, and it is not that expensive, and if you go to gamestop and those kinda stores you will find LOADS of good PS2 games to buy for them<br>  <br>  And if you are gonna go with the next gens, forget 360's and PS3's and get the Nintendo Wii|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	I think a Wii is better, even though it is like buying 2 PS2's because it is $250<br>  <br>  But your kids will like it more<br>  <br>  The Wii doesn't play DVD movies though|`|ad2faoKcaa	To be totally honest, for a 6 and 4 year old, I'd get them a Nintendo Wii because of all consoles, it has the most kid friendly games available !<br>  <br>  As for the PS2, it may have another year or two of life and then it'll start declining. Most game developers have ceased making games for it now so.<br>  <br>  I've included a link for parents that has video game information from console selection to game ratings !|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Buy a playstation 3 that is backward compatible with playstation 2 games. My understanding is that if you buy one with the 80 g hard drive or less it is still compatible. Anything bigger for a hard drive won't work as Sony changed the technical specifications and it isn't compatible anymore. Besides they are still young, make them go outside and play instead.|`|mPaqhgUuaa	They're not producing PS2 games anymore, I don't see how your kids are going to enjoy it as much as a PS3.  PS3 does have a pretty decent price since it's a multimedia machine. It has Blu-ray for movies, you can use it to surf the internet, or just for photos and music. There's PS3 games for any ages. If you're kids are young, there's games like Little Big Planet. This is my personal opinion.|`|jxpV13rTaa	im surprised they are still making games for it..that does mean that people are still buying these games and buying the console so technically it still is worth getting especially for younger kids who wont really notice the difference between the ps2 and ps3. so for a few years yeah i think its fine. you will find hundreds of great games for your kids and they are cheaper as well|`|F2znLWdWaa	The PS2 is good but their aren't to many new games coming out for it now. But Its still a great system.  <br>  <br>  If your Kids are 6 & 4, Then to PS3 may not be the best option. Most games are rated over T, and it may be difficult for them to get the hang of all the features. With the Blu-Ray, PSN store (requiring a credit card for Movies, games and add-ons), Internet browser, Media server options, Online connectivity, HDMI set ups, and everything else, Your kids may be overwhelmed. THis would be a console more suitable for someone of your age. <br>  <br>  I would reccomend a Nintendo WII it has a lot of the games the PS2 had, and it is targeted towards kids around those ages. Your kids would love it. My little cousins did. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Also, (I bought the WII for my little cousins, but I'm still in High School so I was short on money. So I played around a bit and Modified the wii so i was able to download games off the web. It saves you a lot of money and keeps the kids happy. I've also Modded the PS2. So If your interested in this, I can show you how to do it. Just give my an email if you want.)|`|uk0jsbYraa	I have a PS2, and here are still many excellent games out there, and it defenitly has the most bang for your buck. But you mentioned that you have very young children, and in that respect i would have to recommend the Nintendo Wii system. It has bright, colorful graphics for most of the games, and the motion relative controls are much easier for smaller hands to master.|`|AA10233620	The ps2 already has many great games and probably be around for a couple more years... so in my opinion it would still be worth it considering your kids age. There are more kid friendly games out there for the ps2 vs. the ps3.|`|UzV0jc2haa	Not really they barely make games for it anymore.  I would suggest trying ebay for a good price when it comes to a ps3.  Or try a 360.  Oh i got one buy them a Wii.  That's something every kid likes unless your older like 13+ like me|`|QMbi1VuIaa	if they are going on 4 and 6 then get a Wii thats what most kids like. Also it can be fun for your whole family too. Buy games like Mario cart. But you can get a 360 or ps3 for yourself =D lol|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Not at all, it barely gets any games, and if it does they're lame games, or movie based games. Better yet go with the ps3, or but two xbox 360 pro's for 400$|`|SsIVKLrdaa	yes it will still be around<br>  i would suggest since they are that <br>  age that you get them a wii <br>  it is more focused on their age group<br>  it's about the same price as the|`|1ykhOBLuaa	why dont you go for a ps3?<br>  its much better <br>  better than ps2 n ps3<br>  it depends on the games that u buy which ur child shud be able 2 play<br>  not the console|`|ULaeJ5wLaa	Just buy the wii. It's more fun than getting a ps2. Wii Is also for kids and family.|`|1Z11ySWaaa	No man, its very old now, get a ps3 or 360<br>  Btw im getting a ps3 soon =)

IoKjLtN9aa	Do you have AT&T as a service provider? <br>  <br>  If you do you may want to buy the MEdia max data plan before you start streaming music (It can get expensive) If you do your in luck though because pandora is available for your phone :). <br>  <br>  <br>  www.pandora.com<br>  <br>  It's a great internet radio, you tell it what kind of musical artist you like , songs, etc. Pandora will then find songs with similar qualities! <br>  <br>  Have a great night!

Click on the second link in the information below for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often. <br>    <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ...

The second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.

Plus it's quite small and durable, has wonderful features and is just over all perfect. I'm a teen too, and I love it to pieces! about $200, 10 megapixels, face detection, and a lot more!!<br>  <br>  The Olympus on the other hand, is shockproof, waterproof(yes, underwater pics!), and freezeproof. it's more of a travel camera, for these reasons. It's very hardy and durable, but the images aren't going to be quite as crisp as the Canon (that has a Carl Zeiss lense).<br>  <br>  The quality of the image is going to be in the lense, as you probably know by now. That is why I bought the Canon rather than the Olympus, because the coolest thing about the Olympus was the underwater feature, and how many times will I use that? I could just get a case for the Canon. I do suggest the Canon, but of course, pick the one that best fits your style.<br>  <br>  For my Bday i got the Canon, and it's PERFECT. I wouldn't want anything else knowing how great it is!! And with the Panorama feature, if you want to take  a picture of a landscape but it's too big to capture? well, just take a few consecutive shots, and "stitch" them together with a program that comes with it, and PRESTO! a huge, continuous photo of the gorgeous landscape.<br>  <br>  And there are SO many cool, easy to use features.

TwIK4Ivlaa	It's a good deal but you can still negotiate and make it better. Get the price down by removing the flash unit and the filter. You can buy better ones later.<br>  <br>  For latest prices search on the internet and you'll be more aware. <br>  <br>  My only doubt about the deal is the reason why the person is selling it. The D300 offers no great advantages to a person who has done just 500 shots on a D80. Secondly I fail to understand the reason for selling the second lens and the flash too.

Thief, you got PWNED. That's the exact reason I keep my iPod Touch locked, because no matter what, if it's stolen, I will ALWAYS have the last laugh. <br>  <br>  The Apple store WILL NOT unlock it for you, it's a stolen iPod, you suck. No way of getting past it.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Apple store will unlock it for you.
1gqrH9Ykaa	Well, a lot of stereos are made with iPod connectors, so it might be your iPod if none of them have worked.<br>  <br>  Another way to try getting it to work, would be seeing if the system has any output connectors on the back. Buy a separate cable that will hook up to those, and on the other end, has a 3.5 mm headphone jack so that you can plug it in your iPod where the headphones go in, and it would still play out of the stereo system. I don't think it would charge it though, but I use this kind of connector for my laptop, and it works for my iPod as well.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that's worded weird. Haha, if you don't get it, just say so, I'll try to fix it so that it is. hahaha.|`|c5FSGxxqaa	probably not many of the newest ipods have a different amount of pins on their usb port. They will usually charge but not play.|`|1gfRNb80aa	It will work but maybe the stereo cannot play the ipod..it can charge it and anything else...my stereo does that too

(including me)  Make sure you get rid of what you can before you'd send something back, but as far as my apple care plan, I was told I'd have to go to an apple store, and they usually would hand you a new iphone if the old one was cracked or something similar.|`|NJszN4rUaa	You just need to relock it buy installing the new sofware that hasnt been broke yet so sync it to itunes  and then they wont know about it being unlocked or wont care because it is locked you get a fixed phone and then later can unlock it again when the get to it.|`|cxpk9N5Eaa	i think if you take it to the store you purchased it and they try to turn it on and it dont work ( like if its still under warrenty) at all, you will get store credit|`|dKPHChlWaa	suck a ****** dick you hoe

HYklfMZ8aa	CoD: WaW is the same as CoD4 just with a new skin (plus some extra cool stuff like Nazi Zombies, flamethrowers, etc.).  I own both games and I play CoD: WaW more than CoD4.  There are way better sniping spots in CoD: WaW and there is a Multiplayer Map Pack coming out in March that has 3 new maps and a new Nazi Zombie location.<br>  <br>  Everyone keeps dissing CoD: WaW because of the way Treyarch stuffed up with CoD3.  Also, people don't like how Treyarch based the game on World War 2 again.  I think it's great.  The guns are as powerful as CoD4 but just look different.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	I just thought that 4 was an all around better game, better story, better game play, etc.|`|pl2SocVKaa	nothing is wrong its one of the elite ps3 shooters out its just that as a sequel to cod4 it didn't live up thats where its getting the criticism but its a very good game though|`|fWclxi9Baa	i do like world at war graphics 100 times better then cod4 but i think the guns lack in world at war they shoot to slow and it makes me mad also the tanks in world at war drive me crazy i like the game but the online is kinda cheap|`|NT7gjoqraa	Lol There's nothing wrong with that. I've actually played more violent games than COD5. This one is good however I personally think it cannot beat COD4. Plus, the story mode on part 5 is way too short.|`|UzV0jc2haa	Nothing but 4 had ALOT BETTER ONLINE PLAY.  A actual storyline of you going after a guy better single player.  Really the only thing i like bout it is nazi zombies|`|VZu936Utaa	If you don't think anything is wrong,then there isn't. Your opinion is the one that counts. You might of heard though that Cod 4 is better and Cod 5 has problems. People say that because a different company does the odd number of CODs(1,3,5) while another company does the evens (2,4).I have to agree that the evens are better.People dislike 1,3,5 because the company that develops those doesn't do quite as good of a job as the other company. I hope that helps...|`|7xr3qWBraa	Nothing is wrong wit it its just i like present guns and armor on cod4 i like cod waw too but i just dont like the old weapons they kinda suk|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Nothings wrong with it, you just need to stop believing other people saying it's dumb. They're just saying that because they have world war 2.|`|9wojIiiWaa	nothings wrong with it, btw its COD4, 4 was actualy called world at war, and wasnt number 4, this one is number 4 :P just thought you would like to know :P

How you try to fix the device yourself is remove the battery, then place the device in a jar with some plain rice.<br>  <br>  The rice is highly absorbent and will suck the moisture from inside the device in the same way the moisture absorbent packs you often get in with electronic devices other things that need to be kept dry, and they are labeled do not eat.

You can put it in a bowl of uncooked rice this will bring out all the moisture from the cicuitry.|`|F2zXRrktaa	Do you have insurance? If you do it will only cost you $50 deductible to get a new one. If the phone does not turn on then they can not get contacts, pictures or videos unless you already had them saved on a memory card and downloaded back-up assistance through get-it-now on your phone. Try putting the battery in a bowl of rice for 24 hours then put it in your phone. If you take it into a store they will try to put one of their batteries in it to try and turn it on. If you don't have insurance go into the store but don't admit you got it wet say it won't turn on and you don't know why hopefully they will swap the phone for free under warranty!!!!|`|hRzYM3JTaa	after awhile it will dry out and start working... i've done this to my cell phone and ipod many times... it may take a few days to a week... so if you like use ur warrenty like the other guy said<br>  oh and when my phone was done drying it started messing up with the screen (it would turn pink and stuff) but it went away so if it does that dont worry!|`|4k18hNiTaa	i heard the best thing to do when you drop a phone in water is to place it in the freezer for a while, then take it out and wipe off the condensation as it slowly warms. but idk if that really works or not, ive never dropped my phone in water before|`|7xr3qWBraa	DONT BLOW DRY IT OMG quik take the battery out and put it on sum uncook rice for a day so it can absorb all the water  if your phone still dont work .....get ah new one|`|yj8nrHYsaa	the screen probably burned
DvnEJenpaa	I will list them in order in which i believe you should consider them<br>  <br>  1: AT&T Quickfire - excellent phone, BEST keyboard, touch screen can get a little unresponsive at times, HOWEVER, AT&T did recall every Quickfire phone and pulled them off the shelves to cease sales for the time being.  Apparently, they wanted to fix some of the issues that the phone was having, so if you want this phone, you'll have to wait a bit until they re-release it or come out with a new version<br>  <br>  2: Pantech Matrix - my friend has this phone, and he loves it, sliding design is pretty good, keyboard is nice but a little bit on the smaller side, phone is pretty thick however, and I've heard that many people have trouble with it breaking, as long as you're careful, you should have a great time with this phone.<br>  <br>  3: Pantech Slate - the reason i put this one third is solely because of the keyboard, besides the Quickfire, it has the best keyboard of all the new messaging phones, and it's quite thin unlike it's Pantech counterpart, the Matrix, The only problem with this phone is that it lacks 3G data support and it has no slot for micro SD expansion cards (important for more pictures and music on your phone).<br>  <br>  4: Samsung Propel - the reason i put this last is solely because of design, the keyboard is very flat as well as very small, which provides a bit of trouble for really quick texting, the phone's overall design seems lacking (it's probably the bigger of the phones, but it has the least amount of features, whereas the Slate lacks features, it is much thinner), i feel that Samsung could've added more to make this phone better, nonetheless, it still proves to be a great phone<br>  <br>  The choice between these phones really isn't that monumental, because they are all great phones and I'm sure you'd enjoy any of the four that you purchase.|`|8vuOwZHuaa	You should get the Quickfire. My friend has it ands it's really cool. It has a touch screen and slide out full qwerty keyboard. It can hold music too. It's really cool I recomend it.|`|NJszN4rUaa	The quickfire sucks get the samsung propel, pantech matrix, or the lg vu , or the samsung eternity or the pantech slate.

I work for the man|`|qhLs9gIMaa	i would say the quickfire but it got taken off the shelves to be fixed. than i would say the pantech matrix. i like it because i have it. its a very good texting phone i love sliding it.   =p|`|mg0CEcTPaa	get the Quickfire, its a touch screen phone that slides up to reveal a full keyboard its really nice|`|AmKxq3R0aa	quickfire or matrix, i have the quickfire and i love it, but it dusnt have the best touch screen

It might be a little loose so the only thing you can try to do is not move it at all or send it in to get it fixed. Do not open up the xbox though.

OiT5SJM8aa	You LG must have a Lithium ion battery. They are not affected by the memory effect, so you don't need to wait for it to be empty to charge it. <br>  <br>  The more you go thru cycles (discharge + charge = 1 cycle), the more the battery will lose capability to hold a charge.<br>  <br>  Time is also a factor, lithium ion batteries will lose about 15 to 20 % of their capacity after a year.<br>  <br>  Overcharging the battery as well as leaving the battery empty for a long period of time damages the battery. <br>  <br>  I would suggest to check with your local Batteries Plus ( <a href="http://www.batteriesplus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteriesplus.com</a> ) if you need more advices or explanations.|`|HBFHZXybaa	If you use it a lot, the battery will drain much, much quicker. And with all a phone does, especially the dare, battery life is shortened. But you can always buy an extended battery, that is, if you want your phone to be just a tad thicker, then its worth it.
qGfAlDd2aa	That depends on where you are and which one of their stations you receive.<br>  <br>  If the station is a full power station (some are) they have no choice.

qGfAlDd2aa	If an indoor antenna will work or not depends on how strong the signals are at your house, which is a pretty individual thing.  Visit <a href="http://www.antennaweb.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.antennaweb.org</a> .  Based on your zip code the site will give you the color code for the proper antenna for your situation.  The site will also list the distance to the transmitters.  If you are over about 15 miles or so, you may have difficulty using an indoor antenna.<br>  <br>  Many people put antennas in attics because of restrictions in their subdivision or HOA rules.  Those restrictions have been invalidated by federal regulations.  So, if that's the case, there is no reason not to install it properly.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL ANSWER:  Antenna web will tell you if you are in a strong signal area, though.  If it shows you are in a Yellow (small antenna) area, then you have a fair chance of making an indoor antenna work.<br>  <br>  A space above a garage is considered "attic" in a general sense by most builders.  It really doesn't matter what you call it in this case, it's still an antenna inside the roof structure and you would have the same losses due to the walls and roof.

Then cut the RCA connectors and connect each speaker to one of the pairs. <br>  <br>  However, their best use will probably be as rear surround speakers, when you decide to get an AV receiver.

Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete or fill card completely. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files. You can then select the memory card folder e.g.,100HPM417, that you clicked to see the picture you took and click Copy.<br>    <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	Read the instruction manual properly.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete or fill card completely.

I'm a teen too, and I love it to pieces! about $200,  10 megapixels, face detection, and a lot more!!<br>  <br>  The Olympus on the other hand, is shockproof, waterproof(yes, underwater pics!), and freezeproof. it's more of a travel camera, for these reasons. It's very hardy and durable, but the images aren't going to be quite as crisp as the Canon (that has a Carl Zeiss lense).<br>  <br>  The quality of the image is going to be in the lense, as you probably know by now. That is why I bought the Canon rather than the Olympus, because the coolest thing about the Olympus was the underwater feature, and how many times will I use that? I could just get a case for the Canon. I do suggest the Canon, but of course, pick the one that best fits your style.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and Happy Shooting!! (pictures)

zmyZ9BgZaa	Well, it may be too new for the Xbox. My brother has one and he has the same problem, and I had a Nano that worked on the Xbox, but his iTouch did not. I would say it's too new for the software inside, especially if the Xbox is made before the iTouch release. (You can look on the back of your Xbox near the serial code to find the date of it.) But, as of now, the iTouches do not work with the 360, either to charge or to play music. It seems like the media can not be found for some reason. Looks like you'll have to just charge your iTouch up on your computer, and listen to it while you play. Xbox or Apple need to find a solution to this epidemic.

I wouldn't think a few drops would do anything.|`|ffmq1UO0aa	The water probably damaged the phones, electronics are very easily damaged by water. You should take it in to your cell phone provider, see if they can do anything, if not, buy a new phone.|`|BiiLd4O6aa	Electronics and water do not mix very well.<br>  <br>  Operating an electronic or cell phone when wet could cause it to short out and stop working. You should have taken the battery out, turned the phone around and let the water fall out and air dry for at least 24-48 hours before turning it back on. The temptation of turning of using the phone is there, but it could cause the entire phone to short out and stop working. It it has stopped working, you will need to replace it.<br>  <br>  Some phone plans offer insurance. If you do not have insurance, you will have to purchase a new phone.

o32vB5QHaa	There is no possible way to get out of your contract. You sign the contract that specifically states "If I choose to terminate the service before the 2 years is up, I am subject to a $200 early termination fee." The wireless consultant specifically states this when you sign the contract. Unfortunately cell phone companies don't really care that people are losing their jobs and the effects of the economy. You can however, reduce your minutes and remove features that can help lower your bill. That is the only way to help you save a little bit of money. I tried getting out of my contract and I work from them! And I couldn't even get out of it, had to pay the fee. Sorry...Hope this helps.

Answers truncates links (abbreviates them).  You copied your links from a previous question of yours which is why your new links don't work.<br>  <br>  But, I found your old question and looked at your links there...<br>  <br>  First off, you are mistaken about the pixels.  The $9000 camera does say 1.67 Megapixels, but that's 1.67 Mp PER sensor.  Of which this camera has 3.  The XL H1S is a professional video camera.  It uses 3 seperate 1/3" CCDs.  This is why television and movies look so good compared to "home videos".<br>  <br>  The lens on the XL H1S is twice the zoom of the other camera and is interchangeable (like all professional cameras), the other camera's lens is not.<br>  <br>  And, of course, the professional model uses a digital tape format while the cheaper one has only a 32GB internal memory which can only record at HD quality 4 hours worth of video.<br>  <br>  Unless you have $9000 laying about, then the differences between these cameras really doesn't matter.  But the professional model is... well, professional quality.  Unless you intend on using it to make a living as a freelance reporter, then stick to the consumer camera.

20bPiiBtaa	I would suggest a 1-800 number... <br>  <br>  1) It looks more profesional<br>  2) Makes your company look larger than it is<br>  3) It is much cheaper than geting another plan<br>  4) With spending just a bit more you can get a vanity number like 1-800-callsams<br>  <br>  I actually have one through <br>  <br>  www.telcan.net<br>  <br>  Since I don't have large call volumes (probably around 5-10 calls a month) the bill is always under $5-$6<br>  <br>  I also love their online control panel that makes changing and looking up things a lot eaiser.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|oRm1JJ31aa	get another phone, you should keep your private life and your business life separate. i dont think your friends would like a 1-800 number calling them all the time, it would be weird.|`|7rEFSuMkaa	Was just googling and looking around for an answer to the same question. Definitely get an 800 number for your cell phone, there's no reason you should get a second phone for business. <br>  <br>  The best (cheapest) company I have found as of yet is tollfreenumber.org: 3.9 cents/min.<br>  <br>  I checked out telcan.net that someone else mentioned and it's slightly more expensive than tollfreenumber.org: 4.5 cents/min.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the search. I will be happy to know if you find an even cheaper company to get an 800 number with.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I've decided against tollfreenumber.org---their customer service is incredibly horrible. They definitely seem to be "hiding" fees that they don't tell you about. I wouldn't trust them one bit.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: My final verdict: smart800now.com offers 3 different plans depending on your needs. I'm starting with the minimum plan right now and will move up as I need to. They are the cheapest and still offer the most services for free. I'm VERY happy I found them over the other options.|`|pRX631gCaa	i would either get the 1800 number or use a cheap prepaid like net 10 to use for your business line so your private number does not get spread too much

jKc7aDCwaa	1. Probably fun and as hard and you want to make it. I don't have drums yet but been wanting them.<br>  2. Wii GH3 guitars will work fine with WT. Not sure about the Nyko but the standard GH3 Les Paul works fine.<br>  3. It just takes practice. Easy and Medium are simple because using 3 fret buttons and 4 frets is easy, Hard is where 5 frets comes in and it's much faster and tougher to use your 4 fingers to cover the 5 frets. <br>  4. RB drums will NOT work on WT. WT drums (and the Guitars) work fine on RB2, but not RB1.|`|KiVENZoBaa	1. Yes, it is indeed really fun with the drums alone, especially if you're playing a favorite song of yours.<br>  <br>  2. There are GH Guitars out there to buy, but only the GH3 ones, if you were looking for the new World Tour Guitars, then don't bother looking cause they aren't in stock yet. Best if you ask someone when they will be in stock.<br>  <br>  3. Its not really hard on Guitar really. Its pretty much like playing drums, but the key to making it easy if you play a lot. The more you play the better you become.<br>  <br>  4. No rock band drums will not work on GH:WT. Rock Band only has 4 symbols (5 including the bass drum pedal) and World Tour has 5 (6 including the bass drum pedal as well). This will only work on the Xbox 360 and PS3 version of GH:WT and not for the Wii.|`|EKJYdUdAaa	gh3 guitars work for it and some of the last songs are challenging but not to hard but i recommend you get the new guitar because there is a lot more cool stuff you can do on it and rb2 drums should work for gh4 cause every gh4 equipment works for rb2

EWvzQ4Syaa	depends on your budget. <br>  if it's minimal $$$ and for jamming in your bed room.<br>  Check out a Peavey Vypyr. It's  a digital modeling amp so you can get alot of great sounds from it but unlike the Line 6 Spider amps, it has analog distortion which sounds a hell of alot better and more natural.<br>  you can get 15 watts for 100 dollars<br>  30 for 200<br>  75 for 300. they also have Tube models available for higher prices.<br>  <br>  If you are into getting a serious gigging amp of professional quality. you should check out an <br>  Engl Invader, or Engl Powerball, Carvin V3, Peavey 5150|`|3PK25igzaa	I'd buy a KRANK amp Rev.

1d3b2f6e4be90913d89c7f9097ef9254aa	Receiving calls will only take your minutes but receiving international texts will cost per text and it varies depending on what country the message is coming from.  You can get an International Value Package for $3.99 per month and it will greatly reduce these charges.|`|d4d8e8a6a0b9de0b42ac50282fbc3c9caa	It might depend on your plan, but i think it only charges the person calling you, and would only use up your minutes, or texting I think that they do not .
AA10881156	In a standard US wire....... 1 is positive, 1 is negative, and 1 is a grounding wire.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	A typical power outlet has AC current, so there technically is no "positive" or "negative" terminal on them.<br>  <br>  What there is is a Hot terminal/conductor, which has the voltage on it, an neutral conductor, where the current flows to complete the circuit, and and the ground/earth, which provides a path for current to flow in the event of a fault in the appliance, to protect the user against electrical shock.|`|I5PYvCz8aa	Black is hot, positive.<br>  White is neutral, a return path for the current.<br>  Green is a ground, for safety or signal.

HVQFVtelaa	That would usually indicate that inner, or outer electrical contacts of your adapter may need cleaning, or possibly the adapter needs replacing. <br>  <br>  The weakest link is usually the culprit. The Sandisks are almost trouble free, and the computer is better made than the adapter.

DoMDtSS3aa	No you don't need the Wii Sports disc for your Wii. Its just a game that comes with the system so you can see what the Wii is capable of doing. Some thing for you to enjoy until you buy a new game. Whenever you buy a Wii it always comes with the game, so you can just sell the game. Therefore, you can use the money you sold from the Wii Sports game to buy a new game.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	You dont need it dont worry.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	The game isn't required, it's just something Nintendo throws in so that your not stuck without a game.|`|lI4QoRkMaa	You don't need the game unless you want to play the games on it.
oXIYHsDaaa	No, It doesn't come with the wii sports game disk and by the time you pay the shipping it's gonna cost almost the same but you wont have the warranty coverage from nintendo. just buy it at the store $250 in the states $280 in Canada.|`|MBkuUf24aa	yeah it looks fine xD|`|kPZYmUPQaa	yeah thats a good deal
0AqkCOWIaa	I suggest that you get the 55-250mm Image Stabilized lens. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-55-250mm-4-0-5-6-Telephoto-Digital/dp/B0011NVMO8/ref=pd_bbs_3?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235363895&sr=8-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-55-250mm-4-0...</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't go as long as say the Canon EF 70-300mm lens, but it has image stabilization, and it still delivers pretty decent telephoto capability. It's about five dollars over your budget, but you'll get more in the package. Trust me, Image stabilization is definitely needed when you are talking about telephoto lenses.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	I agree with Nathan. The 55-250 is a much better lens than the 75-300 which is under $200. Spend a few extra dollars and get the 55-250.
r3qkJiFxaa	Theres the facebook mobile. Its texting only. No internet required. Just text the fb number. But you can only have a few options like, message 1 person, update your status, poke, look up a person. As long as you already have a texting plan your fine. (I have unlimited so i don't have to worry about the texts) IF you have alot of friends and you have like a limited plan ex:400 then you might go over. Just make sure you can pay for the texts. You can also set your settings on what you would like to get notifed on.|`|rSwce38saa	Haven't tried it, but that's what it seems like.<br>  I'm guessing your account has to be verified (by your phone number), and you are limited to the activies listed on the page.<br>  <br>  Didn't know about that. Cool find|`|BwdnDmphaa	U will need internet to use facebook.
BMConIedaa	Wii emulation is in its infancy.  The GameCube still isn't well emulated, why would you expect Wii emulation to be at the point to where you could run commercial games?<br>  <br>  Besides, a computer capable of running a Wii emulator would cost several times the value of a Wii.  The Wii is several times more powerful than a PS2, and you need a cutting edge box to run a PS2 emulator.<br>  <br>  Maybe in 10 years or so.  Until then... just get a real Wii.|`|un16ZWdJaa	The Wii emulator Dolphin has just been updated, and yes, Mario Kart runs well. :)<br>  <br>  Full download and details at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.miibrew.com/post/2009/02/10/DolphinWX-32bit-Rev-2195-(Daco).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.miibrew.com/post/2009/02/10/D...</a>|`|b4mhcOy6aa	yeh just buy a wii my friend it will be a while before a descent emulator comes out and in all fairness its not the games that make the wii the wii its the motion sensitive controls that give it its edge if u just like mario kart get an n64 emulator its the same the graphics of course arent as good but hey thats not what ppl buy the wii for either lol or everyone would only have a 360 or ps3|`|RDFkpq0Oaa	I'm not sure it's perfect yet, but try <a href="http://wiiemulator.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wiiemulator.net/</a>

QekY4ycuaa	the sub preout it for active subs, you just need one cable to carry the data from the amp to the sub.|`|I5PYvCz8aa	Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...<br>  <br>  (Sorry, I fell asleep on the keyboard. This is the most boring question I've seen all day.  This category is a snore.)|`|r8HAHhgkaa	A subwoofer pre put is simply an output jack for the LFE (low frequency effects) channel for an active (aka powered) subwoofer. If you needed a separate amp for your other sub that means that it was a passive(or non powered) sub and will need to be powered by something else. So unless you do indeed have a powered sub you dont even need to worry about it. If your amp has 7 channels you could use the extra two to power your sub. Otherwise you might have to buy a separate amp or hook up the one you say you already have to power your sub. i hope this helps.|`|eHWRodp3aa	The fact that your jack says "pre out", it seems that you would be sending that signal through an active, or powered sub. If so, there will be adjustments right on the sub, rather than on your amp for that sub channel.<br>  See Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer</a><br>  <br>  CL<br>  <a href="http://www.audio-equipment-speakers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.audio-equipment-speakers.com</a>

oXIYHsDaaa	Wii points are the wii shop currency, you can either buy point cards at any store that sells wii games or you can use your credit card to buy the points right on your console (if you are in Canada it;s cheaper to buy them over the console as the exchange rate is lower then the store mark up is) <br>  <br>  Rock band and Guitar hero world tour allow you to play the guitar, drums, or sing. The rock band equipment will not work with the guitar hero games, however the guitar hero world tour equipment will work with the rockband 2 game (but not the rock band 1 game) so in my opionion the guitar hero world tour package is a better deal. The only down fall is that you will require a Wii Remote for every player on world tour including the singer. Not a problem if you are only going to play with the two of you or other people who own a Wii and can bring their own remote. Guitar hero world tour (GHWT) is the only guitar hero game that allows drums and singing. if you are not interested in the drums you could buy the GHWT guitar package and any cheap USB Microphone. <br>  <br>  Some of my favorit games, other then guitar Hero and rock band are - Shawn White snowboard (with the wii balance board) Wario ware smooth moves (which is great to help you get good at handling the remote) Any of the lego games, big brain acadamy, and tetris and doctor mario from the Wii shop. <br>  <br>  My husband likes Zelda Twilight princess and the call of duty games but if you are wanting to keep moving these type of games don't help because you just sit on the couch and push buttons and wave the remote a bit.|`|TX9EbUS2aa	Mario Kart is awesome, especially if you have someone you know to race against. I have the classic controller for mine, but in all honesty, Ive never used it not once, so you probably dont need that. The Wii Zapper is pretty cool. It comes with a crossbow game.

qGfAlDd2aa	There is no way to answer your question without knowing where you are (zip code).<br>  <br>  If you suddenly lost all of your analog channels on the morning of the 18th, then likely you are in an area where the analog channels were turned off.  If you had analog channels after the 18th, then something has failed in your system.<br>  <br>  If you are not getting any digital channels at all, I would first suspect your antenna.  The type of antenna you need and where to aim it all depends on how strong the signals are in your area.  Do a visual inspection of your antenna.  If it is rusted or bent it needs to be replaced.  It also may have been blown off it proper aim.<br>  <br>  Visit <a href="http://www.antennaweb.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.antennaweb.org</a> .  Based on your zip code, the site will tell you what stations you could expect to receive, where to aim your antenna and suggest the proper antenna for your situation.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	How good of reception did you get on UHF channels before?  Most digital channels are UHF, so you need a good UHF antenna.<br>  <br>  If you are using the antenna connection from converter to TV, do you have your TV set on channel 3 or 4 (can you go to and see menus on the converter box)?  If you use composite (yellow/red/white cables) you have to have your TV set to AV or Video (whatever that input is called).|`|AA10179458	Here are a couple things to check.<br>  <br>  1. make sure the digital converter box has an analog pass through. If it does not then any station still broadcasting in analog will never come in.(example: Zenith 900 series = no analog pass through, Zenith 901 series = has analog pass through)<br>  <br>  2. Signal strength. Analog TV could have that fuzzy or snowy picture with weaker signals. Digital TV is either you have a picture or you do not. There is no fuzzy or snowy for weaker signal just no picture.<br>  <br>  3. Make sure you set the box for air and not cable. Some boxes have a setting for over the air channels and cable channels. Since you have an antennae you need to make sure the box is set to air.|`|bqpcecWXaa	is your antenna connected to the digital tuner box? that might be your problem. if not, try moving your antenna to different locations or just simply buy a better antenna.|`|I91lFgTdaa	The box might be defective try exchanging for another one.

AA10179458	What kind of TV? If it is an LCD or Plasma display then it would cost more to replace the screen then buy a new TV. The screen is the most expensive part of the TV. If it is a projection TV then I suggest contacting the manufacturer they will point you in the right direction.

nhYABprkaa	there is a tiny little switch that gets triggered when the LCD is turned, if that switch is broken, then its best to sell the camera as a used camera, as is no returns on ebay.<br>  <br>  Not everyone rotates the screen and films like you do so there is very little chance of someone will be testing it to do that?<br>  <br>  I particularly do not like the HC models because they are so small and hard to work with.

LZQ2BGZ0aa	you might have to call t-mobile and ask them for help.Something must be wrong with the phone
r8HAHhgkaa	It looks so wrong becuase you are not getting HD. playing a standard definition source on a high definition tv will result in a very pixelated image like the one you described. In order to get HD you need an HD source such as a blu ray player or a high def cable receiver (with the HD package purchased) or another source such as a sony playstation 3 or xbox 360. You also need an HDMI cable to hook up to the tv or you will still only be getting standard definition. don't feel bad if you didnt know. more then 40% of people arent getting an HD picture either. Just by having the tv doesnt mean you are getting HD. spread the word.|`|AA10179458	The 2 guys above me are correct. Standard def. does not look very good on an HDTV. When you do upgrade to High def. you will see a world of difference. Just make sure you use the right cable.

You also do not use USB; that's for still photos.<br>  <br>  You just need a FireWire cable.  The PV-GS59 has a 4-pin FireWire port (I think it will be labeled "DV").  Your computer might have a 4-pin port, a 6-pin port, or no port at all.  Look up a 6-pin port to see what one looks like.  If you have a port, purchase the appropriate cable (4-to-6 or 4-to-4 FireWire).<br>  <br>  If you don't have a port, you will need to purchase a FireWire card for your computer, which is not very expensive.  If you want some more direction, tell us a bit more about your computer.  If it's a laptop, you'd need to have an available card slot (something like PC or EC).  On a desktop, you'd also need an available expansion slot.<br>  <br>  Once you have the FireWire cable, you can capture your video in any editing program, including Windows Movie Maker for PC, iMovie for Mac, or any other purchasable editing program with better features, such as Corel/Ulead VideoStudio or Avid Liquid.<br>  <br>  If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!|`|x43Pj22Aaa	Get a firewire cable then use windows movie maker or stashBox from <a href="http://www.stashspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stashspace.com</a><br>  <br>  StashSpace offers video capture to get the video onto your computer, as well as high quality video sharing and video backup.

Somtimes it shuts off when u start up and application so open your app click the home button twice (fast) and there should be a music thing that pops up and press the play button then hit close and your still in your application and music is playing. If your listening to like internet radio you have to be on the app to listen to the music.

Vuc80Au2aa	You should be capable of doing the wireing yourself if theirs power phone or other outlests near the entry and exit holes for your cables. Simply remove the outlet covering and and try to fish it through... might have to make a snake of some sort with a firm wire or coat hanger. I usually replace tv cable or add Ethernet cable by tying it to the end of the old cable and pulling it all through. If theres not any sockets that are conveniently located you might want to call a pro before you start drilling holes in the walls.<br>  <br>  I dont know much about BOSE but I like Onkyo recievers and Sony Recievers. Both have systems on a ridiculous sell at newegg.com for 5.1 and 6.1 the Onkyo even has the 6.1 on such a good sell right now its cheaper than their 2.1 stereo system... was about $250 with speakers and sub included... down from $700+. Anyway goodluck|`|z8MqokTLaa	hi friend  you can get a good system in this price, system quality is always based on the sound . many systen is producing good soung . here i am tlling a place where you can find the system acccording your choice<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/Index.aspx?CategoryId=133" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a>|`|OMkiTRI4aa	I'm sorry but Bose sucks for home theater period! <br>  heres something that will def meet and exceed almost all the wants you could have with a home theater system.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9999103000050006&st=mirage+denon&lp=1&type=product&cp=1&id=pcmprd103100050006" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  oh and as for a tv you can get a pretty nice 40" lcd (preferable samsung) for around 700-900 dollars.|`|FgTkF31iaa	The Bose system is great for sound but not so good for many other reasons it lack connctivity to other equipment. there are many theater in a box solutions I would use a Yammaha, Pioneer, or a Sony Amp they all come in a 5.1 configuration. Then get a 5.1 speaker system a few good  ones are by Infinity, Jammo or Pioneer.   As for wiring the system it depends on how comfertable you are using tools and fishing walls the hardest to wire are usually the rear speakers many times in a single story home you can follow the cable wire down from the attic and the rest of the speakers can be wired behind the TV and the stereo center. Hope this helps.|`|UinOWcMUaa	You live in CA ?|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	First of all, Bose sucks.  They are just way overpriced.  If you can't afford an HDTV Bose is the last company you should consider for your surround sound system.  Just get the Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver and a Polk Audio (RM6750 or RM705) or some other such surround sound speaker kit.  Unlike Bose, you can do it for under $1,000.  That way you can save the extra cash toward a TV.

3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	Yes this is a piracy feature. You are required to have the disk in the console to play an installed game. If they didn't do this you could just rent a game, install it, and then return the game and still have it. Game companies would not make any money this way. The point of installing games was to reduce wear and tear on the console's disk drive/ the disks, and to reduce load times for some games.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No.  The whole point of downloading the game to the hard drive is to speed up the loading time.<br>  <br>  MS is not going to let you install the game to a hard drive without having the disk in the DVD tray because it would be too easy to rent or the game, install it, and get the game without buying the game.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	the point of it is to speed up the loading time and for it to not spin|`|AChwrDrOaa	You need the disc to play it. Downloading it to the hard drive makes the game run smoother and it will make less noise because it doesnt spin the disc. But you need the disc to make sure you own the game, otherwise people would just be renting games and microsoft would be poor
2sMA3HQCaa	If you click on the "Watts/channel" term link in the specification list where you saw "Watts/channel  10" for this LCD set, you'll get a dialog box that says, "Watts/Channel   Power per speaker. The higher the power, the louder the sound."<br>  <br>  In other words, it's talking about the available amplifier power output for stereo sound channels (the left & right internal speakers), not TV channels.

Samsung put this feature on the 750 series and up. I found it online roughly in your price range. The 750 series is identical to the 650 series but adds more features like movie play back and X.V. color.<br>  <br>  To the guy below me. Some people like the way the 120hz looks.

ssoZ33XIaa	There are a couple of ways, but the easiest way is to use a program like Windows Media Player or Nero to burn the CD.  With Windows Media Player, go into the Burn Tab, create a burn list of all the files you want on the CD, make sure it is set to burn into the appropriate format (Audio or Data), and then hit the burn button.  You can also create a folder of all the files you want on the CD and then tell Windows to burn the files to CD.  Or if you have iTunes, you can use this to burn a CD as well.
PTdmFxMJaa	you download as many songs as you want in a month. you lose those songs after you stop paying for the Zune Pass. So every month you can keep 10 songs permanently. you don't lose your songs every month, only when you unsubscribe.

COh882Pxaa	You'd probably benefit from setting your iPod to be manually managed (when it's plugged in, this option is on the main iPod screen when you click on your iPod in iTunes' device list).<br>  <br>  What this means is that instead of iTunes automatically syncing music to your iPod (deleting and readding everything each time), you just drag and drop what you want from your library onto your iPod. When you first set it to be manually managed, iTunes will want to erase everything off your iPod. This just happens when you make the initial change, afterwards the only time music gets deleted is when you manually delete them or restore your iPod.<br>  <br>  It's a convenient mode if you want to use your iPod with more than one computer, as well, since you don't have to worry about losing all the music from you got from one machine when you plug it into another.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	you can. i have 1000s of songs on itunes but i deleted them off my computer by converting them to acc on itunes.

E ambos funcionam bem em TODOS os estados brasileiros.|`|rZeBa1dkaa	Eu tenho Oi e posso falar que n?o é bom sinal n?o. Acho que a Oi tem liga??es muito caras, liga??es péssimas que n?o completam ou d?o linha cruzada e como se n?o bastasse ela tem grandes falhas no Rio de Janeiro principalmente nas estradas com serras e morros ela deixa a desejar.Agora o comercial na televis?o é uma gracinha com aquelas criancinhas !!!!!!!   Affffff !!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  No Rio e S?o Paulo tenho visto que a Vivo tem melhor sinal que a Oi.<br>  <br>  A Claro pode ser boa nao conhe?o tanto o sinal dela em Sao Paulo e Rio mas em Minas a rede ainda está engatinhando pois tem pouco tempo por lá.<br>  <br>  Bom , em geral as redes tem coberturas diferentes e para se escolher a operadora depende de qual lugar voce vai funcionar mais o seu aparelho.<br>  <br>  <br>  Em minas gerais por exemplo a Telemig Celular é a preferida entre os fazendeiros e sitiantes pois o sinal pode ser captado até mesmo dentro de cavernas profundas. O sinal é realmente o melhor de Minas Gerais mas a tecnologia n?o é mto disponivel em outros estados. (TDMA)

Open the media player, there is an icon on the left of the seek bar that will convert to 3GP and save.<br>  alternatively you can download a program called winavimp4converter from www.winavi.com this program allows you to convert to MP4,3GP, ipod and psp.<br>  good luck if you require more info or help feel free to im or email me via yahoo
d1cbc4d492efc8f34217aa3925e9c5c1aa	ok lets look at what you want in a phone, fast internet so you want 3G. downloading videos and screensavers you want mp4. video calling maybe? Well if you want all of that I would sugest you look at the samsung Z400 its a small slide phone that is packed with an almighty punch! I have the nokia 6680 with all the above but its a brick in comparrision to my wifes Z400 which does the same but is not symbian.<br>  hope you find this usefull.|`|c7516dacf1a537324259b8bcae4c374baa	I have the sony ericcson w300i. The 600i is great as well.I had that too and am selling it cause the 300 is a flip and i like it better. Tons of talk time. Its an mp3 player and has all the bells and whistles and a good amount of memory. It also comes with a cable and cd for transferring data. A simple free download and you can actually make your own ringtones like i do and never pay for a ringtone again
