7HxJvbjMaa	I never had any luck taming lovebirds. I ended up trading in my two lovebirds for one cockatiel and it was worth it. My cockatiel was so sweet & tame, he even learned to repeat a few phrases.|`|BYfmKhVwaa	yeah use 11 herbs and spices|`|kixQWODVaa	slowly try and gain their trust.  Give them treats by hand and slowly they will start to trust you after they are taking treats from your hand set the treat on your palm to get them to sit on your fingers.  this wont be immediate it will take weeks before you should even try to get them on your hand just go slow.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	<a href="http://parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame_a_small_bird.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame_a_s...</a>   it might take a while make sure they can't see their cage or each other if you try this.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	The problem is, they've bonded with eachother instead of you. You need to separate them from eachother for awhile and give them time to bond with you. Clipping their wings would make a big difference. It really does help! Do not try to do it yourself! Have your vet do it the first few times so they can show you how. I have ONE lovebird and he's got an incredible bond with me but if I got him a companion, our bond would most likely be broken. My lovebird has bonded with one of his toys and looks to it as his "mate". He gets aggressive when I leave that toy in his cage. If I take it out, he's a different bird! He gets very affectionate and cuddly with me.<br>  <br>  This is my lovebird, Tico <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Hcv_jb31M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Hcv_jb3...</a><br>  <br>  =D
UNFxjNHkaa	ahhh, you should be keeping him inside anyway!  Its much safer for him and he'll live longer and have a healthier life.  I've heard too many horror stories about peoples cats getting run over by cars or killed by other stray animals!  I always keep my little ones indoors!<br>  <br>  He could also just be meowing because he's been sitting at the door too long waiting for you to let him in!|`|ef5KDy0Gaa	He smells a female near,that is in heat and he's calling out .This is natural behavior.|`|AY6pYPQNaa	I have no idea.  I wish I could get mine to give me some peace.  She yowls at the back door, which just leads into a mud room.  I try to let her go out the front.  She takes one look at the rain, squeaks, jumps back, and refuses to go outside.  Then she starts up yowling again, which I just can't handle in the mornings.  I squirt her with water and tell her no, but she doesn't always make the connection from the yowling to the water.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong- I don't mind some vocalization, but hers is at the top of her lungs, basically yelling at me or trying to see how much she can get her voice to echo in the house, I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  I do know that it's driving me crazy.
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Hopefull you will get some education about it or someone to "mentor" you for a while when you start.  The most important aspect of your work is to just be with the cats.  Some like to play with interactive toys, some like to sit in laps and be petted, some are very shy and a little fearful of human interactions.<br>  <br>  Our shelter has a highly organised system for cat socializers.  Written comments about each cat's behavior are required so that adoption staff can have a record of "progress", temperment, etc. in order to give as much information as possible to people considering adopting a particular cat.  It's invaluable to know the level of a cat's interaction with people - whether it is suitable for a home with young children or better for a quiet adult-only home, whether it likes to be groomed or not.<br>  <br>  It is a pleasant and rewarding way to volunteer.  You will learn a lot about cat behavior in general.|`|1tiCB311aa	Cats can be finicky. I managed a shelter for many years. The best thing to do is be patient with them. When they first come to the shelter they may be stressed. You may need to give them a day or two to get use to their surroundings. Talk to them in a calm voice. When you start to pet them approach them with your palm up, let them smell you and see if they will approach you first. Some times you can get their attention with a piece of string or a feather. I would not use cat nip at first because that is like a drug to them and can change their personality. <br>  After you become their friend then you can groom them, by brushing them. They may need a bath. There are special bags that you can put them in so you don't get scratched when you bathe them. I never used them. I sing to the cats when I bathe them. Always run the bath first, cats don't like the sound of running water. There are also products on the market that the shelter may use to clean the cats. You just sprinkle it on like powder and brush them. You'll have to check with your shelter to see what they do. Just be careful. If a cat bites you it really hurts and will become infected very quickly.|`|hGY08GjRaa	You'll brush and comb them so they look nice. (maybe keep ears and eye clean and nails trimmed??) You'll spend time talking to them, handling them , playing with them (so they are used to people and not afraid)<br>  <br>  It should be pretty light work..<br>  <br>  Oh.. true.. you may actually help give cats baths as well.. LOL.. that's always interesting LOL (depends on the cat.. most of mine have never been violent about it)
MFZr5yhAaa	Yes. Just make sure and check the filter and make sure it's actually a filter for a 55g and not something smaller.|`|yV8fog7Paa	Try to get a little lower -- try 100$.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Yes that is a great deal!! I would recommend some moor fish for that tank maybe like 6 of em.

I use a cheap dresser that had scratches on the top, and I use the drawers for storage under it.  I paid $189 for the kit at Walmart, and I think they just lowered the price.<br>  <br>  By buying new, you won't have to go and buy another filter in 3 months, and you can get what rocks and plants you want to have.<br>  <br>  At $125, it'd be a good deal, but I see you spending $50 on a filter within a year.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	As long as it is in good shape, thats a great deal.<br>  <br>  As for the person who suggested 6 moor fish, that is way too many goldfish for that size tank.

ns9NqKXzaa	not all budgies like water...some do, some dont.<br>  mine dont really, every now and then, (maybe every 2 or 3 weeks) i catch them having a quick dip in their cage, but thats about it. I've read that they preen and clean themselves often so if they don't like water, don't force them. :)|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your parakeet sounds like he's afraid of the bathtub.  Some budgies enjoy bathing, while others don't.  I'd try putting a wet lettuce leaf or two in a plate to encourage the budgie to bathe.  That has worked for some of my budgies, as they hopped onto the plate and bathed.  Fun to watch, too.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Maybe he doesn't like to be watched while he takes a bath.<br>  <br>  Unless your watching him 24/7 you have no clue if he is using it.|`|m1ypmbNKaa	He might get the water sometime your not around bird dont do things when human are around.When we leave they might do the things.Some birds love water while other dont bird can take a bath when there drinking water they just dip there face down the water really quick and start picking them self around there body.My bird doesnt like taking a bath so i got a sprayer and sprayed him like 3 times he just shakes and he is cleaner.|`|BjItitz5aa	If you live in a cold or temperate country, you can't easily nudge your pet to take a dip. Hardly. But when it is warm or extremely hot, they will even long to have a watering hole around and a place to get wet.|`|AA10036232	not all parakeet like to dip themselves in water, so what i do is, i take a spray bottle(clean of course lol) and i fill it with warm water and sprinkle with it. They love to run under the water. hope that helps you.
a2cjwMKcaa	Most likely they will fight. the male will not tollerate any other betta in his territory unless it's a female in breeding condition. <br>  <br>  If the female is stronger she may well defend herself, and kill the male. Either way, it's NOT a good idea.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The male would probably harass the female. He could tear her fins, or possibly kill her, especially in a tank that size. Only once a pair has been properly conditioned can they be put together to breed. <br>  <br>  A 2.5 gallon tank is only large enough to house a single male betta, and nothing else.|`|JnElq85taa	No no no, I did this once.  I had a male betta named Terrance and I thought he looked lonely so I got him a girl betta and named her Magda.  In my fantasy little fish world, thought they would keep each other company and mate.  <br>  <br>  Yeah, NO.  Terrance just became aggressive and chased Magda around the tank.  She hid wherever and whenever she could and stopped eating.  She seemed so miserable that I brought her back to the pet store.  The guy working there was like, "yeah, that's not uncommon when you put a male and female betta in the same tank."  I was like, "Thanks for telling me that when I BOUGHT it."  Oh well.  The bottom line:  I would advise against it.|`|D178335Paa	DON'T DO IT!! the only time they are to be together is when breeding. this takes a long time of conditioning. about a month. He will kill her.|`|BH9rZzWMaa	I believe both breeding or fighting has a great chance of happening.<br>  So don't put them in the same tank.|`|r8LJEJwbaa	They will attack each other O.o|`|yKZQoLDoaa	They will breed!!!!!!!!!!! You'll have to put them in different tanks. I have a boy, and he blows bubbles to the top of the bowl because he thinks he is going to mate and if he did the girl would put the baby eggs in those bubbles at the top until they hatched.<br>  <br>  Boys and Boys will fight.<br>  Girls and Girls will fight.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know about Boys and Girls fighting I have never seen it, but I know they WILL mate!|`|MFZr5yhAaa	They'll probably fight, and your male would most likely get the worse of it. If you want to have them in the same tank without any problems, try and put in a divider, many pet stores sell them but you would probably have to cut it to fit your tank.|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	hello try this web sight ok.<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/FemaleBettaCare" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/FemaleBettaCare</a><br>  <br>  hoped i helped!|`|reeZXp4Maa	MURDER!!! aaauuhhhh!!!|`|P8xN2IzIaa	I think they may mate.   I think male bettas just don't like other male bettas, but mate with the female.|`|LRHjirzhaa	probably kill each other or breed, haha|`|zxNEewYzaa	He WILL eat her.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	May be they'll just stay friends ?|`|kZXZfpr2aa	the male would mate by releasing sperm into the water. the female might or might not lay some eggs. then eat the females fins off. thats what happened when i put a female in with my male. 2males will try to kill each other. it is really hard to breed bettas. they are very dominate.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	Well, they will probably breed if you put them together. Maybe you should just buy the female her own tank just to make sure they don't fight or breed|`|ePLULWSjaa	BABIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|kFt3WP0naa	They will kill each other they would not mate they would just kill each other thats it
eyKx05LKaa	First of all you can't keep a male and female betta together permanently.  They will attack each other.  Only put them together for a short while to mate. Once they mate, you will NEED to move her to a different tank.  It's not a question of can you, you will need to.  The male takes care of the eggs.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	A spawning tank should be 5-10 gallons. <br>  <br>  The female must be removed immediately after spawning. She will eat the eggs and the male will fiercely guard his bubble nest which puts her in danger. After spawning the female should be removed and allowed to recooperate in at least a 2.5 filtered, and heated aquarium.<br>  <br>  Betta breeding is a time consuming, expensive undertaking.|`|kFt3WP0naa	when you breed bettas the male squeezes the eggs out of her them he fertilizes them and puts the in the bubble nest once they have done this a few times take the female out or else she will ether get killed by dad or eat the eggs<br>  <br>  try this web sit bettatalk.com<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry about spelling
OFpl236faa	Depends on the type of Terrier you are looking at. Are there any children in the house? How much are you willing to exercise? Do you have cats? A fenced yard?<br>  <br>  Most Terriers are very active and don't always just settle in the house if they had a walk. They take a lot of patience because they are very independent and hard to train. We have 3 Jack Russell Terriers and we do a lot of training and conditioning. They are not good with cats or small children because they like to nip. Ours shed a lot! It seems to be barbed so you can't just brush the hair off. <br>  <br>  I would really suggest going and looking on petfinder.com or looking into a rescue. They screen the dogs to fit your needs and will help you find the best match for you. It might be better to look at a dog who is over a year old so you know temperament and personality. Plus no potty training! It'll be a lot easier as a first time dog owner.|`|2bqXYdQ4aa	hiya. yorkies are long haired but ar good fun. i would say <br>  a gsd , a beagle a chihuahua [yappy though] great dane wippets they r lush and they dont need much walking at all and r very cute get one of them plz let me know what u decide|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	golden retrievers are the best! they were my first dog and i still have her now! she was very easy to train they love the outside if u train them well and keep training and recapping her training they will be quiet and wont cause a lot of trouble! <br>  <br>  Terriers do bark a lot and they like the outside but some are not the easiest to train.<br>  <br>  U need to ask yourself a couple more questions like:<br>  will u be with the dog a lot<br>  will u give it lots of love<br>  will u give it lots of exercise <br>  good luck with ur dog!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. golden retrievers are the best with children and i mean the BEST|`|tTntRZNDaa	You may want to find out your perfect dog match by taking the short quiz below.

How much indoor/ outdoor time?  Do you want a dog that is very athletic or one that wants to be a little more lazy?  <br>  <br>  I always recommend a Labrador retriever!  I am partial because they are the dogs that I have but I feel that they are great!! Labs are smart, they love to play and they love to cuddle!  When its time for them to lay down and chill out they will.  They are a good size for me but they are one of the bigger dogs 60-100 lbs.  My 2 labs are the best dogs that anyone could ask for.  The were very easy to potty train and know many commands and love children.  Get a lab they are great dogs!!!|`|REO6bHEUaa	My favourite breed in the world is a boxer.  Grooming wise very low maintenance, but needs loads of exervcise though.They are not great noisey barkers either, but are mischevious and can be stubborn, but are beautiful dogs and very very loving. Great with kids, probably cause they are like puppies for years and  they get along with other dogs too.

1WkO82e2aa	Depends on your location. In North Carolina it runs me about:<br>  <br>  One Horse -<br>  Hay $400 a year (100 square bales)<br>  Vet $40 farm call and $60 shots<br>  Grain 4lbs a day - $15 a bag - $360 a year<br>  Farrier - About 6 trims a year with shoes on front $300<br>  <br>  As long as she doesn't have any accidents and I don't breed her. <br>  Other farriers charge a different rate, Vets charge different, grain and feed prices vary across the country, and hay depends on your region as well. This is just what it cost me to keep up one horse that is an easy keeper. My mini horses are about 1/2 this and I have a racking gelding that cost me about twice this.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Depending on the part of the country you are in makes a big cost difference in feed and such.<br>  <br>  Snow on the ground from November til March will add a bunch to feed costs.<br>  <br>  7 acres of grass year round will just support 2 horses presuming you have 1 acre that is no pasture.<br>  <br>  3 acres per horse is a good rule.<br>  <br>  The following is based on feeding morning and night in the bard versus pasture horses.<br>  <br>  Feed will run $7 - $21per bag depending on the brand and such<br>  You will use 1 to 2 bags per week per horse<br>  <br>  Hay, currently $9 per bale in my area<br>  1 bale per horse per week<br>  <br>  Farrier, $35 - $85 for trimming per six weeks<br>  shoes double the cost at minimum<br>  <br>  vet, if you give your own shots it saves a bunch.<br>  plan on a budget of $20 per month per horse for shots<br>  and coggins tests<br>  <br>  wormer, we worm every 6 weeks when the farrier is out<br>  $13 to $20 per head<br>  <br>  Total cost per horse per month is about 75-120 per month not including the increased power bill from the increased usage of your water well and barn lights.<br>  <br>  I would go with what is comfortable for you to ride.<br>  I ride a spotless paint or a mutt all the time.<br>  <br>  Age wise, a good seasoned horse around 7 years old will do you good as long as its well trained, in good health, and is sane.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	I would recommend an Appaloosa, QH(while i dont like either breeds) or a walking horse. They tend to be laid back. if your a beginner, I would get something around 10 years old.<br>  <br>  As far as costs, it depends. For the farrier... we are charged $20 for a trim and I think $45 for shoeing. Feed really depends on what you get. I get sweet feed, which is about 8-10 bucks a bag. Now I have to say, the vet is probably the most expensive. I pay around $215 every vet visit(annually), that includes coggins(infectious equine anemia), rabies vaccine, tetnus vaccine and various other tests and vaccines, usually of your choice.<br>  <br>  Good luck owning horses!|`|AA11570905	You should get two horses of a size and temperment to match your skill level.  Breed and age don't matter as long as you are skilled and educated enough to handle them.  I have to assume you are a beginner though so I would suggest stock type horses, quarter horses or paints, 8-15 years old.  Well broke, well trained, described as "easy keepers" and child safe, calm, been there done that temperments.  <br>  <br>  I paid $2000 for feed and hay for my three horses last year (I only have to buy hay for 1/2 the year)<br>  My horses are kept barefoot and my farrier charges $25  per horse at my house. I paid $450 to the farrier last year.<br>  <br>  my vet makes one farm call each year where I pay him $45 just to get into my drive way.  Then every body gets shots, gets blood drawn for their coggins test, and teeth floated.  My bill comes to over $400.00 easy.  <br>  <br>  That all works out to nearly $1000 per year per horse for just the bare basics of food, farrier and vet.  It will probably cost you lots more,  I'm pretty sure I pay more than that in the long run.<br>  <br>  You also need to have some money in reserve in case someone gets injured or sick.<br>  <br>  Edit:  forgot to mention wormers....they don't cost much but you will still need them and should be included in the bare basics.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	-Quarter Horse<br>  -Appaloosa<br>  -Morgan<br>  -National Show Horse<br>  -Foundation Saddlebred <br>  Any horse is good for trail it all just depends on your riding capabilities<br>  5-15 good age. <br>  <br>  The first thing I always look at before purchasing a horse is hooves!! I like big solid hooves. I love to buy horses that are barefoot with no lameness, always a good sign. <br>  <br>  Second is confirmation, good disposition. Good idea is to buy a confirmation book and read about what good is. <br>  <br>  $3,000-$4,500 dollars depending on farrier work and possible fluctuation in prices for feed, hay, farrier work. For farrier work you could spend every eight weeks(if the horses required shoes) $100-150 depending on what type of shoe a horse needs. Vet bills can vary as well depending on possible injuries that could happen through accidents. <br>  <br>  And when you think you like a horse see if your vet is able to come with you, or have their vet come out and do a vet check. One time I was lucky enough to be able to take the horse home and have my vet look at it and work with the horse outside his home. And if I was not satisfied, it wasn't the horse I was looking for, I could return him back to the owner.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3wIZiZA5aa	Definatly American Quarter Horses! If your a begginer I would get in the age range of 5-10 yrs old, and make sure the horse is broke! The avarage cost is pretty big, but not bad. My farrier charges $40 for a trim/horse and $90 for shoes/horse. Saddles can run any where from $350-$1200. Feed: I feed Purina Stragety @ $11/bag. Vet: My vet charges a $25 farm call and it goes up from whatever she needs to do. <br>  <br>  Hope This Helps!|`|brVS3Pg0aa	k, if you dont have much experience with horses, i would advise a middleaged (11-15) quarter horse, or maybe an arab cross if you have riding experience. Average cost per week is about 50 dollars for feed and hay, farrier bills will come every 6-9 weeks, and if you are just trailriding, shoes arent needed, so about 60 dollars for that. Dentist visits you could prolly strethch to every year and half and they are quite expensive, but not unbearable. Dont forget bedding, about 20 dollars a week for shavingd, 15 for straw. Vet bills are about 40 dollars per shot, and your horses would need atleast 4, but i wont go into cauz some come as every ther year, others as boosters, 3 in consecutive months with 2 yrs inbetween and stuff like that. Farm call will also be added (60 dollars). You will also need to worm atleast twice a year, twelve dollars per horse per time. Then you add the tack costs and your set! Hope it gives you a rough estimate, Good Luck.|`|YPUu34G0aa	Maybe quarter horses, really really calm.. 5-10 y/o.<br>  Each horse of mine is 3k a year, but i don't do farrier i have mine barrefoot :D<br>  <br>  But good luck(:

It is artificial sweeteners that are the problem.  Common poisonous foods for dogs are avocados, chocolate, macadamia nuts, coffee, onions, raisins, grapes, salt, yeast dough, garlic, alcoholic drinks, and spoiled foods.  The ASPCA has a good site: animal poison control.|`|7cUDstdjaa	She'll pass it as normal, but may get a bit messed-up at the back end and need you to bathe her.<br>  Don't forget to walk her as this always helps.|`|AA10648704	Relax.  As my husband says, it too shall pass.  As long as she is acting normal, she should be fine.

Our dog even ate a razor once and did just fine, much to our relief.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	She should be fine. Dogs actually have stronger stomachs that we do. We can swallow gum and be just fine.

C75EsUXRaa	I bought mine harnessess, they went absolutely panic stricken when I put them on even though they were tame placid houserabbits, so I never tries again instead I rabbit proofed my garden opened the back door and they just went in and out as they pleased, I suppose the trick is to learn them to wear the harness from a young age ''you can't teach an old dog new tricks'' so to speak
mFf8CqAraa	I have a kitten that does this sometimes. We already have 2 older cats so I don't think it's because she's lonely. She wanders around the house (when I'm in plain sight) and starts mewing. <br>  <br>  She's part siamese and I think this is part of that breeds mannerisms. When I say, "What?!" she finally comes over purring like crazy. So I'll scratch her and pet her for a little bit and she's fine. I've deduced that she just wants attention from a human. But why she walks around mewing when she can see me is beyond me. <br>  <br>  I don't think it has anything to do with your chicken strips as cats have a 10-minute short term memory.|`|3b8384b9a301d00c1a1f9851c0b2c058aa	because your cat wants attention<br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApR5dErMHOHwm5FgbN1kX37sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225133856AACAgFG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LFeEoHj3aa	This could be caused by a million things...<br>  <br>  1.

How long have you had it, it is normal if you haven't had it for a while and is now meowing...<br>  <br>  Just play with it, and if you can you should adopt another baby for he or she to play with!!! =)<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED...!|`|rLRid8NEaa	She needs a friend.  that happened to me. I had one kitten, and she meowed because she needed someone to play with. Just get another kitten that she can play with. She stopped meowing as soon as she played with him. They have so much fun together. Make sure to get a playful nice one =)|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	she either wants your attention are she could be hungry and she is to young to be eating chicken strips anyways you should be feeding her kitten formula and baby kitten feed that are in cans. so you need to go to walmart my kitten friend.
hetZz4c1aa	I have never had antibiotics prescribed after spaying my girls, but there must be times when a vet feels it is appropriate.  And, many vets use stitches that do not have to be removed.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA10129150	I've never been given antibiotics after any of our cats were spayed.

The only medication sent home is pain control.  <br>  As far as sutures, it depends on the doctor performing the surgery.  Two of my doctors use external sutures, and 2 use surgical glue.  It's their personal preference.<br>  If they have sent antibiotics home and you have questions regarding them, please contact the hospital. They would rather you call with questions about medications than not having your pet getting the proper treatment.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Not normally.  I've had many cats over the years, and I currently own 4.  Only one of them was sent home with antibiotics and pain medication after being spayed, and that was because she was a stray in not very good health and the vet was concerned about infection.  The stitches should be of the self-dissolving type, so that seems a bit unusual.|`|4D7nhSHnaa	No.  They are usually given at the time of the surgery.  Only if there's a complication after the pprocedure and it entails an infection of some sort will an antibiotic prescribed. I hope this helped.|`|AA11821009	An injection of a long-acting antibiotic is normal at the clinic I work at.  Medication is only sent home if there is something abnormal in regards to the surgery.  Some vets may send it home routinely - it wouldn't hurt.

That's great. I learned the hard way about pine chips and store-bought cages being too small. Something you may want to consider is getting two piggies right away. Or check your local animal shelter (if you haven't already) to see if there is a piggie in there that could use a home. Guinea Pigs usually thrive better with a companion. Also, go to the grocery store and stock up on fresh veggies (peppers, parsley, romaine, green and red lettuce, endive, cilantro, etc) and lots of Timothy Hay (as well as a Timothy Based food... it will be the first ingredient!!)<br>  <br>  As for harnesses... I don't know, I've never had one on my piggies. They pretty much go where they want and I think if I'd get them harnessed up they would just sit there and look at me with little disapproving faces. I'd imagine as long as you don't yank them in any weird kind of way it can't hurt them. <br>  <br>  Oh and do not get any sort of excersise ball. They are really really bad for piggies' backs. And no yogurt drop treats. They are strict vegetarians and can not process animal byproducts (yogurt, in this case)<br>  <br>  Well in any case. good luck with your new guinea pig!! sounds like you are off to a great start!

8f6d7df4f9a9d1837489325dea55817caa	Yorkies come in one size, they are in the "Toy" group. People breeding 'teacup' dogs are doing it for money, teacups have horrible health problems down the road.    ***      What is a "teacup" dog?  Well, actually it's more of a marketing term or gimmick. Some breeders or retailers use this term to indicate an individual of extremely tiny size, most often 1-4 pounds as adults. Typically it's in association with breeds such as Maltese, Poodles, Yorkies, and other toy breeds. The American Hairless Terrier is also a victim of this ploy. There is NO official 'teacup' size...these are indeed TOY breeds (the AHT is actually a terrier) but they are not TEACUP breeds, and none of the standards provide for such a 'variety'.    So do 'teacup' dogs even exist?  Of course they do. For one reason or another very small individuals do occur in any breed. Though even these individuals face many of the problems of tiny dogs, the problems become worse when these tinies are then bred to each other. NO reputable breeder will deliberately breed exceptionally tiny individuals.    Size Guarantees and how to they get those tiny dogs?  There aren't any perfect guarantees. Period. Size is determined by a number of factors: Genetics (parents, grandparents. etc.) as well as being affected by environment (nutrition, medical care, etc.). Genetic contribution by the parents is 50/50 (NO - the male is NOT genetically "stronger" then the female. High school biology should have taught you that) and the parent's parents also contribute. Wonder why your puppy has a curly tail and his parent's have straight tails? Look to the grandparents (or maybe even further back). Same goes for size.    Those 'teacup' puppies you see may genuinely grow up to be tiny...or they may have falsified papers indicating they are older they they really are (and won't you have a surprise when your 'puppy' suddenly grows, well, BIG?). The thing is, even the runt often catches up to his sibling and grows into a normal size adult. So even a "tiny" puppy won't necessarily grow into a 'tiny' adult. Most often, those that deliberately market "teacups" are also breeding from pet or unknown lines, or worse buying from puppy mills with even LESS care about these puppies and haven't done the research needed to know a pedigree. They simply put two "small" adults together and sell the offspring as 'teacup'....again, what a surprise for the new owner when their 'teacup' puppy is now a perfectly normal 10 pounds or so! NO person - breeder, pet store worker, etc. - can guarantee a size. A knowledgeable breeder may be able to give you a sound and reasonably accurate estimate of size range based on knowledge of pedigree, the parents, the breed, etc. But until a dog is mature (as late as 24 months) there is no way to give you a 100% guarantee of size. Remember that when someone tells you they 'guarantee' it will be a teacup - they also know if it grows too big you're probably too attached to give it back in order to get your refund or replacement.    We once saw a photo of a 'teacup' adult...it was a normal size adult (on the smaller end of the standard, but normal) and it was posed in an extra large 'tea' cup!!! From the photo it looked like a real tea cup and many a person has been fooled by it! Be smart in your research.    Health risks a teacup faces...  Exceptionally tiny individuals face a number of health risks based on their size alone.        * Fragility results in easily broken bones, especially legs, when they jump off a piece of furniture or a lap. There have been cases of bones simply shattering on impact in the course of normal playing, tumbling around on the floor or yard, or being held too firmly. One adult was routinely carried in the owner's pocket and caught a leg on the pocket, breaking it from relatively minor force.      * Often a 'teacup' dog's mouth is simply not big enough to accommodate all it's adult teeth and problems arise with crowded teeth, deteriorating adult teeth, etc.      * Internal organs may not be fully or adequately developed.      * One of the biggest problems with any tiny is that they expend so much energy simply trying to keep their own body temperature normal, that they can't consume enough calories to fuel their own body and essentially starve to death despite proper feeding. They require careful care and monitoring because they often simply can't maintain a healthy body temperature.      * Tinies may have problems regulating their own blood sugar.      * A simple case of diarrhea can kill a teacup since it dehydrates so quickly, and will most likely cost a minimum of a trip to the vet.      * It is not uncommon for a teacup to die at a very young age, even with an owner who takes the best of care. (Of course those that make a living selling these dogs aren't too bothered since this certainly opens up the market for them to sell you another one!).    Small size equals big purchase price  Just in case the risks aren't enough, the final insult is the exceptionally high prices that are often tagged on these diminutive babies. Dubbed "designer dogs", their price tags are typically FAR in excess of a price of a normal, healthy, well bred puppy from a reputable breeder. Some sellers require hefty deposits that equal the entire costs of another puppy! It is not uncommon to see price tags in the $2000.00-$3000.00 range.    But I really want the smallest individual I can get...  Be very sure you're willing to take on the necessary care required. Are you going to be able to protect it from accidents? Provide adequate warmth, food, vet care? Have you educated yourself on the risks involved and are willing to take that chance that something could happen?    First consider smaller breeds (such as the Chihuahua) that are normally very small compared to most other breeds.

You can find a good breeder through the AKC website, too - buy from someone in the breed's club and that tests & certifies their breeding dogs from genetic defects known to the breed.

Porem veja bem.,    Voce ja viu a NOSSA NATUREZA., a do SER HUMANO???    Olha a Descricao:    SER HUMANOS- quando criancas -inocentes e lindinhos.,porem bem pequenos ja comecam a mostrar o mal caratismo.  Brigam por causa dos brinquedos com outras criancas.,batem,mordem para nao levarem O QUE CONSIDERAM SEU.  Crescem e pioram:  Ja grandes tem um comportamento .,Intrigueiros.,Ciumentos,Possessivos , entre o Amor e o Odio.(Em seus relacionamentos Pessoais)    Porem o que descrevo abaixo(nao e diferente do que voce fala)  Veja:  Eles escolhem o Boi ou Vaca que vao matar.

OS Porcos (coitados)sao rodeados ate a sua cabeca no Fogo e servido em bandejas para Nos nos deliciarem.    Os Pobres Carneiros,e ate os Peixes nao escapam.    Nos Paises que desconhecem nossa Cultura ainda sao mais estranhos:  Comem nossos Cachorros.,Gatos.,Cobras,baratas, formigas e toda sorte de coisa que Nos nao queremos.    Ah esqueci.,temos TRIBOS CANIBAIS que tambem nos Comem como comida.    Ah esqueci tambem de citar.,que os Humanos conseguem ser pior .,pois Nos conseguimos devido a nossa Inteligencia ABORTAR nossos Filhos(antes que nascem)  Porem muitos que dao Bobeira.,esperam nascer seus BEBES e depois os colocam nos LIXOS ,na maioria das vezes VIVOS.  Outros sao jogados em Bueiros e ate nos RIOS.    Voce ainda se acha melhor que este seu GATO?????    Ou pensa que geneticamente e UMa sobrevivencia para permanecer VIVO.

Gatos devem ser esterilizados e mantidos dentro de casa.    Gatos domsticos n?o sabem se defender como muitos pensam, eles n?o vivem mais numa selva. Mas vivem junto a maldade de muitos humanos, eles n?o tem conscincia dos risco que correm nas ruas.     Voc comeria algo que algum desconhecido te desse ou voc achasse na rua? N?o! Porque voc sabe que aquilo poderia te fazer mau. Mas os gatos comem, porque n?o tem conscincia do que  maldade, eles vivem por instinto, ent?o se querem comer, far?o isso.    Gatos que vivem nas ruas est?o sujeitos a muitos riscos. Atropelamentos, envenenamento, espancamentos, s?o sacrificados, tem gente que mata os bichinhos para comer a carne!! Jogam gua quente..     Fora isso tem as doen?as que podem pegar. Voc sabia que existe AIDS Felina, pois ! E n?o tem cura.  transmitida por um simples arranh?o ou mordida de algum gato contaminado. Ah! E n?o tem vacina para prevenir. E sabemos que os gatos de rua a maioria n?o  vacinado e vivem em brigas, ent?o o risco de se pegar AIDS  muito grande.    N?o arrisque a vida dos seus bichinhos assim. Vale a pena tanto cuidado, boa ra??o, carinho, veterinrio, se voc nem sabe se seu gatinho voltar para casa?  isso mesmo, com eles nas ruas nunca se sabe o que pode acontecer. E eles saber?o sim viver em casa. N?o ficar?o trancados. Coloque telas nos muros de sua casa. E se puder, fa?a um gatil para eles terem acesso tambm a parte de fora da casa, mas com prote??o.    Aqui est?o fotos de gatil e muros telados:    http://www.just4cats.com/post2.html    http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/backy...      Castrar  a melhor solu??o para evitar doen?as e que mais gatinhos inocentes venham ao mundo. Nem todos gostam de gatos n?o ! E fora que os que nascerem dificilmente ser?o esterilizados, gerando assim outros filhotes que por sua vez tambm n?o ser?o esterilizados, isso vira uma bola de neve e milhares de gatos nas ruas, abandonados, sendo maltratados.  .

Existe algum outro motivo que n?o seu puro capricho para estar atrs de um Sagrado da Birmania?    Algum parente adquiriu uma doen?a grave que s o ch feito do pelo do bicho poder salv-lo?    N?o existe nenhuma qualidade sua que voc possa ostentar entre amigos?      preciso usar a suposta nobreza do Sagrado para suprir a sua falta total de qualidades?    Pretende, ir ainda mais baixo, e cruzar o seu gato para tirar dinheiro da prostitui??o do mesmo?    Sabe que para cada animal comprado outro morre nas piores condi??es em outro lugar. Sofrendo pela superpopula??o, que  resultado direto do egosmo caprichoso que voc esta demonstrando agora.    Sou protetor de animais, e sugiro que procure adotar um gato, ao invs de comprar um. N?o porque, ao adotar voc est salvando uma vida, mas porque n?o estar condenando covardemente vrias e financiando a crueldade dos criadores.    Ra?as de c?es e gatos s?o um produto hediondo de cruzamentos caprichosos de um animal doente, o Homem. Nada que existe nas ra?as  qualidade. S parecem qualidade aos olhos de pessoas miopes como voc.    Tudo que vemos saltar aos olhos em qualquer ra?a de animal  o resultado de cruzamentos intencionais e seletivos entre diversos animais ao longo de anos, e at sculos. N?o existe nada de natural num Persa, enquanto Persa. Seu nariz achatado compromete sua respira??o e promove secre??es lacrimais que podem gerar infec??es oftlmicas. S?o mostros que criamos para satisfazer um capricho.    Capricho  coisa de crian?a, se me permite a sinceridade. Quantos anos voc tem?    N?o sei se fa?o um mal em sugerir isso a voc, mas como n?o lhe conhe?o e posso salvar a vida de um gato, a vai.    Saiba que j testemunhei nestes anos como protetor de animais uma boa dzia de ado??es de gatos Sagrados da Birmania. Certa vez quiseram me dar um casal, e recussei, pois vinam de uma outra protetora, que fatalmente encontraria outro lar para eles.    Qualquer protetor que tenha um Sagrado teria prazer em lhe dar o gato, por 0,00 $.    Estranho n?    N?o, n?o .    Ainda existem pessoas que n?o olham para os animais avaliando as vatagens que podem tirar deles, e n?o os consideram objetos valorativos como relgios.    S tem um porm, aqui. Nenhum protetor vai lhe entregar o gato inteiro. Voc ter seu Sagrado para simples exposi??o aos amigos. Nunca tirar uma "valiosa" cria deste animal.    Ser que assim o bicho lhe interessa?

Saludos!|`|M1hDOCDJaa	Adoro los gatos que no tienen una raza determinada, siempre he tenido gatitos recogidos de la calle.

Mi tipo de gato, es el gato comn de la calle, (actualmente tengo 9), no porque no me gusten los de raza (me encantan!!!), pero no tendria un gato de raza, prefiero uno que no tenga "dueno" o "casa", uno que este abandonado.   En mi opinin los gatos de raza , como cuestan dinero, quien lo adopte seguramente lo va a cuidar bien, en cambio un gatito callejero o comn, lo mas probable es que no tenga la misma suerte, entonces prefiero adoptar uno de estos y darles una casa. Son muy agradecidos, y si los tratas con mucho cari?o, te responderan en la misma medida.  Tengo 2 hijos y siempre tuve gatos, (los cuido, y los mimo muchisimo), y jamas ningun gato nos ha ara?ado (mira que cuando eran peque?itos mis hijos, los agarraban de la cola, les tiraban las orejas, y los gatitos solo maullaban y trataban de saltar a algun lugar donde los chicos no los alcanzaran).

5598bd1170afaaf3f964f480815cc0a6aa	He may have been a bit constipated and the forcing and irritation of the bowel may have made him bleed a little, just like in humans sometimes.     If you believe he's constipated, try giving him a little bit of pumpkin (canned, just pumpkin, not pumpkin pie mix) with his food today or maybe he'll just lick it off the spoon.  The fiber in the pumpkin might help loosen him up enough so that passing stools aren't so difficult.    If you find today that he's still having trouble having a movement, call your vet tomorrow and let them know that he's having a problem and there is some bleeding.  They will ask you other questions (like how is he eating and acting, is he lethargic, etc) and based on that they will let you know if they want to see him or not.  This will allow you to make arrangements to get him there if necessary.|`|MMQfZA44aa	first off if you were bleeding from there you would go to a doctor right? its best to check with the vet  better to be safe than sorry|`|xHq0jKWNaa	take him to the vet that's how you will know for sure what's wrong  with him..  there could be many reasons why it happen. could be very serious. pay more attention to his behavior and his diet.. don't guess.  take him to the vet.|`|AA11499763	oh come on, you don't mentioned that online|`|4AVLAWABaa	Any time there is blood coming from your dogs anus you should get it to a vet. This happened to my dog once many years ago after a bout of diarrhea. I don't think it was too serious but the vet did a fecal sample and possibly prescribed antibiotics. Hopefully it's not too serious with your dog and could just be a small hemorrhage in the intestinal wall if he was constipated. Only a vet will know for sure.|`|KsXi08Ozaa	Get him to the vet ASAP.  Dont pay attention to those who are being judgmental when they dont know all the facts.  You know your situation so who cares what some stranger on the internet thinks.     This could be caused by something harmless, or of course, it could be serious.  Only your vet can make that call.  Since it sounds like it's going to be difficult for you to get to the vet, I would at least begin by calling your vet.  Ask to speak with a vet tech and explain what is going on. They will be better able to guide you in what to do next.  Depending on other factors they will ask you about, they may suggest waiting a day or so to see if his symptoms worsen/improve.  Definitely call your vet though -- with the possibility that it MIGHT be serious, you dont want to waste any time.    Good luck to you and your baby.|`|xZeuHcjZaa	If you love this dog at all get your dog to the Vet now!!!!! This can be a very serious thing.  Stop wasting your time on the net and go to the Vet. Your dog could be very sick!!!!!!!    Any any time a animal is having blood come from their body something is seriously wrong!!!!!    Good Luck|`|P1mi6pUYaa	This can be a symptom of lots of things, one of them being a punctured intestinal tract.  It would be best to take him to a vet.  Call your vet and tell them what's wrong and you don't have a car, see if someone can pick you up.  Or call a taxi or a friend.  If all else fails, and your dog is otherwise acting okay, grab some water and walk up to the vet yourself with your dog.  Your dog could be really sick.|`|ToqZuhOwaa	This is not a good sign. The dog may have gotten ahold of something and eaten it or it may have problems inside of his stomach. You should call a vet and ask for an appointment or ask for advice on what to do.|`|dSCQVtMGaa	Maybe you should get him a tampon so he doesn't bleed everywhere.|`|zhKouHzlaa	call your vet , he may have constipation or he may have ate something he shouldnt have or there could be a medicall problem , call and if they sugest to take him or her in do it. your dog is like family its better to ask a profesional and have him checked out ...|`|evma4Gwjaa	yes it can be a very serious problem,.  u should immideiately go to the doctor,|`|U0zkfFRQaa	The straining and blood could be signs of colitis, which can have many causes (dietary indiscretion,  infection, conditions such as Cushing's Disease, etc) so you should see your veterinarian ASAP for an evaluation. Bring a sample of the stool/mucus if possible. There is a medication called Metronidazole which helps immensely with colitis; also there are prescription diets, but the most important step is to get to your veterinarian to determine the cause and the best course of treatment. Good luck with this!|`|Q3C6hrgjaa	this happened to my dog once and he had a really serious case of worms. take a stool sample to the vet as soon as you can.  if you get really worried, there are 24/7 emergency clinics, but it can get pricey.|`|NKNJm5uSaa	Go to the vet NOW.  Do not wait.|`|6Yf6Jh7Faa	being a stool sample with you to the vet and have your dog checked out.  that would be the safest thing to do.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	This can be very serious.  You need to get your dog to a vet.  Bring a stool sample with you.  Anytime there is blood in the stool a alarm should go off in your head.  The dog needs a vet!|`|b3d1ea6b376eb1836aad3ca778084cccaa	HURRY!!!  Please take your dog to the vet NOW!|`|fFc7wC4oaa	if your @ss was bleeding, you'd have been to the doctor by now.    Give your dog that same little bit of respect.

Em alguns pases costeiros existem pescadores que pescam alguns peixes grandes por afogamento, j que eles n?o possuem embarca??es ou ferramentas adequadas para tir-los vivos do mar. Eles colocam redes de pesca bem firmes e depois de 01 dia eles v?o buscar o peixe j morto ou muito debilitado. Acontece que quando eles se enroscam na rede, fazem um grande esfor?o para sair e acabam ficando mais presos ainda, por isso cansam. S que para "respirarem" eles precisam se movimentar, pois s com a for?a da correnteza n?o  possvel a produ??o de oxignio pelas guelras, ent?o eles morrem.

c30c0e756183d2d16ec18e926de785e6aa	Primeiro castre sua gata. N?o  todo mundo que quer e gosta de criar gatos. S?o mais inocentes nascendo correndo riscos pelas ruas. Alm disso voc estar evitando que sua gata tenha vrias doen?as.    Mas j que v?o nascer..    Arrume um cantinho pra ela, uma caixa. num local muito tranquilo, onde n?o passe gente nem fa?a muito barulho. E deixe ela l, n?o interfira em NADA. Ela sabe o que faz. Pode acontecer at de ela rejeitar um filhote se voc mexer logo neles. E isso seria um problem?o pra voc.    Deixe os folhotes mamarem por no MNIMO 2 meses. Antes disso n?o se deve tir-los da m?e, at o leite pode "empedrar" a mais um problema pra voc. Ela sentir muita dor se isso acontecer.    Cuidados com os filhotes:    H no mercado uma ra??o, BABY CAT 34, da Royal Canin.  de excelente qualidade, e prpria para filhotes a partir de um ms de vida (mas no seu caso n?o  necessrio pois est?o com a m?e). Depois dos trs meses existem outras variedades como a Pro Plan, Cat Premium, entre outras. Todas as ra??es da Premium e Super Premium s?o de tima qualidade.     de fundamental importancia voc d a eles uma ra??o de boa qualidade, pois os gatos s?o sensveis a problemas urinrios, e uma ra??o de boa qualidade ir evitar algumas complica??es. Alm do que deixar o plo bonito e sem queda, assim como evitar o v?mito de plos, muito comum em gatos. E acredite! Ra??es de m qualidade at causam problemas renais    Como esse tipo de ra??o  completa em rela??o a quantidade de nutrientes necessria para os gatos, automaticamente eles se sentir?o satisfeito com pouca quantidade . O que n?o acontece com as ra??es ruins (baratas), como s?o de m qualidade os gatos sentem a necessidade de comer mais. Assim, pode acontecer de voc gastar quase o mesmo comprando ra??es baratas, pois eles ir?o comer muito mais do que se fosse uma boa ra??o. As ra??es mais caras rendem bastante, por isso vale a pena comprar.    Quando fizer um ms, d remdio de verme. O procedimento  o mesmo que nos c?es. Um ml para cada quilo a cada 15 dias at os 3 meses e a partir da a cada um ms at os seis meses, depois s a cada 3 meses.     .|`|d6c690bf6edfe51f2a5ee5faab63fd5eaa	arrume um lugar bem quentinho p/ela|`|55a0fb8b49cc0b8d6fe07bc058d7462faa	Se vc for gatinha com ela... fa?a companhia, pois, elas gostam de ter algum parente por perto!!!!|`|e0f2259953585c3be996c598977974c8aa	Fica olhando ela parir.|`|e73ff27c781ae5205f6e4089b19786b0aa	Deixe-a num lugar calmo. Arrume uma caixinha de papel?o, forre com jornais e paninhos e mostre para ela. Coloque a caixa num lugar de pouco fluxo de pessoas e calmo. Se ela quizer ficar em outro c?modo da casa, coloque a caixinha l.  Na hora do parto n?o pegue no colo, ela vai ficar andando de um lado para o outro e miando. N?o cercie os movimentos dela, deixe-a  vontade.  Feche todas as gavetas e guarda-roupas(elas adoram dar crias messes locais).  Quando o parto come?ar, observe a vagina dela, vai come?ar a sair uma "bolsinha", se o parto n?o ocorrer dentro de meia hora depois dissso ligue para um veterinrio pq o filhote pode morrer por falta de oxigena??o.  qdo os filhotes sarem evite tocar neles, ela vai lamb-los e retirar a placenta. Se ela n?o lamber o filhote, lave bem as m?os com lcool ( no mnimo 70) rompa o envoltrio, ponha o filhote de ponta cabe?a e fa?a uma massagem no sentido trax pesco?o ( deixe-o de cabe?a para baixo por uns dois minutos fazendo essa massagem para tirar o lquido das narinas), seque-o com um paninho limpo e ponha para mamar.  A maioria das gatas n?o d?o trabalho na hora do parto. O intervalo entre cada filhote pode ser de at 2 horas e meia, se passar disso chame o veterinrio pq ela pode estar com reten??o.  NUNCA ponha a m?o dentro da boca dos filhotes!!! Eles ainda n?o tem imunidade e a m?o por mais limpa q esteja sempre tem microorganismos q pode contaminar o trato digestrio deles  feliz 2007 pra vc , pra sua gata e pros bebes!!|`|4ee41b938c09af3e6a2e446fe72f3524aa	um parto|`|d92234a45c711d2459884038576270e5aa	amiga, que bonitinho ...  arruma um caixa vazia, coloca jornais ou um pano lindo, cubra o cachote para ficar quentinho e depois coloca o seu gatinho ai...  fica ai tando atencao ao teu gatinho quando ela tiver dor, esfrega a amo devagar na costas, na cabeca, depois, deixa ela avontade e fika sempre vendo se ela ta nem com o parto, pq se ela nao tiver bem, leva imediatamente a um veterinario.  amiga boa sorte com os seus gatinhos, mas por favor nao abandone eles quando eles crescer e nao oferece eles por pessoas que nao tem posibilidades  entendeu? eles vai sofrer entende?

kEskjPadaa	Na clnica veterinria, o diagnstico de intoxica??o por contacto pela processionria  muitas vezes dificultado pela escassa informa??o de histria clnica sobre o animal em causa. Frequentemente o c?o e o gato saem de casa para o seu passeio sem que os seus donos se apercebam dos caminhos por onde andam ou o que cheiram, abocanham ou comem. Quando regressam, despertam a aten??o pelo seu focinho inchado (edemaciado) lngua grossa (macroglossia) por vezes azulada (ciantica), babar intenso (hipersilia e sialorreia), comich?o (prurido), vmito e dor intensa quando o dono tenta  for?a abrir-lhes a boca na ideia de encontrar um corpo estranho (pau, lasca de madeira, etc.).

Los mios estan a veces en la ventana y cuando ven pasar a alguien cerca se ponen como locos y cuando los sacas a la calle se olvidan y se vuelven mas cari?osos y mimosos con la gente, pero ese simbolismo de atarles es como decirles. tienes que cuidar de nuestra casa.|`|CNSSbd2aaa	si mantienes atado al animalito el se pondra mas agresivo con tanto ruido  hay que mimarlo sinceramente haciendole ver que tan importante es para ti y tu familia pues ellos son ni?os y asi lo entienden solo les falta hablar suerte triunfador|`|011025cc23dbdb0248758e7c4ae607f1aa	El problema no es que vea o no a la gente, ac el problema es que el perro est atado, eso es lo que hace que el perro est agresivo, para ellos el estar atado es sinnimo de sometimiento, el perro debe ser sociabilizado pero suelto, no s que le habr pasado a tu perro, pero seguramente durante el perodo que estuvo perdido (creo haber entendido que estuvo perdido un tiempo) seguramente lo han maltratado y mucho, o ha tenido que estar solo mucho tiempo y eso resinti su carcter, la mejor forma de hacer que el perro vuelva de a poco a la normalidad es darle una contencin y no lo estn haciendo si lo mantienen atado, debe sentir que es parte de la familia nuevamente, dejenlo suelto pero en lugar seguro donde no pueda atacar, gru?ir o ladrar a las personas que pasan cerca, tiene que acostumbrarse que la presencia humana no siempre es sinnimo de maltrato. Si al cabo de un tiempito esto no te resulta debers consultar con un adiestrador o con un experto en comportamiento canino, si no lo hay donde vives, busca en internet alguno que te ayude va mail, hay muchas pginas de adiestramiento o comportamiento canino que brindan este tipo de ayuda.

They do not molt for too long because in the wild they are very open to attack by other animals. They are completely vulnerable during the molting process. Usually their shell will harden in about 2-3 days afterwards. in the wild the spider pretty much hides for about 3 days and hopes nothing comes by that finds it appetizing.

nmNp1gvyaa	I had 2 chihuahuas and I litter box trained them. I started with a tiny litter box in a fairly large dog cage (when I was gone to work and at night)- they usually wont go where they sleep so that forced them over to the other side of the crate - after that seemed to go well I let them have the laundry room  with the litter box and once they got used to that I just put the litter box in a central location in the house - made sure they new where it was and then they could go whenever they wanted and I didnt have to worry about the carpet.   As far as doing something after the fact - you really cant  punish them cause they dont know what they did. If you see her doing it just firmly say no squirt her with the bottle (on the butt or back not in the face) and put her outside that is about all you can do until she understands. It is very time consuming and takes patience to potty train but they are so worth it - hang in there!!|`|p8KPAHSdaa	The best way to housebreak your two year old is to use a crate as a tool for the training. Never, never hit your dog...that is a no, no.      OK, the training is a test to see how well *you* can observe behavior, chart times and how consistant you can be. The dog will follow your lead.    Believe it or not dogs go to the bathroom on a schedule, there is a pattern. Their bodies automatically eliminate whenever the gastrocolic reflex is triggered. Stretching of the stomach when eating triggers the reflex. As dogs get older they are able to overide the reflex and control when they will go to the bathroom. Your dog is old enough to have the abillity to wait til she get's outside.  She apparently has not yet been house trained.  So now that is your job.    Somewhere between 5 mins-1 hr after eating is when pups will go to the bathroom. About 5-10 mins BEFORE you know she probably has to go - start with 15 min- 30 minutes after eating, take the pup outside. When your dog eliminates give her praise by saying "good potty!!!" Don't worry if the neighbors think that sounds stupid. You must always give generous praise when she does good.     Each dog's body is different so it may take you a few observations and trial and errors to get more precise. Make a chart and enter time fed/time of elimination for her pees & poops. Soon you will know your dog's bathroom schedules.    Your pup will sniff and circle about 3 seconds before "the act." If you see her sniff and circle outside, give the command to "go potty" and give immediate praise when she does. Eventually saying "go potty" will be the command that makes the pup go when she's outdoors.    You should have a special spot where you take her to do her business every time. Take your pup out every two hours throughout the day. If she doesn't go, put her back in crate and try again in 20 minutes (don't be mad. Don't scold scold her. Dogs live in the moment and she will think you are mad at her for the thing she did that very second not the poop she did 1 minute ago -- don't be mad at yourself either, it's just a schedule thing--you will learn). Eventually you'll find out what "the" schedule is. It might be your pup can hold for 3-4 hours.     Take the pup out first thing in the a.m. at the same time, and just before bedtime at the same time each eve.    In the house if you have some mistakes, use vinegar water in a spray bottle to disinfect and remove the urine amonia smell.    If your pup makes a mistake, it's *your* fault, you haven't charted the automatic trigger times--so don't show your temper, don't rub her nose in it. Remember dogs live in the moment, not what happened a minute ago. If you tell her she's a bad dog, she'll think what she's doing at that very, exact moment is a bad thing not the wet carpet thing that happened minutes ago.    If you are not focused and paying attention to her (stuff like playing, holding her on your lap and *always* being observant of the sniff and circle routine), she should be in her crate.  I'd say in the evening before 7pm is the last time to drink water for the night.    Best wishes for a fun life with your new pup.    This is the method I use to train my pups.|`|AmJm9vnlaa	please dont say that! my little chihuahua is one and she still has accidents.dont slap her just spray her with a spray bottle.|`|pLiTSnG7aa	You can trow her in a bag going out|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	I agree it is best not to use wee pads. Just take her out every hour or so and praise her when she does right. If you say wee wee or what ever when she goes, she will learn to  do it when you say - it does work. Never scold her for going indoors - theres no point, she'll just get frightened and pee in secret somewhere!. Small dogs often take a bit longer than larger breeds to toilet train properly anyway. was she from kennels? If so, of course she won't be housetrained!|`|LhJc7Doqaa	If you don't want to crate her you need to at least restrict where she is. Potty pads are not a bad thing & they sure save the floor! I don't ever hit my dogs, since mine had previously been abused. I don't need them to be afraid of my hands. Be sure you take out when she awakens, after she eats & when she starts sniffin alot. Hope some of these ideas help.|`|3PDO7qXgaa	I have a Chihuahua myself and it took a while to potty train her but we finally did it.      If you catch her in the act, rub her nose in it and spank her in the but.  Then put her outside for a while.    If you don't catch her in the act don't punish her.  She won't know what is wrong if you do.    Every morning take her outside to potty.  Before you go to bed go outside to potty.  Wait until she does then praise her for doing so.    That's what I did, and I have been free from stains ever since!!|`|gOsjK6eEaa	DO NOT, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES   spank or hit your dog, or rub her nose in dirty poop or urine!    That is dog abuse!  Dog does not think like humans, they don't connect an accident in house with punishment, they only know that you are unpredictable and cruel.    Crate train your dog... dogs do not go potty where they sleep.  If she does, it's an accident and you probably left her too long.  Crates are a quiet place where dog can be safe and relax.  She will get used to it, the crate with a blanket and a toy appeals to them because of instinct to have a den.    To potty train, take her out first thing in morning, last thing at nite, and every 4 to 6 hrs in between.  Also after each meal! She might be ok for 6 to 8 hrs in crate, as she is two yrs. old now.  Sounds like she just was not housebroken before!  You must be patient and reward her with a lot of praise when she goes.  Stay outside with dog and wait, say 'go potty!' in a fun voice. Praise her a lot when she does; she will learn what you want.  it's not hard to train your dog, but it takes persistence, patience, and time.  i use the methods above and all my dogs learn to 'go potty' and 'go poopy' on command.  if you do the work, you will be hapy with the result.        Suggest (small book)      "What all Good Dogs Should Know" by Volhard    Very short and simple book, but if you do everything it says, your dog will behave much much better.    Good luck.

If they are true minnows, they will like things such as mosquito larvae or daphnia (available frozen at better pet stores).  If they are just baby fish of some sort then this will probably make them happy as well, but baby fish may need some vegetable matter as well.

Take your dog to the vet (or a new vet) and ask them to remove it and biopsy it.  They will analyze it and tell you if it's cancerous.  But it is not good that it has grown so much and has puss.  If your vet won't take it off and check it, find another vet.
wQrrJnaSaa	The first thing I would ask yourself is: Am I you giving the dog enough excercise? Retrievers are dogs with lots of energy! and they need to use that energy or they get bored, and when dogs get bored they can be destructive, and then your favourite hairbrush is no more!! :( so i would suggest taking him for a walk/run for at least an hour and a half a day. If your not that energetic yourself, take him to an off lead park and bring a ball and let him run till he drops.  Also, a dog thats 2 1/2 is still a puppy, and puppy like to chew. The best thing you can do is to keep your favourite things out of reach (close doors, put things you like (esp shoes) in high places etc), and in the mean time give him toys of his own, and help him differentiate between his toys and yours.  But in the end, excercise is the answer, i tired dog is a subdued dog!! :)   good luck!|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yup, don't keep stuff within his reach, and correct him when he goes for things that are off limits. Don't hit him or anything, but tell him NO firmly, in a deep voice.  Pick up toys, brushes, and especially laundry, an obstruction is a serious thing. You don't him getting something stuck..     Get him far more exercise, and crate train the guy.|`|0xJZJggVaa	Pretty typical behavior for a Golden. He's hoping you'll chase him. Best bet is to puppy proof your home. Crate train him when you can't supervise.|`|abc2f151c4c77be815487837b07b1c5aaa	get a crate and start crate training him!! If you cannot watch him then he needs to go in his crate until he learns that he cannot chew up everything! Also you may want to tie him to a leash and to you and make sure he does not get bored!!!|`|FnSskhcQaa	That sounds just like my dog, who was raised inside.  Except my dog doesn't drool.    I would suggest keeping his brain active by setting up some puzzles for him.  A Buster Cube is great.  It's a toy that you fill with the dog's regular food (or a treat) and as he rolls it around, the food falls out at random.    My dog also loves to pull things out of boxes and such.  When I move in a few weeks, I'm going to make him a box that has different sized holes to keep his toys in.  I know he'll spend hours just pulling the toys out.  You might be able to come up with something similar using some sort of container that is not similar to your trash cans, so he doesn't get any extra ideas there.    Of course basic training will help too.  And a lot of play time with his people.      Goldens are such intelligent dogs that they get bored easily and it often comes out in this type of behavior.    Good luck and if you find a foolproof method of training this out of him, let me know please :o)|`|RxMJtU0Aaa	Retrievers are considered "mouthy" dogs due to the fact that they have been bred to retrieve things. This is his instinct and it is totally normal. The way to break him is to provide him with his own toys that are appropriate for him to chew on, and when he has something that he shouldn't, gently correct him and immediately replace it with one of his own toys with praise. Also give him LOTS of exercise.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Give him toys.  My female carries all her toys to one spot and puts them in a pile.  Then she picks them up one by one and carries them to her second spot and drops them into a pile.  She goes back and forth until she gets bored then falls asleep.|`|jnvwnchxaa	he is just trying to get used to the inside envirnment i would not worry, just dont let him get small peices of things|`|G2eh62yHaa	Start by keeping him in a small room clear of everything except his toys and bowls.  A laundry room may work if you can take out the baskets and clothes.  Do not let him roam the house unless you can keep a close eye on him.  When he picks something up, tell him "leave it" and give him a treat so he'll drop whatever he has.  You may have to dog proof your house, its very similar to child proofing.  Put everything out of his reach.  Put a lid on the toy box and have the kids keep the toys put away when he's around.  Put a hamper in the closet for your dirty laundry.      As for the drool, he'll probably continue to drool.  I don't have any suggestions on how to get rid of it.  Some dogs just drool more than others.|`|AA10817678	its a new place for the dog  he dont no his limits within the house yet  he will in time  just  take  the items hes not allowed to have when u r home with him  when ur away u may want to crate  him so  he wont get into things that he cant have  ,

Todo dia de manh? minha m?e colocava duas caminhs pra ela, uma no solzinho e outra na sombra. Assim ela podia escolher onde ficar descansando. Fora isso, tinha um dengo especial com ela. Era a velhinha da casa, quando as outras mais novas estavam brincando, ela sempre estava no colo, pra evitar que batessem nela. Foi muito bom, aprendemos ainda mais a amar os animais l na minha casa. S reformamos a casa depois que ela morreu, assim ela n?o se batia nos mveis e portas, afinal ela era acostumada a andar sempre pela casa. Viveu bem por 8 anos assim.

Pode ter certeza que se a sua cadela estiver triste n?o tem nada a ver com a vis?o.  Tente pensar em outras coisas, e at mesmo se a preocupa??o n?o  mais sua do que dela.  Normalmente os animais mais velhos desenvolvem  catarata.  E mesmo quando mais novos, eu nunca indico a cirurgia para corre??o, j que a garantia n?o  de 100%.  Eles convivem muito bem sem enxergar, afinal o principal sentido que eles usam  o olfato e n?o a vis?o.  Apenas seja paciente para que haja um perodo de adapta??o, onde ela vai aprender a lhe dar com este novo desafio.  E uma dica, evite mudar as coisinhas dela de lugar, caminha, potinhos...  Boa Sorte!  Bjs

Gatos podem durar at de 15 a 20 anos, e continuam tendo cio, se ? castradas.

Se estiver tudo certo,  cio mesmo. Por seguran?a, pode fazer um ch da erva quebra pedra junto c/erva cidreira, q s?o fceis de achar, e ir colocando aos pouquinhos no pote dagua. Trocar todo dia, e recolocar um pouquinho do ch ( se ela tiver problemas urinrios, isso ajuda muito, e a erva cidreira vai acalmar), durante uma semana todo mes. Se ela tiver fezes secas,  bom dar uma papinha com peito de frango, cenoura e abobora batidos no liquidificador. De qq modo, sempre  bom levar ao vet. pelo menos uma vez, para uma geral.

fe92a230b32f152981c0791beef575d9aa	Los gatos de raza se diferencian en que tienen menos variabilidad gentica, porque por ms que se empe?en los criadores, siempre estn ms emparentados genticamente dos animales muy parecidos que dos animales muy distintos.  Por eso, se suelen dar enfermedades caractersticas de cada raza como por ejemplo, problemas en los lagrimales de los persas y desviacin del tabique nasal, la bizquez de los siameses...   La raza (por ms que "los expertos en razas" quieren afirmar sin ninguna base cientfica) no determina en absoluto el carcter, as que no es una garanta de nada, ms que de que existen ms posibilidades de que el animal tenga una vida ms corta porque son ms dbiles frente a las enfermedades que pueden surgir.    El comportamiento de uno de raza de los que no la tienen depende nicamente de la personalidad del gato, no de quines eran estticamente sus padres.     En todos los casos para que el gato sea un adulto equilibrado, sociable y cari?oso, no debe separarse de la madre antes de los 2 meses (mejor 3) porque la madre les ense?a casi todo y encima, los socializa y les ense?a cosas bsicas como que morder duele y que existen una serie de lmites. Los cachorros destetados antes de tiempo (y hay gente que los quiere coger de das o recin nacidos sin importarles el perjuicio que les causan) tienen grandes peligros para su vida porque no maman leche de la madre y por tanto, no adquieren las defensas necesarias. Y despus, suelen tener ms problemas de comportamiento porque no los educ su mami, sino un humano, que rara vez sabe educarlos.    El problema de las razas es que es una "ciencia" artificial creada por intereses econmicos. Las asociaciones felinas venden los pedigrs. Se crea una parafernalia en torno a las exposiciones y concursos de gatos y se mueve mucho dinero en la compraventa de estos animales. Y la realidad es que nada hace mejor a uno de estos animales frente a otro cualquiera. El pedigr es una cosa completamente absurda, que slo sirve para que te pidan un dineral por darte al gato. Si fuera algo real, se vera en el gato sin necesidad de que te dieran el papel. Pero resulta que si pierdes el papel, es como si ese gato perdiera el pedigr. O sea que no compras una caractersticas del gato, sino un papel que te dice que el gato vale.  Si tienes gato y le quieres, sabes que tu gato vale, digan lo que digan todos los papeles del mundo.     La gente quiere "lo mejor" y por ello coge y se va a comprar lo que le han dicho que es "lo mejor". Se van al criador de turno, se compran su mascota y claro, como tiene que ser  la mejor, tiene que tener su dichoso papelito. ?Quin les ha dicho a esas personas que son lo "bastante buenos" como para tener "lo mejor"? A lo mejor ese gato se merece unos due?os mejores que lo quieran incondicionalmente, sin necesidad de que un papel se lo certifique.       En fin, yo he tenido en casa ms de 30 gatos, todos ellos maravillosos, todos distintos. No eran de raza ninguno de ellos pero conozco gente que s cometi el error de pagar por un compa?ero de vida. Mis ni?os han sido todos los mejores del mundo y a todos los he querido como a los mos propios (mos tengo 4, los dems son recogidos y dados en adopcin para poder recoger ms de la calle). Todos son especiales y adorables y me acuerdo mucho de cada uno de ellos.|`|poT1Hj6Oaa	yo prefiero de raza gato :) , tenia un siames y era muy delicado , se enfermo y murio, aparte como que llama mucho la atencion y siempre hay alguien que te lo quiere  robar, cosa que no pasa conlos comunes,que aparte por la experiencia , son mas sanos . Que te destrocen la casa mm juegan cuando son cachorros , y si los castras , no creo que tengas problema, y lo de bobines no creo todos los gatos son super inteligentes .|`|fGG1v0YPaa	lo que pasa con los bichitos de raza,ya sean perros o gatos,es que son muchsimo ms delicados de salud que los mestizos.aparte a los mestizos ya de por s se les hace difcil encontrar casa,as que te recomiendo adoptar un gatito sin raza alguna.un beso!!!!!|`|bseYeYhLaa	hola espero responder y resolver tus dudas y de antemano un disculpa al que no este de a cuerdo con lo siguiente:  mira los gatos a si como todos los demas animales que se han domesticado, para beneficio del humano, todos son de temperamento variable y dependera de como los eduques su comportamiento. es decir que si lo maltratas y no lo atiendes se volvera un rebelde, pero si le das cuidado atencion juguetes adecuada aliemntacin  visitas al medico cunado menos 4 veces al a?o siempre sera una excelente mascota.  ahora bien nunca he sabido ni a he atendido un gato que haya destrozado literalmenmte la casa a menos que sea un felino salvaje leon, tigre, leopardo etc. pero los gatos normales a los que les llamamos domesticos no destruyen la casa si los educas bien.  ahora lo de las raza de los animales especialmente los perros y los gatos se crearon por  gente que se queria sentir superior a los demas y se formo la federacion de perros y gatos, pero en realidad son seres iguales a los demas solo que estan dentro de un club y por eso la gente les pone un sobre valor economico y ademas los miman demasiado.   yo en lo personal no creo que valga la pena tener gatos o perros con pedrigree o de raza pura, se comportan igual que los demas que no estan registrados o que no tiene pedigree.  ademas en el caso de los gatos de raza pura se la pasan encerrados ya que como costaron mucho no los dejan salir ni al patio, ni conocer mas gatos (que cruel no) los sobre protegen mucho, en cambioo los demas gatos son callejeros (que no deberia ser) pero cuando menos tienes amigos, otros gatos o perros y pueden salir al patio o al jardi siempre y cuando esten esterilizados y esten con supervicion para que no se escapen o tengas peleas con gatos del vecindario.  cualquier masota que elijas siempre sera la mejor si la cuidas y le das buena alimentacin y la llevas con el veterinario cuando menos cada 2 meses y le das excelente vida.  suerte con tu gato sat. medico vet.  tengo 3 gatos esterilizados desdeluego uno de 20 a?os y  de 8 a?os y uno de 2 a?os.todas hembras.  no son de raza con meztizo que son la cruza de una raza pura con una de no reconocimiento.oficil.|`|PrxDP77haa	Todos los gatos no son iguales en cuanto a carcter, pero d lo mismo si es de raza o no.

Los gatos son inteligentes y aprenden rpido, adems que con amor todo se puede lograr.|`|NfiDk0JKaa	Los que te han dicho eso tienen la mente algo cerrada y tu tambien un poco al creer que los de raza son bobitos... Cada gatito tiene una personalidad diferente... Yo soy due?a de tres gatitos criollitos y uno de raza y te dire que el de raza es el mas travieso junto con una de las criollitas, una de las criollitas es muy tranquila es mas ni cuenta te das que existe y el tercer gatito aun esta muy bebe y bueno tiene personalidad de bebe...|`|ifzlR4tAaa	Obvio que los de raza son mejores.|`|99wxBW0Naa	Sinceramente prefiero los mestizos: Son unicos, muy cari?osos, tienen menos problemas de salud, son mas longevos, y puedes adoptarlos de una protectora.  Miles de gatos son sacrificados cada a?o, otros miles mueren atropellados, cientos de ellos nacen destinados  a tener una vida corta y miserable. Y mientras tanto se siguen criando indiscriminadamente animales de raza. Mi gato es mestizo, lo encontre con dos semanas de vida muriendose de parvovirosis, pero aqui esta, vivito y coleando, y es el gato mas bueno y esplendido que ha pisado la tierra.

En relacin a los gatos de raza, debes ser muy inteligente al elegirlo, no todos son dormilones, por ejemplo el gato siames es muy caminador, curioso y activo (otro tipo de terremoto)... Megusta muchisimo el British Short Hair, es una belleza de gato y adems he investigado su caracter y es activo pero sin ser terremoto.. ahora si eliges un persa sabes que vas a tener una pota de pelo durmiendo en casa.. Todo depende de tu personalidad y de cuanto ests motivado a educarle.    Otra cosa que debes tener muy en cuenta que aunque sean o no de raza, debes ser tu quien segn tu personalidad y afinidad elija el gato.

Dos de mis gatas viven casi que fuera de la casa, pues les gusta mucho cazar.  La tercera gata, es muy casera y tiene muy buen temperamento, hasta ha adoptado al siames y juegan por todo lado dentro de la casa.  Camo los dos pasan ms dentro que fuera, lo que hicimos fue que les mandamos a sacar las u?as, as no hacen detrozos dentro de la casa y para compensar su imposibilidad de cazar les damos un trocito de carne molida diaria.  Lo que hace la diferencia, quizs, es que si optas por comprar un gato de raza, puedes tener la opcin de traerlo bien peque?o a casa y socializarlo ms fcilmente, pues los mestizos generalmente son abandonados cuando ya estn algo grandes y llegan muy desconfiados a la casa de uno.  Pero al final, un gato es un gato.|`|jiZ6hTieaa	yo he tenido gatos comunes, de cualquier pelo. y lo que s..  estuvieron hasta que los corri el perro...competencia animal por el territorio. oh. si tens perro pensalo.  ?o un tuyty? cuando no est SErgi se arma la rosca...|`|1LotJfUMaa	Mi gato Nocturno es mestizo, es un caballero en todo sentido.

P1mi6pUYaa	Crate train her.  It's the best way.  Get a crate that's small for her size, and put her in it when you are not home or you can't watch her like a hawk.  When you come home, take her outside immediately and when she goes potty, praise her and give her treats.  Take her out often when you aren't crating her, and give treats and pets to her for going potty outside, every time.  She'll learn soon....|`|hQSKBHbhaa	I recently adopted a 1-1/2 yr old Chihuahua and in less than a week, I got him trained to go on newspapers or out on my balcony (I live in a condo).  The first few days I had him, I watched him like a hawk and clapped my hands and scolded him with a "NO!  Bad dog!" each time he squatted on my carpet.  Then I proceeded to carry him to the balcony.  Each time he went potty out on the balcony or outdoors on our walks, I praised him with, "Good dog!" and gave him a doggy treat.     During the times that I couldn't supervise him, I kept him gated for several hours in a small space in my breakfast nook with his bed and feeding bowls in one corner and newspapers spread out in another corner.  A dog will instinctively avoid soiling his sleeping area, so his only option was to go potty on the newspapers.  After doing that for a few days with success, I increased his living space to the entire breakfast nook and kitchen.  He continued to go potty on the newspapers.  So I gradually gave him access to the living room and eventually the whole house, but I made sure that he had access to the balcony, and laid down newspapers on the balcony for good measure.  I continued to lay down newspapers in the breakfast nook, but now he'll only go potty on the newspapers out on the balcony.|`|rRtDfcfxaa	the crate training method..best one ive heard of.|`|Tz6qRF8Paa	You can teach her that the house is not a peeing spot.I would recommend you get Pee Pads and take them outside.Also get a doggy door so they know where to go and how to get outside fast.Trust me,if she pees/does her buisness in the house,tell her NO and send her outside and bend her/his butt down.and when she starts peeing i suggest you take her on the pee pads BEFORE she stops.You can put the pads in the house and train her like that.But everytime the house stinks you will need Febreeze and remix it.I suggest you discipline her/him if he/she starts peeing in the house.

P1mi6pUYaa	Your puppy must be very smart.  He's already figured most of this stuff out at 5 mo. old!  It looks like he's got the idea to go outside, but he doesn't know how to alert you that he needs out or he doesn't understand that the rest of the house is just like your room- a no-pooping zone.  My dog, before he started letting me know he wants out, used to go to a door, any door, and sit there.  That's how I knew he wanted out.  He didn't know the difference between any door and the front door.  You've just got to teach your dog to alert you when he needs out.  Teach him to speak, and make him do it every time you take him out, right before you open the door.  Give him a treat for doing it.  Then give him treats for going potty outside.    To teach him to speak:  try to get him to bark, and then after he does it, say "speak" and give him a treat.  Keep doing that until you can say "speak" and he'll bark on his own.  He sounds smart so he'll get it fast.  Also, you could put Christmas bells on your front door and show him how to ring them.  My dog won't bark, so the bells work better.|`|1088adaabcd4b27f00de221595f6f2a4aa	In my experience, crate training is by far the best option for housetraining a puppy or young dog. There's lots of information about it on the Internet, should you need it.     Given what you've detailed, one thing I would do is be sure to take him outside before you settle in downstairs. Be sure to give him LOTS of praise when he does relieve himself outside. And I mean, have a PARTY.     Do the same before you leave for the day. In other words, you want him to learn that he needs to take advantage of these opportunities when he has them. You want going on schedule to become a habit for him as much as possible.     Also, it's only fair that when someone else comes home,  they take your dog outside. (Do you have a secure fenced yard so that they can simply let him out?) Their coming home is exciting, and it may be hard for him to wait just because you're not there.     In addition to that you may want to train your dog to ring a bell (which you hang on or near the door) when he wants/needs to go outside. It's relatively easy to teach. You gently push the bell with the dog's nose, then immediately open the door and tell him how wonderful he is. (Again, PARTY!) The one downside is, he will learn to ring it when he wants to go out--not just when he needs to go out. In my experience this is far outweighed by the benefits of a dog who can get your attention with a bell when he goes to the door to go out.     Good luck!

This helps prevent lice from being on you dogs body. If your dog does get lice then you have to buy special powders and shampoos to get rid of the lice. Dogs dont really get flys..... they can get ticks though.|`|AA10099648	All dogs are equal in getting fleas, ticks & whatever.     Dogs do not usually get lice or flies. They get fleas & ticks. You need to buy the products from your vet. The items from the vet will prevent heartworms & all other kinds of worms. The other product he will sell you will keep all fleas & ticks off your dog.     Don't buy cheap stuff that you don't know what it is. Your vet is the best because he knows your dogs. It is important to know their exact weight also.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Frontline is a really good product.  I use it and have never had flea, tick or any parasite problems with my dogs.  If your dog gets fleas, putting Frontline on him will kill them.  Same thing for ticks, but you should also pull the ticks out with tweezers, just to get them out ASAP.  With lice, that's really uncommon in dogs, but you have to get a lice killing shampoo from your vet and bathe him with it once a week for a couple of weeks, and then get rid of all his bedding, etc.|`|Vso7ABU2aa	I use revolution for my chihuahua.

I tried Advantage's (I think was the name) 2 in 1 flea/worm treatment but it wasn't as affective as Frontline for my beagle.  Their flea/tick topical application is really the best I've ever used.  I've never personally used Hartz or any of the other brands you would buy at say Wal-Mart or the grocery store & I've been told by several people with several dogs that they just don't work as well. They use Frontline too. ...there is a reason why we all use Frontline...try it.|`|U3kCGjE2aa	You can find information on getting rid of fleas at http://pests.in/fleas.html

P1mi6pUYaa	It depends on the dog, and how consistent you are about training him.  My beagle-dachshund mix was easy-medium to housetrain.  I crate trained him and was very consistent and he learned within two weeks.  It was longer than that before we considered him "reliable".  But he was a puppy, and puppies can't hold it as long.|`|5bd2296df0f2a4c817a834b069c421f2aa	Ours have been easy to housebreak but they chew and scratch up everything!|`|LsewvSdIaa	Normally hard.

ZjFzetXAaa	Your dog needs to learn that she is not the alpha, YOU are. I suggest that you walk your dog for starters. Sometimes, aggression and dominance are caused by a simple lack of exercise and the dog gets excess energy that she doesn't know what to do with. Other times, it is just because the dog doesn't know any better. When I say walking her, I do not mean let her walk in front of you and go sniff everything that she wants. I mean YOU need to walk your dog, not the other way around. Make her stay right at your side and DON'T let her go in front, behind, or away from you.     If the walk doesn't fix the problem, then you really need to prove yourself to this dog. She sees you as submissive and doesn't take you seriously, otherwise she wouldn't be biting or mounting at all. As soon as you see her act like she might start these behaviors, you need to correct her. Don't wait until after they have already taken place because then it is too late. Make sure you stop her before she even gets that far. Then she will know that you mean businiess and are in fact her alpha.    If you need to, keep a choke chain or leash on her at all times. When she is about to do something that you don't want her to do, like bite or mount, grab the leash or chain and give it a sharp jerk. You need to teach her a simple command that means what she is doing is wrong. Do not yell at her or become frustrated because she will not understand. You need to be calm and assertive and give her a simple word or sound like "no", or snap your fingers, or make a shhh sound. When she does something bad, say your command or make your noise while giving her a sharp and quick jerk at the same time. The goal is not to hurt her, but to simply tell her that you mean business. If you don't want to use a rope or a choke chain, then use your hand. Hold your hand like you are about to grip a doorknob, with your fingers slightly curled. Poke her in the neck with your fingers, rather hard. Your fingers will feel like teeth to her, and she will know to back off. Once again, this will not hurt her at all.    This is going to take a lot of work and you cannot slack off. You must always be watching her so that you can correct her immediately. It's going to take some time before she will understand that she isn't the boss anymore. Eventually, she will learn that your command or sound is not a good thing and when she hears it, she will stop and you won't have to jerk or poke her. I wish you and your dogs the best of luck!=)|`|991bbdad7f09acda86bae9512b776164aa	Read the Dog Whisper.   He talks about this stuff and it sounds like your dog is being dominant.   The humans have to be the dominant ones..the leaders of the pack.   Read the Dog Whisper or watch his TV show.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It might be good for you to hire a dog behaviorist so you can get her in check.  She needs to understand that she is not the leader of the pack, you are.  While she has asserted that she's tougher than your other lab, she has to learn that she's not always the top dog.

There is a website that tells you how to empty them, but I think you should take the dog to the vet and have this done if you are not familiar with the procedure.  This is just my guess, it could be other things.    http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_ana...|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Dogs do this when their anal glands are full.  You can especially tell it's the anal glands when the dog licks his butt a lot, drags his butt across the ground, or there seems to be a gross smell coming from the dog's behind.  You can fix this easily by taking him to a groomer or the vet and paying them to express his anal glands.  It is a very nasty job, but it only costs a little bit, about $10.  When the anal glands get full, it's really uncomfortable for the dog and that is why he's trying to relieve himself.|`|VS9edvkmaa	Anal glands are probably infected. Take him to the vet, it should only run $10-30. It is worth the money, trust me here. That way even if there is another probelm the vet will be able to figure it out for you and you can stop worrying. Its better to take him in for regualr checkups that to spend a lot of money on an eaasily fixed problem

They may be able to help. I have heard cases where they have adopted out pets across the country, and rescue to rescue they get the pet where it needs to be. (Each rescue drives an hour or so, and then the get the pet to the next stop). I hope she finds a way, sounds like the kids need him.    You might also contact some semi-drivers in your area. If they are pet friendly, they may be willing to make some extra money, and take him along on their trip.

P1mi6pUYaa	Yes, I believe both people and other dogs can get tapeworms.  After you get both dogs cleared up, put them on a heartworm/parasite pill once a month.  Try Sentinel.  Go to the doctor about yourself, too, to make sure you are OK.|`|0xJZJggVaa	Yes, other dogs and people can get tapeworms. Hopefully your vet wormed him properly. I wouldn't be paranoid if the vet did it, the pup is worm free. You should all be fine, just wash your hands. Keep your yard poop free. Worms can get into the soil and infect that forever.|`|AA11947327	Tapeworms infect a dog through fleas.  Adult tape will shed the last segment and it will come out with the stool.  Fleas come along and eat the eggs that are in that shed segment.  They then bite a dog and give them tape.  The only way that a dog can give it to another dog is if they are playing and one swallows the segment.  You cannot get tapeworm.
4acLiQG9aa	There are several good hatcheries that sell day old baby goslings. If you are interested in an older goose than you should check at the local feed store to see if anyone is selling any. Also if you can find a copy of the Poultry Press their are several small breeders and hatcheries that advertise baby geese.     Here are some hatchery websites.    http://www.mcmurrayhatchery.com/    http://www.strombergschickens.com/index....    http://metzerfarms.com/    Good Luck.|`|ffef4af067e0ebae240ee607163ecd44aa	go to a farmers market. or flea market. or if you have a local paper put in an ad.|`|zrLIrl1Qaa	If you're near a country area, there's probably shops specialised in farming equipment.

OgVmHwW6aa	A rescue or a reputable breeder.  Avoid pet shops like the plague.  Also be very, very wary of newspaper and web ads.  There are people who advertise there who know little to nothing about their breed, and aren't willing to help you along the way.    How will you kn ow a reputable breeder?  First off, they will know what their breed's standard is.  You can find the standards for all AKC recognized breeds at www.akc.org.  They will know what genetic problems are possible in the breed, and will test their dog's genes to try to avoid or eliminate these problems.  They aill ask you a ton of questions, and be very concerned abut what kind of home you will give their pup.  They will insist on you spaying/neutering any pups that aren't meant to be shown or bred.  They will take back one of their pups at any time for any reason.  They will have a contract that tells you this.  They will show their dogs, or work them in the job the dog is bred to do.  If the person trying to sell you a dog doesn't do any of these things, DON'T buy the dog.  Usually a national breed club will have contacts for both reputable breeders and rescues.  Look them up online and ask for advice.  This will help you to find the perfect new pet and avoid some of the heartbreak of getting a poorly bred, sickly pup.  Good luck!!!    Aside to Erkwist:  People who have a USDA license are usually profit only motivated mass breeders.  Most reputable breeders only have a local kennel license or don't have enough dogs to require a license.  :-)|`|KNbZEPFVaa	what breed do you want??  I suggest buying a dog magazine or checking out local dog shows.  You can find people near you and possibly meet with them and their dogs|`|AA11020463	The best thing to do is to decide what breed you are looking for... then research the breed and talk to breeders.  I do not suggest you get any puppy from a pet store as more dogs have health problems from pet stores than from breeders.  Reputable breeders normally give some sort of health guarantee and if you should decide you no longer want the dog, they tend to have a home again policy which means they will take the dog back and find it a suitable home to go to.  Reputable breeders have strict guidelines as to how they raise the puppies, and can give you pedigree backgrounds and will have at least one parent on site so you have some idea of how the puppy will look when it's older and you can judge the temperment more easily.  What kind of dog are you looking for and maybe I can help you find a good breeder....|`|RTaRh8G3aa	from a licensed breeder|`|xt4c76bsaa	i would definatley go to a well known and noted breeder.  It is not safe to go out on a whim and buy a dog from a petstore.  it is very risky because FULL breed dogs can have serious genitic issues.  It may cost more but in the end you will save alot of $ by avoiding extensive vet work.  Hope you enjoy your puppy!!!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Believe it or not, you can get tons of purebred puppies on petfinder.com.  They are rescued, so they usually come with all their shots and were saved from being put down.  My sister got a purebred chocolate Doberman that way.  Just have a look- you'll be surprised at how many cute puppies are there.|`|FRKijzyiaa	Adopt from a rescue centre! A young adult or older dog. You find purebred and mixed breed at a rescue shelter. Rescue dogs are alot cheaper than breeders and pet store dogs and also look at the shelter, not just what is available online, because there is only a small section of dogs available online! many more available in the shelter. It is NONSENSE that a rescue shelter is expensive. we get my two young adult rescue cats $85 australian dollars each, a 2yr old& 18month old! The puppies are dearer to cover the cost of the desexing and worming, yet rescue puppies are still cheaper than pet store and breeders.    Adult rescue dogs will say whether they get along well with other cats, whether they don't get along with cats, they'll say whether they get along with children, whether they get along well with older children|`|KKWYLVbUaa	If you go the breeder route (I'd recommend rescue), check with your local dog training club to see if they've had any experience with this breeder. A woman in my training class got a golden puppy form a breeder in the area that turned out beautiful dogs and had an impressive site.    She found out too late that this breeder is known in the dog training community for not breeding healthy dogs. Her golden is already showing signs of hips problems (he's about a year old) and probably won't live past three because of heart problems.|`|WfiemC12aa	a reputable breeder is the only place you should go for a purebred... either that or a rescue or shelter|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Check the AKC website, you can figure out what kind of dog you are looking for, and you can locate breeders in your area.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	A purebred puppy should always come from a responsible breeder..one who does genetic health testing, researches pedigrees, either shows or has their dogs evaluated to make sure they meet breed standard, etc. Go to the AKC site and find the listing for kennel clubs in your area contact them and they can put you in touch with responsible, ethical breeders.. you can also contact breed rescues they often have puppies and young dogs. do NOT buy from newspapers, websites,pet stores and the like...|`|GpiRaSvPaa	From a breeder.|`|06aa0da875f9cca76c4abaa129511b6caa	why?    mutts tend to be healthier do to less inbreeding    and they are cheap and plentiful|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	I prefer going to the home of a family with pets.  I would never buy from a large scale breeder.  Dogs should be pets not livestock.  Here is a link to all the state's newspapers in the USA.

Tengo la satisfaccin de poder decir que cada animalito en desgracia que se ha atravesado en mi camino, siempre ha recibido la ayuda necesaria, ya sea adoptandolo yo misma, o entregndoselo a algn amigo de confianza que se que tambin lo va a querer y proteger, y no hay diferencias para mi, porque tanto he rescatado perritos, gatitos y otros animales domsticos, como salvado de morir a ranitas, grillos, pajaros y la lista sigue...  Yo amo a todos los animales porque son la creacin  mas inocente y tierna de Dios,    Vayan para ti y  todos Uds. mi mas sincera admiracin por  amar  y proteger a estos seres, nuestros hermanitos menores.|`|RQC2HhRcaa	Un amigo "es un algo tan valioso" en la vida de cada quien,que no hay dinero en el mundo que lo pueda comprar...Un amigo no se compra,no se vende ni se canjea...se adopta.Quien en su camino encuentra a un animal,a quien decide no llamarle "mascota",sino "amigo",y es capz de brindarle su amistad,techo y cari?o incondicional,es un hecho que recibira ese mismo respeto,cari?o y fidelidad,cargando a ambos de una hermosa y mutua amistad llena de bendiciones.|`|ca82af4e2a219eb8a407ac58aa534fa8aa	Adopto mis animales y antes siempre cuanto gato apareca en casa yo lo adoptaba dndole comida y se quedaban en casa claro que eran gatos que no eran de nadie ariscos.|`|82a8b9258268badf6595004471371d12aa	tengo de ambas cosas, mis cones criollos los adopte y me fueron regalados , aunque los de raza si los compre y de pie de cria osea de calidad , mis tortolas las compre a criadores de aves exoticas , aunque 2 huilotas las adopte de una se?ora que las habia criado y no sabia donde tenerlas .|`|a6b33f54b24f54b73d3f746bd122768aaa	Los animales que recoges de la calle son una bendicion de Dios, pero ten cuidado fijate que esteen vacunados y sanos te lo digo porque a mi me paso ,lo recogi de la calle y no se si por negligenci o estupidez se me murio y aun lo lloro. Son lo mejor te acompa?an a compra, a pasear. Ojala tenga la suerte que yo no tuve, te lo deseo de corazon, ya que mi alma n es la misma y no logra recuperarse.Suerte!!!!!!!!!|`|xlU0a5hzaa	HOla!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Yo hago las dos cosas,,,,     Los animales que pedo adoptar los adopto,,, como perros o gatos.... tenia una perrita que la adopte,,, estaba literalmente bajo un puente.... Y actualmente tengo una gata " algo loca"  que la recogi de una casa abandonada.    Sin embargo hay animales que no se pueden adoptar,,, y aun menos coger de la naturaleza porque da?arias el ecosistema de esa region..... A veces es mejor comprarlos y que te garanticen que son criados en cautividad,,, hay especies que se estan salvando de la extincion gracias a la reproducion en cautividad de los aficionados,,,, es el caso por ejemplo de las ranas flechas,,, la Azureus,, en su pais de origen esta en peligro de extincion y debido a que muchos aficionados se dedican a reproducirlas ha dejado de estarlo. Otros animales como peces tropicales, reptiles, ect... tambien se deben de comprar porque en libertad la verdad es que no se encuentran....    Si quieres ver fotos de mis animales (la perrita y la gata)  y conocer su historias visita mi blog:     http://360.yahoo.com/profile-YnY8BLYzfqi...  Un saludo.|`|vKo7jBRdaa	Te felicito por adoptar gatitos y perritoa  de la calle  o de refugios, porque yo tambien lo hago,desde hace 17 a?os estoy recogiendo gatos callejeros,los llevo al veterinario,ahi los vacunan , desparasitan y demas,y hace 5 a?os mi mama encintro una perrita  atropellada afuera de micasa, la llevo al dr y se curo, ahora esta aqui, es una coker spaniel color miel (LEGITIMA) que nos cuida la casa como no tienes idea, super noble y jamas se nos ha enfermado al igual que  mis gatitos , en verdad que no le veo ningun riesgo a adoptarlos si primero los llevas con un veterinario a que los revisen, no es tan caro y tambien puedes ir a los antirrabicos, donde los atienden muy bien. Felicidades por tu buen corazon y siempre su como hasta ahora.|`|gRh9mSppaa	Hola Diana, te felicito antes que nada por tu decisin de adoptar, uno menos en la calle. Te dir que mis mascotas todas han sido adoptadas a excepcin de mi yorkie que fue un regalo del novio de mi hija a mi hija y digo que es mio por que soy la que mayor tiempo pasa con ella y la cuido. En fin tengo 2 gatas adoptadas y en estos momentos tengo tres perros a los que alimento y una de ellas acaba de parir 6 perritos, estn todos muy bellos y en la semana comienzo a conseguirles quien los quiera adoptar. Saludos.    pd. Los perros no tienen hogar, nadie se ocupa de ellos en mi calle y me da mucha pena que no tengan que comer, as que como buena samaritana los alimento.    pd. Antes de llevar al perrito a tu casa verifica que tenga todas sus vacunas, por que el virus del moquillo dura mucho tiempo en el ambiente.|`|YSVRPD8qaa	pues yo las compro, porque es dificil conseguir peces sueltos en la calle.    Pues para que preguntas? solo para poner puntos abajo?|`|oe26gkq1aa	Pues yo lo compro porque adoptado digo que tal vez, no se tenga mas infecciones o enfermedades y pues comprarlo yo digo que hasta viven mas los perritos y son de mas calidad

X8HNNuqHaa	both  she is showing affection, but she is also leaving her scent  take it as a compliment|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Both.|`|fSz9z6X6aa	Both...or trying to get your attention...maybe s/he wants a clean bowl of water, or new litter...|`|168b0545256a120599bd0115deaa4a3baa	I dont know all the reasons why cats do that... but its a good thing. My cat usually does it to show affection and hint that she wants attention. Its sweet when cats do that|`|chhYUigFaa	Both. Cats tend to "claim" what's theirs, and there are scent glands on the sides of their heads. By rubbing these on you (yes, it sounds gross) she tells all rival cats "back off!"    As for affection, but my cat does this as well. If you're sitting/sleeping/working and not paying attention to her, she's just happily reminding you that the princess is here...and she wants affection. Be proud of yourself- you've gained the respect of the most picky animal on Earth!|`|AA11306696	It is a mostly a way of getting you to pay attention to her.  She is also showing you affection though.|`|yJz43FOQaa	Awwwwww, it means she likes you!  True, cats do have scent glands on their cheeks so that they can mark you as theirs, but it is also a way of showing affection.  She may also be trying to get your attention by being cute and loving so that you'll lean down and give her a scratch.
5NsjAdxnaa	be nice to her, be around her alot, you be the one to feed her (if theres anyone else in the house dont let them feed her, cats like the people who feed them best?), hmm... and again, be around her alot!  God Bless!?|`|f643f02a11c371cde11a7a0260e5426eaa	I agree with everyone's comments, just love her , be the provider of food etc, talk to her..she will then become vocal with you...i adopted a 7 month old tom cat last week, he went under the table the first night we had him, and hid in my bedroom for 4 hours the second night, now he follows me around like my little shadow, greets me with big purrs when i wake up and when i come in from work...he wasnt mistreated though, so your cat may take a little longer|`|c58bf1b9c580e1efdd81d04a1e87c3f3aa	just give her love!|`|Uz5NP94laa	My cat loves to be rubbed under chin.    Buy her some toys and those little wind up   mice.The greatest thing to do is give her lots of love.|`|MSo1Yyw8aa	Be very patient with her, especially if her old owner abused her.  Don't try to force your attention on her.  Be very calm and controlled in your movements if she's skittish - that way you won't startle her.  Definitely be the one to feed her and clean the litterbox.|`|bd310cb262b94bc713276081c50ca03aaa	Just love her and then love her some  more. She will soon get the idea.|`|fS7gdhURaa	be nice and calm. give her treats a lot. pet her and play with her alot. it should work.
0xJZJggVaa	Get her spayed, crate her and shut the door to your room.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	First, crate train her.  Let her sleep in a crate in your room at night.  Then she is with you, but in her own space.  You need to reinforce that you are in charge of resources and sleeping on the bed is a priviledge, not a right.  Because she is peeing on the bed, she has not yet earned the priviledge of being there.  The rest of the day, shut the door and keep her out of the bedroom.    Also, bichons are one of the most difficult dogs to housebreak, so she is going to be more challenging for you than most dogs.  That's why crate training is so valuable.  It puts you in charge.|`|czYGbOttaa	ur wecome! put a blanket on top of your bed or take your dog off the bed!      good luck!|`|AA11756607	Close your bedroom door.|`|9sl4GWf4aa	Go wee on her bed so she knows how it feels!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	When a dog gets used to going pee somewhere, they often go back to the same spot.  Try using water mixed with Oxi-Clean or Nature's Miracle to clean the smell off the bed, so she isn't attracted to go back there.  This might be really hard, since it's a bed.  You might have to ban her from the bed for awhile, or only let her in the bed if she's sitting on your lap.
ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	Have you thought of going into the farming communities. Usually animals are loved and are useful in a farm setting.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You have a very difficult situation.  If you cannot  find someone to take these dogs in as pets, you might have to keep feeding them yourself.  Stray dogs learn to live on their own by themselves- no one teaches them.  But it sounds like there is no one to help them and there isn't much you can do.  I would try to find some non-Muslim people who might want a dog.
EONpYc6raa	Are you feeding wet food? Wet has a lot less carbs, and is overall much healthier for cats. Here's one of my favorite articles regarding feline obesity, and it's written by a veterinarian. It may be of some help or interest to you. :) http://www.catnutrition.org/obesity.html    Also, give your fat cat a lot more exercise, obviously. Place his food up on an elevated surface, and he'll have to work a little to get to it. You may want to consider investing in a harness and leash and taking him for some supervised outside time. Many cats are a lot more active outdoors, especially when there's bugs and other enticing, fast-moving objects.     When the other cats are done with their food, take it up. If they have a tendency to come back to it later to finish, then just secure fat cat in another room until they eat it all, or put it away and give it to them when they come back looking for it.|`|AA10859773	Feed them all a good quality canned food.  The fat one will lose weight and the others will maintain or perhaps even gain as needed.    Canned food is far superior to dry, and it's the only thing I'd ever recommend (outside of feeding raw).    See the What to feed link for suggestions on GOOD foods.  You don't want to feed anything you can get at the supermarket.    Also see the articles on obesity and how to deal with it - which will tell you the same thing I did.    And see the article on how to introduce a new food.|`|cb62e2a843c7d59e6cc8db2148976075aa	My cat is currently on a diet of lo-cal food, 1 cup per day. Since my other cat is still a kitten, they are fed seperately and the bowls aren't left out. Good luck.|`|9XHwPNt2aa	Lo-Cal food, and feed it seperately when you are feeding the others, say if you get up in the am and you start to feed the kitties in the kitchen, Take the dieter to the bathroom or another room in the house and let it eat alone.  When the other kitties are done in the kitchen pick up thier bowls and put remaining food back in bag until next time you feed. If fat cat doesn't eat it all either put it up for later. Although I suspect he will eat it all ;)|`|MSo1Yyw8aa	My vet considers anything over 12 pounds overweight for a cat, so it sounds like you have TWO fat cats! :)    Probably you should feed him in a separate room and not let him out until the others are done with their food so that he doesn't have the opportunity to eat it all.  Good luck!|`|FGXZG6ayaa	I went through this with my own fat cat who went from 20 to 12 pounds.  All I did was measure her food and at feeding time she ate hers in a carrier.  As soon as the other cats were done, all dishes were put away and fat cat could come out.  We got cat toys and played with her a lot too.  Good luck!|`|aBCdAtXBaa	Seperate him into a different room when you feed him.  Get him a special food made for animals to loose weight. Make sure he does not have access to the other cats' food too.  Eating right is just half of it.  Make sure you play with him A LOT and get him to exercise.  It is important to keep your cat at a healthy weight because my 'fat cat' as we called him got severe diabetes and we had to put him down.  Don't let this happen to your cat and I wish you good luck :)

P1mi6pUYaa	My dog has had problems throwing up bright yellow fluid.  It's stomach liquid and bile.  My dog did it a lot before, because something in his food didn't agree with him.  Also, some dogs stop having problems if their food is left out all day for them to nibble on as they get hungry (but it sounds like you are already doing that).  Some dogs stomach gets upset when they have it completely empty for so long.  Anyway, try gradually switching him to a new food.|`|AA10770705	u should take him 2 the vet. i have 2 shih-tzus. it is against the law 4 u to buy a dog from a breeder and them not give u papers if it is full blood. give it a warm bath feed it warm milk and take it 2 the vet|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Don't start to panic.  Dogs throw up all the time and it's not serious. If it was bright yellow fluid, he likely just ate some grass.  You shouldn't be force feeding him by hand, let his stomach settle and he'll eat when he feels better.  If he still seems sick tomorrow, it's be a good idea to get the vet to check him out, but don't start to worry yet!!|`|ff243f137b1418459da4e7a0cc73aef7aa	Ok, well this sounds like what happend with out mini schnauzer. We got her from this puppy mill, which we didnt know of until we got there to get out puppy. She said they are all loved every day and all the junk, but when we took her home SHE WAS FREAKED OUT ABOUT EVERYTHING.!! They didnt even take them outside to get used to other things besides this little cage thing in this hot area.     ok enought about me, lol, your dog is probably throughing up acid, he just has a stomache ache from what it seems like. Call the vet and ask them what they think you should do it could be serious but if he was just fine until today, he probably isnt feeling good.|`|AEgyejCNaa	What you should always do when first getting a dog is taking the dog to the vet to make sure it has a clean bill of health. Obviously you think that the breeder didn't go a very good job of taking care of your dog... this might mean that she failed to take the dog to regular vet visits.    Take the dog to the vet regardless of whether or not this might be a serious health problem. You can tell the vet what is happening as well as make sure your dog is healthy in all other aspects.    Next time make sure that you buy from a reputable breeder who takes the pups/dogs to the vets and gives you paperwork so you can make sure the pup/dog is healthy before you take it home.|`|XZoYjav9aa	the bright yellow fluid is pretty common. watch him and if he does it again just call you local vet. you should always take a new pet to the vet anyway just to make sure. so yeah just watch him today. and he will probably feel better tomorrow and if not call your vet. make a appt for a routine check up. and there you go.

2t4RBAgUaa	take him to the vet.|`|bBpYmFcaaa	Your local vet can do blood work to see what kind off dog he is and tell you every thing you need to know to keep him happy and healthy|`|P1mi6pUYaa	My vet showed me how to tell if my dog is the right weight.  It's easier if your dog has short hair.  Put your hand on the dog's side, where his ribs are.  If you are not pushing at all and just barely resting your hand on him, you should not feel his ribs.  If you do, he's too skinny.  If you press a little bit, you should feel them.  If you don't, and you can't feel them unless you press hard, he's too fat.|`|7hBxbthQaa	Keep an eye on his body's condition, if he seems bony, then you should definitely consider altering your feeding regimen.      You should not be able to see the ribs or hip bones of the dog.  There should be a solid layer of tissue over them.    It might not be a bad idea to consult your vet who can give you tips about what to feed your dog.
fd084ea5251793e8be9788692c598ce0aa	I think you probably got his shots a bit too soon.  He may have needed a bit more time to bond with you before you took him to a strange place and had him jabbed and poked by a stranger.  LOL!  While it was necessary, it may have been too much for him. Plus, the shots will cause a reaction too - so he may still be a bit sore and woozy from them.  Give him some time to fully recover.    He should get a second round of shots in a few weeks.  Until then, socialize him as much as possible.  Granted, you still have to be careful because his immune system has to build up, so you can't just let him play with anyone or any dog yet, but keep having him on walks and meeting people.  After his second round of shots, he should start building a good immunity to many diseases (although he won't have had his rabies vaccine yet).  But now he might be able to play with other dogs and people.    Once he's had his rabies vaccination, your dog should be fully immunized.  I would then strongly suggest obedience training.  There, your dog will be socialized with other people and dogs.  If he has a fear of vets, you can work on that too.  A social, well-trained dog is a joy (I know because I have two) and is worth the time and $$.      But for now, just continue to bond with him.  He may always be a bit shy, but I think you can help work most of that out of him.    Good luck!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	He'll be OK.  The vet probably scared him, like it does for lots of dogs.  And when my dog was a puppy, I had him at a shopping center where there were lots of people, and he got scared, too.      You can keep letting him meet people, but maybe not at a place where there are lots of people.  He might just get overwhelmed.|`|bGnYnFGuaa	Puppy's tend to become more iffy when after they get there first shots. Some puppy's first shots don't affect them, others it does. He is probably semi sore or irritated. If this IS is first shot his body may not be used to the drug given. He will most likely get better and recover from this.      Keep us posted on his progress.      Claire & Trix|`|AA11514432	of course your puppy is scared but i wouldnt say traumatized yet. you should care for him, reward him with treats and praise after encounters with people to show him that not all people have needles :-)|`|AA10717403	Whenever my dogs have gotten shots(i have 3), they wine a little bit, and for the rest of the day or even a few days later they're a bit calmer or shy or sleepy. Especially their first one, because the needle of course hurt in that spot, and it may be sore to walk on. But he should be back to normal soon. Remember, he's just a puppy so he's still getting used to the world. My dog had puppies, and they were scared when they got their shots.
2wDJmluOaa	Las artemias son .... pues unos como pececitos muy peque?os (naranjas) los venden en los acuarios o tiendas para mascotas en bolsas de plastico, son muy baratas como un peso (mexicano) cada bolsita y las bolsitas duran 3 o 4 dias. Se les tienen que poner a las ranas o tortugas con una redecita (no todas el mismo dia, sino de a poquito) dentro del tortuguero que las tengas.

La Artemia salina es un peque?o organismo que vive en las aguas salobres e hipersalinas de todo el mundo. Es la presa viva ms adecuada para la alimentacin de los estadios post-larvarios de muchas especies de peces y crustceos marinos. Y en su fase adulta resulta un aporte interesante para multitud de invertebrados y peces que pueblan nuestro acuario. Este peque?o ser es un crustceo de la subclase de los anostrceos y conforma el plancton de las aguas continentales salobres.        suerte.........|`|AyNxAHNSaa	las artemias son pecesitos blancos en agua como naranja,las puedes coprar en cualquier lugar mercados etc.  cuando se la des utiliza la red bacia las artemias en la red y echales agua para que se desinfecte.suerte|`|M6onhWpGaa	Hola la artemia segun yo son camaroncitos rojizos, que ayudan al crecimiento de tus peces y son el alimento vivo preferido de muchos.    Las consigues en tiendas especializadas en peces, pero mas que comprarlas te recomiendo que las cries tu misma ya que a veces son dificiles de conseguir, no las consigues con mucha frecuencia, no es muy cara pero a la larga lo reciente tu bolsillo, y lo hay muhos peces que no toleran el alimento seco, ai que no esta nada mal tenerlas en tu propia casa y hacer negocio entre peces por artemia.    Segun se las artemias pueden vivir en agua salobre, asi puedes criarlas con una buena combinacion de peces, dejame intentarlo y a lo mejor luego comento resultados.

Have you boarded him recently or had him with other dogs?  Dogs can get kennel cough anytime they are boarded even if they had their bordatella shot (for kennel cough).

I will let my pug go at it with "his cat" every night. He is neutered and very submissive. The only thing to look out for is if she tries to do this to someone or another dog. Then you will need to put a stop to this immediately.|`|dt4sa1gNaa	Either get him fixed or when he does his humperooni,then take it away and say "NO!NO HUMP"and dont give it back to him until your sure he wont do it for a while.Then if he does it again,do the same thing...|`|P1mi6pUYaa	She's being dominant.  At least she doesn't hump you....

I'd just let her do it.  It's just a bear...

Bloody spots showing up on any hard floors she moves over.|`|onGiq3Aaaa	dont breed her until she is at least 2 yrs, the signs of heat is large vulva,bleeding, and standing and lifting her tail up''    there should be no reason why you should breed this dog if you have no idea when a dog is in heat    is your dog champion  akc papered  ofa,hip,eyes, etc certified  does she have a good tempermant  do you have homes lined up for the puppies    just love her as a family pet dont breed her unless you have all of those quialitys|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Her vulva will be swollen, and she'll have some bloody discharge for part of the time she's in heat.  Males will try to seek her out.  Her nipples might be swollen, too.|`|XAeY2oZYaa	The blood spots will be obvious on your floor or if she is licking herself alot more to keep it clean from the blood.
UZC8HxaUaa	i used to have one... well it can stay under for a long time. but it will come up when it needs air.. also.. if you have a big tank its in.. but a big rock in it thts 1/2 outta the water.. with a light on top. they love the light and will lay out for hours. and they can live as long as u want them to in a house.. but ours started getting mean and huge so we put it in a lake..   hope this helps. =]]|`|5c2d508a6be68d310b08af45f0f8b24baa	I had one from when I was about 5 until I was 19 or 20, so he lived for a really long time, we had some friends for him, they didnt live as long maybe 3-5 years max, I guess it is just the turtle. . . Mine liked to stay out of the water a lot.|`|sSlxwrSLaa	Mine stays under for a long time.|`|McnuekTBaa	They can stay under water all winter when they are hibernating.  In the summer, when their oxygen needs are greater, they can only stay under water a few minutes.  Their lifespan is dependent on the care they are given.  Most people on Yahoo apparently refuse to read any books on reptile care, and so I don't think their animals live very long.|`|S90DkATfaa	Why do you keep asking questions on here?! Just read a book or go on the internet!
krDZGz17aa	He's used to you being there. When he would potty, would you tell him "Good boy?" If you did that's what he's looking for when your out there with him. Get the pads again. What you could do is when you let him out tell him " Go potty!" and keep telling him that.|`|obY1dRW7aa	put him on a leash or if you have fenced yard just put him outside until he  goes to the bathroom|`|P1mi6pUYaa	If he still understands to use the pee pads, try putting one inside until he uses it, then moving it outside.  See if he'll try to go near the pad, where he already peed.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Your local shelter or breed rescue.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Look on petfinder.com.  There are lots of rescued Yorkies there, and they are cheaper than those from breeders.|`|AA12127827	search any of these sites, you can search for a pet in your area at any of these.   www.hoobly.com  www.local.com  www.puppyfind.com  www.petsunlimited.com  www.petfinder.com  or if you dont require a pure, you can check local shelters.
AA11193920	If it was very hard, I am thinking the puppy is dehydrated or you are possibly mixing the formula too strong. I would weaken the formula a little and feed the puppy more.     What happened to the mother? If she is unable or unwilling to care for the puppy, check with the local pounds or rescue groups to see if anyone has an available lactating *****. (Many times, another ***** will take on an extra puppy, without any problems.) If you can get the puppy with a "foster" mother to feed her until she is about 6 weeks or so. Good luck.|`|wWDAWmBdaa	Get a warm damp face cloth and gently massage her anal area. You also need to help them pee too so do the same around the vagina. This will stilulate her to go. Do this after each feed. This will simulate the licking the mother would do.     If it continues to be hard into tomorrow call your vet for advice. You may need to change the formula, but that is a good one.    What happened to the mother? I sure hope she's okay.    I will star this for some my contacts who are great breeders.    Good luck!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	If at all possible, you should get the pup back to her mother.  But if you can't, you should call a vet for help to see what all you need to do for her.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	same as first answer. you need to do what the mother would do. warm wet cloth like dogs tongue, wipe gently to stimulate. as for the hard movement, it will cause blockage if impacted , check with vet about nutrition and amount of water being added....|`|474e01f29922bf7a5bea8026a7198dbdaa	Take a damp lukewarm washcloth and gently wipe the pups tush until bowel movement is passed. This will stimulate the pup into bowel movement. This mimics a mother licking a pups tush for this purpose.     I honestly wish you and the pup good luck.
lL3G1ewVaa	Don't worry that's normal everytime she is on heat personal experience.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Yes, it's normal for the vulva to swell during every heat.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Yes.  After this heat cycle, you should wait a couple of weeks and then get her spayed.  Believe me, if you haven't considered it yet, you will be eager to do it after this is over....|`|310205740397c0bcd71197a53cf76d04aa	Yes ! thats part of the heat cycle for sure !!!|`|CXykNfCAaa	Yeah, it would last about a week or so. Very messy. Have a female pug myself. If you are a breeder find a male soon. The swelling will go done in time. And don't worry, things are going to be fine!! Good luck to you.

1fMkQfoyaa	There's no reason you shouldn't get one as long as you can handle the responsibility both dogs are going to be. Especially since the Ridgeback was already ok with another dog.

Three months is sort of a 'honeymoon' period... he would probably do fine with another dog but I think he deserves to embed himself into your family.  Think about it being like adopting a child (not baby) - he has already been disassociated from his previous family for reasons he has no idea what are - he is accepting your family well but then bring in another child/baby and take much needed attention away from him at this point in time -- I am not saying don't eventually get another dog if you have the time and are capable of dealing with two dogs, but I would just give this guy a little more settle in time.

The amound varies from dog to dog.  I have Newfs, and all of them are different, but NONE eat what the bag says they should eat.  You feed enough to maintain a healthy weight.

You should be able to feel the ribs easily!!!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Look on the bag of food and feed what they recommend for his weight.|`|AA11126062	Well they should be fed once their food and water bowl is empty. They wont get to fat just tall. Make sure to give him some exercise!|`|WfpFGjgoaa	My Lab/Dane female mix is 18 months old, about 29 inches at the withers and weighs around 80 pounds.     Large breeds should be fed several times per day instead of one large meal. Just look on the bag for your dogs weight and split it into two or three feedings. Both my Great Dane and Dane/Lab mix are very active and require more food than suggested on the bag. Use that amount as a starting point and go from there, depending on what your dog needs to maintain a healthy weight.    If your pup truely is a Dane mix, you should not be feeding puppy food. Switch to a large breed formula adult food. Danes mature very slowly and the adult food is a better option. Growing too quickly can cause many bone and joint problems.    Also bloat is a common problem with Great Danes, another reason you should feed several smaller meals per day. If your pup starts getting fairly tall, you may want to think about raising the food and water bowls. We used plant stands, which are much cheaper than going to your local pet store.    Good luck to you and your pup!
AOMIvMoUaa	I absolutely love your question! I myself wondered the same things too when my 3 yr old toy fox terrier behaves oddly.    I have gradually come to the understanding that everything they do is to try to tell us something.  Just like humans know that we sometimes need to use gestures rather than words to help them understand, they probably feel the exact same way towards us, as barking will usually just get them in trouble.      Sometimes my terrier will look me in the eyes without blinking or moving...just concentrating real hard on my eyes.  I took her up on the staring challenge one day and after 2 minutes of staring each other down, she ran to her leash.  So, I took her out and she immediately went to the bathroom.  She only poos outside so its imperative to walk her regularly.  But in a household of 4 people, its hard to keep track of whether or not shes already been walked.  Now, whenever she stares anyone down, we know what she wants.      Your dog is most likely a very intelligent companion.  Dogs that know when to be on guard have better chances of survival than dogs that are friendly to anything that moves.  Your dog guards you because it recognizes you as their friend or maybe even caregiver.  Regardless of who they think you are to them, you are important enough to them to protect.      As for the racing around the house bit...I have heard different interpretations of this behavior.  It could be that they are just playful or...they could be chasing something that we humans don't see.  I know its eerie but I honestly believe that animals have a sixth sense...like babies may have.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Sounds as if you have a very perceptive, smart dog who wants to understand you.    Why don't you go to the library and get a book on dog behavior, then you will have some idea of your dog's thinking and begin to understand him.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Yep, I'm pretty sure they think we're totally nuts.  They probably do think they are taking care of us.  I think they see life like the dog in the Beggin Strips commercial- It's BACON!!  lol|`|59823bf219d5256138a93ad7aa605c7aaa	To understand a dog perspective, you need to befriend with the dog. If tarzan know what his primate friend think, then you should to. Eat bone, spray the street light with your wee, chase the postman and sleep in the tiny dog house.    A dog has a curious syndrome. Easy to get fall into hi-rate heart bumping when you do meet a stranger. Nor jealousy or ego, but the dog is a man best friend. Alien going to conquer the world, so the dog will be a hero.    Your question is relate to Ace Ventura, or Doctor Doolittle. Since both are busy, then I need to spend my time answering yours. Give your dog viagra, and then you can tell me what your dog think. But it shouldn't happen. You're dog gonna get killed. That should be your next question, if you care about it.    But then, when you put your psychic thing on your dog's mind when your male dog see you're watching tv. The dog will think, you are very bore lazy guy.    When you talking to the phone, the dog think, he thought you're crazy, since nobody infront of you, or you must be talking to soul that he can see infront of you, if exist.    When you going out, the dog think, you must need a fresh air, so bring him out, since he's a man best friend.    When you go working, he think, ah... new bone, new Friskies, new treat, buy me new one, or atleast get a hottie lady dog from petshop.    When you're on computer, the dog think at said, "At least, show me Paris Hilton undress."    So, if you think I'm wrong, then you MUST know what your dog think about you.    The dog need your trust, and your treat.
P1mi6pUYaa	I'd take him to another vet.  He might have an infection in his anal glands or something like that.  I think if he has puss coming out, he should get some antibiotics.  Do you usually have his anal glands expressed?  If not, they can get backed up and infected.  Take him to someone else and see what they say.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	If there is puss that is a sign of a bad infection and you should get it looked at by another vet. Then have a serious talk with the owner of the kennel you boarded the dog at if he really has something wrong everytime.|`|exZFGAQXaa	could be a enlarged gland, did you provide them with his food or did they feed him different food?  I've had a Cavalier King Charles and this dog had more problems with those glands than anything, they had to get drained at least every quarter because they got really swollen.  The vet told me it's from the dog food because when the stool passes the glands and it's hard enough they actually squeeze out naturally but if the stool is too soft then the glands swell more and more.  Check with the vet i hope it's something simple as that.  I hope your sweetie feels better soon|`|aH2vQnOoaa	tell your dog i said he ought to quit licking himself there because if he gets that from his *** to his balls god knows what is coming out of there  next|`|KNbZEPFVaa	your dog could possibly have anxiety issues when it is away from you, causing him to have habits that he doesn't normally have when you are around (ie dragging his butt on the cement); or just doesn't like that boarding kennel.  try another kennel or try having some one come to your home to care for the dog.    the red bump could be a boil (large ZIT), u could possibly lance it, but be sure to have plenty of alcohol and/or peroxide on hand to clean it (make sure you KNOW it can be lanced).  OR just leave it, if it is a boil, it will often burst on its own, at which time, you should clean it if you are able to.    Or take him back to the vet

O3q8Qvivaa	16 oz. bottle isopropyl alcohol (or witch hazel)  4 tablespoons Boric Acid Powder  16 drops Gentian Violet 1% Solution     Mix all ingredients in the alcohol bottle & shake. (make sure you shake before every application).     Treatment: Fill ear with solution & massage gently for 30 seconds and wipe with a tissue. Fill a second time and just wipe without massaging. The dog will shake the excess out. Be careful, the Gentian Violet could stain.  I use a eye dropper to fill the ear.     Treatment:  2 times per day for the first 2 weeks  1 time per day for the next 2 weeks  1 time per month thereafter    If you are concerned about the alcohol burning the inside of the ear (it could if the dog has been scratching its ear), then you can substitute the alcohol with witch hazel.    All ingredients are available at a pharmacy. The Boric Acid is usually in the First Aid section where you find the alcohol.    The Gentian Violet will be the hardest to find and may need to be special ordered. Rite Aid carries it, so does Longs....Walgreens? CVS? don't know.|`|16668b9d558f1fe179a12d76976df8c6aa	You can mix one and a half tablespoons of vinagar to one cup warm water. This makes way too much for one ear cleaning, but works well in a pinch. Also you can use saIine solution, used for contact lenses. I would use this only until you can get some ear cleaner from your vet or pet store. It will not harm your dog but doesn't work as well as most commercially prepared ear wash.|`|1d5d8bccd65f8dda49977dd81c81f96faa	This is not a hit or miss situation when ur dealing with an ear infection, especially if it`s something that can get into the dog`s ear canal. You could do more harm than good by using a home remedy. Call ur vet and ask what u should use to clean the ear if u cannot purchase the product u thought u had. Better safe than sorry.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Here's a recipe for a homemade ear cleaner, but these ingredients might not be stuff you have on hand.      http://www.zimfamilycockers.com/EarClean...    But you could use rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball, and just clean your dog's ears that way for today, then go buy the cleaner tomorrow.|`|1dc2a4b12d939b091fdcc5e52cd85a79aa	My puppy recently had an inner ear infection.  The vet supplied antibiotics, ear drops and a medically formulated ear flush, 'P1/0'.  The ingredients listed on the container are:  "Tromethamine (Tris) USP, Edetate Disodium Dihydrate (EDTA) USP, buffered to pH 8 with Tromethamine HCL in deionized water".    I suggest you obtain proper medication for your dog from your vet or inquire with another animal professional.    Good luck!
BDeIjCgFaa	scold her in a deep voice, look bigger thatn her, and mean, say, "NO" when she poos by yer door, and be really nice to her when she dosnt. If that dosnt work. obidence trainer.|`|6pzCNM5Caa	One thing people forget is to have their dog go potty BEFORE they come back in the house.  It may have been hours since she last pottied.. she may have been asleep.. Dogs often need to potty when they are excited or when they start a new activity.      I had a show dog who would have to poop 3 times before he was shown because he would get so excited.    If my dogs have been outside for a few hours I bring them in .. work on a few tricks with them.. and send them back out to potty... at which point they get treats for pottying.|`|jCr9YOxDaa	Well invest in a wire crate and crate the dog when she cannot be watched. When she isn't crated only allow her confined freedom in a room where you can watch her. And when I say watch, I mean watch like a toddler in a room with Ming vases. You need to catch her in the act and every time you miss catching her is an opportunity missed. The more you catch her, the faster she learns. I don't mean for this to be rude in any way, but how fast a dog learns depends on the individual dog isn't a reflection on their intelligence. If you are patient and consistent she will house break and be reliable, but it's up to you how well she'll be able to do that.    P.S. A crate should be large enough for the dog to stand up and turn around with ease. I'd consider crating her indoors during the day. It's much safer for her.|`|SuCzwFzPaa	i guess it became a custom to your dog like when you ring a bell during eating time and the dog will salivate. my idea is take her out on a walk and once she smells the other dogs stuff and notices where it is she will pick it up|`|P0N3uhOCaa	First, crate your pup. Feed her, take her out immediately and then put her in her crate.   She has developed a habit and you need to break her of it quickly. Keep her in her crate for the most part and let her "earn" her free time outside of the crate.    Even then, do not let her roam freely.    Also, try using the matchstick method. Feed her as usual, pick her up (if she's not too big) and stick an unused match in her rectum. Take her outside immediately and she should poop. Give her a treat, praise and take her in, but still do not leave her unattended.|`|1XJQjKYXaa	Your dog has not been properly trained if she spends most of her time outside.  You need to properly train her to go to the bathroom by having her in the house when you can watch her and take her outside to the same spot everytime she goes out on a leash and have her potty then reward her greatly right there do not wait to come into the house to reward her.  She needs to be confined to a small space while in the house when no one can watch her because the more she has accidents the more she will not learn it inappropraite to go in the house, each accidents sets you back several days to weeks in housetraining. eliminate the potential for accidents so they can not happen and she will understand better you dont go inside.  Make sure you are cleaning up accidents with an appropriate enzymatic dog odor/stain remover because even if you dont see it your dog could still smell it and will continue to think its okay to go inside.
pLCtEBf5aa	Oh I am SO sorry. Had you only known or suspected poison. The vet could have given a blood test and administered vitamin K. But unless you give them a heads up that's a possibility they may not know what is wrong. And since you didn't know or suspect....I know it seems too little too late. I feel so bad for you Could someone in your neighborhood have given the dog something with rat poison in it?  The trouble is if it is not found very quickly, rat poison destroys the organs and it is irreversible and will always result in death. I'm sorry. May your pain ease soon.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Yes it takes several days before the posion begins to react on the the pets organs. Had you known that he consumed posion they could have started Vitamin K injections to counteract the posion.  I'm so sorry for your lost.|`|RKXDlfW8aa	yes it can take that long due to so many other factors play a huge part in discovering the real culprit in this case sadly Rat poison!   I'm so sorry to hear of your beloved doggies passing!  let me ask you .when your dog went to the potty where did she goe ?  Perhaps off your property on to someone Else's lawn or in an alley or ??  It could be some one put it out for her or maybe she got into someones trash?  either one you would have to have prove which sadly enough you don't!    Like i said it is so many similar signs they can show that may resemble poisoning like seizures or a bad  bowle  problem.    Again My condolences to you !    Animal lover/owner of many /adovcate for spay/neuter/neglected /abused and abandoned animals !!|`|EmpI7lkDaa	omg are you serious? i think you should file a law suit with them for your dog, it's not right|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your dog.  It sounds like the vet did what they could.  They probably didn't immediately realize your dog was poisoned until she started having organ problems.  The vet usually only knows that if the owner tells them that the dog ate something or might have eaten something poisonous.  But since you didn't know, she didn't know either.  Once a dog ingests and digests something, I don't think there's much that can be done.  To recover from poisoning, you would have had to discover your dog ate it and take her to the vet right away.  Then the vet would have removed everything from her stomach and fed her some stuff to absorb the poison.  Even then, the dog can suffer organ problems.  I am so sorry to hear of your dog.|`|FUmjD9b3aa	Since you had no knowledge of your dog eating any rat poison and the only symptom your dog had was diarrhea, and you had recently changed her food, it could have been a simple matter of not handling the new food well.  By day two they knew she was in big trouble because she was bleeding out internally, but if they thought it was rat poison at that time, it was actually too late to save her.  Once the bleeding gets severe there just isn't much that can be done.  Possibly transfusions may have helped but no guarantee and I know that here, transfusions for my dog were $500 each.      I am so very sorry this has happened to your dog and to you.  Have you any idea where she got the poison?  Do you have some out?  If not, was she allowed to run loose in your neighborhood?      Dogs that are kept in a fenced yard and walked on leashes are much less likely to get into something like the poison.  Truly, caring for your dog is very similar to caring for a child.

IRzcmiUcaa	could be fear from never being crated or she could be having separation anxiety.  i would put something in the crate that smells like you to comfort her when you are gone (like a blanket, sheet, etc).  also, keep her crate in a central location in the house (like the living room if that's where you spend the most time) so she's not confined to a part of the house she isn't that used to.  keep the door open while you are home...she should get used to it after a bit and will soon consider it a safe place.  last thing, make sure the crate is not too big for her breed.|`|sTQuLOh3aa	I don't have a clue what a Morkie is.

Try to give her a blanket in her crate.  Otherwise you might have to let her adjust to her new home.
Bw18seFqaa	either frontline or advantage is good..  there is also k9 advantix which kills and repels fleas ticks and mosquitos.  Do not use advantix tho if you have cats..  its very toxic to cats, and even contact with residue from the dog's coat can cause problems!  If you have cats, use the frontline or advantage.. if you do not have cats, the K9 advantix is better.    I use heartgard on my dogs.  There are a few other choices for heartworm preventative,  what you choice may depend on what your vet carries.  As long as your dog is on a preventatitve tho, its all good.    I have been told tho, that if you keep your dog on hartguard, and he/she still comes down with heartworm while on the preventative, Merial will pay for the heartworm treatment.  I do not know if other companies off the same guarantee.    Many of the heartworm preventatives also offer prevention for other intestinal parasites.  You can discuss with your vet which parasites your dog is at risk for and which preventative would be best.  The vet may still want to do a HW test before putting your dog on a preventative.    Sentinel is used in the prevention of heartworm disease and in the control of hookworm, roundworm and whipworm. Sentinel is also used to control fleas by preventing the development of flea eggs. The medication does not kill adult fleas.    Interceptor is used in dogs and cats for the prevention of heartworm disease and in the control of hookworm and roundworm. In dogs, Interceptor is also used in the control of whipworm.     Heartgard is an anthelminthic (dewormer) used for the prevention of heartworm disease in dogs and cats. Heartgard is also used for the control of hookworm in cats. Combined with pyrantel pamoate (Heartgard Plus), it also protects against hookworm and roundworm in dogs.        You can also opt for Advantage Multi, and Revolution for flea and heartworm preventative, instead of 2 separate medications.    Advantage Multi for Dogs is a once a month topical solution used for the prevention of heartworm disease, to kill adult fleas, to treat flea infestation and to treat and control intestinal parasites including hookworm, roundworm and whipworm in dogs and puppies 7 weeks of age or older and weighing 3 lbs or more. Advantage Multi for Cats is a once a month topical solution used for the prevention of heartworm disease, to kill adult fleas, to treat flea infestation and to treat and control of ear mites and intestinal parasites including hookworm, and roundworm in cats and kittens 9 weeks of age or older and weighing 2 lbs or more.    Revolution is a topical parasiticide used in the treatment or prevention of heartworm disease, fleas, the American dog tick, ear mites and canine sarcoptic mange in dogs. When used in cats it is used in the treatment or prevention of heartworm disease, fleas, ear mites and also to prevent hookworm and roundworm disease.|`|1FopKjA8aa	I prefer Revolution, and here's why ... it's a once-a-month treatment that you give on the same day of every month.  It protects against fleas, ticks, heartworm, and internal parasites.  It's easy ... just part the dog's hair between the shoulder-blades, and squeeze it onto her skin (most likely she won't even notice it).    I give this to both of my dogs, and neither of them has ever had a flea, a tick, or a worm, and both of them have tested heartworm-clear every time.  I get it from my vet.    Heartgard is fine for the colder months (I don't know where you live) if you're sure there's no risk of fleas/ticks.  We give Heartgard from November through March, but it isn't all that much cheaper.      The most important thing is to protect against heartworm.  Fleas, ticks, and intestinal worms are not desirable, of course, but heartworm can be deadly.|`|143a844a8d8e9a3769389ba7cdda7ba6aa	yes that is safe to do and it doesnt really matter they are the same really so id just go by prices|`|opVutvuWaa	I prefer K9 Advantix (Advantage is only for fleas).  Advantix does flea, tick and mosquitoes by repelling    Frontline is not considered a repellent, but it does work better for those pets who have a current flea problem (because it will kill flea adults and eggs)    For heartworm, I prefer Interceptor.  It is labeled to heartworm, and general deworming for roundworms, hookworms and whipworms.  (heartguard is only labled for heartworm, roundworms and hookworms)    The vet I work for also sells Advantix cheaper and Interceptor (by a few dollars).|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I use Frontline and I really like it.  I've never had any flea or tick problems with my dog.  He lives inside, but we go for walks every day and to the park about once a week.  I've never seen a bug on him.  I also use Sentinel for his heartworm pill, because it keeps fleas from being able to reproduce (I'm allergic to fleas, so it's a big concern).  For me, it's worth the little bit of extra money it costs.  I haven't ever used Heartguard or Advantage, but I've heard good things about them.  I've never heard anyone complain.    I have gotten my Frontline and Sentinel from PetMeds, and they weren't expired.      If you have reason to suspect your dog might have heartworms or you're extra worried, you can have the vet do the test- it's really easy and I don't think it's that expensive.  But if the shelter already did it, she's probably okay.  The shelter probably was giving her heartworm preventative after she had the test.|`|bf09288c6c419fedb8f56ab13cc52622aa	i think advantage is the best because i use it for my dog and we are out all the time i have not fond a flea yet i have been using it for 4months its great
bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Forget the training pads and teach him to go outside. Using the pads is only going to confuse him and teach him its ok to eliminate indoors. http://www.tiaspetplace.com/housetrainin...    As for the water bowl, get a heavier one.|`|61fbe97a924b66e641621eac7cb329a2aa	First,     You should probably...train your lab to pee/poop outside instead of on a training pad. It's alot easier that way. You need to take him out every 20-30 minutes during the day, especially after he eats or plays. Housetraining does take quite a bit of time, but he will catch on. Lots of praise & treats for going outside /on the pee pad.     As for knocking over the water bowl, If you dont already have one. Get one that is heavy, such as ceramic, metal..some of the bowls have a weighted bottom or something where you cant move it. (a rubber bottom). Or you can try and get one of the water jugs that looks like a water bottle/that drains into a bowl..and those are pretty hard to knock over.     good luck.|`|v5qfK2m5aa	associate his bad behavior with the removal of something he loves.|`|bb98f7a156f1ef793e7e330a23f87df6aa	You need to teach your dog to potty outside. Training pads rarely work because dogs don't realize they are only supposed to go on the pad and not throughout the entire house if they feel like it.  Take him outside a few times an hour and say "go potty". Also, when you are going outside say "let's go potty outside" so he relates outside to going potty.  As for the water bowl, labs love water. I had a black lab who would tip the water bowl over and then roll in it and he got in the bathtub every day and even learned to turn the water on. Get a bowl that has a suction on the bottom so it isn't easy to tip over.    Also, consider getting a baby pool or a sprinkler for him to run around in outside. Labs love the water and he will have lots of fun playing in it.|`|VHhoYAXuaa	Like everyone else said, train him outside. He needs to be brought in and out every 20-30 minutes. This will go on for months as he is still growing and cannot control his urges. Also, please don't expect him to tell you when he has to go until he is atleast 8 months old or older. It takes time and patience.    As far as tipping the water bowl...my male lab did that, too. He usually did it when he was bored and wanted to play. Is your puppy being left home alone a lot? If so, please reconsider keeping him. Puppies are a huge responsibility and Labs especially need lots of love and attention.    Labs are quick learners but ONLY if you give them the time to learn. Don't expect too much out of your puppy just yet. He is still literally a baby! If you cannot be there for him during the day when he is this young, then he will not adjust properly and may become VERY HARD for you to handle when weighs 3x as much as he does now..

mJFgCvYlaa	Yes, driftwood and plants can help you lower the PH. But, you want to check out your water supply as well, you could have hard water that could be the cause of PH at a higher level than you want. If that's the case, use a typical water conditioner at your fish store, not only it breaks down chlorine, but some of the heavy metals too. If you let your tank establish after some time (about a year) the PH will gradually lower due to the organic decomposing in the tank as well. <br>  <br>  Check the forum site below, and you'll find a handful of info on any fish questions.|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	hello try this web sight<br>  <a href="http://www.sydneycichlid.com/aquarium-hardness.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sydneycichlid.com/aquarium-ha...</a>
91bhiXTVaa	Are you buying adults or ducklings?  Ducklings need heat lamps to stay warm, a site with instructions on rearing ducklings is listed below.  Follow the links to duck or duckling care.<br>  <br>  How many ducks do you plan to get?  At least 2 are recommended as ducks are social and need company while you're away.  If ducklings, consider more, to account for mortality.<br>  <br>  The cheapest duck house we've used is a dog house.  We've found that "dogloos" are good broody houses and regular doghouses can be modified into duck houses.  Doghouses can often be found free or cheap on Craigslist, make certain it's sturdy before you take it.  <br>  Next take the bottom (if any) off the doghouse.  Get 2 x 6 or wider wood, and cut it to match the dimensions of the doghouse.  The house will rest on the 2 x 6 frame.  Before nailing the doghouse to the frame, stretch 1/2 inch mesh hardware cloth over the frame and use fence staples to fasten it down.  We used vinyl coated hardware cloth to make it easier on the duck's feet.  Then nail or screw the doghouse to the frame.  The mesh frame allows poop to fall through, making maintainence easier.  Then you can use hinges to attach a plywood door to the house and a latch to seal it against predators.  When open, the door will act as a ramp for the ducks to walk in and out of their, so put the hinges at the bottom.|`|oA6lLktKaa	Ducks are great pets. First of all, basically the only pen you need is a small coop. Just build it out of wire, or buy one. Typically these are built with a wire roof to protect ducks from predators, but it doesn't have to be. Provide a container of water that the duck can easily get in/out of, like a kiddy pool. Also, make sure you have baby duck food for ducklings, and adult scratch when it is an adult. Whenever you are home, you can leave the duck out and if you have it imprint on you, it will follow you EVERYWHERE while it is a baby. Just spend a lot of time with it and encourage it to follow, and encourage boundaries much in the same way you would a dog. Just make sure it's in its pen whenever you're gone or are asleep so that predators don't get at it. Any other questions about it, just email me: faithbyrd@hotmail.com

x8Vgu6acaa	Since everyone has a different interpretation of the names of cuts.  The best thing to do is to print the photo and take it with you to the groomers.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	That's isn't a haircut. Those are yorkie puppies that haven't have any hair removed.  Sorry but you aren't going to be able to that clip done to your dog.<br>  <br>  Most yorkie either get a teddy bear clip & if they have prick ears - a westie head or they get a westie clip. Depending on their ears if dropped for are several different options - leaving long, trimming around the ear or tipping the ear like prick. Your groomer can get you different options based on what your dog looks like & what needs to be downplayed & highlighted.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Yep, that's a "puppy cut".<br>  <br>  And yes, please DO keep that cut on your adult Yorkie.  Unless you're showing your dog in conformation (where the long hair is required), there's no reason not to keep it shorter.<br>  <br>  Wayyyy cuter anyway, I think.|`|IqtN47Puaa	My groomer called it the "Puppy Cut"....short all over but longer around face....but not real long.  She wore it all her 14 years, looks great always!|`|EWXzNyk8aa	Here is the breed standard:<br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/yorkshire_terrier/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/yorkshire_terr...</a>|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Those are puppies and they probably haven't even been groomed yet.|`|fzV0R8HSaa	I have a Yorkie as you can tell by my name.  I keep her cut very short because the "breed standard" is very difficult to maintain and can be uncomfortable for the dog.  The cut in your picture is a puppy cut but cannot always be achieved on an adult because the hair texture changes as the dog ages.  Yorkies are usually born with some degree of curl or wave to their fur but the texture can change in time.  Some Yorkies do maintain a slight wave or curl but most are straight which is how the "breed standard" style is maintained.<br>  <br>  My groomer is unable to achieve this look on my dog because her hair is straight and silky.  I get a similar look but without the waves.  To achieve this exact cut your Yorkie's hair would need to have some curl or wave to the texture.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Many different hair cuts out there (and names).<br>  But the one you are referring to is DEF a puppy cut :)
nXxaAH0baa	try using regular people nail clippers..no noise,no freaking out....with the medicine,I'm not sure how solid it is if it's 'gooey'.You may be able to squeeze it into a pill pocket and that way it would be like a treat for your cat.Other than that,I can't really think of anything else you can do.|`|vR4oTlKAaa	I would do this if I were you it works for me. #1 Try crushing up the meds and putting it in some canned cat food. If its a capsule open it up and empty it into the food and mix it good. #2 crush it or empty it into some cheese whiz and feed it to them like that but try an see if they like cheese first. #3 See if they like peanut butter and if so crush or pour it into about a teaspoon of peanut butter and feed it to em like that. I hope these help you to get your kitty to take his meds good luck....|`|kunAa0Nmaa	I usually try to mix the medicine into a small portion of canned food they especially like. I've used this for both liquids and pills. Atlhough I had one cat who cleverly licked the food all around the pill and leaving the pill alone. Liquids with a syringe usually go down without too much problem.<br>  <br>  Another way to do pills is to put it back as far in the mouth on top of the tongue as it can go, and tilt the cat's head back. YOu can even temporarily place your hand over the nostrils to force the cat to breath through its mouth, thereby also swallowing the pill.|`|TiAK1629aa	For pills, get your roomie/spouse/friend to hold the cat (in a towel is fine) tilt the cat's head straight back, drop the pill as far back in their mouth as you can, then close their mouth and blow a quick puff of air into their nose (obviously not connecting with them physically, just from a few inches away) the puffing action makes them swallow.  Always follow any pill with a few bites of a moist food or treat to make sure it doesn't get stuck.<br>  <br>  For liquids, same process but don't lean the head back.  I find that using a syringe minus the needle instead of a medicene dropper is easier.  I give our cats their meds in sections.  Like if it's a 1ml dosage, I'll give them .5 at a time and let them swallow in between so they don't feel like they are drowning in it.<br>  <br>  Claw clipping....have the partner hold...clip a couple at a time.  When the cat start to struggle, let it go.  Forcing a cat to do anything will only aggravate the situation.  Cats panic when they are trapped or held.  Let them go and calm down and come back to it again later.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	Is it a pill or the syringe? <br>  <br>  Pilling a cat is always hard, and the blanket wrapping is a good way to do it. They'll spit it out if you don't tilt their head back.<br>  <br>  If it's a syringe, you can have one of you hold the cat, and the other gently squeeze the medicine into his mouth from the front. If he spits it out, you'll need to gently force it into his mouth from the side.<br>  <br>  Giving cats medicine is never fun; remember when you were a kid and you had to take cherry tylenol? Not cool.<br>  <br>  He'll be ok, he won't hate you. They get over it fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  P.S. - Clippers hurt them. It squeezes a nerve inside of the nail and can sometimes bleed. It's very unpleasant. I would recommend a filer like the pedi-paws, a drimmel or have it done by your vet.|`|zW5OWgXtaa	When your trimming his nails try sitting on a step and hold your cat, with your cats back on your legs. ANd then hold his paw, and for the medicine, sit on his with his back on the ground and have the medicine on your finger tip and hold his mouth open. Or you can try buying thoes moist treats and wrap the midicine in it.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	With liquid medication i usually wrap them tightly in a towel or blanket making sure their paws are under the towel to prevent scratching you. Liquid meds are easier if you actually shoot them in the side of their mouth. Once it is in quickly massage his throat to make it go down a little easier. Also if they get really bad blow in his face lightly and this will often distract them from whats happening. Also ask your vet for a spare syringe as squiting some water into his mouth after will flush away any bad tastes.<br>  <br>  Do his nails the same sort of way, wrap him in a towel only exposing one leg at a time. Have someone there with you to either clip of hold him.If you get the "Quick" cut you can rub some moist soap of some cooking flour on the nail and it will stop the bleeding.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds bad but you can also scruff their necks, tis does not hurt them and they will often behave better for you as their mothers carried them this way after birth.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	LOL, sorry your misery reminded me of the time we had to medicate one of our cats and it was a three people three ring circus. What has to be done has to be done, so the best approach we were able to figure out was to do it as quickly as possible, and then offer a lot of petting, treats and comforts.  My husband had to use long leather work gloves to hold Casper, I would open his mouth and use oral medicine syringe to squirt it in deep down his throat.  Then I would hold up his head and hold his mouth closed until he swallowed.|`|InM3f9Kzaa	Cat's are very strange sometimes, I have an article I found that should offer some good advise for you with your cat.

Some rats who have suffered trauma at the hands of humans will view us as threats, just as a snake or cat is a threat. Rats who have had positive experiences, I think, don't really think of us as anything. They just feel positively toward us. We're not their "moms," they don't suckle from us or anything. I don't think they're consciously aware that we're "weird" and "non-furry." I think we're just positive. We're sources of food, warmth, fun and safety. We're buddies, I guess.

zW5OWgXtaa	Take the cat to the vet.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The washing powder was not a good idea. When an animal eats something like a rubber band or paper clip, the best thing is to feed them a lot of food like oatmeal, rice with fish broth, or any cereal grain that creates bulk. That way the solid part of what they ingested can pass along the digestive tract better. The cat's stress level is your guide. Keep kitty in for a few days until U can see what is coming out.

If the cat starts being a picky eater the it is time for the vet.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Take it to the vet it shouldnt be that big of a deal though if it was a small stone.

V5DON3XGaa	perhaps start slapping him harder so that he will get the message|`|iVQULHqYaa	Your dog loves you and he wants  to be with you. Let him go upstairs with you, its not a big deal.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i gave up lol, i put a baby gate there to stop him|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	With my dog I stayed at the top of the stairs out of sight, and as soon as he put a foot on the stairs I would pop out and shout no (kept me up 2 nights!).  That worked for while we were in the house and awake, but if your dog is anything like mine he will figure out that he can do what he wants when you are asleep/out.  In the end I got him a Multivet Virtual Barrier.  There is a disk that you put wherever you want and set a range of 1-3 metres, and a collar that the dog wears which will give a warning beep if they go near the restricted area followed by a spray of citronella under the chin if they do not back away.  My dog already knew he was in the wrong, it just let him know that he had to obey the rules at all times.  He gave up after the second attempt and has not tried coming upstairs since then, even after I took the collar off.  I prefer this method to child gates as;<br>  1, He already ripped one out of the wall<br>  2, He may need to go up there (fire, burglars etc) and could reach us / safety if necessary.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You slap him on the nose for following you up the stairs? wow, thats a bit harsh.

A baby gate.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Use a gate. We do and it works every time!|`|EWXzNyk8aa	Slapping and yelling at him will not do anything positive in the training. Get him some really good treats and only reward him when he stays of the stairs. Start walking up a few stairs, turn around walk back down. If he stayed off the stairs reward him with a treat and lots of praise. Repeat and gradually get to the top off the stairs. After he masters that put time inbetween you going up and coming back down. This is going to take time, but if you are consistant and always praise him when he stays off the stairs he will understand what you want from him quicker.|`|GEeaONhGaa	I am going to echo what almost everyone else has said, firstly stop slapping him it is cruel! second get a gate or train him to stay, but like others have said he just wants to be with you so it will take time.|`|IqtN47Puaa	At this point, the fact you don't want a Baby Gate doesn't matter.

You need to let them know when they have done wrong but make sure to let them know when they have done right.  You may have to put up a gate just for them to learn and then be able to take it down when they are trained.  I would also work on your stay command in other places than the house, it will help the dog to know when they can go or not.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	Ok well, I know you said you didn't want a stair-gate but with both our dogs, when they where puppies, we didn't want them upstairs so to start with we used a stair-gate, when they where down stairs praise them and give them attention when you go upstairs say 'stay'. Soon you may be able to take the safety gate off and if you do, and the dog still comes up stairs then just take him by the collar walk him downstairs and say 'stay' but nothing more. <br>  Some dogs learn quicker than others so it could take time or it could be quick, good luck x|`|vouUQQzBaa	Slapping (or yelling) won't help. A firm NO will do.<br>  You can't really have an "instant gratification" solution, meaning if you're not willing to invest on a stairgate, then you need to train.<br>  <br>  To train (and this won't be 1,2,3 deal), you'll simply need to stay on the stairway and everytime he tries to take a step up, you firmly say NO.<br>  <br>  When saying NO, tell him to STAY. Reward him with treat, praise praise praise when he does.<br>  Keep moving up the stairs slowly and repeat.<br>  <br>  Dogs need routine and you need to be repetitive.  <br>  <br>  Training is time consuming and he certainly won't learn in a day, if you cannot train him yourself or don't know how, consider enrolling in an obedience course<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|J8ZhFkCzaa	I would put up a baby gate.

I suppose you are...<br>  <br>  First off, have you ever owned dogs before? Any breed that fits those descriptions are two VERY different dogs that need VERY different types of handling, training, and care. <br>  <br>  If you've never handled or owned a dog before then you may want to reconsider getting a "guard" type dog and just stick with the family pet until you become more experienced. <br>  <br>  Plus, two totally different breeds with totally different needs all at once? Might be a bit much to handle for a first time dog owner. You'll be all over the place with different training methods and exercise requirements.<br>  <br>  Second, puppies grow up into adult dogs. They do not stay THAT adorable forever. They mature and lose that cute puppy look. If you want small check out the "toy" group on the AKC web page.<br>  <br>  Third, even the breeds well known for guarding work don't miraculously know how to properly and safely guard a person or home. Heck, very few dogs have the proper instincts, temperament, etc to do so! Professional trainers nit pick dogs from different litters, and not all dogs of one litter will qualify. <br>  <br>  Yes they have natural territorial instincts, but if they aren't properly trained those instincts can turn into plain old aggression - and by properly trained i mean by a professional in the field, not home trained.<br>  <br>  Figure out what you want in a dog before you even begin looking. What can you handle: think about grooming needs, exercise needs, training needs, temperament, etc. Then find a dog that matches those specifications and hire a good trainer to start obedience work.<br>  <br>  If, at a later date, you want to train your dog as a personal protection dog or guard dog (this is after a couple of years of regular training) then get in contact with your local trainer and enquire about Schutzhund training. A professional will examine your dog (and you) to see if either are acceptable for the training.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Cutest small dog: Toss up, Bichon Frise or Yorkie Terrier...(tho I like the Brussels  Griffon also)<br>  <br>  Best Guard dog there is:  South African Boerboel. ---maybe too big and powerful for you though...<br>  <br>  2nd best guard dog: Dogo Argentinos.

They get along with other dogs as long as they have been properly socialized, but will usually not tolerate another dog trying to assert dominance over them and might not coexist peacefully with another dominant breed of dog|`|KsaaEZqHaa	Toy - Border Collie/Springer Spaniel Mix - Reaally Hyper & Fun!<br>  <br>  Guard - Pointer - Is Quite Relaxed But If There's An Intruder/Someone Trying To Hurt/About To Hurt Their Master They Will Go For The Intruder!

It sounds like there were rumors for at least a couple of months before they closed completely.  I wouldn't want to get the vaccines repeated again so quickly either.  I, personally, would delay grooming until the booster is needed rather than getting the vaccines repeated.<br>  <br>  I did find this email address for the owner of the building, but it sounds like he is not a very nice guy, but who knows.  He may have even discontinued it after all the controversy.  Anyway, his name is Larry Cates and the email is larry@centerbay dot com<br>  <br>  You could also try calling the local vets.  There were a lot of vets and techs out of work so maybe some of them have been reemployed by other veterinary offices and know where the records went.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit:  As far as the danger of the vaccines being repeated.  In all likelihood you will not see any immediate problem and if the dog is over 4 months, they will probably only do 2 of the parvo combo vaccines.  The rabies vaccine should be connected to your city license rabies tag and should not need to be repeated, but Utah may do it differently than here.  The problem with repeating or over-vaccinating are the same and you can research over-vaccination and come up with many sites.  It is harmful to the immune system and immune system health concerns may show up at a later date and there are serious ones like cancer, hemolytic anemia, lupus, etc. or just very annoying ones like constant itching and skin problems.

AA12083992	From what you describe the woman was totally at fault.... and of course she will blame the breed!  It would not matter what breed your dog is, many dogs would have been upset with all that yapping, teeth showing and getting startled. Don't worry about one time snapping, with cause. Just be careful, no matter who's fault it really is we all know it is the bully breeds fault. (sarcasm, I live with a bully) Is this vets office familiar with your dog? If so they will not pay attention to her, "He bites." Hang in there, there are a lot of misinformed people.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	The woman is at fault for startling your dog.  On the other hand, in the future you need to be more proactive to protect your dog.  Politely -- always politely -- you need to feel free to ask people to step away from your dog when he is stressed out.  It is your job to protect him from human stupidity.  Next, ask your vet or his assistants to let you wait in another room or outside when the waiting area is crowded or there is an uncontrolled dog in there.  Also you might find it a good idea to take your dogs in one at a time or take a friend with you to help you if the waiting area is often crowded.  You also might consider getting some training on him; most dogs are happier knowing what you want in a stressful situation.  You can check with your vet, a Petsmart, or other people with well-trained dogs for advice on picking a positive reinforcement trainer.  Your confidence would help him relax also.  (p.s. I walk 2 dogs for a friend and strangers always want to come up and pet the cute little dog.  Who bites.  You learn to say no.)|`|QVP8zSuWaa	People can be real idiots around dogs. I had an idiot let her toddler crawl over to one of my dogs. Needless to say I let her have it. One paw could have done damage to a toddler.<br>  Clearly your dog was just have a sensory overload, and saw her as a threat. That could happen to any dog. Next time tell folks that you would prefer that they don't pet your dog without permission.<br>  I always check out the waiting room before I bring the Rotts in.<br>  <br>  To the people here that are blaming the breed.<br>  My 5 pound cat is more apt to tear someone up at the vets office then my Rotts would. My Macaw dang near took of a finger of a vet tech. Should cats and parrots be banned.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I think you should feel bad.  You failed to protect your dog from this woman.  Your dog can't talk, it is YOUR job to tell people who approach uninvited/unannounced that you are not comfortable with them and their yappy little dog being so close.  So what if they come off thinking you have a "vicious pit bull," the important thing is that you keep your dog safe and prevented a bite.  Don't worry about offending the other person...at the end of the day you have to go home and face your dog, not them.  Tell them your dog is mean if that's what it takes to get them to back off.  It also sounds like your pit gets too worked up by strange situations and places for you to be risking the kind of distraction that taking two dogs to the vet brings.  The fact that you say he is "always wicked stressed out there [the vet] and any other weird place," is a clear indicator that your dog was not well socialized and has some issues that need addressing.  He may never be comfortable in strange situations, but you should be working with him to make him more comfortable and less stressed than he currently is.<br>  <br>  You're right, his being a pit bull had nothing to do with this incident.  You had a stressed dog in a stressful situation (LOTS of dogs are perfectly fine everywhere except the vet, where they can behave aggressively due to stress and fear caused by past negative experiences) with a lot of other stress factors.  Yes, that woman should have known better than to approach you and your dogs as your dogs (as well as hers) were clearly agitated and should never have been anywhere near each other.  Yes, that woman should have known better than to approach a dog she didn't know without first asking the owner if it would be ok.  However, that doesn't change the fact that you have a breed that is considered "Dangerous" by the general public and the fact that YOU have to be more responsible because of that bad publicity than you would if you owned a labrador retriever or some other "benign" breed.  It is YOUR job to monitor your dog's environment and prevent a situation like this where a bite is understandable and predictable from occuring in the first place.<br>  <br>  I hate to lecture you, but the fact of the matter is that you own a dog that people are going to assume is dangerous or aggressive.  Because of that very unfair fact your dog has to be better behaved than every other dog out there and you have to be a better owner than other dog owners out there.  It's not fair, but it's the unfortunate fall out of owning a great dog like yours.|`|RBU4RQtnaa	The dog was super stressed and then someone startles him and wonder why he snapped?!  Are you serious?  It's not that out of order that the dog would snap.  Just try to be more careful about letting (stupid) people come near your dog.  I'm sure it's not a reflection on the dog, but more a reflection on the situation.  It you're really worried about it, maybe get a muzzle so that you know nothing will happen if the situation occurs again.  I'd hate to muzzle a dog, but if anything does ever happen the perception will be that your dog is a bad dog because he's a Pit and all that blah blah bs.  My advice is to protect your dog from idiots and keep loving him.|`|WPLKVdBKaa	its not your fault,<br>  your dog was startled,i have 5 smaller breed dogs,one of mine snapped at man who tried to get HIS dog to make friends with mine,<br>  my dog had an operation and was back for a checkup(wearing bandages still)this man could see my dog was stressed,i had sat in a corner away from other folk waiting in the 1st place.i didnt apologize,cos he was at fault.<br>  i make it a rule for me+my kids not approach other peoples dogs unless you ask 1st,just incase the dog maybe stressed or not properly socialized..<br>  and for the record to the other answerer,other breed of dogs have hurt kids,<br>  infact i have taken a family to court cos their 2 dobermans attacked 2 of my kids,and another lady.They broke away from the owner and went on a frenzy,they had already attacked another dog before my kids.<br>  and little dogs can bite just as hard too and be aggressive..|`|p7swtBYzaa	Any dog will react if provoked - any breed.   This woman was an idiot, plain and simple - and your dog was startled and pushed beyond his limits.<br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with his breed, but you know as well as I do that people tend to make an issue out of anything pits do - pits are powerful dogs and when they do something like this it is far more dangeorus than if a little dog does it.   Therein lies the problem - a chi can get away with it and be called "cute" or "protective", your pit will end up euthanized if someone complains.<br>  <br>  Just keep an eye on him when he is in public, never let a situation like this develop again.   If you think you cannot sufficiently watch your pit when he is out of your home, muzzle him.   It may not be necessary, but it will be a fail safe.<br>  <br>  Protect your dog.  Don't blame him for reacting as just about any dog would, but you must protect him because of the breed he is and because people are just waiting to blame him for it.   Don't ever take a chance like this again - either remove him from any situation or muzzle him.<br>  <br>  I have dachshunds, not pits, and I rescue them also.  I have lost track of the times little kids have come up behind my dogs and gone to pet them.<br>  I no longer take any but the 2 who are not bothered by this to public functions.   I also take the time to give lectures to the kids about how to approach a dog they do not know - lessons that their idiot parents should have given them.<br>  It does not matter if your dog never bit before, some clueless idiot coming at the dog and startling it can result in a bite -- then the dog invariably gets blamed for the human's irresponsible stupidity.   Again, protect your dog - keep him from situations like this, there is no other remedy - people can be incredibly stupid - the dog always pays the price of that stupidity.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You need to be more assertive. Tell a moron like that to back off. She invaded your dogs space. Mine would have done the same and they are Dachshunds.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Your dog might have thought the touch it felt was from the dog not the woman.  Your dog was already stressed the little yappy dog added to the stress, and the woman blindly touches your dog. That's a lot of stimuli for one dog. Lots of dogs would've snapped as well.<br>  <br>  Next time at the vet because not all dogs or humans at the vet are well behaved put a muzzle on your dog.  Your dog is a Pit and no matter most will find the dog at fault simply because of his breed. <br>  <br>  Don't lose trust in your dog. You just found 1 of his breaking points, and i believe all dogs have it. Just muzzle him before the next vet visit. and don't let anyone pet him from behind.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	The woman is a complete idiot for trying to pet your little dog, or even get NEAR your dogs without asking you. Even children know better! She got into your dogs space and startled him and in my opinion it's completely her fault. I think if he wanted to bite her he would have. People can be so weird. You shouldn't have been so polite, in my opinion. After all, he didn't even bite her! From now on, you should just try to be more aware of the situation and notice if your dog is stressed to the point that this may happen.<br>  <br>  To the person who said "you will learn from this, you will not get another one" - the only mean pit bull I have met in my entire life was a neighbors dog who was chained up in the back yard and never interacted with from the time it was a puppy. Other than that, I have met more mean, viscous, horrible pomeranians and chihuahuas then any other breed!!!|`|AoSeHXeQaa	In the future, if someone shows up with an out of control dog and gets your dog worked up, you might want to remove him from the situation.<br>  <br>  A lot of people with yappy little dogs do not control them, and then blame the big dog for whatever problem the little dog causes.  <br>  It sounds like she was oblivious to her dogs behavior, and overreacted to yours.<br>  <br>  I have only ever been bitten by a German Shepherd and a chihuahua (the chihuahua did the most damage) :o)<br>  <br>  *****<br>  When I was a teenager, I saw someone brutally mauled by a St. Bernard, for no apparent reason.

NEVER TOUCH A DOG YOU DON'T KNOW...<br>  <br>  3 Years and this dog hasn't had an issue, and then some moron comes and tries to touch him when he's stressed out?  <br>  <br>  Man when I go to the vets and people reach for Jack, I tell them to back off unless they want to lose their hand.  Jack is just like your dog, he won't bite, but if you touch him when stressed and he doesn't see the hand, oh yeah he'll snap as well.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Please do not worry about this (and thanks for actually giving a good account of what happened).<br>  <br>  He was startled. It is a very natural reaction for ALL breeds of dog. He didn't bite her. If a dog wants to bite it will. It was just a warning snap. He was in an already stressful situation and someone made him jump.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do would be not to dwell on it, as dogs can pick up on our anxieties and it could cause him to be on edge in other situations.<br>  <br>  He is NOT a biter so don't think because he snapped once in his whole time with you he will become one.<br>  <br>  I wonder if other answerers would have a different response if it was a Labrador or something.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	It was your fault and not your dog's.  You are going to meet morons like this woman again and it is your job to protect your dog and even the morons from themselves. <br>  #1.  Train your dog to ignore the barking of other dogs.<br>  #2.  If someone gets too close to your dogs or lets their yappy little terror get too close, YOU move.  I know it is not fair but you cannot control other people.  <br>  #3.  When you saw your dog getting worked up you needed to take him out of the situation.<br>  #4  when you saw the woman getting too close you needed to ask her not to touch your dogs.  If she didn't comply, you needed to move.<br>  <br>  You need to always be aware of what is going on around you and protect your dogs.  Yes, this stupid woman startled your dog. but if he had connected, it would have been your dogs death sentence.  <br>  <br>  You could have told the receptionist to call you in from outside and waited there.|`|ead5TBZWaa	You shouldn't feel bad, usually when pits are feirce is when their owner doesn't raise it like they should.It's her fault, she should't come up behind an animal without it noticing.

He was startled. Don't worry about it. It's not because of his breed.|`|34uWa9kHaa	It's not your fault or the dogs.  Regardless of breed.  <br>  One your dog was stressed out.<br>  Two you do NOT approach a dog from behind.  She scared him, he didn't know if it was another dog.   His reaction was to snap as would any other dog when startled. <br>  <br>  Now if he snapped and went to bite her unprovoked I would be singing a different note.    But first rule is never to approach a dog from behind any dog.   <br>  <br>  <br>  She should have known better but that is wishful thinking on my part being a trainer.<br>  <br>  People just do not have a clue.<br>  <br>  <br>  When you are in a situation like that again.  Stand up for your dogs.  Don't be afraid to tell people no don't do that etc.   <br>  <br>  Move to another part of the room or ask the receptionist if there is a room you can go too or tell them you are stepping outside.   <br>  <br>  <br>  Work with your dog on learning to focus on you with all those distractions.   Seek out a behavorist.|`|OOsP9Kopaa	pits are really sweet dogs with a bad rap, my neighbor had one and all he ever seems want out of life is to be a scratch on the head and a game of fetch.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad this lady was either incredibly dumb or looking for an excuse to make trouble. It's first grade common sense not the pet a dog you don't know.<br>  <br>  Next time your at the vet sit against the wall so no one can come up behind you again. <br>  <br>  And don't worry about the vet, I'm pretty sure any one that worked there and witnessed this would see the woman making a bad Choice and not using common sense.<br>  <br>  Give your pit a pat on the head for me.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	It is not his fault, and I certainly would not blame that on the breed.  The woman was an idiot, plan and simple.  You never approach strange dogs, especially at the vets where they are already stressed, and most especially when your dog is only making it worse.   <br>  Where there any of the vet's staff present to see what happened?  You should have explained,  right in front of her, if not.  She has no right to say your dog bites when she is the one to provoke him.  Approaching him period was wrong, but then doing it from behind.  That is why I always keep my dogs close, and force people to ask if they can pet them, not give them a chance to do so without permission, thus hopefully avoiding those situations.  <br>  Sorry to hear about you situation.  Please know it was not your dogs fault, and not his breed, but the idiot person.  However, if you dog is anything like mine, you will need to keep a closer eye on him now, and make sure he is not unnecessarily frightened, to avoid a repeat from occurring.|`|ZKfNo5FWaa	i honestly think its the ladys fault! i mean if you see your dog barking that much get him away! especially if you have a smaller dog! And she should have never just walkd up and started petting your dog, ppl usually ask me if they can pet my dog and hes just a pup. Bottom line she made your dog feel threatend and in my opinion it was a normal reaction of his to snap at her, if she surprised him like that.|`|b0lmWhmMaa	your dog was very worked up & already in a tense situation, which is what led to the snap. that woman with the terrier was acting very irresponsibly.<br>  <br>  while yes most people would immediately just say oh it's a pit that's why, any dog in the same situation would have undoubtedly done that. i'm glad you are standing up for the breed though. people need to realize some situations will make any dog nervous, and therefore act out of that nervousness.<br>  <br>  as long as you maintain control in that situation and Axl knows you are in charge, you can correct him, and maybe those around you can take lessons from you on how to properly handle their dogs.<br>  <br>  well done. :]|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	Not your fault. It was 100% that stupid woman's fault. I am actually a little surprised the vet staff didn't correct her.

My dog would have most likely done a similar thing--it was not random and unprovoked, that woman was a moron!<br>  <br>  Add: To Will S my avatar is my Aussie mix, and she is the dog that is most *likely* to do that to someone. She's very well-behaved, but not so great in strange situations (especially the vet). She's also not the *best* with dogs she doesn't know (mostly on our property).<br>  <br>  ALL breeds of dog are capable of doing harm if they WANT to. And of course, there is that line where they "didn't do it before" and "they have"; however, NO bite is unprovoked. There is ALWAYS an underlying factor--it's recognizing it that counts.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Your dog acted out of instinct however you NEED to curb that instinct.<br>  I'm not referring to the breed I'm referring to your case. Just because it didn't happen before, obviously this is proof it can and did happen now.<br>  <br>  In situations as you have mentioned (which would have annoyed me too if a total stranger came and did that to one of my dogs without permission or even bothering to ask..alas I digress) you will need to muzzle the dog to "prevent" that the next time will not happen.  <br>  <br>  You have a breed that is already frowned upon. Don't give more reasons for others to hate the breed, help prevent!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zFS8rIk4aa	That lady was certainly not acting like a responsible dog owner. Letting her dog go non-stop like that then trying to pet your dog is just irresponsible. <br>  <br>  Have you ever watched the Dog Whisperer (Cesar Milan)? He loves Pit Bulls and sticks up for them, but he really advocates proper dog ownership. Maybe check him out. He will give you a whole new way to see your dog and you will have a better understanding of how your dog sees you and the world.

You should be on a weekly 25% water change with your tank.<br>  <br>  To keep the lime and minerals from forming you should be topping off your tank when you see the level dropping.  If you were on your weekly water change you would not have this problem.<br>  <br>  Simply keep the tank topped off and stick to the weekly water change.<br>  <br>  You really should not be emptying the entire tank to clean it.  Only 25% once per week.  When you empty the entire tank you are subjecting your fish to a new cycle each and every time.  Not good.<br>  <br>  Weekly water changes and top off tank.

The next time you will be prepared, all it needs is a big water change and Albino/Bronze will breed. Main thing is the time it takes the fry to grow.

AA11901352	First off you have a tank that has not cycled completely and introduced fish into this tank.  The beneficial bacteria had not formed and you kept on adding additional fish.<br>  <br>  Did you test your water and what were the readings?  You need to test the water for ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.  If you see the ammonia even as high as .5 you need to do a partial water change to remove this toxic chemical.<br>  <br>  While fancy goldfish do not need 50 gallons of water each a general rule when keeping more than one is a minimum of 5 gallons each.  the filter really doesn't matter.  Goldfish are fine in a heavy current tank as well as the minnows.  Keep the filter it is fine.<br>  <br>  You also want to stick to a weekly 25% water change along with vacing the gravel to remove the bulk waste.  Do not change all the water or you will need to start the cycle all over again.<br>  <br>  To do a water change you need to use the gravel siphone start the siphone and clean the gravel with the waste water going into a bucket.  You may have to work quickly  here.    Do not remove your fish from your tank.  Once you have removed and disgarded the old water, run clean tap water into the bucket with the amount of dechlor for only the water you are replacing.  Pour the water slowly into the tank repeat until the tank has been filled. Don't worry so much about temperature here since goldies are fine when it comes to water temperature differences.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You did not cycle the aquarium, did you?<br>  What size tank?<br>  <br>  Not cycling the aquarium first means that goldfish (Massive waste producers) were added into an environment that had no bacteria to break down their waste. They probably died of ammonia poisoning.<br>  <br>  For the fish you initially bought you needed a 50 gallon aquarium for the goldfish alone. (20 for the first, 10 for every one after)<br>  <br>  ~Tank cycling may take as long as 2-6 weeks. Did you add a source of ammonia to the tank to mimic fish waste?<br>  <a href="http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/fishless-cycle/" rel="nofollow">http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  ~EDIT~ It really depends on whether or not your aquarium is overstocked. For an appropriately stocked aquarium you should be performing weekly partial water changes of about 25%. If it's overstocked multiple weekly water changes are necessary. Use a gravel siphon to vacuum the substrate to remove uneaten food, and waste. Replace with fresh conditioned water of the correct temperature. There is no need to remove the fish from the tank while changing the water.<br>  <br>  ~A powerful filter is necessary for a goldfish tank. They require filtration meant for double the tank size to accommodate their waste output.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	First of all, when you just got your tank, did you "cycled in" your tank? You should not put fish in right away, you need to get the tank settled in with the beneficial bacterias that helps to break down the fish wastes.<br>  <br>  Read the article below, and check other articles from that site, there's also a good forum that discuss various topics.<br>  <br>  I would guess you haven't cycled in your tank, and the really best thing you can do is do small water changes (about 10-20% of the total water) every week, and hopefully you'll have some that will survive. <br>  <br>  Water filters would rarely be powerful enough to stress out the fish, but if you can turn it down a little, go for it but do not try to change out the filters since you're still waiting for the beneficial bacterias to build up.|`|nNGrfHdTaa	Well firstly I would Definatly Get a weaker filter,<br>  Also maybe Ask the vet for Advice,<br>  Or Reasearch The Requirements of these fish,<br>  <br>  Or Are the fish Fighting?<br>  Stealing eachothers food?|`|lpyIKYUXaa	the water in the tank might be infected with a pathogen, you need to thoroughly clean and rinse the tank..<br>  x|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Cycling a tank takes more than 1 week and there is probably high amounts of ammonia and nitrates in the water.<br>  <br>  Do 50 percent water changes every day and get a master test kit to test for ammonia and natrates. Also try to find some Stress Coat for the tank.<br>  <br>  Your fish will die if you do not condition the water before you used it, but this really only pertains to anything other than drinking water.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  To perform a water change you will need to have enough water on hand to fill up what you take out of the tank (say half/50%). It's pretty much just taking the half out and slowly putting it back in so the levels of nitrates and ammonia is cut in half and the water is better for the fish. I'm stuck in the same situation with my cycle. It hasn't finished yet so the water changes are really important.<br>  <br>  Also, if your tank is overstocked, do not take the fish out because this will stress them too much. Just take the water out and put it back in with out causing currents in the water.|`|VKTRAEbWaa	My friend has just got new fish- all his have died in the past week - do they have scales falling off because that is something to do with bacterium in the water.<br>  A doubt a less powerful filter will make a difference.

4hFT5JcLaa	I used to breed guinea pigs, and they make fantastic pets! You are right about them not having a natural odor. If you keep the cage clean, there is nothing to cause a smell. I know this to be true as I had about twelve guinea pigs in my bedroom at one time, and there was no odor.<br>  <br>  That being said, there are certain bedding types that control odor better than others. My personal favorite is a product called Cell-Sorb. It's economic (made from recycled paper products), biodegradable (most litters are, though), very absorbent, and great with controlling odors. It lasts much longer than shavings, but shavings are fine too. Just make sure you NEVER use cedar shavings, as they can cause respiratory infections and make your guinea pig very sick or even kill it.<br>  <br>  Try doing some research on guinea pigs and bring up the new-found information to your mother. For instance, did you know that guinea pigs are prone to colds? The best ways to prevent them are to keep your piggy's cage away from AC vents and windows, warm and dry in the winter, and give them a vitamin supplement with their food. Alternative to the vitamin supplement, you can give them baby carrots, broccoli, spinach leaves, and a lot more. I even had some that loved strawberries!<br>  <br>  Let her know that guinea pigs are very intelligent little animals. I had one named Hershey who learned how to climb up two flights of stairs, run down the hallway into my room, and climb into her cage all by herself. I also conducted a science experiment with them when I was in junior high to see how long it took them to learn how to pull a pin out of a tube in order to make a baby carrot fall out of it. They learned rather quickly!<br>  <br>  Let her know that it's not uncommon for parents to feel a bit unsure when graduating from gerbils and hamsters up to guinea pigs, since they are bigger, but they are MUCH less likely to bite than a hamster is (especially a dwarf), and that they tend to be great companions. My father was very angry when I brought home my first guinea pig after the death of a hamster, but within weeks, he was asking to hold Gordy so they could watch the football game together. He would feed him a baby carrot while they watched, and Gordy loved it.<br>  <br>  Another interesting fun fact is that guinea pigs will actually purr. Not exactly like a cat and not for as long, but it's adorable.<br>  <br>  Just study up on your stuff, and show her that you will be responsible, and that this pet will bring you 5 or 6 years of happiness and love.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fi85yw8Kaa	I am in the same situation as you. I have also had 2 gerbils and a dwarf hamster! And my mom doesn't want me to have a guinea pig even though I know every thing about them and I would take full responsibility.<br>  <br>  Try making a deal with her like i will get good grades this semester, i will get 100% on this test, etc...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7fBJydCtaa	yes if u clean the cage every week or so it <br>  should not smell.|`|adPO2SVraa	Yes, I think it's a great idea, and no, guinea pigs are not smelly, they are actually very clean. They are very easy to take care of. <br>  They are social animals and should be kept with another guinea pig, or you will havto provide more attention if you are only getting one. <br>  But besides all that, they are great, go for it!|`|q0rLBQo2aa	WHY are they "all gone now"? Did they live a full and natural lifespan, or....? <br>  If you've had small mammal pets, a guinea pig will be disappointing. They have no natural predators in their high Andean home, so they're fat and incredibly stupid. If you think they're cute, get a plush stuffed one. That eliminates the cage cleaning, and it will be about as alert and loving. Those who say their guinea pigs love them are mistaking torpid tolerance for affection. If it doesn't bite or struggle to get away, it may not love your fond embrace. Probably it's just too dumb to care.<br>  <br>  I hope you're not the "cheap disposable pet" type. Choosing a cheap and easy pet is like choosing a cheap and easy sex partner. Both choices show a lack of commitment and respect. At least a prostitute can refuse -- a pet cannot. Animals are not toys. They have no right to humane treatment because they are not human. BUT you have an obligation not to be cruel or neglectful, because as a human being you know better and have a moral duty to act in accordance with that knowledge. That's why it's called "humane" treatment. If you're not humane, you're not fully human.
uBFhKXgHaa	Has she seen a vet to rule out health related issues that could be causing her obesity? If not, I'd recommend that first and foremost. As for getting her to lose weight otherwise...<br>  <br>  You're going to want to put your cat on a high quality wet/canned food. Wet food has far less carbohydrates in it than dry so it makes weight loss easier, plus it's healthier for cats anyway.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Make sure the food is a high quality one. A high quality cat food also won't have as many carbohydrates and grains in it.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  You could even go entirely grain free. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  If you're freefeeding... STOP. This is the fast lane to feline obesity. Read the feeding guidelines on your cat's food and feed accordingly. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you want to keep your cat active. Get your cat engaged in games and playtime!<br>  <br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|AA10356572	there is NO reason a 9 month old kitten should be fat.. have you taken to be checked by a vet for other problems - like worms???<br>  <br>  what food is she on??<br>  sometimes the QUALITY of the food is more important than the QUANTITY..<br>  read this link to easily determine if the problem is one of your foods ingredients<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1344790-how-do-i-know-if-a-cat-food-is-good-or-bad" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/1344790-how-...</a> <br>  <br>  if you limit a cats intake - they usually want to eat more<br>  they should have free choice of DRY food - and only 1 teaspoon of canned a day - NEVER NEVER canned with gravey - read the link|`|fIsjIMZHaa	Try switching to a higher quality food first of all.

6cRj7pMSaa	Pink spots could be a number of things, including flea bites and ring worms. The only way you will know for sure is if you take her to the vet.     To get her to not sleep on your bed, I recommend crate training her. Put her bed inside the crate and keep the crate in your room. She will get the idea. Pretty soon, you will be able to leave the crate open and she will choose to sleep there. Crate training is good for the dog because it gives them a definite safe, secure place where they know they are allowed. If you just continue letting her be free in your room at night, she will continue getting on your bed. She doesn't understand that you don't want her up there. The only way you can scold her for being up there is if you catch her jumping up there.    ADD: Claire, ring worm, if left untreated, can kill a dog or cat, or any other small animal. I have seen cats in shelters and vets offices that have had to be put down for ringworm. And yes, people get ringworms too, but they have to be treated or they spread. Please don't give someone information that could lead to the death of their pet. If you don't know what you are talking about, PLEASE don't Comment. You could give someone information that they take and it can kill their animals.|`|VA0AdKKCaa	put the pet bed behind a little fence that you can put in the corner.. every night for a week or so put her begind the fence and she should go to sleep and eventually realize that, that is her rightful sleeping place.  and the spots can be allergies or maybe even ringworm.. dogs CAN get it.  Hope This Helps! :D|`|d4KI4Ur5aa	i duno about worms    if u wear her out all day, with walks and playing then close your door at night so she cant come in|`|n1SKfcTVaa	Reprimand Her EVERY time your dog gets on the bed. If its ring worm it not Harmful. People Get Ring worm Every day and are OK. - Claire.|`|Nhqzm3Draa	Can you confine her to small area in the room, with her bed, or put up a child-safe gate in your doorway? Put her bed just on the other side, so she can see you, but not get into the room. After a couple of nights, she will sleep on her own, and still feel safe. You could try rubbing the spots with alcohol, to see if that helps. If it does, it most likely is a flea bite. If alcohol and/or Benadryl don't work, take her to the vet asap.|`|cS4zSBGWaa	put da dog outside animals shouldn't come in the house they can bring germs outside into ur hme|`|8e2LdDAdaa	Kennel train her, it will make your life easy, the first few nights aren't so fun, but later it will become her safe place and that way you don't have to deal with all the messed a puppy makes while playing with your favorite pair of slippers. The spots need to be checked out though. See if you can find a free clinic in your area, i have one in mine but i know they are rare. And are the pink spots skin or a rash? some dogs have multicolored skin. Its common in huskies and chow chows and I'm sure many other breeds. Good luck with her.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	If you can not afford a crate at this time, we used a old children's wooden playpen for nights when she was young, so perhaps there is an old one that somebody does not use anymore.    The pink spots (are they raised)  could be Hives due to an allergy, you can clear it up with Benadryl.   However, it may be a skin infection of some kind, Dogs with skin infections that are left untreated quite often develop secondary skin problems.    Ringworms are flat, roundish, and causes hair loss.  (are they flat or raised?)  Fleas can also leave read splotches when they are bitten, so check her over for fleas and treat her if she has any.  So, check out the spots and keep your eye on them, if they are raised, they are not ringworm, then try the Benedryl, if flat then take to the vet when you can, and wash often, it is transmittable.  If after treating with Benedryl and nothing changes after 24 hours, take to the vet as soon as you can.    Hope this helps.

7dUYhr3Vaa	 A diferencia de nosotros, nuestros PERROS  experimentan efectos peligrosos al comer chocolate ya que estos pueden envenenarlos y en algunos casos llevarlos a la muerte. El peligro del chocolate para perros depende de su cantidad y calidad. Los perros grandes pueden generalmente pueden comer una peque?a cantidad del chocolate mientras que la misma cantidad podra causar problemas a uno de menor tama?o.     El chocolate es tratado de las semillas amargas del rbol de cacao, que contienen una serie de compuestos conocidos como methylxanthines. Esta clase de sustancias incluye cafena y sustancias qumicas relacionadas a theobromine. Estas sustancias pueden conducir a vmitos o diarrea en perros, y euforia en la gente. El chocolate contiene una cantidad significativa de theobromine y cantidades ms peque?as de la cafena. Si una cantidad grande de theobromine o cafena es ingerida, algunos perros experimentarn temblores de msculo o hasta asimientos. Estos componentes qumicos del chocolate pueden hacer que el corazn de un perro lata hasta dos veces de lo normal, y algunos casos los perros pueden correr alrededor como si mismos tras su cola en una forma desesperada.     Los perros son capaces de comer un poco de chocolate, pero esto depende del peso del animal y el tipo del chocolate que este come. El chocolate de coccin no endulzado contiene ms de seis veces de theobromine que el chocolate con leche.     Los perros que comen una peque?a cantidad del chocolate deberan ser capaces de filtrar el methylxanthines por su cuerpo y evitar el tratamiento veterinario, pero se dan cada vez mas los caso de perros envenenados por el chocolate, y estos deben ser tratados induciendolos a vmitos y administracin de carbn de le?a que absorve cualquier methylxanthines que permanece en la tripa o cualquier parte del sistema digestivo del perro.     Ya sabes, no todo lo que es bueno para nosotros lo es tambien para nuestras mascotas. He visto muchas ocasiones que las personas comparten lo que comen con sus perros, no sabiendo las graves consecuencias que esto puede ocasionar. A estar mas atentos a estos detalles, despues de todo de esto depende la vida de nuestros cachorros.  |`|ZhNJHsApaa	El chocolate en los perros puede producir un cuadro clnico llamado anemia, si realmente quieres a tu perro no se lo des. ceguera no les produce. tambien debes evitar el consummo de cebollas, coles, y algunas verduras como la lechuga. las papas tampoco son recomendables y el pan les hace realmente mal.

Si decides darle huesos naturales, han de ser grandes, de res o cerdo, pero nunca de pollo, ya que se quiebran con mucha facilidad.   Chocolate: El chocolate contiene teobromina, que suministrado en grandes cantidades es muy txico para los perros. Un perro que tome chocolate presentar sintomas parecidos al envenenamiento: vmitos, temblores, diarrea....   Cuidado con las sobras: Es muy comn alimentar a nuestra mascota con los restos de la comida, sin embargo esta prctica puede ocasionar trastornos alimenticios graves. Los alimentos comerciales son una fuente completa de nutrientes, el aporte extra que el perro recibe con los restros de la comida NO le beneficia. Ten especial cuidado si las sobras contienen alimentos picantes como el chile.   Cebolla: La cebolla cruda en grandes cantidades (unos 50 gr) es txica para los perros. Sin embargo no resulta da?ina si est cocida o se da en peque?as dosis.   |`|y2kk2fcUaa	hola! si, lo habia oido, pero no es el chocolate, es el azucar, y tambien a los gatos.    un saludo!!!

Procure criadores srios e responsveis. Vc perceber qu?o gratificante  dar amor e SER CORRESPONDIDO por esses pssaros. Por serem criados por criadores, eles ser?o mais resistentes, e te trar alegrias. Boa sorte.|`|RNAKJ2ZJaa	Bem-te-vis dificilmente viveriam presos amiga.|`|1IxGUr0Daa	po tambem ja passei por isso =/   agente se sente como mae dele =(  acontece   Mais nao adianta  a vida,eles sao muito frageis  precisam da mae nao adianta    melhoras :)|`|KDswTY7Saa	????????|`|zpdecXCOaa	Putz|`|DBT9FNvZaa	Poxa colega, que chato, eu venho acompanhado suas perguntas aqui, e sei que voc fez tudo o que pode para salva-lo, foi uma morte muito repentina, provavelmente ele deveria ter alguma doen?a encubada, meus psames, n?o de bola pra essas crian?as que vem aqui no yahoo s para se divertir e dar respostas inteis.
