n7hezV5aaa	It's exactly the same. Apparently Saga is a more fancy term and it's a clever marketing tool. It's not a matter of which one is correct or not. You could use either one and you'd be right even though Meyer refers to it as the Twilight Saga.|`|CblODn2Kaa	Series is the correct word for Twilight.  Saga-  1.  Norse literary genre: an epic tale in Old Norse literature, usually in prose, recounting events in the lives of historical and mythological figures from medieval Iceland and Norway.    Obviously not Twilight.    2.  long novel or series of novels: a long story or novel, or a series of stories or novels, often following the lives of a family or community over several generations      I know they have stories about the Cullens in them, but they're about Bella.    3.  series of events: a complicated series of events or personal experiences stretching over a considerable period of time, or a detailed account of such a series of events or experiences (informal)     Twilight isn't complicated, and since this is the informal use of the word saga, using it for Twilight is incorrect.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	The one correct for twilight is series. Tape in youtube: why twilight is not a saga, it has all of the definitions of the world saga.|`|P4RZK3dyaa	I think a saga is generally shorter than a series, but longer than a trilogy. The longest saga I've ever heard of is the Darren Shan saga (13), and the longest series' I've ever heard of last for more than 50 books. I'm pretty sure Twilight is a saga, because thats what it is called on the backs of the books.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	A trilogy is three books, a series can have a ton of books-I don't think there's a limit and a saga is an "epic tale." Here's the actual definition:    http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...|`|CKaguaZmaa	Series and Saga are not the same things  Saga.Definition 2 is the one most widely used.  1. A medieval icelandic or norse prose narrative of achievements and events in the history of personage,family,...etc  ~~2. Any narrative or legends of heroic exploits.~~  3. Also called a saga novel. a form of a novel or generations of a family or social group are chronicled in a long and leisurely narrative.    Series has a lot of definitions,but the forth fits best.  4. A set of successive or issues of a periodical published or like form with similarity of subject or purpose.    Since twilight doesn't have any heroic exploits.(heroic means slaying a Dragon,not saving bella. Since twilight doesn't span generations (see Stars Wars), is not a saga it is a series.

In Pheonix, the boys there didn't think she was pretty. In Forks, the boys there think she is pretty. Thats only 1 example. Some people don't even think he is hot (me including) and think she would be better off with Twilight. I like twilight because i like how it has action and romance together.    I hope this helps!|`|CKaguaZmaa	yes i would still like the book because edward is not that cute plus it is a book about bella a girl from arizona who come to live with her dad charlie in forks. she meets this boy/vampire named edward then that is where things start picking up . from there her and edward start to talk more,have there first kiss,and he even starts staying over house. from there bela meets edwards family and then takes her to this game where she meets these two bad vampires named james and victoria. I've heard that in the fourth book bella and edward get married and have a baby . and the baby is eating her alive but she doesn't want edwards father who is a surgeon to take it out because she feels it part of her and edward and if she kills the baby bella feels that it would take away part of her and edward|`|lk03YYPEaa	I doubt anyone would read it. 70 percent of the entire series is Bella gushing about how hot Edward is, and his "crooked smile", and his "topaz eyes", and so on and so forth. Everything from Twilight to Breaking Dawn could be condensed into a 150-page book without the constant Edward-descriptions. :p|`|0pljAxVpaa	yes i would still love him because it isn't just his looks that i love about him i love his personality.|`|CblODn2Kaa	Well, if Edward wasn't hot, the books would be about ten pages each.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	I think it's kind of obvious, if they love it because of Eddie's beauty and its descriptions why would they love it without that?|`|n7hezV5aaa	The book is from Bella's perspective, who is totally drooling over him, so it's obvious that the reader is affected by this. If Edward was ugly then I guess I'd still love the book. I didn't read 4 books for a fictional guy's attractiveness...LOL

zOjkgNvVaa	This isn't typically romantic, but it dances along those lines:    "Black Butterfly" by Triin Kann    Sitting lonely in a white padded room   The silence is too loud and too cruel   I'm cold, and alone, but they don't care   On the road they left me somewhere     But I ended up sitting here barefoot   With an evil smile and a wicked look   I can hear her coming through the air   Just last night we played truth or dare     But she didn't really talk that much   And she never lets me gently touch   Her dark little broken velvet wings   When she comes, the angels sing     She's my only friend through the days   But every evening she flies away   She brings darkness to this room   Sometimes she whisper's that I'm doomed     She makes me think I'm losing my mind   Searching for peace I know I can't find   Her wings are broken, she wants to break mine   Without her here I feel perfectly fine     I feel her presence, I know she's already here   She plays on the strings of my mind and fears   She's circling around me, and looking at me   She knows exactly what I think or feel     Room's filled with loud silence and bright darkness   She knows she's making me become a real mess   She fills my mind with doubt and fear   And whispers insanity in both of my ears     Once I thought butterflies are sweet and free   But this one here is bad, and meant to torture me   I hide my scars, my cuts and bruises   In this game there's no room for losers     I know I could just catch and kill her   But then a part of me would start to hurt   Sure I'm sober, and I know I'm still sane   I'd like to watch her burn with a bright flame     I was told I have to walk my road alone   But for some reason she always comes along   On her broken wings at night she flies away   But for now my 'friend' black butterfly will stay     I know in my heart that one day I will grow strong   Then she can't hurt me like she's done for so long   On that day I will hear my black butterfly cry   And then watch when she slowly dies|`|hd2uNljsaa	The Song of Solomon (in the Bible) is believed to be an allegory.

AA10015648	Your ideas lack conflict and story.    Idea 1: What's the conflict? You've described the world that people now live in, but there are no characters living in this world, or anything exciting happening during the arctic exploration. You've essentially described the movie Water World. Your story needs a beginning, middle and end... a character, something the character wants or doesn't want, and the character acting to get what they want or prevent what they don't want.    Idea 2: You need a reason for this practice if the story is going to be believed. Hunger Wars had a similar story, but the rationale behind setting kids against each other is believable. It's extremely inhumane behavior, and it must have a solid reasoning behind it.    Idea 3: Again, you've got a setup of the world, without any kind of character or conflict. What's the goal of your main character? To survive? That's a very dull goal. To fix the blocked sun? How would your character be in the position to do that, and what's been stopping him from taking action in the past 2 years? Maybe your character is trying to become a world leader during this time of world conflict - assembling an army and attacking while people are weak, so that when the sun returns, he is the one in charge.    You've got idea fragments, but they need to be fleshed out before they can even start looking like a story.

Jx1GDVF7aa	Some things to check;  Were you fingering the register key? (Left thumb over hole and the long key above it)    Are any springs missing or not attached correctly?    Are any pads obviously missing? (you need to look at each pad individually)      Some stuff you should know;    B & C in the middle of the staff are the hardest notes to get to speak on the clarinet (all clarinets-bass, alto,....) because they are right at "THE BREAK". these are the first notes you play with the register key depressed. these notes are stuffy and take practice to master on any clarinet. Try adjusting your embouchure, air speed, how much mouthpiece you take in, air support,       If after the visual inspection you find nothing obviously out of place, try playing and making adjustments to your playing, the problem may be that you are just not accustomed to playing bass clarinet.
C77c0OE2aa	Ummm... as the others said... no... you cannot use the camera without a lens. Excuse me for being blunt, but if you do not even know this, you really have no business buying such an item. You will not have a clue how to use it and / or will only put it in AUTO. You might as well have a cheap point and shoot if you do that.    I suggest you learn about photography before you spend money on a DSLR. You will be starting off WAY over your head if you get the camera now, unless you are really serious and take the time to study and practice and study and practice and study and practice... a LOT.    steve|`|LVpyaf48aa	no. the L in SLR is for LENS. a 350d will not take pics without one.|`|Esuxelwlaa	Nope.  At least a basic lens is required for the camera to work at all.  Talk to the folks at the store you're buying the camera from about what sorts of pictures you want to take and they should be able to show you a selection of lenses to fit your needs.|`|7uFGLKvYaa	simply no. you need a lens to get a picture unless it's a pinhole camera|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I have to agree with Steve.  It sounds like you really don't have any experience at all with using a camera or basic photography...but you're rushing out to buy a very expensive digital SLR camera?    (or maybe your parents are buying it FOR you?)    You're not going to have the slightest idea how to use it, and you're probably just going to get frustrated and end up wasting your money.  An SLR camera (Single Lens Reflex) is a camera that has completely manual focus and exposure control, and it is intended for more advanced users.  They do have auto exposure, but most people don't use it and prefer to use manual exposure because you can have a lot more control and creativity with your pictures.    If you're just going to put the camera in "auto" mode and take snapshots, then you're really defeating the purpose of getting a DSLR camera.  Just save your money and buy a cheap point and shoot camera to play with.    I honestly don't think you're ready for a DSLR camera (or any manual camera for that matter).  Not if you thought that a camera could take pictures without a lens.  I'm not trying to be mean or sarcastic...you really just aren't ready for a camera like that.    Save yourself a lot of time, money, and frustration and study some more about basic photography before you run out and buy a $500 camera.
u5nYlVMxaa	The play was set in the 1920s I think but I can't be sure.<br>  <br>  The family were middle class.<br>  <br>  They were not massively wealthy but they lived quite comfortably.<br>  <br>  I hated this play, it was so tedious when I saw it in the theatre.<br>  <br>  I hope you're enjoying it more than me.<br>  <br>  :)|`|hwvQy100aa	The play is set in St. Louis in 1937.  The characters as written are what would have been described as lower middle-class at the time.  The apartment is described as a tenement, with Tom sleeping on the couch.  The setting is meant to convey cramped quarters, with the characters living on top of each other.  They do indeed 'struggle' as the father has long since 'fell in love with long distance' and abandoned the family quite some time ago.  Amanda, the mother, works at selling subscriptions over the telephone, and Tom works in a factory, longing to escape his overbearing mother and their situation.  It is generally agreed that the play is largely autobiographical.  The fragility of Laura, and the fact that she is 'crippled' is inspired by Tennessee's sister Rose, who was a schizophrenic and, at her mother's behest, had one of the first lobotomies ever performed in the country.  Tom is Tennessee and Amanda, his mother.  Hope that helps some.|`|5wDSSzaVaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Menagerie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_M...</a><br>  <br>  Since the play is a "memory" play, meaning it is based on one character's recollection of events, I'm not sure where it's exactly set. For the most part, the setting should be somewhere in the South.<br>  <br>  And the family is what would have been considered "middle-class".

Allow a minimum of ￡1200, but may reach considerably more, depending upon the nature of the award.<br>  <br>  The thing about the Knights cross is that it would only be handed out like the VC or the CMH.  I.E. Outstanding acts of bravery or achievement.<br>  <br>  As such, each medal will have a documented history that will relate to specific actions.<br>  <br>  These medals are important because, unlike any other medal, these would have been presented to the recipient by Adolf Hitler in person.  They will have been handled by Hitler.  This makes it a very desirable piece of history.<br>  <br>  On the back of all German medals will be a small, square stamp.

Very generally speaking, Newton's works were based on practical basis, But Einstein's is on theoretical physics.<br>  <br>  The only reason for it to be Newton is that he was 300 years before Einstein and hence provided the foundation for his works.|`|e0HbdRNMaa	Eintstein's formula is based on mass and energy which would never have been able to be studied without the understanding Newton provided for gravity and motion.|`|cgjbw1jKaa	hmm einstien or newton.... they`re the same i think.They have both contributed to the collective knowledge of our understanding.But we still don`t know whats going on lol|`|hpkOeOLyaa	Newton.|`|WlSelrj5aa	Newton or we would be letting things fall on our head still!

It speaks of musics ability to explain humanity in terms unavailable in language. It speaks of musics ability to enchant even... 'bad' people, uncouth people... people who would be unlikely to appreciate the finer side of life. Music makes everyone blissful.<br>  <br>  There are some sexual overtones, but that is to be expected. Don't draw too much upon them. You could make some comparisons with a description of an orgasm, of you really wanted to.<br>  <br>  It speaks of yearning, and the desperation associated with the fear that love of music may leave us. It asks that this bliss stay with us until the world (or our towers, at least) comes crashing down around us.<br>  <br>  The last line goes back to the sexual, and refers to the music as if a lover.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nice poem.|`|ip8R8bF5aa	It's about music as an escape, a protection against the cruel and rude of the world. just see the definition of rampart.<br>  <br>  1.

TiFDMWoEaa	First, congrats on getting away with your book choice! Too many people write the series off. While it may not be War & Peace, it's still worth a closer look. I've been working on a pop culture unit in my curriculum, and Twilight is one of the novels I've been considering.  <br>  <br>  As far as analyzing your quotes, these seem to be peculiar choices for demonstrating characterization. The quote "You are my life now" *might* work. When a Twilight vampire finds their mate, it literally alters them at a fundamental level and ties them to that person. This line identifies Bella as his mate, announcing that his life has become indelibly linked to hers. In the context of the book, it also acknowledges his acceptance of that fact. <br>  <br>  The second line seems a poor choice to demonstrate characterization, as it merely describes the emotion of the moment. His expression demonstrates revulsion--that's it. You may want to find a quote that has more direct bearing on Edward's character.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your project!|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Well I guess it would be that he has little or no characterization before he meets Bella and he is described as having 'black eyes full of revulsion' showing that he has a lack of characterization.<br>  And that he lacks the feeling of a normal person (black eyes) and that he has shown no real emotion for some time.<br>  <br>  The quote "You are my life now" shows his sudden change in characterization. And the fact that he is changing for her from this cold, empty being into a much more bright character after meeting Bella. This would also further relate that his change for Bella would change his eyes and the way he sees the world.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps|`|v2brrYiLaa	i just want to say that i don't know why TWILIGHT HATERS even are looking at, let alone answering TWILIGHT QUESTIONS.<br>  <br>  I think it shows Edward's love for Bella, even when he may not be in the best mind set( black eyes usually not best. lol.) Also it show their connection and how he cares for her.|`|6qBG1xrsaa	oh god. find a deeper book to do a personal study on. i agree, twilight does make you - and has made me - weak at the knees. But character depth? Not a whole lot of that in Twilight. Read the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, or Vernon God Little. Two of my favourites. Actually, maybe not the second if you're under 15.|`|bLXqYUYWaa	"his black eyes full of revulsion" His eyes were turning her away. revulsion means-  a strong pulling or drawing away <br>  <br>  "you are my life now"- It is simple. she is his life now. he got her into it and now it is his duty to take care of her.|`|7Do7Gvylaa	IN that moment edward is deeply troubled and in fear that he will loose his one true love bella so as she leaves he tells her "you are my life now" He loves her more then anyone could love and his life revaulves around bella he will not let anyhting happen to her but if something would he could not live without her so he would kill himself.|`|XZfdLVu5aa	yeh I'm a Twilight fan but these quotes have nothing to do with characterization :S<br>  Your gonna have to find better quotes if this is the book you wanna do...|`|vX2O4v7haa	you must be the envy of your entire class!!|`|0WKkXIyKaa	well, maybe he's so annoyed that he fell for bella?<br>  <br>  i am guessing that it is edward you are talking about, i've read the books, but it doesn't mean i can remember every single **** quote that is meant to be so moving and emotional but isn't.<br>  <br>  good luck with your characterization study of the characters.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	This is a perfect example of what is wrong with the whole Twilight thing...<br>  <br>  Millions of you love those books to the point of madness and try so hard to convince the rest of us that they are 'great works' (I actually saw someone refer to them as Classics yesterday in here).  But when it comes right down to it, it's just not possible, not with all the enthusiasm in the world, to turn those books into something you can produce a serious piece of school work from.<br>  <br>  I agree with what someone else said, these examples are of how SM failed to develop characterization, not examples of how she did it.|`|GW4fOE8Naa	Honestly, there's not much to analyze here.  'black eyes full of revulsion' is simply Meyer's way of conveying his emotion.  "You are my life now" would actually be a good place to start from a deconstructionist's standpoint, but I don't see how it can help your essay.|`|G4iHDhpvaa	Well his eyes are full of revulsion because he sees Bela as a Demon sent to punish him, and her smell is so intoxicating to him that it is so sweet, it revoltes him.<br>  <br>  Sorry I don't get the other one, Hope I helped anyway x|`|4F8b4D6Laa	These quotes demonstrate lack of characterization, they're not part of its development.<br>  <br>  Edit: I suggest you choose another book (a better one) if you want to make a good work.|`|SHE7SAGWaa	i thin kyou should use another quote besides this one "his black eyes full of revulsion"<br>  and "you are my life now"<br>  thats not a good one either but its just saying he choose her she is apart of him now.

5wDSSzaVaa	If you are considering either Mark or Roger as a main character, then by definition, Mark would be the narrator since for the most part his character gives us the background on other characters as well as catches the audience up when time has passed. So therefore, Roger would be the main character.<br>  <br>  But since Rent is based on the opera La Vie Boheme, all three couples (Roger and Mimi, Collins and Angel, Maureen and Joanne) would be the main characters, or leads. Mark would still be the narrator.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	MARK!!!  I love him... Andyway he starts the show and everyone knows him more.

Mark was made as Jonathan Larson, like Jonathan made Mark as himself. I dont know how much you know about Rent, and the creator, but im a Renthead. Mark is supposed to be the narrirator. He is the main character. Mark is also the one who is sitting back and watching everything that happend with everyone else. With AIDS, love, jobs, and death. He is the outsider, he doesnt have a lover anymore. He is just watching everything. <br>  <br>  MARK!|`|TJ6KPvaJaa	if I had to choose, I'll definitely choose Mark. Even though Roger by definition is the main character, Mark has the play on his palms. Really, Mark is moving the play, so that in my eyes, makes him the main character of RENT.<br>  <br>  Of course, RENT is the story of 8 friends i the course of a year, so yeah, there is no main character on RENT... sorry, had to say it.
y0HeCXd2aa	Here are a couple of standard formulas for pricing your work:<br>  First one: Figure out what you want to get paid per hour- be reasonable, if you are just starting out and you are unknown or your work is not quite polished stay on the lower end of the scale.  After you decide how much per hour keep track of the time it takes to do a project (one card) only count the actual time it takes to do the card. Don't count set up time or coffee break time. For example if you want to make $8.00 an hour and your work is worth $8.00 and it only takes you 30 minutes to do a card then your cost for that card it $4.00.<br>  THEN, add it the cost of your materials for that card, paper, paints, decorations,etc and add them together. After you've added your actual cost and your actual time then figure out what 25 percent of that figure is and add that to your cost of materials and your time. That would be the price you charge your customer.  It might look like a high price to you but remember you are creating handmade (no computer, right?) cards and your time and skill is valuable. <br>  So if you are worth $8 an hour and it takes you 30 minutes and your materials cost a $1.00 to make one card then your cost for that one card is $ $5.00 plus 25 percent of the five dollars, or $1.25 for a final cost of $6.25.<br>  The second method of calculating your retail price is:<br>  3 to 5 times your cost. No hourly wage. So if your cost of materials for one card is $1.25 then 3 times $1.25 brings your price to $3.75, 4 times $1.25 that brings your retail price to $5.00 and 5 times your cost of $1.25 bring your price  to $6.25.<br>  Three  times your cost is a bit low. The second one (4 times your cost) is something you might use if someone wanted to buy 3 or 4 or more at one time. That's the way to give someone a deal when they supply you with steady work. The last one, (5 times your cost) is a retail price for high quality work.  That 's the one you would use if you were selling at a fair or crafts show. Keep in mind that the more you make the cards the faster you will get at it and so increase your income. Don't sell yourself short just to get business. Handmade items sell well in the right markets.  Find the right high end markets for products. Good for you for finding a way to make money doing something you like to do!|`|gAOAdOHraa	Aus$5, but only if it is good and doesn't look like the person giving the card make it themselves.

Remote units seem to trip from the flash when not using cable, which means the only way to do it really wirelessly would be a fake flash head on the camera that sent a radio signal to a unit that pretended to be a cable plugged into the remote and this is likely to be costly.

5wDSSzaVaa	Other than you should be asking a theater coach these sort of questions, in this particular monologue, Helena is in love and all emotions that come with that (jealousy, anger, sadness, remorse, etc.)<br>  <br>  The best type of auditions is when the actor comes up with his or her own ideas about a monologue (especially one that has been done many times before) and creates a character that's unique. Directors have seen people do the same monologue thousand of times, and most of those times have been done the same way.<br>  <br>  Best technique is to relate what Helena is saying in this monologue to how YOU would feel in that situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

pYe3kkgNaa	it's possible that you just have some pent up creativity,  i think it would be a good idea to start off with it as a hobby, try going to drawing classes, get a sketchbook to put your ideas down,   if you still have a great passion for art and want to explore it further than do,   remember, it is almost impossible to make a living out of being an artist alone, many practicing artists also have other jobs just to pay for rent, materials etc.,  even commercial art, (Graphic design for example) is very competitive, although it does pay well once you establish yourself,   but if this is what you want to do then go for it,   you only get one life.  good luck with your choices =]|`|GeHrKxThaa	Been there. I drew a lot up until high school, then concentrated on academics. I ended up with a BS in physics and an MS in applied mathematics. I worked for two years in the field, then through a series of events ended up quitting and having a baby. Thankfully, my husband makes the income, so I am free to draw when I can and not hold a full-time job. I'm 29 and already changed careers, and it probably won't be the last time. It has taken a few years to find my interests and strengths, and I make very little money. I'd recommend looking at it as a side-job until you can get your feet wet.|`|YTgw2VQjaa	I think it may be a desire that you want what comes with that life.  You see the glamor and freedom of being an illustrator or artist.  If you think you would like to pursue it, find an arts course somewhere near you and try it out.  You'll learn what it actually takes to do that and the fact that most people who do art do not make enough money to live from their art.  If you do commercial work, then you'll make more money, but that's hard to get as well.  I think you should pursue it as a hobby and see where it goes...

I can recommend some good ones that are not difficult to read-    The Giver, Gathering Blue, and Messenger by Louis Lowry (should be read in this order) are all science fiction.

y8bFwXZEaa	Absolutely agree. Every life form has needs, and its virtues are what it uses to gain its needs. The biggest hippo gets to be "king." Being biggest and baddest is therefore a virtue.<br>  <br>  As far as man "qua man" is concerned, his needs are more intellectual than physical, because he can eat just about anything, and very little when it becomes necessary.<br>  <br>  He doesn't need to fight for the girl--in a free society we let the female choose. That is the right of intellectual freedom.<br>  <br>  Aristotle taught that the good is good for the creature "qua whatever it may be". An ocean is good for whales, but dry land isn't.<br>  <br>  Man cannot live without his intellectual freedoms, unless he lives in a state of slavery. But even then his mind is free. What the good for "man qua man" comes down to is legal respect for his unalienable rights, without which the U.S. could not have become the greatest nation of man.<br>  <br>  Too bad to say our virtues are going down the toilet with our values.

K60FfiIfaa	The Roman government was basically a city council.  Only the denizens of the city of Rome were considered actual Roman citizens; other cities in Italy were considered allies, defeated territories or colonies.  It was not like the unified, modern concept of a nation state.  <br>  <br>  Rome was a republic, but only those from rich patrician families could be part of the government.  That changed a little over time, as special offices were opened up for the plebes, but generally it was a rich man's game.<br>  <br>  As Rome conquered new lands, the number of people who were denied citizenship grew.  Also, slaves were brought in from the conquered lands.  As such the number of people oppressed or denied a role in the government grew.  <br>  <br>  Meanwhile the rich patricians got richer as wealth flowed into Rome.  This widening gap between the rich and the poor got dangerously large.  Rome desperately needed reforms, such as extending citizenship to the whole empire, but the patricians blocked such reform, as it would reduce their own power.  <br>  <br>  As Rome grew its borders grew too, and those borders needed to be defended.  This required a huge army, which presented a new problem.  Traditionally after a soldier completed service, they were given a plot of arable land.  But by the late republic, there were too many soldiers and not enough farm land left.  This left many angry, destitute ex-soldiers.  Also soldiers increasingly identified with their generals, rather than with Rome overall.  This set the stage for civil war.<br>  <br>  At some point it got so bad that Rome broke down into civil war and class warfare.  Rome would not stabilize until Augustus was declared emperor, and finally instituted the needed reforms.

Why can I see it but not to make it stop.<br>  Well, it's hard to explain.<br>  I don't like to see homeless people on the streets on their knees. Something that is in their eyes is too much for me. Or the way they wait. Silently. It's strange that we live and we die, but some others must live in a way that can hardly be called living.<br>  <br>  But I was happy to read this question. Take care! :) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDBsE5gjSi0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDBsE5gjS...</a>

If you dont, skip it.<br>  <br>  You need to work on your enjambment, and some punctuation would be nice. In poetry of this type, line-breaks are meant to mean something. These are fairly arbitrary - clearly defined by little more than aesthetics.<br>  <br>  If you merely want a comment, read this part.<br>  <br>  A pleasant expressive piece - your meaning is clear and your imagery is pleasing.|`|4ieW81HHaa	I think you could've ended it on "naively watched", the "fly by" part was a visual contradiction to tethered. Or maybe change "by" to around. Or just leave it and tell me I'm full o' chit. Okay, . . . I'm full o' chit; I get it now - WERE is the key word.|`|uW7XLCF3aa	You know me ma, I don't have a clue to the "rules" of poetry writing, ( I would get bogged down in attempting to understand it, then loose my enjoyment of it's read), but I know what speaks to me in that certain way and gives me food for thought, or a laugh or brings a tear to my eye. Having said all that, my humble comment is...I like this one because it paints a mental picture and takes me into the poem itself, and....okay,.... I've rattled on long enough. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. <br>  I'll shut up now. **hangs head and slowly walks away**.|`|KPDOrmTsaa	You're giving me visions of hopes, not yet dashed, but with a bit of dwindling eagerness for their fruition.<br>  Ah well, you did a good job on this one.<br>  It makes me wish I was back in my teens!<br>  (wild cackling laughter.  We'll never see those days again, will we?)|`|GyB3jGTsaa	that is a great poem. it is short but packed with a lot of meaning which i think makes a great poet. the music to it was great and i think that this is a good poem to model for future poems you do!

Nicely constructed.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Oh wow you are talking about Hot air balloons.. This sounds like me always wanting to fly in one but never a chance.I myself have been tethered to the ground not really exploring whats really around me.

AA10242125	Go to the public library. Read Writer's Market. It will explain how to submit a book to a publisher and who might buy from an unknown writer. Follow the submission guidelines to the letter if you want a chance at being published.     Remember Gone With the Wind was rrejected 42 times. The first Harry Potter book was rejected 11 times.    Join a Writer's group at a community college. Practice your writing. Ask  fellow writers to critic you.    Good luck!
c4Vs8j5baa	There are many books like that and even more that are based on Cinderella, like Ella Enchanted. Anther good book is Angus, Thongs and Full -Frontal Snogging by Louise Rennison.|`|pGOv3sFfaa	Well there's this book called Avalon High.. except there is a twist to it. The girl is new and she likes the popular guy in school, etc.<br>  It's really good!

I'd have to pull the video up on the internet but ya I could figure out all the steps.|`|s8irnNDYaa	i love the dance i have the so called roll as mary... but if ur studio or dance class wants to compete or perform proeffessionly with it they must change some steps thats what my studio did or at least u have to re-arrange the steps|`|U3fv32UKaa	ya!   i no one of the girls in that part and she taught me and a couple others the dance for practice
FAUPZeSxaa	Well it isn't really ancient roman but I think you might like it too.  It's called The Last Girls of Pompeii by Kathryn Lasky.  It is my favorite historical fiction book and the closest one to that time period that I can think of.  It really is a very very good book, but also very sad in the end.|`|gi6u9W3Kaa	Try: Oedipus... i think thats what its called.... its a crazy story...|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Books from ancient Roman times or modern books about Ancient Rome?  The novel as we know it didn't really come about until the 15th century, however, the poetry of Ovid particularly his Metamorphosis is fantastic.  Virgil's Aenied is also great from that era.<br>  <br>  If you want contemporary historical fiction on the era the best work on the subject is Robert Graves'  I Claudius and Claudius the God.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If that's what you like then the above suggestions should be right up your alley.  The Aenied is basically the Roman equivalent of the Odyssey and the Metamorphosis is a flowing story that goes through all the major Roman myths linking them together quite brillaintly.   The Graves novels are based on the true events in the life of the Emperor Claudius.  Beginning with his childhoood under the first Emperor Augustus and ending with his own rule.  Fascinating and entertaining.
py39L7Wraa	ancient Greek history is fascinating. i got the chance to study some stories for a year in English it was so nice. the only bad thing was remembering the greek and roman names and which one went with which. other than that, it was really nice.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	It's not just you.  I love Greek & Roman history too.  But don't kid yourself about it being cool to live back then.  No antibiotics, no anesthesia, no chocolate, no birth control, no refrigeration, no deoderant...|`|Fi5GJKSKaa	jhajhajhajha<br>  its not just you<br>  i like it too<br>  :)|`|HkXYGAOdaa	Me too.  I adore ancient Greek history.  But were I wish to live back in another period, I'd want to live in the Persian Empire: the cradle of civilization, education, art, science, mathematics, medicine, etc.

iNXqiDIYaa	It chronicles the fate of the warrior Ajax after the events of the Iliad and the Trojan War. At the onset of the play, Ajax is enraged because Achilles' armor was awarded to Odysseus, rather than him. He vows to kill the Greek leaders who disgraced him. Before he can enact his revenge, though, he is tricked by the goddess Athena into believing that the sheep and cattle that were taken by the Achaeans as spoil are the Greek leaders. He slaughters some of them, and takes the others back to his home to torture, including a ram which he believes to be his main rival, Odysseus.    After coming to his senses, he pities himself over his disgrace. His wife Tecmessa pleads for him not to leave her and her child unprotected. He pretends that he is moved by her speech, and says that he is going out to purify himself and bury the sword given to him by Hector. After he has gone, a messenger arrives to say that the seer Calchas has warned that if Ajax leaves his house that day, he will die. His wife and soldiers try to track him down, but are too late. Ajax had indeed buried the sword but left the blade sticking out of the ground. His body is found after having thrown himself on it. Sophocles lets us hear the speech Ajax gives immediately before his suicide (which, unlike most Greek tragedies, is called for to take place onstage), in which he calls for vengeance against the sons of Atreus (Menelaus and Agamemnon) and the whole Greek army.    The last part of the play revolves around the dispute over what to do with Ajax's body. Ajax's half brother Teucer intends on burying him despite the demands of Menelaus and Agamemnon that the corpse is not to be buried. Odysseus, although previously Ajax's enemy, steps in and persuades them to allow Ajax a proper funeral by pointing out that even one's enemies deserve respect in death, if they were noble. The play ends with Teucer making arrangements for the burial (which is to take place without Odysseus, out of respect for Ajax).

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.

They all can!  You have to have a digital file, so you'd have to scan your photo or drawing unless it was taken with a digital camera or made with computer software.|`|YNbgnZD2aa	Yes, you can use Photoshop 6 for working with any kind of image, as well as with text. You can often find software reference books at your library; sometimes you can even purchase cheap texts for obsolete software at the library book sale. Also, if you have a local college that has a graphic design program, you might put a up a notice on the department bulletin board asking for used texts that could be of help.  Note: Even if you have version 6, a textbook for version 7 would be useful.|`|AA12339318	You can go back to Photoshop version 3 or even earlier and do much the same things that current versions do.  Upgrades simply tend to add featureas that make some functions easier or more automated.  In fact, people were doing the same kinds of effects even BEFORE computers were used for this purpose.    But doing these kinds of effects with specail camera equipment and in a darkroom was EXTREMELY labor intensive and required some extensive knowledge, training and practice to acheive.  Computer software brought much of this ability and made it available to talented users.    I remember when I started using the first Photoshop version with LAYERS.  What used to take hours to do in my old Corel application could be done in minutes with Photoshop.  A lot less trial and error was involved.  I think my first Photoshop was a Limited Edition (LE) and my second was version 3.0.  Even then, I was doing pretty much what I do now with my Photoshop CS version.  Only it took much longer.

8AYA5gTBaa	I assume we are talking about the Lomography Diana+.    I have a comparison posted here:  http://dianacamera.com/archives/50    The Diana+ is a more flexible camera, having more controls (3 f-stops + Pinhole aperture vs 1 aperture). The Diana+ also has the albility to change lenses. Currently, Lomography offers 4 additional lens.    The Holga, on the other hand, is a very solidly built camera, and while not being as flexible, is still a very capable camera. It will take photos that equal that of the Diana.    Which should you get? I usually like to recommend the Holga 120N or 120FN for beginners.     Why? It's a cheaper and simpler camera to learn with. If you get this camera it keeps the cost of exploring toy camera photography on the cheap side. If it turns out that toy camera photography is your passion, then you can explore getting the Diana+ or vintage Diana.    Let's look at the cost:  Holga 120N - $28 (no flash, but with a hotshoe)  Holga 120FN - $35 (built-in flash)    Diana+ - $50 (no flash, no hotshoe)  DianaF+ - $100 (comes with electronic flash attachment and hotshoe accessory)    Sample Photos:  Holga  http://www.flickr.com/groups/86881528@N0...    Diana+ DIanaF+  http://www.flickr.com/groups/diana_plus/    120 film is a little more difficult to deal with, since there are fewer labs that can process it. Ask around at your local Walmart, Costco or other 1-hour labs. While they may not be able to process the film on site, many of these labs will send the film out to be processed for you.    The next option is to find a local pro-lab. These are labs that specifically cater to professional photographers and will be able to process your film on site. As you might imagine, it can be a little pricey.    Another film processing option is to send out the film to be processed. Dwaynes photo is a good place to go:  http://www.dwaynesphoto.com/    Then the best of all option, process the film yourself. BW film processing and even color processing are not too difficult to learn and also not very expensive to get into.    If you think that 120 film is too much trouble, you can try a 35mm camera, like the Holga 135BC. While I find that something gets lost in the smaller negative and rectangular format, it might work for you.       The Holga 120N or 120CFN (120 format) or the 35mm Holga 135BC can be found at Freestyle Photo supply:  http://freestylephoto.biz/    The Diana+ cameras can be found at some stores like Urban Outfitters, or online at http://lomography.com    Whichever camera you choose, remember that the point of lo-fi photography is to have fun and don't sweat the details!    For Holga tips, check out these websites:  http://www.squarefrog.co.uk/  http://goholga.com/    Then there's my own website:  http://www.dianacamera.com/    I have lots of tips, tricks and photos taken with plastic cameras.    For how-to videos for Holgas and Diana cameras, check out my youtube channel:  http://www.youtube.com/user/kaituba|`|Z6oc1VgSaa	They're basically the same, just the Diana is a lot more prone to light leaks and other problems/quirks.

I would steer clear of them - there are probably better photographers in Scotland and closer to home if you just want pictures.

aHgO3E8Iaa	Don't listen to  *ich_ , they shouldn't be answering a question they know nothing about.    Use photoshop.    Adjust the brightens/contrast to clean up the lines as much as possible.    Set the layer that your lines/ paper are on to a "multiply" setting.   Create  new layer UNDER the lines layer, and paint away under it.    "Multiply" settings make it so that layer only reads darks. So all the light colors, like white become "transparent" even though they're still there. A "Screen" setting does the opposite and only recognizes light colors.    If you don't want to color it in and only want to clean up the lines, then just use brightness/contrast until you have the desired effect.|`|iItEzXUUaa	well does it need to be on the computer?    Because if it doesn't, you can just take it to the copy machine and copy it onto a sheet of transparency paper, like for overhead projectors.|`|gTaDLBC7aa	I think that I understand what your asking. You just what to have the image, highlight and shadows included, without the background.     If I'm right then another way to do it in photoshop is create a new layer without any background color then move this layer under the other one. Now simply use the eraser on your main layer (the one with the pic) to get rid of what you don't want see.    Remember with photoshop there are hundreds of ways to do the same thing.

I must say, this is very good. I really enjoy your writing style.    As far as criticizms go, I have few. Like I said, I love your style, so I only want to point out a few sentances that looked or sounded a little funny:    "I repeated this in my head several times, but it was not as effective as I'd hoped."  The sentance itself is good, especially the clause after the comma, but I don't like the use of the word "this" in that spot. I'm not really sure what you'd replace it with, though. Maybe "that"? Or "it"?    ". . . freezing my soaking head off. . ."  I don't know why, but when you say this aloud, it sounds like a poor substitution for a profanity. LIke freezing my f***ing head off, but messed up . . . . I know it sounds a little weird. I don't know-- maybe it's just me.     " . . . hung down over chest."  Is this a typo? It doesn't make sense, grammatically.    In the paragraph talking about the bathroom and how she looks:  ". . . I wasnt surprised to see it in such a filthy condition. . ."  and  "I wasnt shocked to see myself in such a horrid state--"  sound a little too similar, sorry.        But overall, honestly, it is amazing. I would definately give it at least an eight-point-five, or a nine out of ten. Trust me, it's good. And I'm not just trying to suck up or anything.  Depending on what follows, even a ten's looking good.    Have you written more? If you have, please post.        Good luck. Hope I helped.    And I would love to see this published, on a book store shelf one day.|`|BZxkDecZaa	It's good, don't get me wrong, but there are a few fairly significant literary critiques that I have made based on what you wrote.    You do realize that between the first and sixth chapter you have switched from present to paste tense? This is a major error -if it is unintentional. Stories are best written in active present tense, it takes far less words and is a more direct -and therefore engaging, tense to write in.      You absolutely need to make the scenario your plot beleiveable. This means that you are going to have to research the pyschology of a captive. It is a psychological condition where prisoners do fall in love with their captors -especially if they have a personality that either is or loves to be dominated by others. But you cannot simply have an average person fall in love with a captive without having their actions conform with pyschological norms: failing to do so will probably confuse readers.   Also, incorporate all forms of description in your writing: all the senses can contribute to your writing. Feeling should be used whenever she has cause to hurt, sight whenever she is looking for something, sound and smell when she wants others to think her eyes are closed, etc.  Remember the importance of believability though -which I cannot stress enough. In most scenarios she would be raped repeatedly by the man -a reason must be provided as to why a man who likes to dominate his captives decides to not do so sexually.  Hope this helps! :-)

2TLXfQKDaa	Though it is true, that it doesn't really matter how as long as they get there, there are a few things to be mindful of.  If you use the camera/usb  it will empty the card more slowly than a card reader, some people don't care about this especially when they're transferring maybe 200 images tops.  When you get to the several hundreds, this becomes a bothersome waste of time and unnecessary drain on your cameras battery.  Biggest downside to using the camera to transfer - if your camera battery dies while in the middle of transfer, say good bye to some of those images.  There is software to to recover damaged and corrupted files, but a cheap card reader is a reliable and fast way to get the job done.  Either transfer on full battery, or buy a 20 dollar card reader.  I use a card reader myself.|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	The fastest and easiest way is to just take out the memory card from the camera and put it in a card reader (or the slot in the computer, if your computer has an SD card reader built-in).  The computer will read it just like any other disk drive, and you can copy and paste files from it like you would with any other folder.  Just insert it, and then go to "My Computer" and you will see a list of your drives.  The memory card should show up as "removable drive" or something similar.  It will probably be drive letter G.<br>  <br>  The memory card is really nothing more than a portable storage device, like a flash drive.  So you can open it and copy and paste files from or to it, like any other folder.  <br>  <br>  If you connect the camera directly to the computer with the USB cable, not only is that a lot slower, but you may also have to use software to transfer the files.  <br>  <br>  It's much easier and faster to just take out the memory card and insert it into the computer (or a card reader).|`|0LgpcOBDaa	My files are 3.5Mb each.

5TSW3eK9aa	It's called iambic pentameter. An iamb in English poetry is a unit consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. An iambic pentameter is a line that contains 5 iambs.    Actually, to be accurate, The Target is in iambic tetrameter (a line that contains 4, not 5, iambs), not pentameter. If you count the number of syllables in each line of The Target, you will get 8 syllables in a line - since an iamb consists of 2 syllables, there are 8 / 2 = 4 iambs, not 5, in a line. So strictly speaking the meter is iambic tetrameter. (The same is true for every fourth line - the last line of each stanza - of Perhaps.)    Hope this helps. Good luck with your essay!

xopIi2Vfaa	don't know what silver your ounce coins are, but if they are sterling it will be fine. It's fine silver which is very soft. Sterling silver is used for flatware (though the knife blade is usually stainless steel), so it's used for handles.   Some stones you can cast into place, other will be damaged by the heat. You will have to look up which ones are yours. If you know exactly what you got the rio grande website will probably tell you if you can cast them in place or not. If you don't know exactly what you have, try to find out from your source. If in doubt make settings. I don't know much about settings except that the most common type is with claws and I they don't have to be facetted to do this. I would suggest checking into books which go through different types of jewelry settings. You probably can find some at the library, directly or through interlibrary loan.|`|XGt0umHCaa	Most coins are alloyed with other metal to harden them for extra circulation life. Flatware as knife and cutlery referred to is usually in sterling. A word of caution though if the coins are in circulation currently using them in such a way may break the treasury rules with huge fine per coin.  Try a  jeweler's metal merchants they sell all sorts of metals in plate and shapes with known purity. Or get adventurous and get some casting kibble of right metal and have a go at casting only a little higher than molten lead . The last option would be a specialist woodworking  supplier  as they sell supplies for that sort of thing.  A non faceted or rounded stone is called a cabochon they are usually held in place by a thin metal ribbon soldered with silver solder to the object in the shape of the stone forming a cup shape called a bezel that is closed tight around the stones edges with a rubbing or burnishing tool often if done well no glues are needed.
6bf8fc343473829ae44db7d8c30410a0aa	You have very good taste.  : )<br>  <br>  I second David Sedaris, especially Me Talk Pretty One Day.  Since you like Ellis, you might like Albert Camus.  I know The Stranger isn't really a straight up comedy, but it has satirical elements.  You might also like Catch-22.  There are so many funny scenes and one-liners in that book, it's almost unbelievable that one person wrote it.|`|KDigMCfZaa	You might enjoy Carl Hiaasen, Michael McClelland, and Christopher Moore.

sErY4py0aa	Their human hair doesn't affect their wolf hair<br>  THey all have dark brown/black hair and they arent all black wolves just sam is<br>  so if they dyed their hair they would just look weird as a human|`|B41roQ52aa	The fur of the wolf has nothing to do with human hair. Sam was the only wolf I remember being black, even though I think most (if not all) of the other werewolves had dark hair. The color of the wolf (and all of its physical aspects) were a reflection of the spirit of the man who changed. Hence the whole Spirit Warriors story during the legends in Eclipse. I know, I know, nobody actually read through all of those. But they do answer this question. :)|`|pGOv3sFfaa	That would be so cool! But no, it would stay the natural color.|`|Lw5LaIriaa	I don't think it would because it would be like them wearing clothes. The clothes just rip off. The dyed hair would have no effect because it's not actually part of them. But I assume that when they become human again their hair would change back to pink. <br>  <br>  But I'm kinda confused. One of the werewolves had grey fur but he didn't have grey hair? So where is your logic? xD|`|NeOwDBulaa	No. it's not natural. Just as if someone got plastic surgery before they had a kid, the kid would have the features before the cosmetic surgery, because the appearance and hair color is still a gene within them.|`|Aj16de8Aaa	No because  that is not in there dna or whatever.

3XNUUfFyaa	I have been stretching pre-gesoed canvas for years, I use Dixie canvas from Frederick's. That is very heavy with heavy tooth canvas. Usually my paintings are 48x36 inches. The method I use is start in the middle of the stretcher bar and after about 3 staples go to the next stretcher bar and so on working out from the center. I use canvas stretching pliers and it takes a lot of pulling and tugging on my part. It is labor intensive to get the canvas tight. Lot of times I have to gesso the back of the canvas to get it tight to my preferences. Water and gesso will tighten up the weave in the canvas making it more taught. Lately I found it easier to buy un-gessoed canvas stretch it and gesso it myself. It doesn't take as much work and the effect is nicer, it is still heavy 12pt canvas.|`|4028712e620e658c94a48c6d10f37b2daa	i would have thought if it was already gessoed, then it is already stretched. so all you need to do it staple it to the canvas.  it should be in a state that it wont warp when you paint it.    you could try soaking the canvas in boiling water to see if it will stretch any more.    another way is to do away with the stretcher. and glue the canvas to some waterproof MDF board and use a roller to make sure its flat. though, you might need to use small tacks on the back instead of the stapler.

Some of the main themes are courage and cowardice, and the difference between the two.  It's easy to read, yet thought provoking.  In the time it was written, Realism was (and still is) a popular manner of thinking, and it really shines through in this book.  If you read it, you should think about this:  Is deserting the army in the face of death cowardly or sensible?<br>  <br>  Well, I hope you find one that you like!|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Bells has your best answer. I was going to say Lincoln by Gore Vidal.|`|KDigMCfZaa	John Jakes's North and South trilogy is excellent and shows both sides.|`|CyDD4ADwaa	Two great books on the Civil War, almost classics, are The Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, both by Michael or Jeff Shaara (The son continued his father's work). Each book gives about equal time to each side of the conflict, but the books are more about the actual Civil War than stuff like Gone With the Wind. You will get detailed and compelling descriptions from the points of view of some of the major and rising officers on both sides. Overall, these two books are extremely well done and really provoke a lot of thought. <br>  <br>  **A word of caution, however: if you start with Gods and Generals, which is the beginning of the war but not the first one written, the first part of the book is somewhat slow--just a heads up.|`|ki8P8bYfaa	Um...I think Gone With The Wind is about the Civil War, but I'm not sure.

TAIlyvgyaa	I read lots of genres, but I am a die hard fan of the British 'Why Done It',  Barbara Vine's (Ruth Rendell) are my favourite.<br>  <br>  I deeply dislike fantasy fiction, but nonetheless I absolutely adore everything Terry Pratchett has ever written.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	I like well-written stories! <br>  <br>  Sorry if that doesn't really fit in your examples involving genre, but that's all I really look for. My favourite books include members from fantasy, sci-fi, romance, historical fiction, YA novels, horror, cookbooks (especially for desserts), comic books (Cartoons mostly. Like Calvin and Hobbes and The Far Side), joke books, short story collections,  and urban fantasy.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose one genre that I like the most, I'd have to pick fantasy. I really like how supernatural elements (when used well) can augment a story. <br>  <br>  The genre, however, is ripe with literary incest. Nearly every fantasy book on store shelves has its roots somewhere in Tolkien and the genre has just been inbreeding since. The Evil Overlord, the child of destiny, the quest to save the world. Just head over to the fantasy section of the library if you don't believe me. All pseudo-medieval, all with a touch of magic to spice it up, all with some Evil Overlord.<br>  <br>  There are other time periods and mythologies, fantasy genre! Get your act together! <br>  <br>  That said, I like all genres, provided that the story is good. I haven't been able to read genre shovel-lit since about the 9th grade when I stumbled upon the secret of formula writing.|`|pGOv3sFfaa	I like chick books, like real-world girls in L.A. and New York, fashion fiction books.

I like alternate universes and future worlds.<br>  <br>  I can't resist a bit of wand-waving now and again.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I go for 'realistic' stories if they have interesting plots.

yvp2RBuRaa	I'm sure you read the instructions the photographer provided, so I'll delve a little into the part of your questions about "shot go smoother, camera settings, lights, anything".    Remember that for this kind of photo, you must have the same lighting in each shot, so you can't take one shot at 9AM and another at 3PM because the light will be very different.    You need a more advanced camera that lets you manipulate the settings.  Most point and shoots won't allow this.    Regarding camera settings, start where the photographer suggested - with an automated setting and take the shot.  Record the settings used - ISO, aperture, shutter speed, even white balance.  Then switch to manual and put all the settings at the same that you got when you shot auto.    The other thing that makes it go smoother is the tripod mentioned in the article.  By using the tripod, everything remains at the same point in the picture except the model (you!), so doing the cutting and pasting is vastly easier.    Keep in mind that this is not a multiexposure photo.  The end product is several photos from which a piece of each one is taken and layered onto the "master layer", which is itself one of the photos that you shot and chose to be the master layer.    Hope this helps.  Good Luck & Good Shooting

mNhVQbAdaa	if your memory card doesn't fit into your computer, your camera probably came with a usb cord that can attach you camera at one end and the computer at the other, a file will then pop up and you can copy the pics into a folder on your computer, now im not sure what kind of website you have, but if it is a html website you are going to have to write a code,     here we go,,    in the body of your webpage type,        then put in what ever your picture is called     .    what ever the extension on the picture (ex. jpg, gif, bmp)    >    make sure that the picture you are using is in the same folder as all of your html script pages..    hopefully thats what you mean by "putting it on a website"|`|AA12185092	For memory stick-to-computer, you need a card reader. If your computer lacks a card slot, you can buy one that plugs into a USB port. In either case, the memory stick will then show up as an external drive and you can copy the picture files to your computer.     To display them on your website you will need to upload them to the web server, using the same software you use to upload your web pages, and you will need to create a web page with links to them. (The links need to point to the location on the web server, not on your hard drive.) If you are using them as graphics within web pages, you will want to reduce them to the actual displayed size. Most image viewers, including Windows Paint can do that for you.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	I guess one of the things the sales person did not tell you when they sold you your Sony digital camera is that you need some advanced computer skills.    Until you can obtain those skills as well as skills necessary to produce excellent images, you can do the following    IF your computer is new enough, it will have a memory card slot for your Memory Stick.  Just insert it and use the file manager to drag the image files on your card to the new file folder you are using for all your website photos and other graphics.  If your computer does not have a card reader, you can buy a 2.0 USB Memory Stick card reader for under about $30
ZU2nlPGVaa	Some really good editing software. While the your photos as a whole are lovely,......they appear to be flat; you want them to be appealing, almost as if you can smell the strudel. You shot the light and dark strudel what I called flat on. Improve your backlighting and direct lighting. You might even want to tilt the plates, that way you will have angles. On one of them there is a very pronounced shadow. In this particular case, shawdows are not your friends,.....that's more for artsy fartsy photos and films. What kind of camera are you using, what are the megapixels? Always remember the higher the megapixels, the better the quality. Look up the definition and explanation of 3 point lighting, this might help. Now, would you like to learn a couple of fun tricks? Buy you some plain old fashioned glycerin, you should be able to find it in a health food store. There are so many ways to use this product. Also buy you some plastic ice cubes. Lets say, your taking a photo of a glass of tea; considering the very bright and hot lighting, for a photo shoot, real ice cubes wouldn't last long at all. Use plastic ice cubes, to give the illusion of actual ice cubes, then with an eye dropper, tear drops all over the glass or container of tea,.....and presto chango,....there's your beautiful glass of cold ice tea. Now the strudel,...and instructions on lighting and positioning already given; if you brush glyscerin on the strudel, especiallythe crusts, it will make it look fresh.  Good luck,.....of you have further questions, I'll try and help,.....and oh yes, have fun along the way.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Here is a link that will help you with your composition (for either P&S or DSLR cameras)    http://photoinf.com/General/Robert_Berda...

You could try it yourself.|`|8VtO9EX8aa	As digital photography continues to take over, more and more services and products related to digital photos (versus traditional print photos) are emerging.  As such, the market for scanning services of prints, slides and negatives is growing at an amazing pace.    So to answer your question, there is a growing number of businesses out there that will scan your negatives for you and put them onto CD or DVD (or whatever other memory media you'd like).    First of all, there are a number of "online" services.  Generally when you use these services, you will need to mail your negatives to them.  Here is a list that came up when I Googled "negative scanning services":    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=neg...    I've heard of ScanCafe and ScanMyPhotos...I think they might be among the first internet-based services to offer negative scanning.    However, if you are uncomfortable with putting your negatives in the mail (as many people are), you are likely to find some some local businesses that can do it for you as well.  Some of the specialty 1-hour photo type places are getting into the business of scanning and printing digital prints.  I've also heard that Costco can now scan negatives (but have been unable to confirm myself).  As for other chain-type locations, I would recommend checking with Ritz Camera or Kinko's.    Good luck, and if I might add, I applaud you for taking the time to preserve your old photos!  Once you have them in digital form, just don't forget to back them up!!

aw85XgQwaa	What I did with my old website , I added a text to the bottom or top of the artwork from  photoshop, before I opened the website to transfer it onto the new one. This way if someone downloads your image, the name is on it also. Best to go through a service that protects your work. Once it is published from the web, that is your copyright day. There are  some reasonable rates out there. Look for good deals on the web for web servers. I hope some of  this has helped you.|`|GeHrKxThaa	People can steal your work off those sites just as easily as from any other site. You have to protect your work no matter where you put in online. Add a watermark, and save the image with additional info like the copyright year and your name (when you save-as in Gimp or Photoshop, there's an option to do this). When you have your own site, or a site where you can control the HTML, you can add additional security, like turning off right-clicks. But even that won't stop someone from taking a screenshot. Watermarks are the best way to go, in addition to making your files small (no more than 500px) and low resolution. (Just don't make the watermark obnoxious, or it will detract from the image.)|`|AA12238474	I post mine on the web at a low resolution so they cant be blown up.

Ugh.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The Catcher in the Rye, a novel narrated by main character and hero Holden Caulfield, is the story of Holden's life in the few days after being expelled from his Pennsylvania prep school.    It's a great story about coming of age and alienation. Keep on reading.    From Shmoop/Catcher in the Rye|`|ceBTTCPwaa	This is one of my all time favourite books. I have read this book many times over the last 23 years. The book entertains, touches and saddens me as much today as when I first read it at 15. Back then I could identify with Holden's view of the people populating his world of school and home. Now I read terrified that I may have become just another one of those phonies! In 'The Catcher in the Rye" Salinger draws a realistic portrait of a depressed teenager trying to come to terms with the feelings he has for those around him and to work through the grief he feels for his brother. Although Holden appears to be an annoying, self confessed liar and dropout, on a road to self destruction, the scenes in which he interacts with his sister, Phoebe, show a love and side to his character which are both beautiful and touching.  For those reviewers and readers who are unimpressed by 'The Catcher in the Rye', you may like to consider reading some of JD Salingers other works. Although I personally dipped into 'For Esme with Love and Squalour' and 'Franny and Zooey' because I loved Salinger's portrayal of Holden Caulfield, you might find them useful to help put the novel into context and perspective - then give it another go!  If you have never read this book I urge you to give it a try! If you have already entered Holden's somewhat twisted world, why don't you, like me, read it for the umpteenth time!
Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  Eye witnesses corroborate the details of how he died and how he was disposed of.  Numerous folks who ended up as POWs of the Russians.    2. Could you name a loyal general?  Give us a name--seriously.  Senior officers of the bunker were accounted for.  US and Russia were either trying people for war crimes or seeking them for talent.  The Israelis had their own agenda as well.      3.  How about genetic material?  You say "burned beyond recognition" but that's not quite true.  The Russians recovered enough material to do DNA tests and compare dental records and they match.    4.  Can you give any plausible scenario that would explain how he'd get out of Berlin and where he'd be living?    5.  The claim that he killed himself was plausible with all of the other examples and evidence.  Hitler's dogs (who he worshipped) killed, his mistress dead, his higher aids like Goebels (and his wife and kids) all dead by suicide.    6.  Probably Hitler's worst fear was a show trial by the Russians (who would have done exactly that).|`|wPBfydYhaa	I doubt it highly that he survived the war, but if he did make it out of berlin id assume he live for maybe 10 more years at best. By 1945 hitler health was already failing him so he would have only gotten into the early or mid 1950's.|`|0l98mcf3aa	Jerry, get your brain into gear! The man would have been 120 years old, for god's sake!  He died in the bunker. The Russians took his remains back to Russia.  Please, please don't be a prat all your life. Start changing now.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	If he were still alive, he would be 120 years old!  More to the point, had he survived, he would have had to vanish and stay invisible for the past 60 odd years.  Lastly, you argue that he should not have had to fear the desecration of his body, since we didn't desecrate Saddam's body.  That argument is deeply flawed for several reasons.  First, and foremost, Hitler's body, the bunker he'd lived in, and in fact the entire city were captured by the Soviets, not by the Americans.  Hitler's racial ideas led him to paint the Soviets as subhuman savages, and indeed, Soviet forces committed a series of horrific atrocities against the German people while advancing upon Berlin in retribution for the German atrocities in Russia.  Additionally, US behavior in WWII was much more severe and stern than our behavior these days.  We were, after all, in a war for our very survival.  The fire bombings of Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo are one set of examples.  The atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are another.  Hitler's final sets of orders to his military show his frame of mind.  He ordered the army to destroy Berlin and all its infrastructure, saying that "the German People do not deserve to survive," because they had failed him.  Sounds pretty final and pretty suicidal to me.    Lastly, the Soviets, who had every reason to hate Hitler and to want to make sure he was dead, recovered his bones, and ran extensive forensic tests on them, comparing the results with the medical files and other documents they had captured in taking Berlin, and determined that the skull they had found was,indeed, Hitler.    Unless you have some sort of solid documentary proof, then youi're merely another conspiracy theorist, and your ideas are merely amusing hypotheticals.      Sorry, but Hitler is dead, and all the evidence points to him dying in Berlin in 1945.|`|AA11442722	Hitler did nothing quietly. No way he would have lived quietly. If he'd hidden out in South America he'd started some sort of revolution there eventually. Probably within 10 years of arriving. It is possible Hitler made it out of Germany but if he did somebody got to him within a few years of his departure.

09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	The first requirement for becoming a writer is an active imagination!  You can not truly aspire to creating a series of novels if you are not able to conceive of many plots and conflicts for your characters to experience and conquer.  Try sitting at your computer and brainstorming; make lists of the ideas which come to you.  Once you've produced a substantial number, select those most appealing to you and endeavor to develop them into compelling stories.  Your vision of multiple novels (a la the "Harry Potter" books) may be too immense a project for you to tackle at this point in your life.  Simply attempt to write a stand-alone story for a beginning; if that project is successful (have it critiqued by someone capable who will be objective), then you might think about continuing with your proposed series.  Writing is fun but it is also complex, and becoming published (as in selling your manuscript to a publishing company) is very very difficult to accomplish.  I am guessing that you are very young, and, if so, what you need to do now is to learn your craft.  Practice writing to become competent and professional and take writing courses to gain proficiency.  Good luck!|`|ye6IiFr7aa	wats LOTR?  well take song lyrics and take pieces from that. like leve out all the rest:  i dreamed i was missing (make in the story a girl  was missing)  and you were so sscared (and ppl were scared.)  its simple actually. take parts of a few books and put them together. also take life stuff u have been through and make it like really really exciting and stuff. also take dreams and turn them into a story plot!! these are what i do!! hope i helped|`|arZmuukdaa	Instead of using our original ideas, why not use writing prompts?    This website was intended for short story use, but I'm sure it will be of some help to you too:  http://www.rickwalton.com/freeu/storyide...    As others below me have said, part of writing is being creative and coming up with your own ideas.  Using writing prompts is fine for a boost, but asking us flat-out for our thoughts is like cheating.|`|FNwYzjogaa	The point of writing is to be creative. If you want to publish a book series then you need to learn to come up with your ideas. Many of the people who come here are writers and they are not about to give you their ideas.
7v8Jr0yFaa	Find a way to say what you want without using cliches. You have capitalization and punctuation errors. You start your story off in the most boring, over used way possible. I would suggest you keep practice with this story, and read everything you can get your hands on. You'll be amazed at how the writing changes through out the story. It doesn't seem very interesting, as of yet. The characters are flat and nothing is really going on.  Don't ask a question asking for an opinion by saying you're only thirteen. Amelia Atwater Rhodes was thirteen when she wrote her first book. Good writing doesn't come with age and it doesn't give a free pass for not writing well.|`|nHNCslRZaa	It's good. Lot of detail, but I'm guessing you have more detail for between the chapters because they seem really short, but you told me that at the beginning.    :)    Another thing to check. You missed a couple punctuations, and you don't capitalize the "Don't Judge a book by its Cover."    I think it's pretty good for you're first writing experience. Just make sure that you check all punctuations and if you don't know what to put, just check with your English teacher or someone else.|`|VxYBgjnLaa	i thank that is good do you have more

There are also modular origami models which you can choose from.     Definitions of:  Kusudama: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusudama    If you run a search on YouTube, you are sure get loads of results too,   These are few of the very good and helpful origami channels:    http://www.youtube.com/user/Marigami  http://www.youtube.com/user/barbabellaat...  http://www.youtube.com/user/AdamsSara  http://www.youtube.com/user/Origamiancy    Where books are concerned, you can try any of the following in case you are interested:  Origami Kusudama (Tomoko Fuse)  Floral Origami Globes (Tomoko Fuse)  Origami (this is beginner's) (Hideaki Sakata)  Origami Zoo, etc    You will be able to find book reviews on these on Google Books as well as on amazon.com.

1iWNBBMfaa	Very interesting issue!  The problem of radical relativism is that you have to believe that there are no forms of knowledge since every knowledge proofs to be fallible.  If you accept that as a fact science is dead. It doesn't bring anything:creationism is just as valid as evolution and all knowledge is void.    Actually people never act like they think this is true. They go to hospitals to get cured because they believe that medical science is at least for a great part right; astronauts believe in rocket science etc...    The endeavor lies not in seeing that knowledge is nothing but in finding what we cn use.   Answers are not easy but in most cases you'll see that meta-theories (theories that are used as a framework) are more likely to be surpassed than smaller theories that are closer to empirical 'facts'.    I believe too that our knowledge will have changed vast in 200 years but I don't really think that it will be "just as good" as the cosmology of the Egyptians. Somehow I think that it will contain more truth...|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	Formula and discoveries from 1000s of years ago are still useful today, even if we discovered more accurate knowledge recently.  You shouldn't be afraid of new theories wiping away the old.  That is a sign of progress.  It's not like stumbling around randomly, which is what you seem to imply with Pessimistic Induction.    For example, take a murder mystery.  Now of course it is always possible to find new evidence that will overturn your previous conclusions, but really, the chances of that get smaller the better your tools are.

LcYeN6m5aa	Another option I learned in business when starting a company and working on publishing a book:    Pay a private printer, a small printing company, to print the book for you.      You'll pay less for the printing, do your own marketing, you can sell the book for less, you'll make your money back faster and you'll make more money than you will giving it to a publisher.       A few friends of mine have done this and swear by it.  Then you can find a local company to put it on their shelves, and make your own arrangements for them to sell it for you for like a few dollars over printing cost, and they get a couple out of the few dollars, you get the rest, when they run out, print some more.     You may want some people who want to sponsor your book to help you put up the money and divvy up the costs, but a small printing press can print a couple thousand copies for you for a small sum....    It is another route to "publishing"|`|NrJs8en2aa	www.lulu.com    They'll take care of you!|`|AA10487943	There is an invaluabe resource book that comes out every year called The Writer's Market.  They have different versions for different types of writings, even illustrations.  This book is THE tool to help you with the names of all the publishing companies large and small, whatworks they will accept and the guidelines for submission for each company.  It's an awsome resource.  If you cannot afford the newest version, go to a nice chain used book store and buy the previous year's version for a fraction of the cost.|`|8asG4WCwaa	http://www.underdown.org/basics.htm    This is an excellent link about publishing children's books I found on The Purple Crayon.  It has lots of links in it to other good information.     It covers the issues of whether or not to include illustrations and why. You should be able to get accurate information through one or more of the links.      What is the 'problem' with big publishers?  Did you hear this from a vanity (self publishing) press?  Don't believe it.  Vanity presses make a lot of inaccurate or outright wrong claims in order to suck inexperienced authors into paying to publish themselves.  Real publishing doesn't cost you anything, they will market and distribute your book nationwide, list your work in trade journals and purchasing catalogs that go out to every book store and library, and they will PAY YOU.  Vanity presses can't do that. Large retailers and libraries do not carry vanity books, and at best, all the vanity press will do is put the title online - most people still prefer to buy their books at a real store.

The world has enough resources to feed, house, and care for all people, but powerful leaders have chosen a path that optimizes their own well-being at the expense of most people in the world, including their own countries.    Cuba has done a superior job of providing emergency health care to countries throughout the world despite the huge embargo imposed upon them by the US. The Western media is distorting the truth and promoting an agenda that is self-serving.    Perhaps leaders like Ralph Nader will be able to guide us toward a kinder and gentler world.

Without conflict there is no purpose in life.   As a human you cannot live without killing from the food you eat to the steps you take in life. The war is on a micro level.    Greed is part of passion. Passion that needs control, but  If you take passion away you have taken what it means to be human.    Religion is part of our finite minds filling in the blanks.   Countries are the natural process of creating order out of chaos.   I for one would not like to live in a world full of Zombies.

An agent will be able to help you sell your music, which will in time get you exposed, finally being "discovered" but it will definitely take time and patience. But it's also crucial that you confirm that your agent is of a franchised agency. Like, making sure that they are the real thing and not just a scam. The way you figure this out is relatively simple. If they ask you for a single dime of payment ahead of time, it's fake. A real agent charges you a certain percentage of what you make from a job they helped u get (like, for example, I'm into theatre, and when i was in Les Mis in boston, I had to pay my agent 8 % of what I made, as she was the one who got me the job). They shouldn't charge you more than 10% either. But you just need to be patient. Getting a career going in the entertainment business is by no means at all easy.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	If getting discovered were as easy as a phone call to someone, everyone would do it.    And quite frankly, if I knew someone in a position to discover new talent, I certainly wouldn't post their contact information on a public forum like this where thousands of people would see it and drive them crazy with phone calls.
iNXqiDIYaa	that will depend on your definition of scam    they will be genuine literary agents but some will charge more than others and some will do a better job than others - if you are unfortunate enough to choose one of the higher charging, poorer work ones you could well consider it a scam BUT the agent won't be a total scam - they will exist and will act for authors

It's funny, it has twists, it makes you cry, it's just amazing.    The main character, Miles meets a girl named Alaska at boarding school. She's moody and intellectual, so she reads a lot and there are a lot of good thinking quotes in the book just from her. Miles is obsessed with last words, so he quotes them a lot in the book. His religion teacher has a lot of parts in the book because he is inspirational to Miles, and he says stuff like (my favorite quote from him) "Everything that comes together falls apart" which definitely got me thinking. There are a lot of parts involving sex in the book.    The ending is sooo good too.     P.S: If you get the book, DO NOT READ THE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK.

D7OFstJzaa	Concernant le budget de la Dfense  cette poque je ne sais pas s'il tait rellement en baisse (mme si ?a ne m'tonnerait pas du tout); le vrai problme est qu'aprs la guerre de 14 (DER des DER), on ne voulait pas du tout entendre parler d'une ventuelle possible guerre... les gouvernements socialistes de l'poque, hritiers d'une tradition anti militariste et pacifiste ont donc prfr se mettre  genoux devant Hitler  (cf Munich 1938) en esprant que ses vises territotiales se limitraient  l'Europe de l'Est; mais malheureusement ?a n'a pas march, et il fallait s'y attendre...  1 exemple; suite au diktat de Versailles, l'Allemagne devait respecter une zone dmilitarise sur le Rhin d'une profondeur de 50km; lorsque Hitler (en 36 37 ou 38 je ne sais plus) l'a faite roccuper militairement, les fran?ais au lieu de lui foutre une racle (ce qui tait encore possible  cette poque) l'ont gentiment laiss faire, de peur de sa raction...il a ainsi pu tranquillement se prparer et lancer l'offensive quand il s'est senti prt).

Toutefois, le procs de Riom institu par le nouveau  rgime (pour se donner une assisse idologique & politique) a rapidement tourn au fiasco par les Collaborateurs : "La Cour suprme de justice fut institue par Ptain en juillet 1940 pour rechercher les responsables politiques de la guerre.

Il est clair que l, c'est plut?t  Droite  l'poque que l'on trouve les pacifistes (enfin, du moins, les politiques les moins belliqueux) mme si une partie de l'extrme-droite rclame l'crasement de l'Allemagne. L'erreur du FP fut peut-tre de ne pas intervenir durant la Guerre d'Espagne, montrant ainsi son cot vellitaire et confortant Hitler dans ses ides d'crasement des dmocraties, mais il tait difficile de prvoir  cette distance et surtout, le FP est un agrgat de partis de Gauche pas tous sur la mme longueur d'onde, du PC au Parti Radical en passant par la SFIO. Or, issu de la SFIO, Blum avait re?u une fin de non-recevoir de la part des Radicaux pour une intervention en Espagne et un rarmement massif. De plus et malgr toutes les inepties profres  ce propos durant le procs de Riom (et tenues il y a deux ou trois ans par Fillon, c'est  faire frmir !) il faut se souvenir que les programme de commande et de  modernisation des matriels militaires ont t lancs sous le FP, concernant le B1 bis de Renault et autres commandes de Pierre Cot, ministre de l'Air... Mais le poids de l'Etat-Major, la peur de la rupture politique et une certaine dose de faiblesse politique ont empch le FP de mener une politique militaire vraiment volontariste. Cependant ni plus ni moins que les autres (peu nombreux) gouvernements dmocratiques de la mme poque...    Aussi, faire du Front Populaire le responsable de la dfaite de 40 me parait tre une erreur historique majeure !|`|effe6febde6468a9973d6e585e07ed20aa	Le FP a en effet t dsign  la vindicte publique par Ptain qui a fait ouvrir le procs de Riom.

Toujours des ractions orales, alors qu'une offensive militaire n'aurait pas laiss de chances  l'Allemagne, pas encore prte  la guerre.    Mais cette raction doit se comprendre en fonction de 1914-1918. La France est saigne  mort par la guerre: 10% des hommes adultes sont morts. Ce traumatisme n'est pas effac en 1939, et les Fran?ais sont prts  tout, quelque soit leur bord politique, pour ne pas revivre le cauchemare. En fait, l'attitude du Front Populaire est celle de tous les gouvernements des annes 30.    Je te conseil la lecture du livre de Marc Bloch "L'trange dfaite". La France ne voulait pas revivre les sacrifices de Verdun et du Chemin des Dames.

Ceci explique la "dr?le de guerre" : l'inactivit de l'arme fran?aise entre septembre 1939 et mai 1940,alors que l'arme allemande tait occupe en Pologne.

De plus l'equipement et les renseignement dont ils disposaient taient pitoyables (des compagnies francaises entires ne disposaient pas de cartes de la region et devait achets des plans lambdas dans les commerces locaux!!).  Par ailleurs le front francais tait iravitallable, les collones de rfugis belges et hollandais envahissent les routes fran?aises qui deviennet vite bloqus et donc impraticable pour les troupes.  Autre raison de cette dfaite et a mon avis l'une des principale fut la non conviction de la france dans ce conflit:  -Une arme qui doit subir un hiver trs rigoureux juste avant l'invasion et qui casse le morale des troupes    -Une population qui ne voulait pas subir la guerre et qui s'est enfuit (au moment de l'invasion allemande pratiquement aucune resistance n'a t percu de la part de la population civil)    - Un gouvernement qui lui non plus n'a jamais voulu vraiment rentr en conflit mme au moment ou s'tait critique. De plus il est rstait dans l'immobilisme le plus total    Bref une demoralisation complte face a une arme allemande surentrain, endoctrin et super motiv...    En clair je dirait qu'il y'avait trop d'elements en compte pour que l'on puisse dire qu'il aurait fallu faire tel ou tel chose pour changer la face du conflit. Cette opration avait t soigneusement prpar par Hitler et mme si tous ne s'tait pas pass comme prvu il aurait de tout de manire gagn sachant qu'il avait plusieurs cordes  son arc pour dstabiliser la France.|`|4f02404b9a75c7c2a1fd2a4a388ce4b6aa	On aurait pu viter la deuxime guerre mondiale si on avait couter le Marchal Ptain (je prcise bien en 1918) qui proposait aux forces allies de pntrer en force jusqu' Berlin et d'occuper l'Allemagne pour y former une Rpublique dmocratique un peu  l'image de ce qui s'est pass aprs 1945.  Malheuresement le Marchal Foch a refus cette option.  En ce qui concerne ta question, si la France avait utilis l'arme arienne (+ de 3000 units) bien qu'ancienne sur l'avance mcanise Allemande, en particulier, bombardement incessant sur les ponts et traverses fluviales, il en aurait t peut-tre une autre paire de manche que la promenade allemande.

IKnmaRKHaa	The book never actually says when Glaedr dies, so I'll just type from when Oromis gets hit, to when Glaedr goes, "Alone!" Oh, and this is two pages, so it's not really an "easy" ten points....    "And just as Oromis began to recover, Glaedr felt Zar'roc slash Oromis from shoulder to hip.  Glaedr howled.  He howled as Oromis had howled when Glaedr lost his leg.  An inexorable force gathered inside of Glaedr's belly. Without pausing to consider whether it was possible, he pushed Thorn and Murtagh away with a blast of magic, sending them flying like windblown leaves, and then tucked his wings against his sides and dove toward Gil'ead. If he could get there fast enough, then Islanzadi and her spellcasters would be able to save Oromis.  The city was too far away, though. Oromis's consciousness was faltering... fading... slipping away...  Glaedr poured his own strength into Oromis's ruined frame, trying to sustain him until they reached the ground. But for all the energy he gave to Oromis, he could not stop the bleeding, the terrible bleeding.  Glaedr... release me, Oromis murmered with his mind.  A moment later, in an even fainter voice, he whispered, Do not mourn me.  And then the partner of Glaedr's life passed into the void.  Gone.  Gone!  GONE!  Blackness. Emptiness.  He was alone.  A crimson haze descended over the world, throbbing in unison with his pulse. He flared his wings and looped back the way he had come, searching for Thorn and his Rider. He would not let them escape; he would catch them and tear at the, and burn them until he had eradicated them from the world.  Glaedr saw the red-shrike-dragon diving toward him, and he roared his grief, and redoubled his speed. The red dragon swerved at the last moment, in an attempt to flank him, but he was not fast enough to evade the dragon's tail. A fountain of blood sprayed from the stump. Yelping in agony, the red dragon wriggled away and darted behind Glaedr. Glaedr started to twist around to face him, but the smaller dragon was too quick, too nimble. Glaedr felt a sharp pain at the base of his skull, and then his vision flickered and failed.  Where was he?  He was alone.  He was alone and in the dark.  He was alone and in the dark, and he could not move or see.  He could feel the minds of other creatures close by, but they were not the minds of Torn and Murtagh but of Arya, Eragon, and Saphira.  And then Glaedr realized where he was, and the true horror of the situation broke upon him, and he howled into the darkness. He howled and he howled, and he abandoned himself to his agony, not caring what the future might bring, for Oromis was dead, and he was alone.  Alone!"

I didn't because the ones I always got didn't go to my toes and seemed to cut into the sides of my feet. So now, I suffer every day with the muscle cramps/spasms.

AA12339318	A lot would depend on the kind of mirror, and what it might be mounted on.    In general, a mirror would shatter into long, sharp shards like an ordinary piece of house window glass.  But, if the mirror were glued onto a wooden, or some other kind of surface, it might hold toghether better.    The example in our link may not actually be a mirror, or, even regular glass.  If some hard object were thrown onto a piece of automotive safety glass, it would make a pattern similar to the one in your example.  Safety glass is actually two pieces of glass with a layer of glue sandwiched between.  The sandwich construction makes the glass stronger and the glue helps keep the glass together so that it makes the typical "spiderweb" cracks you see in your picture.    There is no reason why a mirror can't be made from this kind of safety glass, and, there may actually be some.    I can suggest that your illustration can be even more striking if you would depict the knife sticking out of the cracked mirror.  Since logic tells us that the glass should shatter, your image showing that it didn't would add a more "mysterious" quality to the illustration.|`|fwEf8BxMaa	No, It looks more like it was punched|`|uF8MLIh7aa	i think it would look like the picture you put|`|MNaT8eKCaa	the mirror completely shatters!  the pic you put is a car front window that has been hit by a stone or something heavy!|`|AA11488628	depends on what the mirror is made of but it would break in a spider pattern around the blade and shatter most of it off but what is around the edge assuming you hit it in the middle.
naAjeYOwaa	The Great Awakening was a religious movement in the US that helped bring people closer to an intimate relationship with God in the colonies. Its important because it helped the colonists realize that the British didn't have a right to rule them and had a huge influence in the Revolutionary war.

48nbNNSbaa	My definition of consciousness is one from a scientific perspective that includes varying degrees of consciousness. A minimal definition of consciousness would be the ability to react (even involuntarily) to perceived circumstances created from sensory input.

5SCFTXAsaa	Hey! Just relax my friend. I've encountered this before and I struggled with it as well. The thing you need to do is further subdivide these signatures in more easily manageable configurations. Simply put, slice them in half as well as you can. 12/8 for example.     12/8=12 8th notes right?  a way we can subdivide even further is by cutting this in half to  6/8=6 8th notes  2 measures of 6/8 = one measure of 12/8.  So, instead of counting 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 you can count  1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6 for that same measure sort of like triplets      The same goes for 9/8  9/8=9 8th notes right?  We can cut 9 into 3rds making  3/8=3 8th notes  Add them up again and 3 measures of 3/8 = one measure of 9/8  This way instead of counting 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  You can count 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 again like triplets    Now the really tricky one  15/8=15 8th notes  The fastest way to make this even would be dividing the measure into  6/8, 6/8, and 3/8  Now, instead of counting 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15  It becomes easier to count 1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3 like triplets.    I know that this is written in a pretty confusing way but read it through a few times and it will click. Once you understand how to count, it comes easier through practice and repitition. And if you're an under-classmen, don't be afraid to ask the older students for help. They, I'm sure, went through it as well. Good Luck!|`|k39bNUgeaa	Just think of 12/8 like 4/4. Its like 8th note triplets, 3 notes per beat which would be 12 taps in a measure.    9/8 is like 3/4. with 8th note triplets and 3 beats per note. There would be 9 taps in a measure
bPd7llYuaa	well, industrialization in the U.S. between 1860 and 1900 did not happen rapidly compared to Britain's Industrial Revolution. But the causes of the industrialization was America's need to keep up with Britain, which was booming with success from textile factories. Britain attempted to keep its blueprints to its factories a secret, but it eventually leaked into the U.S. and so factories started popping up in American cities. Samuel Slater, known as the "Father of the Factory System" was the one who brought the floor plans for the factories from Britain to the States. Eventually the factories spread and American industry began to grow slowly but surely.     Problems that occurred was the issue of discrimination against immigrants, primarily Irish immigrants. When the factories first started business, factory owners hired orphan children and women to work day and night. Conditions were horrible for the workers. When the potato famine occurred in Ireland and a wave of Irish immigrants came to the U.S. they were desperate for work and would work for low salaries and under the worst conditions. So big factory cities (primarily Chicago) became known as the second Manchester (a factory establishment in Britain where workers were worked to death and treated like animals) hope this helps, you could just google it to find out more|`|pF63IMyVaa	the industrial revolution. machines were invented to help production in factories,rail roads were built.|`|9e77404f1b1466f949fb44ab9c0373d9aa	Tariffs placed on foreign goods increased internal trade. That accompanied with a rapid growth in immigration and population which increased by 3 times in this period helped trade flourish within the country. As railroads were built new natural resources were able to be transported faster and workers were brought in at an increased rate. New technology increased mass production in many industry's, this lowered prices and increased the quantity of available goods. The idea of laisses-faire fueled this all

I guess you have never been stuck between two guys before. Did you even read the series? She has a problem with marriage because of her mother. If you had grew up being told that marriage was bad or scary you would feel the same way about it. If you did not notice bella is shy and does not feel comfortable with lots of attention. the wedding would only bring attention. Honey I would say you need to read the books again in a few years.|`|fFu68XjDaa	yeah a bit but she says in the book how she knows shes selfish and she didn't date jacob btw|`|cshHLITPaa	I find that she is selfish at times.  I find her being more aggravating when she is whining.  Like when she totally made out with Jacob in Eclipse.Just to keep him with her so he would not fight a fight.That was actually happening because of her.|`|XNshfOafaa	no ik what you mean i have read all of them i think that its 50/50 for bella and edward bc u know that you know edward leaves and not to hurt her but he knows whats gonna happen and bella she also does things like jacob this is what happen with the bella and edward making love issue bella wanted to make love but edward would only after they were married then bella sorta got his pint of view and was like ok well wait then edward was like no lets do it know so yeh confusing|`|rG7SQa21aa	yes he had to beg but i'm just happy bcuz they r happy and i cant wait until breaking dawn comes as a movie! i can't wait to see who they cast as renesmee|`|7iFCOQyPaa	i know she is just so selfish  i know she worried about her mom and dad but come on!!!|`|mqdkcHDFaa	You forgot whiny, needy, annoying, weak, etc.  I couldn't stand her.|`|UQLHTT7Faa	Who the hell are we talking about?|`|NwpGhT31aa	I don't think that she is selfish. She just don't like the whole "ceremony" idea.     She never actually dated Jacob. She just wanted to be friends, but he wanted more the that. Personally I think Jacob is selfish because even though he knew that she really loved Edward and would only be truly happy with Edward he still kept on trying to change her mind.|`|FNwYzjogaa	She is selfish but your first example shows something even more alarming. Edward used sex to manipulate her into marrying him. She didn't want to get married. Many people who have sex aren't ready for marriage, not everyone abides by the idea that sex is only for marriage.     Bella wouldn't let Jacob go. Every time he started to leave she yanked him back. She told him she just wanted to be friends with him but her behavior said other wise.     Roseylee- In the case of Edward and Bella very selfish. Bella knew him for a week before she decided she was in love with him, basically meaning she was in lust rather than love, she didn't know enough ot really love him. After barely knowing him she is willing to throw away her friends, family, life, ambitions, and possibly ruin the life of her family and Edward's family in the process. She couldn't see beyond her own lust to consider what she was doing to everybody else. Anything bad that happened in that book is her fault. Anyone who died died because Bella simply wouldn't listen to reason and leave Edward alone.|`|lCDo5CSAaa	no not selfish      exp:    she would have sacrificed herself 4 her family in twilight    and again in New moon    and again in Eclispe~|`|klPvo7iwaa	yes she is

NYU37jfGaa	The population of Brtiain expanded rapidly in the 18th century, and the old agricultural methods were no longer enough to sustain the population.  In 'Racing Pigs and Giant Marrows' Harry Pearson writes:    'The huge social changes that followed the industrial revolution set testing new problems for British farmers.  During that period Britain changed from an agrarian to an urban society.  In the late 1700s, 75 percent of the population lived in the coutnryside, but the balance was already shifting rapidly.  Prior to the upheavel, the bulk of British farming had been done by smallholders, cottagers and crofters.  It was subsistence farming, the mainstay of a peasant economy.  Most Britions had been, to a greater or lesser extent, self-sufficient when it came to food.  Now, sucked in to serve the manufactuers, living in the hastily built cities, they could no longer feed themselves.  The good news for landowners was that these recently converted urbanites had just about enough cash to pay someone else to do it for them.  which would have been easy enough had it not been for the fact that, amid upping sticks and heading for the dark Satanic mills and the roaring flames of the foundries, the population had somehow found time to double itself.      Profit and productivity now met the peasant in a battle for the countryside.  In order to boost output, thousands of Enclosure Acts, which transferred land from communal to individual ownership, were passed by Parliament.  Between 1702 and 1844 close to six million acres of Britain found its way into private hands.  The battle to feed the new urban population had wrought a change in rural life almost as great as that which had sparked the struggle in the first place.    Denied the common grazing on which they relied, harassed by landowners whose vast tracts of property entitled them to greater parish voting rights and who consequently controlled the distribution of newly enclosed land, the smallholders were crushed.  The option of self-employment having been withdrawn, they either moved to the towns and sought work with a manufacturer, or stayed put and took a job with the landowners who had driven them under.  A population that had once worked for itself now, in the main, worked for others.'

94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Brit/Canadian story.    I was at work during lunch eating an apple one day, when an older gentleman mentioned to me, "You know, that's a really nice apple.  I haven't had an apple since 1942."  And he told me about how when he was a young boy climbing a tree for apples, he heard an unidentifiable rat-tat-tat sound...Ignoring it, he continued to climb and pick away.  He might have been killed by what he heard - the strafing gunfire from German aircraft overhead - if his grandmother hadn't reached into the tree and snatched him away in time.|`|AA11441385	My uncle said he was only frightened once, from 1939 to 1945.|`|cVmMzrgraa	A bunch of allied soldiers cut off communications with their general and started slaughtering German guards at a Jewish death camp.|`|9Dd5gxWwaa	Italian story..    My grandfather, a soldier before the war, was forced to fight WITH Mussolini, and thus the fascist regime. Soon, he rebelled and fought against Mussolini. When Mussolini was killed, people thought: mission accomplished. However, soon after the Germans occupied Italy, and my grandfather fought against them. We drove from the south to the north of Italy in the same car, being part of the resistant movement. Ultimately, he got caught and was put into a soldier-camp in the North of Italy. Luckily, he survived and was soon released, so he has been able to tell these stories all his life :)

Yes, the rules of poetry can be stretched, or you could say there are no rules at all, but your poem just isn`t well-written...    Oh, also work on word choice, expand your vocaulary.

AA10729675	I am not an expert.  However, they all drank alcohol, except children.  Not because of the law, but out of common sense,  They had common sense and did not need a law for that.  Then one important, very important item:  Greek wine was very strong.  so they never drank it pure.  They always added water and even honey.  Roman wine was good but never as good as Gaul wine, so they prohibited Gauls from exporting their wine.  Romans drank until they were completely drunk.   China must have drunk alcohol made from rice.  And I guess only the rich could afford to buy such drink.  Indian people were never into drinking in India.  Sometimes they asked Greek kings to send them a bottle of wine, just to taste it and maybe for exceptional occasions.  I tink that we understand their history better as after all the making of alcohol is part of economy, like the Gauls who could not export their wine and make money out of it!  It shows what was grown in the fields and who was cultivating those fields and what kind of materials they used for the barrels of alcohol, and how they loved to always refine their products.  It shows events for drinking: festival, public dances, times to rejoice like the harvest festival.  It shows that they were open minded and that they could enjoy the fruit of their labor, and the fruit of the fields they lived in.  There were great religious ceremonies around wine making in Greece, or beer making in Germany.  It was a gift from the gods.  It was part of their culture and identity.  It was sacred.  Wine was sacred.  In the Bible wine is the symbol of life, of strength, of joy.    However, the drinking was also moderate.  There is a Greek text, very ancient, warning about the dangers of too much drinking.  Some populations nowadays do not relate to this sacred aspect of alcohol.  They see it as very bad, because they are ignorant of the moderation part of it.  Further more, our alcohol nowadays is full of sulphur and chemicals.  So it is not as it used to be.  Ancient populations had a hard life.  Yet they knew how, when, and to what extent to rejoice with music, dances, and moderate drinking of alcohol.  Of course, there always were those who went overboard.    It is those people who went overboard, who could not refrain, who had no common sense, who now have made a bad reputation to something that once was sacred.  By the year 1500, alcohol making became an industry.|`|NmvaEmKBaa	Sumer decided that life was hard, so they invented beer. It proves that humans are good problem solvers.

It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	First of all, I think that's awesome that you're interested in traditional photography.  I learned how to develop my own film and prints about a year ago, and now I use almost entirely film for all my pictures.  I have a digital camera, but I just use it for snapshots when I'm out with my friends.  For REAL photography, I prefer to use 35mm and 120 film.  I have a collection of vintage manual film cameras, and there is just something a lot more fun about using a real, metal, mechanical camera.    And like you said, the whole process is just more interesting and hands-on.  I like being able to hold a negative in my hand and see my pictures on something that's real and tangible...instead of just being locked into a bunch of binary code on a computer.    I think your best bet to display and sell your photos might be to just set up your own website from scratch.  It's not that hard to do, and there are a million website hosting services you can use that are cheap.  I use Yahoo Geocities.  They have a free website hosting service, but I upgraded to the paid hosted service to get more space.  Websites like Flickr, Photobucket, and DeviantArt are okay...but the problem is that they're sort of more for social networking.  Also, most people assume that all the pictures on those websites are snapshots from a digital camera.  You need to make your own website and emphasize that your pictures are REAL silver-gelatin darkroom prints, NOT just images printed from a computer.         A lot of people probably have no idea what a REAL darkroom print looks like from film, so that can be a major selling point.  Not only is it a unique, more artistic process, but a real optical print from an enlarger is much sharper and more detailed than any picture from a digital camera.    So, make your own website and emphasize all the qualities of your prints.  Talk about your subjects, your techniques, what kind of camera you use.  In short, emphasize the fact that your photography is ART.  Distguish it from all the other websites just showing snapshots from digital cameras.  If someone wants to buy one of your pictures, they will be buying a print that YOU hand-developed.    Also, you might want to ask around at some local businesses in your area and see if any of them might be interested in displaying your pictures.  I've been able to get some of my landscape photos displayed in a few of the coffee shops and restaurants where I live.  Then leave a business card, in case any of their customers see your pictures and might be interested in a print.    Good luck!|`|QVZDhgAqaa	www.deviantart.com|`|GOLGzmt8aa	big question   Friends   Work place   ebay  from a web site  market stall   gallary  the list goes on feel free to contact me   Mike

kTNz1VJuaa	I had good success using stainless steel tube fittings.    Never use copper or brass - you'll be inhaling copper fumes.    The auto parts store will have brake tubing in various lengths and if they don't have one short enough you can cut it. Brake tubing is almost always stainless.    Your hardware store will have a "reducer" fitting where the small end will fit the fitting on the tube and the large end is big enough for a reasonable bowl.    Another possibility is to carve a bowl from a hard wood, such as oak, briar or mesquite. Soft woods burn up too quickly so you inhale the wrong kind of smoke.    Also, use stainless steel screen in your bowls - again, copper gives off fumes that are more harmful than your herbs.    I used to cut cedar bushes on Grandma's farm and whittle down the white part of the wood until only the dark red heart wood was left. I would carve pipes from that and everyone liked the aroma. With most wood, the harder it is to carve, the better it is for pipe making.|`|wvPwc4PGaa	your probably best getting a cheap bong and using the gauze etc of that, i had a friend who did this and it worked like a charm...google images homemade bong it willprobably give u inspiration

C77c0OE2aa	Unfortunately, blur is one thing that cannot be corrected in photo editing software. NO software can do this, regardless of what anyone may tell you. A blurred digital photo is comprised of pixels that have captured and recorded this off focus information as correct. Software cannot make something out of nothing. It all thinks this is a perfect photo. There is no "hidden" sharpness there to "find". Software cannot focus your camera for you. It would be the same as taking a photo of a person with a piece of cardboard over their face, then expecting photo editing software to be able to remove the cardboard and display the face. It just does not work that way. The photo is what it is. Remove the cardboard and there is nothing there... there is no face hiding behind the cardboard in the photo. Same with a blurred photo... there is no sharpness data there, and software is not going to magically create it.    Post editing software is not the end all, cure all for all poorly taken photos. It is still, and always will be, important to get the photo correct in the camera in the beginning. Software can help improve some things and even create the illusion of more sharpness... BUT... there still has to be good, basic, sharp image data in the beginning.    steve|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Sorry there is nothing you can really do to it since it's out of focu    if you try to fix it, it doesn't look real anymore|`|dab4124f2e4e0f76ec389b9302ad7a62aa	Very lovely photo, however... with such a large area of blurr, I don't think there is a chance of saving this photo. You wouldn't be able to make out many features on the face. (It would seem like dark blobs!)|`|AA12339318	I have to agree with the responses already given.  No application can fix a blurry or too low a resolution.    The only thing that MIGHT be done would be for someone to go back in and virtually "paint" the details back in. Unfortunately, most results would tend to look EXTREMELY artificial.  It would take an expert to do it right and it could not be done in any hurry.  In other words, if you could FIND an expert willing to try, it would cost you a LOT of money.  More likely, because the entire photo is so badly blurred, no one would would probably be willing to take it on.

n71t0xoCaa	Its really tough to get good bokeh with a point and shoot due to the small sensor size. Set the aperature at the largest setting you can on aperature priority mode if your camera has one, zoom the lens out as far as it will go. Large aperature and long focal length both reduce the depth of field. Then have some distance between your subject and the background.     I hope this helps and good luck|`|JXc0O8G9aa	The Bokeh you would create with your camera won't complete with what people get when using an SLR because your sensor is much smaller.    I saw a good site pertaining to this a while ago, but I can't find it now.  Essentially it comes down to the amount of information the sensor captures.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	You can do this on a point-and-shoot with close-up subjects.  Stick your camera onto macro mode, focus on your close-up object to be sharp, then move the camera to the desired framing position while keeping your object there.    Below is a link explaining Bokeh and how it is normally achieved
w13Zbnk7aa	The National Assembly tried to pacify the aroused peasantry. A leader of the National Assembly announced the end of feudalism. They were pacified for the time being.   Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen - Very similar to American Declaration of Independence. Natural Rights - liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. Sovereigntysupreme authorityrested with the nation as a whole, not the monarchy. Freedom of opinion (religion included), freedom of press, and freedom from arbitrary arrest. In 1792, this spirit lead Jews from old legal disabilities. This gave women some new freedoms too, but only men gained full freedom.   Declaration of the Rights of Women - these arguments feel upon deaf ears.     Louis refused to sign the August decrees and once again assembled troops around Versailles and Paris (new threat of force). Women, just as angry as the men about hunger and struggle, marched 11 miles towards Versailles. With the help of the National Guard, they forced the royal family to accompany them back to Paris (Bringing them closer to the people and away from isolation and towards reality).The National Assembly moved to Paris.    The new government linked their financial system to the Catholic Church. To pay for its expenditures, the National Assembly issued what amounted to paper money called assignats. Government officials took church property to pay off debt and bring the church under governmental control. Monasteries and convents were dissolved and it became against the law to take religious vows. People would elect the clergy and they would be paid by the state. Clergy took an oath of allegiance to perform functions and gain their salary. Many refused to take this oath resulting in a division between France's Catholic population.     He negotiated the Treaty of Campo Formio with Austria (recognizing France expansion and the creation of the Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy. This victory made people believe he was a great leader.     Napoleon made peace with the pope and repaired the split between France and Catholicism. Their Concordat of 1801 declared this faith the religion of the majority of people in France. There was freedom for Protestants too. Rights were granted to Jews. The oath of allegiance was enacted again. Confiscated property was never returned. The Civil Code of 1804 (the Napoleonic Code) affirmed the Enlightenment-inspired legal reforms that early revolutionaries sought. Men thought this gave them rights (less than before, however), catering to middle class employers, but it was a clear defeat for women.     In 1800, he crossed the Alps with French troops to crush Austrian forces in Northern Italy and knock Austria out of the coalition. He made peace with Russia and persuaded Great Britain to sign the Treaty of Amiens in 1802.   After Napoleon became emperor, England and France began fighting again (1803).     Napoleon's subjects rose up against him. On May 3, 1808 citizens were brutally executed in retaliation for riots against French troops in Madrid (The Madrid Rebellion). Napoleon had to annex Holland because the opposed him so much so he would bring the rest of France under control.|`|AA10729675	Then in 1789 (to continue after asdf) the winter had been harsh, in Paris.  Terrible winter and no more dogs left to eat.  No bread.  Anger grew and on July 14, 1789, the people of Paris seized the prison where the king put his prisoners, that was the Bastille.  After that came a big blood bath.  A horrible time in History.  Not only horrible but boring, with the Montagnards, and other groups in Paris.  And a terrible man called Robespierre who managed to kill other revolutionaries and finally got killed too.  It was grotesque, it was gruesome.  It was a shame for France.  Many lost their heads, literally, under the blades of the guillautines.  And even the guillautine was invented to stop the horrible sight of people whom the ax had not completely killed.  It was invented by a physician, Dr, Guillautin.  People also would snitch on their personal foes.  That was a period of delation.    But after that came the time of serious reforms.  They were all brought about by Napoleon after the Revolution.  Please google them.|`|AA12375660	- From 1791 there was an elected Legislative Assembly to pass laws  - The king was to be called the King of the French instead of the King of France  - The old administrative areas and dioceses were abolished and 83 new departments were created

AA12339318	The problem with the applications that are "easy" to use is that the easier it is to use, the less it can do.    The top of the line apps, like Adobe Photohop are complicated and with a steep learning curve BECAUSE they can do so much and provide multiple ways to acheive the same effect.    Artists don't spend four, five and six hundred dollars for a software just because it is difficult to learn.  They buy it because it can do so much to provide that "pro like" result.    That's also why we spend money to make sure we have, not only Photoshop, but Illustrato, InDesign, Flash, Dreamweaver and many others.  Each of these, while haveing a few functions in common with some of the others, has their own particular uses.  Pros like to use the right tool for the specific job.

d6e49b1115d1cedb4a2f8698a60cdd24aa	la de canada tiene una hoja de maple o arce, que es el arbol nacional, o simbolo nacional|`|73c0848643a85ced3eee325b54f85358aa	Dos bandas verticales de color rojo a los costados sobre un fondo blanco, el cual tiene en el centro una hoja de maple; los colores oficiales de Canad son el rojo y el blanco.  La funcin de una bandera es transmitir un mensaje. Una bandera nacional enva un mensaje de nacionalidad. Por lo que, la bandera es uno de los smbolos grficos ms importantes, despus, claro del primer smbolo en importancia, a nivel lingstico: su nombre.    Despus de casi un Siglo de la Confederacin, los canadienses no tenan una bandera. Aunque existan varias banderas gubernamentales que representaban a Canad como estado, no haba una bandera formal que representase a los canadienses; es decir, que representara a una Nacin.    Esta omisin no fue resultado de una indiferencia por parte de los Canadienses hacia la posesin de una bandera, todo lo contrario. Fue resultado de un sentimiento de deseo por smbolos que los identificaran como Canadienses. El problema en la eleccin de la bandera fue la incapacidad en los acuerdos en cuanto al establecimiento de una identidad simblica comn.    En retrospectiva, la eleccin de un smbolo fue inevitable, ya que el pensar en una hoja de maple en la actualidad, es pensar en Canad.    Mientras el castor era un smbolo preeminente durante el Siglo XVIII, su valor simblico junto con su valor econmico, se desplomaron en el Siglo XIX. No slo el comercio de pieles fue desplazado en Montreal despus del amalgamiento del Noroeste y las Compa?as de Hudson Bay, sino que tambin el comercio de la piel de castor fue desplazado con la llegada de la seda. Lo cual dio lugar para que la hoja de maple quedase como smbolo preeminente en Canad.    En 1836, tienne Parent adicion hojas de maple al encabezado de su peridico, Le Canadien, lo que asegur algo que ya era obvio casi para todos: que era la hoja de maple la que quedara como emblema de Canad. As, comenz a aparecer en banderas no formales en Canad.    Despus de la Confederacin, el pas obtuvo su primer bandera oficial y distintiva: la Bandera General de Gobierno, adoptada en 1870, la cual tena al centro una especie de conjunto de hojas de maple. Eventualmente, justo antes de su centenario, el pas obtuvo su bandera oficial y exclusiva: la Bandera Nacional, levantada en 1965, con slo una hoja de maple al centro.    Sin embargo, esto llev varios a?os de acuerdos y decisiones, as como consensos entre la poblacin y el gobierno. Dichas controversias tienen sus races en dos dicotomas por separado: una interna y otra externa. La dicotoma interna se encontraba en la ambigua lealtad por la que los Canadienses dividan a la nacin y al imperio. La dicotoma externa resida en la utilizacin de banderas en Inglaterra y los Estados Unidos.    En trminos generales, es as como surge la simbologa para una bandera, en base a la riqueza de recursos naturales y al comercio en un principio, es decir, algo que identificase un poco ms al pueblo canadiense.    La bandera de Blgica contiene tres bandas verticales iguales de color *****, amarillo y rojo; el dise?o vertical est basado en la bandera de Francia, mientras que los colores fueron tomados del Ducado de Brabante. Las proporciones inusuales de la bandera (13:15) son de origen desconocido.    La bandera fue adoptada oficialmente el 23 de enero de 1831, luego de la independencia belga del Reino Unido de los Pases Bajos en 1830. La bandera jug un rol importante durante la revolucin y los colores de la bandera sirvieron como recordatorio de una vieja bandera con bandas horizontales usada durante una revuelta anterior en 1789 poca en que los Pases Bajos estaban bajo dominio austraco.

El rojo y blanco fueron tomados de la monarqua britnica, son los colores que representan la unin, principio bsico de la nacin canadiense. La hoja de arce se empez a usar en 1860, cuando el prncipe de Gales visit Canad, y viendo a los de origen ingls vestir una rosa, los de origen escocs un cardo, los canadienses decidieron vestir una hoja de arce. Se hizo esto tan popular que en la 1era Guerra Mundial la gran mayora de los batallones canadienses tenan la hoja de arce en su insignia.

Me parece que el cine colombiano tiene un complejo de subdesarrollo que limita su temtica a lo suburbano y slo habla de esa parte oscura, que es precisamente la que buscamos acabar.    De las pelculas colombianas slo puedo recomendar una. Se llama "Los Ni?os Invisibles" del director Lisandro Duque, la nica que no cuenta con ese elemento de violencia al que muchos directores colombianos se han limitado.

38a636252c3dfa62b74a78560926dd7baa	Dieu a cr l'homme " son image", d'une fa?on souveraine. Il souffla en lui une "respiration de vie" et l'homme devint ainsi une "ame vivante".   Cette particularit distingue l'homme de toutes les autres cratures. L'homme possde une intelligence incomparable, une volont individuelle, une capacit d'apprcier, de choisir, d'inventer, de communiquer, d'aimer...    Cr parfait, moralement et physiquement, Dieu a voulu pour l'homme ce qui tait "trs bon". Il le pla?a dans un environnement agrable, lui confia des responsabilits importantes, et la possibilit de vivre dans sa communion ou de se dtourner de lui. Ainsi nanti et instruit des consquences de ses choix, l'homme tait devenu une crature responsable.    Do sa chute :    La chute (Gense 2 et 3 )  Pourquoi l'tre humain, ayant tout  satit, a-t-il voulu la seule chose que Dieu ne lui avait pas permise, et dont il n'avait pas besoin?    La tactique de la tentation peut se rsumer en 3 points:   Satan (l'Adversaire) jette le doute sur ce que Dieu a dit,   Il ment en ce qui concerne les consquences de la dsobissance,   Il laisse entendre que Dieu le prive de quelque chose de bon.   Contre toute attente Adam et Eve firent confiance  Satan plut?t qu' Dieu.    Ils se dtournrent ainsi de leur Crateur pour couter une crature et eurent  supporter, ainsi que leur descendance, les lourdes consquences de leur dsobissance.|`|0de5cc0e990df06cca762b7837fda03aaa	Ce n'est pas Dieu qui a cr l'homme, c'est l'homme qui a cr Dieu.

Le monotheisme ne date que d'Amenophis IV, mieux connu sous le nom d'Akhenathon, c'est  dire 13  14 sicles avant la datation chretienne, avant c'etait le polytheisme qui prevalait. Et les Egyptiens, les Babyloniens, les Pheniciens, bref tous ces peuples croyant en plusieurs dieux, n'en etaient pas moins des Hommes cultivs et pieux, autant  que nous le sommes.

My friend Annie started ballet when she was 3 and got on pointe when she was 5. I started wen I was 10 and went on pointe when I was 11. My dance teacher believes in awarding ability.

He was just being careful, and it was worth it because as soon as I got them, it was SO easy to do everything! :)|`|SoXziaySaa	I've been dancing for 7 years, and I'd only taken "theatre dance" classes up until this year, basically just Broadway-style dance. I decided to start ballet so I started in what my school calls "Ballet for Broadway", which is a class for about 10 year olds to teens who either haven't done ballet before or haven't done it in a long time. I started off in that class, then jumped up 4 levels after two classes because my teacher believed i was too advanced. So now, I'm in a ballet 3 class and I got onto pointe this year.  So, in conclusion, I'm 15 and I started ballet this year, and I am on pointe.

Adorei.    Vou at copiar e arquivar.    Eu tb gostei dessa:    Perguntei a um sbio,  a diferen?a que havia  entre amor e amizade,  ele me disse essa verdade...  O Amor  mais sensvel,  a Amizade mais segura.  O Amor nos d asas,  a Amizade o ch?o.  No Amor h mais carinho,  na Amizade compreens?o.  O Amor  plantado  e com carinho cultivado,  a Amizade vem faceira,  e com troca de alegria e tristeza,  torna-se uma grande e querida  companheira.   Mas quando o Amor  sincero  ele vem com um grande amigo,  e quando a Amizade  concreta,  ela  cheia de amor e carinho.  Quando se tem um amigo  ou uma grande paix?o,  ambos sentimentos coexistem  dentro do seu cora??o.

As muitas dificuldades que essa diversidade de termos oferece, em conjunto  suposta unidade de significado, ocorrem n?o s nos idiomas modernos, mas tambm no grego e no latim.

Mas sei que a excelncia do amor est em cada defini??o sua e que nunca o seu conceito absoluto caber numa palavra. O amor tudo desculpa, tudo cr, tudo espera, tudo suporta. Inspira??o dos poetas e dos amantes  a manifesta??o real do pensamento e da emo??o.  gerador de desejo e de sensa??es inexplicveis. Sensa??es sublimes, enleadas num turbilh?o de quest?es sem resposta, de palavras afirmadas. Como demonstrar que alguns nos podem provocar, por dentro, um grito faminto por mais um momento? Como podemos deixar de querer mais e sempre mais, se  o sonho que o amor satisfaz, a ternura que nos traz a paz? Espanto-me com esta incapacidade de o definir, mas talvez tudo se resuma quilo que sentimos ou que queremos ouvir de quem amamos. Que tortura estonteante  o amor que, por vezes, nos distrai de tudo o resto e nos faz querer voar... Pasmo-me em descobrir e decifrar esse t?o nobre sentimento e at me esque?o, numa parcela de espa?o indefinido, que no tempo, o amor, na verdade, nunca  de ningum. Porque cada um o possui dentro de si. Vejo que mesmo roubando ao tempo o momento, a loucura est nele contida, nesse sentimento imenso que perdura. A grandeza de um cora??o mede-se pela sua capacidade de amar. A grandeza das pessoas est na sua sensibilidade e esta, realmente, n?o se mede como n?o se mede o amor que mora no nosso cora??o. No fundo, para mim, o amor  poesia e ser como gostar de nos sentarmos a presenciar o voo agitado das aves quela hora em que a noite principia a sobressaltar a claridade do dia e elas lamentam todo o azul que n?o voaram...

Indudablemente se puede confundir uno, especialmente si se tiene prejuicios o una mala experiencia con algn mal representante de la Iglesia y tenemos la tendencia innata a generalizar injustamente; pero es bastante aburrido y cansa leer siempre las mismas respuestas faltas de toda coherencia, conocimiento, lgica, deduccin e imparcialidad.|`|rt5xoVZeaa	Por que la iglesia sabia que si apoyaba a los politicos salian beneficiados y ademas miraban por su bien ya que si se oponian era nocivo para ellos, desde mi punto de visto todo esto en la antigedad, por ejemplo en  1800  la nobleza regalaba tierras a la iglesia por estar de su lado.

dtoeqgtUaa	abraham por los israelitas y moisese por los 10 mandamientos de la ley de Dios|`|7Zdz95CMaa	Se sabe con certeza que abraham y David existieron porque sus nombres aparecen en las tablas de Ebla,Ebla fue una civilizacin descubierta en 1975,que comprenda Siria y el sur de Turqua,y en esos escritos se menciona a David y Abraham,Sodoma y Gomorra antes de la aparicin de la tora,tambin est comprobado el la estada del pueblo judo en Egipto,comprobados estos 2 temas es muy fcil deducir que la existencia de Moises es verdadera ,como pregunta sera interesante saber que pruebas hay de la existencia de Cristo,acerca delas tablas de Ebla dejo este informe: Fechadas aproximadamente 2500 a?os A.C, las tablas de Ebla nos brindan una importante informacin con respecto a la historia de las religiones.    El aspecto mas importante de las Tablas de Ebla, descubiertas por arquelogos en 1975 y que han sido objeto de investigacin y debate desde entonces, contienen los nombres de tres de los profetas que se mencionan en las sagradas escrituras.    El descubrimiento tras miles de a?os de las Tablas de Ebla y la informacin que estas contienen es extremadamente importante para la esclarificacin de la localizacin geogrfica de las sociedades reveladas en el Corn.    Aproximadamente 2500 a?os A.C, Ebla era un reinado que comprenda a Siria capital de Damasco y el sudeste de Turqua.    Este reinado, alcanz su cumbre econmica y cultural, pero posteriormente como ha pasado a otras grandes civilizaciones desapareci del escenario histrico. El reinado de Ebla, segn los datos obtenidos, era aparentemente el mayor centro cultural y comercial de la poca. (1) La poblacin de Ebla fue una civilizacin que estableci archivos estatales, construy bibliotecas y registr contratos comerciales de forma escrita. Incluso tuvo su propia lengua llamada "eblaita ".    Historias de Religiones Muertas    La verdadera importancia del reinado de Ebla, es considerada como un gran suceso para la arqueologa clsica a partir de su descubrimiento en 1975, cuando se descubren 20.000 tablas y fragmentos cuneiformes.    Este hallazgo fue cuatro veces mas importante que todos los textos cuneiformes hallados hasta la fecha por los arquelogos con respecto a los ltimos 3.000 a?os.    Cuando la lengua utilizada en las tablas fue descifrada por el italiano Giovanni Pettinato, epgrafo de la Universidad de Roma, la magnitud de su importancia fue mejor comprendida. Como resultado de esto, el hallazgo del reinado de Ebla y su magnifico archivo estatal, cobra importancia no solo para los intereses arqueolgicos, sino tambien para el inters de los circulos religiosos.    Esto era debido a que junto a los nombre de Michael (Mi- ka-il) y Talut (Sa-u-lum), quien lucho junto al Profeta David, contienen tambin los nombres de los profetas mencionados en los tres sagrados libros: El Profeta Abraham (Ab-ra-mu), el Profeta David (Da-u-dum) y el Profeta Ismael (Ish-ma-il). (2).    La importancia de los nombres en las Tablas de Ebla    Los nombres de los profetas identificados en las Tablas de Ebla son de gran importancia a la vez que era la primera vez que se haban hayado en documentos histricos de tal antiguedad. La aparicin en las tablas del nombre del Profeta Abraham certifica que el Profeta Abraham y la religin traida por l existi con anterioridad a la Tora.    Los historiadores analizan las tablas de Ebla desde esta perspectiva, y el mayor descubrimiento con respecto al Profeta Abraham y su misin, se ha convertido en objeto de investigacin en relacin con la historia de las religiones. David Noel Fredmann, arguelogo Americano e investigador de la historia de las religiones, confirma, basado en sus estudios, los nombres tanto del profeta Abraham como el de Ismael en las tablas.    Otros nombres en las Tablas    Como anteriormente hemos se?alado, los nombres de los profetas de las Tablas, son los que los tres sagrados libros hacen referencia, y las Tablas son mucho mas antiguas que la Tora.    Adems de estos nombres en las tablas se mencionan otros asuntos y nombres de lugares, de lo cual podemos comprobar que los eblaitas eran grandes comerciantes.    Los nombres de Sinai, Gaza y Jerusalem, no muy lejanos a Ebla, aparecen tambin en los textos, mostrando como los eblaitas poseian contactos comerciales y culturales con estos lugares. (4).    Un importante detalle que comprobamos en las Tablas son los nombres de Sodoma y Gomorra, donde vivio la gente de Lot. Es sabido que Sodoma y Gomorra era una regin a orillas del Mar Muerto donde la gente de Lot vivi y donde el profeta Lot comunic su mensaje llamando a su gente a vivir bajo unos valores religiosos.

Pero, a pesar de la cita del autor, no tengo documentacin bibliogrfica que apoye este argumento.    Siguiendo esta primera lnea terica, ahora, nos encontraramos con un personaje, prximo a Akhenaton, que quizs se llamase Ankmose, Thutmose o ?quin sabe!. Lo importante es que la segunda parte deba ser - mose; mientras que Thut o Tut, seguramente fuese un nombre muy comn en ese momento, pues as se llamaban algunos personajes de los que tenemos informacin, como por ejemplo, un escultor cuyo taller estaba en Tell- el- Amarna. Es posible que fuera gobernador de alguna provincia fronteriza, que se viese relegado a proscrito, cuando los ideales del soberano monotesta se fueran al traste. Esto quizs le impulsara a buscar una cierta "compensacin" ya no en Egipto, sino fuera de l; y tambin es posible, que para ello, aprovechara el contacto con alguna tribu semita, con quien mantuviera relaciones. Esto nos llevara a pensar que decidiera marcharse con sus nuevos "aliados", llegando incluso a sentirse uno de ellos, a quienes les terminara inculcando su propio culto y una legislacin. La dureza de las leyes que encontramos en el Deuteronomio y en el xodo podra explicarse desde esta perspectiva, por verse en un pueblo extra?o y tendente a las revueltas.    Y si fue un hombre encumbrado, es extra?o pensar que se uniese a un pueblo extranjero sin la compa?a de los suyos, sacerdotes, siervos, escribas, otros funcionarios, que formaran parte de una "elite", los llamados levitas, que pueden entenderse como los compa?eros de Moiss. Quizs, partidarios de la antigua doctrina de Atn, que consiguieran escapar de Egipto. Y es posible que de este grupo, originariamente egipcio, surgiera la posterior Tribu de Lev.    Pero, ?estuvieron los hebreos en Egipto?.    Segn la Biblia, los israelitas sufrieron un cautiverio de cuatrocientos treinta a?os (xodo 12,40), teniendo una informacin acerca de su fecha aproximada, en Reyes I, en el hecho de que Salomn empez las obras del Templo, cuatrocientos ochenta Alos despus de la salida de Egipto. Si, segn testimonios diversos, su construccin tuvo lugar en el a?o 970 a. Cristo, esto deja como fecha de un posible Moiss en tono al a?o 1450, y el momento de la llegada a Egipto, o sea, el del episodio de los los "patriarcas", en el a?o 1880 a. Cristo. Si estas fechas fuesen exactas, la salida de Moiss correspondera con la Dinasta XVIII, pero no con Akenathon, sino con alguien anterior, Tutmosis II, quien morira ese mismo a?o, y por tanto, lejsimo de la Dinasta de los Ramsidas, que los historiadores y exegetas de la Biblia pretenden situar.    Un detalle inapelable, echa por tierra las anteriores hiptesis, sin dar esperanzas a poder reanudar estos argumentos. El hecho de que la historia de El xodo bblico jams pudo sucederse, por la sencilla razn de que ?no haba judos en Egipto!. Si realmente se hubiera dado una poblacin semita, existiran testimonios de su presencia, restos de la cultura material que traeran consigo; hubieran aparecido nombrados en inscripciones egipcias o mencionados en las paredes de alguna tumba. No hay ni un slo testimonio arqueolgico, ni una sola mencin de Israel, con la excepcin de una famosa estela atribuida al faran Menerpaht, de la dinasta XIX, en donde se dice que "Israel ha sido vencida".( pero muy por encima de que uno cite cosas de historiadores o no la biblia bajo la lupa de la ciencia siempre ha sido veraz y recordemos que las ciudades heredaban los nombres de los patriarcas y aun que se les cambie los nombres se han comprobado su existencia.) y el hecho de que no se nombren en una cultura de esclavitud a los cuales se les ha tratado siempre como animales no es de extra?ar que no haya mencin de ellos. si sern tratados como animales que en pocas recientes aun se les revisaba los dientes igual como se hace con los caballos.  Ismael hijo de Abrahan fundo una ciudad si no existi por que apareci la tal  Descendientes de Ismael, y por ello mitad egipcios y mitad semitas (Gn. 16:1,  2, 15).  De Ismael nacieron 12 prncipes que llegaron a ser antepasados de  tribus (17:20; 25:12-16).  Estas vivieron en general una vida nmade, tan libre  como un "asno salvaje" del desierto (16:12, DHH).  Su hogar fue el desierto del  norte de Arabia y del este de Siria.  Sin embargo, algunas tribus rabes (los  nabateos) tuvieron fama y poder.  Como su antepasado (21:20), los Ismaelitas  fueron diestros arqueros (Is. 21:17).  Tambin lideraban las caravanas que  traan los productos de Arabia a Egipto y Mesopotamia (Gn. 37:25).  Con el  tiempo su nombre lleg casi a ser sinnimo de pueblos del desierto,  tal vez   porque se mezclaron con otras tribus, o porque eran los ms importantes y ms  notables habitantes de esas soledades.

MICHAEL MASSING. THE NEW YORK TIMES. ESPECIAL PARA CLARIN.  Abraham, el patriarca judo, tal vez nunca haya existido. Tampoco Moiss. Es ms, la historia del xodo tal cual se relata en la Biblia, quiz nunca ocurri. Lo mismo es vlido para la cada de los muros de Jeric. Y es muy probable que David, lejos de ser el rey intrpido que convirti a Jerusaln en una capital poderosa, haya sido un lder provincial cuya reputacin ms tarde se magnific para darle un empuje a una nacin en crisis. Estas propuestas bastante asombrosas, por cierto son producto de los hallazgos de arquelogos que vienen haciendo excavaciones en Israel y sus alrededores en los ltimos 25 a?os y que ganaron una amplia aceptacin entre los rabinos no ortodoxos.     La Sinagoga Unida del Judasmo Conservador, que representa al milln y medio de judos conservadores de EE. UU., acaba de publicar una nueva Tor (Antiguo Testamento), la primera para los conservadores en ms de 60 a?os. Se llama conservadora a una lnea dentro del judasmo que, aunque respetuosa de las normas, tiene una mirada algo ms amplia que les permite revisar las normas ms estrictas.    Bajo el nombre de Etz Hayim ("Arbol de la vida" en hebreo), la nueva Tor incorpora los ltimos hallazgos de la arqueologa, la filologa, la antropologa y el estudio de las culturas antiguas. Para los editores que trabajaron en el libro, se trata de uno de los esfuerzos ms slidos que se hayan hecho hasta el momento para introducir una visin de la Biblia como un documento humano.    "Cuando yo era chico, en Brooklyn, los fieles no eran demasiado sofisticados", dijo el rabino Harold Kushner, uno de los editores del nuevo libro. "Hoy leen mucho sobre psicologa, literatura e historia, pero siguen encerrados en una versin infantil de la Biblia".    Etz Hayim, compilada por David Lieber, de la Universidad del Judasmo en Los Angeles, intenta cambiar esta imagen: ofrece el texto hebreo estndar, una versin paralela en ingls, una exgesis pgina por pgina, comentarios peridicos sobre la prctica juda y, al final, 41 ensayos de rabinos y acadmicos prominentes sobre temas que van desde los rollos de la Tor y las leyes de alimentacin hasta la ecologa y la escatologa que, seguramente, sorprendern a muchos fieles.     Tal es el caso de un ensayo de Robert Wexler, presidente de la Universidad del Judasmo en Los Angeles, que, sobre la base del academicismo moderno, establece que es improbable que la historia del Gnesis haya tenido un origen en Palestina. Segn Wexler, es ms probable que haya surgido en la Mesopotamia, cuya influencia es ms evidente en la historia del diluvio, que probablemente fuera consecuencia del desborde peridico de los ros Tigris y Eufrates. Igualmente asombroso es el ensayo "Arqueologa bblica", de Lee Levine, profesor de la Universidad Hebrea de Jerusaln. "Las fuentes egipcias no hacen ninguna referencia a que el pueblo de Israel haya morado en ese pas", escribe, "y la evidencia que s existe es insignificante e indirecta".     La nocin de que la Biblia no es literalmente cierta "est ms o menos aceptada por los rabinos conservadores", observ David Wolpe, un rabino del Templo Sina en Los Angeles y colaborador en Etz Hayim. "Pero algunos fieles se sentirn molestos". En la ltima Pascua, ante 2.200 fieles en su sinagoga, el rabino Wolpe dijo que "prcticamente todos los arquelogos modernos coinciden en que la manera en que la Biblia describe el xodo no refleja la manera en que sucedi en realidad, si es que sucedi". El rabino habl de las contradicciones, improbabilidades, lapsus cronolgicos y la falta de evidencia comprobatoria de la narracin. En realidad, dijo, los arquelogos que excavan en el Sina "no encontraron ningn rastro de las tribus de Israel, ni un solo cacharro". La reaccin ante sus palabras fue mixta: muchos le manifestaron admiracin por su valenta y otros se indignaron por su audacia.    La evidencia acadmica que cuestiona la narrativa del xodo se volvi tan importante que las opiniones minoritarias se volvieron mayora. Pero no entre los judos ortodoxos, quienes siguen considerando a la Tor como la palabra divina e incuestionable de Dios. Lawrence Schiffman, profesor de la Universidad de Nueva York y judo ortodoxo, dijo que Etz Hayim va demasiado lejos y que, sin darse cuenta, termina siendo "oposicin nihilista" a lo que creen los judos conservadores.     Desde que se public, hace unos meses, Etz Hayim ya vendi ms de 100.000 ejemplares y muchos esperan que se convierta, finalmente, en la Biblia oficial de las 760 sinagogas conservadoras de Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, la longevidad de Etz Hayim tal vez dependa del ritmo de los descubrimientos arqueolgicos.    la verdad es algo q no se sabe pero bno...|`|EX1FKfP2aa	la biblia no es un libro de historia. solo son testimonios de fe. moises y abrahan existieron, pero todos los milagros que obro moises tienen explicacion cientifica que en aquella epoca no se sabia.|`|de7c6f4f03432a71ec10e5becc33ecc4aa	Uno de los descubrimientos arqueolgicos ms importantes son las Tablas de Ebla, fechadas entre los a?os 2,500 a 2000 a.C. y que contienen los nombres de Abraham, Ismael, Jerusaln, Sina,Sodoma y Gomorra, entre otros nombres y lugares bblicos.   Estos documentos son los ms antiguos que mencionan a personajes bblicos, incluso son ms antiguos que la Tora, y confirman la existencia de Abraham e Ismael, entre otros personajes bblicos. Asimismo, demuestran que el mensaje religioso que ellos difundieron se extendi por Siria, Mesopotamia, Israel, Turqua y Egipto, entre otras regiones.    Suerte.|`|qGdpJUCvaa	En el caso de Abraham, de este personaje solo existen referencias en la biblia en un tono mas bien mtico, seria como preguntar como sabriamos si Hrcules existio realmente. Es un personaje al que se le atribuyen determinados rasgos y cualidades con el fin de transmitir algun determinado mensaje o ense?anza (Abraham significa padre de errantes en hebreo, tuvo 12 hijos que fundaron las doce tribus de israel, etc) . Esto ocurre en el judaismo pero tambien en otras religiones orientales de pueblos semitas, como el Gilgamesh de los acadios, en cuya epopeya esta basado en gran parte el Noe de la tora, por ejemplo. No existe ningun documento historico de la poca ni ninguna fuente arqueologica que nos haga pensar que su historia este basada en una persona real. Respecto a lo de las tablas de Ebla, decir que para empezar NO HACEN REFERENCIA A NINGUN PROFETA, tan solo aparece algun nombre semita, como is-ma-il, por supuesto no como el profeta biblico, y ni siquiera Abraham sale mencionado, repito, el nombre de Abraham no sale mencionado en las tablas de Ebla, aunque hay muchas paginas de internet que mienten al respecto. Encima de todo las invasiones de nomadas amorreos conquistan mesopotamia sobre el a?o 1900-1800 a.c. , en el caso de que Abrahan, (que recuerdo, era un amorreo de la ciudad mesopotamica de Ur) sea un personaje real este seria uno de ellos, lo cual lo situa en una epoca posterior a la datacion de las tablas, aunque como ya he dicho dos veces mas, no aparece. Bueno tambien aparecen referencias a nombres de ciudades a las cuales tambien se les cita en la biblia, lo cual es normal ya que es muy probable que esas ciudades existieran realmente, lo cual no me parece una prueba de nada, nose.  Respecto a Moises, pues se podria decir lo mismo. No existen referencias de la poca que se le atribuye, ni hebreas ni egipcias ni de ningun tipo, sino que estas siempre son muy posteriores siendo la posibilidad de que estas referencias se basen en la tradicion judia. En definitiva, no hay informacion concluyente al respecto y la que hay nos apunta por otros derroteros. Haz tus propias conclusiones.  Bueno y por la fe puedes creer firmemente que estos son personajes historicos cuya realidad es similar a la que es narrada en la Biblia, eso si.|`|iHMA0se8aa	porque  est revelado en la biblia  la cual es la palabra de Dios  y el no miente por eso hay que creer.|`|BROWOvwHaa	Todo el que cree, piensa.

Claro esta que la relatividad de la existencia de los personajes seudo-histricos esta en entredicho por las leyendas que se tejen a su alrededor. Mas aun los personajes bblicos. Estimemos entonces, que la leyenda es un volatizador histrico. Refirindome a su pregunta, sepa usted que la Biblia no es un libro de historia, la Biblia es un cdigo de conducta para una sociedad, por lo tanto, cada hombre o mujer que aparece en la Biblia se tiende a idealizar como un aglutinador de conductas cvicas. Sin embargo, siempre tendremos la duda hasta que no se pruebe con certeza si existieron o no. Ahora, la existencia es una duda que no podemos descartar, pero ?sus aventuras? Es tema distinto. Sepa usted que uno de los lugares mas venerados por el cristianismo, el judasmo y el Islam es LA TUMBA DE LOS PATRIARCAS, ubicadas en la localidad de Hebron, al lado de Cisjordania, en pleno corazn de Judea. La tradicin religiosa dice que ah estn enterrados, en pares, los padres de la religin, partiendo por Adn y Eva, Abraham y Sara, Isaac y Rebeca y por ultimo, Jacob y Lia. ?Sern ellos? No lo sabremos hasta que las pruebas arqueolgicas se hagan, pero no se han hecho por respeto a la transpersonalidad social, que vaya que pesa en un pueblo. Desde mi parecer, considero que no.   Por lo de  Moiss, en el siglo XIX, el egiptlogo Vctor Loret, encontr la tumba de un tal Meses, y por los jeroglficos en su tumba se sabe que fue un personaje en el Egipto de su tiempo, que se fue de all y estuvo mucho tiempo vagando. Se especula que fue en el tiempo que el faran cambio el culto de Amon por el de Akenaton. Ante ello, Meses como buen monotesta, se fue hasta que la calma regreso. Se especula que puede ser el mismo Moiss bblico, pero siempre esta la duda.  Para mas informacin le dejo tres paginas para que visite:   http://www.abc.es/20081205/internacional...  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumba_de_lo...  http://www.scribd.com/doc/2403507/La-Tum...    Aun as, y repito, es muy probable que ambos personajes hallan existido, toda leyenda tiene su dejo de verdad. Recordemos, por ejemplo, que Abraham aparece nombrado, junto con Sodoma, Gomorra y otras referencias bblicas en las TABLAS DE EBLA, datadas alrededor del a?o 2500 antes de Cristo Lo que siempre esta en la duda sern los hechos, los acontecimientos.

Despus este nombre se us para nombrar a este se?or y a todo su clan que pas a ser identificado con l en el mito (de ah que viviera cientos de a?os, pues no mora mientras no muriese el clan que gobernaba. Con el tiempo como gracias a que ste emigr de Babilonia a Canan Dios pudo convertir a los Israelitas en su pueblo, se considera que Dios quiso esta emigracin, con lo que en el mito se dice que Dios le habla y le dice que emigre (cuando en realidad slo le habla metiendo en ste una idea de emigrar).  Por otro lado, el sacrificio de Isaac significa lo siguiente: los Cananeos tenan unos sacrificios a los dioses. Pero los israelitas llegaron a la conclusin de que Dios no puede quererlos, que slo los mand para poner a prueba el amor de stos a Dios mayor que a sus hijos. Y despus llegan a la conclusin de que si lo han pensado es porque Dios en ese momento les dice que no lo hagan ms porque ya han superado esa prueba. Eso se planta en el mito diciendo que Dios habla a Abraham (que en el mito representa a toda su descendencia cuando le habla en conjunto) y se lo dice.  El caso es que todo sto est demostrado que ocurri realmente por los descubrimientos arqueolgicos.  Sobre Moiss no s bien qu representa. Pero s que hay una tradicin extrabblica que dice que siendo prncipe en Egipto cas con una princesa nubia, y hay un tal prncipe Ramose, del que se ha borrado todas las inscripciones que hablaban de el (como en la Biblia se dice de Moiss), menos una en que se dej por algn motivo, que cas con una princesa nubia. Puedes leer sobre el tema aqu, el problema quiz es que et en ingls: http://www.thecreativeuniverse.org/12%20...  Aparte de sto, si es que tambin Moiss es un personaje simblico o literario, existen tanto Abraham como Moiss como dicho personaje, y existi aquello que quieren simbolizar. Espero que te sirva.

Tal vez, incluso, provengan de una civilizacin comn y por eso se dan estos rasgos caractersticos y similares en las diferentes culturas.  En fin, todo lo que podemos llegar a pensar, no son ms que conjeturas. Sera lindo poder saberlo pero se han destruido demasiado a esas culturas como para buscar ahora su legado. Esperemos que algn da tengamos alguna certeza al respecto.  Otra buena pregunta sera por qu la mayora de las religiones en el mundo han sido politeistas y por qu muchas de ellas adoraban al sol. Es para quedarse pensando un buen rato.      Saludos!!

Cuando uno dice gato, visualiza un gato, lo mismo si uno dice perro y asi con todo lo tangible.  Si digo "Odio", alguno visualizara alguien enojado, otro visualizara a hitler, otro visualizara a un irani inmolarse, etc.  Si digo dios, alguno visualizara un super hombre perfecto, otro visualizara una super mujer de piel morena con una cola espectacular y otro visualizara una nube muy extensa, etc.  La realidad es que dios es todo, y no hay nada que sea perfecto ni imperfecto, ni forma de visualizarlo de manera correcta porque el hombre no conoce todo, y para visualizar a dios, hay que visualizarlo todo.  Ademas dios no tiene remordimientos, ni odio, ni alegria, ni ningun sentimiento humano, porque dios no es humano, es el todo.  Por lo tanto cuando pienses que dios es o no perfecto, primero es necesario entender que no existe nada perfecto ni impertecto, todo "es" y punto.  Yo no conozco nadie que sea imperfecto, si conozco gente que a mi parecer es distinta a mi, pero eso no la hace mas o menos perfecta.|`|DzRB1LGsaa	En mi opinin, esta pregunta no se puede responder satisfactoriamente.    En esta pregunta se asume que existe un Dios. Adems, se da por hecho que ese Dios es perfecto. Tambin se afirma que ese Dios perfecto cre al hombre. Y, finalmente, se asegura que el ser humano es imperfecto. Ninguna de esas afirmaciones se puede probar.    Aun as, supongamos que exista un Dios, que adems ese Dios es perfecto y que cre al ser humano imperfecto (lo cual no es tan simple como creer que porque el ser humano tiene defectos es imperfecto, tal vez fue creado con esos defectos y eso lo hace perfecto desde el punto de vista del  propsito de su creacin). Supongamos pues, todo lo anterior. Con todo y eso, es imposible saber "?por qu si Dios es perfecto creo al hombre?" (que es la pregunta concreta), pues dar una respuesta sera tanto como afirmar que nosotros, seres imperfectos, conocemos las razones para actuar de un ser perfecto.|`|5wjDAykCaa	Porque si el hombre es inteligente y posee fuerza fisica creo a la maquina, la robotica y los ordenadores?

And because book audiences are smarter than movie audiences, and if the plotline gets the slightest bit complicated and there isn't a happy ending, well... the script makers feel like they have to rewrite it.

V7dpXjOoaa	Moyta:la inteligencia es orden.Y no me refiero a un orden mecnico ni fri.Me refiero a un orden que nace del discernimiento de la realidad de nuestro diario vivir.Una mente trastornada se refleja en un desequilibrio emocional.La inteligencia surge de una mente y un corazn equilibrados.El execivo amor como el desamor reflejan posesividad mas que afecto,cari?o o simpata.Saludos.|`|poaMhQWyaa	Yo creo que el amor o el odio pueden estar vinculados a la inteligencia y tendriamos que definir ambos terminos.Primero  es el amor:a mi entender, el amor es un sentimiento de fuerza en ausencia absoluta de violencia.Y lo que dijo VIoleta estoy de acuerdo,Hay sentimientos egoistas que se disfrazan y son mal llamados amor, pero en realidad estan peleados y conspiran con el amor.  Si no hay tolerancia, no hay amor, si no hay buena voluntad, no hay amor, si no hay, paz no hay amor, si no hay busqueda del bien comun o el bien mayor, no hay amor, pero muchas veces tampoco hay falta de inteligencia en estos casos, puesto que la inteligencia(entonces este es el otro concepto) son los diversos mecanismos que utiliza el ser humano para lograr determinado y diversos objetivo.Y muchas de estas personas que elaboran un mecanismo o un sistema de opresion con el llamado "ser amado"(tomemos el ejemplo de la madre con su hijo o la pareja celosa)NO precisamente carece de inteligencia, al menos a lo que se le llama "inteligencia", tanto como a lo que se llama "amor", comunmente y que comunmente estan errados.  En caso del  odio si quizas podria esta un poco de acuerdo con tu frase, pero aun asi,si el odio motiva mecanismos para desarrollarlo,entonces hay inteligencia.  LO que creo que si podria coincidir, es que los impulsos( no el exceso) poco meditados pueden llevarnos a cometer actos poco inteligentes y que se salen del mecanismo de lo que queremos lograr, pero eso no se produce por exceso de amor o odio, sino por impulso.|`|aa40f146f97f6e3641f67c3d066720caaa	TODOS los excesos son malos...demuestran inseguridad ... el exceso del bien se convierte en mal...el exceso de amor se convierte en celos...el exceso de cuidado se convierte en sobreproteccin (super da?ino)...el exceso de intolerancia en odio...el exceso de consumo en adiccin.  saludos!!|`|3d35323f81e76ed87758cd4da0d5e696aa	Por eso hay que amar con inteligencia y siempre respetando el espacio de la otra persona.|`|blfAIUuOaa	Los excesos demuestran falta de madurez ms que de inteligencia.

De todo hay en la vi?a del Se?or. Es muy interesante lo que dices del exceso del bien, cres de verdad que la bondad puede ser excesiva ? Sabes la definicin del diccionario de la lengua castellana de la palabra amor ? pues es la siguiente Amor significa querer el bien de la persona amada   no que est contigo, ni que te ame, ni que te sirva a t de algo, solo querer su bien.en cuanto al odio, es precisiamente lo contrario, es desear el mal de la persona que odias, eso es de por s lo ms excesivo.

Los excesos ,todos,son malos igual que las carencias.Siempre hablando de pasiones y sentimientos que es a lo que apunta tu cuestionamiento.  Es lo que muchos denominan la doctrina del termino medio,aunque si dejamos de filosofar y usamos el corazon,que se llena de emociones,sentimientos,ilusiones cuando amamos y dejamos entrar a la mente con razonamientos logicos e ilogicos,nos daremos cuenta que no es un combate entre ambos sino un equilibrio en el que predomina la esperanza ,la necesidad.No creo amiga que es falta de desarrollo de la inteligencia,como podes amar locamente o inteligentemente????me parece que no se puede separar tan facil,creo que es todo un combo que en algunas situaciones predominara el corazon y en otras la razon o inteligencia como vos decis.Por ultimo me gustaria decirte que no se si hay amores enfermizos ,abusivos,odios excesivos o falta de inteligencia en esos sentimientos,sabes que creo?? QUE HAY PERSONALIDADES EQUILIBRADAS,y otras no.

El amor es dar sin esperar nada, si dices que el amor provoca falta de tolerancia y buena voluntad, perdona pero eso no es amor, eso es egosmo, y el egosmo no tiene nada que ver con el amor.  Un par d ejemplos: Una madre que dice que ama tanto a su hijo/a que no le permite infinidad de cosa porque le ama.  Otro ejemplo un hombre/mujer que ama tanto a su pareja que le pone limites y es intransigente total ?para ti eso es amor?, si te refieres a ese par de ejemplos que te he puesto, perdona que te repita otra ver ESO NO ES AMOR.  Amor es darlo todo sin esperar nada. Amor es el que dan las personas cuando se entregan a favorecer a los seres que lo necesitan sin esperar nada a cambio.  PIENSALO, eso si es inteligente: Pensar mas profundamente que es el amor. (Te lo digo sin acritud).  Saludos:)    ME OLVIDE DECIRTE QUE EL ODIO PARA MI SI QUE ES FALTA DE INTELIGENCIA;)    Entonces por favor ACLARA TU PREGUNTA CUANDO DICES QUE CUANDO SE AMA MUCHO FALTA TOLERANCIA Y BUENA VOLUNTAD, PORQUE NO TE ENTIENDO.

7qnb4zhRaa	Ce n'est pas parce que les animaux ne sont pas des hommes que les hommes ne sont pas des animaux. Le refus de l'anthropomorphisme signifie qu'il faut rsister  la tentation d'interprter le comportement d'autres animaux selon les catgories humaines (celles des raisonnements sociaux par exemple). Il ne signifie pas que l'homme se distingue par nature de tous les autres animaux, mais seulement qu'il en est une espce particulire qui n'a pas vocation  servir de modle pour tous les autres. De mme qu'il ne faudrait pas utiliser les catgories propres au raton-laveur pour interprter le comportement humain (ce qui est peu probable puisque, de fait, nous ignorons ce qu'elles sont, et si seulement elles existent).|`|AA12157281	Oui ncessairement  mon avis.     En fait le seul fait de considrer que les humains auraient des "sentiments" absolument unique  leur espce est  mon avis une erreur qui trouve sa source dans notre tendance  nous trouver suprieur au reste du rgne vivant (tendance naturelle, je ne la condamne pas en tant que telle, je constate simplement).     Donc c'est le nom anthropomorphisme que je considre comme erron. Car selon moi, il n'y a aucune raison de croire que l'appartenance  une espce pourrait dterminer des sentiments unique et introuvable ailleurs, pas plus que cette appartenance garantirait que toutes ces sentiments prtendus unique seraient possds par l'ensemble des membres de cette espce.    Par exemple, on parle parfois de "dignit humaine". Comme si seul les humains avaient une "dignit" ou que tous en auraient une.     Le mot anthropomorphisme suggre donc que certains "sentiments" ne sont possds que par l'homme  l'exclusion de tout autre animal. C'est une croyance qui a tendance  s'effriter avec le temps, car plus on observe le monde animal et plus on constate que l'on ferait mieux de faire preuve de modestie.     Mme si il est indgniable que seul les hommes ont russis  construire des avions polluants, il est tout aussi indgniable que seul les abeilles ont russis la prouesse de fabriquer du miel avec le polen des fleurs.    La notion d'espce est une frontire tout  fait arbitraire qui ne dtermine en rien les capacits relles des tres se trouvant  l'intrieur d'une ou l'autre espce. C'est au mieux un moyen de classifier des tres pour mieux les tudier.|`|b09075990e7558debc94ef4d8ae07e43aa	Dieu a cr l'homme  son image et a oubli de mettre une ame  l'animal  et  Sarkosy. Tu dois penser sans doute  cette grande citation de notre vnr prsident lorsque tu nous parles de tes ablutions matutinales. Il est tellement facile de se mettre sur un pied d'est ale , de se considrer comme espce dominante et de voir l'autre comme une chose. Anthropomorphisme ne rsout pas le problme du statut de l'animal. Il se contente de lui donner un caractre humano?de. L'anthropomorphisme affirme bien au contraire la dpersonnalisation de l'animal dans sa spcificit, dans son tre. En humanisant l'animal , on ne lui confre pas une valeur propre. On se contente de  lui donner une image qui n'est pas la sienne. L'animal devient un humain , trop humain, un tre pourvu de la raison de celui qui lui donne ce pouvoir de raison. trange, non. Une poupe anime par un marionnettiste est-elle un tre dote de raison? Peut-tre pour Jpto mais les contes  ne sont que des illusion. L'animal dot d'attributs humain reste un animal avec " sa raison animal".

Chacun son truc.    Mais pour rester sur ta question, non, je ne crois pas.    Ou plus exactement, ?a dpend des raisons pour lesquels on le rejette.    S'il s'agit de motifs en rapport avec la religion, c'est certainement oui. On voit bien, d'aprs la Gense, que l'homme a t cr par Dieu avec une intention parfaitement distincte de celle qui a prsid  la cration de l'animal, sous cet angle, on peut considrer que nous sommes radicalement diffrents, y compris dans notre "essence".    S'il s'agit de motifs plus rationnels, je n'en vois ni la ncessit, ni au contraire, l'empchement. Pour les darwinistes en particulier, nous sommes nous-mmes des animaux,  un stade de l'volution suppos "plus avanc", pour la biologie, incontestablement, nous le sommes, donc pas de coupure.    Hormis si j'ai mal compris le sens que tu donnes  cette expression, le refus de l'anthropomorphisme n'est jamais que le rejet d'une sorte de prjug, de rflexe, ou de superstition consistant  prter A PRIORI aux animaux des intentions, des comportements, des fonctionnements individuels ou sociaux similaires  ceux des humains, et/ou bass sur des fondements similaires.    En toute rigueur, il n'y a pas lieu de s'enfermer dans une telle supposition.

Car bcp d'animaux ont des yeux, des oreilles, une bouche, des mamelles de lait, des poils, des ongles (griffes), quatre membres, un sexe fminin et masculin, etc. (les mammifaires pour rsumer, meme si on peut toujours trouver des ressemblances et des diffrences entre toutes les especes vivantes)    Bref, nous sommes des animaux, ou les animaux sont des humains. Ca n'est qu'une question de terminologie pour moi...    sur le plan motionnel et psychologique, il est plus difficile de s'en rendre compte. Il faut partager des moments avec des animaux (et meme avec les plantes !!) pour se rendre compte qu'eux aussi expriment l'amour, la faim, la souffrance, la joie, l'enfance, le jeu, la peur, la domination, la faiblesse, la responsabilit paternelle, etc...    La seule grande diffrence  mes yeux, c'est qu'aucune autre espece ne transforme le monde avec autant d'acharnement. Nos mains sont les outils les plus merveilleux de la cration, surtout quand elles sont manies par un cerveau aussi volu que le notre. Peut etre meme trop voluer, puisqu'on en arrive  construire des armes... C'est un peu fou non ? de s'entretuer pour possder ?|`|uciPsluwaa	Oui sans doute|`|Z3kXbI2haa	De qui parles-tu ? Qui peut refuser l'anthropomorphisme ? L'Homme ? Je vois pas trop comment. L'animal ? En effet, puisqu'il ne peut pas l'accepter. Que peut-il accepter ou refuser de toutes fa?ons ? Je ne te suis pas.    Je cherche, je cherche... Par refus de l'anthropomorphisme, tu veux dire anti-spcisme ? Par ce que je tiens  rappeler que l'anthropomorphisme est la tendance  confrer des caractristiques, comportements, proprits humaines  des objets non humains. C'est donc un procd de l'esprit, utilis dans divers domaines (mythologie, littrature, peinture, etc...)  Donc refuser l'anthropomorphisme, ?a veut dire refuser de prter des caractristiques humaines  des objets non humains lors d'une production quelconque. Refuser les fables de La Fontaine par exemple.    D'une je vois pas bien ce que veut dire, car comment refuser une oeuvre dj produite ? De deux, si c'est juste refuser pour les oeuvres qui seront produites  partir de maintenant, je vois pas comment ?a pourrait induire "une coupure radicale entre l'homme et l'animale". Je veux dire, ?a va pas changer la face du monde, quoi. Bref, je suis perplexe.

Supongo que s!!!.  En la mitologa romana cupido es el dios del amor. Equivale al Eros en la mitoloiga griega, y a Kamadeva en la mitologa Hind.  Es hijo de Venus y de Marte. Se le adjudica la creacin de amores  y pasiones entre los mortales y suele ser representado por un ni?o alado ( parecido a un ngel de la mitologa cristiana). Al ser hijos de los dioses de la guerra y del amor, Cupido resulta ser el dios de los enamorados,  creando de esta manera un balance engre el amor y la tragedia.  Mira que bonito:    Cupido y Psique: anatoma de un beso  Jos Mara Ciordia  jose.maria.ciordia@almez.pntic.mec.es   IES Avempace. Zaragoza.    1. El mito.  La historia de amor de Cupido (Eros en griego) y Psique no aparece mencionada en la literatura griega, pero sabemos que era conocida, porque aparece representada en el arte de la poca. Este mito aparece narrado, en su forma ms completa, en la novela latina "El asno de oro" o "Las Metamorfosis" de Apuleyo (s. II d.C.). Haciendo "clic" sobre esta imagen podrs leer un resumen del mito a la vez que vas resolviendo un rompecabezas:       Los amores de Cupido y Psique  nuevamente narrados  en ocho jornadas y un eplogo  con un remedio de amor.       2. Iconografa: Cupido y Psique en el arte.  "Psiqu" significa alma en griego. Por eso en las representaciones antiguas aparece como una figura con alas cerca de la barca de Caronte, el barquero que pasa las almas del mundo de los vivos al de los muertos, o bien cerca del difunto. Cuando se representa la historia de su amor con Cupido aparece como una mujer, a veces con alas de mariposa, aunque no siempre, y frecuentemente en el trance de recibir el beso de su amado que la devolver a la vida. Es el caso de esta pintura pompeyana de la casa de Terencio Nerone (Museo Nacional, Npoles):        Durante el Renacimiento se convirti en un tema muy de moda y por eso es frecuente encontrarlo en las decoraciones pictricas de muchos palacios, como en el Palacio Farnesina de Roma (pintado por Rafael), en el castillo de Sant' Angelo (pintado por Pierino del Vaga), o finalmente en las vidrieras del Museo Cond de Chantilly. La Fontaine public su versin del mito en forma de novela bajo el ttulo Los amores de Psique y Cupido (1669), lo que asegur la vigencia de este tema en los siglos XVII y XVIII. Durante el neoclasicismo fue un tema muy frecuente, como testimonian el lienzo de David (coleccin particular) y una escultura de Rodin.        Foto: Antonio Canova (1757-1822) Psiqu reanimada por el beso del Amor, Roma, 1793. Conservada en el Museo del Louvre, Pars. Esta es una de las seis versiones del mito que realiz el escultor Canova. Comentario extrado de la pgina web del museo del Louvre:    "Canova domina con su personalidad artstica el panorama del arte europeo de su tiempo. Renovador del arte clsico en Italia, se forma en Venecia y ya en Roma es un innovador. Maestro del mrmol, es el escultor de las grandes tumbas, como la de Napolen a la antigua, de los dioses romanos heroicos y de las ninfas ligeras. El grupo del Amor que hace renacer a Psique dormida para siempre gracias a las exhalaciones de un perfume mgico, es tanto un himno al amor como el recuerdo de la leyenda de Psique, que se refiere al alma inmortal del mito platnico. Sin sacrificar las reglas de la Academia, Canova construy una pirmide de cuerpos enlazados, animados por un delicado juego de miembros que se mueven con la luz. La transparencia del mrmol blanco a?ade poesa a un grupo que fue muy meditado (el modelo remonta a 1787), y que fue repetido por el propio Canova para el prncipe Yusupoff."    http://www.louvre.fr/espanol/collec/scul...

Todos buscamos el amor, pues es algo muy gratificante cuando se es correspondido y doloroso cuando es rechazado, pero como tu dices, a veces nos flecha desprevenidos y causa estragos en nuestra mente y organismo, el corazon nos late mas rapido, se sudan las manos,  no estamos alerta, nos causa una alta dosis de ansiedad.    Este amor de flechazo no es objetivo, es caprichoso, creemos que es unico y absoluto. Eros, eso que se llama enamoramiento, no dura mucho, ese amor explosivo y volatil dura entre un mes y tres anos.    Luego de ese amor, viene un amor mas maduro, duradero, de entrega a la otra persona, no tan emocionante, pero muy gratificante.  Nosotros lo controlamos, el no nos controla a nosotros como el primero.     Otro amor que no puede quedar atras es el amor "agape" el cual es la fraternidad, la ternura, la compasion.      Lo ideal para una pareja duradera, seria combinar el primer tipo - deseo, atraccion, admiracion total, el segundo - sintonia, respeto, comunicacion, con la pareja. Y el tercero que es la sencibilidad la compasion  fraternidad.|`|8Us7NICBaa	Cupido o como quieras llamarlo. Cuando te pica el "bichito" del amor es lo mejor que pueda ocurrirte.

Saludos Gladys G|`|rUnVYvsLaa	Sobre el Enamoramiento y el Amor Real:  El amor es un sentimiento que nunca cambia. El enamoramiento es el sentimiento intenso avasallador con el que suele iniciarse el amor. Es maravilloso mientras dura, porque nos hace idealizar a la persona amada. El amor es otra cosa. Casi siempre es consecuencia del enamoramiento; pero a diferencia de ste, es realista y cambiante.   El amor es ciego. El enamoramiento lo es, el amor verdadero no. El amor verdadero ve con toda claridad los defectos y las virtudes de la persona amada, pero la acepta con ellos y aprende a convivir con lo bueno y lo malo.  Con el amor basta. Muchas parejas fracasan cuando se enfrentan a la realidad de la vida diaria, en la que no todo se resuelve con amor. Se necesita mucho ms que el amor entre la pareja para enfrentarse a los problemas prcticos inherentes a la construccin de la vida juntos.   Enamoramiento: En esta etapa, ms que en otras, se vive el amor romntico, constituido por factores de intimidad y pasin. sta ltima suele ser poco estable y poco controlable por la conciencia. Este tipo de amor es altamente valorado en nuestra sociedad y se le considera ideal y bsico para proseguir una relacin.   Sin embargo, el enamoramiento tarde o temprano acaba, aunque muchas veces hay resistencia para aceptar su fin. En su mayora, el final del enamoramiento viene acompa?ado por la desilusin. La realidad gradualmente debilita el estado ideal del enamoramiento, y muchos llegan a creer que todo ha acabado. Algunos sienten que se han equivocado y con gran desilusin dan la media vuelta y se van, otros, simplemente aceptan que no es lo que buscaban y miran para otros lados.   El final del enamoramiento puede verse en dos sentidos: el fin de la relacin o la culminacin de un paso para construir el amor maduro y real. Generalmente, el final de enamoramiento es una prueba de fuego. Algunos desisten y rompen porque consideran que si no sienten esas sensaciones placenteras que deja el enamoramiento, no hay nada que los una como pareja.   En cambio, quienes pasan la prueba y siguen juntos pueden tener posibilidades para fortalecer su relacin. Estas parejas pueden ver el fin del enamoramiento como parte del proceso para dar paso al amor real.   Cuando hablamos de amor real primero tendramos que entender que el amor romntico no es amor; es atraccin, apasionamiento y deseo. El amor romntico muchas veces lleva a una relacin sin un conocimiento suficiente; sin una comprensin, afinidad o intimidad afectiva entre la pareja. Si entendemos por amor que el bienestar y la seguridad del ser amado llega a ser tan importante como el propio, vamos a ver que en muchas ocasiones no se da un autntico amor. El amor autntico se equilibra cuando el bienestar del otro es igual de importante que el mo, ni ms ni menos, y para saber qu es lo que requiere el otro, se necesita conocer a la pareja para saber sus necesidades, cul es la fuente de su bienestar y de su seguridad emocional.     No cabe duda que el amor es un sentimiento complejo que no nace de un da para otro, sino que es susceptible a modificarse y fortalecerse, pero pare ello requiere de algunos elementos:  El amor slo puede realizarse en la libertad.   La relacin amorosa se establece con una persona de carne y hueso, no con una ilusin.   El amor establece una relacin de intercambio no sobrevive siendo unilateral.  La confianza, el cari?o y la admiracin son dos de los elementos ms importantes en una relacin duradera y gratificante.   El conocimiento de la pareja, el dilogo abierto, la reciprocidad, la comunicacin, la capacidad de negociacin, el inters en la relacin, el inters en la igualdad y equidad, la solidaridad y el compromiso seran los elementos para lograr una buena relacin ms duradera.  El amor, respeto y aceptacin hacia uno mismo son aspectos que influye directamente en la capacidad para amar.   Finalmente, en cada relacin amorosa, una historia sentimental comienza siendo un diamante en bruto con muchas facetas. Puede llegar a ser una piedra preciosa si se pulen todas sus caras, un verdadero tesoro en la vida de todo ser humano, pero para conseguirlo primero hay que reconocer y conectar con todas esas partes que la conforman.

Reprenons:   Un psychologue a fait la fac de psychologie, 5 ans, + ventuellement un doctorat et/ou des formations complmentaires. A la fac, il a eu une spcialisation sur les deux dernires annes; psychopathologie (= les troubles psychiques), neuropsychologie (= les troubles lis  des lsions crbrales), psycho du dveloppement (=enfance et adolescence, ou personnes ages), etc... Il est soumis  un code de dontologie, mais attention quand-mme, il existe malheureusement des gens peu srieux (aucune sanction pnale n'est prvue pour ceux qui ne respectent pas ce Code), il est donc conseill de vrifier que le psychologue choisi possde bien ce titre. Il y a un trs bon annuaire des psys ici: http://www.choisir-son-psy.com/annuaire/...  (tris par critres, ou par rgion, etc). Les honoraires (=prix des sances) sont libres et non-remboursables, sauf si le psychologue est aussi mdecin, ce qui est rarement le cas. L'avantage est que le psychologue a une formation uniquement psychologique et non mdicale, il a une approche du psychisme plus complte, car souvent il a t sensibilis  plus de techniques, plus de points de vue thoriques, etc. Il est habilit  faire passer des tests d'valuation, mais pas  prescrire des mdicaments. En fonction de chaque patient, il peut adopter telle ou telle mthode pour laquelle il aura t form: art-thrapie, psychanalyse, thrapie systmique, .......      Un psychiatre a fait mdecine (7 ans), puis spcialisation psychiatrie (3 ou 4 ans je crois). Il est mdecin, donc remboursable par la scu, mais attention aux dpassements d'honoraires, pas toujours pris en charge par les mutuelles: demande aux secrtaires des psychiatres que tu contactes s'il fait des dpassements d'honoraire, demande de combien, et contacte ta mutuelle pour savoir s'ils les prennent en charge. Aprs, sache que gnralement le temps d'attente pour un premier rendez-vous varie entre 2 mois et un an selon les psychiatres! Mais certains prennent les cas d'urgence, ou font plus vite si tu es recommand par ton gnraliste. Les psychiatres ont le droit, contrairement aux psychologues, de prescrire des mdicaments, mais ?a ne veut pas dire qu'ils ne fassent que ?a! Tout dpend de leur technique, et de leurs formations complmentaires. Les plus frquentes sont la psychanalyse et les techniques cognitivo-comportementales.  La psychanalyse recherche dans ton vcu les causes de ta phobie. Si tu dveloppes,  un moment donn, une peur panique de quelque chose, ce n'est pas pour rien, c'est que le psychisme a "quelque chose  dire", une problmatique qui n'a pas t rgle. Si l'on comprend ce qu'il veut nous dire, le sympt?me (la phobie) va dispara?tre. Les inconvnients: c'est long, voire trs long (on va dire de 6 mois  30 ans ^^), et c'est un travail qui va faire remonter tout le pass  la surface pour le retravailler. Donc si c'est pas joyeux, faut s'accorcher. Avantages: quand le problme est rgl, il l'est vraiment en profondeur; de plus, c'est un rel travail de fond sur soi-mme, qui amne  mieux se conna?tre et mieux se comprendre, et  se rconcilier totalement avec ce que l'on est.  Les thrapies cognitico-comportementales, elles, s'intressent directement au sympt?me. C'est une confrontation avec le sympt?me, qu'on va essayer de traiter par l'habituation: petit  petit, on va amener la personne  se mettre dans des situations anxiognes, et trs doucement, on va dvelopper le sentiment de scurit, en lui montrant qu'elle ne "risque rien". C'est beaucoup plus rapide que la psychanalyse (quelques mois  un an ou deux gnralement), mais, d'une part, ?a ne marche pas toujours, et d'autre part, si le sympt?me n'est que l'expression d'un mal-tre plus profond, il va se dplacer: par exemple, si l'on soigne la peur des ascenceurs d'une personne, elle 'naura plus peur des ascenceurs, mais va dvelopper un peu plus tard une peur des transports en commun (c'est un exemple, hein :)).    Et puis aprs, il y a des psychothrapeuthes (vrifier qu'ils soient qualifis par le SNPP ou autre organisme srieux, tu les as aussi dans l'annuaire des psys ci-dessus), des psychanalystes, ...      En bref, la seule chose qui diffrencie avec certitude le chiatre du chologue, c'est le remboursement par la scu et la prescription de mdocs. Tout le reste, c'est du cas par cas...  Quel que soit ton choix, ne stoppe pas la dmarche si le premier que tu rencontres ne te convient pas: trouver "le bon psy", c'est presque aussi dur que trouver le bon mari ou la bonne pouse! Mais ?a vaut le coup, puisque c'est du bonheur qu'il s'agit.  ;)  Bon courage!|`|S0oGeLZBaa	mci le copier-coller d'internet! n'est-ce pa Elea E!! mouahahaha|`|h5QdEHVRaa	Le psychiatre te donnera des mdicaments , et le psychologue t'coutera parler , donc c'est mieux pour ce dont tu souffres ,t'exprimer ,ailleurs que derrire ton clavier !!

njotxlsuaa	Hmm.. well the way they always tell people to start in school is to first establish your topic. Then start out your introduction with some broad information about the topic.     ( Ex. Topic= A Book, Broad info. = State the Title, Author, Main Plot, Characters etc)     Then for your body, you should include more details of what you described about your topic.     (Ex. If a book, describe some important events/facts that are told/occurred in the book).     Then for your conclusion, you should restate some of the main things from your introduction.     (Ex. "The book was about..." or the general ideas mentioned in the book.) Also finish off with some kind of closing sentence.     (NOTE: DO NOT use the words "in conclusion" "in closing" etc. These kinds of sentences are thought to be over used and are not graded well).

UANv8qKoaa	Querido amigo,   Has puesto en el tapete a dos grandes escritores, aunque antagnicos en sus formas, modo y en el sentir de la escritura.    Por un lado un Baudelaire, que desat polmicas con sus escritos, considerados hasta ofensivos a la moral y ese amiguismo con la muerte, la miseria, el crimen, casi una poesa oscura, en mi humilde entender Es como que todo le resultaba ilimitado a la hora de escribir; su fuerte creencia tanto en la complejidad del alma como en el poder del mal ante los placeres, hace que intente sacarnos de ese estado de fantasa donde el poeta es cielo.   comparto uno de sus poemas:  "Lector apacible y buclico,  sobrio e ingenuo hombre de bien,  tira este libro saturnal,  orgistico y melanclico.   Si no has estudiado retrica  con Satn, el astuto decano  /?tralo!, no entenderas nada,  o me creeras histrico.  Mas si, sin dejarse hechizar,  tus ojos saben hundirse en los abismos,  leme para aprender a amarme;  alma singular que sufres  y vas buscando tu paraso,  ?compadceme!... Si no, ?te maldigo!     Por el otro,  Whitman con una incontenible alegra de vivir, la excelsitud e integridad de las imgenes, una metforas de vuelo inmenso y el verso libre, simple, cotidiano.    No resulta casual que Lorca o Neruda le cantaran mostrndole respeto y admiracin. No es simple coincidencia que su nombre est junto al poeta chileno, a quien ayud a encontrarse...     Mi respeto infinito por ambos, pero no puedo dejar de reconocer que la poesa de Walt Whitman me seduce , que est embebida de un sensualismo y erotismo increbles, despegndose de las detalles ntimos femeninos para quedar en accin contemplativa ante el desnudo, sin apenas tocarlo.  Comparto un fragmento de las odas que Lorca y Neruda le dedicaran.    *Y t, bello Walt Whitman, duerme a orillas del Hudson  con la barba hacia el polo y las manos abiertas.  Arcilla blanda o nieve, tu lengua est llamando  camaradas que velen tu gacela sin cuerpo.  Duerme, no queda nada.  Una danza de muros agita las praderas  y Amrica se anega de mquinas y llanto.  Quiero que el aire fuerte de la noche ms honda  quite flores y letras del arco donde duermes  y un ni?o ***** anuncie a los blancos del oro  la llegada del reino de la espiga.    Federico Garca Lorca    *Yo no recuerdo  a qu edad,  ni dnde,  si en el gran Sur mojado  o en la costa  temible, bajo el breve  grito de las gaviotas,  toqu una mano y era  la mano de Walt Whitman:  pis la tierra  con los pies desnudos,  anduve sobre el pasto,  sobre el firme roco  de Walt Whitman.  Durante  mi juventud  toda  me acompa? esa mano,  ese roco,  su firmeza de pino patriarca, su extensin de  pradera,  y su misin de paz circulatoria  Fragmento de Pablo Neruda    Mi abrazo inmenso quantico y gracias por traernos a estos excelsos poetas, a los que pude sumar dos grandes con su canto.   Hoy, por respeto a la inmortalidad que los abriga, dejo mi simple poema y los aplaudo.|`|2BhM838Waa	Baudelaire si he leido algo, Witman no tengo el gusto,......

UANv8qKoaa	Uff querido amigo quantico, cunto me hace estudiar, leer, buscar, para poder estar en tus preguntas!!! y lo agradezco.     Claro que influye y ha infludo en el pensamiento contemporneo. De hecho se est planteando una profunda revolucin cultural, surgida de los conocimientos sobre las partculas elementales, englobados en lo que ha dado en llamarse la Fsica Cuntica, como una manera de describir el mundo.     La revolucin cultural que se deriva de estos conocimientos tiene que ver, sobre todo, con la naturaleza de la realidad, la percepcin y la percepcin formada por el efecto combinado de creencias, pensamientos y emociones.    Estamos interesados en entender la estructura cuntica de la realidad y los descubrimientos sobre el funcionamiento del cerebro, capaz de reaccionar de la misma forma tanto respecto a un objeto real como a otro imaginario.    La Fsica Cuntica, se est poniendo de moda, con todo lo bueno y lo malo que eso supone: despertar el inters por una disciplina cientfica es positivo, pero convertirla casi en una religin capaz de resolverlo prcticamente todo, es algo que no tiene nada que ver con la ciencia.    La neurologa ha venido a arrojar nueva luz al se?alar que el cerebro nos ofrece una interpretacin de se?ales, smbolos y signos a travs de un complicado ejercicio vertiginoso de matemticas complejas, lo que aparentemente reduce la naturaleza de la realidad a un conjunto de ondas electromagnticas que se concretan en objetos por mediacin del cerebro.    Ahora sabemos basados en la realidad cuntica que el observador es quien modifica la realidad a partir de la conciencia, que existe un  vasto campo de probabilidades y  el observador es el que decide donde poner su atencin e intencin. Dentro del tiempo cuntico pasado, presente y futuro se encuentran simultneos.     La revolucin informtica desarrolla su potencial en base al pensamiento cuntico y no habra revolucin tecnolgica sin los conductores de esta informacin y energa.     Internet y la comunicacin global han configurado una malla universal que se extiende cada vez ms hasta cubrir todo el planeta; representando una matriz de interacciones nunca antes vista en ningn tejido social, en esa magnitud y con esa intensidad. Todo puede estar conectado con todo, en lnea y por un bajo costo.     Lo cierto es que est de moda el tema, muchos lo hablan o intentamos acercarnos a su historia y consecuencias, sin entender mayormente su totalidad e integridad... an as hay quienes se animan a manejar los trminos con total soltura.    Gracias amigo por tu pregunta. En realidad estas palabras finales, donde expreso que el tema est de moda y que mucho se habla an sin entender demasiado siento que es tan as y me hago cargo de mis supuestos.    un beso   ana  |`|HLSRhW3eaa	no estoy seguro que monstruo de la mecanica cuantica dijo una vez que si una persona entendiera realmente los procesos cuanticos se sorprenderia tanto como cuando saltara de un avion pero sin paracaidas!!!!!

Gracias a la fsica cuntica, s que el universo y todo lo que existe es prcticamente hueco, ya que slo son peque?os tomos en los que giran a velocidades gigantescas los electrones y protones, que nunca nada toca nada, y que somos energa; slo eso, que los tomos estn siempre quietos en el mismo lugar y que somos nosotros (la energa en general) los que nos desplazamos a travs de ellos, que el pensamiento puede influenciarnos a nivel biolgico (el mensaje del agua del Dr. Emoto), que todo es cuestin de hormonas, y que prcticamente decidimos si queremos estar sano o enfermos, que la muerte sigue siendo inexplicable, que el alma quiz pese 21 gramos (aunque eso quiz sea cuestin de simple teora con poca prctica rigurosa) s tambin que soy un Dios, que se pueden alterar las leyes de la fsica, que basta con que un tomo de mi energa vibre un poco ms alto o ms bajo para que yo desaparezca de este estado, que el choque de dos tomos es desastroso, que la realidad es (en sentido figurado) ficticia, que hay que aprovechar la vida y vivir felices el mayor tiempo posible...tambin aprend que la simple presencia de un observador puede cambiar un proceso por completo (me hace plantear: ?y como se supone que son las cosas cuando nadie las ve?):    supongo que no me puedo dar el ttulo de filsofo, o de siquiera gran pensador, pero esto ha influenciado bastante en mi forma de pensar, actuar, sentir, y por supuesto, en mi forma de ver las cosas.    ha influenciada a millones de personas alrededor del mundo, les (nos) ha hecho cambiar la forma de pensar, ha logrado avances cientficos como lo de la energa de los pensamiento y la reaccin ante ellos, ha desarrollado nuevas preguntas y ha dado mejores respuestas, la fsica cuntica, para m es como la filosofa pero ms (muchsimo ms) cientfica, y hace entender mejor las cosas....|`|jiZ6hTieaa	al haber tanto avance la persona se torna ansiosa por saber y aparece el stres y la desesperacin por el tener...se perdieron valores esenciales y todo se considera una prdida de tiempo..  el yame ya..ayuda a la intolerancia, la bsqueda con esfuerzo y sacrificio ha quedado olvidada.  antes...estudiar era..leer-tomar notas...resumir...sintetizar..  y ahora..creen que solo apretar un botn y que salga el ttulo de nobleza..puffff...nobles eran los de antes..?que estudiaban gratis!  |`|zEbtjOVGaa	Hola,    Ha infludo bastante.    Creemos intuitivamente que existe una realidad "fuera de toda duda razonable", y evidentemente eso comprobamos a cada momento. Sin embargo, la mecnica cuntica coloca un papel importante a la observacin, el solo acto de observar es capaz de cambiar radicalmente los procesos de un sistema. Puedes observar por ejemplo, el experimento de la doble rendija de Young.    Al contrario de lo que se v en la "fsica" macroscpica en donde hay una exactitud en cuanto a las mediciones de las propiedades de un cuerpo, en la mecnica cuntica no sucede eso. El principio de Incertidumbre impide que se puedan medir dos propiedades de una parttcula de forma simultnea, las propiedades ms citadas son la velocidad y la posicin, un aumento en la precisin de la medida de la velocidad, disminuye la certidumbre en la posicin, y viceversa, por lo que son inversamente proporcionales.    El hecho de que los sistemas cunticos estn descritos por una funcin de onda, genera efectos anti-intuitivos para cualquier persona que ahonde en el tema. La mecnica cuntica describe probabilidades. Es obvio que an no podemos concebir que las partculas sean ondas pero que oscilan a altsimas velocidades.    Se dice que, contrario a lo que se piensa comnmente sobre las interpretaciones de la mecnica cuntica, es posible que existan variables ocultas que rompan la acausalidad de los fenmenos cunticos como la desintegracin de neutrones.

UANv8qKoaa	Hola amigomio...  No es fcil recomendar literatura por ser subjetiva desde la temtica hasta el autor...    De manera personal, siento un gran respeto por Eduardo Galeano y sus obras. Cito en este caso Espejos, donde el autor desde una temtica sociolgica y poltica repasa la historia de la humanidad desde sus orgenes hasta hoy.     Y tambin aunque no es pleno siglo XXI las obras editadas de Michel Foucault, uno de los intelectuales ms originales, como Las palabras y las cosas"    En poesa podra ser la antologa de la poesa latinoamericana al siglo XXI, "Una gravedad alegre" que rene varios poetas contemporneos pero hay tanto para leer independientemente de sus ediciones...  y traigo a colacin la idea que sobre la lectura y los libros dijera Kafka "slo cuando el libro nos muerda, duela nos cambie el dia y la vida, podremos decir que vali la pena leerlo"... por eso, y porque siento que es tan asi, creo que tiene ms que ver con lo que nos seduce leer que con la edicin misma...    un abrazo grande y gracias por tu pregunta...|`|Bl2N29MAaa	LA ESENCIA HUMANA:   Artificio vs. Natura  En este libro se plasma la bsqueda y la respuesta naturalista a las preguntas ?qu es el Hombre? ?Cul es su esencia? ?Qu lo diferencia de los animales? Para obtener la respuesta concreta se analizan las ltimas informaciones de la fsica moderna, de la biologa, las diversas teoras de la evolucin de la vida y del surgimiento del hombre y se va construyendo un sistema que parte de la Tendencia Central del Universo y de la Ley Piramidal, que se manifiestan no slo en la evolucin del cosmos, sino tambin en la de la vida, hasta que en el hombre se produce la aparicin del Artificio, expresada en las Teoras de la Imaginacin, de la Creencia, de las Emociones y de la Verdad. Estas teoras se engloban en lo que el autor llama Filosofa Concreta, Relacional, Relativista y Antropolgica, que trata de coherentizar las diversa ramas de la ciencia y la cultura, y como colofn, no slo desmitifica su misma base cientfica, sino que enfrenta al Hombre con su ntima esencia mistificadora, su Artificio, en eterna confrontacin con su Natura.

w6XeQVZzaa	her main role was "dutiful daughter"|`|Fnku0eZcaa	Her relationship with her father was sort of distant.  He didn't understand what she wanted..He wanted to control every aspect of her life.|`|b4a0824fe7ce44242f750686fef6e1b6aa	The relationship between Juliet and her father could never be described as distant. It was a loving relationship where she was a dutiful daughter, until she met Romeo. At the point, she becomes the deceitful daughter who does things behind her father's back. However, he is unaware of this deception. He takes her refusal to marry as a refusal of her not trusting him. Remember, aristocratic father's often married their daughters off to the highest bidder or to one who might bring him higher social ranking.  Thus, Juliet's refusal to marry becomes not a refusal of her own, but of her father's desire. So, to answer your question, in short, it was a loving relationship she destroyed due to her not thinking about the consequences of marrying her family's enemy.
AA10691483	Fowltown was a Mikasuki village in southwestern Georgia, about 15 miles (24 km) east of Fort Scott. Chief Neamathla of Fowltown got into a dispute with the commander of Fort Scott over the use of land on the eastern side of the Flint River, essentially claiming Mikasuki sovereignty over the area. The land in southern Georgia had been ceded by the Creeks in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, but the Mikasukis did not consider themselves Creek, did not feel bound by the treaty, and did not accept that the Creeks had any right to cede Mikasuki land. In November 1817, General Gaines sent a force of 250 men to seize Neamathla. The first attempt was beaten off by the Mikasukis. The next day, November 22, 1817, the Mikasukis were driven from their village. Some historians date the start of the war to this attack on Fowltown. David Brydie Mitchell, former governor of Georgia and Creek Indian agent at the time, stated in a report to Congress that the attack on Fowltown was the start of the First Seminole War.[20]    (1835) As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. Settlers fled to safety as Seminoles attacked plantations and a militia wagon train. Two companies, totaling 108 men under the command of Maj. Francis L. Dade, were sent from Fort Brooke to reinforce Fort King. On December 28, 1835, Seminoles ambushed the soldiers and wiped out the command. Only two soldiers made it back to Fort Brooke, and one died of his wounds a few days later.

I live in the UK, where the paps are notorious. But what I didn't know is how much some celebs invite it upon themselves. Many celebs (not all, of course) tip off the paps when they want to be seen at some new restaurant launch or hanging out at a trendy club, but then complain when they are subsequently photographed drunk in the gutter. The paps attitude is they can't have it both ways. They can't go around desperately competing for the limelight, but only be photographed when it suits them.     Obviously this is just one side of the argument. I wouldn't want to be a pap and I don't condone many of their actions. But I certainly think that some celebs, especially the "it" crowd, are far worse, as they want to manipulate the media to suit their own ends.

Por otro lado en cuatro es mas pasivo que en tres, que parece ms dinmico pero no tanto como en dos que parece ms histrico.  Por ltimo tambien significa que el escultor que lo hizo en dos patas es mucho mas sabio que el que lo hizo en cuatro.  La figura ecuestre apoyada en dos patas implica la sabidura e inteligencia de que caballo y jinete, inmensos, se sostengan en dos puntos tan peque?o... por eso, los mas brutos, al hacerlo en dos patas le unen la cola a alguna piedra o arbusto para que se sostenga en tres lugares.|`|QmeG8rByaa	jajajaja|`|TiGK3Rtkaa	Una valentia y trabajador

Como bien sabemos argument a su favor solo como el lo saba hacer, sin embargo el veredicto fue en su contra por una minima diferencia.   De esta forma bebi de la copa y muri como un hroe puesto que dejo claro que los unicos que iban a perder con esta sentencia eran los Atenienses y sus principales acusadores.|`|BipgfnIJaa	Scrates, creo. Si fu el, fu porque paraba a las personas y las ayudaba a dudar de todo. Cuando dud de los dioses, los atenienses vieron que eso podra atentar contra la f, y le dio a elegir entre retractarse o morir. El eligi morir, para poder servir de ejemplo, y para que la gente viera que si alguien muere por una idea no puede estar muy errada. Fu una especie de Galileo, pero la importancia de Galileo lo salv de la santa inquisicin, el filsofo no era muy importante, era tratado como un loco epor estar en contra de los dioses.|`|2ahsB75eaa	Socrates.

3c3183980f9f93ffccfee6250ace1b88aa	Del estilo de Crepsculo, as de romnce paranormal, pero de romance al fin y al cabo, te recomiendo, Medianoche de Claudia Gray, Despertar de Smith, Amante oscuro (y derivados, aunque ojo porque son ms para adultos) de Ward, Un baile en la oscuridad de Karen Ranney, que dicho sea de paso es una historia muy muy tiernaa ^^   Y de la misma Stephenie Meyer, The Host, o El huesped en espa?ol. Nada que ver con vampiros pero,honestamente esta mucho mejor que Eclipse y Amanecer. LA cosa es as, el mundo es invadido por extraterrestres que se meten adentro de los humanos dominandolos por completo. Melanie se enamora de uno de los pocos humanos que quedan sobre la tierra, el problema es que un extraterrestre la posee y ella tiene que luchar por no dejar que "su huesped" la domine. Y todo se complica ms cuando el alien que lleva dentro se enamora de la misma persona que ella.  Otra de amor paranormal pero nada de vampiros, es Alas de fuego de Laura Gallego.  Es muy tierna esa historia tambin.      Veo que muchos te recomendaron las crnicas vampiricas de Anne Rice, y concuerdo porque son los mejores libros de vampiros, dejando de lado a Drcula, del mundo entero.  Pero si ests buscando, y veo que si, lectura del estilo Meyer, no te los recomiendo. Porque no son lectura simple, de tematicas livianas, como las de Meyer, Gray y compa?ia, sino que sus novelas tocan asuntos filosoficos, morales y religiosos, y hacen que el lector que los lee buscando el cliche romantico y la trama rosita termine aburrido.  Los vampiros de Anne son grandiosos, son seres maravillosos de verdad, pero no son adolescentes que estan super buenos y pretenden ser heroes, sino que son lo que son, vampiros, sanguinarios, asesinos, que matan y se resignan a matar. Viven atormentandose y debatiendose todas las cosas que te mencion antes. Sin contar con el detalle de que la mayora del tiempo "el romance" se da entre hombres, y aunque son muy, muy, muy tiernos, y aunque te resulta normal ya que los vampiros de Rice son asexuados, al lector que agarra el libro en busqueda de romance podra resultarle chocante.  En fin si te los recomiendo conmo novelas de vampiros, ms que a ninguna otra, pero no como romntica ni nada de eso.      Suerte|`|qf76xKKZaa	Hola!!!  Amante oscuro de J.R. Ward.

SXBlvE2Jaa	Yes. You can't publish books without a degree. And by the way, it's Twilight.|`|PjDXFpeGaa	Nope.  I dont think so.  But who knows what happens these days.  LOL|`|wKSvnna2aa	YES. Meyer graduated from "Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where she received a B.A. in English in 1995."    |`|qH1YcQ2kaa	yes she has a degree in english|`|uPixsPF8aa	Yes, and it's spelled Stepenie/Meyer/Twilight.|`|b0441ed0081d3155a746d2d9a804662caa	Yes, I think she got a degree in English at BYU.    As we all know, Stephenie is Mormon.    (just like me!)|`|AA10198825	yes, BYU
J6C7zr7Raa	yes this is ok to do. I find it actually helps the friction. When the satin is gone your left with that rough wood? plastic (different with different brands of toes shoes) that makes it not slippery when you turn.Just cut of the fraying satin. You don't have to burn it, but you can. It does help it from fraying further. But it is not necessary.|`|4m8jryUmaa	yeah but you might want to burn the edges so that it doesn't fray|`|WvmqcFE3aa	yeah, tons of girls at my studio do that. it helps with the friction. now it wont be so slippery sometimes:]|`|SZtHgFFraa	Yes it is actually.  When I wore pointe shoes I started putting tape on the toe to make it stick more to the floor.  When I had recitals or competitions I put my shoe cover over them that had leather on the tips.  It definitely helped.  I would recommend that you watch "Center Stage".  There is a scene where they are doing many different things to their shoes.  Some great ideas! |`|Dp9F20QSaa	yeah that is fine just make sure it is neat after you cut around it might be a good idea to glue the area around where you cut!! good luck|`|oslp1oH9aa	yes this is completly fine. It'll help you alot with your balance, and it will make the platform alot less slippery. A great thing to do is:    1) Trim the satin around the edges of the platform.    2) Just slightly burn the edges so they do not frey, just like how you would burn the tips of your ribbons.    3) Apply a slef-adhessive moleskin to the end. All you have to do is buy the moleskin (you can find it for very cheap at pretty much any drug store) and trace the platform onto it. Cut it out, remove the adhesive paper on the back, stick the moleskin on and VIOLA! PERFECT POINTSHOES!!!|`|v0OPcoYcaa	burning the edges didn't really work for me  but you can go and buy moleskin at the drugstore and glue it to the top
bofqpDw7aa	First of all, a sketchbook that's A4 and square isn't very artistic or interesting. I fit were me, I would use an A3. But if you've already used this sketchbook you'll have to use with what you have.<br>  <br>  I'm taking Art and Design as a GCSE, so I might not have as much experience as you do but I do have a major tip. Treat your sketchbook as a work or piece that you are doing for your Diploma. <br>  <br>  Whatever you're subject is in the Diploma try to incorporate your subject or topic in your book, for example, if the topic was butterflies, then sketch a few butterflies in the background of a page that you are writing on, that way you are showing your examiner that you are thinking outside of the box and you can present your work artistically. <br>  <br>  But I would still try and get a bigger sketchbook there's more room!|`|VG4yYvrsaa	Study the layout and design on these web pages (they won prizes)|`|LOVCVuu5aa	just wanted to mention that you dont have to have a massive sketchbook for it to be good or interesting. If you work better on a larger scale then thats good, but some people like myself work better in a smaller sketchbook. I find it difficult to fill the space in a larger book so i always use smaller ones, I just use more pages.
Swmd0P2uaa	<a href="http://www.bigceramicstore.com/Supplies/KilnFurniture/StiltsBeadTilePlate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigceramicstore.com/Supplies/...</a> You can use stilts to a finished bone dry project to give support, but if you are looking for something to put Inside the clay, I have always used paper cups. (100% paper) I always try my best to asess the bone dry piece- and take out the cups or balls of newspaper whenever I can because its potentially hazardous to have lots of paper in the kiln. But if you are just used a little bit it shouldnt be a big deal. If you wanted to get armeture wire supports for inside the clay, or armature stands- you can buy those from a clay supply store here are some <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk2y49fBLE4C&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=sculpture+supports+for+firing&source=bl&ots=MWNBPcQUVb&sig=gIigXTcP3No8WEO3AbT5MH6h9A0&hl=en&ei=oW2lSaPjNY3BtgeI-MzLBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA30,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk2y49f...</a><br>  I suggest you look up how to make armature for clay- you could find some techniques to do at home!

Sin embargo sigue intacto el misterio del origen de los extraterrestres y  de su  existencia . Aunque la hiptesis extraterrestre,  sigue siendo favor de mucho pblico (apoyada por numerosa pelculas sobre el tema), hoy puede considerarse demostrado que ningn planeta del sistema solar excepto la Tierra alberga una civilizacin tcnicamente adelantada, o por mejor decir y con seguridad casi total, tampoco vida de ninguna especie. (hasta el momento).  Por lo que descarta las propuestas de la primitiva ciencia-ficcin, de que  tengamos contacto con seres de otros planetas (si es que los hay).

Pero aquel dia vinieron sin avisar y no esperabamos eso, no obstante fuimos nosotros quienes no avisamos que ibamos a ir.    La sorpresa fue mayuscula y la fuerza telepatica muy intensa. Entoces supe que no estabamos preparados. El miedo nos inund y no paramos de correr.     Pero como somos unos cachondos no abortamos los planes de acampar y lo hicimos.    Luego los vimos pasar con las famosas luces y otras cosas mas tipicas de avistamientos.    Pero al pricipio y estando delante de ellos te puedo decir que el hombre que se acerque ha de ser puro.    Pues te sientes como pecador y no soportas el peso teleptico y se siente uno como en un estado de consciencia muy fuerte. Despues el miedo te atenaza y hechamos a correr.    Estan aqui y no me han hecho nada malo, pese a interrumpirles una cosa muy importante.    Yo no estaba preparado y no lo estoy, pues repito, puro ha de ser el hombre que afronte lo desconocido sin miedo.    Ahora convivimos pero prefiero no cruzarme con ellos.    Algo est pasando, no soy el unico que lo sabe. Pero no me gusta el comportamiento de la gente del lugar.     No se si es por los hombres de *****, que les estan presionando o por lo impresionante del caso.    Esta pobre gente vive en el miedo continuo. Y callan, pues algo les esta atemorizando.    Realmente no estamos preparados.    No ostante conmigo se portaron bien. Ellos estan ahi. No me importa todo lo contrario me agrada.    Pero lo que no me gusta es ver como gente del lugar es presionada, por unos hombres con un traje ***** impecable. Que lo vi con mis propios ojos.    No estamos preparados.

Bien es cierto, que si los extraterrestres buscan paz. No creo probable que los hombre comprendan aquello.

Y como est en nuestra naturaleza, buscamos la guerra por conflictos.

Que no seamos buenos con nosotros mismos, no es indicador para decir que no podamos aceptar a seres diferentes a nosotros.

DEFINITIVAMENTE NO.   El hombre todavia debe progresar ms y no me refiero a tecnologicamente. Hay mucha moral, religin, sicologia, etc, que no esta preparada.

Por poner un ejemplo en America los nativos no estaban preparados para la llegada de los Europeos o Africa... y eso que eramos del mismo mundo y de la misma especie.

Y con respecto a alguien que contest que los humanos interactuan bien con perros, delfines, etc, creo que solo funciona porque el hombre sigue creyendo que es superior a estos animales, si no fjate como convive el hombre con el oso o el len por ejemplo; no existe convivencia a nivel de relacin, mas bien se tiende a exterminarlos.

Aceptamos la diversidad cultural siempre y cuando se mantenga cada uno en su propio entorno y resolvemos nuestras diferencias de forma poco pacfica. No creo que milagrosamente aceptemos algo que viene de no se sabe dnde.  Si los dirigentes de las potencias se ven en la necesidad de establecer contactos o alianzas espaciales tendremos que aceptarlo y acostumbrarnos, pero espero que eso no ocurra nunca.

Y por supuesto tambin en otros aspectos, pudiendo tener capacidades, estructuras corporales, ciclos de vida, etc distintas a las nuestras.    El Universo est lleno de sistemas estelares y muchos de sus planetas tienen que ser habitables desde muchos millones de a?os atrs. La evolucin a una (o a muchas) especie/s inteligente/s ha podido tener lugar en el Universo desde hace millones de a?os.   La propia Tierra es habitable desde hace millones de a?os y en general existe la tendencia de asociar la historia del Hombre con la historia de la Tierra, de creernos que antes de que el hombre pudiera escribir no haba otros seres inteligentes, y mucho menos que ninguno de ellos haya podido pisar la Tierra antes que el hombre. La tradicional historia escrita del hombre es un grano en un granero, no ms. Y adems el tiempo se lo come todo despiadadamente.     Vamos a cambiar de lado. Si nosotros (lase la Nasa-el gobierno de turno-los militares de turno) dentro de unos miles de a?os encontrsemos y visitsemos otro sistema solar con un planetilla lleno de Neandertales, ?qu haramos?; nada nos podran ense?ar de su ciencia (nosotros ya pasamos por all, el hacha de piedra, el fuego y cosas as), su conocimiento nos resultara primitivo y poco til para nosotros ?para qu intervenir? Bueno, siendo como somos, sospecho que nosotros iramos en todo caso a posesionarnos de sus riquezas, de su oro, su uranio, su trabajo o algo que sacarles, o quiz estaramos suficientemente evolucionados como Seres Humanos para no actuar de ese modo y respetar su propia evolucin. Quiz simplemente los observaramos y haramos peque?os experimentos sobre ellos, ms o menos abusivos, o quiz nos diera por forzar su evolucin (ingeniera gentica: podramos traspasarles unos pocos genes para hacer brotar ...  un homo sapiens ... ? a nuestra imagen y semejanza, claro) para poder ponernos a niveles ms parecidos y comunicarnos o utilizarlos de forma fructfera. Para ellos, indudablemente, seramos Dioses.  Cuando llegase el momento de un contacto planetario amplio, tanto para ayudarles como para utilizarles, supongo que nos importara que tuviesen un grado "suficiente"(segn nuestro propio criterio) de evolucin. Y la decisin de darnos a conocer sera nicamente nuestra, e iramos bastante seguros de que ellos no nos podran hacer da?o (bien provistos, que se dice).    Curiosamente nosotros mismos tuvimos un salto evolutivo inexplicable hace unos 300.000 a?os. Se agregaron a nuestro genoma 223 genes que no tienen antecedentes coherentes en la vida en la Tierra, cito a Zecharia Sitchin (leedle, lo que se est descubriendo en las llamadas tablillas sumerias es una historia alucinante, es el registro escrito (en lenguaje cuneiforme) ms antiguo que se ha encontrado y habla de la historia sobre la Tierra desde 450.000 a?os atrs, el Gnesis est ah, el diluvio, las ciudades perdidas de la antigedad, etc.. pero ms extenso y menos manipulado que en la Biblia. La historia del sistema solar, cmo se form la luna, la Tierra y el cinturn de asteroides... En fin, ms que sorprendente).  .. eh... como deca cito a Z.Sitchin:  " Estaban rastreando el proceso evolutivo, rastreando el registro evolutivo vertical contenido en el humano y analizando otro genoma, los cientficos se encontraron con un enigma. "Rascndose la cabeza estaba el consorcio cientfico debido a este descubrimiento ," la ciencia descubri que el genoma humano contiene 223 genes que no tienen predecesores en el rbol evolutivo.  ?Como y de donde pudo el ser humano adquirir semejante cantidad de genes?  En la progresin evolutiva de las bacterias a los invertebrados (como el linaje del hongo de la levadura, gusanos y moscas que se han descifrado) o los vertebrados (ratones, chimpancs) y los humanos finalmente modernos, estos 223 genes son completamente extra?os en la fase de los invertebrados. Por consiguiente, los cientficos pueden explicar su presencia en el genoma humano como algo que se incorporo muy recientemente (en escalas evolutivas)"    La verdad que se quedaron perplejos, y en un intento de dar respuestas a todo (qu mana!) dijeron que se traspasaron directamente de las bacterias, as de golpe, pero esta teora hace ms aguas que el Titanic por otra serie de estudios que ... Bueno este tema tiene demasiada miga as que lo dejo porque si no no acabo.    ***  A cuento de este tema de los extraterrestres observo que ltimamente hay un gran flujo de preguntas, informacin y "sondeos" como inadvertidos sobre este tema.

AA12025213	Well, you have to realize that this is not only on guitar. This is a fundamental music theory principal. These notes that have 2 names are called 'enharmonic tones'. <br>  <br>  The reason they have two names is because flats and sharps are more directions of what to do to the note than they are separate entities. Think of flat as lowering a note a half step and sharp as raising a note a half step. This will help the whole system seem a lot easier and help you understand double flats and sharps (notes lowered or raised 2 half steps, or one whole step). So really, a sharped A IS the same note as a flatted B. As well as a B is the same note as a Cb, a F as a E#, a D as a Cx (double sharp), and also as a Ebb (double flat). In reality, each note has about 4 names, except for the natural semitones (B and C/E and F) which have 2.<br>  <br>  Also, depending on which scale you are using, you are going to use either a flat or a sharp. For example, if you are playing a Bb in F major, you will not call it an A#. If you were playing E# major, then you would call the note A#, because you don't mix flats and sharps in the same major, or natural minor scales. <br>  <br>  I know that theory is extremely confusing at first, but all it really is at first is 600 different ways of looking at a major scale. Once you progress onto other stuff, all of these ways start making sense.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Just to say that a different way, when we're using a diatonic scale (ie major, minor, etc) we only want to use each letter once. This makes naming chords, chord analysis, etc waaay easier.<br>  <br>  Let's see if we can pick an example to illustrate *why* it's easier.<br>  <br>  How about something with a key signature of ... four sharps.<br>  <br>  key of E major - E F# G# A B C# D# E<br>  <br>  Now, I suppose I could also call it the key of Fb, right?<br>  <br>  key of Fb major - Fb Gb Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb Fb<br>  <br>  Oops, looks like we have a double-flat on the B. Do you want to try and figure out that Bbb = A ? I don't know a single musician who is wild about having double-flats in the music they play... so perhaps that's reason enough, mmm?<br>  <br>  Really, though, at the end of the day its all about simplicity. What would take 8 flats instead could use 4 sharps. That's a lot of accidentals either way, but it's easier for a musician playing something like a flute or a cello (a real instrument, ha ha ha) to think in terms of 4 sharps vs 8 flats.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	Music theory impacts all musical instruments except for the juice harp and drums.<br>  <br>  Learn your music theory as it relates to the guitar and you'll be a happy camper.|`|jvPToF4Laa	Even though it is the same note, you use them in different contexts. Let's say you are in the key of F - scale is F, G, A, b flat, C, D, E, F. Key of G is  G A B C D E F sharp G.<br>  <br>  If I only used sharps OR flats, then I can't write both scales without repeating a letter, or using (double sharp) or (double flat). It keeps the notation easier and cleaner.|`|nBuUfUdkaa	it's the same on the piano dude.

nQ3kFPMVaa	You should take a university/college course in stage management and/or production management. It is also a good idea to undertake classes in audio production, where you learn about mixing desks, amplifiers, etc. Most stage managers start by being roadies: find a band to become a roadie with, or join a large company that hires crew and roadies on a regular basis. It would take a long time to work your way from general roadie to stage manager, and you will definitely need some experience before doing it professionally.|`|b8TgKnBwaa	You need to know people.

jvPToF4Laa	"Politeness" is, of course, about the subversive fifth column in British society, dedicated to the overthrow of the government. Mr Milne, and now his son Christopher Robin, are well known advocates of Revolution. This poem is an incitement, in that stiff-lipped British style, to overthrow societal norms, leading to eventual havoc, and public rudeness.<br>  <br>  "Jonathan O", on the other hand, is a more directly Communist manifesto. From each as they are able, to each as they need, all paid for by simple acquiescence.

The large part of these were in Africa.<br>  <br>  Today there are still a small number of British Overseas Territories, mostly small islands where independence would be impractical.  The biggest such territory is Bermuda, which voted against independence in a 1995 referendum.<br>  <br>  Another legacy of the Empire is the Commonwealth of Nations, a 'club' of countries that cooperate on a large range of issues.  The Commonwealth also includes Mozambique which was never a British colony.<br>  <br>  The term "British Empire" is now used only in a historical context.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No, it is not part of the British Empire, it is however still a member of the Commonwealth.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	No, they recieved independence in 1901, they are however part of the Commonwealth as is New Zealand and Canada.|`|shVgCizBaa	Is australia still part of the brittish empire?It is an independent country but has some ties with Great Britain like Canada.-------  The Commonwealth of Australia is a constitutional democracy based on a federal division of powers. The form of government used in Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General at federal level and by the Governors at state level. Although the Constitution gives extensive executive powers to the Governor-General, these are normally exercised only on the advice of the Prime Minister. The most notable exercise of the Governor-General's reserve powers outside the Prime Minister's direction was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional . The final constitutional ties between Australia and the UK were severed with the passing of the Australia Act 1986, ending any British role in the government of the Australian States, and ending judicial appeals to the UK Privy Council.[30] At the 1999 referendum, 54% of Australian voters rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by two-thirds vote of both houses of the Australian Parliament. Since the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972, there has been an increasing focus on the expansion of ties with other Pacific Rim nations while maintaining close ties with Australia's traditional allies and trading partners.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia</a><br>   Australia Act 1986<br>    Australia Act 1986 (United Kingdom) document, located in Parliament House, CanberraThe Australia Act 1986 is the name given to a pair of two separate but related pieces of legislation: one an Act of the Parliament of Australia (No. 142 of 1985), the other an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (c.2 1986). These Acts eliminated the remaining ties between the legislature and judiciary of Australia and their counterparts in the United Kingdom.

Enabling legislation to bring the act into force was passed by the parliaments of the United Kingdom and each of the Australian states. <br>  <br>  One of the most significant powers of the act was the termination of appeals from Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The act removed the Privy Council from the remaining "direct lines of appeal" in the Australian legal system (particularly in state legal systems) placing greater emphasis on the High Court of Australia as the final court of appeal in Australian law. <br>  <br>  Prior to this act, the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 made the High Court the final court of appeal on both Constitutional and Federal Matters. The exception to this was inter-se constitutional matters, which are still permitted to appeal to the Privy Council if the court issues a certificate under section 74 of the Australian Constitution.|`|rgPmkqwXaa	Get with the program, dear......the British Empire disappeared shortly after World War II (that's 1945 to you...) when India declared it's independence....|`|hyY9Vw1Waa	No, Australia is a country developed by poor America.|`|BvcTVXeKaa	nope
AA11725139	I received my B.F.A. in 1983.  A strategy which has served me well is to listen to my heart.  You already have a natural affinity for something; you have a topic or subject area about which you are more passionate.  The best work is done when you pursue your passion, even if you don't initially have a project idea.  Choose a direction, then go for a walk - "back burner" the idea. Try to keep your mind open to what your intuition might be saying.  You can always fall back on the cake idea if nothing else materializes, but first, pursue excellence in concept as well as execution.  This isn't just a grade, or a pass/fail, but a reflection of you.  Make yourself proud!<br>  <br>  You can contact me @ www.goddessofthrift.typepad.com|`|xKnCfHe2aa	blah|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Reversal sounds promising- you could do some stunning images using mirrors as your starting- point. Look at  Bridget Riley's marvelous optical art paintings to give you ideas. Cakes, well, only if you're desperate; it's a tough topic to pull off without being obvious, corny or over- illustrative. if you should want to try, study American Pop Art first|`|fynzkVK4aa	I really like your reversal idea; it could even be opened up to include things like role reversal (imagine the Queen vid for "I want to break free" for an extreme example lol), reversal of fortune, you could even do it from the point of reversal in time, go back to arts and crafts type techniques or art forms that were prevalent in previous times, something like that...or deconstructivism or whatever the word is lol..<br>  <br>  I just find the whole reversal thing a lot more interesting and with a lot more scope; don't forget this is something you will be working on for a long time, so you don't want something that you may get bored of, rather something that may stretch you and leave you lots of options open to explore if you find you want to take a slightly different direction with things.<br>  <br>  Best of luck whichever you decide! :)
a3aPxXOjaa	Once the ceramic tile is glazed, the top coating becomes glass.  Therefore, a glass etching acid would allow you to etch it.  That will give the surface"tooth" and will receive and hold your paint.  Check on "glass etching" for the required acid.  Another option would be a light sand blasting.<br>  <br>  You can gold leaf the glazed tile without etching.  Gold leafed signs on glass doors are very common.  Its tricky to apply, and vulnerable to scuffung off if not protected.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.
wtC4xtNEaa	Cecilia Ahern writes brilliant romance books. 'Where Rainbows End' is probably my favourite and she also wrote 'P.S. I Love You'. Harriet Evans 'The Love of Her Life' is good too. Malorie Blackman's series that begins with 'Noughts and Crosses' isn't a typical romance but is also very moving. 'The time Traveller's Wife' is also very good.|`|7APv8E6Taa	It really depends on what type of romance you are looking at. Romance has several subgenres in it.<br>  <br>  I personally like Johanna Lindsey. She has a variety of stories: old west, future, historical vickings, and regency.<br>  <br>  Nora Roberts is good. I agree. She is more modern day.<br>  <br>  I do not suggest Twilight. It is not romance.<br>  <br>  If you go to www.barnesandnoble.com you can do a search of authors based off your prefences. <br>  <br>  Here are a few other authors I like: Karen Moning, Sabrina Jeffries, Stephanie Laurens, Catherine Coulter, Lynsay Sands, Jude Devereaux (spelling ?), J R Ward, and Christine Feehan.|`|IZB8dfhZaa	Nights In Rodanithe<br>  <br>  i luv this novel... a beautiful romantic story........|`|ivejg4whaa	Nora Roberts- The Three Sisters Island triology.
