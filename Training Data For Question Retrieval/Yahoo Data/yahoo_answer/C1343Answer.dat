4jUqOBWZaa	The Brave One is a remake of Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" series. Which was very controversial when it came out. This was around the time of the Bernard Goetz Subway shootings. It is about getting even with violent criminals. <br>  <br>  Lopez's movie was an ambush pure and simple. It was premeditated Murder. And she committed a criminal act as a "Victim", who engaged in a Pre emptive strike against her Violent Husband. Are we justified taking pre emptive action to protect ourselves? Where do you draw the line? And what is the actual motives of the Victim and the Perp? It is a very slipperly slope she is advocating in this movie.|`|XeH5FPM5aa	Watching the 5 minutes of the movie that I managed to make it through was abuse enough. Please don't make me relive those memories.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Contrived murder. Deserves the highest punishment allowable by law. She planned it, trained for it, changed her identity, created alibis...that doesn't count as self-defense.<br>  <br>  Agree with Feminecron. That movie is a mole in the face of Hollywood. So are movies like Tomb Raider.<br>  <br>  Trevor, In the movie Fatal Attraction, M. Douglas only drowns her. It's actually his wife who shoots the psycho G. Close.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Hmm... It's kind of like those movies that are 'revenge fantasy' stories. One example is "The Brave One", another was the one with the man who killed the gang that murdered his son (I forget the name of the movie). There have been a bunch of them, mostly featuring men who are taking revenge on someone who hurt their families.  Yeah, for the most part they're all murderers if you look at it from a legal stand point. <br>  <br>  The common thread uniting these movies is the power given to the individual.  They reflect a lack of trust in the system to do 'justice' to those who commit violent crimes against us. Men seem to love these moves just as much as women.  'Enough' is probably a little bit uncomfortable for them because it's about a woman killing an abusive man.  In "The Brave One", she's avenging the death of her husband, so it's less 'icky'.  <br>  <br>  Personally I'm not a fan of this type of vigilantism, but I know why people feel this way about the system. Before my mother married my father, she was married to a man who tried to kill her on several occasions for her life insurance policy (played Russian roulette with her, tried to throw her off a cliff).  She left him and got a restraining order. He showed up outside of her house with a gun and the police wouldn't come out until he was actually in the house. If there had been a child involved, she told me that she might have killed him that night to save her child.|`|HNAdM1hSaa	Well said Capricorn!  ^5!  Jennifer Lopez did not portray a very good Krav Maga Martial Art fighter.  The worst part is that these movies give women the wrong idea about martial arts, one learns martial arts to defend not to fight, and nne cannot learn and master any Martial Arts and automatically beat someone on their first try at it.  Regardless what her husband had done to her in the past, this cannot be construed as self - defense because she illegally entered her husband's premises with her the intentions of killing him.  That is premeditated murder and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  =P|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I haven't seen the movie and don't know the storyline.  Why does she kill him?  Why does she break into his house?<br>  If she broke into the house to kill him, then it is murder.  But I should imagine this is just a story.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	She is underrated, and should stick to movies and stay away from music studios.|`|TENkAmvXaa	self defense|`|IjKndeVvaa	It's premeditated. It's murder.<br>  Another issue the movie brings up is the idea of justified killing. I personally don't believe any murder is justifiable, but I can certainly sympathize with her character. I look at it this way. There are circumstances where I would most certainly kill a man and not think twice about it. If a man ever raped, abused, or killed a woman who I care about, he should be praying that cops find him before I do. When I got a hold of him, I would torture and kill him. Would it be justified? Not in the least. Would I feel good about it? While I'm doing it, absolutely. Would it make up for my loss? No, but I'd certainly feel better knowing he could never do that to another woman, and I'd happily spend the rest of my life behind bars knowing that scum is no longer walking this earth.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	This is an awesome question, because I'm trying to think of just one movie where a man premeditates a murder against a woman and is portrayed as the good guy for doing such.<br>  <br>  Can't think of one! Anyone want to help me? Anyone? Any feminists?<br>  <br>  The sad thing is I can turn on Lifetime movie network and find a slew of made-for-tv movies similar to "Enough," essentially glorifying violence against abusive men, saying that it's ok to break the law because "they deserve it."|`|6qPTQDdZaa	It's murder, but she'd be able to get off pretty lightly under the circumstances and the fact she was a woman.<br>  <br>  Okay, I've said pretty much the same thing a lot of people have said and I'm getting the thumbs down.  I don't get it.|`|WkLJI40baa	Krav Magna is the best defensive form to learn. Basically bar room fighting style.

If you plan for it etc. you have no defense whatsoever and in some parts of the country the movie plays in she gets the death row for it.<br>  <br>  The worst part is that those movies give women the wrong idea about martial arts. It works if the opponent does not expect it, like when he gets too toutchy feely, but in the dojo your opponent does not take advantage of you weighting a bit over 110 pounds.<br>  Pepper spray is for women better than any martial art.

srIMFTb8aa	I'm an American woman married to a Scottish guy and living in the UK for the past 8 months.  In my opinion, the US is far more sexist.

For example VAWA in the US favours women, and men who experience domestic violence from women in the UK can expect zero help compared to female victims. In fact if a man reports his female partner has attacked him there is:<br>  "? More likelihood of them being disbelieved or even ridiculed if they do<br>  ? A greater likelihood of being themselves arrested<br>  ? A dearth of effective support services for them including emergency accommodation – they being often directed to bed and breakfasts or hostels unsuitable for fathers with children"<br>  <a href="http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/PlightOfMaleVictimsSummaryMay08.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/Pligh...</a><br>  <br>  Edit<br>  The rate of DV between men and women is 50/50 but men are stronger so the injury rate in men is generally lower.

When you could just focus on something more positive . Like knowing that it doesn't matter what people think of woman or your abilities as a woman or man for that matter.I do have to agree that men and women have differences by standards enforced. Men have it equal struggles .Sexist men are very hurt they need a lot of support wish them well . They feel insecure about their places in the world and feel they need to validate themselves. By saying they are better than other beings. But do they form a unity with other men no they create power struggles . Feminist woman taking their beliefs to the extreme that they feel that women are superior lose touch with reality by trying to build an idealist society in which man doesn't exist. that is not reality . coexistence is the key and since you have the pondering mind to inquire such a query i would say good luck ;) as far as years and amounts of experience goes that is just another falsity of perception being that you have so many years of experience ,I would assume you would know that years of experience amount to nothing when innate rationality sets in.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	So know a whole country is sexist?

People lived on the margin of existence their whole lives. Disease, war, famine, where common. Women were not over weight. If anything, they were underweight. Miscarriages were common because of malnutrition in women. Please don't let those paintings of naked women from the 17th century fool you into believing that women heavier then.|`|t3Zuec0taa	They reference they're earlier life's experiences. As women get older, they tend to increase in weight (overall generalization of the population), and men expect 40yo women to be as thin and fit as they were when they were 20. Because mens' metabolism remains about the same for a longer period of time, which allows them to stay thinner for longer, they expect the same from women.|`|reLPODK9aa	The whole society men and women are getting bigger.

Those paintings did not represent a majority, back then being heavier meant you had more food which in turn meant you had more money.  Nowadays both sexes of every race are getting fatter, most noticeably in the United States due to the availability of fast food.  Things have actually flipped.  Nowadays people who are poor can be overweight because of the low prices of fast food whereas healthier food and gym memberships are more expensive.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	It isn't surprising to me, and I never asked that question.

All you have to do is look at the average size of women's clothing during the 1950's and compare it to the average size now.  (Also, you're going to have to consider that a size 8 today was more like a size 10 during the 1950's.)  The average male waist size has also increased, but you have to look at men over thirty to see the increase. Before they hit around 30-35, men have such a high metabolism that it takes concerted effort to get fat. <br>  <br>  I do believe that men and people in general tend to spend too much time putting down overweight women.  As I mentioned before, men usually have a higher metabolism. They may look better, but it still doesn't mean that the McDonald's isn't clogging their arteries and sending them to an early grave.<br>  <br>  Another sad thing is the encouragement of eating disorders within our society. I struggled with anorexia for years. When I finally got help, my boyfriend was disappointed because I gained 5 pounds.  (We're talking I was originally 5'4 and 105 lbs and I went to 110.) It's hard to maintain a healthy attitude about your body when everyone's always judging. I don't think that was so much the case years ago.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	"so, flabby or overweight white women in big numbers aren't something new"<br>  <br>  What are you basing that on? Just because certain historical figures, like Catherine the Great or whoever, happen to be fat doesn't mean they are representative of their societies. I think it's pretty obvious that Westerners have gotten much fatter in the last 30 or 40 years or so. <br>  <br>  Also, humanity is far older than 400 years. People of the early modern period - aristocrats included - were harldy a picture of health. However, "slim and slender bodies" were the norm before the agricultural revolution of about 12,000 years ago. Those few hunter-gather societies that are left that still don't have access to grains, starches and sugars are still full of slender people. So yeah, being unhealthy/overweight/diseased *is* a recent phenomenon, and it *is* unnatural. You can thank our high-carb, low fat diets for that.
mrIglvKiaa	I definitely presume that the issue is cultural as well. To back up my presumption I would introduce to you 2 scenarios regarding this issue, Collectivistic vs. Individualistic society.<br>  Collectivism is a term used to describe any moral, political, or social outlook that stresses human interdependence and the importance of a collective, rather than the importance of separate individuals.<br>  Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, or social outlook that stresses independence and self-reliance. Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires, while opposing most external interference upon one's choices, whether by society, or any other group or institution. Individualism is opposed to collectivism.<br>  As you can see these two definitions’ main difference is the interdependence vs. independence. <br>  United States is, according the most sociological research, an individualistic society where people usually try to live as individuals. Deal with their own problems, move out at the age of 18, pay their own bills, never ask help from parents etc. This type of living has influenced most of the black and white folks in the country. Because they are the one who lived the longest in United States. <br>  <br>  Just like in your answer, Asians, Hispanics and Indians, on the contrary, are from the Collectivistic society in which they strongly depend on each other. For example, stay in the family until married or graduate from University. Strong family connections, a lot more trust in their friends, thinking and supporting family even after moving out of the house. Basically thinking about the greater good of the whole group rather than one’s self…<br>  To expand on this idea, as an individual lives longer in USA, according to a social researches made by government,  they tend to become more and more individualistic, which is true to most of Black and White folks in the USA. However, Asians, Hispanics and Indians haven’t been living in USA long enough to change their way of living. <br>  Additionally, when they move to USA they bring strong sets of values, beliefs and traditions that will take more then 5-6 generations to fade away and be replaced by modern American sets.<br>  <br>  The bottom line for my argument is,  that it is not just the family ties but it is the whole system that makes people (Asians Hispanics and Indians) to help each other out in the time of need, family ties is just a small subcategory of bigger social structure that drives this way of living. My argument also predicts that as time passes by, we will see other Races in the streets. <br>  It is just a matter of time.|`|0s190C7Zaa	Wow like oh my God no way!|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	This is a good question, I also find myself thinking about this when I go downtown but I never think to look for a reason why. All of the reasons you listed are good ones, especially the part about other races having more close-knit families. I think another important fact is that the smaller a group is (whether they are the same religion, race, or culture) the stronger the bonds between members who aren't related, since blacks have been a minority in America for some time they have traditionally had stronger bonds than white Americans. Perhaps close-knit family members (as well as members of the same race who aren't related) prevent mental illness, and mental illness is one of the main reasons why people live on the streets. "An estimated 45% of homeless persons suffer from Axis I mental disorders, while undifferentiated mental health conditions run rampant."<br>  <br>  Also, blacks and whites Americans have lived in an individualistic society (individual based) for some time, while many other groups come from collectivist cultures (group based). Asians, Hispanics and Indians come from collectivist cultures, since they focus on the family instead of the individual there is less chance of mental health conditions.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	The close knit families that you mention are the primary reason, but I suspect that it's the black and white population who have the best education and are more aware of how homeless is not only tolerated, but supported by government.  The groups you've mentioned as less likely to be homeless are familiar with the hopeless plight that their countrymen have when homeless and they do not wish the same for themselves.|`|aGynBPbCaa	lol, most of the poor Mexicans i know live with family, your right on that.

Wish it would change, but they way everything is going its just going to get worse.|`|AA10548610	Saying that all homeless are black or white is like saying that all birds are geese or doves. Homelessness effects people of every race, color and national origin, men and women, young and old. and with the economy going down the tubes, its getting worse|`|vqZD2TzLaa	Your conclusion sounds logical.  I would only add that Hispanics, Asians, and Indians have always survived on much less than we have.

The answer is not to give up and die. It's to live through it, experience it and feel it. It does get easier I promise you.

srIMFTb8aa	Hi, Raj!  When are you joining that monastery?<br>  <br>  "People always ask me who makes the best cooks, men or women. It's an impossible question. If I said men, I would be accused of a sexist bias. Yet if I said women, I would be faced with the argument that none of the great chefs in history have been female. Well, there's a reason for that, but it's not a matter of gastronomic skill.<br>  <br>  In the days when there were legendary chefs like Careme, apprentices were sent into their kitchens to learn their profession from the very bottom. These were boys of eight or nine. They started by scrubbing vegetables, carrying garbage, cleaning pots and pans. They also had to lift heavy utensils and heavy boxes of food. As they learned to become deft with their hands, they developed muscle. This was not a job for a girl. It was beyond her physically, and it was hardly the proper moral environment for a young lady in the last century. Therefore, the tradition of the hero chefs grew up in the male image."|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Proof that the 'Patriarchy' has pervaded into the kitchen as well !|`|0s190C7Zaa	Maybe there is more male chefs than female chefs?

He5XWnJtaa	Budget deficits are created when a government's expenditures are greater than revenue.

The ratio of total US debt to GDP from 163 % in 1980 became 240% in 1990 and jumped to 346% in 2007.It is enormously aggravated with the dramatic developments of 2007-2008, including the addition to the public debt of $6 trillion liabilities of Fannie and Freddie and the $700 billion of the Paulson Plan. America has been transformed into a super-Argentina in a non-declared default. <br>  <br>  Its another sign of the agony of Capitalism, in this phase, Imperialism decline in an irreversible way.<br>  <br>  We are very  happy, everything is going on as we, Bolsheviks, forecasted years ago.|`|qEdp2IASaa	This is to: I , a happy Bolshevik'<br>  <br>     You may privately celebrate the recession in the united states but in long term we have recovered from crisis like these, it is countries like russia who suffer economic collapse and become the pathetic backwater, subject to the will of the united states and understandably upset about the poor condition to which your country has fallen. <br>  <br>  Instead of wishing bad things upon others why dont you hope for good things to happen to all people.
rLP9wjPtaa	It is a recession because economic output is decreasing.<br>  Economic output is decreasing because people are finding thier asset values decreasing, such as home value, 401k value, etc. As people have fewer assets (in dollar terms anyway), they tend to buy less, which means producers make less, and thus need fewer workers...etc.

ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream of outer space, represents your creativity. It may also indicate that something or someone has just came out of nowhere.<br>  <br>  To see a planet in your dream, signifies creativity, exploration, and new adventures. You may be trying to align yourself with untapped energies that you never knew you had. Do you remember seeing a certain planet in your dream? It may add signifigance.<br>  <br>  To see Jupiter in your dream, symbolizes creativity, energy, success, optimism, generosity, pleasure and extravagance. The dream may indicate your need to exhibit some of these qualities in your waking life. <br>   <br>  Best of luck. Hope this helped.
Z4W0V5SDaa	I think one of the biggest stereotypes of teenage males is that they're all sex obsessed. That that's all they want from a girl.

Something you need to take with you now and for the rest of your life is that you are inferior to no one. We are all human beings, created the same way. You are just as worthy to be on this planet as anyone else. Just because they may appear more energetic than you, doesn't mean they mean more in the grand scheme of things. <br>  <br>  I advise you to gather your courage and put yourself in as many social situations as possible with diverse varieties of people. Think of it as an exciting challenge - not an overwhelming pile of dread. The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll feel - the less you'll feel the need to avoid conversations with people. There comes a time when you need to break out of your comfort zone for your own good. After the first time, things will come more naturally. The other person is NOT judging you - they're too preoccupied in their own life to care about other people's imperfection. Believe in yourself and act sure of your words when you lead a conversation. Act in control and you'll BE in control. And believe it or not, the other person you're talking to may be just as anxious, but also may hide it well. Don't consider yourself alone in the problem, and don't assume it is hopeless. The struggle is only temporary.

If not, and you work, start interacting with people you work around more.|`|ShVxmkO8aa	yeah avoiding is not good<br>  <br>  face it head on<br>  <br>  get some counseling, get on some medication<br>  <br>  read books by vernon howard, guy finley, and deepak chopra
ZF8zu2ehaa	Don't give into peer pressure, sure that's the normal answer but it's true. Do what you desire. Do you think that it's safe for your friend to be smoking, or could you care less? It was her choice to smoke not you or your other friends. Just depends if you want to enroll in that part of her life.<br>  <br>  It's always good to sit down in a silent and relaxing room and just think about your options for a while.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well usually people say "support your own habit" I wouldn't be in this situation because I don't smoke, and I don't hang around people who do.  I have really bad allergies.  If she wants to smoke, she can buy her own cigarettes.|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	be honest with her, if you give her a cigarette now she will always come to you throughout your life but if you tell her clearly that your other best friend is worried for her and that you wont be able to give it to her, she wont ask you again|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Do whatever you think at-that-moment. It's very nice to offer a cigarette, but it can be bad too. Generalizing the situation only complicates things more to compensate. Being very specific makes things easier. I personally would give her a cigarette, but I don't care so much about addictions and health (in that way).|`|tmckNa4baa	Well, I would tell them the bad side effects of smoking and telling her ur not alone. We all care about u and dont want u to smoke. Smoking causes bad breath, yellow teeth, cancer or like mostly all the organs. A shorter life too. Once again, we care so much about u and dont want u to put ur life at risk. Now im asking this for u as a friend, plz quit smoking! I know its hard to quit but we'll all help u!|`|Iqco1PcQaa	tell her if she wants to smoke  she will have to smoke outside on her own.|`|atDbSj5Saa	It's not your responsibility to give her a cigarette, though it would usually be considered rude not to.  She's the one who made the decision to smoke, so it's not your problem.  Go ahead and give her a cigarette- so long as you're not pressuring her to smoke.  Oh, and tell her she should quit because nobody wants to pick up her slack because she's to weak from smoking.  I quit a few years back, it was to singlemost best decision I made.|`|r6ok7NbEaa	STOP SMOKING!!!! Common sense tells you that those damn things are killing you all off! Name one healthy thing about it, and then name one good reason to not stop...then, if that doesn't work, stop being so tight and give her a smoke.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	I think the choice is hers if she is of age to be smoking, but seriously, she needs to pay for her own habit.|`|qGDWbJKpaa	Tell her you dont want to die and your going to not smoke. If shes a good friend, she shouldnt care. If shes a better friend, she wont even ask.|`|RRa23mEGaa	decide how you feel about the situation and let your friend know.|`|Bu4n8YdEaa	it's her choice to smoke, I would give it to her if she really insisted.|`|cQJFmo8Baa	say you're out
KrkftOfkaa	Well if you keep stressing out like this and get "weird" about it you may just scare off potential mates.  :)  If you're worried about fertility go get a sperm count done if that will lift that off your worry list.<br>  <br>  To be honest I think more guys are more focused on not having kids when they are young than having them.  ha-ha.  Hard to say though.  I'm 30 myself, not married, have no driving desire to be married, and no immediate desire for children.  So it could just be MY perspective tainting things here.  In general I'd like to have kids, but I think I may be equally happy not having them as well.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Be open to any possibility. It's okay not to have a kid, but it can be awesome.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	This kind of situation is out of your control. I know that's not what you want to hear but whatever gift you were given is what you get. Think about your background knowledge. Is their a history of miscarriages or seminal issues in your family? If you look at your family history and find that your family is healthy you shouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that you should take some exercises for anxiety. Deep breathing is always good.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	Don't worry about it, if you don't you don't. They're are already enough friggin kids in this world. Let someone else have the headaches.|`|LmFGYK7laa	just try to focus on another aspect of your life for now , such as your career or something .... but ya it is normal because everyone wants to have kids and feel that they've done something important and useful with their life ...|`|qGDWbJKpaa	Many people feel this way. When you get older you start thinking about things like that. The American Dream. And if your going to be able to live it or not.|`|pqlhPnexaa	First of all, take a deep breath. It's going to be okay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people have this issue. A reason for this is that it's hardwired into the human psyche to want to reproduce. And as a person enters their twenties, they're also entering that prime reproduction age. So, what you're feeling right now is completely natural.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you want kids, you'll probably get them sooner or later. Instead of concentrating on what could go wrong, though, like fertility/age of partner, concentrate on making things go right. When you date, don't just go for the one-night-stand hot girl at the club... look for other balanced young people who you care about and could see long term potential with. Instead of partying and drinking, look at getting a good job and save money rather than spending it-- kids cost a LOT of money, and especially in today's economy, that's no joke.<br>  <br>  Once you find yourself on the right track towards having children of your own, perhaps your fears will abate a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I wish you the best with the whole having-kids thing!|`|B2UuTy2Yaa	Actually it is quite common, especially with men who have a low sperm count or have done a certain thing that might lead to the thought, such as weed.|`|RRa23mEGaa	you gotta relax, and everything will come together.|`|T2FoZCzLaa	don't worry about it|`|k3V1Hn5Kaa	yes
WKtakdsOaa	You are very pretty and you can get pregnant from kissing didnt anyone tell you that you dirty hussy|`|uXqDYPNVaa	That question sure is asked often there, but not nearly as much as "OMG does he like me?"<br>  <br>  EDIT: "No. He does not like you. He is very much enamoured with a man named Trevor. Now please attempt to buy, borrow, or steal a life as soon as possible."|`|YBQvzEhGaa	Yes on a scale of 1-10 you're a 9.|`|096b7gBHaa	i thought singles and dating is one of the most emptiest|`|RpHewn8gaa	You're prettier than a clean toilet bowl after Mexican food.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Ha ha Rio is right.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Yes, you are.  And I'll just bet you want to know if you could be pregnant too....
srIMFTb8aa	What a silly question.  You know none of us can get a man.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	Lol...what a great way to make dysfunctional friends. I don't hate men, but that's only because I haven't been in a relationship yet.|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Haha, nice wording.|`|RpHewn8gaa	Nothing twists the heart like a tale of unrequited love!|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Well at first he was charming, understanding, loving, sensitive, funny the list goes on. Over the years he became a stupid needy asshole. he wouldn't let me keep a job, he accused me falsely of cheating, he hit me and incited me to attack him. he does nothing but drink from the time he gets home until he passes out. it's honestly sad as hell to see someone who was so wonderful become such an ***.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Ooh ! I loved that 'he' could work on a used AAA battery, and 'he' came with a power-cord/charger !|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	He was also in love with ME.
4ThvQYi9aa	Most 'open' people tend to have bad skills when it come to judging others intensions. Being an 'open' person can make obvious flaws in others invisible, thus causing you to overlook major red flags and make it impossible decipher who is a good person and who isn't. Because of this you may end up with heaps of terrible people who you think are your friends. You may put your trust in people that you obviously shouldn't because you tend to overlook the fact that they are untrustworthy, stupid, selfish or using you. However, there is a difference in being 'open' and just being stupid.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	A lot of our anxieties center around being rejected. -when involved with people.- We are afraid that if we put out our companionship someone will reject it and you will be embarrassed or hurt.<br>  <br>  But you should be optimistic and think, "it's them that are missing out, not me."|`|qGDWbJKpaa	Its easier for you to get hurt.|`|23bgwpD1aa	scare people off|`|DXXpHKupaa	Fear<br>  Lust<br>  Anger<br>  Greed<br>  Sympathy<br>  <br>  F.L.A.G.S. that give people the opportunity to take advantage of you (especially those you just meet for the first time).<br>  <br>  One can be open and guarded at the same time, however-but this takes much practice.  It was easy for me, however-because I am a very closed person face to face.<br>  <br>  When I feel any of the F.L.A.G.S. taking over, I think to myself "How can I be taken advantage of in this situation."<br>  <br>  People who are not on guard against those they meet and openly reveal themselves are easily taken advantage of.|`|RRa23mEGaa	all your business will be on front street|`|tmckNa4baa	What the first guy said, easier for u to get hurt. Maybe for example if ur an open person and u tell a secret to them or something they spread it around the whole school.|`|O9HLoDj9aa	They'll be more able to control you during the conversation if you readily display your emotions. You can also get hurt more easily if people know your feelings.
1os95dHZaa	Only always! I'm having one at the end of March:) I got the absolute best toy ever at one. I got mine through Bedroom Magic, Its called the "Love Bird" OMG!!!!<br>  They really are allot of fun and you are cool enough to take it and go with the flow:) Have fun and think of us!|`|CnSaGHqWaa	I'm not a lady but my partner does those shows and I can tell you for sure that it's the presentation and information she gives that makes the party a success. The standard low grade party is no more than a bucket of dildo's. And some woman think that's cool, but when you have an intelligent educated representative who knows her product and how it's used best, it can be fun, educational and ultimately it will enhance your sex/romance life. Hopefully you won't end up just passing the vibrators around..|`|tyuxbdrnaa	What should you expect?<br>  Are you a man going to a ladies party, or a lady?<br>  That'll make a difference, for sure ;)<br>  Meh...it's just like a tupperware party, only the gadgets are a lot more useful!<br>  The guests will vary form outspoken, self proclaimed sexperts...to meek introverts...dying form embarrassment.<br>  The experience itself varies, depending on the host, the guests, the amount of alcohol consumed etc.<br>  Have fun.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	Is an adult top party some kind of perv age regression.|`|TOIB45Fgaa	me and my boyfriend are hosting one tonight. us men can have more fun at those parties. i bet i wouldn't kick mmmbeer out of our party!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Guilty!<br>  <br>  We call them a *Pure Romance* party. <br>  <br>  The party person will usually bring some of the toys, lubes & stuff for you too see and try out (not try the dildo's, but there are some edible lubes & powders & stuff). <br>  <br>  We also played a game with the LONG dildo. It was kinda like hot potato but you had to use only your knees. The winner got a free gift. <br>  <br>  It's almost the same as a candle or tupperware party but just a little naughtier. :)|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	*Gasp!  You?  A sex toy party?<br>  <br>  Why would you want to know?  Won't it be better if you just go and enjoy the surprise!|`|lXE75yQjaa	Actually, I have..and it was a blast! Honestly, my sides hurt for days from all of the laughing. I was amazed. Even the pastors wifes, etc...people you would NEVER expect were there...there were like 30 of us total.<br>  You will have a blast!|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	No, but consider yourself lucky, as sex toys are banned in certain states.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	Expect me on all fours wearing a saddle, I think you'll enjoy it.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yep. They overcharge for crappy toys.|`|mSaRuowKaa	Like Snufkin said, here in the UK we have Ann Summers parties. I can't go because I'm a bloke :( but apparently they good wholesome girly fun. Expect to have various vibrating implements placed on your nose though. They say that using a vibrator on your nose is the closest sensation to the real thing so you can test out loads of them by placing them on your nose. And they'll also try to sell you lots of stuff. Enjoy!|`|WKtakdsOaa	We have Ann Summers parties here which are the same thing. I have been to loads and they play some funny games at them. We got drunk and we had to play this dare type of game and my mate had to pretend to pole dance sexily on a street lamp post outside the house. She did it and didnt realise her neighbour was out walking the dog and was standing behind her lol.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I tried to go to one of those once but I got kicked out after I drank all the wine they were serving and then I asked the women if I could show them how to use the toys. <br>  <br>  The wife just can't take me anywhere without me getting kicked out.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	It is like a Tupperware party with various "massagers" and "personal aids".  They also sell "massage lotions".  Basically like Adam and Eve with a hostess and some snacks if you are lucky.|`|gHxmYuGmaa	Keep them clean is all I can tell you.<br>  <br>  You can end up with a rash or worse a staff infection.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	I think it's utterly revolting and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  *hides dildo*|`|emOhSyY5aa	I've never been, but then again I have my own adult toys.|`|Olz3goEaaa	I am an adult toy-party... of one.

5AaV7koHaa	Yes, having had physical and emotional pain during different times of my life, I can attest to the fact that, "time kills pain" meaning that if you wait long enough the pain will subside. <br>   Emotional pain is much harder on the psyche than physical pain, because the mind finds simple things to remind you of a lost child, lost love, what could have been...but didn't.<br>  I think it is better to say, "Time heals the pain, rather than kills it."|`|LFC1AcmGaa	Time does not kill pain.

zpmXGZsCaa	Unfortunately, a lot of degrees aren't in demand.  Still, you have skills.  Present them in a positive manner to prospective employers.  Also, you almost always start at the bottom of any business - even with a degree and experience.       <br>  <br>  The good new is that will and entrepreneurial spirit are the only things required to succeed in capitalism - even in tough economic times.  <br>  <br>  Read biographies of successful entrepreneurs,   Laurens Hammond or Steve Jobs, for example.  Also, the recent Economic Stimulus Bill includes loans for small business start-up capital.

Some people with no more than an eight grade education.  A woman in Albuquerque New Mexico started a business picking up dog poop from peoples yards, now her business is worth over a million dollars.  While I know many people with degrees, I don't know if any of them are actually doing work in the field their degree is in.  A lot of government jobs require a degree, any degree.  I would look into education, there is a shortage of teachers and some states are taking people with degrees and experience, but you don't need a teaching degree, even some colleges have people teaching that don't even have masters degrees, but just work experience in the field they are teaching in.  Have faith, something will come up.

AA11065140	In the U.S., it theoretically doesn't exist, which is probably why you don't find anything about it online.  Each state has slightly different laws on the books, but in general, kids can't work until they're 16.  Additionally, some states require that they get a work permit from their school, to ensure that they're keeping their grades up appropriately.<br>  <br>  That said, I'm sure it happens, but probably most often in small, family-run businesses.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	It's illegal in USA.

Someone who could help you physically and mentally get through this tough time?<br>  What your feeling is not abnormal and if addressed you will be your happy self again,but please don't ignore what is going on with you.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Depression is a blanket generalization. You can't describe it. You are just in conflict and need something new. Think differently and do different things.|`|2anFE839aa	I am the same way. I finally went to a doctor about it and he gave me some medication for it and I feel alot better now that I'm taking it. I still get depressed but not as bad as I used to. My best advice for you is to go to the doctor and see what he thinks.|`|uQZQTAAlaa	Yes you sound depressed. I don't know how to fix it besides take anti-depressant pills. I think you should hang out with a old friend or a childhood friend and have lunch or something, I think talking about their life might make you feel better. I don't know.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	it does sound like it<br>  maybe your depressed about something at school?<br>  did something happen?|`|lXaAFIHfaa	I think it is just normal teenage angst. You'll be fine in a few years.|`|esTE8THsaa	Has anything recently changed in your life?  New school?  Teacher or class causing anxiety?  You should first take a look at things and see if you can pinpoint any situational cause for anxiety or depression -- then you can focus your energy on either changing it or the way you view it.     <br>  <br>  If you can't link it to a situation, then you should probably talk to someone.  But please, for your sake, go at your own pace and don't allow yourself to be talked into anything you're uncomfortable with.  While medication helps many people, it doesn't always have to be the answer.  Sometimes just talking to the right person helps.  Good luck to you!|`|x7PYCl8Xaa	Yes, it is very possible that you are depressed. If you are to the point of having suicidal thoughts then you should definitly talk to someone. If you don't want to feel like this anymore, and I know you don't, the only way is to get treatment. Because depression can be caused by hormones and you will need medication. Please get help.

I wouldn't though.|`|0s190C7Zaa	I don't like it and think that for one he is to old for you, he is eager for sex and when is bored or had enough of you he will leave you.

Thats my opinion but you don't have to hear it.|`|HUlV93QFaa	I stopped at "Im 18 and hes 37". I dont need to read anymore than that.

It feels wrong for a reason! Talk to your parents and let them know u are trying to end it!

6GmtcZteaa	Yes I think so. I think you might just love them before you can open up to them, because its not about you always its mostly about them and what you admire about their charactersitics, and perhaps you havent open up yet but in time you know you well and you know the other person well be there to comfort you.|`|0s190C7Zaa	Yeah I would say it is possible.|`|pqlhPnexaa	It definitely is possible to love somebody, but at the same time have something about yourself that makes opening up to them extremly difficult. This is quite common in those who have had some type of issue in their childhood that made them distrustful of those they loved and were close to.<br>  <br>  If this isn't yet causing issues in your relationship I would say that you're okay, but if your partner is getting frusterated with your lack of ability to share your thoughts and whatever with him/her, maybe you should try making this leap.<br>  <br>  If your partner is a person who you would otherwise trust, maybe it's time for you to force yourself to bite the bullet and let them inside. If you know in your head that they're trustworthy, just remind yourself that they are NOT going to leave you over whatever you are going to say... in fact, them knowing more about what's going on inside your head will probably bring you guys closer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FhKtIk2Paa	Yes, depending on your personality you may not feel comfortable communicating your emotions/thoughts on a regular basis.  This can cause strain to a relationship, especially when the person you love needs to know what's going on in your head.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	It is, but: to know you is to love you.

I'm a strong and capable woman.  I listen to the plight of others, men or women, and try to either find good information, or give them advice based on my own personal experiences.<br>  <br>  I believe that it is possible that they've turned their ears off to the problems of others and not just men.  The trouble is that if you listen really closely you will hear everyone make excuses, whine and fuss instead of trying to fix things.<br>  <br>  Part of the thing is that men have been keeping women "down" for so long that it has become part of our nature to scratch and claw our way up out of the positions of non-power that men throughout the ages have put us in.  Remember Hillary Clinton?  The first hope for women's total equality.  She would have been as good a president as Mr. Obama, or Mr. McCain, or Mr. Romney or any of the candidates.  The problem is that there are still enough "men" around to find reasons to keep that woman from telling them what to do.<br>  <br>  Who runs a household?  Mom.  Who runs schools?

My mother-in-law is kind of like this. She's always saying how much more intelligent women are than men, and she always sides with the woman on every issue.

We had 'our own way' of solving problems; our own jargon (words we used to refer to our trade,) and our own close-knit group of friends.<br>  <br>  As chairman of trustees at my church, I was in another sub-culture. At church I dealt with people differently than at work. Again, we used language differently than at work, and of course there was a different set of friends.<br>  <br>  A third sub-culture of mine was at my karate dojo. Again, a different language set. We made war instead of love. And there was a third set of friends and aquaintances.<br>  <br>  Each different facet of your life can expose you to a different sub-culture.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Butch|`|HptXFxJ5aa	I DONT CARE..<br>  I DONT MIND IT BEING TRUE OR  FALSE<br>  BYE GADHAA.|`|RRa23mEGaa	True.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Everybody, not most.

ZF8zu2ehaa	This indicates that you are uneasy or annoyed about some situation or relationship. You are keeping these negative feelings to yourself instead of verbalizing it. Sometimes this situation is getting out of control for you and people around you are causing it.
ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream that you are scared, indicates that you are experiencing self-doubt You may be feeling a lack of control. Perhaps you are having second thoughts about a decision you have made. Anger often translates as fear, so also consider issues about which you are angry about in your waking life.<br>  <br>  To see Jesus in your dream, is saying that your greatest desires and goals will be realized. This dream serves to console and strengthen you in your times of adversity and struggle. You will rise above any situation and circumstance and become victorious.<br>  <br>  To see your own family in your dream, represents security, warmth and love. It could also symbolize bitterness, jealousy, or rivalry, depending on your relationship with your family. Alternatively, it could mean that you are overly dependent on your family, especially if the family members are in your recurring dreams .Consider also the significance of a particular family member or the relationship you have with them<br>  <br>  This could mean when you are scared you look to your family and jesus and try to overcome adversity when you are scared. I hope this helped :D|`|A1kD6XDCaa	Are you worried about your mom?  <br>  Most of the time, 'bad' dreams are caused by being worried. <br>  Your dream could also mean something that scares you is coming sometimes soon.
ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream that you or someone is insane, represents your retreat from reality. Alternatively, the dream suggests that some part of your life is out of control. You have difficulties in telling what is right and wrong. <br>  <br>  To see the police in your dream, indicates a failure to perform or to honor commitments. The police also symbolizes structure, rules, power, authority and control. Perhaps you need to put an end to your reckless behavior or else the law will catch up to you. You fear punishment. <br>  <br>  If you have a fear or phobia of clowns, the clown may represent a mysterious person in your life who mean you harm.

D4jZM26Paa	No. Firstly, it's there decision to do it. And, why would it undermine the equality of the woman any more than the man appearing in the same image/video? In fact, you could argue quite the opposite, consenting women exploit a weakness in men, for profit and fame. Look at someone like Jenna Jameson, she's a complete moron, yet is known across the world and has a lot of wealth, because of porn, she certainly wouldn't say it has undermined her equality.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Personally, I don't. It's an entertainment industry, where the actors are paid to do what they do.<br>  <br>  Let's hear what Feminist leader/GOD/ICON/Mentor A. Dworkin has to say about this.<br>  <br>  ? Feminists are often asked whether pornography causes rape. The fact is that rape and prostitution caused and continue to cause pornography. Politically, culturally, socially, sexually, and economically, rape and prostitution generated pornography; and pornography depends for its continued existence on the rape and prostitution of women.<br>  <br>  ? Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act. [Andrea testimony before the New York Attorney General's Commission on Pornography in 1986]<br>  <br>  ? Women, for centuries not having access to pornography and now unable to bear looking at the muck on the supermarket shelves, are astonished. Women do not believe that men believe what pornography says about women. But they do. From the worst to the best of them, they do.|`|0hSpsSByaa	If you are talking soft-core porn, while I may not personally like it, I don't think it really hurts women's equality.

What, exactly, does "full equality of women" even mean? I would like to have "full equality" with upper middle class and rich academic feminist hacks, who had their daddies write them checks to go to liberal arts schools to major in sophistry. I had to nearly get blown from the face of the earth in war to afford my college degree, and then I had to collect some debt on top of that to finish my studies, which has always left me in an "unequal" position relative to rich kids who just get a free ride from mommy and daddy. Most of the feminist academic hacks I have known in my life have all had vastly more priviliged backgrounds than I could even imagine, yet they always felt it imperitive to explain to me how I "participated in their oppression" by doing something like playing football or preferring pretty girls to homely ones. <br>  <br>  I am not saying there is no such thing as "male privilege," either--I will admit that women often have to deal with interpersonal bs that I, as a man, would never have to deal with. On the other hand, women tend to feel entitled to say inflamatory things that men would never say unless they were willing to risk a punch in the mouth. So even at the interpersonal level, "full equality" is kind of a specious category. <br>  <br>  I will try to answer you question a little bit, though. I do think that pornography often warps young mens' (and womens') views of sexuality and the female body. I also think that most people in that industry end up suffering in various ways as a result of doing that kind of work. I don't favor any sort of censorship and strongly believe consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want to do, but I will agree that pornography has some strong negative impacts on society. But "full equality of women"? That's just airy rhetoric.|`|XKk101Kqaa	Well, pornography was originally made for men.. but that too is becoming equal..i.e. Playgirl =)<br>  <br>  Some people think pornography shows women solely as submissive, but thats not true at all, i.e. dominatrix.<br>  <br>  I personally think pornography is dirty, and it makes me feel like a gross, desperate pervert for watching it, but I really don't think it impedes women's rights at all..<br>  <br>  I think it's more of a moral issue, not really a gender issue.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	absolutely YES.<br>  porn demeans women, in all porn movies you will see no love, no tenderness no respect for the woman from the man.

QvF8dR7Taa	believe it or not geography plays an important role,but not all of it,government plays a major role in a countries well being,in totalitarian states the standard of living is usually lower than a democracy,that's because the socialistic type governments take a large % of what people earn to support the suppression of the same peoples,in most 3 world countries they have a dictatorship that is only interested in the wealth being absorbed by the ruling Group in charge,like in africa,some strong henchman gets control and uses most of the national wealth to keep the people poor.it keeps the poor to busy eking out a living and doesn't leave anytime to rebel.those governments don't want a modern type country like ours,it would mean to much idle time to think about whats wrong with the way things are run,(we are headed that way now)the strong man type governments are usually the most inhumane and brutal of all,just think the most advanced country's in africa were ran by whites for many years,they didn't mistreat the blacks anywhere as bad as the governments that has replaced them,and living standards have dropped to about the same low as neighboring country's,and mass killings are the every day norm.the white ran country's had the same problem we have here ,ours is with people from south of the border slipping into the usa for a better standard of living,africans tried to sneak into the white country's worse than here,it was the only bright spot in the lives of most black africans,there dream was to go to south africa or rhodesia and get a job to earn money,they couldn't do that in there own country,if it hadn't been for outside agitation those country's would still exist to day.actually the black africans will work as hard as any one else,the problem is they cant keep what the earn so why earn it?the people running things in africa are similar to the ones running the middle east,where a few has all and many has none,the rich few inflame the many against Israel to divert there attention from them,so they can keep the national wealth and power,its a long ***-ed story but that's how things work almost every where,,|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Wealth is mix of work, culture, laws, etc...<br>  <br>  It all depends...

So in the end it still boils down to working hard or being lazy. <br>  <br>  The geography might play a role too, though. If finding food is easy (it grows on trees), then there is not reason to make machines or build industries. On the other side, if getting food might be so hard that you do not have time to develop machines. Europe is kinda in-between.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is the geo-political explanation. Europe's geography (mountains and woods) prevented any single country from establishing a Europe-wide empire, so countries were in constant arms race which spurred progress. <br>  <br>  By comparison, ancient China was the dominant power in the region, so although they did invent gunpowder and paper, they used them as luxury toys rather than tools of warfare or education.|`|19f3d453105301c1e4c25cb7c7b96aceaa	You can't make the assumption it comes down to lazy and hard working people because I consider myself lazy, but smart yet on the same hand, there might be hard working idiots, who don't get any productivity done.<br>  <br>  So, technology, capital, geography, everything plays a role. <br>  <br>  I'll give you a model: I get a morning newspaper, and I pay for that newspaper, which pays part of the salaries of the following people: the person who delivers my newspaper, the writers for my newspaper, etc. It also pays part of the price of the ink on the paper, the fixed cost of the printing press, etc.<br>  <br>  When the flow of money through an economy and the prices people are willing to pay, and thusly, the economy itself, indicate how rich a country is.|`|fSu5c3l1aa	Poor and rich country bifucation depends on a number of reasons other than the PRODUCTIVITY OF THE PEOPLE.

One of the biggest presumptions is that someone can take your mind and tell you what you mean. Psychology is a game of "seven degrees of separation".

If you are looking to connect a behavior to something else then you are likely to find it, no matter what the actual cause is. Everyone embodies EVERY archetype of sociological behavior. <br>  <br>  When using the tool of forgiveness (which is convenient), you can avoid repression of your feelings.

Since he's a senior he'll be graduating soon, and since he'll be graduating soon he'll most likely have to travel elsewhere for college/university. When that happens your relationship would be even more tragic. What if you won't be able to meet each other for more than once a year? Things will be much more difficult and things will change. <br>  <br>  If this is not the case, and if he'll be around near to you and you will both have time for each other, ask yourself if you'll change, or whether he might change. You have to talk this over then. If you really want to keep him and he really wants to keep you then you'll both talk of ways of communicating, that wouldn't be a problem. <br>  <br>  Then again... do you really want to be with this guy? You have to keep thinking. To be honest his interests seem to be more physical to me right now, seeing that he judged your relationship because he said you were too young, and then he said you were a good kisser. Too young for what? Well, I'm sorry but this is my assumption from what you've presented. In what ways do you like this boy? In what ways does he make you like him? What do you think he likes about you?|`|kafQ6AJBaa	That's a big gap for  some.Mainly because he will be going off to college soon.And trust me, no one wants a long distance relationship.Plus, it wouldn't be fair to him if he's away and is restricted.Emotionally and physically he has expeinced more things in life, and you still have some growing up to do.It makes it really hard, because you are still very young, while he's on the verge of adulthood.But if he's having doubts so soon in the relationship, then it's probably better if you two stay seperated|`|MrtQuBBJaa	Very simple. Just ask him beyond the good kiss, which is very important in and of itself, what aspect of you he likes most.

93Pmc3N1aa	Here's like, a really bad example of what the esay should sort of look like,. Say the person you can't talk to is Billy Macintosh and you can't talk to him because he's your dad, and your parents got divorced, and your mother won't let him talk to you. and you want to talk to him about how you got the part of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, ask him why he likes to swim.. and um.. tell him how much I missed him. Now here's like.. A kindergaren level intro paragraph, that you shouldnt use because it's just putting it into place.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>       In 2006 my parents were divorced, and I can no longer speak to my father, Billy Macintosh. But if I could speak to him for even just one hour, I would tell him how I got the part of Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz". My dad was also a big swim finatic, so I would ask him why he loved to swim, and of course I'd tell him how much I've missed  him.<br>       "Why oh why can't I?" may be a line familiarized in the song "Somewhere, Over the rainbow" sang by Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. but I ask, Why oh Why can't I speak to my dad. I recently got the part of Dorothy in The wizard of Oz, and I'd be sure to tell him that. This would be important news to him, because when I was about 4, we used to sit on the couch, Every weekend and watch the Wizard of Oz. It was OUR movie. But, when swimming was on, we couldn't watch the Wizard of Oz.<br>      My dad, was a huge swim fan. He used to watch swimming, swim himself, and even give swimming lessons at the community pool. If I could speak to him, I'd ask him how he even got into swimming. Was his dad or grandfather a swimmer? Was it just a spontainious liking? Or did he just start it for no reason as a kid, and fall in love with it? I don't know and I think it's very important to know too, because I love swimming as well, only because he loved swimming. Every time I dip in a pool or a lake to swim, the pain of the 3 years that has separated us kills. I miss him so much.<br>       3 years without the man I call my dad; complete misery. I'd want to  let him know that too. I bet he'd be able to relate. I'm his little girl. I'd come right out and say it. "Dad I missed you."<br>        So, If I could speak to my dad, that's what I would say to him. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>           <br>   Heres what your paragraphs should look like.<br>  Intro Pgraph-  An intro, restating the prompt, and your 2 or 3 things about what you would say to them.

ZF8zu2ehaa	Very long but stay with me it was hard to type<br>  <br>  First Dream<br>  To see a celebrity in your dream, represents your beliefs and understanding about him or her. Something in you waking life has triggered these similar beliefs and feelings. It is not uncommon that your obsession with a certain celebrity may carry over onto your dream world. Celebrities are often seen as heroes and all that is mighty. Also consider any puns within the name. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are watching a movie, suggests that you are watching life pass you by. Perhaps you are living  through the actions of others. Consider also how the movie isto situations in your waking life. Observe how the characters relate to you and how they may represent an aspect of yourself. <br>  <br>  Second Dream<br>  To dream that you are homosexual (but you are not in your waking life), represents a union with aspects of yourself. It is symbolic of self-love, self-acceptance, and compassion. If you are uncomfortable with homosexuality in your dream, then it suggests some fears or anxieties about your masculinity (if you are male) and femininity (if you are female).You may be experiencing some insecurity in your relations with the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  To see and hear rain falling, symbolizes forgiveness and grace. Falling rain may be a metaphor for tears, crying and sadness.<br>  <br>  Third Dream<br>  To see an old ex-boyfriend from childhood in your dream, refers to a freer relationship. The dream servers to bring you back to a time where the responsibilities of adulthood (or marriage) didn't interfere with the thrill of romance. You need to recapture the excitement, freedom, and feeling of youth that is lacking in your present relationship. <br>  <br>  To see friends in your dream, signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected, but are ready to acknowledge these rejected parts of yourself. The relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself. Additionally, this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. Ow hand cramp.
5UBDNxgCaa	Well My husband used to make 50 to 70 hours a week he now told he cant make more than 40 hours a week this has cause us to lose about $500 - $600 a month They have laid off people crossing my fingers that my husband isnt going to be one they let go, In lake charles, Louisiana I have seen circuit city, goodys, the kids room go out of buisness. There is talk that sears jcpennys and other retails may go out of buisness as well, also i just heard our postal is think about cuting back the amount of days they deliver our mail. we can make this me and my husband but in 5 months there will be 3 of us as I am pregnant and I dont know if we can make it then. Also my husband is having to donate plasma in order to pay some bills...|`|zQiwHJV6aa	They're making it sound like it's never happened before.  Economies ALWAYS fluctuate.  You will never have a perfect economy.  Personally I think the economy is better than the media tells us it is.<br>  <br>  My dad got laid off though.  He used to work for an Australian-based Internet site.  I know it's a recession, but some people try to make it seem like the Great Depression II.|`|l8zIak9Saa	Whose economy ? That's the question . For the last 30 years in govt service i could manage no flap to buy shares or trade shares . Whether it's goes to 21 K or dowm to mother earth i am not that way afected . Think of the 85 % of the indians who live halfdead staved and naked . It made no difrence to them either. For the 5 % filthy rich by coruption they are unaffected as govt of the bail them out . And the other 10 % middle and lower class who dreams to be rich overnight get stuck in the act.|`|xXhkRq0Caa	I think it is worst. I have several friends, including myself that are anxious because week by week we do not know if we are going to go to work and be told that we are laid off. Once thriving restaurants and typical hang out spots near me are so empty. It just seems like there is a black cloud hanging over everyone. When the rich and famous are shopping at the $.99 cents and $5.00 stores, I think it is time for people to really take the downturn economy seriously.|`|f618b034cf04f428ec5b56f1ef16bbafaa	The job of the media is to take an event and get attention, and that's exactly what they're doing, the same they did with terrorism.<br>  Bottom line, it's been worse.|`|JxYLnTGiaa	Actually NO. The economy has been worst than this before.. like in the 1980's.<br>  <br>  What scares the media, and people in general so much is the "unknown". We haven't hit the bottom yet, so we don't know how bad it will get. THAT's why everyone is panicking.... and ironically, that panic only makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Short answer... the media is doing more harm than good... as usual.
hOWNwpCLaa	I wish the government would use the grading system they used to use.  It seems that anyone these days can get an A.  Rather than actually educating the children to where they would be intelligent enough to make an A on their own, the government says "Hey, you're not smart enough to do this on your own, so we'll just go ahead and make an A the new C.  So, yeah, while years ago, this paper would have scored a C-, now we'll give it an A- instead, and we'll even put you on the honor roll!"  Does anyone care what this is doing to our society?  Children can barely write a decent paragraph these days...|`|kxleO480aa	I am an educator. My mother was an educator. All my friends are educators. I can tell you that indoctrination is the primary function of any state education system. They want children to learn to be obedient, uniform citizens. Napoleon used to brag that he could look at his watch and know what every child in France was learning. Public schools are hardly concerned with teaching kids how to think, but instead what to think. That is why they are so obsessed with curriculum. That is the essence of No Child Left Behind. The entire system is a massive exercise in group-think.<br>  Leaders in education think of learning in terms of production. They think that the learning is solely in the schools and must be put inside the children, as if they were some sort of knowledge factory. <br>  <br>  As far as changing things, the only thing I could suggest is to do like Plato and Aristotle and start your own school.
ZF8zu2ehaa	To see your family represents positive comfort, jealousy, or longing to be united with them. Depending on your relationship with that family member, your dream can be positive or negative.<br>  <br>  To see stars in your dream, symbolize success, your aspirations and your high ideals. The stars indicate that you are putting some decision in the hands of fate and luck. Alternatively, the stars may signify your desire for fame and fortune.<br>  <br>  To see a planet in your dream, signifies creativity, exploration, and new adventures. You may be trying to align yourself with untapped energies that you never knew you had. <br>  <br>  To see Saturn in your dream, represents discipline, constraints, and a conservative attitude. It is also indicative of the lessons of life bringing about destruction and rebirth. <br>  <br>  Whoo, hope this helps. Best of luck.|`|r6ok7NbEaa	There has been so much interest in what dreams mean. Truth be told, they don't mean anything. I had a dream once that my unbord child was snorting lines of kool-aid powder. Dreams are just the brains way of percieving something while common perceptors are "turned off" for a while. That's all there is to it. Stress about things that have meaning in your waking life, and you will find much more meaning.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	The fact that your sister and mother could not also see the stars and the planet suggests that you have different or higher hopes for yourself than they have. Are you studying anything that is creativity-based at college? like art, drama, music??
RpR3MkH2aa	It could be that your dreams are trying to tell you that there are 2 more guys you have yet to meet that will come into your life,that you will have strong feelings for.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	To see a couple in love or expressing love to each other, indicates much success ahead for you<br>  <br>  To dream of love of being in love, suggests intense feelings carried over from a waking relationship. It implies happiness and contentment with what you have and where you are in life. On the other hand, you may not be getting enough love in your daily life. We naturally long for the sense to belong and to be accepted.<br>  <br>  To see a stranger in your dream, symbolizes the part of yourself that is repressed and hidden. <br>  <br>  Could be a mixture best of luck.!|`|wvVPMjfjaa	Dreams have a funny way of showing our day dreams, fears and other things happening in our lives. it could be that the 2 strangers your in love with could be that your unsure if your really know the man your in love with really.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	It means that some part of you even if you don't realize it in waking moments, doesn't want to commit to what you have.

8d8ejHPfaa	Well, looking at this imagery, you have a goal at the top of the stairs, and the goal is an education.  Looking at this imagery suggests that you find school hard to get through, you keep on, in spite of the obstacles before you, but that diploma is hard earned.  That you registered for community college shows that you understand you need an education if you are going to get anywhere in this world, but it sounds like you're not someone who finds this stuff to be a breeze. (Note that I'm not saying here that I think you're dumb or something, some folks just aren't very good at coping with traditional educational methods, or freeze up at test time, and things like that, even though they are actually very intelligent...) It's also possible that you might take on a heavier work load than other students in your class, and the stairs may be more challenging for this reason. Your career goals may demand more of a work load in your education, depending on what you are shooting for. On the one hand the monkey bars on the college steps seem like the steps have been made more challenging now that you are pursuing a higher education, on the other hand, monkey bars normally belong to a playground, this symbol could be saying that you need to take more time out to relax, or it could be saying that you are playing around too much, and need to work harder.  It's not surprising that you have it around the end or beginning of the school year, as these are times to look forward toward your future development.   As long as you keep progressing up the stairs, you're going in the right direction :) Good luck with your education....|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Ah ,me too.:)<br>  <a href="http://www.unclesirbobby.org.uk/dreamessaystairs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.unclesirbobby.org.uk/dreamess...</a>|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	The never-ending pursuit of an education. It's always one leading to another. It sounds like calling this an "obstacle course" would be accurate, with the whole monkey bars thing in there. Does your school have a lot of steps leading up to it? Are you going into law school? Usually prestigeous places carry an undertone of having many steps.<br>  <br>  The stairs represent your continuous push to make it to the top. You want an education because you want a successful career. The monkey bars, being a lot like the stairs except a "step above" them, most likely represents your transition to a Community College. Different obstacle, same trials.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream that you are walking up a flight of stairs, indicates that you are achieving a higher level of understanding. You are making progress into your spiritual/emotional/material journey.<br>  <br>  To see spiral or winding stairs, signify growth and/or rebirth. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|wvVPMjfjaa	progress in goals or descent in emotions.

Well, let's see here...the pebbles come from Earth, so they pertain to the material plane, they seem to relate to small problems or difficulties you encounter in the material world. You throw them into the Air, which takes them into the mental plane (ideas) they take flight, and turn into light (from idea to enlightenment).  Interesting...

5b81d6b881aa08e55896386627160825aa	The median of a series is one type of average.  It's the middle value; half of the values are above it, and half are below.

(I don't know if that's the median, I just chose that number as an example.) Then 30 percent of median would be $9,000, 50 percent of median would be $15,000, etc.

So no, I don't hit guys down there for fun.|`|e07f8c1e78556e477bf544de03c31b1aaa	Guys think hitting/punching guys in the nuts is a joke... ever heard of "Jacka$$"??  Also, dumb a$$ boys put up Youtube videos of themselves hitting/punching each other in the nuts and think it's hilarious.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I have never in my life heard of any female of any age doing this.<br>  <br>  I know of no female who thinks hitting guys in the nuts is a joke.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	It is not cool. Tell her if she hits you in the balls again you'll punch her in both boobs!|`|Q49EEdzbaa	Only if you enjoy pain. I'm a lady now when i was young i did that too. but you never know when the shoe is on the other foot. Next time punch her in her ****(female growin) and let her experience the pain that you experienced and see what kind of expression of pain she makes and see who has the last laugh.|`|mMOgjOQdaa	I've never hit a guy there for fun. I would only do it as self defense, but nothing else. I don't think it is funny at all. Don't accept that she did that to you, your "area" is as private as a woman's. Men don't hit women there (well, most men) so why should we hit men there?|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	*sigh* another fetishist....<br>  <br>  anyway, most women do not consider it a joke at all.... they know it hurts and most people dont hit a guy there for fun.<br>  <br>  i think you're a masochist.... that basically means that you get a sexual thrill from being hit "there" and being laughed at|`|tyuxbdrnaa	stupid<br>  immature<br>  dangerous<br>  wrong<br>  Of course you don't have to accept this.<br>  and why are all the important adult females in your life so clueless?<br>  Hopefully you'll not fall for that again.|`|nItZu6spaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    Of course not you dimwit. This question gets asked a lot on yahoo anwers. I'm having a lot of trouble believing that women would kick men in the balls for no reason.|`|haUBOM4Haa	It is a joke! You guys talk about how tough you are and act all macho, then the second the tiniest little bump hits you down there, you roll around on the ground crying like little babies!|`|OOVwqPd5aa	I hope they don't think it's a joke. That is wrong and inhumane. Mens privates are just as precious as women.|`|g7mD94cuaa	LMBO. That is the funniest thing I have heard yet! Accept that girls can hit guys in the balls for fun??? LOL. <br>  <br>  I think the answer to your question depends. I dont think girls would like getting punched in the chest by a guy for fun. But then again maybe the would. I dont know. Some girls do this for fun because they enjoy the attention and are insecure, others do it because, to them, it just seems like fun and it gives them something to laugh at. <br>  <br>  And sometimes guys just deserve it. <br>  <br>  Do you know how many things a guy does to a girl that seems like fun, but to the women its detested??<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit<br>  <br>  Haha I have to agree with sunflower. LOL

Bz3Cjfyjaa	It seems he refuse to do job. we no can be certain for what reason, but she no deserve same pay if she no do same work as others. Especially if happen all the time. You no can refuse to do job that you hired for!|`|DEc1C9hkaa	No.<br>  If the job description entails heavy lifting and one cannot complete the  task, they should either be rejected for the job or take a cut in pay.|`|g7mD94cuaa	In this case, no. She has failed to meet the job requirements and should thus be either fired or have her pay check lowered.|`|d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	I think they should be handing her a pink slip.  Behaviour like that should not be tolerated.|`|TINOKubBaa	Well no! But this is up to the employer. If it were piece work, she'd be making less money. That said, if the job's quality is improved at the expense of quantity, then it would be a hard call to make. Better quality work, might over time actually improve revenue. Women are built to tolerate hanging on to a 30 pound baby. Look at women in some foreign countries working in the fields. They likely have far more endurance than a man does. Of course most men can lift greater weights, but I've known many women who can work tirelessly all day long ! <br>  <br>  She should be able to  lift the 30 pounds unless she has a limiting condition .|`|XwqePXrOaa	Perhaps.  It depends.<br>  <br>  In one company whose name I won't mention because of my close ties to it, workers and machinists who regularly perform heavy manual labor are paid according to union codes based almost exclusively on their seniority; that is to say, no one gets different pay for doing their job better or worse; doing one's job badly simply increases the chance of getting fired and replaced.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, these workers suffer medical conditions that force them to temporarily sharply reduce the manual labor they perform.  This does not affect their pay.  This woman might easily fall into that category.<br>  <br>  If that's not the case, then perhaps this woman does not deserve equal pay, or perhaps she doesn't deserve the job at all.  But that doesn't mean that she doesn't deserve equal pay because she's female; it means she doesn't deserve equal pay because of failure to do equal work.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Yes she should.  It would be discrimination if she didn't.  Pay shouldn't be based on physical strength.  They hired her despite her unability to lift 70 pounds, so there's no reason to pay her less because she can't lift a heavy package.<br>  <br>  But since you mentioned that she refused to lift even light packages, then she shouldn't be getting paid at all, she should be fired.|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	That really depends on if she had a medical problem that prevented her from lifting heavy packages. You should have went to her supervisor and complained and then he could have addressed the situation.<br>  I believe under some law there is a lift that all employees should use if the package weighs over a certain amount to prevent back injuries.  :)|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	If the job requires heavy lifting and she has NEVER been able to tdo it, then no obviously she should not have even been hitred, never mind paid the same as the other employees.  If however, she has returned to work after an injury and has a lift restriction, then yes because it is implied that when she heals, she will resume regular duty.   Her apparently crap a$$ attitude however, should be fired on the spot|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Are you ******* kidding me? If she OR he can't do/ handle the duties that her/his job entails then not only should she/he NOT be paid she/he should be looking for another job.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Yup, you definitely should take one example of one woman and use it to create an all-encompassing theory about 51% of the world's human population. It's especially wonderful that you really don't even know her reasons for her actions. E.g. maybe she had health issues, maybe she was lazy, maybe she just didn't like you - maybe it had nothing to do with her being a woman. But definitely, go ahead, judge an entire gender from one example. This is truly enlightened thinking - good job!|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I'm trying to figure out how you managed to lug all of those big packages there by yourself...<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, it's women like her who give the rest of us a bad name. If she couldn't "deal with it," then she should be fired so the job can go to someone who CAN deal with it.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	She doesn't deserve any pay at all, not at that job, anyway. If I were her supervisor, I'd fire her.<br>  <br>  You do NOT refuse to help a customer in that manner, that's grounds for dismissal, in my book.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I think people should be able to do the job they hired into. If they can't, they should not be able to keep said job.|`|AA10895669	I've always maintained and will until someone gives me an intelligent argument against it. That your work ethic, not your race, your gender or any other discernible differentiation between you and the next person should determine your pay scale.<br>  <br>  An employer employs people so as to profit from the work that employee does. If the employee performs well and the employer wants to reward the employee awesome! The same hold true if the inverse is true. No one has a right to a job, and the only reason you have a job is because the company you work for uses you to make money.<br>  <br>  In your example, we are looking at a quasi governmental position, and we all know how that works. Or should I just say exists to provide employment for the other wise unemployable. Unions and government employees often spend more time and energy on find ways to not work (there are many other there that are true civil servants and go above and beyond for their customers, unfortunately this is not always the case). So I'm upset, not surprised and quite frankly humiliated that someone expects others to pull their weight based on some PC movement but that they should be paid based on nothing more then the guy or gal next to them is making the same money.|`|G1kdupY3aa	Ya, sure.  There are various types of mail and its possible that you "forgot" to tell us that the parcels you wanted to send one way needed to be sent another.  For example: "Packages: Length + girth cannot exceed 108 inches (Parcel Post cannot exceed 130 inches) .... maximum weight is 4 lbs..." bla bla bla.  Each "mode" has its own specific requirements and postal clerks are obligated to follow the rules.<br>  <br>  All the policies and procedures manuals are available for your viewing pleasure on the American Postal Worker's Union (AFL-CIO) website.<br>  <br>  Get over yourself.<br>  **************************************...<br>  When you check your luggage on an airplane YOU put it on the scale and its weighed, then it goes onto a conveyer belt.  The person behind the counter does NOT do it for you.  What's the difference?<br>  **************************************...<br>  Postal clerks and distribution clerks are expected to be able to<br>  <br>  -- Perform arithmetical operations quickly and accurately <br>  -- See details <br>  -- Recognize errors in numbers/spelling in mail/postal charts/tables <br>  -- Memorize mail distribution systems <br>  -- Read and sort mail rapidly and accurately <br>  -- Work with others and deal effectively with customers <br>  -- Repeat tasks of short duration according to set procedures <br>  -- Perform a variety of duties which may change often <br>  <br>  "The maximum allowable weight of the package is 35 pounds"<br>  **************************************...<br>  This is all spelled out in the policies and procedures manual.  They need to be able to lift a certain unspecified amount of weight, but not really heavy packages.  <br>  <br>  "which include lifting packages of up to 70lbs"<br>  There is no way they are required to be able to lift that amount.  Its totally unrealistic and staff would be injuring themselves all the time.  There would be nobody left to do the job and the company.  The insurance carrier would never allow it, its unaffordable.<br>  <br>  I applied for a post office Christmas help job and let me tell you they make sure you can comfortably lift the maximum amount of weight you're expected to be able to carry.  They actually test you.  If you can't do it, you don't get the job.<br>  <br>  Yes, postal employees doing the same job should be paid the same.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	You're making the assumption that the job requires the employees to be able to lift that weight. Perhaps she can't or the bigger men prefer to do it for her.<br>  <br>  You can hardly base a person's salary on one action. What if she's also the only one that can work late, or that she has management experience and helps with pay roll or scheduling, maybe she knows more about the products and services.<br>  <br>  The problem here is that you're basing pay equity on one factor, a factor that tends to favour men, which is exactly the problem. Some women can't lift as much as men because that's the way their bodies are made, but then again, men who can lift are a dime a dozen so why should that increase their pay? <br>  <br>  You're choosing to ignore several variables to promote this sexist question.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Techincally any worker who feels they are unable to lift a weight should not. Some women *must* not becayuse then they are not covered by policy and should they suffer back injury, don't get any sick pay (the weights in stated company policies are lower for women than men). <br>  <br>  This is without all the other possible factors - she may have a previous back injury or just had sugery (hysterectomy) which means you must not be involved in many kinds of lifting, which you don't bother to consider.<br>  <br>  It's not always the weight but which bit of your spine takes the strain. (This was a long health and safety talk I had). Not to mention, a policiy along the lines you mention would discriminate against anyone of any gender less than able bodied (in the ways I just mentioned - injury, surgery - also physical problems).<br>  <br>  So, yes she gets equal pay. So as long as she is within policy and proceedure then she's fine (i.e. if it's about five pounds and she's just being awkward, you could complain and she could have disciplinary proceedure started) . The men may also choose to follow this policy, if they choose not to fine for them... but the company is not required to reward them or even cover them. People of both genders take a lot of risks with back injury (hence my very long recent health and safety talk). No employee is *ever* expected or threatened with docked pay unless to do a physical task they fear may cause them injury and it would be a bad society that attempted to enforce such a rule.|`|oTwymgpIaa	Well, that particular woman should be fired. Women are very capable of lifting 20 to 50 lbs on a continuous basis, she is obviously lazy. I only weighed 115 lbs and I did it for 12 hours a day 6 days a week for quite some time when I worked as a general laborer in a factory, and believe me when I tell you I worked harder than most of the men who pushed buttons all day. If you are implying women shouldn't receive the same pay because they may not be able to lift heavier packages and ask for assistance occassionally, I'd say no, lifts or hoists should be required to assist them with heavier items. Manual labor doesn't pay very well to begin with, and even women need to support themselves and their families, or did you forget that? Actually, not even men should be expected to bend in the manner you are suggesting, because you said the packages were on the floor, 20 or 30 of them, it wouldn't take long for anyone to injure their back bending like that, they should create an area that is level with the person to hold the packages. Maybe her back is bad, IDK. Don't be sexist, please. ;-)

Classify your self in a group, smart, preppy, jocks, etc. If you're a girl, spend hours making yor self look good, show off clothes, and buy a lot of things. If you are a boy, skateboard, or play foot ball and listen to your iPOD, and get in troble at school.|`|Dv1UMYqUaa	Most of them are vexatious|`|DGPUdOOjaa	This is the age of constant change--unpredictable. A difficult age--sometimes older acting and sometimes childish. But that's o.k.-your friends are the same too.
iUzSlmSbaa	No, not after what you have been trough.. watch her body language.. does she look worried as if she wants to talk about it to someone when she says that, or does she look more as if she wants to hold others in ''suspense'' .. I am sure if she is a victim of a horrible trauma you will be able to see her looking worried and as if she wants to get something off her chest..uneasy.. but if she ''brags'' about having a secret.. or smiles and her body language does not reflect fear or unease.. then I am sure her big secret is something she just feels somehow.. ''I know something I want to keep you in suspense'' body language tells a lot.. her eyes, her gestures, does she look desperate or happy.. I would ask her.. but if I was a victim of sexual abuse I would most likely think the same.. but then again I would not see sexual abuse as a big secret.. I would then say.. I have gone through a horrible experience but I can't talk about it.. a secret sounds more like something someone enjoys.. unless this is a child.. and she was molested by an adult who then told her '' this is a secret, don't tell anyone'' that would be horrible.. it depends on this persons age. As you already know she is a rape victim, and she knows you are one, you should just tell her that if this whole thing has got anything to do with her traumatic experience she should talk about it.. to a councellor.. not keep this bottled up.. it will fester and you know what I told you about this 17 year old who suppressed it for a long time and told nobody.. who tried 11 times unsuccessfully to take her life.. and at age 39 she finally did take her life because by then she had kept it too long to herself even if her husband knew the story.. so one has to talk about it, to a councellor and the councellor is used to all kinds of traumas.. that includes sexual abuse.. the victim should never feel ashamed.. the victim did nothing to have deserved to be raped.. the victim is innocent and the victim can only get over this if they talk to a therapist or go into group therapy.. with other females who were victims of rape or abuse of a sexual nature.. maybe your friend would be more comfortable to go to a rape councelling group.. then there will be others, easier perhaps to talk if one knows everybody experienced something similar and the councellor is just as qualified.. and one is not the only one telling ones story. One hears the story of other victims.. which might make councelling in a group easier... I would suggest it to her, in case she has not talked about this to a professional yet..<br>  <br>  you know about her trauma, so she has no reason to keep anything about it secret from you.. you should encourage her to tell a rape councellor.. She doesn't have to tellthe whole world about this.. She may have to tell her partner.. her BF or anyone she meets and starts a friendship with which could lead to more.. if she feels awkward with certain things, he will be a lot more understanding if he knows she was a victim of rape.. and she should open up to the councellor about this.. because it will help her to finally move on and be able to lead a normal life. and not end up like Sylvie..haunted for 22 years until she took that leap from the bridge into icy water because the ghosts of the past never left her as she kept it to herself for too many years.. she was not able to cope and to ever find closure or to move on...xx<br>  <br>  P.S. As she is hinting to you that she has a big secret she obviously wants you to ask her questions.. I would watch her body language and facial expression when you mention ''the big secret'' and otherwise I guess I would do with her the same as I would do if she was a child.. say ''Is this something that scares you or is it a happy secret''? then again watch her facial expression.. and if she says'' it's a good secret, it probably has nothing to do with the rape.. but if her facial expression makes her look scared and she says nothing or nodds that it is a scary secret, I would assume it has to do with the rape and definitely suggest rape councelling to her as you are going through the same you should be able to be open about this toward each other.. two victims.. let them turn into two survivors..|`|6CAsx3jaaa	it could be that she is pregnant. i dont think this is  a time to play guessing games though . when she is ready she will tell you. you just need to be a safe place for her to go . i was abused myself and my and secrecy happened because of indoctrination  and lack of belief that i would get positve results from speaking out.|`|nYJEWLAlaa	no it isnt weird but u should urge your friend to seek counselling and you should too.<br>  the memory may not go away, but there are ways to get over it. all you need is a little support.|`|ogeRU7KEaa	It's not weird because when someone says they have a secret no-one knew you automatically think of your secret no-one knew. :)|`|GJwPDrDxaa	yes|`|Rhn3Q9Yuaa	Do you mean she told you she was abused after telling you she had a secret?|`|zXl2tW5Qaa	if uve both been sexually abused then of course you'll know what her secret will be.

ZF8zu2ehaa	To hear or write songs in your dream, indicates that you are looking at things from a spiritual viewpoint. Your future path is a happy one with good health and much wealth.

x3WBbLjsaa	I agree with the previous post. Just reassure him that there is nothing he could have done. Even if he had tried to help him, no one guarantees that he wouldn't have done it anyways. Besides, if he didn't show any clues of what he wanted to do, there is pretty much nothing anyone else could have done. <br>  And like the previous post, he was probably thinking about it for a long time and was generally sad about his life. It doesn't justify what he did, but it's the only way out he saw. <br>  <br>  Just make sure he knows you're there for him if he wants to talk about it. Also, I don't know the changes of this happening with your bf, but sometimes people are so affected by someone close to them committing suicide that they might think about suicide themselves. I don't know how close he was to his friend or how affected he is by all this, but make sure your bf is safe :)|`|UwiGwDGdaa	I agree with the first answer - be there for him, you don't need to say anything. It's going to take him awhile to realize he can't blame himself - just lend an ear to him, be ready to let him talk at any time, and don't hesitate to share his emotions - cry with him, be sad with him. <br>  Just listen when he needs it.|`|AA10506024	at this point and time.. you just need to  be quiet but close by... let him do all the talking.. he needs to vent???<br>  <br>  In most suicides it is up to the Individuel if they want help or if they are mental ill.. there are so many factors in this<br>  <br>  Just  let him know  it was  not  and is not is fault and leave it at that..  in  a Week or so ..he will  be more excepting of what you have to say<br>  <br>  God bless..|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Your boyfriend couldn't have done anything to help his friend.  People who commit suicide have had issues their whole life, and never really learned how to deal with issues.

I think the only thing you can really do is be there for your boy friend, and try to support him and reassure him there is nothing he could have done.  Peace be with you.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Don't tell him anything, just be there for him.
m89kGXBnaa	Well, yes, racism exists because people don't understand/accept other races... that's close to a truism. It doesn't explain *why* they don't.<br>  <br>  As for why - it's *because* we are human. There's a lot of work been done on the idea of in-group and out-group society - basically, racists are people who see race as the defining feature in deciding in-group people (people who are "good", who you support, who are like you) and out-group people, (...not...). It's fuelled by percieved conflict, differences and competition. So in a sense you are right, we have to make people see all humans are the same group, have the same rights to work in any country, same rights to expect fair treatment, etc.<br>  <br>  Neither is it necessarily cowardice. This is the same as the myth about bullies being cowards. It's not true. These people are wrong, by definition, but as prepared to defend their views at cost to themselves as someone objectively right or fairminded. Never underestimate them.<br>  <br>  It's not simple.|`|8ZmjIYORaa	I didn't read all of it, but I know what you are coming from.<br>  <br>  I know. This person in my school came up to me (Cos i'm Tanned, but I'm actually white) and she said <br>  "How does it feel to be black?"<br>  I said to her, in a very firm voice.<br>  "Firstly, if I WAS black, I'd feel the same as I feel now, because if you don't realize this, but If i was black, I'm no dog, I'm no fish, you can't eat me, and if you did, you'd probaby have two bodies in your own body, making you more of a two-faced person as you are. So be careful what you say, because one more thing you come out, I'm not those racist people. Be careful, and I'm gonna keep an eye out on you..."<br>  <br>  And I did. She's racist.<br>  I hate racist people. I mean, seriously. <br>  Me and my friends were talking about racism once, and my friend said <br>  "I have a black friend..."<br>  I said to her<br>  "So what?"<br>  She replied,<br>  "Well, there fine, there's nothing wrong with them,"<br>  I added suspiciously,<br>  "Are you saying before you had a black friend, there WAS something wrong with them? Get an x-ray of their, heart and yours, because we are all the same."<br>  <br>  People think that black people are vicious. C'mon, I am so against racism. I think that people are racist, because they either want attention, or cos they are gay freaks, who might as well... commit suicide if I may say. If they hate our world, they can go suck themselves.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|da09f4afeca7d01e34a308d11620050baa	I see where you are coming from. <br>  <br>  I think some racist thoughts on autopilot sometimes. I challenge them though. Like you said, we are all human. <br>  <br>  People from other countries appear to be different. And there is an element of fear that goes with that, for me anyway.<br>  <br>  Its easier to avoid the fear and thus end up with some racist tendencies than it is to face the fear.<br>  <br>   we are all from different backgrounds, rich, poor,  musical, educated.. etc etc, and /i think to only associate with the same people and live in fear of the others would be very stressfull and really boring and repetitive. like living in a box or something. Maybe we all  have something to learn from eachother?|`|mCbhjcLuaa	Like you are saying "some people" and this is not limited to any particular race.<br>  But the "some people" put a bad taste in everyone's mouth from time to time and this again is not limited to any particular race.<br>  I have had good friends of many races as well as religions and they are still good friends to me.<br>  I think it is the responsibility of every person of every race and or religion to accept their part and get on with the goal of world peace.<br>  You are AWESOME !!!!|`|cJPtKAU3aa	Well, racism is not just about the color of the skin.

We may be similar, but we aren't the same.  The reason we look different is because we are different.  I don't consider myself a racist, though I can't stand how some races live their life.  Most black people are looking for someone to blame and for a hand out.  Don't trip, my girlfriend is black.  I said "most."  Most Hispanics are 2faced.  I said "most."  I love and hate all people.

Z2WeMbWFaa	It is money which value does not represent any fixed amount of a commodity. Fiat money does only have a value because the government says it has a value, and that the law says it has to be accepted in its home country as payment. Fiat currencies includes the Dollar, the Euro, the Yen or most other modern day currencies. <br>  The opposite is a representative money, like the Dollar on the gold standard, where one dollar was worth a fixed amount of gold.<br>  Fiat money is the favored system nowadays because it gives central banks more tools to help the economy in hard economic times, like purposefully imposing inflation when facing the risk of deflation.<br>  On the other hand if a fiat currency is not managed properly, it can potentially go in to hyperinflation. Something that is not possible for a currency on the gold standard.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	A  fiat currency has no real value. It may be manipulated to increase or decrease its tracing value, but it is not denominated in anything that is real.<br>  <br>  A real currency might be denominated in kg of rice,  or steel, or gold, or kWh of electricity.

It has no real value.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	One based on a government authority, rather than some other commodity, like say gold.|`|IuDJ1Wpdaa	Fiat currency is money without any physical backing. It is far easier to manipulate for monetary policy. Fiat money has intrinsic value in the sense that the issuing government (lets say USA) promises to accept the currency as payment when it collects taxes.

zCHnMeXbaa	I take it you are referring to the cyclical boom bust cycle that occurs overtime.   I believe those cycles occur from inflationary factors centered on production.   Using our current economic situation as an example:  there was overproduction of home loans of all types due to market demand in a free (very minimal regulatory oversight).  This scenario is based on the economic principle of need versus wants.  The financial institutions wanted short term higher profits without consideration of long term needs.  I do not believe the volatility of money really factors in this cycle. The financial institutions were willing to lend the funding; the consumer was initially willing to repay that funding through loan payments.  The so called supply of money was obviously sufficient to meet consumer demand.  But, that supply of money, which when you think about, was partially created out wants not needs (in many cases the funding levels of financial institutions exceeded their funds on hand.  The money supply (availability of funds to service the economy) decreased due to the negative income flows and defaults of consumer payments expected to guarantee an unrealistic short term and long term profit margin.

My mother has somewhat been known to date younger guys and many of the guys at my school go after a girl in a lower grade. <br>  I think you rely just have to go for it. Get your head out of your pants and date around(I'm not talking the bachelor here!). See what types of girls you are attracted to physically and which ones intellectually. Just because a girl is attractive, doesn't mean that she is necessarily a conversation starter or has had much life experience, vice versa. Though it is hard to find, look for the sort of 'package'. Don't worry what others will think about them(unless they are totally out of it!). And don't just jump into a relationship... Get to know the person and they will likely build stronger feelings for you - and you them- , just don't wait too long, or it will turn into the strange "Im not dating my friend thing".<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work...

I think a girl should handle herself better and not put herself in such a situation unless she doesn't mind being taken advantage of, because lets be honest, your putting yourself out there like your just asking for it. If I were a guy I wouldn't do it, because some girls will cry rape even after they consented. People are so screwy these days you don't know what to expect or how to react. It is dangerous for a guy to have sex with a woman drunk or sober, the risk of being accused is always there, but it is more likely to be accused while drinking, because inhibitions are lowered, and a lot of women regret their choices the next day and cry rape, even though it isn't true because they consented. ;-)|`|mCAWxobNaa	I've had numerous occasion where I've been drunk and have had sex with girls that were drunk as well.

I think you're funny and just kooky enough to be my kinda person. But has it occurred to you that you intentionally piss --a lot-- of people off? From both camps? Maybe it's that you piss of everybody, and so you have all kinds of people reporting you. Ever thought about that?<br>  <br>  And Sean, don't go running your mouth about sh.it you're clueless about. My brother is gay, and my feminist mom fully supports him. She's a member of PFLAG. Most feminists are smart enough to know being gay isn't something you can help anyway, so why would they wonder where they went wrong? If you actually read most of the posts here from feminists on the subject of being gay you would know that. And feminists only support gay rights to look heroic? All the ones I know do it because they think its the right thing to do. Educate yourself.<br>  <br>  And I didn't say anything about "equalists," did I, Sean?<br>  <br>  <br>  Sean, you can believe, or not believe, whatever the hell you want to but you are the ignorant git spouting off like you have a clue when you are thoroughly clueless. You PRESUME to know what the ulterior motives of feminists are, and you PRESUME to know how each and every feminist will react if he/she found out they had a gay kid, and you PRESUME to know ANYTHING about me, and what I do or don't know, or anything about my family.  In every single case, though, you really don't know jackshit about shyt. HOW do you know me? How do know what I do or don't know? HOW do you know how every single feminist would react to a gay child? HOW do you know what the motives are for supporting gay rights? Oh, you don't. So STFU, dumbass.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	I drew attention to the existence of 'femunder' on GWS a long, long time ago.

I've totally dug your posts, and you always make me laugh!  <br>  <br>  You are completely misunderstanding something somewhere.  Those gift economy posts were three different posts, and an ongoing conversation.  Why is it so offensive that I said that it was organized?  There was some confusion, which as I said, was mostly my fault, but I posted the links requested last night, and thought it was cleared up?  Why am I being called nuts?  For talking about gift economy philosophy and practice?  And it's not a group!  But that's not the point of this post.<br>  <br>  I'm not surprised it got flagged off again, since every time I post anything informative, that's what happens.  I haven't even looked to catch up on those posts today. But why am I being dragged into this drama?|`|c21f50c4adf218f736042feaa879594faa	Lol it's funny how the male and female groups are against eachother when many men and women say they believe in equalism, feminists only seem weak when the men oppose them in such groups, reporting questions or even answers is the weakest way out, I wouldn't say men are organised, they are just stupid and oppose anything that may threaten them because they need to be dominant, and yes I am a male myself, I know how the mind works, but once you know how it works you can start to control yourself instead of letting it control you.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	What made you come to the conclusion that by being organized it meant some kind of vigilante warfare?<br>  <br>  Either A) You're reading WAY too much into that. <br>  or B) It went so far over my head it may as well been a 747.<br>  <br>  I never heard any of that. I will confess this though, when I first came here I did receive an e-mail from  someone who gave me a list of "woman hating misogynists" to watch out for.<br>  <br>  As it turns out the majority of those men on the list have been very respectful towards me, and I'd hardly call them "woman hating misogynists".|`|xCd7m5dkaa	It is a cowardly concept if it does happen on Yahoo q's and a's but some links would be helpful otherwise you will get alot of bashing from the feminists here.<br>  <br>  As for joy K, why are you assuming that vast majority of equalists here are anti-gay or indifferent to gay rights. Feminists didn't pass the gay rights, equalists did.<br>  <br>  And please stop with the hypocrisy, feminists support gay rights to make themselves look heroic but when there own son/daughter turns gay/lesbian then there in a world of depression and think where did they go wrong in raising there kids.<br>  Wow so your still ASSUMING that people around you are dumba**** and your the only smart one here.<br>  Try looking at the dark side of feminism. Every politician appears nice but most of them have hidden agendas and evil motives just like radical feminists. <br>  <br>  No you didn't say anything anything about equalists because you don't know what equalists are. <br>  <br>  Just because you come up with lies that your imaginery brother is gay and your mom a member of PFLAG doesnt mean people will believe whatever nonsense you spout on GWS forum.<br>  Have fun time supporting your movement of lies and bigotry.<br>  <br>  <br>  trevor You mean this source of underground gift economy.<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am3K0.pJI1TJ98qDlCTOuWsgGAx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090219202516AAMqVvC">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

W1xs3vYBaa	asbergers just means that you cannot tell peoples emotional Q's, they do not get interpreted right.<br>  <br>  No one with severe autism has a high IQ unless you are talking about savant syndrome, which is a special form (like aspergers) that gets lumped in there. <br>  <br>  Everyone on there had aspergers, at best. Autistic and having aspergers are very inappropriate to correlate. I have many, many friends with aspergers and the only difference is that you have to be honest and straight with them- they do not catch onto subtlety. I also have family with Autism and they cannot function. <br>  <br>  The reason that they are "brilliant" can be because they use a different part of their brain. Most people with higher IQ's can have some form of mental disorder, even if it's depression, but does the high IQ cause it or does the mental disorder cause the high IQ? That's the real question. Even if the mental disorder doesn't have a negative effect on the individual they may "suffer" from something because their minds work differently. <br>  <br>  I have no doubt that, as we map out the brain more and more, the way we perceive thought patterns will change and we will find people being diagnosed with some form of a mental disorder at a higher rate.  I just hope that the scientific population doesn't try and distort the mental process in order to make thought patterns conform to a standard, because it is only through varied thought that we have innovation.<br>  <br>  On a different note, most aspergered people have very obsessed personalities and they often focus all their attention on one or two things. They devote their time and energy to it. Perhaps the reason they are so smart is because they pay absolute attention to a couple things around them and devote their entire soul into it.|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	Autistic people are usually really smart mainly at one thing, like a kid in my class who is my friend and is great, is really good on history. Bill gates= technology(is he really autistic? haha)|`|0eAUeyU2aa	well that is a common mistake, when people see some geniuses were autistic, they just think all autists are like IQ 150 and more. The thing here is, autists' brain is usually very good in some areas but totally useless for others. They have big trouble understanding anything but literal meaning in sentences, cannot have feelingsand stuff. Also, the areas they are good at vary much and most of them aren't brilliant scientist or psychologists. Some develop intererst for trains, some for phone numbers, actors, actresses, films, musicians, awards, something totally useless... only a small amount of them are actually geniuses|`|Y5NtZBRJaa	Disorders on the autism spectrum pertain primarily to detriments in social functioning rather than intellectual functioning. Unfortunately, most of these are special or mild cases. Severe autism can greatly impair intellectual functioning.
f2cQrG7jaa	Your inclination to say that you are socially awkward IS your problem. The wanting to say "though I can't" is an avoidance to taking responsibility for yourself. Everyone uses this same excuse, even me. There is nothing to gain, because you already have all the tools you need.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	i can totally relate - i had the same problem.<br>  <br>  if you experience extreme anxiety and/or panic attacks in social situations, you likely have social anxiety disorder.<br>  <br>  if you do, the great news is that there is a new class of medications now being used to treat it - in which are being found to be *extremely* effective...seeing your doctor about it would be your best bet.<br>  <br>  good luck. :)

8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Julia, I looked back over your questions and see that you have posted many under TTC, something that I suspected even before looking over there :)<br>  I'm sure if you're TTC, you are likely paying much more attention to changes in your body than you might otherwise.  You know that you're supposed to ovulate this week, I would go along with that imagery, sounds good to me :)<br>  I often dream of my period before I menstruate, so it doesn't seem like anything unusual to me if you dream that you're ovulating....<br>  Good luck...

cNStB5ZQaa	why is pleasure, even pain, better than numbness?  why accept every "teaching" as fact?  test the theory!  get away from the classrooms, books and especially the newspapers and try out "living"!  one cannot (should not) adopt such a bleak mindset based on someone else's egotistical, etc. philosophies.  teachings and theories change all the time!  remember the "flat-earth" dogma?  do your own research, for god's sake!  who says the alternatives are doomed to failure?  even if what you say is true most of the time, the times that it's not make it worth the effort.  simple: nothing is always the same, all of the time. too many variables. of course it depends on what you think "success" is.  i feel that success is living through and finding a way out of that dark pit that i think you're in.  i've been there and it sucks!  but the light at the end of the tunnel isn't always the train that's going to mow you down. usually, but not always. ;)  i don't mean to sound like a pollyanna and i'm not big on psychotropics,  but maybe a mild mood elevator might get your curiosity piqued enough to at least try the "alternatives" again.  you might be surprised.  if not, then there's always the dreamless sleep.  you seem intelligent and articulate but is it smart to make such an irrevocable choice without fully exploring all sides of it?  what if you're wrong???  anyway, who appointed "sociobiologists" as the ones with the right answers?  have you posed your question to any terminally ill people?  they have a certain insight.........  good luck, i hope you find the answers you're looking for.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Sociobiology teaches no such thing. <br>  Individuals giving instruction in that discipline teach that.<br>  When one defines success in those terms, the outcome is highly predictable. <br>  <br>  Observation of what people imagine to be success would reinforce that definition. However, redefining success is the essence of your quandary.|`|AA11589437	My friend, you agree with Camus and Shakespeare that the fundamental issue we have to ask ourselves is : "To be or not to be?". That is indeed the question.<br>  Why is to be better than not to be?<br>  For me, the answer is only this: the greatness of past cultures, the monuments left (either architectural and artistic or scientific, like great discoveries, mathematics, etc.) shows that the human presence has had some creative and positive influence. If I can contribute in any way to the preservation of this heritage, and of nature, then my life has a meaning. This is why I work for the conservation of cultural and natural heritage. And anyway, if I can make a difference for the better, then my life has a meaning. <br>  <br>  Plus, I had such an excellent chocolate mousse today, that I guarantee to you, living was preferable to a dreamless sleep at that specific moment. - And by that I am making a reference to Epicurus, for whom enjoyment, physical or spiritual, was that gave a meaning to life.
EaurpLufaa	Perhaps they are afraid deep down of strong, independent women.  These women represent competition.  Some men are not used to the idea of female competition.  This frightens them and consequently causes them to deny, marginalize, and mock women's issues at large.  They are called "misogynists."|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Possibly because they are bored, frustrated, or bearing a grudge.<br>  <br>  Both Genders have issues...and maybe its easier to see your own, instead of someone else's...but I try never to make the generalization that "all men are evil"...or "men have it great".
8yE2sYGeaa	You are confused about how yur love life should be going
43f9Ctozaa	I feel you. Sometimes your closest friends and family are too close and you need some distance on some of your sorrows and struggles.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	:) I think that's why we're on Y/A Nightwolf.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	I think we sometimes resist "pouring out our sorrows and struggles" to loved ones and people we know because we fear they will judge us. Sometimes a stranger seems more understanding and less judgmental than a friend or loved one. Sometimes it is easier to talk to someone who doesn't know us.
8uMXFWgyaa	maybe u have unrealistic expectations. nobody ever acts the way I want them too, just not gonna happen.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well the first step in changing a problem is admitting you have one.  If you don't feel like you could talk to a professional, then talk to someone in your family, or someone from your church.  It would be best if you really want to change, to seek some professional help.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	They are jealous. I am not being sarcastic. I believe that all conflict arises out of jealousy. "If you are acting this way, then you must have something I don't". Unfortunately you are jealous too.|`|9LqHgmcLaa	ADMITING IT IS THE FIRST STEP, ASK PEOPLLE TO CALL IT TO YOUR ATTENTION, AND HELP YOU CHANGE .

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	To me, it is appropriate and beneficial to project a persona of confidence, but not arrogance.<br>  <br>  There is a fine line between these two projections.  Be careful not to cross that line.
mTwn8p79aa	You said it yourself, you're obsessed with the possibility.  You're making a huge deal out of nothing.<br>  <br>  Seriously, everyone has nightmares.  Could the chase dreams just be a fear of something else?  It just means you're running from something and you're afraid of what will happen when it catches you.  This could be a thousand things, probably the very least likely of which is memories locked deep in your mind.  <br>  <br>  Most people are right about "false memories" when we're talking about repressed memories.  In a normal person's mind, molestation would be an all too vivid memory.  Maybe you would never talk about it and try not to think about it but you'd still know it happened.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine anything worse than rape and I'm very sorry you've had to experience that.  But, I think this is even more proof that you weren't molested.  In fact, it sure makes those dreams make a little more sense, doesn't it?  Don't look for the needle in the haystack here, it's the hay that you're looking for.<br>  <br>  I think you need counseling as the hurtful memory of your rape is being transposed onto family members.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Whether or not you are a victim (which it sounds like you are), you can't behave like a victim if getting better is what you want. If getting revenge is what you want, then being a victim is very useful. Maybe revenge is what you need, maybe not. I think revenge is good in some cases. Playing the victim role isn't necessary, and if being strong is what you want then it is actually counterproductive. Taking responsibility for everything whether or not you chose for it to happen is the only remedy for any conflict. Seeking help might be called taking responsibility, but I think that talking to anyone (I don't like therapists) is what opens it up changing your perspective by reflecting it off of someone else.|`|iyRczu0eaa	Well typically..these kinds of suspicions turn out to b true.

ToILKl6waa	Their arrogant nature will get them nowhere nowadays and they'll learn their lesson somewhere along the road. As for you, be mature and limit your communication with them. Stay as far away as possible but defend yourself if you have to. Hating them does not make them suffer. It will only make you suffer. Take control of your feelings and do not let them get to you.

If you think that it may a little more serious such as depression, talk to your parents, I am sure they will be glad to set you up with a counselor or therapist who you can just talk to and help you figure out what the problem is and how to fix it, even if it is not stress or depression.

Go and make her a cup of tea. Give her the benefit of the doubt. She can go on holiday on her own if she wants and she doesn't have to feel guilty for wanting to do that.

Chances are she had something bad happen or she feels bad about something happening and does not know how to deal with it.

She's a year younger than me. I'd find it a huge struggle to raise a teenager on my own. You've got to remember she's got a life she wants to lead and a ton of worries she probably never tells you about, sounds like it if she's that stressed out. <br>  <br>  She cares about you. You might not see it that way but it reads like she's trying. <br>  <br>  I'm not having a go at you but don't want to give you a "yeah she is a b****" answer and just add to the drama of it all. Clearly you'd like a happier relationship with your mum. <br>  <br>  Sometimes in these situations you need to swallow your pride and own up to your side of the situation. Tell you realise she's finding things tough dealing with you (trust me she knows you know this!) and that you love her - I never told my dad this sincerely until I was in my 30s and it made a huge difference. I told him that he'd given me the greatest gift a person can give to another - life - and was moved almost to tears and opened up afterwards. If there's any stuff you want to own up to it'll make it far easier for her to back down from her position. <br>  <br>  Otherwise you'll both carry on being right and the situation won't improve. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LsRHE4Ttaa	ok i wouldn't ask her this but if your parents are devorced the maybe she's pregnant you sadi she never acted like this right then she is pregnant and having mood swings|`|vU4eUU5paa	I have probs like that too except i have both my parents but they constantly yell at each other my mother is so much like me that we yell at each other constantly.<br>  <br>  I get angry at her a lot and idk wat to do.

She has a choice to resort to being angry at you or anyone or to not be angry and handle things another way.  The Bible says "a gentle answer turns away wrath."  If you get defensive or aggressive back to her, the argument will escalate.  Just back off and act respectful.  Someone told me, "Just because someone throws a stone at you doesn't mean you have to catch it - just let it fall and not take it personally.  Give her space.  She's has some issues she needs to resolve (like feeling like a victim) and you are the first person she sees to take it out on.

One's own problems bear quite heavy significance... to one's self and the other people they affect.  The thing about one's own problems are that they usually involve less people and require much less effort to solve than, say, a world crisis, where many people would have to become like-minded and work together in order to solve the problem (or in some cases, do all that can be done to clean up the aftermath).<br>  <br>  It is good if one takes one's self seriously; this demonstrates confidence and self-worth.  It is bad if one takes one's self TOO seriously... this demonstrates ego gigantism and a poor sense of humor.  One must always be mindful that we are not perfect and be willing to laugh at ourselves for the mistakes we make and both the odd and the genuinely funny things we say and do.  We must also be sure to forgive ourselves for the mistakes we make.<br>  <br>  Until more people start becoming like-minded in their desire for a better way of life, there is little that can be done about the world's problems.  In order to actively do something about this, you must start trying to show other people the problems you see with the world and get them on board with your cause of fixing it.<br>  <br>  To answer your question directly... if I couldn't think...  even if it was about things like this...

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	What you perceive as strong stereotypes and rash judgments are, to me, scientific and formal evaluations of the human psyche.<br>  <br>  Psychologists and sociologists must sometimes formally label a mental dysfunction in order to properly treat it.  But, those labels are scientifically based, rather than broad stereotypes.
iUzSlmSbaa	It could be a trust issue or not feeling safe if nobody else is around...if they are strangers or friends you feel more comfort in numbers.. I believe you feel safer that way as it doesn't matter with your family members.. I am the absolute opposite. I feel awkward when I am supposed to talk to one person and others are present. I can't relax then and be myself with that one person. I feel self concious .. I know the others are listening to what is meant to be heard by only one person.. I feel then as if I am on a Reality TV show with cameras everywhere and my life exposed to the whole world.. or rather to those who are so bored to be bothered to want to know what I got to say.. LOL.. which are probably not many but that makes me uncomfortable.. I am sure in both our cases it's something to do with self esteem. In my case defininitely.. I feel a lot more at ease if I am with one person and want to talk to that one person.. than if I am with a lot of others who are just really there in the same room.. with you it may be ''safety in numbers where strangers are concerend.. and not being comfortable to sleep over in your friends home when nobody else of the family is there. .. as she is a female I am sure you are not afraid of unwanted attention from her to you.. I rather believe you have a fear or being alone in the house with just your friend.. you want to know in case of an emergency.. someone else is there. <br>  <br>  You should start out with small steps.. talk to people one on one when others are in sight...then you will feel more comfortable..to just be with one person in the room.. but perhaps have someone else just within calling distance.. In my case to be more comfortable in small groups or to talk to one person... and not have others present.. is deep rooted in my character.. I am an introvert.. It all depends what the discussion is about.. if it's something general then I don't mind others to be present but if this is private I would like to be one on one with the other person otherwise I feel awkward...try babysteps.. sleep over at your friend's home when someone else of her family is there...talk one on one with someone when you know others are in the house.. I am sure you can get over this.. I don't believe this has anything to do with your clinical depression.. unless you can remember you used to be different before this was diagnosed.. in my case I prefer to be alone with one person because I feel more at ease to just talk to one person instead of having others around...but I would manage to do it of course, just feel more awkward and less at ease.<br>  With a close friend, you can discuss this.. talk to your friend about this.. then she will understand about the sleepovers...xx|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Try to "Imagine" how THEY feel... -& take your "cues" from Them...

[:|`|fmr98EBtaa	I would look into systematic desensitization. Basically, you start with smaller things related to the fear or anxiety and then expose yourself to them until the point where you are no longer afraid of them, and then you work your way until you confront the situation that brings you the most anxiety. So, if you were scared of spiders, you might start with thinking about spiders, then being shown a picture of a spider, then playing with a plastic spider, and then seeing a dead spider, and then seeing a live spider in a jar, and then let it come out of the jar, and finally pick up the spider. The idea is that once you are continually exposed to the stimulus and calm down, realizing it cannot hurt you, you will eventually overcome the fear of it. So, make a list of everything related to the situation and try to overcome this one step at a time. :)

A small number of middlemen between a lot of sellers and a lot of buyers can scam both and claim it's THE MARKET.<br>  .|`|gzBelJM4aa	I would imagine the answer is a and the reason i imagine this is because of the market size for wheat.  Basically there are millions of producers of wheat and the impact of one producer leaving the market would be neglible.  Though if wheat is only supplied to local market, there would be a rise in price though in next year another producer would enter the market because of this and the price would be even lower.<br>  <br>  I think the answer to this question on a very basic level is a but if you analyse further then it could be b or d.|`|b36a3ea5053129e74f60939bd03c219faa	If the competition is perfect in the wheat market, this would increase the price by a very small amount due to the loss of supply in the market. Since there is not as much wheat as there was, the value of it will increase because of the fear of shortage in a world of scarcity,

HNAdM1hSaa	Oh goodness, are you talking about a sexual dominating role play or about actually physical pain?  I may understand why dominating a female may get you sexually aroused, buy why would it turn you on to see women being hurt? Of course it is of no concern to anyone if it is just a fantasy or if it is just role playing between you and a consenting female; however, that does not mean that feeling sexually aroused by watching another human being being hurt is sensible or normal! The only reason that would turn you on is if there is some underlying psychological issue and perhaps you should seek the advice of a Psychologist. =P<br>  <br>  JSM is Cool - lmao, well, according to Michael, it matters not right, after all, it's just a fantasy right?  =P|`|BMIW36XFaa	Do you rip the heads off of small animals, too?

I've always had fantasies of chopping the balls of men who rape and making them into ornaments.|`|FL67UPPHaa	This is actually really common. Have a look on literotica.com at some of the rape stories, the majority of which are written by women. <br>  <br>  I've always had violent fantasies too, always with some kind of pain or domination involved, but mine are from the masochistic side. (And no, I was never abused as a child!) Many people view BDSM as an orientation in itself, just like being straight or gay... it can be something you're born with, and it isn't just a phase.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to me is that you say you'd never hurt a woman against her will. That's essentially the difference between someone who needs help and someone who doesn't -- whether or not they can control their desires and empathise with others.<br>  <br>  Rape fantasies can be part of a healthy relationship -- there are many women interested in them too, and acting them out with someone you trust is perfectly fine. Both people get pleasure from it, and no one is being degraded or abused for real.<br>  <br>  You can't control your fantasies, only your actions. If you express your sexuality with other consenting adults, then you have no reason to be ashamed of your feelings and you don't require therapy.<br>  <br>  Unless of course, you *personally* feel it's having a negative effect on your life and happiness, or that it may be caused by past abuse. In which case, I would suggest talking it through with a counselor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mSaRuowKaa	Personally, I think that rape fantasies are very questionable. I think it's very unusual to be into that and I would question how and why it's the only thing that turns you on.

I consulted a friend and some more sources... And your violent rape fantasies are not abnormal. It has to do with the fact that in these fantasies you're controlling the women.

19f3d453105301c1e4c25cb7c7b96aceaa	Sometimes both, sometimes neither, but if you're asking in very general terms, ARMs are better for banks.<br>  <br>  You're asking a very complicated question, so I'll give the most basic answer first: If a home owner understands the loan (I'm betting most don't or didn't) and we're in a humongous financial mess which ARMs had a HAND in (lol). <br>  <br>  During the fixed-rate period, the loans are very affordable and if you wind up with equity in the property when the loan indexes, good for you (you've made a profit). But if you pay off the loan early, there might be closing costs, have to look for new property with a realtor (more fees), and other fees, etc.  So, you wind up with a loss, or no profit depending on your home's value.<br>  <br>  But right now home values are declining, and people are defaulting, and banks are taking huge losses, and there is panic in the banking system. So you tell me who's the real loser here.|`|AA10023809	Banks.<br>  <br>  Fixed rate means certainty. The buyer might be paying more than on ARM mortgage when interest rates go down, but they will be paying less if the interest rates go up. So fixed rate provides an insurance against increases in interest rates. <br>  It is a good thing because interest rates got a lot more room to go up than down; sufficiently high interest rates will mean that buyer cannot keep up with the payments and goes into foreclosure.<br>  <br>  Banks would prefer ARM, because most of their capital comes with variable interest rate, be it financial loans or deposits from their customers (that might have a fixed rate, but are a lot shorter than 30 years).<br>  <br>  So by setting the ARM rate to the interest rate that they pay plus a premium, banks can guarantee constant flow of profits for themselves.
NAGiNKFWaa	High School <br>  To dream about high school, refers to the bounds and friendships that you made while you were in high school. What spiritual lessons have you learned? The dream may also be telling you that you need to start preparing for the real world. <br>  <br>  Fire <br>  Depending on the context of your dream, to see fire in your dream can symbolize destruction, passion, desire, illumination, transformation, enlightenment, or anger. It may suggest that something old is passing and something new is entering into your life. Your thoughts and views are changing. In particular, if the fire is under control or contained in one area, then it is a metaphor of your own internal fire and inner transformation. It also represents your drive, motivation, and creative energy. Alternatively, the dream may be warning you of your dangerous or risky activities. You are literally "playing with fire". <br>  <br>  Apparently you have a passion for learning????|`|CsBUHVAiaa	Go to Dream Interpretation and ask again.|`|8uCjC3GYaa	For me, that would be an amazing dream.

Just take your time and don't invest more in the relationship than you can afford to loose.  Take your time; if you find yourself feeling that way with someone make sure it's someone worthy of your trust and explain how you feel.  You don't have an excuse for treating people badly but you have an explanation as to why you need to step back for awhile and work through your feelings.

kxleO480aa	This is sort of a broad question. Individualization is a relatively new phenomenon compared to the ancient practice of socialization. Individualization has its roots in the universalist notion at all people are equal in the sight of god, which arguably dates back to the second century CE. Socialization, or group dynamics, began with the first hunting packs. <br>  Two important terms to understand when dealing with the ways group dynamics affects individualization are organic and mechanical societies. Mechanical societies are typically small, agrarian communities in which each member if familiar with most other members and is considered part of the greater whole. Organic societies, on the other hand, have large populations in which the inhabitants are unfamiliar with one another.<br>  While there were highly populated city-states as far back as five thousand years ago, the concept of the individual didn't catch on until the propagation of Christianity. Previous to the Common Era, if you were to ask a person who he was, he would likely identify only with his function in society. "I am a soldier" or "I am a slave."  Christianity desired to disconnect human beings from statehood in order to devote their lives to the Church. The concept of universalism swept through the West for over a thousand years until State retreived the upperhand. In large part this transiction was brought about by the introduction of the printing press, which mass produced information and unified large regions under a common language, history and culture. Here's where universalism started to become "individualism." It was in the age that people stopped being "subjects" and started to become "citizens." It's true that there were citizens in Hellenistic society, but they were citizens of a larger body politics and virtually unrelated to the citizen of industrialized society.  As literacy began to spread, a strange relationship revealed itself to average men, a dialogue well-known to the ancient philosophers, namely, the conversation between the reader and the page. Think about how isolated humans are today when they watch the news at home in front of the television. This isolation brought about by mass publication advanced the individualism to its modern state. It's important to note that in the United State the freedom of the press was a cornerstone to the operation of a democratic society in order to secure individual liberty.|`|oZPLI8Y5aa	Look up the experiments of Solomon Asch  -  Social Pressure and Perception. <br>  <br>  This will give you your answer if you consider the ramifications of its meaning. <br>  <br>  Also look up "Group Think"

NYU37jfGaa	I think Bessie Smith, Coco Chanel and Virginia Wolfe are all very good choices.  All of them were major talents in their own fields, and Bessie Smith and Coco Chanel were both hugely important in popular culture.  Virginia Wolfe is not everyone's cup of tea as a writer (I'm more of an Agatha christie fan myself), but she was a highly regarded writer of her day.<br>  <br>  As I have said, I personally would rate Agatha Christie more highly as an important writer of the 20s, but she's not a feminist icon like Virgina Wolfe.<br>  <br>  Mary Pickford (mentioned in an answer above) is a good choice, if you wanted someone from the cinema, because she was not only a huge star, but one of the few women in Hollywood to actually be involved in the production side, as one of the joint owners of United Artists.<br>  <br>  Nancy Astor, the American-English politician, was another great personality of the 20s, in 1919 she became the first woman to take her seat as an MP in the House of commons in the UK, and she was the only woman MP until 1921.<br>  <br>  I don't think Amelia Earhart (mentioned above) would be a terribly good choice, as her glory days really belonged to the 30s rather than the 20s.  If you wanted to do a notable female flyers, Bessie Coleman would be a good choice.  She was the first African American woman to obtain a pilot's licence (though she had to go to Paris to get it, no american flying school would take her).<br>  <br>  Marie Curie is another one mentioned above who I don't think would be a very good choice for the 20s, as her most significant acheivements really took place earlier in the century.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	My personal favourites, Radcliffe Hall, Natalie Barney and Collette|`|brUt1Fupaa	Amelia Earhart<br>  Marie Curie<br>  Margaret Sanger<br>  <br>  + some from the entertainment industry:<br>  Mary Pickford<br>  Greta Garbo<br>  Lillian Gish

AA11346983	well if you're not naturally a bubbly/happy person, it might be difficult for you to change yourself to be that way..you should look for some new hobbies. i mean i don't know what you're into so i can't really give you suggestions, but i like playing guitar. when you achieve stuff from your hobbies, you feel really happy about it, like learning a new piece of music that you thought was really difficult. and then, when you find hobbies, you will have more topics of conversation, and you can talk to more people, or have better conversations with the people you already know. if you like watching movies, that's good, you could talk to people about your favourite actors, directors, new films etc. you could also get a pet, even something like a goldfish could cheer you up..as for being exciting, try doing things you haven't done before. i mean people have different ideas of what's exciting, but if you have lots to talk about then people will find you interesting and want to talk to you. oooh and listening to happy music is fun too :) but don't try to completely change yourself, if you don't think you're capable of being a really happy bubbly person, it's best to just be yourself. i don't think i'll ever be super confident, so i just accept it and think about other things i can change or build on. and make sure you're changing yourself because you want to, and not because other people want you to. hope i helped :D|`|Gn5L3odFaa	<a href="http://www.2knowmyself.com/getting_over_shyness" rel="nofollow">http://www.2knowmyself.com/getting_over_...</a>|`|f2cQrG7jaa	There's no process to it.

UeLN2MxTaa	Something new in your life that needs your protection and care...depending on how you felt about the baby in the dream is a reflection about how you feel about the change.|`|w94CVzIHaa	The baby is a symbol of responsibility; either you've got a new responsibility in your life that you are enthusiastic about or you really want one.<br>  <br>  Still another possibility is that perhaps (and, of course, I don't know you) you didn't have the best childhood and you are eager to have kids of your own so you can raise them better than you were yourself.|`|6GpN0NOIaa	i had a dream i was pregnant ant when i woke up i freaked out but it made me want on mabey some time during the week or that day u were thinking about babys and u glued it to your mind and ur mind used it as a dream cuz it rememberd that u put it there in your mind|`|Sk0CGPx7aa	It was probably a sign that cherishing a baby is the most important thing, and that your baby won't be that newborn baby for long. And you don't need another baby, because it will always be your little baby every day you look at it.|`|hhFp7jZSaa	A baby could mean your unrealised potential,or something your working on,Im not a dream expert though I think I remember reading that.Maybe it represents a sub-conscious wish for a baby,if you dont want one at the minut be careful!|`|4iA3oRqOaa	well then have baby! i mean if u want to do that u know they cry all day they make mess  it's allot of responsibility CONGRATULATION UR HAVING A BABY wait are u male or female i should stop talking|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	I have had SO many dreams like that. <br>  <br>  It means that you want a new beginning for yourself.|`|vqrArRIraa	You may just be crazy.|`|ag5RiDkFaa	maybe it means that you are wanting to have a baby|`|24r0kVmyaa	last night i had a dream about school. dreams mean nothing|`|HsiDiRB5aa	it could be a sign<br>  for the future :]|`|Amkmles0aa	you have a babby in your home some day|`|CdTe8MO4aa	Baby<br>  <br>  To see a baby in your dream, signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.  Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted. If you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential. If you dream that you forgot you had a baby, then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities; You do not want to let others know of your weaknesses.<br>  <br>  If you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby, then it signifies your issues of dependency and your desire to be completely care for. Perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility. If you are pregnant, then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes. <br>  <br>  To dream of a crying baby, indicates that a part of yourself that is deprived of attention and needs some nurturing. Alternatively, it represents your unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life. If you dream that a baby is neglected, then it suggests that you are not paying enough attention to yourself. You are not utilizing your full potential. Alternatively, this dream could represent your fears about your own children and your ability to protect and to provide for them. <br>  <br>  To dream about a starving baby, represents your dependence on others. You are experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and gratification.<br>  <br>  To dream of an extremely small baby, symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence. You may be afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands. <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com</a><br>  <br>  To see a dead baby in your dream, symbolizes the ending of something that is part of you.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are dipping a baby in and out of water, signifies regression. You are regressing to a time where you had no worries and responsibilities. Alternatively, it is reminisce of when the baby is in the fetus and in its comfort zone. In fact, some expectant mothers even give birth in a pool, because the environment in the water mimics the environment in the uterus. It is less traumatic for the baby as it emerges into the world. So perhaps, the dream your search for your own comfort zone.<br>  <br>  Baby Carriage<br>  <br>  To see a baby carriage in your dream, symbolizes your desire for a family or longing for a baby. If the baby carriage is empty, then it indicates sadness or an unfulfilled goal.  Alternatively, it suggests that you need to cater to the needs of your own inner child. <br>  <br>  Baby Clothes<br>  <br>  To see baby clothes in your dream, suggests that you are expressing yourself in a more subtle way. Alternatively, baby clothes represent your former ways of thinking. You may refer to old habits or former notions which you have outgrown.<br>  <br>  Baby Food<br>  <br>  To see or feed baby food in your dream, indicates that nurturance and care is needed in a waking situation. Alternatively, the dream may be a metaphor to indicate that you need to eat smaller portions of food.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	Ordinarily, I would say that you are likely to start a new project or phase in your life that isn't necessarily related to having a baby.  Dreams don't "make" you feel things, or "make" you change your feelings, but they can *reveal* feelings you didn't realize you had.  Perhaps your life has reached a point where you are ready for that, if you weren't before, and you're starting to think about it. It isn't a "sign" or anything like that, well, I wouldn't take it as a "sign" that your pregnant, any way, but it could be a "sign" that you're ready to think about it... Good luck...|`|CPxmHjx4aa	sorry but i was told that if you dream of a birth then theres gonna b a death in the family...<br>  the closer the relationship of the baby to you...the closer the relative is that youre gonna lose...<br>  this is what my grandmother told me..|`|zhk8o514aa	RRRRRRRRRINNNNNNNNNG<br>  <br>  Hear that?

Now you want one, so you know the answer to the question everyone wonders.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	It either means your having a baby or getting one, or it's just a dream that means nothing or you just want a baby and were thinking about it.|`|bzjLgfjcaa	maybe you are pregnant!<br>  answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgG20EHxYwlGdx3WAJ4_zWHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220133359AAUgtYx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7OZURudXaa	go have another baby.<br>  Or dont because maybe its a sign.|`|3lbw0Tx2aa	just a dream|`|avpv7u8saa	maybe it means you want a baby...|`|v4HbYrgYaa	aww
WVwjKYGZaa	Start writing them down, it helped me :]|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	I agree, right when you awake, have a pen and paper ready beside you so you can scribble down your dream.|`|w94CVzIHaa	I got immediate results with this one:  Before and as you are falling asleep, tell yourself that you will remember your dreams.  It's the power of suggestion - works almost every time for me.<br>  <br>  Here's a website about lucid dreaming (realizing you are dreaming during your dream), but part of it helps you improve your dream recall.
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	I have not read Darwin works but from what I hear is that he referred to the Caucasian races as beating the other ones.<br>  <br>  I think he probably misunderstood evolution and a different subject about the diverse cultures, economy situations, etc. By being comfortable in his own culture, economic situation, customs, etc...he probably concluded that everyone else was wrong. <br>  <br>  I should read Darwin but I always found the subject a bit boring. Specially when you got theories that claim that we were genetically engineered by aliens. Now that is fun to read lol.<br>  <br>  But who knows. We are still debating if we are one human race or different human races. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4pwyaVOIaa	I don't know about Darwin, but before they came up with the human genome mapping and genetic genealogy, they made a prediction that if all humans came out of Africa, then the black African DNA lineage groups would show the most diversity.  Then the prediction came true, all of the DNA lineage groups of black Africans have more genetic diversity than all of the other human races, showing support for them being the oldest race.  So if they're most diverse genetically, obviously their genetics shows mutations over time, which I guess is a type of evolution.  <br>  <br>  Also, the mutations that are shared by all black Africans are also found in the other human races, while the mutations in the other human races are not found with all black Africans.  So in other words, black Africans have the most genetic diversity, and the mutations that all black Africans have are also found in the other races.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	To quote Darwin "False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness."<br>  <br>  Would you provide your source? Where in his writings does he state that?<br>  <br>  There are a significant number or misquotes about Darwin, mostly by people selectively lifting words from his writings.<br>  <br>  In most of his writing, when he refers to "savages" he's clearly talking about as measured by British civilization, not race. Darwin was himself anti-slavery and disliked the Confederates States attempts to bring England into the Civil War.<br>  <br>  One reviewer wrote:<br>  "Evolutionary thinking enabled him to rescue the idea of human unity, taking it over from a religion that no longer provided it with adequate support, and put the idea of common descent on a rational foundation...Creationists of various stripes have seized the opportunity to include racism in their indictments of Darwin. From their point of view, it is one more wicked consequence of teaching that people are animals. Considering the comfort slave-owners in the American South drew from scripture, a selective biblical quotation comes to mind: the one about beholding the mote in thy brother's eye without perceiving the beam in thine own"<br>  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/did-charles-darwin-believe-in-racial-inequality-1519874.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entert...</a>|`|WTaMbopnaa	Most people ( regardless of race) are still evolving.... although there are those who are regressing ( those who live for violence and oppression) <br>  Charles Darwin was only one man...... providing one man's opinion. Doesn't mean he's right.|`|iAM3gctWaa	I′m not sure that Charles Darwin ever met more than individual black men which is hardly sufficient to propose a hypothesis.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It was standard in England at the time to consider whites to be superior. He likely thought that all humans were still evolving since he had great insight into evolution.|`|50zbKv0jaa	all humans are and he is dead
zHop6XNIaa	I think about how wonderful life really is.  I listen to music when I'm really down and I hangout with my friends.  When I'm alone, I just let things flow by crying it all out.  It really helps because I feel a lot better now. :)|`|Gn5L3odFaa	Well I know I shouldn't but when people get me angry or when something gets me angry I talk crap and I complain about it until I feel better. Like today we had a sub in my 5th hour science class. MEANEST WOMAN EVER! So we had to watch a movie and take notes so I had no paper so I seen a piece on a desk, no one was using it so I grabbed it. The [insert curse word here] teacher comes up yelling at me in her foreign voice and she's all like "did you hear me!" and I was like "This is for when we have to take notes." very nicely then she tears the paper off of our desk and was all "no." so yeah that Pi^^*d me off so I yell "Geez lady!" All hour complained to my friend about it, because the whole class was talking and throwing things and being stupid so I figured Hey can't hear the movie well go with the flow. She expected us to take notes after the movie and I am thinking HOW!!!!! We won't remember all of that. So I was saying some extremely mean things about her and that is not me. Well yea it is, when people get me mad I just can't help myself. It never gets me into trouble though because I am careful but I shouldn't do it. I just can't help it, when people get me mad I talk about it until it feels better.|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Read my favorite book, watch Friends (I have the entire show on DVD) and eat chocolate.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I turn on my ipod and listen to my favorite music and if that doesn't work I take a long hot bath and read or re-read my favorite books.If things are really bad I talk to someone that I trust and let out what ever upsetting me.|`|BcxdFV0maa	think of good things about yourself.<br>  talk to people who can lift your spirits and/or have a good sense of humor.<br>  listen to good music.<br>  spend time with loved ones.<br>  get out and do something productive.|`|PbykKE2oaa	listen to my favorite band..they always cheer me up. <br>  or buy myself ice cream..<br>  <br>  these two things make me feel better =]|`|Dcf6PZ7aaa	Take a nice long nap. =)
3rq39Pgmaa	To understand the difference you just have to understand what they mean. Cohort would be your friends or the group that you hang with. So a cohort would be the the effects to a person by the group they hang out with, as opposed the the effects of age. So lets say someone is doing a study of  social interaction among high school students. If you were looking at age effects you would examine aspects that have to do with age- maturity level etc. Where as the cohort would examine how a different social groups influence one's social interaction.|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	The term cohort effect is used to describe variations in the characteristics of an area of study (such as the incidence of a characteristic or the age at onset) over time among individuals who are defined by some shared temporal experience or common life experience, such as year of birth, or year of exposure to radiation. For example you can run a cohort study to see the effects of people who ingest a certain drug over a year (time of measurement).<br>  <br>  Age effect refers to whether your susceptibility of a certain condition or disease either increases or decreases as a person ages.  For example, the chance of a female having a child greatly decreases after age 35, as there's a substantial increase in chromosomal abnormalities in her gametes (or eggs).
L3VbnH1faa	obsession is unhealthy obviously but it always passes after a month or two...i knew i was obsessed when i saw a picture of edward cullen in the cafeteria (trying to get people to give blood at the blood drive. LOL!) and i got dizzy and almost fainted. (I know i'm a retard) but hey it's just a book. if people become obsessed with it it's their own fault. i take full responsibility for it even though my CATHOLIC SCHOOL recomended the book. it's not really the schools' problem...it's not their fault if people like me can't control their insane obsession over twilight and edward cullen (sigh...edward <3) lol...|`|AA10023809	Same arguments as were used again Harry Potter books:<br>   - Scary & violent content<br>   - Disrespecting authority of teachers and parents<br>   - Acceptance of liberal values and lifestyles.|`|chfILbonaa	I think yes it should be read in schools most kids at my school dont even read and the only book tehy ever read is twilight becasue it is cool and they think it will make them fit in more yes their is violence/romance but gosh its just a book|`|mPfknxJSaa	Yes i have! when we were on the bus this girl said edward wasn't real, and this other girl got all mad and stole her stuff.

WTaMbopnaa	One thing that separates us from the animals is that humans have a greater sense of reasoning, and self control (although they don't always exercise it) . The chimp that went berserk, was being treated like a mate by the woman who owned him. He probably saw her friend as a threat, if the owner served her in any way ( brought her a cup of tea or something) <br>  <br>  Chimps in the wild are very violent toward intruders to their group. The house was the chimp's territory.|`|IxLkAEA3aa	they have thumbs|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	You can gauge the possible antiquity of common behaviors.  Since chimps engage in warfare, you could assume that it is likely that human ancestors behave in similar ways.  The politics of of chimp social life is very complex.  Where they are similar to humans, it likely means that it isn't something we started doing recently.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Nothing.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	This just happened the other day... hers your answer.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/02/17/2009-02-17_911_tape_captures_chimpanzee_owners_horr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/02/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  in conclusion: Chimps, humans, were all f*cked up|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Humans will die and chimp will survive!<br>  <br>  I saw it in a movie!|`|9mVjm7K1aa	Someone observes chimpanzees?  Wonder if they have chimps that observe humans?  hmmmm|`|oNg8zGi8aa	That they are observing us and learning our weakness . So they can take over .
ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream of a kiss, denotes love, affection, tranquility, harmony, and contentment<br>  <br>  To smell something in your dream, indicates your past experiences and feelings with that particular smell. Your dream is trying to convey a feeling by associating it with a familiar smell or scent. Alternatively, the scent may be part of your real environment which you have incorporated into your dream. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are touching someone or something, indicates that you are trying to communicate your feelings and your need for contact. You may also be trying to evaluate a situation or gather information about our surroundings. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|0a6cbab3e9df10aad3a3ec370744a574aa	i have had dreams where i feel as if i'm proper physically involved. i personally think from what i know is that things which are on your mind come into your dream or just little things which have happened in the day can appear somehow but when you have a dream where u really feel it like the one you did, your soul was probably in a stronger dreaming realm. when we dream we are in different states n realms and you must really want this girl :) good luck!|`|w94CVzIHaa	I had a dream like that once, but I had been shot.<br>  <br>  I think dreams that include senses other than sight really mean something to the person if they are not common for him or her.  In your case, I would guess that you really do like this girl - have you considered that you might be in love?<br>  <br>  You would probably be able to experience lucid dreams with ease.  Lucid dreaming is when you know you are dreaming while you're having the dream; if you get good at realizing it, you can even control everything that happens in your dream.<br>  <br>  I've given you a link to a really good website on lucid dreaming; I've had a couple since I read it through.  It's so fun!
