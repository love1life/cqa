Peach is also hot|`|UkiVKKaCaa	dont know maybe he's into blondes ^_^|`|FCcmGCy6aa	ever heard the song warp to world 6-9?|`|XMiRwRDDaa	he does it cause nintendo wants him to and without that there wouldn't be a story
804308acc0031baeff34f51b7127e617aa	I would try the main website. (Bethesda.com?)

gI3OHG6faa	Yes, Kingdom hearts and kingdom hearts chain on memories are both greatest hits, and are sold everywhere, i dont know where you live, but you can find them at target, or if you have a gamestop or EB games anwhere around. Kingdom hearts chain of memories is not sold in its package anymore, but if you go to one of the game stores mentioned above (eb games or game stop) they sell used games there, chain of memories is for the game boy advanced and the origonal game is no longer sold, but you can buy a used one from one of these stores.|`|bJd1CQglaa	yes! they are well at least the kingdom hearts 1 & 2 but im pretty sure all are still sold in the US|`|AA11925698	yup, just go to your local game store
nCZyWMn4aa	I'm pretty excited too. But, you have to know it'll be awhile. I don't have evidence but I would guess 6 months. Really big games usually come out in the early holiday season to maximize the gift giving sales.|`|T0fMXyyYaa	what the heck is that??|`|PamIaCgKaa	I doubt it will be released this year.      www.gamespot.com had a recent article
AA11422318	When turning corners, hold the R button for a tighter turn. Also, you can get a mini-turbo by holding R and wiggling the control stick left and right several times until you have blue flames coming out the back of your kart and then releasing R.|`|E25OekWZaa	I love that game, I haven't played it in years. My favorite person is bowser he's the bomb. Every 1 else sucks.|`|uHU7RW2waa	have you tried gamefaqs.com + my fravourite would have been toad|`|AA11287181	yeah the third answerer is right. and also if you want to be a bit more faster then everybody use toad. (i think ) and when 3 shells comes out press the item and if you want to hit one press the button and when there is a guy near you just get close to him and he's bye-bye.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	its mario Kart
8bba7f82c4899b3d9d1b69cdc5992184aa	i don't, but one of my friends is really good.    he beats the computer on all-madden by at least 20 pts. every time.|`|at2Ar4x6aa	oh yeah, now you're talkin buddy. ya know, it doesn't even matter what team you are. i think it's more important to know the playbook of the team you are, rather than the skills of the players on that team. i love the broncos, but every time i play, i use someone elses playbook. you can't beat a guy when he's universal with every playbook...i win!!!!
Lu5SHy7raa	sometimes but not always, you just have a permantent hold on it. so you can get it even if it is sold out in stores. its like the store reserves a copy for youu. somtimes you get a discount too.|`|87c0c9a65c3d2d127910feb421059969aa	You usually get the game the day it ships to stores if you preorder but sometimes it's a little slower.|`|qdUmafZ9aa	i think its a lot or abit cheaper (depending on the game) if you preorder cuz when its launched it will get more expensive and u can save your character if u r playing an online game demo.|`|Z7R86nqQaa	no u are just guranteed to get on the first release day|`|Z8Ngql2laa	No. You're just guaranteed to get a copy of the game
PFsMyASFaa	yes.Wii is coming out with an online network "sometime in 2007"
AA11612795	No, it is a DS game.|`|8gSliOq0aa	yeah no sorry the game boy advance is out dated you should consider getting the DS and then you could buy all the latest games and stuff. In the meantime you can look at www.gamespot.com for all the latest pokemon stuff.|`|0abca33adb12687632da5c0960075834aa	From what I hear and I have really looked into they will not make any more Pokemon games for any more Gameboy Advance any more. Only the DS. Sorry but we need to get the DS now.|`|Mq7yondSaa	you need a ds buddy its time to move on!|`|b7d0265625304036808c10e946aaaa8faa	no

LyZKM0tOaa	get a diglet from fire or leaf or just play for a while fossil maniace house in the soot area|`|14oasrJFaa	If you want any of those non battle things you can go to the pokedaycare and put a pokemon in and you have to let it go in for a while until you can get it|`|Iulcrme3aa	I think you can either buy or look for the TM that has it, or you can cath a wild pokemon that already has the move dig. Hope that helps!|`|AA12355375	simple. In the town next to the ashy rout on the far left there will be a house with a girl and a fossil maniac inside. Talk to the girl and she will give you the Dig TM.

Make sure you have your Wifi switch on, and be playing the same game as somebody else. (A game like GTA Liberty City Stories would work, for example.)

After it changes and the fighting type elite four can hit my haunter, I stopped playing pokemoncrater. I used to play 4 years ago and had 4 level 100 pokemon.
RnhAWXHzaa	no, theyre not. who keeps telling people this?? the SUPER secret characters are mr.game and watch and mewtwo. you can get g&w by completing adventure mode with all char. besides g&w. mewtwo can be obtained by playing for a total of 24 hours of versus game time-don't worry just leave your gamecube on infinite live versus mode and youll have them in no time. and no theyre not gonna be on brawl.|`|qoeLkah5aa	No:  Mr. Game and Watch  Pichu  Luigi  Dr. Mario  Gannondorf  Young Link  Mewtoo  Roy  Marth  Jigglypuff  I think they're is more but I can't think of them    And no Jimmy they wont|`|jL4JUeTgaa	Nope but that would be cool.

IWqtc7Oiaa	that all depends  on what type of game you want.  i just love mario party 8 that game is so addicting. also Super Paper Mario is a good twist on the paper mario games.. The best game for the Wii in my opinion is LOZTP like you have said but, other good games are Marvel: Ultimate Alliance and Prince of Persia..  The worst one yet is Wii Play..  i hope this helps you out a little|`|xONNVOtOaa	super paper mario is really cool! really cool game play with that 2d to 3d. rayman ravin rabbids is really cool too as far as minigame games go. its my favorite out of all of the games of a similar type. crazy rabbids!!!|`|AA10598858	I love playing Wario Ware: Smooth Moves. It looks kinda dumb from the advertisements and commercials, but trust me, it's a lot of fun. Maybe because I'm interacting with the game.

HpzffKHYaa	Hey ive got a ds and a psp they say that animal crossing is quite a good and simple game i played it for ps2 it was hard for me though it is also good the way that you can  share your stats wirelessly oh yh i added you as a contact|`|tO3pduIGaa	i use to play animal crossing on gamecube and im a fan of the sims. if he were my little brother id let him play them if he wants if he loves it itll keep him busy right? yes animal crossing never really ends it runs the real days of the week he can be playing that till hes like 20 and it wont end but i dont think he'll want to after a while ti gets really boring cause if u want certain things in the game u got to come on it every moment of the day. but yea if he likes them let him play them.|`|AA12041346	if he liked SIMS then i think he'd like animal crossing. Its a real easy game and i think he would be able to play. Other simple fun games would be like mario kart and yoshi's island or any mario game.

l9hbbsAxaa	Are you talking about Sims 2?    If so, University is the best. It adds the most features and actually changes the game by allowing you to send the teenagers to college and play them in college. It also adds another stage of life called "young adult".    Nightlife is pretty good. It ads zombies, vampires, and some other wierd characters/options. It also adds a downtown and a bunch of good places to take your Sims to. You can also take your sims on "dates" and buy them cars.     I didn't like Open For Business at all. The only good thing is that you can start a home business or purchase a lot and open one. What you can do with the business is pretty limited. You can either sell stuff (anything you can buy for your house, you can sell) or you can make a really fun house and charge people to come on. Other than that, it is a real waste of money. There are things that sound attractive like starting a "salon", but all that is is the ability to use the mirror feature on townies.     I don't have pets, so I can't judge it, but from what I've heard it is very good.      ...If you are talking about Sims 1, I haven't played in a REALLY long time, but I like Hot Date (it adds a downtown and gameplay features) and Unleashed (you can have lots of pets).     I also have Superstar, which is pretty fun because you can make your sims into actors and actresses or singers, and there is a lot of ladder-climbing and social interacting necessary to become one. Its a good expansion, but I could have lived without it.|`|AA10983802	sims or sims 2???|`|NfGqvWBSaa	I would say that in Sims one it would be hot date, and in Sims two Seasons.|`|n5c8t7SRaa	sims 2 holiday edition is pretty cool you can have chrismas on da game

AA10836007	sRole-play is when you change seat with another person.    For example, if you and your mother, have a problem, you role-play her as you sees her acting, and she role-play you as she see you.    This is done to see how others sees you.|`|iOfsbgZDaa	Roleplaying is the act of making an involved story for your character and following it...for example, if you have a thief roleplaying character, it would be out of character to blatantly attack someone, you would want to sneak etc.  Your characters backstory basically influences what happens to them today...so if your family was murdered by, let's say, orcs, then you might have a prejudice for orcs that would make you attack them on sight.

JvjRbbSQaa	Try to get her attention and explain to her in detail why you want it, what you intend to do with it, how it makes you feel, why it is important to you and explain to her the warranty.  Explain that its fun, you get to play with your friends and that its important to you, especially since its with your money.  Just try to get the point across that you really want the 360.  Hope you get it, good luck man.|`|sKLjWCiCaa	Tell her that she can lock it away in a triple security metal box with a overshield around it when you're not using it.|`|am0eTbvxaa	buy it anyway, sure she will get a little mad but tht would be ur chance to show her u r responsible.+buy a warranty just in case.|`|pFKOLUFWaa	Try also buying the warranty (which I believe is around 40 bucks at Best Buy) in the case that even if it does get damaged somehow from your brothers, you'll at least be able to get a replacement.|`|JYXhZ0fNaa	yeah get the best buy warrenty if it breaks just take it back to best buy and proof to them somethings wrong and they will let you walk out of best buy that same day with a new 360

yIHAVTnoaa	If your defending a castle(Helms deep, Isenguard, Minas tirith) then i suggest use elves with silver thrn arrows because they just kill anything! If you attacking a castle then either use dwarves or Uruk hai because both have seige units for knocking down gates and smashing walls, but when uruk hai have full equiment then they are a unstopable force! If you against someone on a map with no advantaged use goblins because they may not have walls but they have great units for destroying structures, and upgrade EVERYTHING!|`|2rShfvo3aa	The best faction in my opinion is Sauron's army because of the Attack Troll. Those dudes are mean and can take out an entire group of soldiers with one swipe of thier spiked club. They also take out buildings with ease. For online, you need to have Xbox Live Gold (assuming you are talking about the 360 version), then you just select "Xbox Live" on the main screen.

Once Eevee friendship is high enough, it will evovle the next time you level it up. If you want an Espeon you must level Eevee during the day.

c02d233b2fa253c3dfa66966175deb6aaa	Just in case, I dunno remember, find the whole walkthrough at the website reffered    +++   AREA: LOWLANDS ENTRANCE   +++      As you go up the path, you will see a path on the right with two   archers and a grip holder and the other path is a trap floor that locks   a door to the chests across from you when you step on it.    Ignore the chests and kill the archers with the Bane. Jump and swing to   the other side (or swim on the water). Go around the corner and jump   into the water and emerge on the other side. Keep going around the   corner and exit. You will see a Save Point across the broken bridge but   don't go to it yet! Look for the wall on the right side and scale it to   the top. Approach the lever and activate it to open the gate below.     Jump down and enter the small area to find the Dark Raven that was   killed earlier in the game. Grab the weapon sticking out of its body to   acquire a brand new weapon!      +++NEW WEAPON ACQUIRED: SPEAR OF DESTINY  Use the spear on the enemies at appear to clear out the area. Now it's   puzzle time!      +++SECRET: URN OF OLYMPUS  Remember that chest you saw that had the trap floor and spiked doorway   at the other side of this area? Here's how to get it: grab the statue   with the green emerald on it (the one to use for the Amulet) and drag   it onto the turnstile. Turn the turnstile clockwise until the statue is   facing south. Now drag the statue to the lower area. Activate the   Amulet and head back to the area with the trap floor before the timer   runs out. If successful, you will enter the room and find three chests   with a Gorgon's Eye, Phoenix Feather, and the Urn Of Olympus!    Head back to the area where you saw the Save Point (near the broken   bridge). Bring the statue BACK to where to you found it and place it on   the turnstile. Rotate the turnstile until the statue is facing EAST and   then place it back where you got it. Now go to the teeter-totter bridge   and jump on it to level the bridge. Activate the Amulet and then cross   the bridge to the Save Point.      SAVE GAME!      --------------------------------------...  --------------------------------------...                        +++  AREA: CROSSING THE LOWLANDS   +++      Now comes the fun part! If you've seen the commercials for this game,   then you'll know what I'm talking about. It's the pillar jumping mini-  game! Yeah! Here's how it goes:    Swing and jump past the first two grip holders and then grip the   pillar. Kratos will then jump to the adjacent pillar and start swinging   in a circle. Land on the platform across the pillar and let it fall. As   it reaches near the bottom, double jump to the grip holder and hold on.    The pillars across from you will begin to fall. Wait for the nearby   pillar to drop down and then swing and jump past it to the second   falling pillar. Wait as the pillar drops lower to jump towards the   lower grip holder. Jump and swing towards it and Kratos will begin   hopping from pillar to pillar.    On the fourth jump, wait for the pillar that you are on to slowly fall   down near the last grip holder. Double jump to it to swing to safety!   WHEW! That was crazy awesome! Now enter inside the cave.      This next part involves two difficult battles inside the cave. Go up   the path and you will encounter sirens and some large minotaur enemies.   Use the Fleece to defend from all the enemies and try out the Spear of   Destiny if you wanna spice up the battle. Be sure to perform fatalities   on them to restore health and Magic! Once the area is cleared, enter   the next area for ANOTHER battle!    The next area has some large satyr and berserker enemies. Stay   defensive and use the hard combos with the hammer or spear. Perform   fatalities on the enemies to clear the area. Now exit this cave and   head outside to find the Save Point.      SAVE GAME!|`|3815a94327e4b07e0380a9b728fe9614aa	u need to put it on the ring turn the handle until it points to your right put it back where it was then go back where you need to go slow down time and that is it

e8f7a7719506cc1191d73a7c1c31f8e2aa	yes you can.  Plug both games into your DS. Play Ruby until you have some pokemon you want to swith over,  Then, in Pearl, start playing until you beat the elite four. When that is done, you find yourself back home. Work your way back to the original professor's house. Visit him, and you meet up with Prof Rowan and Prof Oak. Prof Oak gives you a pokedex upgrade and tells you that the Pal Park is now open. Head south from Rowan's lab, surfing in the ocean. Walk across the small island, then surf to the east. Walk as far east as you can go, and then to the north you should see the Pal Park.  As you enter there, you are given the information on how to go about transferring captured pokemon. Note that once they are transferred from Ruby, those specific pokemon are gone from that game forever.  Then you are given an amount of time and pokeballs, and you go in search of the transferred pokemon. Your times are tracked. I don't know much more about it - I just got there this past weekend, and I haven't had a chance to try it yet.    Note that I'm told that, having the game in the slot also makes certain pokemon appear in the wild that won't be there otherwise.    Also, on a personal note, I had a damaged version of Sapphire that I was playing. By damaged, I mean I bought it used, and it didn't work quite right. But it played, and I was quite a way through the game - it just didn't update the berry trees, change the clock, etc.    I would switch between playing Diamond and Sapphire, and all was right in the world...    Until the day I fired up Sapphire and found that everything was gone.    I have no idea if something more went wrong with the game cartridge, or if something in Diamond wiped Sapphire, or if charging the DS, or what caused the problem. I just know that I'd played Sapphire for over 7 or 8 months and had all sorts of neat stuff, like several shinies, etc. and I lost them all.    I was very disappointed.  So be careful. There isn't an easy way to back up your games on the DS, from what I can tell.|`|xCOdBVMdaa	you need to beat the the elite four and get the national dex.first next prof. oak show you pal park.  after that everytime you turn on the game should be a line saying: migrate from... .choose six pokemons(cant have hm learned)and visit pal park see and catch the six pokemons      note :you cannot migrate if the six pokemons aren't already catch .you also have to wait one day if you change the time in pokemon diamond|`|kT065ugbaa	once you beat the elite four pal park opens up and you can migrate the pokemon from ruby into the pal park and catch them...dont worry tho the pokeballs you get to use to catch them, catches them  in one try|`|xtm0IjCwaa	aparantly u can put pokemon onto the ds and then to the game or sumting      o btw useing the wirless internet tradeing system u can duplicate pokemon  im not perfectly sure how but my freind did it with a shiny and trades for other shinys, then duplictes... and so on|`|RF2fvnU8aa	yes you can but you have to beat the elite four and see all the pokemon in the pokedex before you can migrate pokemon over then once you have don tht you unlock pal park and then you can catch pokemon that you have migrated there by selecting migrate from ruby on the main menu hope that helped|`|hfLMRC6vaa	Its very simple you just have to insert whatever previous game you want then go on pearl and at the start screen of pearl it should say migrate from ruby if u have it in and just hit that. but a tip is dont have pokemon you want to migrate in your lineup have everything you want in a pc box(also make sure you make them forget all there HM moves or they cant be migrated. hope this helps
IsPWJplGaa	Once you have gotten the National Dex off Prof. Oak, he will give you the Poke Radar. Then go to Route 218 and use the Poke Radar. You will not find it right away.

4CMzo3B1aa	Games that are goal oriented tend to be more addictive. MMO's are very geared towards this: advancing skills, gaining levels, acquiring new and more powerful equipment, etc. All these provide a sense of progress and accomplishment. In addition, since there are other players, there's that competitive desire to show off and "be the best." When you're not playing, you're not advancing, meanwhile, other people are getting ahead of you.    Most single player games are story oriented, rather than goal oriented, thus you can save, walk away, and come back later with no relative loss. Games like The Sims break this mold by also being goal oriented; the desire for a promotion, bigger house, more stuff. These games tap into the basic drive for success and ambition. Finally, these games provide instantaneous rewards: You spend X hours fighting monsters and DING! You get the new level. You start glowing, you learn a new move, you put on the new and snazzy armour.    I'm not into any psych stuff, I'm just speaking from experience.|`|lbStWWUAaa	well mainly mmo's are really addictive because you can be who you cant in real life, and thats the reason why many gamers get addicted to most mmo's, is because they love being a different person. They have more power and more choices in game than they do outside of them, and the social aspect also is a contributing factor because its like their living their real lives, but in a fantasy world.|`|dTLCvaYLaa	Heroes at Your Command  Guild Wars has always had NPC henchmen you could use to fill out your party on missions, but Nightfall takes this concept a step further. It introduces a new kind of henchmen called Heroes, which are unlocked as you progress through the storyline and can then be added to your group in any town. Unlike henchmen, Heroes level alongside your character and you have full access to their skills and equipment. You can outfit them and tweak their builds in much the same way that you can with your own character.    In battle you can bring up an action bar for each Hero that gives you access to their skills and a few other controls. You can move them around either individually or as a group by placing flags on the minimap or the play field. Its nice to have this added control over NPCs, and it adds an entirely new dimension to the game, even though you have to rely on the AI a lot because its very difficult to manage more than your own character and a couple Heroes in real time.    Another nice thing about Heroes is that they are a great way to explore the multitude of skills and builds in Guild Wars without giving up a character slot.    One curious aspect of Heroes is that they do tend to encourage solo play, which is a little odd for a multiplayer game. You can complete the entire Nightfall campaign with only Heroes and henchmen if you so desire. Assuming they are at the keyboard, I think even novice players are better than the AI-controlled Heroes, but Heroes are reliable, and they never complain if you suddenly go AFK for 20 minutes.

AA11612795	If you get your mercantile skill up to 75, you can invest gold in a store, meaning that you will be able to sell really expensive items at higher price.  There will be a button on the bottom of the screen that says "invest".  You will then pay 500 gold, and the maximum gold that the store has will increase by 500.  Some of the most expensive items, like Daedric armor, will max out a store's price (i.e. 1200 gold max at some stores). investing will raise that store's max gold to 1700, meaning that you can sell up to 1700 gold worth of stuff at once.|`|AA11739708	you need to max out your mercantile skill, and when u go to buy/sell, that option will appear.|`|iOfsbgZDaa	You have to get your mercantile skill up really high, then there is an option to do so...you have to buy part of the store, then you get money from them.  Unfortunately, it is a pain in the **** to raise mercantile...you get experience every time you buy or sell an item....to raise it quickly, sell all your items that are in groups separately....if you have 99 arrows, sell them one by one.

WppPGCSgaa	If you like racing games then you're better off going with Mario Kart DS. Diddy Kong racing has had a lot of bad reviews. As for the other two games, I don't know, but I'm going to guess neither is really any good. Might I suggest Animal Crossing Wild World, Pokemon Diamond/Pearl, the aforementioned Mario Kart DS and possibly Picross. I think you'd have a good time with Animal Crossing, though. You do things like plant fruit trees, fish, catch bugs, and talk to all the other animals in your town who come and go. Oh and you can make clothes and all sorts of other things. It can be played 24 hours a day because there's always a new event in your town, and if you have friends with the game you can visit them and trade clothes and furniture and other stuff. Give it a look at least I think you'd like it.|`|y8lzCFVUaa	Oh snap Diddy Kong Racing all the way!  I better get that game too lol.

AA11217613	Due to the frequency of rumored release dates appearing on the Internet, Square Enix's official website issued a statement reminding consumers that any "confirmed release dates" reported by sources other than Square Enix are "erroneous and should be disregarded". During Microsoft's media briefing at the 2008 E3, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be released first in Japan on PlayStation 3 in 2009, then released in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The latter would start development only after the Japanese PlayStation 3 version is completed, and could possibly come on multiple discs. A Japanese release of the Xbox 360 version of the game is not planned. At the DKΣ3713 Private Party event in August 2008, Square Enix announced that a playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII will be included in Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete (due for release in April 16th in Japan and North America) on Blu-ray Disc for PlayStation 3, along with new trailers of Final Fantasy Versus XIII and Final Fantasy Agito XIII. The demo will see a limited release, subject to the initial shipments of the Advent Children package. <br>  <br>  I really want to play this too i hope it comes out real soon!|`|uctxzjIIaa	Early Summer in Japan. sometime in 2010 everywhere else.|`|viIC9hUfaa	www.gamespot.com i dont know maybe next year or this year but not sometime soon.|`|jze2DDRJaa	On the solution to your problem with the Final Fantasy XIII , you can read here <a href="http://find-info-answers.blogspot.com/?q=Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20" rel="nofollow">http://find-info-answers.blogspot.com/?q...</a>

Si la pregunta se la hago al mentiroso dir: "mi compa?ero te indicar la puerta 1", pero como es mentira, la puerta que debera elegir sera la que no es 1.     En cambio, si le hago la pregunta al guardin que no miente, me dir la verdad, diciendo: "mi compa?ero te indicar la puerta 1", y como el compa?ero s miente, la puerta a elegir no ser la puerta 1.     Entonces elijo la puerta contraria a la que me indique cualquiera de los dos guardianes en su respuesta.

68CFyObHaa	Go to its status screen thing and look at the little bar at the bottom called the Sheen Bar(has little stars in it). This bar is probably full which means your feebas wont eat anymore poffin. There may be a way to fix this but im confident that there isnt one. This mean you wont be able to evolve your feebas. what i suggest doing is breeding more feebas (with a ditto if its male) until you get one that likes dry-food. then only feed it food of the highest lvl (make it in groups to solve this problem). <br>  Or you could just trade for one ove gts. If you have the right pokemon, people will trade anything.|`|AvnG6t4baa	No, unless you saved the game before feeding it the poffins. A pokemon, i think, not sure, can only eat 10 poffins total.

If he gives you a blue scarf, then lvl the feebas, and you have a milotic. I don't think you can get a milotic with the feebas you have. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck catching another feebas, or eveolving it|`|k8h2kAd1aa	check her condition,if beauty is not full,mabe you feed her too much!

Mais surtout il faut tre capable de contr?ler le fait que normment d'enfants soient devant des jeux qui ne sont pas de leur age, ce qui  mon avis est le plus important.    Et il y a une diffrence norme entre jouer  un jeu violent pour se dfouler, quand on a peu de temps de loisirs ce genre d'exutoire est efficace. Le problme vient de ceux qui ont beaucoup de temps de loisirs, les enfants en premier lieu, et qui risquent de voir leur sens critique s'mousser. Et l je pense que le r?le du parent est capital.    Personnellement des jeux comme GTA4 devraient tre fortement "restreints" car la violence qu'ils reproduisent est beaucoup trop raliste, et plus c'est raliste et plus ?a demande de cervelle pour prendre du recul, ce que les plus jeunes ne savent pas faire.

Il est temps que les autres cultures non occidentales sur notre plante ragissent et nous donnent d'autres exemples car assurment, il ne faut en occident compter sur aucune force ni politique, ni religieuse pour enrayer cette politique d'asservissement et d'addiction de nos socits  la dbilit, la crapulerie et au banditisme puisque dans cette socit de l'image et du virtuel, l'important n'est pas de vivre dans un climat et un environnement sain et panouissant mais uniquement de permettre au commerce mme crapuleux mais rmunrateur de poursuivre sa pitoyable croissance et aux images et aux sons de produire comme ils disent si bien des motions, les plus dbiles soient-elles !!!

C illustre assez bien la majorit des propos ici, prts  dfendre n'importe quelle pseudo libert, prts surtout  interdire qu'on leur retire leur propre alination  un systme dbilitant de repli sur soi. Et tous gnreux au point de vouloir imposer cette alination  leur descendance  n'importe quel prix. Les jeux vidos consistent, violents ou non,  dvelopper des comportements addictifs (vous vous trouvez beaux et intelligent aprs un w-end pass  cliquer sur des zombies ?), et  ne plus savoir s'merveiller des choses simples et naturelles.   Le fait que les jeux ultra violent circulent en circuit parallle ou pirate ne doit pas empcher qu'on les censure. On ne va pas arrter de rglementer les armes ou des psychotropes sous prtexte qu'on peut les trouver en vente libre...    A titre perso, grand voyageur par mes activits professionnelles, et ancien grand crtin goiste (? m'a cout la femme de ma vie), je suis un peu plus,  chaque anne qui passe, pour l'ouverture de l'esprit aux merveilles de la vie.

2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	----------------------------  Zone 4: Carnival Night Zone  Act 1  ----------------------------    Tails flies you to the level once you start (or he flies down himself if you   play as him). Anyway, keep heading right and you should run into an enemy that   bounces you up on a platform. Instead, just drop back down to the ground and   hit the red spring to the left. The spring will send you through a few stuff   then up into an air. If you land on a spinning wheel, just jump off to the   right and you should land on the ground next to a spike set. Just jump over it   and continue right until you get to a spinning pillar. It spins downward, so   just jump off the platform to the right. On here, head right and jump over the   spring, and continue until you get to a dead end. The tunnel above you will   suck you in.    At the top head left and get past the trio of bumpers and barrels, then a tube   will send you left up a wall, through a sent of small springs, then you will be   stopped by a bumper in the air. Just jump over it and head left. Jump over the   two yellow springs you'll see then continue. You should see a red spring.   Instead of using it get on the floating platform to the right of it. Keep   jumping on it to make it go higher, then use it to get to the platform to the   right. On here get on the higher platform to the right, then get the Water   Shield to the left. Now proceed right past the yellow spring and you will be   sucked in by a tunnel. At the to of it run up the wall to the left to get on   the higher platform.    On here head left and you will see a floating platform. See that wall next to   the platform? Walk through it, and you'll be in a secret room with a Special   Stage ring. Grab it for a Special Stage/50 rings, then exit. Now jump on the   spinning wheel to the right. When the timing is right jump off of it and get on   the higher platform to the right. On here head right and jump over the spring,   then hit the post. Continue right and you will get to a set of red and yellow   blocks. Spin dash through them to break through them, then you will be sucked   through a yellow tube. You should end up out in a tube to the right and the   left. If the right, continue right past the spike set and you should get to an   area with spinning wheels. Just jump down to the ground below you.    Down here fall in the small pit and hit the yellow spring to the left. You   should be sent up the wall onto a platform. On here head right and hit the post   below you. Then use the spinners to get on the platform to the right again. On   here continue right and you should get to a spinning pillar (you should end up   here if you got the left path in the spinning tube, so don't worry). It is   spinning upward, so let it take you to the top. Then jump to the top of the   second one. Now jump off to the right and hold right against the wall. You   should end up in a secret room with a Special Stage ring. In here grab the   special stage ring and use it for 50 rings/special stage. Now fall through the   fake wall. You should fall in a gap onto the ground.    Down here spin dash up the wall to the right. At the top head right and jump   over the spring. You should get to a spinning pillar. Jump on it, then jump on   the 2nd one, then the third. On the fourth jump off and try to get on the   platform to the right. There should be a Water Shield on it. Now walk through   the fake wall and you'll get to a Special Stage ring. Get it for 50   rings/special stage. Now you will fall through a fake floor. Down here head   right and you should get to a dead end, where a tunnel sucks you upward. In   this room spin dash up the right wall and hold right. You should go through a   fake wall. In here is an Electric Shield and two Ring Boxes. Grab all of them   and leave.    Back up here spin dash up the left wall and onto the platform. On here head   left and a tunnel should suck you upward. Up here head right, hit the post, and   you should end up in a large room with green and yellow blocks.    ...  Mini Boss: The Spinning Disk Machine  Difficulty: 1.5/5    This guy is easy if you know what you're doing. You cannot hit him when you   fight. When the fight starts he will release a disk from himself spinning   around the room. Now hit him to open the bottom part of the machine. Now the   spinning disk must run into that part to hit it, then the machine closes up.   Hit it to open it up again and repeat this until the disk hits it for a total   of 4 times. Easy, huh?  ...    -----------------------------  Zone 4: Carnival Night Zone  Act 2   -----------------------------    Once the level starts, head right and tubes will send you onto a red and white   spinner. You may be stopped by white bumpers. If so, ignore them and use the   springs to the right to get into the gap below you. Down here you'll be in the   water. Go through the set of springs and fall in the pit. Down here get to the   lowest part of the area and go through the tube. Now, get past the barrel that   should stop you. In this large area get on the spinning barrel above you. On   here jump out of the water and hit the post to the right. Now jump on the   spinners to the left and jump over the spring. Now jump on the spinners above   you and get on the platform to the right.     On here use the bumpers to get on the higher platform to the left. On here head   left until you get to a set of springs. Use them to get to the left. Once you   get past the springs jump over the red spring to the le|`|AA11175055	I remember that game.

ac0e4328f44fe4fde51e90d972aaf6d2aa	In terms of the gameplay i like the underground 1 and 2 series better. I prefer the uninterupted street and drag races. I was very impressed with the original need for speed underground and i was even happier with the second one because i was able to fine tune all my vehicles. They also both have real good soundtracks.  Need for speed most wanted is a good game with a good sound track but i hate having to be racing and avoiding police at the same time , it takes away from the race ,even though some argue it makes it more realistic its a racing game and i just want to race. As i said they're both really good , but as a game player i like racing games that just stick to racing and not police chases.|`|AA12237557	Most Wanted, more personal rivalries plus u get to go against the cops, and you can win your opponent's sick ride.

bf21744950a0e70ac2f2fa2a6a3f0708aa	Hello Phoenix,    Okay lets see...I remember that you shoot his eyeballs till they explode and they do shoot lasers at you so watch out.  Also the eyeballs should still be connected to the brain with a laser so don't get hit with it.  Once both eyeballs are destroyed the brain will attack you.  It will teleport a lot so don't lose sight of it on your radar.  Now here you have to shoot an area behind/under the brain a couple of times.  Do not get in it's path or you will be trapped in those tentacles under the brain where damage is done to you and one of your wings will be gone.  A good trick that I use to do was face the other way of the brain and wait till it is almost behind me.  Then, with good timing use that summer-salt move to get behind the brain to where your right by the core and do some serious damage.  Keep on repeating this till it blows up.  After the screen goes white and a couple of seconds Fox's father tell you to follow him out.  Do not waste anytime and always use your turbo when its available.  Make sure to follow his path or you'll end up the wrong path leading you to blow up.  No weapons needed here just hurry on out with minimum damage. Now once your out, you've completed the game. Thanks for the great answer and hope this info helps in anyway. Man now I miss playing that game, I wish I still had my N64...*sigh*. Oh well, best wishes to you and all gamer alike! ^-^    Respectfully,  GrayFox    P.S. to 'fodors456': Fox's father somehow came back as a "ghost image" to guide you to safety and disappears after you've escaped.|`|55e8cf5a1820e1b00e3657eb772f79e3aa	game strategy guide listed on www.onsaletag.com|`|2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	Is this the original starfox? or what?|`|AA10237465	I haven't played that game in a while, but I remember how to beat him.    1: Shoot at his eyes until they blow up.  2:There is a lobe on the back of the brain, shoot it enough and he will die, but watch out for his tentacles, and he teleports occasionally.  3: Quickly follow your father, don't waste time and stay close, or you will die.    Good Luck|`|929694b2ce0a06ac25cc10355ace0538aa	Malcom what do you mean by "Follow your father" he's dead in that game

Because this story is fake, you only want to know the girls answer because you know how cruel and vindictive they are, and that turn you on, freak.    If you get revenge then the violence will not stop, dont get revenge, talk to him, if that dont work talk to your parents.  Dont kick him in the privates you GAY:  Some facts about testicle trauma:  -It may cause the victim to throw up.  -It may cause the victim to passout.  -Scar tissue.  -It may cause testicular torsion, by initiating a muscle spasm; this is rare but is a medical emergency, testicular torsion may not happen immediately after the trauma.  -Testicles move freely and are slippery to avoid trauma, but if the trauma sustained by the testicle is hard enough (50Kg), the testicle will POP(rupture), and then probably must be removed. This is rare, and usually is associated with sport injuries when not wearing a cup. Even when can be repaired, the resulting inflammation will turn most of the contents into permanent damaged material.  -Even a medium force trauma will cause the destruction of spermatozoa-production cells. It will not cause sterility because those cells are in massive quantities, however those cells do not regenerate, it is permanent damage. And if hit many times or too hard, it may cause infertility, because the sperm count/mobility must be acceptable in order to get a woman pregnant by natural means.  -Will also reduce spermatozoa production as a result of hormonal changes, one of those changes is testosterone reduction.  -Erection problems.  -May damage the epididymis, and that is critical, because sperm must be stored there to gain mobility to be able to swim.  -May rupture major blood vessels, and draining the scrotum will be needed. Or microscopic veins inside the testicles, this will permanently destroy cells indirectly.  -In case of very hard trauma, the testicle/s can swell for more than a weak, with resulting excruciating pain and severe damage from prolonged heavy inflammation. The swelling it is similar to mumps, but in the case of mumps it will cause sterility for sure, and the testicles(usually just one) will shrink too, very sad and scary.  -In some cases may cause the antibodies to start attacking the person own sperm.  -It may even cause death as result of PAIN, heart will fail right away or will begin to fail(heart beat will became fast and irregular, usually face and lips very white) until finally stops, this is called neurogenic shock, and it is not that rare like people think, most of the times the victim is saved because gets medical attention on time, it will need shocks to the heart using the defibrillator!.|`|4ec8a07a71135c714e2df75d28aa47baaa	put nair on his eye brows so when he wakes up he'll wash his eyebrows off. put make up on him when he's sleeping , take a picture and send it to his girlfriend.|`|2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	when he'sin the shower, take all of his clothes, the ones in the bathroom, in the washing machine, his dresser, all of it, and throw them far away outside.
