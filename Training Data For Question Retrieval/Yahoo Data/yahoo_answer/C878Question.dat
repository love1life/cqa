A man I know is offering classes in interview skills.  He will also perform a MOCK INTERVIEW with me for an hour for $100.  He will then report back to me what he thought of my interviewing skills, and then give me feedback on how I could improve.    When I interview for a job, and do not get hired, I never get any feedback on how well I did, so I could be saying the wrong thing.  I could be coming off as a light weight or a fool and never know it.  I thought maybe the man who does the mock interviews could tell me how others see me.    The man who does the mock interviews is a 25 year Recruiting and Human Resources veteran and has interviewed almost a thousand people.    Would you think this is a good use of my time and money?

I have had nothing but trouble and hassle from halifax for the past 2yrs, they sent debt collectors after me for money i didn't owe them and have proof of this. Anyway after a about a year an half of this and me chasing them around looking for answers i get a call from their bank retail collections manager saying that all funds have been refunded to my account and that all debt had been cleared and the account was closed. I recieved this in writting too. But the other day, i checked my credit score on experian, they was still saying i owed them money for the same account, i told experian the account had been closed etc and they said they would investigate it, so today i get a call from another debt colletion agency demanding i pay them for that same account, i told them the account was closed and i had proof of it being closed, they was very rude to me etc so i hung up the phone, I then called halifax and asked them what the hell was going on and told them to put me thru to retail bank collections, they said they can't because its no longer got anything to do with them and it was down to me and the debt collectors to battle it out. Surely something can be doen about this, they can't get away with it! Please can anyone give me advice on how to get out of this mess?!?!

I want to eventually own a small coffee/pastry shop, and I am trying to decide which is the best route to take.    1) I thought of attending the community college's Culinary Arts program here in my area, as it seems to have a high rating in this state and it teaches things regarding the food industry as a whole, including espresso and baking stuff, but also the financials, management techniques, and other useful crap. But it's an expensive option that I would need financial aid for.    2) My friend suggested interning somewhere for little/no pay in exchange for experience as a barista. I already have a job that I don't want to just drop (I JUST started it) to find a barista job because all the paid jobs are taken, so part-time volunteering for the direct purpose of experience seemed like a good plan, but I'm not sure...    Then, 3) There is a barista training school two hours away that charges $3000 for a 6-day crash course in the business of the coffee industry and learning all the drinks, recipes, and machinery of a coffee shop. The classes are like, 10 AM to 4 or 5 PM or something like that everyday for 6 days. But yeah....    So which is the better option do you all think? Thank you!!!

Now, I need a way to buy a 360 without waiting 60 weeks, because I get about $10 each week, and I put 5 of it torwards all my reserved games(1 is still not payed off, and I still need money for a game for the PS3 im getting for Christmas) and the other 5 goes torwards buying a 360, and I want the one that costs $300. Is there any way I can get about $100.00 within a week or so. I could sell my PS2, but then I wouldn't hae anything to do until I buy my 360, or get my PS3 for Chrismas. Anyone have any suggestions?

The government charge more for 6 months, therefore it's cheaper to buy tax for year.  This kind of deal from the government is leading those who  are struggling to go into, if not further into debt, either buying a year as it's cheaper in the long run but causes some financial problems for low income families.  It should be exactly half.  It's the low income families that can only afford 6 months that get penalised...by their own government! They don't charge more paying TV license in instalments.
