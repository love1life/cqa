VjgIeIMgaa	...not quickly so that it makes u seem desperate. but not too long that it makes you seem that u'r too good for him. try in between that. like maybe 4 mins approx or between 4-10mins|`|AA11441704	The time I get it.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Respond why wait and play him???|`|MONbNUmkaa	wait a few hours- I would want my txt to be thoughtful(not just say any old thing) I want him to have to think about what i said too!|`|wLLvYW95aa	it depends what the first text is|`|WfUMOPyhaa	yes|`|To85W1Rgaa	Well, let's put it this way: your boyfriend should be essentially your best friend. If we phrase it that way, it makes sense to text him back in the normal time it would take to text any one else who is your friend. However, if you really, REALLY like him, one way to show him you're interested is to text him quicker. Waiting might just make him think you're not interested in talking to him.|`|3QSiLT2baa	I'd wait a few minutes. 5 - 10 minutes and then send.|`|psB5SKjbaa	respond quickly....<br>  <br>  =)|`|NmA0nJKHaa	quickly|`|CUB3wUdiaa	when you get them respond.  easy as pie.|`|O0WAfDJVaa	of course.you dont want him to think your not interested.|`|9mv3XPeBaa	no

WSZVJRIwaa	No, not at all. That's completely normal. The main thing is that you use protection.|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	No its ok...|`|ZldKA17Iaa	if you think thats not all your relationship is based on then go ahead and do what you think is right !|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	its very VERY normal for you to want to do it a lot after the first time you do it|`|NmA0nJKHaa	Its normal for young lovers|`|ICjBorriaa	that sounds normal to me.|`|haGMBfmPaa	as long as it feels right go for it. the moment it feels forced to you back off... that's the highway to a failed relationship|`|3QSiLT2baa	Ehh..

Use a condiment! :D
QzAdkugBaa	Not at all. If its them falling in love with you that your worried about, think about it, they would probably be one of the only global groups who understands some things are out of bounds. Well generally anyway.<br>  <br>  What is there that's wrong?? They're nice!|`|0yZB6KIiaa	the lesbians i have encountered have been pretty aggressive. in general i cant say they make me uncomfortable because i have only had run-ins with about 3-5 girls and those girls were very persistent. They were also more "on me" then guys like more in my personal space.<br>  <br>  all and all i think think girls are hot but i havent found one that isnt too clingy.
UUlcbdxqaa	He tell lies. He can treat u lyk tis, u can oso treat him de same way he had treated u! U r so soft-hearted, dats y he lies u dat he is sleeping whenever u texted him. when he tok 2 u, u can dun ans him back too. When he ask u 4 de reason, tell him dat tis is wad u had learned from him, dat is so irritating.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as if he would tell you he was .. .. he was with some other girl ..i bet ,, drop him .|`|MJyM1XWJaa	Ok first of all you need to calm down. If you talk to him with accusations he will get defensive and annoyed. And if he really hasn't done anything wrong like he says, then it's not fair of you to accuse him! <br>  <br>  Now, I understand the frustration. I think most women have been in this situation. What I do with my boyfriend is I talked to him about it when I was calm. I told him not what I was afraid of him doing, but rather how it made me feel. I told him that I udnerstand he is busy too but it only takes 2 seconds to text. I told him that I just need to be reminded that I cross his mind during the day because I forget easily :p<br>  <br>  Just talk to him. That's what you should be doing in a relationship, communication. Skip the accusations. Tell him you understand he isn't cheating you just feel neglected even though that sounds silly. Like I felt like the biggest retard telling my bf and I told him that I felt like the biggest retard because while you tell him, you realize all the sweet things he does do to show he cares. And so then you end up reassuring yourself AND he knows of the problem. Afterwards and some practice, my boy now calls <3 because he knows it's important to me and it's important to him.|`|Nwp3Ar9taa	If you suspect that he is cheating I would go over to his living space(house, apartment, etc) and call him while you're in the driveway or parking lot. If he answers pretend like you are at home or at work, ask him questions like what are you doing? simple things. If his car isn't there, keep the same plan like before and you will probably catch him bringing someone back there, especially if he thinks you are miles away.<br>  <br>  There is another possibility that he just needs some personal space and I totally get that. In that case he needs to grow a pair and tell you that he just needs space.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8bd9v4OHaa	maybe he IS sleeping.<br>  afternoons are long and boring, he might have dozed off watching tv or something.<br>  you should trust your guy.<br>  if you still dont trust him, its either you stalk him to see if he's sleeping or tell him that you're not buying his bull**<br>  if he is really sleeping, and you tell him that.<br>  big problems will arise.|`|e4DAjaYUaa	SWEETHEART IM VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT BUT I THINK YOUR BEST BET IS TO END IT BEFORE YOUR LIVING LIKE THAT FOREVER. MY BOYFRIEND DOES IT ALL THE TIME BUT HE WORK WEIRD HOURS. I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.|`|uh5DlJzqaa	maybe he just needs some space i know its hard but guys hate being called 24/7. Sometimes they just want to have some solitude thats all. just give him some space and he'll calm down|`|dbI7JFCDaa	ok well im 22 and i have heard it all."I didnt hear it", "I was asleep","I was in the shower". Anywasy i think he might be cheating on you. He isnt just ganna come out and say Yes im cheating on you!  Take it from some body that had some pretty *** whole guys leave him now.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	Break up with him. Can you imagine spending the rest of your life feeling like this? Its not going to get any better.
MJyM1XWJaa	I feel you. I'm 22, I used to do the same thing. Understand that this behavior will drive him away! Just be yourself. Or try to be. It's good taht you are aware of this. Instead remind yourself of all the wonderful things about him and your relationship together. Like how if he didn't care about you he wouldn't call ever. And how this is a happy and healthy and great relationship as you said and maybe that's why you are afraid it's almost too good to be true. <br>  <br>  Appreciate all the things he does. Sometimes we forget to do that with the people we hold close. If he ends it, being scared or worried about it ahead of time won't make it any worse, it just wastes your happy time. And if he's happy nad you're happy then why would it end? <br>  <br>  good luck, and don't worry it's not that's it's normal or abnormal it's just overanalyzing girl mode lol. You're way ahead of the game ebcause you know you are doing it. Just reassure yourself and if that really starts to fail then he can reassure you as well.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	It's because you are a woman...you are all hormonal and irrational alot.  But be careful...you attract what you think about.  You keep it up and it might manifest into REAL problems, and then you got that self-fullfilling prophecy you were looking for...<br>  <br>  MY ANSWER ROCKED. I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE GAVE ME PROPS|`|3zr9dHffaa	I don't think it's normal, maybe there's a deeper reason as to why you're feeling so paranoid?<br>  <br>  You need him to tell you how he feels about you just to comfort you, to remind you that everything is ok. If he keeps saying that to you maybe then you'll stop feeling this way.<br>  <br>  From what you told me here I think everything is fine in your relationship, you just had an odd emotion.|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Spice it up a bit you poof.|`|kLRsERrlaa	yeah, its normal to get feelings like that sometimes. <br>  I am in an amazing relationship since last summer with the perfect girl of my dreams, my soulmate, and even I had that sort of feeling for awhile there.<br>   like maybe I wasnt good enough for her..... maybe she may end up ending it,...... maybe she will tire of me...... etc.......<br>  But I have spoken with her, asking her some kind-of side questions that urged the answers out for what I really wanted to know.And now I am positive that she truly does love me like I love her.<br>  <br>  If u are sure it is a great, healthy relationship, then hang in there and do your best, hoping for the best.
H2TFQGFgaa	All this for only asking? Seems over the top but here goes.<br>  <br>  Leather jacket, white t-shirt and blue jeans,slicked back hair....the 50's look.... ride up on a  motorcycle, put on the Fonz attitude....... hand her a single red rose <br>  ( a sock monkey? or some adorable stuffed animal)<br>   and ask!|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Say this "I promise I can be your superstar for the night, trust me baby where I come from there ain't a chris brown so there isn't gonna be a fight, I mean when I'm with you it feels so right, If you were in my sight and I can accompany you for the night i promise i'd be polite." :P lol|`|f17RMVa3aa	i agree with Emir<br>  <br>  say what he said or make up your own so it's original.<br>  or<br>  Get 4 of your guy friends together and give each of them a shirt with a letter on it: one P, one R, one O, one M.

QEzVzBKqaa	Is this certain someone in your class?<br>  <br>  If so, initiate conversation by asking if she would like any help with the work. Providing you know what your doing, of course. Haha.<br>  <br>  Jot down some more detail, and i'll have another look in 10 mins.<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  <br>  Try and just act casual. I know it's probably easier said than done, but really, that's what you need to try and aim for. Casual conversation.<br>  <br>  Anything that holds a bit of relevance is definitely a great way to initiate conversation. E.g. Work, School, Temperature. Something you can relate to her about.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|FyqCMrCdaa	first put on a good smile. (People smile back at people that smile at them.) then say something like "hey hows is your day going?" then take it from there. you may be nervous but once you break that nervous barrier and take action then you forget about it. :)|`|hiiQtIPxaa	yea.... good question! lol|`|VjgIeIMgaa	if its a girl that u've never talked to before then go with some school subjects, then introduce u'rself, that works well. then after that keep the ball rolling like asking about her life and stuff.

TOSeJQJnaa	Love and relationships in this world are based on each person working as hard as they can to get their own needs met with little regard for their partner.  Women have a particularly hard time because they go into marriage expecting to have this wonderful man take care of all of their physical and emotional needs.  They romanticize love and marriage and quickly find out that it does not meet their expectations.  The saying that there is a thin line between love and hate is very true.  That is because we don't truly know how to love someone other than ourselves and that leads us to find tremendous dissatisfaction in life and in marriage.  Thus, our egos cause us to have feelings of hatred towards those who we feel our not meeting our needs. <br>  <br>  I have included a couple of links which will explain this much better than I can.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	mate its the money most times .. you cant give then enough i think .|`|gwK3ouVlaa	Ok then why are you still together? A lot women say that and still have sex because maybe it is good or maybe it is when they are angry at them? Who know?|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	lets  face it - it  don't take much  to turn  love into hate. May be hate is  too stronger  word to use. Perhaps  dislike or disillusioned with are  better. The Thing is people  get married with their head  full of silly notions, more often than  not they don't  know  the Other person  that well, "Its  true when they say  you never know someone  until  you have  lived  with them" . It must be a real  eye opener for some when the  magic of the  moment runs out of steam and they wake up  and smell the  coffee. they soon find out  that  the person  they have married  turns  out to be a slob .  Many women  end  up disliking their  husbands  but still  have sex  because   the alternatives  are  affairs  or going without. <br>  <br>  Sex isn't reliant  on love, its an animal instinct  it goes on all the  time  between  people  who may not even know  each other. <br>  <br>  Oh and by the  way it works  both ways  "hubbies  wake up one day and  think jeez why did  i marry that"!  Then  when they get   home  want to  have  their  wicked ways  with the  object of their disaffection.. The human spirit is sooo complicated  lol|`|W8aiAWe2aa	I don not understand it either.<br>  I had a mate that actually preferred her husband being at work all day.<br>  I love having my husband about. We have had our ups and downs like normal couples BUT I could not live without him as he's my soul mate and best mate all in one.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	So what's been happening th last 7 years? did you just give up? Did you not know that marriage takes work? Maybe he gave up as well, but maybe one of you did bc the other did.<br>  <br>  Way to go, quitter.|`|I3CNklLKaa	So let's get this straight - you DON'T hate your husband - but you,ve been celebate for 7 years.<br>  <br>  Call that a marriage?|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I understand women who hate their husbands.  And it is not that they hate them, they hate themselves.  It is awful to wake up one day, laying next to a man that a woman realizes she settled for.  Some women get married for a variety of reasons, and not one of those reasons is because they love their man.  Most reasons are because that woman never learned to love herself, by herself.  Some want security, to runaway from an unbearable situation, to obtain from that man something she lacks in herself, or that she is so insecure with herself that she marries the first man to take interest in her.  Whatever the reason, all women and men should learn to accept him/herself and love him/herself.  That way he/she wouldn't have to find him/herself in another person, he/she will already have what it takes to be loved and give love.|`|Nwp3Ar9taa	Hate is a word that is thrown around to easily these days. Perhaps people don't realize how it sounds or if they do they don't care. <br>  <br>  My grandfather and grandmother had been arguing for a couple of years and she got pregnant. My great grandfather said I thought you were mad at her. He said mad for face, not for a$$<br>  <br>  It's a crazy world that we live in make the most of it and love as many as you can.|`|eca52ae9704fb9c7cd7eb869aaf7e5f2aa	What do I think? Some women don't want to have to go through a major change like divorce, so they stay in the situation they are in because they are accustomed to it. They may also fear that they wouldn't find someone else.|`|w6v8JnBAaa	I think if I hated my hubby I'd still have sex with him.

If you don't want to put your picture up yet, you don't have to. It's not like making the account is going to be a huge milestone in your life. It's put there so you can keep in contact with people that you can't see much, like your family for instance. This really isn't a big deal. Delete the old account and make a new one with your real name.|`|7RbootLlaa	I can't read all that. It's so small typing. Look, I'll make it easy for you, just insert these words after your answers.

What is the intentions behind this desire? Really look deep down inside and question the attraction. Could it be because deep down inside, you know you deserve better, but hanging onto him is like a form of masochism?<br>  <br>  The mental connection may be there, but when you look deeper, I think you deserve someone who will really be 'there' to listen and understand- traits of which a truly rich relationship exhibits, in which I don't see in this one.<br>  <br>  Just being honest.|`|NBT5PoRVaa	wtc (what the crap)... you are contradicting yourself.

I understand you completely! You could be 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, or 65 and you will always find men who tell you they love you, but are not into a relationship.

C7C3vVeYaa	Na.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Yes, only a year or two.  With teens, I think you should keep it in the same grade.  A 16 year old and an 18 year old have very different goals and values, and their hormones may not be on the same wavelength.<br>  <br>  And if you're 12, you shouldn't be dating at all.|`|PE7OS0f6aa	3 years apart is the absolute limit for appropriateness|`|f8bdbf58f085a611413f7039f0ff211daa	Yes! 2 years at most. If the guy is older, he might take advantage of her. She will most likely be less mature and that might cause a little friction in the relationship. They have different views on things and priorities. College can be something too.|`|f17RMVa3aa	same grade is always good because say a 14 yr old dates a 16 yr old. it's a little awkward because ones almost a senior and the other could just be starting high school|`|y0GOP487aa	Yes!!! The separation in classes, and eventually college can be very taxing on the emotions.|`|hw3jNGubaa	at the most 2 years apart but other than that it can be a bit awkward you know??|`|RV48gX9Saa	From my own experiences, I personally think that teenage relationships are kind of useless. Though most teenagers start to get a strong desire for companionship, and love, it is really just fake, and all the relationships end up bad anyways. Getting pregnant, heartbroken, and breakups. But if you must... Same grade is easiest, or atleast keep it in your school. (Dont date someone in highscool if your still at elementry)|`|4DbpJPXKaa	2 to 3 years is old enough unless it's like that boy in Britten who knocked up a 15 year old and he was 13 thats a bit young to even be dating|`|RhStSLCgaa	age shouldnt matter unless its like more than 20 years apart..grossss!!
o5LS7vS2aa	Just tell her O gosh shut the **** up I dont want to hear about you and your stupid boyfriend! tell her look thats between you and him i dont care im not dating him i have to worry about who my next is gonna be!! or do the thing in the cheeto commercial walk away but wipe your hands off on her shirt before you leave. lol!! I dont think your overreacting|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	noo ur not overreacting i havee scummy friends too hahaa thats fu*ked upp she should try to help u and talk aboutt it and stuff shes justt bein a di*k noo offense|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Uh nooo SHE'S overreacting lol. Give her some time to cool off...sheesh doesn't she realize you are hurting after your breakup???|`|MVY8xhXlaa	It's "my bf and me" not "me and my bf"<br>  <br>  learn how to speak?|`|RKZHGqh7aa	Calmly explain to her why it's bothering you, rather than just telling her to stop. Maybe she doesn't understand that you're hurting right now. If it's easier, write her a note. If she still insists on talking about her boyfriend, it's because she's an insensitive jerk.|`|u48w4AvZaa	No you are not. You and your boyfriend broke up recently. You're probably still sensitive about it. Of course things like that are going to bother you. Maybe your friend is just really proud of her boyfriend or something but she should support you at times like this. Good luck.|`|OAkL8yuSaa	No offence but your friend sounds like an insensitive moron.|`|Q4JCeVB9aa	Go apologize.?? Don't let this one thing get between friends.? Right now during your teen years, this is a major deal.?? As you mature, you will find out how precious friends are and that things like this are not enough to end relationships.?? I would like to see you think the other direction too.?? You were sad.? She was happy.?? Why didn't you take her side and be happy for her and her boyfriend and listen to her good day?? Why did she have to be sad and listen to you?   Maybe sharing in her joy would have made you happier.
8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	your friend sharing this with you is actually illegal.  he had no right to do this to the othe rperson and you have no right whatsoever to get  involved.<br>  <br>  everyone needs to mind their own business and respect each others privacy.<br>  <br>   i would hate to be friends with any of you.|`|dbQHlp85aa	why should you even care. He's obviously jealous of your new life and he's being a child about it. <br>  <br>  Don't do anything.. but you should tell your nark friend that for 1 he's a troublemaker and 2 to discourage that kind of talk about his friends
RDWVoc9Naa	you have probebly been flat out busy with wedding stuff that it hasnt sunk in that u are getting married to the love of your life!!!<br>  <br>  have some wine with ur fella and a bubble bath and think that in 4 weeks time you will be his mrs!!!<br>  <br>  good luck and relax|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Dont know maybe you are not the type to get excited about things ?<br>  I have 3 months and 14 days till mine and every time I think about marrying my gorgeous man I get butterflies I dont know what I will be like on the day.....|`|RfGTXlotaa	it is hard to get excited about something when you are so busy planning it and dealing with the stress of it all but the moment you put on your dress or the moment you see your groom it will sink in and then the excitement will happen... just dont drink too much champagne getting ready otherwise excitement turns to nausea....|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	You're an adult.<br>  <br>  It's like being 4 weeks away from Christmas When you're a kid, your whole world revolves around Christmas.<br>  <br>  Now, it's probably not such a big deal.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it. When the Day arrives and you're getting ready, you'll be so happy you might explode.|`|CLJXTsFJaa	Have you been really busy?<br>  Have you been under a lot of pressure?<br>  That could be why.<br>  <br>  I am sure that once everything is all sorted and you have some time to relax you will feel that excitement.|`|C7wN4NxEaa	i think you've been too stressed and busy. take it easy.<br>  when the wedding starts coming closer, you'll prolly start gettin excited and all. just hang in there.|`|4NWDraPfaa	You have probably been so busy planning, working, etc to even realize that the big day is just 4 weeks away.Trust me the excitement will definitely set in soon, probably around the time you have a bridal shower or your rehearsal dinner!
F47MyGDSaa	You are NOT being stuck up. It sounds like you do a lot for her, and it sounds like she doesn't fully respect that. And I know you don't want to sound like the "bad guy" because, who really does in their own family, but you need to explain to your family why you "cut her off". Stop giving her rides. Tell her gas is still pretty expensive, and driving her around is okay, but you need help with gas money. If she can't pay for at least 1/5 of what you're using for her, don't take her around! And as for her kids, sure, if you're okay taking them, then take them, but she should also be responsible for getting her kids off to school, even if they have to take the bus! And she should use the bus to get to her school too! Why should you have to drive her AND her kids to school, when her kids can at least take the bus.<br>  <br>  The money she owes you is quite a lot. And I'm sorry to say, you may not see that money come your way for a while, or even at all. But if she ask's for money, tell her "I thought you just got a new tv, or didn't you just stay the night in some hotel?" and say "why don't you save up for money, because my husband and I work hard to earn money, plus we have a baby on the way!"<br>  <br>  And if her son punches you in the stomach, that's ridiculous and harmful to you and your baby. Refuse to watch him if he's going to be like that, or find a way to disipline (or take something away) so he learns, because he probably won't learn from his mother.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Eug52iQDaa	You're not being stuck up.  You're being used and abused.  Go with your instinct.  If family doesn't understand, make sure your husband does.  You and he need to concentrate on your family.  <br>  <br>  The games that child/woman is playing are infantile.  Don't get sucked in.
YlFZFYA8aa	think about it. would you rather have his friendship for a lifetime or be his girlfriend for only a little while? tell him that same thing. the quicker you tell him, the easier it will be to let go and go back to the way things were between you two. youve been friends for three years, he wont let you go that easily. he will be lucky to have you tell him this than break his heart slowly by stringing him along. trust me, thats the worst pain.|`|baC3UdzHaa	if he is smart he will back away...otherwise he may not get over you. My first rule in relationships is to understand when the relationship is one sided and act accordingly, politely, and responsibly. After all, I don't like feeling that way, why would i want anyone else feeling that way? Even if I like thier friendship.|`|tRrzHOCRaa	that really depends on how deep his feelings for you are and how big his ego is...if he doesnt have really strong attraction for you or a major ego problem then he will probably be ok and stay your freind...if his feelings are strong then he probably cant see you as a freind he would only be pining for you!! and if he has a over large ego he may hate you for the rejection humiliation|`|ITYz2WKaaa	just tell him how you truly feel, because your just going to create false hopes. Then his gonna want to marry you and so on. Just tell him how you truly feel and let him understand that you just like him as a friend. It might be awkward later, but hopefully you guys would be good:)) just talk to him.|`|zQheOHReaa	i think that it depends how into you he really is. but if he values your opinion, i think he will try his best to stay friends.
3lWXXwnNaa	There are many different types of love in my opinion, and love feels different from person to person. For example, you can respect someone and love them for who they are, like a friend, and you obviously care a lot about them, but that doesn't mean that you are in love with them. Then, there is that person that you love because they make you wake up every morning, they make you feel better no matter what's going on, they have the qualities you want and need, basically they complete you. You can feel similar feelings for different people. It seems as though you really liked the other girl because she was there for you and encouraged you. However, you if feel completely comfortable with the new girl and have feelings of wanting to be with her forever, that most likely means that you really like her. Perhaps, talk to her about your feelings or give her a chance and see where it takes you both. I hope that I helped in any way.|`|0O6jbsSZaa	i gave you the info you need at your original posting... dont forget to check out those sites.....  they are almost magic|`|VjgIeIMgaa	ok i'll try my best with this one. in life there will always be one love in u'r life. u'll always feel the pain when u think about her. love is difficult to explain. but just remember this if u keep thinking about her u'l just keep feeling more and more pain. if u can start to move on, u can still be good friends but u have to find someone else that u can feel strongly about. u are hanging on too much to u'r previous feelings and they are getting in the way of making u feel the same feelings with the person that may in the end be that special someone.
IIuafPfIaa	Report this. Report this now.<br>  <br>  Do it!|`|Eug52iQDaa	You answered your own question, sweetie.  Go with your instincts.  DO have a good life.  You can't choose family, but you can choose how you wish to live your life.
vGbWQJBVaa	no, they arent.<br>  friendship tips<br>  be loyal.dont try to get into groups, make your own<br>  first make others see u as u r & not wat u r not|`|BFqE10WYaa	depends. if u are always getting tease by them yes.|`|AdFucadgaa	No, they aren't true friends when there making fun of you.<br>  <br>  Just stay friendly, you'll find true friends don't worry.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	If you're depressed when you're around them, they aren't real friends. The purpose of having friends is to enjoy yourself. Especially if they're mocking your feelings.<br>  If your school is super cliquey, talk to some outcasts or nerds, they're less likely to be jerks (because nerds are awesome ^.^).|`|HJXezEuLaa	Well, the smile for no reason part is a bit awkward, though smiling only a little bit is good, as long as you aren't scowling.<br>  <br>   Uhh, to tell the truth, they sound mean. Okay, you should of said what type of people they are/ how they normally talk to you...<br>  <br>  I don't think they're real friends. For booster tips, bring up interesting topics or something... Something that you can easily relate to, and have a good conversation with.|`|7W8mw4qoaa	No, those aren't friends at all... When I was in fifth grade I had "friends" like that.|`|7XSMjgroaa	These aren't true friends. Stay away from them. If they are going to act like that, then you don't want to be friends with them.|`|9mv3XPeBaa	no, you french idiot.
IRtPNXK5aa	You didn't write a book! I can totally empathize with having a crush and reading into every sign. I think the best advice I can give you is remember that body language speaks volumes...not the klutzy stuff but wanting to be around you and it sounds like some flirting is going on too! Chill out and enjoy every moment! Forget about that MySpace thing...don't become a techno stalker! It's what happens in real life that counts!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its easy .. tell him you have a movie you are dying to see but cant go alone .. will he take you .. see its easy .. when you know how ...|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	oh brother. you call this a relationship. you are nothing more than co workers. that's all.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	Alot of guys don't spend hours on Myspace and such like girls do.  You are putting WAY too much into that.  Everything else sounds good.  Define this situation.  Do something bold like ask "How much longer am I going to have to wait for you to ask me out?" That will give him the hint|`|32597c9dc7d491df58598be987938d43aa	well, I am a guy, when I am around girls and I start feeling something Ill flirt with them and the signs i give off are somewhat obvious. If i were you. Get his number or something. Send him a message or show signs that you are interested|`|lTUXdbCTaa	For me, just sharing what I felt has always worked. I've been rejected, and accepted. It's the easiest way to find out though! :)<br>  Just always be honest.|`|7pT3Dz89aa	I think you should throw it out there that you like him. Just because he said that that he isn't on much doesn't necessarily mean he doesnt want to message you. He may just not be on much! And myspace is OVERrated. Trust me. If he likes to spend time with you at wrk then he could be into you also. :p Ask him to grab lunch sometime. If he goes for it, then ask him to dinner. and take it from there.|`|nhiSg3Veaa	you can never fersure know if a guy likes you or not unless you go to the source- him. maybe you should try asking him or try hinting that you like him. i think you can tell when they want to be around you and glance at you and smile thats usually they are pretty into you but they might be scared to ask you out or w.e. hope this helped?|`|78e05a2ceb7d8a26d9ed943cfb2a452faa	Just come straight out and ask him how he feels about you and make it plain that you are attracted to him.
hw3jNGubaa	that is so sweet!well parents can be about 4 to 5 years apart or more so...|`|PE7OS0f6aa	You're 15, she's 11...<br>  Sounds kinda iffy to me.  <br>  You can still be friends, very good friends with her and in later years start dating her, but seriously Cuz, 11 is kinda young she has alotta growing up to do and SHE WILL CHANGE.|`|ujiYCA2Qaa	yeah a little creepy, i mean she isnt even a teenager yet! i would wait it out its prob just cuz she either is really pretty or looks like her sister|`|f17RMVa3aa	give it a few years dude.<br>  <br>  she's still a little kid and you're almost learning how to drive?<br>  <br>  yeah just wait haha|`|y0GOP487aa	I've had that happen to me before, and trust me, it isn't a road you wnat to go down. I would refrain from telling her, and because of the age difference, don't hurt yourself or her by trying to date.|`|8i7AEWRCaa	oh boy ... she is too young, im sure theres somethin on with their family that you fall in love with these 2 sissies. give it time(long time) youll find some1 to love your age|`|xVEcaOveaa	definitely give it a few years....she's a bit too young.|`|ThjUoWN6aa	hello! she's eleven!!!! Wait a few years and see what happens then.|`|VjMyHAWraa	She's only 11! Give her a few years to become as mature as you are! :)|`|JZkCVHJAaa	are you confusing love with lust?
q0JTN9QAaa	As a whole the human race is taking less and less accountability for their actions and trying to blame forces out of their control for their own misbehavior, something they could have prevented if they wanted.<br>  <br>  Like cheating is preprogramed, alcholism/drug addiction is a diesease things like this are part of the don't blame someone for their actions because they feel bad about it society.  <br>  <br>  In the 1930's if you cheated people thought you were horrible person because you were and if you were on drugs you were a looser dead beat because you were, but now it is O.K to blame other things for problems with yourself.<br>  <br>  I have never met anyone that got the shakes for a beer at age 5 or that blacked out and cheated even though the whole time they said to their self i should not do this.<br>  <br>  People want to do these things and they also want someone else to blame.|`|ULUpOqplaa	You are comparing animal behavior to human behavior.  If you were to read about the history of humankind you would discover that for 5000 years or recorded modern history and for 200,000 years of ancient history humans had polygamous relationships.  It was the natural order of the human species.  About 1000 years ago the catholic church made polygamy a sin punishable by being boiled in oil.  Interesting that about that same time they made sex between husband and wife ONLY for the purposes of procreation, they couldn't do it for fun, AND they had to have a priest present.  Also, they licensed all of the brothels to the catholic church.  And since you have been raised in this "logic" of the modern era you would experience emotional trauma and stress.  Also, all cultures that deny polygamous relationships have a higher rate of STD's.  Those cultures that have a more open attitude, ie: legalized prostituion for one, have much lower rates of STD's in the public.  It helps to have some idea about which you speak before you do speak.|`|2Hh0RuxLaa	And what science have you read to back up  your claims???<br>  <br>  Or is it just your opinion?<br>  You are certainly welcome to your opinion and  you have a right to express it but I have the right to judge your opinion against what I read in peer reviewed journals.   I  get to judge how they did their experiments, how they gathered their information and how they came to their conclusions.<br>  <br>  And you have?????<br>  <br>  <br>  LD|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	I love your thought.  It makes me want to print it out so I can use it against all the cheaters roaming around everywhere.<br>  <br>  Instinctual cheating... BAH!|`|AA10494978	Well, you are kind of mixing science and individuality here.  I'm not saying you are wrong, in fact I agree with some of the things you wrote.  But I think we have to differentiate beween healthy sexual fantasies, which both ADULTS involved in the relationship agree on before anything and cheating.  Of course, incest is one of the topics which cannot be defended, there is definitely something clinically wrong with the people involved in it.  However, I don't know if generalizing in such a way as you have done is necessarily healthy for ALL relationships.  I think you have to leave room for individual tastes and I would be hesitant to label a relationship as "wrong" if the people involved have a healthy but unsusal sex life.  <br>  <br>  But you do pose a very interesting question.<br>  <br>  Update: If you are looking for a condemnation for cheating, I don't think you have look far.  Most people (I wrote people, not men) who cheat would themselves condemn  the act.  However, I think we have to differentiate between teh concept of "sex outside the marriage" and "cheating".  If you equate a one night drunken lust fest with a prostitue on the same level as the deliberate deception perpetrated on an unsuspecting spouse over a course of weeks, months or years then I completely disagree with your point.  In the second scenario the emotional and mental "cheating" started long before the sex ever happened and it is just as, or if not more, wrong than the physical intimacy part.  But you seem to argue that cheating is a physical act, which would lead me to believe that you equate cheating with sex.  I disagree with that notion and I suspect would most phsycologist today.  A marriage does not fall appart from a drunken one nighter, which will never happen again.  It will, however, fall appart from a systematic deception, which may or may not include sex, because the loss of emotional intimacy between partners is a lot more difficult to restore than physical intimacy.  (Sorry about the typos - I am keeping my eyelids open with toothpicks ala a Disney cartoon)|`|qw7BmBq6aa	You tell em girl!  Science has proved that the longer you stay with a mate, the better sex, the more fullfilling sex you will have.  You also get it waaay more, and also you will be happier in life with the same partner.  Scientifically speaking, if you want to have a happier, longer life filled with the best sex you can imagine all the time, then the smart choice would be to marry and stay with one partner.<br>  <br>  Then again, biology of the human nature is to reproduce as much as possible, thus the urge to sleep with multiple partners, to carry on the human race.|`|tUyHdqTkaa	Although I agree wholeheartedly with your point, some statements made are quite circumstantial.

st9KHhoKaa	There is nothing wrong with you have respect and morals. <br>  <br>  No offence your friends that hook up with girls that only want a one night stand, must be trying to fill a void emotionally, but having quick non meaningful experience. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, these people are most likely deep down wishing they had a person to love them . <br>  <br>  You will be the person who will win, because your true friends will respect you, and girls wont put you in the bad category of being a man whore or a playa, therefore you will find a decent girl who wants a relashionship. <br>  <br>  Yes it is possible to meet a decent person at a bar, but also bad people. <br>  <br>  A good idea would be to see the girls body language, how is she dressed, how is her behaivor, how much is she drinking? her responses to other men. <br>  <br>  Simple<br>  <br>  If you like a girl, simply go "hey, there how is your night going? would you like me to buy you a drink", then sit down with the girl and talk to her. Get her number and ask if she would like to catch up for a coffee the next day. <br>  <br>  Therefore she knows your a decent guy who only wants to her to know her, not some sleaze who only wants to go home with her and have sex.|`|AA10094964	i guess you can still form a good relationship or a lasting friendship with some random girl you just hook up with at the bar... i mean, its possible for one night stand, but i guess its nicer if you can get to know the girl after you had done the thing, you wouldnt know how it will turn out unless you give it a try, of course unless the girl is interested in getting to know you, or its just sex...|`|ReB7knjcaa	Stop going out to BARS!!! If you are looking for a serious relationship not a good choice of venue and the girls at bars are looking for the same thing believe it or not...|`|XCJSTQbkaa	dont feel bad. sum people just tank diff. if your the kind of guy that wants to be serious you should prob go sum where else and look for chicks|`|0DdSoi4Maa	There is nothing wrong with you at all.  That's really good, you seem to have more respect for yourself, others & seem to be strong.  I go to bars all the time, not wanting to hook up with. I just like to go have a good time, drink, dance, socialize.  But every time there's a guy that want to hook up & it annoys me.  I don't understand why we can't just dance & make conversation & have a good time.  Maybe become friends if we have interests or something.  Or just dance & that's it & find someone else.  I have also done the thing your guy friends do b/c I was stupid & fell for the guys tricks & words, but no longer do I b/c I know that's all they want.  I hope you don't give in & act like your friends, do what you like not what they like.  If you've never had a one night stand, maybe you should try it once.  But I wouldn't continue to do it over & over maybe just once.  Lots of people say a bar is not the place to find relationships.  I find that true b/c I've gone out a lot & all the guys want is to get laid, even more so when they're intoxicated.  I'm sure there's some people out there, like I would if I found a guy... but goes back to what I just mentioned.|`|Sfm3EntIaa	i think u have more respect for girls to jus hit it n quit it so no there is nothing wrong with that....there is always a chance of a relationship with someone u met at a bar it could happen but maybe u should try to talk to girls be friends...get some numbers hang out see where that goes...if u find a girl who wants the same and u to click then yes u could end up with a great relationship u dont have to take a girl home n sleep with her u can juss go hang out ..so for the way u feel i repsect u and so will many other girls just go have fun but remember havin sex with some random girl is not the only thing u can do at a bar ...|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Just tell them that you don't have the chance of ending up seeing the chick again and being told you are going to be a dad or that you get an STD. You are playing it smart. You are not missing on anything.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Is it you don't want to, or you can't? Because there is a difference.|`|AA10072732	you are on the right track. shows you are a sensible and a responsible person. don't let your friends sway you to the dark side. stand firm.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Girls can tell which guys are at the bars to hook up and what guys are there to have a good time, so the only girls your friends will be getting are girls with STDs.|`|AFGxrXSyaa	:) you sound like a very nice young man. there is nothing wrong with you. you just put more value into worth while relationships. and thats a good thing.|`|WDGPrlEUaa	you are on the right path..<br>  be this way forever..<br>  dont get into these!!<br>  be decent dude! no 1 likes a guy who likes one-night stands<br>  i am pleased to knw that atleast some1 iz decent..<br>  i think one should go for a relationship which is everlasting and which has a future..<br>  theres no use in goin around with some one just for time being and ending up loosing your own self nd becoming a person who is cheap...<br>  <br>  i think one should have a relationship of faith which is foreva love which is eternal bliss which is everlasting..<br>  <br>  dont let your friends guide you...be yourself..=]
Sfm3EntIaa	i think u too are juss friends with beneifts but he likes u more then that that is why he kinda is actin like he owns u but if he only wanted sex he would not do **** for u lol honestly ...so to me it seems he likes u a lil more then u do him ...try talking to him ..|`|strwIp8Qaa	the way i see it, yall have had sex. yall could be friends after that but come on, you can't really believe yall are. chances are that because you're feeling this way, he's feeling it too but because he's a guy, he won't express it. i think yall are past friends and more like cuddy buddies|`|8i7AEWRCaa	dont ask him... why do u really wanna know? i mean he means something to you and we cant tell what he means to you u must say it.<br>  if u ask him he may think that u r not happy about this relation. i wud thank god a thousand times every day if i had such a friend. give it time ull c.|`|H9Bzw0VNaa	hard to tell, but I think its slowly becoming a relationship, as in a "love relationship".  The more confortable he becomes with you the more he'll like you.  If you constantly see each other and its not in a booty call way, than i think he likes you more than just a friend.  Thats definetely not a "Friend" relationship.  At the moment it may just be in its beginning stages, but soon enough i think you should confront him and tell him what exactly you want or are understading outta your "arrangements".  I think, based on what youve said, that he's slowly falling for you.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	You already banged him?  You are a friend with benefits then.  I'd keep you around too.  Sex with no strings?? Would you like a 3rd friend?
AKc8EaKTaa	its ok. u just need to work on it with ur man and opening up. i think love is thee most powerful emotion you could ever feel and if u love him, he should make u feel like u dont have to pretend and show ur emotions to him and be an amazing girilfriend. me and my dad have had some issues similar to yours in the past, where we dont show our affections toward eachother. with people, its hard for me to completely show how i feel, and wen i was first with my bf it was dificult for me to show affection and handle an arguement well becuase of how i am around men. it takes time to be vulnerable and u just have to work on it. be nice to your man. he loves u, and i think u two need to talk about it and assk him wat makes him feel like garbage thatt you dont intend on making him feel that way and wat u can do to help. hope u work it out.
f25peTSXaa	you need to pull back<br>  hes into you<br>  but men get bored<br>  stop calling/ writing<br>  pretend like your happy<br>  but lost interest<br>  <br>  and he'll come track you down|`|C7Ehw7Kdaa	How do you know if its disaapointment? Did you ask him directly? Some men really do have a hard time expressing themselves. Sometimes they care but they just have a real weird way of showing it. Maybe it would be a heart to heart talk with him and confront him about this..It's better to get everything out in the open dont you think? If he feels awkward about expressing his feelings toward you about his situation then maybe he shouldn't be considered on your priority list. You need a man who's upfront with you and doesn't play these stupid mind games.|`|iD4ejChZaa	he's married
oCuuGaT2aa	You feel that you're possesive so you don't like such things to happen...but you Love your Husband na...You should give the chance for him and later see what does he do and why?<br>  This will resolve your Question Hopefully|`|2ieiGIhTaa	If I should happen to die, I would really like my wife to re-marry.  Her happiness is very important to me.<br>  <br>  You ARE very selfish.|`|aWldCMwBaa	I think that if your spouse is happy with another person, then it's fine. The only thing I would be worried about is if the other spouse's spouse just makes the family forget all about me or makes my spouse not care. Then that's when I need to step in and tell my spouse that before I die, he/she needs to always remember me.|`|koSLFtSbaa	My ex-husband was married 4 times and me once.  But I have a niece that just experienced what you are talking about, she was very happily married and lost her husband due to illness.  And she remarried after several years and is happily married and the kids are doing fine that she had and they are happy with the marriage and understand it. So what I can suggest is not to try to get to positive.  Things like death can happen and people deserve to be happy, so it is something for you to think about in a kind way.|`|uNVOPkruaa	no your not selfish. your alive and you love your husband .. obviously the thought of him being with anyone else other than you is horrible. i don't like the thought of my boyfriend to be with anyone else either. my boyfriend always tells me that if i died he wouldn't be with anyone else no matter what. but i highly doubt that, lol i think i'm just more scared that he will move and be happierr with another girl than he was with me, and kinda forget all about mee .. but either way your not selfish, it's normal to feel like that.<br>  :)|`|svg71dazaa	I have already told my husband that he should re-marry if i die. I would no longer be on earth so why make him live a lonely life when there might be another good woman out there for him. Not an exciting thought but it happens and if you talk about it so there will be no guilt when or if you die. But it's a personal decision. The thing is you would never know if he remarried or not as you would be dead.|`|400ebcb595e3169f1f5ef987c872bdb1aa	Remarrying is always a good option.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	I understand your wanting to be the only love in his life.  I would like my husband to be so distraught with my loss that he would think of no other than me for the first couple years atleast lol but I love him so much I wouldn't want him to be sad forever and would want him to find love again, as much as that pains me to think of it.<br>  <br>  I know I would like to remarry if my husband met an early end, even though I would miss him until the day I died.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	This will sound odd, but if I died while my son was still at home, I would not want another woman to come into the house and confuse or upset him.<br>  <br>  But if my son was grown-up, or in college, I would want my husband to find someone who makes him happy.<br>  <br>  Too specific?  My 23-year-old butt needs to write a will!|`|dYGnVjjoaa	No.<br>  Cause i would not want my loved one to suffer for the rest of her life.<br>  She would need to move and with her life and live it to the fullest.<br>  If she gets married sure, it is whatever makes her happy which is what i would have wanted.|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	My  husband  and  I  have  teased  each other  about  that  many  times.  As  long  as  the  kids  approve  no  problem.  But  he  would  really  have  to  make  a  impression  on  me  from  all Ive  learned  on  how  to  live  with  a  man.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I think it depends hugely on the person and what they are feeling. Personally, I don't think I ever could remarry after that. But some people are different. And who knows what God has planned.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	I think if that happened to me i would like my hubby to be able to move on, nto straight away but a good few years +, i would still want him to be happy|`|g2JqGIOCaa	I wouldn't know anyway, I'd be dead.|`|Dk5OY5cZaa	Remarry yes!!! but if she thinks she will be a mommy to my son i would be very mad!!!
j0G4Zz0Yaa	its a great idea guys come and go but a good friend is worth keeping around.. just have patience with him..i bet it will work out just fine..i hope so at least ;)|`|FnGebaOLaa	Just call him, and invite him over, and tell him what's up!<br>  You just want to be friends, and you would like to keep it that way!
Mucx0snAaa	You should look at this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/expertanswer/alternatives-to-divorce-2/what-are-the-advantages-of-a-trial-separation" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/expertanswer/alt...</a><br>  <br>  And yeah getting put in a flat fells prtty s**** compared to living in a house with your girlfriend/spouse|`|AA10494978	OK, first of all, regardless of what you or your partner feel... you are ADULTS.  You have children.  Until such time as your children all are adults, you have a responsability to care for them.,  That means, you guys put aside your bickering, or whatever the issues are, and you keep your eyes on your kids.  They didn't ask for the situation.  You put them there.<br>  <br>  I understand you feel lonely and helpless.  I really do.  But you have to be a grown up.  Do whatever it takes to not put those kids through hell.  Separation, or divorce, even under the best of circumstances, will cause some emotional scaring for kids.  Children need a mommy and a daddy.  So, please, do your kids a favor, and ask your partner to go through a counseling session or two and see if you guys can work out your problems.  OK?  Good luck with everything.  You have to stay strong for your kids sake.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I'm not exactly sure what the problem is if you don't argue?? and there is no-one else involved.<br>  <br>  I was 13 and my brothers were 15 and 16 when my mum left, and it has affected my entire life.<br>  <br>  I don't want to say how awful it's been as I don't know your full circumstances, but if at all possible, do reconsider for the children.<br>  <br>  Having said that, my parents did not go through the courts at all for access. As long as both sides are happy I don't think there's a need to. Although I would have actually preferred this, as I wanted to go with my mum.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You are in an emotional state but please be assured that you are doing everything right.  your trial separation sounds like a permanent break so I'm not sure why you are kidding yourself.  Your partner is already resigned to the fact and that is why he has squirrelled away all the money.  He is obliged to financially support his children.  If you are not on benefits you can simply make your own arrangements.  But if you are or are going to be this will have to be arranged through the relevant agencies.  Don't consider what it will be like for him in a one bedroom flat, you have the greatest challenge by far.|`|Zca1PGERaa	I think you have to think very carefully about this do you really need to move you and the kids out it unfair on them and will be extremely stressful wheres your partner going to live in the same house your in now? wont that cause even more stress financially?<br>  <br>  I know you feel like running away but youve survived together this long with the kids money usual stuff it isnt easy and all couples go through hard times. It sounds as if what you two need to do is try and get some time together as a couple to talk
erGOrzEiaa	Some girls might take issue with it just on instinct but good close friends ought to be able to be open about that sort of thing and talk about it. On the other hand if she says she doesn't return those feelings or doesn't want a relationship you need to respect that and move on and keep treating them as just a friend and nothing else. Otherwise you WILL creep them out and push them away. It might take some hardship but if you act mature about it and respect them and their choices no matter what and they are a good friend and will respect you as well for being open and honest. Might cause some weirdness for a bit but openness and honesty is key.<br>  <br>  Don't expect anything except maybe rejection. She will be awkwarded out by it. The important part about this is not finding out if she returns those feelings. The important part is being honest in your friendships. If good comes from it great, but don't get your hopes up too much or it will just make it harder to move on back to friendship later on.|`|lvOR401haa	See my answer in the other posting of this question :-)|`|lKXtfYFxaa	Most of the time unfortunately no.  It can make the situation awkward especially since she told you she didn't have romantic feelings for you.<br>  <br>  But if there's that voice that tells you to take a chance then you never know what my transpire.  It'll gnaw at you until you act on it.  Best of luck.|`|uiDJlhy5aa	Sorry, but you're already in the friend's zone which is epically hard to get out of. You definitely don't want her to force herself into liking you because it wouldn't be fair to you.<br>  In a future sense, I wouldn't give up hope though because you never know where life will lead you. Maybe you will feeling this way will pay off in the future.|`|tRrzHOCRaa	absolutely not!!!if she told you you are like a brother ....well would you date your sister,probabaly not, right!! so i think she made it clear that she doesnt want to date you.and she probably felt your attraction to her which is why she told you that!!! sorry but get a clue bud!|`|C8sXrKnpaa	Tell her what you feel. I think that would not ruin your friendship with her, or brings awkwardness. Tell here that being in love with is another level of your friendship, or another high step of the friendship.
tcFg1gWjaa	Been there done that, if he has to consume drugs to talk to RUN as fast as you can. If and when he does stop the drinking, he will have no personality whatsoever. He cant deal with communication, and the older he gets the worse it will get.  How do feel about being with a man who has to drink to get close to you, its an insult ...RUN!!!|`|uclZT4Enaa	I will tell you what I would do...<br>  <br>  I would get him when he is sober/not high... (I don't know if this is something that happens often or just every now and then) and talk to him and tell him how you feel. That it's not fair for him to shut you out when he's sober and then be all nicey nicey when he's drunk...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|uDl5lUtdaa	Sounds like he's got some sort of social-anxiety.|`|4bAZW3F6aa	you might wana leave the guy, he is not interested in you when he is himself
XmJZkFuMaa	Any embarrassing stories about him as a kid or how you didn't think he'd survive to see 21?  Could work.  Otherwise, just telling him all the qualities that you're proud to see in a brother that he has.  It's great to joke a little, but then just tell him how he makes you feel as a sister and how happy you are to have him as a brother.  And then follow up with something like "But remember, if you throw up I'm not cleaning it up."
7X9VKElxaa	Just talk to her - ask her if she's alright or if anything is bothering her. If says that she's fine...she probably believes it. I don't know anything about your friend so I can't try to analyze her behaviors, but I will tell you something I've learned from experience. A person will never change   unless they genuinely want to for themselves - and that you can't help someone who doesn't want it. It doesn't sound to me like your friend is aware of her self esteem issues, and if you try and point them out to her she will most likely be offended. Just be there for her as her friend and make it known to her that your door is always open if she ever needs you. She will come to you if/when she ever gets to the point where she acknowledges that something is wrong and has the desire to fix it. Until then, trying to help her might just result in problems between the two of you. Best of luck!|`|2hDlR3Flaa	compliment her a lot? but it could just be tht she wants attention
Ss4kzYCYaa	I'm a girl and I don't kiss girls... :P<br>  but my boyfriend has fuller lips and it's nice! I have nothing to compare to though. He's the only guy I've kissed for the past 2 years. lol!|`|IIpEaDCcaa	I don't think they really care much.<br>  <br>  So that lip plumping lip gloss is just gonna be a waste of money :)|`|XS3PexPIaa	Of course. What would you rather have?|`|GPZuYCyCaa	I have exetremnely large full lips and I only kissed one guy (I'm 13, and I don't go around kissing guys tbh) but he said my lips were amazing to kiss because they were so full :)|`|g1xY5l2Gaa	Plumpier sounds way more satisfying|`|WfUMOPyhaa	plump.|`|zbl29wXSaa	I have plump lips :)<br>  <br>  If only I had someone to kiss, LOL.|`|2fyVDaguaa	no they just want a girl
y0GOP487aa	Frame it (if your artistic, paint to look rally nice) then wrap it in tissue paper (since your giving it to her at a mall). Hope this helps.|`|9QF6GGyiaa	I would frame it for her and put the frame back in it's box. That way when she opens the box she'll be ten times more surprised.  By the way your f****n  awesome for getting her that pic.|`|5372aOmFaa	who the hell is that?
YlFZFYA8aa	its only a big deal if you make it seem that way! dont dwell on it or bring it up and i swear to you, no one else will either. it was an honest and HARMLESS mistake and its no big deal. let it go hunny!! youre fine. i doubt anyone will care that much. it might seem like a huge embarrassing thing to you, but its so insignificant in everyone elses mind, just imagine all the embarrassing stupid mistakes they have made. not a big deal at all! :) let it go|`|VjgIeIMgaa	hey thats an honest mistake. if u'r going to feel that embarressed about it then u can just smile, laugh and just shrug it off cause everyone does that once in a while. the brother is just a jerk dont worry about it u'r friends probably wont even care that u did that.|`|zQheOHReaa	it's no big deal, people make mistakes all the time. just laugh it off.|`|35u9RVVFaa	honest mistake. just forget about it. if ur friend confronts you, just laugh and say oops!|`|JV0i77uiaa	Just wait to see what happen.  Don't worry about.|`|JZkCVHJAaa	its not that big of a deal and honestly few years down the road you'll look back and laugh it off and think why did i even bother
hHIFCgbTaa	I'm sure you hear it all the time, but just be yourself. If it's hip hop that your good at then let people know that's who you are. A great confident dancer. Showing people your talent is a great conversation starter. Make sure you stay a part of the conversations. As time goes on you will feel more and more confident to talk to people. And the whole "whenever I'm around awkward situations start" is probably in your head. If they stop talking then you start. If your nice then people will like you, it's that easy.<br>  <br>  Also I've found it helps to have something in your hand when your at a party where you don't know many people. It gives you something to do so your hands aren't awkwardly free.|`|MgbyFdQEaa	I don't think some people understand how hard it is to feel trapped in you're own body when you're shy, sometimes. I mean there are up sides and downsides to being shy. An up side is, it is very cute and allot of guy love shy girls just because they project innocence. And the down side is when it comes down to social setting and things of that nature it is really hard to express you're self without feeling like a total dumb blank sometimes. I understand it because I went through the same thing until I hit 20. But what I did to forget about being shy was I coached myself to change my thinking. maybe my experience will help you figure something out for you're self. Ok so what I did was insted of sitting there and just thinking to my self if I say something now will I feel dumb, I want to add to the conversation but I don't want to look think a dumb blank in this conversation. Instead all of that. I looked at my behavior and I relized ways I could inprove my thinking. so what I dig was prep my self for the conversation. think of some funny stories I could bring up maybe some current events maybe a deginer anything that I thought could make a conversation. here is the thing about people that I wanna let you know. if people are around you that means they don't wanna be alone because if they wanted that they would be alone in there room with the door locked. So when you hang out with some one they want to have human contact and even if you do say something a little dumb to start a conversation, it's very relieving to other people because they realize you acknowledge then and you're putting in effort so 10 to 1 when you start a open conversation like say you start a conversation with " did you hear about that teacher in are school I herd she had a face lift but I bet it's a rumor" Something open that people can feed off of. Then another person will eccnoled that and add on to it like "yeah I herd allot of people are doing that now. God if I was a star I would always do that. and the more people feed to the conversation the easier it gets to condemnate in it. Do you kind of understand. just use that feeling of pride and confidence you have and dancing and walk into the room with that feeling and do everything I just said and believe me you will learn how to bead shyness|`|eF92uM2Saa	It's said a man finds the woman who listens the most interesting. Complements, if they sound sincere, can help start a conversation.<br>  <br>  You can always start out a conversation with a little off hand remark about something you had trouble with during the day or some small accomplishment.  If you mention a  trouble around a guy expect him to try to solve the problem for you, because he will think you are asking his advice.<br>  <br>  BTW, giving men little problems to solve for you is a great way to let them feel good about themselves.|`|se7c5zzcaa	It gets better when you gain independence. I was super quiet and shy and as soon as I got my license, finished HS, have a job, buy nice things, it just comes together.|`|DoYQeqGhaa	i'm like that too, i never know what to talk about<br>  <br>  the obvious topics are always holidays, school/work, weekends and books and movies|`|xV5Bsh0Jaa	don't think too much. relax. just be yourself. and talk and laugh
tsNMMLMUaa	Love is a checklist in your head of things that attract you. This could range from looks, to interests, to birthdays, or pretty much anything you have in common, or opposite to them. The main idea is that every person you meet, will usually connect with one ore more of those list items, and so you can develop a friendly relationship, but when someone comes along who seems to hit all or most of the list items, you find yourself strangely attracted to them. <br>  <br>  Of course this list is mostly subconscious, so when you do find that special someone, there is a wierd feeling inside of you, as if your soul craves them in order to be whole. And when that person is not near you, you feel empty.<br>  <br>  The truth is, many people believe that desire is your spirit telling you you are soulmates destined to be together, but it is up to you to truly decide that.<br>  <br>  But that is just the bit of psychology I looked into a while back. <br>  For the most part, I strongly agree with the entire "list" idea, but I think it is referring to simple attraction, which is usually a physical desire, whether you want to admit it or not.<br>  <br>  To me, when my girl says a certain thing, or does a certain thing in a certain way, my entire body gets a warm numbing sensation that cannot be described easily. I know it is not a pysichal desire, because my girlfriend is gorgeous and I barely ever think about sex.<br>  <br>  That is the sign telling me this is true love.<br>  <br>  <br>  True love is TRUST, and ACCEPTANCE!|`|7fQLO6gZaa	The feeling you get when the most special person in your life touches you in the smoothest and slightest way. The feeling of longing for their voice when your in a loud crowd, or in complete silence. The emotional roller coaster that always comes out in tears, kisses, hugs, and promises of eternal togetherness. The feeling that when you are down and sad or hurt, the one name you constantly say is your significant other, and you only notice once they come to your rescue. The never ending burning feeling for that person's heart to be yours forever. The way that when they leave you never want them to say goodbye. There is so much more that could be said to "define" love, but the best word to describe it is, "indescribable."|`|mndLFdnFaa	It is where you will care for someone unconditionally<br>  There's this one quote that I love and it goes something like this:<br>  "Conditional love is corrupt love"<br>  Looking back on my life, that quote really proved itself to me.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Someone you can trust and cant wait to come home to every day and only need that person no matter what|`|HGl8ddWjaa	Love: spelled L-O-V-E and some times L-U-V<br>  <br>  When the two people have feelings for each other and cares about each other<br>  <br>  (mine)|`|LHJTrJreaa	My personal opinion is that its bullsh*t...<br>  <br>  But thats only because most of the people i know and myself have never made it work....|`|QI36SaLhaa	A feeling you have toward someone who you really care about, means a lot to you and you will do almost anything for them|`|beTBfCkTaa	i dont think it can be defined, just felt|`|AA10094964	Love is such a wonderful feeling.. love is when you start thinking of that person above you, you do and give everything to make that person happy, you take risks and sacrifice everything just for the sake of hoding on... you never give up the fight even if it means you need to let go.. you dont listen to what peple have to say whether its a criticism or not, you only have your mind on that person. you'd rather spend your time looking and watching that person instead of shopping or watching your favorite sports t.v.. you're always there making time even for just a few moments just to say you love that person. you're there to reach out even if that person shut you out or slammed the door in your face. you want to make that person your life. you never complain about the things that person doesnt have and instead you love exactly what that person is, you appreciate every little things with that person... i guess love is not all about objectives here, its a mutual feeling that even when you're both apart from each other, you're heart speaks.. Love is when you understand each other's strengths and weaknesses.... Love is everything... Love is a gift. Love is a dream but can be your worst nightmare....|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	Love is a stupid feeling ppl get, that tends to make them forget about logic & reasoning abilites, thats love|`|rZhUcLFmaa	When your happiness is contingent on someone else's.|`|aRUEXTTtaa	When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin.

H9Bzw0VNaa	Honestly, relax don't worry about it.  My friend is gorgeous, considered the hottest chick in school.  She's 18, never had a boyfriend, or even a first kiss.  I guess all comes in due time.  I'm sure when the right guy comes along you'll have a wonderful relationship, and he'll appreciate the fact that you havent been "used".  Don't worry about it :)|`|D1L8Ficgaa	I dunno its weird sometimes.<br>  i dunno how rude this is, but do you have a picture?<br>  Then I could be really honest.|`|8i7AEWRCaa	well its not about being ugly and beauty<br>  maybe you r not in a good situation. i mean if you have lots of boys around and none of them has a crush on you somethings wrong but if not then its normal. this not important having a bf i mean. like: if u dont have a bf u r ugly. we all have seen lots ofugly gurls with hot guys, if u really care u must be what they want and its bad, cause its not u anymore. give it time ull find some1 who likes u 4 u and he wud be happy that he is your 1st bf|`|To85W1Rgaa	be yourself. you don't want someone who likes you for being not you. talk to them about things they would actually be interested in. ask them questions. smile at them and compliment them. the little things like these matter.<br>  good luck!
qTpFyTXCaa	Well you got played.  I don't know that you can salvage anything with her, but I think if you search your heart you know it isn't the kids fault.  One is your child, but the other is a child that has come to love and trust you.  Please please please don't take this the wrong way because I ultimately feel she is in the wrong, BUT, you know where babies come from.  True you thought you could trust her, but even with birth control there is a chance, and now you need to step up.  Let's face it, with a mom like that, both of those children need someone stable in their lives.  It is a lousy hand you got dealt, but speaking as a parent, it is also a wonderful thing.  Take some time to wrap your head around it and then do the right thing by the CHILDREN...she is a big girl and needs to step up to her responsibility as well.
L6n2hy7Uaa	I think the day you got your divorce was the first day of the rest of life.<br>  New year new start new you, its all about you now, time to pick yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again, let his mistake be your beefsteak.<br>  divorce is emotionally draining enough, informing you of his new partner maybe his way of draining you a little more, after 10 years i am sure he knows how to pull your strings, if he was truly your friend he would realise sending that email would not be a good thing, regardless of what he says it is clear HE is hurting, otherwise he would have kept his new found affair to himself, especially as she is, as you put it "an old friend". unfortunately some of us divorce but find it difficult to let go, i think he has a bruised ego. my advise "take time out to rebuild your life", he is yesterday's newspaper.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi yaki, if I were you, I wouldn't care less of anything that had been '' SETTLE ''<br>  likewise, I will be looking forward to spend my time wisely to concentrate on<br>  getting a better husband this time around.<br>  So, enjoy and embrace your new life and ride it high on baby, OK ?|`|qWqg7vFJaa	I would wonder why he saw fit to tell you..After all you have moved on and the marriage is over too..<br>  Were you really interested when he told you .?<br>  Thought not..|`|JH6oCuUZaa	So your ex is dating an old friend and I dont see why that bothers you...thats the question you should be asking.|`|AA10494978	Sorry to hear that...<br>  <br>  Dealing with a divorce is never easy.  Even if it ended on really bad terms and infidelity or other emotional (or sometimes physical) abuse was involved.  You have to give yourself time to get used to being single and unfortunately it is not as easy as "get over it".  <br>  <br>  I imagine you probably feel betrayed right now, perhaps rightly so, but you will have to deal with it as best as you can right now.  I would suggest talking to someone in confidence about it.  There are TRAINED therapists, who specialise in after divorce counseling.  You should consider a few sessions.  NOT because of any other reason, sometimes it helps to talk things out with someone.  Check with your health insurance provider.  Most will pay for 6 sessions outright and up to 12 sessions at 60%.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everythying and don't worry, what you are feeling is perfectly normal.  You have to have time to get over a divorce.  Give yourself a break.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	I think that you should take a deep breath and be happy that your divorce is final.  I'm sure it was a terrible ordeal to go through.<br>  <br>  NOW, you can move forward in life... and that doesn't include worrying about who your ex is dating.  That's all in the past now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	Your Ex has been cheating on you even when you were married to him. be happy that you are divorcing him he was not faithfull in your marriage, do not worry you will find a faithfull man.|`|dbI7JFCDaa	Hw was mostlikley seeing her befor you two stoped seeing each other.|`|0ETcnOeiaa	Hey just get out there spend a bit of dosh on hair clothes etc. & front up to him with your new beau. hey have fun now put 10 yrs behind you|`|H8nzOzhvaa	i think he was dating her before the two weeks|`|y6HmMl9naa	TWO weeks Don't think so !!!!!

The marriage was obviously finished with.....<br>  <br>  (Said with a smile) you may just be feeling a bit of hurt pride.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I wonder if "pimps" the counselor jumps to conclusions like this in his/her job? Where does it say that the ex was cheating during the marriage????|`|wgZVeLZPaa	Oh, believe me. It makes me feel weird when my ex tells me about girls he's dating. In fact, I went over to get some pictures and her coat was hanging on a hanger in the living room. <br>  It was hard to see that, and we were married 10 years too. I felt those feelings of jealousy and stuff, though. Although our marriage was over, it was still weird to think of him moving on.<br>  <br>  This shall pass. My ex and I still talk. I think we'll always be friends. Perhaps your ex is trying to get your attention by dating one of your friends. I don't know. But let it go. You'll feel better.<br>  <br>  That and you have to. :)

qaMrAspCaa	between the two that you showed i would go with the first, because the second looks too much like a wedding ring/band set.

However, if she doesn't have an actual wedding set, maybe I would go with #2.  They are both really pretty though.|`|4GCjraB7aa	this is just an opinion that i have heard many girls say, but girls like the original wedding ring better, because it is what they really got married with. They would rather keep that one and save the money you would spend on the ring to do something important with, like buy a new roof or get something fixed around the house.|`|13zAj7u5aa	i'd go with #2. its a better cut and clarity. plus, you get the set all in one and thats less money you'll have to spend when it comes to the wedding.|`|AxGMFMHJaa	according to me the 1st one is very nice but just one think to tell the best thing to give to our wife is our love .time n promises of being with her always i think|`|UWrI4iOMaa	no. #2|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	You are fortunate to be able to afford such an extravagance in today's economy.  The second ring set is a wedding set but you are already married.  The first ring looks like an engagement ring.  I do have one thing to say...in this economy, $2,000+ is a lot of money and getting someone used to big ticket items could backfire in the future. Sure you love her but save for a rainy day. Buy a house and save for retirement or for future children. There are two links below that may help you decide on a gift based on traditional ideas. Good luck..|`|VjMyHAWraa	The one april d said is my choice also! Reason being that the other two rings you chose have several small diamonds to equal 1 ct or 7/8 ct.

yDVlTUYTaa	If your mother is lucid enough to understand the deteriorating effect of her illness, ask her to go in to see a lawyer with you or your brother now, while she is still lucid, and let her be in on the decisions as to how far into the illness she feels she should be before conservatorship is given, who she would like to entrust with this, and what their specific responsibilities would be.  This will enable her to feel more in control in the decisions and help the family handle it in a way they know she would want. She can also make clear what she doesn't want-perhaps full financial control by one person, full time care by family members, or "Do not resuscitate/ living will" decisions. Having a lawyer there who specializes in this type of thing will provide some much needed expertise and a cool head to bounce things off. And hopefully your mother will feel she still has some say about her future, even as she begins to lose her past.|`|Eug52iQDaa	It might be premature to request a conservatorship at this point.  Maybe your brother is anticipating.  At any rate, if your mother is able to take care of her finances and meds adequately, it won't be granted and will cause a lot of hard feelings.

HIs wife deserve better - poor thing.  He is the very reason why women do not trust men 100% - you never can.

oWheKC37aa	okay, so this is pretty serious. <br>  yes, it is possible but are your parents okay with it? did you tell them yet? do not do anything without your parents permission and if you and your boyfriend believe that you two can stay together, live together then thats good but not everything. marriage takes ALOT of things to work. you need a house..your "husband" needs to know how to do everything on his own even you.. like paying the bills..buying stuff..fixing stuff.. you know alot of things. and most importantly trust. im 18. i had to travel any leave my boyfriend. he actually wanted to marry me so we can stay together. but we had to face the fact that we're not ready at all. love is the base but its not enough. <br>  you have lots of things to think about you and our boy.<br>  and i hope you guys make the right decision. i know you dont need opinions..but i'd say wait a few years cause you might regret it. my cousin got married at 19 and she regrets it even though she's happy. <br>  anyway its your life. your choice. just be sure you're doing whats right and seriously think about it. and if he really reallyyy loves you. if you told him to wait. he will<br>  good luck and sorry its too long.|`|iq1EgWkdaa	I think that you're going to have to wait till you're 18.

You can promise each other that you will get married, get a ring, make a covenant with each other, etc.  <br>  <br>  But you would also promise each other that you will both finish high school - and support each other through that ordeal - and commit to finding good jobs and considering college as well.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it could really be a beautiful thing.  And quite frankly, if you can prove that you can stay together through high school... well, you might just make it together for the rest of your lifetime.<br>  <br>  Plus... and maybe this sounds silly... but I would be so embarrassed to have my parents sign a consent form for me to get married.  *I* would want to be the person who signed my marriage license.  I would want that to be MY signature, agreeing "for better or for worse".|`|7RbootLlaa	I'm not sure about America, but I think it is possible to marry at 16, but only in certain special circumstances and a judges approval. They look into the situation, but don't think falling pregnant is special circumstances, it isn't. If you were dying, yes. <br>  <br>  There is an alternative, but I can not remember off hand - Kindred Spirits? Sorry can't remember.<br>  <br>  If you were to get on a plane to New Zealand, you could get legally married at 16. Both of you.|`|dxMQAdndaa	Legally, you will have to have your parents sign a consent form until you turn 18.
JV0i77uiaa	If  I would  punch all the people's faces for complaining there would be a lot of people walking with the swollen face.  When they come to complaint tell them to seek help with the psychologist, they got pay for listening but you don't.

CgaQHgZLaa	Helloo =)<br>  <br>  Well, I was in the same situation a while ago now, so Id like to think I can help you out here! <br>  <br>  I was with my ex for a year and a half.. just like yourself! Our break up took me by suprise as we spent alot of time together and alot of work went into our relationship.. anyhow he broke up with me.. with a lame excuse saying that we was both to young to be commited in such a relationship.. even though there was no faults or nothing everything was PERFECT! he cried, i cried.. we met up a couple of times said goodbye.. and god that was soo hard!!! It hurt more because he'd helped me out alot, when my nan passed away.. he was there etc! We met eachothers family, aunts, uncles etc... we got on great! All i can say now is it's been a while but you never truely get over them... first love and all that.. but things will get better i can 100% say that.. and as for him saying he misses you etc.. then his just being selfish, and he cant see how much his hurting you.. you need to tell him babe! Break all ties you have( i know this is hard) but have a little trust in yourself... and after a while you'll realise yeah we had a good thing and that but if he really did love me and stuff.. we would still be together!!! its as simple as that easy to say though i know... be strong you'll get through it hun!

But as you get older and maybe have kids, forget about it.  I see my sister sometimes  (with 2 older kids)  and ask her to put on the braw.  Not many men are turned on by those ingenious topless ladies in tribes with those hanging breasts.  Yak.  Even if it was in the house with your husband I wouldn't recommend it.  Sometimes women wonder why their husbands/boyfriends lose that initial lust they had sometime ago.  Well, we understand you age like us and go through changes in life, but you don't have to stop taking care of yourself and look as beautiful as you can, for yourselves and us, the men who love you.

Just get me out of Minnesota..  ahhhh!|`|aZl2rksuaa	it would be awkward for my whole family coz we're gay, but i think it would be alright with kids even if adopted and 20 years is a fair enough time to wait to get married. but i wouldnt get married if i was the woman and had the baby and had to look after it when the father isn't working somewhere where he gets less than $12,000 a year, and we would live somewhere small, two rooms, bathroom, and kitchen. a job that my partner would need to get would be something like full time at a restaurant, or something of the like. So, it seems like a fair idea to get married to the guy im crushing on right now, but if you don't have enough money, buy things for the baby before having the baby then have the baby later on so you can raise the child correctly, and also make sure you work on the relationship to keep it strong and fresh. All relationships need to be kept strong, interesting and fresh, by working on the relationship. So unless you don't think you can work hard enough on a relationship, it would be best not to get married unless your prepared to work hard for love, for all good things in life aren't always the easiest to get.|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	we had like 3 or 4 kids they'd be soo cute and bad as hell and he'd still be smoking weed we'd have a house tho finish college and idk wat he wants to be but we wouldn't necessarily be rich or anything idk marriage is a stretch i dnt lik his *** THAT much to be daydreaming bout marriage yet|`|LHJTrJreaa	Well he is a pothead so i doubt that would change.

You can push them together when you are both "awake," and spread them out when you go to sleep. <br>  <br>  Also, consider having him do a sleep study. They might be able to help fix the problem permanently.|`|xlJGeYmRaa	he is doin that because he has suppressed a lot of emotions inside his mind. try to make him talk and reduce the stress on his mind. and make him feel that you love him so much and he ll surely open out. and please be sure to hear anything he say about and dont dump him for his past. if you really love him|`|ise05jjUaa	There's nothing you really can do yourself, unless you sleep in a separate bed that's about it.

Usually something like this is repressed memory that the brain tries to work out while asleep.  In the meantime, as bad as it sounds, you may want to consider separate beds. People who have problems unknowingly hurt their loved ones without even realizing it.  I have worked with someone a few years ago who had been through some very very traumatic experiences over 30 years before, and it just emerged one night.  Scared the daylights out of his poor wife.   <br>  <br>  Ask him (although it sounds like he is ready to work on it) to seek some help immediately.  I mean talk to a TRAINED therapist ASAP.

Your bf has some serious subconscience problems.  He needs to get help.  In the meantime, fall asleep with him, but then move to the couch or something.  Normally these night fits don't last all night.  <br>  <br>  Get a video camera and video tape sleeping.  It might not happen every night or the first night, but it is violent and now he is hurting puppies.  Get a camera - and enough tape to record your sleeping habits.  When he sees what he is doing, he hopefully will be the one picking up the phone to get help.<br>  <br>  Wear a helmet and put the doggy on your side.|`|HQp1MGgvaa	he may be having night terrors. <br>  <br>  I had a boyfriend that would do the same thing. I always got elbowed in the temple. What I would do is take a body pillow and place it in between him and I so if he thrashed around he would hit the pillow not me.The only bad thing about that is, is that you have to kinda lay on your side and not really move. A $20 pillow is better then bruises any day.<br>  <br>  Maybe he should go to his family doctor and discuss this with them. He may only need a relaxer to take a bed time.  I would do that asap, so no one else gets hurt.|`|vb6nB7ANaa	Fist of all what I would do is move into the spare room or get one of those beds for the floor let him sleep on that for awhile and then go see someone about it he really needs to go get some professional help if he cares for you in any way he will whats the point in getting so mad about it thats not going to solve anything go see someone and see whats going on.<br>  Take care|`|eVF7mhE9aa	Strange case...maybe you could just cuddle with him until he falls asleep and place a body pillow (or two) between the two of you.

And would it be a good environment?<br>  <br>  Now that doesn't mean you don't put your foot down and say "These are the rules of the house."  But... just something to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  My mom also had one daughter who she allowed to move in with neighbors, and it was the worst thing she ever did.  Personally, I would be tempted to tell the mother that if he doesn't come home then you're filing kidnapping charges.  <br>  <br>  But keep in mind that he's 17.  Their brains are screwy (see link, it's a frontline program about the teenage brain.)  Keep communications open, maybe get some family counseling.  In a year he's going to be 18, you don't want to burn bridges so that you don't have a relationship with him at all.  Looking up resources in conflict management and even finding support groups for parents of teens may help.|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Well, It seems to me you gave him an ultimatum in grounding him. You said: your behavior around here must change, grades come up, you help around the house, and treat us respectfully.<br>  His response was to move out. At 17 that's not a totally unexpected response. He is almost grown and in another year will be out on his own anyway.<br>  I think the first thing you need to do is to take the Dad out of the picture. This is an issue between you and your son and concerning your house rules. It's not about how often he visits his Dad. Or about how he uses each of you to manipulate the other. Save that argument for another time.<br>  For now, let your son know that you're disappointed with him for choosing to leave instead of working within the boundaries you gave him. Then let him know that as he is 17 you will abide by his decision to leave as long as he understands the consequences and is prepared to accept them.<br>  1. You will in no way be supporting him- That includes lodging, food, car, car insurance, medical insurance, etc.<br>  2. He will not be invited back into the house to visit until he apologizes for his bad attitudes and actions.<br>  3. He will not be moving back in unless he does so intending to finish his grounding and only after bringing proof that his grades are up and showing the proper respect to you and his step dad.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, empty out his room, including any dirty laundry, and deliver it to his "new family's" house.<br>  <br>  It's time for a  little tough love. And if it seems hard, it is. But having your kids understand that their decisions have consequences is half the battle to winning their respect and in the long run their heart.|`|AA11227341	unless your ex supports you and the rules you have set this young man will always have a way out so call your husband and tell him to support your rules and that he should not try to be the good guy while you are seen as the bad one for the rules.  Sadly, your son has issues to where he thinks he can do whatever he likes which will only led him to get in to worse situations so stand your ground and do what you must.  Go visit the friend's mom and talk no arguments but nice talk that she should not allow your son to stay with them(another way our for your son) He will soon be 18 and then he will decide the path he will take and in this he will become what he wants sadly, you will have to se him become a good man or a guy that will be headed for trouble.  <br>  You can go and see a therapist so he or she can speak with your son so that any issues your son might have or is enduring will be assessed (he might be acting out---failing, wanting to be defiant for some reason which should be assessed; he might be getting "pushed" around at school which makes him feel like a lost kid and is not open enough with you to tell you what is going on with him at school)  but your son  should go and open up to the therapist.  <br>  Peace to you.|`|EnSJnaHEaa	Blessed be the name of the LORD, Dear sister I kind of went throught the same thing when my son Darren was 17, about two months before he turned 18 he left home because we were too strict, all we wanted is for him to go to school and get an education, a job and do what is right, I had to let him go. He was angry with me and wouldn't talk to me for over 2 years my heart was utterly broken.. I would cry to God, I fasted and prayed for those long hard years, my husband was angry with him, it was a big heart ache for me. My burden was so strong all I could do is worry and cry. The Lord put it in my heart about the lost son.. how he was lost and then came home, he was found again. I finally let go and gave my burden to God I could bare it no more, and the Lord took it away, He told me He had and still has Darren in his hands, Darren finally came home and when he did he apologized to me and told me how he had missed me and that he loves me, God has even mended the relationship with him and my Husband (step dad who raised him) Darren is now 22 and on his own he still isn't ready to do the will of God and he can no longer live in my home until he is ready to give His life to God... I have no doubt he will soon, so my dear sister let him go and put him in the hands of our Wonderful God you did the best you could now it is time to fast and pray for your son... he will be back... God Bless you. my heart goes out to you. I now have another son who is Lost that is a whole new story.|`|by9XVFsmaa	your not a bad mother and you havent failed as a mother!<br>  boys will be boys and having his father not living there makes him think its okay to act like an idiot and play you both off on each other. i would try and talk to his father so you can have a united front in punishing him. and maybe get his step dad more involved.<br>  <br>  I know i was a horrible child and my mum kicked me out alot and i would always come crawling back because i had nowhere to stay anymore becuase my boyfriend had dumped me.<br>  <br>  i suggest saying to him "i'm you mother and i love you and im trying to do what\s best for you and one day you will understand that. and say he can stay at his friends house but he will ALWAYS be welcome home" so when it goes to **** which im sure it will he will know he has a safe haven to come back to.<br>  <br>  kids now a days are so horrible to their parents and the world just isnt getting any better. maybe talk to your local police or counseller and see what you can do as he is still under the age of 18 and still in your care.<br>  <br>  please dont beat yourself up, its not your fault... you can do anythign and everything the right way but there will always be one tosser out there that ruins all your hard work.<br>  <br>  Good luck xoox|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Well, what do the divorce papers/parenting plan say? <br>  I would tell his father that they need to be followed to the letter.<br>  <br>  If the papers say you have custody, then not only would I require him to come home, but he would be grounded until - he was 18 years old. <br>  <br>  Every child has some kind of reward that can be withdrawn from their lives.<br>  <br>  Like a cell phone, an i-pod, tv, computer, etc, etc... <br>  <br>  I would ground him from all of these things.<br>  <br>  I would also tell this friends mother - that if she does this crap again, you will call the police and report her as "harboring a runaway"... <br>  <br>  You have a lot of morons around you and little support.<br>  <br>  There is also always military school.<br>  <br>  If you choose to let your son stay at his father's house.<br>  <br>  I would not threaten him with him not going home. <br>  <br>  I would tell his father however, that he is there for good.  And not to bother calling you when s*&* hits the fan... <br>  <br>  Let your son find out the consequences of his behaivor when he makes that call to go home....|`|93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	You haven't failed as a mother because you care about him but he's pushing you to the point of running out of options. I would be upset that the friend's mom consented to him staying there but at least you know where he is staying. Also, his dad isn't backing you up on the fact that he's failing in school and just doing what he wants.<br>  <br>  However if he decides he wants to come back home, you need set some ground rules and if he doesn't want to follow them, then let him know he can go stay with his dad. <br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that eventually he'll be 18 soon so you need to start thinking about that also because legally you don't have to baby him anymore.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't respect you or your home now then he never will.|`|BgZu3Ndiaa	you seem very lenient, i bet you haven't beaten your son up like my parents do to me, and i'm only 15 well 16 today. <br>  they are very strict and i never see the daylight.<br>  i go to school and straight home and i have no cellphone ipod or anything like that. <br>  they tell me they will punish me if i don't do good in school and im afraid of them. you should tell your son he's lucky to have a parent who doesn't beat him up all the time AND im a GIRL.

qw7BmBq6aa	It does sound like he has a continued interest in you considering he stopped and listened.  Who knows if he still wanted to sleep with you, but its obvious he isn't thinking right because a good married man would pay no attention to you at all.<br>  <br>  I think you should stay away from him because you wouldn't want some tart sleeping with your husband if you were to marry now would you?  Women need to respect eachother more, because clearly most men are just dogs.|`|FzFSzilmaa	any man (and woman) in an "affair" are after sex... that is the main reason for the situation...<br>  <br>  if you are wanting to have sex with him, go for it... but if you aren't, then just move on with your life..|`|vDrTzGKzaa	He totally wants you. this happended to me about a 2 months ago, except i was actually pregnant|`|GqTSa85daa	Why should you care, forget him he's married so move on with your life.|`|IyjndvBgaa	He probably was surprised to here that you and your husband are having a baby because you were talking to him like you were interested in him.  He probably was confused. You need to stay away from him because he did get married to his GF.

AA10283901	It appears she is jealous of you for one reason or another.  This is not the kind of friend you need.<br>  <br>  It sounds like maybe she NEEDS a best friend.<br>  <br>  Instead of being flat out rude to her, just stay "busy" when (or if) she asks you to do something with her.   Eventually, she'll get the message that you don't want to be her friend.<br>  <br>  Talk to her, yes, (only at school) but keep your distance and don't give her any information you don't want repeated.  If she calls you at home, ask the answerer to tell her you're busy.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer wasn't too confusing.  What I'm saying is let her down easy, if you decide you don't want to talk to her anymore.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|AA11943438	How do you know your bf isnt lying? Boys are good at that.

XmJZkFuMaa	Honestly... I don't think you can tell her to be careful without insulting her sense of choosing her own friends.  Just be there for her.  When it falls apart, hug her and don't tell her "I told you so."  If she's becoming close friends with the girl, then remember that if you put the other girl down then Grace will defend her and that could put you in a bad position.<br>  <br>  If you see the girl put Grace down, stand up for Grace and say something like "Hey, that's not right, leave her alone."  I remember when a friend of mine did that for me from someone always treating me badly.  I couldn't speak up for myself, but it meant the world that someone else did, and it gave me the self confidence to stand up for myself later.  Grace needs to see that you don't approve of someone treating her like that.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and good job being a good friend.|`|5agXk9ldaa	yes talk to her all else you are not a good friend|`|tA7AE5HSaa	.....|`|7X9VKElxaa	I would talk to her about it, but only once. Don't argue with her about it. Just remind her of the reasons she told you before, about why she never wanted to be friends with this girl again. Ask her if getting back into this old friendship is really what she wants. If she doesn't want to listen to you - there's nothing you can do except step back and let her learn from her own mistakes. Trying to be too forceful about this will only push her away from you. If she does continue having a friendship with this other girl, and she does end up getting hurt again...please don't remind her that you warned her. Remember that everyone needs to make their own mistakes because that's how we learn the most. Just be her friend and let her know that you've always got her back.

I think that he still kind of has feelings for you since he sort of stares at you a bit but he doesn't want you to know so he acts all subtle.|`|jIzlX1rdaa	I'd agree with the fact that he likes you I mean I'm a typical teen and I occasionally stare at a girl I may like, but I don't know in your case whether he may have found out something from the past you'd rather forget, or maybe some [insert swear word here] made up a rumor but I know that when you find stuff out about a girl that is potentially bad it does put you off a little, some guys more than others.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you asked him out to get a drink or something but seen as you said not to I decided against it but if you like him you should<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|8ESkJYGsaa	he probably has some feelings for you but i have no idea why he would avoid you? sorry =/..but dont get led on if you like him! most likely he has/had some kind of feelings for you and thought he was being to obvious about it|`|WGHjb9tBaa	He likes you.

(we were dating, nothing physical with any of them)  One guy told me that it wasn't fair and that I needed to pick just one.

It may not have been the kindest answer, but the reality is, you like all 4 guys, but probably none of them will be "the one".  If they were, you'd be able to choose no problem.<br>  I do think that if you are physical with one, you've made a choice.

If he made fat jokes about me, I would be extremely hurt and ask him why he needs to ridicule me?  If he chooses to be with me, then he must accept me.. ALL of me.

If he was truly sensitive to your feelings he would not be commenting on your weight in hurtful ways.<br>  <br>  I think you need to tell him how much it actually did hurt you, because well he just may not know it wasn't funny in the least.  If he blows it off then you need to set him straight.  He may actually feel that way about you, so this might come out of his mouth as well when you have this conversation.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's worried about your health and doesn't know how to really tell you except in jokes?  5'7 and 170 pounds is a bit on the heavy side though, I'm 6 foot and 160.  If you don't want the fat jokes start hittin the gym ;)|`|OHfZFR31aa	Well, you can start joking about his pot belly, bald spot or other flaw that he has and see how he reacts.

It is scary when you don't expect it. He's just dreaming!

lvOR401haa	First - decide what you want.  Easy s*x or a relationship.  Depending on what you want will help find your target audience.  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of single women out there - you just have not found on you like yet!<br>  <br>  Perhaps join a team or group where you can meet girls with same interest (if you want to date them - I wouldn't try work your way through the girls in a club you're in or anything!).<br>  <br>  And also, girls are not property to be 'stolen' from their boyfriends hehehe!  I'd recommend not hitting on girls who are dating - they will probably be mad at you for not respecting their choice, or enjoy the attention and may do the same to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck - hope you find a nice girl soon|`|l4rFmqnAaa	Hop on myspace or facebook. add everyone in your area/school that's cute/hot & maybe send them a message. Easier to get one off of the internet than in person. If it's a campus I wouldn't try to 'steal' someones girlfriend. They may cause problems with you. lol|`|mRgRDhMQaa	same with guys. every guy I see that I'm attracted to or have an interest in is either taken or probably the least bit interested.|`|vDrTzGKzaa	Me being a straight, good-looking, and sane girl in college with a boyfriend just found out that half those girls you are talking about are bi-sexual. Yea, hate to break the news but leave two of them alone together and see what happens. <br>  Many of them have sworn on their life that they are not like that but once we are alone they try to put their filthy lips all on me. Just to make sure ask them if their boyfriend stay on campus. I bet he go to some school across the country or what not. Aint nothing wrong with you it is just the girls.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	There are plenty of good girls out there that are single that are thinking the same thing about men, so don't be talking crazy, no need for stealing, unless you're bigger than the girl's boyfriend.|`|AuWPMH44aa	u just arent looking at the rite girls. so get out there n go to some parties n find some ***** n talk to her and fu** her.|`|lZmf4KFdaa	I can tell you why you're not their boyfriend. ...because you're an idiot.  If a girl were to see what you just wrote that you just want to have sex with them and/or steal them from their boyfriend, that says it all about you....no character.  Who wants that?  only another stupid girl that doesn't know any better.|`|6DGLxJ1daa	Ditto Jen's response.<br>  <br>  Also - Some of those girls are in unhealthy relationships and don't know it, they're not as sane as you'd think...<br>  <br>  Plenty of fish in the sea, my friend.|`|f6c9bfbcb3fb45de44790bb21a61cc31aa	well, they probably have a boyfriend because they are "good looking, straight, and sane" and mostly because they are not unfaithfull.

ytGaDM7Haa	dude, I am an analyzer too, but I never realized that makes me sucseptable to becoming an obsessive stalker! I've never obsessively thought about a person (just things, lists, situations and the like) that's kind of scary.<br>  I would suggest keeping yourself busy and focusing on your work. You are not your mind, when it starts to wander over to the girl bring it back - it will wander again and you'll have to drag it back again and again and again. This won't be easy, but don't give up. You have to be the master of your mind, not the other way around. <br>  You know the saying "an idle mind is the devil's playground"? well you need to find something else to occupy your mind. That is why monks chant prayers and meditate on beads ... to give the mind something to focus on and the hands something to fiddle with so they aren't left to wander aimlessly just looking for trouble.
t3lDmZLXaa	There is a difference between 'Like' and 'Love'!So, instead tell him directly that you 'Love' him!!!But, before doing this just check if he is going out with any other girl.I think so because usually girls are not the one to express their feelings first.Boys are the one to express their feelings first.But, in your case, opposite is the case.So, instead of getting happy or asking questions like what, how, when,are you joking or serious,really and etc.(in reply to your "I like you" message), he just said "cool!".Other guy would not have believed it and would have rather got much-much happier and excited.<br>  <br>  But, his dull answer "cool!but sorry i have to go." creates a doubt in my mind that he is going out with someone else....<br>  <br>  Best Luck!|`|iq1EgWkdaa	If you still love him then you get him back. Also, he said "cool" so there's a chance that he still loves you too. Nuff said.
CQPvngCeaa	Are you sure he's picking on you? U need to look at this from different angles, because things usually aren't wad they seem. <br>  <br>  Maybe he's just lonely, because he doesn't have any real friends hu stick by him. It's like, he's been guided wrongly into thinking that being irritating is a way to get attention. Because, well, its obvious from his situation tat he doesn't have many POSITIVE frends. <br>  <br>  Or perhaps he just has a character flaw?<br>  <br>  (If You Are A Girl) Maybe he just LIKES YOU? XD<br>  <br>  Anyway don't mind him. It's not as if he is any more richer or good-looking compared to u. Just ignore him. I dun think he can actually affect you in any way. He'll switch target after a while. Just try to swallow it down and b cool with it. <br>  <br>  (Of course, you can still curse him under your breath! XD)|`|aO5ErghMaa	Actually. I think you should knock em out for a message about that. If no one likes him hes probably an ***-face. He's gonna get jumped sooner or later. Lol Kick his *** for saying he was gonna kill you. Just ruff him up a little bit. You don't have too. But telling him off wont do crap. Hes just gonna bother people for a while. But you don't let people say crap like that. Even if they are playing. Its just not funny to screw around with people like that. If he does that to everyone maybe you could wait a week and let it pass. He just wants to target you for a while. But if it escalates your gonna have to kick his ***.

Its like you said..you have been seperated for ten yrs. Thats more than long enough if you ask me!|`|ksqIYFQUaa	'various kinds of contact'? Doesn't sound like you actually know him 'in person'. You should learn from your first marriage and be sure you love the man and know him inside out. Live together first and make sure you can spend the rest of your life with him. Marriage is meant to be for life not just because you like the sound of someone!|`|RmhaaUpHaa	do not rush. know him first very well. marriage is sacred. it is not  like a cellphone that you want to change and update anytime you want to. find the perfect man for you, you just have to pray so that you'll never get into mistake again.|`|RfGTXlotaa	10 years is a long time to take to test the waters... so to speak if you love each other and want to be together and it feels right then you should do it!|`|uNazz3HLaa	I don't think there's a recipe regarding time, as far as length in waiting. You've probably already answered the question in your heart. I say, go with it. If it's right, you'll know it. I personally think you already do.
cnMT4pzuaa	1. Its always good to tell people your feelings. Its better to tell them than to never know what could have happened.<br>  <br>  2. i dont really have an answer for that one<br>  <br>  3. Love knows no age<br>  <br>  <br>  but if he asks everyone out, there must be other girls that are "special" to him to. if you two went out, how could you trust him to not get involved with other "special" girls as well?<br>  <br>  I say tell him how you feel, but keep being friends a little longer. make sure that he doesn't abandon the fact that you like him for someone else.|`|UeUymAjwaa	1)say something...y do we guys always gotta make the move lol have you ever been rejected...i havent btw lol....but still its nerve recking<br>  2) just try to be nice to guys and seem outgoing and fun..........guys at first glance care about looks but then personality.so since the guy has already seen you.the only way to attract attention is to have a good fun personality and you gotta be good hearted, most guys can see bitches...<br>  3)dont forget him until you or he has made a move|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	dnt rush it because once uu try to be more thn friends it could mess up you guys relationship if you guys didnt work out as a couple...so i gues just take some time to thnk about whether or not uu really like him that much thn listen to your heart|`|iQJEZ7C5aa	umm since he already asked you and you said no, then you should make the next move|`|w1myDAypaa	Forget him !!<br>  by the descriptions !!! i think he will turn out as a thug and you will live a misiriable life...<br>  Try someone nicer fresher and un-racist! heh<br>  <br>  But if you heart says for you to go with him then go <br>  Its like a magnet's attraction and Repulsion!!<br>  <br>  But i wouldnt recommend it <br>  sorry but thats the way i feel|`|dTPsCa9raa	Yes, you should go in for the move ...........and if he doesn't has a hookup right now ( you must be knowing) , trust me it's gotta be a "YES".....and don't worry about the age thing....even i am 8 months younger to my girlfriend.|`|oPfIaltnaa	Guys like to hear to straight up truth. At least I do. Tell him how you feel.|`|9dNPN9CSaa	Tell him<br>  <br>  We guys - in our callow youth anyway - too often take the female no to mean >><br>  <br>  er >><br>  <br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO  !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Not a temporary one-off with encouragement to keep trying<br>  <br>  Or a tease/challenge/test<br>  <br>  <br>  Teen guys can be easy to discourage, feel humiliated <br>  <br>  & make a mental note not to try that one again<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  Mental note of another kind:-<br>  <br>  <br>  When I was a teen, my first band was >><br>  <br>  er >><br>  <br>  Vlad The Impaler on drums ..<br>  <br>  Genghis Kan't on bass<br>  <br>  Herod on synth<br>  <br>  Vulcan on sax<br>  <br>  Spock & Scotty on trumpets<br>  <br>  Hannibal on lead guitar<br>  <br>  Plato on steel guitar<br>  <br>  Ivan The Terrible on vocals<br>  <br>  The Gorgon on backing vocals<br>  <br>  Pontius Pilate on Tour Management<br>  <br>  Aristotle on PA & PR<br>  <br>  Socrates on supplyin' drinks - (crates of it - get it?)<br>  <br>  <br>  Me?<br>  <br>  I was the bouncer for those defenceless lil' boys with toys<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL|`|PJ4kq7Nzaa	well if he is what your friend say their is no point people change in time he could be nice to you now but could be a jerk 2 you later. i had friends like that before treats their gf nice in the beginning than an *** later my suggestion just be friends. you don't have 2 believe me or take my word 4 it i just don't want your feelings hurt.
AA12115018	My wife is the best! After 8 years, I still love her. Here's why:<br>  She cooks dinner whenever she is home before 6. She makes breakfast for the family on Saturday. She gives her dad crap about being a Yankee fan because I am a Red Sox fan. She listens to me when I need to vent or just talk. She tries to help around the house. I love her because she sux at laundry and I fired her from it. I love it when she farts, burps, and snorts. I love her because she has goofy toes. I love her because she will do anything sexual (and I do mean ANYTHING). I love her because she scratches my arms and legs. She is a great mommy. <br>  There is nothing about my wife that I don't love. She is the best.|`|443049e09e6d875e4063bd1ec0ac8667aa	the way she s u c k s|`|57a8065a65362f9a6572ec6e79776c17aa	i love my wife cuse was can tell each other every thing and cuse shes funny  and she is alway there for me she is my best friend|`|AA10301838	My wife is intelligent, funny, resourceful, talented, and beautiful! Besides being the sexiest woman on the planet, she's also a good cook.  What do I LOVE about my best friend this side of heaven? Hmmm... In short... EVERYTHIING!!!!!!!! Can't think of a thing I'd change.  5 years and better than ever!!!
crxbob5jaa	She's emotional, and all of you are immature. This is ridiculous. Just because a gentleman gives his arm to someone to walk down an aisle doesn't mean he's leaving the woman he lives with. You guys need to grow up and find something else to worry about.|`|0GZ7OIVsaa	I say thats ****** up.<br>  Honestly, she only probably called you to be her bridesmaid again because she got no one to replace the girl who dropped out. But thats just  guess<br>  If it hurts, dont do it unless she has said her sorry|`|L2yP0hqRaa	maybe your sister too much pressured because problem about wedding stuff and fight. i think she finish take time without you to plot for wedding and ready. and your sister probably mistake to said that because fight alway fast to mistake said bad negative thing. i think she feel bad and lot mistake also want you back in her wedding because you & her have same blood sister. Please go to her Wedding made her happy and proud. "IF" you not go her wedding and she probably hate or not talk you forever or lost sister. because it very important wedding in her whole life! She will appreciate you come her wedding. please do it. :) God bless your family and you! I hope it everything going along good! :)|`|BbdWpp1Caa	It reminds me of my sister a little. When we were kids we would pull each other's hair out...literally. Since things with my parents got hard we are like twins. She just wrote me an email cranky at me for something then started a new paragraph and said 'well that's my rant over. How was your day? etc'<br>  Get together with her. Say that she hurt your feelings about what she said about your husband. Say you'd like to be in the wedding (if you do) but ask her to consider some of your ideas. Perhaps since you aren't a bridesmaid but rather bringing the groom in, then maybe you could have a dress that is different but in the same colour to mark you as different...and save the bridesmaid's dresses as a surprise for their entry.|`|Mbgck2ifaa	She's your sister, you have to be able to depend on your family otherwise who the hell do you have, right? Tell her that you are still mad about what she said, and that it really hurts, and if she apologizes then you can be in her wedding. Think of it like this, in 10 years you'll probably have made up and long forgotten about the fight, looking at her wedding pictures and you're not there because of some dumb fight?! Thats ridiculous! Sisters fight all the time, trust me, i have 4 of them myself, and my sisters have said really hurtful things to me too, one sister even called me a whore and said i was a bad parent because I had my daughter when I was 17, and she said I deserved it when my daughters father left me because it was my fault for getting pregnant in the first place. But I forgave her, and she was truly sorry for what she said, and she's never said anything like that since. Just make sure that you sister knows that this is a one time thing, you forgiving her for talking bad about you and your husband and son, and if she bashes on it again then you may/ may not forgive her. Give her a chance, be in the wedding, and watch her change. I'm sure she's really embarrassed about being a *****. Plus, brides are always extra ***** and horrible just before the wedding, it's a stressful thing! She'll go back to normal after the wedding.<br>  <br>  maybe you can help me with my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag0gXFNi5Y441ctqZ54qX3Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219214509AAWQ6ZV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Should she have said mean things to you?  No.<br>  Should you be telling her what to do in her wedding?  No.<br>  Should you be in the wedding (as whatever it is she wants you to be)? Yes.  You'll regret it later if you don't.<br>  This is her big day,  not yours.  Let her plan it how she wants too, and if she asks you and your husband to be a part of it then either gracefully bow out or feel honored you have a sister that wants you there.<br>  If you ever have a wedding, you can do whatever you want, but not in someone else's wedding.|`|CLJXTsFJaa	HMMMM, <br>  <br>  My guess is that your sister is just stressed out.  She wants her wedding to be perfect and her way.  I don't think that she meant to say hurtful things to you I think that perhaps it was just in the heat of the moment.<br>  <br>  As for your mum well I don't know why any mother would take sides like that.  If it were me I would have just hung up the phone spoken to each of you seperately found out what was going on the got you both together to sort it out.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would tell your sister you will think about being in her wedding let her know your feelings are still hurt about what has happened.  Maybe tell her your sorry if she felt offended by anything you may have said even if you didn't say anything wrong at all.  Just to clear the air.  Then if she appologizes to you accept her invite to be in her wedding.  If she dosn't then dont go.  At least then you know you have tried and you were the bigger person for appoligizing and just let her do things her way.   <br>  <br>  To be honest with you if my sister tells me she wants to choose her own black dress for my wedding I would be pretty mad too as I want all my girls the same (getting married October next year)<br>  <br>  But as for her wanting your husband in the wedding party with another woman that's not right!!!!  And you have every reason to be mad at her for that.  I sure would be mad if my sister wanted my partner in her wedding with another woman GEEZ it just isn't right.  She shouldn't be choosing the groomsmen anyway thats her hubby's job.  <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like shes a little bit of a control freak but when it comes to your special day who wouldn't be?<br>  <br>  I do hope you can sort things out with her but most of all I hope she appologizes to you for the hurtfull things she said about you and your hubby and little boy that just isn't fair at all. <br>  <br>  All the best
2pxGPcxaaa	Not a girl, but you should aim for a hair-style that compliments your head/face structure.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Oh my god. Everyone needs to stop asking these questions. Different people like different things! Imagine that!|`|lZmf4KFdaa	It depends on the kind of girl you're trying to attract.  I would say the majority of girls like it spiked or just normal.  If you have a cute face, it doesn't matter what your hair looks like.|`|U0Ssc17Daa	Most girls actually hate spiked hair and would prefer longer, normal hair. But not super scene emo hair, that's gross.|`|rLHhZMlbaa	spikkkkkked!|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	spiked is soooooo cuute...to me at least!!!
cWuumdy7aa	I think when boss caught them red handed he had no option but to keep quite as the bosses wife was having sex with her own consent. But surely he should not have left the job as he was not doing any thing which affected his work. do you think that wife will keep quite she will have another fellow to satisfy her lust.Boss would have no courage to sack him so he did not to right by quitting.|`|jp5lfmzTaa	Tell me if the vacancy is still unfilled.|`|IWiAm8IMaa	wow i am guessing the boss didn't wanted to create a scene afraid that his wife would take over his business or it wasn't the first time his wife did something like that<br>  <br>  i would have been pissed of|`|6URBv5xfaa	where is the problem,...if you ask, i wouldnt have quitted the job, instead would have continued having sex with her...why to miss a golden oppurtunity|`|UdoLcwm4aa	That sort of thing never comes out right.
6uq0I4CPaa	I would not leave her based on the fact that you feel pushed aside by a ball.  I would talk to her, and give her the ultimatum, but try to work it out.  Obviously you care about her and don't want to lose her.  Take her out on a day that you have more time together and sit her down and talk to her.  Keep pushing the issue until she listens to you.  If she cares for you the way that you care for her, than she should see how you feel.  Don't end a relationship based on a ball.  I wish you the best!!!|`|AA10426129	if you aren't important to him then leave him|`|lIO4uiJmaa	Well her being out 4 nights a week does seem excessive to me, not to mention the Saturday morning.  You need to sit down and talk about it - In mean has she always done this since you have known her, in which case you knew the situation you were getting into or it is something she has taken up since you have been living together.<br>  <br>  Remember if you give her an ultimatum to some people can seem like a threat and she could tell you where to go. It would make more sense just to say that you don't want to be in a live in relationship where you spend your evenings alone, I mean you could have stayed single and living alone if you still wanted that.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	You're obviously in pain, and she isn't even around long enough to see what she is doing to you.<br>  <br>  You need to tell her that you are feeling lonely.  Tell her that you don't "feel the connection" you used to feel, and you don't want to lose her.<br>  <br>  If she really loves you, then she WILL give up one of those teams.  Maybe she really just doesn't understand how much you are suffering.|`|AA10373401	before you walk away, give her an option of giving you time. If she does not do so, then you can leave knowing that there was nothing left to save the relationship.|`|bc9inzicaa	talk to her, but bottom line is either you or the football.  If you are important enough, it would be you she chooses.  If not, then you do not need to be wasting any more of your time with her.|`|fd5f9e86546448e9bb4ac9ad25034833aa	I think you need to sit down and talk to her about this properly. Everyone has to work but if you feel like she isn't putting in enough effort to the relationship you need to speak up because she probably doesn't realise that you feel this way. I sort of know where you're coming from because my boyfriend and i haven't been spending alot time with each other lately as he is working full time at the moment. Also you mentioned that you were sick of the same routine. Maybe you should change it a little bit...instead of staying at home ask if she would like to go out for dinner, go out for a picnic, or go for a holiday with her if you can. I know its hard and obviously you love her but just let her know that you're feeling left out and if she doesn't care then ask yourself is it really worth your time because in the long run you will just keep hurting and nobody deserves that. If things don't work out in the end don't beat yourself up about it because there are plenty of people in the world in the same situation you are in looking for somebody who will always be there for them. I hope It all works out for you!!!|`|MXOEHcXRaa	i would just let her go. You shouldn't be in anymore pain than you already are.|`|w6v8JnBAaa	Is there any way you can become involved with the games in an effort to spend more time together? Ask if there is something you can do to help/assist her with what she's involved in. If there isn't & she isn't willing to make more time for the two of you then it would be very clear that things would always be this way.<br>  I know a couple who are very similar to this & it works out very well for them. He has his own hobbies that occupy his time when his wife is busy teaching or working out, etc. Of course, this doesn't work for all couples...it wouldn't work for me.<br>  Good luck.
lvOR401haa	1 -Go to one of those pottery painting places and have your hens all paint you a mug or something to keep?  A friend of mine did tha and it was fun.<br>  <br>  2 - Go for a meal somewhere nice.<br>  <br>  3 - A day trip - like a spa day<br>  <br>  Don't let your hens pressure you into doing anything you don't want to - they can do that for their's!  Hope you find something fun to do and congrats on th wedding x|`|5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	a nice meal. treat yourself.|`|Z2m8TEFHaa	My girlfriend went on a hen do where they all went to a "paint-your-own-pottery" day. They all painted a mug or a small jug or a something like that for themselves, and then all put a message on a plate for the bride as well. It was in the morning, they had a champagne breakfast and then they all went to a cinema where you can rent out a private screen and watched singing in the rain, before going back to the brides house for chinese takeaway.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|Rc9SNllPaa	Just be very to the point and straightforward, and say you are not interested. Otherwise it sounds like you have a recipe for disaster brewing and one  which you could end up regretting for some time to come. It is your henny party. Sounds like someone is trying to enjoy at your expense and not really care about what you think or feel. A true friend would first put your desires, mood, feelings and personality in the forefront as the focal point of the celebration. If that is not happening, the so-called celebration has lost it's celebrity and meaning.<br>  Take care and congratulations. Best wishes always. Gouranga my friend be happy.<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|J9pIrpkBaa	My friend that got married last year didn't want anything to hectic either so we rented a cottage in the country and had a pamper party one evening and a posh dinner the next evening and in the day time we just played games and relaxed in the sunshine. It was lovely to have a girly weekend just doing nothing!|`|1f1723a276a7a216646a15bc2761f1b8aa	Hi there.<br>  Do something you really like! That is the only rule.<br>  For instance, you can be as cultural as you like, so why not go to London and take in a show? Have a break in Dublin or Edinburgh and see the sights? Those who are desperate to go clubbing could then do so, if they wished, the rest of you have a drink or two and off to bed.<br>  Whatever it is, enjoy it.<br>  Good luck, Steve.|`|EzTh60uIaa	rally driving experience or activity weekend.....who said it had to be girly|`|HPRFtBAsaa	Congratulations!<br>  <br>  How about going to a comedy club?  They usually sell food, and have a respectable disco afterwards.  <br>  <br>  I recently got married and didn't want a conventional hen night, I just felt too old for it, I also had lots of joint friends with my husband, so we had a joint hen and stag, (a hag night) at our local comedy club.<br>  <br>  The club let a friend of mine go in prior to the show and decorate our table with funny photos of my chap and I.<br>  <br>  It was a really good night, I did notice that it tends to attract more mature hen parties there, so it might be just your thing.  At least you're pretty much guaranteed that your guests will be entertained all night without you having to keep trying to entertain them yourself.<br>  <br>  Our local club charged us ￡15 each and ￡7 for food on the night and finished at midnight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Caroline|`|UIXKTaghaa	I didn't want a "hen party" when I got married.  Instead I had something I called a "hag night" and combined the men and women friends I had and we all just went to a nice restaurant and had a good meal.  No dancing, clubbing etc.<br>  <br>  However there are loads of ideas for simple things you could do and it depends on your finances.<br>  <br>  1) Camping weekend.<br>  2) Spa or pampering day (you could all book in for a massage)<br>  3) Dinner party at home.  Perhaps a murder mystery dinner party to liven things up.  You can buy several all girl games, online.<br>  4) Shopping trip or charity shopping trip<br>  5) Pottery painting<br>  6) Pony trekking, or paint balling, or high ropes activity<br>  7) Go on a boat trip together, or do something romantic e.g. a city break to venice<br>  8) Have a wine tasting or make up party.<br>  9) Go to a good fun fair. e.g. alton towers.<br>  10) Go for a ride on a steam train at night, some of the preservation societies do meals at night and you can ride and eat.<br>  11) Go see a play / opera / musical.<br>  12) Slumber party - like when you were kids - videos, pop corn, chocolates, truth or dare.<br>  13) Trip to the cinema.<br>  14) Do a sponsored something like sky dive and raise some money for charity.<br>  15) Go on an outward bound weekend.<br>  16) Mystery bus tour.<br>  17) Visit a casino for the night with a set amount of money each.|`|q4tTabfjaa	A moral start to your new life, you could hold a clothes swap party.<br>  All your friends bring the clothes that no longer fit them and you all have a laugh trying them on and taking some home. All the left overs to go to the local children's charity shop.|`|OjNfpeIhaa	how about a pampering afternoon at a health spa and then maybe a nice meal out at a fancy restraunt that u would not usually go to, or take a weekend away with your friends and do something different like hillwalking or an extreme sport, good luck hope all goes well xx|`|8TUlr7Pvaa	We went Dog racing when I got married, its still a laugh, you can chat and have a drink and maybe win back some of the money you spent on the wedding!|`|aSxMpaF8aa	Hi come stay in my haunted farmhouse bb, plenty to do here, hill walking, central to many market towns, quaint pubs.|`|ksqIYFQUaa	Spa weekend would be perfect|`|CLJXTsFJaa	Hey there, I am the same as you don't really like to party.  My wedding is NEXT october and I cant wait.  My cheif bridesmaid is already talking about parties and clubbing OH NO so worried I don't drink really.  <br>  <br>  Anyway you could just have a really girly day with your girlfriends your mum and sisters if you have any or sister in laws.  You could all go out for lunch.  Then get your hair done and your nails done.  A relaxing spa or sun bed.  Maybe get a facial.  Or you could go out for dinner and just have a few quiet drinks.  Could go see a chick flick at the movies.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|RfGTXlotaa	day spa!! I never do one but it is something relaxing that you can do with friends before the wedding when at the time you will be all stressed out.  Or a friend of mine took some mates and went to an introductory art class and learnt how to draw amongst other things a nude... something to giggle at and you get the boy factor without actually having to party..|`|560ab7fb56015d6a3a48ceecf41dd889aa	me, my best mate and friends had a hen party to remember. we went pony treking then on to lunch it was a great day and everyone including all the people who had never riden before had a great time it was the best hen party ever.
l4rFmqnAaa	Yeah not enough info to know. Maybe she's just a friend. My ex had a guy friend that was in like every picture she had & they were roommates at college. Made me kind of jealous so I brought it up nonchalantly and found out the info on him. been best friends since like elementary school. And had more of a brother/sister thing going on. Met him & hung out all the time. He ended up being a cool friend|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Yes..hello. Are you there?<br>  <br>  Would you put a picture of someone you didn't like on your profile?<br>  <br>  His comment didn't say "This is the only girl I will ever look at, like, love or have children with."  Did it?    <br>  <br>  How many guys are on your facebook?|`|lZmf4KFdaa	Probably , but it could be that they're just good friends and he is being nice.  Just hang back and wait to see if something happens between them.|`|IIuafPfIaa	Yes. It looks like it.

Either grow up and not let this aperson bother you or dont go over there, its the nice thing to do for your boyfriend, you be the adult here since his dad cant. Sorry its happening many people have horrid parents, so be more compassionate towards your boyfriend, and show him what real love and respect is.
2JJLYSAKaa	Yes.  Despise is a harsh word.  Add absolutely to that and ouch!<br>  You are not going to fail because of his father, you are going to fail because of YOU.  You let this man do this to you.<br>  <br>  I have always been respectful of adults.  I was brought up that way.  Some adults don't deserve that respect and it appears like this is one of those schmucks.  <br>  <br>  You hate this man because he knows how to get to you.  He has insight into his son and knows how to play both of you.  You let him treat you like a doormat.  <br>  <br>  Steps for dealing with an unforgiving in-law to be<br>  1.  Find his/her  Achilles heel  (he knows yours).  His weakness. I think he has a problem with women in general and that is why he makes you cry and mistreats your daughter.<br>  <br>  *******By the way *** Keep your 2 yr old daughter away from machosistic man.  She will be psychologically messed up because he says mean things, you cry and she doesn't have the slightest idea why.<br>  <br>  Where is your boyfriend's Mom?  No mention.  I bet in the loony bin or she slit her wrists being with a man like this.<br>  <br>  Why isn't your boyfriend sticking up for you?  He will be just like him.  He thinks this behavior is acceptable.<br>  <br>  If not for yourself, get your daughter out of there.  Never, ever bring her back.   He is a mean, mean man and gets his jollies out of hurting women.   If you can't stand up to it, your bf can't (wuss)   <br>  Do it for your daughter, for God's sake.|`|EXdiDbTTaa	It will most def. last, happens to a lot of poeple, don't let this thing beat you out, if you really love him you wouldn't let the dad ruin such a good thing, trust me, yooull regret it so much. trust me.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	speed up the dying process<br>  <br>  but seriously be a dick to him in return|`|AA11656721	I think this father is trying to make you and your daughter look bad in front of his son.  Most likely he doesn't feel your good enough.  Tell your boyfriend you respect that he needs to see his father from time to time, but I think you should not go there anymore.  Unless it is an emergency.<br>  This way it will be a lot easier for everyone, especially your little girl.<br>  If you try to come between your boyfriend and his father it may turn bad for you later.  Prove you are worth keeping and don't let this old man get you down.  Take good care of your man when he comes home, prove his dad wrong.  Eventually your guy will stick by you and his father will just have to accept it.|`|f6c9bfbcb3fb45de44790bb21a61cc31aa	the most important question is "does your boyfriend defend you"?<br>  when the father direpects you, does the boyfriend stand up to him? If the answer is "no", then the question isn't "will it work" but rather "why would you stay w/ him? He shouldn't stand by while ANYONE treats you this way. Not even the father. Apparently the father has no repects for the son and his choice of a girlfriend. I would NEVER be with a boyfriend that let me be treated this way by his father, or anyone else.|`|HUUZgDppaa	no if he hates him too then just go with it just be with the guy who cares about the father he just dosent like seeing his son with anybody. just continue seeing him and tell your boyfriend to tell his father to back off a little bit. he should of done this already|`|WGHjb9tBaa	Hi!  Don't worry about it.  Love is all about perseverance.  If the bond with your boyfriend is strong, then you should do fine.  Hang in there and try and not see or talk to his dad.|`|IjhFmKUWaa	You're dating your boyfriend. Not his father.<br>  <br>  If you really love each other, nobody - not even his father - will break that up.|`|vDrTzGKzaa	im in the same situation. there is absolutely nothing you can do. they never give up its going on 4 years.|`|bAzI8VWfaa	im a boy i should no just ceep him happie realy realy realy happy|`|MtsfAnXVaa	talk to your boyfriend about it, tell him that you don't want anything to do with him and if he doesn't accept that, leave him, tell him his father is tearing you 2 apart and if you want it to work hes going to have to talk to his dad, or you guys shouldn't be around the father|`|hFGT2RCkaa	Be willing for things to never change. If you can't stand it now, then you won't be able to stand it in the future. The only hope you could ever have would be to pray for him and not care how his father feels. Is it worth it is the question you need to ask yourself. Make the assumption that he'd never change. If so, could you handle it. Yea or Nay. If Yea, screw his father and keep your relationship. If Nay, find another good boyfriend w/ friendly parents. In-laws are often closely integrated in a marriage relationship and it is way more helpful than not to be able to get along with them. Good luck!|`|IrrAZay5aa	Just try to be respectful no matter what and if he (the father) pushes you to far politely excuse yourself or even calmly leave if you have to. One day when you and your man are just sitting around talking just nicely mention his father behavior, it is possible for him to stand up to his father without being disrespectful. Remember you are dating him and not his family, it is unfortunate that this is going on.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|lZmf4KFdaa	There's no way to know this, but if your boyfriend doesn't acknowledge it and take up for you with his father, then it will either fail or you are destined to a lifetime of unhappiness.  Sorry, but that's the cold hard truth.|`|8NyVCFO8aa	I have a similar situation with my partners mother. She is awful!! I really sympathise with your situation. <br>  We have been together for 3 years now and I have come to the conclusion that she is not my problem and I don't have to put up with the abuse. I would never want to come between mother and son, however I am not there to be a verbal punchbag. I now just walk away and leave him to deal with her. I also tell myself that even though I hate her, if it wasn't for her then I wouldn't have him, and for that I am grateful.<br>  Don't get me wrong, it is difficult to remember this when she is in full swing! But I believe that if you love someone you do whatever you can to keep hold of them! Just remember that if someone has to be nasty and unkind this is because of their insecurity and possible jealousy of your happy relationship.<br>  I really hope this helps! And I hope that you have a long and happy life with your partner xx|`|IUXriZQJaa	If you love the son, you cannot possibly truly hate his father.<br>  When his father 'volunteers' you to help out -- don't take this wrong -- it is probably because that is the role normally taken by women who are part of his household. Try going the extra mile in this regard.<br>  On the daughter issue, stand up for your little girl or remove her from his vicinity every time he treats her badly. Let him see it is not okay to do that.<br>  On the name issue, politely, sweetly correct him on that.<br>  <br>  You should respect your boyfriend if he has a good relationship with his father. It means he is a family man and will be more likely to be a stable companion for you.<br>  If you truly can't stand his father, just remember that this is an indicator of how he himself will behave at his father's current age.<br>  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Talk with your husband about possible responses to his father's abuse of you.  When your husband married you, you became his new family.  He needs to defend you and demand that his father show you respect.  No one is talking about anyone liking anyone.  Shutting up if  you don't have something nice to say is appropriate.  I can't believe he accepts your father treating his daughter like a dog.  You two need to talk.  If you're at odds for what to do, seek the help of a counselor - to save your marriage.  I don't see you putting up with this forever, and your daughter certainly doesn't need to be insulted.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oops!  I thought you were married - skipped over the boyfriend part.  I'd do the same thing with a boyfriend that you planned a future with.
jbE1nWqzaa	Trust is the name.|`|l4rFmqnAaa	If he promised it wouldn't happen again, then he should of kept to his promise. Therefore you have every right to be upset. Considering you've found out twice (don't know if you walked in or something) then I wouldn't assume too much unless he's just horrible at hiding things, but as a guy I'd say you have the right to be suspicious. If I was going to cheat on my girlfriend I'd be sure that she wouldn't be around to find out or even be suspicious.|`|1hciyvKdaa	It really could be a friend, but if you feel so strongly your only choice is to break up with him and move on, that way your not all stressed out. He obviously is not all that serious about you or he would of not risked you freaking out.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Well, you did let him know you were uncomfortable with it, and he did it again anyway, so he should at least be sorry for that, even if he didn't do anything with her.<br>  <br>  And maybe you should try trusting him more.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Set up surveillance in his room & know for sure.|`|JV0i77uiaa	He is like a little immature little boy.  He became upset so you would not say anything to him.  What the hell he is doing with another girl in his room.  She must be a friend, but a friend with benefit.  They have no business to be in his room.  You are not overreacting.  Forget of him apologizing, he could apologize 100 times and keep doing the same thing.  You have to make a decision is you want to keep this kind of boyfriend.  He doesn't have any respect for you.  I hope you start moving on.  I think he is cheating.  God bless you to help you to make a decision.|`|AA11656721	Your not overreacting, he should of learned from the first time.  This bothered you very much.  This guy should respect your feelings.  If he wants to hang out with her, why not do it with a few others around, why are they alone?<br>  Try to work it out if you really love him, be patient because we all sin.  Just tell him that if he does it again, three times is not a charm.  It should be over if he doesn't respect you.|`|jzdhqxPTaa	He doesn't have much respect for you does he? No respect no relationship. Why don't you get a male freind aroun and watch a movie in your room??? I'm sure your b/f will like that. Funny how in some relationships, theres rules for one and rules for another.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	That is way inappropriate, if they haven't already cheated together, than they will eventually if they keep hanging out like that.|`|kgIccwR0aa	sounds to me like his cheating its abt time u open ur eyes.carry on like dis and u ll find worse fings den just a movie.just move on.his taking advantage finking u blind but iam sure u can tell when smg iz up u out of al people should know berra.breakups r normal der part of life most of da time its 4 da best coz u end up finding sum1 more compatible 2 ur personality.  take care..|`|UJJ8ObnXaa	You're overreacting like crazy. Unless he's known to cheat then he probably is telling the truth.|`|DYoyrsT3aa	nah i think you have some right to to overreact|`|DybOqfGpaa	no buddy just trust him these things will ruin ur relationship plz dun do these things give him space to do what he wants otherwise he will get frustrated and wen he will see that u r so loyal and giving him so much space to do anything so he will not do anything <br>  trust him dun do these thing say to him ok fine u can have time with ur freindz i dun have any problem, u should know ur place dn campare ur self with her or any of his freind<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|hrXNXW7Caa	hmm.... well hes lying about one thing and that is the fact that he did the same thing again even after he promised. So i think you have a reason to be suspicious. Don't overdo it though. There has to be some kind of trust between you two. although he is pushing your limits with him doing it over again. If he really doesn't want to hurt you he would think about your feelings first and decide otherwise. Overall you do have a reason to think that way but just don't make a fool of yourself 0_o|`|93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	I don't think you're overreacting because you told him you didn't feel comfortable with him being alone with another girl, even if nothing happened. <br>  <br>  For him to do it again after he promised is a sign that he has no respect for your concerns. Honestly, he had no reason to get mad at you but judging by his reaction, something isn't right.<br>  <br>  If he does it now, then he'll do later on in the relationship.|`|YPu6hWEwaa	I hope you did not appear overreacting when you told him how upset you are. Giving him the benifit of the doubt, at first, was the best thing that you can do at that time.<br>  <br>  However, the fact that you already had an agreement that he will not do it again, but still he did, is way too disappointing.|`|4ILA5CDzaa	Honestly, I would be pissed ..<br>  I think what he is trying to do is to make you feel guilty for accusing him, when in all reality he is cheating on you.<br>  <br>  -or- <br>  <br>  There is the other side and he really isn't cheating on you, but odds are if he's alone with a girl at 1am, in his room, then he is at least doing something ..<br>  <br>  Hope you two work things out and I hope you find the truth ..<br>  Good Luck|`|lZmf4KFdaa	Female intuition is very powerful.  Most of the time when we feel like something's not right, it's usually the case.  I think, unfortunately, he's trying to get you to break up with him.  A lot of guys don't have the guts to break up, so they do things so that you will break up with them, and they're off the hook.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	His over-reaction is a sign that he is up to no good. I'm not saying that anything happened, but he does have a guilty conscious and he is dealing with it by lashing out at you.<br>  The girl doesn't have good intentions either if she is going into his room. She knows what she is doing.<br>  As for trusting him, I think he needs to EARN that now, since he went against your wishes knowingly.|`|hoZxIQkkaa	You should be mad he did not respect your request. It's not cool for him to be hanging around with other girls in his room alone. Do you think he would like it if it were the other way around? Try asking him that. He knows it was wrong. Explain how you feel hurt he did not respect your request. Good Luck.|`|Fk2Bxi6uaa	sure you have the right to be upset because the bed room is an off limits territory to female friends..you're totally right he should have his company in the living room. just let him know that it makes you uncomfortable without accusing him of doing anything. just show concern.|`|IrrAZay5aa	I don't think you are overreacting because he knows how you feel and he is still being inconsidered about your feelings. I think if you all try to talk about the situation again try to describe it and put him in your shoes. <br>  Good Luck!|`|vfCB41Usaa	Watching a movie with a chick is boring, unless you are doing somthing else or thinking about doing somthing you shouldn't be doing because you have a girlfriend. If he hasn't cheated on you yet, I am 99.9% sure he i thinking about it.|`|8i7AEWRCaa	he is cheating.... how gurls can be SO lame as i am? why we cant get away from these guys easy? why he wud do that? cant he watch these movies alone?<br>  get away from this asshole or he will keep on doing that, he thinx he is right <br>  i wud become so mad at him and treat him so meaN|`|UTAEdnDbaa	not at all he should respect what you want and your not asking much of him to not be alone with a girl in his room. how would he like it if you were alone with a guy in your room|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	no that totally rational obviously he doesn't value you guys relationship...i'd leave his *** if it happened again!<br>  <br>  but dnt just accuse him either be patient guys dnt respond well when you just accuse them and you should have some trust in your man after 1.5 years|`|Zjq1yzEqaa	NO! NO! NO! This dog is cheating on you big time, so just dump him like a bad habit.|`|Dst5vKd7aa	of course not.  he definately was cheating on you.  at least they did not pretend to be studying.|`|s4KZRtF8aa	dun worry. dun think too much.. u may be right.. smile to a happy day. be urself.|`|zRkTwsawaa	He is just trying to use the power he has as a man to overpower you so that you feel guilty of accusing him even though it is not an accuse. You are saying the reality since it had happend before and he promised never to happen again. Now, what explaination does he owe you, is he going to deny ever going out with this girl, what will he say that the relationship between him and the girl seems like. Try to confront your man but if it happens the third time i will not give you credit for allowing yourself to be hurt.<br>  <br>  Think of the girl's reaction towards you since you said the girl in question is works together with you. It is possible the girl is blackmailing you and the guy himself is a player. Nobody is comfortable with a cheater so if you feel cheated, you let go and find yourself another fish out there.|`|AA10950152	I can't say if you're overreacting because you haven't taken any action (at least none that you have stated). Being upset at him breaking an agreement is absolutely justified. Obviously you and your boyfriend have trust issues.  He needs his space. You need to "do you." That's why he's watching the movie with her and not you. It sounds like you "found out" she was over there because you showed up after you and he had a different understanding. You two are looking at two different "wrongs." He feels he's not wrong because he asserts he didn't have sex; therefore, he didn't cheat. You agree you give him the benefit of the doubt on that one. So, he's correct. On the other hand, he did do something he also agreed he wouldn't. So, you're correct. If you're "always accusing him of cheating" you need to reevaluate why that pattern is continuing. Remember, any time you give someone else the "benefit of the doubt" you have taken the "benefit" away from yourself. Love yourself first...
KCpGsN2faa	Be honest, tell him. There is a good chance he may feel the same way and that he believes YOU don't like him. I fell for my best friend, and now he and I are engaged, I thought I just liked him, we ended up talking, and it turned out he felt the same way :) If he doesn't feel the same way, just act mature and move on. Maybe take a little bit of a break from hanging with him until you are okay with just being friends, this doesn't mean you have to stop being friends completely, just a lil breather room for your heart to get over him. But that's only IF he doesn't feel the same way. Chances are he does like you.|`|IrrAZay5aa	You might need to. If I read this right you might not be to shy to act on your feelings if you so desire. The funny thing about being friends with a guy is that they might have all ready looked at you in a romantic way and decide not to act on it. Not saying that he is not attracted to you because he probably is, but he does have a girl. Just keep a good distance. If it is meant to be I will happen in its own and CORRECT timing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|Akhiwijvaa	Most of my closest friends are guys, and I find them easier to talk to then girls. I personally prefer to remain friends with them, even if i develop a crush on one of my guy friends, i dont persue it, because I honestly would rather have a great friend to laugh with, then a boyfriend who wouldnt last forever. And another thing about your guy friends, everytime they start going out with someone, remind yourself "shes not going to be around forever, and Im going to be here for him long after shes gone!"|`|lZmf4KFdaa	Guys have a hard time being just friends with girls if the are attracted to them.  If he hasn't shown signs that he is really attracted to you, then I wouldn't say anything.|`|Fk2Bxi6uaa	i think you should lay off the closeness for a while because it might actually make him uncomfortable to know that you're into him<br>  and he also has a girlfriend so he might not even see you in that way.|`|09zVUMBRaa	How long has he had the relationship w/the gf?  Did your 'feelings' for him start around that time?|`|hrXNXW7Caa	stay away from him. respect what the other woman has for him. She might really love him. She wouldn't want anyone else to destroy what they already have. Do the right thing and just be friends with him. If he wants to go ahead and be unfaithful then let him, dont be a part of it because it will make you look bad in his girlfriends eyes. In other words it'll make you look like a ho (just speaking the truth.... sorry) what about the other guy does he have a girl? See whats up with him instead. You wouldnt want to be cheated on..... would you???

AA11286455	I'm not convinced that confession, as some posters suggest, is going to help ANYthing or ANYbody at this point, three years AFTER the fact no less, esp. if you've turned your life around and your marital relationship is good and strong.  <br>  <br>  Is it an uncomfortable situation?  Yes.  <br>  Is it a tricky situation?  Yes.  <br>  Is it survivable?  Yes.  <br>  <br>  First off, limit your contact with HIM, through her, and then limit your contact with HER.  <br>  <br>  You like each other and get along well--and that's fine.  Just continue to be friendly in class with her, but don't get chummy.  Don't start making lunch dates and shopping trips and play dates betw. your kids and hers....  You don't HAVE to be girlfriends.  <br>  <br>  You can limit this friendship and explain it to her any way you like if she presses for more interaction:  Oh, betw. home and the kids and this class and work, I'm not able to take on any new friendships, but I'll be happy to work with you on that class project--in the public library, at the local cafe,....<br>  <br>  Don't let her continue to think you've both found a new girlfriend and you want to get to know each other and spend personal time together.  <br>  <br>  At the same time, it sounds very much like he has said nothing to his wife about you and has no plans to beyond saying he says he knows you and your husband--and I think he's pretty bold to admit to even that.  <br>  <br>  Another good sign:  He apparently hasn't even told her "how" he knows you and your husband.  <br>  <br>  Ever hear the expression:  "Let sleeping dogs lay"?  <br>  <br>  I understand that it may take a lot for you not to panick over this.  But you need to develop nerves of steel...and do not panick.  <br>  <br>  Panick will, indeed, get you into trouble, making you say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person....  <br>  <br>  Just let this alone.  Let it all die down.  Then make sure you take a different class at a different center next time.  Get my drift?|`|qjg0g5WMaa	NO leave it in the past deny everything remember if he is married it wouldn't be in his best intrest either honesty is not always the best policy<br>  good luck|`|tcFg1gWjaa	well, better to come from you than anyone els, you were at a bad time in yr life....confess.  Let him read your Question here. CONFESS!|`|y6HmMl9naa	EXCUSES EXCUSES EXCUSES why? you were not at the wrong place come on!!! You should be ashamed of your self.|`|AA10373401	If this happened just between, then i would suggest you keep it to yourself while being happy in your marriage. There should always be openness in a marriage, but that does not mean that  you should say everything. This may not sound like the reasonable thing to do, but it is quite the right thing to do.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	So you're going to blame your cheating on being depressed?  Nice try... you need to come clean to your husband, he has a right to know.<br>  <br>  If you are feeling very ashamed of yourself and your husband can see that, then he will most likely forgive you, but you need to tell him the truth.  If you believe in god and go to church, then you know you can hide things from your husband, but not from god.  Do the right thing.
lZmf4KFdaa	No,. don't make the move.  When a girl makes the move, it takes all the excitement out of it for the guy.  Sure he will like it at first, but he will quickly move on.  Every single time he has to lay his head on his pillow and figure out how he's going to get close enough to kiss you, that is making him that much more fond of you.  Girls just don't get it when it comes to that.  You are basically shooting yourself in the foot when you take that thrill away from the guy.  Because when he finally does get the courage, it will be awesome...fireworks galore!|`|l4rFmqnAaa	Just tickle him or something lol. Wrestle around maybe end up on top. If it feels right, go for it. I'm a guy and this has worked for me lol. The tickle/wrestling is more of a I'm nervous type of thing.|`|mRgRDhMQaa	I know how you feel girl. I'm 17, haven't dated or kissed a guy yet =/ its sad. <br>  <br>  If I were you, don't make the first move. My friend did that with a guy and I think he thought she was too straight forward or desperate. Making a first move isn't desperate but I guess when the guy makes the first move its different, I don't know lol<br>  <br>  You should just pucker up your lips or something if you want him to kiss you and be cuddly and flirty with him. Give him lots of hugs and stuff like that. I'm not the greatest with these situations because I have no experience in them. <br>  <br>  good luck chica!|`|WGHjb9tBaa	if you know for a fact that he likes you, then a guy doesn't like anything more than being asked by a girl to kiss her.  Trust me on this.  Tell him you want to kiss him.  You won't regret it.|`|40Ow9B1maa	i say watch a movie, then lean into his hest then in lke 5 min kiss him and rub his leg and you will be fin.<br>  <br>  ths how i got my first kiss|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	He's prolly never gotten **** either and just acting like he has.... MIDS<br>  <br>  aka, he dunno what to do|`|09zVUMBRaa	I like your avatar.
KWeU8LJtaa	If it's only been 5 days it can't be that bad.<br>  <br>  Just explain to him that you don't think it's going to work out. Or say that you just can't handle having a boyfriend right now.<br>  <br>  I'm sure he'll get over it and you can find someone who isn't so obsessed :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|l4rFmqnAaa	5 days? lol. just don't talk to him for a while. He'll get the point.<br>  obsession isn't good, especially if it's making you feel uncomfortable.|`|IUXriZQJaa	Avoid him.<br>  <br>  Write him a note that says "Sorry, we're not right for each other. Goodbye."<br>   <br>  Nothing else. Don't write anything else like what's in your heart. Guys feed off that. I know. I am one.<br>  <br>  After the note, don't talk to him, don't look at him, turn your back to him whenever he is around.<br>  <br>  Just give him the coldest shoulder you can.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about being mean. You are meaner to let him string along with his heart on a leash.<br>  <br>  Break it and leave it broken.|`|LvZTiPlmaa	Lol, send a text message? You're immature and socially awkward if you feel the need to end any sort of relationship over a TEXT MESSAGE. Oh wow, kids these days... <br>  <br>  Anyways, tell him you don't feel the same way. End that relationship asap.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Tell him everything is too awkward.|`|DybOqfGpaa	thats unbelievable|`|8NajE933aa	Why do you feel like he's obsessed with you?<br>  <br>  Just tell him that you think things are going a little too fast, and that maybe you should just date casually instead of being boyfriend and girlfriend.  Tell him it's weird for you and you need time.<br>  <br>  Or, if you think he's a total creep, tell him you're just not ready to have a boyfriend and you don't think it's going to work out.<br>  <br>  You can't force a relationship, and it's a huge mistake to go out with someone just because you think you should have a boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  I had one or two three-day boyfriends and then I just said to heck with it and waited until someone I actually really wanted to date came along.  Didn't happen until my senior year of high school, but it's been over a year now and we're still going strong, and he's probably going to be the only guy I'll ever date.<br>  <br>  I can't say if that'll happen to you, but high school has a lot of creeps and jerks.  Dating is easier later on.  If it's weird for you now, that's normal, don't sweat it.|`|Lk0noY62aa	Jesus! I've been going out with my GF for 7 days! Can't believe someone lasted only 5 days?<br>  <br>  Anyways, I thought that my GF thought I was obsessed with her because I always had DEEEEP feelings for her and wanted to be with her 24/7, but come to find out, she thinks the same thing about me. Read some of my previous Q's and you will know my problems;)|`|lZmf4KFdaa	Sweetie, if you don't like him, break up.  Just call him and do it over the phone or go to his house.  Just do it.  Don't make him wait in anguish.  He will sense something is wrong anyway.|`|WGHjb9tBaa	You should just forget about everything and have wild sex with each other.  Sex solves all the problems in the world.  Really.|`|uDl5lUtdaa	Tell him to stop being creepy otherwise he's gotta goooo.|`|E23s2wSNaa	sry about that, u should just tell him ur feelings, tell him u cant be with him anymore cause he isnt your type, and insure that its "not his fault"|`|hrXNXW7Caa	if hes being creapy at that time of the relationship just leave him he'll only get creepier!!!|`|jDf4pcY6aa	Send a text message.That's what I did and it worked.Good luck!|`|RsNtQTC5aa	Well, I suggest you could try telling him the next time you meet, "Excuse me, who are you? Have we met before?"<br>  or why not just tell him directly, that you feel awkward, and you don't feel like continuing. Don't worry, BFs tend to be obsessed w/ their new GFs, but its better to tell him to stop now than let the relationship continue. It would be much harder for him to accept the breakup once you've been together longer.|`|Fk2Bxi6uaa	just let him know the truth and don't prolong it...the longer you wait the harder it will be to leave..|`|5FdFIyguaa	hey baby<br>  tell him directly <br>  by calling him ya text <br>  whatever may be .................
aCOLsQw6aa	Why would you want to be with someone who abuses you Honey, you deserve better. Nobody, absolutely nobody deserves to be abused, be it mental or physical. See a counselor. I had to before I got married the 2nd time after my first one almost beat me to death. Make up your mind right now that you are better than what he has to offer. If he's with someone else, he's her problem now.|`|6jhDL35Gaa	Move on. Stop dwelling over the pain, the hurt, the betrayal. Just let yourself feel the pain, cry over it, but don't stay there too long. One day at a time. That's what it's going to take. You can do it. I know you can. You had all the patience that most of us don't. So, now focus your energy into something else. (and stay away from people who are in those situations because it's not good for you or your giving nature!)|`|qDWuMuwZaa	the pain and the hurting is only in your mind because you can accept the fact that you two part ways. don't let your self down because of the situation, to think of it, it was his loss not yours instead rejoice you make someone change and i salute you for that.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	It is painful. but rearrange your life and move on forgive him for his unthankfullness.  God will give you a better partner. try Christian dating it will work.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Wow, first off I'm sorry to hear he treated you like that after all you've done for him.  I would say move on & ignore him if he happens to come back into the picture.  Let him know you're not waiting on him & I'd just try to make some friends.  Working out really helps me reduce stress & depression.  You can go through life single, trust me I'm 21 had 1 bf for 1 month, the love of my life & was very heart broken when he broke up with me.  I've pretty much been single my whole 21 years.  I just spend time with family & friends b/c they'll always be there for me.  You're probably never going to get over it, relationships like that unfortunately stay with you & you never get over.  Just do things that you like & make you happy.  But then again I've haven't even been close to your situation.  Never revolve yourself around someone, you have to do what's right for you.  I'm a nice person & have always done the same & no longer do I.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Than goodness you weren't married with children. He's a typical rat, if he had any morals he wouldn't have been into drugs and jail. Take this as a lesson in life, a hard one, and start over.|`|6cpx0eZOaa	Allow urself to mourn for as much as u like then get up, dust off and move on!|`|WmTD3Rlaaa	I have family like that. I'm fine for a while and then something reminds me of them and I feel like what did I do wrong? It hurts so bad.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	You need to realise this man never loved you, he has used you.  Maybe that reality will help get over him faster... I think you need to see a counselor to help your grieving process.|`|bc9inzicaa	agree with j baby|`|BqXSymxjaa	My husband died after 10 years of marriage, knew him for 31 years and was with him all my adult life.  We grew up together and were each others first everything. My whole world crumbled around me when he died. I can't remember ever not loving him. I knew and loved him since I was 6 years old, he was my soul mate. It's not easy, but you need to busy yourself with friends and family. Make plans with and do stuff with someone. I have a child, so that helped, but take up a hobby or something. It will help and time does make it better. Love yourself enough to take care and do things for yourself. Pamper yourself daily. Take it a day at a time and you'll get through, Sometimes a minute at a time.Yard by yard,life is hard, but inch by inch,life's a cinch.
yt4RRTkpaa	I think you should ignore the "Friends' exs are prohibited to date" rule.<br>  E.g. if your friend was a dated everyone in your high school once kind of person, then is every girl you like a "forbidden fruit"  . <br>  I've dated my best friend's ex and my best friend moved on and found another person.  As time passes, your friend will understand and find someone else but for the sake of respect, you should still ask him whether if its okay to date her.|`|HUUZgDppaa	you got to make a choice friend or love. i had to make this decision a couple weeks ago actually almost the same situation and i chose love and it got ugly between me and my former friend so its up to you. but here is a warning if you do go out with her your friend is going to hate you and might want ot ******* beat the hell out of ya|`|lZmf4KFdaa	ask your friend for his blessing.  Tell him you don't want to cause any problems between you but that you are still really atrtracted to her and want to date her.|`|dFfQxy92aa	I am married to my friend's "ex".  Go figure
6jhDL35Gaa	You need to go to Legal Aid or a free organization that can help you legally in this situation (like a lawyer) and you can divorce him. He believes he's better than you because he's now a citizen but that's not true. You should've weighed all of your options before marrying him. But now that you're in this situation, you don't need a lecture, you need help. Get out now. Go to the phone book and find a Divorce Lawyer and prepare to move on. Don't tell him that you're doing it because he can get vindictive and refuse to sign the papers. In which you can still divorce him, it'll just take longer.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Tell him you want a divorce, then file for it.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You can divorce him, whether he wants to or not. You can also try reporting him for marriage fraud if you feel he just married you for a greencard.<br>  <br>  Get out of there and make a good life for yourself and your baby. Do you think it's healthy to bring up a baby in a dysfunctional household?|`|AA10373401	I have read replies from all these other people and i actually disagree with them, but then they think one track.  what you are explaining sounds very common in a relationship.  the other part is that, if you are dissing him that much, why don't you just leave him?|`|bc9inzicaa	Get an attorney and file for the divorce.  you deserve better.|`|6cpx0eZOaa	Get a Lawyer|`|1cc3e8f1fd4f8f463a086308722eb160aa	If there are no children in your marriage, and the state of the USA allows it, you can get a divorce without his permission, but a lawyer should help you.<br>  I am going to write a Blues song just for you...give me a day...|`|IyjndvBgaa	There are ways of getting divorce even if the other person don't want to. You just need a good lawyer. It is just too bad you went and get pregnant. Maybe you can get a legal separation to see how things get between the two of you. If you still feel that you really want out of your marriage then shop around for a lawyer.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	You two needs God's intervention here.  Marriage in not an affair where you just break when you feel like, marriege is a lifetime decision. Seek God go to your nearest Church.  if your husband knew God he was not going to tell you all about those private dance to make him horny. read 1Peter 3: 1-7 in the Holy bible.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Heh, leave his stupid cheating a$$.  What a creep!  He obviously used you to get his green card, now that he has what he wants, he's just doing whatever he feels like regardless of your emotions.  You don't need his approval to get a divorice, file for divorice and get the paper work going.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	File for divorce.  <br>  <br>  It depends on what state you are in, but in SOME states, if he doesn't show up for the court date, then you are automatically awarded the divorce.<br>  <br>  (In other states, he has to sign the papers.)|`|baC3UdzHaa	you know how to do it....you should have asked will you listen to me ***** about him?|`|JetaJF6Maa	see as he is doing wrong to u, u must definately get divorced wid him <br>  <br>  BUT before taking this BIG decision u should try to tell jim dat u still love him nd make him relize dat he is wrong nd to b corrected now ,,,,,<br>  <br>  if not this try to tell his oe ur family members abt this problem to take out a gud solution as ur life depends upon it .......<br>  <br>  plzzzz do strenthen ur heart nd mind to face the upcoming situations <br>  DONT WORRY i am wid u <br>  <br>  ALL THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eF92uM2Saa	You shop around for an attorney first. Ask people you know if they can recommend one.  If there are few assets and no kids then just get the cheapest lawyer you can because there is nothing to fight over.<br>  <br>  Just move out. Then have him served. It can be over in a matter of a few weeks.|`|xlJGeYmRaa	hi<br>  <br>  Before you think of divorce. just think .. if you take divorce, and you are currently expecting a child will you be able to look after the child. <br>  <br>  if you ask me try to find out his weakness. you must know that. however hard and stubborn a man can be there ll be a small secret which can make him as sweet as a kid. if you are able to find out his weak poind and exploit your life ll become as before. <br>  <br>  don't dishearten at just one try. try again and again. because its your life. and from your words i feel you love him....right.  ....<br>  <br>  and if he dosn't mind your feeling give him the taste of his own medicine. when you love somene and the get the surety that you ll never leave them they ll stop caring. so try this way.....
Sxlcyua5aa	Sit down with you fiance and ask him if he would rather marry his sister than to be with you.   Seriously, you need to get this resolved before you get married.   Your fiance needs to know that you come first.   I would point out all of the things that you just wrote to him and get these things worked out.   There is nothing wrong with he and his sister being good friends, but now you are in his life, and you need to be his life.   You should not be left out.   You need to realize though that his sister is going to be a big part of your life after you are married, so you better think about this and see if it is something you are willing to live with.   Marriage for a man is a learning process.   Sometimes the man finds it hard to break away from his family and make his new wife his family.   He needs to understand this.   As for not telling you about the lunch.   Men do that sometimes.   We are bone heads and we don't understand that these things are important to women more so to men.   I bet he did not mean to upset you over not telling you, but he will learn in time to inform you sooner.   Good luck and get things straight before the big event.|`|SPsE8Jtlaa	i totally think she is jealous... maybe she thinks that you are gonna take her brother away from her... maybe you should call her up and ask her if she wants to go to lunch with you... just the two of you and bond with each other.... <br>  good luck<br>  =)|`|AenRh1eRaa	wincest
6QNUjLmMaa	of course..sometimes..yeah i did wish to have no feelings at all..<br>  but look at the bright side of life!<br>  with feelings there is happiness,joy,love..<br>  and i know that there are going to be a couple of broken hearts or a couple of blue days..<br>  but..<br>  feelings are important you know...<br>  and feelings are given to us for some reason and we have to use it...<br>  instead of 60 minutes of grudge or sadness, then think of that 60 minutes of happiness and enjoyment you have lost..<br>  be happy!!<br>  well..from time to time you will cry..<br>  but after you cry its a bit okay..is it not??<br>  be happy that GOD gave you feelings...<br>  and think about this..<br>  would you even kiss if you dont have feelings??<br>  hehhehehehehehe....<br>  good  day|`|SAtTPpABaa	Absolutely, NOT.<br>  <br>  This is what separates us from worms and human beings.|`|TXjXYTsCaa	I am caught between two worlds, which is an awkward place. I have a mild form of APD, and I fail to feel good for my friends when something good happens to them or bad when they are not too badly hurt. Yet I feel SO MUCH PAIN for my crush!!! In fact, I feel a lot for him.<br>   I agree, if we had Serious APD (In otherwords, psycopathy) it would make relationships and life so, so easy to coast through. Unfortunately, it would most likely be in prison.
ajgC0KPhaa	I think he's just friendly.<br>  But whether he's into you or not, he was clearly raised to be a gentleman.<br>  <br>  Will you reply to my question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|6fwEF5ATaa	Nah, he's just really smooth.

Hapc1N9haa	I hope this help,<br>  <br>  I think you are a lot stronger than you think.  Guess what you have every right to be respected and loved and she's not doing that for you.  She is toying with your heart and I guess you know truly, how that feels and what it is doing to you.  Time seriously heals all wounds and I know you feel strongly for her but, she obviously, keeps messing with you and that's really unfair for you.  You've told her how you've felt about her, several of times... So, be proud of that fact, and be aware that you are so much worthy of someone who won't mess you around!  I would try to cut off contact with her, just let her go for a while, maybe she'll value your relationship more - I don't know.  Perhaps you need to give her that ultimatum, tell her you want more than friendship and if not, she can forget about it.  Make her see that you are not to be messed around with, tell her you can be strong without her, because you are and you know you deserve the best...<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Sammy :)|`|aSE7sihFaa	I think you should move on. If she really wanted to be with you she'd have come around by now. I think you should just let this go and see what happens later. Sounds like she's not interested despite what she told you. If she's saying she doesn't want to risk the friendship chances are she's not interested.|`|VSG70WcFaa	hey i'll tell you something sometimes girls are stupid believe me and when we have a good man in front of us we ignore him and think that he'll always be there and then when we least expect it they leave.<br>  <br>  she thinks you'll do that and you'll find a girl that will fall for you and you wont even notice how you start ignoring her if you want there is this song it's country but its true listen to the song carefully and remember if she says no it's because the guy upstairs has something better for you.<br>  <br>  buddy jewell -unanswered prayers
JCAgvgTxaa	You write:  Do i have to continue our relationship?<br>  <br>  No, you never HAVE to continue a relationship. <br>  <br>  In fact, I would advise you not to continue this one.  Doesn't sound like he is the man for you.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Sweetie of course he loves the kids more and puts them first. That's how it should always be. Your children come first even over their mother, never the less a  girlfriend/fiancee. You're being selfish by wanting him to put you first. You're an adult act like it. Do you think she might use his name because of her child with him? I know a woman who kept her 1st husband's name because she had a son with him, they got divorced she remarried had a daughter with him and divorced him. Now she has both last names for her children's sake. If you're doubting your relationship for God's sake don't get married. Give it some time. You need to realize that the kids are the most important thing in the world to him, when you have kid's you'll understand (at least that's what I've been told (I'm child-less) ).  He needs to be sensitive to you and to their needs, but you need to be sensitive of the unique situation he's in. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|cGbTJobeaa	If you cannot get over your petty jealousies regarding his children and their importance in your fiance's life, then you are not the right woman to marry him.<br>  <br>  As a step mom, let me first start by telling you to either get over it or move on and quit wasting everyone's time.  His children are his children. They were there before you.  How committed do you think he would be to you if he already showed that he didn't have the quality and character to be committed to his own children?<br>  <br>  If you are the type of woman who thinks that her partner should have no life before her and resents that he has a past, then you should not date men who have children.  When you date and marry a man with children, the children are part of a package deal with him; you do not get him without also getting the children.  <br>  <br>  From everything you described about your fiance, he sounds like a real good guy.  Actually, he sounds a lot like my husband.  These kind of men are so special that the mold was broken after they made them. I hope that you can lose the jealous attitude and be worthy of your fiance.<br>  <br>  As a step-mom, the best piece of advice that I can give you is to tell you to change your attitude. You need to think and act like the children as if they were your own so that you can lose the green-eyed monster.  Put their best interests at heart.  Don't allow them to treat you like a doormat, but always support your fiance to be the best dad he can be. And you will be rewarded with a loyal and loving husband.  If you are as lucky as I have been, your life will be richer because of his children.<br>  <br>  PS....step kids are not easy and your feelings will get hurt...often.  Act like an adult instead of a jealous teenager who is in competition to see who is loved more.  The answer is; you are loved equally, but differently.  So the daughter has a picture of her mom in her room. So what? That's her mom and it gives her comfort. I spent days cleaning the house and cooking a Thanksgiving dinner only to listen to the girls talk for half an hour about how great their mom is and what a great cook she is.  I plastered a smile on my face and said nothing. I subsequently told my husband I was hurt. His reaction? They should be proud of their mom because she is their mom.  Not exactly what I wanted to hear when I wanted him to acknowledge how I felt and comfort me, but he was right.<br>  <br>  His ex has to hear about what a great cook I am too, so it all evens out in the end. The oldest daughter always brings the desserts I make so her mom can try them.  At least I don't have to eat the ex's cooking.  ROTFLMAO.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	No you shouldnt marry him because you will end up making him miserable. You want him to have no past and nobody but you in his life and he wont do it...not even for you. You say you understand but you dont. You want him to choose you over them every time. You are like a spoiled child. The only reason you are 'nice' to his children is because you arent married yet. You and I know once you are married you will remove every trace of his past and his ex wife. Maybe he keeps some things of hers so his children will know there are no hard feelings between them and feel welcome in his home. Once you have children with him things will be even worse as you wont want him to love any child but yours and his. You dont love him because if you did you would want him to be happy and you are making him miserable over his children...something he cant fight about. He loves them and whether you like it or not he loved them before you and will love them after you. You need to grow up and see you arent the only person in the world...certainly not in his world. All of this letter is all about you. Try to see it from his point of view. If you do love him then get a grip on yourself and see how lucky you are to be loved and have a house and have someone who puts up with your silly jealousy. Jealousy will kill love dead every time so I suggest that you learn to deal with it or it will ruin your life. You must have faith that he loves you and will do the best for you or you may as well not bother being together. You cant be good to them if you are jealous of them. Dont you think they notice that? So finally I would say no..dont marry this poor man because you are going to make him miserable with your jealousy. He cant choose you over his children so you will lose every time. Once you have a child you will realise this. Let him go.|`|Mbgck2ifaa	ok, first of all you can NEVER expect a parent to put you above their children, that's just the way it is. And that's a GOOD thing for you, because only the best parents make their children #1, he's a really good man, it's rare to find someone better. Think of it like this, he has a big heart because he only has 1 biological child and the other 2 are not even related to him and he still loves them as his own children, he's trying hard to be a good parent, and you should encourage him and be proud of him for being so strong and good hearted. You can't be jealous of his children, they are young and they need him, if he's gone then they wont have a father, you love him but you don't need him, if he's gone then you can easily replace him and be perfectly happy. They need a lot of his time and energy, don't try to take that away from the children. Him telling you that you are equal with his children is a HUGE thing, most parents are willing to kill and be killed for their children, which means he is also willing to do that for you too. There is no such love as the love a parent has for their child, and if is love for you is anywhere near the love he has for his children, then you are a very blessed woman. The love a parent has for their children is hard to understand when you don't have any children yourself, you will understand when you become a mother. But i'd suggest that if you can get over trying to be above his children, and get over the jealousy then stay with him -- if you can't get over that then you need to leave, not because you can do better -- but because he can do better and his children deserve better. It takes a very strong and loving person to beable to be with a single parent, and if you can't handle it then don't try. <br>  <br>  As for the whole ex-wife thing, that's another thing you'll have to deal with, everything except her things still in the house. Tell him that it really bothers you and that you would prefer if there were few reminders of her in the house. He should allow you to get rid of all of her things, and as for the pictures of her, tell him that you don't want any of her pictures in common areas (living room, kitchen, etc.) but the children are most definitely allowed to have their mothers picture in their rooms, just close the daughters bedroom door so you can't see the womans face. There are a lot of things that may bother you about his past, mostly all because of his ex wife, but don't ever regret his children. The second u find yourself having any bad feelings for his children is the day you need to leave that family alone. Children can be monsters, horrible little brats, but they are still innocent children. <br>  <br>  hope this helps, maybe i can have ur opinion on my situation?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag0gXFNi5Y441ctqZ54qX3Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219214509AAWQ6ZV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Well,of course he is going to put his kids 1st over anyone even their mom.But it isn't going to make him love you any less.his children are always going to be in his life & if you can't handle that then maybe he isn't the man for you.You sound like he should love you more then he loves his kids & until you have children of your own,you will never understand that your child comes 1st before anyone else.If you think it will get better once you two are married and yous have a baby together,it won't.Because then you are going to expect him to love your child more then his adoptive one and then he is going to feel that you are making him choose between his kids and being a parent,you just can't do that.So,with all that i have said,NO you shouldn't marry him.But i think you already know that.But hey don't beat yourself up over it or think your a bad person because you just can't like & accept his kids.Being in a relationship with someone who has kids with someone else is very hard & the kids & the ex can make it worse.So at least now you know how you feel about guys who have kids,You'll just have to find the one for you who doesn't have kids and he is out there waiting for you to find him.Keep your head up girl who knows how it's going to be in a year from now ya know? Good luck to you,
XmJZkFuMaa	There's no harm that can come from writing him, but at the same time remember that it's been 10 years and just because you remember him as being trustworthy and can't imagine him doing that doesn't mean that's actually the case.  I've found, through the years, that because I don't lie I often believe other people won't lie unless they have to... when I know very well some people lie for no reason at all.  Because I would NEVER molest a child or do something in front of a child, I can't imagine anyone else would... yet I know some child molesters and they never acted like they were doing stuff like that.  If he was molested, there is a VERY strong chance he did what he was accused of (or worse since he could have pleaded guilty to the lesser charge in order to avoid a felony.)  Just make sure not to put yourself or your child in a situation where it could be dangerous.<br>  <br>  But even if it's just to reconnect, prison can be very lonely (not that I've been there, but I have had friends.)  Letters can be very helpful, especially if he's getting counseling for things it can show him that he has a future outside, that someone in the family still is willing to have contact.|`|7X9VKElxaa	That's a tough situation. My advice would be to ask yourself if getting involved will make you unhappy overall. You haven't spoken to these people in ten years and there must be a reason for that. By sending him a letter in prison, it is opening the door again for future contact - and maybe with more people than just him. Evaluate how much you would be able to help him if your suspicions are correct. If finding out the truth is something that you really need to do for yourself, then go ahead...but just make sure that you're really okay with involving yourself in the situation because it might not be so easy to back out again.Realize that it is not up to you to help him solve this problem, and that it is okay if you choose not to get involved. Good luck!|`|b1df7096f51a744e1eb5d0d2020fcaeeaa	I will suggest you write to him. Mainly not just to know the answer but when you are in prison, the kind of loneliness can drive someone mad. A letter will be able to bring him some sunshine and he will has something to look forward. This hope will be able to bring him through the times inside. <br>  There are times when people are unconscious of what they are doing or what had they actually did. Being in different environment, they grow up with different mind set. They will need someone to guide them and tell the whats right and whats wrong. So I hope you can be the one to bring him back into the light.
IPS3hWweaa	Every guy loves big boobs! You should be able to get just about any guy you want if you work it right.<br>  <br>  Consider breast reduction surgery, especially if they get bigger. Once they get bigger than DD they are just too big.<br>  <br>  As a guy looking at an attractive girl with big boobs, it is really hard to keep my focus on your face. The temptation is just too great! Sorry!|`|l4rFmqnAaa	Boobs are boobs. Guys are pervs. Can't expect much. I personally like small boobs A/B. but the last few I dated were D'ish which are ok.<br>  <br>  Boobs are overrated. Every girl has them. But as Ron White said, you see one pair of boobs, you want to see them all.<br>  <br>  But as stated, most guys are pervs. it's like natural reaction to look at boobs. get used to it, or cover em up thoroughly.|`|MZagCrTSaa	Cry me a river...  You have big boobs, how terrible!<br>  <br>  Of course guys like big boobs, the same way women love chiseled abs and nice arms.  But it's just a bonus.  The majority of the male population does not judge women on their breast size.<br>  <br>  Besides, guys rarely stare at them unless you have them out on display, so don't act like you don't love the attention.|`|09zVUMBRaa	There is a point when breast are too big.  Don't let some guy determine that for you.  If your breasts are a problem for you, lop them off.  If your breasts are not a problem for you let me feel them, just kidding. LOL|`|mRgRDhMQaa	I think guys do like boobs. My friend has bigger boobs than me and the guys seem to love her big boobs & big booty. I guess its just eye catching to guys. I've always wondered too why that is.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Well, I'm not a guy, but I have always been around them so I've heard this a few times.<br>  <br>  Some say that they love big boobs. Then the whole thing of "what's not to love" conversation comes up and they list of reasons why they love them =/<br>  <br>  Then others say that of course they want some boobs, but when girls get fake ones to make them bigger they find it unflattering. These guys say that boob size doesn't matter, as long as there are some.<br>  <br>  I guess it's just the guy. But I think it's natural for them to look at our boobs, even when we tell them to stop! Just as some of our eyes wander right under their belt ;]|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Well, each indivudual guy has different preferences.<br>  I can't relate to you, but I understand you. But don't get breast reduction surgery because of other people and what they think, if you're gonna do it, do it for yourself not them. And yes it can be dangerous, be sure you know about the possibilities that could happen. It must get pretty irritating though that they only pay attention to your boobs, but trust me, you will find a guy that doesnt just like you for your boob size. they do exist.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	I don't think its a big boob thing as so much as a "cleavage" thing. Girls with big boobs tend to have more cleavage. Because a girl has big boobs doesn't always mean they will look as good without bra support. I'm not saying yours won't however.<br>  I tend to like the size C the best when the bra is gone.|`|c32aCqwqaa	im not one for big boobs.. i like them smaller myself...but that might sound wierd.. i like them lage enough to fit my entire hand over... but my friend tj will go for any girl with boobs on her.. ugly or not.. i think that its that your shirts might be too low or tight try wearing something more flowy or loose and compliments your face more|`|qLg2aE0Saa	Do you know how many girls stare at your crotch when you 're wearing tight pants and are a little bigger than normal? I don't get that fascination at all! But just remember that both sides stare!|`|FzFSzilmaa	your boobs and curves will get you noticed by guys and girls... mostly cos they are THERE!!! if you wear tight tops and no bra, and your nipples get hard, then you'll get MORE attention...<br>  <br>  never be ashamed of what you've been given.. be proud and be confident and be mature...<br>  <br>  guys are nothing more than hormones on legs... if you are happy with your figure, then show it off as best you can... ;)<br>  <br>  personally, I much prefer a woman with smaller (A to C) boobs... I find them sexier... but that doesn't mean I don't notice the bigger ones and enjoy a look... :D|`|G0wXt0mlaa	Ok, here I go.<br>  <br>  It's natural for guys to want big boobs on a mate duh. Men are attracted to them because they usually mean you can care for their young effectively; though that's not what we're thinking about ;)<br>  <br>  Nao, Stop being so self conscious about your boobs, lots of girls wish they had them, If you get breast reduction then you're a fool. <br>  <br>  Here's the answer to your problem: DON'T WEAR REVEALING STUFF The most eye-catchy stuff is low cut tanktops, shirts, etc Guys love sum gud cleavage. Wear a normal sweater or something and I promise you you will notice a difference.|`|L8iI0Ocraa	I, myself am a teenager and not all my fascination is in boobs. Even though they do play a big role it depends on natural. I strongly dislike implants because it just shows a fake a girl is. Since yours are probably natural than most men will probably be attracted to them. I don't believe in surgery so in my honest opinion I don't think you should get a breast reduction. Your fine the way you are! Next time a man or boy stares at your chest just direct him to where your face is. He would have to be someone without shame to not feel embarrassed. And I hope I don't sound like a horn dog but double D sounds fine to me!!|`|PUxpDZD4aa	jeez. i guess it's true when they say "you always want what you can't have" i'm 16 and i'm only a 36b i wish my boobs were as big as yours for real! every guy i know likes big boobs....it's just the same thing as girls liking big di*ks it's more appealing, sexier, better, hotter etc. =) when guys look at your boobs i can see that getting annoying (guys even do it with me) and disrespectful too but, at least they think you're hot=D|`|8c1f0faf3cfd3ea5332e16c457103692aa	Most guys like big breasts.<br>  Your DD's are just fine, but if in the future if you still feel that they are getting in the way of your progress, lets say in your career, then I would go with a breast reduction.<br>  <br>  They have bras that make your breast look slightly smaller, I heard about them on the Tyra show, you should look into that.<br>  <br>  You could always just tell every guy that annoys you to look you in the eyes for goodness sake.|`|x6Ft1FRcaa	i,myself like big boobs as a boy.but you shouldn't embarrass yourself for having big boobs.it's a point and advantage for you.you should be proud of you and thank the god for it.if you want the guys not look at them when you talk to them you have to be careful about the topic you speak about.if it's be interesting everyone will look at you face instead of the boobs.|`|9SOLL96Uaa	Generally speaking, yes..<br>  But people have their preferences <br>  <br>  You will find that the typical male's eyes will gravitate towards that area regardless of how large/small it may be.<br>  <br>  Alot of my friends actively try to stop themselves from doing that so that don't make girls feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Mayhaps you should look for someone who would care to do the same :)|`|3Xh1w8SMaa	No. It doesn't make that big of a difference. Guys just exxagerate how much they like it. And yeah it is a distraction but don't do anything drastic. Seriously if it's that bad then wear less revealing clothes.|`|ezRmzNezaa	With all do respect guys are that way, we cannot help it. The way you dress may have something to do with it. I look at all sizes, and shapes.  The girls showing cleavage, have alot of guys eyes wandering.|`|WGHjb9tBaa	You have a great natural gift.  Guys love big breasts.  I don't understand why it bothers you so much.  I think you just had very bad experiences with guys who don't appreciate you for you.|`|oYDBtMV0aa	NO, don't get reduction. big boobs are awesome. they looks awesome too. if you get a reduction, that's tantamount to a slap in our faces.|`|U0Ssc17Daa	You can wear like a big cape like Gandalf and then they can't see lol<br>  <br>  No, they like to stare and the best hing is to ignore them and say hey up here I'm talkin when they start to *ahem* look.|`|DKiftd4Naa	Some guys like big boobs, some like little boobs, saggy boobs, eraser-top nipples or whatever. Some guys prefer a nice as$ or long legs. Either way, it's not about size of the boobs it's the fact that they're naughty bits and they can't have them.<br>  <br>  They like that they're like the cookie jar on top of the fridge that you're not allowed to touch unless you've been good.<br>  <br>  I think people are staring at your boobs because they're freakishly large- like circus large.<br>  <br>  I'm just kidding!|`|kLRsERrlaa	well u got it right that guys like boobs alot, LOL.<br>   u girls dont understand cause u got'em right there always with u. <br>  but honestly, despite what they make like on TV, big or small boobs are a personal preference.<br>  some guys like big boobs, while others prefer small.<br>  <br>  some like Pamela Andersons huge boobs, while others (myself) find them sickeningly too big.<br>  <br>  some (me) prefer them about palm sized.<br>  <br>  hell some guys like flat chests.......<br>  <br>  but the good guys (me) are more focused on personality and such, not just physical features......<br>  My GF is not what most would call a supermodel by any means,  but to me she is the most beautiful girl in the world! <br>  she is short enough to fit right in my arms, boobs are exactly my palm size, and personality matches perfectly with mine. <br>  we are a great match, and I love her with all my heart.|`|wSaJYbDMaa	some guys do like big boobs but others, like me (im 18), find that the size of them doesnt really matter. after all more than the nipple is really just a waste lol. but as for you getting a reduction, my mama had to have one done about 5 years ago. she had to do so because her DDD caused serious back problems. she is now a D? i think. and as for the surgery itself  it caused her no harm whatsoever. as for guys staring at your chest. yes that is very rude and disrespectful..but thats what comes with being a teenager in highschool and such...guys think about one thing and one thing only lol. and as i said before some guys do drool over large breasts, and yet some like me could care less because its just fatty tissue anyway...y let it bother you ya know. its your body. do with it what you please. any guy who stares at your chest while ur talkin to him...slap the sh!t outta him. lol.
jzdhqxPTaa	How about txting?? It could be just the fact he's not that into you hun. If he was crazy in love with you, he would love to hear from you, regardless if he hates phones.<br>  My b/f hates phone calls, but I'll still ring him, and he just lets me talk about a load of crap while he is probaly not listening, but he still lets me. He never rings me, but he's a txtr. Most guys are.  I wouldn't break up, I'd just back off a bit, and let him do some chasing. If he doesn't come after you, (give a a good couple weeks), then you know your answer. Good Luck|`|L8iI0Ocraa	The way I see it you have only one thing to do. You have to stop and ask yourself if you can keep going on like this. If the answer is no then what you need to do is tell him how you feel. You play a role in this relationship so you have a right to voice your opinion. It takes two to Tango. Also if this is a long distance relationship I'll tell you right now, it probably won't work out. There's a saying in Spanish that goes "relaciones de larga distancia, felizes los 4" Which translates to "people in long distance relationships, the four of you are happy"|`|09zVUMBRaa	Ask him if he thinks you're too needy/clingy w/the communication thing.  If he thinks you are dump him & find someone who will appreciate you desire to communicate w/them.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	too immature for a relationship.|`|mUWcPX6taa	I say break up with him. Sounds to me you deserve someone who will meet your emotional needs. maybe you could break up with him to test him. if he really did love you or want you he'll be heartbroken or sad about it. and in that case if he really loved/loves you and wants you back he'll have to show you he'll change at least a little bit to have you both be happy and in a healthy relationship. The tough reality is that if you do break up and you don't hear from him then something was up or he was just using you. but open up to him the next time you two talk and let him know how your feeling. if he doesn't change after that then end it, and see what happens next. in all there's plenty of guys out there in the world. But i wish you the best of luck.|`|vb6nB7ANaa	Look at it in another way he gives you space that's great would you rather him call you three times a day texting you every five min.. what you doing?where are you? coming to see you all the time. Your love for him would soon be gone this way when you meet you are both really happy to see each other you have LOADS to talk about face to face isn't that so much more important then emailing or texting?|`|No1VLEsGaa	i dont like talking on the fone either, so i can understand where the guy is coming from however when i was in a relationship i would be more than happy to on the fone with the person im going out with... yes i would be quite sometimes but i juss liked the sound of the other person voice hah. but idk.. have you talked to ur other half about your problems? im pretty sure they wouldnt tell they loved you if they didnt mean it. but idk.|`|eVF7mhE9aa	How can you truly be in love when you barely even talk? Anyway, if communication is the problem, tell him "We need to talk more or I'm just gonna be with a guy that will."

Girls do that. If you ask her out she will think that you are just one of those jerks waiting for an opportunity to pounce on you. <br>  Since she texts you you can keep it up.. and go out talk to her.. try to see what her likes are dislikes are.. be caring to her.. <br>  You can do this may be for the next few days. <br>  If you see a positive response then you can ask her out. <br>  <br>  Its not about liking you or not in her.

You will be suprised how many guys will open up and talk with you if you just get the ball rolling.

If you get rid of that hurdle by starting the conversation, you'll find a whole new world of guys that will be thrilled to talk with you!|`|AA10228553	It's hard to approach an attractive girl because unfortunately some can be quite rude.

e48cc4da7fcc47c948b7957a08d38424aa	Okay first of all what you are describing does NOT mean he is attracted to you. It is called harassment  and that is illegal and you need to go to your boss about this. He may have singled you out because he saw a weakness or vulnerability in you. I suspect if you approach your boss they will find others that he treats this way also who were afraid to come forward. Maybe they even feel they deserve what he says about them because of their own lack of self worth.<br>  <br>  He's a bully and ultimately the only one who can stop them from treating you badly is you. You have a lot of resources in your favor to stop his behavior towards you. You are trying to earn a living and you don't need to be subjected that type of treatment by him or anyone for that matter.<br>  <br>  I seriously hope you don't see his behavior as meaning he is attracted to you. That's an old wives tale!! Being mean and disrespectful isn't attraction in five year olds or in 50 year olds. You need to start standing up for yourself. Do not let ANYONE belittle or be disrespectful towards you. Tell them to go get therapy for their problems and leave you alone!!|`|AA11669108	Man this guy really have no respect for you...

9wECzEdqaa	Some people fall in love fast they give their whole heart to that person. Others may take the relationship slow hoping not to fall in love and it happens anyway and so on. Different strokes for different folks. <br>  It just happens out of spite, the longer your in a relationship with someone you will develop strong feelings for that person if the relationship is healthy.|`|AA10610661	You can't put a time frame on love!

Ever heard of the saying "love at first sight"?  When it comes to love there are no rules about how long it should take one to fall inlove.....|`|rWqrHn50aa	Depends on the people and the situation - i mean if you're friends first you'll already really care about them n then I guess it'd be easier to fall in love. Also depends on if you have that connection right from the beginning of if it goes really gradually. I'd say 2 or 4 months isn't too short to fall in love with someone if you see them often. Having never been in love I'm probably not one to comment here! But I've seen friends fall in love. I also am not sure that there's a certain specific moment when you fall in love with someone - I think it's gradual - but there's probably a moment which can make you realise it all of a sudden.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Love isn't timed.  It doesnt matter how short or how long.  I knew I was in love with my Husband as soon as we met and started dating.

kCv798F9aa	The first guy with the light brown hair sounds more attractive because of his hair color and the joking around part. The fact that he's shorter than you, not very attractive, and neither is a guy who can't be serious. I've had enough of those. The second guy is sensitive and I don't really think sensitivity is a great thing, and jokes that hurt you are not the best thing to be around. Guy # 1.<br>  Pick whomever you really like/love the most, and who makes you happier.

And some of your dates could be uncomfortable with that - because it could be akin to you dangling that as a carrot for them.<br>  Even if some do fall for it, it may not be the kind of relationship you want - that of "barter trade" (money for love).<br>  If you were to be penniless, try to determine what other attributes that you have that will appeal to the opposite sex.|`|8866a1c0223ae65feb2abfd705a3718baa	Let me ask you this: How do they KNOW you're wealthy? Do you TELL or SHOW them this on first dates or conversations? <br>  <br>  Most of us are not as fortunate as you are: to be able to enjoy financial freedom, luxuries, and a world most DREAM of living. Your lifestyle may be staggering for her to conceive; thus making her feel a bit uncomfortable with you.<br>  <br>  If you are displaying a lot of wealth initially, ask yourself if you are attempting to BUY her affections. Well, let me tell you this, sir, most women, real women that is, are not interested in material wealth. The gold diggers and playas usually are. <br>  <br>  REAL women are interested in the MAN - how he makes her FEEL - how attentive he is to HER emotional needs... and things like that. There are COUNTLESS cases of women choosing to be with the "poor" man over the "rich" one... That should NEVER be an issue.<br>  <br>  My advice is for you to use your wealth to enhance your EMOTIONAL commitment to the woman of your dreams; NOT to introduce her to who you are.<br>  <br>  In the end, she may appreciate your wealthy status, but will value the MAN YOU ARE much much more.<br>  <br>  Thanks for writing, my friend. Good Luck to you!|`|AA12167742	It's because he doesn't look after his appearance.|`|a2007d74ef6e47d1c495b1ad2440e6e1aa	I don't know, maybe we should date and I'll keep a record of all the problems that come up!  :)|`|a9f17dd17dbd47ef8edd97b2b1921f80aa	i haven't met one yet...as long he's not trying to buy me with his money!|`|c880626acd756ead214397962e66d6d6aa	b/c its not about the money. its about the man.  no woman i know is going to say no to a man because hes a millionaire but they will say no because hes a jerk.  You can blame it on the money but thats not the real problem.  Also, women dislike men who brag about how much money they have. its vain.  I don't brag about how much i have.  i want someone to love me for me and not my money.|`|3b86f6f336671e7078d21ee44cc5edfaaa	Most women don't have a problem dating a millionaire.  Where did you get your money?  If you earned it, you are probably very nice, capable, sincere and trustworthy.  If the money was given to you, you might be self-centered, lazy, ego-centric and full of yourself.  Just depends upon who you are, how you feel about yourself and how important the money is to you...are you selfish?|`|6397f3de97da9d9cc30b944231be073faa	Probably because you're a fukcing liar.

Money is a wonderful thing but it is not the whole package.  It only wraps around a package.  The man behind the money has to be kind, sincere, caring and not using his money as bait to try to attract women.  From the question you asked, it sounds like you are putting all women in one category, the buyable one.|`|e4fd01a4162287b4f7e43d1e66b566f5aa	Is because a RICH GUY like you will not give us "secure relationship".

Anyway hope u can find your true love soon. Good luck!|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	I personally can't speak for other women, but I do know that I don't have a problem dating rich men. I do have a problem if they try to impress me with their money.<br>  <br>  I had one man who wanted to buy me a $600 jacket. I said no thanks I have all the jackets that I need. He was trying to impress me with his millions. He was looking for a house to buy. We viewed a $2,000,000 house. I was not impressed. <br>  <br>  Another multi millionair called me his arm candy and he liked to go on trips in his Red sports car, which he constantly reminded me how much he had paid for it. He made a big deal about carrying a wad of cash. He loved his money more than he could love any woman. <br>  <br>  I don't scare easy. I just want a man who is deeper than his pockets. <br>  <br>  Do you define yourself by your riches? Do you show a woman that you are interested in helping others? Do you share the core of you? Your spirit your soul?|`|5dbb8c8bdb7702d4571a984ab730b46baa	their stupid i would date one no problem he human just like i am|`|4806295d988e133803d39eb5012f7480aa	I'm 18 and come from a very wealthy family. like multi millions and i know where you're coming from.

I think when women find out a guy is rich, she does everything in her power to NOT talk about his $ or downsize his wealth... like if i say "I got 6 cars + 4 houses" she'll be like "ok" whereas all my guy friends would talk about it and stuff.|`|978c686fad520bfc213e52d0920bf7fbaa	since i have money of my own i am not impressed by it, its about the personality and confidence.....rock hard abs also help.|`|ab5155a2185dd95788467cb93e36256caa	Huh?

7287ea3e6386e584b7e9f79eb157724eaa	First of all, stop allowing him to see you. I know it's a difficult thing to do sweetie, but you have to show him that it's either you or her. It's great that you're not doing anything wrong by being romantic, but you have to show him that he can't have both women. If he sees that you keep allowing him to come while he's in another relationship, he'll learn to disrespect you the way he disrespects his current girlfriend. <br>  Tell him that he has to chose between the two of you, and that you've changed for the better. You know exactly what you want now, and he needs to figure out who he wants too. <br>  good luck!|`|194516facb9c4df759d2bbc682d113d7aa	im in the same position as the guy. the girl i want after dating for 5 years is saying she wants to be single right now. but she is also saying that she doesnt know what the future holds and would get back with me if she didnt feel  the load of responsibility that is involved. essentially, i feel that if i start seeing someone, she'll come around pretty quickly and just complicate things. ive thought about this and think that if it comes to that, then ill let her chase me at that point because i had given it 110% before. all you can do is sit and wait at this point. you blew your chance and i dont know why girls cant look a little bit into the future to prevent all of these complexities.|`|34bba96f619d006191bb9fd09ddf75dfaa	well if he has a new girl you should let him go,if he dumps the new girl go for him, would you like it if she did it 2 you?|`|ed6b80d313c47c2460d049bf322ca11faa	I'm in the same exact situation!  Except I'm no longer in college and a few years ahead of you, probably.  <br>  He now lives with his gf, but I'm not sure he told her about a night we had together when i was still in college (and they were together).  For me, I can finally see myself not marrying him, and I guess thats a sign.<br>  If I were you, I would make a list of pros and cons with this guy, and if the pros outweigh the cons, then you should tell him or make an ultimatum.  Anything that will get his attention about your relationship with him and talk it out.  Otherwise, a few years will go by and his gf moves in and then it starts getting to be too late to tell him how you feel.<br>  Definately don't do anything with him because that only complicates things.  He needs to stop telling you things that will lead you on.  I feel that the sooner you talk to him about how he makes you feel the better and its always better late than never.<br>  <br>  If anything, the only way to get what you want without getting it the wrong way is to let his relationship with the girlfriend play out.  Eventually, you will be the topic between him and his gf (because his girlfriend will sense that he has feelings for you) and he will come to a point where he chooses her or you.|`|f6f48519bbee69c2ec77afa5b44d050daa	I thinkl if you want him well girl go for it and enjoy the ride|`|9a40a330be2c9d69f628cb2dbc458128aa	stop entertaining him. remember he already has a GF. so you should leave him alone. the last thing you want is to be the reason for the breakup.

Lo contrato mi prima, al principio ella lo contrato por k segun su marido le dijo k si la enga?aba pero conmigo y su prima antes de echarme la bronca hablo conmigo y se dio cuenta de k era falso lo k decia.

La mantenia informada cuando podia. <br>  -Fotografias con datos especificos escritos en un informe.<br>  -Grabaciones de un celular k aunk eran un de calidad pobre , se apreciaba perfectamente este tipo.<br>  -Llegaron a existir "testigos" de los hechos. <br>  <br>  El detective le decia a mi prima k el servicio era tal cual lo kisieras por k podria ser vigilancia las 24 h. o solo en momentos k lo pidieras.

og47TfpDaa	Es mentira cuando dicen no tener celos!!!!<br>  es raro pero cuando no hay celos no hay amor!!!!<br>  claro que a todos nos gusta recibir pruebas de amor!!!aunque claro no bruscas!!! los celos son bonitos cuando se ven con amor y confianza!!!!<br>  aunque lo peor es que muchos lo tomamos como desconfianza a nuestra pareja por miedo a perderla!!!!|`|ODfVl8gRaa	mira conozco un hombre que no era celoso sino que queria compartir a su mujer con otros, y la dejaba salir a fiestas para que a la mera hora el se viera como el bueno de la pelicula y ya que se ganara la confianza entonces se trataba de introducir con las amistades de ella.    este mismo no era celoso pero si envidioso y mucho.<br>  <br>  conozco otro que no es celoso, pero el es un hombre muy bueno, tan bueno que no le pasan por la mente obsenidades y entonces no piensa nada mal y es bien confiado.|`|T7ClLnFOaa	Todos sentimos algo de celos, xq los celos no son mas que la comparacion con otras personas, si es mas flaca, mas alta, mas bonita, mas buena, mas rica, siempre nos preocupamos por andarnos comparando con los demas, pero por lo regular es con los que tienen mas que uno y no nos damos cuenta que asi como hay gente en el escalon de arriba tambien hay abajo. dejemos de comparamos y desapareceran los celos|`|b19e00549ba43e70b7aa619b1a6d6542aa	Todos sentimos celos alguna vez y eso de que una persona no los sienta, no creo que exista porque de alguna forma actua de forma extra?a|`|XJ5lKk1naa	mira yo creo que en el fondo todos somos celosos pero no  nos gusta demostrarlo mucho porq celos es sinonimo de amor, y si esa persona te dice q no es celosa a lo mejor es porq no quiere q tu sepas q te ama demasiado porq puede creer q puedes jugar con el, pero en si todos somos celosos, porq a ti no te gustaria q alguien le tirar el can a la persona q amas o si?|`|jm6bt1slaa	Creo que si realmente sientes algo muy  profundo por alguien es natural sentir celos es parte del ser humano... y si no sientes nada es porque la otra persona no te interesa....|`|forshfzLaa	A ver Selennita si logro explicarte: yo no soy celosa y, sin embargo, a veces reacciono mal y la gente piensa que es por celos.<br>  Por ejemplo: jamás le he revisado un bolsillo a mi pareja (hasta he metido su ropa al lavarropas con dinero adentro, jajaja), ni un papel, ni una agenda. Jamás le pregunto dónde estuvo: espero que él me cuente.<br>  Ahora bien: si está conmigo en un bar y hay una mujer que lo mira provocadora, yo reacciono. La gente piensa que son celos pero no es eso, es que siento que esa dama me está faltando el respeto: está muy bien que mire a mi pareja, porque es hermoso, PERO NO CUANDO ESTá CONMIGO, que espere a mirarlo cuando está solo...<br>  <br>  Eso es más o menos lo que te quiero transmitir desde alguien como yo que está segura de no ser celosa. Mi reacción no es ante los celos, sino ante la falta de respeto. Y a veces las cosas se confunden y no puedes estar explicándole esta cuestión a cada uno que te lo plantea. Más vale dices "sí, me puse celosa" y asunto concluido, jajaja. <br>  <br>  Besos. Coca.
ad9a8097ece16450ee189939ec720149aa	the most gentle way of getting off ones life is by not interfering with each others business's as much as possible..let him be on his own and be on your own. He can find alternatives if you are not around and you can do it as well..you can still be friends by saying hi and hello once in a while but that should also gradually decrease in frequency and if he asks why you don't do it as frequent as you used to.. then you can again find good excuses say you were busy with things that did not need his involvement nor his knowing what it was.. a simple *i mind my business..go ahead with yours..|`|0dfacf60ad12b322ac47d9c5674a3da7aa	The staying friends part might be a problem, because he might always see you as his "possession". Let him (set it up) catch you naked in bed with another man (or woman). That will throw him for a loop and show him that your not his anymore and don't want to be his "girlfriend" anymore.

Just do it in a public place and just give it to him straight (nothing insulting though). That should do it.

18d6471a7776fee390964857c48b68feaa	There could several reasons depending upon the severity of the lie and the person's personality:<br>  <br>  1. It could be just an "ego" thing and the person is puffing themselves up like a peacock. They want to exaggerate their qualities, but they genuinely believe in themselves. Their over-confidence is later exposed when they're in a relationship. When they've become exposed, they admit their exaggeration and things continue on as normal unless you end the relationship. This is very common, particularly with guys. <br>  <br>  2. A more serious issue is a self-image problem. The "real" person that they see themselves as is something they don't like so they've created a fictional self or show you a self that no longer exists. A common type is when you go online to meet people and their profiles have pictures of them when they were 20 years younger, had hair, weren't fat, etc. When you meet them in person, you find they are nothing like their picture. In dealing with these people, the best is to allow the one date and no longer continue in the relationship. Either these people face the facts of life or they just continue on their spiral down into a fictional world of their own creation.<br>  <br>  3. Another serious issue is someone who's been traumatized or has never fully developed in a mature way to have a meaningful relationship in that they live in a "fantasy land" of their ideal relationship and self-image. These people can be good liars and manipulators and sometimes even lead a double-life, but eventually are found out. <br>  <br>  How do you handle this if you're in a relationship? Well, evaluate the lie in terms of the relationship and ultimately whether you're truly happy with the "real" person. If you feel like the victim of fraud, then it's probably a good idea to move on. If you're just annoyed at the lie, then expose them and continue on with your relationship.|`|46501976c03bb4c7d233be1a091f1fa6aa	Is ther anyone in the relationship doing so.

It can be a very rewarding experience for both people if done right.|`|b4471c0dc1a0b131f920d608f2ade38aaa	Please do not change, no one likes to be dominated.<br>  <br>  The relation is usually give and take, you were just meeting wrong girls who do not know what is dominating.<br>  <br>  If they mean assertive then I would understand.

66ab7df22bcfe77022675962d5c4702baa	Pues a mi me encanta todo lo que tenga que ver con la decoracion osea que la decoracion es uno de mis temasfavoritos. Ok te voy a alludar. <br>  <br>  Mira limpia bien bonito el cuarto. Coloca la cama y todo en difernetes posisiones cosa que sea bien notable el cambio. Pon muchas velas aromaticas con olores que sepas que son de su agrado. Olores que sean suaves y romanticos pero que se dejen notar en la abitacion. Coloca las belas en puntos que no se vean muy basios en la abitacion cosa que se vea la abitacion con mas vida. Pon a bolumen suave una musica romantica que tu sepas que le gusta. Acomoda la cama que se vea divina como de revista. Suela petalos de rosas en sima de la cama yas como un caminito de rosas desde la puerta asta la cama. Pon unas cortinas bien bonitas y pero que ala misma ves se vean elegantes y romanticas que combinen con las frisas en la parte de atras de la cama asi no alla ventana hay pero eso va hacer que la cama sea el maximo sentro de atencion tambien  si hay ventanas puedes poner otras cortinas pero que no sean iguales a las que hay detras de tu cama pero que si agan juego con los colores. Que el close y todo este bien organisado cosa que todo se vea perfecto. Y asi todo seria super romantico y hermoso al mismo tiempo. <br>  <br>  No estaria mal que acomodaras toda tui casa para que toda tu casa se vea divina y al momento de llegar a la avitacion que la avitacion sea el santuario de todo lo hermaso que vio en su camino ala avitacion. Claro tu tambien tienes que verte divina para que puedas ser la reyna de ese santuario claro.<br>  <br>  Bueno mi amiga que tengas mucha suerte.|`|29dBBNQtaa	Te recomiendo algo que yo hize y me funciono???.<br>  No quiero tomar muchos detalles asi que ire al grano??<br>  COmpre una botella de Champagne ? me robe 2 copas de mi casa ??? y juntos en el Jacuzzy.....le di un masajito con aceite comestible??super y compre algunos juguetitos para distraernos?? se que eso no es muy romantico pero le encanto??? y todo lo adorne con corazones de fomy que dijeran frases lindas como "te amo" "eres genial" etc.|`|35f440cd645f07e3d8b23292526e2b87aa	Te recomiendo una lindas velas y algún sahumerio.<br>  Suerte!!!!|`|538f67477b6e5390bc7b1916f5602df5aa	Creo que si te ensayas hacerle un baile cachondo en el que te empieces a desnudar suavemente, y te le acerques insinuantemente pero no lo dejes que te toque, lo dejaras con la baba caida, ademas perfuma tu ambiente con velas aromaticas, incienso, petalos de rosa en la cama y un buen vino, veras que antes de que termines de bailar, el ya estara sobre de ti, comiendote a besos y tu pidele que el tambien te baile y se empiece a desnudar para que tambien tu disfrutes. Suerte picarona.|`|jm6bt1slaa	Pon petalos de rosas sobre la cama... musica suave... y ten listo un vino espumoso.... unas velitas aromaticas tambien serviran... suerte!|`|3a2b3c9c68382429c47e24c0bbc8e54baa	Lo mas recomendable como ya te lo han dicho casi todos son las velas aromaticas del aroma que a el mas le gusten para que solo los ilumine la luz de las velas los petalos de rosas un corazon en la cama con petalos yo lo hice a mi novio el tampo es muy romantico pero le facino es algo que no lo olvidara te lo aseguro. suerte y disfrutalo mucho|`|603212c8d6cdbc7a5b2f91315082b65aaa	mira no pienses solo en el tambien piensa en de vez en cuando el debe alagarte pero no se pon unas velitas k adornes no muchas por eso del calor o t vayas a incendiar las cobijas si tienes unas sabanas de seda rojas o una petalos regadillos eso del corset es muy buena idea y lo importante de todo es la seguridad d k tu tengas para sentirte bella y sensual suerte y veraz k todo saldra a las mil maravillas|`|RBwCk3xUaa	pues una opcion ponle un camino de petalos de rosas desde la entrada hasta llegar a la cama <br>  <br>  tambiente puede servir unas velas, algunas frutas,chantilli para que se lo untes en el cuerpo y despues tu lo retires...........etc..............|`|cc19b772b4f9e2ea602c97dbfaa349ddaa	ja.. tumba el techo para que vean las estrellas

mSRjCrDbaa	mira no tengo prejuicios con las personas casadas, pero te dire algo: ?no crees que le llamas la atencion por ser virgen y el ser casado? digo....el ya tiene esposa (y no se si hijos tambien) pero ?no crees que deberias decirle la verdad de que ya no eres virgen?<br>  veo algo complicada tu situacion con el pero si estan "enamorados" ambos podria pensar el en dejar a su esposa ?no crees? podrias comenzar con el pie derecho si las cosas las enderezas.<br>  "un hombre no valora a una mujer por su virginidad sino por sus sentimientos"|`|Mi399vaMaa	no tienes nada de que preocuparte si el te ama lo entenderá pero no creo que te ame ya que mencionas que es casado y piensa que a lo mejor y so lo a lo mejor esta contigo solo para ver que optiene y si tu le mencionaste que eres virgen pues mas. di le que no te entregaras a el hasta que este legalmente divorciado y vas aver que no te vuelve a ver y si lo hace tu entregate libremente ya que no sabes si realmente eres o no eres  claro siempre toma tus precauciones y cuidate,|`|P1iNFQGCaa	Hola Magu eso debiste pensarlo antes de mentirle, pero yo te aconsejaria que le hablaras de una vez si el te ama te entendera depronto si el sabe por otro lado va a ser peor|`|jm6bt1slaa	Creo que esa relacio esta bastante enredada... porque no te quitas de problemas y te buscas a otra persona que te aprecie mas que simplemente por ser virgen.... ademas es casado... solo quiere acoston... olvidalo y busca a alguiem mas.... suerte!|`|lGxIZZ9Eaa	SERIA MEJOR SI  TE PUSIERAS A PENSAR EN LO QUE REALMENTE QUIERES EN LA VIDA... <br>  TE VOY A CONTAR ALGO SOLO PARA QUE TE PONGAS A REFLEXIONAR...<br>  PUES YO ME ACOSTé CON UN HOMBRE QUE ERA CASADO.... EN REALIDAD YO SENTíA ALGO POR EL PERO PUES  YO NO QUERíA PERO LO HICE Y PUES POR COMETER ESE ERROR SALí DE QUE TENIA UNA ENFERMEDAD TRANSMITIDA SEXUALMENTE  (ETS), CLAMIDIA Y ESO FUE LO MAS HORRIBLE QUE ME PUDO HABER PASADO...

You could contact the police and they would get in trouble for battery or assault.<br>  <br>  If days have gone by and nothing has happened, then I'm sure nothing will happen.

God will answer you when the time, is right.  <br>  It's kinda like when your parent would have you in "timeout" when you were little.  As many times as you would ask, they'd still tell you "you must stay there for five minutes to think about what you did."  <br>  God's going to make you think about wht you did, and when He sees that you are truly sorry for flirting with your friends' boyfriends, then He will help out.<br>  <br>  I don't blame your friends for being mad at you though.  If some girl flirted with my boyfriend, I'd slap 'em.|`|Zg7MRAZgaa	just apologize and avoid them|`|abf01838f7f56e56f12a1a1b38b3eab9aa	Things happen for a reason,usually to teach us a lesson that hopefully we'll never forget.At this point in the school year you can do nothing but take the consequences and finish the year.Tell your mom what happened, be honest, if you feel you can't face those people next year,your parents may help you by moving you to another school.

Just think about all the bad things he/she did maybe that will help. Know that you'll find another person and hopefully better person. Think that maybe it WAS best u guys broke up. try to like another person. Maybe the break up was the right thing and that it's the only way for u both to be really happy. Also, You both can still be friends if u guys want. If u really love them, dont forget about them just let them go.|`|8iAdc5hIaa	theres no way to heal a broken heart.. except talking to him calmly and sincerely..

It's so hard to get moving when your heart is broken, but it helps your mood so much. <br>  <br>  Also, don't try to avoid the pain.

Take care of yourself the best you can for comfort (exercise, treat yourself to a massage, do things you enjoy, hang out with supportive friends, etc.) but in the end, time is the only thing that can heal your broken heart. <br>  <br>  If you're still having problems sleeping & eating in a few days, you might consider talking to your doctor.|`|LbpZcYQuaa	Call me up - I'm fun to talk to and my pic is at left.<br>  <br>  Steve|`|YMLt9O44aa	Go and have  fun !!

MP7XpLxQaa	La verdad yo difiero un poco con todo lo que ta han dicho. Yo te voy a contar mi experiencia. Mi ex era exactamente como tu dices y quise ser "bueno" con ella y dejarla pues sentia que no era "el amor de vida". La deje y fui en busca de ese "amor" que es mas fantasia que realidad. Han pasado los a?os y me doy cuenta que ella (si bien no era "perfecta") tenia todos los ingredientes para ser mi pareja "ideal". Mi sugerencia es "mas vale conocido que bueno por conocer", esta sugerencia que te doy, te la doy de corazon y en base a mi experiencia propia. Muchas veces nos vamos con ideas romanticas de que quizas nos estemos perdiendo de algo mejor y muchas veces no es asi. En esta indecision tuya creo que tambien juega un papel importante tu inmadurez, pues tienes a tu lado un verdadero "mujeron", y solo los hombres maduros y con experiencia nos damos cuenta que esa es la clase de mujer que nos pueden ayudar a construir un buen futuro. Amigo, en serio, no la dejes. Valora lo que tienes.

Once you get on regular talking terms w/ him then you can start flirting. things 2 try:<br>  1) go up to him and poke him. just poke him and say "poke!" and see what he does. (the reactions are usually funny) If he returns the poke, then that probably means that he likes you and things usually come naturally from there.<br>  2)if 1 doesnt work 4 u, then u can try getting him 2 kno u by finding a friend of yours that sits w/ him @ lunch. then start sitting @ his table. eventually he will have 2 start talking 2 u. it will probably start out w/ just small talk but the more time u spend w/ him the closer u will get.<br>  3) for hair, try to do something different every day and see which styles get the most attention. (pony tail (high + low) pigtails, a bun, chopsticks) get creative. <br>  also try your best to be relaxed and casual when you are arround him, you dont want to make it extremely obvious! Oh and dont stare 2 much it tends 2 make ppl uncomfortable<br>                 good luck!|`|f4aa45fb60b06518f8e7083999d11d6daa	a long stare and a smile it works|`|wDb6uAS8aa	That sounds like so much fun! Well...Wear your hair in different styles, play with your hair, flip your hair casually, act like you dont notice him (not ALL the time), say hi when you pass him in the hall, when he gives you that look just smile or wink (winks are GOLDEN), and take pride in yourself, be daring and assertive, if you want him let him know. "I like your shirt its hawt!" or "Your such a distraction in class - i love it" OR (hehe) "Did anyone ever tell you, you have the sexiest ______" Give him signs and signals. Brush past him and turn your head. Laugh at his jokes, give him hugs and I HIGHLY recommend saying stuff like "You and Me would look so hawt together. Have FUN girl...you wont regret it.

Tone in the french language are much more important than in english, and a word can have opposite meaning with a slight change of tone.

bebf8832f09ad102360d3f46d85d0f91aa	Child support is only based on the incomes of the parents, not step-parents or grandparents or neighbors.  <br>  <br>  Here in Florida it basically depends on how much each parent makes.  They calculate the total income of both parents and determine what percentage of their income goes to the child.  If they have equal incomes they are each responsible for 50%.  If he makes $15.00/hr and she makes $7.50 then he pays 66.67% and she's responsible for 33.33%.<br>  <br>  Here's a site that has calculators for each state.  <a href="http://www.divorcelawinfo.com/states.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcelawinfo.com/states.htm</a>|`|0352c1286e700033dfbf06ed42ccbafeaa	If the people can't work it out about child support, the courts would intervene and they would go based on the man's income and how many children he has, it shouldn't matter if she's remarried or not and have children with someone else or she works or not and if her new hubby can support them or not. The man has a child or children with a woman, he would and should pay child support no matter what, and if he doesn't do it willingly, they could and will garnish your wages and make sure you have a job to keep paying until the child's 18 or they will go to jail and they go by how much a guy makes and how much he is able to pay each month. Nothing else should matter!|`|AA11786758	Do you really NEED the support.  I mean, are you really hurting for the money?  If you do, then you need to contact your child support office.  There is no stead fast rule as to how they calculate the amount.  If the mother is not working, but is married, they will consider the amount the step-father is making.  <br>  I you don't NEED the money....I say let it go.  If the child is not old enough to know the father, then there is no reason to push the issue.  The child is probably better off only knowing the family it has.  Otherwise it is up to the parents.|`|ee601f6e69f12ff70e40b83bd42efd37aa	Check with the ATTORNEY General of the state|`|AA10610964	That is your child. You will be required to pay some support and it is determined by your income, how much you will need to survive. Although, she is remarried-that is still your child and legally he doesn't have to take care of the child unless you were not in the picture at all. But you can be absent, she can file for support and you can owe the system.Now it is starting to be a felony in some states, if you owe a certain amount. But guys get locked up over child support all the time.

uC7kGDXTaa	to be honest huni i'd speak to your friend about it first. it might be that she is completly over him or she might just be saying she hates him etc...cos she is hurt. She may still have very real feelings for him, in which case you should probably hold back and look after your friend, your friends should always come first, even if you do like him. Tell her you do, guage her reaction, also tell her that you won't make anymoves unless she's ok with it. <br>  <br>  <br>  also, you might want to look at wether this guy is that great in the first place, sometimes when we see our friends with a guy, we can develop a little jealousy related crush, look at why they broke up in the first place. if you REALLY like this guy my advice as ive said is to just stress this to your friend, and be as honest as possible. at least she will know she can trust you. <br>  <br>  good luck xx|`|4oFHuxMhaa	I would be careful about this.Even when girls get new boyfriends they are very territorial about exes.I lost a very good friend of mine because of this.She had a new bf and i talked to her about me dating her ex and she said that she was cool with it,but she wasn't so unless you can see it going long term or are willing to lose your friend i would say stay the hell away|`|7dc39af927c50401a0d239495b48b907aa	nah, go ahead and give it to him.  then if he likes it invite your friend over and both give it to him.|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	talk to her first, you might make her jealous if she is hurt. i made a move too fast one time and i made a big mistake but she forgave me and i broke it off with the guy. just be patient. there is a reason the jerk dumped her so why get yourself involved.|`|AA11252269	Has this guy given you signals that he might be interested in you? Unless you're willing to sacrifice your friendship, I would steer clear. Reverse the situation and ask how you would feel if you were her....|`|WIWpaFZzaa	Talk to your friend. Ask her how she would feel if you made a move. Wait til she's cooled off. But remember if he hurt your friend he could hurt you.|`|a6e4f3436d549ae9515a6c10880f06bcaa	People with some self respect & respect for others would abide by the code & NEVER mess with a friend's ex.|`|be3c2b7f248402b7a17505df96118197aa	DEFINATELY! dont jus make ur move yet..wait for about a month or about 3 week untill u do..becuz she needs some time to get ALL THE WAY over him!|`|AA11860478	Okay, there's the ideal rule and then there's reality.<br>  <br>  Ideal Rule:  They're broken up and nobody gets dibs on an ex.<br>  <br>  Reality:  Breakups hurt, seeing your friend dating your ex hurts.  I'm not recommending a course of action here.  I *AM* saying that making a move on her ex is likely to cause your friend pain.<br>  <br>  Do with that as you will.|`|424597f7ff3ec6bbd3d3f832bbdd725caa	Well how long have you been friends with her?? Is she a good friend? Would you miss hanging out with her? You need to ask yourself those questions. But if I was in your shoes I would wait Atleast a month or so and then just freakn go for it :)
UD4Mcsm2aa	The best way i have found to flirt is to give the person you want to flirt with a compliment.  Make sure you are being sincere...find something about them that really grabs your attention.  Tell them they have beautiful hair or eyes or smile or a really great laugh.  Then see how they react.  If they act like you are scum for complimenting them, you don't need them anyway.  If they thank you warmly, go from there.  The worst thing that will happen is that you will make them feel good.|`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	well by saying something that the other person gets it but not like anyone else. be like like say something nice cute and sexy which only that person gets!

Try to get along as much as you can with out killing each other|`|DVY8v74daa	not necessarily.. it just means you haven't met that right guy. when you do, you'll try like hell to impress them (even though you'll front like you don't care, you really do!) if your "right" guy is a family man, part of that relationship is dealing with his famille, like it or not. if he isn't the family man, then you're in luck! =)<br>  <br>  ps. maybe this is also some kind of phobia. meeting the family is usually an indication that the relationship is serious. are you sure you're not a "serious relationship-phobic" n that's why you don't wanna deal or meet the fam?|`|T6dLBfieaa	not necessarily. maybe your just a quiet person. that is something they would have to deal with.
UOmGvdHraa	Breakup is like a breavement. The splitee will go through the normal five stages of Grief, usually in the sequence<br>  "Denial",<br>  "Anger",<br>  "Bargaining",<br>  "Depression", and <br>  "Acceptance"<br>  <br>  It is your task to help them through anger, bargaining, and depression, to acceptance.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your splitee is currently in "Denial", so act 'seperate', ask productive questions, and frame the discussion making the split undeniable.<br>  <br>  "Have they considered the advantages of learning to deal constructively with disappointment?"<br>  <br>  "How are they going to adjust productively to the transition to an unattached lifestyle?"<br>  <br>  Anger will be a step forward, but don't let them intimidate you.<br>  <br>  Bargain will be a step forward, but they can bargain cajole and wheedle until they are blue in the face. You don't want to be with them. Case closed.<br>  <br>  Depression will be a step forward, but a difficult one to deal with.<br>  <br>  If you keep plugging away and don't weaken, they will get to acceptance.<br>  <br>  If they don't move through all these stages, they are left at some point on the "unresolved" continuum,  somewhere between "holding a torch for you" and "stalking". This would be bad.|`|b8wnqZPFaa	well its not abt her or his acceptance if things aren't working out and one of the partner wants to move out he/she is not obliged to stay just because the other guy/girl is not accepting the breakup|`|fxwsRwW4aa	May be the latter is too much attached with you, that not a simple task to make the person to realize the situation, if the person has a bad temped the work will be more complicated.<br>  Try to buy book for that topic, record(by using a recording camera)  your daily activities with each other thus you can show the latter that it is preferable to end up. Another solution is to give his the liberty so that the person can meet partners

SiI0e7IUaa	I am terribly sorry about your son. I found mine taking twelve vicodins through his nose last week . Unfortunately. I know what you are going through. I have been a drug couselor inNYC for 2 years and I am a recovering heroin addict for fifteen years. I believe your son is shooting vicodine and needs to check himself into a treatment place. Vicodine can be more addictivew than heroine and thus <br>  more dangerous.

It sounds like your son is in denial so see if you can get him into a Rehab Center as soon as possible.  GOOD LUCK

AA10182431	Personally I don't think you should give her money to carry around.  At most you might give her a few dollars for an emergency.  Kids having cash is a bad thing because other kids will try to take it plus you have no control over how they spend it.  It is better to teach them to save their money and to get by without needing money each week to waste on silly things.|`|c0613c67338f47cce651e9a8cdb06e10aa	$5 is plenty for a 10 yr. old, but don't just give it to her. I have my children do chores for their allowance. No chores no allowance. If you just give it to her, she will always expect it from you. We gave our kids $5 until about 13 or 14 then up to $10. My oldest has started driving now, so we have upped it to $15 for help with  gas, but with more money comes more responsibility. Teach her very early the value of a dollar and working and saving for the things she wants. It is a very valuable lesson that will help her greatly in the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|61cb2fe3483697ec9465abaa4e6c76a9aa	i suggest 10 dollars if your child spends to easily but 15 dollars if he likes to save.|`|7596b3777cb9dfdeef4ef3832d22065faa	We give our 8 year old $4 a week- a little more if he does REAL good in school.

First you should set up some chores for you daughter.  Then depending on the quality of her work, you should then give her money.  This teaches her the quality of a dollar.  That way she won't grow up thinking that life isn't handed to her, but instead she has to work for what she gets.  Have her doing thing like washing the dishes, vacuuming, and cleaning her room.  Then if everything is up to your standards, start her off with 5 dollars a week.  You can increase if you want to.  That's totally up to you.|`|badd52b4c781bf4fe677820819297171aa	Pocket money should be a reward for your child and not just an automatic allowance.<br>  If you give your child to much, she will want more because she knows its easily accessible.If you give her an amount that is average then she will learn how to save.<br>  Give her an amount that you know she can afford to buy sweets, ice-cream, toy, etc.

Lonliness can really get you feeling down.  It's time to get out and do some new things that perhaps you haven't done before now.  <br>  <br>  I lost a wife once early in life, and i had to broaden my horizons, i started doing something i'd not before like, attending play's, (theatrical performances), going to art show's, museums, farmer's markets and such, doing stuff i never did before.  I didn't hang out in bars and such, and i had to force myself to strike up conversations with women until i felt comfortable doing it.<br>  <br>  I even started attending a local church, and joined a group of people in my community that gathered for a dance every week.  <br>  <br>  You gotta move on, check in your local paper for weekly events and start attending them, you'll meet another lady and although she can never be a replacement for your wife you'll more than likely find one that is a good a mate as one could be.|`|821052a3c9565e918a401f5e49c4df12aa	Sorry to hear about your wife, have you got any other family.

Hope things get better for you.|`|AA10487044	Lonliness kills! this is what i believe if you do not take it as a problem and try to solve it. I am really sorry for your wife but as you can not bring her back..so try something on factual basis and be practical. Try to keep yourself busy in some hobby but if you are missing the company of a woman then do marry again. In my opinion, woman can only be replaced by a woman. So my sincere advice....get married soon!
U5CJLZNnaa	Death sucks but it's a part of life.  You would not be human if you did not miss her.  There are no easy solutions to grieving a loss such as this.  Perception is the key to making it easier.  Same goes for a failed marriage.  We spend time thinking about what we missed and should have done.  We forget that had we not been there in the first place what we would have missed.  In the end all we have is memories of what we had.  Bad memories tend to be more like poloroid film and fade with age.  Good memories are like profession studio prints that stand the test of time.  Don't think back and feel saddened by what we have lost.  Smile when you think of them because they could be watching.

fb735ba79376725108c611b12d935f0faa	Yes, men can be too shy to initiate a relationship. This can be a result of insecurity, social anxiety and a variety of other reasons. Some times shy men require a straightforward approach so that they know where they stand otherwise they are content to do nothing, so that they do not have to experience rejection.|`|e5364d247b36c73b275e1f1e4f4c07b9aa	yeah because they was suppose to get over that shyness before they became a grown man and i think that is just creepy if he is.

Talk to him, let him know that you're interested.  I am sure that you approaching him will take some of the pressure off of him trying to figure out how to approach you.
7894d7fb5a492f41b5131fac36536bc5aa	Here's how. Meet a girl somewhere and start talking, any girl, about anything. it's better if it's a girl you see everyday like at college. keep up the talkin, make her laugh, be a friend, but FEIGN A BIT OF DISINTREST, and sooner or later she'll open up those pants and let you touch really nice things. also, you could get a job where a lot of girls work.|`|AA10117642	You'll know when she's the one.

Any guy who is too worried about whether his friends will accept him for dating you is definitely not man enough to go out with you. But if you are head over heels with the guy and won't give up here are some tips... <br>  <br>  First, get to know his friends then when he asks them about you, you'll be on their good side..<br>  2ND, guys forget crap and if you told him that you liked him last year then he might think that you don't like him anymore tell him again. give him little hints.<br>  3rd if he wont ask you out and you are really brave, ask him! Go to the movies or the mall there's no telling what could happen.<br>  <br>  Lastly, color or race should make no difference and if he can't see past the skin then he himself is only skin deep...

If you really are concerned for him and not just your own needs, you should let suggest to him what changes he needs to make, and why. But DON'T EVER attack him with these suggestions, just sit him down and tell him how you feel.

280fcd14cbbbe24ed2da3dff2c6e0f08aa	First decide weather you are reading too much into it or not:<br>  when you went to the cinema, did you go alone or with a bunch of friends?<br>  did he invite you, or did you invite him? if he did, that's so cliche, but a good sign.<br>  does he choose to hang out with you, or make excuses to see you - another good sign.<br>  If you get tree positive answers here, then he is probably wondering the same thing as you!<br>  <br>  next, use body language:<br>  if you look at his pupils when you first meat up before going out, and they get bigger, it means that he is interested in you (its called a sympathetic responce - part of the nervous system to do with being nervous or shy). A positive here, and you go to step two. When crossing a busy road, go to take his hand. if he looks shocked but pleased or keeps hold of your hand, your on to a winner.<br>  but how do you make an advance? thats step 3:<br>  starting to talk to him about kissing is always a good one. Try talking about the kissing scene from one of the movies you go to see with him. "wow, that kiss looked so intense. have you ever kissed a girl?how was it?are you a good kisser".....and then some time latter "so, you want to show me?" If he says no, just smile seductively and say "I didn't say you could!". if he hesitates but looks keen say "lets see...." and move in for the kill! its a win, win situation, and always works for me!!!<br>  good luck Honey.|`|2b0fe83c68ac887d77ce1426c3a249a1aa	well if he always wants to meet up then yeah i think he does like you the thing probly is that he isn't a open-up guy which could be changed if u really like and care about him tell him let him no and in order to get himtalking more don't ask yes or no questions but ask him questions that he has to explain to u (like why doesn't he like something) it will get him to talk more trust me my friend has the same problems.  this helps|`|3dbd38d618c31ab623ef51583671b59baa	the best statement one of my guy friends ever said...<br>  <br>  "if a guy likes you, he will show you.

As for his off days which is making you confused about how he feels about you, the best thing i think you should do is ask him straight out how he feels. As you said he is shy, maybe it has to do with that, but asking him how he feels and telling him how you feel, then you will know for sure.|`|6b997470d04ee220d6dfc1203b9370f2aa	Ask him!

I say this because I have talked to people over the internet and over the phone, then met them, and they were not what my vision of them was. Especially if you are talking over the internet. They say 80% of communication is body langauge (and listening but that's another story) and there's alot you see about someone when you talk in person. Also, the longer you go without meeting them, the longer you have to build up a fantasy about what he/she is really like without knowing the reality. Don't give up, but keep your options open... Don't turn down getting to know others who may be the right one for you just to wait for someone you don't know as well as you may think you know.. Just my humble opinion...
70672f75b67529b1595becd4f512d877aa	The only way is to build a relationship on common interests and yes communication. Sex really just gets in the way.

Maybe that is why she is not responding to your email.  She might be too busy to respond or has forgotten the email or maybe she never received the email.  This does occur you know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  If you are so anxious to know how she feels then ask her when you see her.

THats not always the case.
AA11735349	The best thing to do is to talk to the bride and groom and ask what they're expecting of you.  What sort of wedding is it?  Is it a traditional, conservative, religious wedding or is it a bit more modern and relaxed?  <br>  <br>  MCs are there mostly to help fill in the gaps in the reception and introduce the various people who are making speeches.  They help keep things running smoothly on the day so the bride and groom don't have to worry!  So make sure you know exactly what role you're expected to serve - are you just introduicng people, or are you expected to liase with the people serving food etc? <br>  <br>  I recently attending a wedding of an old school friend and she got another friend of ours to MC.  However, it was a VERY bad choice because this friend was notorious for her dirty, overtly sexual sense of humour and, whilst she DID tone it down for the wedding, there were still a few too many jokes with obvious sexual innuendo.  PLUS, she made the ultimate mistake of wearing a WHITE dress that showed a LOT of cleavage and was well above the knee!<br>  <br>  Remember - it is your FRIEND'S big day, not yours, even though you will have the spotlight on you an awful lot.  It's not the day to reminisce about the time you got drunk and danced naked on a table or about the time your friend flashed a passing police car...  Keep jokes at your friend's expense out of it completely or at least to a bare minimum because, whilst they may seem funny to you, chances are the older members of the audience like the parents and other relatives of the newlyweds won't find them half as funny!<br>  <br>  You MUST talk to your friend about what they want you to do!  They've asked you to perform a role in their wedding, so obviously your friendship means a lot to them.  Keep that in mind - you don't want to lose your friendship because you made a bad speech!  Don't be embarrassed by asking your friend what they want you to do - chances are they will feel a lot more relaxed if they have some idea of what you are going to say!  <br>  <br>  When you know what your role is exactly and thereby, what you will be saying etc, WRITE IT OUT AND MEMORISE IT!!!  It looks DREADFUL if the MC is using notes!  Learn all the names of the bridal party, including the parents.  If anyone has an unusual name, ASK them how they pronounce it!  Don't be embarrassed - believe me, it's a lot less embarrassing to ask before hand than to get it wrong on the day in front of their friends and family who will all know you've mucked it up!  Get an order of the day's events from your friend - find out when the food is being served and how many courses there are.  Find out who is making a speech and talk to each of them in turn and find out how long they think they will speak.  Write it out with approximate times and then write in when you need to be ready and who you're introducing.  And don't forget to thank the person who has just spoken!<br>  <br>  I suggest you wear a watch so you can have some idea of how long you have until you need to be ready.  Be prepared to not get to finish your meal - you will be doing a lot of standing up and sitting down, so make sure you eat before you go do you don't  feel hungry!  Don't drink too much as you will only embarrass yourself and your friend.  Find out from your friend where you will be sitting and take your list of timings with you and leave it at your seat.  That way you can do a quick double check on who is speaking and such before you get up, but it isn't as obvious as holding a page of notes when you're standing!<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything and remember to ask questions and practise everything! :)|`|72a981381d3e6ae7fc59befb5e0bf159aa	your speech should just to introduce the father of the bride, or the best man, or whoever to do the "real" speech.  otherwise, your speech as the dj should be to introduce tyhem to their first song only.

I’d like to begin, by congratulating Alex, Stephanie, Briony, Natalie and Blythe. <br>  I don’t think you could find five more wonderful looking bridesmaids, and I’m sure you’ll agree, they have all carried out their duties superbly!<br>  <br>  You will be pleased to learn that I'm only going to speak for a few of minutes because of my throat … … <br>  If I go on too long, Lesley's threatened to cut it … … <br>  <br>  A quick word about our Bride. Lesley is an Edinburgh lass. Edinburgh of course is Scotland’s capital city. Famous for it’s beautiful women and it’s rugby teams. (Turn to Lesley) What position was it you played?<br>  <br>  Now during speeches of this type, 50% of what you will hear is the truth & 50% is pure unadulterated rubbish … … so this evening it is my intention to reverse those statistics.<br>  <br>  Now we want everyone to feel welcome so are there any English with us today? … … good … … welcome to civilisation.<br>  <br>  I have actually had to speak at 3 functions already this week. On Monday it was the West Lothian Ex-offenders and Electronic-tagging club, Wednesday was the Broxburn Transvestite and Cross-dressing society and yesterday at the Livingston branch of Alcoholics Anonymous. So for those of you that have heard me already this week, please accept my apologies.<br>  <br>  Firstly a couple of apologies. Great uncle Hector was hoping to attend, but as he was coming out today he fell down the stairs, landed on the Hoover and it jammed fairly & squarely right up his ‘glutimus maximus’. However I have phoned the hospital and they assure me he’s picking up nicely!<br>  <br>  Berti Vogts was invited too, but he couldn’t manage … … <br>  <br>  Paula Radcliffe couldn’t make it … …<br>  <br>  But on a sad note … … <br>  Tony, the local ice-cream man, was due to attend today, but he was discovered dead this morning. He was found covered in raspberry sauce and hundreds and thousands. Police believe he topped himself! <br>  <br>  Anyway I digress … …<br>  <br>  Now, what can one say about a man who came from humble beginnings and is now quickly rising to the very top of his profession based on intelligence, grit and the willpower to push on where others might fail? A man who is beginning to distinguish himself amongst his peers and where none can say a bad word against him? Well, that's enough about me.<br>  I'm here to talk about Alvis.<br>  <br>  When the bold Alvis asked me if I believed in free speech … … I said of course I do … … “good!” he replied “your right in my price range”.<br>  <br>  I asked Alvis what he wanted to get from this marriage. He said, "Well, I want to be a model husband, and a model lover!" So, being the inquisitive sort, I looked up "model" in the dictionary. It said "A miniature replica of the real thing!"<br>  <br>  Alvis was born on the 4th July, 1963. He wasn’t the prettiest baby. In fact his mother didn’t get morning sickness until after he was born.<br>  <br>  He was nearly called Friday because when his parents saw him they thought they had better call it a day.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I didn’t know Alvis during his formative years.<br>  <br>  I’m reliably informed that he wasn’t like the rest of the 4 year olds at nursery … … he was 9 at the time!<br>  <br>  He was an ideal pupil, who excelled in most subjects … … Sorry that should read:<br>  “He was an idle pupil, who was expelled from most subjects”!!!!!!<br>  <br>  No seriously, Alvis was an exceptionally gifted student at school. <br>  On one particular day, the teacher asked little Alvis if he knew his numbers.<br>  "Yes," he said. "I do. My Dad taught me."<br>  "Good. What comes after three?"<br>  "Four," answers little Alvis.<br>  "What comes after six?"<br>  "Seven." "Very good", says the teacher. "Your dad did a really good job.<br>  What comes after ten?"<br>  "The Jack"<br>  <br>  Within the Multi-national world of mobile car cleaners, Alvis is known as ‘The Rhino’ … … because he is thick-skinned & charges a lot. <br>  <br>  They tell me he does the work of two men … … Laurel and Hardy! <br>  <br>  He has the physique of a Greek statue … … but with fewer moves … …<br>  <br>  I had to speak to Alvis urgently last week. So I phoned him & said, “get up here & fast” … … so he duly arrived and didn’t eat for 3 days. <br>  <br>  I went round to his father’s house the other day, and to my astonishment Alvis (Jr) answered the door with a large Monte-cristo cigar in one hand and a huge vintage brandy in the other. I said, “Is your Dad in?” <br>  He replied “What do you bloody think?”<br>  <br>  A particular type of woman says to Alvis “I’ll do anything you want for ￡30 if you can name it in 3 words” … … quick as a flash Alvis says, “Paint ma hoose”<br>  <br>  When Alvis first took up Salsa, he wanted to get himself as fit as possible. So he hired a personal trainer and asked "Can you teach me to do the splits?" He said, "How flexible are you?" Alvis replied, "I canny make Mondays or Thursdays".<br>  <br>  Right … … My friendship with Alvis has grown out of our membership of Boghall and Bathgate Caledonia Pipe Band. <br>  <br>  One of my early memories of Alvis was on a band trip. Our plane passed through a severe storm.<br>  The turbulence was awful, and things went from bad to worse when one wing was struck by lightning.<br>  One woman sitting in the front of the plane loses it. Screaming, she stands up in the front of the plane. "I'm too young to die," she wails.<br>  "If I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! Is there anyone on this plane who can make me feel like a Woman?"<br>  For a moment there is absolute silence. <br>  Then, Alvis stands up at the rear of the plane. He starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt - one button at a time … … He removes his shirt.<br>  "Here ya go luv - iron this then get me a beer!" <br>  <br>  On another trip, we were on a Paris to Prestwick flight. A man of Arabic appearance got off the plane and Alvis noticed that he had left his bag behind. He grabbed the bag and ran after him, caught up with him in the terminal and handed him back his bag. He was extremely grateful and reached into his <br>  bag, which appeared to contain large bundles of money. He looked around to make sure nobody was looking and whispered "I can never repay your kindness, but I will try to … … a word of advice: Stay away from Bathgate".<br>  Alvis was genuinely terrified. "Is there going to be a terrorist attack?" he asked him. "No … … ”, he whispered back “ … … It's a ****hole."<br>  <br>  He was sent down to London to play at a function. On returning, I asked how he got on. “The function was fine.” he replied. “But those Londoners are a strange sort. They were outside my hotel room shouting and banging on my door until 3 o’clock in the morning”. “What did you do?”, I asked. “Och, I just ignored them and kept on playing my pipes.” <br>  <br>  He was asked the other day what he kept underneath his kilt. In typically modest fashion he replied … … underneath ma kilt av got a perch that would hold 36 budgies … … what he didn’t add was that they were all on each others shoulders … … and the one at the bottom had only one leg!<br>  <br>  We were in North Wales once – Anglesey, to be exact. Approaching <br>  Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwl...<br>  (Clanfair-pool-gowin-jill-gogery-cherw... <br>  We started arguing about the pronunciation of that particular town's name. <br>  We were arguing back and forth until we eventually decided to stop for lunch. We stood at the counter and Alvis asked the employee, "Before we order, could you please settle an argument for us? Would you pronounce where we are … … very slowly?"<br>  The lassie leaned over the counter and said, "Burrrrrrr, Gerrrrrrr, Kiiiiiiing."<br>  <br>  Alvis and I played in the band at the re-opening of the Scottish Parliament. <br>  This was when Alvis was introduced to the Queen, when he turns round and says: "As we now have devolution, I think we should become a Kingdom and that I should be King"<br>  The Queen replies "I'm sorry Mr Kerr, but to be a Kingdom, you have to have a King in charge - and you're really not a King."<br>  Alvis thought a while and then said: "How about a Principality then?"<br>  To which the Queen replied "Again, to be a Principality you have to be a Prince - and you're really not a Prince ".<br>  Alvis thought long and hard and came up with "How about an Empire then?" <br>  The Queen, getting a little annoyed by now, replies " Look Kerr, to be an Empire you must have an Emperor in charge - and you are not an Emperor."<br>  Before Alvis could utter another word, The Queen said, "I think you're doing quite nicely as a Country".<br>  Alvis, we have had some excellent times together and I know that we will continue to do so in the future. You are a great friend, and it is a true honour to have been your best man today.<br>  <br>  On that note, Ladies and Gentlemen, it now gives me great pleasure to invite you all to stand and raise your glasses in a toast to Alvis and Lesley. <br>  <br>  May the best you’ve ever seen, be the worst you’ll ever see,<br>  May a moose ne’er leave yer girnal, wi a tear-drap in its e’e,<br>  May ye aye keep hale an hearty ‘till ye’re auld enough to dee,<br>  May ye aye be just as happy, as i wish ye aye tae be!<br>  <br>  We wish them well for the future and hope they enjoy a long and happy marriage. <br>  <br>  The new Mr and Mrs Kerr … … The bride & groom!

If she talks to you, u know she has an interest, if she is short with her answers and is somewhat un-friendly, say "cool, was just wonderin" and walk away.<br>  <br>  I like guys that are out going and start a conversation.

That is how most men get caught up having a child. The woman wants a child so she says she forgot her birth control pill and she ends up pregnant and it use to be the man had to marry her. So if you want this guy to trust you then stop forgetting the pill or switch over to another form of birth contol like the shot you get instead if you cannot remember to take the pill. At least he knows he is not ready to handle being a father which I give him credit for knowing this and now you have to do something about a form of birth control that he will trust. Talk to him about it and maybe he can help you figure out what the best form of birth contol would be so you do not end up pregnant. You cannot blame him for feeling that way if you put yourself in his shoes. Maybe the two of you could check in with planned parenting agency in your area for help with birth control.

I've been in the same situation.. she doesn't want to hurry things and fall in love again with the wrong person. getting out of a bad relationship is not that easy.. so the next time she will go into a relationship, she wants to be sure that she is picking the right person this time. If she experienced battery by a former husband then probably she's still suffering from a trauma/fear that it will happen again. So if you really love her then be patient, show her that you're not like the other guys, the key is to earn her trust.:)

3c603979847954846dcb300d03038f3caa	you can not change or try to stifle some ones sexuality so you either have to accept this part of him and be willing to share or realize at some point he will want to act on these feelings and will do so either behind your back or after your his ex so you need to do some serious thinking about this and talk to him and see if this is truly something he wants to do it sounds like he does and if so then you may need to take a brake so he can go out and explore this part of him self and see what happens but in the end you will not be able to put the genie back in the bottle once its let out and even if you tell him he cant it wont change him wanting to!|`|WUWng6kqaa	That's cheating on you, my dear.

QrgAriQgaa	I'm in the same situation as you.  I'm 23 and I've know her since kindergarten.  It's tough because of who that person is and how they have been such an impact on your life. Whatever happens, happens.  Your not going to find a right answer here.|`|b94819a8862601858e3d8ce1adce63a2aa	I've been there, trust me. My former best friend and I had been inseparable since kindergarten, and did everything together from that time on until we were in our mid teens. She made some not so great decisions, and I decided I couldn't surround myself with negativity. People grow, and when you reach a certain age, you really come into your own, and become who you want to be, and it may not be that she doesn't like you anymore, or you don't like her, but maybe its just that you're growing in separate directions, and there is nothing wrong with that. As you grow, you become who you are, and that changes friendships , but creates new ones. If it's a truly solid friendship, you'll never stop finding things to talk about no matter what, and if you do,you'll always be friends, maybe just not as close as you once were.That's part of life, and you'll meet someone you can spend your time with and not grow apart from. Although i do hope you stay close with this friend, people do change, for good, or worse. I really hope it works out.|`|AA12326689	tell her and you two slove the problem.dun be angry with each other and gently tell u fren the problem.|`|46dd9abfa33f748ae2fa6e0e94573f6baa	Sometimes inevidable in the process of growing up. It takes effort from both parties to maintain a friendship. Try meeting up & chatting with her more often, but if you don't feel that she recipocrating your efforts, then I guess you'll just need to accept that this is part & parcel of growing up. Gd luck! =D|`|4b5QfFP3aa	maintaining a friendship over so long a period of time is a hard thing to manage, and I commend your efforts for trying.  It is very common to grow out of these early childhood friendships, but it doesn't have to happen.  As others have said, it is very important that you talk to her.  Try to find out what common interests you might still share.  If she is interested int hings you are not, try them out, you might find something new to occupy your time and revive a flagging friendship at the same time.|`|93a8da15233394947444eb804f4a852aaa	I also have a best friend who i've been BFs with since grade two, we do tend to drift, but we could never not be friends since we're so tight, but that's probably not the answer you wanted lol, just make an extra effort, call her up on the phone, chat on IMs, hang out more and stuff, don't worry, if you've been friends for a long time, then i'm sure it'll work itself out ;) Hope I helped <3|`|P2Lqm5nUaa	I know that feeling. You need to sit down with her and let her know how you feel. Sometimes people get busy. If she really is your best friend, she'll understand and do things to improve your relationship.

vQs9jSApaa	Get to know him...you never know there might be something that will completely change your mind about him and then again if you have alot of things in common then see if he'd ever want to hang out with you.  Be yourself and don't ignore his friends because they will influence his decision, but if he doesn't like you for who you are then he's not worth it.|`|k8fJ1XM2aa	be respectable,just because guys look at sluts doesn't mean they could love one.|`|9b23320290c62f7e3c98c5ee885e52b6aa	the things that he likes to do that way he'll think u have a lot in common or<br>  find out what he likes and if u like the same thing do them together|`|Ux8Mcq1naa	You can't MAKE anyone feel ANYTHiNG for you. You have to focus on being yourself, especially when it gets easy for you to turn into someone you're not when you're around super hot guys or old crushes, but you have to keep on being you. Eventually, that lucky guy will come around and realize that you're the one he's been praying and looking for, and you can be the awesome, amazing you and not worry that you can't be yourself around him. Just keep on being patient and you'll find someone! <3

For example if they know a lot about cars, ask them to help you change your oil or install a stereo or something.  If they know a lot about computers, back up your hard drive and then crash your computer somehow and ask them to help you fix it.  If they know an instrument, ask for a little lesson just for fun.  If the love basketball, ask to play a game of hoarse or something.<br>  <br>  Also, things of this nature dont just get attention, they get you time with the person.  They are not awkward situations, since there is a purpose and a goal involved, which makes it more relaxed and natural for both parties.  This invitably leads to everyone having more fun, and cultivatiing some sort of relationship that is easier to build on.<br>  <br>  Just pick something they know, and ask for them to teach you.  Forget the fear, be vulnerable for a minute, and you will be amazed at what can result.|`|AA12200367	interact w/ him ask him questions 'whats ur fav. sport' things like that let him kno ur interested....|`|AA10927236	say "hey gimme ur attention"

Soy abogada, era feliz antes del matrimonio, peeeeeero, queria tener un hijo y no querìa que naciera fuera del matrimonio, pero me casè y ni siquiera me dio tiempo de tener uno porque tuve que dejar a mi ex porque tenia un caracter insoportable.<br>  No te cases si no estas seguro de amarla, no te cases por compromiso o por costumbre, no te hagas infeliz y no la hagas a ella infeliz.<br>  Yo te aconsejo que platiquen, sean sinceros, terminen bien, con serenidad, ya veras que ambos encontraràn la felicidad con las personas afines y adecuadas.|`|0US4Wnn0aa	llegar al matrimonio es por amor sentir que quieren estar juntos tener una familia, dos anos de noviazgo es un tiempo considerado, si están con duda den se un tiempo so dos semanas sin verse, haber sin se extra?an y así toman la decicion ustedes dos porque es importante tener comunicación.<br>  Suerte.|`|3VvFeDQ5aa	creo que si tiras la pregunta es porque tienes muchas dudas!.<br>  Es valido que les pase eso y aun asi no suelten puesto que al estar mucho con alguien que le puedes guardar un cari?o comienzas a compartir otras cosas y el lazo de ternura y amistad se mantiene, sin embargo no creo que sea necesario forzar un compromiso que no es necesario hacer, para que hacer mas cosas?, creo que con el tiempo sabras bien que te ocurre sino eres tu solo busca ayuda puede ser familia o un psicologoco a quien le puedas contar que pasa, no es grave, Quizas sea bueno preguntarse el porque mencionar la palabra matrimonio ?presion social o un tema nuevo para hacer algo distinto?|`|4c88bb57501f9a085c11aad775b856feaa	No le des tantas vueltas sino estas seguro no te cases, cuando uno lo quiere lo siente y no lo piensa tanto, cuando ya esta muy hablado y pensado este tema ya no funciona, mejor si no ven que esto tenga futuro terminen la relacion y sigan con sus vidas y te aseguro que ambos van a encontrar a la persona indicada en el momento indicado y tu te vas a dar cuenta de eso pues no te costara ningun trabajo tomar la decision de comprometerte.|`|4tT4w93Uaa	No te cases, no cometas el mayor error de tu vida, evítate y evítale sufrimientos a ella.

Al final de lo que se trata es de calidad de relación, más que de cantidad. Que para ti es importantísimo el sexo y para él "no lo es tanto" no significa que a él no le guste tener sexo, sino que desea tener una relación de mayor calidad contigo, donde compartir otras cosas resulte más agradable y si después caba el sexo, pues perfecto. No te tienes que sentirte mal por eso, ni pensar que no te quiere. <br>  Ahora bien, creo que tienes que revisar dentro de tí, qué es lo que verdaderamente quieres, porque no se por qué se me hace, que tu sólo lo que quieres es sexo y no debes estar muy enamorada de tu novio.  Piénsalo. Lo más probable es que estén ante un conflicto de intereses de cómo cada uno de ustedes concibe las relaciones de pareja. <br>  Sin embargo Chiki_ta, haces muy mal con eso de "exigirle" o con ponerlo en la disyuntiva de que "o te da más fiestas o lo mandas de paseo". Apréndete algo. "El afecto no se obliga", nada obligado gusta y cuando tu pones a una persona entre la espada y la pared a que elija entre una cosa u otra, generalmente la que sale perdiendo eres tu. Si tu le sales a tu novio con esos de que  " o me das más fiestas o chao" el te va a decir "chao" y habrás conseguido el efecto contrario. Te habrá mandado él a freir monos a tí, y te quedas sin el chivo y sin el mecate. ?Si me comprendes?<br>  Chiki_ta, "el que quiere besar, busca la boca" y si "mahoma no va a la monta?a, la monta?a ira a Mahoma". Eso de que no lo sabes expresar porque no es fácil y de que no consigues tiempo, es una simple excusa que tu te pones, porque lo más comodo para tí, es hacer las cosas a la brava, y créeme, vas a salir perdiendo tu. El tiempo, momento y lugar, siempre se consiguen. No pretendas obligar a nadie a hacer algo como quien le pone un pistola en el cuello al otro.<br>  Revisa primero, si lo único que quieres con él es sexo, porque no se que edad tienes tu, pero, se me hace que las mujeres en la actualidad, tienen un despertar sexual prematuro según mi óptica y se presionan demasiado para iniciarse en el sexo, casi de manera instintiva, sin pensarlo dos veces y es allí donde vienen los problemas. <br>  El sexo es una cosa demasiado sublime y encantadora, divina y no se compara con nada, como para tenerlo, por tenerlo, porque si, por tener en tu cuenta personal, una cantidad de hombres con los cuales te has acostado, en fin. <br>  Deténte un poco a pensar en lo que te digo, reflexiona primero sobre qué es lo que tu realmente quieres. Si en realidad quieres a tu novio, convérsalo con él clara, llana y fráncamente, sin meterle presiones innecesarias, con las cuales resultarás perjudicada. Una vez que tengas claro qué es lo que tu quieres y qué es lo que él en efecto espera de la relación contigo, entonces, sopesa ambas cosas y tomas una decisión. <br>  Mientras, trata de calmar un poco tus impulsos que a la primera que no le hace bien esa forma de actuar es a ti. <br>  Y créeme, no soy una mojigata, a mi me gusta el sexo, me parece fabuloso, pero no pretendo obligar a nadie a que se acueste conmigo por que si. <br>  Te deseo suerte.|`|fe02652b0fa5053fe735f97def937b16aa	Para mi es un 60% de la relacion, un 20% el amor y 10% el dinero|`|jm6bt1slaa	Tal vez tiene miedo a un embarazo... o tiene algun problemita... lo mejor es hablar directamente con el y decirle lo que te esta inquietando

Lo más seguro es que ella haya conocido a alguien más con quien se sienta muy bien y se haya dado cuenta o simplemente haya decidido alejarse de ti porque  se siente mejor con la otra persona o quiere "intentar" algo con él. Si dices que es fría y hasta grosera yo creo que es mejor que te valores un poco y dejes de buscarla; se que es muy dificil hacerlo cuando amas a la persona, sin embargo tu derecho de pedir una oportunidad en la relación  o una explicación se minimiza cuando está en juego tu dignidad. Además; las mujeres (algunas y en ocasiones) solemos  no soportar  la indiferencia de un chico que se ha relacionado con nosotros o que por lo menos ha mostrado interés; así que si ella en el fondo  te quiere en el momento en que empiece a notar tu cambio será quien te busque; si no es así entonces significa que no le interesas y lo mejor será que te olvides de ella. animo y suerte!!|`|Mi399vaMaa	por lo que escribes siento que ya no le interesas pero si tu crees que si entonces dejala un tiempo dale su espacio, ya no le escribas si te saluda saludala si no pues no, no la llames por telefono y si puedes que lo dudo se indiferente hacia ella y veras que si todavia quiere algo con tigo se preopcupara y te busca pero si no te busca es que ya no te quiere.........olvidala suerte.|`|ZeBtGqLfaa	ya dejala en paz y siguele co otra....|`|jm6bt1slaa	Yo creo amigo mio que nunca ye quiso de verdad, y tal vez conocio a alguien mas y por eso ya no le interesas y hasta grosera es.... mejor olvidala... busca a alguien que valore tus sentimientos

2U54ptyHaa	hola interesante tu pregunta, bueno aca respondiendo al menos intentaré algo... creo que es posible, depende de los dos como factor primordial, creo que en muchas sociedades existe aun esa mania de no tener relaciones hasta cuando uno se case y eso pasa con mujeres y hombres o seguro es un temor por falta de seguridad y comodidad, pero eso de que es un complemento el      es correcto pero no es lo primordial, porque de que vale estar con alguien que supuestamente te pueda atraer como para ir a la cama y luego terminas enamorandote y cuando estas asi y vas conociendo a la personas sientes que no fue la indiada o indicado, uno se sentiria morir y creo que siempre es primero conocerce y luego explorarse. respondeme ok y cuentame mas.adriana.|`|0f6c75fd756f739104f8e234f9aa4052aa	si amas alguien sabras esperar hasta que sienta los mismos deceos de tener sexo|`|CwerbkA4aa	Es difícil, yo particularmente no puedo contener mis deseos.

Saluditos.|`|GOC93AB3aa	si me imagino, porque no???, yo dure 5 a~nos con un chico y comenzamos a tener sexo después q pasaron 4a~nos luego me enga?o con una prima y nos separamos. jajaja después conocí al hombre q ahora es mi esposo enseguida hicimos el amor y a los 2 meses nos casamos preferí hacerlo rápido para q no me pasara lo mismo  y me dije pa` que madurar cambur pa` que otra se lo coma, noooooo que va jajajaj, bueno ahora tenemos 10 a~nos juntos y 2 bellos hijos, debes tenerle paciencia eso llega solito,algunas lo buscamos y otras lo esperamos|`|TEhc87Sfaa	en el noviazgo asi debe de ser, pues lo ideal es llegar al matrimonio inocente de eso por lo menos, esque es como chapado a la antigua pero que hermoso debe de ser llegar al matrimonio inocente. no estoy generalizando yo no pude pero me imagino que si mi novia la que es ahora mi esposa no hubiera querido tener nada conmigo hasta estar casados creo que hubiera respetado esa decicion de ella, pero si el amor es grande el sexo lo complementa y te dejas llevar por la pasion y derrepente te das cuenta de que ya metiste la pata pero igualmente lo disfrutas porque estas con la persona con la que vas a pasar el resto de tu vida. mi punto es que por amor lo haces y por amor te aguntas porque AMOR ES RESPETAR LO QUE TU PAREJA QUIERE.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|UwImbmLPaa	Es dificil, pero si han comenzado desde el principio a hablar claro el tema, no es imposible, ya q' es como un pacto entre ambos.

No, definitivamente no estaría con una chica que me matase de hambre en ese sentido.

c4add1bd7da1a048ce8929e9ba773ab5aa	Hi Angel....Sometimes we get thrown reasons that aren't very good ones but to the person that has given those reasons. Sometimes a person will give you a reason but not for the real reason at hand. In other words, your bf might be telling you one thing but actually has other intentions. Also, maybe he can't cope with other problems at home or at school to where he can't deal with everything at once so he tries to delete the ones that he see's fit. Whatever the reason is for, your bf  thought is was important to where he had to let you go. My suggestion would be, give him some space for awhile. Sometimes distance makes the heart grow fonder within time. Then again, I hate to say this but would he be interested in someone else? This is another possibility you might want to think about. If your bf is determined to break your relationship off then he's got other intentions in mind. Hope this has helped. Have a blessed day!|`|ezIvXoHyaa	why dont u ask him what the problem is? but if u dont wanna go into deep on the matter, why dont u just leave it and move on try and find urself someone that wont dump u twice|`|f61ae0038c0c5527bd9e8bbadb3b9437aa	Take his advice.

Mira no creo que sea mal que seas asi, incluso es una ventanaja para que te cuides de lo que te puede pasar pero eso si el defecto de eso es que para confiar en una persona nunca hay como cerrar los ojos y tirar al vacia si haces esto de vez en cuando encontraras muchas cosas sorprendentes en tu vida No te lo niego puede que hasta mas deseociones pero lo que no te mata te hace mas fuerte y al aunyentar a las personas desaprovechas esta oportunidad de aprender, Te gusta que te escuchen eso esta bien, simplemente tambien aprende a escuchar y veras por que lo haces tu Un saludo enorme y suerte en todo bye|`|2WdWiHOIaa	No eres pensativo o analítico. Eres desconfiado.|`|4lOqQX4uaa	No creo que esté mal que seas analitico, eso a veces ayuda mucho para resolver los problemas y entender lo que pasa en nuestras vidas. También el platicar con alguien de confianza ayuda a descargar un poco lo que sentimos y nos agobia.<br>  Pero tambien si solo te concentras en pensar en el pasado, eso no te ayudara mucho para enfrentar los problemas del presente. Siempre hay que tener un equilibrio.|`|6D15qyeJaa	pero debes de fijarte con que tipo de personas hablas sobre lo que te a pasado, no a cualquier personas puedes estarel comentando por lo que haz pasado|`|ZtjRMhAtaa	NO SE DE QUIEN SEA ESTE PENSAMIENTO<br>  PERO ES BUENO (EL AYER YA SE FUE ,EL MA?ANA NO SABES SI VENDRA, VIVE EL HOY COMO SI FUERA EL ULTIMO DE TU VIDA)|`|0c0aad143bf33206e506a492d6196c71aa	yo se k necesitas hablar d ello por lo k t ha pasado pero ya paso a  mi tambien m han pasado cosas horriblles pero si quieres k no t hagan mucho dano no hables tanto d ello pero es bueno k t desahoges|`|b3f53f352d24c397d4d5d7fd63538cc7aa	mira no es malo que saque lo que te paso y lo que sientes pero tampoco es para que se lo cuaentes a la gente a todo momento los puedes llegar a hacer sentir incomodos <br>  ahora claro que si te paso algo malo es normal que lo quieras  sacar pero hay que saber con quien <br>  ahora tambien ya paso y aunque haya sido de lo peor no es bueno que te quedes aferrado a lo que paso por que igual solo te afectas tu y no es bueno acuerdate que la vida sigue y tienes mucho por vivir <br>  busca ayuda y sigue adelante <br>  suerte bye|`|mgryAzjMaa	Pues yo te recomiendo que lo hagas con un psicólogo ya que el te puede ayudar a encontrar los puntos que necesitas para poder superar esto, en verdad hazlo es lo mejor que puedes hacer por ti. Deja que los expertos hagan su trabajo. y el hecho de que seas pensativo y analítico no es malo, claro que no, esa es una característica tuya y es más es algo que puedes aprovechar para ti misma yo soy así como dices pensativo y analítico y eso me ha llevado a tener muchos éxitos, por el contrario veo a personas que hacen y dicen cosas así como lo sienten y al momento y a veces no es lo mejor. Lo mejor es ser uno mismo como somos y aceptarnos así.

En ocaciones sientes un sentimientos de odio hacia tu persona al estar cerca, aunque tu no deces algo malo, si eres perceptivo/a sientes algo: incomodidad, agresión, etc. <br>  <br>  Del mismo modo pasa al estar cerca de un ser querido. No hace falta hablar (sin embargo a veces se confunde con una fijación corporal: te gusta el cuerpo y aunque te trate mal esperas que reacciones algun dia y cambie), solo tienes que sentir y observar los peque?os detalles.<br>  <br>  Si una persona es insegura, claro que ayudará el decir "te quiero" ó "Te amo" asi sentira que valen esas palabras; pero las palabras se las lleva el viento, y en ocaciones el amor es algo pasajero (como la ilusión de amor).<br>  <br>   Sin embargo creo yo que valen mas los hechos que las palabras; es decir si te dice "te quiero" y te golpea ó trata mal, es una concepcióndistinta de de querer. ó simplemente con ocultar la verdad y decir "Te amo", creo yo que el amor y la verdad es algo paralelo dentro de una relación. <br>  <br>   En el caso contrario que encuentres alguien que no te dice "Te amo" pero te trata bien, sientes su cari?o, tiene detalles especiales contigo; quiza es solo que no esta preparado para decirlas palabras y solo es cuestión de tiempo. Yo en lo personal esperaria tiempo.|`|ZZRFiah0aa	no unicamente con ungesto de amor, por ejemplo con un ramo de flores, una frase bonita, un poema etc. se le puede expresar a otra persona lo que se siente por ella, sin necesidad de decir te amo o te quiero|`|bKc5NUHlaa	Creo que hay que demostrarlo con acciones y tambien con palabras. Asi que si , es necesario.|`|dhdyh3tJaa	no es necesario del todo .aunque si lo sientes de verdad es bonito decirlo de todas formas una persona sabe si te quiere solo mirándola a los ojos  con gestos y palabras eso es mas bonito todavía que decir te quiero
410b06f56b4160baef435c7ade19f121aa	Well I am big on sentimental.  I would go for a really sappy card and write something really sweet inside.  I have gotten my man clothes before and he really liked that.  If they are gamers and you can afford it whatever videogame they are longing after works well.  You can print off some of thos couplons that say "good for one back rub' or 'good for one hug' and toss that in there, too.  You will think of something.  :)  Happy 5 month to the both of you!

p1r54a7xaa	I am assuming he was moving too fast for you and you decided to spend time apart. If I am wrong, disregard my answer.<br>  <br>  He is probably still attached to you but afraid of you hurting him again. He is trying to move on. Obviously his hormones are racing and he doesn't have very good control over himself. I suggest that you leave him alone and focus on your schoolwork.|`|56e889a9ce32806574c8ad5b0d1908e3aa	He sounds like a jerk.  Move on and find someone better.

You are better than that.|`|5rZZr5Vraa	u need to sit and talk with him because if u didnt offically break up then u dont know where u stand u need to ask him are we together or not? its that simple.|`|XnUXiBQoaa	Well you will never know how he feels unless you ask him. Talk to him and tell him how you feel and what you see him doing and ask him to be totally honest with you. Don't go around and assume what he is feeling because in the long run it will only cause problems later on.|`|ftIkEAkzaa	Who knows why guys are like that.  He may really like you and care about you, but you may not be what he is looking for (sorry to say).  Or maybe he just wants to make you jealous.  Who knows.  But the bottom line is, I would stay away from that drama.  I think you're doing a good thing by staying classy about the situation eventhough you are hurt.  But don't ask him how he feels, you will just look desperate and if his new gf is a real B****, she will use it to make you look bad.  My best advice is move on, you are only in high school.  And high school relationships rarely last (I can only name one, and they are not even all that happy).  Enjoy being single, go out and have fun with your girls!  Get your nails done and buy some new clothes.  You are too young to be tied down!  Let him make that mistake not you!|`|cCEetqkFaa	ur right on the money.  hes trying to show how he feels without saying it.|`|a37dc179b9a04772f24bb7711a8e0702aa	Don't mess with him. Find you a young man that is as mature as you are. He has a new girl, and is looking at you? So if he has feelings for you, and he gets back w/ you is he going to look at her at lunch? Don't bother yourself trying to figure it out. Find you someone else.

59a3aa2d5edbd6c3d2ef22d8ec7ec51daa	This is good that she had confirmed that you are the right person for her but the wrong time indicates that the time is not right. Being 21 one is young and probably she is thinking of career or has some other course in her mind.<br>  Distance makes one closer to their loved ones. Maybe she is looking for her own space. If for a job you are moving to another city, then give her your contact numbers,email address etc . Try to be in touch with her.<br>  Best thing ask her what are her career plans,future etc. In these days there are competitions. Maybe she is stressed.The wrong time indicates that she needs time to be ready . She is maybe focused somewhere.<br>  Tell her that she can contact you when needed and at the same time you look for new girl friend too. In case she does not comes back then  ..<br>  Or ask her frankly that you support her career aims and should you wait for her ? Ask her to think and decide. Dont take fast decisions.<br>  Give her some days.|`|9YrQdyoUaa	she will if you invite her to your wedding, lol|`|AA11005400	Well honestly i am sorry to say.. But I think she has found someone new.

00gjZDPSaa	Send in a spy. Try finding someone who will not look suspicious asking him about who he likes, or if he likes you. You will probably want to avoid letting him know how you feel without some clue about his feelings toward you. You don't want rejection and to look like a fool if the feelings aren't mutual. If he likes you too, then Hooray!!!!! If not, :( then  you will not have risked your friendship with him, if he doesn't feel the same way. Whatever happens, keep your cool. Don't get all sappy and act like you are crushing on him. That will chase him away with a quickness. Good Luck!!!!|`|3lXkWYIKaa	ask his friend

Your only options are prescription antiviral medications, which will only subdue an outbreak, or burning or freezing them off, which only a doctor can do.

IqBW15AZaa	A todos en algún momento de la vida nos ha pasado que pareciera que nos sale todo mal. Pero por eso no hay que quedarse sentada en casa llorando y esperando que los demás hagan las cosas por nosotros. Debes agarrar las riendas de tu vida .

Hay que dejar que el tiempo vaya pasando para tener más claridad en lo que realmente queremos (que quizá no sea la profesión que estudiamos) y buscar la ocupación que no haga sentir bien, aunque no coincida con los mandatos o status sociales.

Te recomiendo que busques andar otros caminos aunque al final decidas regresar, sólo es para que puedas distraer tu mente de pensamientos negativos.

Sé como te debes sentir porq no es nada facil lidiar con este tipo de situacion, pero adelante, la vida continua, todavia eres joven y te esperan muchas cosas bonitas por delante.

Sin embargo, estas desanimada pero ten cuidado con esa posicion, porque recuerda:" no es mas feliz quien mas tiene, si no quien menos necesita". Siempre tenemos muchas mas razones para ser felices que para estar tristes pero si nos enfocamos solo en las negativas saldremos muy lesionados. Recuerda que debemos darle gracias a Dios cuando las cosas que queremos no nos son tan faciles, porque así nuestro aprendizaje es mucho mejor. Eres una guerrera y se que estas decidida a triunfar! sigue adelante, te manifiesto mi afecto y mi solidaridad. Un abrazo!

Olvidate de  las cuestiones de suerte. levantate, cambia tu look, transformate y deja de lamentarte, atrae lo positivo empieza por buscar ese deseado trabajo y cuando lo tengas te das el lujo de antender tu enfermedad ahora no pierdas tiempo en eso, solo concentrate en generar un cambio y mantenerlo.|`|SuLXIcSDaa	Que enfermedad?.

Amigo mío. Antoine De Saint-Exupéry<br>  <br>  Amigo mío, <br>  tengo tanta necesidad de tu amistad. <br>  Tengo sed de un compa?ero que respete en mí, <br>  por encima de los litigios de la razón, <br>  el peregrino de aquel fuego. <br>  A veces tengo necesidad de gustar por adelantado el calor prometido, <br>  y descansar, más allá de mí mismo, <br>  en esa cita que será la nuestra.<br>  Hallo la paz. <br>  Más allá de mis palabras torpes, <br>  más allá de los razonamientos que me pueden enga?ar, <br>  tú consideras en mí, simplemente al Hombre, <br>  tú honras en mí al embajador de creencias, <br>  de costumbres, de amores particulares. <br>  Si difiero de ti, lejos de menoscabarte te engrandezco. <br>  Me interrogas como se interroga al viajero,<br>  Yo, que como todos, experimento la necesidad de ser reconocido, <br>  me siento puro en ti y voy hacia ti. <br>  Tengo necesidad de ir allí donde soy puro. <br>  Jamás han sido mis fórmulas ni mis andanzas <br>  las que te informaron acerca de lo que soy, <br>  sino que la aceptación de quien soy te ha hecho<br>  necesariamente indulgente para con esas andanzas y esas fórmulas. <br>  Te estoy agradecido porque me recibes tal como soy. <br>  ?Qué he de hacer con un amigo que me juzga?<br>  Si todavía combato, combatiré un poco por ti. <br>  Tengo necesidad de ti. Tengo necesidad de ayudarte a vivir.<br>  <br>  2. A modo de prólogo<br>  <br>  Este peque?o texto de Saint-Exupéry lo encontré hace unos cuantos a?os. No sé a qué obra de este gran autor (a mi parecer, por supuesto) pertenece, tampoco me interesó demasiado saberlo. Lo cierto es que siempre me atrajo muchísimo por la profundidad de sus palabras. Yo, que siempre experimenté grandes amistades, me sentí superado por este concepto de amistad que se entrevé en esos renglones. ?Es posible decirle todas esas cosas a un amigo? Siempre había alguno de estos "datos" que se me hacían ajenos. Me parecía utópica esa idea de amistad. Hablar de "sed", de "calor prometido", de "cita"; me generaba una especie de rechazo, seguro a causa de esos prejuicios que uno tiene y que ante estas palabras se hacían evidentes. Sin embargo, esa atracción delataba una búsqueda en mí, como si mi corazón se dirigiera hacia eso, la búsqueda de los sentimientos más nobles. Encontrar un amigo que me reconozca y ame simplemente como soy, sentirme puro en él y descansar en él. Esto me parecía una gran "descarga afectiva" que en mi psicología me costaba aceptar. <br>  Y esto pasó; encontré un amigo a quien dirigirle todas y cada una de estas palabras. La búsqueda siguió interrogándome desde dentro de mí, aceptando que tengo carencias, que todos las tenemos, necesidades, afectivas sí, simplemente como algo natural, propio en nosotros los seres humanos. Necesité y necesito ponerle nombre a todo esto. Es un poco lo que estoy intentando hacer.<br>  <br>  3. Introducción<br>  <br>  El tema de los afectos es una cuestión esencial en el hombre. Tan esencial que creo que es por eso que nos cuesta tanto llegar a la "médula". Es un tema que camina al borde de lo psicológico y de lo antropológico. En este último caso es como lo intento encarar. Trataré de ser lo más preciso y específico posible dentro de mis limitaciones y mi poco conocimiento. Con esta humilde investigación, pobre seguramente, quisiera ponerle nombres a algunas realidades que nos tocan vivir, estoy seguro que a todos, en este campo afectivo.<br>  Somos seres incompletos, necesitados de los demás, de su reconocimiento, de su cari?o, de su amor y de su manifestación en los afectos. Necesitamos una sonrisa, un gesto cari?oso, un abrazo para poder seguir. Un abrazo nos puede descontracturar más que una sesión de kinesiología, nos puede consolar más que mil palabras. Y, sin embargo, nos ponemos centenares de limitaciones. Estas limitaciones pueden ser prejuicios, cuestiones culturales y hasta alguna traba psicológica.<br>  Estas cosas nos hacen que seamos afectivamente inmaduros, nos dejan incompletos, nos hacen sufrir nuestra soledad. Alcanzar la madurez afectiva es tarea de todos los días.<br>  El papel de la afectividad es un elemento fundamental en la formación de nuestra personalidad porque nos integra de una forma especial, en nuestra relación con nosotros, con los demás, en nuestra sexualidad, en nuestro trabajo o profesión, cultivando relaciones sociales amistosas. Podemos considerar la madurez afectiva como requisito indispensable para el óptimo funcionamiento de nuestra personalidad.<br>  El tema es muy amplio. Me gustaría, en este caso, orientarlo en la línea afecto-amor-amistad; sin ser específicamente estricto en ninguno de estos temas en particular sino hacer un pantallazo general del asunto dejando sólidas algunas ideas fundamentales.<br>  <br>   <br>  4. Definición<br>  <br>  Para abordar un tema me parece necesario recurrir a su definición, a los conceptos que se tienen en algunos campos para dicho tema.<br>  El hilo primordial de la investigación será el afecto.<br>  La psicología lo define de muy variados modos. Puede equivaler a sentimiento, afección, estado de ánimo, comprendiendo los diversos elementos de la afectividad. Se entiende frecuentemente en el sentido de estado de emoción, sentimiento intenso y relativamente corto; en sentido amplio, es afecto todo proceso afectivo. También destaca las expresiones afectivas como movimientos y actos de causa afectiva y que tienen relación con los reflejos.<br>  La filosofía lo define como emoción en un sentido muy similar a sentimiento. En ocasiones se distingue entre "sentimiento" y "emoción", considerándose la emoción como una especie de sentimiento. Los sentimientos pueden ser corporales, como cuando se siente frío. Las emociones, aún si se consideran fundadas en procesos corporales, no necesitan describirse en términos corporales. Así, se estima que sentir alegría, temor, amor, etc., son emociones.<br>  "Ahora bien, para la mayoría de los autores, los sentimientos, afectos, emociones y pasiones, comprenden no sólo unas determinadas "sensaciones", o unas modificaciones de la conciencia, sino que habitualmente comprenden o implican ciertas alteraciones orgánicas, determinados deseos, un modo de conducta más o menos típico, etc., relacionados todos con un objeto específico."<br>  Me parece destacar la concepción del hombre como unidad substancial y referir esto a que cuando sentimos no es una parte de nosotros la que siente, sino la integridad de nuestro ser. Lo que sentimos en nuestro interior, también lo siente y lo manifiesta nuestro cuerpo. Por este lado vamos a encauzar el tema de los afectos. <br>  Edith Stein, explicando los fenómenos ejemplifica que "el sentimiento requiere según su esencia una expresión.(...) Entre el sentimiento y la expresión existe una dependencia de esencia y de sentido, no de causa." Este sentimiento y esa expresión están inexorablemente unidos. Si bien uno es la manifestación del otro, el uno sin el otro es como que pierde bastante su sentido. Si tengo un sentimiento, de alguna manera lo manifiesto y, si expreso algo, es porque algo siento. "Por ejemplo, en la risa, en la que se exterioriza mi alegría a modo de vivencia, se me da simultáneamente como un estiramiento de mis labios; en este caso yo soy consciente de mí en mi totalidad, no sólo de la alegría o de la risa.<br>  Dentro de los afectos, también hay varios niveles. <br>  El amor lo tenemos como en un primer nivel, como algo inmediato, como un "apetito primario" o "concupiscible" como lo llamaban los medievales. También el deseo y el placer o gozo, aversión y dolor o tristeza.<br>  En un segundo nivel, como "apetito mediato", como consecuencia del bien o evitación del mal tenemos la esperanza y la desesperación, el temor, audacia y la ira. Muchos afectos aunque están encuadrados en una clasificación, no por eso quedan excluidos de otros, pues se prolongan en estratos más profundos y se integran a la vez con otros.<br>  Hasta aquí, me parece tener una definición y una idea simple y concreta.<br>  <br>  Ser Con Los Demás<br>  Ahora bien, recién hablábamos del afecto como una necesidad natural, necesidad del otro, de la relación interpersonal con el otro, el amor del otro, el reconocimiento, etc.. Es propio del hombre la relación interpersonal. No fuimos creados ni para ser ni para estar solos. Nadie crece ni se forma solo.<br>  El profesor belga J. Gevaert dice esto: "El ser con los demás pertenece al núcleo mismo de la existencia humana." Nuestra existencia es siempre hacia los demás, ligada, en comunión con los demás. "El otro está indudablemente presente a la existencia personal, pero como uno que afecta a la existencia en sus dimensiones más personales." También dice: "Antes de toda relación con el mundo e independientemente de ella, cada uno (el yo) tiene una relación con el otro (el tú). La relación con el otro se caracteriza por la inmediatez: el otro está inmediatamente presente, sin conceptos, sin fantasías, etc...." No hay razonamientos ni nada que mediaticen este encuentro, por esto mismo no es algo "conflictivo" sino más bien una relación de pares, el uno y el otro en una perfecta reciprocidad. En ese encuentro soy auténticamente "yo" y el otro es auténticamente "tú". <br>  De este modo se hace esencialmente necesaria nuestra relación con el otro. ?De dónde parte esta necesidad? Podemos decir que esta necesidad personal primera es vectorial; esto significa como una flecha, con una dirección. "Yo necesito a una persona con una intensidad y con una inclinación u orientación muy precisas. Lo necesito para algo, no lo necesito personalmente sino por aquello que la persona tiene o lleva consigo; su cuerpo, su esfuerzo, su destreza, su desplazamiento social, su apoyo..." Podemos poner el ejemplo de un bebé con su madre: el bebé, todavía inconsciente, "ama" a su madre porque la necesita. La tendencia humana se orienta siempre al bien, aquí al bien sensible. Este apetito natural de cada ser por su bien sería la forma fundamental y única del amor. <br>  De todo el campo tendencial de los apetitos humanos brotan las respuestas al bien o al mal propuestos; estas respuestas las podemos llamar afectivas. El bien mueve el apetito inmediato - dentro de los cuales incluimos al amor como motor exclusivo de la vida afectiva -, es su objeto, ningún ser rehuye al bien en cuanto bien, sino que todos tienden a él.<br>  Aquí me gustaría poner como en un acertado paréntesis un pensamiento de San Agustín (Confesiones, XIII, 9). San Agustín dice agudamente: "Mi amor es mi peso; por él soy llevado a dondequiera que soy llevado". La imagen del peso viene en San Agustín de su idea del "lugar" natural de cada cosa y del ideal del "reposo": "nuestro descanso es nuestro lugar"; y esto lleva a pensar en el peso del cuerpo; pero inmediatamente supera esa interpretación inercial: "el cuerpo por su peso tiende a su lugar; pero el peso no es sólo hacia abajo, sino hacia su lugar". La idea de San Agustín no está muy lejos de la idea de vector: el amor es el peso que nos lleva a uno u otro lugar, en una u otra dirección.<br>  Seguimos insertando la idea del amor como algo propio del afecto y viceversa. Gevaert sigue con esta idea: "El amor concreto existe generalmente con un color afectivo, distinto según sea la relación amorosa." Va a ser muy distinto el amor conyugal al que hay entre padres e hijos y al amor de amistad. Este último es el que más me interesa en este caso y nos detendremos más adelante.<br>  Así podemos afirmar que el otro (el tú) viene a ser como un "constitutivo formal" del propio yo. No es que no exista un yo sin un tú: es que el tú mismo viene a formar parte esencial del propio yo. No basta que el otro sea un ser real: es además factor esencial de mi yo.<br>  La unicidad de la persona no se revela mas que en la comunión interpersonal. La persona es por excelencia el ser de la palabra y del amor.<br>  La persona manifiesta además un "carácter sagrado" o "metafísico". La unicidad no queda constituida por el encuentro de personas, sino que en cada encuentro o comunión se manifiesta y se impone como una realidad que finalmente no procede ni de mí ni de ti; una realidad que es anterior a mí y a ti, y que precisamente es la que hace posible el encuentro y la comunión interpersonal. En este sentido la realidad de la persona es la realidad trascendente, la realidad metafísica por excelencia.<br>  Aunque las relaciones interpersonales se ofusquen por conflictos y contrastes (como por ejemplo la injusticia, la muerte...) el hombre es constitutivamente un ser con los demás, orientado a los demás; y realiza su existencia gracias a los demás y juntamente con los demás.<br>  Esta realidad interpersonal no está separada del Dios creador que da el ser al hombre. Por eso el encuentro con el tú es también el camino hacia Dios. La relación interpersonal está ligada a la relación con el tú absoluto.<br>  <br>  5. Amor, afecto y desarrollo<br>  <br>  Creo que queda claro el tema de la necesidad de los demás. También quiero destacar aquí la necesidad de ese reconocimiento, de las manifestaciones afectivas. Necesitamos "sentir" que el otro nos ama y también necesitamos manifestarle al otro que lo amamos. Esto lo manifestamos con nuestro cuerpo. El cuerpo es el campo expresivo del hombre donde realiza su existencia. En todo sentido. Y en el hecho de ser para los demás el cuerpo adquiere otro significado, como presencia en el mundo, como origen de la instrumentalidad y de la cultura y en este caso que nos interesa a nosotros, como comunicación con el otro y reconocimiento del otro.<br>  El lenguaje táctil es otra forma de lenguaje corpóreo que se da específicamente en el afecto y en las expresiones corpóreas de afecto. Continúa Gevaert: "El abrazo, la caricia, la ternura, el cachete, etc., son un lenguaje cuya importancia resulta muchas veces decisiva, no sólo durante los primerísimos a?os de la infancia, sino incluso en la vida del hombre adulto, en lo que respecta al equilibrio humano y a la posibilidad de comunicar con los demás. La psiquiatra A. Terruwe observa:<br>  Cuando se ama a alguien, se siente naturalmente la necesidad de tocarlo. La madre toma al ni?o, lo aprieta contra su corazón, lo mece; el hombre estrecha la mano del amigo, le da una palmada cari?osa en la espalda; la muchacha camina del brazo, abraza, besa, acaricia; de este modo hay infinitas formas táctiles con las que se manifiesta el afecto... La expresión táctil del amor es la más original de todas."<br>  El ni?o que no ha experimentado un amor afectivo no sólo no llega a madurar en sus sentimientos, sino que cae en la neurosis. Sin entrar en terreno psicológico me parece necesario ver este problema con una dimensión también filosófica, puesto que afecta al hombre en su ser más hondo. No sólo psicológica, sino también humanamente la suprensión del amor afectivo y las manifestaciones de afecto pueden conducir a una neurosis de frustración. Esto es algo muy típico en nuestra civilización moderna.<br>  Otra forma expresiva de afecto es simplemente estar juntos, aunque no se diga nada. Este silencio puede tener una gran intensidad de lenguaje.<br>  "La afirmación, contenida en el amor afectivo, es por eso mismo el fundamento de toda la existencia social del hombre; es ella la que da al hombre ser lo que es, y al darlo a sí mismo lo hace capaz de ser para los demás, de darse a los demás."<br>  El amor recibido de los demás es uno de los factores más determinantes para el desarrollo y equilibrio de las personas.<br>  En el contacto con el otro el hombre se percibe a sí mismo, saliendo fuera de sí. El amor es una respuesta afectiva también sensible. "Si quisiéramos ilustrar la importancia del amor afectivo y del amor en general, podríamos recurrir también a la imagen negativa: el día que un hombre o una mujer tienen la impresión de que no hay nadie en el mundo que los aprecie, caen en la sensación de que el vacío absoluto inunda su existencia."<br>  Seguimos con la idea de la naturalidad del amor y de los afectos. Al hablar de que es algo natural decimos que no es algo adquirido, sino que es idéntico a la naturaleza misma, que no exige intervención del conocimiento. Por lo tanto el amor no es una ficción ni algo artificial ni un fenómeno adquirido por repetición de actos.<br>  Desde este punto de vista, el amor es un dato natural y no una fantasía sin relación con el fin natural de los seres.<br>  Podemos concluir diciendo que no sólo es necesario recibir amor, sino que también son necesarias las manifestaciones de ese amor que se nos da. Repitiendo un concepto que teníamos antes decimos que entre el amor y las manifestaciones de afecto no hay una relación de causa y efecto sino que tienen una dependencia esencial y de sentido el uno con el otro.<br>  <br>  Amor En Sí<br>  Ahora vamos a detenernos un poco sobre el amor. ?Qué es? ?De dónde viene? Vamos a comenzar buscándole una definición. En su origen etimológico para algunos deriva de vocablos griegos (que no los vamos a escribir, sólo su traducción). Una de las traducciones significa semejante, pues los que se aman son semejantes; otra es desear vivamente: amor implica un querer intenso y ardiente; otra significa ligar, conectar, pues lo propio del amor es juntar a los amantes. "Amor abarca también el espectro semántico del término caridad, que significó inicialmente entre los latinos lo que expresa el espa?ol carestía, situación en la que se carece de algo necesario." Esta riqueza semántica (en el griego) delata un poco la riqueza de sentido que lleva la palabra amor.<br>  Antes decíamos que el amor estaba incluido dentro de los apetitos concupiscibles o inmediatos o primarios, como una "conveniencia". Cruz C. aclara un poco esto así: "No se debe confundir el amor con el deseo ni con el gozo o alegría." El deseo va a surgir del mismo amor que nos va a llevar a gustarlo. El gozo se va a dar en el bien inteligible, el bien del espíritu; y también en la sensibilidad, en el cuerpo. Hay una tendencia al goce, un deseo común, al alma y al cuerpo. Continúa: "El amor espiritual a?ade al amor en general una elección previa; es claro así que el amor espiritual no se encuentra en los apetitos, sino sólo en la voluntad y únicamente en la naturaleza racional." Aquí se hace la diferencia entre ese "amor primero" del que hablaba cuando ponía el ejemplo de la madre y el bebé, y cuando ya soy consciente de ese amor, aquí conozco y amo con libertad.<br>  Por todo esto sería error considerar al amor como una especia de apetito sensible refinado, como si en lo espiritual hubieran instintos como en lo corporal. Aquí el apetito natural es de cada ser por su bien y el amor sería la forma fundamental y única.<br>  "En la persona del "otro" está el objeto formal del perfecto amor: se ama algo porque es bueno, porque encarna la índole del bien: "algo es amado en cuanto tiene razón de bien". Lo cual no equivale a afirmar la prioridad del amor interesado y la subordinación del bien sujeto al amante. Porque el bien no es bueno porque sea apetecible, sino que es apetecible porque es bueno. Afirmar que el bien es el objeto formal del amor es fundar no sólo el carácter extático o desinteresado del amor, sino fundar el amor sin más."<br>  Ahora, ?cuál es la causa del amor? El amor que me realiza y perfecciona como hombre no es inmotivado, tiene causa. Podemos resumir la causa del amor así: es el bien objetivo y real de la persona amada. Amar es complacerse en el bien que existe en el otro. Y ese amor lo puedo descubrir de varias formas: cuando amo a alguien: es una experiencia activa e inmediata, el objeto directo del amor es el otro; cuando observo el amor en otras personas que se aman: es una experiencia mediata; y la forma más especial es cuando yo soy amado: es una experiencia pasiva e inmediata y el objeto del amor soy yo mismo; al ser tocado por el amor de otra persona advierto que el contenido del amor se me aproxima de modo único. Todas estas experiencias ayudan a comprender lo que es el amor: afirmación afectiva o complacida que un ser humano hace de la existencia del otro.<br>  <br>  El amor es una respuesta afectiva; y puede ser tanto sensible como espiritual.<br>  "En el plano ontológico esencial, o desde el punto de vista de la interioridad objetiva, el amor ha quedado definido como el principio radical de la dinámica afectiva cuyo término es la propia plenitud. Pues bien, desde el punto de vista de la conciencia, el amor es la captación de la plenitud y perfección de otra persona en tanto que susceptible de ser realizada por uno mismo y en tanto que en la realización de esa plenitud va implicada la propia autorrealización, de modo que ésta pueda alcanzar una plenitud antes insospechada. Dicho brevemente, el amor es la captación de un tú, de cuya plenitud depende la propia, y de tal modo que ese tú despierta lo mejor que hay en el yo. Desde esta perspectiva, el amor es un sentimiento y una tendencia."<br>  "En el amor se produce, pues, la unión de dos subjetividades de modo que cada una media en la plenitud de la otra. El amor como sentimiento es la anticipación de la realización conjunta de dos subjetividades. Por eso, Aristóteles mantiene que la obra del amor es la unidad, S. Agustín que el amor es la tendencia a la unidad y Hegel que el amor es la unidad de la identidad y la diferencia, es decir, la unidad en la que dos subjetividades alcanzan la identificación de una con la otra pero sin que eso suponga la anulación de una por la otra sino, al contrario, de tal modo que la diferencia se mantenga."<br>  A todo esto decimos que el amor consiste en la respuesta de un ser a otro o al bien idéntico al ser.<br>  "Es pues imposible imaginar que nuestra voluntad para amar, incluso con el amor más puro, sin realizar a la vez su propia perfección, o sea, sin obtener por el propio ejercicio del amor del bien, bajo su razón formal de bien último, el acabamiento para el que ella está formalmente hecha y para el cual no puede no ser hecha."<br>  <br>  6. Amistad E Intimidad<br>  <br>  Cuando el amor honesto y sincero se hizo hábito en alguien, se dice que se quiere con un amor de amigo. Al decir que es un hábito también decimos que se construye, es una unión que se fragua con el tiempo. <br>  El amor de amistad se coloca decididamente fuera del ambiente familiar y se aparta del color sexual. Según Santo Tomás, el amor de amistad es un amor perfecto. En este amor perfecto salgo totalmente fuera de mí terminando en mi amigo amado; yo amo a mi amigo por él mismo. Es un éxtasis de la intimidad (éxtasis no como algo sobrenatural, simplemente como ponerse fuera de sí), "la unión afectiva íntima entre el amante y el amado, que es el amor, supone la salida del amante de sí mismo y su persistencia afectiva en el amado, el éxtasis." En ese éxtasis yo me encuentro a mí mismo en el otro. Es el acto más encumbrado del amor, es la aprobación que hace mi intimidad de la intimidad del otro. Esta intimidad no es un espacio cerrado sino una relación que une por dentro a las personas. "La intimidad, interioridad relacionada, se forma o fragua en el curso de la vida personal - el hombre comienza a descubrir la intimidad en una etapa de su vida -, y podemos contribuir a fomentarla en el otro: es más, ella no se profundiza ni se amplía sin el contacto con el otro. Una intimidad es fuerte en la misma medida en que tiene capacidad de compartir y de relacionarse creativamente." Por eso esta interioridad, esta intimidad no es distancia sino que se convierte en vínculo. No hay otro modo de apertura personal total que la realizada en la intimidad. El amor de amistad es siempre íntimo, y en ese amor íntimo encontramos nuestro bien humano y perfecto afirmando el bien absoluto. "Si la felicidad de un ser consiste en la realización de su naturaleza, y si lo propio de la naturaleza espiritual del hombre es estar referida al bien como a un absoluto, entonces la felicidad del hombre se consigue mediante el amor al bien por sí mismo." <br>  Esto va a implicar también un profundo conocimiento de mí mismo, "...la amistad se refiere a una relación de intimidad. Por lo tanto, no puede darse en profundidad hasta que la persona llega a descubrir su propia intimidad y aprende luego a compartirla con los otros." Esto también va a implicar un desarrollo de las virtudes, no puede caber amistad donde falta virtud, es algo imprescindible. Me parece importante citar algunos ejemplos para mostrar esto. "La lealtad es la virtud que ayuda a la persona a aceptar los vínculos implícitos en la adhesión al amigo, de tal modo que refuerza y protege, a lo largo del tiempo, el conjunto de valores que representa esta relación. La generosidad facilita al amigo actuar a favor del otro teniendo en cuenta lo que le es útil y necesario para su mejora personal. El pudor controlará la entrega de aspectos de su intimidad. La comprensión le ayudará a reconocer los distintos factores que influyen en su situación, en su estado de ánimo, etc.. La confianza y el respeto lleva al amigo a mostrar su interés en el otro y que cree en él y en sus posibilidades de mejorar continuamente." Podemos decir que los buenos amigos luchan por superarse en sus virtudes exigiéndole también al otro comprensión y ejemplo. Hoy en día se le dedica poco tiempo a los amigos y esto no es lógico ni humano.<br>  "La amistad es un amor recíproco que realiza la unión de dos voluntades, y por ello la de los sujetos (S.Th. I-II, 28, 1-3). En el orden humano, cada uno de los amigos considera al otro como a sí mismo, quiere el bien del otro como el suyo, siente las alegrías y las penas del otro como las suyas, busca por último la presencia del otro porque es una alegría igual para ambos." En el amor de amistad, el amante se ordena al amado como a sí mismo y se supone una cierta comunión de vida, unidad de pensamiento, de sentimiento y de voluntad (esto no quita que se puedan tener amigos con criterios distintos a los de uno). Esto es lo propio y formal del amor: la unión afectiva del amante con el amado. Me resulta interesante el modo de definir a los componentes de una amistad que utiliza Cruz Cruz, amante y amado, uno que ama y otro que es amado. <br>  La tendencia del amante hacia el amado se orienta hacia lo que le es semejante. El amor es entre semejantes. Uno ama aquello que le es semejante. Un modo de semejanza es cuando los semejantes poseen lo mismo en acto. Este modo de semejanza produce un amor perfecto. "...Puesto que por lo mismo que dos seres son semejantes, al tener en cierto modo una sola forma, son como uno solo en aquella forma, a la manera que dos hombres son uno en la especie de la humanidad, (...) y por esto el afecto del amante se dirige hacia el amado como a sí mismo, pues cada uno - por su identidad ontológica o semejanza sustancial consigo mismo - se ama a sí mismo con amor natural perfecto, que es amor íntimo. Un buen ejemplo de esto lo da San Agustín al hablar de la muerte de su amigo íntimo al decir que era "la mitad de su alma"; "porque yo sentí que mi alma y la suya no eran más que una en dos cuerpos, y por eso me causaba horror la vida, porque no quería vivir a medias, y al mismo tiempo temía mucho morir, porque no muriese del todo aquél a quien había amado tanto."<br>  Todos debemos tener (y si no, deberíamos tener) experiencia de amistad, así que creo que todo esto sólo define de una manera más fina el concepto de amistad.<br>  <br>  7. Conclusión<br>  <br>  "A la pregunta sobre para qué necesito a alguien, sólo puedo responder con una historia, con una porción significativa de mi biografía o con su totalidad."<br>  Un poco la idea de todo este trabajo, de esta investigación, era comprobar la necesidad de cada uno por el otro, por el amor, la amistad, el afecto. Y ciertamente cada uno responde a esto con su propia historia. Cada uno tiene su propia experiencia de salir de sí y su modo particular de necesitar, pero creo que en muchos de todos estos puntos podemos coincidir. <br>  ?Por qué tengo esa necesidad de salir de mí, de buscar "algo" en el otro? Esta búsqueda natural está impulsada por el amor. Buscamos una verdad, la verdad de nosotros mismos, nos buscamos a nosotros mismos. En el fondo buscamos a Dios. Quien busca la verdad, aunque no lo sepa, busca a Dios.<br>  La búsqueda comienza por nosotros mismos, en nuestro interior. Y automáticamente somos impulsados a salir de nosotros. No somos seres cerrados que además somos capaces de ponernos en contacto con otras personas, sino que en la comunión interpersonal se revela la unicidad de nuestra persona. Me percibo a mí mismo cuando salgo fuera de mí, en el contacto con el otro; con el lenguaje del amor de la otra persona para conmigo tomo conciencia de mí y de mi dignidad.<br>  Sólo quien se experimenta a sí mismo como persona, como un todo pleno de sentido, puede comprender a los otros. Y así nos construimos recíprocamente. Nos necesitamos para ser seres humanos plenos. <br>  Nuestras acciones han perdido naturalidad, nuestro trato es incompleto. Y así ponemos barreras para encontrarnos con el otro y por consiguiente con nosotros. Hemos perdido transparencia, hemos perdido el contacto con el otro y es preciso recuperarlo.<br>  Estamos orientados al bien, o sea que naturalmente lo buscamos. El bien nuestro y el bien del otro. Y esta es la forma del amor. Y ese amor lo manifestamos, necesitamos manifestar el lenguaje del amor con expresiones, con nuestro cuerpo. Decíamos que la expresión táctil del amor es la más original de todas. Original haciendo referencia a que es de "origen", como principio.<br>  El amor es el principio radical de la dinámica afectiva cuyo término es la propia plenitud.<br>  El amor recibido de los demás es uno de los factores más determinantes para el desarrollo y equilibrio de la persona. Y el amor y las manifestaciones de afecto tienen una dependencia esencial.<br>  El amor perfecto se da en la amistad donde deseo el bien de mi amigo por mi amigo mismo. La amistad es un hábito que tiene por objeto las acciones para con los demás bajo el signo de la gratuidad. Amo íntimamente a mi amigo simplemente porque es persona. Lo descubro más allá de lo que cuenta de sí mismo, desde su vocación, desde su esencia. <br>  Toda amistad se funda en una comunicación de vida por eso tiene que haber una reciprocidad. Y ahí es donde voy buscando y encontrando mi plenitud. <br>  Lo que conviene primero y más propiamente al amor es el amar y no el ser amado. Lo importante en los amigos es que lo son en cuanto amantes, en cuanto a principio de amor, no en cuanto son amados. Esto no quita que el ser amado por otro sea inductor para que yo corresponda al amor que se me da. Dice muy bien el dicho que amor con amor se paga. También dije que el encuentro con el otro también es camino hacia Dios, y en el amor nos vamos asemejando a él. Amar como él es siempre darse, salir de sí, tomar la iniciativa del amor, amar primero. Creo que si somos capaces de responsabilizarnos en el amor es ahí donde radica nuestra plenitud. El amor va a ser el que nos impulse a entrar en nosotros, a salir de nosotros para encontrarnos con el otro, a construir vínculos amistosos fuertes, sanos y libres. <br>  <br>  A Modo De Epílogo<br>  Espero humildemente que todo lo tratado brevemente en estas hojas aclare algunas cuestiones que, como dije antes, creo que son cuestiones que a todos nos tocan de cerca. Por lo menos a mí me sirve para ponerle nombre a mis sentimientos, tener claridad en ellos y moverme en este campo con la mayor libertad posible. <br>  Creo que la madurez humana y afectiva es lo que hace que seamos personas equilibradas en nuestras relaciones. Este es el comienzo de un camino que es costoso; siempre digo que los conceptos en la cabeza son más fáciles de fijar y comprender, lo difícil es hacerlo carne en nuestro corazón porque siempre tenemos una tendencia al desorden. Tener estas cosas claras en la cabeza ayuda a estar "alerta" en la manera en que nos relacionamos y amamos fortaleciéndonos y templándonos.<br>  Pensar en esto y tratar de crecer y madurar en el amor se convierte en algo fundamental. <br>  Tener amigos con quien compartir la vida es un regalo precioso que debemos cultivar y cuidar.<br>  <br>  Buen rollo y ademas profundo no te confundas....<br>  espero te sirva.|`|XABPlE6Jaa	Está perfecto, cuanto mas amigos sean mejor.

Sigue asi y terminaras en el altar!|`|fy3OBlxaaa	no, que bien que sean amigos y novios, porque asi se la llevaran mejor si llegan a casarse, habra confianza, cari?o y respeto. para mi antes que ser novios, esposos o amantes hay que ser excelentes amigos aunque no olvidar la chispa de pasion y amor.

865cfa1219a3c726225319f2e3b93582aa	Generalmente ambas parte sufren, pero hay que tomar en cuenta a que se debió la ruptura, dependiendo cuales fueron los motivos para que ambos tomaran esa decisión, se podrá  decir, cual de los dos sufrirá mas. Yo creo que el hombre tiende a sufrir mas, y eso se debe en parte a nuestra cultura, en donde se le exige a no expresar sus emociones, en cambio la mujer es mas expresiva en una ruptura. <br>  Pero ambos lloran, se deprimen, y se sienten mal.

Yo me llevo bien con ella, y te puedo decir que es una buena chica, pero si comportamiento fresco y un poco irreverente le granjeo el que la apodaran en su circulo "la mundana" viste como cualquier otra chica, (tipo "lolita" japonesa), pero así andan muchas chavas hoy día.  Entonces imagínate bonitilla y con faldita y calcetas hasta la mitad del muslo, bueno, pues es lo que no puede ver esta gente.  Recién se caso con un novio que tuvo durante varios a?os.

Porque el que te mienta mas sobre esto, va a hacer que a futuro terminara la relación porque compruebes tu algo y te haya mentido.<br>  <br>  Si te dice como fueron las cosas, o la perdonas y de ahí para adelante o si no vas a poder con los chismes, no te quedara otra que terminar con ella.<br>  <br>  2) Creerle e irte con ella a vivir a otro lado y dejar todo para comenzar una nueva vida.<br>  <br>  Tu sabrás si le das otra oportunidad, porque tu sabes si ella se la ha ganado.

Lo ayudé a terminar el secundario y empezar la facultad...dejaba yo de estudiar mi carrera por estudiar lo de él y ayudarlo...en fin...no me arrepiento, porq sé que él lo vale; el problema es que le habían hecho creer que él no iba a estudiar nunca sino trabajar y "bancar" a la flia y a su hija...<br>  Para cortarla acá y no extenderme mucho más...te digo que si vos estás seguro de lo que sentís por ella, la pelees..que no te importe lo q te digan los demás...seguí tu intuición y luchá hasta el final; si después no funciona..al menos vas a tener por seguro que hiciste de todo por estar juntos y bien.. feo sería ni siquiera intentarlo y después mirar atrás y decir "qué hubiera pasado si...".<br>  Yo tampoco le creía mucho cuando me negaba las cosas y esas cosas... pero yo sabía q lo quería y que él era mucho más que un flaco "de la esquina"<br>  Espero me hayas entendido y te sirva de algo mi experiencia.<br>  Mucha suerte!!!! y jugate por lo que VOS sentís!!!!q no te importe lo q digan o piensen los demás...<br>  Besos!|`|8JZeU44Haa	Yo tuve una novia de la que decían ser ligera de cascos -por ser benévolo-.

No sabes ni lo que dices. Claro, me figuro que estás hablando metafóricamente, exagerando de por sí la nota. Te comprendo.<br>  Toma en cuenta lo siguiente:<br>  1. Todo tu mundo eres tú. Si te unes a una mujer. Forman uno. Conformando otro mundo. Su mundo son ustedes dos fundidos en uno solo.<br>  2. Si pretendes que la gente guíe tus pasos o tome las decisiones por ti, estás en un grave error, pues nadi más que tú y tu pareja deben de tomar sus propias decisiones. Buenas o malas, pero al fin y al cabo, propias, de nadie más. Si le haces caso a la gente jamás serás libre. <br>  3. El pasado de tu pareja no te debe importar. Así como a ella no le importa el tuyo. "El que esté libre de pecado, que arroje la primera piedra". Recuerda que tú también tienes un pasado y que de seguro no eres un santo. Tienes cola que te pisen. Olvídense del pasado. El pasado ya se fue, se esfumó. No existe. Vivan el presente que sólo es el día de hoy. El ma?ana también no existe, todavía no aparece en nuestras vidas, debemos esperarlo para poderlo disfrutar intensamente, como el día de hoy, como si fuera éste el último día de nuestra existencia. Porque no sabes qué día o qué noche Dios nos quita la vida. Esta vida que tenemos prestada que le pertenece a él. <br>  Si en ese barrio, al que llamas "todo mundo", le tiene tirria a tu novia, la critican, sin fundamento, ella puede demandarlas por difamación de honor; o bien, que comprueben lo contrario. Esto lleva su tiempo. Está en su derecho hacerlo. Para poner a "todo mundo" en paz. ?Quiénes conforman ese "todo mundo"? Para hacer la demanda se necesita citar a ese "todo mundo", cuántas personas son. Debes tú mencionarlas y en su caso, citarlas a declarar, puedes hacer esa lista? Las muedes llamar a cuentas ante un Juez?<br>  Por otro lado, si tanto te molesta lo que diga la gente de tu novia, cásate con ella, llévatela a vivir a "otro mundo", que no es más que otro barrio, otra colonia. <br>  Bájate del universo, vive en este planeta Tierra, en tu país, en tu estado, en tu ciudad, en tu municipio, en tu colonia, en tu barrio, en tu domicilio particular, en la casa de dos; la palabra casados eso significa: casa de dos. Donde únicamente ustedes pueden hacer su vida particular, íntima. <br>  No permitan a la gente que entre a su casa sólo a criticarlos.<br>  Su mejor Amigo es Dios, acérquense a él. Recíbanlo en su Hogar, a través de la Fe, porque donde hay Fe, hay Esperanza, donde hay Esperanza hay Caridad, donde hay Caridad está Dios y donde está Dios, no falta nada.<br>  Ordena tu mente, controla tus pensamientos, no te enredes, paso a paso, ve caminando por el camino del bien. <br>  Suerte.

Aún así, habrían preguntas que contestar, más que una respuesta.<br>  <br>  ?La quieres? ?te quiere? ?te importa mucho su pasado? ?está mal que cuando no estabais juntos tuviera relaciones con otros hombres? ?eso te dificulta mucho el quererla??crees que un futuro puede volver a pensar en estar con otros y traicionarte? ?hasta qué punto lo que oyes de ella puede ser cierto o habladurías?. Si dices que no confias en que diga la verdad, que si hablan algo de cierto hay ?crees que pueda estar diciéndote la verdad aunque ahora te sea difícil creerla? ?o estás seguro de que miente?.<br>  <br>  Me miro a mí mismo, y me pregunto con quién me gustaría estar, qué mujer.<br>  <br>  - ?Una que haya estado con muchos hombres solo por placer, no por amor?. No.<br>  - ?Que estuvo por amor antes del matrimonio pero se acabó? no lo sé.<br>  - ?Una que terminara siendo madre soltera, o que ya no esté con el que estuvo?. No.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  Así no me gustaría encontrarme con mujeres que aún no conozco. Pero conocí a una mujer que era madre soltera, y lo supe después de gustarme ella. ?Qué hice? no cerrarme a la posibilidad. Pero en principio eso no es lo que quiero, y no voy buscando eso.<br>  Yo empezaba a acercarme a iglesias evangélicas unos meses antes de conocerla. Y ella se abrió a mí. Me contó como llegó a ser madre soltera.<br>  Es toda una historia, si quieres te la cuento.<br>  <br>  Algo así te ha pasado a tí. Preferirías estar con una que no tuviese esa mala fama. Pero te encuentras que ya eres su novio.<br>  <br>  Si pudiera elegir las condiciones y la persona ideal, quizás nunca me encontraría con ella. Pero eso no significa que vaya buscando ni quiera estar con cualquiera.<br>  <br>  Antes solo que mal acompa?ado.<br>  <br>  Tengo muchas preguntas y pocas respuestas. Es cierto. Pero no es cierto que muchas veces ?nos apresuramos a responder?. No tengo una respuesta a esta pregunta ?con qué mujer compartiría mi vida? (y por tanto, ?con cuales no lo haría?).<br>  <br>  Tú quizás te haces preguntas parecidas, aplicadas a tu situación concreta. ?Sigo con esta mujer? ?es esto lo que yo quería? ?es esto lo que merezco?. ?La podré querer? ?saldrá alguna vez de mí malas palabras o algún reproche hacia su pasado?.<br>  <br>  Quizás no seamos santos. Pero tienes una idea de qué está bien y qué está mal, y sabes hasta dónde llegaste con tus excesos. <br>  <br>  Valoro mucho el darse a la otra persona, el que la otra persona se entregue a mí. Quererse con alma y cuerpo, con todo el corazón, aunque duela. Pero soy consciente que son muchos mis ideales, pero la realidad es difícil.<br>  <br>  ?Realmente puede darse a mí una mujer que ha estado con vete a saber quién? ?no le podrán los recuerdos?.<br>  <br>  Y sobre todo, ?hasta qué punto podré amarla y ella aceptar ese amor? pq si ella no se quiere a sí misma, como para darse, regalarse, llegar a estar con cualquiera, ?dónde está su capacidad de amar si ni siquiera se quiere a sí misma?.<br>  <br>  Me gustaría que escribieras qué te preocupa realmente. A qué estarías dispuesto.<br>  <br>  Con mis 32 a?os me gustaría encontrar una mujer que se entregara a mí como yo a ella. Me gustaría estar con una que se guardara de estar con hombres, porque me esperara a mí. ?Pero acaso yo esperé? me digo. Pasaban los a?os y me harté de idealizar estar con mi mujer, ni veía la forma de que ocurriera. Por timidez, por razones y sin-razones.<br>  <br>  La verdad, tengo más preguntas que respuestas. Lo sé.<br>  <br>  Que vaya a una iglesia evangélica habla muy bien de ella. Escrito está que el que se convierte nueva criatura es.<br>  <br>  He visitado estas iglesias, y para mí son de lo que conozco en cuanto a iglesias, las que mejor siguen el evangelio, en cuanto a doctrina; y en cuanto a obras, son personas como otras personas. Dios está enmedio de esas iglesias.<br>  No hagas caso a la tonta que escribe encima mío. Saca tus propias conclusiones. Para mí son más sectas las que dicen cree esto porque lo digo yo, sin dejarte espacio a fundamentar tu fe.<br>  <br>  Dale una oportunidad si realmente la quieres, y datela a tí mismo. Ama, y ama con fuerza. Dale confianza para que pueda ser contigo sincera. Que cure sus heridas, igual que tú tienes las tuyas. Ve con ella a la iglesia, que vuestra relación de enamorados se vea reforzada.<br>  <br>  Es tu decisión. Nadie decide por ti. ?Qué vas a perder si sigues con ella?. <br>  <br>  Respetala. No hagas como alguno aquí te dijo, de probar sus debilidades, para ver si es "fácil". Date tiempo y dale tiempo, para conocerla, si realmente sientes algo por ella. La conocerás igualmente y verás lo que puede dar de sí vuestra relación, sin arriesgarla.<br>  <br>  <br>  Si quieres contestaté preguntas. Como las que te he escrito, o como otras que tú te hagas. Y las escribes aquí, si quieres compartir, o te las respondes para ti. Quizás vayas aclarándote un poco más. Dialoga contigo mismo y con esta chica, pq si la amas, lo merece. :P. ?????Pq el amor es desmerecido!!!!!.<br>  <br>  Dios nos ama inmerecidamente, y por Gracia somos salvos, no por obras. Pero nuestra fe, como un buen arbol, si tenemos fe, da buenas obras.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|riBniPbaaa	El ser humano comete errores en su vida y se puede uno arrepentir; creo que lo que haya hecho en su pasado no tendría x que afectarte.

Ahora llevo tres a?os con mi novio y jamás se me ocurriría serle infiel porque los tiempos locos y de experimentar ya pasaron y ahora yo quiero buscar estabilidad y formar una familia. No le reproches su pasado que seguro que ella lo niega porque se avergüenza de él como yo, pero no vale la pena hay que mirar el futuro que es lo que cuenta y si tu la amas y ella te ama, confía en ella o la relación fracasará y no hagas caso de lo que la gente dice.|`|WNc8tNd7aa	mira como dice el dicho si el rio suena es que agua lleva yo digo que si es verdad lo que dicen de ella no puede ser que la gente hable cosas semejantes solo por que les cae mal o talvez alguna chava quiere contigo y anda corriendo ese rumor para que la dejes pero si es mucha jente algo debe haber de verdad|`|Y06myYgOaa	a lo mejor es cierto todo lo que se comenta de ella, pero eso es el pasado, yo te aconsejo que hables con ella y sin reclamos le pidas que se sincere contigo y hablen de esas cosas como algo normal, para que descubras realmente cuanto hay de mentira y de verdad en todo lo que has escuchado y te sientas mas tranquilo. Si ella realmente te ama, todas esas cosas quedaran atras y si tu la amas también no debe importarte su pasado, sino el futuro y el presente que viven juntos. Despues que se digan todo van vivir mas tanquilos y felices, porqueseguro que vos tampoco fuiste un santo antes, si tienes algunos secretillos  cuentaselos, da el primer paso para estimularla y hacerla sentir segura de poder hablar sus cosas.

Think of it this way, if you do make a fool out of yourself and you find out he does not like you then you did all of that for nothing. So, just tell him that you are really interested in him and you would like to get to know him better. Try hanging out as friends, dont come on too strong then later on talk about a relationship. You never know? You may be glad you did.Just take it slow. Be Safe, Be Smart..God Bless:)|`|4d439d02257393cf3294949378d2815eaa	"Desperate" is the right term, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I can't speak on this guy's behalf, but most guys I know would be flattered to be contacted so much.  That's not to say there's going to be a point where it appears very stalker-like and the guy gets creeped out.  I suggest a different approach.  Be honest and invite him to talk face-to-face.  Say something like, "I know I've called/texted/emailed you so much in the last few weeks, and I'm sure that's getting annoying.  I was wondering if you wanted to have lunch sometime or hang out?"  It's rather taboo in our society for girls to ask out guys, but the fact is guys are getting more and more shy to do these chivalrous, noble deeds like opening doors or asking girls out.  You'll have to admit to this for him to see you more than just a potential stalker.  Talk to him honestly (and not just when you're drunk).  Tell him exactly what you wrote in your question, "I just want to get to know (you) better."  You've had the answer all along!  Good luck!|`|trERH3oBaa	you can't build a relationship with "texting"<br>  see him once a week<br>  and see how that goes<br>  a guy who is interested will call you and want to be with you<br>  if he isn't doing that, then he isn't that into you|`|7cl15uH7aa	stop calling him when you are drinking. you are making a fool out of yourself when you are drinking. just relax. and call him when you wanna know how or what he is doing. just find out his likes and dislikes. hang out and do more stuff. find out what yall have in common. talk more on the phone.. hope this helps...|`|AA11565033	stop makin urself too available<br>  let him start tha first moves first|`|AA11870108	Seek professional help.|`|FA2wNHaZaa	First i believe you shouldnt call him when you're drunk he's gonna think you're like the rest and might not take you serious....<br>  Second dont text him wait until he does and if you feel like calling him call another friend bc if he doesnt pick up then you're gonna feel worse but try not to show him that you care let him make the move and then take it from there....<br>  Remember: if a guy really wants to talk to you or be with you...He will look for you!!!<br>  Good Luck!|`|JN4NcKSZaa	ok im a guy and i like it when girls do that and make the first move if he likes you then theres no way he thinks ur makin yourslef desprate he just thinks you care|`|XnO5ZCGnaa	just dont talk to him, play hard to get. guys always want thing they cant have|`|fQUg6eqXaa	if he really wanted to talk to you he would text or call you.. ease off|`|lATroCSSaa	You're way too jumpy.

If there is no way that a relationship is going to happen between the two of them, the guy just needs to accept that and decide whether it is worth the internal struggle (if there is any) to have this girl in his life.  If its going to be too hard, then just end the relationship and move on.|`|v6HOCvhBaa	Depends how attracted.

Entre todos querían ayudarme, porque la bulimia NO es una forma de vida, es un TRASTORNO ALIMENTICIO.<br>  Mi enfermedad derivó en anorexia, de la cual hace más o menos unos 4 meses que estoy algo mejor.<br>  Hasta entonces, vomitaba a diario y comía menos que nada.<br>  Mi novio lo sabía, y también me besaba a diario. <br>  No le desagradaba eso, pero sí odiaba mi enfermedad. él me decía que eso no era vida, y que tenía que poner fuerza de voluntad para salir...<br>  A mi al principio me daba igual, pero con el tiempo comprendí que amaba a mi novio, y si seguía así le acabaría perdiendo, porque él no tenía la obligación de aguantar a una enferma que vivía para contar calorías y vomitar lo que comía. <br>  Hubo un tiempo que pensé comó tú, que le daría asco y se lo pregunté. <br>  él me dijo que a veces sentía un poco de olor a agrio (porque cuando se vomita mucho se huele agrio, por mucha higiene dental que tengas) pero que eso no le daba asco, sino pena, lástima y que sentía mucha rabia.<br>  La última vez que vomité me llevó a casa y se puso a hablar conmigo.<br>  Me dijo que me amaba, muchísimo, pero que no podía seguir viéndome así. Cada día estaba más demacrada, más debil, y él quería volver con la chica jovial con la que empezó a salir. Que me quería, pero que sabía que lo que yo hacía estaba mal y no sabía donde podría acabar esto.<br>  Comenzó a llorar... y me pidió que no lo hiciese más... que quería que me curase, y que pusiese todas mis ganas para salir de ahí. Que él quería estar conmigo, pero necesitaba una prueba para saber que yo también le amaba, y el intentar curarme era esa prueba.<br>  Lo hice, poco a poco, con su ayuda y con la de mi familia. Yendo al médico, a un nutricionista y con apoyo psicológico.<br>  Sé que todos ellos lo pasaron muy mal, pero no sentía el dolor que les provocaba. Ahora que poco a poco estoy recuperándome, veo que las cosas van mejor y mi relación está mejor que nunca.<br>  Por favor... sé que no me conoces, pero a ellos sí, y no quieren que hagas eso. Ya no es solo por el asco que pueda darle a tu chico... hazlo por ti, por él, por tus padres, por tu salud... alimentandote correctamente... puedes mantenerte en un buen peso sin tener que recurrir a vómitos y laxantes...<br>  Piensa que lo más importante no es que él sienta asco, es que Tú ESTáS ENFERMA.<br>  No sé si estás en tratamiento, pero pide ayuda. De esto también se sale... te lo aseguro. Y por muy estúpido que te parezca... tu vida es mucho más importante que una báscula.<br>  Te doy todo mi apoyo, y deseo desde lo más profundo de mi corazón que reflexiones, que te des cuenta de que ni la BULIMIA ni la ANOREXIA es una forma de vida y que son curables.<br>  Cuidate amiga mía y no dudes en contactarme si necesitas hablar con alguien.<br>  Un beso, y espero no haberte aburrido.|`|MqQq3cXwaa	no soy hombre pero te dare mi opinion....<br>  no creo q tenga por q darle asco mas bien deveria procuparse por ti y tu salud y hacer algo al respecto.<br>  <br>  cuidate mucho.|`|ce976541d60c1e40ed83673e6ec87370aa	Si se sepilla los dientes no.

iJEyzgedaa	Un sentimiento es un estado del ánimo o una impresión acerca de lo que te está sucediendo. Es un mecanismo para avisarnos cómo es aquello que acontece en nuestra vida, si es "bueno ó malo"y todas sus variantes... Y eso es tanto para las cosas físicas como para las espirituales.<br>  <br>  Todo lo que directamente e indirectamente nos sucede, lo sentimos... y a veces lo presentimos (lo sentimos antes de que se manifieste externamente).<br>  <br>  Si sientes amor, es porque tu amor (el tuyo, el que llevas dentro) ha encontrado una vía para expresarse: otra persona, tu vocación, la religión, etc. El amor que se está expresando se siente como "muy bueno".<br>  <br>  Si se sientes ira, es porque hay una parte de uno que no puede expresarse correctamente, y eso genera frustración, que puede convertirse en ira... generalmente encuentra una manera no adecuada de expresarse que nos perjudica.  Y eso que se expresa, la ira, se siente como "malo".<br>  <br>  Para saber lo que te está avisando un sentimiento, no hay que racionalizar nada, sólo observar lo que sientes... no puedes racionalizarlo, porque la mente no siente, la mente piensa. Lo que si puede hacer la mente es analizar tu sentimiento, investigar porqué sientes lo que sientes y decidir qué hacer posteriormente.<br>  Pasa que el sentimiento te avisa "esto no es bueno, te harás da?o, ya te sientes incómodo o no del todo bien sólo de pensarlo, es un aviso"...pero la mente trata de encontrar RAZONES, para justificar una situación que deseamos... entonces uno puede no ajustarse del todo a la realidad de lo que acontece, debido al  autoenga?o. <br>  <br>  Si el sentimiento te avisa, igual que el bienestar ó dolor fisico que algo está andando bien ó mal en tu cuerpo... ?porqué deshechamos tan rápido lo que sentimos, cuando la mente trata de enga?arnos (pensando, no sintiendo)...diciendote: "?y si no fuera así?...mira, no hay RAZONES para que te sientas así".<br>  <br>  Pero creo que si en tu interior no te sientes cómoda/o con una situación o persona, no importa las razones que tenga la mente, es un aviso de todas formas.|`|TnY3akHNaa	lo que te genera una sensacion,,,,es algo abstracto|`|a4bb5faf0f5074806a154d2c34ff6f67aa	El sentimiento es el resultado de una emoción, a través del cual, el consciente tiene acceso al estado anímico propio. El cauce por el cual se solventa puede ser físico y/o Espiritual. Forma parte de la dinámica cerebral del ser humano, que le capacita para reaccionar a los eventos de la vida diaria.<br>  <br>  Los sentimientos son polarizaciones que hace nuestra mente de los hechos, y que dan forma a la felicidad. Su origen es el resultado del movimiento de las cargas emocionales a las cuales nuestra mente se ve sometida por la variación del medio. La mente establece el objetivo y los hechos fomentan o contrarrestan su consecución y preservación. La variación del estado preferente que hace la mente del objetivo, induce en ella el sentimiento que la motiva a actuar.<br>  <br>  No es posible evitar que sucedan y están regidos por las leyes que gobiernan el funcionamiento energético del cerebro. Inhibir un sentimiento equivale a fomentar un anhelo, postergar un anhelo fomenta una frustración o una vehemencia. Los sentimientos necesitan de una razón o cauce para ser satisfechos y hacernos sentir equilibrados.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dado que todos los individuos manifestamos los mismos sentimientos en diferentes situaciones, se puede decir que nunca hay dos situaciones iguales ni dos personas que manifiesten exactamente la misma intensidad del sentimiento desencadenado por un evento común a ellos. Ante esta evidencia, se puede afirmar sin temor a equivocarse que el ser humano es distinto, entre sus propios congéneres, en su forma de motivarse y que las personas responden de manera diferente a los sentimientos ajenos, algunas veces fomentando la carga y otras contrarrestándola.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Un suspiro del alma, que inspira los mejores pensamientos, las obras mas dulces y magníficas.

ye04GuiPaa	Pues para mi son sinonimos , pero me fui al Diccionario de la lengua espa?ola y aqui esta la definicion de ambas palabras:<br>  <br>  sinceridad.<br>  (Del lat. sincer?tas, -ātis).<br>  1. f. Sencillez, veracidad, modo de expresarse libre de fingimiento.<br>  <br>  franqueza.<br>  (De franco).<br>  1. f. Libertad, exención.<br>  2. f. Liberalidad, generosidad.<br>  3. f. sinceridad.<br>  <br>  Pues si son sinonimos solo que aqui me gustaria recalcar que para mi una de las principales bases de cualquier tipo de relacion es la sinceridad (franqueza) pero no debemos de confundir esto con el hecho de ofender a la gente, ya que conozco muchas personas que aprovechan el hecho de decir que son francas y ofender a sus semejantes y solo dicen "ES QUE YO SOY MUY FRANCO" y pues creo que eso no se vale, la sinceridad debe manejarse con responsabilidad y de manera positiva, <br>  <br>  te comparto esta cita <br>  "SI TUS PALABRAS NO SON  MAS BELLAS QUE EL SILENCIO, MEJOR NO DIGAS NADA" <br>  <br>  saluditos|`|dWlI460kaa	para mi es lo mismo|`|rJkD0alnaa	Siceridad... en tiempos antiguos se hacian estatuas conforme al gusto de las personas, solo que con el paso del tiempo empezaban a da~**** y para solucionarlo rellenaban con cera, cuando alguien hiba a comprar una estatua siempre decia, pero que sea sincera, quiere entonces decir que cuando una persona es sincera es hecha de una sola pieza...<br>  Franqueza... es mas que una expresion de una pesona que ves pero que no conoces, creo que el es franco o es la expresion de alguien que quiere que confies y creas en el te prometo que soy franco...<br>  Creo en mis propias palabras que la diferencia radica en que sinceridad es mucho mas significativa que franqueza...|`|yad6ZSgwaa	Yo creo que la persona que es sincera expresa sin menor dificultad sus sentimientos, sus ideas y sus deseos, no teme decir lo que siente y su comportamiento exterior muestra lo que es esa persona en su interior; y en cuanto a la franqueza, esta no solo abarca el ser sincero, sino que tambien se refiere a la lealtad, la  libertad, y la generosidad.|`|7FnR4iEZaa	Es lo mismo.|`|NkJ0p9cnaa	La sinceridad es simplemente decir la verdad, pero la franquesa va mas alla de eso, es decir las cosas como son aunque duelan, es decir lo que tienes que decir aunque, te afecte a nivel personal, tiene que ver mucho con ser honesto...y digno, cuando la correcto esta por encima de cuarquier cosa, y de cuarquier interes...eso es franquesa...la mayoria no lo somos...|`|TnY3akHNaa	sinceridad es una cualidad...franqueza es como la sinceridad pero aplicada en algo especifico<br>  <br>  la franqueza no disfraza en nada las cosas, en cambio la sinceridad es simplemente decir la verdad sin importar de si lo dices de forma dura o agradable|`|e233678e2a2d8fe6c894f71eefef400aaa	Sinceridad es verdad, y franqueza también es la verdad pero dicha de una forma mas brusca.|`|e7dfaca796ba7011cce2eb8eaf82dc4daa	ANALIZANDOLO FRIAMENTE, PARA MI SON SINONIMOS. TODO EL QUE ES SINCERO, ESTA ACTUANDO CON FRANQUEZA Y TODO EL QUE ES FRANCO, ESTA ACTUANDO CON SINCERIDAD. POR LO TANTO, SIN NINGUNA DUDA AFIRMO QUE ES LO MISMO.

zwH7q9MDaa	Mmm...<br>  he sido una mujer que ha buscado mucho el amor y en esa búsqueda cometí muchos errores o encontré personas equivocadas... de repente me nacía decirles "te amo" pero en el fondo sabía que no lo sentía.

Etre jaloux, c'est un manque de confiance en soi, et aussi en l'autre. Ca peut rendre la vie insupportable. Au contraire, la confiance est une preuve d'amour. Quand quelqu'un me dit qu'il a confiance en moi,c'est très valorisant, et je ferais tout pour ne jamais trahir sa confiance, je m'en voudrais. Je pars du principe que je ne ferais pas aux autres ce que je n'aimerais pas qu'on me fasse. A partir de là, et si tout le monde voyait les choses de la même fa?on, la vie serait beaucoup plus simple. Mais c'est loin d'être le cas, c'est peut-être pour ?a que je suis toujours seule!!!<br>  A méditer!|`|Eacuzgm1aa	Oui, je crois bien que la jalousie est une vraie preuve d' amour.|`|YUuLjwQ5aa	C'est une preuve de possession en tt cas...|`|ef19815a699d6c14565c269714252bb8aa	oui, par contre si c'est maladif ?a dénote surtout un cruel manque de confiance en soi-même|`|r7hdzBOTaa	Oui... mais à forte dose c'est de l'égo?sme! Attention à consommer avec modération comme tout le reste d'ailleurs!|`|2d31d749f3d44b1fcdecdb1b6d3a2e99aa	Cela depend à quel stade..................|`|58ad6e079cd9a4a7ae1f62925ce6e9e4aa	attention c'est faux !|`|6HnrIEnPaa	pour moi oui c'est parfois embettant mais sa prouve qu'il/qu'elle vous aime et qu'il/qu'elle à peur de te perdre|`|Dgxj2cBkaa	non pas du tout et si tu rencontre un (ou une) jaloux fuit le plus loin possible|`|HvqlrA7Xaa	la jalousie modérée fait du bien|`|R8tznllCaa	Non, la jalousie n'est pas une preuve d'amour mais un manque de confiance. C'est un vilain défaut destructeur.|`|YhNPtFojaa	La jaloux étouffe et tue un couple|`|b43b0aab3fbf2005d7ca1899628f193aaa	A faible dose, oui! Sinon, si c'est maladif, c'est que la personne manque beaucoup de confiance en elle et envers le partenaire...|`|cFVPstx2aa	L'amour est souvent source de jalousie mais la jalousie excessive n'est pas une preuve d'amour. Elle ne traduit que le manque de confiance en lui même et en l'autre du jaloux.|`|cd2bc93a0cc48ff7d947ba965884492daa	non cela prouve un mal être. l'autre ne nous apprtient pas et à contrario il faut se battre our garder l'autre mais ne pas lui faire passer ses doutes, l'aimer le sublimer ?a c'est un preuve d'amour|`|dMs2Lp3Taa	La jalousie amoureuse est un sentiment différent de la jalousie-envie .C'est un mélange de peur et de colère engendré par l'insécurité. L'insécurité porte parfois sur sa propre valeur et parfois sur sa valeur pour l'autre. <br>  <br>  On pourrait dire que la jalousie amoureuse est la peur de voir sa place être ravie dans le coeur de l'être aimé. Il peut s'agir de la place qu'on a réellement et qu'on craint de perdre, mais il s'agit souvent de celle qu'on n'a pas vraiment, sans trop se l'avouer. <br>  <br>  Dans la jalousie amoureuse, on éprouve de la colère à l'égard de celui qui la suscite parce qu'il nous met dans l'insécurité: on a peur de perdre ce dont on jouit ou dont on voudrait jouir. On craint que notre besoin affectif en cause soit frustré. <br>  <br>  Mais la jalousie a ces degré trop de jalousie étouffe la personne et elle fuit son conjoint au lieu de ce rapprocher de lui toute choses a ces limites il faut juste savoir bien mesurer les choses|`|eVoPAZ4Waa	Bien s?r que c'en est une. Et tout un chacun l'apprécie, je crois, à condition que cela ne provoque pas des scènes démesurées sur des points sans intérêt remettant en cause le présent.<br>  Il est possible de concevoir une forte jalousie et des reproches si celle ou celui qu'on aime s'intéresse à quelqu'un d'autre, ce qui relègue au second plan et qui prouve le non amour, mais si ce n'est pas le cas, l'Amour est pur et doit être protégé et entretenu co?te que co?te.|`|i6IkWh3eaa	la jalousie est une preuve d'amour mais si elle n'est pas controulée elle detruit l'amour|`|kPruxMIIaa	oui sauf si il ou elle et jalouse maladif c a dire jaloux pour un objet ou de quelqun tout le tps|`|lnHsD4mjaa	Biensur que la jalousie est une preuve d'amour, ca peut vite devenir un tue l'amour.|`|4a27b82bf4e1c6eb1c0397cc13792b8aaa	oui et non car etre jaloux c'est ne pas etre sur de soi aussi avoir peur qu'un autre puisse mieux . ce serait bien mieux d'etre fier de son partenaire même si celui ci plait a d'autre mais si tu en es fier c'est montrer que tu ne crains pas les autres que tu es sure de toi .<br>  des fois on peut etre jaloux si par exemple dans une reception tu n'as quasi pzas le droit de danser avec le partenaire , ca peut créer une jalousie donc il faut que des deux cotés on soit conscient de sa liberté tout en étant sur de son amour|`|0386b2a33e9d5718227685ecede85830aa	la jaluisie demontre l'amour de la femme mais trop exgere blesse cet amour.il faut une jaluisie inteligente et moderée|`|6df8878ab252b293b25d6f006e38dcc7aa	Non, c'est peut-être même le contraire . . .<br>  Quelqu'un qui n'a pas confiance c'est quelqu'un qui n'aime pas !|`|df94a04628dc0f79b10bedacd543350aaa	Oui mais ne pas trop étouffer l'autre.|`|e220f5832d2ace78b0d8da95b835dadbaa	Je ne crois pas... Au début c'est rassurant de penser ?a. Et si on tombe avec qqun qui n'est pas jaloux du tout, on est presque déstabilisé en pensant qu'il ne nous aime pas, mais finalement ce n'est pas vrai.<br>  Et au bout de qques années avec qqun qui est vraiment trop jaloux, on plaque tout parce qu'on n'en peut plus...<br>  Je sais de quoi je parle|`|mnMX9hTKaa	oui mais il ne faut pas entrer dans un monde qui renferme et qui enlève toute forme de sociabilisation , la jalousie c'est bien pour  montrer mais il ne faut pas en abuser.
AA10302172	You have to talk to him!  If you don't feel the same way about him, you need to talk to him and tell him you aren't ready for a relationship.  Tell him exactly what you said to us, but in a nicer way, if you can because guys can be really sensitive too.|`|EEZGn6gTaa	Just tell him you love him as a friend, but you do not want him for your boyfriend.  See, YOU get to pick who is or is not, your boyfriend.  Don't stress over this, just be your sweet self, but tell it like it is....<br>  :)|`|4tznB4YHaa	Depends how old he is.  By the time a guy is in his early twenties, he's been rejected dozens of times.  Happens to the best of us.  He'll get over it.  If you're honest; better than giving him false hope.  He'll most likely refocus his energy in another direction.  Hey, in baseball if a guy strikes out 60% of the time he's paid millions of dollars a year!|`|AA10069405	Do you know this for sure? If so, tell him away from all of your friends that you don't have the same feelings for him that he does for you; explain to him that you just want to be friends.|`|AA11627685	Dont say any thing in less you are for sure he likes you.  Then just tell him you would not want anything to mess up your friendship.|`|tsOq2Slraa	BE nice, let him down slow. It all depends on how you say things, like "I like you I always have but only as a friend"|`|Tp2VxHVaaa	just tell him u dont feel the same b/c its better than u guys going out for like a week them you saying to him I never really liked u I just didnt want to hurt ur feelings|`|cYsXznvHaa	i had the same prob but my bestfriend helped me out she told me to just get it over and tell him it wouldn't work out and or it would start getting worst and harder to do so i did it I didn't feel the best till a couple of days later(3 days).But try this it will work for sure.<br>  <br>  wit much love, LadyBrown<br>  <br>  P.S If he really liked you he will slug around and u will have to talk to him,just like I did but now we are friends again.it took(5days)for us.|`|lHvVcZG2aa	be honest,let him know how u feel,if he is a true friend he will except your honesty.|`|rG1c1DFYaa	Wait for him to tell you. Then just be honest about how you feel We do not all care about each other the same way. You can not control how he will react. But you never want to hurt someone by being dishonest. If he is your best friend tell him so if you have no physical or romantic feeling for him just say so.|`|tDwVRQEyaa	Help! Help! No one has given the correct answer!!!  You keep these guy friends around to boost your ego. You like the attention. Shut up stupid. You know he likes you. Now you have created drama because you love it. But I don't feel sorry for the guy because he is a dummy too.
tQCW8e15aa	I totally agree, why give something that should be precious away to just anyone.  All it is is people who are afraid to commit, and you're right, its nothing more than prostitution.  This is one of the main reasons people's marriages are failing today, people are tought that you shouldn't have to commit to anyone but urself.  What a selfish way to live|`|0c9ea495e40e98b59b80023b9ff26225aa	You are definitely NOT the only one... it is like saying " you are hot enough too f**k, but you are not even worth enough to commit to. I just want to get what I want, but don't ask for anything that goes with a relationship."  I mean, 80% of what is good in a real relationship is the fidelity, the love, the security, the commitment, and the obligation. If you take all that away and just keep the sex..... you have nothing but an animal.... you take away what sets humans apart, and you make sex out to be like food or water.... it isn't a nessecity.... it is supposed to be out of love!|`|XFaF521Naa	I totally agree! Girls who are freinds with benifets with guys make them sound slutty! Guys just do this so they can sleep with as many girls as they can. I mean some girls end up being pregnat and then guess what, you lost, the baby will end up having no father. Then if you get an STD you won't be able to have sex again because you'll spread it. You can also become steril and you wont be able to have children. So you pretty much get screwed both ways. So yeah, I totally agree with you!|`|de1288e43115c0c8a296c58411a62bbdaa	People who foolishly ignore teaching abstinence actually teach that it is okay to have sex with whoever as long as you protect yourself.  People have lost their sense of morality.  It is all about education and lack of it.  People say "kids are going to do it anyway".  Well, kids are going to do it more informed and a lot later if the parents do their job.  Handing out condoms and condoning sex isn't a good start.  Talking and teaching kids actually does work.  Teaching abstinence isn't a bad thing.  Friends with benefits is just one result of poor parenting and lack of education.|`|fC1pKlLHaa	I think its really disgusting. What's scary is that it's becoming more acceptable between younger and younger groups! In general, the practice is horrible. I have younger nieces and nephews and it makes me sick to think of their friends putting pressure on them to participate in this kind of risky, degrading behavior. <br>  <br>  There's a major breakdown in communication happening: the ppl who do this would rather sleep with their friends, than take the chance of meeting new people. They also take the chance of passing around the same STD cocktail to one another. Eeeegh, I can't imagine sharing a glass with a friend if I found out they were doing this kind of thing.
nNCXETHnaa	Just tell her stop calling me im sorry but i dont like you and if she ask why just say your not sexually attracted to her... im sure she'll take it rough but dont we all when we find out are crush dosent like us.|`|c0fe6d7cbea251aa5fff743e685bafc9aa	wanna know why you dont like big girls?  cause you're a small man, pissant!  just answer when she calls and try to nicely explain to her that you're not interested in her.<br>  mkay? <br>  cya|`|JbLwJztVaa	talk to her and let her know you are not interested in her and ask her not to call you any more!!!  by not answering her calls she may think your are interested!! I know that sounds strange but unless you set her straight she will keep calling|`|t1GKGQYFaa	Big girls need loving too, but i suggest that you just be honest and tell her that your not the one. Or you can just say that your gay,...(the last part was by my friend whose a girl)
dOmG4TKiaa	what!! I think you should call him and ask him where he is..was...not really sure if he already did this or is doing it..but still..call him and ask what is going on! Just be straight forward about this! You deserve to know!|`|a9edf71cdaa0f9ac307e3492a0235c8faa	Just be upfront about it. Tell him that you know where he went and you know he wasn't alone. Ask if he has anything to say to you about what's happening between the two you. Ask him that if he no longer wants to be faithful to you then to let you know so that you two can part your ways. You deserve better than that and no one has the right to make a fool of you. <br>  GOOD LUCK! leave the scum......leave him in the ground.
61aca824c17ff21e3417ecfadbc0bef9aa	tell her that if she doesn't stop, then you should just not hang out with her. she can be a loner.|`|27921d90b55082a3e00928aecfa65688aa	Personally i can't deal with liars, it makes me angry when people lie to me about anything.|`|VnANJK0vaa	U should confront her.|`|9033b9b94c0ca4bc14fc8629676ef571aa	you cant stop that from happening,she is a compulsive liar,she has to tell one lie and then another than another.for some people they make themselves feel big by lying.|`|AA11490393	you can't control what other ppl do. You have to accept what other ppl and either deal with it or cut them off.|`|aaf97f5f7aa19cd5eb5ae1f2a6b96b58aa	if it were me. I would just tell her to just stop lying. and  be honest.|`|LXAnAWb4aa	you should tell her before she gets into trouble... if she is your friend you'll never let her get into it so you should tell her but if you won't it may become worse... people might get rid of her or might never listen or trust in what she say... I know she'll understand you if you'll try to tell her in a way that she won't be hurt much...|`|ihCZ7ddOaa	Try to understand what is happening in her life. What background does she come from? If she has parents that ignore her, for example, she may feel extremely unimportant. Unfortunately, you can't really ask her what her life is really like, so you will have to come to a conclusion based on what you have seen.<br>  The person that lies, usually does so so that they get some feeling of importance (they lack self-worth, even if they look like they cope well with things). People who have family issues, and feel invisible are usually the ones that can become compulsive liars.<br>  You need to find a way to let her know that you know she's lying, and that she should speak to a counselor about her problem, and that you'll be there to help her. Tell her also, that it will eventually affect your friendship, because lying causes you to not trust a person, and that you wont be able to trust her is she doesn't find a way to stop. <br>  Hope everything works out :)
6M06Zoh0aa	well dreams can somethimes be misleading but sometimes they can be right.<br>  <br>  what i think it means is that him being a bad kisser means your not very compatible... i mean  like i don't think theres such thing as a "bad" kisser but its just compatible kissers.<br>  <br>  and since you had to hide it may seem that if you get into a relationship you wouldn't be able to make it official in public.<br>  <br>  and the walking at different paces and being never able to keep up may mean that you have more energy and spunk in you thanhe does so he's more of the relaxed lay back stay home kind of guy and you're the spontaneous go out all the time kind of girl.|`|LvYhv6zfaa	People have dreams all the time. The dreams they have sometimes involve people in their real life and some are fictional. <br>  It doesn't mean anything. It's a dream.|`|6hzS9Yj8aa	probably their is no reason. but maybe u feel that he is too far away from u and no matter what u wont be able to catch up or vice versa.and the reason ur hiding is cuz ur hiding the truth that u like him. it might just be ur insercurties or lack of confidence to tell him u like him in real life so its messing with u in ur dreams.|`|kIKtox7Raa	no|`|vDtsPo7Vaa	Sounds like this is not the guy for you.Choose wisely

Lembra do filme "Ela é a Diaba", se n?o assistiu, assista. Mandou os filhos junto do marido e da nova esposa. E foi ser livre e feliz. Bem, seus filhos tb est?o passando por momentos até mais difíceis que vc agora, pois eles n?o entendem porque tudo isso está acontecendo e v?o fazer de conta que est?o felizes, que a vida agora está mais legal, p/ abafar o sofrimento que est?o sentindo e n?o entendem o que é.Tenha bastante paciência  c/ eles, mas tenha pulso firme tipo: Agora EU sou a mulher e o homem da casa.Se n?o for dura, por dó, sua vida será um inferno e VC, e n?o o seu marido,será responsável pelo possível desencaminhamento de seus filhos. Filho PRECISA de amor e limites, sen?o n?o se respeitar?o, muito menos a vc e aos outros, e sofrer?o as consequências de seus atos errados. N?o se sinta culpada.Assuma, é sua obriga??o de m?e.

d39b31a16bdbfc272e596512a6bd9aceaa	Depends on what you are determined about.  Of course being determined must be shown by actions, becuase you may be determined to do something; but sit on your butt and do nothing.  So for simplicity sake we will assume that determined means you are doing anything and everything you can do to attain/achieve your goal. <br>  <br>  For instance lets say you are 100% determined to lose weight, then yes you will lose weight.   Something that is soley dependant on you attaining your goal is posible if you are determined.  <br>  <br>  If however there are variables outside of yourself, then no matter how determined you are it may not turn out how you want it.  Like in relationships, or employment.  You may be very determined to get a particular job, or have someone as your boyfriend/girlfriend; but if the other party decides no then no matter how determined you are the answer is still no.|`|57a32719684b869238f6ec4030c6a944aa	absolutly NOT, however, if you are that determined you will not give up until you find a way to make it work in your favor ^.^|`|G7dvZtAZaa	No, of course not...|`|95775478128351b0f007e695425f20eaaa	Nope; u have to be 110% determined|`|9HPUzoJRaa	determined about what?|`|AA10949476	no, it doesn't always work out in your favour. sometimes is a just luck.|`|AA11811572	its a lot of times luck

n8XoOn3faa	Don't worry, you will find a decent girl otherwise she will find you. There is nothing wrong with your looks or your style. Perhaps your girl friends say you are "cute" and "nice" cuz they think of you as just a friend type, and maybe you need to show the boyfriend type potential you have by being more flirtatious? I don't know, don't change anything up unless you do it naturally.

eh5pBKrbaa	No.  Registries are a convenince for the guests so they don't have to spend hours figuring out what to get you.  IF THEY WANT TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  It is tacky to put that information on your inviations, yes.  If/where you are registered is spread through word of mouth by yourselves, your parents, or the bridal party when somone asks where you are registered or what to get you.  It is acceptable to put this info on your wedding website if you have one as long as it isn't the first page that is opened up to and you don't have a big banner screaming "look where we reigstered!"<br>  <br>  Gifts are optional and as long as you remember that and treat them that way you will be fine.|`|2jwm7asgaa	no that is what usually happens if you need stuff for the house. <br>  <br>  it doesnt matter, its completely up to the guest to buy something, and if they dont want to then oh well at least your registered and you will get stuff you need|`|752dae63ebe2a79c118bfda479a539f7aa	Not at all.|`|AA11538639	It is most appropriate to register for gifts...<br>  <br>  esp if the convenience of the guests <br>  is what you have in mind...|`|ETgvd9Euaa	My husband was previously married, and since most of his stuff after the divorce were hand me downs or garage sale purchases, we registered at 3 stores.  It was my first marriage and even though I had just inherited my house and all it's contents, there were things we wanted to replace due to either age or just not our styles.  Registering is a convenience for not only the couple but the guests that choose to use it.  I say go out and register!|`|L8vTzMDlaa	NO ITS NOT TACKY. So what if he is divorced???  Its YOUR first wedding and you are celebrating your marriage to each other. ANyone who thinks it is tacky shouldnt be invited.|`|MVYXRqSZaa	registering is usually to get gifts for the home that you dont have because you are starting off together w/o really much of anything... (materialisticly speaking).  if you aren't already living together and will be moving in after the wedding then i say go for it.  but if you live together and already have towels a potato peeler and pots and pans then its not as accepted but you can still do it since its YOUR NEW LIFE TOGETHER.|`|Qp2j90Ytaa	Register for gifts.<br>  <br>  it is convenient for both you and your guests.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|PsrLweKIaa	Of course not. It's not only tradition, but it is convenient and hassle free way for guests to give a gift.  If you are spending thousands on feeding and hosting your guests, they will want to give you something to help start your new life.  If you don't want gifts, elope! Best wishes!!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, but just don't include ANY information about gifts or registries on the invitation, or as an insert. If people don't know what to get you, they will ask the families.|`|AA10673237	No, not at all, especially with it being the bride's first wedding.  Both still need new things for their home.|`|Drvv3hhQaa	never.|`|a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	No.  You probably do need stuff.|`|c1e995b9ce8779e6e777816b269f7246aa	It doesnt matter if it is his 2nd wedding, it is still your first and it is still very appropriate to have a registry. It is considered to be the polite thing to do because most guests will want to purchase a gift and with a registry they'll know they will be getting you something you want.  You should choose many items in differing price ranges so there is enough to choose from.  Congrats on your wedding.|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	Oh why don't you people do your homework, i.e., look up this information in an etiquette book or online.

Pero si estuviera en esa situación, hablaría directamente y mirando a los ojos, con palabras claras pero nunca ofensivas, tratando de ganar un amigo (a), si ya está perdido el amor.<br>  Las relaciones amorosas deben tratarse siempre con la verdad, aunque a veces esta sea un poquito dolorosa. En mi caso, solamente tuve 3 novios. El primero nunca supo que yo fui su novia, pues yo lo amé en silencio hasta que supe que tenía novia y entonces lo saqué de mi sentimiento. El segundo lo amé intensamente, pero embarazó a otra muchacha y aquel incidente, acabó con mucha tristeza, con el amor que le tenía y con el tercero me casé y es el padre de mis hijos, pero nos divorciamos hace 16 a?os por diferencias ideológicas, pero gracias a Dios, mantenemos buena comunicación, por el beneficio de nuestros hijos.

But the problem was she never came back and left me there for hours. I dont remember what i did make her do this. I dont think i did anything. At least if u get hit its only last a few seconds when it occurs but this type of punishment is everlasting and happened to me more than once. My dad was at work but when he came home i kicked the wall with my feet and he came in and saw me and said what are you doing sitting then come on out. If wasnt sent to room by my mom id be hiding from her and would go downstairs under brothers bed so she couldnt hit me cause I was threatened. my brother wasnt there so if he was at school i wasnt old enough to go yet so probably age 3, 3 1/2. dont know which of these is worse for a kid to experience but was enough to give me real life nightmares waking up i was told sleep walking crying and screaming and only kid that had that and that type of punishment.

My family was ahead of me and I was picking my steps too carefully and they wanted me to hurry up but I kept saying I was scared, probably whining, I don't remember. But I got my butt, back, hands, legs, neck spanked with a belt and hands by both parents because they wanted to go home NOW and I wouldn't walk through the weeds faster and I had stopped and screamed when I went through a spider web.  My fingers were bruised and sprained, broken, for weeks and Mom put popsicle sticks and bandaids on them as splints. The teacher at school did nothing about it by the way.  She just let me take as long as I needed to to write, cut, whatever. But it was the worst, I say, because it is the one that sticks out in my mind as a time that made NO SENSE whatsoever.

656cf1b993e1bb760cdded9ef30f2e13aa	I hate to say this, but, you should let her go.  Sounds like she is using you.  There are so many women out there that can make you happy and that want to be with you.  Happy hunting.|`|Rtn8kXsAaa	Sorry, I don't know. We've been married 34 years.|`|c24a17e3faf2c44bf07ce2b3ae1056fcaa	I did this once. I was dating a guy for 2 years and we broke up and stayed friends and I dated several guys over the next 2 years and I got in a relationship and caught the guy in bed with another girl and I went to my ex's house and we had sex and I left and he was shocked but it was the oppisite cause neither one of us was in love with each other. It has been 6 years since that happened and me and him are still really good friends and we both are married now. Its called being immature. If you still love her and she dosent feel the same way dont go near her because she will just hurt you. Dont let her.|`|08d51d556fe5b8a33940fc4c4a4e7b03aa	Don't worry...if it's meant to be, then you two will be reunited together somehow! Best of luck!|`|BxBejek5aa	If you want her back, be the supportive friend who doesn't stay the night and listens to all the sh*t she says about her ex. Two weeks is not long enough, and I guarantee she'll go back to him if you get together this early.|`|LBFji3AUaa	dude as tha other dude said. I dont care i want tha points haha. Good luck though man for real.|`|ZzySwlSeaa	I have friends that do that and it sounds like she might just be dragging you along... My brother had the same problem with a girl and he finally got over her after 2 years! But I dont really see away of getting her back... And most dont do that so I would try dating someone else and if that makes you feel worse just tell her how you feel about her! (your ex)|`|00e499c791af32c6b7b5e64dc37479d0aa	I think she's re-bounding right now, and you're safe and available.  Sorry if that sounds harsh, but the only way you will have a chance at a real relationship with your ex is if you stay away from her until she's emotionally over the other guy.  If you hook up too fast, you're just going to get hurt, and it might kill any hope for getting back together in the future.|`|3r6pEbwOaa	You sound like a really great guy,one any girl should be lucky to have. But your girlfriend lost interest in you, found another guy, and is now using you for comfort. She has no intent on going back with you. You've become a 'girlfriend' to her. And you're too good for that. Let her go. don't look back and learn from this relationship, because you don't want to waste another three years of your life again.<br>  Go to www.doclove.com and find out what you did wrong to make her lose interest in you. Doc Love (not his real name) is a man who's been studying women for 30 years. He knows everything...You'll also find him at www.askmen.com. <br>  I hope you take this advise. Some lucky girl out there deserves you, and you deserve the best.<br>  Blessings|`|8x0h3QbHaa	If your "old" ex was better to and for you and if you still have feelings even tho you may hide them for that ex...no cheating involved by the way if its an EX lol....|`|984b5325e66493e4bcf62ab5943d7b5faa	Even though you've been in a relationship, you have to be friends first. You have to take it slow and be there when needed and don't try to throw it in her face that you want her. And the part bout the cheating, you got adjusted with you old that the new don't live up to standards as the old one did.|`|Ei5pppWcaa	If he is an ex then it isn't cheating. Right? But I would never ever cheat on anyone!|`|LQ7RD7Ciaa	honey shes USING you i would probably do the same thing. its a female thing if u can't have someone than you settle for the next best thing. please take my advice to move on. by giving in you are showing complete vulnerability and having low pride.

Your forgetting some words and letters in your sentences, so yeah.|`|OAhGZB16aa	sometimes the love never goes away to make sure we don't get hurt we sometimes choose the easy way out to be with the one we love friendship. If you want her back tell her how you feel and take the relationship to the next level. Some times that's what they want to hear. Being with her 4, 3yrs you should know what she wants already. It done hurts so there is no harm in trying.|`|Rw1R28lqaa	I think she has issues and u should leave her out of your life completely.|`|WgwpSQkZaa	You posted this exact same question yesterday, so I'll give you the exact same answer:<br>  <br>  She's messed up. She's confused. She's hurt. She doesn't know what she wants. That's no excuse, though: She's throwing you in a tough position and taking advantage of you. <br>  <br>  Get away while you can, otherwise you're asking to get your heart broken again (because you will). <br>  <br>  By the way: She's not "cheating" on her new ex if he's exactly that: an ex.|`|X1Do7x5Uaa	It sounds to me like she's using you as her fallback guy while her and her new guy are on the rocks.  Do yourself a favor and don't fall for it again.  I realize you love her still, but it's only going to get you hurt in the end.  You are worth more than that.|`|apPL223Vaa	not every girl is the same..she just doesnt know what she wants. give her some time to think.|`|atwGGAeHaa	No offense, but I think this chick is only trying to make the other guy jealous. Since you're obviously still into her, maybe you should still spend some time away from her and hang with someone new for a while. If she really loves you, she'll realize it and come back to you.|`|sPTsTdPiaa	I've never cheated. I think cheating is for the lowest of the low. Once a cheater - always.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can't have your cake and eat it too.<br>  Your better off without her.

g6dIJmCLaa	i think the happy birthday would be cute.. but i think itd be better if you showed up to her house with idk.. a card or something and explained to her that you love her and wanna get back with her... if she feels the same thatd be the best bday present.. the only problem with this is that if she doesnt feel the same.. then that mite be hard on you .. so you could go with the text and judging by her response you do that.. its a good starter but if she feels the same way i think it deserves a little more than a text|`|2Prlj7wWaa	Dont do it. Wish the Happy Bday and say I love you in person.|`|484329e07aeecda22087acbf87f07fefaa	It's never bad to say you love someone. What's bad is if you're saying it in a text because you can't say it in real life.<br>  If you love the girl (really) it would probably mean more to her if it was said in real life.<br>  If that seems too silly, then try asking her out in a more straightforward way.<br>  For just a nice birthday gesture, it would probably be nice enough if you said happy birthday and maybe a small, nice comment. Telling her you love her out of the blue, in a text, probably isn't the best idea.|`|AA10947632	i think you should. <br>  i would like it if somebody said that too me especially on my birthday <br>  <br>  GOODLUCK MAN! :DD|`|a8DyyqZVaa	it cant do any hurt|`|j42Tsc3jaa	Okay! First of all, telling a girl that you love them for the first time is never okay not in person!!! You should go over and tell her in person, or just wish her a happy b-day!

Take it from a female, me, or a friend!|`|NmC4Nh7Waa	do it <br>  id love it<br>  and if she says something negative play it off <br>  as if you meant in the friendly way|`|d107a66f105e195f090c296ea6ac5b01aa	Everybody loves it when they are loved by someone else. The best way is to tell them in person, and is the most meaningful. But if you do it any other way, it is perfectly fine when you mean it. Just be careful not to say it unless you mean it.
uVHl0LExaa	Ever one has there own taste.<br>  <br>  For me I like a woman with curves, but not large boobs.  A nice shaply bottom and she knows how to arch her back very well.

uVH3IoTjaa	Ask her out.<br>  <br>  A relationship happens because two people want it to, and those to people are you & "Sarah" not you and your mate.  If he hasn't got the stones to go ask her himself then why wait on him.  If some other guy asks her out you will both miss out.<br>  <br>  If she does say yes to dating, sure he might be a little bit jealous, but really that is hard cheese.  There are plenty of women in the world, and he will just have to find one of the 3 billion other ones.<br>  <br>  I could understand his position if he had previously dated her, but this - no way man.  Ask her out.|`|g95kNFL0aa	hmmm, thats a tough, one isn't it....I think Its really unfair to your friend if your helping him get the girl he wants, then stabbing him in the back and asking her out yourself. It won't be a pretty picture and your friend probably won't be your friend anymore. I'm sure you really like this girl and everything, but you said yourself you've been friends for a long time and you don't want to get into a situation where you'll have to choose between them. Sure, you can still be friends right?|`|iWPCk88Waa	Talk to your friend first of all. He deserves to know. And maybe you could compromise. I don't really know how. My suggestion: Get him to agree on both of you being ONLY her FRIEND. Not more. That way your relationship will last longer and as soon as he moves on to other girls (which is very probable in most cases) you've built a strong enough base with her to push things to a higher level. Plus you keep your friend. Best of luck!|`|dOmG4TKiaa	I think you should talk to you friend about liking her too and ask if its ok to ask her out which i'm guessing he would prob say no but ask anyways.... and you still need to tell him to let him know you can't keep helping him ask "Sarah" out  any more because you like her too. But really man you have to ask yourself which is more important your friendship w/ your friend or dating "Sarah"?
owdCD8Ghaa	mostly likely you will have to talk to him tell him how you feel maybe it will work out maybe it wont ... what do you have to loose|`|SWTFjpgXaa	I've learnt one thing in life: for whatever reason guys break up with you, the always come back!!!! This doesn't happen to women. I think this guy regrets ending things with you, or he will sooner or later. Unfortunately I don't know if he regrets it because he loves you, because he needs some attentions or just because he doesn't have anything else to do/anyone else around. That is up to him!
58c5aaed6b48decd02778ea8840cc3f9aa	YES YOU CAN!!!!<br>  I am twenty~seven years old and I know exactly what you are going through sweetheart.It is hard to be yourself when you lack confidence....I spent my whole life up until recently being a wall flower,never being heard or feeling understood...I have come to realize that being afraid was a waste of time,and not only that but everyone gets scared...everyone wants to feel accepted and loved.Don't be like me and hide how beautiful you are from the world....I wish I could go back and change my life but it is too late for that.You however still have time to make a difference in yours...My advise BE TRUE TO YOURSELF!Speak up and be heard.Allow yourself the opportunity to show the world what a lovely and unique individual you are!You have nothing to lose hun,But so much to gain.Good Luck;)|`|INyotLeCaa	Dear Sylvia,<br>  You are probably just imagining that your friends are ignoring you.  give them a chance to redeem themselves before you go huffing off mad.  Friends are hard to come by.  I know you are having family problems at home, but try to find out about someone else, and see if you can help them solve their problems.  Lots of times, when we try to help someone else we usually end up helping ourselves more.  God bless you!<br>  Grams|`|OLGNFGr6aa	hm...like the others say "be yourself" when u start the next schoolyear. Now may b too late so while ur going to a new school, plz try to be urself. If nobody cares about u in friendship problems, then just dont talk to them, dont even bother to. U are left out b/c ur not speaking up for urself therefore, no one knows what u want...speak up, be brave and confident most importantly. I need to work on tht too. ;)|`|VYtnh1cFaa	This is hard to answer because I dont know why you can't be your self? Any one can be what ever they want to be if there not afraid.|`|ec7d48fd8d25051bd5d895aa91fe68d6aa	just be yourself.  i know thats terrible advice, but its all i got.  ive been in your shoes, i changed friend groups and was myself.  my old friends think im kinda weird now, but they are nice to me still.  my family still has issues, but ill be leaving sooner or later, so im holding out till then.<br>  it cant get worse, right?
AA12058986	I think this guy could already have a girlfriend. <br>    My reasons for thinking this are that he enjoyed your chat and maybe a little flirtation because it was spontaneous but having spent time with his girlfriend since then he maybe feels that to carry on and maybe in his mind lead you on would be unfair on you and his partner. <br>    If he feels that carrying on being friendly with you could possibly lead to a more intimate feeling between you, he may not be able to ignore it if that happens. Some men, cannot help themselves and in his mind, ignoring you is the best way to stop anything more happening.<br>    This is just one theory for his behaviour, in truth I may be way off the mark.|`|1QtnWB5kaa	had a bad day at work|`|54ac13efab46178042b0cb2602cc9138aa	maybe he was just busy or something..or perhaps he forgot who you were....|`|8PqRN5jKaa	Yeah, HE probably had a bad day.  I am guessing he works out alot so he didn't want to miss his gym routine, but I bet he will have a different attitude next time you see him.<br>  <br>  Are you sure he is single?|`|GRTVGm6Laa	Could be stressed out or in the middle of an intense workout routine.  Could be anything.  Just ask him, "what's up?" and don't make a big deal out of it.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean by "blanked me."  If it means he didn't say anything to you then just ask him what's up.  If by blanked you mean sex, he's probably one of those gym rats that's out to run up the score.|`|gcPyijiGaa	Too much attention can be a turnoff.|`|ml4vCp5qaa	Maybe he just likes to flirt & likes a challenge. But now that he knows you're interested, he lost his interest. He's probably into playing games & trying to see who he can get. And then when he thinks he's got you, he doesn't want you anymore. It sucks, but there are alot of guys out there that are only in it for the challenge. So just play hard to get & don't fish for his attention. Once he notices that you don't care, I'm sure he'll be trying to get your attention again. Good luck:)|`|tMJSJOCqaa	hi,i think that this guy is either married,or in a relationship with someone else,and they were around at the guy or their friends were around.so he couldnt  flirt.so be careful.good luck|`|NSxdVlKcaa	JEMMA, you sound like you have a lot of personal problems to solve before getting involved with some type of relationship with any Guy. You've spoken about several now or ask about them, and still don't know what's up or what to do in your own life, check yourself out first! Jimmy.

It is not everything but it is alot. The guys with average penis have to work a "little harder" .|`|AA11042749	I guess I always have found that the size is not that big of an issue, it is more of how it's used.

I think when you love someone it hurts so much when they hurt you or other people (with an agenda) want to break you up.  Yes, people in love fight---but try to watch your words, and both agree to work on not fighting and getting rid  of the reasons you fight.<br>  <br>  If you have fought with your true love---you know how much it hurts and you want to stop it.   For relationships to be the best, both of you have to not put self  first---you can work out an answer that will be good for both of you.  You dont have to have everything perfect and "your way"---your loved one is worth it.|`|uWhJpNpdaa	i see a relationship arguments a glue than they broke up next sad i like WOOOOOOOOOOW.. true story
Mukir3Pcaa	I was married to a guy who told lies.  He ended up lying  to me through our whole marriage.  He flirted with other women behind my back.  I can't prove he had an affair while we were together.  But after we split up, he had affairs with married women.   I wish someone would have warned me about him when we first started dating.  <br>  <br>  A person lies to you when they don't respect you...... when they think you are too stupid to know any better.  Why would you ever want to stay with someone who would deceive you by telling you lies.  It would never be a mistake to dump someone who can't seem to respect you.  Do yourself a favor and respect yourself.  Trust me.........you'll get over him.  Dump him.|`|2zL5wopeaa	You should tell him how you feel if he does not amitt to it or dosent want to talk about it it probley has a reason. You should break up with him before you get too attached to him that it is soo hard to break up. or u could do what hes doing to u to make him jealous|`|3ORUBCo7aa	What could be a 'big mistake' letting a liar go........trust your and others instincts....they are ususally true.....You'll find another........and become just as attached.......|`|bp2hibPTaa	the game of love is alot like poker. you always have to gamble, always.. <br>  sometimes you realize that the hand you have (your currently boyfriend) isn't going to work out for you, and you gotta lose a bit of chips in order to get out of something, but it's better than losing everything that you know is a loser<br>  it's tough, but you gotta know when to fold, and throw the cards in.|`|xor8Lt16aa	I really have no advice for you, its all about how YOU feel about the situation. You are the one who knows this guy, and who has seen how he acts and who he hangs out with. I suggest listening to the song "Listen To Your Heart" by D.H.T.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|Q2BvzUO5aa	"Do what is best for you,as long as, you hurt no one"-Elvis Presley. Do what is right for you. But don't try to hurt anyone.|`|jhDaRHB4aa	I don't think it would be a big mistake - you've already said he's lied and sees other girls. This guy is clearly not ready or willing to settle down and have just one girlfriend. Unless you are ok with being one of many and ok with dating other people yourself, you should probably let this guy go. If you are not looking for a committed relationship, then that's different. Keep dating this guy - and others!! - until Mr Right shows up. My opinion - a man who lies and still dates around is NOT Mr Right. Good luck.

I dated a guy for 2 years, starting my Freshman year in high school. He was silent and mysterious, and that's what drew me in. When I was 15 going on 16, I had to move to another city.. One that was 9 hours away. Because he and I already had some jealousy issues, we knew it wouldn't work. He dumped me shortly after my move.<br>  <br>  This was 2 years ago in September. We haven't been back together, but occasionally I see him because I moved back into his area. I have kissed him twice, but it always seems I'm in a relationship when he isn't, or vice versa. He was my first love.. And I hear those ones never die..<br>  <br>  Here is another example. His MOTHER feels the same way. The guy she dated for 3 years broke up with her because she turned really mean and nasty with him trying to get him to leave her. She is in her 40s now, Married, with 3 children, and she still thinks back and wonders if she would have been happier married to her first love..<br>  <br>  Situations like that happen a lot, I think.|`|6y1B4op2aa	Well i never went out with her but i use 2 sneak out of my house 2 go visit her and we'd watch TV together and fall asleep on the couch together all sorts of fun stuff together and we were havin a good friendship but then she had 2 move 2 Florida and we became distant since then.I still remember those times and they were fun and i miss them so yea i do miss her and feel that way.|`|AS9resYtaa	everyday of my life!!!!!! only for me it has been, 19 years!!! i've been trying to find him, but it isn't working out for me!! find him, and tell him!!! don't let 19 years of regret go by!!!!|`|MantIzQyaa	yes, it's a pretty common thing, i find that there are songs and other things that bring back memories of the times u shared, even if the song was never played when he/she was with u...  i suggest u listen to the song:          You were my everything- Aviation,         if this song moves u and u still ahve the chance to be with this person, DO IT!|`|rm8ozxRDaa	well i have lost some one that i really cared about that i was with for about 2 and 1/2 years...and i miss him a lot but i don't think i made a miss take because he did something wrong to me and  that's something that i just ant for get and hes something i can never for get but i can always love some one else and life moves on even tho their were faults but if that person for got about you then he or shes not worth it for any reason.|`|dPqhD7ovaa	Sounds like a song sang too many times.  Sometimes it takes not having that person to realize what you really had. Next time you have the chance to love someone (maybe that person) you'll be able to identify  this feeling and show them the love they deserve. No need to dwell or sing should've, could've and would've it only make things worse.  If you know better you'll do better and now you know.

1gBsNJ9Qaa	para empezar, no es bueno que tomes en la noche con tus amigas y andes asi por la calle, se que de adolescentes todos queremos llamar la atencion, pero tenemos que pensar en el modo correcto, o por lo menos no andar con esos shoes en la calle, que pudiste sentir cuando a tu novio le molesto, llego a creer que de ciarta manera acbaba de empezar contigo pero se sintio mal que ni te conocia y tu ya andabas haciando semejantes disparates solo por ser quien no eres, tienes 15, sigue haciendo eso y a los 20 habra tantas cosas que perderas a causa de eso, la confianza de tu novio, nu novio, tu mama se enterara y entenderas que no es bueno, puedes hacerlo con moderacion y mas adulta, pero a esocondidas y solo porque te gusta sentirte borracha no, porque eso es lo que es, la cerveza no te gusta, solo el sentirte fuera de si, diferente, saber lo que es pensar dentro de algo que no comprendes. no te llevara a nada bueno, a niadie le gustaria ver a una nina malcriada haciendo eso, pudiste llegar a peores, pero estas arrepentida, te sientes mal, se que ahora quisieras no haberlo hecho pero como lo remedias, ese dia no fuisten tu misma, no debes cambiar asi aun, no es tu edad, piensalo, si se enojo tu novio fue porque penso en ti, si tu te emborrachaste solo para que se enterara y pensara que ere muy atrevida, no sabes lo que es hacer eso, uno se arrepiente, y al final, no sirve|`|4W1UD3Dmaa	Mira no te estoy juzgando pero creo q estas muy chica todavía.|`|5fe9a2888a662ca3404f3e64b4cd0dc9aa	No te molestes porque soy adulta.

Quizás a tu novio no lo decepcionaste pero sí tal vez le molestó ver a su chica con un poco de alcohol de más.

XLXncQu9aa	Hey i understand how you feel.  I don't really have a close group of friends.  But guess what things won't always stay this way unless you want them to. You have to make an effort.  You say that you don't get out on the weekends.  I used to be just like that, but now even if i go out by myself i enjoy it because its better than wasting away in the house.  Also if you want to make friends be a friend first.  Introduce yourself, be known.  Ask the people you know if they want to hang out.  That's what i've been doing and its alot better than being alone.  Just have faith in God and be friendly and the right ones will come to you.  Also join clubs and get hobbies.|`|rXTsIWDTaa	dont sweat it friends come and go youll be fine time will work things out  youll see
bu6BhCnpaa	ok you have to look at a few different things.  is it worth losing your friend over?  will your friend even be mad?  if your friend is really jsut a friend she shoul dbe happy for you.  be careful since it is touchy, and talk to your friend FIRST.  if she has a lot of problems with it then youhave to decide whether you want to make her happy or yourself happy.
K6Qyw260aa	It is a little strange that a 16-year-old boy would have interest in a girl so young. But the legality of it all depends on the state. And if you're even thinking about having sex, WAIT. You're only thirteen. You have the rest of your life to make important decisions like that. And if you don't listen to that, listen to this. USE PROTECTION. Be safe.
dXXStRxQaa	Hahaha!!!!! I had the same problem!! Well, let's see...I'm shy,I had only seen my crush's mom once, so not sure that'd applied to me; but everything else, yeah. Except for the acting different all around me cuz he's usually pretty calm n never alone, but he looks n makes eye contacts with me a lot n hez in different grade.<br>  <br>  So, Ima have to say more possibility he likes you. Though, I know some guys say popularity don't matter but it really does matter. But who knows, this guy might be different which is great. You guys ever make eye contacts? Like up close. Popular guys usually don't do much nowadays, so I guess you really have to make a go for it. Talk to him n be his friend, then from there, hopefully he'll take it on.<br>  That's all there is to it. Talk, friend, then wait n see.|`|8wgZiCvhaa	suck it up and just ask, all he can say is no|`|AA10388215	Just speak to him and see where it goes. If you have mutual associates, bring them up in a conversation.|`|AA11393814	catch him alone, and let him be comfy without his friends and thereby you guys can talk easily.. popularity doesn't mean a thing if you love someone. Before asking out, be sure (or nearly sure) that he likes you too. If not, wait a little while and make up your mind. If you cannot decide whether he likes you or not, dont insist, just let the things happen the way they should. Love is for 2 ppl, you cannot force someone to love you, good luck, hope it helps..|`|RNlhDRmzaa	well you got to ask him!!! ^_^ dont worry!!<br>  if you are shy then you cant ask him anyways!|`|Tn5j1P0Faa	You sound just like me when i wuz a little girl!!

Confess in an email. It's easier.|`|bc7a0e92b794ebdfa8b9546bc53029a9aa	first of all dont let this "popularity" thing get to you.....if you feel atracted to the guy go for it, if he feels the same way well things will end up good for you......but the worst thing to do in this situation is just sit back and worry about your popularity while the world moves on......and in the end whats the worse that could happen? perhaps he saying no?<br>  <br>  in plain terms.....go for it|`|dE1Mr0xKaa	just smile next time he looks at you to let him know you're interested, he'll catch on (eventually).  we guys can be pretty thick sometimes...|`|en7RLtMaaa	Do you play any sports?

Le diagnostic de paludisme à P. falciparum état établi par la présence d'une symptomatologie fébrile et la positivité d'un frottis sanguin et/ou d'une goutte épaisse. Le paludisme était supposé acquis lors d'un voyage dans l'archipel des Comores ou à Madagascar dans les six mois précédents. Les accès graves nécessitant l'emploi de la quinine injectable étaient exclus.<br>  <br>   <br>  Résutats. <br>  <br>  Quarante-neuf enfants ont été recrutés : 29 ont é#x000E9; traités par halofantrine et 20 par méfloquine. Les deux groupes étaient commparables, sauf en ce qui concernait le délai moyen entre le début des signes et le diagnostic, plus court dans le groupe méfloquine. Tous les enfants ont été guéris initialement. Le délai d'apyrexie et la durée d'hospitalisation étaient comparables quel que soit le traitement. Les enfants traités par halofantrine présentaient plus souvent une augmentation de l'espace QTc de leur électrocardiogramme, sans que cela n'ait eu de répercussion clinique (56 versus 0%). à l'inverse, les enfants traités par méfloquine vomissaient plus souvent (45 versus 0 %), ce qui a conduit à l'emploi de la quinine injectable chez 10% d'entre eux. Les rechutes paraissaient plus fréquentes dans le groupe halofantrine (14 versus 0%, non significatif).<br>  <br>   <br>  Discussion. <br>  <br>  Halofantrine et méfloquine semblent avoir, dans notre série, une efficacité initiale comparable. Des effets adverses apparaissent avec les deux molécules. Des changements dans les modalités d'administration de la méfloquine peuvent probablement améliorer la tolérance du produit. Les rechutes semblent plus fréquentes avec l'halofantrine lorsqu'elle est administrée en cure unique, mais les modalités d'une deuxième cure ne sont pas définies.<br>  <br>   <br>   Abstract <br>  <br>   <br>  Aim of the study. <br>  <br>  To evaluate mefloquine versus halofantrine in children suffering from acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria.<br>  <br>   <br>  Material and methods. <br>  <br>  Prospective non randomized study in hospitalized children during one year. Acute falciparum malaria was defined by fever and a positive thin and/or thick smear. Malaria was presumed to have been contracted in Comoros archipelago and/or Madagascar 6 months previously. Patients were excluded, when quinine had to be used, according to World Health Organization's severity criteria.<br>  <br>   <br>  Results. <br>  <br>  Forty-nine children were included: 29 were treated with halofantrine and 20 with mefloquine. Patients features in the two groups of treatment were identical, with exception for the mean time between first clinical signs and diagnosis (shorter in mefloquine group). Fever's and hospitalization's duration under treatment were similar. An increase in QTc interval was frequently observed in patients treated with halofantrine (56 versus 0%), although patients with mefloquine experienced vomiting (45 versus 0%). Relapses seemed to be more frequent with halofantrine (14 versus 0%).<br>  <br>   <br>  Discussion. <br>  <br>  Halofantrine and mefloquine are efficient for falciparum malaria treatment in our pediatric series, despite a high rate of adverse events.

Sono emozioni che stordiscono e che rientrano nel “mal d’amore” che può essere diagnosticato come un vero disturbo mentale che nessun medico o psicologo vuole prendere in considerazione.<br>  Ma cos’è che ci fa innamorare? E soprattutto, che differenza c’è tra innamoramento, amore e Amore? La gelosia ossessiva è davvero una manifestazione d’amore?<br>  Proviamo a fare un po’ di chiarezza per capire meglio cosa ci accade quando ci innamoriamo.<br>   Facciamoci caso: noi ci innamoriamo sempre (o proviamo attrazione per) delle persone che in genere hanno qualcosa che noi vorremmo avere e non abbiamo. Ad esempio una ragazza che sa di essere fragile tenderà ad innamorarsi di un uomo molto forte, una donna che non ha potuto realizzare il suo sogno tenderà ad innamorarsi di chi quel sogno lo ha concretizzato, una ragazza molto ansiosa si innamorerà di una persona calma e così via. E’ bene capire una cosa importante: le attrazioni sono inconsce. E’ vero che noi abbiamo un prototipo di partner ideale ma poi nella realtà ci innamoriamo anche di chi in quei canoni non ci rientra affatto. Ebbene, il terzo specchio esseno ci dice proprio che ciò che ci spinge a provare attrazione per determinate persone è proprio il fatto che la nostra anima riconosce in quella persona qualcosa che noi non abbiamo… più! In un certo senso l’innamoramento è una sorta di furto, l’innamorato è come un ladro inconscio, è qualcuno che tramite l’innamoramento sta cercando di scoprire qualcosa di sé, di ritrovarla, di riappropriarsene. Ciò che ci attrae è l’energia che emana quella persona. Queste caratteristiche di cui noi ci dovremmo riappropriare non è detto che siano le caratteristiche che più apprezziamo nell’altro, anzi talvolta possono essere le caratteristiche che più ci infastidiscono, soprattutto nel caso delle relazioni karmiche, cioè derivanti da vite precedenti.|`|yaKZNII8aa	....guardalo negli occhi.... se il tuo cuore comincia ad accellerare .... se ti si spezza il respiro nel petto....allora è quasi amore!|`|72paA0Ysaa	bè ti hanno già risposto altri.<br>  A me vengono le farfalle allo stomaco,il cuore batte + forte,e vivo solo x i pochi istanti con lui,o nell'attesa di un sms.<br>  E se poi è passato il periodo dei "sintomi" è la persona  a cui rivolgi di + il tuo pensiero nel quotidiano,quella con cui vorresti dividere tutto,quella con cui litighi e poi subito fai pace.<br>  Ma innamorarsi vuol dire anche abbassare la guardia e mettere il cuore nelle mani di un altro sperando nn ti faccia soffrire.<br>  ciao|`|vchRCwLbaa	ti piace tutto di quella persona! ti emoziona sentirla,vederla e la pensi di continuoooo!!!! per me è cosi purtroppo!
Dsf8Z9sWaa	Quello che non c'è, è un'illusione della mente. Anche la persona che ami, se in questo momento non è con te, è un'illusione della tua mente. Anche la sofferenza è un'illusione. Bisognerebbe cambiare la propria mente, cioè portare la propria mente verso altri pensieri. Ma non è semplice. C'è chi ci riesce più o meno facilmente, e chi proprio non ce la fa. E il pensiero ossessivo lo porta a fare cose tremende. <br>  L'unico consiglio che ti do, quando ti viene quel pensiero, e se la storia è abbastanza lontana nel tempo, occupa la tua mente con un interesse, un hobby. E guarda la tua sofferenza come una nuvola che oscura il sole per un periodo limitato, e poi se ne va.|`|5160c620a80ec37130cb0892757b743aaa	la sofferenza è reale, anche io penso alla mia storia finita e soffro tanto, certo poi la sofferenza passa ci si fa l'abitudine|`|QPKe9SN2aa	l'amore è gioie e dolori. quando mi ha lasciato il mio ex sono stata tre anni a piangere e dico tre. adesso lui ha un figlio e vidico che quando capita di vederlo ancorfa ho le lacrime agli occhi per quanto mi ha fatto soffrire..<br>  passerà. bacioni|`|i64VCwoFaa	xkè ora hai nostalgia dei sentimenti ke sei riuscito a provare in passato e ti senti svuotato dentro e demotivato xkè comunque è bello amare e ci appagano anke i tormenti le paure e tutte le sensazioni ke spesso accompagnano questo sentimento.|`|2fcf424f10914e8eaa08654b0d09035daa	xkè far parte della natura umana...cercare di farsi male!|`|40bae8cc3f46c031da40c60273be4bf3aa	piu che una sofferenza da il pensiero di qualcosa come mancanza, devi vedere cosa ti manca, , ,   uno soffre si per la mancanza di una detterminata cosa  ma solo perche pensa che quello è il limite, il limite di qualcosa che non puo avere, allora devi dimostrare l'incontrario , devi riuscire ad ottenere quella cosa e se non ci riesci almeno sarai certo che ti sei impegnato per averla.|`|JYfDRjKNaa	penso che è normale, anche io alle volte penso ad una storia durata un bel po' che ora è finita...il dolore con il tempo diminuisce, ma in certe situazioni la fitta al cuore è ancora profonda, magari ascoltando una canzone, o andando in un luogo...ma tutto passa, tutto finisce, e tutto ricomincia.

uhP228Dpaa	Its all about the thrill of the chase. Most people try and aim for someone they think they can't have. Sounding desperate makes it seem all too easy, and takes the fun out of 'chasing' after someone. Also, being desperate somehow makes people seem less attractive. You always have to act in high demand. Desperate people are desperate because theyr not getting any... this makes you wonder why.. etc etc. Also, a girl knowing that you are desperate makes her think 'does he like me for me, or would he just take any girl who happened to be in his way?' I say, just relax and play it cool... and you will find a relationship will just spring itself upon you|`|0838ddb7cfe7e6eb28ac124b99896872aa	If you're waiting for a girl who is desperate, it sounds to me like maybe you're lazy. Like you'd rather not work for it or take a risk.<br>  <br>  Despiration is not a good thing. How could you think it is? To show you what I mean, I've copied the definition of Desperate:<br>  <br>     1. Having lost all hope<br>     2. Marked by, arising from, or showing despair<br>     3. Reckless or violent because of despair<br>     4. Undertaken out of extreme urgency or as a last resort<br>     5. Nearly hopeless; critical<br>     6. Suffering or driven by great need or distress<br>  <br>  Does any of that sound OK to you??<br>  <br>  In reading this, you should now be able to see why nobody likes anyone to be desperate. Especially for a girlfriend. Plus, men and women alike do not like it when the opposite sex is too eager. Makes us feel awkward as heck.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	When you're desperate a person isn't in their best light and they are motivated by desperation.

If you come across as desperate or needy, you are perceived as weak.<br>  <br>  This isn't always the case as sometimes it's merely perceptual, but unfortunately... perception rules in the dating game.<br>  <br>  Also, many women like men who are a "challenge".  They want the man who is unavailable or who doesn't need her.  Don't ask me why... they're just messed up that way since 99.9% of those end up with the girl's heart broken because they couldn't "change" him.<br>  <br>  Try a completely different approach.  They say that insanity is doing the same thing, the same way and expecting different results.  Try something different.|`|gXsFSMW3aa	One of the things I've never understood is that we are expected to act uninterested - as if dating is an annoyance we can't, really, be bothered with.<br>  <br>  Well, there are LOTS of single people sitting home on the weekends because they are so very good at pretending to be disinterested.<br>  <br>  I let someone know when I'm interested in them.  It doesn't mean that I want an instant relationship - I just want to know more about them, that's all.  It's what dating is FOR in the first place.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to others - keep on doing what you do.|`|AA11755292	ppl dont like it if ppl want something that they just cant get immeadiatly ie. a girlfriend. but there is nothing wrong with it tho bcuz every1 is ike that|`|h9TnOiFPaa	girls and just people in general don't like people sounding like they are hounding after just one thing, being 'desperate' about it. <br>  it makes it sound like you are whining on and on about something, or just can't let the subject of getting a gf go.<br>  it just annoys people. conversation gets old, friendships get meaningless....frustration creeps in...<br>  hope i helped
AA11151794	The worse thing he could do to you is to cause you to lose control of your own emotions and allow him to affect your own self-esteem.  You must love yourself more than you are worried about the results of his behavior toward you at any time you are with him or "without him".  Face the facts that if he does not return the same interest you have shown toward him, it will be his loss and you will live on to meet others who  will appreciate you.  Do your best on that project.  Stop worrying.  Everyone, including him (whom you have idealized too much) makes mistakes.  He has equal responsibility to make his project work.  Think of tomorrow as just another day and nothing really special because of him.  Stop worrying about him and what he thinks until he begins to treat you with warmth and true friendship.|`|FTpy9M8raa	his loss  just dont bring it up  and act as if nothing happened  unless he is nicer than normal. you might have shocked him at first either way you'll live|`|IvoaNyN2aa	get a ring and say you are back with your old boyfriend...have someone call you on a cell phone  and say that ....<br>  <br>  pretend to be so happy things are finally going great for you now that you are back together|`|cbOzOUQ2aa	He can't do anything to you that you don't let him. He reacted coldly? Big deal. Don't let it get to you. If he deliberately tries to embarrass you then he's a jerk and you should be glad that you don't have to waste your time being involved with a guy like that.
96qPcg1Taa	This is the key. No man ever won a woman by telling her he loved her. This is something to say later, when you are sharing a moment by a fire, in a car, on the couch--anywhere but when the guys are around her. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound harsh, but she will not be impressed by that, mainly because there is a sense of deperation about it. <br>  <br>  Make her want you. How do you do that? It's strange. <br>  <br>  People want things they can't have. Drop a compliment by her locker and then walk away. Remember this, my friend: you cannot smell, even a little bit, of availability. This is hard, because you like her. I understand. <br>  <br>  Here's another strategy: Cultivate relationships with women older than her. (Not your cousins.) They will tell you what to do, and, if people mistake them for your girlfriends, so much the better. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, man. Good luck!|`|41S2Hottaa	Something like this: walk up to her, ask her if you can talk to her, tell her that you love her and want to start a relationship. It's never too late. Be a man and tell her how you feel.|`|6MnhPuwJaa	Question:  who doesn't love being told they are loved?<br>  Answer:  no one!<br>  <br>  She'll be flattered whatever the outcome and will always remember you fondly even if the feeling isn't returned the same way.<br>  <br>  Do you want to be unforgettable?  Tell her you love her.<br>  <br>  I promise you that she'll think twice even if she hasn't viewed you that way before.  What do you have to lose?<br>  <br>  Get moving!  Do it in an environment you are most comfortable in.   You could try other expressions first to see how that goes over... like "wow, you're the best" or "I just adore you!"  If the response is good, you are probably good to go.<br>  <br>  "Just follow your heart, that's what I do..." - Napoleon Dynamite.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	well um maybe you should start from the beginning ...do you go out yet??? maybe it is a huge crush...do you know her friends or family...you can talk to them first|`|993bfc873c045bd21b7faac58deec843aa	Ahhh, that is so cute. How old are you . you sound pretty young, especially if you are worried about boys being around her. If you really love her, tell her. Ask her out. Do something special for her. Find out by paying attention to her body language and how she looks and talks to you,how she feels about you and then if you feel comfortable enough let her know.

But there so many way's of telling her how much you love her without being told. <br>  1. Text and tell her you admire her. If you don't have a cellphone 2. Write her a letter put it in her bag or enclosed it in her books/notebook, tell her what you feel for her, how much you adore and love her, all the feelings you have inside just let it out. (like what u've said b4 it's too late.)  3. But if you're really ready and have a guts to tell her,ask her for a date and tell her that you like/love her.  *But for me, the best thing you can do is: Befriend with her first. Getting to know each other before anything else; through this you can adjust and adapt what she really like with a guy. Because, it really hurt, when you're dump with the girl you really LOVE.|`|wrCVBAEYaa	Show her instead.  Don't just walk up to her and kiss her though, be subtle at first but get her attention.

41Jp5X3Daa	Some guys like it. But you have to be sure that the guy still knows that you're interested in him...that's what will keep him trying for you. The hard to get game can be sexy, but don't go so far that it seems like rejection or that you're ignoring him, because sometimes that can hurt a guy. And make sure you eventually give in. For a guy, its a great feeling to finally get the girl...its like Christmas...a lot of times you know what you're getting already, but it still feels great once its in your arms!|`|32d6fc927a7fef28c904d136beee1614aa	Yes, to a certain extent.

First of all are you sure you want to marry this man?  Just as his parents are looking for other brides perhaps you should look into your options for someone else that you can communicate better with.  If you can't see a guy before you marry him, you should at least be able to have a good conversation.  Secondly, if you want to (or have to) go for this guy, maybe you should just ask him straight, what does he feel for you, and  if he's really interested.  Ask him what he's looking for in a bride and explain what you are looking for in a groom.  Honesty is always the best policy, especially for starting a marriage.

7a5f428982fc6c711546c73a64461a69aa	Don't fall into the "lust trap!" Really evaluate both guys as far as long-term relationships go. You said the first one is sweet and the other is awesome in bed... so you really have to put lust aside, or else you'll find yourself quite unhappy in the long run once that lust goes away (which it does, over time). However, if the guy you slept with is a good guy, stable and is also sweet, you may have a good relationship waiting to happen! There's nothing better than a good relationship in all aspects (including sex).|`|trERH3oBaa	sleep with thr sweet guy<br>  then decide<br>  why do you have to decide<br>  don't people date anymore<br>  sex doesn't mean you're married
lHmQO5ryaa	Well, Ashley, i know what it feel likes when you seem to give more input into the relationship than your other. It sounds like this guy has a lot of growing up to do. Having fights with each other is inevitable and normal for a couple, but he should definitely start spending more time with you. Now, these type of guys are very immature; they would rather spend their time screwing around with their drinking (in this case: drug) buddies than be try to work things out, which is normal for us dumb guys :) , however i hope that he is not involved in illegal and unhealthy activites. You are doing a very terrific job by not doing drugs and going to college and you seem like a highly intelligible person. These guys can be very sweet (i.e. giving you flowers and making sincere apologies), but you should not be that tolerant of his actions if it is as frequent as you have said. I do not mean that you should "go your separate ways" (if only it were that simple), instead spend some time apart until he can do some more growing up, straighten out his life, and goes to college. Try to confront him about this and tell him what is aggravating you or you could also go to a relationship counselor for even more help. If both of you try to improve your relationship i am sure things will turn out to be much better than they are now. Gud Luck!|`|trERH3oBaa	you have gone your separate ways<br>  say good bye<br>  go meet a good guy with an education and future<br>  imagine yourself married to this loser and your kids wondering where their father is<br>  move on

blW8lTG9aa	Love is in the air!!!  Hard question to give advice on.  You really need to get some time with her and talk with her about it.  If you could get a good idea of what she wants, you will be better off!!!  Either she wants to be with you and she leaves the other guy, or you hurt for a while and find some one else. <br>  I say, time is short!|`|9synxg94aa	i think you should play it cool for a little while and then<br>  wait untill she realizes how much you mean to her<br>  and then break it to her that you want to get back together, regardless if she's goin out w/that guy or not|`|P3TonrHgaa	just go on a casual fun date. good luck!  :)

He may have a life. <br>  <br>  Don't call him but be there emotionally when he calls you. Be enthused to talk to him but don't grovel.<br>  <br>  He has friends. Don't be his friend, be his lover. When the time is right.|`|466xplBRaa	how about inviting him to your place for dinner... good food good conversation|`|Fj7PdCpraa	Might try calling him. He called you he might be waiting to see if you're interested enough to put forth an effort, no bashing intended. Some guys kind of give up if they don't get much of a response.|`|t1GKGQYFaa	Come on, some times guys are forgetful...just send or text him a simple hi...and if he doesnt respond...well hes a jack ***...and if he does...well just try and say you would like to hang out more...and there you go...:)
AA10788645	If you like him, go for it. If not, move on, don't lie to him and yourself by flirting. Sending the wrong messages can be REALLY bad.

If you break up with him to get his friend, he would be totally crushed inside, even if he doesn't show it. He would show you a smiling face when he sees you, but maybe at night he would be sitting inbed, drinking beer to soothe the pain. Plus, you'll spoil their long friendship.|`|DJKTzEKuaa	it's not right to play games with him so I think you should break up with him or stay with him just don't cheat on him <br>  before you break up with this guy you should ask the other guy if he like you then if you know that for sure it won't be so hard to do sumthin about it
a74343e7ca8aa5c50c845ba22afe0528aa	I don't think you can say men or women have a harder time, it depends on the person and the reason for the break-up.|`|AA11594273	Woman no doubt can be more emotional, but I think what it really boils down to is who broke up first.  If the man does, then the woman will be more emotional or if the woman does then the man will be.  Someone always will be unless it is a mutual feeling that both want out of the relationship.|`|AA11299834	The one that didn't want to break up!|`|0C3IaeDaaa	I want to say women, but studies show that because men like to "put away" their feelings, in the long run it affects them the longest. like months or years later, he is still grieving. whereas women grieve at the spot and usually have a friend/family base to vent to, thereby insuring that they get over it pretty quickly. guys rarely talk about relationship problems with their boys. but they do make themselves heard they are still hurt when they are drunk lol|`|88659fb68a525a5b01a64e02c0248d60aa	i think women take it harder|`|AA11604567	It all depends on the person.  Some woman are really emotional, some men are.  Some woman are not emotional, some men are not either.  So it really depends.  It also depends on how the person felt about the other person.  Lets say there is a man and a woman who broke up and the man was much more in love then the woman was, the man is going to have a harder time than the woman and vice versa.<br>  <br>  If a man wanted to cry he could do it alone, and there is nothing wrong with a man with emotions.  Hiding them is more unnatural then not.|`|f749d2cce22aad6eb2d7f1c842fa5678aa	well i think it depends on what happend to make them break up. sometimes it's the guys who get really hurt and sometimes it's the girls. it all depends|`|2ImfKIGsaa	i think men snap with heartbreak and women cry till there is no tommorow it depends on the person though not the sex men tend to do stupid things though really women kinda hide themselves and stay ou of the dating world men fight cuss and so on put as i said before it depends on the person|`|54660de70991857a4d553a722887d44caa	it takes women longer but guys mainly the big macho dudes that are controlling get real violent some time they can't stand to get dumped.|`|690f7ffc29ce2d593b3a5c6235f97637aa	onestly an this is nuthing aginst the guys but i think girls teke it much harder, when guys break up there just like "what ever" an if it does bug them they sure dont show it, unless they were really in love. i guess it just all depends, but i say girls are, girls are way more emotional then guys...|`|AA10437709	Men. Women can openly get their emotions out in the open and feel ok about it. A man has to put up a front and carry himself as if it doesn't hurt. And he cries alone in the dark while watch reruns of All About Us. It's hard to hold emotions in as females know. Now that male has to hold it in to save face and it will eat him up unless he can find a way to release it like sports or something else.|`|AA11238328	Could be either really........whoever didn't see it coming and didn't want it either. No generalisations based on mere sex........|`|jdtSJaEwaa	Honestly, there is no right answer to that question.<br>  <br>  I can say that women are no more emotional than men.  Women in our society, however, are encouraged to be emotional, whereas men are expected to be more reserved and in control.  A lot of guys have issues with breakups, deaths of loved ones, etc. Because they just plain do not know how to grieve properly.  But that doesn't mean they have it any worse than a woman would.<br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, it's entirely dependant on the circumstance of the breakup and how deep the feelings were; the sex of the person who's hurt doesn't make much difference.|`|trERH3oBaa	both the same<br>  men do cry<br>  just not in public|`|FBs02AT6aa	From my experience I say the women...Women tend to get sentimental over material things, special occasions that were shared with the ex..songs, outings, routines etc...Men too but the Women has a hell of a time moving on..eventually we do..with every pain that has been inflicted on her...it makes us stronger to move on...|`|ZtqRAoikaa	There is no rule of thumb in this arena.  If the person in control, meaning the one that opts out does this, he or she doesn't have the depth of feelings for their partner so therefore they will be virtually unaffected emotionally.  Perhaps they may miss the person's presence or some aspects but remember people generally only do things to benefit themselves and leave a relationship for another interest.

I wouldnt suggest making any decisions (like asking her out or asking her if she likes you) just yet. <br>  See how she acts towards you over the next few days and then if your like k shes acting like she for sure likes me, and your thinking you may like her too, flirt with her! make eye contact, touch her, but not weird touches, just slightly to show you care. <br>  If your still like i dont know if she likes me as a friend or more than a friend. Maybe try asking a friend who you can trust if they know anything about the situation.<br>  At the moment, dont get too attached to her though, because you may find out she just likes you as a friend then be hurt<br>  just play it cool for noww!!|`|sT8ujqxBaa	Hello, <br>  LOL u r such a nerd but i bet she likes you most girls do that when they like boys|`|zzYj2OWoaa	yeah she likes you.. just casually talk to her and find out if she wants to do something or go somewhere if she does then she deff likes you. hope everything works out.

0OejDrkEaa	how u now if a guy likes u!!!!<br>  1. He stares at you a lot.<br>  2. He hits you a lot. (just play hitting)<br>  3. He uses the first thing that pops into his head to start a conversation with you<br>  4. He yelled, "Hi!" to your mom that day she picked you up from school.<br>  5. He tries to make you laugh anyway even if he gets hurt in the process<br>  6. His voice gets softer ("Hey, you") when ever you two talk.<br>  7. You were invited by him to a group outing.<br>  8. He called you to talk about nothing at all.<br>  9. He imitates your laugh (OK, you do snort sometimes) which makes you laugh even harder.<br>  10. He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  11. He sometimes stares straight into your eyes.<br>  12. He uses every possible way to touch you (your hair, face, arms, back, etc.)<br>  13. He says hi to you every time he sees you in the halls or around town.<br>  14. He tries his hardest to make you mad or annoyed. Just to be funny)<br>  <br>  <br>  There r way to many signs to just have one clear one because people show how they feel in many diff ways...<br>  <br>  ~For a guy~!<br>  <br>  ***How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then BOOM, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.|`|d953cd07e67e5fef2a8e2594c5b04d76aa	From the looks of it, he might just want to be friends.  Sorry, hun.  Guys usually try something more risky or they do nothing at all if they like you.  But he might, so keep posted about other stuff he does, ok?

That's a hard one for guys. I've been told frequently that I'm a good looking guy, but I STILL get intimidated to ask a girl out because she's so good looking! It's mainly fear of rejection - the better looking she is, the worse it hurts.|`|B48sBOZSaa	yea ...<br>  <(0.0)>|`|CBbsulYCaa	So thats why I,m battling to get a date!!!|`|ccaef45e51e4a7a192b0995df8588af3aa	send me your address sweety, I'll ask you out!<br>  Yes in answer to your question, guys do feel intimidated by very beautiful girls for two different reasons.The first being that they are afraid of being turned down by such a girl which is a real bummer on the ego and the second reason, a lot of guys will think she is too easy and is the type that has bedded a lot of guys. You are in a place between a rock and a hard spot. try wearing less make up, tone down your beauty and see if that helps! My bet is that it will.
qdQAQxg0aa	Yeah, a lot of times a grl is mean if she likes you, If she's the shy type, or if she was hurt by her last boyfriend she might be a little scared of rejection. So she'll get defensive and be mean.<br>  And if she goes silent then she was probably talking about you lol<br>  With this kind of girl, just try to be her friend for a while before you try getting too flirty :P|`|AA10980243	ti really depends on the age tooo <br>  <br>  umm<br>  <br>  see what she does but you act liek you don't care what she does|`|Qdgg4vKIaa	I'm a girl so I know what's going on.  Some girls actually act that way because it's how they are. Others, it means they really do like you. You should become friends with her friends. After you get to know them, ask to hang out with them someday. Sooner or later, that one girl will have to talk to you. Once she does, maybe you can tell by the way she acts that she likes you. Maybe even ask her out. If she says no, then she may not be the one for you.|`|X20NJFMgaa	they sit outside your home every day waiting for you to come home|`|gXsFSMW3aa	It depends on the age.  If you are six, you smack someone over the head and that's love.  If you're sixty, you offer to lend her your hot water bottle.<br>  <br>  If she's trying to draw attention to herself, chances are she likes you.|`|knrOxjI7aa	yeah maybe, do u know that 90% of your actions tells that u like someone or not. She will try to impress u by time.<br>  <br>  So tell u what, give it more time. Then u will be able to find the solution urself.
bGiRObHLaa	Not all strippers have sex for money.Keep that in mind.But many of them will.I definitely wouldn't recommend doing that in the club.It's illegal and using the club is more risky..IF in fact she is interested, maybe the two of you should set up a time and day..|`|nQhDrfblaa	Is it possible to pay a stripper for sex?  Yes<br>  Is it legal?  No.<br>  Do I know if this particular young lady is willing to accept money in exchange for sex?  Sorry, I don't read minds.|`|8c2fb0d8953a7861681a9af3396c0ff2aa	Dude, trust me; you do not need to pay a stripper to have sex. I don't know how old you are or how you look, but trust me; womens' standards in men have sunk to an all time low! My cousin's friends have boyfriends who smell so bad, I can't get near them without getting sick! Everyday at work I see young hot women come in with guys who look horrible and wear filthy clothes with visible stains! All you need is some confidence and remember to not pay them for anything, make them earn what you give them.|`|9LzF5unZaa	yeah dude i do it all the time. bow chicka wah wah. slip her 150 dude. thats plenty. make sure that you know for sure that the strip club does that. some do, some don't. i got a chubby just talking about it.|`|PHYFK7qEaa	Its totally possible. I wouldnt reccomend asking he right there in the club. Just ask her if she does "house calls".  I would suggest finding a woman that will do it for free though.|`|a0d3b84c1054d638e4c57622e8822412aa	it's possible, but that's called a hooker and it's illegal!
LjOEEMEoaa	I would have to say my husband and my girl T.B. She is a truly special person. I've never met anyone like her. I don't think that there is a single person that does not like her. She has been a blessing to me since the day I met her.It is true friendship when you can tell a person anything and not be judged! My husband is great also.We are truly soul mates.We have been together since I was 15.Life has been a challenge for us but I think we can weather any storm brought our way! We have so far.|`|7bwef9Ttaa	me!!|`|AA11346042	my best friend and i have known each other since we were 6 years old... so 20 years!  she is my exact opposite, truth be told, and other than growing up in the same town, we really don't have a whole lot in common.  <br>  <br>  her parents divorced when we were 7, mine have been together 30 years.  she has a very small family, and i have a huge one.  <br>  <br>  she's like my sister, honestly.  we balance each other out in every single way.  she tempers my extremes, and i hers.  i feel so lucky to have found someone who brings so much to my life...|`|BawjOB3maa	I have two.

BAs0W76Maa	I would rather be with someone that I connect with (chemistry/love/magic) for a short while.  It would be more lonely to spend a lifetime with someone you are not passionate about than to spend half of your life alone.|`|1a0faed9931d7a416e0f7dd504c3be4daa	Someone I didnt have a strong connection to for the rest of my life, because the rest of my life , may be quit long time.|`|ax8DiHkraa	The first! Life is about passion.... even if it's short lived. So be it! Better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all!|`|gTamcW1saa	The first one mentioned.What's the point of spending time with someone whom you don't even like?After living with he or she for a long time,i believe quarrels will start.Because the relationship isn't strong enough.If you think he or she is good for you,go ahead.If not.tell him or her sraight away about how you feel about them to prevent them from getting hurt. Connections don't count.Your feelings about him/her counts!P.S: tresure the time you have with your greatest love.Might not neccessary be alone next time.If you meet better ones ,go ahead.I'm sure the one whom you loved wants you to be leading a blessed live too.Right?|`|dd76553eebe2c0f33e3695a332f47db4aa	i rather be alone...<br>  the pain of losing someone i love is too great to handle, especially when i know that i don't have much time left to love him...|`|397ed2c85a1de41da6d669be8e0abd8eaa	Be with the love of my life for a short amount of time...That time would be worth it to me.
542c6d83012d6659c943443caf85e2b6aa	im the same!<br>  i feel like they are too immature for me if they say those wordsss. or something,<br>  but i too do that!|`|oaF8tYCVaa	That's funny, im like almost the exact same way.<br>  <br>  It's just us women tend to take ourselves more seriously and its kind of immature when guys talk like that. I lose interest in a guy really fast too.|`|50yKK90Haa	im the same. if a guy says a stupid word or an offensive joke even though i know he is joking i stop liking him.|`|SrUwUrE1aa	well, i have never had this problem myself, though there are words that i don't like to say/hear. if hearing a word turns you off of a guy, maybe you didn't like him that much to begin with and are using his choice of words as an excuse to stop liking him. problematic? yes.|`|VfHa4oqTaa	well not all of us women r like this... I'm sure Evey one gets a little pissed off sum tyme and unfortunately i DO the same thing I also hate immature guys, but my problem is ill get really aggravated soooo quick|`|bOog8wOSaa	i used to be like that. youre just turned off by his immature behavior, i dont blame you. i dont think youre weird at all, but i do think it wont bother you as much as you get older.|`|s1PVciSFaa	yes and im not immature and im only a 14 year old boy

dQKrrdyuaa	find a new girl|`|fWGS8T5yaa	You know what, I was in a same situation like you. <br>  Anyways, Try the following site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://how-to-approach-girls.blogspot.co..." rel="nofollow">http://how-to-approach-girls.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <br>  I think, it can really help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck
mXyDuyPgaa	Well, She may, and may not.<br>  It could be, it sounds like she likes you, I'd do something like that if I'd like a guy, but not. .anyways. .  they way she's acting, she likes you, or at least wants you to think she does. . <br>  The only way to truely know, is to ask her. <br>  If you like her, than express your feelings to her, and see if she does the same, in return.|`|dQKrrdyuaa	honestly it seems as if she likes you. try telling her in a like hidden kinda way that you like her (if that makes sence), and see how she takes it. but if she came back then theres something going on.
0502f99266db2b733545ca1f8f7b6571aa	i know exactly what you're talking about! i think it's cuz they like, want to talk, but they're not creative enough to come up with anything to say. and so therefore, when they don't know how to respond to something, they just say "lol" "haha" or put a stupid smiley face that i want to punch. that sounded mean, sorry. but still, it's cuz guys lack in creating a good conversation. they just like making things simple and quick. i'd just treat him the same way. and then he'll get concerned and try to save the conversation by asking you something or by sending you a song. seriously, treat the guys the same way they IM you. i know what you mean completely. us girls are just WAY better at talking than they are. it's ok tho. we love em anyways.|`|dQKrrdyuaa	i do it when theres other things on my mind, or when im not intrested... but im not a guy.|`|02b71825c3be4490792ac3940709d737aa	idk most guys let there little heads do the talks and your now that the thought prosses takes i while to get there little head . and than they have to think if it will help them get in to your pants|`|QDHDift5aa	We are bored of talking to you..<br>  <br>  and/ or too busy doing something else|`|S3GYvmppaa	simplicity is the key, if its not worth the effort, most guys wont do it. we dont try to make things boring, its just that sometimes theres not much to say or the conversation isnt really all that interesting, im not sayin make it completely testosterone fuled but talkin bout nothing but chick stuff gets boring to us too.|`|thnIIORMaa	because they have nothing else to say and most of the time when i talk to a guy they are distracted
dfh5XamRaa	I would go with your heart. My husband and I don't agree on every little thing but the important thing is you are both Christians. We had only known each other four months when we got engaged, but when you know someone is right, it does not matter. I was 21 when I got married. If you are mature you will be fine. I don't think God would have put you with such a good ,Christian man (with the same goals too!) if he did not think you ought to be together. Do you realize how hard it is to find a person like that? Go for it!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You're way too young. No reason to rush anyting. Plus, with the stresses of being in the military, it's not the time.|`|jdpBGzU3aa	You dont want to rush into anything but that is exactly what you will be doing if you make this decision now.   You are young so what's the rush take your time for a lifetime.|`|JRV8gHbkaa	women alway are ready for marriage but men get suckered into it.|`|a37dc179b9a04772f24bb7711a8e0702aa	Hey, I think like this. If you have to ask a network of people you do not know and will probably never meet, then I say your not ready right now. This is not to say that this isn't the man for you, and not to say that one day you two will not get married. When you are ready to get married to either this man or any man for that matter. You will know, and you will not even have to ask anyone. When you are ready to get married you will not be concerned about the opinion of others.|`|da7d48b27c23a35946688a30e844546faa	You are the only one who can answer that question. You will not be in the military forever. You might want to see how he is in civilian life before you commit to a lifetime relationship.|`|0GVJZvn4aa	go back for itn before it is too late|`|AxwB2LKGaa	Only you know the answer to the question. But here are some questions that will may help you see more clear the answer:<br>  <br>  -> Do you see yourself growing old with him?<br>  -> If your beliefs were different, would you still be with him? what if they change, would you leave him for that?<br>  -> If you were given the choice between a million dollars or living with him for he rest of your life, what would you choose?<br>  -> Would you be happy if he was the only family you had left in the world?<br>  <br>  Those are just some questions. But something else: you two are very young. There are still many things for you to do before settling down. And maybe being separated is not a good enough reason for getting married. If you are really meant for each other you'll be able to stay together even if that happens.|`|b535fd85536b37c1d3e0e176efadb45caa	I have been married for 4yrs now to a wonderful soldier. I was 15 when we dated and 18 when we married. I did the overseas tour in South Korea and I suggest you get married over there and then when you both get home, do the big wedding for family and friends. If you don't get married over there, he will be stationed somewhere else and you are stuck there by yourself, and going mad thinking about what he is doing half a world away while you are there.  If you do get married, there is a good chance he can tack on a couple of years to match your tour there or you can find someone to "swap" with you at the base he will be at. Not to mention the BAH benifits and Marriage benifits on your LES statements. If you are really into this guy, friends and family can wait because the man you choose to be your husband is now and forever will be your family.|`|z2r1lW9saa	It sounds like you are pressured into making a quick decision based upon your tours.  You need to use your head because this is a life-long committment, not to be taken lightly.  If your head is scared, maybe that's because you are feeling that you might be a little too young and this is a little too soon.  It won't hurt you to stay overseas for a little while (it doesn't have to be 3 years).  It also won't hurt you to go back to the states for a little while either and continue to just date him.  But, I wouldn't jump into marriage at this point.

TyD2W3Jmaa	You could if you wanted to. I'm old-fashioned and I prefer the guy to make the first move though. You may just want to hint to him that you're ready to take your relationship to the next step, and see if he'll take the plunge first.

Sounds like she's a pro at it.  You can flirt back, or pass on this one-- she might not be looking for a relationship, just a confidence boost.
AA11555180	You can help her by always hanging out with her so she can be too busy to think about him. Assure her that there's better guys out there that want her and to not setttle for the losers like him. Just let her know your always there if she needs you.|`|VnANJK0vaa	Just tell her to forget him and that he's a jerk!|`|2e0deb8399281efd7e6f9ee4e6dbeb6faa	He should have respected her for her dislike of PDA. He's a jerk. Just tell her that she can do better and to just wait for the right guy. She can learn from this experience.<br>  It seems like he just wanted her for the thrill not for HER. <br>  Be there for your friend and help her to forget him. She's a lot better off without him. Maybe you guys could do a voodoo burning of his picture or something. Make sure to hang out with her often to take her mind off him.

AA11538639	Just tell him that you care about him and you hope that he takes care of his health coz you want him to live longer.<br>  <br>  at the same time say that it also concerns you that <br>  second hand smoke may have long term effects on you <br>  and the other family members health.<br>  <br>  goodluck...<br>  <br>  my parents were chronic smokers.<br>  my dad got diagnosed with cancer when he was in his 40's. my mom in her 50's... she just passed on last december 2006 before christmas.|`|AA12198711	Chances are he already knows it.<br>  <br>  Won't change the fact he smokes and will not make him stop unless he wants to. He has to want to do it for himself, no one else.|`|AA10702820	Just say, "Hey Dad, I don't like it that you smoke. It's really unhealthy for you and I just don't like the fact that you are doing that to your lungs." Or something like that. Maybe you could tell him WHY you dislike him smoking and see if you can convince him to possibly quit.<br>  <br>  'Hope this helps!|`|5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	My guess is that he has been a smoker for a long time so you probably grew up around it.  I am sure he has heard it a million times.  I would find out why he does it and if he wants to quit because if he doesn't truly want to he will just make promises and not keep them.  If he really wants to then offer to help and give him support.  If he doesn't want to then you are out of luck.  Let him know how you feel but also make sure he knows that you will not be around him as much if he does.  Second hand smoke can sometimes be more fatal than the smoke that the smoker takes in.|`|5ZajLSyWaa	Tell your dad that smoke is really bad for the health. Give him instances like the what happend to the relative of your friend due to smoking thru that you let your dad scared if he still continues his smoking. So tell him that you really don't like what happend to relative of your friend and since you are non-smoker most likely you have more chances to have a lung ailment than him. Telling him that maybe he might be scared for your health and start avoiding smoking especially inside the house.|`|AA11767291	If he won't respect his own body ; you can't really make him respect you wishes . Try appealing to him on the dangers of second hand smoke . It kills . You MIGHT try telling him : "When you can't breathe - nothing else matters".|`|EJA5c23Xaa	Tell him. What have you got to lose.<br>  <br>  I told my mom and it has been 3 years now since she quit and my step dad quit this year.|`|PsrLweKIaa	You TELL HIM!  Over and over and over and over again.  Give him all the STOP SMOKING pamphlets and info you can find. Give him pics of dead lungs, and/or anything that will affect him enough to stop. If he can't do it for himself, he should do it for his family.  It's not only a disgusting smelly habit, it's going to kill him, or wore, those around him from the 2nd hand smoke.|`|Qp2j90Ytaa	Just tell him...<br>  <br>  I know I did.<br>  <br>  It's not as hard as you think.<br>  <br>  At least he heard ya...<br>  <br>  But you can't expect him to quit just coz of what you said.<br>  <br>  it's not that easy...

There was obviously a reason why you dumped him.  I mean, you changed your number on the guy.|`|1e9f35c18f9433400ecb003dc06c1ddeaa	personally, i feel that u should not go back to him.<br>  maybe at first u might find it a little bit hard to forget him, but as time went by u would forget it.|`|2435c947290f7fe28c88527d3aac7ec8aa	no leave him alone find someone else get restraining order if need be good luck and god bless
NNSex7cFaa	My opinion would be to let it be known you like him, with out making yourself look desperate. Then wait to see if HE makes the move|`|2TKe4577aa	Sure why not?|`|gdgZCGaVaa	if u got his number casually txt message him and kind if start something like u like him (which u do) and just come out and say u wanna go out with me. That's how me and my baby got hooked up|`|wgpsCMfaaa	YES
AA10287744	If he is receiving emails from a woman you need to speak to him about it. That is emotional cheating and to me it is worse per say because they confide into this woman or man usually things that they should be talking to the wife about. If she is calling him babby, or whatever it was I would find out who it is. Also it could be innocent. Sometimes we see something and when we don't know what it is or understand it we can allow our imagination to run away with us, so before you keep getting stressed about it bring it to his attention.|`|MjfrrsGPaa	If it bothers you this much you need to bring it up to him. Sometimes him explaining himself makes everything okay.<br>  Let him know you are upset but dont over do it. And what did she say? You are very vague.|`|7823a3ee0872a6ae329f9b447fd183a5aa	wow. you need to put a stop to that now!!!!! check his pockets, his car, his cell phone, buy that keyboard logger thing. gifts could be to keep you from questioning.|`|eLMLZcc1aa	can you be more specific, whats weird???<br>  <br>  I have a similar problem so can empathise,  ok soo, does he know you have read the email?  If not then its hard to broach the subject,if you admit you looked into his mail he will possibly change the address and get a new one or maybe he will understand your worry and upset and stop emailing her.  Ask him how he would feel if it was you emailing someone else.   I hope you sort things out and get peace of mind soon

EsNDPTxhaa	In my opinion, any sort of flirting isnt healthy for the relationship.  It undermines the honesty, loyalty and commitment a relationship should be based on.  It may spark passion, but the virtues end there.  Nothing good will come of it.  I consider any flirting inappropriate and disrespectful|`|8RSDDKROaa	Thats what kids do. She will date many guys & you will date many girls before you finish high school. You'll see.|`|rNR6TKnjaa	hugging boys are not ok,leting boy draw ur leg are not ok.|`|387628d49f4a6f87b02fc9d75dbdcf18aa	i think if anything you need to grow up a bit before jumping into things, women flirt naturally, but what your talking about is keeping her under lock and key and thats what you don't wanna do. how is your own self esteem and confidence, is it lower than it should be. If she is in love with you as you think she wouldn't cheat on you. hugging is more of a friendly gesture these days. So try not to let it get to you too much and if she does take it further with someone else ask yourself was she really worth the energy|`|T1QWcwYxaa	I wonder if she is flirting or only being nice. Ask yourself, before you were together, Did she flirt with you that way? That's the way she is, guy, so if you love her, you have to accept her being nice with other. If not, you must tell her what you think (but she won't like it)|`|zIFDlTt5aa	Yes  as long as its not too far up the leg. A little harmless flriting wont hurt her. Just talk to her about it

FVZThOnGaa	Heartbreak is so painful.  Woman and men take it differently.  Men will try to rebound and move on so the pain goes away right away.  Woman dwell on things it seems like and it takes a while for their emotions to evolve.  My ex-gf broke up with me 2 months ago.  Now I want her back and she wont even talk to me.  Sucks right?  Some how people like us need to move on, as hopeless as life seems.  It seems as every second is a struggle and you wish you could just be with that person.  Just try to be around friends I guess, and keep distracted.  You can e-mail me if you need more advice.|`|eLMLZcc1aa	Time to put closer on this old flame.  Its not nice to know our exes have someone else but he has moved on and has a chance to be happy with someone else.  let them be, move on and find someone of your own to love and make you happy.<br>  <br>  Dont forget, the innocent person in this is his new love, she doesnt deserve to be hurt either.  think how you would feel if you got back with ex and he was still emailing her??!!<br>  <br>  for your own sanity and peace of mind and peace in your heart. end this myspace relationship, facebook, myspace etc they are all causing so many problems with people looking up exes and getting in touch, people need to let go and move on, there are reasons these people are exes if they had been the one youd still be together.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and happiness with someone else.|`|AA11521614	Another man trying to have his cake and eat it too. Why are you surprised?|`|3GMRo4xQaa	i think that you should just try to cope with the idea that he does has a girlfriend and that hes moved on (just like YOU should!) <br>  if it helps, just tell him how you feel and just say that you wanted to get your feelings out, but want nothing to happen from there.<br>  or start going of group dates!! THOSE ALWAYS HELP!!
AA12095283	Well he's definitely interested.Try his phone again.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	ask him. it can't hurt. it isn't the end of the world if he says no. just stay friends if u want to. it really does sound like he likes you. just because u don't flirt doesn't mean he doesn't like you. it just means that you guys feel so comfortable around each other that you don't need to flirt. if he says yes about liking you then great but if he says no it will hurt but u will get over it.
VeLRJeEJaa	it depends how far you want to take it. You'll never be the drummer for the rolling stones but you can take it far if you are really really dedicated. My dad was an amazing drummer and he told me not to do it. I tried, and he was right. I knew very quickly that it was far too much for me. However, if it really feels right for you then there is absolutely nothing stopping you. Just make sure you have the focus and determination to make it work. If you really want this it will require at least 3 hours every day of the week. have you got the spare time?

It may be a passing fad so don't spend a whole lot on the kit. Get the basics and try it out with some instruction. The best part is that if you do not like it after a while, you can sell your stuff on EBay, which is where I would probably start by purchasing there. That way if you decide to quit, you know how much you can sell it for and not have to advertise in some paper.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
dO7yjQUbaa	i would never do that in case it happens 2 me..|`|QLhuYWmxaa	i gave one to my older cousin. because he was being mean to me. he kept socking me. so i gave him an atomic wedgie. it was men but totally funny.|`|oN4acv6Faa	wow now this is a question for me as I laugh into tear's..  When I was like 12 year's old.. Me and my best friend   use to know this kid Bobby and he  was a very chubby  boy and was very annoying.. He alway's came around us and wanted to play and we were like go away your a pain in the  butt..  So one day we thought of something very mean to do.. Yes it was a wedgie and he wore tighty wighty's (aka  fruit of a loom's ewwwww).. Anyway's we use to pull his underwear's up ova his head and it would ripe them like crazy .. He would be yelling stop it stop it as he cryed in pain and then got up running with his underwear wrapped ova his head like a cap with sometimes poo stain's in them and we would laugh harder.. Omg  did we laugh  so dang hard  as I rolflmfao now writing this.. We did it just about everytime weekend we saw him,but after a while when he saw us coming he would scream and run home.. Man did he go through some underwear buying in his house lol.. <br>        I look back at it now  and feel really bad .. It was not a nice thing to do and was very mean and hurtfull.. When we got older we met up with Bobby again and  he was very skinny and told us he forgave us for what we use to do and then he started to laugh about it,so we did also.. Not everyone can fogive and forget,but he sure did and that was great.. I sure hope my six year old neva goes through that kinda bullyness or do it to someone else as the bully.. I know we all are kid's at one point and wanna be popular,but sometimes it is not worth it in the long run.. <br>  <br>                ciao Mia Bella

JHVcIeYAaa	Okay, I am going to be completely honest with you. You sound like a total jerk. Most girls don't want to have guys making moves on them, especially since she doesn't like you that way. Don't be a pig, control yourself. Do not push her into doing anything because that would be rape. If she only likes you as a friend, accept that and move on..or get to know her better. Don't go into this trip thinking "I am gonna get some" because that is rude. Oh, and by the way, judging from your grammar, you are too immature to handle this situation anyways. Be a man, not a boy.

If you love someone truly you don't really care much about the male friends you leave behind, and you never want to make you boyfriend jealous.|`|B4rVE1vhaa	Okay maybe from the male spectrum it seems that way, but in my case it's always okay for a husband/boyfriend to be friends with a girl. God forbid you give eye contact to another man, in most cases - in my experience - the male freaks out. And if you happen to have a friend who is a guy they get more and more overbearing in a way. They ask a lot of questions about the guy, eventually try to see if he can make sure you don't hang out with this guy. Even if he's gay he won't want you to be friends...you know, "Just in case"|`|QrVoutl1aa	Because women are jealous creatures, it is just our nature.  Can't explain it and I can't even try.

You will be setting yourself up for heartbreak if they don't live up to your expectations, or worse, leave you.|`|QfjrZpCkaa	wow... that's difficult but there is a few things that you could do like well call her more often or find someone it could be over the net or in your hometown but if you can find someone that will listen to you and you are comfortable talking to than shear it with them till she is back

u4BIAFKVaa	Someone told me this once:<br>  you can have unlimited friends, you can have many best friends, but you can only have one best friend forever. <br>  once you find your best friend forever, you will know it. and just because you find your bff, doesnt mean you lose the other ones. not at all. you just found that one special person that you rely on so much more than the others.|`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	Hey,<br>  <br>   Friends are treasures. Some are the very best true ones while others are just friends. It dosn't matter if you only have one true friend . Leat you got someone to really talk to anytime you need one. Be true to your friends as to being true to yourself. Collect and have many has you want. Never lose them in your heart. Don't lose the others . If a person forces you, isn't true as a friend and dosn't care. Then They'll not worth  your friend and you have every right to should lose them.|`|YKlC3olXaa	I wouldn't worry about "losing" anybody. Just keep things the way you are and be glad you were lucky enough to find a true best friend|`|vc08jEkvaa	You only need 1 good friend. Screw the others.|`|kEkFABt3aa	don't lose the rest of them. What happens if you and your friend have a HUGE fight? who are you going to go to?|`|149f8c019afa5998094911579fce80d8aa	No, but i think people should have one best friend that they can trust and rely on|`|5385f9885a2e4f9643c2d418afe162c3aa	Why lose the others? You can't have too many friends. Just because they all aren't  your "best" friends don't mean you have to dump them. It's nice to have someone you can tell anything to. When you are 11, you are just learning about how to be a true friend. You are not born with the knowledge. As you get older you understand how to treat people better. Cut your "other" friends some slack, they just aren't mature as you are yet.
404c2aee361a2a1767930d3ce6714ce1aa	I'd wait.  You're parents are strict, but they are just trying to ensure that you grow up to be a good young gentleman. Think about it. How much more trouble will you be in if they find out you were dating behind their backs? They could refuse to let you get your license because it'd be easier for you to sneak out.<br>  <br>  Just trying to make you think a little. Besides, it's not that much longer before you're 16 anyway.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|5385f9885a2e4f9643c2d418afe162c3aa	You shouldn't date till your at least 16, then do it in a group setting. Slow down...you've got your whole life. You are screwing up your own life, how hard is it to stop swearing and talk better? It shows what kind of a person you are. You don't impress the girls with a potty mouth. Unless you want a chick with a potty mouth. Then you'd be perfect for each other. One day you'll look back and understand why your parents do what they do. If your smart.|`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	Hey,<br>   I know how it feels to be 15 once.<br>   No,your parents are not crazy . Do your part as respectig their rules, making them realize how mature you can be . Then they will do their part as saying you are allowed to be dating guys .<br>  There is nothing wrong with having a guy until the part to be sexually active. Then people talk if you do that. And your parents are just there to protect from that because you're worth waiting for. Think about ,how many girls do you think you want that peron to have slept with,when you get married ? 0 -right<br>  cause your  special . Good luck at 16,getting guys. But,never take it to the max then. Hope I answered your question in the best way i could.|`|CfqiEcwTaa	i pitty you.youre parents are totally crazy.|`|3c7SIbeyaa	If you get caught then you will break their trust, something you don't want to do.  August 28 will be here in no time wait, don't risk losing their trust for a couple of months.  You will need their trust later on trust me!  We are not crazy just more experienced as BEEN THERE DID THAT and got the T-shirt.<br>  <br>  Kids seem to think that their parents have been adults ever since they were born.  We were teenages at one time too, and in our minds it feels like yesterday.  We have already did the stuff that teenages do, ask your parents some stories about when they were a teenager, <what they did, who they dated etc.. you may be surprised about what you hear.> (I bet you didn't even think about asking that did you <teenagers>?)|`|64a3333eeba6de91fcbd5fd4688acabcaa	wait till you are 16..its not that long since you've waited all this while..|`|DIHqCwu0aa	wait until you are 16 or later|`|H47sHGjoaa	Well, all parents are crazy when you are 15-18 or so.  The older you get, the smarter your parents become.  Prepare for that.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say, but it sounds as if you have some things to learn about socializing and relationships.  If the Scouts gave you the boot, you really should think of that as a wake-up call, and consider that maybe your parents are right.<br>  <br>  Everybody, you included, needs to learn to talk properLY.  And it helps to learn to spell and have good grammar.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a car at 16, I suggest you start looking at ads.  You pretty much don't want a car that is worth less than maybe $3000 minimum, and at 16, if you try to insure it yourself, you're looking at some huge number like $300 a month!  Can you afford that?<br>  <br>  The other option is if your parents let you drive one or more of their cars.  They will probably have to pay an extra $50-$100 a month for that.  But the reason it's cheaper is because the insurance companies assume they have control over when and where you are allowed to drive it.  And even if the car is yours, if you're under 18, they STILL get to tell you what to do!<br>  <br>  So that puts you back to where you started. Either you make a ton of money to afford your own car, or you play by their rules in order to drive theirs.<br>  <br>  My advice:  Clean up your act.  Learn to speak and write like a gentleman.  You will not only impress your parents, you will impress a much better class of girlfriend material, and (this is a biggie) you will impress the girl's parents, too!  If the parents think you're a dirtbag, they'll try to protect their daughter from you.  If they are impressed by you, you'll have a much easier time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NzIBoAE1aa	There is an old saying, "Insanity is hereditary, parents get it from their children."<br>  <br>  Basically, you're one running batch of hormones and just aching to find a girl and make out with her.  Only problem is your father was exactly the same thing - and had the same thoughts - when he was your age. <br>  <br>  Your mother was one of those girls that guys hit on when she was the same age as girls you're thinking about, and probably did all the things with guys (other than your father) that you're thinking about doing with girls now.<br>  <br>  So the fact is that they've been in the same situation as you and virtually any girl you're going to find, and they know everything that you're thinking about and want to do, probably because they've also done all of those things at one time or another.   <br>  <br>  It bothers a lot of people to come to the realization that their parents had sex, and probably had it with multiple partners before they met each other.  Eventually your parents met each other and decided to stop seeing others and become exclusive with each other.<br>  <br>  Since they know everything going on in your head, they're probably trying to 'reel you in' a little so you don't do something drastic or make a horrible mistake (like have sex with an underage girl) or make a tragic one (like get some girl pregnant).<br>  <br>  One of the things you can do is be sure you always use a condom when you do have sex.  You're going to have to show that you're willing to be careful and will not make bad mistakes.  Also find out what the rules are in your state because in some states it's okay to have consensual sex with someone under 18 if they're within a few years of you, in some states it's not a serious crime (a misdemeanor) and in some states it can still get you serious jail time (a felony) if her parents get mad.|`|P4m3HrAtaa	Definatley wait.

There's no point in getting a girlfriend at your age ..you aren't ready to get married . I'll bet your parents are trying to prepare you for the future..when you'll have to run your own life ; and they want you to be prepared .|`|fb5381187e3084ae547116a60f7fd287aa	They are not crazy. Maybe a little strict but it really is because they love you. You are almost 16, just be patient. They are just looking out for you. Relax, your time is coming.

Porn star John Holmes was reportedly about that size. <br>  <br>  If a man was that size, there would be two significant problems:<br>  Any woman having sex with him would be likely to suffer injuries if he attempted to penetrate the full length, unless she herself was of above average dimensions<br>  It is very likely he would be physically unable to acheive a full erection. This in turn could cause problems in having sex. I am far from that size and know from personal experience that attempting sex without a full erection can be uncomfortable and/or painful for both people.

You may not like the truth...but it is the truth.....|`|KvAQ4Wueaa	well for me, i like it when a guy is sweet and nice. they have to be easy to talk to and have a sense of humor. i especially like it when a guy does really nice things like open the door for me or if we're hanging out and eating somewhere that they would ask me "so, what are you gonna order?" just to talk to me and take interest in me. sure these answers maybe really lame but you asked me, a girl, what i like in a boy and there ya go. hope this helps|`|PajqPn29aa	A guy  who is honest and who is always himself, there is nothing better unless he can do that and make me laugh!|`|bCcjd9Cyaa	well girls who only care about there rep. will only like a guy for his looks. but a true girl will really care about a guys heart. it matters what type of girl it is. some girls lke funny guys, some smart, and ect. you just have to be yourself. and then a girl will truelly like you.
kC8UIOBuaa	my man has to have respect for me, for himself and for anyone else he may know or may not know. he must be honest, good looks wont kill but not necessary, a great body would be nice too but not necessary. decent looking, someone u can bring home to mom and dad. trustworthy, he has to treat me right, dresses good and with happy colors, says what he feels, doesnt hide things, loveable, tall, not obese and not skinny, toned mostly lol. cant be racist, has to be open minded, willing to do crazy things, or try something new. cant be controlling. <br>  <br>  jeez the list goes on and on lol.|`|T7kus7OMaa	well.. i dont go for looks.. i love it when a man is very caring and sweet..|`|CGO96DAOaa	A nice body, someone that can make me laugh, someone that wants what I want, someone that wants to take things slow, someone who is not afraid to have fun, someone who has a nice smile and great eyes. But most importantly, his personality is what turns me on!!!!!!!Hope that answers your question.|`|NC2f9HXBaa	me.. for some reason.<br>  i dont really care if a guy is nice.<br>  but i do wish he is nice at the right moment..<br>  and i want him to be tough..<br>  and superrrr cute..<br>  lol<br>  and i guess i want him to be taller ...|`|QLhuYWmxaa	funny, smart,respectful, some one who actually cares about me and doesn't treat me like an object.|`|gr2pkgSeaa	smart, funny, witty, respectful is good, handsome..

I love an intelligent man who is not afraid of an intelligent woman. Wit and humor is a must. I like old school charm... Honestly, there must be some form of attraction in terms of looks but i am ultimately won over by personality in the end.
l1b892tUaa	it's just that the world that we live in to day we don't really don't who are the last virgins or you may be giving off a strong attraction to a lot of men but that just makes you even more ready for the world but just don't let the world walk all over you!|`|b7728f00168db7c239579de9956d8592aa	Are you a flirt ???  (nothing wroung with that at all) Or has a past B-F been talking himself up you down???|`|bCWuoumqaa	try not taking it as a insult|`|1TrRrWMLaa	It may be that you are outgoing and friendly. Most girls that are good looking and outgoing that dress even somewhat sexy men think, gee I bet shes wild in bed. You may be a bit of a flirt, if girls flirt to much then she is thought as being, well lets just say willing and able, if you follow me. It is not in what you look like it is 1 how you act and come across to others, 2, the fact that most people above the age of 16 are not any more. I would not let it bother you to much, who cares what people think, if they can think at all.|`|e9a405e7afb24b57040a72811cbd2d47aa	sorry...girl here...but...<br>  i don't know...<br>  sometimes the way you portray yourself without knowing you do it...<br>  not only the way you dress...but...how you act, talk, and just live everyday life...
l1b892tUaa	tell him you love to have sex and you enjoy giving ********'s and that you are a expert at it and that you want him at be his dummy for the day Na!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm playing not all guy's are like that that should be your last resort , buy him a video game and really watch him play it and get just excited as he is even if you don't enjoy it (make sure it's a game he is dieing for) like god of war that is a good game that is on every man and boy's wish list and also you can take him shopping and maybe if he's not broke by the time you are finish you can squeeze something in their for you or if you brook put on a nice outfit and it has to be something new and hot something that you know that will get his attention and new perfume and flirt a lot and if he ask and questions tell him your open to a lot of new thing's! if nothing works then just ask him what he likes to do and just do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|83a8668be203400660d4812ea05094afaa	its not what you do it is what they do, let them touch u, or as i like to call it, (love tap). But  some girls dont like that so its up to you.|`|AA11398252	cleavage, breast will do if for me everytime....|`|ShVFRcnDaa	Alone in private or not?<br>  <br>  Not in private? Whisper to him what you're going to let him do later, make it good.<br>  <br>  In private, bend over & demand you be dealt with.|`|h0pyvXJOaa	I would say to just be yourself and let your inhibitions go. It's not that hard to do if you connect. The little things are what do it for me, like soft touches, snuggling, a kiss out of nowhere, fondling when your in public but no one can see it's the ultimate excitment to know you could get caught but dont care.|`|bwO7kyYxaa	If you're sitting next to him, put your hand on his leg real slow and smooth, then slowly whisper all sexy into his ear, "I want you to f*ck my brains out," or something like that.  Maybe no those exact words, but something along those lines.
F1BLIbQKaa	Well, I'm actually 16, but I've had some bad boyfriend experiences so I wanted to answer. What I (and most girls) look for in a guy is that he treats us like actual people and not just toys they can mess around with. I look for guys that will treat me like a princess, open doors for me, give me his coat when it's cold, etc. Also a guy that will listen and help you with problems. The best boyfriend is also your best friend. I also look for guys that won't pressure me to do anything physical with them. Most girls will only go as far as kissing and don't want to go any farther, and pressuring them to go farther isn't fair to them. Just treat her like she's the only thing that matters, that's what girls want.|`|iEnhy2cEaa	he has to be shy,sweet,sexy,and simple!14 and i love MR510!lol|`|6QZAgSuuaa	He needs to be willing to tell me everything and be sweet and nice to me. <br>  He has to listen to my problems and hold me when I am crying. <br>  He must be a fun person, he will do anything with me if i am OK with it.<br>  He just has to love me a lot and have me as his only girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  I only like one guy and I dont know if he likes me. I want him to be my boyfriend but.... i dont know.|`|6d4cd308eec0a7f47732d87cfab89023aa	* Romantic<br>  * Look= Not everythink<br>  * Cares<br>  * Show love<br>  * There when u need him<br>  * Just overall a good guy.. not a thoug or a pimp<br>   <3 Goddess|`|736ba93eae0fb44a087df1f2d3dd2073aa	I dont have a boyfriend but if I did he would have to a sense of humor. You should except her for who she is and what is on the inside; not on the outside. He would have to be sensitive and a good listener|`|QeqnPPl4aa	Don't act different around your friends then with ur girl. Oh and do not be so competitive with her. Oh girls love nice guys.
QLhuYWmxaa	yes. if he was my type.|`|cf57efb06e3044cf58581a153149510faa	What is on the inside counts...not outside...sorry<br>  By the way I am married<br>  But I am tired of people worrying about what is on the outside! I mean yeah your suppose to take care of yourself and stay healthy and such...but as far as looks go and handi caps. .....they mean nothing to me. If this happened to my husband I wouldn't think anything less of him!!!|`|6b631b41a55fd4c20a6deb208cea3578aa	In that case i think that the person would have to really love you for who you are and not concentrate on the fact that you have this disorder. You should just wait im sure someone will come around...|`|8e79e8ebbebd987aa6bf908b8f9977c3aa	Um... no. I wouldn't want to be tied down with having to take care of a significant other's problems when I have my whole life ahead of me. That was my sugarcoated answer.|`|CN6GysW2aa	Sorry no I wouldn't.<br>  But can't you learn to pee in a toilet?<br>  Potty training?|`|uyBvk9mlaa	no but um there r girls i know that would.<br>  <br>  lolo it's true I'm not lying k.
krjVGgRTaa	Good relationships take work.  You need to make time for each other.  I work nights, and my girl works days.  We find ways to communicate throughout the day.  My favorite is to write a message on the dry erase board.  That is the first thing that she sees when she wakes up(me too) and it always brightens up my day.  It might not be easy at first but once you get a routine it should help.  Communication is one of the main keys to a healthy, strong relationship.  If you or he are not willing to make it work then don't waste the effort.|`|91fd08d9bc3cc51c7146d43928395ab0aa	Dont make hasty decisions.Everyone is busy in their own way and everytime he cannot be available for you.Less expectations,more the happiness,so, dont break up for this reason.|`|4BdXBjwQaa	my 2 best friends are in the same situation, its almost as if summer is pulling them apart, he has a summer job with his dad, and hes pretty strict with work (HE WOULD FIRE HIM) and  its always when his gf wants to make plans, they didnt see each other once this summer, its driving them both crazy, i just talked to his gf today, and she was crying, saying 'its almost as if i'm fcking single, i never see him, and the only time i talk to him is online because her phone is broken, and her dad is mad strict too..  but please, just wait.. give it time, because i know my 2 best friends aren't going to end, and you don't have to make that decision, even if you feel like you've been patient long enough, breathe.. think.. just feel good.. do something with your friends.. and try not to talk about him with them, unless you go totally emotional and start crying.. but umm also, try talking to him on the phone, tell him to call you whenever he's not doing anything.. you could also make a schedule, of both your daily routines so you know when each other is free|`|HygCmU0qaa	Try to understand that he must have also other priorities other than you. Understand that his whole world does not revolve only to you, and that he is only 16. I think he is not yet ready. But it is not good to break up with him immediately. Why don't you ask him what makes him so busy? Do not test him because he might even the first one to step out of the relationship. If you really love him, you'll understand.
mS6DhI4uaa	First off I read the answers before and it seams that you don't have the best advice. <br>       Do not write a note. It's insensitive and impersonal like a business letter. She would think your not really taking it seriously. <br>       Do not send messages through friends. Its insensitive and anything could go wrong and you could end up dating her uncles guinea pig. NOT GOOD.<br>       Definitely do not fart on her under ANY circumstances. It's EXTREMELY rude. <br>       First you need to get to know her as a friend start saying hi when you see her in the halls or whatever that way you have some idea of how she will react to you.<br>       When you do ask her out make sure you are alone don't ask her in front of all your friends or her friends their is way to much pressure.<br>        If she says yes, to make a really good impression ask to meet her dad. Then ask her dad if you have permission to go out with her. They would be really impressed with your mature and sensitive behavior. If her parents say no it means no wait till you are older.     <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  P.S. No kissing on the first date if she is that shy you need to take it Slooooooooooooowly.|`|ZGNmj56naa	text message her to get to know her first. it helped me in my situation|`|bHQa3FnZaa	write a note or something to her saying that you like her and would like to go out sometime.then give it to one of her friends to give to her, maybe it will work. if not good luck.|`|4B8oGfJiaa	Fart on her, it always breaks the ice. If she act all discusted then ditch her, your doon't want a stuck up do you?|`|70576ab1b38f12b9364060a488f36a5eaa	how about asking her friend to tell her you are interested,then probably you guys can start talking then eventually you will find the courage to ask her out or who knows she might suggest you guys go hang out.but you have to be good company,|`|UtuNxyPOaa	Just give her a kiss straight on her lips when you and she are alone.|`|bkbD4kjxaa	YOU DONT HAVE A PICTURE ??<br>  <br>  WHY DO YOU LIKE OTHER MEN ?<br>  <br>  IM NOT YOU ?|`|oKXnzkY1aa	oook this is what you do u try and try to talk to her about random things if she dosnt really open up then you need to make her laugh just dont make a jackass of urself ok ....that should get her to open up more u know ....goood luck:)|`|xt0n3cujaa	Try to stike up a conversation with her.  Just tell her how you feel about her, and ask her if she is interested in you.  Honesty is a good way to deal with the shy ones ;-)|`|z0npmoYeaa	you gotta see whats she is interested to and her personality or problems, once you understand her, she'll eventually get close to you.
raxjSFYHaa	Sounds like you're better off without him! You'll meet someone soon who will love and treat you the way you deserve! That will help you stop thinking about Mr. ex !!Till then try to keep busy, and surround yourself with GOOD FRIENDS !|`|ix6DrRJjaa	And you probably never will, until you replace him,   with someone better... Either that, or get really promiscuous and make recreational sex such a way of life for yourself so much so that you blow him and his legacy out of the water...|`|uNGF2JMDaa	ahh i'm going through the same thing and it sucks. he was my first bf, first everything. kinda treated me like crap.and i misss him. just watch a lot of funny movies that will help you keep your mind off him, go to the mall. or try and get a new bf!|`|TNHxbjSyaa	DONT FEEL BAD ALOT OF GUYS DO THAT.

And i just realized that i was totally stupid for thinking him still, inspite the fact that its not my lose to loss him, but its his loss to lose me. <br>  <br>  I have been thinking that i have done alot to save the relationship, is he worthy enough for the SACRIFICES YOU GAVE HIM? for everything you did not only for your happiness but also for his? did he exchange somethings that would totally make u happy like you will never forget that for the rest of your life... if its no...then dont waste your time..<br>  <br>  there are lots and i mean LOTS OF MALES OUTHERE.. who deserves your love and your happiness.. i'm sure you'll just laugh out loud when u realized that, that guy you've been thinking off isn't worth it...|`|ivkeQEbaaa	Oh sweetie om sooo sorry, I feel u gurl!<br>  there will always be times when you just think about him and just want to cry but dont! i know its hard but you have to get over him. Trust me this is for the better! He was a jerk & he doesnt deserve you.<br>  I was in this situation just a little while ago... I broke up with my boyfriend because he was with another girl(who i hated!) and i knew he wasnt goin 2 change so i left him before he had a chance to do that to me. <br>  <br>  I found out that the best thing to do at times like these was to take a few days for some alone time to relax and let go of all the stress and emotion inside. Then when that time is over, ITS OVER let go of the past and do things that make you happy. Have your friends around.<br>  Get a cup of coffee (yum!)<br>  Go see a movie<br>  Go shopping with friends!<br>  Have a sleepover!<br>  Forget about the losers who dont kno what they have until they lose everything<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun and cheer up!<br>  you will DEFINITELY find some one better<br>  TRUST ME!!!|`|m58pZOYtaa	whenever u have an urge to think of him just change your thought and think of some one else u admire... eventually ur thoughts wud vanish.

U got mad & didnt mean wht u said to her. say sorry for being too emotional but juz bcoz you truly care abt her. (even u dun reali love her, jus pretend to be and make her forgive u)|`|a3oDk61Haa	If you thought of her as a "real ***** and selfish and stuck up." girl, then why did you go out again? And why DON'T you hate her?? You don't need forgiveness if she was a selfish slut! You're just aiming the gun at your foot! Move on and get a new girl or better yet, don't date for a while. And by the way, all girls hate being called a slut, no matter who they are! Most don't think they are.|`|cTlUtIacaa	then dont go out with selfish stuck up b*tches god its so obivously SILLY BOYS! LOL cute but stupid
iMK1unKraa	take him out more places.. and just tell him to be himself it will work|`|ix6DrRJjaa	Sometimes he needs to lower his expectations...Of course, there may not be that many kids in his own class to make friends with, but don't forget there are younger kids from lower classes who would love to play with him, even maybe look up to him as a role model....There are no rules against that is there? Don't knock your head against the same futile tree.|`|HONifAASaa	I think you should attempt to get your child into some extracurriculars. However it could be that they are just more mature than the other kids in their grade and don't have much of an interest in being friends with the other children. The only way to know is to try, I suppose.|`|1IT9cx6xaa	Aw. I thikn that in the earlier years there is a bti of a separation when a kid is a very high achiever. Not to be to general but kids of a certain age usually have the same demeanor, and when you have a child who is gift, their mind is on a different level than the masses. It does show a bit in behavior and being able to relate.<br>  Is there anything academic that you child may be able to do that involves teamwork? That could be a way to find other children on the same wavelength.<br>  Alternatively, there's the kinda brute force way. Remember kids make and break friend in an instant. Just see if there's anyone even remotely friendly with you child, and have you kid go to their house for some type of activity.<br>  I've noticed before that the link between friends and aquaintances at shcool isn't always what goes on at school. It has to do with the fact that the kids who are closest at school having external contact as well. This applies even through High School. Oh and of course there's always team oriented sports.|`|5ZajLSyWaa	Sometimes it's really like that she may excel in other things but lack on other things. Since your child is an achiever the more chances your child can gain friends. If there are instances let your child socialize or mingle with her cousins or other friends so that your child gets to use to it. Give your child a support so that he/she would feel confident on his/herself with that he/she can start to have friends.|`|TuBUkcS1aa	find him an after school club or activity that HE enjoys and I bet that he'll find some great friends that he relates to and has things in common with.|`|Ve22Y4k8aa	Try to make a party and ask all his friends to come.maybe this will increase the chance of him to make new friends.and try to ask him what makes him so difficult in making friends.maybe he has some problem that make him feel low self esteem and to shy to make new friends
f953b369677f9ea6df7de78a1afea18eaa	Some sort of distant cousin.Your best luck is to go to the library and ask the librarian or, u know, firemen can help too! That's pretty darn cool that you and your friend are related.A dream come true!I wish i was your friend! Now your Friend and you can do so much stuff together...like EAT CHEESE! I like cheese. You ought to be the luckiest girl in town! Can i call you Sherri because i like the name Sherri. You want to be friends?

Ve22Y4k8aa	Dude,u seriously need to clarify ur feeling.u feel awkward doing 'couple' things with her but also feel guilty going out with other girl when ur r around her?well,let's see...if me,i would say u do start to look more than friends.the awkward feeling when u do stuffs togather with other couple is maybe because u never get used to it,well.. 'as a couple'.|`|HvJpbTH8aa	well then u do have feelings 4 her just do what ur doin if u guys were ment to be then u will end up wit each other as couples but just dont ask her are we friends or whateva <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|cbJocKbzaa	Bagel (i'm not sure that's your real name),  i think you can ask her about your feeling and ask her do she has a special feeling when she with you. you have to know if two friends often together, maybe love could be happen between them.
okw4GmFOaa	A women doesnt have to be stick thin to get a guy. Some guys actually hate that. I always thought a good looking girl was skinny but also had a good amount of flesh on her bones. A guy who truly loves you will go for whats on the inside and not what you look like. Looks are just the icing on the cake.|`|3Zs3uVaZaa	well i am a BBW (big beautiful woman) and i have a boyfriend and we are very much in love. does that answer your question?|`|ViXXGsKuaa	i'm a thick girl and i have a boyfriend..................so i would have to say yes guys go for "big" girls too.   hey some guys even prefer a girl with meat on her bones to some of those skinny supermodels.|`|oala9OAHaa	its just more cushion for the pushin :)|`|7tpAq9eWaa	dont go skinny, do us all a favour. i mean skinny is ok but not anorexic (dont mind spelling). just eat healthy and jog sometimes.

aKRpUIU3aa	it comes naturally but one time i heard if you should try to spell your name with your tongue...ive never tried it bc my bf is fine with the way i make out with him but maybe itll help you =)|`|gFzOtCisaa	it should all come natural to you if it is with i guy you really like.|`|ubdlR0Vnaa	here are a few tips<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/308131/the_10_commandments_of_kissing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>
pvWua3CMaa	Love is above all divisions of male n female and other castes religions and all....<br>  Love has no definitions...It is not just loving your lover or your parents n family, it also the love for pets for trees for environments, for pens etc...<br>  Love has no boundaries, it is a feeling, that has no limitations<br>  <br>  Life is the same way not bounded by male or female....life is all about being what you are
RgCS36hmaa	you don't need to feel guilty honey...you just did the right thing to searched for your answer...all you could do now is just love him and understand for what he is..you can't change that ..just let him go ..your not the one who's lost ...it's him ....smile:)|`|gspyr4Glaa	I understand how u feel. I think every women will do the same when they suspect their husband. I did the same and also felt guilty but then again, if he didn't cheat, we wouldn't check on them.  It seems that he is now putting the blame on you for not trusting him.  You should ask him to why he lied to you even if he said he was just playing around. Tell him how all these actually affected your relationship. You care and treasure the relationship, that's why you want to check to find out the truth.  If he cannot forgive you for what you have done, then there is nothing you can do.  If you still love him and can bear with him, just leave him do whatever he wants.  If there is no looking back, then that's it. Good luck.|`|414c960adabb7b7085c30f125f603068aa	Having kids do make everything a little more complicated. But everything will work out eventually. Well, he's the one that wasn't 100% honest in the relationship, first by cheating on u, second by making that lie. You do have to feel bad, but you have to think of what you want. Is it to forgive him and reconcile or something else??|`|6ezmgdtfaa	he says he cant trust you?  You cant trust him! He lied to you!  He is either embrassed or angry that you found out about something he clearly didnt want you to know about.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing, in that you tried talking you tried communicating with him.  Good on you for doing your own research, just proves that you are no push over.<br>  <br>  It must be really hard, that you have kids.....of course you want the best for them.  You need to do what is right for you, what makes you happy, cause ultimately if your not happy, they wont be happy either cause mummy isnt happy...<br>  <br>  You didnt ruin the relationship, he was sneaky he was dishonest, he ruined the relationship.  It takes two to tango.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty...maybe have a cool off period.  Then go back and try and both of you have a good talk.  Some real communication.<br>  <br>  If he doesnt want to try to make it work...if he wants out.  He wants out, he's weak and he clearly doesnt want to make it work (for whatever reasons....you have your suspicions...you might find out or you might not)...im really sorry... i really hope you guys can talk and work it out.  He's just making you feel guiltl<br>  <br>  Since there are kids involved....well firstly you really have to do what is best for you, what you feel is the right thing, including the children's interest in mind. What makes you happy.....Cause you deserve more than being made to feel guilty and being lied to...<br>  <br>  Good luck....|`|QgiSWB3gaa	you should NOT have invaded his privacy like that I learned that from my bf its just wrong.Men will answer or tell you when<br>   they are ready___silly!|`|jKbQ6khvaa	Are you a woman?
9HPUzoJRaa	i know the feeling beleive me.  all i can say is it takes time, a lot of time to move on under those circumstances.  took me almost 4 years|`|5hEFrsPEaa	thats so sad -_-, don't look for love, true love finds you.|`|EK0PRl8gaa	yeah! dont worry!! some girl will come along and you will be meant for eachother!! you are just a young person anyways!!|`|uFBeJkXyaa	go on dating networks and blah blah or look at porno
zQgNL3n0aa	no thats now weird. me and my guy friends do that stuff all the time.|`|AA12092430	he probly has mono and this is his sick way of getting closer to u, he wants the both of u to have the same thing|`|sh7plVIDaa	Ur joking right you are asking why he is drinking your Gatorade?|`|6dy1Ugkgaa	No i don't think so wuts wrong wit that, if u were choking and the only liquid sorce that was around u was his water bottle, and of course you'd drink it or die, anyway me and my (guy) friend shared a very yummy brownie once, and we were really good friends|`|EhJlgKLAaa	no i dont think so because its less than making out. Im 15 and me and this guy shared a pack of poprocks and we both licked the sides of the packet because they were stuck and had exchanged to get the extras off. lol kinda nasty sounding but i dont think its weird.|`|VEXh9GyIaa	i dont think its weird at all|`|nPW43wJ3aa	uhm, no i dnt think its a big deal at all. who cares if he drinks ur drink, it means he comfortable w u at least
AA12305131	I think it's extremely wise.  I commend you for wanting to get your life in order rather than put another person through the pain of getting attached to you and then have you leave because you want to do something else across the country.  I think that's awesome!  I really do.  It's not crazy at all.  If you think about it -- it is a blessing to do this for your future family.    If you have your life in order, then you will be a better husband, a better friend, a better son, and a better father in the future.  Awesome plan.  Go for it.|`|E7liDKEWaa	I'm thinking exactly the same as you. you know wht, I juz couldnt concentrate on work when i hv a gf. Everytime i fell in love, i juz felt unconscious. Not sure if u hv the same problem. <br>  Is it wise? I dunno & but i do know there're many things in life tat worth fighting for. Dating is definitely not the most important one. maybe i'm crazy, but i'll go for it. If love comes, juz let it come.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	nothing wrong with that, i didn't date for almost 3 years between relationships. you have to do what makes you happy. if you don't want to date then don't. i think it's a good idea|`|9a40a330be2c9d69f628cb2dbc458128aa	there's nothing wrong with what you want to do. i just hope you can really control yourself. 5 years is a long time.
xF5iXlw3aa	I love my boobs, when im home i just jump in front of my mirror all night|`|QLhuYWmxaa	i personally don't like to. i think you should leave room for the imagination. and i really hate it when other girls just flaunt themselves at guys with their chest. it gets annoying. and it shows that they have to much self esteem (or to little) but it's their life, they should do wit  it what they will. good luck to them.|`|rZEeMIQJaa	My female friends love their boobs, but most of them are very confident and we all love their boobs too, we're a very close group....always naked around each other...hmmmm...but no orgies
AA11867266	Honestly - Your Mom is probably hurt that you want to live with your Dad and not her anymore. She probably feels she is not doing so well as a Mother to you. She did carry you in her womb for 9 months - and may have feelings of attachment because of that and by you leaving her for Dad might also giving her the message that you might not love her anymore -<br>  You need to sit down and discuss the reasons why you want to live with your Dad and not your Mom anymore. Maybe you both can work out a compromise - live with Dad for 6 months and then with Mom for 6 months - back and forth - <br>  My parents split when I was younger and we worked out a compromise - I stayed with my Dad every Weekend and half and half on the Holidays -<br>  Good Luck to you and your Family - Try to work things out.|`|TPcV5wvyaa	well maybe you should tak to her abt it or accompany her to morrocco
rynB1pdQaa	Try And Find Out What Causes Her To Think Your A Bad Influence N Try N Fix It Or Maybe Just Try N Sit Down With Her Mom N Tell How U Feel N Dat U Have Strong Feelings For Her Daughter N Would Never Let Anything Happen To Her. Then Tell Her You Apologize For Givin Da Impression That You Are A Bad Guy N Dat You Truly Are A Very Caring One|`|3B458DuXaa	i think the mom may secretly want you, thats why shes trying to keep you away from her daughter, she wants you all to her self, selfish mom, try banging her too, you'll be suprised.|`|3abfc80f859e04e1bf7e22e2d2894e20aa	Are you a bad influence?

I would need more details to give you a real answer. Maybe you can find out why she does not like you and try and change for the good.|`|67b9958e3f9478dc924202f30e727a8baa	you are the best person to answer this question, you know yourself better than we do, are really bad, would you really be a bad influence? if yes then leave the poor woman and her innocent daughter alone.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	i LOVE your avatar picture. sora ROX!!! but anyways, back to your question. well try to convince her that you are actually a really good kid and that you aren't a bad influence.tell her that you really like her daughter. try to make her believe that you r a good guy. but if she doesn't like you then there isn't all that much you can do besides this. and I'll say this again sora ROX!!!

kSHxjKA2aa	well violence is not the answer but i know sometimes you just have to fight so just punch her really hard in her stomach then grab her by hair and punch her face out till she bleeds|`|15b5659d2385fb2c5b82b1725a597335aa	Just stay away from her, getting into a fight can just make things worst and you could end up locked up in juvenile hall and probation.|`|nFyXrXVCaa	1) is she a school bully or u<br>  2) report her to the teacher <br>  3) speak to your parent<br>  4) learn martial art<br>  5) are u aware that technically you can avoid many fights if you uses some wit over her phyiscal nature|`|QLhuYWmxaa	violence is not the answer unless the question is what is not the answer.  well you could just not fight her and try to be friends. it works for me. and i have a lot more friends because i don't like to fight
70y1Ak9oaa	Ha ha.  Ya.  When i was in 7th a few years ago I definitely acted weird.  Ah, good times, good times.|`|eoXwxq9oaa	Ah... i remember those days..... That time is kind of confusing|`|4909f6c47584b258424324ed86d8da55aa	ummm some r, just dont try to be "cool" just be yourself|`|1aFSnPGVaa	lol, yes. I'm going into eighth grade and believe me.  Seventh graders are very strange.|`|AA11665639	well...yea iim like extremely weird nd iim in seventh gradee|`|AA11784926	Yeah.  Don't get me wrong, I was a seventh grader a few years ago, but even then I thought they were annoying.  It's just the fact that they are teenagers going through the peak of puberty and it's very annoying.|`|xlEJC4w3aa	When I was a seventh grader,  back in 1971, I kept to myself most of the time. I was shy and felt uncomfortable around girls.  At that age, you are starting to develop into someone far different than you were before. Your emotions are developing, your body is developing, at the sametime your brain is trying to deal with all the chemical changes going on.  It's like remodleing a house, with all the changes going on at once.  The old walls being torn down, while the new ones are being put up.  The old kitchen is being ripped apart while someone is putting in the new sink.  <br>  <br>  From the age of 12-18 est.  Your body will be going  through an extreme make over,  from your brain, on the inside, getting new wirering that leads to your heart that needs a new set of emotional clamps that is connected back to your brain telling you how to deal with emotional feelings.  On the outside everything is growing, and you are turning, from a little girl into a beautiful woman.  <br>  <br>  It's like a rose bud.  In the beginning, it is nothing but a green ball on a green stem.  When it is opened, it has turned into a beautiful sweet smelling rose, of such beauty, just like you are right now......God Bless You and stay safe....|`|13BlMEEGaa	um... i'm a 7th grader....i'm weird...my friends are weird heck even my teacher is weird.... so yeah i guess they are lol but not all people are the same...<br>  <br>  also it depend what your definition of weird is......if you mean poking farts out of random people, then laughing for an hour straight then.... yes if you mean running around like a crazy person while giggling with your pants off then..no lol|`|6XPIcwhSaa	all of the ones I know seem to be.....but that doesn't mean<br>  that all of them are<br>  most are still getting rid of the weirdness from the 6th grade<br>  but there are those that never seem to lose it<br>  everyone can be at times though, you just have to find the <br>  right people to accept yours|`|9HPUzoJRaa	no, you are a 7th grader.  all you have to do is grow up a little like everyone else on the planet your age.  its not wierd, its actually about as normal as it gets|`|BJqdeybxaa	yes..... all of em....even me when i was in seventh i think its the wierdest point in your whole pre teen/teenage years|`|GLNhrdt9aa	i just got out of middle school and everyone is weird, there are a lot of fights,crying and drama so ya but it is just cuz of hormones<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i think ; )|`|waIx6MmPaa	Um, pretty much everyone in Middle School.<br>  <br>   Everyone just going through puberty, there's a lot of hormones running through the air. It gets a bit better when you enter High School but you won't really notice until your Junior year or so. :p|`|yxgvaeAtaa	yeahhh mann. we seventh graders are some weeirrddd kids. <br>  <br>  =P
tFMTBbBnaa	hi, I'd say I am nice, sweet, and sometimes defensive|`|gflGkFyxaa	i dont know her
AA10974923	it depends if ppl trust her...but probably soon...i mean if its a neighborhood that trust her and all that then she could probably easily get a babysitting job...|`|w1NmAW2naa	I am a guy and I started baby sitting at the same age so I think that her age is fine to start out.
AA12341414	No matter what, be yourself. That way you always know that the friends that you have love you for who you are, not for something you are trying to be.|`|7iLLQa6daa	be free to every one dont hide any thing. i mean u can talk false but dont try to hide so ppl take it easy in a manner to contribute towards ur gratitude anyways take care of privacy :)|`|FgjQrCkcaa	hi, listen, you need to be very selective in making friends, cause you don't know what type of person is & with whome you are talking, firstly you need to make some difference while making friendship, don't trust easily to anyone. Just find someone who sounds good to you in all aspects. Every one has certain criteria for any decisions in life. You should also have certain things and goals about your life. While making friends, you just need to careful and observant. When you find that particular person is okay then you can go ahead later on for friendship with him or her. Just be careful. Hope you understand me correctly.... If you feel, i can be your friend. I am also looking for some good friend. I am 32 years old guy from India, by profession i am a graphic designer. Thanks, take care and have fun|`|Xtoq93dyaa	be yourself. dont think wat other people say. just be urself!|`|ihx0faFBaa	be good to others, treat everyone with respect.
zIvOhBJ4aa	well...I have a lot of guy friends, and some guys are just like that. They flirt w/everyone and are real players. I would ask him if he likes you... It's not that hard, and if he's doing all the things your saying he is, and flirts with you more than other girls, then chances are he does. If he's the player kind of guy just make sure to be careful about it. You don't want to get hurt or lose a close friend. I hope everything works out!!|`|g4dXklCSaa	i think your guy is a bit of a creep- with all that staring and stuff. But if you think he's too-good-to-be-true, watch him with other girls and see if he does the same with them. <br>  but if you really like him, why not give him a hug once in a while? <3|`|r8YesG3caa	The fact that he's staring so much at you means that he is at least somewhat interested in you. I don't know  why he plays with your hair. Maybe he just likes the feel of it. I read somewhere that lions play with each other's mane before mating with each other. I'm not sure if you can apply that to humans, but it's possible.  Why don't you ask him if he likes you?
QLhuYWmxaa	well this dude came up behind me and was all "hi beautiful" and he put his arms around me. but the thing was, i didn't know  him, and his hands were in a place that they shouldn't be so i turned around and kicked him so hard his eyes were watering. it turned out that he thought i was his gf (because i looked like her) and yes i would do it again if i had to.|`|Igeu0OZQaa	yes i have.. i dont remember.|`|nSBiMAAsaa	this one time at band camp some guy tryed to stick his flute in my fanny so i kick him in da balls as hard as i could and yes i would do it again<br>  <br>  true story no joke!!!!|`|AA11869097	Well, this one time me and my boyfriend were wrestling, and I pushed him on the bed and got on top of him and he started choking me and so I kneed him in the balls twice... I felt bad after... but he was choking me!
JHVcIeYAaa	My guess would be he is trying to hook up. If he wanted to get to know you more or try to start a relationship, he would call at other times, not just after he has left the club. Alcohol may be a factor..maybe he is a little buzzed and a little 'lonely.'|`|AA12095283	Would probably be trying to get you into something more comfortable.Like the nude
qXJAvbxOaa	yes|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Sure, <br>  <br>  It's not just the wrapping .... it's the person she is, her feelings, her beliefs, her life plan ...... there needs to be more than just a pretty smile ... thats what makes the sale!|`|rgZa805maa	It depends.... Middle eastern women have some very strange traits..... like all the wrappings, you cant even see thier face!!!!<br>  <br>  I know thier all from a Male dominated country but i mean common your in america, leave them at home..<br>  <br>  But in reality i find very few middle eastern women attractive, very few...<br>  <br>  But they are some of the nicest people i have ever met!
3m0EwdnKaa	Of course you are not a bum. You are just like everyone else having your struggles. I think you may being too hard on yourself and that makes you think others are looking down on you. Probably no one sees you as inadequate at all, but you are afraid they do or that they will. Just do your best. That is all anyone has the right to expect from anyone else.|`|AA10279086	Haku, there are many jobs out there for the disabled. Govt sponsored agencies help the disabled every day find jobs to sustain their own existance. Govt. stats show that 90% of family home businesses fail. So why stick around for the "Titanic" to sink. Get your own job and let Big Bro (the captain goes down with the ship not the swab or first mate) Make a life for yourself . Now, GO DO IT  and don't look back|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	If your feeling like no one cares ... test it .... stop doing what your doing....when the acts you do become a issue then they will apreaciate you ..... be your self .... doing for family who like what you provide ... then you have it made, if they don't ... you need to make some changes.|`|CB85sH5Uaa	Just stay positive, it'll work out.  Don't worry.|`|Ve22Y4k8aa	I think u really need to voice out ur feeling to your family,that way they'll know how u feel and maybe u'll get to know what they feel about u.don't keep it all to urself..share it with ur family,no amtter how bad it seems,they're still ur family.<br>  <br>  please don't feel bad for being disabled,try to join any society for the disabled,maybe u'll get to share ur feellings with people in same condition with u.<br>  <br>  try to read or find out stories about people who are disabled but still can achieve well in life..hope this'll help u.
ENjjDQGQaa	WELL I ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE YOU ARE... IF YOU TOO ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AND SEE EYE TO EYE THAN IT WORTH A TRY... BUT YOU WILLNEVER KNOW UNLESS YOU GIVE IT A TRY.... YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT REGRET IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD THE WHAT IFS...I WOULD BECOME FRIENDS FIRST AND SEE HOW THAT GOES NO STRINGS ATTACHED .. GO IN IT WITH AN OPENMIND AND A OPEN HEART!!!|`|365d373a940910e9630530b11e0feaa8aa	only if you think you might get  some ..|`|QEz0IaHwaa	go for it! just because there is distance between you now..if it works out and is meant to be, you can move closer to each other!|`|jAwjlyJWaa	It is worth a shot, but you just have to remember that it is very hard to maintain a serious relationship when you can't see eachother all the time. It usually leads to people accusing the other of cheating or other things because you are not around all the time to show otherwise. It does work out for some people it just takes a lot of trust and work to keep it going.|`|brcmNA6faa	100 miles apart is nothing. That's like what, less than 2 hours drive time? I know people who commute to work for longer than that, and I bet they're not as happy as you'd be to see your girl!|`|f6dUmL1yaa	this is a tough one.  It sounds like there could be potential, but it's different when you know a person and then you have to be apart rather than getting invovled with someone who lives miles away from the beginning.  I don't think it's a good idea because long distance relationships are already hard enough and to begin with that will make it all the more frustrating.  Try to meet some people around where you live and if you truly feel like there are no good people around you, then at least you know you can still be set up.  But give it a try with the people who live in your area first.  Good luck!|`|7d70bf0ac15b143f2312b1757e230af8aa	I'd go on the date.  If you both have a great time, you will both have to work to keep it alive.  Maybe one of you will be willing to relocate.  You never know.  This could be your one shot at true love!  Don't blow it away!|`|MOALoKWdaa	u got a 50 50 shot at this.....u may like her or u may not and it goes the other way around......
53b195eedf30cc5b07cf6d2cf4cf9c34aa	NEVER, i say NEVER give in. life is gonna be this tough, and i will tell you straight out, people say smack and talk trash. never give up! stick to what you believe and stay true to it. do not let this girl N intimidate you and interfere you and your other friends. if your friends are TRULY your friends, they would always stick wtih you always. if they leave you, then you know it was wrong to be their friend.but i tell you right now, do not give up!|`|JaXDb1mhaa	yes friends are there for you but if they gonna ruin your life with their " what they think you have said which not true" i call them not friends . so i think you have done the best thing and you should be proud by your self so good on you and remember there is lots people to meet and know some of them are true friends :)|`|T70uKoCmaa	yeah  yeahyeah whastr eever|`|aWh5ZL34aa	Is okae to let your friend go as i also once encounter such a problem like you. She is not fit to be your friend at all. just let what had happen go and start making new friends. Let the past vanish. keep smiling and make new friends.|`|s0uS5Phgaa	YES! It was ok to let go! If she were a real friend, she wouldn't have believed all that stuff 'N' has said so readily! If she were a real friend, she'd talk things over or tell you how she feels or something. You'll find better friends or people, so it's okay! (And you should ask for the boots back :D)|`|y7ityDu1aa	Well if the results of letting go was good..then you made the right decision. If the results are bad, then try to list down or try remembering the thing you did wrong.ü<br>  <br>  hope this helps regarding to your problem.ü
AA11256453	Send them a card that says what you want it to.|`|6bfb56d42625b46bdf417638ea599e24aa	.. as a friend.  That's important.  If you go out and say that you want to be more than friends, nothing will be the same and you might very well lose a friend.  But, as for your question.  Instead of telling them, why not show them?|`|46e673ed4a09ebaa7ae3649ea33cfc71aa	JUST HINT AT IT JOKINGLY BUT SUGGESTIVELY AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY IF THE RESPONSE IS GOOD THEN GO FOR IT...OR JUST COME STRAIGHT OUT AND SAY LOOK I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT US BEING TOGETHER THEN GO FROM THERE|`|UoTW0m8uaa	you could send them a card expressing the way you feel or by them a very special gift and then without you saying it they''ll know the way you feel.|`|jJX91udMaa	Most of the people thinks love is one sided <br>  but most of the time it is both sided<br>  u cannot love one who not cares u<br>  you have to tell if you love someone<br>  dont wait for other to tell u<br>  u may loose
3MjZ2Mzbaa	Nope.|`|569b52e9f2702299d9ac9e8475574e6baa	No, no, no.  No matter what she looks like nobody has a right to cross that line and take what is not theirs to take.|`|q3u36YDMaa	No. Just because she's making herself even more alluring to the soon-to-be rapist, it is still his CHOICE to act on his impulses or not. Yes, if she were dressed more conservatively, she might not have been raped, but she wasn't. It's not like she was literally asking the guy to rape her. She just wanted attention from the guys, but unfortunately she got more than she bargained for.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	no. rape it the fault of the person who violated the other. it doesn't matter if if the girl dressed $luty. good day^^|`|pdtBgXUuaa	Not really her fault but girls like that usually put themselves in really dumb situations anyone with any type of smarts would know is bad...|`|w1N2WviSaa	absolutely not. it's never the girl's fault. the guy does the raping. it's his fault and there are no excuses whatsoever for it.|`|309c29f412eb63364ed12f133f1cc9baaa	Its NEVER a girls fault is she was raped. Why the hell would you ask that?|`|yORIALGhaa	Not really. I mean it's the gut that is the perve. BUT she is putting herself out there. and when u dress like a slut u normally are saying "hey everyone look at me. u want to go do it? i got a hotel room."
de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	I'll take the money,|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Not this lame question again!|`|6XBB0wtMaa	C) i take it all, plus your home & your points, so you'd stop trplling !!|`|83c0fc3c9d1bea396e5d9e652a50b4b8aa	you would be walking out of there naked....$100 richer...but hey, its only money- I can always make more!!!|`|91b8bd7dcb7f20d9dbddb636a06c5227aa	Receiving one hundred dollars in a poker game to an adult is nothing.  Since I am an adult tho I wouldn't send you out naked either.<br>  Are you calling the $100 a high stake game. lol<br>  I would dress you up in girls clothing and take you to the mall!<br>  The clothing would be a dress and pantyhose with a pair of mud boots.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	hhhmmmm....both good prizes...i think you would have to go home with out any cloths. money is everywhere but that would be priceless.|`|6vIlKIueaa	i would take all of your clothes, socks,and have you do the run of shame totally naked for 2 blocks at noon. I'd also drive my car while you ran and take pictures so then you could play me again so i could take your money. haha|`|YZUoBYLvaa	Your butt would be doing the streak!|`|iAfPbFr3aa	If you lost, suck it up! Dont be a sore loser ... pay the one hundred dollars with a smile on your face! Plus running naked 2 blocks to your house is embarassing...
QLhuYWmxaa	i used to have a friend named kitty, then she moved. i like that name =)|`|ETXGpBBjaa	Here!  KITTY-KITTY-KITTY-KITTY!!!!|`|BGurXG8Yaa	I'm not Kitty
QLhuYWmxaa	i like brown hair blue eyes because blond hair and blue eyes are soooo common|`|ORS4HBnNaa	I don't care either way!|`|2ce3a92c7c87ad535ba6a0fb888b29f3aa	I like brown eyes brown hair on a guy, its whatever YOU are into!!|`|RpfpOBGZaa	I prefer redhair and green eyed women.....|`|bVCyGQTNaa	Both are great combos... on guys OR girls!
QLhuYWmxaa	umm I've never heard of that being flirting but anything is possible. have a nice night =)|`|weadibPeaa	for sure it does... it sounds childish but just about any action where a guy goes out of his way to touch a girl is flirting, like in sixth grade..(this includes kicking, tackling, poking etc...)|`|74e779f1008c4e33ef027f41ab899b34aa	yep thats what it means.  I kno, i do it sometimes.|`|J3cozXMNaa	Sounds like a jerk If he IS flirting, probably isn't worth your time.|`|vZW2SMoZaa	You'd think it would, but one guy I know does that all the time to me, and I've been told he's interested in someone else. It's a possibility that he's just very friendly. Which means that he could be flirting. In a friendly way. <br>  <br>  So, yes.
1SHwZDL1aa	uhh yesssss. just get up the courage for that half a second that it takes to say "yes".|`|FrFHEl29aa	i tell them they need to ask my girlfriend. if she say yes then.....|`|0df8e013e98b23f86a9340ea223070ffaa	You say Yes or your say No. Be direct but polite, remember that nothing hurts more than mixed signals, girls have it easier usually since its usually the guy that has to bust his balls to get the courage to ask someone out. <br>  <br>  Also dont think for a moment that because noone has asked you out that you must be somehow ugly or something like that, at that age there has been probably dozens of boys who have had a crush on you but never mustered the courage to actually ask you out.|`|8Mh165d1aa	Wait so boys have asked you out that are "hot" and you don't know what to say, yet you want a boyfriend? How bout saying yes? Does it get any more simple?|`|JrDs3XuBaa	Well, if you want to go out with the guy who asks you, then say yes.  But if you feel that you aren't ready for a relationship, or that you don't want one (and wanting one just because everyone else has one isn't a really good idea), then say no.  But, if you're saying no, be nice about it.  If they just want to go on a date, then you can always go: you might end up making an awesome new friend.  One date doesn't mean you're an item.|`|v20UIEhlaa	If they ask you out, and you like them, just say yes. Don't be nervous because you'll give them mixed signals. They might think you're not interested. Let them know you are. If you don't like the guy, politely tell him you'd rather be friends. Good luck! : )|`|zWx1J8Cnaa	I dont understand you. Could you explain why you are so afraid?
3rIX5qbvaa	Hun, he was caring. Head is to give the man pleasure, by sucking on their.............u know, genitals. And plz stop reposting this question, this is like the 13th time.|`|IWnOtGV6aa	You must be really young. Because you can't possibly be an adult. Think about it. If you have to ask yourself, then you already know the answer. Of course he was manipulating you. And what do you mean what was the purpose of head? If you have these types of questions, maybe you're not ready to be having sex.|`|UFP8uil9aa	he really cared about you!!!! Dang!!! the head was so when he ejaculates it won't go into your vagina and get you pregnant, duh!|`|QLhuYWmxaa	he really cared and stop asking this! it gets annoying (no offense but it had to be said)|`|tbWZDhdlaa	how old were you the first time you had sex?
QLhuYWmxaa	wow dude. way too desperate.|`|TF3FDSYqaa	wrong web site stupid|`|ZNWXg61yaa	lalalalala...
G2xRQ8Mtaa	I know this has been very hard for you. But maybe he isn't responding to you for a reason. Either he doesn't want to lead you on in any way by you thinking he likes you or he doesn't want you to get in trouble for the 2 of you communicating. What I would do is, pull him aside the next time you see him, make sure no parents are around, and talk 2 him about how you feel.<br>  Hopefully it works out for you =]|`|c46db6f03e1a99b94e6a53d48b612dc8aa	Classic Romeo and Juliet...<br>  In case you havent read the story,,, both die...<br>  Therefore no...He hasn't replied therefore he doesn't like you ..hard truth but indeed needs to be said.. <br>  So yea... Live life...
QLhuYWmxaa	but of course! it doesn't matter how tall you are but how personable you are. have a nice day=)|`|TV7Q7hmBaa	Why not?  There are club groups for tall people, and the entry height for women is somewhere around 5' 10" so check that out.  Look around the women's basketball courts, there are lots of tall women and they are looking for taller men.  If you need to drop a few pounds, do so and get on with it, after all, when you do find the right woman, you want to live a healthy life.  Try some singles groups, public dances and just get out and mingle, people have friends who know other tall folks, so<br>  take some action.   Best wishes|`|AA11244014	Most women like Bigger men so of course!|`|ca3a7553944af0993820647f5ac07c66aa	well yeah, be sure to tell women if u talk to them on the phone or on line how tall u are/ weight. so they wont be disappointed when you 2 meet. actual size /height shouldnt matter, it should count for the kind of person u are on the inside.
6cqClYO9aa	I see you more like a miss Utah or something- not a model.<br>  <br>  You're pretty- you just don't look like that is something that you would be enough in. I get this vibe from looking at your picture- that you are outgoing and it isn't all about looks for you. Go for your passion- not just because the word modeling has been thrown out a bunch of times and you meet the height and weight standards.|`|AA10935363	Of course you can be a model, sweetie. You definitely have the look, but the only way to know for sure is to have a professional photographer put together a portfolio for you so you can approach some modeling agencies to see if you truly qualify. MAKE SURE that your mom or dad is involved in the process so you don't get taken advantage of by unscrupulous men--because they're out there. Good luck and be careful.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	go for it! your totally pretty. you could totally pull it off. good luck=)|`|fCF7tZ4qaa	you should have no problem becoming a model, perfect height, weight and a very beautiful face, your skin is flawless... you should go for it...|`|Aflhea5Zaa	Your really pretty. But I would try to tan my face a little more cause you look a little pale. Also in the pictures in my opinion your face looks too barbie'ish. Take off your makeup and show your beautiful skin!!<br>  Good luck!|`|WHzbtBh7aa	Go for it!|`|jkHs6Bi7aa	I don't konw about model. BUt i would hook up with you. But than again , i'm a model so i'm better than you.|`|kf6oeSEHaa	Go for it girl! You have the looks and the assests!|`|kodlulcZaa	i think you should try adult movies|`|NpcSEJX1aa	check teem mag and see if they have any contest you can enter.. also try beauty pagent.. i know a girl that got into modeling that way... are there any agents in your area.. if not get a few pictures together.. some color and some black and white and find a agency on the web.. one that you have seen there name in mag.. like teen mag.. and seen them the pictures.. see what they say..do a lot of research before you start sending people pictures of your self..|`|CSgpDAnSaa	You have beautiful eyes :]<br>  But to me, modeling is just plain slutty.
6xGT2IY8aa	Finally one of you have figured it out. Congratulations. Women, take notice of this and knock off all your incessant chatter and nagging on and on about crap.|`|bVgFCPBAaa	From a guy's perspective, I could see it.  If you push - a lot of guys will withdraw, but if you back off a little, a lot of guys will come closer.  That's how I am any way.  I don't need someone nagging me around all the time - it's a big turn-off really.|`|fCF7tZ4qaa	yes I'm sure it did, you put more trust and faith in him and he is responding to that.. good for you...|`|QLhuYWmxaa	i agree with Pistons in da house but i would have sugar coated it. once we stop talking on and on and on the relationship gets better. good luck with your bf =)
fRKBGhW8aa	just tell him..i'm pretty sure he'll change...if he likes u alot he'll change....if he responds negatively...kick him 2 the curb!!!!|`|nMQ3Vdtoaa	i know what u mean, mine can be girly sometimes too. but i love it! it just means that it gives me something more in common with him. if it really bothers, tell him how u feel and if it still bothers u, maybe it just wasn't meant to be
QLhuYWmxaa	well like me she probably doesn't want to say it because she feels that she might get hurt if she does. a lot of the times when a guy says (and in no way am i trying to label or say that all men do this) i love you its just to get in her pants. or maybe she doesn't want to get hurt. like my uncle, he got his heart broken by the love of his life, and it took him YEARS to say it to another woman. (my aunt) good luck with her^^|`|ORS4HBnNaa	I have to agree with the first answer.
rZtzzliraa	OH YES UMAGA IS A BEAST! LOL <br>  <br>  YA U PROBABLY HAVE DRY LIPS|`|TZinjDjOaa	well I'm not a doctor or anything but it could mean that your lips were really dry and he might have kissed you kinda hard and his lips were dry to..kinda like sand paper on sand paper..next time use a little chap stick and they shouldn't bleed..good luck!|`|xtFbO4upaa	how are we supposed to know why...its your lip...they probably are discustingly dry..get some chapstick..gross|`|QLhuYWmxaa	eeeewww! umaga is not...ewwwww now I'm going to have nightmares. <br>  <br>  about your lips. are they chapped beyond reason? that could be why, but who knows.

Aha. Anyway..when you are at your side..and so is that other person.<br>  <br>  Either that, or its a war using spoons as your weapons.|`|CVfcSNc1aa	You lay on your side with your knees slightly bent.  Your lover lays on his side and puts his crotch right up against your butt.  He doesn't penetrate you, you just lay there together like spoons in a drawer, cuddling.<br>  <br>  Can you picture that?|`|MDVVEFoNaa	when a ppl lay down to have sex, and the guy is behinde other person and has anal sex|`|XvSKkIFXaa	spooning is when two people are laying on their sides in the same direction. pretty much cuddling/being close to someone with or without clothes. <br>  I hope that helps.
QLhuYWmxaa	for a day sure, for the rest of forever,no sorry. id like to see what its like to be a dude. they all have less predeceases agents them. (not that they don't have some but less then women) and to show a dude that it isn't easy to be a girl. have a nice day =)|`|baWhoYq4aa	Nope.  I am super happy with who I am.  I could do without some of the issues that come with being a girl, but other than that, I'm great.

Take out the engagement ring and show it to her and say "Will you marry me?" Either she will say yes or no. I can't believe you dont even know how to propose to a woman!! Didnt you watch movies??|`|c8dd01d209703d71e940ca64cefcf15eaa	Well there are a few things you could do but if i was going to purpose to my bf i would take him to his fav. place and do it there infront of everyone.

ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	If you live in the US....<br>  <br>  You can't do it without Dad's permission until you're 18.  I can’t offer suggestions on how to get his permission, because speaking as a parent, there is NO WAY I'd give my minor daughter permission to move in with her boyfriend.  In addition to not being an appropriate living environment for a minor (and that’s how CPS would classify it too!), there could be legal repercussions as well.<br>  <br>  I was actually kind of admiring your desire to work and earn your own money, right up until this...."I tried working at jobs that were close to my house but i found reasons to quit each of them".  That's where you lost me.<br>  <br>  On your 18th birthday, you can move out.|`|9kB3xQrFaa	So my question to you is that if you can stay in school and get a job and a car living with your boyfriend then why can't you do this while living at home???  <br>  <br>  You are too young to live with your boyfriend and you have already quit several jobs.  You need to do some serious growing up and your Dad knows this.|`|ZwdIwRB3aa	How old are you?|`|zFKkIBK8aa	First of all, I can tell that your boyfriend is too old for you.<br>  <br>  You had a job and quit it, that is your fault.  Don't blame the fact that you're living with mom & dad.  Be grateful that you are, you don't have to pay for housing, food, clothes, etc.  You are a spoiled brat.  You could buy whatever you wanted if you could keep a job.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is using you.  Why can't he get a car?  Why do you need one to "drop him off?"<br>  <br>  Everyone wants to move out of their house before they turn 18.  I did, but then I realized that that would be the stupidest thing ever.  Why pay for housing and food when you could get it for free?  There are jobs near your house, get one, stick it out, make money, buy a car, and then you can decide what to do.<br>  <br>  AND GO TO COLLEGE!  Don't think that getting a minimum wage job in high school and then buying a car and moving in with some 20-something year old guy is "real life."  Cuz it ain't.  You can do more than that.  Stop taking your easy life for granted.|`|AA11503396	Wait until you're 18 and there's nothing he can do. If you had jobs in the past, why did you leave them? U just said you needed one. There are people out there that are looking for jobs and would really appreciate them. It sounds to me that you are a little spoiled and trying to grow up too fast. Fininsh school, go on to college and get you a goob job and THEN worry about moving out.
QLhuYWmxaa	i don't sleep with people, period. if a guy says he loves me he loves me for me not the things he can gain from it. and if he really oves me he'd wait. and I'm a very spontaneous person so its not hard to keep a relationship fresh =)|`|6dbc9cd7237e377323cc1f8fc0156f49aa	There's all kinds of way to have sex with him without even touching him. Think about it.|`|73GLuk20aa	You take it slow and avoid it by finding something else to do and have your realtionship meaningful.

xMnEcOD5aa	If you don't have a boyfriend yet, then God probably wants it that way.<br>  <br>  Don't arouse or awaken love until it so desires.|`|c85ec030efea1af8ff8b360f8e6e9d81aa	I dont see why you`re in such a hurry.<br>  <br>  You don`t have to have a bf, if there isnt anyone one decent around.|`|ABGyw3nraa	Easy does it. No hurry cuz boyz will come soon enuf.|`|ceNvYOU6aa	Tell a boy you like him. Then invite him over when your parents are gone,|`|vxz2lx7Paa	whats the rush? you are just in high school. find one when you reach college. <br>  there is no ways to make someone like you. if some is going to like you, he will approach to you, get your number, invite you to go out with him, and so on....<br>  once u have a bf, there will be a lot to do, its just better to finish up high school and not get into relationship in such a rush...
Q2Ng2bOoaa	Women are crazy simple as that.|`|GtdTV2qSaa	If you're getting married, to a girl it means the world because you want everyone you love - family and friends - to see it happen. Which means you'll do anything and everything for them. I don't personally thing spending over 30,000 is the greatest thing in the world... I actually would like a small wedding, but yeah. <br>  <br>  If your talking about just being married period, than, it's just so that there's a promise for forever.|`|UdA4WCaNaa	probably cuz its one of the most important days in there life|`|YpPmruXraa	the wedding day is a joyish day and an woman would want it to be as perfect as it can. if you are getting married and really love this chick then just stay woth it and after the wedding you will be glad you did if you dump her now you will wast a lot of money and youw ould reget it.<br>  <br>  big tim3|`|flH8FrAWaa	Hmmmm, I guess its because its one of those important days...like giving birth to their child(but that's more important). Not all women are crazy about wedding day. Some do like a quiet wedding and some rather not have a wedding at all.|`|kUEHl1fKaa	No one said having a big wedding means that it's more important than their relationship. In fact, I think it's quite the opposite. <br>  <br>  A wedding is a time for friends and family to celebrate the love between two people. To share in the moment where two lives become one. When two people dedicate themselves to eachother forever. <br>  <br>  It means so much to girls because we spend our lives waiting for that special person to enter our lives and once we've found him, we just want the biggest celebration possible!! It's not a center of attention thing (with most girls). I think we just want to look and feel our best on such a special occasion.|`|leKJp4TIaa	I am getting married in two weeks and it's all I can think about! However, I have not spent thousands and thousands of dollars (I actually have enjoyed finding wedding bargains) and being the center of attention is the last thing on my mind. I just can't wait to walk down the aisle and finally marry the love of my life!<br>  I do, however, understand that some girls never get to be the center of attention and their wedding day is the one time that can happen for them. I don't think that this is being shallow. <br>  <br>  why are guys so hung up on sports? they spend hundreds of dollars on tickets and have to be surrounded by thousands of people. does this make them bad? <br>  (I really love sports, I'm just trying to make my point)<br>  men have things they look forward to just like women :)|`|lyORD1JZaa	No, not all of them are so shallow.<br>  <br>  But it's something a lot of us have grown up fantasizing about. It's a pretty important day.<br>  And there is a BIG bridal industry telling engaged girls what they HAVE to have at their wedding. So for some people it has become a bit of a circus. But it doesn't have to be that way. I watch Bridezillas and these women act outlandishly - but maybe I would too, if Lifetime was footing the bill for my honeymoon in Jamaica!|`|z3HlMSnYaa	i don't think it's shallow to want a nice wedding. most girls just want it to be special because its one of the most important days in a girls life

Sé como tu eres y como te sientas más cómoda y empieza a cambiar tu perspectiva sobre el tema y piensa que lo encontrarás como todo el mundo.

Me alegro que te sientas bien contigo misma y que seas de esas personas que saben expresar lo que siente, no me pareces ridícula ni cursi, lo digo por algunos que te dijeron groserías, sino más bien alguien que siente y sabe decirlo sin temor a ser insultada o que piensen mal, los amargados y los que no han conocido el amor, seguramente pensarán que eres cursi y otras cosas más, pero tú disfruta y no les hagas caso. <br>  <br>  Saludos y espero que ese amor te dure. :)
m2zvAaHpaa	My opinion, for what it's worth:<br>  <br>  You've got the makings of, if not the fact of, an abuser and a stalker. Run, don't walk, away from this man. You should break up with him, and you should be afraid.<br>  <br>  Step 1. boost up your personal support network, and any security arrangements you have or can make. Is there a friend you could stay with if you had to? Someone who could stay with you for a while? Do you live alone, or do you have roommates? Give it some thought, because even though you probably won't need it, you may - and it's not something you want to have to invent as you go. I'm not trying to scare you here, but... I guess I am a little. I can tell you already take it seriously, so not much more to say there.<br>  <br>  Step 2. practice. Use your own words, script it out, whatever it takes to get the script down in a way that you can say it and be firm. You need to control the outcome of the situation by telling him how it will be and enforcing it. You say you've tried to break up with him, but remember: it takes two to continue a relationship, but only one to end it. You've decided to end it, so it ends - plain and simple. His reaction, his temper, his cajoling, his stalking, his insistence... NONE of that is your responsibility. Picture yourself saying your script to him and enforcing it. On that note, do NOT continue the back and forth that he's trapping you into. Every time you let him bust your boundary by cajoling you into changing your actions, you teach him that his two year old tantrums work - he got what he wanted! I'm assuming he's not changing your mind - just your actions. If I'm wrong about that, ignore this entire answer, because it doesn't apply to you.<br>  <br>  Step 3. do it. Soon. The longer you wait, the worse it gets; you already know that's true, because you've seen how he escalates his tantrums each time.<br>  <br>  Step 4. celebrate when it's done. Seriously, this is important, because it will reinforce in your own mind the permanence of it, and THIS IS WORTH CELEBRATING. It's the end of a very sick "us" and the start of a healthy "you". Besides, who needs an excuse to celebrate?|`|Y6vUny4yaa	RED FLAG RED FLAG....those are some classic signs of a potential abuser.

b1a0c3511cc75dc4d8024897991b2465aa	Principessa:<br>  <br>  Ojos que no ven, corazòn que no siente. Mi ex-esposa, que me fué totalmente infiel, dijo en alguna ocasión a sus amigas de correrías (otras mujeres casadas desde luego): ....Pongo las manos en el fuego por FULANO (o sea yo)... pensando que yo sí le era fiel. El secreto estriba en que aceptes en un momento determinado de tu vida que eres debil, humana, y con apetitos que deben ser calmados, si no que saciados. Si hubieses ido un manequí (como los de las tiendas de ropa de mujer) tendrìas todas las formas de una mujer pero carecerías de lo más importante para ser mujer, por lo tanto no se puede negar la naturaleza de cada quien. Un@s nacimos con debilidades pero con capacidad de no dejar que se sepa y otr@s tienen programado su termostato para encender a temperaturas muy elevadas y estos son quienes tiene mas capacidad para la "fidelidad", por que tardan tanto en "encender" que hasta tienen tiempo de enfiarse nuevamente sin llegar al límite de la tentación. Es mucho mas cosa de la "bilirrubina" y de la cantidad con que te surtieron tus genes, que de control mental. Cuando la "carne es debil".....no hay problema, pero cuando si lo hay....se te pone dura la cosa!!!!!..... <br>  <br>  Hablando en serio, lo que debes entender es que no es punible ni pecado, solo tienes que ser discreta cuando tu nivel de resistencia es muy bajo. Ni tampoco podemos ponerle una estrellita a quienes no les resulta conflictivo el hecho de poder aguantarse, ya que pueden ser dos cosas; 1) o como dije antes, son "icebergs" muy controlados en ese<br>  sentido o 2) todavía no les llega la horma de su zapato..<br>  <br>  Solo te puedo aconsejar que si tienes una pareja que te es infiel y deseas POR VENGANZA serlo tú también, entonces estarás denigrándote a ti misma.Es más honesto contigo mismo hacerlo cuando te viene por el deseo que sientes por otra persona. No te atormentes. Haz lo que te dicte tu corazón, esto es, cuando lo puedas hacer sin sentirte miserable, si no, mejor ni lo intentes por nada del mundo. Respeto por ti misma ante todo.

CF6AlaD8aa	Hola Vicente!!!<br>  <br>  Parece que estuvieras describiendo una larga páginade mi vida... Esto es triste y difícil de asimilarlo, yo adoraba a esa persona, le creí y realmente lo amé más que a mi vida, y de repente sentí que un hermoso detalle de cristal se rompía en mil pedacitos delante de mis ojos sin poder hacer nada..es una decepción bien grande, piensas que numca te recuperarás, pero el tiempo vá haciendo su trabajo poquito a poco, y es un proceso muy largo, lloras mucho, te deprimes, pero sabes que ese ser no es el único en el mundo y sabes que tu vida continúa y no puedes quedarte estancado en ese episodio.. Yo después de dos meses es que empiezo a levantarme y no ha sido nada fácil pero cuando escucho los comentarios que se dicen de ese hombre y lo mediocre que es siento mucha pena y lástima de él porque ni se imagina todo lo que está perdiendo por su mediocridad...<br>  <br>  Recibe un fuerte abrazo de mi parte y ánimo que saldremos de ésta triste etapa de nuestras vidas, son experiencias y debemos aprender y sacar lo mejor de ella...|`|3bErSoGLaa	No, fue algo diferente, como si cuando estaba enamorada estuviera miope y al quitarseme ese sentimiento lo veo tal cual es, casi un orangutan y me pregunté: me gustaba pero si está horrible?|`|UD0TM2gsaa	pues no exactamente lo mismo, pero un caso parecido andar con un tipo que afortunadamente a tiempo me di cuenta que era un bueno para nada, un caso dificil de creer de un tipo pero al igual facil de olvidar pues no significo tanto, solo que si te pone a pensar tu conciencia de que hubiera pasado si le hubieras seguido el juego, estarias en una desagradable situación.... y que lastima que tal vez una persona que idolatraste y amaste pudiera caer tan bajo eso es lo unico que sentiria.. jeje|`|dvmJnJUVaa	No no me ha pasado, ahora me encuentro casada, deje a mi ex por andar con el que ahora es mi pareja, y se por varia gente que la ha pasado muy mal, y de cierta manera me causa dolor, pues el no se merece sufrir por nadie y menos por alguien como yo que no lo valoro, a veces me pregunto que hubiera sido de nosotros si seguriamos juntos.<br>  Si a ti te paso que bueno que te diste cuenta a tiempo que no valia la pena seguir con una persona asi, y si como dices duele, pero todo es cuestion de que aceptes y veas las cosas mejor!!|`|m3D1ImwFaa	me huele a q sigues queriendola solo  q no lo aceptas, en fin, si me ha pasado pero , no me arrepiento de lo vivido aun si fuera malo me sirvio de experiencia y lo bailado nadie me lo quita, porq en su momento me quisieron demasiado y eso se agradece de los caballeros, y no me gusta recordar a mis ex en mala onda, sea por lo q se haya terminado, solo los recuerdos bonitos cuentan.|`|022cf62903fd09fba46765cc05865ca6aa	NO..PERO. CREO QUE FUE LO MEJOR QUE TE HA PASADO EN TU VIDA.|`|2MtBhuDgaa	casi,nollegue a casarme pero vivimos muchos a?os y ahora lo veo todo desmejorado claro la del dinero era yo y cuando terminamos pues tambien los lujos que tenia y de verdad si que siento un alivio de no estar con el y pena por la que esta a su lado|`|58239f35a313c254ddcf18aef495b440aa	no me ha pasado algo parecido, pero si pensaste eso, bien por ti, lograste superar ese dolo tan grande que te dio|`|81J0eHdiaa	!!guau!!se ve que esta persona fue importante para ti y ademas te lastimo mucho, pero mira la vida como es........ahora te sientes afortunado de no haber proseguido con ella, quiere decir que superaste lo que sentias por ella, y bueno..........tampoco te burles de su gordura y fodonguez, a ti tambien puede pasarte.|`|TnY3akHNaa	si<br>  <br>  es porque el amor es ciego|`|YYYuvsqLaa	bueno a mi si me a pasado algo parecido y tambien lo he podido superar pero a mi me costo mucho tiempo... pero te felicito por que te hayas alejado de ella por que se nota que no merecia tu cari?o|`|dWohQjzJaa	no me ha pasado, pero k bueno k superast ese mal rato y ya vez las cosas de forma diferent|`|eO22n7TKaa	A mi me paso algo parecido,estba muy muy enamorada de mi pareja,hubiera dado todo por ella,vivia en una nube...<br>  Nunca pense que fuera capaz de dejarme por una companyera de trabajo,suyo,como tantas parejas ahora.<br>  Cuando me lo dijo,ufff!Me queria morir me destrozo la vida,lo pase fatal.<br>  Con el tiempo he canbiado yo no soy la misma nunca mas volvere a serlo.<br>  Ahora soy tan tonta que estoy co él otra vez y me arepiento tanto pero tant de haber vuelo,las segundas partes nunca sonbenas te lo digo por experiencia y aunque duelan.<br>  Si alguien te deja por otra persona es que no esta enamorada de ti y por eso es mejor,borron y cuenta nueva...<br>  El tiempo lo cura todo,aunque de todo se aprende,para algo sirbe pasarlo mal.<br>  Besos|`|Z24iyFRraa	nunca me paso pero seguro que no perdonaria unos CUERNOS,y si se de allegados que las han pasado y si reaccionaron casi todos como tu se sintieron librados de no haber seguido la relacion.Y otros se enteran que al actual le ponen tambien los cuernos y te hace sentir que no fuiste el unico jajajajaj|`|ed2bcc2a65c1010d5125a132e1184111aa	Yes,  men!!   puuuuu.ttta    como sufrì   ca.bròn y lo màs pisa.do que los dos casados, imagìnate hubiera hecho la estupidez de mi vida,  y hoy  por  hoy pienso... donde pisa.dos estarìa ahorita,  comiendo mier.da sin familia, sin nada ni naide a quien recurrir,   pero menos mal ya paso,  ya fuè...  suerte chatillo...|`|ndlGUQN8aa	A migo gracias por eso estoy aqui me esta pasando exactamente lo mismo le di todo y crei que era todo la corte despues de tanto pensarla por que la queria demasiado, me senti mal en la forma en que la corte pasaron dos meses y volvi con ella pero ya no era lo mismo y lo mejor es que ago lo que quiero con ella por que sabe que soy el unico que la agarra en serio, por eso por mas que la maltrato no me deja y si no vale la pena incluso ella sabe que amo a aotra persona y aun asi sigue con migo la dejare en estos dias pero felicidades a ti y a todos los que le a pasado lo mismo por que despues de esetipo de experiencias uno se hace mas fuerte y ya no agarra cualquier vieja por atractiva que este eso es lo bueno de lo malo y uno se fija mas en los sentimientos por algo nos pasan las cosas bagradesco lo que me paso por que me di cuenta que era una perdida paseada etc !espero y encuentren alguien que valga la pena!<br>  y PORFA NO AGAN LO QUE LES HICIERON O SE LE VA A REGRESAR a esas personas infieles y mentirosasles espera lo mismo o algo peor como en el caso de mi novia nomas la agarran para sus necesidades<br>  <br>  FALTA LA MEJOR PARTE QUE TE VEA FELIZ Y EN BUEN ESTADO CON TU PEREJA Y SE AREPIENTA NUEVAMENTE|`|d242c69a06284d001db22d40e58a5a7faa	En el acto la dejo, para que salir con una mina así, mujer del pueblo?.
TnY3akHNaa	gracias|`|uzw6BGdDaa	mama|`|EPOIHFcRaa	Gracias a ti ^^
rE9I9ausaa	You probably shouldn't have told your best friend about what you and your boyfriend did because<br>  <br>  1. What happens between you and your boyfriend should stay there<br>  2. Your best friend likes you<br>  3. Your best friend deeply cares about you<br>  4. Your boyfriend doesn't seem that great<br>  <br>  If you look closely at the situation, you'll see I just might be right.<br>  <br>  You've got a lot of thinking to do.
IMJfFXwOaa	yo soy tan tonta como tu. Yo hice lo mismo, y con lo bien que estaba en mi país calientito y deje mi carrera y mis amigos y me vine a vivir a Inglaterra.|`|HMU1HgLoaa	Con mi pareja yo iría hasta Júpiter!!|`|VdxnOgfBaa	siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, estando a su lado estarìa bien yo|`|jDUJNgbPaa	creo que si<br>  suertee|`|21e545bf6dc6c1e3a3fe97f1384a91caaa	Depende de lo que haya que dejar.|`|M7Gv2yRkaa	Si|`|TnY3akHNaa	solo si estamos mal aqui...ahora que si ella vive en otra parte del mundo..........mmmmmm nose vete a vivir con ella por algun tiempo, y despues te vuelves........al menos hasta que tomes una decision|`|YRopk84daa	Si estoy muy contenta con el ya llevamos 3 a?os vivendo aqui,pero lo hare en un tiempo mas, me cambio de pais. será dificil al principio por el idioma pero voy a estar bien por que ya soy adulto y  pense muy bien las cosas.Te deseo mucha suerte en este cambio.|`|754e8eff1c8e04694476e7c0067a4430aa	Claro, cuando la tienes a ella (o sea a tu pareja) se vuelve tu todo, asi que lo que puedas estar dejando se vuelve nada...|`|IToF0xcBaa	Cuando uno conoce a una persona con la que se siente seguro y piensa que pase lo que pase a su lado vas a estar bien, pienso que si, no significa tampoco abandonar tus sue?os ni dejar de trabajar en todos los ideales que te habías planteado antes de conocerla, pero en mi caso tengo pensado hacerlo, pienso que a veces por no arriesgar perdemos lo que mas amamos y luego nos lamentamos de haber dejado pasar esa oportunidad única de amar sinceramente en la vida.<br>  <br>  Los cambios son dificiles, no se trata solo de vivir juntos, sino de adaptarte a un lugar nuevo, a otro estilo de vida, otras costumbres, adicional a eso a enfrentar una relación de pareja, que de por si no es lo mas sencillo que hay, pero en definitiva si lo haría.

wojfQE62aa	Albi, me parece que tus prejuicios no te permiten algo tan maravilloso como vivir una historia de amor, dure o no. En mi trabajo, tenemos relación con gente de una escala sociocultural alta como lo es un médico en todas sus ramas, clase intrmedia, que son técnicos y enfermeros y la media baja, que son administrativos y obreros, pero es sólo un trabajo, tu vida personal les tiene que chupar un huevo, perdona la vulgaridad, pero me hiciste saltar los tapones. Hay gente que se muere sin vivir una experiencia de amor con atracción sexual y todo el paquete y tu osas rechazarlo por su condición de obrero. Si te tuviera cerca te daría un par de cachetadas, obvio que con todo el respeto del mundo, pero para que reacciones por un lado y para sacarme el dolor de tu prejuicio de mi mente.|`|8qV3QAYwaa	Debes estar clara con qué es lo que sientes. <br>  Tal vez lo idealizas por la misma "imposibilidad" que para ti existe. Tal vez si le dieras la oportunidad, te darías cuenta de que no es la persona que imaginaste al escuchar las canciones.....<br>  Por otro lado, si estás clara y te sabes enamorada, ?qué te importa lo que digan? La relación es con él, no con tu familia ni con tus amigos. No todas las personas han tenido las mismas oportunidades de estudio y trabajo, para que lo discrimines por su oficio.<br>  Pero al mismo tiempo, debes conocerlo para darte cuenta de que no se trata de un oportunista, que vea en ti la salvación y la oportunidad de tener quien le mantenga.<br>  En caso de que decidas darle una oportunidad y conocerlo, ya sabes a lo que vas, pero él también. Ambos deben poner de su parte: tú de no preocuparte por frivolidades y él de no hacerte quedar mal con chabacanerías. Si sólo uno de los dos cede, no hay futuro. Pero como te digo, la decisión te corresponde solamente a tí.|`|Ba4TWh6Taa	Debrias darte la oportunidad de probar esa relacion. nadie te ha dicho que es para siempre asi que no te procupes no sabes que pueda pasar tal vez te descuenta que si vale la pena y termina por ser el amor de tu vida y no te va importar lo que los otros digan yo te aconsejo que te enimes y pruebes no te quedes con las ganas no sabes que podria pasar,|`|H3q2vYhaaa	si...yo pienso igual de mi situación.<br>  Pero también pienso que NINGUNA de las personas que juzgan y "arman" parejas perfectas...va e estar acostada en mi féretro con mis gusanos comiendo mi cuerpo...Es por eso que no veo la hora de que NOS encontremos definitivamente en un BesodeaMorypasión.|`|NWYiRBK7aa	Hola, yo creo que te estas enamorando de el.

AA10451299	So, was the like this in school before she came to live wiTH you and her dad? I don't think she has a psychological problem. My guess is she has abandonment issues and could use therapy. THis child is 7 and has had what kind of stability? It looks like she is asking for help from people that are in a position to give it to her (school) that may not be true, but in her eyes it is. What she is doing, fighting, lying... that is attention seeking behavior, not honest distructive behavior. I think her response is kinda healthy from what you are discribing her life has been like thus far. She knows her mom left her, dad wasn't able to step up and take charge of her until now (i know this is harsh- I am sorry for that- but sometimes honesty is) If everything you are saying is true and accurate, she just needs play therapy. If you can't afford it schools ALWAYS have councelors on hand for kids to talk to. Thinking about psychological problems rarely work on such a perfect school schedule and medication (especially for a 7 year old) should be one of your last options.<br>  Think about it like this: How would you comunicate and deal with what all she has been through? Would you really want to upset your "new" mom and dad? The family you want? No. You would want to make sure they were happy with you and always like you, that they didn't scold you because if they don't always like you and aren't always pleased with your behavior perhaps they will leave again or send you away again.<br>  Wishing your family all hopes possible~|`|088oMZ49aa	you should consult the school counselor. She seems to be bottling up some sort of frustration :(|`|6IjEKZ7Haa	she just might be balling up all her feelings inside and doesnt knwo how to express herself...u sy esnt her to see a phycortist cuz its not good for her to keep that all in|`|AA11784141	Hi there! It is wonderful that you are concerned and that you love your step daughter so much. Her lying is a defense and we get defensive when we are afraid. In this case probably afraid of getting in trouble (for leaving her homework.."knee jerk" response). The first thing you have to do is talk to her about telling the truth and the importance of that....and the importance of taking responsibility for her actions...but TALK to her. She is seven, so she can listen and understand you.  Let her know that no matter what happens you love her and you aren't going anywhere. Her past has probably left her afraid that  things will change again.  TALK about it. Take away her FEAR as best you can....replace that with LOVE which it sounds like you are trying your best to do..and it should be cool....or at least better. Kids need reassurance and discipline. Safe, sane, loving discipline. Good luck! You got any Mother-daughter club type things going on in your area you could take her to? that would be cool...you'd get a chance to talk with other mothers and she would feel more like you are stable...the notes sound like she's afraid of losing you.|`|oNHBSzyxaa	Maybe she doesn't like the school's enviroment.  Change school?|`|Ve22Y4k8aa	have u ever asked her how she behaved that way?maybe you should.she might be trying to get attention in school.Does she has any friends at school.she probably want to befriends with othr kids but didn't know the right way.
rmOpaerIaa	Ignoring him, giving him the cold shoulder or a dirty look. That always works for me. =) For example :<br>  <br>  The guy I currently like got so upset when he found out I was mad at him. He kept writing me little notes during class saying how sorry he was and kept saying to me "are you okay? I'm really sorry, what can I do so you won't be mad at me?" It was so cute, eventually I couldn't help but laugh and told him things were okay. And just today I got really mad at one of my guy friends, I completely ignored him and walked away when he came to sit with me at lunch. He followed me and wouldn't leave until he was positive I wasn't mad anymore. I even said "Go ahead, leave." and he responded with "No, not when I know you're mad at me."|`|MUIfDWqWaa	Just tell 'em. Maybe like just tell them ya know that makes me mad 7 i wish you wouldn't do that. Don't ingrore him cause he will only get more mad.|`|mIUMJi5eaa	just tell him you are mad
1QtnWB5kaa	Vague description, can't really answer your questions without actually bumping into you.  Your description of yourself can be used to (truthfully) describe 100 other girls, all with completely difference appearances (& of course some hotter than others).<br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  And don't post your pic on yahoo.

A "pretty clear face" doesn't mean you have good skin. You might not have acne, but you miht have an unattractive birth mark or splotchy skin. And "skinny" isn't always good. You could weigh 100 pounds and have no boobs at all. and what do grades have to do with physical attraction? And don't you find it strange that the only shirts you wear are black and white? I can't tell you if you're hot because you didn't show me a picture. but I can promise you that you have a very unattractive personality.|`|zTzPyfVlaa	That doesn't tell us much
gosxJiOZaa	Well if you like him, then I suggest some conversation.

Physically and emotionally.  Real answer is you.  Can you handle not being with this person?  Are you emotionally on standby when you are not with this person? Answer these two questions honestly and you will have the answer.  Good Luck..|`|K3Drigh5aa	how can anyone tell you what you should do emotionally?  wow...only you can know that...stupid is as stupid does|`|gxf5fBPDaa	Long distance is the hardest! You have to really keep at the relationship, talk a lot (e-mail, texting, phone ext.). Physically its even harder (I'm sure you already know)! Maybe try seeing each other more often (if you can). In the end you have to think is it worth it? If it is, you'll find away to make it work.
y2JTMs8taa	When you give someone your heart, it's the most important thing you can give. To have that gift stomped on really hurts. The best thing you can do is to tell her she's giving you mixed messages and that it probably would be better if the 2 of you just didn't communicate at all any more.<br>  <br>  It's so easy to love someone. It's so very hard sometimes to like them.<br>  <br>  Love is one thing but living with them on the day to day stuff can really be a mess.|`|8fc631e41ad2374db0b841af558ea19faa	stop talking to her and giving her power move on keep busy.|`|H44TkqgAaa	Start dating other girls. Get your mind on other things.<br>  <br>  If she keeps telling you one thing and then takes it back, she needs to make up her mind and stop playing you!|`|IzJUQ3apaa	She is probably contacting you when she is on the outs with this other guy, and then they make up and she forgets about you.  How do you forget about her?  Stop believing that she has anything to offer you except heartache and sorrow.  She is a "chick" not a woman.  A woman communicates honestly.  A chick flits back and forth between roosters.  Next time she calls you, tell her you are not interested, and not to contact you again with her lies and confusion.  Tell her you don't want to be used by some confused chick who does not know which rooster she wants to be with.  And when you say it, you have to mean it.|`|UoRZEjqbaa	dude i have been in your shoes before and i just posted here about how im in love with this girl, and i feel you, i think she is just playing u, play her back see how she likes it|`|Z4h7YbC5aa	Listen mate this girl is playing you.  She obviously has problems, and heres the thing, shes NEVER gonna get back with you, so just stop taking her calls or just tell her to stop calling you.  It will b hard at first but eventually youll get over it and meet someone else.|`|c2pH5l6aaa	Dude, this sounds like my story exactly.......I think she knows she has you on the hook and just don't want to let go............when you have not heard from her in awhile and you feel like ...." Ok, this is getting better....I'm feeling better" you get that email, text or phone call from her ......for me it doesn't matter how many other chicks I get with or have.........this one just has me..........sorry, I don't have the magic answer.......I'm just a victim like you.....good luck pal|`|kHUPZTn5aa	Stop taking her calls!  Up until now, she knows she has you wrapped around her little finger.  Why?  Because you keep taking her calls.  10 times?  Why would you put up with this?  She will never stop because you are enabling her to keep doing this to you.  You are always there whenever she feels like she has time or space for you.  Is that what you really want?  And by the way, she calls you while she has another bf?  Then she's not worth it at all.  I feel sorry for you and her bf.  She needs to learn her lesson.
iM2OJJaraa	I wouldn't like it if a guy tried to hold my hand. The fact that you don't know if she has feelings for you means that you should take it slowly. The first date is about getting to know her better, not stressing if you should hold her hand or not. Things will happen in their own time. Just have fun and have a good time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8uzjRKyjaa	Just try to touch her hand randomly.If her doesn't refuse, you can hold her hand.<br>  Good luck,Boy|`|RCgG6Lfraa	well let it be after the date, maybe when saying goodbye to her hold both of her hands if she tries to look you in the eye and then look away, she has feelings for you , then just go closer and give her a very long,warm  hug, dont try to kiss her, keep it long, if she is really into you she will ask for  the kiss after the hug, <br>  try to look her in the eye as well.|`|dda801b8f4eefb1b55c362e5e36b5167aa	well she said yes so she probly has feelings for u if she didnt have feelings for u then why would she agree to go on a date with u? lets say ur walking with her. at first u keep brushing her hand. then after a minute or so u gently pinky lock. next u slowly slide ur hand with hers. if she stiffens or moves away then she probly doesnt want to hold hands.|`|hB6JlQCCaa	I would wait for the hand holding until you know for sure she likes you. I would wait a bit,I think it is very sweet that you want to do that.|`|zKaXW3x9aa	best way is to use your doodle and if she still holds it then she likes you.

Zum Beispiel hat sich Michael Douglas deswegen behandeln lassen...<br>  Sexuell süchtiges Verhalten ist durch eine zunehmende sexuelle Bet?tigung gekennzeichnet, bei der aber die Befriedigung meist ausbleibt (!!) und die Suche nach sexueller Erfüllung infolgedessen best?ndig fortgeführt wird. Dabei zeigen sich typische Kennzeichen der Sucht, wie Dosissteigerung und Toleranzentwicklung. Nach und nach wird Sexualit?t zum alles bestimmenden Lebensbereich. Es treten gravierende Folgen wie famili?re Probleme, berufliche Schwierigkeiten etc. auf. Als Ursachen werden sowohl genetische Veranlagung als auch Missbrauchserlebnisse in der Kindheit diskutiert. Ziel der Therapie ist es, Intimit?t auch ohne Sexualit?t wieder erleben zu k?nnen und negative Gefühle zuzulassen, ohne diese durch Sex überdecken zu wollen. Aufgrund der starken Auswirkungen, welche die Sucht auch auf das Umfeld des Süchtigen hat, spielt die Einbeziehung der Angeh?rigen in die Behandlung der Sexsucht eine wichtige Rolle.|`|B1NZuoVeaa	Wenn der Sex Spa? macht, warum nicht!!|`|IRJaJD54aa	Warum denkt ihr M?nner nur an Sex?|`|XZDrM0Bjaa	Ja ich glaube ich bin es!

QLhuYWmxaa	ok this dude and i were at the school movie night (which is outside and at night, obviously) it was kinda like a picnic and a few of my friends were there and they seriously would not stop talking to us and we just wanted to watch the movie so we were just ignoring then so finally 3/4 of the way through the movie he text me this message "look to your left" (the side he was on" but stupidly i thought he wanted me to look at my friends. so i look the other way then he said to me, "your other left" and when i looked at him he kissed me. i was mad at first because it was our first date but i got over that anger really fast.  hope that helps=)  rock on!|`|sOr5s4KDaa	a real long kiss down on the beach one night a couple of summers ago.. never will forget that kiss... or her smile ;) ashame i never asked her for her number... eh, w/e tho

qs2jx5xFaa	When I was young, I never had to tell anyone that I liked them, it just came natural.  I would get the guys attention by flirting and talking to him.  If he liked me back, Generally I could tell.<br>  Since you think he likes you too.  Ask him if he would like to go to a movie, or what ever it is that you both like doing.<br>  Once a relationship is established to more than friends, then you can say, I really like you.<br>  Hugs, Judy|`|flkVehA9aa	If his name is Roosevelt then there is nothing you can do.<br>  sorry!<br>  <br>  On second thought just ask him to change his name.

ubdlR0Vnaa	I've asked myself the same question a million times. Because Pittsburgh is such a college town, it is unfortunately riddled with frat-boy jerks (which is one of the reasons I may be giving up the hope that I'll find a decent man in the bar scene)<br>  <br>  To look beyond the bars (and that might be a good idea if you are heading out alone) well... it just depends what you're into I guess. Writing groups, volunteer groups, open mic nights, gallery crawls, bookstores/coffee shops ... all good places to meet singles... and all great places to go alone without all the gals wondering "why is he by himself?"<br>  <br>  I suggest shadyside or the cultural district if you're looking for women who are beyond the whole college 'lets get drunk and screw' scene. <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out. Good luck.<br>  And don't forget to smile. Women can't resist a genuine smile.

daf375e4f707d47b3bbc72a1057f3410aa	yes, but i think that most teenagers THINK that they are in love, and that they exacgerate their feelings. I know that there are a lot of my friends who, with every boyfriend after like 2 weeks are like"I love you" and thats not real. But there are cases where there really is love. I know because i'm 17, and in love. and its not just me, you can really tell whether a couple is honestly in love. Its pretty rare to see in High school, but its possible. I didnt think it was, until i fell in love. haha|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Love to me is an option.. I think they can.. I have..|`|QLhuYWmxaa	yes they can. it has happened before so yea it can. just depends on the people in the relationship.|`|FSLLBC9oaa	i think so. im seventeen now and i know that im in love. i dont think it matters how old you are...all that matters is the connection you have with someone else. the way so many teenagers say "i love you" to their then girlfriend or boyfriend isnt real. thats not the real head-over-heels-id-do-anything-for-you-l... most of the time, but sometimes it is. being a teenager isnt going to prevent someone from falling in love with someone else.|`|I1SlvMwJaa	Absolutely! But it is SO rare that it is love, and not "puppy love." My boyfriend and I got together when we were fifteen and he told me he loved me, and I was skeptical for a very long time.But now I'm 20 and we are still together.When you are that age, people usually get caught up in the new feeling, and mistake it for love.  It just depends on who they are and their maturity level.

53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|W3mhMbSVaa	I really would like to tell you to let it go cause your better than that but I also understand your crush.  If you really think this is THE guy I would urge you to keep flirting but eventually tell him how you feel.  If you wait to long he will be lost forever....|`|AiyRv4Kraa	I know I may sound horrible for saying this but give it time. After some time of continuing the same thing, you guys might start hanging out during the week and if that happens just go with the flow.    Don't talk about his girlfriend. Don't really talk about relationships. It's a good time to get to know him even better than you do now. Everyone is deeper than they may seem. Find of what kind of car he likes, right done to the color.     I have a boyfriend in the same situation like this. My mother doesn't even know xD. Time. Time is all you need.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	well. my best advice is to see what this guy really feels about you. if he really does like you and maybe wants to try this "dating" out with you, then maybe go for it. if you see each otherr every weekend and you both think that you can be in a relationship without cheating then maybe it is worth it.   it depends on how far away you actually live and how much you both are committed. if you are both really flirty then you do likeeach otherr. but you honestly have to find out how he feels. when you figure that out then maybe you should just see if he even wants to be with his new girlfriend and if he doesnt then you two should try things out.    good luck.|`|n1vMMvhhaa	I think that you should just convince him that you are way better than his girlfriend.  My girlfriend lives 30 miles away and i only get to see her usually one time a week (on the weekends). And it works out just fine. I have had past experiences where i saw my girlfriend a little TOO much and it caused arguments. So, just do something really cute and really sweet. That should win him over!     GOOD LUCK!|`|qo9JvSBFaa	you say he loves you and he just started dating this girl so im sorry but maybe he doesn't really love you he's only hurting you if he loves you so much he wouldn't have found this other girl to be with sorry to be a pain but that's what i think|`|5EFZUqm9aa	Just ask him if he wants to be with you in a serious relationship or not... that's what i will do...|`|wqY80VVraa	well i was'nt goin 2 say that i mean u saw em first right . usually i'd say go for it but since u said u go 2 different schools then i'd b a little unsure . b cuz when he breaks up with his girlfriend (which will eventually happen b cuz he's got a thing 4 u) they'll still b goin 2 the same school and u won't b arou n . sowhen u guys do get 2 gether spend as much time 2 gether as u can . and watch out 4 his OBSESSIVE EX!!! LOL|`|VtcjKdi8aa	Britney, If he truly has feelings for you he will leave this other girl and be with you. But if he is flirting with the both of you and keeping it a secret then he is just playing the both of you. Don't hate this other girl if she doesn't know of his actions cause trust plays big part in a relationship. Don't get played by this guy cause in the end it will only lead to heartache. I used to be a player like that and I hurt a lot of people I really cared about. You need to talk to him and set the record straight. Tell him "I know you are seeing this other girl and it hurts me cause I want to be yours" Use your own words but that is just an example. I hope this helps and good luck.|`|HwxcAIwhaa	its all good now,but if you do go out,after a while there will be this feeling likes hes cheating on you,only one of you will get it though.and when the other one most likely isnt...it will ruin everything trust me.goodluck|`|JfKer60Faa	ask him out.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	ok i will not write  stop flirting with another girls boyfriend    but i will write avoid it as you will hurt your self|`|YFKwT1owaa	Break them up somehow then steal him from the other girl and when she goes after you, have him protect you >;)|`|uqs2NCodaa	damn if hes a man, tell him to break up with that stalker. Of course he likes you unless hes just trying to get some
NqON8qNFaa	I had a similar problem with my childhood best friend. The fact is, you probably won't ever be BEST friends again, but you certainly can stay friends to a lesser extent. Try suggesting to her that you meet up at a coffee shop or restaurant once a month to catch up. It's really fun to have a friend you only talk to every so often, because you can tell him/her all the things your school friends already know. These occasional meetings have worked wonders for me and my friend.<br>  Good luck!|`|9Tc02PUtaa	o man the best friend one this will be tough well get her number talk to her in your spare time and don't say u don't have enough time because one thing ive learned when you say you don't have time to do something its not important to you because we always have time to do things most important in our lives. then try to move around the schedules like when your asked to hang out with another one of your best friends that you hang out with all the time say "no" and try to hang out with the ones you don't hang out with most of the time. and trust me all friendships find a way.|`|2sH17lbYaa	You guys will always be friends you just continue on with your life and when you guys get together again it will be like you never was apart.|`|PeMpDAbraa	E-mail is a good way. Other than that you are just gonna have to make time. Set up lunch dates or whatever a week or 2 in advance. I am still good friends with one of my grade school friend. I had another that I really don't talk to but I miss her dearly. Every relationship in time requires work and time. Make it possible.|`|W1TbwHnOaa	I really hate to say this, because I know how it feels, and it sucks to hear this, but it's true. Sometimes friends just grow apart. And it sucks, but thats just the way it goes sometimes. And I think this is one of those situations where you can't really do anything about except mourn the loss of the friendship for awhile, but eventually except that your friendship is different now. Once I was able to do that, I became so much happier. You have to learn to live in the present. It's hard, but as I know, it can happen.
N9DW9tpPaa	major university's have done studies showing men's DNA r hard wired for cheating. if he's straying it's because there is something he's craving. it mite depend on how selfish of o person he is to however. I'd say have a light hearted talk about sex fantasies, act sweet and ready for sex and he will probably get surprised and eager to answer and even let him pick out things that can be done safely. even group sex has been done safely on a consistent basis. use protection if you'ree getting that freaky though i recommend lifestyles ultra sensitive condoms or some other national brand .u can barely notice them and now that you'ree single you definitely need them. have fun and good luck. there's always more fish in the sea of life. love will always find a way back to you-Tesla's love song says it best i think|`|nWGgaQdhaa	its a hard call to make, the signs point to yes and no. but the fact that he pointed the finger at you and broke up with you because you didnt answer your phone is whats suspicious to me. normal people would figure out that you werent able to get to the phone. but since he said that you were doing something bad he seems guilty. so i'd say yes he probably did cheat on you.|`|8KGJj67aaa	The three never fail signs of a cheater.    Lies about his phone calls.  Lies about where he is.  Accuses you of being a cheater.      It's all there. He is cheating on you and at the very least hiding something from you.      But you already knew all of this. Kudos for not being blind like most women seem to be.    Get away from this guy before you get an STD. You deserve WAY better!|`|HYnBeyJsaa	Of course he's cheating on you and apparently he is one that does not do a good job on keeping it on the down low either (otherwise if he did do a good job, you would have never found out the way you did). In addition, you should not keep thinking about this. Just move on with your life and find someone else that is going to treat you right and respect you for who you are.|`|naequcqlaa	I don't think I'd let the pictures bother me due to the fact you said he did draw at one time & that could be the truth.  The other girl could just be who he said she was.  It's the actual phone messages that would lead me to believe he's been seeing other girls.  Why would one ask if he wanted to come over, the other telling him she was going over to his place.  There are the two things that would make me feel suspicious. Things people blame you for are usually doing it themselves, that's why it's "upfront" in their minds... I'm glad you're not taking this brake up hard tho.  You know you're going to meet plenty other guys before you actually settle down.  Just make sure whoever you're going with is true to you, & don't settle for less at any time.  Best to you...:)|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	yes he's definitely cheating gurl...its good thta he broke up with u,u deserve waaaay better...n as for the friends that u've lost,trust me if they're real friends then they'll ccome back n if they're not then u dont need them...  Start fresh n get rid of all the negativity that's around u.. :)  good luck..|`|FsDcrFDiaa	It is very possible that he is indeed cheating on you.  By the sounds of it he has picked up an interest in another girl/girls.  He is using his job as a cover up to be with other girls.  Get rid of him.|`|DntzRXczaa	def. a cheater... especially if he is accusing you of doing it to. Don't stress over being broken up either you deserve better. It is hard but you don't deserve a p.o.s. like that.|`|vf26zg01aa	Tell him to "not throw rocks when he's living in a glass house."  And every other line of your question is filled signs screaming that he's cheating.  Please just stay out of the relationship...  You'll be much happier.|`|uqs2NCodaa	take it from a guy who cheated a lot. He was defineitely cheating on you. once you see diff girls voicemail. it automatic. he can lie and all that but when his attitude changed was when he started.|`|s2kbs5eKaa	Change in attitude. Phone calls from other girls. Not being honest. Swearing he's not and then accusing you of cheating. He is cheating on you. And, he wanted to make it look like your fault in the break up by blaming you for being the cheater. There's no reasons for the pictures of other girls either. You're better off without him. You should work on getting back the friendships that you are able to and not jeopardize your friendships in the future.
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You just need to move on and prove to yourself that you are strong!|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Sometimes it depends on the time you post, as to the type of answers you will receive, as well.    Sounds like you could really use some better friends.    You say "out of the blue" she calls you.  She may not have meant to hurt you.  But it sounds like there has been and is   a lot of miscommunication  ...and details.    Basically, you're being dragged into the middle  of somebody else's problems.    My friends don't do alcohol or drugs.  That way I know they're sober or straight  when I see them.  Then there's no questioning their motives.    If you are questioning your friend's motives,  then perhaps you are being used.    Count your losses and get out.    I pray you find some truthful friends.  And "if" she is a keeper...  set your boundaries.    God bless.
CEChcfKwaa	That's a very nice thing you want to do for your friend. I think you should offer to go with her. Funerals are very stressful, especially when you are burying a parent and she might want and need your support. Lots of people go to funerals of someone they don't really know just to show respect to the mourner they do know.|`|Wr9EOkLOaa	I think that would be amazing, of course it would be appropriate. I'm sure your friend would think the world of you for showing up. Trust me, your friend is probably feeling awful right now and your appearance would really help.|`|R0UI3fObaa	I'd go, the relatives that you know and those you don't know would appreciate you being there for your friend..<br>  <br>  Though people are judgmental in most cases, I doubt they would be in something like this. Your friend would appreciate it too.<br>  <br>  |`|vaFIlAmgaa	you must be there for your freind, she will need both you and a shoulder to cry on.<br>  Saying that you didnt know her mother so your unsure to go seems like you are being just a little selfish to be honest...|`|7KRYTaReaa	You should go, its your friend she probably wants you there|`|alH9Tlahaa	GO.....It will mean a lot to your friend, and your there for her not the other relatives,I'd be there in a minute.|`|ux4D9ChHaa	Well essentially it is you and your friends decision you just want to pay respects and that if fine and you also want to be there for your friend so in the end you are being a true friend i would say its ok|`|Lcw8VjoYaa	dont worry about other relatives, if you want to offer your support to your friend this is your oppurtunity.|`|HWDfcmfXaa	Yeah. I think you really should go. It sounds really sad, and I think you should comfort your friend. :( tell her I say Im sorry.|`|acnbQr4faa	i would go. it would probably make your friend feel better knowing your there and the family would be happy to see you care about your friend and her mother's death|`|GRZHXG3Iaa	Personaly it depends on how close he is?  If he is a realy close friend hands down.  But if not, up to you.|`|yfMgmiaOaa	you should if you are good friends. just check it with her first. it'll help her get thru it. good luck
HPH6530paa	Its one of those family things.  You have to decide is the future peace and happiess of the family worth the long day and is having lunch with your friends more important than making your husbands life easier by sucking it up and making your MIL happy.   Its not that your husband dosent care about your happiness but a smart man knows this is a no win situation for him. You are asking him to choose your want or his mothers want.  Thats not fair of you, you choose for  yourself, your want or your MIL's want.  Its tough being a grownup. :-) Good luck with the choice.|`|ip68rbgAaa	I would not drive w/out insurance. You could get a big fine or run into big trouble if there was an accident. You are an adult and if you don't want to go to class, DON'T. Don't let people tell you what to do. It sounds like this class is something for fun, right? So, don't worry about missing it once if it won't be fun for you that day.|`|Ve22Y4k8aa	and i suppose it wouldnt kill u to delay the meeting with ur girlfriends for your MIL.maybe your MIL love to take the side streets because she can enjoy the view there while driving.Just get along with her.it's only for 1 day
dprURFLxaa	I go through this with my husband too.  I love him but sometimes hate him for ways that he has treated me.  But I think this is SUCH a common issue and as I've thought about it over the years I realize that when you can hate someone but still love them then you really do love them - true love.  It will never be the same as it was when it was new and all love and flirty...as you spend every day year after year with someone, you get to know their good and bad sides equally.  It is especially difficult after you have children together because you grow to love that person for your children and no matter how much you want to hate them, you still love them because of your children.  I know that no matter how much I might despise my husband sometimes, I love him for the way he fathers our kids and the innocent love they have for their dad.  Yes it is so frustrating sometimes...but like you said, non of us are perfect...|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Yes.  It is very painful.  This is more common than you think.      The line between love and hate can be crossed very quickly.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	I understand and maybe you guys need to go to marital counseling. You can't forgive him without help and you need God in your life.|`|rkh01QI2aa	? i would say yes, my mom used to tell me, "i love you, but i don't like you very much right now." and i completely understood what she was sayin'...you can love someone and not like them at the same time. ?|`|Hh92sQQbaa	Yes you can feel like that cause right now i'm in the same thing with my baby's dad i love him but i hate him for all the thing he did to me,he cheat on me and he lef me.So don't worry i feel the same.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	I love my husband more than life. And I hate him too, for lying to my face many times over, cheating on me, using me when he was unemployed, decieving me, and disrespecting me.  I can't take it any more, I love him, but I'm leaving him tonight.|`|AA11544472	i love my husband but do not like him 41years of this hope you can work it out if u want to stay strong|`|tev8K0dGaa	yea i understand how you feel i feel the same way about my husband  alot of the time. He has done some things in the past to let me and our children down and now its sooo hard to completly trust him and be in love  with him 100% i mean i would love for things to be the way they used to but so far they havent.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	I understand what you're going though.  I have learned to love myself and focus more on my daughter and I.    What he has done in the past that can hurt you, you have to learn from that.  I have told my husband since that I love him, but I didn't trust him.  He chose to play games with my love, and I have learned not to allow him to do so again.  He told me that he wanted a divorce, told me that he didn't want me anymore, just so he could have a secret rendezvous with someone younger who played him in return.  I accepted that he didn't want me at that time, and still feel that way.  I will not allow him to hurt me that badly, ever.  But I am still married to him, and we are still together.  I know that if he decides to take off, I have a "back-up" plan that does not involve him.    You have to make a life for you, off to the side, in case he decides to hightail it out of the relationship.
6kiL9hBXaa	Babe, I think you need to move on and stop feeling bad for telling her to move out. If was really that needy and helpless - she wouldn't have been coming home after 2 AM and sleeping around with who knows what kind of people. Be careful, you might even get a disease from her. It IS fair for you to tell her she cant live with you anymore, and you SHOULD do that!<br>  If she needs some help - well, look into what you can do, but don't jump over your head just to be a Mr. Nice Guy. She obviously doesn't want it badly enough nor does she deserve it!|`|MTPa5Bxwaa	i think judging by your last paragraph, you already know the answer. i think you brought a little of it on yourself. if you divorced her, you can't get mad because she's staying out or being involved with other guys. there's no children between the 2 of you AND she's not helping with the rent. i think she's getting over on you for a while but it's time to bring that to an end.|`|oYBOPNH4aa	Well the lease is up in 5 days. She will have to leave anyways. If she wants to stay, she will have to talk to the landlord and sign her own lease, that is fair.<br>  Move into your new apartment by yourself, and do not feel guilted into bringing her in, because it sounds like she will try to take advantage of you. |`|mRSa3nsOaa	Throw her *** on the streets. Tell her to stop acting like a child and get a life. If she wants to live with you, she has to pay rent and grow up. If she can't accept that, pick up her **** and dump it out the window. Don't be a wimp and take it, tell her what's what and say you would like to get on with your life. :D|`|vtWEiowVaa	If your lease is up in five days, that is not much time for her to find another place, especially if she has kids.  I would not renew the lease, move out, and allow her to take the lease over on her own.  She should have had plenty of time to see this coming to an end, if you are already divorced.  Of course she wants to stay with you!!!!  She pays no rent or bills?  That is called still being married.  I hope she at least has a job.|`|wkNvFMLGaa	I am sure that she has like a mum , sister or someone she can stay with until she sorts herself out. It's a bit harsh on the children but then she should have known better before going out late with another man. U need to move on yourself so yeah go ahead and kick her out                 |`|byBY2vpGaa	It's about time you grew a spine.  You divorced her because she came home late, but let her live with you and she did the same thing??? good grief.   She found a sucker and wouldn't let go.|`|rlh0fqIvaa	She should have been long gone.  Move on, find happiness and be free.  Go Baby Go!|`|XhPsAGTWaa	I think you're right in wanting her to leave.  If you are divorced its going to make it impossible for the two of you to move on.  But is it really what you want - to move on?  Honestly, coming home after 2AM one night a week isn't that big of a deal.  She's a grown woman, and if she wants to have a late night now and again, so what?  I think you were harsh to divorce her over this.  There are way worse things to happen in a marriage, and to me it sounds like you were a little controlling in this situation.|`|FRid8LUaaa	It is completely okay for you to ask your ex wife to leave. The fact of the matter is, you are no longer together and you are not responsible for her well being any more.<br>  <br>  She is treating the situation like you were roomies and not previously married. If you want to move on with your life then you need to move out on your own and she needs to do the same thing. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11604755	You need to tell her that she needs to find another place to live.  If she doesn't know where you new apartment is, don't tell her.  You also, need to cut all ties with her.  In other words, don't keep sleeping with her.  Start sleeping on the sofa or make her sleep on the sofa.  You need to let her know it is over.|`|zvP53EdZaa	I think you have been really good to her.  I would definitely tell her that she will have to get her own apartment.  She has some nerve expecting you to give her free living arrangements - especially if she is out with other men.  Don't let her use you like this - you sound like a really good person.|`|WZGlLrWMaa	I agree!<br>  <br>  Remember, she is your EX-wife, you owe her nothing. You were nice enough to put a roof over her head and she obviously doesn't appreciate anything you do, so you should inform her that she cannot stay with you anymore.|`|1RBIrkgFaa	This answer is to dumb to give an answer to in fact you are dumb... I just gave this answerer so you idiots can report this answer as you are no smarter than the asker. Are you for real... somehow I don't believe your question. But to give an answer.. why don't you get a life?|`|8jFkKKmwaa	Shes not paying rent and working?? Well she must have som ekind of money saved up to get her own place...I think shes sucking youdry. Its your house and if she doesnt like your rules she should of been kicked out long before this!|`|0RDHYyO1aa	She should have been kicked out a long time ago!<br>  <br>  Please answer mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AowId5iW_55Cj8fMHn6ABTLOxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080928084914AAVwLnF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11356977	Giver her a written 30 day notice. |`|u9mE35o5aa	EX-wife?  Well, yeah... she should get her own place!!<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty.  That relationship is over and it's time for the rest of your life.|`|fba40d6b496629b6d627a579ba3eb661aa	Sounds to me like you have your answer already. Yes, I would tell her it's time to move on. She doesn't sound like she's a very faithful woman.|`|omc2WD5kaa	dude you shoulda moved out before. Tell her she has to move out. Her problem. She didnt listen to you. |`|0jYKeIEGaa	Get out of the bed with her! Don't you have any pride at all? She needs to find her own place. |`|sD5KyGLGaa	Kick her out.<br>  <br>  NOW.|`|xsUaHA8Zaa	I agree.  You both must move on with your lives, in separate apartments.|`|CsbiReutaa	Yep, she needs to go.|`|kAjE46Ypaa	Yes! Kick her out! it is the right thing do to! I promise! =)|`|xLbvgsucaa	Sounds fair to me.. Rat!|`|DIKHDbQUaa	Let me tell you this, you have to be the nicest and most tolerable man in the planet.  I give you tons of kudos for being able to live in the same house with the woman you just divorced.  What are you a saint or something?  Yes, she is well BEYOND the point of having to take care of herself and her children.  She made her bed and yes she needs to lie in it.  You gave her everything it sounds like, and she took serious advantage of your kindness.  Its time to move on.  Good luck and God bless great men like you!|`|vCpsuchtaa	It's hard leaving someone you care about and are comfortable with. However, she is not trying to be with just you if she is with other men. So why keep the stress and heartache? Go out there and find someone who won't do this to you, believe me, she's out there!|`|3wdeyo5Raa	yep tell her hasta la vista and sayonara |`|54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Wow, you have a lot more patience than me. I would not be able to stand being in the same room with someone like that. If she whines about it, you should suggest she take her kids and move in with whatever guy she's been sleeping with.|`|l2ma3RYraa	I agree with you.<br>  It is not your place to support her and her two children.<br>  When you move out it would be up to her to find a new place to live.|`|AA10529334	No its not fair to give a woman with 2 kids only 2 days to find another place to live. |`|W8hvEmFlaa	Kick her out and cut all ties with that woman, and start a new life for yourself.
0WstfAmzaa	Your friend is a little bit misinformed.    I am a Jehovah's Witness who got married last year.    We don't have a temple - it's called a Kingdom Hall.  There are no statues or idols or crosses.  I had my ceremony at the Kingdom Hall and then my reception was at a banquet hall.  There was food, dancing, alcohol (wine and even hard alcohol available).  Our DJ was a regular guy we found off the internet and hired.  We did not have toasts, garter toss, bouquet toss..  In other words, on the whole, it's no different from any other regular wedding.    We do avoid over-drinking and music with suggestive lyrics... but not drinking and music altogether.|`|3T2s2Snuaa	Who told you JW's dont drink?  They do drink, and listen to music, they just dont drink too much, or listen to inapproperaite music. in the bible jesus and many others drank on many different occasions, but the bible shuns drunkness. Music was also in the bible, a lot.  When you go to the wedding you can expect a little bit of drinking (maybe, or maybe at the dinner, or whatever)  Just go and be yourself and it will be ok, it just a JW wedding, it really not that diff from a reg wedding to be honest.
2jCEdYbdaa	At CVS pharmacy, they have little valentine's gifts for a dollar. I found a pair of little handcuffs that said 'prisoner of your love' and some of those dice where one has instructions ( like rub or kiss) and the other has a body part. Only 2 bucks!!|`|LsHkgexvaa	I think you for valentines day would be nice. Buy a roll of wrapping paper and a ribbon, and wrap yourself!|`|CUTdsV1baa	I would have to say that an Axe body set is the cheapest route to go.. You both can enjoy that present. I know they're at Walmart
crFl8m26aa	You should be cordial to Marge if you guys are in a good place. Ariel is dead wrong in asking you to limit your conversations with someone based on the fact that she does not like her. This sounds so third grade|`|RvXEXb5Yaa	I would go with Ariel and try not to talk to Marge so much. What im trying to say is that you are in a tough situation and i would say have a talk with your friend. Tell her there is nothing Marge can do that will split up your friendship. Also if you dont like her i would make sure that you dont put it in a way were it sounds like your hitting on her.|`|t043WEDIaa	No matter what your friend asks you it's probably better that you aren't flirting with Marge.  I think that Ariel has no business telling you what to do, but she also seems genuinley scared that Marge is up to no good if she's ready to make that request of you.  My advice would be to keep your relationship with Marge to the office and tell Ariel that you understand her feelings, but that she shouldn't worry about the end of your friendship no matter what Marge does.|`|CoZ3RjIsaa	Try acting more grown up? Don't go to the party?   Just act cordial to both ladies?|`|TqWXXZ34aa	I would tell marge that you will meet her at the party. Don't go with her cause she may interpret it as a date... While at the party mingle with other people don't just hang with marge. Tell Ariel that Marge is just your friend and so is she and to please not worry. that no one can take your friendship away. Tell Marge that you and Ariel are friends. Keep it causal between everyone and everything should go smoothly. Have fun. You seem to be over thinking everything. Just go and have fun!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You can do whatever you like and feel comfortable with. It's not down to anyone else to tell you how to behave.|`|EvN7x9fzaa	It's almost painfully obvious that you and your ex are over each other, and that you guys aren't planning to get back together anytime soon.    Ariel doesn't have the right to tell you who to talk to, and it doesn't seem like your ex is making her uncomfortable.    I think that Ariel is only wanting to look out for you, because of the quote on quote "mess" that your ex made after the breakup. Thank her for her comment, but she shouldn't be able to dictate who you talk to like that.    As for your ex, Its great that you guys are gettin along well, but maybe take your friends words into consideration over he relationship between you and your ex.    Sometimes, the people around you have the best insight on things.    Good luck.|`|yNbGq4viaa	Sounds like Ariel needs to grow up and get a life so she can stop living yours for you.  What are you?  12?  You let one friend tell you who you can be friends with and how much you can talk to them?  Come on...grow a set and stop letting this person run your life for you.  Ariel certainly didn't care if it was going to be awkward for you before she invited your ex to the same party and now she wants it to be even more awkward for you by putting you in the position of not being able to talk to Marge?  Ariel must suffer from really low self esteem if she can't even let you be friends with another woman.  If you let her tell you what to do now she will expect to be able to do it all the time.  If you start dating someone else she will make your life miserable or stop being your friend because she is so jealous.  Wise up!  I'd avoid the party altogether and when she asks why you didn't come I'd tell her because she made too many demands on me and I didn't think it was going to be a good time.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	LEAVE THEM BOTH ALONE AND TELL THEM TO BE BEST FRIENDS! LOL|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Find some more mature friends to hang out with.  That should solve everything my friend!|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	Is the party that important? make an excuse like you ill or something, and don't go. Send a gift.|`|nukcYkR9aa	wow. this is crazy! i think u should go to the party and pretend like they both are like any other friends.|`|AJr98ZReaa	Ok, i had to draw a chart to keep track of the relationships here, but I think I got it. I would consider putting this drama to good use, and join the writing staff of a Soap Opera.    Now, there's nothing you can do. You all go to the party. Amanda damn well better make sure they behave civilly. You remain friends with both of them... as best you can.    I know first hand it is very difficult remaining friends with two people who absolutely loathe each other, but it is possible. You have to adamantly tell each that the other is your friend, and you wish it to remain that way.     Try not to take sides. Good luck to you.|`|AA10942089	Friends don't set the rules on who you talk to. That's what wives are for.|`|QijoFWoCaa	Tell Ariel that she is a better friend to you than Marge, but you don't want to be put into an awkward situation of having to act rudely toward another person.  Tell her that you certainly won't be doing any heavy flirting (sounds like you're over her), but that you can't promise not to talk to her.  It's not a reasonable request.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I've used Grower's Box on multiple occasions for weddings and parties. We've never been disappointed and from experience they even include a few extra stems in case one or two are damaged, which is really nice. You can order an entire Wedding in a Box and arrange them yourself with very little help. I do however recommend picking up a book on floral design that talks about using oasis and doing hand-tying. I also recommend trying things out with grocery-store bought flowers ahead of time so you get an idea of what's in store and whether or not you can acheive the look you want. Also, if storing the flowers, make sure you have a cooler that is the proper size and temperature or your flowers will be ruined. It is not a difficult task and if you are creative it can be a lot of fun!    Good luck!|`|c059nXPfaa	I used to work at a florist, and also have ordered mail-order flowers that come unarranged.  While the latter is cheaper, you never know exactly what you will get until it arrives.  If the flowers come slightly damaged, there's no one to go to and demand a better product, like you could if you went to a florist.  They may give you some money back, but that won't save the look of your wedding flowers.  I'd advise ordering them at least 5 days in advance, so if you need to go to a florist and get any replacements, you have the time.    Also, you need to know a little bit about processing and storing flowers to make these flowers wedding-ready.
AA10942089	I think you need to try to repair your relationship with your mom before you think about moving in with your friend.     Besides, what do your friends parents think about you living with them for half the month?|`|KWl605JTaa	do it.  just runaway little girl|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	this is ridiculous. if your mother agreed to this i would question her fitness as a parent. you are 13 and your friend's dad has no business extending this kind of invite. wrong and stupid. get help at school for the problems with your mother.|`|4nSGT0Yvaa	By asking her if you can go somewhere else 2 weeks a month, won't help the problem! It would make it worse! Try talkin to her that she's bugging you. You also have to think, did your friend say you can say 2 weeks a month, or did her mum say you can? It would be a big commitment having another child to care for and feed.    Hope this helps :D|`|AA12396274	well at 13 she would have to be out of her mind to let you stay with someone else ,you need to act your age and be glad she lets you do the things you do do,sounds to me like you are spoiled rotten,and i would ground you for saying because of her,have a little respect for your mom|`|op9hvlv9aa	I am a 33 yr old mother and one of my friends daughters lived with our family for 4 months because the mom was having problems with her and the only reason why I agreed to let her stay with us was because I was good friends with the mom and I knew the situation that was going on the best advice I can give you is talk to your mom, you need to be honest about why you want to do this because she's gonna ask you why you want to live with your friend 2 weeks out of the month and she is gonna have to get to know the people you are moving in with. As a Mother I wouldn't want my child wanting to be some where 2 weeks out of the month with someone else I would want to work things out. What's the reason why you want to be away from your mom? does she beat you? does she neglect you? Does she treat you badly I hope this isn't because your mom doesn't let you have your way all the time.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	well i want you to know that moving to a house with any man as nice as you think he is just isn't safe.  do your self a favor and stay and enjoy all the problems kids your age have with their mother you will live to laugh about it but if you put yourself in harms way you might not don't you read the papers see movies go to www.virturs.com this site talks about all ways grown men are so nice that convince little girls like you to think they are the best and they want to be closer to them than to the people who really love you and believe me your mother has a dirty job shes trying to race you to be a decent human being do you know it is easier for her to let you do what you want and not bother with you in turn do what she wants and maybe even be a teenager again instead of going to have a party she stays and raises you and puts up with your 13 year old attitude and mouth no doubt. maybe your friends dad is a decent nice man but what if?|`|a326743cf4f5ee607df580197f6d5185aa	she probably wont let u.  especially if your only thirteen.  and does your friends parents say its ok?  cause your friend most likely doesnt pay the bills.  If you can get he other set of parents to say its a good idea then she might go for it.  its a long shot though.
53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|AA11441704	You need to ask him.......|`|AA11309717	This is trouble waiting to happen. You say you love your boyfriend, right? You say you are best friends with his ex wife, right? What are you thinking? If something were to happen between the 2 of you, you'd feel guilty about cheating on your boyfriend who you say you love, you'd feel guilty about betraying your best friend who you say you love and it's likely the new guy would dump you because he's just looking for somebody to play with and you are it. If you go tonight be sure to include your boyfriend as well.    Best scenario would be to tell him thanks but no thanks and just go out with your boyfriend.    Good Luck!
20TvoGJwaa	Well if you want to do a party and then maybe have some girls stay the night or something.  If you want a themed party! Those are the FUNNEST! :]    -have the girls dress as guys, and guys dress as girls    -have a fear factor party! don't eat bugs or anything, but you could make up obstacles, and eat a raw egg or something fun like that.    -scavenger hunt! take pictures of things all around town, work in a 3's or 2's (or whatever) Get everyone to bring their cellphones, and give clues to everyone for stuff you can find around your neighborhood, and take pictures of them on their phones. the person/s with the most correct wins!

beozmV1Naa	If you you are attitude changed, and you are serious about it.|`|JHzP1qtoaa	Maybe, but for the time being you lost her. If you showed not signs of interest, the girl would look really desperate if she kept flirting with you.|`|zgnK8j8yaa	You are just being to hard on yourself, All things are possible, you may have caught her on a day that every thing went wrong. This is a sure fire way to find out! Look her straight in the eyes and say........ do you have any plans for dinner next saturday?|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	girls usually like the same guys for a while. she probably didn't think you liked her, and so is afraid to flirt with you for fear of rejection. just keep it up, and i'm sure she'll reciprocate eventually. :]]|`|YfJR5YbLaa	sure thing|`|k9YpwInLaa	yes u still have a chance keep going at it
7j78zljaaa	Nicole, I would take him at his word and just give him a little more time.  But maybe ask him to give you a general timeframe of when he thinks you will see him again.  If he misses the deadline, then ask him again.  If he balks, then you may just have to move on and date someone else.|`|LO3BMobRaa	Apparently this guy is too busy for a relationship or he may be interested in someone else. If he changes the subject when you tell him how you feel he can't have too much concern for your feelings. Let him know (not threatening him though) that if he's too busy for you, you both need to move on.|`|63abdfc0cefa30f121927b1cf2ecac66aa	There's probably something going on in his life that you haven't realised, or he's keeping it from you. I think you should talk to him about himself instead of where your relationship is going. He may have some personal problems or may have jumped out of a serious relationship so it's best to keep it easy. Let him say how he feels first. But first, let him know you care. Have a good talk to him<br>  <br>  Hope everything turns out okay.|`|3e02abba9023193874a524809abaaee2aa	You should ask him how he feels with the relationship or if you are his first girlfriend ask him if he's scared.|`|3g1pw4qiaa	He may just be afraid to talk to you about his feelings, especially if you've just started dating. I would give him some time to open up and get to know you and trust you. Of course, if it gets to the point where it seems he's avoiding you and keeps putting off seeing you, then I would have a talk with him and see what's up.|`|5X3EJyTAaa	It looks like the guy is changing the subject because he doesn't want to tell you.|`|DBQCA7udaa	I think as a Guy I will do the same if I'm not having any feeling for the guy I'm going out with, so my advise is that stop following him as he seems not interested on you.  So following him you are just wasting your time as he does not wan't to make you fell bad by telling you the truth of saying HE IS NOT NTERESTED!!!. My advice I believe that you are a very caring person  you have love, I 'm sure the is some one up there loking for soone like you , JUST move on with you live.|`|uSz1hIZJaa	i sya get out of this before its too late.. if he is too busy for you than may b he isnt into that much... when a guy truly loves and cares for someone they MAKE time and it just doesnt seem like that here
9pYEHVHPaa	No offense, but she sounds like she has some serious issues. You really, really  need to eliminate her from your life. You would be so much happier. DO NOT worry about her broken heart, it sounds like she need to grow up. Just break up with her and go have some fun. Don't think about her. Don't waste your time. Right now think of you (and I don't mean that in a selfish way).|`|iufAPDeWaa	You just need to tell her that she's suffocating  you and if she wants this relationship to work then she cant continue to do that. I think it was selfish of her to ask you to transfer. Seems like she just needs to accept the fact that you all are in a long distance relationship and will be for awhile. Also tell her, or have a friend or someone she knows tell her, that she has to go out and do other things, with friends and family. Because sitting there missing you and always thinking and wanting to talk to you isn't healthy for her or the relationship. If she doesn't have a well rounded life and other people to spend time with then you serve as that to her. So she just needs to be spoken to about and explain it. I was in a similiar position with my man awhile back. I didn't have many friends and he was away at school and he talked to me and explained it. He even said exactly what you said "she expects me to talk to her almost constantly, to the point where it is difficult to do anything else with my friends here at college". He said he cant hang out cuz we're always texting or talking. And I began to just sort of ween myself off ya know. I had to understand that I couldn't suffocate him because I dont have a life. So I went out found friends and now i'm not always up in his face 24/7. Spending time apart is as much needed in a relationship as spending time together. Now he has graduated college, he's home and we're still growing strong and doing even better. Patience and understanding is what you BOTH will have to have. A relationship is a growing thing. You much work on it. Don't just give up. Talk to her and work with her. She'll get there. I did. Its crazy me and my man were in this EXACT SAME situation. (Except I didn't drink my self to sleep, or anything and I didn't break down. I was just bummed when he wasnt there) I'm thankful that he hung in there. I wish you luck!! :)|`|AA10504567	Pretend to apply and say you didn't get in.|`|ckcNNMkLaa	get rid of her    she doesnt sound like the one|`|VWDYRlV0aa	yeh|`|nWGgaQdhaa	wow, i really dont think that you guys should have EVER gotten together. maybe you should have talked to her instead of getting angry. and is there a reason that you didn't tell your parents??? you seem to be stuck on yourself. she deserves better. if you love her as you say you do then you would be able to find a way to talk to her about it, and come to some kind of agreement. an dnot just break up with her and kick her to the curb beacause you didnt get your way.|`|Mf78vvLbaa	She is a very vindictive person, who I would not be involved with....that is not love my sweet......sounds like she is very very over controlling woman who wants her way. Yeah definitely too clingy and her calling you constantly and expecting you to call her ASAP....She is trying to get you under her control by you not having a social life or friends, and when you don't call her, its like ohhhh cant make time for me>?????? Yeah...get rid of the ***** now....She sounds psycho and to be adding your bro to facebook....its like shes planning everything out.....And I hope you find another nice girl that's not like her. And btw....it seems like you have already made your mind up about her.....so do yourself a favor. And next girl that comes along, don't be so naive!! you let people take advantage of you. you should have dumped her that night and been done with her. Good luck and i really wish you well in school, and don't you dare transfer for anyone. Go get your degree and make your family proud!!|`|zgD7Q1aJaa	please, dont destroy this girl because pple on here tel you to.  do what you want  not what others want you to do..  if you think that you should break up with her  and thats the best thing to do, then do it..  but don listen to what they say, whether they say do it or dont.  thats completely retarded..  no one knows how you feel about this girl like you do.  only YOU know how life would feel with out her..  so do what you think         hope that helps..        -*kayla|`|p4P24vtYaa	It's up to you, you could get peoples  opinions off here, but truthfully, it's your heart, your relationship, and your life.

vMOu03fRaa	Buena pregunta con un grado mejor de respuestas. En lo personal, sentir a mi bebé dentro del vientre de mi esposa me hizo sentir lo afortunado que Dios me hizo (soy creyente) un sentimiento de alegría con llanto, una frío en tu cuerpo que te hace saber cuan vivo estás; un amor tan grande hacia ese ser que sin conocerle ya lo amaba y daría la vida por él; te cuento que muchas veces visitaba al ginecólogo sin cita, solamente para poder oirlo a través del foco (aparato para escucharlo) para verlo en el ultrasonido, en fin, sentía una necesidad de él, de verlo nacer (he estado en los nacimientos de mis dos hijos)  tenerle ya en mi brazos (a ambos los he recibido directamente mientras cortan el cordón), en fin, te sientes único, especial, grande, ancho, agradecido, respiras un aire nuevo, tu cuerpo es joven y activo, pero sobre todo, sentí tanto amor hacia mi esposa que agradezco todavía la oportunidad que me brindó de cuidar a nuestros hijos en su vientre y sacrificarse por ellos.  Eso sentí, muy poco de explicar para lo que verdaderamente significa sentir cada movimiento de ellos dentro del vientre, tienes que sentirlo para comprender esa grandeza.|`|BOmXV107aa	Until: es una maravilla, una confirmación del amor que vive en ti, un compromiso de que ese ser se mueve y que tendrás que preocuparte por que esté en movimiento por siempre. <br>  bye y si es tu caso, muchas felicidades por esa bendición.|`|f26aa8647a0402f30f5a3d5c33228133aa	Es una sensación inexplicable pero muy hermosa, sentir que tienes vida dentro de tí es algo maravilloso.

EqshuMhsaa	A los hombres les gustan las mujeres totalmente diferentes a ellos... Eso lo dictan los genes... Los “contrarios atraen” son una ley de la atracción, por lo menos donde se refiere el electromagnetismo. <br>  <br>  Si los humanos fuesemos seres 100% lógicos, entonces no nos importaría mucho las apariencias. De hecho pensarias cosas como: “Bueno, se ve sumamente bien,,, probablemente utiliza demasiado tiempo preocupandose por su apariencia, lo cual significa que no ha de ser una compa?era muy atenta que digamos, escojes no sentirme atraido hacia ella.”|`|xv5K3Sp5aa	Pues que para empezar no hay mujer fea solo mal arreglada.<br>  <br>  Y esta pregunta deberias hacersela a los hombres que estan con esas mujeres, que les vieron.. aunque claro: En gustos y colores son miles los autores.

AA10283901	Your feelings can't be wrong because they belong to you.  I can't say I blame you for having these "normal" feelings.<br>  I have some questions for you . . . What kind of relationship is this, if you can't trust your man?  I admire his honesty in telling you that he goes out like that, but why is he telling you?  Is he wanting you to be jealous?  Is he trying to tell you something else?<br>  A true and solid relationship IS built on trust.  If you don't have that, then (in my opinion) it is pointless to be with someone.<br>  Communication is the second key to a healthy relationship.  Do you have that with your man?  I would guess no, since you are questioning his activities.<br>  Please think twice about your partner.  I bet you'd be better off in another relationship.  Try someone who lives closer to you.<br>  Good luck, Sweetie!  I hope everything works out for ya!
hrhPchd7aa	Some are better than others. Yeah I sort of agree some are mean and evil. But it's because they don't know a lot about Jesus.

Just ask her out.|`|AA11441704	when you know her well, you can ask.......but for the first time, it is not good.|`|Kmk8OlBCaa	IF YOU ASK HER, SHE WILL THINK THAT YOU WANT TO DATE HER. BUT IF YOU WANT TO DATE HER THERE IS NO HARM IN ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS
Pfog69hNaa	i think you should just tell her. when your alone and just say, you know, I really like you, (do it like on the beach), and then lean in to kiss her.  JUST MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE A BOYFRIEND, OR ELSE THAT WILL MAKE IT HELLA AWKWARD!!!!    or you can always do some cute pickup lines!!  like - excuse me, i think you dropped something - my jaw  or i lost my phone number can i borrow yours?  or   You must be a prizefighter. One look at you, and Im knocked out.   With my luck, youre probably here with someone.   Do you mind if I stare at you up close instead of from across the room?   Coast Guard regulations, Miss - I have to inspect you for sand mites. (on the beach)   I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.  Sorry, but you owe me a drink. [Why?] Because when I looked at you, I dropped mine.  Haha hope these work!|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Don't be so serious and just ask her something like "So, are you my .valentine?" See how it goes from there.  Watch her facial expressions|`|qi88afqYaa	Hint around it so that way if its a no you don't feel stupid. Good luck.
4PK0hiWeaa	He did assault you which is illegal but involving the police will undoubtedly create more strain and drama within the situation.  Your bro has some serious anger issues.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Stay away from him and I certainly hope you dumped Allison.  I know it will be hard but until your parents get back you have no protection from him.   Don't escalate the situation.  Don't talk to him about it or talk to Allison.  There is nothing to say to her.  She is a tramp, a liar, a cheat and doesn't deserve an ounce of your attention.  There is no excuse for what they did.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	I would tell your girlfriend you know, tell her what happened and wait untilyour parents come back to tell him. Getting the police involved could confuse things. Just in case, take pictures of any bruising or marks he did to you that you could use as evidence if you do go to the police. It's wrong that he did all of that to you and I hope this helps. Good luck :) x.x|`|64uyQ7jMaa	who cares... break up w/ ur gf and tell her what u know and the get back at ur bro someway who cares if he older fight back...|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	dump the girlfriend!!  Your brother is a loser who is going to find out someday that football players do not own the world and he can't just do what he wants.  Try to stay out of his way and ignore him as much as you can so that when he does something to really get in trouble - beating up on someone else, for example, you won't be involved or blamed.|`|lBvaknhmaa	SRY I THOUGHT I SAID IT WAS HIS GF  THAT FED UP TO CHEAT ON YOU
bQgxyxQSaa	Never know. Car accident happen everyday.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	It all depends on the person, their health, and circumstances.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I am a guy, but statistics show women outlive men.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	My mom will probably outlive my dad. My mom's side of the family, all the woman have outlived the men. Same with my dad's side of the family. I am very thankful that he is still around in his late 70's and I haven't lost him yet. I'm not ready for him to leave me...|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Generally, women outlive men but ultimately nobody really knows but GOD.  Be glad that you still have them and let them know you love them and appreciate all they do for you.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	My mom outlived my dad. My dad died in 1990 and was only 63. He had been in bad health for years. My mom died 2004 at 80 years old.
9WfMvFJqaa	i dont believe there is any point in dragging this up, all it will do is cause hurt for everyone. I know dealing with abortion is tough but u have two beautiful sons so you are truely blessed. Also i am a firm believer in the saying everything happens for a reason. Your husband will be racked with guilt knowing he wasnt there for you and you had to go through it all on your own. Although easier said that done try and forget it (of course you will never forget it) but believe it happened for a reason and enjoy your beautiful family! everone makes mistakes but you cannot change things that happened in the past. Good luck x x |`|Qk0cgst0aa	Your feelings are just that, "your feelings."  Why would you want to impose them on your husband?  It was your choice to do as you did.  It was right at the time.  Each and every moment unfolds just as it is supposed to.  How you deal with them is what makes you who you are.  Except that what you have done is for the best and let it go as that.  It is in the past and is only a memory.  You can't change it or make it anything other than what it is.  If you let the past guide your actions then you will be traveling in a constant circle.  Put it behind you and move forward into the life that you desire.|`|498tBpENaa	If you tell him you are going to feel better and the guilt is going to come out of you that you don't have a secret from him.  However, you are going to hurt him very badly.  He is going to be exteremly upset.  In addition, there is nothing he can do about it now.  So some secrets are kept untold.  Think to yourself , how is that going to help him.  it will help you and remove the guilt from you.  You were selfish once.  Don't be selfish again.|`|AvhJoL5baa	Please do not tell him.  Sometimes, ignorance is bliss, and this is certainly one of those times.  You would do well to figure out how to forgive yourself.|`|AA10561878	Don't do it.|`|bpjpD7W3aa	yes of course be honest|`|910b198e71ca8d3098c6121db6c23d2aaa	Sister,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry. There is healing and there is hope. My church has a ministry for those who have gone through abortion and seek forgiveness and closure. You may be able to find something similar at a church near you. I found this website regarding this issue (see below).<br>  <br>  This is not a burden you should carry alone. Remember that it takes 2 to get pregnant. Your husband should know and he should be given the opportunity to stand beside you and to grieve with you.<br>  <br>  We are all human and we all make mistakes. That is why God is God and we are not. Seek forgiveness and you shall receive it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forgivenme.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgivenme.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  |`|yy0LqCP4aa	Give yourself a break. You thought you two were broken up and you didn't want to raise a child alone. Perfectly understandable. Don't listen to all the rude comments, nobody really knows how you felt and what you were going through unless they went through the same exact thing. <br>  I think you should tell your husband, simply so you can get it out of you. Tell him like you put it in your question, that you didn't know what was going to happen. <br>  About the guilt, it's just something you have to live with. Everything we do has consequences, and you feeling guilty is yours. But you're not cruel because now you feel terrible about it. I know girls that have had abortions and they don't regret it one bit they don't even feel bad. That's being cruel.<br>  Your husband sounds like a good man i'm sure he will understand.|`|01aPMbP0aa	There is no way you could have known what would happen 2 years in the future.  You did what was best for you at the time.  Don't beat yourself up about it.  Let it go and move on.  The only thing you will accomplish by telling him is that your guilt will be better BUT what will it do for him?  Sometimes things are better left unsaid for all parties.  |`|CGwWnGnYaa	first of all, ask forgiveness from God.  next, forgive yourself and then gather the courage to tell him the truth.  then move on with your lives.  youre both happily married and thats what matters.  pray as a couple.  better yet, as a family.|`|hx9MbGrTaa	Do not make a deliberate attempt to do so. Still when this truth comes out from within you, just tell him. |`|b2MsWGSFaa	Don't tell him. Bygones is bygones. Look forward. <br>  <br>  Be happy, life have to move on..... :))|`|RjXmqFjCaa	You know your husband better than anyone so if you think he might be understanding and forgiving then by all means tell him, but if for some reason you think he will be upset and unforgiving may be you should try and talk to someone else like a professional first, just to get some better advice because in here your talking to a bunch of kids basically and to me this is a very sensitive situation that should be handled very very carefully. I know it would make you feel better to tell him straight out on your own but some men are really soft on the inside and something like this could change them in a very deep way. I wish you and your family all the best in the world.|`|Sj75G88paa	people at least once in there life do things that they will regret and have to live with the rest of there lives, if not then they aren't human. you were young and scared and i know you would take it back if you could. would telling him take the guilt and regret away, if not, then just let it go. that is in the past. now, like i said if it will make you feel better then you need to do it. but if not then i wouldn't. about your sisters, i would've listened to mine to because they are my best friends and i just listen to them. hope i was soe helpful.|`|xMvb2o29aa	I don't think you should say anything to him about it. He knows the child is gone and in heaven. He was upset about the loss and him thinking it was a miscarriage. I Think that if you tell him you had an abortion, he may not be able to handle that.  You need to forgive yourself and try and move on. Let yourself heel and TRY (I know that it is easier said than done) not to dwell on it anymore. You will drive yourself crazy if you keep beating yourself up over this. Like I said, I would not tell him since he already thinks it was a miscarriage and grieved over it. No point to bring it up again. Good luck,|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I agree with docmase... This is a hard situation, but I agree with him because your husband does have the right to grieve for this child as well. If the two of you have a strong relationship and you are able to open up with him I believe it will work out. I don't believe I would hold that against someone who was very sorry about it, as you are, but I don't know your husband or how he would react. I would tell him and go to counseling- I think telling him and grieving with him should be the first step to your recovery. You shouldn't have to grieve for the loss of your child by yourself!! |`|66l0BPhaaa	no you should not tell him, you was not with him when you did it, you was scared and did not know what to do. you did not want to do it alone. now you are together and married and blessed with two kids. you do not want him to look at you different after all this time. you will be fine. you told all of us, so you did get it off your chest.|`|nVbzfsvCaa	I'm pro-choice, but I also know that the man always gets screwed.  It takes two to tango and you should have discussed it with him.  It was his baby too.  Having said that, I would suggest that telling him would be the beginning of the end of your relationship.  Not today, not next year...but sometime down the road.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think you better leave it as it is there no point dragging this all up the child i believe is in heaven happy it a aw-full thing abortion and nearly every women regrets it <br>  Just look forward and forgive yourself just make sure your sis never tells that all <br>  maybe you should speak to someone about this to help you but the guilt no a reason to tell as it will hurt him and could break a other wise happy marriage|`|f8f4f22925140b23946ab7435265d4daaa	my dear girl, as painful and hurting as it is, what ever happened, happened... u both cried over it... its over.. it really is.. please dont tell him, u never know how he would react... everything's ok now.. please dont tell him|`|nv4QV1OVaa	What's the point? You telling him will completely change the dynamic of your relationship and how he views you. Live with your mistake but don't make him do it too.

I was in this situation before. Me and my man started our relationship at my houe (and no nothing happened for good few weeks), used to go out now and then, until i got really fed up of him coming around my house all the time, being more and more lazy, didn;t want to go out anymore, similar situation that u have. What you shoud do is TELL HIM how u feel, tell him that it makes u unhappy that u don't spend no more quality time together...If he is smart enough, he will try harder. If not then plan B which is BREAK. I have done it, told my man : Look, I tried to tell you but u wansnt listening, I am not happy and I need to think about us. Give him good few days alone and believe me you, he will be after you and trying hard!!!<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|If6dzIvZaa	you know the answer!|`|ubC1reIraa	honestly, the relationship just died out...that's all!!!<br>  it's been two years! you just got to bring the spark back into the relationship!!!<br>  maybe you should take him out?! hehe <br>  but good luck!!!|`|vJP6yTy3aa	he got what he wanted.|`|AA11399389	I think you need to have a talk with him about this.  Perhaps he does not realize that you want more than spending the night over at his house....Or perhaps that is ALL he wants is a sex partner, and you have become a willing participant up to this point.  Until you discuss this with him and see his reaction, you will not know why things took this turn.  If you stick to your guns and tell him there will be no intimate side of your relationship without a social aspect, you may get everything you want!  Communication is key to any lasting relationship.  Good Luck!|`|gSEYcN67aa	I think that its you always depend on guys like him that they should plan and prepare for everything. Maybe thats why he's wants to see you do something for awhile and stop relying on him paying or preparing for dates or for anything. One person cant do everything.|`|gAgsM6Y9aa	I agree with you, I think that he is using you. I think that you should dump him because he doesn't really appreciate you anymore.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like the sex must be good... or readily available...<br>  <br>  if you aren't happy, then tell him... 
AA11101968	$100K won't even cover college. Aim higher.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I would take it but I would put it in a high interest account where they cant touch it until they are 18 for college or 25 if they decided to not go to college. However I would still take him to court for monthly child support and add that to the account as it goes on. All of my daughters child support goes into a high interest account. What we get from the sob.|`|V4iZcrVmaa	TRY MORE MONEY|`|1k7LIZVWaa	I'd make him pay monthly anyway.  That way he couldn't buy out his share of the responsibility of being a parent.  I would hope that he would want to be involved in the child's life but from the description of him that you give, I don't think I would want him around influencing my child.  He has enough issues of his own to overcome.|`|OBCvewW2aa	No.  It's my child's birthright to benefit of his father's wealth.  If he's able to give me a lump sum of $100K- there's more where that came from.|`|4Pe8yZnuaa	If child support is $200 per month, $100,00 would equal almost 42 years of child support.  I think it's a no brainer to take the lump sum.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Take the offer you need it in these days and time.|`|AA11074785	Sure...but make sure if you sign anything that it includes a stipulation for the increase in cost of living as the child gets older since things cost more. Good luck!|`|34b40Vu3aa	yes, you could invest the $100,000 and get interest on that.  also, your $200 a month only comes to about $43,200 for 18 years.  So again, yes.|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Yes, I would. That would be guaranteed money that you could put into an online savings account to earn interest (while still taking out money when you need it) At $200 a month, you would only get $43,200.00 in 18 years. The $100,000.00 would equal $462.91 a month, not including the interest you could earn.|`|OntO6wE4aa	No. It isn't about the money as much as him being involved in your kids life. Just tell him to come up with some more reality money. Dreams don't buy food, clothes , and education.|`|hP7AiUyPaa	no i wouldnt take it because they are just paranoid of being stuck with child support if he left his kid then make it hard on him and dont take the child support away believe me i did it once!!!!|`|racnq84Vaa	If he has that, he has more.  So you need to hire an attorney who specializes in child support and have him investigate his assets and income and file for more support.  Never accept and offer that seems too good to be true, because 99 percent of the time it is.|`|LlZ2nhhFaa	If you get $200 per month for 18 years    200 x 12 x 18 = $43200    So on the surface it sounds worth it, as you get over double what you would normally get. But you have to bear in mind that that $200 per month will probably rise with inflation.    Though then bear in mind you could invest this $100,000 to (at least) keep up with the rate of inflation. Plus a lump sum puts you in control of the money, not your ex. Basically in this case it sounds worth it.
6uWGpl5faa	No I wouldn't mind.<br>  If my boyfriend thinks it smells good, then I'd try it :)<br>  I'm up for anything.|`|YJoSHof6aa	I wouldn't mind at all.  But note that not all perfumes smell the same on a person as they do on the bottle.  And the same perfume may smell GREAT on one person and totally stink on someone else.  This is because of our individual body chemistry.  I prefer to choose my own perfume for that reason but I would mind at all if my man brought me something he liked and wanted me to wear for him.  Just make sure what the return policy is, just in case. Good luck!|`|Qk58nIWCaa	Awh, if my boyfriend bought me anything other than a pint once in a while I would be happy! lol<br>  It's cute to buy each other little presents, especially if you thought it smelt good and the first thing you thought of was how it would smell on her.

My boyfriend bought me a perfume for my birthday 2 years ago and it has become my very favourite. I can understand that you're worried she may not like it or it may not suit her, but I think she'll still love the fact that you took the time and effort to pick it out yourself and you really like it. Lots of guys don't think of stuff like that. |`|AA11947878	I wouldn't mind. I'm a chanel girl....so I'd be hard pressed to give up my old stand by.

e9adf83d87be6ce67e66ff59ef0e4a91aa	To me cheating is emotional, physical and if your thoughts go to a huge extreme, to where you want to make them into actions, also mental. Intimate conversation, like saying "I love you", or "I miss you", or anything like that, would be cheating. Anything that I wouldn't like anyone doing to me while I'm in a relationship with them, I consider cheating. And of course all the physical stuff|`|Ic13HImWaa	cheating is of course the obvious sex and kissing. but i also believe cheating is having intimate conversations, talking about kissing another person is not right. if you really want to kiss or have sex with another person then you are emotionally cheating.|`|CQ2XnlAtaa	All of the above.<br>  <br>  All of those are intimate (and I don't <br>  mean it by sex only) moments between<br>  two.<br>  <br>  They're sacred,<br>  and should be shared by only two.<br>  <br>  Not three, four, or maybe 15.|`|gu4pwW7uaa	cheating is wen u actually have sex with another person|`|EOkOPBMuaa	I generally think anything that you wouldn't be comfortable with your other doing, don't do it yourself. Obviously anything past kissing or further is definitely cheating but I think you are still crossing a line if you get into "intimate conversation". Flirting is one thing but once your actually talking about sex, thats gone too far.|`|o0b6Ha49aa	I think you know that all of what you have put is cheating, people know when they cheat but like to think they are not and that their wistle is clean. Cheating is cheating no matter what way you look at it.|`|FgSTHArKaa	cheating is anything you would not do if your gf/bf was around<br>  so if your spouse was not there then the things you do knowing they arent there and knowing that they would get mad at you if they were is definitely considered cheating.|`|upIrlDm5aa	unless your in the same area codes it isnt cheating......when in a relationship i think its cheating when their is kissing or any other intimacy between the others two|`|7Daq3CVjaa	Everything you just mentioned is cheating|`|3xPGt15kaa	all of the above my man better not kiss another woman touch Sex or any of that it should be done with me and me only|`|TaTCbLSzaa	personally i think cheating is when youve been with someone longterm and all these things that you listed are done to them|`|QM2cQ9Ogaa	All the above as you only do this with our bf/gf or husband/wife

JDTnFqONaa	Unless you are blood related i dont think it matters.<br>  I dated my Uncles wifes(aunt) Brother.<br>  We werent blood related.<br>  And it lasted for 2 years.<br>  I think u should go for it!<br>  GoodLuck!<br>  |`|dPiDypAlaa	I think if there is no blood tie, as in she or you is a step or adopted somewhere along the lines, then you should be okay.  But it sounds to me like if its a normal family tree she is related by blood, you just aren't seeing the connection.  Your uncles brother should be your dad's brother which would mean that she is your cousin.  HOWEVER...if it is your dad's sisters husbands brothers daughter u should be fine.|`|Q37YNI68aa	Your uncles brother is your other uncle dude...<br>  <br>  Which makes this girl either your sister (Since your father is also one of your uncles brothers)<br>  <br>  Or your first cousin....unless there is a marriage somewhere in there...You are related by blood.<br>  Either way you are too closely related.|`|Ua2H3VtTaa	Is he your uncle by marriage?

It really screwed up things in my family.|`|nUrd6eKpaa	So your auntie is related to you i guess. You can ask her out, and your kinda like family, not blood though, so it actually would bring the family more closer to each other. So i say go for it.

Go for it, just dont be worried by this.|`|gNghGb1Haa	go ahead no blood no problem i just had family who were step cousins to get married|`|fdfa77b9b8991d569ef8e42743d4df39aa	What's the question?|`|NLKVrdIKaa	If I  understand this dilemma she would have to be  your uncles brothers daughter with the uncle being by marriage ,Right? O.K. go for it. if there is no blood kin then in my opinion it's O.K.|`|f4doqdSCaa	Is your uncle... your uncle by marriage? (Like, is he married to your blood-related aunt?). If so, yes, you're correct, you are in no way related, if she is your uncles daughter from another relationship (i.e. not your aunt's daughter). If you like her and she likes you, I say hang out with her a bit more and ask her out.|`|7KCNxW5Naa	Your uncle is related by blood. His brother is related to you by blood.<br>  She is related to them by blood also. Unless your uncle is a step uncle, or in other words your dad is a step dad, you really are related by blood.<br>  <br>  That being said, If there are no marriages separating the blood line, that would make her your cousin, While it might be fun in your mind. It's illegal to get married to her because she's a first cousin.|`|0gVuMgeMaa	hahahahaha wow<br>  your uncles brother..<br>  kae for one, say its your moms brother that's your uncle(the one your talking bout here)<br>  if the girl you likes dad is your uncles brother<br>  that means he is also your moms brother which means he is also your uncle<br>  and that means the girl you like is you first cousin<br>  do that math...|`|wAoNbpVlaa	dude leave it alone, shes apart of your family no matter what.

xKZzScJ8aa	You do have to have 2 witness (you don't have to know them), but other than that, no one else has to know.|`|JwXNwTTsaa	You have to have atleast 1 witness besides the priest/pastor|`|Wzws8v8daa	nope you also need 2 people to witness your marraige and they need to sign your marriage license to make it legal.|`|w95Tm763aa	yes you have to get a license adn they would know but no you don't have to inform friends or family or even post it in the paper|`|AA10561878	No you'll need a witness.|`|njDZg2uFaa	yes secret weddings|`|0rAgtGNgaa	just need a witness doesnt matter who, can be someone off the streets.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Yes. There generally has to be witnesses, but they can be strangers. |`|woOeYFrEaa	If you do it legally and file a wedding license, that license is a matter of public record.  So if someone wanted to do a search, they could find out.  I even got ads in the mail from companies geared towards newlyweds because they monitored the public record, trying to sell their services to people newly married.<br>  <br>  I think you could probably keep it from your families but if they were suspicious and wanted to do a little research they could easily find out.  I live in Texas and my county even posts the wedding licenses online.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Yes, unless other people do some digging because marriages are public records.  <br>  I know for a fact that in Virginia witnesses are not required - so the folks who are saying otherwise are incorrect (but I don't know of any other state that doesn't require witnesses).<br>  <br>  The couple signs the marriage license and the officiant the certificate and thats it - you're married!<br>  <br>  <br>  "Miscellaneous: There is no statutory requirement that witnesses be present at the marriage ceremony."<br>  <br>  Source (also, I got married in VA so I know first-hand): <br>  <a href="http://www.usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/virginia/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usmarriagelaws.com/search/uni...</a>|`|GWRP3vLQaa	No, there have to be two witnesses. Why would you want to marry someone and not want anyone to know? |`|x6wbH8ahaa	You do have have 2 witnesses but why not have friends and family you may regret it.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	You need witnesses. But, initially, aside of the witnesses and whoever does the service, you can do it without anyone knowing. BUT- it will be recorded in public record BY LAW. So if anyone wants to find out, it will not be very hard for them to figure it out eventually. They just have to go to the county clerk and look at the marriage records. You can't hide a marriage forever. But if you're just trying to keep people away while you do the deed, it is very doable so long as you pick the right witnesses and official to pull it off. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p9t0Xpm3aa	Yeah you can. I mean, you have to have witnesses. But if you go to a courthouse, they provide the minister and witnesses to sign the certificate. Although, I'm curious why you wouldn't want anyone to know?|`|uXeGsxSVaa	You need 2 witnesses to legally register the marriage and also you need to submit your documents through government officials, but if you don't want your family and friends to know just get  two witnesses|`|cIJ960Wbaa	Yes like if you elope and go to one of those little las vegas marriage places as long as somewhere there can sign as your witness you are good to go.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Sure just go down to the courthouse. Or run away to Vegas for the weekend. |`|IMVEv4dqaa	Sure, except you have to have 2 witnesses. Though, I also think it is public record if ppl decided to get tricky...|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	They need 2 witnesses so no|`|Bsf78pfsaa	yes my friend just did it takes planning 
2JJLYSAKaa	If I hear or suspect that someone is two-faced, talking bad about me or something, I will never - repeat NEVER - let on that I know something or suspect something to anyone.  Not even my "friends".   You never know when these friends will become enemies.  In fact, your closest trusted friends can become your worst enemies.  You trusted them with secrets and personal info and some unscrupulous people will use everything they can against you.    Your "suspected or proven" enemies on the other hand are not concealing their contempt for you.  If you keep them close, you keep a close eye on them.  You know what they are up to.   You can feed them false information.   You can also learn a lot from your enemies.    I don't know if this even comes close to answering your question, but I agree with this in work and in life.|`|AA10392041	That is a good question.  The people, your friends, should be close to you. Your enemies will burn you in the end.  Also throw in your family, because it turns out that sometimes you get better help from a stranger.|`|58jwkbbSaa	I love it (:  You should keep your enemies closer, because you can always be there for revenge later on.|`|I0O385V7aa	Lol, that's a slightly outdated phrase, though I guess it still exists in the sort of top classes of society.    It just involves treating your enemies like friends. This is usually for some horrible, b*tchy reason- i.e. to find out an enemy's secret so you can leak it and then ruin them.    All I would do is just pretend to be friend of an enemy. Of course, there's nothing you can do if the enemy expresses their hatred for you openly. But if they don't know you hate them, you have the advantage in the situation.|`|AA11441704	this I don't understand.........|`|lGS1zOd6aa	always know what your enimies next move will be|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Awesome question!  Best I've seen in a long while.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	I think it should be the other way around. Keeps your enemies close but your friends closer. Friends are your worst enemies!|`|USn04b4Paa	there are many answers to this question and maybe for me i would hope by keeping them close they have a chance to change there mind about me
b549549b5e32a3e3dc5b139dc3b74e44aa	You just answered your own question. When your older you usually are'nt as shy. Also some younger girls play games.

rb05Vuvfaa	I don't think there is an unbeatable way that will work every time.  Probably just let her talk without trying to fix her problems.  Men always want to fix things.

Set a mood, create a peaceful environment you can have good conversation & show her that you're capable of looking after her.<br>  <br>  Just generally making a fuss or her, showing you care, can listen and don't give her reason to nag at you.

I think he didn't want to get into the whole dating thing right there because he thought it might have been awkward for you and him. Spend more time with him and he should ask you out.|`|0ENPu8gDaa	I would move on. Why waste your time on someone who if confusing you by the second and that you have to put together like a jigsaw puzzle, rather than someone new you'll stumble upon. You never know.|`|SaUkM7Usaa	Well most guys don't usually like admitting to liking a girl in front of other guys so that's part of it.

ONPsujh2aa	If she is serious about your relationship,she might not want to talk about a future in case YOU don't want that...  she may be worried about feeling rejected if you don't respond when she mentions something about marriage,or moving somewhere together.Slight hints like,talking about what you would want to name your kids,asking her what she would name hers..  if she doesnt respond,or it's not a very light response then that is a bad sign.  Its better to be open with a girl though,we spend half our time trying to work guys out,whilst they are working us out,if we just all talked about everything we wouldnt have to ask questions on here.|`|nMSV2kcVaa	SIT HER DOWN AND TELL HER U GUYS NEED TO TALK SERIOUS AND OPENLY. LAY OUT THE FACTS, TELL IT LIKE IT IS. ASK HER WHAT SHE THINKS, SHE'LL OPEN UP. . .|`|WwCBomTMaa	Wow, this is a question that causes some deep thought. My suggestion to you is just ask her. The problem with most relationships is lack of communication. If you ask her and she tells you no, don't push the issue, just move on and look for MS. Right. If she tells you yes, then you need to ask yourself if you are really serious about her. Then the next step is for you to decide.
AA11599430	stop the games and move on|`|Rq3KgTxMaa	If you like to get to know him better, be straight forward. Say that you don't like people who don't honor others, and the "game" he is a playing is disrespectful to you. If he wants this relationship to work, then he gotta change.     This is what i do when girl flakes or play ball with me. My time is important, i don't intend to waste my time on people who has second class behavior.|`|Z5A33IR3aa	and you were romeo when the flashbacks started|`|son2d5G1aa	Do you see him any during the day? If so, ask him about it!|`|9pYEHVHPaa	Uhhh sorry, but he is just not that into you, period. Move on and find someone who doesn't make you guess. And you should be out of patience. I would have been when he didn't say anything for 4 days!|`|6mVpfmR6aa	It depends on how much you like him,     but it seems that you may not be that meaningful to him.|`|TLgWwxN1aa	stop playing games unless u like him|`|nWGgaQdhaa	he's obviously not serious, so id say forget about him. you deserve better.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Just leave him alone. Dont make yourself look like a fool.
naequcqlaa	Best way to not drive yourself nuts is not to even talk to him or even let him know you give a hoot about him.  Like he doesn't exist!  If that doesn't get him, at least you're not driving yourself crazy for nothing!  Let it be known that you're not worried about him anymore.  It w/either make it or break it.  At least you'll know where you stand, but you won't be driving yourself nutso on a daily basis....think about it!...Good luck to you...:)|`|AA10942089	I think in this case you need to be direct with your friend and find out what's going on. You may not like the answer you get, but at least you'll have a better idea on what the situation is.|`|JuNf9cnJaa	If your friend has been ignoring you, then it doesn't seem like they're being a very good friend?  I would get in contact with this "friend" and set this situation straight, let him know that his ignoring you doesn't go unnoticed!  Tell him that is really bothers you he would just "stop talking" for no reason, and without an explanation.  Even if it was legitimate, he should STILL explain to you so your mind doesn't wonder thinking YOU did something.  Tell him your not a mind reader, and communication is crucial if he is trying to get a message across.
rwbUF975aa	Just as you're hurting, I'm sure she's hurting inside for what she's doing. Believe me, if she gets all angry when you all mention it to her, that means she really cares about you all. I think soon she'll have to make a tough decision as to whom she wants to spend most of her time with. Don't push her too far. She will come to a decision very soon. Give it some time. Don't ignore her. Make her feel welcome all the time she wants to be with you all.|`|S253XERKaa	get a life of your own get a girlfriend|`|030f9f4c7056257d78f782e46f684510aa	because you cant spell|`|7J1ub9Yraa	I think you should just sit her down and tell her whats up. You know? Cause I have had that same problem with my best friend. She would put her boyfriend before her friends and that's not cool at all. I get where your coming from. Just sit her down face to face and tell her your problem. Cause what she's doing is not cool at all. You never ever put a boy or girl befor your friends.|`|NYwoG13Haa	My Best friend ditched me because a down right ***** said I was annoying. I was really upset but I didn't tell her that. I just acted normally and my best friend was best friends with me again and now the ***** is on her own!! If your friend likes this boy then support her.

You can save tons of money this way.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	Ask to make payments where you can, try craigslist for wedding items people resell what they didn't use or is left over.

Keep your guest list down. Way down. A wedding of 50 will be much cheaper than 100.<br>  <br>  2. Don't have flowers other than bouquets and boutonnieres. Have lots and lots of candles as centerpieces. Personally, I think candles make a stronger statement than flowers anyway. It's more unexpected.<br>  <br>  3. You don't need a DJ. We're not having one. We're creating playlists on our iPod via iTunes and letting it run during our reception.<br>  <br>  4. Get a small decorated cake for appearances and then have your baker provide sheet cakes in the same flavor, which will be kept in the kitchen where no one can see them. This will save you a lot.<br>  <br>  5. Bargain hunt for your dress. Try eBay and used gown boutiques. I purchased my gown at a used boutique and paid $400 less than retail price and it was in perfect condition. Also, look for white dresses at department stores. They'll be much less than bridal dresses.<br>  <br>  6. Just serve appetizers, dessert and drinks at your reception if you can't afford a full meal.<br>  <br>  7. See if you can have your ceremony and reception all at one venue. Often, all inclusive places like hotels are less expensive in the long-run because they provide the tables, chairs, linens, china, etc.<br>  <br>  8. Have your reception at a covered area in a state park. You'll only have to pay for the permit, which is usually around $100 for the day, and have your favorite restaurant cater the food. Or have the reception AT your favorite restaurant (many have banquet rooms).|`|x8rYunYeaa	ok well to start with...that also means you have 6 months to get more money as well<br>  you won't need a big area if its 50 people<br>  find a friend who is a florist..they're everywhere<br>  your fiance's mom has some of the food and stuff costs covered<br>  you don't have to have that much<br>  like go to subway and get that big sandwich tray or something and that'll feed about 20...get 2 of those and some other food<br>  maybe you could just have your reception at a park<br>  i know that the bay area has a LOT of really nice parks<br>  make it maybe a natural theme, ya know?<br>  it saves a lot of money and the wedding is still amazing and beautiful|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Flowers: Buy them at a market or wholesaler and arrange them yourself. Can be something simple like:<br>  <a href="http://www.wedding-flowers-guide.com/images/pink-orchid.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wedding-flowers-guide.com/ima...</a><br>  <br>  Decorations: Thats covered by flowers, but if you choose a place that is naturally beautiful to begin with then you don't need to worry.<br>  <br>  Reception room: Conside open air outside or look at community centres and town halls in your area. Most only require a small fee and to be cleaned afterwards.<br>  <br>  Table and chair rentals: Look around and tell vendors when you have gotten a better quote, most will meet or beat it. Even better hire a hall that already has these and you just need to set them up.<br>  <br>  DJ: Advertise for a DJ on craigslist. again tell them how much you want to pay and if you have gotten a better quote tell them that as well.<br>  You could also do the ipod playlist thing.<br>  <br>  Favours: A hersheys kiss or 3 is cheap and appreciated. Wrap them in tissue in your theme colour ($1 for 10 HUGE sheets)<br>  <br>  Food: Ask what party platters your local supermarket can do. Also consider foods that can be made in advance and are cheap like lasagne.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	Oohh... I feel you on this one.  I live in the Bay Area and when we got engaged, I literally cried when I started to try to plan a wedding here.  We ended up booking a place back in Arkansas (where I'm from)!  That being said:  There is a beautiful church and reception site in the Presidio.  I think the church is called "Church of Our Lady" and it's small and really pretty.  Tons of free parking and right down the street from two very reasonably priced reception sites.  You can find wedding and bridesmaid dresses, wedding centerpieces, vases, candles, etc. on craigslist.com  You should really check it out - they have great stuff on there.  I would also suggest making the invites yourself.  You can get DIY kits from Target, Michaels craft store, and even Wal Mart.  They also have tons of party favors and things you can do yourself.  I would try to do as much of the flowers yourself as you can - think Costco for flowers or the San Francisco Flower Mart on 8th Street and Brannan (or Bryant).  They have GREAT deals on beautiful flowers, as long as you are willing to do some of it yourself.  I would go to local dollar stores, Michaels craft store, or Wal Mart and get vases, hurricanes, candles, etc.  You'd be surprised what you can find.  <br>  <br>  I'm at a loss for a DJ though.  :)  Hope the rest helps!  |`|di6p10Ifaa	talk to a bed and breakfast they often have great deals on wedding packages for small yet romantic weddings. We are paying $950 for 5hrs tables linens silverwear chairs plates fresh flowers centerpeices a jp(we are not using him but it comes with the package) and they clean up. The provide all of that!! so just look around you can have an affordable wedding and still be the wedding of your dreams!!|`|iYWHCNhCaa	Elope |`|oWLe7TNIaa	1. Check out a wholesale flower distributor for flowers.  Take a class from your local community college on floral arranging with someone who wants to help you plan- a friend, your FMIL, etc to include them.  Then you can arrange your own flowers!<br>  <br>  2. For music, buy an ipod (or borrow one) and rent a few large speakers from a local rental place.  You may have a friend or two with some if they're in bands.  Put your favorite songs on it and put someone in charge of monitoring it at the wedding- maybe a teenage cousin or someone in that age bracket.  An ipod on shuffle probably won't cause any problems, but have to keep someone on guard in case.<br>  <br>  3. Lots of people never take the favors.  Order enough for 75% of the crowd you plan to have and leave them on a table in the entrance or near the bathrooms.  My cousin made CDs with their favorite songs on them as favors for everyone and printed labels saying "Davey & Jodee xx/xx/2003."  We were nearly last to leave and lots of CDs still were there.<br>  <br>  4. I belong to a really small church (under 150 members), but they have tons of tables and chairs for their events.  Find out if the church you're having your wedding at has similar tables and chairs and see if you'd be allowed to borrow some of them.  Also if you know anyone beloning to a local masonic lodge or scottish rite, they often have tables and chairs you can borrow for free too- as long as you know a member.<br>  <br>  5. Each week in the Sunday paper there are usually ads for craft stores for 40-50% off one item- not sure if it's the same in CA but we have JoAnn Fabrics and Michael's craft stores here.  Start cutting them out and buy one decoration per week.  <br>  <br>  Those are my best ideas, good luck!|`|woOeYFrEaa	The biggest way I saved money with my wedding:<br>  1) The wedding was at 2 so no one was expecting a meal.  I had cake and some heavy appetizers.  Food/catering is often the most expensive part of a wedding.  If you don't care about doing a big sit-down dinner, plan a mid-afternoon wedding so you can get away with cake and a couple of fruit/veggie/cheese platters.<br>  2) Decorations: I got married at a pretty church.  I did nothing for the sanctuary at all.  Those huge floral vases cost hundreds of dollars.  I didn't see the point.<br>  3) DJ: I paid my ceremony piano player an extra hundred dollars to stay and play "mood music" during the reception.  That or an ipod connected to a speaker will save you a lot of money there.<br>  4) Favors: Not necessary.  Some people do them, I never miss them when they're not there.  We did some photo magnets that cost us $20 for our wedding of 100 people.<br>  <br>  Just decide what's most important to you about your wedding celebration and budget from there.  I spent a disproportionate amount of money on photography because to me that's what was most important...not to have food people raved about for weeks, or breathtaking flowers, but to have some great pictures that captured my family and the joy I had on the day.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!  I was an April bride this year.  I went with tulips for all the flowers--cheaper than roses and in season and very spring-y.<br>  <br>  
zzUgYFy4aa	WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Why do you want to say it in front of your parents????????????????<br>  seems like that is something very private and intimate<br>  keep your love bird thoughts and words between the both of you<br>  your parents do not need a SHOW..... Like WHOA!|`|LwsxvZkqaa	well my husband is right above  me but i said love you to him and my mom was like what don't say that i was 17 at the time and know i am 18 but once she got to know him she liked him and she said o yea he is cool put yes after that she never said nothing to me  it just depends on your parents and how they fell about you havening a boyfriend my husband and i  have been saying love you for 2 years and he still douse  not say it around his mother  put i am ok with it because i know how she.  just be careful around your parents and yes if you love eachother just say it but be careful and LOVE  is a strong word so be careful and don't get hurt <br>  <br>   good luck|`|9add5681cfda445e14f0619bfa7dd7f1aa	dont say it in front of your parents. that will be awkard for them and you. im 18 and i have been dating my fiance for two yrs now and i still havent said it in front of my mom. my mom is a bit conservative so i wouldnt dare do that. lol to your parents you are still there baby girl so if you were to say that then they would like there baby is trying to grow up to soon.<br>  <br>  however it depends on how comfortable you are with your family and how open your parents are. if you are in love then it shouldnt matter who hears you express your love for one another as long as you two hear it from each other.

It was a rush back then. I'm 21 almost 22 now and I wish I could go back to the days of sneaking out but now I come and go out of the house as I please and my mom knows. So it doesn't make it much fun and interesting anymore

Wc6tNOEeaa	well, i reckon that maybe different positions would be better for you :). like you on top or, him tucking his elbows under your knees, lifting you up and then start penetrating this way he can go deeper. maybe him coming more out then in as in like, him moving out more than it, because the rubbing of his penis against you clitoris is what feels really good|`|jps9NR3xaa	sounds like he needs to buy a pump or get some of those pills...thats a serious answer too...|`|AA10561878	get to know your body|`|1JpraGwUaa	I'm the same age, and I have the same problem with my boyfriend.  I don't know what it could be either.  The bad thing is that we get started, and it feels good, but after a minute or two, I just wish it was over because I'm not feeling anything at all.  I mean, I feel something really good once in a while, but most of all, it's just nothing really.<br>  <br>  Are you on any medications?  I'm on Zoloft, and I hear that this can decrease the sex drive, which might be my problem.
Jsvvm4qsaa	Haha i just answered a Q like this. <br>  Okay since he's taller than you, arms should deff be under tha arms. Perfume is a good idea [right behind the ears..but not too much] make sure you pull him a little close, but nothing stalker that's gonna make him think "wtf?" about 2-4 seconds? && don't worry about saying anything|`|dQHgcx4daa	hahaha, don't kiss him on the cheek in the hallways. He won't look at you for a week.<br>  <br>  Wrap your arms all the way around him and give an extra squeeze at the end. This guy I'm in a similar situation with hugs me like that and I swoon everytime. Haha.<br>  <br>  ps. my boy is also quite tall. 6'3 - 6'4? I'm 5'3. Hahahaha.|`|EhJlgKLAaa	personally i think you can only really say things through a kiss.. just kiss him on the cheek he'll get the idea.

mvKDbb2uaa	Are you seriously considering staying in this marriage?!    It's not about who changes who or whether or not you're a bar person.  It's about taking responsibility for your family.    You owe it to yourself AND your kids to provide a loving and stable environment.  If your husband can't quit drinking and won't put you and the kids first, why would you comprise?  You're not going to win this one and even if you changed to become more like him, in the end it won't work.  It's not at all embarrassing to work full-time to support you and your children--that's what MOST people do.  This is a sacrifice that you make when you have kids.  What's embarrassing is neglecting your family in order to be more like your partying husband.    I don't even think it's worth begging and pleading because he clearly does not care.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Ask yourself - what's better for the kids? Is it better for then to grow up in a dysfunctional home, with a mother who's miserable and a father who doesn't give a rat's a&& about the family? Marriage is not the end in and of itself - marriage is only a means to a good, happy and stable life for you, your partner and your kids. IMO, this is precisely what your marriage doesn't offer, and, personally, I just don't see the point in hanging on to marriage simply for the sake of being married. It's like insisting on getting a paint job on a car that doesn't run, and then lament that you have no means to drive to work. What you need to do instead is ditch the POS car and get a vehicle that can drive you places. You'll be much better off in the long run. The point is not "having a car", the point is having a car that runs. The point is not "being married", the point is having a partner who is your best friend, who makes your life better, who takes responsibility for the family, who sets a good example for the kids. What you, yourself, choose to do would really be up to you - if you wanted to turn into a bar fly just to stay with your husband, fine - but now you have kids to think about, and if your husband won't take responsibility for thinking about the children, you are the one who has 100% of that responsibility, and it's no longer an option to make selfish choices if they hurt the kids. Staying with this man can hurt the kids in the long run. Kids emulate what they see, and you don't want them to grow up witnessing a dysfunctional relationship.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The problem is that this isn't going to save your marriage.  It's just going to create a different reason for you to be unhappy.    Marriage doesn't mean compromising your morals and values.  He's treating you badly and you are changing to make it ok.  IT's not.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I stopped reading half way through. He said hes happy, and your vomitting, end this, your heatlh and sanity is worth more. Its sounds like your afriad you will never find anyone. You found him didnt you? Next time you know what to look for in a man. Good luck,just pack and go. Being alone is not the part to fear ok, its how long can your withstand such unhappiness. Get a tough skin, serisously, make yourself just push forwrad to a new and better place. You can do it millions of women do. Get the legal seperation going, if he runs out and maxs out all the credit cards it will be part of the divorce, so all debts as of the moment are the only ones you want to have to list and be a part of. Reason for divorce, alchol abuse, plain simple, and its a winner.|`|AA10986891	I don't get why you want to throw away all your morals and probably your kids welfare and happiness to fight for a marriage that won't work unless that man  admits he has a problem and makes the conciuss effort to change and shape up his life.    If you decide to stay and fight for your marriage you will be misserable and your kids will if you are. You can not save your marriage if your husband can not admitt that there is a problem and you need to work together to solve it.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Its wrong to NOT put your kids first, your are the only mother they will ever have. If your not comfortable going out and drinking then don't. Look, you only get one chance with kids and if you start putting them aside to satisfy your husband then your only hurting them and yourself in the long run.  Sometimes we women put up with guys for too long, his family will only take his side since he's their son and also they don't want to interfere. I say, he either changes or he doesn't. No one will ever have a perfect marriage, their has to be compromise, but going out to bars is not good. why can't he drink at home. Now if he's getting drunk all the time then theres  defenetily a problem. Make the move, and take your kids if he still doesn't change then so be it. Why should you change for him, if he's not changing for you and your kids. What sort of an example and legacy will you teach your kids? How would you  want them to be treated by their partners in a relationship when their older, they learn from us and  we show them how to be treated by example. Your values run deep, and they were there when he married you, its probobly one of the reasons why he did.  Follow your instincts, if you suspect something its probobly true to some extent. Good luck.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	This has nothing to do w/ morals and values...he is a jerk and is treating you like crap!  Ever heard 'I can do bad all by myself'?  yeah...|`|QzWHMGHJaa	I'd go to a few Al-anon meetings before you make a decision.  You end up sicker than the person who's sick, if you know what I mean.  I think a few of these meetings and reading one of their books will help you and help you make a decision that will be right for you.  There are plenty of people in the same boat as you and it's nice to have them to talk to.  Good luck!|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I think any route you chose, you are going to be miserable.  You should not let your beliefs or morals go to sh*t to save your marriage... no, I think that is very wrong.  This is your husbands "core" personality... and trying to change that is next to impossible.  He is happy... you are miserable.....and you will remain that way.  Going to work and dropping your kids off at daycare is only going to compound your misery.  I think you really need to do some thinking here sweetie... and decide if this is what you want for the rest of your life.  You don't need to be a martyr to anyone...especially a husband who seems to have little love or caring or respect for you.  Your choice... but I do know what my choice would be.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	So the problem is he goes to bars?  How often does he go? Does he come home completely trashed? Does he stay out to late? Totally ignore people because he's busy getting dunk?      You two shouldn't try to "change" each other. No marriage will work if either partner feels like the other needs to "change."    That said, I don't see what the big deal is, him going to a bar, unless he's doing it EVERY night, and missing work/ seriously neglecting the family because of it.     People drink. People need time to get away from things (including family) occasionally. I mean, if he's getting DUIs and staying out all night, and leaving the kids in strange places because he was too busy getting drunk, then yeah, that's too much, but if he just goes out and has a few drinks on weekends, then what's the problem? I don't know what you mean by "bar person" but lots of people go to bars. It's fun.|`|B6dOsHBiaa	It sounds like there are two issues going on - he wants you to accompany him out to bars AND an issue of you going to work and placing children in daycare.    If being in bar makes you so uncomfortable that the very thought makes you vomit... wow. Why would you even consider it? If it makes you that sick and you feel it goes against your personal moral code - don't do it. I kind of get the feeling from the language you used in your question that you may be giving in to be a martyr and use that card later on. I may be wrong, but the tone and some of your comments just leave that impression.     As for you being embarassed to "being thought of as someone who dumps my kids off and skips off to work"... another wow. Judge much? It may not be for you, but again your tone implies you look down on women who work full time and need to use child care services.    Best of luck with your husband. I hope you can find a comfortable middle road solution for both of you.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I was married to an alcoholic for 7 years; so I know just how hard it is to try to make a marriage work out. I'm sorry to hear you are going through this.    Listen....I know you are a good person. And I know you want to try to save your marriage. BUT ...God doesn't want to see you become a bitter and miserable woman, either.     It takes "two to tango" for a marriage to work out; and if your husband is not only not helping, but rather causing the problems with his drinking and partying and irresponsability, you cannot be expected to stay there and raise healthy kids. (People who think the woman should stay in an abusive and toxic marriage "for the kids' sakes" or "because that is what marriage is about" are wrong and cruel.)    Do not do anything that will compromise your mental or emotional or physical health and well-being. You need to be OK and to think rationally; your kids need you. They are small and vulnerable; you need to be strong for them.     So be smart...and do what is right: LEAVE this man and contact your family. Ask for support and do whatever you need to do so you are away from him and from the problems and stress he causes.     I know it's hard; but it can be done. I did it...and took my kid to my mother's house many years ago. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Many people are in your same situation, and they decide to step out of it. You can do it if you decide you really want a better life for you and your kids.    A healthy marriage is worth saving. But a toxic one, where drinking and emotional abuse happens, is not. So think about this, and ask God to guide you and heal you.     DO NOT try to stay with a man who clearly does not love you or your kids enough. It's better to live alone and in peace, than to be in this kind of situation.    You will be in my prayers.|`|AA12037013	Do not turn against your core values!!    Ideas    Have a date night..where you both go out..   If he choses to drink you are the sober driver.    If you go to his way this is what could happen..  you both get so drunk that if you make it home you are both passed out while the children are up fending for themselves in the home or outside.     They grow up to think it is ok to behave this way too shince mom AND date both do it.    They do not learn any ethics or morals because they were not taught any and grow up to be a menus to society.    OR>>>>>>>>>>    You continue to raise them in the ways that are right and let the husband go.|`|521041d52a46b112c25727367e1164beaa	the only person you can change is you. And why would you want to change who you are to be unhappy. I am a firm believer in working on your marriage, but throwing your morals and values out the window to do so doesn't seem like the right thing to do IMO. Don't change who you are to please someone that is going to treat you like a door mat. You have your children to think of, and what example is being set if they see their father drink all the time and their mother not doing anything about it. You left once and survived. I don't think you should become like someone you dislike to the point of making yourself sick just to please him.   I have always worked, but i made sure my children knew i loved them and I would always be there for them. Be you, because that is the person your children will be proud of. and I think in the end you will be proud of you also.
yHPsQbpqaa	Because men are honest about that  stuff  ,you women should learn from us when it comes to that kinda stuff. NO secrets no Bullshit.|`|GbQ6zGuZaa	maybe he wanna brag
kHEp4OnYaa	Um yeah, he has to be a work at 5 freaking AM! Im sorry but let that dude get some sleep.|`|trERH3oBaa	There is no way for us to know. This is no way to live. You guys have to change your lifestyle.|`|mMrl2aFuaa	If you don't trust him you should leave him.<br>  <br>  After working all day a man has the right to be tired. Some people can stay up all night, others enjoy their sleep.|`|wvDphFRQaa	tell him how u feel like and i think u should be warned and cautious <br>  of his actions and changes|`|yyh4rz1Laa	Girl you were talking on the phone for over and hour. Most guys don't like to hang on the phone that long, and if he has to get up at 5:00am to go to work cut him some slack why don't you.<br>  This is why most young relationships don't work. The girl is usually not always but usu sally the first one to start getting jealous and passive, wanting to be up the guys *** 24/7 . I have 2 sons one is 20 the other 16 both of them have told me many times why they try to stay away from having one girlfriend.<br>  There reason. Girls want to talk on the phone too much, they get mad if they hang out with there  friends sometimes and not them, they question everything they  do and where they  go, there always calling on the phone every second looking for them. They have too much drama with them. <br>  So if you want to keep this boyfriend lay low a little bit. Give him the benefit of the doubt that he is tired and has to get up early for work.. Don't show him that you have doubts that you may not trust him. He will pick up on that and you may lose him.
5t73ngvCaa	Hola Monita,<br>  <br>  aquí estoy nuevamente para darte un consejo.<br>  Si estás segura de tus sentimientos... adelante! En ningún momento te vi dudar con respecto a esto, lo que ya de por sí es una buena se?al.<br>  <br>  No tengas miedo por algo que todavía no viviste ni experimentaste... si se lo expresas así a él, de veras pensará que no quieres que vaya... Que lo hayas conocido por internet, no significa que el susodicho te vaya a enganar!!! Además dale una chance al pobre, si ni siquiera te ha dado pruebas de que es infiel ni cosa por el estilo!<br>  No le des de entrada mal puntaje, dale la oportunidad de mostrarse tal como es, y verás si realmente sus sentimientos son puros con respecto a tí. Y sobre todo, si él es la persona que estás esperando. Y si no lo es... bueno, tampoco es el fin del mundo!<br>  <br>  Además, si no pruebas, nunca sabrás si la relación funcionará o no! Que el vaya a tu país no significa que quedarán pegados para siempre, ni que formarán una simbiosis inseparable, ni que tomarás un camino sin salida. Dénse un tiempo para visitarse las veces que sea necesario, para conocerse, tú tomate todo el tiempo que necesites para estar segura, es tu derecho, comiencen una relación sana, y el tiempo dirá... no tienes que decir hoy por hoy que este chico será el definitivo. <br>  <br>  Tal vez tus amigos te digan lo que te dicen porque consideran que es muy poquito tiempo el que se conocen. Pero bueno... el tiempo dirá, si este es tu chico! No tendrás que pensarlo mucho... el corazón te lo dirá!<br>  <br>  Te deseo mucha suerte! Y no lo olvides: tomate tu tiempo, y no pienses que tu decisión será la única, irrevocable y para siempre. Date y dale (a él) una oportunidad. Sé sincera y díselo, no puedes decir de entrada si va a funcionar o no, porque todavía no lo conoces, ni él te conoce a tí. Y cuando veas cómo es él, cómo se comporta, cómo es contigo, si te quiere, si tú le quieres a él... podrás decir más.<br>  <br>  Intentalo!<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte!<br>  <br>  Y cualquier cosa, aquí estoy.<br>  <br>  Un beso muy grande|`|7NAIbRXaaa	No creo que pase nada malo.. si te sientes rara o seria con el y el contigo, es facil.. HABLENLO... No hay nada mejor que hablar las cosas honestamente... Aunque a veces por ser honestos perdamos amigos que queremos, tambien por ser honestos nos hacemos una imagen ante los demas y se pueden salvar muchas relaciones.... <br>  Un beso|!!1|`|TlR0wG8yaa	Y qué se supone que hay que decirte? Si te decimos que todo va estar bien te vas a sentir mejor? Eso jamás lo sabremos.<br>  Yo lo que te diría es que si tenés ilusión, y crees fuertemente en algo, luches por eso a contracorriente, caiga quien caiga. Lo que digan los demas poco importa.<br>  Eso si, no actúes impulsuvamente, los resultados suelen ser negativos, y más en casos sentimentales como este.<br>  Si te vas a dejar llevar por lo que te dicen, tal vez dejes pasar a una buena persona, en cambio si lo intentas y no funciona, siempre vas a estar a tiempo de dar marcha atras, no estás obligada a nada.<br>  En suma, que pienses muy bien las cosas, y que escuches solamente a tu corazon.<br>  Un beso y mucha suerte.|`|TuHj80UGaa	Quizás lo que más necesitas es serenarte y mirar en tu interior que es lo que sientes con más fuerza, ?el amor o el miedo?

Es cierto que el hecho de conocerse por internet y hacer relaciones muy íntimas no es muy recomendable, pero si él deja su país por ti, es se?al de algo muy sincero. <br>  Ten como actitud primera la confianza, eso sí, no tengas prisas, mejor, no las tengáis: si lo vuestro funciona será porque pongáis buenos cimientos, en parte. <br>  Normal que tengáis miedo, pero si tenéis confianza el uno en el otro, el tiempo os hará ver si tenéis que continuar y seguir profundizando o si fue una gran amistad la que os une que merece la pena incluso salir del país. En cualquier caso, será todo muy positivo, si vais con confianza (no ingenuidad si ves cosas más adelante que te hagan sospechar y sean obvias, pero eso no toca pensarlo ahora). Mucho ánimo, adelante, y mi mejor consejo, si queréis algo firme para vuestras vidas: despacio.|`|NjTe9hCvaa	SE BREVE CLARA Y CONSISA CON LO QUE PREGUNTAS OK, OBVIO QUE  COMPRENDO TU PREGUNTA NO MAS TE DOY ESE CONSEJO|`|Z47y3n8Jaa	Lo unico que necesitas es aumentar mas las ilusiones y esperanzas tuyas y de la persona que encontraste,  y no es cierto que las cosas no funcionen por internet.,  son exactamente igual que en la vida fisica,  una persona va a ser sincera tanto en lo fisico, como por internet.,  asi que, no tengas miedo,  solo aumenta esa llama del amor que sienten los dos,  pon en practica ideas, argumentos, bromas,  ustedes la mujeres son muy buenas para eso cuando se lo proponen.   ahhhhhh..... y  felicidades.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|clpkXX91aa	amor de lejos................................. <br>  felices los cuatros|`|i8h1tzgdaa	No te preocupes de si las cosas van a funcionar o no, dale tiempo al tiempo y disfruta de tu relación; en cuanto a lo que te dicen los demás de que no le ven futuro no hagas caso, ellos no saben lo que ustedes sienten ni lo que están viviendo, además ya sea que lo conociste por Internet o no siempre existirá la posibilidad de que alguien te enga?e, yo conozco varias parejas que se conocieron por internet y algunas ya hasta se casaron y otras ya llevan 4 a?os o mas de salir juntos, date la oportunidad de volver a sentir y no te preocupes de lo que vendrá.

I mean don't be immature about it and play stupid games because that makes you look bad, but do remind yourself that you're amazing and even though it may hurt and take time you WILL find someone else who will appreciate everything that you are and love you and stay with you. it's really true, you just have to wait it out and try to have fun no matter what.<br>  <br>  really occupy yourself with other things to do and be around friends and meet new people, and you'll forget about him less and less.<br>  trust me, i've been there before and it wasn't easy at first, but it gets better if you have good friends and remember to just have a good time. <br>  :) it'll be okay!|`|cVF9Clg8aa	if it is me, then im perfect:D...if this happens to be you Kayla..|`|fKaATpL0aa	look at the things u hate about him.

You should think about what happened and why it happened. <br>  2. Accept that its hard to deal.<br>  3. Keep your distance and don't speak with him often. <br>  4. Think through the whole situation in your head.<br>  5. Write all your feelings down.<br>  6. let go.<br>  7. Think positive. <br>  For more go to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Over-a-Break-Up" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Over-a-Break-...</a><br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this has helped.|`|n9IZtcD0aa	okay, so rebound relationships are a good idea and it helps if you aren't around him all the time.  try to find yourself another guy, just any random guy who is so completely opposite of your guy that you can't even think about him when you're with new guy.  then you have a nice short sweet fling with new guy...you break his heart like yours is broken.  that sounds mean, i know, and it sorta is but it's cathardic for you.  it helps if you find a guy who knows you're doing the rebound thing.  they know what's going on and they know how it is all going to play out so they are less hurt by your fling.  if you have to spend a lot of time with your heartache guy then the fling isn't going to make it easier to be around him at first but it gets easier when you are with someone who will treat you like you want him to and will be with you like you want him to.|`|tiKH4relaa	Pigging out on ice cream and chocolate and watching the Notebook|`|v1LLx2Lwaa	Stop being such a ******* emo

Get a puppy!!!|`|ojqWNSJMaa	Interesting you should ask.<br>  Probably went the way off the dodo birds. There is so much pressure from the "Liberals" that women have a even footing with men,(as if they never did?) What happened to all the women that wanted to please, and love, and care, for a man? Women had as much, (even more in my opinion) power and influence in the home years back when they were able to convince their men of a particular matter than today.<br>  No women are trying to compete for the same positions that men are seeking. That may and may not be a good thing. One thing that I have recognized is that there is a definite shortage of REAL men left in our country.<br>  The old saying ,"be careful for what you wish for, you just might get it"<br>  comes to mind.|`|3MFzTysmaa	Ummm are you sure you want a clingy guy?

1k7LIZVWaa	I would suggest studying and take a GED test so you can apply for and get a decent job that doesn't involve anything that will hurt your back.  You need to support yourself and not depend so much on your wife.  You will have more self respect and your wife will respect you more as well.  You need to do something.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Come on....get your GED.....start looking for work you can do.   You should not ever have to depend on someone else in the long run. Ever.   You sound like you have no savings. You should get started on that. I think your wife wants out but is unwilling to admit it.   Perhaps you have not given her enough attention lately and you allow her to support you. Not bad, you have a back problem, etc...but it takes its toll on the woman.  The main breadwinner.  As for me, I need to take my own advice.......  It is hard.  Try to talk to her to see if it is salvageable...|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Do what women do in your position, file for spousal support and live off her money. I'm kidding! But, I do notice similarities in your story to that of a lot of housewives I know.     Seriously though, you should file for spousal support.

DH3P0zouaa	the guys in the classroom are afraid people might find out.|`|uqs2NCodaa	maybe bc the boys in the class see how ur mean.

Pretty girls intimidate boys, whorish girls are easy. You have the power You don't need non of them.   Who do you like in your class? Not who likes you. Keep your sexy up and let them droole.     Trust me they are talking about you behind closed doors. Remember you are a hotty.
3zm0jA0yaa	I would think you should talk to them while they are not high and tell them how it is effecting you and your siblings. Tell them that you all still need their guidance and attention, and when they are high you feel like they are then strangers. Tell them that you don't even know who they are when they are high. Tell them everything, and don't hold anything back. they need to hear this from all of you. you need an intervention is what you need. and it would be better if you had another adult present when this went down. because they will probably become defensive and make up excuses for their addiction. they may not even admit to it but admitting you have a problem is the first step in doing something about it. That will be up to them to get help but if you don't tell them how you feel they will never know, so you must tell them. I wish I could make it better for you i really do. I feel for ;you and your siblings. i guess you feel like you don't even have parents right now and that has to be a scarey feeling. but get another person involved   an adult that they know and trust and mabe they will make a change. I really do hope so. Good luck and God bless.|`|6kbgcOYAaa	how old are you and your siblings?|`|IIav8IKuaa	My mom drinks every night & I hate it. She's not mean, but she's different.

I hate that she can't remember things the next day.<br>  <br>  I tried to get my mom to go to AA & quit, but I couldn't make her.<br>  <br>  I just avoid her at night. I would hang out in my room when she was drinking,<br>  <br>  I'm in college now, & I don't answer the phone when she calls at night. I never talk to her when she's drunk. I find her really embarassing,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, there's not much you can do.<br>  <br>  You can't make people change, but you don't have to be around them if your uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If they ask why you're in your room, be straightforward say, "I don't like being around you when you're high, I'd rather be in here."|`|PkDokr8Iaa	You can't change or control anyone else.  As far as the addiction, I do not know the laws where you live; but if there is a Child Protective Services agency, you need to contact them.....IF you want to live with foster parents or someone other guardians.<br>  <br>  You mentioned about all of you soon moving out...no idea how old any of you are, you didn't tell us.<br>  <br>  |`|IsDdBCxIaa	idk|`|uxwSd0KLaa	You have my sympathy ; because you and your sibling do not have a normal life and no there nothing you can do ; except leaving this house as soon as you can |`|zYgYJsCqaa	Hun, that is not a good environment for you or your siblings... Your parents have a serious problem that's only going to get worse. I think that you should call the child line... <br>  <br>  If you want to help your parents, you have to do the right thing... your sister is 16 and she is already out of the house most nights.. who knows what she is up to and your parents don't seem to care. Does your dad work??? How do you guys survive... I am sure it's expensive to buy drugs etc... <br>  <br>  Speak to someone at your school, you have to try something. You say they are not violent but if they keep doing this they might be... Speak do you mum at least , tell her how you feel! 
1MyUmBhXaa	Um, in high school, I would've preferred to hear movie so it takes some nervousness out of it.<br>  <br>  Plz. answer my question? thanks!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsmnWt_xOaM2cIno65Y0PmHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080326095743AAC78mU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
gzfwzI9Jaa	No, you are doing the right thing by doing what you are doing. I myself know someone who is a junior in high school, and she is still a virgin. Having sex just to have sex makes you lose respect and confidence in yourself, well in my opinion it does. I have been going out with my boyfriend for a long time now, and we are soon to be married, but the thing is the both of us weren't virgins when we met, and when we started going out he thought I was, and when I told him he was upset, and I was upset with him when he told me. The thing is it still haunts us everyday that we weren't each others first. So don't feel bad that you want to wait until the right person comes along, and one thing is for sure, please don't let your friends pressure you into it, that's the biggest mistake you could ever make. It happened to me, and I hate it, and wished it never happened. well I hope you make a wise choice and do what you feel is right, but I hope you have a great day!!!|`|e8o1EpQYaa	You should not have sex until you're absolutely positive that you want to and it's right. Sex doesn't mess up a relationship, by the way, it's sort of part of one. If you don't like the guy, and you don't want to have sex with him ... then don't! I made a similar mistake.|`|s90DY6Dyaa	nothing wrong with that. I bet there are people who say theyve done it when in reality they are still virgins...they say it to look cool. So dont feel out of place if you want to wait for the right person to do it with, even after HS.|`|MN0N0zTIaa	No. Doing anything you don't want to do is wrong though. So be true to yourself missy.|`|MYt9neKJaa	Don't do it until you know, and block out what your friends are saying, what they think doesn't matter. Sex is suppose to be personal not for everyone to know. Wait until you really love somone and even give yourself some time to grow up. You might think you are mature enough but trsut me you still have a lot of growing up to do, and so do guys... A LOT! Do what feels right, waiting is good!|`|yvhSOGf9aa	It's part of chemistry.. mans are attracted to womens with long legs. big breast, tight ***. even if they don't want to have sex. when things get too sticky, they naturally erect. and then they turn wild, but every man has different level. some man can screw anything that moves. some man only screw someone who they really like.<br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  best regards.|`|7rwzYmqFaa	enjoy your virginity while it lasts....i am also a junior in high school and sex just does mess up a realtionship......i have lost boyfriends due to that exact reason.....cherish it becuase not many people have......be with someone who loves you and is willing to wait as long as they have to for you....then you will if its right|`|31oLVd5Iaa	yes get some|`|38dd3391eb090215bd00a1de0f98864eaa	i think that its a good thing that you haven't sex yet. sex is a big deal and you don't want to regret who it was with when you look back. if you're friends are telling you these things then they aren't that good of friends. you're friends should accept you and your choices whether or not they agree. you will get more respect for not sleeping around like some of the girls in high school. and you'll know when you're ready whether or not its now or when your 20. and most guys in high school that is mostly what they think of. but if you find a guy that's willing to wait until you're ready then you're lucky and if you like them maybe give him a chance. and if you think you're ready then do what you think is best.|`|GEz0iPgcaa	Guys are obessed w/ sex, gurl. Please wait for tha right guy or else you could just be making a mistake.. it won't take you til 40 years of age to find a guy who makes you feel comfortable nd safe. There are plenty of guys out there. When i was in High Skool i felt i knew my classmates like friends, nd i wasn't sleeping around or even having sexual relationships w/ anyone.  Your intuition is good gurl, you want to wait til you find the right guy.<br>  Sex doesn't mess up relationships, unless you slept w/ a friend nd feel guilty about it..  Don't ever get into a relationship just cauz a man told you sex wasn't everything...thats a lie. it could mean he that he loves you and wants to be with you, but i find that sex isn't important hard to believe. Make sure he respects YoUr EvErYtHiNg before you give it up.<br>  <br>  Think about it..|`|WHKkwXeGaa	Sweetie, please listen to me.  I lost my virginity in middle school and a million times over I wished I would have waited.  I don't even no where that guy is now.  Of course then I thought i loved him and we would get married.  I have learned that you don't know yourself until you are much older.  I would recommend you wait until marriage because you won't have all does emotional feeling for other people.  However I know in this day most people do not.  I would highly recommend you wait until after high school.  Most guys at your age are so immature, inexperienced and that's how young ladies end up pregnant before they are ready.  Just think if you sleep with someone are you ready to have a child with that person because it could happen.<br>  <br>  You are precious and worth finding someone who will wait and not pressure you.|`|TX9igTWraa	honey i didnt lose my virginity until i was 19. there is nothing wrong with waiting until you find the right one. at least you don't have to worry about getting pregnant or getting an STD. if a guy really likes you he'll wait until YOU are ready to have sex. if he leaves before then, then he never really liked you in the first place.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Your friends are, no offense, stupid.  Not having sex when you're 16 or 17 doesn't mean that you'll still be a virgin when you're 40.  That's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Stick to your guns, and tell your friends that they'll eventually regret their decisions to lose it to some random guy or girl.  High school contains way too much improper peer pressure; you're doing the right thing.
27b7ecdf400b152f1a4da0e39cd27673aa	You shouldn't stop her.<br>  <br>  As badly as you will feel (as if you're bleeding from your heart) she seems to have already decided that it will be the "best path" for her.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it does seem as though she never included you when she thought of her future.|`|uhRf0GM2aa	If you really love her...you would let her go...dont hold her back from goals she is trying to achieve...in the end if she stayed that could probably lead to a break up and her being bitter for some time...you have nothing to worry about...if u were really in love u wouldnt have anything to worry about|`|ydU74070aa	go with her
phouqBL4aa	WELL HE DIDNT LEAVE ANY SIGNS OUT<br>  OF COURSE HE LIKES YOU DUH!!!!!|`|CbuAX9suaa	I WOULD KIND OF GET OFENDED WITH THE BOOBS THING:) well anyways i think he likes u!!!
ignFU29Jaa	i think that you should be sure if he really doesnt love her anymore because if he does then he is probably just using you to make your friend jealous. its pretty weird that now he is like all over you i mean they were going out for more then a year.and if she is really a good friend she will understand.
FpimrvTHaa	No. You can't just get married without dating. It wasn't a good idea. If you really wanted to be with her and it was meant to be, it would have happened if you would have waited.<br>  <br>  But who knows, maybe she says yes and you end up really happy. I hope things turn out good!|`|ddYJDloaaa	Don't get married. You are way to young and have so many years in front of you. I know it's hard to see it now, but as you get older and look back on your life you will be glad you didn't get married. There are so many fish in the sea. Let her go to Mexico and live your life. You're so young.
GpNxs1ggaa	um i think you should talk to your friend just after you make a move on friday .. just see what happens ..<br>  but it sounds like she really likes you !<br>  when you talk to your friend you should be very gentle and try making some jokes since you are funny.. if he gets mad then idk.. do you really like her or ?<br>  because best friends are forever .. ''some girl i like'' isn't.<br>  good luck
MLdykhQNaa	He's just comfortable around you and likes you as a friend.  I catch myself doing the same to girls I've known for a while.
I814g6ZBaa	Anything that makes you feel guilty is probably not a good idea.  <br>  Would she be able to open that gift in front of both her partner and yours?  Would she be able to tell both of them you gave it to her?  OR would it have to be just "your little secret"??  Hmmm..<br>  <br>  You probably already know the answer; and you might want to both reconsider the relationships you're in... why not give it a try with each other before you end up married to other people and still *wondering* -- <br>  just saying.|`|xnrm5d7Faa	hey! i love that kiss that you gave me.
KAdBccU6aa	wow... I don't understand people.. I'm not trying to be rude.. but i mean think about it, if he does have a gf and he is flirting with you...what do you think that means? I'm 100% right that he would do it to you if you were his gf.... I know this because I see it happen everyday and yet I still here people ask this qs...lol It's like the 2+2=4 but you want it to equal whatever number besides 4.... It's simple black and white, if he is doing this now with a gf he will do this in the future.... I'm sorry.|`|qNbWq5mKaa	Remember he has a girlfriend , this means he may cheat on her to be with you, this is not what you want for yourself.<br>  Forget about him and find  a guy who is un-attached to someone at the present time!|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	go ahead its 21st century|`|6GUpUXoXaa	Sweetie!  A woman is running for president!  Come on now it's not weird for a girl to ask a guy out.  Some guys actually perfer it that way.  I say go for it I mean if he does have a g/f then its no biggie maybe in the future it will work but you never know unless you take that risk.  Good luck!|`|86705e4f639033addfd3ad757b057fe8aa	No his not a player he has mix feelings ask him to go out with you like to the movies or just hanging out and see what he does. then if you think he likes you go for it. get a closer friends to talk about you when his around and see what he says get them to ask him how he feels about you. trust me it's happening to me to my best friends brother flirts with me every-time i go over there or he sees me. And only reason i think he hasn't asked is because he doesn't want mine and his sister friendship to be racked,|`|NMpyZ4R9aa	just ask the guy if he does have a GF. if not take your shot, or tell him to leave you alone that you want a real man|`|nVdYIHhzaa	can you say...?<br>  <br>  PLAYER!!!|`|LadbGAdCaa	Just ask him out. If he says yes than thats good. Sometimes boys get alittle scared. Dont listen to ur friends. Girls can make the move too. If he says he has a girlfriend well, at least you tried. Its about taking a risk. Either way if he has a gf or not you can still ask him. Dont be afraid. Just go up to him and say Do you wanna go out with me?|`|qT40EGjYaa	It depends what kind of person you'd like to portray yourself as.  Do you want to be known as someone that doesn't respect moral boundaries that another girl has?  It usually goes that if a guy will flirt with you when he's with someone else, he'll probably flirt with someone else when he's with you.  Perhaps you should examine exactly what kind of person you'd like to date and whether or not worrying about a guy cheating on you is something you'd want to go through.|`|tO0OXaBTaa	as long as he doesn't have a girlfriend... <br>  ask him out , no one says girls cant make the first move.<br>  but make sure you find out if he has a girlfriend already. cuz if he does. and is willing to cheat on her with u . that would only cause trouble for you. And if hes flirting with you wile he has a girlfriend. who's to say he wouldn't flirt with other girls wile hes dating you? you just gotta think about that. and follow your heart. best of luck:)|`|zELDZogCaa	guys do not always have to make the first move. but, you know how you feel when you are in a relationship and some girl starts flirting with your bf and you feel disrespected? like it's not a jealousy or insecurity... it's the anger that you know that she has no respect for your relationship. you never want to be that girl that is disrespectful. i think that if you find out he is single, go for it. if he isn't, be a friend and respect the girlfriend. it's classy... if he cheats on her with you - because you weren't classy... but trashy - what makes him think he can't cheat on you?  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Cep2eMwEaa	no entendi si eres el padrastro o la madrastra, pero para el caso es lo mismo.<br>  <br>  creo que lo que tienes que hacer, constee es mi humilde opinion.<br>  ejerce tu profesion no para educar al hijo,, si no par educar a tu pareja.<br>  no te enfoques en el problema si no en la causa del problema. es obvio que la culpa la tienen los padres, por mal educarlo, por increible que paresca mucho amor y mucha complacencia hace mas dano que un par de nalgadas a tiempo.<br>  <br>  suerte|`|MpVF8n3iaa	Hola Ale<br>  <br>  Te voy a dar mi opinión como mama que soy. Pueden ser muchas cosas; me llamo mucho la atención las actividades del ni?o, me parece que esta sobre estimulado, son demasiadas para su edad (taekwondo, patinaje,ingles), además de que me imagino que va al colegio.<br>  <br>  La actitud del ni?o solo refleja la actitud de los padres. Si es un ni?o consentido al que no se le niega nada, es obvio que siempre va a querer mas y mas.....hasta el punto que nada lo satisfaga. Vale la pena, por la salud mental de todos, que lleguen a un acuerdo y que se defina hasta donde puedes tener autoridad, pues al final de cuentas, aunque no es tu hijo, eres hasta cierto punto parte de su familia y convives mas con el que su padre. A partir de ahí, se pueden balancear las cosas (claro, para eso necesitas saber hasta donde te quieres comprometer).<br>  <br>  Hay un libro que a mi me gusta mucho, pues me esta ayudando a salir de ese bache en el que yo también estaba cayendo, se llama "Disciplina con amor" de Rosa Barocio. (Pax México Editorial). Tal vez lo puedas conseguir por Internet o en una librería grande de tu país.|`|GNGx47kQaa	bueno primero te lo dejan como hijo y luego resulta que siempre noo...<br>  <br>  debes hablar con la madre y que los dos queden en acuerdo para educarlo y   tomar las decisiones quee sean prudentes para el ni?oo. y sobre todo para ustedees.|`|SkyD87claa	pues es dificil<br>  si tu q eres un profesional no puedes, de hecho iba a sugerirte visitar un psicologo q igual sigue siendo buena opcion, porq en ocaciones no escuchamos a nuestros seres queridos y si a desconocidos, aqui lo mejor seria q hablaras con el ni?o (puedes encontrar a veces mas comprension en un ni?o q en un adulto) y pidele al ni?o q cambie su comportamiento, si siguen las cosas mal, q hace tu enmedio, alejate de esa situacion y de esa relacion.|`|VXgy34WMaa	buena suerte antes de que quedes igual de loka que yo|`|e1425dad1151b42c118a5f3edb2f06dcaa	Para empesar kreo ke deberias hablar con la mama y ya despues ves ke haces kon el ni?o podrias kontratar a una ni?era o alguien ke sea experta en eso de los ni?os.|`|OtnrMtCAaa	Los ni?os son unos "monstruos" estudiando el comportamiento de los adultos.<br>   él sabe donde está situada cada una de las personas que le rodean.... Y LO QUE DA DE Sí, CADA UNA.<br>  Por un lado se aprovecha del padre biológico que al no vivir con él , éste posiblemente le consienta todo .<br>  La madre,  pobre mi ni?o que no tiene ya a su papá,  le tolera todo porque es una "forma" de pedirle disculpas...<br>  y luego tú , que sabe perfectamente el lugar que ocupas y aunque tengamos en cuenta que te quiere mucho, sabe que tus decisiones no son las definitivas...<br>  En fin , el crío tiene tres adultos con los que jugar a su antojo.<br>  <br>  Buscar un consenso entre los tres : <br>  Sus papás y tú tendríais que establecer unas normas que deberéis cumplir a rajatabla....los tres.<br>  Por suerte el ni?o es muy peque?o y estáis a tiempo para cambiar ese carácter tan insoportable que empieza a aflorar.<br>   Una vez que el ni?o pasa de los 8 ó 9 a?os la cosa se complica ...empiezan con la afirmación del yo .. créeme es una etapa mucho más complicada.<br>  Disciplina, disciplina y  disciplina.....mezclado con buenas dosis de cari?o y paciencia.....ese es el secreto.<br>  Creo.<br>  <br>  !Suerte!|`|Vv0PQjncaa	Haber  haber, como esta eso de que primero te lo dejan como hijo y despues no, pues que piensa ella que es un juego? si al comenzar tu relacion con ella se supone que tu tambien tienes algo de autoridad sobre su hijo, lo que debes de hacer es hablar con ella y poner las cartas sobre la mesa, tanto tu como ella deben de poner reglas y de respetar dejaselo bien claro que tu tambien puedes reprender a su hijo (nunca con violencia) y no solo eso tambien educarlo tal cual como una pareja es decir, que vea que tienes derecho de educarlo y de reprenderlo (cuando sea necesario) y tambien que ella hable con su hijo porque eso de estarlo consintiendo pues como que no, lo que va a conseguir es hacer de el un ni?o caprichoso e ingreido (si no es que ya lo es), es mi muy humilde opinion ojala que te sirva de algo, saludos y suerte.|`|yOyEaJRUaa	La comunicaciòn es lo mas importante en una pareja, y tu lo que necesitas es hablar con ella y ponerse de acuerdo, y despues de esto ponerle reglas al ni?o, porque si uno  las opone y otro las rompe, pues el ni?o abusa.... Ya les tomo la medida...hablalo con ella, tienes que ser sutil y veraz que todo se mejora, pero deben de estar de acuerdo!!!!!
AA11550245	Well your dad is not abusive, but he did push him too far.  First of all your dad should have not gotten to wii.  One the other hand he should have gotten it but only let you play with it because your brother is not listening and demanding things.  There should be a punishment for his actions.  It sound like your parents need to stop giving into him and grounding him for acting this way.  I would stay out of it and let your parents handle the situation.  Keep yourself on the right path and lead by example.  Not in a teasing way but in a good way.  I would also encourage your brother to be more positive etc..  Or say hey if you wait until dad comes back I will challenge you to match(I mean on the game).  etc...  Leave the punishment to your parents and tell him to talk to your parents if he had issues.  This way you will not get stressed out!  And the only piece of advice I can say is listen to when he comes to you, but try to stay out of it.  Good Luck.|`|72c715b1407f197c1a530719259a3a3eaa	your brother needs some professional help...he might have ADD or is depressed about something....tell daddy to take him to a therapist and try and nip the problem in the bud.|`|J7lkTV91aa	Your brother is at the pace where he is growing up. He may have mood swings. Try to understand him....<br>  <br>  Besides, maybe he has problems that he didnt tell you. Just try to understand him a little more...<br>  <br>  Just talk to him. Give him some encouraging words. He wants someone to actually care for him...|`|rzMRkEXNaa	what i whould say is be carefull to not tell a friend about you dad pushing your bro cause dss could get involved

Try let her know that you are doing your best and really .. right now there is nothing you can do... she needs to be understanding... honestly... if you both understand that ... then the relationship will last.... if she loves you she will understand. <br>  <br>  Many relationships are like that (mine, and like 5 of my friends)... and we have all been with our bf for 3+ years.... we just know that right now since we are in school and our bf's work is at diff hours there is nothing to do... she should be happy... she is not spending all her time on the phone; therefore, she has more time to actually finish her school work|`|6e16f4069ecbb4c82031c4876c14f44faa	plan a special day just for you and her|`|5k2OPHVPaa	Tell her what you said in the question.

When you have free time, try to keep your energy up during the day so you'll have time for her in your schedule.|`|DB4c7bONaa	well i think that u should just leave a nice note on the table that says i love u every day and fine time on the weekend when its just u and her<br>  and tell her how u feel and u want to be wit her forever <br>  just tell her that u love her and thats really all u can say|`|KNKJLutxaa	here's an idea: get another job!<br>  you're tearing her apart!!<br>  you're not there for her anymore!! what do you do if she like gets raped or whatever on the way home from someplace and you're still snoozing!!?? you're her protection, her life, and you're too busy with your frickin job to even care for her.

She should also be adult enough to understand that you are busy and have a different schedule than hers and you cant text her throughout the day. She should be able to understand this and if shes not than she needs to become more mature, no offense.<br>  <br>  If you love your girlfriend as much as you say you do, then make sure you guys both schedule time to be with and to talk to each other. Thats how most relationships work.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Go for the most important talk in-hand first.|`|dqPEVFCkaa	Don't ever let yourself down. Have confidence in yourself.

I don't really date either and have just started college myself. I think you feel the same way I do. A relationship looks nice but you don't want to try very hard when you've got so much going on right now. My solution (though it is admittedly not much of one) is to just wait and see, you never know when the right person will just walk into your life.<br>  I would like to be friends if you want to, so I enabled my email. Feel free to write me.|`|f23e7d086415f97548523d2edea09d0daa	no... you just chose not to date based on valid reasons; study & have no money...<br>  <br>  most teenagers start dating at this stage, however there are some whom are like you, they will only date when they have completed their studies and are financially stable (meaning can support their own spending)...<br>  <br>  i can say that you are mature & i have seen some young guys like you; they know what they want in life & they prioritise..<br>  <br>  dating is not close to you, don't worry unnecessarily...

Look at the brightside..<br>  2. Some people develop a kind of defensive mechanism after a break up like yours. Don't do that .. Be ready to love and to let other people love you . You won't allways get hurt in a relationship.. Maybe You'll find THE GIRL, The One for you now that you're available.. Who knows.. Right?|`|Ua8tPF8gaa	Just wait a while, only time will make it easier to get over it.  You did the right thing by breaking up with her!
4H76AzUkaa	Don't get a tattoo just to piss off your parents. That's about as lame as it gets. If you want a tattoo then get one, but make sure it's for the right reasons. That's a huge commitment you know. And since you are an adult you can do pretty much anything you want with your hair. You just need to grow some backbone to better ignore their complaints.|`|trERH3oBaa	That's a stupid reason but of course we see why that is tempting. Just deal with your annoying parents, right now they are dealing with their annoying kid. Soon enough you'll move out and then visit and be happy to see them and will miss the good times. Try to keep having some good times with them.
zQD2dlCiaa	Truth be told... when you're sick enough of NOT having a boyfriend you'll just get over it. In the mean time try to realize that you are worthy of any guy out there and go for the best.<br>  Oh, and guys... it's a bit like with animals : they're more scared than you are so no worries.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, beautiful!|`|trERH3oBaa	Relationships are intimidating because you don't know what to do or expect. You need a role model or a mentor that you can trust. If you live with your mom, talk to her. How about an aunt or grandmother?

1EBKRmY9aa	yes men love the chase but dont back off too much or he'll think u dont like him at all|`|trERH3oBaa	Well, it's true that guys will back off if a girl comes on too strong. So your plan sounds good. Remember he may be dating other people.  If he isn't and you guys start to see each other very often like 5 out of 7 days a week, it is still a good idea for a "space weekend" where you each have free time to hang out with your other friends, etc.

Sg9E9YDuaa	It is probably just a phase the two of you are going through.  My brother and I used to be like that but now that we are older (I'm 22 and he is 18) we get along a lot better.  We still fight sometimes but its not nearly as bad as it was when we were younger.  Next time you feel like you are going to say something hurtful to your sister, take a deep breath and count to ten.  If you are still angry with her just go in your room and listen to music for a little while and that should help you calm down a little.  Hope this helps!|`|4SEGvnyvaa	ok im a year older than your sister so i might be able to help well your sister is almost a teen and i know and still get this sometime well i feel kind of lost like no one is respecting me your sister migh just want to feel like shes in controll of something and your the easiest target .so maybe get her to soften up a bit like maybe a cat or dog! so she can give her energy torwrds an animal not you! and talk with her tell her that shes ruinig your relationship between you guys also if your maybe going to the mall or the movies invite her but tell her to bring a firnd so shes not bored this will help you guys get a better friendship instead of just oh your so annoying this is kind of exactly the thing thta goes on between my bff and her older sis!|`|BMyEl168aa	Try not to call her names and if she starts to annoy you ignore her that way she will soon realize its not bothered you. Good Luck !|`|K4HYMz5waa	I would say that there is help for you but there's not.  My sister and I faught until we were adults.  Once we got out on our own and away from 24 hour contact.  Now I am about to hire her into my biz.  We are cool now.  We talk at least once a week.  Its a tough time now but it does get better.
trERH3oBaa	Yep. So what? What's your next question? What should you do? Nothing. Just enjoy and talk to him too. That's it. Life is simple. Don't make it more complicated than it is.|`|L1zejZZZaa	get someone to ask him|`|MZwNAfQBaa	Get sum1 2 ask but i think its pretty obvious he likes u!
trERH3oBaa	No preference. I like the idea of changing it over time though. Do this today then that tomorrow, you know? You might want to start with a full head of hair and work your way down over time. Also it depends on what you look like down there. Some girls are pretty shaved, some are NOT. Better safe than sorry. Once you turn a guy off, it's hard to turn him back on.|`|0496e87c1fc7124e21da310a296538f3aa	Trimmed!|`|43cYOER0aa	trimmed, because it is not to long or short.|`|E31dEzlTaa	shaved!!|`|TdX8FCFsaa	shaved or at least trimmed please|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	I like the natural look, shaved makes me think of a little girl, which is not a turn on.

8f9837d82b9370a329e0b0c92a029cb8aa	Actually, what you did can make a fabulous and sweet opening line to her.  It will also firmly establish to her that your interest is returned.  <br>  Just go up to her and say, "I'm sorry I was so rude a couple of weeks ago.  You made me a little shy, which normally doesn't happen!  How about a drink sometime?"|`|GbQ6zGuZaa	you can always tell her that u are sorry and u can let her get u something at least <br>  if u blow your chances 1 time u will still have another try|`|HnWgVzDEaa	Did you have to take a cab home that night too?|`|QW0Fhg3Laa	Naw I don't think you ruined anything at all.<br>  That's a really minor thing. Just go and try to make eye contact with her or something. Maybe some across-the-room flirting.<br>  If she comes over, great you have an opening.<br>  If she doesn't, (as it is POSSIBLE that she thinks you're uninterested,) then walk over and strike up a conversation of some sort. Maybe make a joke about how you were just nervous last time you talked to her.|`|UGGyiJrvaa	I find it cute that you were shy in the beginning, and I think a lot of my girlfriends agree that shy guys can be cute.<br>  <br>  But just be nice to her from now on, talk to her, just to let her know that you are interested too and not trying to avoid her.

ngyvl8CDaa	just leave him. didn't work the first time. and its starting to go sour again. 2 months isn't much time invested. just back out now.|`|trERH3oBaa	He can't find time for you? Sounds like he has already moved on and just can't tell you. You guys have been dating only 2 months and you've told each other that you love each other? Seriously?|`|gzZiPl9Vaa	In my opinion, it all depends on what he's so busy with.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy that was always busy during the week and only had time here and there on the weekends.  Started out great, used to go out to dinner, spend a lot of time together, but ended like that.  Soon I found blonde hairs and a girls sweatshirt at the end of his bed one morning.  Found out why he came sooo busy all of a sudden.<br>  <br>  But then again, sometimes people need space and feel as if they are being smothered and don't know a nice way of putting it.  OR they are preoccupied with their own lives (meaning problems at home, finances, school, etc.)<br>  <br>  You should talk to him...see if there is something that is bothering him or preoccupying him.  You guys have been together and know each other long enough that you should be able to talk and talking to each other should help resolve any problems.  Work with him through whatever it is.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|jNuUVTALaa	Leave him.If this is a second go around & he is STILL not committed 2 the relationship.I think u should move on and find some1 who appreciates ur love & spends quality time w/u.Don't set yourself up 4 another heartbreak.I pray that my advice has helped.Pay attention Darin.this is the second time they have been in a relationship.

Any way you do it, doesn't really matter. Seriously he'll probably be so hung up on the fact that you asked him to do anything he'll soon forget "how" you asked him anyways. Just find a common interest: movie, coffee shop, show and ask him to go.|`|nM7rgeu8aa	i had the same problem. your scared to ask at first but just wait for it. you'll get over waiting and you just want to ask him. but any ways if he likes you too then i say go for it. just dont push it. dont force it. if he dont give you a answer right away then dont push him to answer it. just follow your heart. i wish you the best of luck.|`|hwNOHqpxaa	Ask him if he wants to see a new movie.
649c0aa2af34f9a3ef040543920d9fbcaa	First of all I know you feel badly, because you don't want to hurt him or your friendship. But please remember you haven't done anything wrong. You can't make yourself like someone, no matter how much you might want to. You'll only make yourself feel awful.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to tell him flat out how you feel. Be gentle, but don't apologize. And tell yourself that this little bit of hurt that he'll feel now is better than letting him go on like this and then hurting him a LOT later.<br>  <br>  It's okay, you'll get through it just fine, and so will he.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	He is scarring you?

It was tough for me and I think I took the cowards way out. When this guy started doing things like your anti crush, I gave him the silent treatment and was so cold to him and flirted with other guys in front of him to let him know I didnt want him. But all that did was make him try harder. That was very dumb of me, please dont do that. Talk to him before this goes any further and he puts his heart on the line and you break it. MAke it clear to him you dont see him in that way nor ever will, make sure its CLEAR. But dont mention other guys.|`|2C23qfkaaa	wow it is scary ! tell him  your scared of him and please stay away  .. he sounds like a dangerous creep even though you have a nice friendship. he is going too far . wow he's scary dump him!|`|pTaf7PtTaa	No offense or anything, but make up your freaking mind. This guy must be so ******* confused right now. Choose one guy or the other, and then tell the other that you want to remain friends. You need to make a choice as soon as possible before you screw up yourself and your friendships with these guys.|`|3PSeDcBfaa	Be honest...it'll get your the furthest.|`|6OkSSsD5aa	try and tell him slowly that u arent interested in him as a bf but u like him as a friend or get someone that likes him to get his mind off u and make him think of them  <br>  <br>  hope this helped<br>  <br>  gd luck|`|GxTo2Cv7aa	Tell him the truth.<br>  If he can't accept it then he's not worth being a friend much less anything else.|`|OvqtBJFBaa	Well, you could ask him to help you out with your crush. He would definately get the hint that way.|`|VbTsiNWAaa	SAY UR A GOOD FRIEND AND ALL BUT IT JUST FEEL CREAPING DATINGA FRIEND|`|d3458bdc5de82edeb3ea792bf0cda483aa	I understand what it is youre trying to say and I cant blame you for being scared..thats kind of creepy if you read between the lines ! /.......i would say that you need to be very cautious of your actions and words around him because who knows to what degree he likes you..if its an obsession the last thing you want to be is front page news ! watch what you say and do and talk to someone about it...not to say you should tell..but you should seek the guidence of a responsible adult..maybe someone at the school that has access to him and his parents....you get where im going with this right?|`|mG3iTlG9aa	Tell him exactly this.  "You are a great guy, and I'm glad we are friends, but dating you would be like dating my brother, and I believe that it would change our friendship, and I don't want that to happen." good luck

But don't let smoking and the virgin thing come between you two.<br>  <br>  I smoke and I drink.  My wife and I got married only after 6 months of dating.  23 years and 4 children later, we are still together.  By the way, I just quit smoking about 6 months ago.  I don't know if I can quit drinking cold turkey.|`|HmQzOLv6aa	Your bothered on what is she doing, right? Well, if I were you. I would change her|`|prtKFgxWaa	its only bad if you think it is|`|oyT081aUaa	It's up to you to decide if you like that behavior.

oleYpfURaa	restarting the relationship may not be in your hands...it sounds like you guys are in 2 different places at the moment. If your gut is telling you though that she is great, then i really suggest keeping her in your life in whatever capacity-even as a friend.  Being someone's friend lets you see the "real" person and you know-you may not have a crush on her anymore in a coupe of months or maybe you'll find out you are really compatible.  Give her what she wants as long as it doesn't hurt you (if she's just out of a long relationship, this could mean loads of space sometimes!!)  Good luck!|`|5sIA8oYAaa	Unless there is something extremely super special about this person, pass them by. This game will keep on and on.

Tell her you're with someone else at the moment, or you're at the movies and can't talk to her. Or if she calls, just don't pick up for awhile, and at the end of the day just call her and tell her that you're sorry you couldn't pick up.|`|AA11754036	bone the shite out of her|`|AA11022021	well how is she useing u like put some more stuff sorry man idk what it is so i cant really give u an answer|`|EPpKLbbgaa	after getting denied by her and getting to know what her lifes like <br>  can u make this part more clear??<br>  i mean it's really important to answer this question|`|MoN5Z8oiaa	u r confusing me.. well, she denies u, why on earth is she still hanging out with u?? u should remember that.. u said she is using u 4 something. obviously, its either sex or money and in both cases u r losing not winning..

If you want, you can drop it as a joke and see her reaction... but if you're really concerned about her constantly calling you up for things...then just tell her flat out that you're starting to think that she's only interested in using you rather then actually wanting to be anything else.|`|fXhGBpjJaa	Give her a kung foo chop to her coochie.|`|p3tOUWniaa	if you arent blunt and go after what you want you have 100% on missing out.  if you make clear what you want and say it then at least you have a chance on getting what you want which is higher than zero.|`|pLIPimeSaa	stop hanging out with her|`|z5rX9sCbaa	eventually you will find another girl and she will make you forget about her but in the meanwhile try to see her  only as a friend try to stop hanging with  her to much because you have feelings for her and that's a sign that you re going to suffer.
OO5xReDbaa	Honestly, <br>  <br>  If you have a crush, you should tell the other person how you feel. Be confident about it, women love confidence. Don't be afraid of having those feelings, it's only natural.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel that she feels the same way too, or else you might get casted into the dreaded friend zone. Make sure you tell her how you feel before she builds too much of a "friendship" with you.|`|78c97398e64a9050ec6657d53c00c8ceaa	I Sit up in my room, listen to my favorite romantic songs and i dance around my room forever and think about what I am going to say to him the next time I see him.|`|wwBZh6lbaa	Try to get to know the person.|`|BhafhQaBaa	duh, tell them! Or if you don't picture yourself with them then hang tight and soon you'll be able to move on.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	personally I'm more of the admire from afar kinda person. everyone says that its best to tell the person you like them but i never tell them...(and strangely enough they find out i like them anyways...)but the down side to not telling them is that they will never know you like them. <br>  i see the pros and cons to both options. <br>  telling them Pro- if you tell them then you know for sure if they like you(or don't like you) Con- they may not like you and you get sad about that.<br>  not telling them Pro- you can stay friends and not have the awkwardness. Con- they don't know you like them and you don't know weather or not they like you back. <br>   so id rather them not know but that's just me. i know that was rather long but i just had to say everything i was thinking. hope that helped ^-^|`|XI4imorDaa	I take it slow , and look for sign that they like me , flirting , smiling alot etc.   I talk to them often but not too often. you dont want to be too much. Then ask them out .|`|aXePSvZhaa	Do you want to get to know them, or do you want to get rid of the crush? If the first, there will be plenty of places on the net telling what to do to get noticed by your crush, if the later, find three things that really annoy you about the person, and focus on them, instead.|`|nl8zdNVOaa	I would see if i want to go out with her, or if its just temporary. If i want to ask her out, i find out if shes interested, or i read the signals she gives out to me. I would befriend her so its easier to ask her out.

It seems as though people (particularly women) can't understand that sometimes men actually have strong feelings and become stressed out.  He needs some time to straighten things out in his life, and the time that you will be away will give him a chance to do this without another thing adding to it. Just accept his wishes and try not to make too much of it.|`|quI6uxpjaa	wish you the best|`|sVFfq7wJaa	giv the man sum space... jeez... let him deal wit his issues... n i think that all u want frum the relationship is sex...
PlFdmFgBaa	Usually for a guy, he wants your emotional support to make him feel like a man. If he shows his weak side, just tell him that you love him anyways despite of his weaknesses. He wants to know that you want him. You dont have to have sex with him, just show him that you are willing to give yourself to him no matter what the curcumstances. <br>  <br>  I wanted to have sex with my gf, i kept bugging her because she didnt want to. i knew it was against her wishes; but when she said " Baby, just dont get me pregnant ok?" i was so touched. That was when i felt so loved; i didnt need the sex. i just wanted the emotional support that keeps on telling me that i am the most special person in her life, that she would go against her wishes, give me everything she has just to satisfy my needs. She offered herself to me; i am honored, but since i love my gf and i know my gf loves me, i placed her wishes as my number 1 priority.|`|AA11280073	Telling him should be enough. Watch out.

wxgmFWqkaa	Those arent the only way to make friends, those are probably the most least helpful when it comes to making friends.  I always learned that the key to making friends is getting involved!  If a bunch of people are gonna start to play a game or something, ask if you can join in.  You were definitley right about being polite.  "Please" is always helpful.  If you like playing a sport, try signing up to play on a team.  This way, you can have friends in school, and some friends from different schools.  And the number one way to getting more friends, is just being yourself.  Dont do anything stupid to get friends.  People will like you for the person you are.  Trust me, nobody likes someone whos a total fake.  So, just remember, get in the game, start trying even harder, and just be you.  You'll get friends, no matter what happens. Any questions, email me at SandyFerris100@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Trust me, and good luck<br>  Sandy|`|Ve22Y4k8aa	you  have to do more than that.ask them to do something togather like studying,watch movies etc.try to be open with other people|`|4aWKrbQbaa	I just moved to another state and am having the same prob. Part of it is our own insecurity. Instead of just smiling and saying hi - ask them to go do something. A movie, bowling, etc. Take the first step and then maybe I will. ha!|`|IQUlzCdzaa	is not that at all. wall you have to do is just be yourself.  just cuz you smile and say hi most ppl think that its just fake. have you try just being you. sometimes ppl are just rude and just doesn't want to make friends. they just can't handle a friend who is nice and kind. you don't have to change the way you are just to have friends. just be you and if they don't like it then thats there lost. you'll make a great friend and someday those people who you where nice to will realize wat they are missing out on.  don't put yourself down cuz of those loser. real friends are all you can count on.

Dont let him smash you up, I mean unless youre gonna marry this dude dont let him wreck your bizness.  Guys like tight girls, apparently you fall under that category.

You may just not be wet enough =)|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Your first answer is right.  You just need to use a lot of lubricant and take it easy until you get used to it but after no one else will fit (will be big enough) to satisfy you the same way.   I hope you're ready for it.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He can fit. If a baby can come out of that, your bf can go in.|`|kfMPDO2waa	This is not real is it?|`|KmOuWTDkaa	lubricate, lubricate, lubricate. Also you have to really take your time and have lots of foreplay, fingers etc then have him ease it in, seems like it goes in smoother and easier from behind doggy style if it's been a while.

Why would you ask this here?

But you kinda grossed me out.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	GROSS - TMI !!!!|`|WwCBomTMaa	I think the question should be did you make him brush his teeth before he went down on you, since he had thrown up first? Or did the chunks add pleasure?..............very disgusting, TMI!!!!|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Maybe u let one go, and it got him sick .|`|sl8ffVHVaa	he was drunk.....  gross|`|58jwkbbSaa	Maybe cause he was drunk??

ZaMzRSrraa	depends on the intelligence factor not the age factor|`|k73IxCHaaa	This is a difficult question to answer, it would depend upon your intelligence, emotional security and your spiritual strength. However as a mentor people expect wisdom from you. If you lil sisters are your same age, I would suspect that they know you probably don't have as much wisdom to offer them as you should have.    I would suggest that you try and mentor preteens, 12 and under. As they start to develop into women they will need your wisdom and guidance.|`|NHf2E8RXaa	idk|`|MSiPQqNEaa	as long as they are smarter.......................|`|vSecAzECaa	I don't think there's a minimum age difference for that sort of thing.

2si53dCRaa	Even if the guy is "gay" that's not alright.  Personally, me and my gal friends don't grab each other's chests, i mean, the occasional *** slap but that's a little different.  So either way even if he's gay that isn't acceptable behavior.  It's almost like that's her way to have another guy touching her but "it's ok because he's gay"...psssssssh.  If you're taken you're off limits--to EVERYONE.|`|uBssj3Znaa	he is gay ... it isn't like he is going to steal her away from you.     If it really bothers you, tell her how you feel.|`|SzubaKbuaa	That would bother me too...you should tell her. Tell her you understand he is gay, but just seeing another guy doing that to her is hard to see and you don't like it. Tell her you are fine with them being friends, but the physical stuff like what you mentioned is what gets you.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	You are outside of the secret society of players, gay men, and women....I know that for a fact cause you are insecure and jealous...behind your back the gay friend is probably telling your girlfriend 'I wonder what it would feel like to sleep with a girl'...and she'll do it and say to herself it doesn't count as cheating.|`|nAK82h6vaa	If he's gay there's nothing to worry about.|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Honestly I wouldnt tolerate that and I would confront the gay guy and tell him whats up.  If he keeps touching your girl I would beat him down.  Im serious, I would go crazy on the dude.  I dont know how you put up with it this long, after day 1 its should have been settled.|`|wcDy86xuaa	I have several gay friends, and I can tell you that most girls see them as "just one of the girls".

vj2pOgT7aa	Take matters into YOUR OWN hands.  If you really love him, and you have agreed to be monogamous, then you will wait.  If your relationship is only based on physical pleasure, then you should probably end it.    Have you talked to your boyfriend about this?  That might be a good start.  He may very well feel the same temptations you do.    =0)|`|SuKS1OQtaa	Masturbate! It will help a lot! TRUST ME!!!!|`|FIV3ClQsaa	sex toys if you are that desperate.|`|aSjdL4heaa	Humans aren't meant to be separated from the other sex for long periods of time - but our societal norms require it sometimes.    The basis of any good relationship is communication.  If you can't satisfy your desires yourself then you only have a couple of choices.  You can righteously suffer in silence, you can cheat, or you can talk to your bf.      Of the three choices listed above, talking to your bf will probably seem the most difficult, but it is also the right thing to do IMHO.  You'll find out that he is going through the same thing (if he is a guy then I can *Guarantee* he is).  You can then either agree to both continue to righteously suffer (if he is an honest guy then it is not likely), or open up the relationship in some way (maybe he would be ok if you had a gf).    Good luck.

Fu9tlKbhaa	Then don't. You may be best friends, but best friends support each other. She needs to get over it, you are no way shape or form obligated to revolve your life around her all the time. Tell her it is what it is and to stop whining.|`|nMSV2kcVaa	SHE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE CREEPY ATTACHED FRIENDS. TELL HER TO STOP THINKING ONLY BOUT HERSELF. IF SHE DON'T LISTEN ASK HER IF SHE WANTS TO FIGHT YOU. ARRANGE FIGHT, END OF STORY.|`|OgQfw7Qiaa	When i went to high school i very quickly forgot about all my friends from my last school because it is so quick and easy to my friends at high school  i think that your friend is making too big a deal out of this, tell her that she should be looking forward to going to high school and making new friends  you guys can always stay in touch; texting, email, meeting up at weekends etc.    so good luck with everything =D
63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	well to devastated  by the lose of parents is hard by anyone and it does take a long time to heel.. even longer if you have no one else to lean on.   and yes i can understand with your job of having a few friends..maybe its time to put yourself first and your career 2nd.. start dating and yes its never to late to start looking for that special person.. i am still looking and i am about the same age as you|`|AA12198711	It's is so very normal.     You will have a family of your own one day and everything will come together.|`|racnq84Vaa	Yes, it is normal to feel that way.  Get a counselor to talk to and find ways to help others in your spare time.  Like volunteering.  This puts your problems in the back and allows you to see that sometimes others have it worse.  And join a church so you know you will see them again.|`|T4esqtuUaa	yes I think that is normal you have been through a lot and it must be hard I am sure but don't give up. Do you go to church if so then you have the greatest family that a girl could have talk to him and tell God how you feel it will get easier with God's help he will see you through this. I am sorry for you loss but I will pray for you|`|7KAduk1daa	First, I'm sorry to hear about your losses.  I too have lost both of my parents, though I wasn't close at all to my father who died two years ago.  But I can relate to your situation.  When my mother died 22 years ago, I was devastated too.  She was the only person in whom I could confide and trust.  It took me a long time to grieve and that may be the case for you.      First, I would suggest that you stop comparing yourself to what is normal.  Yes, there are rough guidelines for the grieving process and getting on with your life, but everyone and every case is different.  Forget about your age and your current life circumstances in terms of the development and accomplishments of others.  You are where you are in life, and since everything happens for a reason, YOU ARE JUST WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.      So, start by accepting your situation and make peace with it.  Second, love yourself----every single aspect-----regardless of what you may or may not have done.  This is the single-most important thing you can do for yourself.  You will not be able to move forward with your life until you truly love who you are.  This is likely to be a process, so get started on it now.  Third, you surely have unresolved issues in your life, not only with the passing of your parents but also emotional wounds associated with their behaviors toward you when they were alive.  I would look around for professional help.  You will need a qualified practitioner who can help you identify your wounds and help you heal them.  The reason why you are in your 40's and feeling unsatisfied is that these emotional wounds are holding you back.  In terms of self-help, I would highly recommend Dr. Phil McGraw's book "Self-Matters".  It will give you a excellent start to identifying and healing your emotional issues.  It truly helped me.  Check it out from the library, if necessary, but go get it.    Do not even think for one moment that you are "behind" or "abnormal" for being where you are.  There is a divine order to everything even though it appears chaotic to us.  Just start taking the steps now to helping yourself, including loving yourself and bolstering your self-esteem, and you'll be on your way to a better, more fulfilling life.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, my Mother died in 2005, and my Daddy died last summer. I am still kinda devastated, but I do have a son and a daughter in law. I have thought of joining a Grief Support Group. Every Major city has one, but I have a close friend who is a therapist so I have talked to him off and on. Grief is a process and it takes time to recover from the loss of your parents. Try to read a book on grief and try to find a Grief Support Group if you need to. Good Luck!|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	It is perfectly normal to grieve for about after the death of a special loved one, but you have to remember that life goes on and that time is the best healer. I'm sure it is upsetting that you have no other family, but try to look at the other good things in your life. I would get a counsellor so that you feel you have someone to talk to. And don't give up on finding that special someone, because it can happen. Good luck xx|`|TpcrI3rKaa	girl put some nice stilettos  get ur hair done ur nails go clubbing meet some guys pick the rigth guy do the dirty have kids if not adopt.......and always remember that ur loved ones will be watching u from above move on u don't want to let more days go on with u been sad and know put a smile on ur face so they will rest cuz seeing u devastated they will not RIP............BUT LET ME TELL U  SOMETHING IMPORTANT U A STRONG PERSON  :)
Kbcidnh6aa	So if you are in high school, then this can absolutely feel like the world is ending - this is a scary situation. She is telling lies about you, she fabricated evidence because she is jealous. That is not healthy. You don't own people - you cannot steal a friend or a boyfriend and if you and this guy were attracted to each other, that is the way life goes. Unfortunately, people around you, your peers who currently hate you will probably be more interested in the fun drama than the injustice wrought by this Shelby girl, and will stay engaged in it. First off, she is not your best friend - kind of a frenemy. If she is the most popular girl in school I imagine people are scared of her and might believe her no matter how you protest. Please read this site, it explains how manipulative people operate.      http://www.rickross.com/reference/brainw...    Unfortunately, high school can be awful and dramatic, especially if she is gunning for you. The best thing you can do is do better in school, get into a better college, and live a better life than your frenemy. She is already jealous of you - you win. Go to the few people who know you, who know that she is lying, and if they are real friends, they will see the truth and stick by you. Eventually, everyone is going to see what a creep Shelby is. Even if it's not until she's 40. Just give it time and do not let it ruin your chance to create a better future through education. A life lived well is the best revenge - trust me. I've been a mean girl in high school and had to deal with some at 25.|`|Fu9tlKbhaa	First off, get a grip on yourself sweetie. It's not the end of the world, it may seem like it, but it's not. Obviously this girl has no life in putting others down or being selfish. Let her, that's what Karma is for. If she wants to say bad things about you, let her. But in the end she looks like the fool because she has NO LIFE. Keep your head up and smile, and of course don't put up with anything, but don't act like it bothers you either know what I mean? Also don't ever go out with your friends exes, it's just a no-no. Just as no guy would date another dudes girl. It's just respect. I know things just "happen" but don't do it. It just creates drama. Good Luck!
1k7LIZVWaa	If you both "strayed" after two months, you are not ready for a committed relationship.  You are correct, you are not in the right category and you are not mature enough yourself either.  You can't trust him because he has proved to be untrustworthy.  The bigger factor is that you can't be trusted either.  Split up, grow up, and find someone new when you can handle it.|`|nMSV2kcVaa	GET EVEDINCE. THEN THROW IT IN HIS FACE AND KICK HIM TO THE CURB.    MY MA SAYS IF A MAN CHEATS ON YOU HE DOESN'T RESPECT YOU. PERFECT TIME TO CLAIM SOME RESPECT, RIGHT? ? ?|`|W1rCsvTzaa	He either is cheating or is trying to.  You sound perfectly matched since I am sure you would feel justified if a guy you liked made a pass at you right now.  Why stay with someone you actively distrust?|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You don't know it, but you answered your own question quite well.    You can't trust him.  Why are you setting yourself up for a fall?    Find someone you trust, and who is willing to show you love, not  irritation.  Life is short, live it like you mean it.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Doing the same thing over and over again is not progress.  Expecting him to change is fruitless. move on|`|RAGAcJV7aa	by you not confronting him makes you look like abigger fool in his eyes. so what he threatens he will leave tell him goodbye. if hes lying to you that the start of him being asneek aliar and soon to be cheat. if he wasnt doing anything wrong why not tell you he was on the phone with afemale friend. by him not being honest should be a red flag. now if he continues to horse around with you it will be your fault not his. respect yourself and dont take it . there are men out there who will treat you the way your suppose to be treated.|`|Y0356x8faa	don't put up with it - since you aren't married, find someone who WILL be faithful to you. he's not going to change.   still, i wouldn't tell him you're snooping or what you have found until you have LOTS of info ... he will be too careful otherwise. let him think he's getting away with it!|`|BRo2gNkqaa	Maybe you guys need a break but isn't questioning him reason enough that something is going on? maybe it's not meant to be and you deserve someone where you don't have to constant worry about that sort of stuff|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	you need to find someone into you enough that you don't need to snoop around.  The fact you do means the relationship is not going to go anywhere.  It may be innocent that he talks to them on the phone but if he cared for you he would want to be talking to you instead of them.  He is hoping that you do not find out that he is cheating - even if only on a phone - and he means that if you snoop and find out, he will move on to someone who trusts him and doesn't.  You can find someone better closer to your age who doesn't simple want to trade his 40 year old in for a 22 year old.|`|fLASTynLaa	what i would do is leave him. You two just recently started dating, you don't need that kind of stress...ever. If he wants to cheat, he will find a way. Just move on to something better, would you really want to work on a relationship that is doomed from the beginning? No trust = no relationship.|`|i15KoiJhaa	So the 2 of you have only been in this relationship for less then 5 months and already in this time, the both of you have gone outside a mutually agreed upon exclusive relationship...    This is your first red flag.    His Daughters Mom lives in another state and you're worried about him talking to her? She is his teenage Daughters Mom honey and I'm 110% sure they have a lot to discuss on this subject. Who knows what is going on there ya know? Maybe his Daughter isn't doing well in school or has other things going on that have the 2 of them as Parents alarmed... on this one, you're (in my opinion) making to much of it.    The other Woman he called... again hun, you have no idea if it was a Co-Worker, his Sister (if he has one), his sister-in-law (if he has one) his boss... so you're not giving him the benefit of the doubt here.    Trust in a relationship is essential and like I said previously... it is worrisome that in less then 5 months time, BOTH of you have cheated.  It isn't a wonder that you have no trust for one another at this point, the relationship had been new (and still is at 5 months) and the trust was gone early in the relationship, not even really enough time to have build a good, solid foundation or history of trust for one another.    If you want to stay in this relationship and see where it could possibly go and he feels the same... then the 2 of you are going to have to really, REALLY work on your issues... and both of you really think as well why the cheating happened early on to begin with.    Good Luck|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sounds to me like this is a disaster just waiting to happen....    Sorry. But Susie Q. is right.

i15KoiJhaa	Sorry to hear your marriage ended... always painful.    There is ALWAYS something more my dear and other options out there to be discovered.    I do understand that after 25 years of being together with your Wife you feel on uncertain ground and are unsure where to start...    I would suggest getting out there and participating in activities that appeal to you... could be a bowling league, could be golfing, pool whatever you have an interest in that can be done with like minded people that are single as well. Tons of programs out there like that if you take the time to seek them out.    Go into things with the idea of making new friends, networking... and maybe even finding out more about who you are now and what else you might enjoy doing. If you meet someone amazing, then awesome! If you don't right away, then all good as well you're still participating and remaining positive.    At this point, I am feeling from you that it isn't so much that you are looking to get into something right now (because it seems you're still reeling a bit from the end of the marriage) but more looking to feel good again about who you are. The only way to know for sure hun, is to get out there again and participate!     Stay in close contact with your Kids and your other Friends and Family. Know that it is okay to feel a little bummed out that things didn't work out (Like I said... 25 years was a long time!) you loved and cared for another person for 25 years darling and one doesn't just "Get over it"     There is no wrong answer except doing nothing and staying complacent. If you don't live life by participation then you are simply going through the motions.    Hang in there|`|d20mM90uaa	What did you do to her?|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Don't expect it to be easy straightaway.. Living with someone and sharing your life for 25 years is a very BIG DEAL, so I understand ( or atleast I try to) how hard it is for you. Take it easy at first.. and remember, time heals everything!  Don't give up on love, it will find you again!  All the best!|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Get some new hobbies. Join a gym, book club something where you have to meet other people. I am not sure how successful those dating sites are but you could take a peak.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	It's very hard to get back into the grove of things, but it can be done. After you finish wallowing around in depression you will wake up one day and realize you still and can have a good long life. Even with someone else :) You were loved once you can be loved again. If you feel like there could be changes made on your end physical, mental, What ever change them before you get with anyone else. Oh and BTW if you want someone to like you SMILE have confidence. BEST OF LUCK!!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	think of it as a new start on life, you have to keep moving forward now.  Just start over.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	I'm very sorry for you.  But everyone that suggest you get out and join a club of sorts is right.  Join a Gym, like the YMCA -- there are many type people that go there, and many are so friendly.  If you have time to volunteer somewhere -- or Church.  If you don't have one, find one that suits you.    Are your children being supportive?  Do you have grandchildren?  There is a great joy of life.  You will do fine... just give it time, and get out there and do something!|`|jN3pRKkEaa	You should not have been such a jerk to your wife.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I was just wondering about those people who leave their marriage once their youngest turns 18.

Being in denial about your part in your failed marriage only sets you up to make the same mistakes in your next relationship.  You have to face the mistakes and take steps to change that about you.      As for meeting people, don't run to a bar.  Run to the United Way.  Find a way to volunteer in areas you enjoy.  You will meet like minded people while putting others first.  Eventually you will meet someone.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	Being single at 50 is great.

ikhfR33Waa	Have you considered asking her out? I think it's easier and more promising that you pop the question than waiting for her to do it. If you really like her, you should confront her. Most girls like it when the guy initiates the first move. If you're afraid of a rejection, I can only say that "even the biggest failure beats the hell out of never trying". I think regretting what you've done is way better than regretting what you didn't do when you had the chance. Be assertive, don't fret - she's just another girl and she can only say yes or no. Hopefully not the latter! Best of luck :)|`|EcpXBU5Laa	Do you know her? Are you friends? That's always a good place to start, but even then, there's no way to tell whether or not she'll ask you out. If she doesn't know you're interested in her, she might never want to risk the rejection. I would try testing the water a bit, flirting, and see how she reacts. If she seems into it, maybe flirt a little more heavily. Once you know she's interested in you, then maybe you'll have the courage to ask HER out. I think most girls prefer to be asked out anyway, despite what people might say. I know I do! Good luck to ya!|`|129e1a1e6ff300e4f9e959f3be851523aa	Wimp.If you really like her and dont want to let her go just ask her out when you are ready.<br>  <br>  Dont know how old you are but girls never ask the guy out unless they really like them.My ex girlfriend asked me out before i had the chance so that was cool.However allot of girls just wont do it because you have to prove yourself to them and so they dont look slutty.If women always asked men out then they woulld been seen as sluts.Just go and ask her out and if she says no forget about it and find another to ask out<br>  <br>  Ive been rejected 3 times over the last year ,do i care ?Yeah i do but i'll just have to find another that i like|`|VoXX5sFRaa	Therein lies your problem!<br>  <br>  Ask her out.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, but just keep talking and chatting to her normally. If you like each other, it will happen of its own accord.<br>  <br>  'want to go for a drink?' or as I'm older these days (and it sounds less like 'let's get drunk and end up sleeping together'), a coffee are good starters. If you are young, going for a coffee isn't particularly cool though.<br>  <br>  Talk about films - she might mention that she'd like to see such and such, then say 'fancy going to the cinema tomorrow?' If she says no, 'oh OK, just wondered if you'd like to go for a drink sometime'<br>  <br>  Then if she says no, she isn't interested.<br>  <br>  A good idea is to ask her what she does, what she likes and so on. Ask questions about it and she will think you are interested in finding out by her. People often like to talk about themselves.<br>  <br>  Don't interrogate her though! She will ask 'what about you?' and then you get your chance to talk about you (briefly).

Some people like to hide their emotions towards another thinking that their friends might make fun of them or something of the sort. but this is my opinion of course.|`|bFrpW4wFaa	Ya, guys act like jerks a lot when they are with there friends, even if he is by you. If he is nice to you when he is around you when he is not by his freinds he probably does like you. I'd say he does. Good Luck!!!|`|AA10621381	Best way is to have a real conversation with someone he also has real conversations with.  Then with that pressure off because of the third party just ask.<br>  <br>  Beware of guys that don't have real conversations with anyone you can approach.|`|nnbPWunHaa	body language... the way he looks at you and always trying to talk to you... stuff like that|`|hVg6huNmaa	Does he make eye contact, flirt with you when you look at him looks away quickly? if you talk to him you will be able to tell and find out|`|AA11574825	if you only knew RO as if he ever really did, then you would surly know "Y" his repROductive organ is like a hardcopy of my playstation2, when i display every weapon in forms of that EARthly {S}word stuck in that STONEntity named AUTHOR.|`|AA11260453	same exact situation with me!!<br>  <br>  i think that he only acts like a jerk because he doesn't want hsi friends to know that he likes you<br>  <br>  confront him about it, just be like<br>  <br>  hey why do you act all different with me around your friends?<br>  <br>  if he hugs you, you cath him staring at yu, and he talks to you alot<br>  he likes you :]]]]
WOw41TUxaa	Love take's time.<br>  Wait on it, you'll find the answer sooner or later ^_^.|`|VzHS8fA8aa	Never email more than twice.  If he doesn't respond, he isn't interested.  Guys hate girls who chase.|`|emvkaNcSaa	why dont you just go up to him..and tell him "I really like you"..then you could ask him out..Then if he says yes[Which i'm sure he might say]..then everything is going to fine.<br>  xD|`|9FJF1RnOaa	if hes like me then he never has time to check his email, he forgets, or he lost your email address, or he forgot his lol|`|Rl44UAZHaa	talk 2 him!!! he'll never know how you feel unless you tell him. whats the worst that could happen?|`|bf70a2ec95e7c04a35d6f13f642ba5d0aa	just email him.|`|ee203hT5aa	Try to see him inperson. He likes you but mabey he is shy or simply doesnt know how to ask you. Or mabey he is afraid or rejection & simply enjoys being your freind..
TkDJxRmDaa	Most guys who are willing to wait until marriage do so for religious reasons, so if that's what you're looking for, try a Christian Congregation.<br>  <br>  I couldn't wait.  In hindsight, it would have been cool if I DID wait, but.... the flesh is weak on a hormonally-charged teen/young adult and I was a good talker, so you know........|`|2BLTwiSYaa	I would be willing to wait for the right girl, but there had better a lot of sex after we marry.lol  oh,  I have never cheated on a girl and never will.

That is, if my fiance would agree...wait,, she would have to agree or I wouldn't marry her! That's how I know I've chose the right one!|`|6dc9621b27b649b9879d4d153b2fe3a5aa	No, sorry.|`|Iq6qxKePaa	hell no!!!!!|`|O9sLeTSOaa	Yes there are plenty of guys.

Throughout high school, I had to beat girls off with a bat. I'd have naked girls sitting on top of me and I'd come up with some excuse like, "I don't have anything" - meaning a condom. One girl replied, "neither do I, I just got tested." I made a "B-line" for the door. <br>  <br>  Once I got to college, the temptation was all too great. So man ladies, so little time (only 4 years!!!) Less than 1 week in, I turned into a hoe. <br>  <br>  Do men cheat? Yes. 90%? Probably more like 95%.
dfb4e21dc2629309468c75ead172e732aa	Guess that would depend on how old you are. For teenagers, I'd say one or two years difference is normal, and for adults, well ten years give or take would suffice. I'm 36, and my range would be between 25-45, maybe a couple of years either way.|`|AA10561878	Why are you, A MALE asking other men this question ?
ebuxHnScaa	You are 19 years old and need to start living your own life. Try not to upset your parents if you don't have to, but you have to live your life.|`|AA11348003	You sound like the typical young man around when I was your age....nothing wrong with that. Your depression is however very dangerous to your self worth and being. <br>  Stop feeling guilty about it NOW! You are the sum of your upbringing. Your parents obviously are not really into the "God" thing. They do not practice what they preach. Please seek out someone locally that does believe in "what they preach", true God believers "abound". And I will not kid you, you have a long road before you find "God". I did and now am much happier with myself.|`|57sjuWAgaa	to say that you donot beleive in god  just for the sex  is wrong, look  if i were you  i always will fallow those who older than me, they can old fashion but somehow they got a point of view, sex is  an insect in side human being and everyone have their urges  inside him, if i were you i would be moderate  in my life,|`|AA10561878	Move out Buddy, your 19, It's your life.
569b52e9f2702299d9ac9e8475574e6baa	It's very sad when someone has such an addictive personality, and when they go back and do something so awful after being hit with something so wicked as cancer too.  I've seen it before.<br>  <br>  I know a gal who's a nurse. Both she and her husband SMOKE like chimneys.  They had kids.  They smoked in that small apartment when their kids were little and BOTH those kids developed asthma, asthma SO BAD they were constantly in the hospital.  Did they QUIT??  NO!!  Did they stop smoking indoors?? NO.<br>  <br>  Both boys developed juvenile diabetes too.  Now the "boys" are grown and THEY BOTH SMOKE TOO.  They have constant serious life threatening episodes and on top of it all they do DRUGS too.<br>  <br>  What great role models those parents are huh?<br>  <br>  The nurse herself developed cervical cancer, had her uterus out.  It scared her enough to quit for several months.  Once she knew her cancer was ALL gone with the surgery, she went back to smoking.<br>  <br>  What are you going to do with people like that?<br>  <br>  I hope it teaches you something however, and I hope you don't end up "walking in daddy's footsteps" which sadly usually one of the children DO end up doing.<br>  <br>  You can't do anything.  All I would do if I were you is tell your father how disappointed I am in him, that he would rather choose a cigarette and die early in life than choose LIFE and be able to spend it with you.<br>  <br>  Tell him you will miss his being a part of your life because he will die much earlier than he need to.<br>  <br>  Maybe some deep reality hurts like that will get through to him.|`|kJ7YFQiEaa	well as you know smoking can be addictive.<br>  those people who smokes says that it releases stress.<br>  so maybe he is stressed out about something.<br>  what you can do for him is to get that specialized gum that he can chew to make him wanna stop.<br>  you could also have a talk with him.<br>  or you can just pray and hope for the best.<br>  well good luck.<br>  my prayers r with your family.|`|7tNv9T3oaa	TELL HIM TO STOP SMOKING TO CHEW GUM.|`|AA10561878	He has a death wish.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Remind him that hes putting his everything he has and worked hard for in jeopardy, all for a stupid cancer stick. <br>  <br>  its very very very hard for people to just.....STOP smoking. i dont know why they even started in the first place when they know its dangerous. whats so curious about wanting to put poison in your body. i will never get it.
VsXqP7taaa	A college not in your area is more expensive---and if it's in another state, out-of-state tuition is very expensive. Living in a dorm or renting an apartment with all the electric, heat, food expenses----who do you think is going to finance this?<br>    So, get a full-time job to pay for all these extra expenses you want and go 'start your life'----college?  Maybe you'll have time for that someday.|`|AA10558731	If it went down like that, it seems they're being unreasonable. However, we're hearing only one side of the story ~ yours.<br>  <br>  Did they offer to pay for your education at a local college and allow you to continue living with them in an effort to offset the cost of a college education? It seems to me that might precipitate an argument such as you describe.<br>  <br>  If they can't afford to pay for you to go to the college of your choice, they may have a valid point. Do you have any chance at a scholarship that can pay for at least part of your education at an out-of-town college? And if you responded in an angry manner to their point of view, leading to the argument about living with them, it may have made them feel justifiably angry at you, considering you to be immature & selfish.<br>  <br>  Whatever. You really should talk this out with your parents. Communication with *them* is the key, not communication with us folks at Yahoo Answers.|`|nQhDrfblaa	No, it's not a bad thing that you would like to be independent of your parents post- high school graduation.  However, it is concerning that your English is rather poor.  You may find it difficult to support yourself, and pay for a college education on your own, with such a poor vocabulary.  Maybe you should consider spending the first two years at home and then moving out on your own?|`|UIhbJjQFaa	they dont want you to go to far away, they are only saying this because they love you. You are right to want to start your own life, tell your parents that going to a different college will improve your education and you wont be as dependant on them in the future, make sure they know you still love them but you cant live with them forever|`|qvhTqEtRaa	Its not bad that you want to be indepedent.  That is a good thing!  BUT!  Please just make sure you weigh all of your options!  There is no need to "start your life" and then have to move back in with your parents at a later date. Hear them out!  See what they have to say.  Maybe instead of arguing, you can all sit down and discuss like adults and compromise what you both want!|`|x22uyDa9aa	Not at all. It's completely normal for most kids to want to get away from home, and experience new things. (Off living on their own, etc.)<br>  They should respect your wishes to go somewhere else and have new experiences. Just because you want to go somewhere else doesn't mean you want to leave just to get away from them.|`|ejXt2acnaa	one, its ok to wanna get out of your hometown almost everyone does. two, uve been living with your parents since ever so  it should be ok with them tht u wanna get out and explore the world. in any case, your mom and stepdad are retarded.|`|yEYZeDp9aa	no thats not a bad thing that you want your idependance, thats a good thing. to be honest though you may be better going to college, then getting into work, and then moving out.<br>  <br>  This way you will be able to stand on your own two feet.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ;-)|`|9Etl9AzJaa	No, that is not a bad thing. But I don't think you've given enough information. Is there some reason your parents don't want you to go to school out of town?|`|dnVcmEJBaa	no if you wanna be independent you should room with a couple of friends or live by yourself!
KYRlwl8laa	IF she doesn't annoy me|`|uiv1A7B1aa	I think that the whole "you just know" thing is kinda misleading. I mean, just look at that movie two (or four, I forgot) weddings and a funeral, that guy had been broken up with that girl for a long time, but he was in love with her and DIDN'T KNOW IT!...'course that was a movie, but that still happens in real life.|`|AA11085153	It's something you know when you look into his/her eyes and just feel. You get kinda weak in the knees and all you wanna do is be with them and make them feel good.  =)|`|uIDjAcxCaa	When I am with the person and they do something that causes me to think "I love you"... but refrain from saying it.  After that happens like fifteen times... I'm certain.|`|ouBIJyQyaa	you wouldn't be asking this question if you were in love...there wouldn't be a question 2 ask...you would just know|`|zzaScg0haa	It's something you just know|`|qCd4T4o5aa	You go with the flow, if you receive love then you can give it...|`|JIJInNY0aa	- When you can't get them out of your head<br>  - You associate every song with them in some way<br>  - You get butterflies everytime you hear their voice or see them.<br>  - You keep their texts/emails<br>  - You'd do anything to make them happy.|`|HvUurCygaa	IT comes in time.<br>  & WHEN it comes YOU know it.......<br>  <br>  IS not somethink that 'YOU  can dirsrcipe it'....................|`|YhrU1Rwjaa	the love feeling...|`|sAETrH2aaa	you will just know....
RRIs5SHiaa	You already have all the conversation starters you need... you just need to pull them out of your brain.  Perhaps when you wake up in the morning, grab a newspaper or go online to some news site and do some reading... you could even go onto some site that has odd readings (like frivilous lawsuits... anything really that interests you/her).  Basically you are just trying to stimulate your mind so when you start talking to her you don't tense up and say, "what do I say now?"  You'll already have something to talk about.  "Did you hear about this?" (if your interested in doing the talking) or "what do you think about this?" (if you want to find out what makes her tick more)  If the conversation is fluid, then it will change to something else progressively... but by that time you should already be in.  But especially if shes someone new in your life, you should always have a battle plan and be as prepared as possible.  Best of luck...|`|w9TCOXBEaa	tell her straight up!!<br>  <br>  "Look i like you and im gonna be honest with you. iam running out of things to talk and it makes me nervous around you i don't want to feel that way!" <br>  <br>  if not talk about what she likes her interests and hobbies bring up stuff that she does pay attention to her also!|`|NFPVBdKuaa	why dont you find out what she likes and talk about stuff shes into
034289d2e5f2ba9ddcddc9d244cfea7eaa	More often people ask obscured questions with little inside information.<br>  <br>  Yours is a case of boy loves girl or is attracted to girl:<br>  a)  You say this boy is your brother's friend. Yes he can be close to your brother and love you at the same time. No prohibition on that.<br>  <br>  b)  You did not say how old both of you are. But if you are younger (under-age) then it is liking just for playing young games.<br>  <br>  c)  If you are old enough (mature) to date then you have got an intimate admirer. He should come out and say it. People say "actions speak louder than words". This is an exageration of the truth. "Truth is if you like or love someone. Tell him or her".<br>  <br>  d)  Just wait for him and see what he has in store for you? You should have asked him why he was doing that and what the purpose was.<br>  <br>  e)  The next time he visits just ask him to talk to you rather than merely touching you all over the body without an intended advance talk or negotiation as it appears.|`|8nlTBtbPaa	he wants to feel the baby.|`|HwlBgOEraa	WTF???? <br>  <br>  Maybe he wanted to tickle you and he was nervous. Or maybe his hands were cold (LOL i dunno). I'm pretty sure thats flirting in a really odd way.|`|uVZN00kgaa	Maybe he wanted to get to second base but was testing the waters...?

OrV0IBpQaa	alright, today (2 days later) is a good day to call her, u shouldnt call her over the weekend and monday will be too far in time.<br>  <br>  what to say? make it quick and to the point, do not try to spend too much time on the phone as it is a turn off. just say "hi xxx (her name) it's xxx (yours) the amazingly good loocking guy you had a smoke with at ur front door... u been alright? ---good am glad. what are you up to tomorrow nite? dont you fancy winning a teddy bear for me playing darts at the Fair? excellent! meet u at 6" <br>  <br>  just follow the pattern, try to make her laugh (the goodlooking bit and the teddy bear) and you are also being straight forward. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|L1qQBNbbaa	The minute you've got something fun to do phone her and find out what day she can do it on.Please just be extra careful and read this girl's facial expressions don't move too quick.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	never lol|`|OblB2p7xaa	Yes, thats good. Its good that you waited a couple days.. She will get anxious if you wait too much longer.

So what are you waiting for? call her already! :)|`|63a024e9868e83b8b39a0cb132b6d0ddaa	Soon, don't let her get into the weekend party seen where you can easily be forgotten!|`|HwlBgOEraa	you've waited long enough. just call.|`|j1jdfDHJaa	2-3 days is good.

But since we're all grown here, I say that if you're really feeling her, call her tonight.That way she know that you are interested, and you get your date. Believe me, females hate it when men beat around the bush. My boyfriend met me on New Year's Eve and called me that night, and we've been together for a while. Call her!|`|MxsCmvxoaa	That is so cute!<br>  <br>  <br>  Friday night will be the perfect time to call her, u will not seem desperate or like u don't care...as for the date...just throw the question out and she will tell you when it will be okay for u two to go on a date... It might be too soon in my opinion, I know that guy's hate the phone convos but u have to learn how to crawl before walk....or maybe ask her if u could go see her at her house.<br>  <br>  <br>  The best of luck to u!
iYxsYqeXaa	the best thing to do would be to talk to him. and you probably have heard that one a million times, but its something that needs be done! i know at first you might feel embarrassed, but if you really like this guy and want more out of the relationship, you need to get the 411, you need to find out just what he wants out of this relationship, because it could just be a waste of your time... just come out and tell him that he asked you to be his girlfriend months ago, but that your not acting like a couple. maybe he really likes you, but he is extremely shy about holding hands or kissing. sometimes it has to do with the way he was raised. some families teach their children not to be too serious with someone until your older or sometimes even married. how people can get married to someone who doesn't show affection is beyond me. but i hope i could help you out a little. good luck with everything sweetie!|`|tkRakRN1aa	You need to talk to him and find out if a relationship is what he wants or if he just wants a friendship. If all he wants is a friendship, you already have that and nothing will change. If he wants a relationship, you both need to work on getting to know each other, holding hands, just be more open with each other. Otherwise things will never change|`|9KAFzSwGaa	you should tell him how you feel or ask him what is going on with ur guys relationship. tell him that ur wanting to feel like ur in a relationship. I'm sure you dont want to waste time trying to figure out where ur relationship is going. It sounds like he also isn't too sure if he's really wanting a relationship. that or he just doesn't know what to do now that he's in a relationship with you.|`|djX6xJK3aa	Everything you just said - say it to him. If it would be easier you can email him, but you guys need to work on being more open with eachother and saying this to him in person would be a big step.|`|opX7k8yfaa	I had this happen last year. Unfortunately, I ended up breaking up with him...<br>  HOWEVER, you just need to talk to him. Tell him that this is important to you, and hopefully he will listen.|`|EWd5IofMaa	well talk to him about this and don't be nervous because he is your boyfriend u should be comfortable to talk to him so be prepared and let it out|`|w1mt7ablaa	It's normal, pre kiss butterflies.

If he starts a different subject, stick it to him that you want to stay on one subject, and don't want to talk about other things than that you would like to feel as if you were actually in a relationship.  If he is truly someone that loves you, he will listen and work with you to make it better.  If he is just using you he won't listen, and might break up with you because he thinks you expect too much of him.  But like I said, if he cares about you as much as you care about him, he will want you to be happy, demanding or not.
8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	Hi<br>  <br>   oky let's calm down, So you like this guy while the guy likes <br>   your cousin . Girl , you got compettion on your hands. and you know it you want him more and can't resisnce . I know that feeling.   you know whicha got to do is , win the compettion .<br>   Here is how u win, <br>  <br>  1.) yeah , guys can't help themselves from hot girls that are pretty hot. But looks arn't everything , what about personaibly <br>  attiude , instead of just a stare.  well, if you want to <br>  then wear something amazing , it shows off some skin .<br>   try a new make over, go over, find out what make up makes u<br>  feel hot. Don't wear too much, just aliittle bit of eye linder <br>  and stuff . and don't wear something too revealing .<br>  <br>   2.) Don't be friends with him,  Let him know that you exist! Usually unless a guy likes you or unless you’re already friends with him, he might not even know you exist. While I’m sure you girls want the guy to do all the asking, it doesn’t hurt to get things started and go talk to him and just find out some things about him and let them know some things about you, i.e. your name. If they can remember that much, then things are going well. flirt with him almost every second . he flirts back . see him more than your cousin . Be a tease.<br>  <br>  3.) Participate! Not only find out what they’re interested in, but also try to participate in that activity as well. If they enjoy playing video games, then go play video games. If they like to play sports, then go and play the same sport! If it’s running around like a little girl, then go run around like a little girl with him…actually go find another guy if the guy you have in mind does that. It’s ok if you’re around watching, but then he might be more likely to be involved in the activity than to be paying any attention to you. So go and play or participate. They’ll definitely remember you if you’re playing and you catch the winning touchdown pass.<br>  <br>  Keep in contact. Now that you’ve found out the interests of the guy you have in mind, and even participated in those interests, it’s time that you keep in contact. This doesn’t mean that you become a stalker, but that you should keep talking to the guy. You don’t have to be talking about anything serious or thought provoking, it can be as simple as finding out how his day was. The more you keep in contact, the more likely they’ll want to keep in contact with you. Again, remember to not overdo it and become a stalker.<br>  <br>  Get know him, do this before he makes your cousin , his girlfiriend Smile!Give the guy a smile when you see him. Letting him see you with a smile will make a big difference when trying to keep his attention. It might even brighten his day to see you with a smile and to know that you’re smiling at him. When in doubt, just smile!<br>  <br>  Food! As you may have heard the saying go, “The best way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” What better way to impress a guy than to bring him food. Find out what foods he likes, goto restaurants where he has a favorite dish. Offer to bring him some cookies or snacks. Even better if you bake or cook them yourself. If a guy’s full, then he’s happy. So try to help the guy you have an interest in have a full stomach. If he remembers you as helping to feed him, he’ll definitely remember you and will want to be around you as well.<br>  <br>   Finally, once he is into you call u , flirts with u , <br>  to find out if he likes u .|`|JimeDRdkaa	Nah, drop him and find someone else. Thats like vomiting and laying in it. Why keep hurting yourself. <br>  BTW just 1 date isn't enough to really know someone. You will<br>  probably find out he isn't all that later from your cousin if she<br>  does go with him.  If he is just judging by what he sees as someone better looking then he is light weight and not deep.<br>  You don't want someone like that. That isn't cool.|`|fZYauAIjaa	i don't see why you have to stop being his friend, but you need to stop falling for him. just let him be with your cousin if thats what he wants. maybe they'll break up and he'll need somebody to get him through it.   thats were you come in.|`|PS5TGqLdaa	be friends if he is every girls dream guy--be happy that you are his friend and not every girl is--appreciate the little things in life-not every guy is going to like you and be happy with your cousin|`|LGv3BByhaa	He is interested in your cousin and not you.

This isn't your cousin's fault to begin with, she did nothing wrong and neither did you. The guy you are crushing on also doesn't know how you feel for him so maybe that is why he said the stuff he did about your cousin. Keep being friends with him, being friends is a good start, trust me I am learning myself. Don't tell him how you feel quite yet, let it keep going. You'll be suprised with the results.|`|h4kl18OOaa	You barely know the guy that likes your cousin because she is beautiful??<br>  <br>  Why would you want to be the 3rd wheel??<br>  Get out of that relationship.  If your cousin is interested in him, you need to back off and move on.  He isn't worth your time.<br>  <br>  You deserve better.  How can you fall for someone that isn't even in like with you??
wCnbeHeAaa	I completely agree.  Its good to see a man who wants to be on an equal level with his partner.  If she demands something of you, it should be understood that the new "rule" applies to both of you.  If you put the toilet seat down, she puts the toilet seat down.  If you don't flirt/get involved with the opposite sex too much, she does the same.  It's only fair.  A healthy relationship works when both parties treat each other equally and uphold the same expectations.|`|nQhDrfblaa	Tell your fiance that if she is going to ask that you not do something, that out of respect, you wish for her to not do it as well.  She will likely understand.  In the event she doesn't then continue doing the activity you were asked not to do that she has continued to do.  Eventually through action and conversation, your point will be reinforced.|`|VjiP8oqBaa	I think she should treat you like You like YOU want to be treated.  And obviously you should treat her like SHE wants to be treated.  The two of you may not have the same gripe about the same thing.  So that's why the same rules don't always apply to each other.  Give my rule a whirl and I think you'll see a diff.|`|AA11480429	It's tough.  I tend to side with women because I think on some level that men should cater to women, and protect them in a way that is not possible for a woman to do.  I think respect and communication are very important, and you'll know if you're being disrespected.  Keep honest and play fair.|`|f026e402307a5782423e289bfa1e3213aa	Yeah, it's only fair that the same rules apply to both of you. A girl cannot honestly say that the rules are different for her just because she wants to restrict you and have fun herself.<br>  <br>  Talk to her about this, before complications arise.|`|73e1265991767c4d53c4fa95c30f49e6aa	Depends on what it is I guess.

It will be creepy if you just keep on stalking him. And it may be hard at 1st but try just being his friend. Then get to know some new guys and i can't guaranteed you will get over him completely but you will start to see him more as a friend. Also start hanging with some guys.|`|BiwVaneuaa	You cant make a guy feel what he doesnt feel. You may have to take the pain and go on to another.|`|JHzP1qtoaa	Move on.

Life is too short for unrequited love. Your limerence may just need time to see who is important to him. back off a little but be a friend. Sometimes one needs to have a realization, but you can't push it from your end.|`|2juOgMzHaa	Ouch. I know how you feel. Hate to say this, but the posts above me are right. You can't force him to like you. You can do your best to try to get him to like you, but if he's just not interested, you'll have to move on.|`|gqr2wmUUaa	Just wait I guess. You can't force him to love you so there really is nothing you can do. You did do a good job by letting him know that you like him though. That way if this girl he likes rejects him he will become yours. = )|`|SC2rt73daa	sweetie move on there are more men in this world than that one.

Ishmeet Singh. I don't consider him to be a person among Sikh Community. Music is an Art and I consider every Art performer to be a member of Human Race as such. Because he is an asset for the entire humanity. I am also in grief after listening the news about his death. But the law of nature or Karma philosophy, everybody takes birth to take an account of his Karmas, whether in debit or in Credit. When is account gets over, God calls him back. Since he was a very thorough gentleman, I pray God to make him free from the vicious circle of birth and death. May his spirit rest in peace.

Me parece que tu nombre es Angelita.<br>  Fíjate que nunca me pongo a escribir a alguien que no conozco, de hecho es la primera vez que lo hago.<br>  Al sentir una especie de lástima al leer tu comentario, me atrevo a pedirte permiso para enviarte algunas palabras...<br>  No voy a hablar de tu marido porque nadie está autorizado para juzgar a nadie. Pero sí sé que tanto él como tú necesitan mucha ayuda; él necesita acudir a centros para rehabilitarse del alcoholismo además de eliminar muchos aspectos de esa personalidad tan agresiva y celosa, quizás él necesite aumenta su autoestima de manera humilde y necesita reonocer y sensiblilizarse, hacerse consciente de lo que la falsa personalidad y el vicio provocan en él, en ti y en los ni?os, que es algo parecido al infierno.<br>  En cuanto a ti Angelita, también debes acudir a alguien para que te brinde su ayuda, también en Internet hay mucha ayuda, a mi me ayudó extraordinariamente una página titulada www.anael.org en la cual viene mucha información que estoy seguro también te servirá, ten confianza.<br>  Cómo entiendo bien cuando tu dices que cuando te decides a hablar con él las piernas te tiemblan y por el pavor las palabras no fluyen, eso es normal en una situació así pero, ?qué crees? en ti está gran parte de la salida. Busca en lo más profundo de tu ser las respuestas, estoy seguro que estas brotarán y llegarán como un alivio, nunca te rindas, las mujeres pueden con eso y más, pero es también un deber para ti y para con tus hijos empu?ar la espada de la voluntad y abrir senda donde no la hay, abrir tu corazón al amor, aunque de momento sientas que Dios se ha ido de tu casa. <br>  Bueno, tú querías algunas palabras de aliento, espero que estas hayan sido las apropiadas.

Para los adolescentes, cuando se pasa la barrera de los 30, nos convertimos en solterones amargados, porque no se explican de que otra manera uno podría estar solo en la vida. Y hay que aceptarlo, como tantas otras cosas sin sentido se mastican y se tragan.

Pero hay dos aspectos que dejaron de lado. Las mujeres solteras de mas de 30 (ojo: algunas) realmente tienen cierta bronca (no necesariamente grave, pero hay casos mas severos) ya sea de inseguridad, de inestabilidad, la carga de la soledad, represion sexual (algunas, lo digo porque me tocó ayudar a una a liberarse) o ser intolerante (eso de la pareja ayuda mucho a limar ciertso rasgos problematicos del caracter). El otro aspecto es que las solteras mayores de 30 pueden ser muy seguras de si mismas, muy exigentes de sus parejas, tanto que nunca hay tipo a la altura... con lo que logran una cadena de relaciones fracasadas y cada vez les resulta mas temible el intentarlo pues saben que al poco tiempo al principe le van a ver los defectos y lo van a mandar a volar.<br>  <br>  Entonces, no es que sean todas amargadas, pero algunas pocas hay. Y no es que no sepan vivir, de hecho si lo saben, pero hay algunos riesgos de que su soledad les condicione ciertas dificultades. Aclaro que las divorciadas son cuento aparte, solo estamos hablando de las que se han conservado solteras. Saludos!|`|TlWns1Fjaa	Yo tengo más de 30 y desde antes de cumplirlos ya mi familia me llamaba "amargada". Con el tiempo comprendí que lo decían porque en su lógica (quizás en lo general) una mujer soltera, siempre debe verse bien, conservarse atractiva (si algún día desean tener pareja), eso de "estar bien consigo mismas" lo tildan de anticuado y puerta falsa que oculta otras situaciones.<br>  <br>  Creo que les intriga que hayan mujeres de más de 30 solteras, así sin compromiso y sin vistas de buscarlo. Todo va más allá de lo sexual, primero observan tu entorno (profesión, trabajo) y sobre su percepción opinan aunque finalmente lleguen a ese punto.<br>  |`|OtnrMtCAaa	Eso era antes...<br>  Pero si aún existen hombres que piensan que una mujer es una amargada porque decide vivir su vida sin ataduras y emplear su tiempo en lo que a ella le apetece... no será por envidia ?<br>   No crées que es síntoma de un retrógrado machista?<br>   No será que para éstos hombres , toda mujer DEBE Y TIENE que vivr como lo hizo su madre , su abuela?.<br>  <br>  Mi apoyo incondicional a aquellas mujeres que deciden voluntariamente ser solteras. <br>  <br>  Un saludo.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Michelle jajajajajaja,  perdona que me ría....pero qué tiene que ver la soltería con el sexo?  <br>   <br>  Creo que andas un pelín despistada y parece mentira que siendo tú mujer pienses así .<br>   Por cierto, deberías de saber que los ni?os no vienen de París , que el ratoncito Perez no existe.....en fin! habla con tus papás.|`|ZVVXrJsdaa	jajajaja y ellos cuando pasan esa edad y no están casados que te crees que son????? amargados y ma?osos.<br>  Mejor que se a callen,sera por envidia porque los solteros no tienen nadie que los moleste y hacen de su vida lo que quieren. |`|nbeiSghAaa	Porque quieren a una de 20 para hacerla a su modo.<br>  <br>  <br>  El miedo por delante.|`|jwTLEzvfaa	Se sienten jovenes eternamente nunca maduran es por eso.|`|YLMQA40jaa	no es tanto que sean amargadas lo que pasa es que se vuelven mas estrictas a la hora de andar con una persona por lo mismo que tu mencionas por que son mas experimentadas y con capacidad y toma en cuenta una cosa que la mujer tiene la ventaja en una relacion son mas listas por ese lado me duele decirlo pero es la verdad mas que todo por la edad que tienes se generaliza y los puntos a grandes rasgos son exigentes, serias, y en algunos casos formalizar algo de matrinonio por eso la mayoria de los hombres toman su distancia espero haberte ayudado.|`|f174e2abc83e7f78801174af22f21d42aa	No es solo a las mujeres a mi me joden con lo de la edad mis amigos y amigas también.

Aquí hay algunas razones de por qué:<br>  <br>  Una mujer de más de 40 nunca te va a despertar en la mitad de la<br>  noche para preguntarte "Qué estás pensando?"-. No le interesa lo que<br>  estás pensando.<br>  <br>  Si una mujer de más de 40 no quiere mirar un partido de fútbol no da<br>  vueltas alrededor tuyo. Se pone a hacer algo que ella quiere hacer y<br>  generalmente es algo mucho más interesante.<br>  <br>  Una mujer de más de 40 se conoce lo suficiente como para estar<br>  segura de si misma, de lo que quiere, y de con quién lo quiere, son muy<br>  pocas las mujeres de más de 40 a las que les importa lo que tu pienses<br>  de lo que hace ella.<br>  <br>  Una mujer de más de 40 ya tiene cubierta su cuota de relaciones<br>  "importantes" y "compromisos". Lo último que quiere en su vida es otro<br>  amante posesivo.<br>  <br>  Las mujeres de más de 40 están dignificadas. Es muy raro que entren<br>  en una competencia de gritos en el medio de la ópera o en el medio de<br>  un restaurante caro. Por supuesto que si piensan que te lo mereces no<br>  van a dudar en dispararte un tiro.<br>  <br>  Las mujeres de más de 40 son generalmente generosas en alabanzas.<br>  Ellas saben lo que es no ser apreciadas lo suficiente.<br>  <br>  A una mujer de más de 40 le queda bien el lápiz de labio rojo<br>  brillante. Esto no es así en mujeres jóvenes.<br>  <br>  Las mujeres de más de 40 tienen suficiente seguridad en sí mismas<br>  como para presentarte a sus amigas. Una mujer más joven puede llegar a<br>  ignorar hasta a su mejor amiga.<br>  <br>  Las mujeres de más de 40 se vuelven psíquicas a medida que pasa el<br>  tiempo... No necesitas confesar tus pecados, ellas siempre saben.<br>  <br>  Son honestas y directas. Te dicen directamente que eres un imbécil<br>  si es lo que sienten sobre ti.<br>  <br>  Los hombres tenemos muchas cosas buenas que decir de las mujeres de<br>  más de 40 y por múltiples razones.<br>  <br>  Lamentablemente no es recíproco. Por cada impactante mujer de más de<br>  40, inteligente, bien vestida, sexy, hay un hombre de más de 40 .<br>  pelado, gordo, en pantalones amarillos haciéndose el gracioso con una<br>  mujer de 20.<br>

She might tell you to break up with him or she might just be cool with it and figure you're old enough now.|`|gu4pwW7uaa	don't worry about it, your still young. u have plenty of time to have bf/s|`|upIrlDm5aa	just keep going out wiht him.....every lie catches up with you|`|ehmNhHwGaa	of course|`|5qfGcbgHaa	your mum is worried and so she should you will understand when you get older |`|VNC57Ojwaa	I'm 13 and one of my really close friends is a boy and he is 14.  He drives me crazy.  But I realized even though I kind of like him and I think he likes me its not worth it. I've been friends with him since like 5th grade.  At this age it can't possibly end up being a long term relationship.  So decided to make my parents happy and not risk my friendship with him. I understand what you are going through. But understand friends are forever but boys are not. So I made him my friend.  WHen I am older and I have guys old enough to drive me around I will date party hard.  But for now I am simply happy with being a confused 13 year old.  I hope you take my advice.  Good Luck!|`|jXUrfToKaa	you need to talk to your mom. ask her her reasons about the no dating rule.<br>  <br>  ask her to bend a little. not full on dating, like car dates. because, hell, that is a big step, but just phone dating. you can have a 'boyfriend', he can call you, etc.|`|N6kp8UQuaa	I have been telling my mom i have been going to the movies with my best friend and she keeps buying it....... i think you should just keep dating the boy/guy.....<br>  <br>  HOPE THAT HEPLS!|`|X9ABSQ7kaa	omg! were the same im not alowed 2 date either but i really love the guy so i kinda tell my mom i like him but not say were going out. get it?<br>  |`|h0Aexd5haa	ya. i know its hard to keep a relationship like dat. i did it for 5 months once. if you really love him itll work out|`|nCJHhDFcaa	no u cant but u can keep it a secret while u can =]|`|jFGZpm0Vaa	I tried that...didnt work really.

iHJ6W3Izaa	Omg, i have the same problem with mine.<br>  Except we're going on our 11th month.<br>  <br>  I guess some guys just like having their<br>  gf with them all the time. I know... sometimes<br>  it might be too much and suffocating i understand...<br>  and idk if uve done this but, sometimes i try to<br>  avoid his hugs or push him away cos he constantly<br>  does that. <br>  <br>  there are many reasons i can think of why some<br>  guys are like this.<br>  <br>  1. they must like you way too much.<br>  2. they have always been like this with every girl.<br>  3. they just have to have you with them the whole<br>      time cos you're his girlfriend (and i hate that)<br>      because sometimes they get to the point where<br>      they dont want you to hang out with friends.<br>  4. he just wants to feel on you. sorry if its offending<br>      but many guys are perberts and thats why they<br>      are always hugging their gfs a lot.|`|vVO7Xlauaa	Sorry to say, but that is not a good sign of a healthy relationship. He could become too over possessive and that can create real problems. Try to talk to him about how you feel, and let him know, if he does not show you a little respect for your feelings, the relationship, cannot last.|`|nV7fD5Uraa	Eh that's a little too close too soon. Better tell him that or you'll tire of it, and he won't understand why. In previous relationships the girls he's been with probably loved to be held, and he's assuming all other girls are the same.|`|EhJlgKLAaa	my boyfriend is like that too. i used to hate it but now  ive been with him for 8 months and almost don't like it when he isnt holding me.|`|gP2idgG4aa	I have the same problem! I just talked to my BF about it, and he quit holding me so much- he was really cool about it all. Just talk to him and say you want him to back off a little. |`|luzxbhuHaa	Would you rather a guy who shows no physical interest in you? Doesn't hold your hand, doesn't hug you, doesn't want to be with you all the time?|`|UVciAbXxaa	some f us guys just like to hold are girl close. if u dont like it all the time tell him he should understand.

Some do it at that moment because they think thats the way its suppose to be, but it is not. Take it from someone who experienced an amazing unforgettable first kiss.  It doesn't matter where,  or how long after.  What matters is the moment.  If u both arn't in the mood don't do it.  Make sure u both want it, it is not forced, and it will be a kiss to remember.|`|QYZRRqI0aa	when ever you feel like kissing her silly. there is no definite time, everybody is different. if you guys are both into each other, then go for it cuz she probably wont mind if she likes you back & its obviously on your mind.|`|O7pGChVMaa	no need to wait,<br>  just do it when you feel like doing it,<br>  as long as you know the advantages and disadvantages of doing it.<br>  and know your limitations always... but dont just grab someone and kiss,, thats is very rude.:-)|`|xHZlWuJdaa	a' right man lemme tell u excatly, today is SUNDAY.....<br>  <br>  For ur kiss u have to wait 'till next thursday, 2:45 PM!!!!!!!!<br>  MY KISS with my girfriend is due today, 6:00 PM.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck bro|`|C4e9aKNmaa	depends... <br>  <br>  first date, a kiss on the cheek is cute.<br>  <br>  but after that like on the third date, feel free to make out. lol|`|GuunwBNhaa	U should wait till lik am mounth or 2,and dont push her on let her take the time that she needs to kno if she wants to do this|`|eC5dNQm9aa	When you feel its right and your comferable with that person to have their toung in your mouth. heads up dont do it in public!|`|HX5VPVDmaa	well I didn't go for the kiss he did but he waited until we said good night and then kissed me.

It is always an opening though. |`|AA10952386	Sorry, but if you two didn't talk, it wasn't meant to be.

0v7TAoJDaa	I would keep as far away from your dad as you can right now. Request a restraining order. Hitting your child is NOT acceptable, no matter what the case may be. If he hit you so hard as to make a mark, I would definitely go back to the police.|`|C9Z1CkR9aa	I am a father of a teenage daughter (14) and as most parents and teenage daughters do...we argue.  There have been numerous times where I have been so angry at my daughter, I too wanted to give her a good slap in the face, but I do not believe this is the solution to any problem.  I dont know the situation you were in or are in, but if this is a reoccurring thing then you should report it to your school (assuming you are a child) if this is an isolate situation it might be best to talk it over with your dad when the two of you are ready.  If your mom is in the picture, it may be a good idea to talk with her as well.  |`|AqzekroSaa	If you really want a proper answer, you should describe the incident in detail.<br>  What did you do? What did he say? What did you come back with? How did he hit you? Where did he hit you? Is this the first time? Was this a spanking? Are you in trouble for doing drugs? What are the circumstances?<br>  It's not right to hit a child, but my dad hit me once and it was very wrong. I busted three of his ribs, his nose, knocked out two of his teeth, and sprained his back when I attempted to break it. He never did hit me again. On a side note, I have lived on my own since I was 16. You really need to give more details because just saying your dad hit you is not enough.|`|yBDL24yOaa	Keep reporting it and tell staff at your school.  Don't stop telling people just because he got away with it this time.  Where is  your mother, and does she know about it?  If she don't, tell her and if she does report her too if she isn't helping you.  I'm only giving this advice to you if this a true case of abuse.  If you are just getting a harsh spanking because of your behavior then change those things to avoid hard punishment.  Falsely charging someone can ruin their lives forever when you are just mad at them for a moment.  Get the help if you are really in need.  Please get help.|`|8mCdRnvwaa	If the situation is abuse then talk to your chancellor at the school. (He does it because he think he is stronger)<br>  If you are a brat that need it to be taught a lesson... I would say change.|`|DW2Xdzyyaa	Tell your mother, alternatively kick the **** out of him while he sleeps.|`|fc3262575625685d841f1e50e707eae8aa	smuggle him 2 death DONT DO THAT lol CALL THE CHILD ABUSE HOTLINE IN YOUR STATE|`|w6MtjrMVaa	I don't know where you reside but I must say that in my opinion  you have an incompetent Police Dept. that should have brought charges of child battery against your father. I believe sometimes they don't like to get into family problems such as this. Next time go right to the Police Dept. and make a report if in fact it happens again.|`|MELLvdGkaa	that does not sound right at all, im sorry this is happening to  you stay away from him, dont make him mad, try to see if you can stay at a friends house or a different family member

He's a sexist.  Tell him that if you are going to open your marriage the one rule is that you get to go first!  <br>  <br>  But isn't it really the way with all of us that we can justify being "naughty" ourselves a whole lot easier than we can accept it in others?  |`|GVlzdZKsaa	You really found a jerk for a husband. |`|mlfVqvsEaa	you need to slap hima across his face<br>  4 me<br>  |`|Q1S1rB0qaa	if he still wants to sleep with other women why did he get married.he should just grow up. it is not fair what he is talking about but he should not even be thinking about it in the first place.I guess he is one of those people who think it is okay when done by a man but when a woman does it nail her to the cross.talk about double standards.|`|kvooEbUEaa	nope, not fair.  Unfortunately for a young horny guy... completely normal.  He wants to go messing around but he's too insecure, jealous or possessive (kind of all the same thing actually) to let you.  Not that I think either of you should do it, but if you did, it would have to be equal and agreed upon.  No double standards allowed!!! |`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	You asked another question just a couple min ago about other creepy stuff you husband did.  Yuk!  He is a waste of our planet's resources.  Just walk out on him, never speak with him again & file for divorce.  Unless you secretly want to see him f*cking random hoes on a regular basis.  You can stand there & watch, fetch them drinks.  Maybe he can quit his job, too, make you support him & his skanks.  You can do all their laundry & cook & clean for them too!  Or do you just love the drama & the STDs that come with it?|`|Wn0z6bWJaa	Too funny.  My husband said the same to me years ago when we got married.  Was he drunk?  Mine was.... that will lead to trouble.  And lots of it.  You guys are young.....i don't know how to aswer you.  You could do it TOGETHER..... my sister does and her relationship is ok, I tried once but I am WAY TOO JEALOUS.  And of course he won't "mind" having sex with someone else.... personally I stick to fantasy stuff.  Get  a porn, have him face the t.v., do everything she does....and there you go....he's with someone else...safely.  Good luck.|`|b6dbd566bb33d3d6287852bfdbc32eb4aa	Your husband sounds like he wants to sleep around with permission and that is the craziest thing you can do in a relationship because you two will never be the same.

krQiDGCHaa	I am the step mother to an 8 year old boy.  Before I married my husband, I was engaged to someone else who had 2 young daughters.  I broke off the engagement and cancelled the wedding.  This is going to be really long, but I have to tell you about 2 different scenarios and I think they will help you a lot.<br>  <br>  The first story is of my previous engagement.  His daughters lived with their mother, and they came to visit us every other weekend.  Our lives were FILLED with drama.  She would call our house multiple times a week to SCREAM at us.  One day she even called specifically for me and referred to my fiance as "HER HUSBAND."  She called me a "f***ing wh**e" etc etc.  This was our lives.  One time, she slapped me when we went to pick up the kids, right in front of the kids -- and I wasn't even talking to her, just sitting in the car!  She was constantly harassing us and it was horrible, our lives were miserable.  At first I blamed her, and then I started realizing that I should be blaming my fiance, which is why I broke off the engagement.  HE never stood up for us, HE allowed our lives to be run by his insane ex wife.  He didn't even take a sh*t without calling and checking with her first.  Well -- not literally, but you know what I mean. ;)  I realized I wasn't prepared to spend the rest of my life with a man who let another woman run our lives.  I left him.<br>  <br>  A few years later, I met my husband.  At first when I found he had a son, I almost ran the other way screaming because of everything I had dealt with in my prior relationship.  I took a deep breath and said "Well, we're just casually dating what's the big deal?"  We had agreed I wouldn't even meet his son until we became more serious so who cared really?  So, we dated.  Then, we got serious.  I met his son, and we got along great.  We move in together, and then all hell breaks loose.  The mother of his son got EXTREMELY territorial.  My step son lives with us, and always has.  I think what happened was it finally hit her that her son was going to have another mother in his life and that she didn't want to compete.  She gave a lot of attitude and was constantly trying to push my fiance and I apart.  She refused to talk to me AT ALL about ANYTHING, claiming "He's not your so back the f*ck off."  Finally, I told her I needed to talk to her one day when she was there to pick up my step son.  I walked outside with her, and said "Listen.. I just have a few things to say and if you still hate me after that, that's fine.  Joe and I are getting married, and we love each other very much.  I also love *****(my stepson) very much but I am not and WILL NEVER try to take your place.  You are his mother, and nothing can ever change that.  He's going to be living with us and I know that's probably hard on you.  I fully intend on being very involved in his life and activities, but I don't want you to think that means I'm trying to be his mom because I would never do that.  I respect you and your position, and I really think we should get along, or at least be civil for the sake of (my stepson.)"  She blew me off and left.<br>  <br>  Then, a few weeks later, I started noticing change.  She'd say "Hi" to me when she picked up or dropped off my stepson.  She started asking how I was doing, and then even started talking to ME if I answered the phone rather than asking for my husband (after we got married.)  Now, her and I get along great!!  We only talk once in awhile and only if it's about my step son, but she actually NEVER calls my husband anymore, lol.  I was sick the other day and she actually called to ask my husband how I was feeling.  She respects me as a parent to her son too, and she knows the 3 of us are a family.  I still would never try to take her place and she knows that, which is why I think she's able to respect me.<br>  <br>  If I have any advice for you it would be to sit down with your fiance and decide EVERYTHING before getting married.  For example, my husband and I decided that I would have equal say in ALL the decisions about my stepson, because he was going to be living with us and I was going to be his primary caregiver (I work at home so I see him more than anyone else, he isn't even in day care before and after school, and he spends all holidays from school with me at home.)  We also intend on having our own children, so we discuss and compromise on ALL matters involving my stepson, because we want to raise our children as close to indentically as possible in order for their lives to be fair.<br>  <br>  Find out how your fiance feels about all these decisions prior to saying your I Do's.  You don't want to be fighting over them later.  Also, make sure to be respectful to your step daughter's mother -- even if she isn't to you.  Be civil and kind, and your step daughter will always remember you as a wonderful woman.  <br>  <br>  I do love my step son like he's my own son, and I do treat him like he's my own son. :)  We tell each other that we love one another every night bef|`|GzL8X6vTaa	I am a single mom of a 3 year old a 7 year old I would NEVER date a man that had kids of his own I know double standard but those are my expectations.<br>  <br>  Anyway the guy that I call my hubby now has no kids because that is rule number one and he gets along with my kids just fine. We are a family since I have no baby daddy drama since their father i slong gone.<br>  <br>  I just think that every situation is different, it worked for me I hope that it works for you.|`|AA10799686	I was the single mom. I met my  husband and my daughter was 1 yr old. We now have been together for almost 8 years and he treats my daughter as his own. (biolog. dad never was in the picture) Introduces her as his and in the process to give her his last name. We are a very happy family now with 3 kids. |`|AA11534512	My husband and I were both married before with children from those relationships.  I knew his teenage daughter was going to be an issue with me, so we did not get married until she was over 18.  She lived with us less than 6 months and I had to kick her out.  I knew it would happen though.  Anyhow as for the other kids, life is paradise.|`|A3UaBkzRaa	I do not have any stepchildren, but I became a stepchild at the age of eight. I have some advice for you and it may be difficult. If you can, form a cordial relationship with the child's mother, and never speak ill of her in front of the child. Also, make sure you give the girl and her father a little bit of space when she comes over, if he does not have custody. You also may want to take up some alone time with her too, so you can bond as stepmother and stepdaughter, as she will be the sister to your children, should you and your fiance have any.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ffb42367736232c58e1232280031062aaa	I married a man that had 2 kids from a previous and to be totally honest, even though I cared for the kids, I could NOT handle their mother. She caused a LOT of turmoil in our relationship and even tried turning the kids against the "evil stepmom". The kids would tell me sometimes that I treated them more like a mom then their real mom (I had to wonder considering) and now that I am divorced from their dad, they no longer speak to me (I've tried). So obviously the relationship did not work out and part of it had to do with his kids and their mother... too much baby mama drama for me...|`|DcjhsWC7aa	I myself am engaged to a man who is not only 11 years older than me but he has an 11 year old daughter. <br>  <br>  His daughter and I get along smashingly and I've been mindful to make sure she's incorporated into every aspect of not only the wedding but any future plans that we have. <br>  <br>  I've told her how much I love her dad but I don't plan on taking him away from her(Very important). She doesn't have much of a relationship with her mom, mother ignores her and verbaly abuses her, and it wasn't until a few days ago that she started calling me mom and my mom grandma.|`|0bO65A0gaa	Married a single Mom 24 years ago and raised her daughter as my own. She was just a baby tho, and didn't even know I wasn't her real Father til she was 9 years old. Still love her as my own, always will.<br>  It was alot easier for me since she was so young, but I think that as long as you are willing to love them as your own, it will work out. With older children the main problem is going to be who disciplines.|`|AA10861118	Well my husband has 2 girls and I have 1 boy and 2 girl. I notice at first everything was good but once we moved in together it got hard for me to handle his girls and mt girls fighting all the time until one day I sat them down and I spoke to them together.Everyone had a chance to speak and the others had to listen. Everyone hear how they felt and everyone tried to get along together. Now after 5 year we are very happy my girls and his are very good friends. I love his girl like I love mine. If i buy for one I buy for all of them. Plus we have girls night out which is so much fun. My girls are 11 & 12 and his are 10 & 11. My son and him get along great. My son is 17.|`|o5Fk7D9Yaa	When I met my wife her kids are very young 5, 4, and 3. When we got married her ex started coming around more and the kids acted like little sh!t. We have a girl together. There are going to be dramas every now and again, but I know I love my wife enough to handle anything. Remember you have an important job as a step parent and it's more difficult than just a regular parent. If you're not up to it split now before it becomes an issue.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Dqg7JbP0aa	just raise the little girl as if she was your own no better no worse |`|gReMjWxoaa	I'm married to a man who has two kids from a previous relationship (7 & 5).  <br>  It has it's days, I'll say that for sure!  You'll have bigger drama as time goes on, but they're only occasional (at least in my family) and will get resolved and it's nothing you can't handle.  I THOUGHT I loved them like they were my own, until I had my own 2-1/2 months ago.  I still love them and don't show favoritism or anything, but there is definitely a bond that you have with your own flesh and blood that you don't have with someone else's kids.  The key is NEVER to show that you feel any differently toward any of the kids and NEVER tell your husband about it.  It's one of those things that you can just keep to yourself.<br>  The kids were young when I met them (2 & 4) and we all took to each other really well.  We clicked immediately and still do.  I love them so much!<br>  The biggest potential drama I can warn you about is to be aware that some occasions should be biological parents only.  It will be really hard, and you'll probably feel excluded, but trust me- in the end it's not worth the drama.  Things like parent teacher conferences, Dr. appointments, etc. should be dealt with between your fiance and his ex.  You should be more than welcome to attend things like school plays, sporting events, recitals, etc. but the bigger issues- let them handle them.  I learned this the hard way and finally after 2 years of fall outs with my husband's ex we laid it all out on the table and I explained that I wasn't trying to replace her in anyway and that it would be best if we could work TOGETHER from then on.  I love her kids, but I don't want to step on her toes either, ya know?  She is their mother, and I know that I wouldn't be thrilled about my son having a step mom, so I kind of understood where she was coming from.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	My wife and I met and married after being single moms and dads, and we are very happily married.  I can't say the new family has worked well.<br>  <br>  But that has more to do with my ex poisoning my kids' minds about me and about my wife than anything. There's been LOTS of drama, and my teens were very weirded out when I found someone new, and now, years later, they believe their mom's fantasy that I left them as well as her for another woman (I did neither) and neither of them much talks to me.<br>  <br>  My youngest daughter though, who was 8 when we divorced, has been fine except for minor drama when her mom tried to get her to not visit, or wanted her on "my" weekends for this or that occasion. I try to be flexible about that stuff but to make sure I see my kid a lot.<br>  <br>  My wife's daughter was a toddler when we got married and is just in kindergarten now, but lives 1000 miles away with her dad most of the time.  I don't know if we love these kids we really don't live with most of the time as our own, but they are obviously very fond of both of us, and with the young ones, we have great relationships and lots of fun together.  I think if we lived together, as I originally expected, we'd be fine except for the weirdness from my ex.|`|867a43fea0f7a3a51a958c423b653cc8aa	My true advise to you is if you love this man the love for this child will come. I married a man that had a eight year old daughter and there was ALOT of drama but if you want it to work out it will.She's seventeen now and lives with us things are ok .Just when your to give up things will settle down after a while. Good Luck!!

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...<br>  <br>  *How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much Love* ~God Bless~|`|yzVMzKrpaa	Well, I sort of have the same problem.  See if he watches you a lot, and if you start to talk about other guys, if he starts to get uncomfortable. |`|youF5LiIaa	For me, there's really no way to tell. But if someone really likes you, then they will probably say something to you for no reason like a 'Hey' or something, they might stare at you, try to talk to you in class, call you names sometimes...|`|3ykKSswMaa	make fun of you, be around you, stare at you....
COc5U2nJaa	I would find that cheating still. He should only masturbate to you and bout you.|`|CYjrHrmAaa	Um....that's kind of weird and creepy. Perhaps it has to do with some type of fantasy he has? Porn is one thing, local girls is a little different. <br>  I can understand that it can be just some fantasy thing for him, but if it was my boyfriend (and I'm totally fine with him watching porn and we even watch porn together), I'd tell him to NEVER to that again. It's kind of creepy.|`|ESJqOHX6aa	This is a bit sick , but hardly surprising when it comes to men .To be honest all men are a little perv and it probably means nothing more than a quick thrill .certainly does not mean he thinks any less of you , or does not fancy you.Men are just weird in that way , i think they masturbate a lot more than we think , no matter how much sex they get , or how goodooking their partners are. The only thing that would worry me is that it is local girls you say , which is not a good thing really , as he may bump into these girls at some point . If he told you openly about it i would say that it proves its jjust a bit of fun for him. Maybe tell him to get a few porno mags or something instead of the local girl thing ...|`|54CXG9qxaa	I think a lot of guys do it.  I really don't like porn, but it seems like something common.  I can understand why a girl might think it's creepy.  But abnormal?  Not as much.|`|AA10561878	I think that your made up of different type of stuff things,bf has issues.the sugar and spice and everything nice things must get his blood to boiling.|`|4X4H1Vszaa	It means you should get a new boyfriend.
i8Ox5xmAaa	that is a hard one, if he is paying child support, and you tell him you want a baby, you know what he is going to think...just be careful, you might want to fix him something special to eat first, and let him know you will not ever leave him, and so on.  well, its a start, you can go on from there :)|`|zka26204aa	Why don't you try seeing if you can make the marriage commitment, before you make the biggest commitment you will ever make in your life--having a child!!  It is unfair to think that you can make a commitment to having a child, without even being able to commit to his father first.|`|KHVEK3aRaa	Just tell him you're ready to have a baby. Say you're ready to be a mommy and the only person you want to create a child with is him. Make it all romantic and sappy.<br>  <br>  <br>  I do suggest you get married first, though. Not that there isn't anything wrong with having children while not being married, but it will provide the child with a greater sense of stability, since "everyone else" will have married parents.|`|mflxWjuNaa	why dont you just tell him staright out or write a post it note and stick it in the bathroom mirror?|`|AA10561878	Don't do it.|`|X8CPWapxaa	well why dont you just ask him cos he did say let him know|`|pJ97XZLTaa	just tell him! honestly from what i have found younger parents relate to their children so much better and have a better relationship with them so just pop the question one day soon and do it =D . my best friends parents where about 40ish when they had her she now my age 22* and shes worried about their retirement already! i know it sounds bad but do it asap xD|`|DiySCE04aa	Just tell him " I think its time that we took r relation ship forward and if its 2 much don't worry but i wanna have a baby". |`|RokQeGlmaa	Get married and then you will have right to bear his baby inside you.<br>  |`|vMG0CHmgaa	just walk up, whip down his pants, give him head, stick it in, and say you better get it on the 1st try|`|cI6xkf3Taa	just drop a few hints<br>  next time in bed tell him "hon, why not skip the condom this time?"|`|gVldaWnCaa	yikes 42 year old wll anyway just ask him whats gonna happen if he says no|`|AOOIMK4Zaa	Get married...

aH7hx4GTaa	Was it Sarah Palin?|`|AA10561878	Get a grip, your free at last.|`|TvUhAPBSaa	Honey, it's over. If you see him again say something like "well it was nice getting to know you for the last 5 years" and then go take care of yourself. Looking good is the best revenge. Get a nice manicure, maybe a haircut, go do your makeup at a salon. Join a gym. Do something to make yourself feel better.|`|164703cf82446039053732c1bd256cc4aa	You need to let him go.  Do you want to be in a relationship with someone who treated you so badly and is admittedly a liar?  You can save yourself a lot of heartache and frustration if you just cut your loses now.  If it doesn't work out with her he'll be back and you can choose to take him or not.  Don't get into a fight over a man, there is no winning.|`|499962253e6bc68e417a003cd9129b24aa	If he's such a great guy (and from your description of him, I'm having some doubts~) then he'll have to snap out of it soon, and realize what a big mistake he's made. I advise you to make him work hard to win you back!!<br>  <br>  If he doesn't... well, then he probably deserves the dysfunctional"redneck" lady. Maybe he's having a mid-life crisis??|`|UAieFmXlaa	The redneck woman has cast a spell on your boyfriend. All she needs to do is to keep him coming over to see her and the spell will grow stronger. When she has sex with him, it will lock him to her for a very very long time. You have to break the spell or do a counter spell. Go to a Church nearby where you live and get some holy water. Preferably take at least 1 bottle of holy water from the Church. Next, invite your boyfriend over for dinner at your place. Mentioned to him that you want to cook something nice for him ( do not mentioned that you are having him over for old times sake, just mentioned that you thought of cooking for him ). Wear something that he likes to see you in or something simple that he has bought for you. During the dinner give him to drink the holy water from the Church ( do not tell him it is holy water that he is drinking and do not mix the holy water with other drinks ). After several glasses ( usually after the 2 glasses the effects will come in ), he will start to have a clearer mind and see things clearly. Most importantly when he is with you at your house having that dinner, make sure nothing the redneck women has given him is with him when he is having the dinner with you. Once the effects of the holy water starts kicking in, he will start to realize that he still loves you and that he has made a mistake by leaving you. Important, during the evening do not be pushy and needy towards him, just talks things smoothly and let things fall in place. Important also to have this dinner over a Friday and a day off so that if something does click, both of you can spend the following day together and enjoy each others company. Good luck and be careful. I have a feeling there is more to this redneck women than what meets the common human eye.
mAAJcAwsaa	Their just not the right ones for you. You might still have feelings for your ex, and no other guys seem to meet up with his expectations. Or if the previous guy treated you badly you might be trying to find a guy that doesn't have the same traits as him, But just keep going out their and try. You never know were your true love is at. He might be right around the corner. So don't give up. I hope it works out for you. |`|PcGvS4Xuaa	Well the closeness of the picture is making your nose look a bit bigger than it really is, so it isn't an ideal example. Really, I think your nose is adorable. Far cuter than mine, and I'd still never want to change my nose. Mine is kind of pointy and rather sizable... but not cute. Don't change a thing.|`|AA11066768	Perhaps the "right" person just hasn't come along yet. I also think because you were in a relationship you are wiser and you know what you want in a partner and especially what you don't want in a partner. so it is probably a combination of all those things. Keep searching there is someone for everyone! :) |`|SCL1Q1eLaa	I thought that way for awhile. also none of my relationships lasted either but like i did you have to stay positive and even the guys that you show a little interest in rather than full interest like you'd hope date them too because you might be surprised and when you least expect it that right guy will come across and show interest in you. you'll know when this happens believe me. Just be optimistic and be a little less picky because in doing all this if it is karma you believe in, he'll come too you.|`|aIgNU5PUaa	I think you are suffering from a symptom that I call, looking too hard.  It happened to me and my best friend too.  <br>  <br>  When you are looking for a relationship, it doesn't always pan out because you grab the first reasonable thing that comes along and when you get to know them, they are not Mr. right.<br>  <br>  As soon as you slow down and stop thinking about it, fate just puts the right guy in your lap.  <br>  <br>  Spend some time with the girls, take up a hobby, get into some "me" time and the right guy will find you.|`|6d9139f69ec93ecf07a5ca2dd191da0eaa	maybe karma, maybe the one hasn't appeared yet, you could be picky, but that's not bad, I think you should keep looking, you are gonna find someone eventually, besides a 2 year relationship it's quite a long time, so try to relax and don't force things.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Qjn4B3CHaa	Oh wow, 10 points for Best Answer? How did you arrange that?<br>  <br>  That's pretty cool. Thanks for that rare and unique offer...<br>  <br>  Now I really will work extra hard to come up with a really great answer for your special offer of 10 points...<br>  <br>  hmmm....|`|1gpjT4K7aa	Perhaps you go into a new relationship with high expectations and that's why you often find yourself disappointed.  I'm not saying lower your standards....but, go in it with an open mind.  Give him a chance first, a healthy relationship is all about compromise. Pick what qualities are very important to you and weed out the things that you can tolerate.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to like the fact that he burps or farts when he's at home with you....but it can be something you can overlook if he's a great guy overall.<br>  <br>  It's all about picking and choosing your battles.  For myself, I know I'm not perfect..so I'm not looking for perfection in a partner. I'm looking for someone who can accept me for me, me without my makeup and still think I'm pretty and I would reciprocate the same.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say it: but 'lovey dovey' movie romance does not exist anymore. <br>  <br>  Bottom Line is: it's not about Karma.  It's about how you should give everyone a fair chance and be open minded.....just like you would want some guy that you happen to be interested in, to give you a chance.<br>  <br>  ~Maybe you'll find Love soon.  |`|6f53c487acfbce39c05ad9579204db6aaa	First of all dont patronize yoursel by thinking some magical force like karma has control of your life.   Well, you have nailed it down there, thinking that you are being picky, it is true! I think you should feel that you were the reason why past reltnshps have been sour.  You need to do a self check from the start of your very first relationship up until now.<br>  ask yourself, who wanted to seperated, You might also want to see if you yourself may have some low self esteem. it can reak havoc on a person who is  trying to have a steady going realtionship! goo dluck!|`|5e8eded290e38b80329a8ef88d005cbbaa	I dont think karma is happening at all.  i just think that you should just wait for a guy to approach you instaed of you approaching them . Try playing hard-to-get and see if that same person is still tryin to get with you then thats how you know the realationship will last becuz no one would waste thier time trying to talk to someone and the dump that person after all that hard work they did to try to talk to you.<br>  |`|MyZLNjjSaa	Its okay for women to be picky, because you don't just want to give your heart to the first guy who hits on you, but like you said..your not gonna find someone "perfect". Just be patient...I know you hate to hear it but good things come to those who wait. :) Maybe the relationships that didnt last..didnt last cause maybe you went into them too fast and you missed having a guy. I dont know..but i do know how you feel..cause the SAME thing is happening to me. haha Next guy you find though.. just take it really slow and see how it goes. Good luck! :)|`|JzaCPIvpaa	Hmm... Being picky actually ensures top quality relationships, so it's not bad to be picky.... Just make sure that when you get a guy you don't tell him all the things he does wrong and try to change him. Accept him for who he is, even if he doesn't meet all of your "Ideal Characteristics".<br>  <br>  Just take it easy. Don't be desperate. Desperation only leads to more heartbreak.<br>  <br>  Relax, take it easy - Mika|`|qFiWefHUaa	You probibly got used to how he treeted you so then you set expectation to all other guys. You want to be treated like a princess, every girl does.  Just think about what you want and go from there. Only look for guys that have those "qualifacations"|`|0G1fOjpWaa	You want who you cant have, imo.|`|AA11710143	You should make your mind to love someone from your heart. If you love someone deep from your soul you would find everything fine.|`|Atny2paFaa	Karma is whats going on. What goes around comes around.
avh3kir8aa	You might have the most honest boyfriend in history and you blew it. Maybe he was trying to be open and honest with you and you should've just said thank you for telling me and I appreciate your honesty. Sometimes you can like someone but have no intention of doing anything with them, especially if you're in a relationship with someone you love. Don't be so hard on him  - he sounds like he's really trying to be a good guy.|`|u0gqNvSnaa	I'm going to go against the grain and say yes, he still loves you.<br>  <br>  I believe that by telling you he liked another girl, he was just trying to be honest with you. I'll admit to liking someone else while I had a boyfriend, and I told him. I didn't like to keep anything from him, and in my opinion, honesty is the best policy. Please think it over carefully, and don't do anything rash.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|6FChhRXsaa	nobody can help liking some one .. i have had crushes and liked other people while being in a relationship its natural. he must be a very honest person who feel comfortable telling you the truth..you should be more understand so he feels he can always tell you anything.just talk to him.... |`|5d8sO58Raa	Often, people can love someone but develop a liking for someone else at the same time. It is confusing, and hurtful for the partner. You have to ask him if he is in love with you. Take it from there. I would hate to be second best to some other girl.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|iIC1u0iwaa	He obviously doesn't want to be with you. If he likes someone else, he obviously doesn't like you that much, and he most certainly does not love you. You're being played.|`|iBe5z6P1aa	I agree with u in that he obviously really wants 2 date the other girl more than you.  hes taking it slowly and trying 2 easily break your relationship up...|`|gOVP7T5vaa	if he loves u then he wont be interested in another girl.. i think he is using u and he probably doesnt want to start all over with the new girl so he is just spending time with u.... dump him before he dumps u!|`|GNMkBwUCaa	I guess yeah hes using you man I hate it when people use you it feels like ur a joke........|`|uIDY2LVAaa	it means you should move on. he has.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	he doesn't really care hes a user|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I think he does like you, but he likes her more. He probably feels kinda guilty about it because he was brave enough to admit it to you, which is better than cheating. I would just end the relationship because I don't think he wants to commit to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	He's trying to be nice. He doesn't love you. He don't even like you. He wants to have his cake and eat it. He wants you both, but probably prefers you.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't think you're going to take our advice because you seem to be falling for his game. Saying he loves you and he's going to miss you is all B.S. to get what he wants. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Bmvap7yIaa	He does not know what he wants. He is searching for something, something that lacksin your relationship. Maybe, he wants but don't know he already has. He will probably regret breaking up with you. Wait and see.<br>  |`|wFWGrD3oaa	He likes her better but he feels guilty cause he's hurting you. he's a good guy.|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	He is trying to let you down easy.
511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	Depends on the state where you live, you will need to contact your local county courthouse where you live and ask what are their stipulations on divorcing a party that cannot be located. |`|GVlzdZKsaa	Get an a attorney.|`|3b8JqVCdaa	Okay my husband is from Oklahoma and he had the same problem as you.Last he knew hjis ex was in NC, but he told the lawyer the last place he knew where she was was in Oklahoma and gave the old address they had as an address for her, then his lawyer placed an add in the paper to give 30 days for her to respond,when she didn't respond, the divorce was final in a couple of months! And he says it was well worth it!|`|IHce6jz1aa	You need to get a lawyer.  You will be able to get a divorce on the means of abandonment or absenteeism.<br>  <br>  Def need legal advice though.  Don't waste any time asking for advice from anyone but a lawyer.|`|AA11460234	Leave it to the legal pimp you hire to file the papers. He or she will place an announcement in local papers in NY and that will cover the action.<br>  <br>  That's why you pay these vermin. To represent your best interests.|`|1O7GcSe8aa	You probably should of done that a long time ago.|`|DIKHDbQUaa	You don't need to locate him.  Go to a lawyer and say, my husband walked out on me X amount of years ago.  He never provided me a new address, phone number or any way to contact him.  Tell him you have reason to believe that he moved to the New England/ New York area and then provide his social security number.  You can find that on any birth records, or things along the line of that.  Give the lawyers his full birth name, SSN, Birth date and the rest will be up to him.  What will happen is his Social will be ran in the Police Database and they will locate him.  They will look for death records and all kinds of stuff.  Once you file, they will send the paperwork to him.  Your husband has 30 days to respond or contest or the divorce is automatically granted to your specifications.  Sad I know about this huh?  I went through it too.  Good luck and get started now.|`|48FBAKofaa	He doesn't have to be present for you to get a divorce.  Just file the papers.  Tell the lawyer that you have not had contact with him since the separation.  You can run legal adds in the newspaper and if he doesn't respond within so much time the judge will grant your divorce.  Are you sure he hasn't filed for a divorce using your absence to get it?  Check first.  You could use the internet to check as a matter of public record in the state of New York.|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Go to the local court house, Domestic Relations.  The will direct you.  Also use Zabasearch to find him.  It is a great tool.  You should be able to find him there.  I don't think it is necessary to find him though, and you can probably just file and have your divorce in no time.  The courthouse will tell you what steps to take.  You may not need an attorney at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|47351b9ae8413f8db8f740d21dce4bbeaa	I am not sure, but I believe you can still file for divorce. If they can't get a hold of him after X amount of time, the marriage will be annulled. Your best bet would be to consult a lawyer as soon as possible to find out what all of your options are. Good Luck!|`|T718vo8uaa	You must still have some contact with him?<br>  File for a divorce and let the state hunt him down, haha.|`|AA10561878	any Judge will grant your divorce do to desertion.|`|HOAQtDDzaa	Call an attorney, you are wasting your time asking us.|`|pbeXkX0raa	you'll have to get a lawyer, but there is a way to divorce in absenteeism|`|eqIaxUrgaa	I believe that if you file the divorce and the court date is publised in the paper and he does not show, the judge will more than likely rule in your favor. You need a lawyer (no matter what)|`|E1xt2rlnaa	hire a private investigator to find him. my mother did that to get a divorce from her ex. it took a while, but eventually he was found and the papers were sent to him and he signed.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|e7l2d6h1aa	go around the temple of your heart and say three times I divorce your sorry ***+ and that is it. you were never married to that dirty piece of sh+ anyway thank God|`|p4mb4Aqsaa	you can find him for free here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zabasearch.com/</a>
cBl5w3n2aa	Ok.. Amy, you say that you and your husband have made it through several deployments and he's a good guy, correct? So, I don't feel you should be worried, at least based on the bit of information I have. I can understand your hurt and even agree that you're  justly hurt. I think you should tell him to please come clean with the real story, and tell him you forgive him for it and that it hurts you to know he would want to look at anothr man's wife and I would be willing to bet it would hurt him if other men were looking at you.  It's probably  just a temporary lapse in judgement. He's dealing with a lot of pressure right now and missing you. Let's face it, we're men and we are not as smart as our counterparts, and even less smart when around other men who are worked up over a girl and we're not getting any ourselves.  After the two of you talk it out, do somethng sexy for him...maybe some hot steamy phone sex, that way it  can't be shared with anyone else. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rObfIdvLaa	It's not very sensitive, for sure, but it's the sort of stupid stuff us guys do when were together. You have a right to be pissed at him IMO, but I wouldn't be overly worried; he probably has no interest in her even! Tell him you're not happy for sure, but try and maintain the moral high ground and make him realise what a cool wife he has!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Look, hon: forgive it this once.  We guys do stupid things - sometimes, we do profoundly stupid things - while meaning no harm.  But you're entirely within your rights to warn him: "This better be the last time, buster!"|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I personally think your over reacting and I agree your husband did a childish thing.  But honey he is a man, and it does not matter how old we get, we do stupid crap every once in a while.  I applaud you and your husband for the service to our country.  Tell your husband that you think what he did was stupid, but you love him and trust him.  Good luck.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	It seems to me like all of these military people have some pretty screwed up relationship problems.  <br>  <br>  I don't see how a naked picture of someones wife is a joke, (unless she was like 400 pounds or something)  It all seems insane.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11496842	Start taking bets and place your money on Bob's wife. She's on the war path now. |`|yB0NoUmtaa	It wasn't that interesting the first time round and it's not that interesting now.|`|AA11097612	Why didn't he tell you????  You have got to be kidding, right?  Look at the rant you just wrote.  There is no mystery as to why he didn't tell you.  He was wanting to avoid the hell you are putting him through now.<br>  <br>  I understand why you would be upset by him having naked pictures of another woman on his phone but it seems like you were looking for some reason to be mad at him.  You're snooping in his phone and then you approach the woman in the picture hoping to get her to be mad at your husband too.  How frustrated you must have been when that didn't happen.<br>  <br>  If you don't let this go and stop trying to find a fault in your husband you will be on this forum with another question:  "My husband wants a divorce.  What do I do?" |`|dN3Ik6fPaa	It was stupid. And the fact that the wife felt flattered ... well that just speaks volumes about her. He should be apologizing and not brushing it off. I'd be pi$$ed off too. What man sees pics of some other guys wife and then forwards them willy nilly to some other guy without permission? A shitty one, that's who. |`|3OFxasXHaa	hell, if i accidentally got naked pics of a buddies wife, you're damn rights i'd fire them off to the other buddies as a prank... those suckers would be on the internet.... and then a link emailed to him.<br>  <br>  you have a normal husband, what do you want? a boring ol accountant?|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Who says you have to do anything?  If you do not approve of such, tell your husband.  Other than that, leave it alone.|`|AA10561878	can you say scum bags.|`|lPQu5Uzpaa	Woop his ***, are you stupid? He was using that to wack it, duh?   |`|IF95rI2aaa	Because he is a man,, men do crazy things like that with no meaning behind it... let it go. and if the wife dont care you shouldnt...|`|8uloEyDjaa	you are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy over reacting, so he has a pic of a naked lady big deal the fact that she is flattered ... if i had 3 women sharin pics of me on their phones id be flattered too. They think she is good lookin no crime in that. And she is comfortable enough to have naked pics of herself so good for her. YOU are acting like yoru husband tookt he pics himself. There is nothing wrong with what is goin on here and the fact that you are blowing it out of proportion is silly at best. Give it a rest and let it go, its harmless.|`|CrcNh7FKaa	Well we know that she is an attention whore. A decent woman would be terribly embarrassed if those pictures were meant for her husband alone.<br>  And men do things like that with no underlying meaning. Was it wrong and irresponsible because he never regarded the way it would make you feel? Yes. <br>  If he loves you like it sounds like he does, you should be able to explain those feelings to him...and a good man will apologize and he'll think twice before being so careless with your feelings again. I would seriously talk to him and let him know your exact thoughts...and let him know things like that make you question your faith in him. A good man will be remorseful.<br>  I don't think that he's done anything really wrong besides joking about this other man's wife. He wouldn't want someone passing pics of you around like that, I'm sure. <br>  Men don't always think these things through. Just talk to him.
1IbwqNBOaa	it depends. Is it casual like doing it in spare time every once in a while. or does he play them obsessively. I would get him a hobby but it depends on your situation. It also depends on the game |`|ECe1rgsdaa	yes, most still play them, my fiance never stops! and he is 23|`|757c91a5e3a9215007b5dd0c6436e097aa	He is completely normal, as long he is not sitting on the couch all day everyday playing it, then it is not a problem..

Just look at it like this, it's a hobby a person enjoys and just like most hobbies, you won't grow out of it.|`|tHDkxCy3aa	well think of it as if you're watching a film or listening to music actually video games combine them+interaction if you think that is immature then playing video games is immature meaning everyone has his interests as long as it doesn't affect your relationship together + it's actually a way to get real life out of mind *temporarily* and live in another more perfect world where you can accomplish things used instead of smoking or even drugs. try final fantasy X |`|bq8qiom5aa	Oh yes... they'll never grow up. A coworker of mine just got married this summer and her husband LOVES video games- she got him a new system! And he is 26.

NXKQPcPIaa	If you are having sex with him, stop! It will kill whatever changes and chances you want. Okay, you want this guy? Tell him that you're feeling better about  taking the relationship down a notch. Give him what he doesn't expect. Fake it till you make it! Even tho he has said that he wants to be friends, he will be disappointed when he hears that you're okay with it. because you've taken him off that pedestal of attention he has garnered. Of course he'll ACT like it is cool,but ...he'll feel a little sad. You need to tell him that you've been feeling good about yourself and that you know that if you were to focus on him it would keep you from meeting the person that was meant for you and that will truly love you. (He'll be jealous of that statement) No guy wants to think of another guy getting his girl and being able to give to her what he couldn't. Do not give in sexually or in any other way. Let him stew in what you have told him. Then play the part. Give him the distance and don't put him in the hotseat talking about "LOVE"....he'll run. Time heals. God has someone for everyone, and every second you spend with a guy who doesn't love you....is one second lost of meeting the guy who will! Good Luck!   |`|zFQi5U5Naa	I know it really sucks to be in love with someone and they only see u as a friend, try liking someone and they have a girlfriend. The best you can do is try to move on if you keep being attached to this one guy you might be missing out on meeting someone really special|`|zYgYJsCqaa	I think that you have to respect his wish to only be friends. But maybe you should cut off all ties with him. You need to move on and find other activities to keep your mind occupied. <br>  <br>  You can't force someone to love you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck |`|gosxJiOZaa	There's not much you can do about this one. I am in a similar situation right now so I know how crap it is. I have found that talking about it makes it go away a little faster because you begin to understand why you fell for him in the first place. Amazingly the love feeling will fade eventually and you guys can get to being friends again. |`|zkhnpdrRaa	Tell yourself. You have to get over it because you cant keep hurting all the time

DHgrgnUUaa	I think it is a sin to have sex without the possibility of procreation.  In other words safe sex.  Thats where the marriage thing gets misinterpreted.  If you are trying to procreate, the bible believes you should be married to one another, and that would be the only reason to have sex, procreation.  Something like that.  But hey, sins of this nature are easily forgiven, so I wouldn't stress over it.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	If you're going to live your life according to strict bible rules, that's up to you.

But I don't pretend to live by the Bible either.  I just try to be a decent person.<br>  If you're as well-versed in things biblical as you sound, and you have doubts that premarital sex is alright in God's eyes, then you should know that you can't pull the wool over those same eyes. <br>  One thing's for sure - if premarital sex does piss God off, saying you got permission from Yahoo!Answers is not going to matter to Him in the least.    |`|YgDh2UAbaa	if u will get married w/ that person then it should be fine<br>  but i not %100 sure|`|pdXZMXWtaa	I guess i sinned.<br>  and if your saved by the lord,<br>  and you ask for forgiveness you won't go to hell.<br>  When someone makes mistakes in life, such as sins,<br>  Do you really think god is gonna damn you to hell?<br>  i dont think so,<br>  believe what you want, but thats what i believe.<br>  you can sin your whole life, and except god on your deathbed,<br>  and go to heaven.|`|arzZKyD0aa	Yes!

Many ppl were unable to read at this time priest would interpret the bible for them.  This is when sex before marriage became a sin.  Two reasons:<br>  <br>  1.  The priests, who were able to read, read about the Roman society and it's extravagances.  The Holy Roman Empire (keyword is Roman) felt that b/c of Rome's slackness on sexual promiscuity they believe that that help to contribute to the Fall of Rome...and put them where they were today...in the Dark Ages.<br>  <br>  2.  it also became a sin out of necessity.  Women had two options in life for survival...either they could sell their bodies or they could get married.  If a women became pregnant before she was married....the likeliness of her ever getting married was slimmed considerable and so her only other option would be to become a whore.  And during the Dark/Middle Ages whores were not treated well at all...unlike in the times of the Bible and up until the fall of Rome.  Being a prostitute was actually a really good profession and most cultures back then didn't have a problem with "ladies of the night".  And latching yourself a King, such as David, was extremely lucrative..<br>  <br>  I have found that the ppl in the Bible were more tolerant of human nature than we are even today.  The also realized that not every women would make a good wife and mother...some women are too independant.  <br>  <br>  Anyway....sex before marriage is not sin....it's something that mother's, farther's and the church came up with to protect their daughters virtues so she could have good placement and choices of families to marry into.  Remember...their were sexual deseases back then and they thought that women were more of a carrier than men...b/c some STD's don't even show up on men...but they do on women.  So when a man goes to marry a women (especially back in the day) men were marring for breeding purposes.  A women had to be healthy...if she had an STD...forget about she was never getting married.  Also, this was a safe way for men to be sure that weren't raising another man's baby.  |`|S6qKxGKMaa	it's society and convention more than anything religious. a lot of religions try to impose guidelines on their followers in addition to what it mentioned in the bible expressly<br>  <br>  personally, i do not view premarital sex as a sin IF the two people really care for one another. i do not think sex as a purely physical pleasure, is quite right. it strikes me as a perversion of a beautiful act of love.<br>  BUT that's just my own opinion, i would not ever presume to condemn anyone|`|Dweu8ZJsaa	Coveting covers many sins that are not specifically listed.  Coveting is wanting anything I do not have the right to have.  For example, I want my neighbor's car.  Wanting a car llike his car is ok.  Wanting his car is wrong because it does not belong to me.  Lust and premarital sex are wrong because they involve possessing or forming a union with someone I do not possess.  A Christian can only possess their spouse.  Each spouses' body belongs to the other partner.  Each must submit to the other.|`|xw2JQrChaa	it is a sin.<br>  <br>  you are only to have sex with the one you make a vow to hold forever, the one you marry. <br>  <br>  you are expected to save yourself for that person.

Sounds like you've really looked into it, and if you feel okay with what you've found, then it is not a sin.|`|aSqYoBNQaa	Yes.

The bible speaks aginist that so I wouldn't do that it may increase you chances of going to hell|`|zvF6Nhfbaa	You are right, the bible is unclear about this.  It really depends on how you interpret this.  Different parts of the bible say different things on what has been done or what can be done in the rights of man.  To me, it could be a sin only if you had sex with someone of another relationship status.  In other words i think it is a sin for someone to have sex if that person you are having sex with is in a relationship with another person.  I have previously in the past month had sex 2 times, and the first time i had sex.  Honestly if you feel its a sin then you should pray about it or at least something about it.|`|hXLD0cOuaa	i say that david did sin and sin outside of marriage is a sin...mortal sin. now back when david was king...men..esp kings...were permitted to have numerous wives so having more than one wife was not seen as uncommon. but i suggest instead of putting this question up on Yahoo Answers, go to a Catholic Church and talk to a priest, because they will most likely have the most knowledge of this topic and can tell you for sure weither it is a sin or not. now i am Catholic and believe it is a sin to have sex outside of marriage and with someone else other than your spouse...but im no priest so i suggest you go to a priest and talk about this and ask him. trust me...dont be shy because that what preists are there for...to lead you down the right path in life.|`|x2ykq6ePaa	there will be Extreme answers coming from both side's of the spectrum on this one!<br>  my answer is that, you need to do what you Truly feel is right. think pray/meditate on this, spend time really going over what you believe is correct and right in your eyes, and when you have done all this, make your choice, and remember you need to live with the consequences good or bad!|`|9XDQdQotaa	Pretty much everything is a sin if it's not in His word.|`|33oaWdNPaa	well i didn't think so to begin with, but now i'm even more confidant that it isn't a sin thank you :D.|`|nCnXMFMTaa	i choose to wait :]<br>  but people do say the bible says that, <br>  but i think you're more right. |`|HLoQL8Jtaa	I really dont know.

It's another example of how God hates you and doesn't want you to be happy.  I'm pretty sure Jesus doesn't give a **** if you lose your V card before marriage.  This is the only difference: you wait to have sex until you're married.  That's awesome.  Guess what happens on your wedding night?  Neither of you knows what the hell you're doing and then you have a negative view of sex afterwards due to your lack of experience.  Then you grow older and become a big prude like every other Christian/Catholic/What have you.  The end.|`|QkXUwt3Baa	the bible is greatly debated and i totally agree with what you are saying.  the bible is mainly conveyed to us through the church.  although we may read the words on the page, it is the church who dictates how we should interpret those words.  I know this is going to sound blunt but did jesus not become very good friends with mary who was not on the most virtuous side of life.  anyways, to answer your question, i do not think it is a sin.  each creature on this planet is different, in how we see and feel things.  god gave us our 5 senses, and emotion, and i think we ought to use them.  most people enjoy sex and i don't think that we must agree to spend the rest of our lives together to  enjoy this pleasure.  <br>  p.s. in the case of common-law marraige, does that mean the couple involved have been committing sin.  i do not believe that god will condemn all those who have had sex outwith marriage.|`|WqrX35zSaa	The Bible was written thousands of years ago when premarital sex was taboo. But the morals of people have changed drastically since then. Gays can get married, blacks arent slaves, women have equal rights as men, shall I go on? Premarital sex was a sin in the Bible times but nowadays it is just fine. It all depends on your personal morals, back in Bible times it was praised if one was a virgin. Back then the 40-year old virgin would have been honored and revered, but nowadays its the opposite, lol. Also when the Bible was written the age gap between puberty and marriage was only 1 or 2 years at most. But people dont get married at 15 and 16 these days but they are still having sex. People have had sex in their teen years for centuries, the only thing that changed is the marriage age NOT the sex age.<br>  <br>  Go with what feels right and develop your own morals. But I do not believe that premarital sex is a sin and if it is then the general population (a good 75-80%) are all going to hell. I dont think that God would punish someone for something as trivial as premarital sex. And as long as you do it out of love and use protection then it doesnt matter if you are married or not.|`|X1c66rYjaa	As usual life is what you make of it, I dont think its a sin.One meaning of the word sin is "To miss the mark" now thats a bit too airy fairy and ambiguous for me, but I take it to mean something along the lines of (frinstance) Lets say you wanted to quit smoking, but had a sneaky one after work...well you missed the mark you had set for yourself, (you sinned).<br>  A lot of the bibles teaching , warnings and do and donts are written there to help humans avoid pain, anger, jealousy, spite, greed, early death, murderous intent etc etc.<br>  Frinstance. <br>  Adultery often leads to jealousy, rage, anger, murder and all the other follow on emotions and mental states and painful situations that go with it.  Gluttony leads to obesity and hardening of the arteries and blood vessels, and eventually early death. Envy sometimes leads to other negative actions etc etc.....there is a lot of wisdom in the bible but only if youre mature enough to understand it. As for pre marital sex, why not? All things in moderation is a pretty good rule of thumb here.|`|cmDuVuQPaa	yes it is a sin .. it does nt have to be in the ten commandments to be a sin... theres a lot of stuff in the bible that is a sin but he didnt put it under the 10 commandments.... but if u go on to read the rest of the bible it say  something about him saying in the previous chapters nt to have sex i no I've read it..... just because god's "greatest leader" king david  did it dnt mean its nt a sin... Like the devil was gods right hand man and he ...went to hell and took half of the angels with him and they went with him  probably thinking oh hes gods right hand man he must be doing right.. and left with him and went to hell.. so u cnt fallow ppl ...kay|`|oli6MD6paa	Yes it is a sin, in most christian eyes. <br>  But then again, so is masturbating. <br>  Who cares? The bible was written long ago when we didn't know scientific answers to things, and also to keep us from chaos. It served its purpose and now there is a new age coming. <br>  We dont need myths with silly ideals of right & wrong to keep us whole anymore. <br>  <br>  To me, a sin is something that harms someone else. <br>  If no harm is done, then tell me why place these abstract ideals on people? If a couple love eachother, & are completely commited & mature, & do things as safely, then I say **** away. <br>  <br>  I think we all forget that the dangers of sex are just as present for married couples as they are for those who aren't. You can still catch diseases, have unwanted pregnancies, and still be childish enough to not protect yourself (whether it be with pills or latex).<br>  <br>  The thing about the bible is that its all so vague, <br>  that each and every so called christian just pick out what they like to believe in, and what they don't understand, they just change the meaning to suit their own comfort level.  |`|tlSyT7Wraa	I read somewhere that the actual "act" of sex...makes 2 into 1 in Gods eyes, and theirfore they are married in Gods eyes.  And God says thou shalt not commit adultery.....So in turn, It means, that you should only have sex with one person!<br>  Im not so sure I believe in anything. I just read these things. and it kind of makes sense in some ways. Like, the act of sex unites 2 people. Rather than a signing of a marriage document...Marriage probably wasnt such a huge deal back then as it is now... We tend to make things more difficult than need be....Who really knows though?|`|u9kEjOwuaa	YES!!!! Premarital sex is a sin. God created sex for marriage. It is to be enjoyed by a married man and woman. The Bible is very clear on this matter, in Hebrews 13:4 is says "Marriage must be respected by all, and the marriage bed kept undefiled, because God will judge immoral people and adulterers." That is plain as day saying no sex before marriage. Also if you look in 1 Corinthians 6:15-20 it explains how our bodies are sanctuaries of the Holy Spirit. We were bought for a price, which was Christ's death on the cross, therefore we are to glorify God in our bodies. Which means no sex before marriage. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't believe that it is a sin, why would you want to have sex before marriage anyway? Because then you haven't saved yourself for your husband. <br>  <br>  In regards to the answer that says that all religious people are ignorant, I strongly disagree. We do not think that human nature is a sin, but no human being is perfect. Every human on this earth is a sinner, there was only one perfect person and that was Jesus Christ. And then He took the sins of the world on His shoulders and died for us, so that we can have a place in heaven with Him one day. I would just like to know in what we way you think we are ignorant?|`|zEf8bNCZaa	that was a very in depth analysis. i am impressed with your amount of research. nonetheless, if you were to ask a pastor, priest, etc, chances are they would tell you it is. most religion is based on doing what the ambiguous "church" feels is best to promote as right and wrong. for example, premarital sex leads to premarital pregnancy, and that is an alleged "problem", so the church preaches against it.<br>  personally, i do not believe it is a sin, however if you are still looking for personal guidance for spiritual reasons, talk to someone at your church.
54d43f085882b670493b9dac6f21163caa	Why should you care what he thinks? He's your ex, not your boyfriend. The fact that he mentioned it seems to show that he's the one with sex with you on his mind.

q4WcyJ6Laa	Get rid of him, that's creepy. He isn't trustworthy. He's a liar. |`|ZaMzRSrraa	one lie can destroy your health and life..he doesn't care about you   he cares only about his satisfaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for him getting tested after his last girlfriend ?...why...and where is the proof..he would have a piece of paper with the test results and itemized list of what he was tested for.<br>  <br>  YOU CAN GET PREGNANT EVEN IF HE DOESN'T EJACULATE INSIDE AND USES THE PULL OUT METHOD,  PRE-***  CLEAR FLUID HAS SE MEN  - THIS IS A FACT|`|lyWSufFBaa	If he was a decent guy he would have put the condom on after you asked him to the first time.  I think you should leave him alone because doesn't sound like he respects you or your requests.  9/10, he has never been tested. You should have gotten up when you noticed that he didn't have one on....don't trust him.  |`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Two choices:<br>  A) He doesn't care about you, and only wanted to have fun.<br>  B) He wanted to get you pregnant to trap you.<br>  <br>  Take your pick.|`|e1oky4jSaa	He is a sleaze ball. And dishonest. You think he really got tested after his last partner?! I don't think so. Dump him and go and get yourself tested immediately. |`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	Wow! he is not respecting you.  I do not blame you for making him use protection. I would do the exact same thing and you should always watch him put the condom on because look how he tried to trick you.That was really wrong of him.<br>  If I was you I would be providing him with the condoms this way you know that he can't pull any tricks.  A friend of mine got pregnant like that with this man who put on condom but he put a hole in it and she had know clue that he did that until she turned up pregnant. Anyway, it is a long story.. Good luck and be careful.|`|uXdx9vuBaa	man thats wierd. be careful. You are right why would he lie?  What if you were drunk or something?  Now you have to be on the lookout all the time? what a sexual turn off that is too.  <br>  <br>  Even though he has been tested afterhis last parnter, he should get test six months later to be safe b/c sometimesthe antibodies dont show up right away. What if he has the HIV ? <br>  <br>  Guys are pigs when it comes to sex and they dont care.  So im glad you are smart and are usingyour head.  If he is being irresponsible about using condoms (lying about it) and dosnt think its such a big deal can you imagine if you get pregnant?  |`|OBBgW5ugaa	I know of someone who was in a similiar situation. Her bf said he was clean and that he couldnt have kids. She ended up pregnant a few months later...with his child and married the guy cause "it was the right thing to do" and not that happy. This could be you if your not careful. Guys lie to get what ever they want and tell you what they think you want to hear. Especially when they are after sex. Watch out!|`|bXCXvrOzaa	Uh, a condom takes less than a minute to put on. And you know, I insist on wearing on because well you never know for sure. If he gave a crap about you he would put on. <br>  <br>  Lose the idiot before he knocks you up. |`|mm7u00AJaa	He's an a**hole. Any guy that actually cared about you would respect  your wishes, especially about something as serious as unprotected sex! Good job making sure he put one on, but you should def. dump him...|`|ApYzZhXNaa	ya, he's a low life in my book.|`|9Xkbfnfcaa	He cares nothing for you. Get rid of him now.|`|AA10561878	he's a scum bag.|`|u9k20aGqaa	Do not walk away from this guy.  RUN!  First things first.  Even if a guy doesn't c*m inside you, you can still get pregnant if you're not on birth control!  Don't allow yourself to be in the position of getting pregnant, especially with a guy like this.  It would be your problem, and he'd be no where around.<br>  <br>  Now with that all settled, I can move into your specific situation.  Good going by protecting yourself.  This guy is a creep.  The next time he says he hates condoms, ask him if he loves STD's, or HIV, or babies.  The fact that he would stoop as low as to pretend to put on a condom is beyond belief.  You have a right to protect yourself.  Don't ever let anyone take that away from you.<br>  <br>  He is not a decent guy, and he doesn't care about you.  Move on.  You will find someone better.  For future reference, always have your own condoms.  <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped.
CyC37kblaa	Sorry to say, but you are stupid enough to still be with him if he is still chillin with her, especially if they still hug. That is a big disrespect to you. Obviously they still have something going on and she feels like you are in her way, since they been together before you and him. So my opinion is that you leave the F**ker and if she comes back up to you smack that B**ch. The guy has no respect for you, and the reason why people might be calling you a **** is because you are giving others the impression that you don`t have respect yourself by letting him disrespect you.|`|6f55018be55def6322ee6829868961afaa	Again, if he is still with her then you already know the answer.<br>  Have some self respect and walk away from him.<br>  Further, retaliation should be in the way of calling the cops not fighting.<br>  <br>  It's time to show yourself and them what a real self respecting lady acts like. Get a grip and dump him.|`|wWF4aholaa	I hope you are bigger then that to leave him you should not let no one take you through that. He do not have any RESPECT for you still hanging out with the nut. I hope you make the right decision.|`|AA10561878	He want leave her, your being used<br>  |`|b1a4386b4fc6c7c91135b3cb016a564baa	get rid of the loser|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he is still with her, and u too, he is probably giving her mixed signals,when there is someone else in your relationship, u leave, u get out of it.if she is trying to fight u, she probably believes he belongs to her, especially if he is still hanging out with her. |`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	If her is still doing all this stuff with her and letting her be disrespectful to you I say dump him.  It is not worth it and you can find someone better.

And then I would laugh my *** off to bed!<br>  <br>  |`|AA10796792	Unless you put them on him as a joke you should <br>  Tell him pink is not his color and to get his own lacey undies-as you would appreciate not having to share yours with anyone-thank you<br>  <br>  Seriously- some men like to wear woman's clothes and they are not gay or bi<br>  <br>  I, for one, would have a hard time being intimate with a man who had effeminate tendencies-some women are fine with it.<br>  <br>  You will have decide which one you are<br>  <br>  Good Luck- as this may or may not be a painful issue for you|`|e540c226567d45a2b9f2750a45a76d4baa	well if you were home at the time that would be a good thing.were you their when he put them on?you state pink chemise and lacey undies hubby and lol all  key words, no anger or fear. did this happen or did you fantasize about this happening, and looking for feedback before asking him to do so.or are you a man asking what other women think about this? well i don't have to drink to roll play with my wife. it is healthy, stimulating,fun and safe.and most important keeps the fire going.michael (ps my caps dont work sorry) |`|nChu1bNJaa	I would have freaked out.<br>  You need to ask him why the hell he had them on. I wouldn't let that go just incase he may bi or something.|`|oXF4zkAaaa	Let him wake up with it and look himself in the mirror and say I just need to stop drinking. These dam blackouts are going to get me out of the closet.|`|EyDcPuOgaa	Turn this tragedy into an opportunity.  Sounds like a perfect Christmas card picture to me.  Just don't send one to grammy!|`|yHeQ8IJBaa	So?<br>  <br>  And I was in your situation. <br>  I got one better on him. I wear his shirts a lot!|`|r3jTkZ4Baa	pour a bucket full of cold water on him so that he comes back in his senses|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	take pictures|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I'm surprised he could get them on while he was drunk AND that he could fit into them...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much UNLESS he looked really good in them. You can't have your man walking around competing with you lol. <br>  <br>  Seriously though...  sorry... I have nothing serious to say... I keep laughing trying to imagine my husband wearing it.|`|AA10153129	Troll|`|XkE7CcjVaa	Why did he have them on in the first place?? Thats weird!|`|7xGtL1vxaa	I would have took alot of pictures and emailed them to his sister. haha|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Taken a picture and laughed my butt off! I love seeing a well-feminized man!
AA10457523	Okay you already answered it! you say you love him then why wait!|`|b2dba795410dd17549205480791c1db6aa	Well if you love him and you've been together a short amount of time I would stop and think this ...If I love him and I want to be with him forever, why does forever have to start today? It can wait til next year, when we are financially stable. Age has nothing to do with it other than the fact that people change from year to year. <br>  <br>  But only do it if you can think of the worst possible thing he could do and think to yourself...if he did this this or that...would i stay married to him...I'm not talking about abuse. Like he had an affair for a week...would you stay or go?? Could you get past that, or would you let go forever if he was Truly sorry and wanted help in counseling or something...Think about stuff like that. If you don't see him 40 years from now when you look into your future and that doesn't make you sad, then don't marry him now. You should see him there and not only that....you should WANT him there. If you're already saying "we're going to be together forever" then technically forever has already started and Getting married will just seal the deal!!|`|8CxsuEOzaa	Hun only your heart can answer that question...If you feel like he is the one you want to be with then go ahead and get engaged....then if your not ready to settle down right away till you know your all secure enough have a long engagement..The man I am with now I know i want to be with but I want to make sure our home life and emotional connection will stay strong and stable..I don't ever wan to end up in divorce I care for him to much and if you feel the same way I do then I say long engagement would be good|`|23fd5355384e2b744c1372d2c20716bbaa	If u love him and he loves you do it... I have been waiting 5 years and 2 kids to even get a ring we both love each other, just the timing has never been right (financally) so i say go for it...|`|UW0k9wusaa	  Love is usually a good reason to get married, but sometimes it is not enough....  First of all.....how old are you?  are you finish with school?|`|I4HngkIKaa	I'd say no because you don't seem sure about it, having to ask others opinion.|`|PoUJ96hcaa	if u kno u love him then yea......u shudnt be askn this questuin,,,,its ur decision|`|lgxE5nUoaa	You sound really young.  Just the way this question was posed, I'm going to say no - wait a while.  A long while.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	If you have to ask this question, the answer is no.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	I think only you can make that decision.<br>  If you both love each other, he has all the qualities that you think makes a good husband and father for your future children.<br>  <br>  I was told before I was married: think over it very carefully, if there is anything that even slightly bothers you now, to reconsider the decision to marry. What seems like a very small problem now will only grow into something that may eventually break apart you marriage after some 20 years. -- whoever you choose should be as perfect or near perfect as possible. This is a very important decision that will affect the rest of your life.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If you have any doubts, I would wait.  I've never known anybody who regretted waiting too long to get married, but I've known quite a few people who regretted getting married when they weren't sure  If he respects you and wants what's best for you, he'll wait for you to be ready.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	It all depend on if you feel he is the right guy for you, and he is the one that you want to spend your life with. Is your financial ready.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	No, apparently you are unsure because you are asking on Yahoo.... If you were really ready then there wouldn't be a doubt in your mind. You would be screaming yes as soon as he asked you. So in my opinion, I say no|`|CqR6daqnaa	Being in love doesn't necessarily equal ready for marriage! Do YOU feel as if you're ready to be married? Are you financially and emotionally prepared for marriage?<br>  <br>  Just a tip: Generally, if you're so unsure that you have to ask strangers on the internet if you should get married, it's a pretty good hint that you're better off waiting a while!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|3b8JqVCdaa	Is he your best friend? Can you imagine your life without him? Do you trust him completely? Are you two very understanding people? Do you two communicate well and is he very responsible?Can you be loyal to him forever?Are you two financially stable enough? If yes and it feels right then do it and pray about it|`|YJNql5Mgaa	If you love him and you feel ready, emotionally, educationally, financially, etc, then go for it.  If NOT, then wait until you are ready.|`|Is6zxf7caa	Take a little time to think about it, weigh your options, make a list of pros and cons to spending the rest of your life with this person, and lastly pray about it and seek your answer from God.|`|QXGxqD2haa	If you want to then go for it! wait, are you young? is that why you're asking? I'd still say go for it though if you feel like its the right thing. |`|a3vRU4k7aa	dont be presurized into it wait untill your ready and want a big commitment like that x|`|x7zjq0S5aa	you are asking this question, you'll know it's time when you have no more questions, your heart will tell you|`|AA10561878	what are you'll ages for marriage ?<br>  
IPDwS777aa	well I may  sound like a jerk right now but I don't like guys very much if they look to chubby. and as long as you are kinda cute I would like you if I liked you personality I think that looks do matter but that's mot the most important thing by what you have said If i knew you i might be interested in you you seem like a nice down to earth boy, and I think it is hot if a guy play piano especially classical! |`|GFvfpYmYaa	Italian,nice skin, brown hair, gorgeous dark brown eyes, sweet talker, amazing smile, great sence of humour, amazing kisser, the BEST personallity, makes me feel up when im down and best of all loves me for me.<br>  <br>  oh wait im desribing my bestfriend who is also my boyfriend who i love with all my heart|`|IPBJ4MtXaa	Ages 20-22.<br>  6 ft or tall, dark skin, slim with muscles.<br>  Confidence, sense of humor, easygoing, open minded,supportive. smart.|`|QjFBuzGsaa	i like my guys strong, muscular w/ abs, tan, HOT, nice ***, good personality, makes me laugh, smart, cute, HOT.....just like my boo|`|D1ep6rBBaa	Sure you are date worthy... especially since your modest enough not just to say your hot...the fact that you make average grades and play the piano is really cool. So I don't see why anyone wouldn't date you|`|xfoUV1eqaa	Eh, you sound alright. <br>  <br>  I like them, well, first of all single. Brown hair. Green eyes. Strong. Um, well, they def. have to be funny. And smart and nice.|`|FMe5ahXXaa	Taller than me is the only thing really need in a guy<br>  <br>  but i like confident, sporty,funny, sweet  theatrical kinda guys. |`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	 Hi,<br>  <br>      I'm going to ask you , Do you think looks of just being cute and sexy <br>   makes us girls like a guy or even to you guys do looks of being hot and sexy makes you guys like girls ? Yeah, it always when we see them. <br>  But if you think about it,  your personality ,the way u are from the inside <br>   is real what people should like of their opposite sex. A guy may be hot and sexy. But it could turn out to be the worst mean guy ever who <br>  will make fun of you as his girlfriend, or you as a boyfrined may date the <br>  most hot girl but pushes you to carry your books and sh.. My point, is Don't ask us what girls like in a guy or what a guy likes a girl. you, It dosn't matter how smart you are , what grades you , if you have a chubby stomach , how tall you , It's about you being true to yourself,<br>  believing in your self . Right you are judeing here you saying I'm not really cute or not ulgy I don't get that , you are def judeing your self never do that . Hate when people do that . We'll not perfect as humans?<br>  But our attiude, our self-estem of being proud of who are does get us the things we want . Right now, don't judge your self . Stop descriabling your self like that. Go firt with girls by being you ,<br>  Talk to them to see if you have something in coomon, get their attenation by just saying Hi , what's up? I'm............ <br>  you know just introduce yourself, being nice is great personiaity is what girls like trust me like last time with this guy who he liked and Iliked but was mad. told him off cause he was mean.  Below<br>  here some tips on flirting , there you will find someone one day <br>  Good luck .<br>  <br>     1. First and foremost, remember listen more than you talk. this doesn' mean sit there like a dud, but ask a question, wait until she is completely done talking then agree with her. then sex.<br>     2. Now then, start up a conversation with her. Speak with confidence and flow, but do not attempt extreme images such as macho, super-smooth, cool dude, comedian, pick-up artist, witty conversationalist, or having a profession that you do not have.<br>     3. You can pretend the confidence at first. It will come more naturally when she responds to you.<br>     4. Don't overwhelm her with compliments. You should focus on going from "nice acquaintance" to "intimate friend/potential lover" quickly. Intimate friends joke around, tease each other gently, touch each other. Start with touching her on the arm when you're laughing (don't watch the hand). See if she touches you.<br>     5. Don't act like you're trying to impress her. If she really does something stupid and is a little embarrassed (not horrified) call her out on it. Smirk, say, "Wow - that was smooth!" with a little smile, then change tone and say, If you do or say something stupid, don't just ignore it, either. Don't focus on it for too long, but just say, "It's my first day walking. Give me a break!" with a smile.<br>     6. Throw in some jokes. Humor can relieve awkwardness. Alternatively, just learn to be witty. Almost all girls like intelligence as well as confidence.<br>     7. Show that you're secure with yourself and when you say something that you stick to your word.<br>     8. If you say something weird, follow it up with something funny and turn it into a joke.<br>     9. Sit close to her but don't breathe down her neck. Two chairs side-by-side are all that are needed. You might also be able to sit behind her and at times hit her hair a time or two. She'll turn around if she feels you, then make a joke that she finds humorous.<br>    10. If she has a scarf on that you think is ok or really good, tell her, and touch her scarf for a few seconds. and ask when and where she got it<br>    11. Find something that you both think is hilarious. Turn it into an inside joke, so when you want to talk to her, you have something to say no matter what, and she thinks that something is funny. However, don't use it too much, otherwise it loses its humor and her opinion of your humor is lowered.<br>    12. Don't always be eager to start conversation with her. If she walks into class, you do not have to jump up and say hi immediately, but if she sits next to you and initiates conversation, go for it!<br>    13. Be the man! Girls hate it when they have to start the conversation or take the lead (let her talk too though! remember, listening is just as important!). You CAN go and sit next to her/talk to her, if she likes you she will not mind (she'll love it!).<br>    14. Keep jumping from one topic to another while talking.<br>    15. Tell her some short wise and wonderful story if there is a long pause in the middle of your talks.<br>    16. Remember, strange as it may seem, since just about every boy is just as nervous about talking to them as you are, some very pretty girls have NEVER been flirted with or have had a boyfriend so dont scare her off! Sometimes these super popular girls are even lonely because they feel they have all these friends and no one wants to go out with her. So become her friend first and then move on|`|vBhCFZ8Maa	honest, caring, loving, responsible, full of understanding|`|exUORNCOaa	SMART, FUNNY, AND KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A GIRL LAUGH.... seriously ( we don't care about looks..:) well some girls do, but not most |`|2BUdFdN3aa	i like guys that have long hair good kisser cute thin cool clothes  a guy who really likes me not just to be nice or feel bad for not having a bf<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                what grade r u n|`|O9ZdwNIAaa	DUDE JUST ASK A GIRL THIS IN PERSON|`|MmlrDxtuaa	Everyone has their own preference to a good looking guy, physically (though i'm not shallow at all, i base my opinions on their personality 85% =D) he has to be really tall atleast 5'10 and he should have nice light eyes =)...his personality, he has to be able to make me laugh like crazy even when i'm in a bad mood or when i'm sad.

He needs to be concerned about things in the world that are important, but also able to laugh once in a while. He also needs to listen to me when I need him to and in return I will listen to him. He needs to be caring and sweet and there for me when i need him. But when it comes to looks, I'm really not that judgemental.

jKMH27gKaa	Girls with high self-esteem don't usually put up with poor treatment. Most of the women in those situations are really insecure, and some even think going out with a "cool" guy who's a jerk will make them cool and thus boost their own happiness. I used to think this way, but it took several hard life lessons to realize that it's not about cool or pretension -- it's about what lasts a lifetime, and working together as a team. |`|2hhGgKBZaa	The problem is, girls want everything! They want a guy who is strong and 'one of the boys' but also sensitive and loving, doting on them all the time. The bad boy who falls in love with them and turns into an angel. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately lots of girls feel the need to be with one of these bad boys before they realise they don't turn into angels lol Hopefully you'll eventually choose a smart one who doesn't need to go through that!<br>  <br>  |`|Bmvap7yIaa	Self esteem can be one of the reasons. I lean towards family relationship. If the girl saw her mom being treated that way and that's all she saw, it is easy to figure she will find that same relationship.

oxgpm28yaa	I've been in the exact same situation as you. Just text your friend and say to her how you feel, and let her know its not you in the wrong its her. You should never put a boyfriend before your friends, and your friend should know that. It aint worth losing 13 years of friendship over a boy. Am sure she can make time for you if you asked her too. Its the only way to get your friendship back on track is to tell her how you feel. It really works.|`|T2XQQ19Kaa	Okay, this is a tough one. You should try to keep your friend as close as you can and be understanding of her relationship. I know it's hard to do but she's twitterpated... like bambi would say. Make amends and let her relationship cool a little bit and eventually she'll need a friend.<br>  <br>  What you should say is....<br>  <br>  You are happy that she met somebody that she is serious with but you feel like you aren't as close with eachother as you used to be. You didn't mean to fight with her , it was only because you were hurt.|`|ezhSwX6Taa	if this is her first serious relationship let her alone and have your friend enjoy life. dont keep calling her. maybe she doenot want to talk to you  right now.is not to be mean. but i myself gone through what your ging through and i gave my sister time and did things by myself. maybe you should do the same.give  your friend some space and dont text her let your friend  get in touch with you and if not just let it go for awhile, sounds harsh but, is not and good luck|`|D99zRVTYaa	exactly like that you just did. but add on teh end "friends will always be tehre, boyfriends come and go"<br>  <br>  unfortuantly bluntness may be harsh but it really kicks people in teh crotch and getst hem thinking. i think it happens with alot of people. there first real bf or gf seem to dominate everything. it did with me but i soon learnt after we split that it shouldnt' be like that apologies to my mates and have learnt from it with future gf's. so do nothing, tell how your feel and leave it at that. she can take it or leave it. <br>  <br>  when they finish she'll soon realise he is not the be all and end all.|`|JB0gXyvKaa	First of all, you've been on the "friend" zone for too long and she feels that you aren't that close. I personally think that you should all stay close(understand her relationship+feelings) and become good friends with the guy so he doesn't feel threatened with another dude around his girl. Then, make plans to hangout with her and her BF. Talk to her about your feelings so she knows how important she is to you and let her know that you guys need to hangout more. But, if she doesn't care after 13 years maybe she isn't someone to "hold on" to and then you have to think..."why am i wasting my time? there are other girls, aren't there?" so, if that happens then maybe you should leave it alone.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!! I HOPE THIS HELPED!!!|`|RjUhISEIaa	sadly you didn't tell us what your situation is...single? lonely?<br>  <br>  do you know she doesn't care about you? why say it if you don't?<br>  <br>  and why would you run back first? to what?<br>  <br>  but you're not the one at fault? for what?<br>  <br>  seems there are more questions that need to be answered before anyone can give you a straight forward and direct answer...|`|wGlaCHHdaa	look i think that u should say sorry to her because it doent matter who started you should be the better man by saying it and try tell how u fell about her in way she can say no meaning make her fall for u
RjUhISEIaa	MOVE ON! There are many fish in the sea and this one isn't a keeper to put the blame on her parents while seeing someone else, that she supposedly also loves. |`|B78pNIQXaa	ditch her<br>  you are probably a good guy and she just wants to have you at her leisure<br>  |`|5GwVVEuMaa	She's dating someone else and still expecting you to wait for her? <br>  That's really not nice... I can understand loving two people, but if she wants you to wait for her, she should wait for you as well. I wouldn't wait for her unless you're so in love with her that you have to, but she seems like a heartbreaker, so I'd try to move on. |`|7097f5093a37f36b34a29fb20272314daa	Thats not the way love is suppose to be. If she did indeed love you she wouldnt be dating another guy. you can find someone else. |`|90c37438ebc2d17ec0c6de09e752ba98aa	No. Its that simple. And to date someone else because she can't be with you. She is not waiting for you, that clear. <br>  I find what she is doing confusing and chaotic. Its obvious she is young and needs time to sort her own feelings out. I think in the end she will wind up with no one and just focus on things like school or a career. <br>  You, however, need to let it go. And don't wait, you will just torture yourself. It will take time depending on how deep you feeling are, yet somehow I don't think its anywhere too deep. Be realistic about the relationship. Actions speak louder then words. She wrote she loves you but what she is doing to show she loves you is the opposite of showing love.<br>  Do yourself a favor and don't wait.

0D7mF9uGaa	I feel your sons pain. A child's words spoken in anger, have ways of haunting them for the rest of their life.<br>  I said those very same words to my dad, the night before he was killed. It's not something you can easily shake. In fact, I was 10 when I spoke those horrid words, and now, 20 years later, I'm only JUST learning to let go of that hurt.<br>  <br>  Your son is in pain at having lost his father. He's also punishing himself for what he said to his dad before he passed away. He's at a point where he doesn't feel worthy of anyone's love, not yours, not a girlfriends. He probably doesn't even love himself because of what he said to his dad.<br>  The anger.. is there, but it's not about that anymore. Dad's not here so he can't apologize, he can't know his apology was accepted. So he'll continuously punish himself, until he figures it out that dad forgave him years ago. That he's gotta forgive himself now. <br>  <br>  Talk to your son again. Tell him you understand, that dad understood. He was a kid, and said a dumb thing. But dad knew he didn't mean it. And that dad certainly wouldn't want him to keep hurting himself, punishing himself over something that happened so long ago. That dad would want him to forgive himself now, and be happy. <br>  And then, ask him to go to the cemetery with you, and both of you share that peaceful time together. Let him know it's time to let it go. It won't be easy, and it won't happen over night. but eventually, he'll see he's worth loving after all. That it's OK to be happy in spite of the mean things he said or done when he was younger.|`|Mtc6QA8Yaa	it seems your son doesn't need to be talked to, he needs to be listened to. you've done what you could do i think its best you get him a  psychiatry. now i don't mean to call your son insane but what these doctors do is they listen to what your son as to say rather then trying to tell him whats wrong with him. good luck to you i hope i could help, god bless.|`|okh3hL8taa	Your son is an adult.

Why waste your time and love on someone who does not reciprocate!  this makes me so mad when I hear guys being  manipulated by a women or girl...she wants to still be friends with you to make it easier on herself, so she can ease out of the relationship and not have to face it "cold turkey"!

Deep down u probably know why, if it was totally out of the blue then she's probably met someone else.  |`|QAyHs5DMaa	I think that that is part of being an adult dollface. You recognize that you loved that person at one time and just because things didn't work as a romantic relationship the bond and emotion is still there.

While some people may say that you/they can, it's going to be too hard to move on... No girl you date in the future is going to be a fan of you being friends with your ex... Also, either she was simply trying to not hurt your feelings by wanting to be friends or she is super selfish. I don't understand how people can hurt and dump you, but ask you to make them happy and feel better about themselves by remaining friends... You truly are better off without someone like that in your life... My advice, cut all ties. Good luck.|`|zLWIrqekaa	ah jeez, this is one of the harder things in life to deal with. All I can say is, there's no easy fix. it takes a lot of time, and you need to pace yourself. But it is possible. I was with a girl for 4 and a half years, and we were about to get married when I joined the Navy and she left me in Boot camp (that *****!) but we stopped talking for about a year, then eventually we started having awkward conversations again, then after 2 years we could talk normally and resolved old feelings, and now, five years later, we both feel we can call whenever and talk to each other about anything like good friends who haven;t spoekn in a while.<br>  <br>  She's not the first person I'd go to with a problem, but I know she'd listen if I called her randomly.

If he wont..seperate...sometimes someone needs a good kick in the head to realise....hey i screwed up ..i love this woman...I dont want to lose her |`|esjQZOtvaa	if you need pasion then ask for it.  you need to find that middle ground again.  communication.  what is that frustrates you about him?  you need to tell him how you feel, not in a way to start an argument but in a sexy sort of way.  maybe have the bedroom glowing with candles on night and some rose petals spread out over the bed, wear something sexy for him.  it is going to take effort from you both, but i think it will be well worth it in the end.  wait until the children are asleep and then go set everything up.  Good Luck!|`|AA11336623	Sounds like he needs to re-commit to you. I suggest a weekend for two. Have the kids at a family member and you two spend it together.

I do lots of partying with my family side of about 5 other younger [newly weds] married couples.  We listen to lots of good beat music, barbcues, go out dancing, shoot some pool, get drunk & doobied up.  Its all in pure fun.  Work hard play hard.  Just try to hang out with newly weds and see how [new husband and new wife] they get along.  I have seen lots of newly weds fight each other in heated arguements [adjustment periods] that I just laugh, because I went thru the same thing as them a long time ago.  Be creative. Think of some kool neat ideas.  I am 40, Life of a Party dad, every once in a while.  I still work hard and pay all of my basic bills on time. Just think young, like a teenager full of super high energy and U should be okay.<br>  edit1: Thank God my wife is on fire most of the time. Thats the way I like my women, on fire.  Too much heat for a woman.<br>  edit2: Someone said this 3 days ago here M&D "agree that sex should be dirty in order to keep the spark going." I totally agree with this.  Just share some hot, nasty sex fantasy with your husband. Get each other all work up and see what happens from there.  You guys better do something fast, because you guys are way younger than me by far.  If U R 100% healthy, then live it up to the max!|`|zL1sggpCaa	First things first... SHOW him respect. Speak to him respectfully, and don't belittle him.<br>  <br>  Second, work on you. Put yourself together again. If you're anything like me, after having kids, it took a toll on my beauty routine. Why not go out this weekend and get a pedi, do your hair in the mornings and put a little make-up on... if you're not into make-up (I rarely wear it and if I do, its usually just my eyes) then put your lotion and perfume on. Wear clothes for a woman, not the frumpy mommy. Hit the gym, because we all know that good can still be improved to great! :-) Plus, you'll be less stressed and in a better mood for your family.<br>  <br>  Then, play. :-) That's right... PLAY. Flirt with him, compliment him, play with your husband again, like when you were dating. And then, the cherry on the sunday... Hire a babysitter and go out, just the two of you. Stroll along in the evenings, hand in hand and go see a movie... or grab a bite to eat. :-)<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give you is to love him the way you want to be loved, care for him the way you want to be cared for and treat him the way you would want him to treat you. :-)<br>  <br>  EDIT:OK... slow your role... I wasn't being mean or anything. I was looking at my past and how I fixed things around my house... of which, I do what you do PLUS my kids are younger, so they aren't as independant. AND, I hit the gym every morning at 5AM plus I have physical therapy for my back after work... SO, calm down, I'm just saying that I've been in your shoes and actually walked 10 miles in them... Up hill.... I was simply trying to help you with what helped me... And guess what, my husband and I are playing again, making love more often and even sneaking "nooners" in, flirting and dating... AND, he helps out with the kids and the chores so I can relax more... All because I went and did what I did. I'm not saying it'll work for you... but I gave my two cents to try and help you, so no need to be rude or disrespectful hun...<br>  <br>  EDIT, AGAIN: Well, I never said you did... it was your response that I responded to.
zg3pRyzqaa	It sounds like you have a strong sense of your truth; regardless of what your brother says or does to make you feel bad. You are taking care of your health, keeping up you grades in school, holding down a job. <br>  If you are truly unable to move out, you'll need to find a way to persevere until you can.On the bright side , the only person who can bring change to this situation is going to be you. You can make a difference as to how you choose to react to your brothers' expectations, remarks, and blatant put-downs( I suspect he may be somewhat threatened of your goal-centered, stable life now). It's possible that he is  rewarded by your hurt feelings , and will soon get bored of taunting you if he no longer gets a reaction. <br>  Good Luck <br>  |`|6otGizQiaa	If your brother has always been abusive to you that could be what led to your eating disorder in the past. You need to let your parents know what is going on! There are a lot of articles on this subject that you can find on the internet. find one, copy it and tell your parents to read it!

Begin with small things. If he asks you to get something for him say NO. If he asks you to buy him something small say NO. Say NO to everything you know you can be firm and not cave in on. Then work on up and start saying NO to anything you think is unreasonable. You have a right to manage your own time without having to babysit someone four years older than you. If your parents complain just tell them to grow the **** up.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Liric's answer seems to be hitting the proverbial nail right on the head. Heed it please and you're brother will tire of the abuse and simply stop. Just give out a sigh each time it happens and blow it off.<br>  <br>  And cook him dinner? That's pure bs. He's 4 years older than you and can take care of himself. You just worry about your studying and working and let him fend for himself. <br>  <br>  Your brother is not your worry...you are and you just need to concentrate on yourself and not him...not him at all.|`|AA10730095	I think that you should make some sacrifice to move out of your Parents Home, and let them deal with your brother, he is never going to change his ways so if you want to keep your sanity I recommend you move from there before something terrible happens between your Brother and you.<br>  Sometimes I wonder why God sent some People kids if they do not know how to raise them properly, in this case your Brother, I can imagine how you must endure this living hell you are living.<br>  Do you have any Friends who can move in with you and share the rent Money in an Apartment? Or if you are going to College do they have Dormitories for you or anyone to rent? I sure hope you will be able to keep your sanity, and I wish you the best in the future.

4340dd3743e9f37aef4418dec2bdbb8aaa	The most I would spend is $200. Luckily, I got my dress for FREE. A friend of mine gave me her beautiful, custom-made designer dress (from her 2nd marriage) in exchange for my design services (I'm a graphic artist). My advise: Spend as little as possible.|`|0XcauowBaa	Every ones limit is different, it's depending on the style, the designer or where you are planning on purchasing it. Also, where you are having the wedding, if it's fancy or just plain.<br>  <br>  <br>  As per my friend getting married in 9/09:<br>  If you're going to Davids Bridal I wouldn't expect to spend any more then before alterations 800$.|`|pabZT3T1aa	I would buy whatever i thought looked good on me, after all it is your most important day. Maximum would be 1000 pounds. If i liked something that was a little over that price i would go over it, but if it was alot over that price, i would not get it. If the person i am getting married too truly loves me, they would be happy with the way i looked, no matter how much i spend on the dress.|`|q7NrlanJaa	I'm planning on no more than 300ish off the rack with no alterations hopefully.  My wedding budget is small and I just can't see spending more than that on a dress I will never wear again.  If you want my advice, you can find a good looking dress for under 500 off the rack and it might not even need to be altered.  You just have to do a little more research to find it.  There is always online dresses, which in some cases can come from the same exact place the designer dresses come from but for a fraction of the price.  Just be careful to pick the right size and find out what the return policy is.  Good luck!|`|RgFTYvoIaa	I spent a little over $5,000. Custom fit/swarovski crystals hand sewn on. It's a PLATINUM By Priscilla of Boston. Probably wouldn't spend over $10,000 on a dress...that's a little much even for my tastes. I am donating my dress after I am married however because I see no need to have it when someone else can get a good wear out of it.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Before I started shopping, I set a mental budget of 4,000 max. Lucky for me the dress I chose was only 700! Alterations were 350.|`|wUt3Med6aa	im too cheap, so i bought mine used for 200$, including a matching shawl lol. <br>  It's perhaps not my "dream" dress, but certainly nice, and nice on the wallet lol<br>  congrats everyone|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I went into dress shopping without a defined budget. My tastes gave me an idea of what my budget should be. <br>  Most of the dresses I liked were $2000 to $3000. However to me $3000 is WAY too much for a dress. There is one I LOVE for $2000 and that still seems like a waste of money. <br>  <br>  I think that would be my maximum, $2000.<br>  <br>  P.S. I read somwhere that the dress is typically 10% of the overall budget. Of course people spend more or less than that, but I think it is a good benchmark to start.|`|AA11603468	I wanted it to be $200 at most. It was $1100.00. I got over it even though it made me sick to my stomach at first.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	The cost of these dresses is crazy (have you seen that "say yes to the dress" program?  they cost THOUSANDS!!!).<br>  <br>  Originally I wanted to stay under $1,000 before alterations and found several options that were nice but not quite what I was looking for so there would have been massive alteration costs.<br>  You say "i want sleeves" and they immediately assume you are a total prude and there is no neckline because the dress is fitted around your neck completely.<br>  I determined that I was going to have to settle and figured that I would do my best to get the least expensive dress possible that I still really liked so if I had to pay a ton to have it altered it would work out.<br>  <br>  I found a dress on eBay from a seller in china for $219 including shipping.  It won't need any alterations at all.  While I wasn't able to get sleeves, I was able to get a dress with straps (so I can wear a normal bra) and I got a matching jacket for it.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I originally thought that I would spend any amount of money.

3xsnofM6aa	Speaking as an adoptee (plus army wife and ex-soldier as well as mother and also 5 miscarriages) there are always ways to adopt. (also don't give up on having one of your own. I was told i never would and now i have a 19 month old daughter)<br>  Actually not too long ago there was a story (unable to locate it now) of adoption agencies having so much trouble placing black babies that they were sending them to soldiers overseas to be raised. <br>  I'm not going ot tell you that you are too young or to give up however i am going to caution you. Adoption is not an easy process nor does it happen over night. DO NOT trust any adoption agency that tells you they can have a little girl in your arms and legally yours in less then 6 months!!! I have seen it before where it happened (except it was a boy) and then 5 years later the biological parents showed up and just took him back. Come to find out the agency did not complete all the proper paperwork and because of it they lost their son. <br>  IF  IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS!! <br>  What I can do other then caution you is if you give me a few days I can speak with my mother and see what she says (she's adopted 22 kids in all). Email me through my profile and I will get back with you.|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	Sorry to hear about your miscarriages. That must be so heartbreaking! I wish you the best in adopting however perhaps you should wait until you can provide a stable home for your child. It is not good to move your child around all the time.  Have you looked into adopting from foster care? Those are the kids who really need good homes.|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Do you speak the language where you're stationed? If so, go to one of the local churches, I find churches are good resources for finding helpful caring people. Tell them your story and ask them to help you find an international adoption agency or a local woman looking for adoptive parents for her baby. <br>  You can also try the Ukraine and China. China has lots of little girls waiting for parents.I don't know if they have age requirements or not but it wouldn't hurt to look into it. My niece and her husband when they were 24 adopted 2 little boys from Russia.<br>  Good luck and many blessings on you for giving a child a home.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You are too young.  Most agencies will cater to older couples who have been married longer.  <br>  <br>  I suggest waiting, getting some therapy to help you deal with the loss from your miscarriages, and wait a while.  There is always time to have a family.  Spend time getting prepared.|`|AA10561878	wait until you return home.
PeQs2b7eaa	Ooh she definitely likes you! I know my friends do the sip out of the water bottle thing when they like a guy.<br>  I'd suggest asking her out.

3M0Gm8DVaa	You could buy something and have it shipped 2 day.  Most places will not ship on Sunday, and UPS and Fed-Ex do not deliver on Saturday in the region I live in.  Most stores, if you buy online, offer overnight shipping, but the cost is higher.  Try to think of something funny or light to get him.  You know his tastes.  He could probably use something lighthearted to make him smile and lift his spirits considering that he and his girlfriend just broke up, you suggested that it would be wise for the two of you to wait a while before dating, and the stress of school and the test.  Try to think of something so that when he opens it, he can not help but laugh, roll his eyes, and think ONLY YOU could have come up with this!  Good luck.|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	It`s not wise to sit between the two chairs. As a friend, that`s alright.

ugRN86bYaa	How to get over him is to break all ties (except when you have to see him at school) with him and just wait it out. Time is the best healer. Finding someone else will help too; even if you aren't madly in love with the person; just having a firend helps.
5GesknO0aa	What? You must know some shallow *** guys. I can't stand girls that act like total super-sluts and expect guys to fall all over them. I would like my girl to be good-looking, but not drop dead gorgeous of course. She HAS to be smart, the dumb kind are no fun. And outgoing, of course.. I don't want to do all of the talking. You sound like a great girl and any guy would be lucky to date you. |`|nfK5aKtTaa	well as we saw on halloween my shmieg, boys just love whores. that's a fact. especially when they're 17. with a bajillion random hormones racing around. but remember, we're hot, we don't even need costumes ;) hahah|`|W2ya4Gk5aa	i hate girls like that cause they think they can get whatever they want when all they do is show off there body parts i don't fall for girls like that ur more my type ; )|`|JfwzuyLyaa	becus most boys wanna get in her pants|`|jGC3Polzaa	Prbly 'cuz you don't want to put out.  Guys just want to get laid.  Also it is true the nice always finishes last.  So take it from me go get yourself a nice guy.  They will be more likely to be considerate of your feelings.
ZEP1K3oSaa	Sweet heart love exists! Your looking for a Definition on how do you apply it to being with one person I presume.  The bottom line is man has skewed love for selfish gain.  There is now laws to love, either you feel a deep connection with others or you don't!  You have to recognize love exist, do you love your mom, dad, brothers, grand parents, best friends!  Honey that's all love, now if your talking about "Loving a boy or man" that's the same kind of love, however with this category of love, there usually comes the want for intimacy of a sexual nature.  Now when I said "Man" has skewed love for their own selfish gain, what I mean is as humans we want to harness the emotion of love for our selves and attach it to what we feel with our lover(s) the ones we are intimate with.  So the bottom line with "Love" is you experience it everyday and to the degree your experience is up to each and everyone of us.  So there you go, believe or don't believe, it's really how you apply the notion and "feeling" of love that matters, cause love exist and is all around you and me everyday!  Best of luck to you hope this helps frame a deeper understanding of love whether it helps you believe or not! I'm here any time...<br>  <br>  GAH

mUMMLjDdaa	hello megan my friend, i see nothing wrong with it at all.
8aXDhia7aa	I would disagree.  I think my husband sounds like your husband and I know my husband very well.  You need trust in a relationship and you need to ask why you don't trust him.  Why would it be strange if he had to work late?  Many men do.  The fact that he is saying I love you in front of other people, women, is a really good sign and shows he has nothing to hide.  To me, it doesn't really sound like anything to worry about.  When you should start worrying is when he acts differently with you, doesn't want sex etc, hides his phone a lot (so you can't see who is calling or texting), is evasive about where he has been (if he's telling you he is out with a girl then he's not hiding it!), you get strange calls at home, he is suddenly dressing up a lot more / wearing cologne etc / sprucing himself up more than usual.  Things like dancing with another girl aren't red flags.  Some people are too sensitive about that sort of thing...sometimes people need to feel a bit attractive and 'wanted' by the opposite sex even if they have absolutely no desire to cheat.  Its human nature and anyone who tries to stop this in their partner is only going to make them be secretive.  When you've been with someone so long you do forget what its like to be looked at so it does feel nice to know you can still attract someone.  Completely innocent even if some people are unrealistic and think it is not acceptable!  I think you're ok and he isn't cheating.|`|V0qntsyZaa	All these activities are stealing time from your relationship.  You should be his number one priority.  His hanging out with other women will more than likely eventually lead to him cheating.<br>  <br>  4. is especially troubling.  He allowed and fed her obsession...very very wrong.|`|OnzlXtT2aa	 Sounds like you need to have a heart to heart with him.  |`|ZykGeW5Oaa	If you suspect your spouse of cheating on you, you'll want to read this|`|AA11631747	Hey Sara don't be worried at all. <br>  <br>  Just close your eyes and pretend this is all a bad dream and will go away on it's own. <br>  <br>  Then when one day reality finally hits you square in the face, just close your eyes again and pretend its happening to someone else not you.<br>  <br>  He's a fine army lad, that smart scheming lying hubby of yours.|`|GhtDWkQHaa	If I were you, I know I'd be worried.<br>  <br>  Personally, it seems as though you're very passive about this, or you just don't want to make a "big deal" about seemingly nothing.<br>  <br>  I suggest you start establishing the fact that you HAVE noticed these things, show that you aren't ignorant, and let him know how acceptable you find his actions.  Tell him your stance on cheating, and make sure he knows that his actions are unsettling to you.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Open your eyes and your mind, girl.|`|pOCabUMvaa	1-5 all red flags!!<br>  <br>  Yes, you should be worried, he is a player, and I have a feeling he does not want to be married.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, would he like it if you did the same things he is doing??<br>  <br>  Time to have "the talk".|`|kHRD7uUAaa	why worry about it are you being deprived anything?  no need to stress if he is he is maybe you should start picking up the paste a bit in the relationship not worrying what he is doing but looking at what you can do.|`|AA11305351	All the things you mentioned are inappropriate actions for a married man. If he wants to stay happily married, he needs to change immediately. You have every right to be upset....totally inappropriate!|`|So8yzf8Maa	You might want to confront him on this.

It's a testosterone thing.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Wake up and smell the coffee sweetheart....cause it's boiling over !!|`|H7hHCHRkaa	No you are not being ridiculous even if your man is not cheating this kind of behavior is not acceptable anyway when you are married!

Check his mobile phone when he is in the shower or asleep to see what number he phones the most and check for text messages as well, as you will need some proof before you come out accusing him of being up to no good. Hope you sort it out, good luck.|`|Yx5LTlDwaa	I would be worried....<br>  perhaps its time for you to ignore him and go out with "male' friends and do activity or do and see what he'll say..i promise you..he won't like it and he will be all over you and wanting to be with you....if he complains about you having male friends, tell him...but you are doing the same thing with all these women...whats difference?<br>  See the results and u'll know it....
AA12333135	I just wonder if he is using this as an excuse why not ask him that will give you back a bit of power. Tell him that the past doesn't equal the future and is this an excuse? If he loves you it wouldn't matter tell him is is you that I sleep with. I hope that it works out ok for you.|`|m7putYGmaa	he shouldnt be mad if you saw this other guy while you and your bf were having a BREAK<br>  <br>  the whole point of a break is so that there is no commitment and you get the chance to kind of do what you want<br>  <br>  whatever you did, when you were not with your boyfriend is none of his business<br>  <br>  he shouldnt be mad, and if he is, then he should not have agreed to the break<br>  <br>  ask him if he did anything with some other girl and get mad at him!|`|M63kq3AYaa	Serves you right, plain and simple. <br>  Hiding the truth leads to problems, all you can do now is learn from that and move along.|`|KslfBKo4aa	What does he care what you did while you were broken up?

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Telling him that you are a lesbian is worse than just telling him that it is not working and that you are no longer in love with him. If you tell him that you are a lesbian he will be afraid that he turned you that way and it could effect his ability to move on and to have a healthy and rewarding relationship with a woman that does think that he is the cat's pajamas. If he is the father of your child then why start lying... like you said, you are going to deal with him on some level for the rest of your child's life. Be honest, be mature, and lead by example that it is possible to break up and treat each other civilly as the parents of your daughter.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should have told him you were bi? Maybe he would not have been with you, you would not be sharing a child together, and you would not be having to "break" any news to him. Sounds to me like you were not honest and that you may always have trouble being happy in a straight relationship.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Telling him that you are a lesbian is just a slap in the face. Just tell him your feelings for him have changed and you want to break up. That's the truth. <br>  <br>  You should never hide the fact from anyone you meet that you are bi-sexual. You should have told your boyfriend that when you met him. Now if you tell him, it's only going to make him feel like less then a man.<br>  <br>  Girl, you screwed up big time. Shame, shame!<br>  <br>  I have never understood people who say they are bi-sexual. You are either straight or you are gay. Why is it so hard for you to face what you are sexually and be happy with only one sex. This going back and forth and trying to have both life styles screws you up and hurts the people you are with. <br>  <br>  What you are doing is no different then a gay man, who refuses to except the fact that he is gay and he gets married and has children with that woman, because he wants the advantages of living the life of a straight man. That's just wrong. You need to make up your mind. Are you straight or are you a lesbian?|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Always tell the truthi know its hurts but its always the best way.|`|92gIBc9waa	Just tell him you are done he is not the one or you. Story over.<br>  |`|5NkEuz6Zaa	the lie is wrong flat out and it will come out.. its better to explain that you don't have the same feeling, that you have though it over a lot [ do a 2 sided note book for your self ONLY ]  and that while you will alwas care for him and want him to be part of your child's life. <br>    you just need to move on and NO there is nothing he can do to change, and no your not explaining. but its over and you / he is moving. Bye. <br>  <br>  hardest , but best all around and easiest to get over, instead of making him try to fix ONE thing that n other might like.  good luck|`|reWThTsXaa	Hmmmm.  I know its hard to hand over that final blow. But do you think the lie won't eat you up inside later. Unless you don't mind lying. You are hurting him more by staying with him when you don't love him. |`|4hGtHm9laa	Lying is wrong, period.<br>  <br>  Don't try to justify bad behavior.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should not be so selfish and be more responsible.|`|rCjpVXpLaa	Just work with him when it comes to seeing his child. Be fair and he will or should respect you.|`|AjCxg8mFaa	Tell him the truth. |`|bpjpD7W3aa	eeeyuu|`|oHTHvOHTaa	The truth will set you free no matter how bad and hurting it is!|`|AA10561878	Can you say 3some.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Hard spot to be in, girlie. I would be honest though. I think the lesbian thing could potentially just make things worse. Since you will be more or less tied to him for awhile since you have a  child together, he'll realize sooner or later that you were not truthful, which could make it a whole lot worse, in the long run.<br>  Hard situation..no doubt. But honesty is best. Good luck to you. It's so great to see you back, and I truly hope things work out for the best for you and your child.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Then you are honest to him and with him. The lesbian act may backfire as well
EExGJEPGaa	sexy as hell|`|cCTJJlPPaa	ohhh i would be highly pissed if i were you.<br>  I would go off on him lol|`|f1abed068eb1210b685600e9593a791caa	Before you jump to conclusions... talk to him and see if it was anymore than just dancing. Also consider his relationship with this person is she a random girl or one of his buddies? I think it depends on the situation. I wouldn't be all to pleased with my boyfriend grinding with other girls but if he was just having a good time and didn't mean to upset you he should let you know that.|`|iANQGBK3aa	well look to be honest i would be seriously mad and jealous, i dont think your boyfriend really knows what hes got.<br>  To be doing that to another girl instead of his own girlfriend is really back stabbing dont you think?|`|8LEm8r8paa	awww =[ am so sorry =[ i would have been really mad i would call him over show him the pic and sit and talk with him ask why would he do that, and tell him how you feel =[ thats really grimy am sorry|`|yI0mwhSdaa	ehhhhh<br>  i think he was just partying. |`|I25M4tmlaa	YES i would be maddddd|`|DmcHCb2Raa	yeah, i'd be pissed
dN3Ik6fPaa	You are still affected by it because you allow it to affect you. Leave the past where it belongs ... the past. Stop dragging it up into today. When you do that, it has no power over you and cannot hurt you any longer. |`|cOpAKmPsaa	I think it is because you love your BF so much that you are jealous to her that maybe your BF is still thinking and cannot forget that girl. Maybe if you want talk to him so that you have confidence to be married or to have a family- to be a mother. So talk to him so that you can have happiness to your BF and accept his ex-GF because if she's good you could be best friends again.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Look! We all have past lives we'd like to deny.... Move on to now and be happy for once in your life. Leave it in the past... Past is what it is...

BUT WHY SHOULD i lower myself... i just take it as He used her and shes the one that should feel bad cors WE STILL TOGETHER AND HE REALLY LOVES ME... but in your case i just feel that back in your mind you trusted your girlfriend and although it happened (years apart "going out with your bf) you just cnt believe it and it will fade away, dnt worry but just be alert! who knws she was jealous of you those years already and still is! all advice i can give you is NEVER EVER HAVE A BEST GIRL FRIEND IN YOUR LIFE! once they knw all your make ups and breaks ups and than the slide in your business like snakes! keep them at a distance... goodluck.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You realize that everyone comes with a past, and if the past plays that much importance in your life, you will find it very difficult to find happiness with anyone.  Just be thankful that you have him now and that he is with you.  Whenever those hurtful thoughts start creeping in your thoughts stop them by thinking of something fun and current that you and him just completed.  It will take some work, but with practice you will soon find that all the haunts will soon stop.  Good luck.
RjUhISEIaa	First and foremost congratulations on 3 years of staying clean! You have got to be extremely proud of yourself and your 2 boys have to be proud of their mother too! <br>  <br>  His friends are junkies and his family are drunks. He's relapsed and I have one question to ask...<br>  <br>  WTF are you still doing with him? The time has come to say goodbye to him, get a divorce, custody of the boys and rid yourself of this man. You have proven that you want to stay clean. He has not. <br>  <br>  The bills and the family. That's a tough part and financially it's not easy to raise children on ones own. However, if he is working you can collect alimony and/or child support to help offset the expenses and you might be surprised that you can make it.<br>  <br>  Before I get to my suggestion you did the right thing in contacting the Probation Officer regardless of what others here might say. Your husband broke the law and the officer needed to be told. There's no other choice that you could make...none.<br>  <br>  I'm going to suggest that you find an attorney who advertises that his/hers initial consultation is free. Take the hour to talk about your situation. Find out what they can do for you now before something goes wrong. Wrong such as your husband getting juiced up hurting or killing either you or you and the boys. <br>  <br>  You have to think of the boys now. You had your time with him and the time has come to think seriously, very seriously, to saying goodbye before it might be too late. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your two young men!|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	You would benefit from counseling and also Al-Anon. If you live with addicts you can learn some new behaviors, because you are probably an enabler. You did the right thing, but it will be all his choice whether to stay clean or not. Yes, he needs to join AA or NA, or get counseling, but it may not happen. That's where counseling for you comes in, to help you deal with addictive people.|`|DbgdLgYsaa	It is extremely sad and scary, but you and his PO cannot make him do anything.  It is a blessing you haven't relapsed too.  Unfortunately, looks like now he will get locked up again.  Maybe you should let go of him, you can only control yourself.  If you are lucky, and you may not agree with me now, but you might later,  he will never return.<br>  <br>  I have been in a similar spot, I thought I couldnt afford the house, but he is going to eventually make you loose everything and possibly even your kids.  If all his friends and family are losers, you might want to stay as far away from him and those people as possible.  If he does help with the bills, then he can also pay child support to help you when you divorce his sorry a$$ and collect.  I dont mean to be mean, but I doubt he is always nice, vast majority of people on meth are extremely abusive, if not physically then for sure emotionally and financially.  If he is, and I am almost sure of it, please go to the YWCA or somewhere where you can get a counselor to help you with getting your head straigtened out, so you can move on and make a decent life for you and your boys.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to say, but your family is already ruined.|`|nzWkRgpCaa	the only one who can help your husband is himself, good on you for staying clean, you are stronger than you think, and i am sure you will get threw this, think of your boys, it was my kids that kept me strong when i went threw something similar hang on in there, i hope it all comes good for you|`|4POGapREaa	WTF did you tell his probation officer for?  Do you want him to get locked up again?  Go to his friends, his sponsor, etc.  Is he attending meetings regularly?  No, his probation officer will not cure him of a meth addiction.  You did him no favors at all.  That's not helping.  That's ratting him out.  You should have talked to him about why he did it.  Get to the bottom of exactly when & where it started again & then help him to resolve it.
rlUUaSgqaa	I love him.  He's been my best friend for many years now, and I couldn't imagine being with anybody else.  I would rather be alone than just settle for the sake of being with somebody.|`|KWeU8LJtaa	Of course I really love him! We adore each other, and are best friends..<br>  <br>  Love isn't something you should just settle for..it's very unfair to both individuals involved|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	divorced 3x settled 3x married 4x now happy with my true love|`|AA10373027	I settled, and now I'm living in regret. |`|SENut7Oeaa	i will never settle !!!! it is love !!!|`|QCdpBqhHaa	I really love my partner w/ all my heart|`|XEIKvdtpaa	For muslims , its believed that no one shall enter heaven until he/she obeys his/her parent specially , the mother <br>  <br>  [[ And your lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents . If one or both of them attain the age in your life , say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour ]]   from Quran ( Isra 17:23 )<br>  And as a Muslim guy , I do love and respect my parent so much |`|XQGUyIAnaa	Yes I really LOVE him =) Weve been together for 3 years before getting married a few months ago *TEARS* I wouldnt ask for more. Its really sad to see that some people settle for something they dont love. Its also sad to see people Divorce because one cheated on the other...if you know you are prone to cheat on your partner dont get into a relationship or even MARRY and then hurt them!|`|AA11433608	Absolutely love him, although he forever drives me nuts. But I can't imagine my world without him in it! He is (I apologize for the gushy cliche) my husband, lover, best friend, partner in everything- all rolled into one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in your search!|`|6N53OENoaa	I actually really love my boyfriend he is everything to me, my life, air, water, food EVERYTHING !!|`|7JZZCZoEaa	I dumped the love of my life, now I want him like hell....but he is gone.|`|2kTpJdKOaa	sort of settled right now....might change things around though|`|qCCx5rsdaa	I settled, that's why I'm divorced.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Love him!|`|NMXfpPA4aa	I went from being madly in love to being disappointed and feeling like I was settling and now I feel that we understand each other better than ever before and very happy in love. <br>  <br>  So like the song says: "If you can't be with the one you love honey, love the one your with".|`|JoVWHvMRaa	I really love him! And I feel very fortunate that I "waited" and didn't settle before him. Takes patience and maybe a little heartache, but definitely worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  My best way to describe a good relationship? A breath of fresh air. :)|`|fm2PF6cIaa	most people just settle.  I figured this out for myself (I always just settled) and now I'm single until I actually meet the right person.  Man whoring is fun anyways.|`|fc214e893ee228e7fbbd1cc1b0a7d069aa	I really love her.  There is compromise in our relationship but compromise builds strength in a relationship.|`|3AKuxMM8aa	I really love my partner. We are really in love with each other. So I did not just settle. Good Luck!|`|6abf7247a5dd56b3ba99929911e1314faa	I think to a point everyone settles..... You will never ever find the "perfect" mate.

dGyX3E8Faa	GIRL DUMP HIS FREAKING *** TO THE CURB!<br>  <br>  No guy should ever hit a woman. EVER.|`|UP33GlBwaa	First of all, no guy should hit any girl for any reason.  And if he's hitting you, then that is abuse and you need to get away from him, and yes, do leave him for the garbage people.  Hitting not acceptable and any other form of abuse is not acceptable.  |`|Bdo2GNA2aa	him hitting you is a sign that you need to get out now.!<br>  <br>  you might try weighing out the good with the bad but in the end you're just going to end up getting hurt.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	If he hits you, you leave.  Simple.  And this is wierd...  don't ever do anything you aren't comfortable doing.  |`|AA11433608	First off- no one deserves to be hit- you need to leave before it gets worse. <br>  <br>  Secondly-<br>  Sometimes fetishes that are weird to some are acceptable to others. But in practice they need to be something you are BOTH comfortable with. Obviously if he is getting violent about your discomfort his fetish is obviously more of an obsession.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, if you can get him to have a conversation about this you two may be able to reach a compromise of sorts.<br>  Good Luck|`|ny5nw6olaa	Well to tell you the truth, this is insane and weird. If someone was hitting me, then I'd kick them right out of my life. I think you'd deserve more respect than that. You're a person..and people can't be owned by some boyfriend. I'd dump him =)<br>  Hope this helped.=D|`|C8ACJNaGaa	There's only one answer, if hew hits you...leave. It's as simple as that, don't let anyone treat you that way, just because he's your boyfriend, or anyone else for that matter.|`|oOFdDmSdaa	YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY LEAVE HIM...ITS LIKE HE'S SENDING YOU A SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE THAT HE ISNT WORTH IT....ANY MAN THAT PUTS HIS HANDS O YOU ISNT WORTH YOU KEEPING AROUND TO LET HIM DO IT AGAIN....you kno what you need to do |`|AA12389198	Uhmm he sounds like a creeper.<br>  & he's abusive.<br>  Get out of the relationship. Fast. |`|tU9hQlOdaa	o hell no you need to leave him like now!!! a guy should never ever hit you no matter wat he will end up doin it again he is nowhere near worth you doin anything for him at all!!!|`|kPW1uuHTaa	If he hits you, you need to get away from him immediately.|`|vOdCM4RYaa	You should leave him|`|9fDvbNWAaa	u need to dump him~ hes apperently got problems, and could go to jail for hitting him. LEAVE HIM NOW!!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|E3M33ybwaa	wow, thats really rude.|`|FrHhkAaSaa	he sounds like a sweet guy I would do what he says|`|lVTFgRdqaa	break up|`|Qqh2juUsaa	dump that dumb@$$,
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	wait until later, as u never know if u can work out the problems. divorce is nothing one should rush into, unless theres betrayal. |`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Do it NOW, stop dicking around.|`|NpcSEJX1aa	when is the lease up.you know if you leave before it is up your still going to have to pay your half..i would wait until it is up and then move out..but here a thing  you could do..divorce cost a lot of money.save up for it while your living with her.. that way when you leave you have the money for the divorce..sneaky i know. but that is what i would do|`|1k7LIZVWaa	If you can get along until then, sure.  Otherwise, it might be worth the extra cash to get another place, pay half of the rent until the lease is up on the place you have together and start rebuilding your life now rather than later.  It's up to you.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You are such a romantic fool. Stay till the lease is over. Renew the lease if you are saving a bundle.|`|oqX0PwQiaa	Now.|`|H8JL6REPaa	I agree, just because you file for divorce doesn't mean it will be final the very next day. It takes a while, sometimes months and even longer if the divorce is contested (meaning, if she fights it)<br>  Its ridiculous to stay in a marriage to avoid any troubles with a lease. Its disrespectful to her and not that smart on your part. Things will get worse, she will be able to tell you don't want to be there, which will make the divorce even nastier.<br>  Divorce now, stipulate in the divorce papers who will get the place, who will be responsible for the least or if you will pay to have each other released from it.|`|AA11433608	Staying may only complicate matters, especially if she is not in agreement with getting divorced in the first place. If this is th case she may see your staying (despite you telling her the reason) as a sign of hope in continuing your marriage, which may only lead to greater animosity when you actually do leave and then file for divorce. The best alternative is to have your name removed from the lease and call it done (if it truly is done). <br>  <br>  However, if you stay and there is some minut possibility that the marriage can be saved this may be to the advantage of the relationship. My husband and I had a similar situation, we both stayed in the same house (I was downstairs and he was upstairs). We had to stay as neither could afford to leave at that particular time. We ended up reconciling and have been happier than ever. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong I know not all marriages can be saved and not all involved want them to be saved but you should weigh all of the variables in this situation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in whatever you decide. |`|ztl5SRp5aa	It is hard to answer a question like this.  Why are you divorcing her?  Are you leaving any children behind, and if so, why not do what is best for them?  Is it a financial issue that you can't help?  I just don't know how to answer, can you give more background?|`|vvgGQm9kaa	u can file for a divorce but you dont have to leave right away - divorce takes time and just keep prolonging the moving out process until the lease is up (i.e. say you cant pick up the furniture etc, cant move it  out yet .. bla bla bla)<br>  <br>  |`|09434924ae4b4946daa1221acd7722e9aa	Are you kidding me?<br>  <br>  If you feel this way - divorce her NOW! Do her a favor so that she can get you out of her life already!<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA12252797	Divorce now.  The process will take a while to... 6mo minimum.  So start early. |`|cMksGiUQaa	Um, now sounds like a good time for you to file for divorce. |`|vJp6XYmwaa	Yes

KAFG6s5Waa	Try talking to him and let him know how you feel. If he truly is a friend he will tone it down.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Yeah, tell him to buzz off, or she may go after him.|`|gfGtx1m6aa	you have a negative mind,if you see something suspicious then yes you have the right to tell him but there friends,what's wrong with that ?|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Reading other answers I probably sound crazy but I wouldn't say a thing to the friend. It would just make him insecure with your friendship. Whatever you think could be going on when you're not around probably isn't... They are friends at this point too remember. I would say something to your girlfriend though. It'll make her feel valued by you just that tiny bit more and she'll know you're aware... DO NOT however, by any means keep commenting about it if you don't know that there is some sort of cheating going on, whether it's emotional or physical, it will push her away from you. We don't like to be accused of things, especially when it's not true. ...The entire situation will probably blow over soon.|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	Can you trust your girlfriend, if so.. then don't make too big of a deal out of it. Though I would talk with your friend about it. He definitely shouldn't be out-right flirting with your girl, especially if he respects your relationship. Tell him to tone it down a little bit, and that you don't appreciate what he's doing.|`|U7UjwzVTaa	Sounds like your insecure about this new relationship and a bit paranoid.  Unless your BFF has given you concrete evidence that he's after your girl, I wouldn't worry about it.  Keep sweeping your love off her feet.|`|xJ1TW5Gpaa	tell him to back off...<br>  <br>  get him right, that's your lady, and he shouldn't be disrespecting you like that|`|2y3ihWlWaa	I would talk to him only.  Cuz you dont want the girl to think you dont trust her or that you are paraniod so I would go to him and say, I really like her, she is MY girlfriend, and it seems like you like her when you act like that.  Dont be mean just tell him very forward so that way he will have to answer honestly if he sees you taking it so serious.  That sucks, Good Luck.|`|6N53OENoaa	Talk to your friend hun n den speak to your girlfriend. Explain to her what you think he is trying to do and that your worried. She will probably say your being silly and that your the only one for her, and thats good because then you will feel much more confident! =) good luck and all the best to you and your girlfriend x|`|jtPbmd7raa	you should tell him! If you have only been going out for one week, it's not that serious. I don't think that she would date your best friend anyways because you said you have been good friends for a couple of years. that would be really rude! don't worry so much! |`|Zt6Z3Fp3aa	Well, what kind of flirts lol, ask your girl if she likes it or not, if she says no, then you go up to him and tell em to not step off the line.|`|TYGBVuAwaa	its better that u just go with your instinct & tell him face-to-face as how u feel so that it wont spoil your relationship ,with him & your gal...|`|mved35RQaa	tell him to step off or something might happen.|`|wJvtErvCaa	just tell him|`|FpWfRW8kaa	well i would talk to both of them about the problem it has been my experience that if u feel this way it is probable warranted anything that makes u feel uncomfortable should not be something u cant talk over with either one of them  [friend ] girlfriend] if u cant be open and honest then maybe not so good [friend ] or girlfriend] .i would always listen to my wife no matter how out in left field she is her feeling are very important to me |`|a5e35H4Laa	you have reason to worry... youve only had your gf for a week, not long enough to develop strong loyalties. but your best friend should know better....or at least have enough class to be cool. i would tell my friend to watch his step or he'll get a beating.  if thats not your style or youre a sissy boy, then tell him your girl feels uncomfortable with his flirting...ands keep them apart.|`|ElsmPoYSaa	Tell him AND your girlfriend just the thing you just told us.<br>  Best thing is to be honest with both of them.<br>  And yes, its important for your girlfriend to know whats bugging you.<br>  Because if my boyfriend was thinking that I would want him to tell me!<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au6_CPbm7RLKwJO7XYEgs0zg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20081108061118AAf8pjA">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  If you want some fun answer this there really fun polls questions:)|`|eZhjIUEFaa	i think you should tell your friend that you dont appreciate him doing that, if he is a true friend then he will stop or tone it down.<br>  <br>  if he doesnt stop then you can try deal with it or reconcider your friendship.|`|rjHLCCu8aa	I don't think he could be trying to steal her from you.

He needs to know ckuz this is driving you crazy|`|bNPQP4CWaa	Tell ur freind to stop flirting with ur ur gf <br>  <br>  or beat him up|`|PJ5PKNxraa	i would tell him to bug of her and if he still does that beat him up |`|N0Qf9fU0aa	 firstly, why is he your best friend when you only know him 2 months :/ <br>   ... let him know that this is bothering you, let him know in a very nice tone that he needs not to be flirting with her so much, tell him how it makes you feel ( i am guessing insecure) let him know! he may be oblivious to stuff like that or he may also like her. do something about it because if you don't you make want to beat your self up for anything stupid that happens. on the other hand you need to trust her, and despite that fact that he flirts with her she may be well ignoring him. lol At the end of they day she likes you, you make her feel special (i hope..lol) she can not be rude to your friend and not speak to him, that just would not be polite because he is your friend. <br>  <br>  ps: maybe it is not the best idea to have your best friend and your girl friend going to the same college because eventually one of them would become jealous and want to be around you more and if you are unlucky like my friend was you would find your self in a situation of having to choose. (that's not good)<br>  <br>  hope that helps.. cheers* 
lVB9OjTMaa	just dont talk to him for awhile so he will realze he can only be a friend or nothing |`|jiwZQJcGaa	Try to be friend with this guy more , maybe this brother-like turns to be someone to love, fine some other guy to pass your messeges to your boyfriend and make him understand what is going on and keep your touch with him untill he gets you...

RjUhISEIaa	She doesn't live anywhere, has one child and another on the way? You did the right thing in trying to get the baby to stay with you but you don't say how you did it. I am guessing that you did not take the matter before the court, correct?<br>  <br>  The easy way out would be to let her probation officer know what is going on but that may not be the best answer to give. In reality, you have to think of your grandchild and what is best for him or her. You should find a local attorney who will give you the initial consultation for free and let you know if there is anything that can be done legally for you to gain custodial custody of the child. This then will give you an exact idea of what you can/cannot do and what options are available. <br>  <br>  The one thing you cannot afford to do though is wait. The time has come to act. If your daughter is sent back to jail you may not have any chance of getting custody of your grandchild and he or she may end up in foster care. <br>  <br>  It's not going to be easy but your daughter has for now let it be known where her feelings lie. It's your turn to let her know by your actions that you mean business and are not going to put up with it anymore. You must though follow the legal process and not take any of this into your own hands.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Call CPS and see what your options are for getting custody of her children. Until she grows up herself she has no right to be raising children, especially in such a haphazard way and I am sure the authorities would agree with me on that one. It may strain your relationship with her, but she's made her own choices and she needs to live with the consequences. Expecting her children to suffer for them though is an altogether different situation. Don't stand aside and let them grow up without the stability and love of a good solid home.|`|R0M1WCmZaa	call steve show!!! and she is 18 years old you can't tell her anything because she's older...and you should take her out to eat and talk to her about your feeling, show her with maury tv show that a lots of young girl does like her and want have a baby, or go to maury show! he will send to her boot camp then she will change it but she's 18 years old, umm try talk to her about your feeling or bring to her to the show!|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Time to let go but be ready to take the children when she finally goes to prison for a long time.|`|YG4VMafEaa	Try to get custody of her babies|`|BHeBSGemaa	First of all, you should definitely call child protective services to take the child away and have them give you temporary custody. She doesn't have a choice at that point except to give the child up. I am so sorry that this is happening to you. I am 21 and I have had my rough spots during my teenage years. Sooner or later she will realize what shes doing and how she has to change her ways if she wants to be a good mother. Once her child is taken away, see how she reacts. If she doesn't want to clean up, then you just have to wait until she wants to be an adult and a mother.|`|v0iBJDTtaa	omg! thats horrible! take thr baby from her or make her put it up for adoption! shes messed up im sorry! have her stay at a friends house (a girl) shes just gunna get herself in trouble and maybe if you have to call the police. get someone to help her!|`|BlSwxngGaa	She's an adult, this isn't your issue anymore. She has to learn all these mistakes herself, it will make her better in the long run.|`|uwtlAVPLaa	She's 18, these are her choices, for better or worse. |`|od8HUR44aa	There is really nothing you can do maybe contact her probation officer and let them know that she is not staying at any set address. I would also be watching as close as possible that she is not endangering her children, the baby and the unborn baby. If necessary turn her in to Children's protective services, your first concern should be keeping those babies safe. There is nothing you can say to her right now to get her on the right path, and the first and for most concern needs to be those babies.|`|qzKf2zCLaa	You're in a big problem. If I were you, I would ask her what was the problem, and try to help her. And then, I would say that she could always trust me. When she isn't in probation any more, see if she gets nicer. If not, go to court and get a lawyer to help you get your grandchildren.She sounds like she isn't fit to be a mother. And she might raise her children to be just like her. If she gets nicer, invite her to go home and help her and your grandchildren. If she turns mean and bad again, kick her out. She's an adult. Just keep your grandchildren. Hope this helps!
SU8z0TUoaa	Yes. Statistics show that the more smokers a person has in their life, the more likely they are to become a smoker.<br>  <br>  Are you enjoying it? This is the main consideration. if you like to smoke, then go ahead. If your mom smokes, maybe you can get her to let you smoke. Mine did. I started asking her for puffs when I was 12, and eventually she relented and started letting me have a few puffs. Then she started letting me light cigarettes for her. In this way, I was able to gradually start without having to sneak.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Katlin, it means one thing...it's time now for you to quit before it becomes too hard to do later on. It's that simple. And no, I'm not a non-smoker but instead one who has been lighting up for far too many years. It will get harder the longer you smoke and then trust me, you'll start making excuses as to why you still smoke and when you're going to quit.<br>  <br>  Do this and see what you think. Take the cost of a pack of cigarettes in your area. Say you smoke a pack a day. Take the cost and multiply it times 365. That's your annual cost for a habit not needed. Now, take your Dad's age and subtract yours. Multiply the annual cost times the difference in the ages. That's one heck of alot of money, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Now is definitely the time to quit Katlin. It you do quit now you won't remember my name but you will be thanking that "person on Yahoo" who said it was time to walk away from it...while you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ziEMimGnaa	I smoked for 8 years, I started because everyone I knew smoked. <br>  Even my friends. If you are not already addicted to it please dont start smoking. Quiting smoking was the hardest thing I even did. It took me 26 times of quiting smoking and starting up again to finally quit for good. Not only did smoking cost me about 250.00 per month (over 3000.00 per year and 165,000.00 every 50 years (thats a house)) but smoking is the number 1 killer in America. On average, smokin cuts off 20 years of someones life. If you start smoking... you will one day regret it.|`|AKkkMQoJaa	It can, just because they are the main ones in you life, and they influence you most. but my mom smokes, and do does my best friend, and i don't, and i wont be. |`|SBBnWsJJaa	That you are all going to die of cancer and/or get emphysema.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	thats up to you...there are very few people in my family that have never smoked...i did for 30 yrs before i finally quit|`|wqEKWd59aa	smoking is so sick!!!  <br>  Smokers have some nasty breath.  Their hair stinks, their skin stinks,  their clothes is the worst!  Looking at your picture next to your question, you are to pretty to be stinking like a nasty ash tray so don't do it!|`|okg1aa4Uaa	you should try to talkto someone about it. but dont smoke. its not good for you. hahah you should've heard that ever since middle school or lower.|`|DCgNID2eaa	Always remember that you are too smart to put poison in your body purposely.|`|80SrojSTaa	Not if you quit now......break the cycle.....|`|Vmv6d3wmaa	no (only if u want)
RjUhISEIaa	First and foremost my condolences on the loss of your father.<br>  <br>  You have a major problem on your hands and that is called "proof."<br>  <br>  How do you know that there was a "pile of cash" on the table? If it was seen was there anyone else with you who can attest to the fact that they saw it? <br>  <br>  How much money was in the pile? Can it be proven that it was "X amount?" <br>  <br>  How do you know the apartment managers took the money? What proof do you have?<br>  <br>  If you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was "X amount of cash" on the table, that the money was there on the day your father passed away and that the apartment managers took it, you have a case and you should seek legal council immediately to recover the funds. However, if you cannot prove any aspect of what was just stated then you are going to have a hard time recovering one cent of the money and it's best to simply forget about it. Yes, it'll be hard to do but sadly you cannot "prove" your case and the cost of hiring an attorney to try and recover it will not be worth it at all.<br>  <br>  Not the answer you wanted to hear but calling the police or filing a suit without having the burden of proof will not get your anywhere. Sorry.|`|QNSnnyLiaa	that is NOT legal.<br>  <br>  get a lawyer.|`|Zk5JDssuaa	of course it is illegal. contact the police to make a report (they can only be charged if it can be proven, so if you can get someone to go with you to act as a witness, do it; but don't let them know that that is the purpose for your visit to the office, then they'll keep their mouths shut). take them to court. even if your father owed anything to them, they cannot just collect the money themselves, that's what life insurance and estates are for. |`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	Did someone tell you he left a pile of cash on the table, did the apartment managers tell you this and did they tell you they took it.  Well unless you can prove any of this you have no recourse - in this regard, sad to say, first come first served.    God Bless.|`|N5CJH4JFaa	UH, HELL YES THAT'S ILLEGAL. It is called theft. You really should file a police report. Even if your father owed them money, it is up to the family to take care of this...They don't get to just take it.|`|ZCmbMcV9aa	if i was u, i'd Sue their ARSES and get MY money back!!! he's UR father, not THEIRS so the money belongs to you!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  =]
RjUhISEIaa	from how you wrote your question it's safe to "assume" that you're young...<br>  <br>  don't spend a lot of money on him...really don't. hopefully you'll have a nice relationship but trust me that the chances of it lasting are against you. hopefully this doesn't happen and you both fall in love with each other, get married years down the road, buy a house and raise a wondeful family but you'll probably have tons of boyfriends before any of it comes to fruition so let's see...<br>  <br>  buy him a shirt or a sweater.|`|39vmKwROaa	Something that will benefit both of you...like some sex toys|`|o40t5u0xaa	A threesome with one of your cute/sexy girlfriends.  No guy would be disappointed with that.  And its kinda a gift for both of you.<br>  <3 Lexi
jeO2FBPSaa	Please think this over carefully, I realize that living with your parents may not be an ideal situation, been there, done that. Being an adult living in your parents' house is never easy, but it's easy for other people to tell you to turn your back on your parents after all it's not their parents! First, let's deal with the situation with them; is it not possible to speak with your parents and tell them how you feel about their constant advice? Let them know that you need to feel like they trust you with your son. You are going to need to have this talk with them regardless of what you decide because your relationship with them is one of the most important relationships that you have.<br>  <br>  Grandparents can be a great resource when it comes to raising a child alone. I know because mine were around when I was a single parent. They can also be a major pain in the buttocks! Especially, if they feel you are doing something wrong! Now, the shoe is on the other foot and I'm the grandparent and my son is the father and husband. You would not believe it! He does something with my grandson and my mother comes flying out of my mouth. Such is life. (smile)<br>  <br>  Anyway, my advice is to please regardless of your decision with the father of your child talk to your parents and let them know what is on your mind. Even if you have done it before, do it again and let them know that from now on when you feel they are interfering you will let them know with a simple, "Mom, Dad you are doing it again...!"<br>  <br>  They of course will say something close to, "Well, I was just trying to tell you..." LOL But it will eventually slow down, (it never ends my kids are grown now and I'm 43 and my parents are STILL telling me what they think! LOL)<br>  <br>  Now for the father of your child, if this situation with your parents isn't as it was would you still be considering this? If everything with them was exactly how you wanted it to be would you still be moving out to live with him or even listening to his promises of some day we will get married? Did he set a date? Did he propose? Did he buy a ring? How is he going to support you and his son? How is he doing with paying child support? If a man can't put a check in the mail for his child what kind of husband and father will he be?<br>  <br>  I'm just asking the questions that you should be asking yourself. These may be questions that you don't want to ask now because you are seeing this as a way out but they may be ones you are sorry you didn't ask later. How did the two of you get along while he was close to you? How much moral, spiritual support did he give you while you were pregnant? <br>  <br>  Baby, if you really want to know how a man feels ask him the hard questions like; when are we getting married, (exact date!)? What is your plan for the future? What about kids are we planning to have more before or after marriage? Look into your own heart can you visualize yourself with this same man and no other for the rest of your life? Do you see him with you 5 years from now? 10? 20? If not rethink this plan; it is possible for you to find a small apartment for you and your son, close to your parents who will be a wonderful support for you and live independently.<br>  <br>  No one should have to stay just because I chose the wrong man to be the father of my child, if he is the wrong one then no you shouldn't go. If he is the right one then he will get a job, buy you a ring, propose to you, (romantically!), buy or rent a home for you and his son, marry you and the two of you will live happily ever after! (smile) |`|XqfH76PMaa	I understand wanting to please your parents, but you have to please yourself as well.  You have your own family now.  You have to do what you feel is right and best for you and your family.  If this is what you want to do and everything will be okay (not putting yourself in a bad situation or anything) I think you should do it.  You are not going to be happy if you only do for your parents and not for your family.  Your parents might get upset but they will adjust.  It is just part of growing up and being an adult.  I wish you the best of luck with everything!|`|A3sJyfaXaa	Go for it. If u marry him before he joins the military you'll get money for it plus you two have a kid so that means you'll get more money to support you child and it'll give you a chance to experience something new and different. Something you actually have to work for to get.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	They should be glad that you are actually marrying the father of your child and wanting to be a proper family. Tell them to let you get on with your own life, you're a fully grown adult and you can make your own mind up about where your life should go from here.|`|JTdd5Yehaa	Do whats best for your son<br>  <br>  Your parents are only protecting you because they think that's whats best for you<br>  <br>  If you think moving is whats best for your son then do it, if you don't like it move back<br>  <br>  |`|8miIDbjWaa	go with him, you don't want to have a son who doesn't have a father ... trust me. Your parents will eventually come around.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Yes.|`|oNV3RsP9aa	I wouldn't. Once a loser always gunna be a loser. If join great but I doubt he's going to do a 360 and be there for you and your kid if he hasn't been in the future. Stick it out you know why? Because being in a house with controlling parents telling you how to raise your kids is going to make you push yourself harder to get a better job so you can move out on your own and not be dependant on a man. What happens when you wanna leave him and 2 years where will you and your kids be? in an abusive home because you and your ex dont get along? you wont beable to be on your own because you would have been dependant on him this whole time. Go to school get a degree stick it out it will be SOOOOO much better not now but in the long run for you AND your children!|`|JcyFBTttaa	GO! Then only you can DARE! So Dare.|`|AA10250113	I think its time to stop trying to please your parents and do what is right for you and your child. Good luck! |`|RjUhISEIaa	You're 25...you're an adult...your parents have no say at all to this one and they should be happy that you want to provide a home with a family atmosphere to your son. <br>  <br>  Tell your folks you love them and will keep in touch and then go on a road trip. Let them know you love them and hope that they understand why you're doing what you're doing. Promise them you'll keep in touch and then make a concentrated effort to do so. Calls, emails. cards, etc will never be enough but trust me, they do help much more than anyone can imagine. <br>  <br>  Lastly...the marriage...do so in your old hometown so your parents can be a part of it and not feel like an invited guest! <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|oojO4WAraa	Do what is best for you and your child.  Your parents need to let go.  They will not want to see you move away and won't be happy about it.  But, if he is joinint the National Guard he will be deployed and not around for you - so you will be all alone in GA.|`|CApnEZ83aa	You are 25 years old and it is time to start living your life.  You will not be able to please your parents all the time.  I know that for a fact.  You need to be with your baby's father and move on with your life.  Your parents will accept it.  They will have no choice.|`|vLwxLFNnaa	Your son is more important than your family who "think" they know whats best, but really dont, only you do|`|zprAkP3eaa	You should move out, your 25 years old just go for it.|`|zptYSSjbaa	NO.  <br>  <br>  Tell "Baby Daddy" that he needs to get a real job.   If he joins the Guard, do they plan on deploying him?  Or will he be doing the two weekends a month/two weeks a year gig?  That's not ENOUGH to support a family.<br>  <br>  Also, he can be deactivated as fast as they activate his butt.  And then, where will you be?  <br>  <br>  If he's going to be deployed, and he KNOWS it--why not  just JOIN THE ARMY, where it's easier for both him AND you to enjoy well-defined, readily available benefits like: <br>  <br>  --Medical care.<br>  --HOUSING<br>  --Dental care<br>  --Reduced cost grocery and retail shopping.<br>  --Family support and services.  <br>  --CHILD CARE<br>  --Spousal Employment Assistance<br>  <br>  Of course, he's going to have to MARRY YOU FIRST for you to get these benefits.  <br>  <br>  My advice?  GET MARRIED FIRST.  BEFORE you move.  <br>  <br>  Some "family atmospheres" look better from a distance.  You could get down there, find yourself in a scene from DELIVERANCE, and be STUCK.  <br>  <br>  Your parents don't have to "approve."  You're an adult now (you are, however, an adult who doesn't think things through, aren't you?  You had a baby and you are unable to afford it.  You're counting on his parents being able to do what YOUR PARENTS are doing now--and what if they can't swing the expense of diapers and food and so forth?  You feel comfortable leaving your kid with GRAMMY Out-Law while you try to get a job at Walmart or Burger King?).<br>  <br>    If you're relying on your parents for day-to-day cash and support for that child, though, I'd think twice about pissing them off.   Especially since "Baby Daddy" isn't an economic powerhouse.   <br>  <br>  Boyfriend needs first, to get a job.  If he's going to go "uniformed" he should join the Army.  Then he needs to get through boot camp successfully, come home, and marry you, assuming he is sincere.  <br>  <br>  Then, before he's deployed, he can make arrangements to either get you into base housing on his home base, or into a small apartment nearby (if housing is full up).  He can arrange for direct deposit so you and the baby have enough to live on while he's over in Iraq or Afghanistan.  <br>  <br>  You should follow your romantic heart...but only after you put the welfare of that child of yours FIRST.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
RjUhISEIaa	You are going to think I'm nuts to suggest this but talk to your aunt before you seek filing a suit in the courts. Let her know of your grandmother and how she is doing and ask if she (the aunt) would mind if the grandchildren would be allowed to visit with her for a short while every couple of weeks. Offer to pick up the kids and bring them home. Do everything you can to make it easy for your aunt to go along with it. You might be very surprised at the answer you get for nobody likes to see anyone pass.<br>  <br>  As for grandparents getting visitation rights...yes they can. However, it's going to involve getting an attorney and heading into court. This needs to be discussed with your grandmother though for it is going to take money to win and she has to be made aware that there is a chance that the courts might not award it to her. You can talk to the attorney to begin with and get information but your grandmother needs to hear it from him/her before a final decision is made. <br>  <br>  You are to be commended for all you're doing for your grandmother and she needs to realize that the loss of one should not interfere with the love of others have to so much to offer and give to her.|`|AA10461616	I have heard of grandparents being granted the right to visit their grand kids but that usually takes a long drawn out and expensive court battle and even then the odds are not the best. |`|ddagVf4Laa	get a lawyer, grandparents are winning visitation rights a lot these days. I would talk to the lawyer before I told grandma to make sure it's possible before i got her hopes up. good luck!|`|A2Oia6xQaa	yes grandparents can get rights in most states it is not very much but at least the mother would have to go by them since it is court ordered and you do have to go to court it is actually in juvenile court, so go to your court house and see what the detail are for your state. and follow them you will have a court date. i do not see any reason why she should not be able to get rights.<br>  I hope this helps, just to let you know i did this in ohio and got right to my granddaughter so yes there are grandparents right|`|JF0SIngqaa	I know that grandparents do have rights. Not sure but I think you have to go to court to get visitation. I would call a Lawyer and seek legal counsel to do it right. Your grandmother may not be up to this with her failing health issues, but it may give her something fight for. Its to bad that the children are always put in the middle. they have a right to know the other side of their family.
wa18Uyeuaa	I'm almost positive you're making these shenanigans up.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Ask her if she brushed her teeth? Needs a drink of water? Has to pee? <br>  Oh, and ask her where she got the marker?|`|zAT1nrcyaa	thanks for officially scaring the **** outta me.|`|qK2B6Ivaaa	The anarchy symbol?<br>  Wtf?<br>  Babies don't know what that is.<br>  Yeah, I'd definitely be creeped but I have this feeling that you're making this up.
RjUhISEIaa	Thanksgiving is for family and she is your baby sister so invite her with open arms. Show her the love you have for her and keep the day positive in nature. It may not be easy but in the long run it will mean more to her that you are taking the chance with her for that day. <br>  <br>  You are right, it is her fault but we as adults have a responsibility to assist those we love every chance we can. Be supportive every chance you get.|`|BLEYaodFaa	      Number one she is 15.  If you push her away and refuse to see her, and refuse to let her see your kids it will push her into depression and even self mutilation, and the problems will only get worse.<br>       I do understand you not wanting your kids to be around that kind of influence, but I doubt she would bring drugs or alcohol into your home, especially on a day that is for families.<br>       I say invite her with open arms, but let her know that you will not tolerate the drugs or booze in your home around your kids, and that if she loves your kids to respect your wishes.  With that said sit back and see what happens, and enjoy your Holidays.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	I would only invite her if she calls and asks to attend your dinner.  Just because it's the holidays isn't going to change the poor choices she is making.  Your are correct in your first priority is to protect your children.  At 15, she is still a child herself.  Hold your ground, this is a situation for her mother to handle, not you.|`|sMWXKTptaa	You sound so proud of your-self , go ahead and pat your-self on the back..<br>  Your so perfect and you never make any mistakes, right!<br>  <br>  She's your sister -- Do your part ( be a big sister ) help her , you love her , right ,  actions my dear , you should know kids learn by example, what are you teaching your own kids by not allowing her over, shes family, you make it sound like she should never ever be forgivin  for her mistakes.. <br>  <br>  i hope your kids never make a mistake-- will you disown them??<br>  |`|85e8902f1245b50510d8e2fcf9b2a7b6aa	It is normal for a teenager to act out a little bit to assert her independence. she is realizing that she is a separate person, and wants to "find her own way". No child, and yours are coming up on it, is going to remain the good child forever. Teen years are especially tough. The key is to get them to get through these independence finding years without too much damage, or personal injury. Why is she doing this things? is it for attention? If so, give her attention when she is NOT doing these things, even if she rolls her eyes and acts like she hates you and her parents. Let her know that you are not going to give up on her and that you will be by her side no matter what. I would invite her to the family gathering so she realizes she is part of a family, and that everyone expects her to be a part of it like everyone else. I would give her a call and tell her you would like her to be a part of the family gathering and that you know she wants to come, and hope that she can make it. i wouldn't mention anything negative or turn it into a shouting match. You can even say "I know you want to assert your independence right now, but after you grow up you'll want to be a part of our family...please don't do anything that you'll regret later."  It is so hard for teens to see ahead of next week. but you must remind them of the consequences of their actions. Good luck.|`|W30MOowuaa	I would set boundaries on her at your home.  She is only allowed in the kitchen or living room.  She is not to go in your children's bedrooms or anything like that.  Make sure all your medications in your bathroom is removed for that day.  The first time she steps out of bound she's out!  No questions asked!  <br>  Been through it with my niece and I'll be going through it again this year.  Last year she was out in 10 minutes and I stood my ground.  I figure I work to hard for everything I have in my home.  I don't need anyone coming in and helping themselves to what ever they want.  So we'll see what happens this year hopefully it's better.|`|SZ0BI7eRaa	wow, thats a toughy. i think you should stand your ground and not let her around your children but you should also be there for her when she needs you. help her to see the wrong she is doing and what the consequences will be in the distant future e.g lack of jobs because of a possible criminal record or STIs/unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  also i think it would be a good idea to talk about why she does these things and what it would be like if she stopped being like this, what would the benefits be??<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|xHTogXLMaa	i know that you are in a tough spot i have a cousin that sounds just like your sister and it really sucks because you don't agree but you care and love them to much to turn away. I think that she needs her family and i think turning away is the wrong decision I think she needs to know that her family is always there for her because if she feels that you have given up on her then she will probably see no need for change. So I would let her come for the holidays but let her know what is expected and what you will not tolerate at your home. Oh and make sure you always remind her how much you love her and make sure not to label her as a bad child please trust me on that one because once a teen thinks everyone already sees her as a bad kid they tend to think that you will always see them like that and thats exactly how they will stay!!!! good luck and happy holidays
RjUhISEIaa	Take the year your father has given you and if at 18 you still want to get the piercing then go for it. It's not like he said no...he just wants you to wait and make certain you really want it...in a year from now.<br>  <br>  Father's aren't always stupid...sometimes we make really good and sound decisions and I applaud him for the one he gave you!|`|YgotIKEJaa	Show him that you are responsible and really know what you want out of life.  I say this from a mother's standpoint.  You are his baby and always will be and he doesn't want to give you permission to do something that you will later regret.  All he needs to know is that you really really really want this and are aware of the consequences that will follow, such as limited job offers.  Good luck!|`|amj0aOR5aa	I rec asking your dad what happens at age 18 that makes you magically able to get the piercing. My guess is that he wants you to be "more mature" before you make a decision that he feels could not be reversible. Just asking him, listening to him, and allowing him to speak, though, is what may convince him your are mature enough and do merit that piercing.|`|a4Fqb0dFaa	Just try to convince you mother! You just need parental consent.
aNXE5p4iaa	no|`|RjUhISEIaa	If "I" offended another would "I" hold a grudge if they got upset with me?<br>  <br>  Nope...I'd be glad they did for I may not have realized that I was offensive.|`|rno6XarMaa	When I was a kid, I got mad.  When you're a kid, and you offend someone, you want to squeak by unnoticed.  You don't want to be called on it because it's emabarassing, and people are making you feel bad when all you wanted to do was make someone else feel bad - the nerve!<br>  <br>  However, as an adult, I no longer TRY to offend anyone, and when I inadvertently do and am reproached for it, I feel bad - but not mad.  Still embarassed - and dedicated to showing the person that I am sorry.<br>  <br>  Biiig differences between being an adult and a kid.  (Or a childish adult.)|`|hr0Ja7MTaa	People are going to be offended whether you willfully meant it or not. <br>  If a person admits to the offender they were offended whether its warranted or not the offender just has to accept it. Apologize, learn why its offensive, fix the problem, and chalk the experience up to a maturing mind. <br>  <br>  If by battle you mean physical fight, harassment, or bullying to get your way and keep this person further emotionally injured/ physically then yes, the victim can take legal action against all involved. ..and if they are underage most of the punishment will fall on the parents for failing to curb their child's maladjusted ways. <br>  There are new laws to deal with minor harassment and lawyers are glad to blow up even the smallest incidents of bullying into assault in criminal cases. <br>  Then the victim can sue for civil damages.<br>  Public records can be sealed for underage offenders but the fact they are sealed can cause future employers/ colleges/ public schools/ private schools not to deal with young offenders as a way to deter violence on their properties. <br>  <br>  To end the situation.. the victim needs to document all instances of harassment from start to finish. If the victim has been stalked on line or in the real world .. he/she needs to keep documentation of it and keep the names and numbers of those who witnessed the problems. If not witnessed then document/ journalize what has happened and when as truthfully as possible. <br>  If the victim is hurt and can afford to go see a doctor ... keep all medical notes for later use. <br>  Contact the police each time he/she feels endangered physically..In example... If the persons are making threats against them or their family notify the school and the family and make a police report against the thugs. <br>  The cops may or may not be able to get involved pending the circumstances of the problem... but the moment  one of those participating in the "battle" goes to unintentionally or willfully cause harm, or prank their victim for malice .. then its a case. <br>  <br>  However, their have been worse retailiations by victims of bullying. <br>  .. which is what you have described...we have actual national days of mourning because a victim of bullying harassment or bully abuse went nuts and killed everyone around them because they felt no one was listening to them to make the bullying stop. <br>  I hope it does not become the last worse case scenario.<br>  I have had two close calls as a teacher.. a 16yr old black student brought a gun to school because he feared the local black gangs would do to him if he declined forced initiation and he feared the other Mexican, black & white gangs that were known for brutalizing students on their way home from school.    I also was in a charter school office when a 5th grade girl had brought a butcher knife to school because she was tired of being picked on by the school's resident girl bully clique. <br>    <br>  <br>

bPZlpe0taa	She's probably just really shy and seems to you that shes not interested because she's just shy to show her emotions if that makes sence,try asking her for her msn or to right it down,myspace or email,she might not think this is as bad as you asking for her phone number,you could also get one of her friends to give you her myspace or something or theres as well so you can 'accidently' add her. She's just shy but if you keep at it and don't act too boistorous she should come good.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Usually short answers are not a good sign. I would just drop it. Maybe wait for her to approach you and start a conversation. If she doesn't, she doesn't like you probably.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	Ask her question that require an answer.  Ask her what she likes to do.  Then ask more about that stuff.  Tell her you would like to go out some time if she says cool to that then ask for her number.  Talk about stuff that is happening at this after school program or stuff that happen in school.  There is a ton of stuff to get her to open up.  Make sure you get her number though... Good luck|`|04d175f4fe3bf0494d5a4da33dae7b5baa	LOL, you're right. we prob wouldnt be able to help you if you were wierd. <br>  BUT: i dont think you are :]<br>  as for your girl; she just seems like a really shy girl. compliments, while they ARE great, might make the girl feel more self conscious and shy. Just try to hang around her more. talk to her, ask her questions. dont just keep going on about things that dont really need an answer. ENGAGE HER in a conversation. dont force her...but make it so that she doesnt really have any other choice BUT to elaborate. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! :]<br>  |`|5LWq12epaa	she probably likes u, and u should start asking her questions about herself, because if u do, she can't say cool, she will say more|`|niew3v68aa	try asking her questions (not yes or no questions) like what does she like to do on her spare time and stuff like that or what she did during the weekend etc.|`|H2yheHoeaa	She could just not be used to guys coming up to her and talking to her. Make sure shes comfortable and the conversation isn't awkward. try starting the conversation with: 'hey, its a bummer that the course is gonna end, i know we haven't spoken much but you seem like a really nice girl and i wondered if we could stay in contact?' and take it from there, i wouldn't seem to forward as she seems really shy so take the approach of being her friend first.<br>  Good luck.|`|JzxiZkEAaa	get her to hang out with you outside whatever this thing is you see her at. if you dont youre never going to see her again anyway so whats there to lose by asking. Its just a casual hangout. Quit dickin around do something about it kid.|`|jL9myhmqaa	ask her open ended questions like where do you go to school, what do you like to do for fun, whats your fave music. etc. avoid yes and no questions and statements. the convo should flow if you ask.|`|c83b2550956f1523ccf89a395a7865e8aa	likes you...lol thats exactly how i act around guys i like..for no reason i just cant make myself talk to em|`|VF6ZX7lTaa	I am one of the most outgoing people I know, but if I have worked up a crush on a guy, even I can be at a loss for words..it's nerve racking...I think that she almost definitely likes you.  I would recommend you ask her open-ended questions, like what are her plans for this weekend..if she likes her school why/why not...maybe ask if she saw a certain show the night before, and if she didn't, ask her what she watches...if you are feeling confident, you could even suggest watching it together sometime! A compliment would be nice, too...but make sure it's something not very superficial and/or cheesy.<br>  Good luck! : )
efLL52o9aa	my son has never had his father around. he would see my son in the street and tell him that he will come by to see him, and never makes it. he does not pay child support at all and never calls my son. when my son was younger i never had to explain to him that his father is an @ss, now that he is older he sees it for himself. i never bad mouthed my son's father, but i would never make excuses for him either. the most important thing is to love your children, never alter there opinions of their father and never make excuses for him. your children will eventually decide if he is important in their lives. my son now loves my fiance and told my fiance that he cant wait until we marry so he can have a real DAD!|`|rYNWvQ06aa	,  Have their father refuse to see them? no i don't want to see them or hasn't kept  his word yet backing out and making excuses are not the same as refusing  to see them don't let  your emotion cloud the situation. share what you know in a non judgmental way with the children. assure them that he does love them maybe he trying to work some things. some men are jerks and are not a ware how this impact the children In the mean time encourage them to talk about it how this make them feel and what you can do the make them feel better|`|RjUhISEIaa	Mistey, it's not always men who do it but mother's as well. Years ago my ex-wife would make arrangements to see our son and then either call and say she couldn't make it or didn't call at all...on the day she was supposed to pick him up for the weekend. Not good and of course he would ask where she was. My answer to him was simple...I can't tell you why she's not here. <br>  <br>  Be honest. Don't make up reasons and just say you don't know why he isn't coming by. This serves two purposes. First, you are being honest with them. Second, it puts the burden on his shoulders when they ask him why he hasn't been coming to see them. <br>  <br>  It's not easy but you can make it easier on yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE TO MUDDAH: Congratulations! My son said exactly the same thing about the gal I dated, and married, and he has been calling her "Mom" for over 25 years! It's a wonderful feeling to have...and enjoy! Again, congratulations!!!|`|AA12198711	Tell them that sometimes people make bad choices in life. As they grow depending on their age they to will make wrong decisions. Help them to learn from this instead of being hurt from it.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't lie. The truth comes out sooner or later and a lie, or even a white lie will back fire on you. <br>  <br>  Teach them the right way.|`|QC94lBXOaa	I would say something like "I know you really want to spend time with your dad right now, and I know he really loves you and would like to be able to spend time with you, but right now he's dealing with some very difficult grown up problems. But I want you to understand that they are HIS problems, not problems with you, and there's nothing you can do to help him right now. When he fixes those problems he'll be able to be a better daddy for all of you."|`|7piH1EvHaa	You could try telling them he's busy at work, or he's gone away working for a while and you're not sure when he'll be back. It depends how old the kids are though, and how many/what questions they're likely to ask. But what if they ask him about where he was when they next see him and he has a different story to yours? =/|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Eventually your kids will see him for what kind of dad he really is, but let them realize it on their own. Until then, suggest that they ask him why he doesn't come and if they persist with you, a simple, "I have no idea, guys" will do.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Honestly, if they are old enough to ask when they are going to see him, you should tell them to ask HIM... HE has the answers, not you...
vYAgIMLdaa	it's part of the package deal. they go together like fish and chips.|`|RjUhISEIaa	My best suggestion would be to blow it off altogether and right now. Why? Be thankful you have a big brother. <br>  <br>  See, years ago I had a younger sister. When our mother passed away she became, well, a completely different person who was extremely upset that I was named executor of the estate. Making a long story short she filed 3 law suits against me and the estate for baseless reasons that were thrown out by the courts. Sadly she was also named in the will as being the executrices of money left to my son for college that was to be paid to him when he graduated from high school. Well that was in 1991 and in 17 years he hasn't seen one cent of the money left for him. The total of what she cost herself and me from the estate was approximately $75,000 in legal fees. The money she owes to my son now would be approximately $45,000 (this includes interest).<br>  <br>  Now you're probably asking why the story, right? It's better to have your brother be a friend than an enemy and know that you both love each other for you truly never know what tomorrow might bring. Work towards building a solid relationship between the two of you for you'll be definitely glad you did.|`|q5SWb5KZaa	because you let what they do bother you. I don't let my brothers bother me. <br>  <br>  I have 5 younger brothers. 13,8,8,4, and 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  I'm 23.<br>  <br>  ADD: How is he annoying??|`|8KAV2RwUaa	because there your brother and u love them even if u don't know it
HU3usKTGaa	Maybe the best way would be to be blunt with them.  Sit them down and tell them that if they want you to make smart choices then you need to be informed.  Tell them that you want to be able to come to them about sex, and not just get advice from your friends, and that you want to be knowledgeable when it come to STD's so you will be able to protect yourself.  |`|RjUhISEIaa	Kassandra you're in a difficult position. Your folks apparently are not ready to discuss this yet and it has nothing to do with your age. It's them that needs to figure out what they are going to say and how. Your inquisitiveness is making this that much more difficult for them and that's not a bad thing either.<br>  <br>  The key though is you posted your note here using the greatest resource for anything you want to know...the internet. Use it to broaden your horizon and use it as a "parental standin." <br>  <br>  The link below is a great place to start asking your questions. Good luck!|`|7p8ktV0Eaa	Go to a school nurse, or maybe another relative and explain that your parents are  not being too responsible. 15 is a little late to suddenly learn about the facts of life. You need to know that although the world says differently, it's something that belongs in marriage, not on the street. Sex needs to happen between two married people, a man and woman. But TV, and radio, magazines, and songs talk about it as if everyone was doing it, and will put alot of pressure on you to act the same way. You need to know that growing up requires responsibility.  Anybody can act "sexy". It doesn't really require alot of brains. But only someone mature can be responsible.  Your goal should be to be a responsible young woman who is not pressured to do the wrong thing, but to be responsible and mature. Believe me, there is no big rush though the "crowd" will tell you the opposite. |`|bi5pTOohaa	It sounds like they really don't know what to say.  Have a good sit down with them and let them know that if they don't tell you about sex, you have a good chance of picking up bad information from others (TV, things you hear, friends, etc) and it's better you get the facts straight from them.  <br>  <br>  You might also just ask mom to recommend a good book that you can read.  Having another source might be easier to start the conversation off with.  |`|hOCzuTvFaa	It sounds like your parents just are not ready to confront sex and all it involves with you. That's really not fair to you, but there are lots of resources specifically aimed at helping teens educate themselves. Have a look at the planned parenthood website, the best source online for information specifically geared for you! <a href="http://www.teenwire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenwire.com/</a><br>  It should be able to give you just about all the information you want, and it even has a section where you can ask questions and get accurate answers!<br>  <br>  This link is how parents can talk to their teenagers about sex, might be good to print out the article and give it to your parents.<br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/parents/how-talk-your-child-about-sex-4422.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a>

EdnpUcilaa	Well, it appears as if your parents have to accept that racism is not a tolerable thing no matter where it comes into play. I will assume you reside in America. It is morally reprehensible to have a bias based only on ethnicity or origin. You need to tell your parents that in a free society they are staunchly overstepping their bounds if they are teaching a racist quality or ideology. It must be presented in a respectful and well thought out manner though, or they may see it as angst or rebellion. You need to show them the good qualities the relationship and how they have a potential to produce in both short and long term results. Also, if this is a cultural issue (i.e., parents hold old world Chinese values), you may want to remind them that you're in the melting pot of America, and one of the reasons we have our current president elect is two people stepping outside of their own as well as society's cultural boundaries. The best resolution for a dilemma such as yours is information and patience.|`|3AKHk6vUaa	don't worry mine disapprove of mine as well, but they are not the one dating him its your life, your going to marry who love later on in life no who they love, & race shouldn't matter he as well is just another person just a different appearance|`|ZgIuyBszaa	Like Confucius used to say,<br>  <br>  If the curry is good,<br>  there will be peace.<br>  <br>  check out this indian thriller music video though. it will give you insight.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbvP7dT3Dx0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbvP7dT3D...</a>|`|xApi5Zdcaa	well your parents are idiots in my case<br>  they should not judge people by the cover<br>  it doesn't matter of what race he is.if you happy being with him and he treats you right then your parent should be happy too<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|P3wLV9qhaa	i think ur family should be happy 4 u as long as ur happy...tell them how u feel...do wat ur heart say 4get ur mum and dad...as long as ur happy..hope this helps....|`|HL4M8UTSaa	omg.
