20090219224740AAxKGva	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	I heal from injuries at an incredible rate.. why?	I'm 24 years old, and have suffered from a broken leg and a broken collar bone, although I healed from both injuries vastly faster than most people would. I can't remember exactly what the doctor told me, but he basically said my healing factor is 3 fold of that of an average person. He explained it to me in great detail, but it really went right over my head. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this?      If I sprain an ankle, it'll feel normally in hours. I never bruise at all, and when I get cut, it heals and scabs over in a matter of hours

Suppose that this pea is able to propagate itself over three generations (but not counting the initial pea). Looking at just one pair of alleles (any pair), and assuming that each pea plant of each generation produces four successful offspring, how do the genotype ratios change over time? Is evolution occurring?  Hint: The Hardy-Weinberg model is not appropriate in this case.

20090219233619AAdO4yf	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	For people who can provide technical info on water meters or who work for the water people, esp in N z?	I live on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand & a few months ago we had our water meters & water system upgraded in our area.  This means we got a whole new water meter.  I just got my annual water bill & it's tripled!  It says I'm using a large amount of water for a 3 person household.  But I am only a one person household & the past bills said I was using a normal amount of water for a one person household.  Not only that, but I've just been overseas for 3 months & for the last year I've mostly had showers at the gym, whereas prior to that I didn't belong to a gym so had them at home.  I can't have a leak as I just checked the meter (& the meter no. - yes they have read the correct one) & it's not ticking over as it would be if there was a leak.  My hot water cyclinder is fine as I checked the overflow pipe & there's nothing leaking out of it.  Sounds to me like something went wrong when they installed the meter & maybe they put the meter reading device forward or something or maybe they ran alot of water from my property at the time of installation or something?  No doubt the Water company will not take responsibility.  If you are a water expert or work in that industry, what do you think?

20090220002831AA3HCd6	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Why do I keep getting shocked?	Just over two months ago, I fell asleep for 12 hours after I was sick and when I woke up, things started to change.   When I flipped the light switch on, I was shocked by sparks (not to mention that I had lost most sense of time perception). Ever since that day, I have been getting shocked AT LEAST 20-25 times a day (I actually lose count after that) and it can sometimes be quite painful.      Thus far, my teachers and professors have made theories as to why I am like this:      1.    Explanation: Too many salts/electrolytes in my body   Proposed by: A physics teacher and professor who has authored several books.   Counter argument: I mostly drink water (~95+% of all liquids I drink) and I consume hardly any salt (except what is needed for the body)      2.   Explanation: The clothes you wear.   Proposed by: Physics teachers/professors, electromagnetic science teacher, and my father.   Counter argument: I haven't changed the types of fabrics of the clothes I wear in a long time. Also, I've used static guard for the past month (nothing has changed though) and I've always used dryer sheets.      3.   Explanation: Dragging of my feet.   Proposed by: Same as above.   Counter argument: I don't drag my feet when I walk.      4.   Explanation: Computer radiation and energy efficient light bulbs with mercury that may emit radiation.   Proposed by: Same as the prior questions.   Counter argument: I tried a Geiger counter to measure radiation around me on a low scale and just the average radiations was detected (only a few clicks). Also, not everyone who uses a computer in their room or has energy efficient bulbs gets shocked 20-25 times a day.      4.    Explanation: It's the humidity.   Proposed by: Same as the other questions.   Counter argument: The humidity hasn't been the same every day for the past two months. We've had very dry weeks, normal weeks, and very humid weeks and the shocks haven't changed.      5.   Explanation: It's your hair when electrons from the air hit it.   Proposed by: Same as above.   Counter argument: My hair has been like this for well over two months (in size) and people with a lot more hair than me don't easily get shocked.   6.   Explanation: You were born that way as each person has various levels of conductivity.   Proposed by: Same as with the first explanation.   Counter argument: Then why was the change an overnight change rather than a development over time?      7.    Explanation: You have a shocking personality to go along with it.   Proposed by: My physics teacher.   Counter argument: Ha Ha, I'm ROTFLMAO (he's into those acronyms).      8.    Explanation: You have become a carrier of electrons   Proposed by: The teacher/ professors ad my father.   Counter argument: Yet shouldn't the energy become grounded for a good while after I touch something made of metal?      A few more facts:   -I've been shocked by paper, a wooden table, rubber materials, and plastics.   -I've touched people, shocked them, and made their hair rise up.   -A conductivity measurer went berserk on me while it hardly lit up with others.   -I lit up a gas stove by touching the metal part where the flames are emitted after turning on the gas.   -I was able to recharge by phones battery 2/3 by holding it for about half an hour.      There's a lot more and as things come up, I'll give more details.      I'll appreciate any good explanations and I will select a best answer in a few days.   -When I touch something, even if it doesn't shock me, I can FEEL the electrical current that surrounds it even if it is protected by an insulator and even with the air or water.   -Also, the fact that almost everything I drink is water helps dissolve the few salts in my system and hence preventing shocks from occurring because of them.

But I can't figure out the second bit where the answer is :       G(1) = 0 and G'(x) = f(1) > 0.

You have the opportunity to play a game based on Microsoft stock with the following  rules.  Today, the value of the stock is $40.  In this game, over the next year, the stock will either move up by $5 with probability 70% or will move down $5 with probability of 30%. If at the end of the year, Microsoft's stock is $45 then you get a dollar.  If the value of the stock is worth $35 then you get nothing.  During this one year period, you can borrow money at 6% interest and lend money at 6% interest.  Both of these interest rates are compounded continuously and are risk free.  How much should you pay to play this game??      I've never seen a problem like this and it almost seems like a trick question, or there isn't enough information or something.

For all the questions so far the data has added up to a number below 360, for example 10, 9, 15 and 6 add up to 40, so to find the correct angle for the pie chart you divide 360 by 40 to get 9 and then multiply each bit of data by 9 so you end up with the angles 90, 81, 135 and 54.      My question is this: how do I work out the angle if the total of the data is over 360? If it is 540, for example...      I'm not asking you to finish the question for me, I'd just like to know how to do it so I can finally pass my exam :P Thanks very much.

A lead ball, with an initial temperature of 25°C is released from a height of 125.0 m. It does not bounce when it hits a hard surface. Assume all the energy of the fall goes into heating the lead. Find the temperature of the ball after it hits. Data: c of lead = 128 J/(kg·°C). (Give your answer in Kelvin i.e., K.)       Any ideas??

Okay, so I know that Newton's 3rd law states that for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force. With a hovercraft, how does it apply?        The air exerts force on the floor, and.....the returning air exerts the same force on the base of the hovercraft? I think that is right, but i'm not really sure...      Is that right? If not, what is?
