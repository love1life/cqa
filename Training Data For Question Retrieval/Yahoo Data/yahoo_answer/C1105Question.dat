I don’t put my hair in a ponytail or dye it. I’m not taking any medication. I haven’t had my menstrual cycle in 1.5 months.  They say the normal amount to come out is 50-100 so I’m getting really scared. What should I do?

I've recently come across several people who have suggested me persuing a modeling career and after watching and reading things about photoshoots, runways, and extreme tallness i'd like to. But for me (13) the whole thing just sounds fun, but not what I'd consider "serious"      I swim, and like my junk-food which results in a generally muscular figure. I'm 130 lbs and am about 5'9'' tall (almost 5'10''). However I'm having mixed feelings about even thinking of attempting this.      So, coming back to my initial question.

I'm going to order a Sailor hat from eBay quite soon, but I'm unsure on how to make my outfit pop. Does anybody have any ideas on jewelery and accessories I could wear with it? Or any places I could purchase some nautical items for my outfit? I'm not going to stick to what I've said completely, but I've just gathered them together for the basis of my outfit. I'm looking for inspiration and creative ideas as everyone is going in the same theme, and I'd like to look a cut above the rest.      Thanks in advance! xxx
