NSKimt1Qaa	I'm not really sure.  The only one I know for sure is Eclair.  The Black&Whites I've heard of, but don't know whether they're called Half-Moons or something else here. I don't even know what a Headlight donut is.  We have Bismarcks (jelly donuts), Persian or Pershing, Cream Puffs or Creme Puffs,  Napoleons, and Fritters (sometimes called Bear Paws or Bear Claws), to name a few.  Geez, now I'm hungry!|`|USooqQlWaa	Wow - I've never even heard of these names (just the Eclair I know of)...we have no culture here in the SW - at least when it comes to donuts apparently.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Ok, I worked in a donut shop while I was in high school (yes, I'm serious), and the only one of those names I am familiar with is the Eclair.  What the heck kind of donuts have YOU been eating!  LMAO|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Shucky dern, sonny here in tha South weunzes jest callum pastries.
SzBlX4Vpaa	i'd go to St Christopher's place opposite bond st tube. there are several restaurants in the square, and also some down the side street - there is a Carluccio's in the square but it was closed when I was there last a couple of weekes ago.<br>  <br>  www.toptable.co.uk is a great site for good deals and you can search by cuisine, location and special deals<br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|CJdsTmZRaa	yup|`|lyCXVyUqaa	Lol<br>  There is no restaurants next to prada gucci and all the expensive shops <br>    <br>  Please correct me if I am mistaken
hkwBR1moaa	Friday March 27th 11am!  <br>  I'm just upset that it's a Friday.  I can't eat meat right now on Friday.  I will there with bells on on Saturday!|`|W76VDFKCaa	I heard they were coming back but I don't know where exactly.  I heard it was off of Airline somewhere.  Please let me know.|`|AA10784062	You know as much as the rest of us do.  This is a topic of much conversation on the local forums.  No one knows the exact date yet.  The most recent info we have is from a worker there who said they would be open in '2 to 3 weeks', which puts it at the end of the month, like you said.  I'm sure there will be a line around the block waiting.  I miss the sopapillas.|`|Ervi8nZTaa	My boyfriend loves panchos!

u4liwDhAaa	Denny's.  Has some pretty good tasting items on their menu.  And, it's fun for a change when your on a road trip!  What's a road trip without Denny's?  LOL  <br>  <br>  Have never been to Wimpy's or Embers.|`|JWk1lKJgaa	Denny's of course<br>  I like the choices, food is always good, friendly service<br>  I really like the superbird and the moons over my hammy|`|85vDqn6naa	Well i have only been to Denny's, i don't believe we have the other 2 in the Metro area. They have good breakfast though! Are the other 2 a spin off of Denny's?|`|r7W0HqbVaa	Denny's. It brings back memories of me and my Grandparents coming to town and taking us there. They have great food for a great price, and what's not to love with breakfast 24/7|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Denny's, you can get anything you want anytime.|`|sytw0BFBaa	dennys is good, i never even heard about the other ones.|`|T3tRfZpqaa	i love embers ---remember the embers|`|OmsYxRDDaa	Denny's|`|46ACIGiHaa	Wimpys and a trip to the local pub afterward
RQc8fbjbaa	Ruby Tuesdays for me. Applebees do not have anything for a vegetarian.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I have never been to Ruby Tuesdays.  So, we will go with Applebee's.  Their menu seems to cater to almost any taste.  And, people always leave with happy faces!  LOL<br>  <br>  Eich :+)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Ruby Tuesday for sure. Plus, their food is of slightly higher quality|`|n2GzyCm2aa	Ruby Tuesdays,they have great steaks,and a great salad bar.|`|xUWejoiQaa	Ruby Tuesdays is not the best place in the world.  I would choose Applebees :).  Ruby Tuesdays doesn't have much of a selection on the menu and they food tastes so-so.  Applebees has variety and their food tastes great! Here's their menu:|`|zjlCy0hwaa	I'll have to say RUBY'S. The atmosphere is better, food is better, and their drinks are not too shabby. If your looking for food for just the guys then I would say APPLEBEES. It's almost like hanging out at TGI Fridays.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	I've never been to Ruby Tuesdays but damn do i love Applebees and it's not expensive!|`|KzWbLvbiaa	I prefer RTs because they AT LEAST have a Happy Hour! And on the food side....a great salad bar!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Mmm...I love them both! If I want something like steak Ruby Tuesdays. If I want drinks and appy's Applebees. If you are looking purely at selection in terms of number of items on the menu, Applebees has more. However, I think that Ruby Tuesdays has better food.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Better selections at Applebee's.  I was recently to a Ruby Tuesday's for my first time, and was not impressed with the quality of the food.  It was okay, but nothing special.<br>  <br>  But then, I had a hamburger.  Maybe their steaks are better.  They do have a good salad bar.

XUuDxlzaaa	Maybe you could go ice-skating/bowling/cinema where you could have fun. Then just go around for a while, and then go back to your house for eat?<br>  <br>  Will your dad be able to get some food in, like what I like to call "Munches". This can be some chicken nuggets, salad, chicken pieces, mini-pizza's etc. for your dinner. For later on in the night you could ask your dad/use your pocket money to buy some sweets, crisps and all that.|`|zkNAGX02aa	i agree with the first answer, plus, you dont have to eat from outside. why dont u go out for bowling/ice skating then come bc home 2 eat<br>  you can tell ur fam 2 have the food ready n stuff<br>  it will be much cheaper<br>  lol|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	It's your birthday-your friends should be paying for you.|`|CJdsTmZRaa	frnds should gift u|`|XXnMgwxYaa	i agree with her ^<br>  your family won't give you money for your birthday :O<br>  ask your friends if instead of presents they will all contribute to the meal. and use whatever money you do have if there isn't enouugh money to pay for dinner.<br>  go somewhere cheap! even if it has to be mcdonalds or somewhere.<br>  or go to taybarns if they have that where you live, its ￡6.99 per person for all you can eat so your friends will be able to pay that and then all you have to pay for is yourself|`|YoNMn90Maa	Do you have any dollar per slice pizza near to you?|`|zjFMdPOiaa	After skating, invite all your friends back to your house for a pot-luck.  Ask everyone that is coming to bring a dish of something to share.  That way, you can continue your party, and everyone else will be contributing and enjoying your birthday, too.<br>  Happy Birthday and whatever you decide have a FUN party.|`|t5xnbgKkaa	If you can eat at home then you could go to a supermarket and buy a stack of their cheapest frozen pizzas, the ones with just tomato and cheese on them, then get some other things..mushrooms, a sweet pepper, half a pound of salami ( Danish tends to be the cheapest ),a couple of onions and a block of cheese..sweetcorn, tinned tuna, fresh garlic, some ham or lean bacon..there are lots of things to chose from. Whatever you buy, slice it up finely and let your friends make their own pizzas when you get back from wherever you go. Cans of soft drinks are usually cheaper at a supermarket than anywhere else as well, also mixed crisps or other potato snacks. You will have more fun doing this than going to a cafe and worrying about the price of things.<br>  If you can not eat at home then KFC is probably your best option..they have offers on the larger buckets, you can eat in and you know what things are going to cost..look them up on the web' there are often promotions and even printable coupons.

9Qf4khqLaa	Theyre gross now. I don't go there anymore because of that!|`|JwuEZCwzaa	I have to disagree. I prefer the new fries to the old. The previous fries were typically soggy in texture I felt. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a soggy frie but I felt that they were overly soggy and lacked flavor. They actually had a tendency to absorb the flavor of the container they're presented in which isn't very tasty. Carl's Jr french fries 2.0 on the other hand have a better texture and density.|`|J4CMYwACaa	I wouldn't be worried about THEIR fries, you should worry more about your children and THEIR education. Also you need to do some praying.Bye.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Change their fries?

EfOQSYZEaa	It can be.<br>  <br>  Of course if youre picking white bread and fatty dressing and bacon, and such things, it can be unhealthy.<br>  <br>  But if you get say a whole wheat sub with a ton of veggies, some ham, and say some low-fat-italian (the BEST dressing ---- even when im not trying to eat healthy!!) dressing, sure! It's healthy!|`|bYrGGOynaa	It really just depends on what you get there. If you get double roast beef and three kinds of cheese and extra mayo, of course not. But if you get a lot of veggies and olive oil and vinegar or italian dressing instead of mayo, then of course it is. But It's much cheaper to just go grocery shopping once a week (it really doesn't take that long) and make your own sandwiches (it's really not that hard). They'll honestly probably taste better.|`|4WXdPs6kaa	Much healthier then Mcdonalds or burgar king are,<br>  as long as you choose the healthier subs that they have there turkey breast, chicken breast etc. and there wheat bread is really good to (not to grainy)|`|dqDCIZkGaa	It can be depending on what you order. If you but veggies on your sandwich and not load it with dressing like ranch than yes it is.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	It could be, it depends on what you get|`|f9sL3WgQaa	If you do it right..yes it can be.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Not.  Those processed meats are like eating a plate full of radioactive material covered in bio-hazard waste.|`|0821af06fe4e702880d804a9e2cc13e0aa	their meat is absolute crap and 100% processed that can lead to several different kinds of cancers and heart ailments.

We ended up taking it off the menu completely because no one seemed to have much interest, sadly enough.|`|OmsYxRDDaa	I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!!!!  I usually make it at home too.|`|gaXUIduMaa	Yes but here is a solution.  If you have a favorite ingredients, ask them to add it.  If they have the ingredients, like from a different dish, there is a 99% chance that they will make it for you.  On some ingredients, like adding chicken, etc, do not be surprised if they add a charge but if it is something like using alfredo sauce instead of marinara, it is usually at no extra charge.<br>  Myself, I like pesto sauce although some places do not stock it.|`|JWk1lKJgaa	yes it really drops me to the floor<br>  that's why I usually fix it at home were I control the ingredients

I haven't been in this one but I liked the one I was in several years ago.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	There are of course a ton of food places you can eat at in Covina! It just depends on the type of food that you like and what type of restaurants you are lookin for. If  you are thinking sushi which I would suggest being that you are in Cali try Sushi Time off of Arrow Hwy or you can go to a place that has a buffet like HAwaii Buffet for somehting a little different : >|`|AA10975447	It's not fancy, but there's a great Mongolian BBQ place in West Covina just north of the 10 on Grand. It's $10 all you can eat for dinner. You can eat plate after plate of stir fry for a bargain. Great if you're going as a group.<br>  <br>  Emperor Mongolian BBQ<br>  138 N Grand Ave<br>  West Covina, CA 91791<br>  (626) 332-2869?<br>  <br>  Yelp says: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperor-mongolian-bbq-west-covina" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperor-mongolia...</a>|`|PDij52sLaa	drive off the 10 to citrus ave.......... there are about 10 restaurants there
a2d9HhaUaa	Downtown Culver City has got a lot of good restaurants opening up. You might wanna go down there a few nights and hang out, but other than that you aren't that far away from Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney, Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey.<br>  <br>  Marina Del Rey is great for warm weekends to do some bike riding and be outside. Santa Monica has some great bars, shopping, and Food down the promenade. There are some great bars down Abbot Kinney, and some really great nightclubs and bars down Main St. near Venice Beach. I live in Mar Vista and work in Culver City so trust me there is alwasy stuff do around here.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	There are a few places in Culver City that you can go to. i would suggest going to Los Angeles if you really want a lot to do but a place you can check out are El Baron Nighclub if you like dancing or look into an online yellow pages for other places that are near you  might like : >|`|A9WCbC8aaa	You are also very close to Marina Del Rey.  Beautiful city on the water that has many restaurants.  If you want an upbeat people watching place go to Santa Monica 3rd street promenade|`|bPDQUYU9aa	Santa Monica is fun! 3rd street promenade, beach, farmers markets. Main street and abbot kinney in venice are cool for shopping|`|AA12066269	You are really close to Westwood.  The night life on Westwood Blvd, is fun.  Fox Studios is nearby, they do tours,  Santa Monica isn't too far away.  The pier is fun.  There are some good restaurants nearby and shopping at The Grove or Beverly Center.|`|gaXUIduMaa	In downtown Culver City there is the Kirk Douglas theater which is run by the premier theater group in the area, Center Theater Group (includes the Ahmanson and Mark Taper theaters).  They run some of the newer, lesser known plays there.  Because the plays are lesser known, the admission is often cheaper than what you might expect.
OUcQjqI0aa	comedy might not be a bad idea, since the comedy zone moved out to matthews years ago and uptown is a very humorless place.
c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	it doesn't come from mexico they have laws here in the states and that is were th beef comes from the us its 100 percent beef which is any part of the cow but its the same when you go to the store and buy it there|`|BGPG2FaFaa	IDK BUT I CAN TELL U WHITE CHIKEN IS IN DA MEAT|`|4xOXiZcNaa	There is a lot I don't like about McDonalds but they have the best meet they can buy to supply to their outlets.. it's not rat or dog or soy.. it's 100 PERCENT MEAT U.S.D.A. CHOICE, meat... because that is the LEAST AMOUNT OF SHRINKAGE..|`|DqUf3LM8aa	It is 100% beef, but "beef" legally means any part of the cow.
A9WCbC8aaa	I use www.CitySearch.com when I travel to places I don't know.  They review restaurants and you can search by cuisine.  The other place is Zagats.com|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Oh I would definitely use an online yellow pages like dexknows.com. It is really helpful because you can find restaurants in the are you are looking for and the type of food. Not only that you can find places with a certain atmosphere, features like having live music, and more. You should check it out : >
WT0dGgoMaa	They are tightwads when it comes to staffing.<br>  Having a second register open would entail paying two operators. And then if you have 2 inside registers, you'd need another sandwichperson and grillperson to keep up with the faster flow of customers at the counter. So it wouldn't be just hiring/paying one more person, it'd be probably paying 3 more employees per hour.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of Wendy's stores are old, and poorly designed and don't allow room for many renovations like McDonald's does.|`|yYNkP8NBaa	They can't fill both the drive thru and inside orders fast enough to warrant opening another register,  sad but true. :-(|`|AA11765580	I haven't been there in a long time but you're right, that doesn't seem logical.  They should have at least 2 registers to keep the line moving.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	they have to have enough employees to fill the "downstairs" and "upstairs".  the downstairs is employees making food for the in restaurant people and the upstairs is people making food for the drive thru customers.  plus they have to have at least 1 person on drive thru taking orders and being a cashier (sometimes two depending on the restaurant).  that usually only leaves one other person to be the cashier for the inside.  so depending on the size of the Wendy's and the amount of employees working on any given shift, this is normal.
