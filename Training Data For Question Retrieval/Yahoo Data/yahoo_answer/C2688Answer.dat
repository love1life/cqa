4yt4D3vMaa	She needs checked by a vet I'm afraid-rabbits don't lose weight for no reason. She will need her teeth checked for sharp edges and spurs and also if she isn't neutered checked for uterine tumours. Oxbow Critical care food is good for rabbits needing built up but it involves syringe feeding and it's expensive so it depends how thin she is. if it's something treatable like her teeth then she should put the weight back on once it's treated-alfalfa, quality pellets and small amounts of oats should be enough.<br>  Edit: I meant to say cows milk is not good for rabbits as their bodies are not designed to digest it so it could cause digestive problems.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	well try anything except meat, try lots of veggies and anything specially nuts.|`|XI2iylR4aa	It would be a really good idea to bring her to the vet.  Weight loss is a bad sign in rabbits.  It could be something simple, like her daughters eating all of the food before she can get to it.  Or it could be something much worse, like a kidney problem, or uterine cancer.<br>  <br>  Only a vet can tell you for sure.  Good luck, I hope she's ok.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	I agree that her daughters may be keeping her from the food. have you watched her eat? You may have to separate her from the others, until you figure out what is going on.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Her daughters could be taking her food from her. <br>  <br>  She could also have the sniffles or something. <br>  <br>  I think you should seperate her.

e2YQWIFSaa	Well, I would think it is an allergic reaction.  I never understood really why it goes for the paws, but my last dog had reoccurring paw infections.  Finally the vet said it may be a food allergy, also it tends to dry out the skin, so if there is a lot of flaking& itching then its most like an allergic reaction to food OR shampoo.  I would try feeding  him one kind for 3-4 weeks, and then switch and figure out what it is...but if the infection gets worse then he will need some antibiotics from the vet.  And if switching the foods shows no improvements, then try switching shampoos to something more gentle.   Good luck with it all!|`|16XpYCBmaa	You shouldn't give your dog soo many different brands of food that is what is prolly making him that way. You should only feed him one kind of food and stick with it. Give him which ever food he likes best.

My dog is allergic to all grains. I usually fix his food but sometimes feed Solid Gold Barking at the Moon. It has fish and beef which my dog can eat.It is going to take 2 weeks or longer to see results. If he allergic to a certain protein source, you may have to go to a elimination diet. In canned there are good ones like Natural Balance. Get some prednisone from the vet to help clear up the itch, but remember this is just a temp fix. You need to change his food.|`|FhVobWpeaa	the most common food allergy is to corn, grains, soya, try feeding him one food with limited ingredients for a couple of weeks and build on  it.|`|o0CSibEnaa	its not really a good idea to change food like that for dogs, its upsets them, and could be causing a reaction. if you really want to have a mix of food types mix them all in the same bowl so they are used to the foods and getting them all the time. but personally i would recommend sticking to one food.|`|a29qiNkvaa	It can and will take at least a month on a food before you will notice any difference! you need to find one food and stick with it for at least a month! here is where would start <br>  <br>  Taste of the wild pacific stream<br>  solid gold barking at the moon <br>  what evo did you try the beef or chicken? <br>  you have to pick one thing and stay with unless there are hives involved!|`|oiBGMHcBaa	You should'nt mix the food like that because he might be allergic to one that you give him to.

Some of them are not good for the dog, and some dogs end up eating more than if i were regular dog food. <br>  <br>  And why not quit free feeding?

bDPVRtCNaa	Yes you may. I did and it turned out great.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	First, you'll need a test kit. Add some ammonia. Start small, only a couple of teaspoons for a small tank around 40 liters (10G), or use about a 1/2 cup for large tanks around 200 liters. Let it sit for an hour or so to allow the ammonia to circulate. Test. Your goal is to get a reading of about 3 to 5 mg/L (or ppm, it's the same). If you have zero ammonia readings, add a bit more to the water. Not too much...you are using a toxic chemical after all. Let the tank sit. Test. Keep testing and adding SMALL amounts of ammonia until you get a reading in your test kit. When you have a reading, you may want to add Cycle (which introduces beneficial bacteria) if you've decided to use these products. Keep in mind that the commercial bacteria is bottled in a non-toxic form of ammonia, so if you use them, your ammonia readings will be higher than if you hadn't used them. This is OK. You may discover your ammonia levels will go over 6 ppm (parts per million), which is fatal for all fish, but this is OK too, since you don't have any fish in the tank.<br>  <br>  As soon as you notice high levels of ammonia, stop adding ammonia to the tank. Now is the part where your patience is tested! Let things run their course, and keep testing the water. Once a day is fine, or once every other day. After a few days, you can begin testing for nitrites as well as ammonia. If you aren't getting any readings for nitrites at all, that's OK. These things take time. Don't do any water changes yet, and continue to let everything sit. When your ammonia starts dropping, you should definitely be able to read some nitrites. After the ammonia reading drops to zero, start adding just a little bit more ammonia again every day, just a teaspoon or so...not enough to force the reading above zero again, but just enough to keep the newly grown "ammonia-eating" bacterial colony happy.<br>  <br>  When you notice your nitrites are spiking (reach a maximum and start going down) you'll know you're almost done! In my experience, the tanks have finished cycling within 3 or 4 days of the nitrite spike, but the amount of time will vary for everyone. When your nitrites drop to zero AND your ammonia is zero, then your tank is cycled! Do a large water change, around 50% to 80%. Do not change any filter media, and do not vacuum the gravel during this water change. Refill with fresh, conditioned water, and lower your heater to 25°C or whatever temperature is best for the fish you intend to keep. Let everything chug for several hours or overnight. Test the water for both ammonia and nitrites again. If everything is still zero, the tank is cycled and you're ready to add fish! <br>  Good Luck!<br>  See this site for more:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles/misc/fishlesscycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles...</a>|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	I have more aquariums than I can say at the moment but when I want to cycle a tank without fish . I get a couple of cups of gravel from a tank that is a year or two old and dump that in. It has always worked for me. Then wait 2 or 3 days then add your fish.
3giaPYe8aa	Did you get a really short crop?  Even with a really ugly short crop the ears will have to be posted again.  Is the Vet/tech going to be doing the posting?  Here's the deal:  When the ears flop, they need to get posted.  My guess is that they will be flopping before the end of the night.  DO NOT let the ears flop for more than 24 hours.  They must be posted again, and keep being posted for several more months.  If the crop is really short, and the ear cartilage is thick, it might not take as long as an elegant show crop.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No.  They often need months of taping. I know of none that stood after once. If you want, you can check out this method instead but verify with your vet before trying.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://moonstruckbxr.tripod.com/Information/Ear_Tape.html" rel="nofollow">http://moonstruckbxr.tripod.com/Informat...</a><br>  <br>  You still have a long road ahead so patience is key.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	No!!! Keep taping them, they will fall if you don't.....trust me on this. They usually seem to be standing fine between tapings but they will fall very soon without support. You have to keep taping until the cartilage has hardened in the upright position.<br>  <br>  Edit: Trust me, just because they seem to be standing fine, it's a mistake to not re-post them. They will fall and you will be losing valuable time. Keeping them posted these first few weeks to months is crucial. Don't leave them unposted. <br>  A crop job that isn't maintained properly at first ends up being really goofy looking. Don't put your dog through the surgery only to neglect taping it.
32ubwZjtaa	Maybe if the dog is shedding a lot, the fur can get EVERYWHERE and make you cough.  Get a brush for the dog and brush it daily. Good luck.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	That, and worse.|`|a66MIgGgaa	YES. Kennel cough in humans is simply an upper respitory infection. Bacteria spread from your dog to you after your dog has been exposed to a situation with many other animals ... lowered immune system causes this. We normally don’t call an upper respiratory infection in people “kennel cough,” but regardless of what you call it you will want to protect yourself from the invading virus/bacteria.<br>  <br>  Protect your puppy with shots and a good diet to strengthen his immune and in turn protect yourself|`|XgdJ9vaGaa	Well it might be an Allergy!

EJpiaCMQaa	You can encourage your lineolated parakeets to breed by providing them with 12 hours of daylight per day.  Also, the birds will start calling at each other and become more active.  Vitamins are important to give your birds at this time to keep them in peak breeding condition.  Keep some cuttlebone for calcium close by.  Get the birds a good nest box in the upper right hand corner of the cage.  This way it's easy to slide out for inspection.  Usually, lineolated parakeets are easy to breed.|`|ixOE0onnaa	i think they are that kind.|`|DJa2wS86aa	they will start preening each other ,feeding each other,flirting with each other,he might get protective of her ,she will protect the box,you will know more bygoing to the birdchannel.com for More info

By practicing your 2 point on the flat, and practicing sittin gup in your jumping possion at the trot, walk, or canter, and fix your back to a comfortable possion where it does not arch as much.

My trainer taught me to sit up right into the jump, then fold ever so slightly over the jump (small jumps). Pretty much I find it best to sit up all the way into the jump and then soften the hands over the jump. The folding should be quite natural, not forced. I suppose practice makes perfect. I'm not a pro though but this is just my advice and what I learned.
x0vMl42jaa	Well, the Shar-pei was traditionally bred as a fighting dog- their 'wrinkles' are folds on their skin, combined with prickly fur, bred specifically so if another dog would have trouble latching on to shake: <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/sharpei.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/sharpei.htm</a><br>  <br>  These days I think most fighting dogs are pit bulls- supposedly they can lock their jaw and hold on, although I don't know if that's true or just hype.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think dog fighting is pretty nasty, but there is a long tradition going back thousands of years.

Ym6PCJRYaa	1. I would think male (I have owned female rabbits of ALL kinds and they are ALWAYS soooooooooo tempermental).. biting, hated to be picked up or loved on- but the boys sooooooo sweet every single one<br>  I have owned like 10 bunnies! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  2. You cant take them to just any vet... you dont have to have them fixed. They dont act differently to have them fixed. I never fixed any of mine.. and they acted fine (the BOYS anyways)... but just call your local vets and ask<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Probably not<br>  <br>  <br>  4. I bought ALL of mine at different times.. none of them cost me more then 25 dollars... however, depending on what kind of cage you get (do NOT get any plastic- they like to chew and will destroy it)... you can get one for probably 100 dollars.. but it will be small... Pet supply places that arent big names- such as petsmart- but places like Atwoods or just a family owned place have REALLY cheap cages. I got a 5 tier cage for cats for just 169.00 dollars which is a REALLY good price!! Considering the 3 foot by 3 foot rabbit cages I had got in the past were 100-150!<br>  <br>  <br>  5.

In most animals people say the male is the one that is more territorial but I have known rabbits all my life and I personally think the females are little more mean. So I guess im going to answer this question by saying males are friendlier. <br>  <br>  2. does they need to get fixed?<br>  Its not a requirement, if you had a few that all lived together than yes. I breed rabbits so mine are not. <br>  <br>  3. do most pet stores already have them fixed?<br>  No. But you could try an animal shelter. <br>  <br>  4. Around how much would one cost from a pet store in ny? how much would a cage and everything cost seperatly?<br>  Well I know pet stores that sell them for like $60.00 when they are buying them from a breed for about $5. If I were you I would look for a holland lop breeder in NY or go to a rabbit show. Most breeders will sell for like $10.00 for a good quality pet.

You can get away with a smaller one with it being a holland lop. <br>  <br>  5. whats your favorite color =D<br>  Well I don't breed lops, we have an english lop as a pet but thats it. I like the black ones though. <br>  <br>  6. How long do they live for?<br>  On average rabbits live 5-7 years. Some longer. <br>  <br>  7.my moms worried about the smell, do they smell that bad?<br>  Not if you clean the cage out every week. And just one isn't going to smell that bad. You could litterbox train it (they make the tiny litter boxes for cages) and that way you could just clean that out every few days. <br>  <br>  If you would like info about the breed (when you get time) <a href="http://www.arba.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.arba.net</a> & <a href="http://www.hlrsc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hlrsc.com/</a>|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Find a humane society that adopts rabbits.  We adopt them for $35 and they have been fixed.  You will get a much better "education" about their dietary and housing needs from the shelter staff than you will ever get from a pet store.  Pet stores do not spay or neuter what they "sell".  It's around $250 here to fix a bunny through a vet office though the humane society does run "specials" for people who bring their bunnies in because WE DO NOT WANT MORE RABBITS!<br>  <br>  Lops don't have the reputation as being the friendliest of bunnies (along with the Dutch) and we have had four lops in the last two months that were EXCEPTIONALLY cuddly and friendly.<br>  <br>  I socialise the bunnies at the humane society three or four times a week and also go to a rescue (Save-A-Bunny) a couple of times a week.  I have never been offended by any smell.  Litterboxes are cleaned daily, along with the whole cage and fresh toweling is put in the cages.<br>  <br>  A house rabbit can live for up to ten years and "fixing" them is important for their longevity (and for their relationships with people).

Most smaller dogs within the sporting group are spaniels. But I'll just go ahead and forewarn you that while some spaniels are small and do very well in apartments, they all bark. And most of them bark a lot. (This is one of the reasons I think size restrictions in apartments are stupid.)<br>  <br>  Ones I can think of in the 30-40 pound range are Brittany Spaniels (bark some), American Water Spaniels (bark some), and Sussex Spaniels (bark a LOT).<br>  <br>  Another option if you really like retrievers is the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (also referred to as "Toller") - they are 35-50 pounds. I don't think they are easy to find, though - and shelters are not going to know what they have, because this is not a common breed. You'd have to look for one through a rescue or go through a lot of work to find one in a shelter, since they're almost guaranteed to be mis-labeled (probably as spaniels, because they look a lot like spaniels).|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	I would suggest no dog.

So that would eliminate the bulldog, any teeny tiny dogs.  You don't mention how much grooming you'd be willing to do, if you just want to deal with a quick brushing and nail clipping or don't mind lots of hair.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest a greyhound, but you don't like the look of them, so I would also assume that you wouldn't like the look of the Whippet either, since they have a similiar body type.<br>  <br>  My other suggestion is be careful about bringing in a pitbull, AmStaff or mix of any of the bully breeds.  Many apartment complexes will no longer allow these breeds.<br>  <br>  First I would suggest visiting your local shelter, if you don't see what you like, go back another time.  You may very well come home with your next best friend.<br>  <br>  My other suggestion is to consider some of the hounds or sporting breeds.  English Spring Spaniels, English Cocker Spaniels (not as much coat and grooming as the American Cocker Spaniel), Brittany Spaniel, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.  Of the hounds, consider the 15 inch beagle, foxhounds.  Of the terriers, though many come in small packages, you want high energy, there's plenty to choose from.  I would also consider either the Standard Poodle or a Minature Poodle (if you don't mind all that grooming)<br>  <br>  I had a beagle/lab mix, best dog ever.  Great in the house, yet always ready for an adventure.  Tons of lab mixes in local shelters.

In captivity, female iguanas obviously have a very hard time finding places to dig.  They will often spend hours searching their area for a good nesting spot, digging at anything they can find.<br>  <br>  Owners need to facilitate this instinct by providing a nesting box of some sort. You can build a box on your own, or a sturdy plastic box (or even a laid-down garbage can) filled with sandbox sand and/or potting soil will often do the trick. Be prepared to clean up a lot of dirt as they spend hours digging it out repeatedly and sling it all over the place.<br>  <br>  Be advised that sometimes females will ignore nesting boxes, or dig in them only to lay their eggs elsewhere, much to their owners' frustration.|`|Eyawiwc5aa	For a GRAVID female you need to get a tote storage bin, about a 30/35 gallon, fill w/ play sand, 50-100lbs, sphagnum moss, and water, stir mix all together if the sand/moss doesnt hold you don't have enough water.<br>  You also need to get a few human heating pads, place on the side and/or top to keep it warm, you want to make sure that the box is in about mid 80s for temp.<br>  For the tote storage bin, cut a whole in the lid so you ig can go in and out.<br>  You will need to make sure that you do have a good water pan set up, if your ig digs threw the sand/moss mixture she will get the water very dirty.<br>  Make sure that you do get an X-Ray before and for sure after she lays.<br>  My girls first breeding season, she had to be spayed, luckily I did she had ruptured eggs.<br>  Make sure that you do provide fresh food after laying eggs, she will most likely be very hungry and want to eat, along w/ providing fresh water.<br>  After all that you do she may or may not accept the nesting box and lay somewhere in the house. Or have problems laying in general, this is where a vet will need to step in.<br>  Make sure even if your female did not mate w/ a male that you freeze or boil the eggs, then toss out for the birds or throw away.

HOWEVER be aware that a horse is not finished until he is at least 4 or 5 years old so don't get your hopes high on riding him. A lot can happen in that time. Also a young horse is a very difficult horse to handle so his energy level and needs may out match your skill easily. Be aware the horse is still growing as well and hard work should not begin until he is 3 years old. I would not plan on riding the horse for a LONG time. I don't know your experience, but I do not allow any of my students under an advanced level (meaning they control horse's in gallops, jump -high varies on discipline of course-, Have excellent seat, soft hands, and proper aids in both seat and leg) to ride any of my younger horses (generally 7 and under I consider young and horses should be finished by 8 completely in the chosen discipline and be starting their careers)<br>  <br>  Again don't get your hopes up. Your gonna ride and come across a ton of horses in your life, you may very well never get on this horse. But is you enjoy the horse's company and caring for him you can still do that (assuming again he is finished with his ground manners) and still have him as one of your favorites.|`|AA10332192	You are well within the weight limits for a horse of that size.  <br>  <br>  Larger folks, especially those over 250 pounds have to be careful what size horse they ride.

Toys you can get are swings, different kind of perches (that's good for their feet), mirrors, rings, bells and many more just look at the shelf with parakeet toys on it. For food you will need seeds (obviously), but you should other food into their cage such as spray millet (a healthy,good treat for all birds), a cuttle bone and some sliced fruits and vegetables. Those extra foods are very healthy for pet birds filled with many vitamins and minerals.

Often, animals will hump one another as a sign of dominance, and your male cat may just have been establishing himself as the alpha in the household. However, it's not impossible for a cat to get pregnant without being in heat (Not common, but not impossible.) so it's hard to tell.<br>  <br>  Take her to a vet and have him check if she is, in fact, spayed. <br>  If she's not spayed, get her fixed immediately. Even if she is currently pregnant, she can still be spayed and the pregnancy terminated. This is much better than having her give birth to kittens that|`|HUIo1fQaaa	It is very hard to determine if a female is spayed unless you know for sure the surgery was done.  It could be that she is not spayed (if that is the case cats are pregnant for 2 months).  Also, because the male is intact, he may have been 'in the mood'.  I would neuter him ASAP either way.|`|jUaSbfhJaa	Well if you had her spayed by a legal vet, then yes she should be fixed.<br>  Your male cat may just be horny, but I'm guessing he has got the message.<br>  If you have any other concerns contact your local vet and check her out again.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	It does not mean that, no. Animals do not only mount each other to mate, they also mount each other as a display of dominance.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend getting your boy kitty fixed. Fixing your male has a lot of benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Neutering males eliminates all chances of testicular cancer as well as having behavioral benefits (reduces the urge to escape and roam in search of a mate, cuts down on aggression, and if done before the animal begins spraying/marking upon reaching sexual maturity, they may well never spray/mark at all!)

tcvQwTa5aa	watch them cats!I have 5 hens and 3 female ducks at the moment all living together in the same coop.We let them out in the morning and they go in when it gets dark(on their own)and we come out and close the door of the coop at dusk.I have 2 grown female cats that don't bother the birds because they've always been around chickens and are just good cats I guess.I have had one in the past that caught and ate a baby chick of ours.I was pissed off of course.I got rid of that cat.We have a 10x5 chicken house.Ducks are very messy!We are going to buy a plastic baby pool for them to play in this summer.We cannot afford to build a pond at the moment but that is a plan for the future,say another year or so.Good luck to you.watch out for dogs.We had both our rooster and our male duck killed by dogs.When they get a taste for it they'll never stop going after them.|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	I saw TONS of ducks and chickens together on a Montana farm. Just happy as can be together- actually rabbits loose too with the ducks and chickens!! It was awsome! For that many, just a large pin. I wouldnt set them "free" in my backyard... although if you dont have dogs it would be great if you have a larger backyard....but they poop ALOT, just make sure you call your local police station and make sure they are legal so you dont have to put them down.|`|MyP97QGIaa	last year i had 3 chicks and 2 ducks living in the same pen, the only time they were apart was at feeding time,I fed them different food for the first 3 months.|`|V7AAba8Laa	First, make sure you live somewhere where you are allowed to have poultry.  They are considered livestock in many areas, and there may be restrictions about what you can (and can't) have.  <br>  <br>  Chickens and ducks both require secure housing at night, and should be kept in separate pens.  For this reason, don't plan on getting just one duck - they are social and need companions of their own kind.  Ducks also splash in their water and make a mess, which is not a good environment for your chickens.<br>  <br>  As chicks or ducklings, they also need to be kept separate.  Ducklings often grow at a quicker rate than chicks and can bully chicks or cause injuries.  Chick and duck brood pens should be kept separate.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, housing requirements are about 3 square feet of living space per heavy breed hen.  This doesn't count the space needed for feeding and watering supplies.  They also need a little extra space during winter months when they don't want to go out in the snow.  They also need pasture or yard space to scratch and forage.<br>  <br>  Because you have cats around, the chicks and ducklings need to be kept in a secure, covered indoor pen until they are at least juvenile size.  Cats can easily hurt or kill a fuzzy chick.  We've never had a problem with the cats around here, but I've had friends with feral cats around that have really done some damage to their chick pens.  Better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  There is alot that you need to learn about feeding and general care before you get chicks and/or ducklings.  I'd recommend getting a copy of Storey's Guides for raising chickens and ducks before you bring them home.  These books have lots of information on caring for your birds.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and please make sure you get your information and your equipment set up before you bring any birds home.  I love raising poultry and ducks, but they do need care to keep them healthy and safe.
px27V5N9aa	It will take time.  Do everything with deliberate movements but not loud and fast.  Just do them as if you are doing your normal routine of the day.  Do not 'sneak' around or you will make it harder on him. <br>  <br>  Talk to him<br>  Show him your back and just stand there, talking.  When he approaches and sniffs, calmly move away.  Show him you won't attack him.<br>  Hold your hand out to him (make a fist and hold hand out, like a horses nose to nose sniff).  If he sniffs, take your hand back.<br>  <br>  Move him to a clean stall when you need to clean his out.  Don't do it when he's in there.  He doesn't trust you or the horse eatin' rake you brought in to kill him with.<br>  <br>  Don't rub him down with anything yet.  He still doesn't trust you and you haven't earned his respect.<br>  <br>  I used to let my guys loose in the aisle (one at a time) when I mucked their stalls if it were too stormy out for them.  <br>  <br>  If you put an arm around his neck and on his nose, he got the feeling of you attacking, or even just touching his back/shoulders.  That will take some lead line exercises later once he learns who you are.<br>  <br>  It took me over 6 months to brush my filly to her withers.  After a year she is now in a saddle and follows me around like a dog.  I yell for her and she comes running.<br>  Time and patience.  If you go slow and wait on his mind first, you will have a great horse later.  Just wait on his mind to unlock.  He's terrified and needs time.<br>  <br>  feel free to email me.

The more you spend time with him the more he was learn that you are his friend. Sure he's a lil fidgity right now, but don;t worry he'll start to take you in and love ya just as much as all the rest of our horses love us:] Spend lots and lots of time with him teaching him how to be lead with good mannors, and brushing him.|`|bXcmhRUOaa	This colt sounds as though he was mistreated or neglected.  Why did you buy him? He's going to need time and careful, patient handling to improve.  Removing him from the stall while cleaning will help in keeping him calm. Will he approach you for a treat? If so, reach under his jaw to scratch him. When you can get close enough to touch him, try scratching his itchy spots (the wither and top of the tail are two favorites) instead of stroking him. Have him gelded if you haven't had that done yet.|`|1HwyDyD0aa	Since you just brought him home Saturday, and he had a very long trip, for any horse, but especially a young one, you ought to leave him alone, by which I mean, don't try to handle him or do anything that stresses him out, for a week or so.  A trip like that is extremely stressful, physically and mentally for any horse.  He's a little traumatized I'm sure.  Just let him settle in.  Feed him, hang out in the stall with him, feed him carrot slivers, if you want to, but generally just let him adjust to his new surroundings.  You'll have plenty of time when the snow finally melts (if it ever does melt . . . . ) to begin work with him.  In the meantime, when he begins to settle down, and you've spent time in his company without bugging him,  he'll let you know when it's time for you to interact with him on  a closer basis.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Give him some time to adjust.  They usually take about three weeks to really settle in.  Don't try to touch him yet if he is timid.  He sounds like he just hasn't been handled alot or most likely he is just under alot of stress being away from home.  He will come around.  Just talk to him and start your relationship in the round pen or arena not in a confined stall if he is nervous in there.  <br>  <br>  Try to start him on some ground work like some round pen reasoning just walking and some trotting, he is a baby so you definitely don't want to be hard on him, but if you start to teach him to go right and left to get his mind going and thinking and eliminate you as a threat then start to work on touching him.<br>  <br>  We do this with all the youngsters that come through here and trust me we have had alot of babies here and it is always good to start with some light work before you attempt to touch them if they are nervous about you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|HRsbH5uIaa	Try to lead him out to a vacant field and let him graze and run around. Let him socialize and settle in. It's like moving to a new house and some stranger took you here you don't know. Think like him!|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Young horses especially when taken out of their safe environment tend to freak out.  It definitely takes time.  One thing u might do is to go in his stall and set a bucket upside down and set on it for however long it takes for him to come up to u.  Let him smell u and touch you without trying to touch him.  Let him know u are not a threat to him.  As hard as u want him to be friendly, he might feel u are pushing him too fast.  If he came from South Dakota he's had a long journey to get to u and it probably was very scary for him.  Time and patience, move slowly when u move around him don't let your movements be fast and rushed. <br>  Be sure when u go to feed him every morning that u take your time set the bucket down and set down not too far away from it but the whole time he eats do not touch him.  Let him get used to u being there,  You are a stranger to him and he needs to feel he can trust u.  It sounds like he didn't have a lot of training before u got him.  So it's probably going to be from scratch for u.  U don't have to actually hand feed him but he does need to be fed grain every day.  Hopefully this helps a little bit for u the most important thing is to not push him he has to get used to where he is first and then get used to you.  Good Luck!|`|kwhfazx7aa	Hi,<br>  Feed him from a bucket i.e treats feed etc, don't attempt to stroke him, many foals have had rough or no treatment and a raised hand scares them, he is not aware of your intentions.  Build trust by quiet gentle handling once he learns that the bucket means food turn him out to relax but keep up regular bucket feeds even if it's only the odd apple or carrot.  This allows the foal to associate you with good things.  Stand close to him whilst he eats but don't approach him let him come to you ,allow him to sniff your hands whilst he is doing this you can gently stroke his muzzle.  Never lift your hand to stroke between the foals eyes, this is the horses blind spot and it takes a great deal of trust on the horses part to allow this.  <br>  Mostly don't panic or get upset take it gradually and he will be giving you kisses and following you round the paddock before you know it.<br>  (I've had two yearling colts this year one was hardly handled and really jumpy, he is now so calm I am thinking of leaving him entire, obviously good conformation too). <br>  Hope this is of help, good luck.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Just try to imagine the stress he is experiencing.  Studies have shown that this experience is all it takes to begin the development of a gastric ulcer.  The best thing you can do for him right now is to be sure he has good quality hay in front of him 24/7, which is the best treatment to prevent and eliminate gastric ulcers.  Give him as much exercise as you can provide, and give him "toys" to reduce boredom during any stall time.  Beyond that, a nice scratch on his forehead is all he needs from you.  Putting your arm around his neck is like a predator grabbing him....it produces a stress response that he doesn't need to be dealing with.  Just let him have time to adjust, and provide what he needs for awhile.  And let him come to you....don't force yourself on him.  You can put treats in his feed bucket, and he will know it came from you.....I agree that you should not hand feed him.<br>  <br>  I agree with buckinfun's post...she is very good with starting young horses, and will help you get this done right.

If you already have a basking light, check your temps at the basking site. 88F-90F is good.<br>  I'd recommend an active UV heat. <a href="http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php?products_id=435" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php...</a><br>  Their skin needs to dry out, but if the basking site is to cold, they won't come out to bask.<br>  If the basking site is too hot, they will crawl out, sunbathe, and go back into the water to cool down after only a few minutes. Their skin never gets a chance to dry out.<br>  That bulb I listed throws heat, UVA, UVB, and full spectrum light. It's based on mercury vapor and can't be dimmed, so you have to make sure the distance between the basking site and the fixture can be adjusted. <br>  Also, I'd make sure it is in a clamp lamp that has a ceramic base, as the bulb throws a lot of heat for 100 watts.<br>  This will bring their colors back, as long as the water is kept clean.<br>  Too many protozoa colonies in the water will also cause the skin to whiten, because it makes the little ones itch unless they keep it wet.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	How are you keeping the turtle?

Don't worry I will miss my dog for years and years because shes old and very ill and in a few months maybe less it will be her time to go. I suggest a small pet that won't have that much attachment to you maybe like aquasaurs. They can live up to 20 to 90 days and you would have more eggs if you follow the direction. It could help you focus on them and not be depressed by the loss of your hamster. And I'm deeply sorry about your hamster. She is in a better place where she can do whatever she wants!|`|wKCm3useaa	It's normal to be sad about the death of a pet, but maybe you should try moving on.

ZDqdYhdGaa	First off I would consider inviting your neighbor over for a friendly talk. Calling Animal Control is a little extreme unless the dog is actually Attacking your dogs. You would be surprised how much sitting down and having a friendly talk can help. <br>  <br>  Tell him/her that your dogs are scared and that their dog is coming right over and bothering them while they are tied to a leash. Ask him/her as if you were asking a good friend if they could start putting their dog on a leash, that can still be a long one as long as it keeps yours and theirs away from each other. <br>  <br>  You are being responsible and keeping your dogs out of their yard, and you are only asking the same in return. Let them know that there are other neighbors who are having a problem with this as well, and drop a hint saying "some of the neighbors have called Animal Control on you, but I don't want to see your dog end up in the pound so I wanted to talk to you and suggest putting him/her on a leash". <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  On another note after reading other answers....Why do all you people think that calling animal control is the best option before actually trying to work it out with the neighbor? What if they think that the dog was stolen or killed and they don't try looking at the pound for it? That poor dog will end up being killed and all he/she did wrong was wander around which it didn't know any better not to do. There are other ways to address these kind of situations that are in the best interest to the animals. Yeah calling and making your neighbors "pay" is payback, but think about the helpless animals you are hurting in the process of being immature. Unless the animal is harming another, it is a drastic measure to take before trying to talk to the pet owners. <br>  Don't get me wrong though, Animal control should be called if an animal is harming another, or is being abused and/or neglected, or in this case, if talking with the neighbor doesn't work. It just shouldn't be done if another solution could be available to try first.|`|aPClcfh9aa	If you live in a neighborhood and pay homeowners association fees, contact the HOA and file a complaint. If the city won't do anything, and animal control won't come pick the animals up, It may sound strange, but if there is a leash law in your state, contact the local authorities and the police will come give your neighbor a ticket for not abiding by the leash law for pets.|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	Dude..buy an electric fly swatter, ha ha.

AA10332192	Stages of the Canine Reproduction<br>  <br>  In dogs, the reproductive cycle varies a lot. A ***** can begin her first estrous cycle (heat cycle) at 6 months or as late as 2+ years. Generally though, puberty in canines begins at around 12 months, but in larger breeds it is usually at about 18 months to 2 years. A normal healthy ***** will usually cycle on a regular basis, every 4 to 12 months. This is largely breed dependent, for example the German Shepherd will cycle every 4 months. As they get older, bitches will cycle less frequently.<br>  <br>  There are four stages in the canine heat cycle (estrous) in dogs:<br>  <br>  Proestrus: Getting Ready<br>  <br>  Proestrus is the time when a *****'s reproductive tract is preparing for the possibility of breeding with a male dog. This lasts an average of about 10 days, but can be as little as 3 or as long as 3 weeks. Its onset is usually accompanied by a bloody discharge from the vagina as well as swelling of the vulva. A ***** that cleans herself can be hard to detect for a few days, so it is a good practice to lift her tail and check every day. This seems strange, but will become habit in time, and is the only way to be sure you have got the first day of her heat cycle.<br>  <br>  Dogs will become attracted to a female during proestrus, but she’ll show little interest in the male at this stage. The walls of the *****'s reproductive tract thicken during proestrus and you can use a cotton swab to collect epithelial cells (cells from the uppermost layer of the skin) from the reproductive tract of the *****, to view under a microscope. This is used to see how long she is into the cycle.<br>  <br>  The epithelial cells size and shape will change as the estrous cycle progresses. In the anestrus stage of the canine heat cycle, the epithelial cells of the reproductive tract are small and round with a dark spot in the middle (the nucleus). As proestrus ensues, these cells become larger, more angular and have little staining of the nucleus and they increase in number. Under a microscope, many red blood cells and some white blood cells, which were not present in the previous stage, can be seen in proestrus.<br>  <br>  Hormone levels also change during proestrus. Although estrogen levels rise in anestrus, they stay relatively low during the early part of proestrus. As the ***** enters the later stages of proestrus, however, estrogen levels continue to rise, reaching their peak near the end of this stage. Estrogen begins to fall as progesterone levels begin to rise. Progesterone remains high throughout the next two stages of the heat cycle, and is the hormone routinely used to test for when a ***** is about to ovulate and, therefore, should be bred.<br>  <br>  <br>  Estrus: She's Ready<br>  <br>  Estrus is the second stage of the estrous cycle. It also lasts an average of 9 to 11 days, but can vary from 3days to 3 weeks. This is the time when the ***** accepts the male dog for breeding. During this stage, she sometimes exhibits a behavior called "flagging." This involves the ***** standing in one place, maybe shuffling her feet, while at the same time, lifting her tail to allow the male to sniff her hind end.<br>  <br>  During estrus, the vaginal discharge decreases, becoming less bloody in many dogs. The discharge will become a straw olor. None of the small round epithelial cells that were typical of early proestrus can be seen under a microscope in estrus. Rather, a lot of angular platelets can be seen, stacked on top of each other.<br>  <br>  The progesterone level continues to rise. Near the onset of estrus, there is a very short rise in another sex hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH). Once this has peaked, ovulation usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours. The prime time to breed the dog is approximately 2 days after ovulation or 4 days after the LH surge.<br>  <br>  <br>  Diestrus: Progesterone Dominates<br>  <br>  The next stage of the heat cycle, diestrus, is considered the period when progesterone dominates the hormone scene. Diestrus lasts from 60 to 90 days in a dog that doesn’t become pregnant or approximately 63 days in a dog that does become pregnant.<br>  <br>  In diestrus, the vaginal discharge will stop and the epithelial cells of the reproductive tract quickly appear small and round again. White blood cells can be seen in very high numbers during the first few days of diestrus. This is normal, since their function is to clean up the cellular debris left behind by estrus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anestrus: The Final Stage<br>  <br>  The final stage of the heat cycle is called anestrus. Anestrus lasts an average of 4 to 5 months. During this time the sex hormones are at very low levels, although they do continue to have small rises and declines throughout this stage. If a swab of the reproductive lining is taken and viewed under a microscope at this stage, very few epithelial cells can be seen.<br>  <br>  Also check out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/Theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/The...</a>|`|br1Ixdxkaa	you wouldn't need an answer to this question if you would have gotten her fixed|`|evZXgXzXaa	If she's not swollen and there's no blood, it is unlikely she's in heat BUT perhaps it is about to start soon.

VOiYjBrSaa	This technique is safe for you and your horse, and is natural and less confusing: Play the squeeze game with him (with out a jump) so he won't have any anxiety about tight spaces. Then put a jump between you and the fence. Stand parallel to the fence and small jump, and send him over the jump as though there isn't one there. Even if he tries to bail out or knocks it down, stop and have him turn to face you (this lets him learn to look at you when he is confused) then pet him and try again. This time, using your carrot stick, put pressure on zone 4 (by going through the phases to send him forward-Phase one:Lift the carrot stick, Phase two: move it toward your horse's rear, Phase Three: Smack the ground, Phase Four: Tap your horse's rear with the savy string.) Remember: After he is over the jump (successful or not) have him turn and face you, then reward him for his efforts by playing the friendly game. If this still doesn't work, do all that is described above, then just before he goes over the jump go through the phases using the carrot stick-he will jump the jump this way. Make sure you start out with a jump about 18 inches high, that is solid (one that he respects so he doesn't knock it down).|`|aJGAXYUIaa	work him out then|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	When evr he stops in front of the jump be quick to back him up. this leave him with 2 options. <br>  Jump it <br>  or Back  up.<br>  Keeping your horse at a quick pace will encourage him to jump over instead of stopping. <br>  Run next to him and jump over it, maybe he'll follow you:] most horses follow thier ridder over the jump, and this gives them the right idea to just leap over it. start with a medium sized cross rail. I don't know if you use a whip with him, but if you don't i'd consider a lunge/dressage whip to engcourage him to speed up and jump over it <br>  Have Fun:]|`|rSpMzA11aa	Why dont you try lunging/walking him over ground poles first and gracualy work your way up...When i was teaching my horse to jump i started on ground ploes and work my way up..And my arab loves jumping know he is 19..and spunky..but anyway..try that and see what happens..if you have anymore questions or need help u can e-mail me dixiedelight90@yahoo.com|`|lK8D17WIaa	hire a trainer|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I would not use barrels, they're too high if he's just learning. Set up a small cross rail, have him go over it as a pole first then put it up as low as you can. put it against a fence or something so he can't back out that directions and stand on the other side. if it's really small you can lead him over it so he's not scared. make it so that he has no choice but also make it small and safe till he figures it out. If he continues to refuse he will do that for a long time so get a trainer if he keeps doing it.|`|MBwln1m7aa	Since you have him going nicely over the trot poles on the ground without him hesitating, and since he's only starting to hesitate when they get raised, try raising the last one ever so slightly, so that you hardly even notice them being picked up off the ground. You can start with a bar of soap under each end and when he's going over that put a brick under each end and so on until he can go over a small cavaletti(sp?).<br>  When he's going over the trot poles with the cavaletti at the end, start adding more height to it until he's jumping the barrel on the side.|`|HRsbH5uIaa	This takes time and patience, do you have a lunging whip? Some parelli whips are rather pricey, so Ebay would be recommended to buy a Parelli whip or even craigslist.com !

He needs to develop the muscles properly to be able to jump. Lay out poles on the ground for him to trot over on a lunge line-this will at least make him focus on getting his legs up and over a tiny obstacle. From there-rather than using barrels or straight rails-use a small cross rail (you make an "x" across the jump, search for a picture on google)-it will allow him a point on the jump to concentrate on. I really recommend getting a few books on training how to jump-theyre very helpful!<br>  <br>  I also taught mine by doing what another person just said-I had him follow me over cross rails-very effective! He loved it!

The average size seems to be 120 to 150 pounds but just like humans, pigs do come in various sizes and weights. With proper feeding and exercise your pig will grow to its predetermined genetic size. You can affect your pet pig's weight through overfeeding, underfeeding, or a lack of exercise (just like us!). This is not a good idea and could cause serious health problems!!<br>  <br>  There are many breeders out there that tell people that potbelly pig's will stay small if you do not feed them a lot. In the PBP world they are called back yard breeders. Please, DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM! Underfeeding a pig, or any animal for that matter, will cause serious health problems and deformities.

9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	First of all I would like to ask if this cat has ever been seen by the vet for this problem.  Have you already outruled this as being a medical issue rather than a behavioral one. If not, I suggest getting him to the vet.   IF so, have you tried talking to a vet or an animal behaviorist about retraining the cat.  If you have tried this as well, your other option is to have the cat confined only to a small portion of the house, or one or two rooms that do not have carpeting that are easy to clean if the cat makes a mess.  What about building an outdoor enclosure for the cat to stay in the day..then keep him in a designated room at night.  I am suggesting these things as it does sound like you would like to keep the cat.  It may not be the best set up to keep a pet in..but it would be a better altenative to euthanasia.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Odor removing tips:<br>  Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll ha|`|NPr6dVYZaa	You can purchase (don't laugh) Anti-Icky Poo for the carpet, kit includes injecting it into the pad to remove the odor. Here is one website for it. <a href="http://www.antiickypoo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antiickypoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also, you may want to talk to your vet about medication for your kitty and the behavior issues. There are several different meds that your vet could recommened to help with the urine issue.|`|io3lMQgFaa	If there is any trace of odor, a cat or dog will most likely keep peeing in that spot.  Try to find an effective odor remover.  Also, if you don't already have a cat box, get one.  If you already do have one, make sure you don't use any harsh cleaners; cats won't "go" in a place that doesn't smell natural to them.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Sadly, the only answer I can give you is to get rid of the carpet. Because the reason he keeps doing it there is that.. well.. it smells like urine, so he figures that's the ok spot to do it. You might try bleach on the carpet on that spot and then covering it with a heavy object so he can't go smell the spot anymore. Perhaps what would be kinder to him would be to keep him in a secluded (and quieter) room for a few weeks (if you have a free room or office) so he would not have access to the spot while you thouroughly clean it (although even if we don't smell it anymore, cats still smell the urine.. so it's difficult). I guess the only way to stop him is to be very patient and everytime he goes to that spot with that intention, pick him up and put him in a nearby litter box. It might take a very very long time to learn but he will get the point eventually. Although I still say that getting rid of that particular spot of carpet would be of great help. Good luck with that. If you love the cat and he likes you, do consider giving him "his" room where he won't be disturbed too much, especially since you say he's a nervous wreck. If you can't spare a whole room, get him a nice cat playpen (those very very large metal cages) and install him a new home there with a comfy bed, a litterbox and toys and go see him often to pet him and play with him, that way he won't have access to your rug. This might only need to be temporary.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i agree with you on your first statement!! <br>  <br>  have you tried putting the litter box in the exact same spot where he likes going? keep encouraging the litter box and continue to show him where it is or moved to. make sure it is always very clean, as most cats are very picky. and stop by your vet one day and grab the stuff they sell for urine smell. i've got it before and it works amazing!! (i forgot the name, sorry) but they will definitely tell which one to get. i've tried other stuff from the pet store and they just don't seem to get the smell out completely. if moving the litter box doesn't seem to help, try getting some repellent spray and spray in that area.  hope i helped~good luck!!!|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Hi there i have had the same problem.  Here are some ideas and hopefully some will help.  First is your cat neutered?  They say if they are not neutered that they tend to mark their territory.  Next I have actually washed the carpet with Pine-sol and really good and make sure it is the regular scent as the lemon scent will actually not help and will smell like pee.  Anyway i have scoured the area well with pine-sol and then dried well.  They also have a pet spray out for carpet that does help some but it's not great.  One thing i did find is if i kept the litter tray cleaned every single day sometimes twice a day she would not pee on the carpet.  She's really picky and doesn't like to step on any poop or anything.  Another thing to check is cats can have urinary tract infections for a long time and they tend to pee in spots like that if they have a UTI,  The last resort is to tear carpet up and paint with Kilz on the floor before laying down carpet again.  The Kilz really reeks a strong paint smell and takes the cat pee smell away.  Hope this helps good luck i know where u are coming from and i have had one nasty retort to a question i had asked and i turned them in for abuse so if u have this problem don't put up with it.  Take Care!|`|y4aAHmk3aa	Is your cat spayed/neutered? If not, (and it is a male) he may be 'marking his territory', and you need to get your cat fixed if it is not. Also, if you dont have a litter box, you should get one OR get those weewee pads that they make for dogs (they work on cats too). Another good thing to do is to pour a little ammonia on his pee spots. Not only will it help clean the spot and kill germs, it will also repel the cat from peeing there again. When cats smell ammonia they dont do their business where the smell is (they think it has been marked by another animal). To get rid of the smell, like I said ammonia and maybe carpet cleaner and febreeze for pet odors is great too. Hope this helps!
0mb78CiWaa	I do not believe you. <br>  <br>  <br>  If your story is true he would be dead. Dogs can not hold their breaths for hours.|`|KxjUim7yaa	It appears you were not ready for Pug ownership. I suggest NOT getting another dog.|`|szRioZMZaa	Dive under water and rescue him immediately! Pugs were never known to swim very well. Your dog might be dead by now. Call the vet, tell him/her the problem, pray a lot, hope the vet can fix the problem, and hope the poor pug isn't dead.|`|ybIviBRKaa	he's been under the water 4 houres?  sorry, he's probably dead.|`|AA12048299	He'll surface eventually. After he bloats.|`|6uDrv2aBaa	are you stupid! go bring it out.<br>  u dummy u shouldnt be allowed to own any pets.|`|EqZyhyRraa	Don't worry. Just go take your medication and you'll realize it was all an allusion. Tsk tsk, you forgot to take your pills this morning didn't you?|`|J7FuAWnMaa	Your dog is probably dead. Or he's really trying to stay on the surface.<br>  P.S. Go get him from the water you stupid idiot.|`|TnyXDmeTaa	you should get him quick he might die it been way to long take yor pug to a vet|`|SgPmNczTaa	first of all why did u leave him unattended? I think Future Pet Vet knows exactly what she's talking about!
00RgkZF8aa	I got my driftwood at Petsmart in the reptile section. Make sure the tag attached to it says that it's safe for aquarium use.<br>  <br>  You can also use craigslist to find some deals on wood.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	for some reason drift wood is not cheap could try craigslist. maybe make a post that you are looking for some.

Try a just going to a beach. I live in Maine, so there all over.
TjLCnxkKaa	I would say base it off of what a new tank would cost. You can buy 55 gallon tanks new including filter, heater, hood and lights for about $175+tax.<br>   Of course then you have the extras to buy on top of that. So you have to ask yourself is the balance a good trade with the used extras.<br>  <br>   I would base my decision on the fish. Go look at the tank and if you like the fish (not the species, the actual individual fish) then your mind is made up.<br>   Of course with the move and all there is no guarantee the fish will last.<br>  <br>   Good luck.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	That's an excellent deal. If everything's in good condition, the aquarium is a real steal, especially if you manage to get it for $155. I'd recommend scrapping the undergravel filters; they're useless when you have a bio-wheel, (or any type of decent filter, that is) You could always set it on a large table.|`|isF1nhVfaa	Haha, when I read the OBO part, I was gonna say, "You can talk 'em down!"<br>  <br>  It's sounds like a good deal to me. I let my craigslist chance slip away. I waited ONE day to call the people and the stuff was gone.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	The tank is a very good deal, but get your own fish and decorations. Thats the fun part!|`|e0Dj4Lejaa	No. The fun is all about making your own aquarium. Getting fish and filters all set will make the tank seem 'not yours'. You won't have memories of the fish since you got them, their feeding habits, do-s and don't-s and the condition of the tank. You won't know why the person is selling it truthfully, either. Price-wise, it seems a bit suspicious. Obviously, the person is desperate and has no respect for fishkeeping by hazarding the lives of his pets to internet strangers (no offense). Good luck.|`|rWcKYyiyaa	Without the stand I would offer 100.00.  You'll have to spend that much to get a nice one to put it on.  2 bios are nice but the undergravel filters are IMO not even necissary anymore and tend to clog up and store lots of waste below.|`|gTethcOAaa	I kind of agree with C that building your own tank is pretty cool. But you've done it before so its not super sentimental. I'd haggle em' down and then see if you cant trade the fish you get via craigs list haha.|`|lGSUToFQaa	it sounds like a great deal to me, and you can sell whatever you don't want|`|AwJXIFDraa	If you don't want the plecos, you can sell, or give them away. Lots of people would take them(including me).
4TX26viFaa	No, it's not like FeLV at all. Feline leukemia spreads casually with body fluids.  FIV spreads with deep bite wounds from a cat who has it to one who does not.<br>  <br>  FeLV shortens the lifespan significantly. FIV cats live 15 years or more with usually very few symptoms. <br>  <br>  We have two FIV males, taken in as strays.  They've lived with our three non-FIV indoor cats now for over 10 years and none of the non's have gotten it.  If the FIV cat doesn't bite, he/she won't spread it.  It is not spread casually at all, only by bites.  A lot of vets aren't up on the current research, and there's a lot of sites online that are very old and still recommend that an FIV cat be the only cat in the household.  That is very old information. There's no need to euthenize a FIV cat.  They can live 24/7 with other cats just fine.<br>  <br>  What you DO need to do, however, is to give them a good diet to try to keep their immune system up as far as it can be.  Don't vaccinate unless the vaccine is a killed virus, as their low immune systems can't utilize it.  And watch for the side effects of FIV, which is a dry coat, runny eyes and teeth problems. You treat those as they come up.  Most cats with FIV die from other causes, not from the FIV itself.|`|oKEXNRg8aa	FIV is similar to HIV. Both are autoimmune diseases. It is contracted via bite wounds, to the best of my knowledge. No, it's not the same as feline leukemia.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	It does sound as if he has a hairball or other obstruction (though ferrets can throw up at will.  One of mine would puke if anything upset him).  I've never had any luck with Ferret Lax getting rid of anything in my guys (just makes their poos weird for a while).  I personally use canned pure pumpkin instead of Ferret Lax, and this saved my guy from having to get surgery (your ferret just has to be able to poo some.  If he can't poo, then you shouldn't make him ingest anything more).  For suspected blockages, my vet told me to use 1 TBS of the pumpkin every 4 hours until I saw the hair in the poo.  Once I did, I kept giving him that dose until the poo was just poo.<br>  <br>  Just an idea that worked for me :)  Hope your little guy gets better soon!<br>  <br>  ETA: if he can't poo at all (not even a thin one or diaerrhea), then it's pretty bad.  When I gave Yogi the pumpkin,  he was still able to have some small, loose stools.  If you are sure he can't go at all, I would get him into a vet (or call and ask if pumpkin is still okay to give).  After you get this taken care of, you can use the pumpkin (usually Libby's) 3-4 times a week during a shed, and 2 times a week during non-sheds (just mix a TBS in with a favorite treat).|`|Y113b2rQaa	Did he throw him? high? if yes ferrets get very angry or if you poke them or if u try to do any sudden movments like fast or if he petted him hard or if he grasped him|`|DHFbOPVdaa	I once gave my ferret too many treats. It was her first time to have them and with the combination of everyone that wanted to give her some. it added up.  Anyway she ended up puking in the corner.  She went over to the corner to throw up.
rHwMf2P4aa	Well I have a few bettas myself and have encountered this problem before. If you are using ammonia remover in the water it will cloud it up. All you need is water conditioner (removes chlorine from regular tap water) and the food. Change their water once a week. I have my bettas all in 1 1/2 gal set ups. I keep some one gal milk jugs filled with water that I added the water conditioner to under my sink so that it set it up and goes to room temp witch is about 75 F then I pull it out when I do the water changes. I honestly think it is just the ammonia remover, a lot of chemicals used for tanks cloud the water and the filter is supposed to help with that. But with betta's it isn't necessary. I hope this helps. Tell me if it worked.|`|OdDbR4Psaa	It could be:<br>  <br>  * You didn't cycle the tank (letting the tank + filter run for at least 3 weeks so all the ammonia/nitrate..etc. levels will balance and stabilize itself)<br>  <br>  * The bamboo could be rotting - take it out and check for any rotting. If there is, immediately remove|`|fYupEegGaa	It could be do to allot of thighs but here's the 3 things I think.<br>  1. If you don't have a filter then your water will be murky so if you don't have a filter that's your problem and you need to get one.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  2. The chemicals you are putting in your tank like, the ammonia remover. The only thing you should be putting in your tank is a water conditioner that, Removes Chlorine and Chlorine, Naturalizes Heavy Metals, and Coats to protect. To much water conditioner or any amount of other chemicals you are putting in your tank will cause it to get murky. You can get rid of ammonia by simply doing 25% water changes weekly.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  3. If you didn't cycle your tank and your tanks are new you are having bacteria blooms and this causes murky water at first and this happens to all tanks. (With a bacteria bloom your tank won't smell it will only look cloudy.)
vv2uk9hHaa	It could be a stroke. Would explain the paralysis and the fact she can't eat without help. Have you tried feeding her ensure (or any lactose free meal replacement, vanilla works well) with a medicine dropper? And pregnancy wouldn't do anything like that in cat, whoever told you that is way off! Nine years old is pretty old for a cat that has been rescued... It could be renal failure as well. If that's the case, good luck. it's difficult to save cats with kidney problems. The meowing is probably because she is in great pain (otherwise cats don't meow unless it's excruciating) and very scared about what is happening to her. Keep her warm in a blanket and keep giving her water with the dropper frequently, and try to comfort her by speaking to her softly and gently petting her head. Best of luck with her, hope she gets better. Although for the walking, it might be arthritis if she "can" walk but doesn't want to because it hurts (my old cat had that,  but he was 17 years old). If the legs are just no longer functioning at all (she doesn't even move or twitch them) then it's most likely paralysis.|`|gBgSMgClaa	The vet would be best to tell you but my cat that did that got worming poisioning. His liver started to fail. They kept him a few days and then he was ok but for sure the vet will be the only one to give the correct condition of your cat. My cat was also stumbling around and meowing like he was crazy or blind or something but he was just loosing his balance.|`|AA10210947	Could be numerous things. FIV, Feline Leukemia, Kidney disease, infectin, poison.  Please take it to the vet to get it help|`|yLiOgVEYaa	blind would be my last guess. it sounds like something is going wrong in her stomach or intestines. not eating that long isn't good at all. please get to the VET asap. best wishes!|`|xYkzNTLmaa	This isn't really an answer but how old is she she could be just geting old.|`|2f1374e471cdcbe573f1860b783fcecaaa	When my cat got old, she refused to eat for weeks.   Could it just be old age?|`|0mb78CiWaa	She may have been poisoned. Or she may be paralyzed. It is a good idea to take her to the vet.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	oh my god. you need to take her to the vet NOW!! if she hasn't been eating for a week, ther is something serious!! i mean as soon as you get this, go now!! also email me with what happens please.. i really want to know what is going on..<br>  my email is kathy_ross_94@yahoo.com

zqVDJxUIaa	The pleco will eat the algae already in the aquarium, although as they age, they might not eat as much. Feeding algae tablets is a good option, and I would assume that your pleco is simply not eating when you are watching. Would you want to eat dinner it there was a gigantic spotted thing with fins and a huge mouth watching you? Don't worry, you won't overfeed the pleco with a tablet. Good Luck!|`|M3pjhIecaa	If you find a plate of food on the table would you go into the kitchen to make yourself something to eat, same story with fish if you feed them they'll not make the effort to graze, cut the feeding down to a bare minimum this may also help to cut down the algae as that require food, oxygen and light to grow starve it of any of those 3 and it becomes managable. Once every other day should suffice. However, when you say plec it would help to know the type, some L no's species will only graze on specific growth areas like wood and will not touch the glass or stones.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Personally I would go for the Gourami option, Honeys are healthier than Dwarves. <br>  <br>  Angels need a bit more space than the Cube provides, a pair would need more like 45-55 gallons.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	What did the vet tell you?<br>  <br>  When one of mine was dehydrated from pnumonia, the vet sent me home with a medicine dropper to give some water every now and then.  I found in his case throwing him ice cubes worked better.  I really think you should call your vet back and tell them what is going on though..|`|CkecSp4Uaa	You can't make a dog drink.  You could try to syringe her some water but it's most likely not going to go over too well and you'll probably end up wearing more of it than you get into her.  You can also try feeding canned food (which is largely water) and/or wetting down her dry food with water to help keep her hydrated.  If you just brought her home she might still not feel very well and might be reluctant to drink because of that.  If she doesn't start drinking on her own soon you should go back to the vet and try to find out why she isn't drinking because a healthy dog will not refuse to drink.|`|KxjUim7yaa	She may drink some warmed chicken broth where she wouldn't drink water. Don't feed her dry food. That just promotes dehydration. Go with canned or boiled chicken and rice. Call your vet if this continues.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I'm sure you have tried but if not maybe put a little flavoring in it or chicken broth so it will be appetizing to her.|`|jhZegrqRaa	Recently one of my week old pups became very dehydrated and was refusing to feed. I took her to the vet who gave her a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.<br>  <br>  I took her home and fed her with Whelpi (replacement milk) from a syringe every two hours - day and night! <br>  <br>  If you can get her a bitches replacement milk and feed her from a syringe - obviously without the needle - every two hours that might help.<br>  <br>  This milk contains electrolytes which are necessary to keep your pup alive.<br>  <br>  You really should consult your vet again who should keep her in until she recovers enough to drink properly.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	my pomeranian has the same problem. if she hasn't had anything to drink in a while then take her water bowl and bring it to her. encourage her to drink by leading her head to the bowl. if she doesn't drink dip your fingers in and let her lap the drops of water from your finger. try to get more water on your fingers and lead her head closer to the bowl by doing that. then once her head is close enough then leave her and hopefully she will start drinking.|`|MGihRO3baa	Dehydration is definitely a sign of something more serious. What did the vet say? If he didn't check for any diseases, and esp. if he didn't help you treat him, get a new vet.|`|VybYClAHaa	Try wetting her tongue with the water using your finger and see if you can lead her to the water dish if that doesn't work, call the vet and take her in, they may have to give her an IV.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tY14vbrKaa	The vet should have handled the dehydration with an IV, and kept her until she was recovered.  Go to a different vet.|`|o93EwErKaa	You could try spiking the water with a low sodium chicken broth.  If that doesn't work, I would buy some plain Pedialyte (or the Walgreen's brand) and give her small amounts with an eyedropper or syringe every hour on the hour around the clock until she starts drinking on her own.  Your vet could also give her what is called sub-q fluids (subcutaneous - under the skin) that forms a hump on her back that slowly are absorbed.  You could also have her placed on iv. fluids but this is more expensive since she has to stay with the vet.  Depending on her size, she may even be too small for iv fluids.<br>  <br>  When you buy the Pedialyte by the individual small bottles because it has a short shelf life once it has been opened.  I think it is like 72 hours kept refrigerated, just read the label it is on there.|`|cETQuE9waa	Call the vet back and tell them what is going on.<br>  <br>  Have you tried giving her an ice cube?

x0WZE0i4aa	In my experience cats always do silent and deadly ones.  So either that's a very unusual cat, or your friend is telling porkies.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Most probable answer: the cat lifted his tail as a reflex just like he does when he goes to the litterbox. Otherwise no, impossible. It would take more air pressure to lift all that bone and muscle and fur than what any cat or human could produce. I know fluid mechanics (gases are fluids) and no, impossible.  The poor cat just twitched his tail with incredible timing, but the air pressure didn't lift it.|`|szRioZMZaa	You never know if your friend is lying or not. Some people exaggerate just to get attention or to be funny. If it farted big and hard, she would of heard it. And cat's farts are meant to not smell. The bigger the fart the less it smells. She is definitely exaggerating.|`|9nJwsSvPaa	lols....|`|PDMQ5XVyaa	Umm...LOL!!

This would explain the bumps. A virus also could explain the bumps. this also would explain the fact that the first bump could go away, cuz his body fought it off. Call up the doc and tell details, detail about the hamsters symtons.<br>  <br>  Look around maybe you can find a place that'll check out youre hamster for less money.|`|6mKPb198aa	call up petsmart and talk to the small animal specialist, they may be able to help you out since they work with hamsters everyday.

Apisf1gAaa	I agree with Shelley--I'd lose the heat rock.  I'm afraid it would cook them.  Those things are made for much bigger reptiles.  As for suggestions...  <br>  - Some fake flowers - available in your local craft or dollar store, these not only look nice, but they can climb them too.<br>  - Lots of extra shells - You need at least three per crab (so for your at least 15), but some hermit crabs love to change shells like we change clothes, so if you have a lot you can enjoy watching them change "fashions."  You can put them all in a plastic container like a tupperware container and create a "shell shoppe"--it takes up much less room.<br>  - Used fish net as climbing wall/bridge - The used fishing net looks great, and is a very light and large climbing net for your crab. It's also cheaper than most pet store stuff, and I personally think it looks nicer, too.<br>  - Plastic shower caddy - The plastic shower caddies can be used to create second levels for your crabs. This gives them more room to explore, and enables you to have more space to work with. Most people use them for either shell shops (meaning where they place all the shells for the crabs if they choose to swap) or moss pits in them. However, they can be used for anything you can think of. The more floor space they have, the more room to go digging.<br>  - Moss - Moss is a good addition to your 'tat because it helps raise the humidity level. When buying moss, make sure there aren't lots of sticks and stuff in the package, and also make sure that it isn't spanish moss. It's usually loaded with dyes and stuff. It's easy enough to avoid--they make enough of it. Again, you have your choice of pet store or craft store to buy it from, however it will probably be cheaper in the craft store.<br>  - Suction cups - You'll need to hang up your climbing stuff somehow if it's meant to go on the back of your 'tat. Make sure they're heavy duty suction cups, and not the cheap kind--they'll fall off in the high humidity.<br>  <br>  P.S. - Whatever you choose to buy as a hidey or decoration needs to be boiled in the sea salt you're buying for the salt water dish first. This gets rid of anything that would be harmful to the crab in it. The exception to this is the moss. See my source on Moss to read how to prepare that for the tank.<br>  <br>  And I'm sure your conditions are fine, but don't forget that ideal conditions make them happy too!<br>  <br>  Finally, I know you're not bragging, but so few people know about proper hermit crab care that whenever anyone does it right, they're accused of being fanatical.  So don't worry about it :)|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I wouldn't use a heat rock in a hermit crab tank. they can be burned by sitting on it too long, just a heads up. <br>  <br>  if you have room maybe a flower pot half in the sand for them to hide in. Mine LOVE flower pots. <br>  some fake plants would add some greenery to your tank and climbing and hiding space. <br>  Have you thought about a second level? You can buy turtle docks or second levels that attach to the tank with magnets, or reptile hammocks. Lots of cool level items in the reptile section of your pet shop. <br>  If your handy you can make a second level. baskets and suction cups, plexi glass, or shower caddies make great levels. just avoid evergreen wood and metals.|`|yExNvBmsaa	to much stuff hermit crabs are JUST FINE IN SAND!!
0mb78CiWaa	The swelling is normal. It will swell down soon. To be sure you could call your vet and ask them.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It will be a little puffy/swollen till the skin heals - if it gets hot or looks red (not pink) then get her to the vet.<br>  <br>  If the cat is inside and clean, there is little risk of infection.|`|gBgSMgClaa	I agree with the other writers as long as pus isn't coming out of the site and the stitches are not tearing she should be ok.

There's no such thing as a stupid question, and I think it's better to be a little overly cautious than it is to ignore a potential problem. Just describe her symptoms to the receptionist, and she'll tell the doctor who will call you back. He might say that everything sounds normal, or he may tell you to bring her in for a re-check.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry!|`|yLiOgVEYaa	everything seems to be normal so far. the pink or redness and swelling is ok and normal. now if it seems to get worse or infected (with puss visible) and she is not feeling well, time to get back to the vet asap! the risk should be very low though. just keep an eye on her and you and kitty will be alright! best wishes!!
yLwKWzIUaa	you have to start gradually. first go somewhere with minimal distractions such as a park with just a few kids playing. and then gradually increase the distractions.<br>  the trick is though, go back to the beginning of each exercise each time you up the anti of distractions. for example: instead of making him stay 6 feet away from you, do it with him sitting right beside you.<br>  be patient and consistent.<br>  good luck :)|`|GSf09ALBaa	Leader of the Pack.

If you were really wanting to train a good fish, then it would cost you millions to set up and maintain a tank...for DOLPHINS. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I'll give you a realistic picture now. In my community aquarium, my Corydoras Catfish will willingly eat food off my hand, and will even let me pick it up to move to a separate tank (although I rarely do that, of course).<br>  Cory Cats are excellent fish, and cost less that 10 dollars.<br>  <br>  I really don't think that you'll find a fish you can train, other than doing simple things.<br>  <br>  My Zebra Danios rise to the top and snap at the water when I open the aquarium hatch/lid, but that's just habit, because food's coming next...|`|igpMQn0kaa	Training a fish isn't unrealistic AT ALL!

2qgg2G8kaa	First of all, you shouldn't have kept that rat in the cage for so long. The snake is stressed out. Take the rat out and don't try feeding the snake that rat anymore, obviously it isn't interested. Rats and mice have the ability to kill snakes. The rat may have been biting your snake so the snake doesn't want it in her enclosure. So, take that rat out and clean out the whole entire cage. You don't want any rat feces and urine in the snake's bedding. Put new, fresh bedding in her cage and clean off everything with hot water. Let her stay in her cage for a few days then try again with a completely different rat. Also try a smaller rat since the snake isn't used to having a rat so big. If the snake still does not eat, try taking her to a herp vet and see if there is anything wrong with her. The rat could have possibly carried parasites. Also check your snake for any signs of bite marks and external parasites.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Remove the rodent from your ball python's cage. It is best to never leave a live feeder mouse in a ball python cage for more than 10 minutes. Always be present when you feed live prey because there is a chance the rodent could chew on your snake or even kill it. If your ball python is healthy and at a good weight, it is more than likely fasting. This is normal ball python behavior. Some ball pythons can fast for up to a year before the begin to feed again. It sounds like your snake is becoming active again and it will begin to feed again real soon. Just offer it occasional meals till she breaks her fast and then feed her regularly after that. If you notice any weird behavior like, if she is laying on her back, dropping runny stools, wheezing, gaping or drooling, then it would be best to take her to see a vet. Maintain the correct temperature ranges for your ball python. Feed rodents that are equal in size to your snake's mid-section at it's widest margin.|`|weMz8ze6aa	First of all if you have left that rat in there that long than you have no reason to own reptiles. But i personally would take it out and try a smaller one and i have some ball pythons if you are interested in any more. Hope this helps<br>  <br>                          ---Blayne---|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Why on earth would you leave a rat in with your snake for so long? It will stress out your snake and poses a very real threat. Rats can and will attack snakes in confined spaces where escape isn't an option. <br>  <br>  Remove the rat. If you want to keep it as a personal pet, fine, but don't keep it with your snake. Personally, I would kill the rat and then offer it to the snake. If she still didn't eat it I'd put it in the freezer to try again at the next feed or throw it away. A live rat in the confines of a cage can be intimidating and having this one present for nearly a month has likely had an adverse effect on the snake. <br>  <br>  Remove the rat from the cage and clean your bedding. Remove all trace of the rat having been there. Leave her alone for at least a week so that she can readjust and try a smaller feeder rat or a large mouse after a week has passed. Do NOT place that feeder in the cage and walk away if you're feeding live. If you intend to continue using live you MUST stay with you snake until she kills it because you will have to intervene if the rat attacks your snake. I'm not a fan of feeding live unless it's mouse/rat pinks and fuzzies that don't pose any threat to the snake. I use pre-killed feeders or frozen/thawed feeders with my snakes. If she still doesn't eat I wouldn't worry as it's not uncommon for adults to go off feed this time of year but you really should know better than to leave a potential killer in a cage with your snake.<br>  <br>  This is what can happen when you leave a live rat with your snake:<br>  <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/b/jbuncc/dont%20feed%20live1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/b/jbuncc/dont%...</a>|`|JH9eOYUaaa	Im not going to be mean about it like the other people who posted answers saying that you have no business owning reptiles, and ball pythons are supposed to be starter snakes anyway. Sometimes Snakes wont eat there prey if its to big, they like to size up there prey. I would take the snake to the vet because it cant be shedding for a full month and that's usually the case as to why they wont eat. In the mean time, take the rat out and either put it in a cage until your ready to make a meal out of it and hope you don't get attached to it or bring back to the pet store. You should definitely bring your snake to the vet, as there is probably something wrong, and if the snake has never eaten a medium/large rat before, maybe try one meal size down. Hope this helps- Tony|`|sBp7jg9Kaa	Im not going to add to much to the not keeping the rat in their for as long as you have, you are lucky the rat didn't attempt to eat the spin out of you snake. Rats when deprived of certain vitamins, animals (us included) will instinctively seek out needed nutrition through other sources like your snake. Rats should never been left in the cage without supervision, and should be taken out as soon as you leave. Put for your question, I don't know where you live or how cold it is their and what temperature you keep your snake at but if he gets to cold at night or during they day he may be confused on whether to hibernate or not, i had a similar issue with my snake because my room gets really cold at night so I put a black light (for reptiles) that is on day and night and my main light is on a timer so he is warm night and day. Also don't worry to much you literally have to try to kill as snake (unless you leave a rat in his cage =P) but they can go months without food not saying its good for him but if he starts looking really skinny and he still wont eat that's when i would go to the vet.

vv2uk9hHaa	If he vomits the water too that's not a good sign, he might get dehydrated. If he starts being lethargic (doesn't move around much, doesn't respond to his name or noises) bring him to a vet ASAP. It might be just a stomach bug (like we get) or something poison he ate. Normally a cat will puke once or twice, but a full day... well that's not too reassuring. Make sure he has lots of fresh water. If he doesn't urinate either, bring him to the vet asap as well. Wait a few more hours.. If he starts keeping water down within about three hours (with no other alarming symptoms) then he should be fine. Once he is able to keep water down, don't give him dry food right away. Either give him baby food (we give our cat pure chicken puree) or his usual food mixed in water to soften it up. Hope he feels better soon. Should the sickness last more than 36 hours, bring him to a vet.|`|w1lh1INHaa	It is possible it is a bug.  Currently there is a horrific stomach virus going on in England, and as it is airborne, it could have crossed the Pond.  My cats (NY) had a bit of a vomiting issue last week and I was wondering if that was the problem.  They seem to be okay now, and I gave them all a little baking soda to help calm the acids.  So, just watch for a day or so, and if it keeps up, get to the vet.<br>  <br>  Then there is McBuff that suddenly, it seemed, developed a bad reaction to dry food.  Bingo one day, he started with the gutteral yowling and then vomiting.  I took him off dry food immediately and then watched what happened with other foods.  Well, it seems that he has developed allergies to corn, wheat, glutens and fish foods, and have to feed him primarily grain-free and gluten-free food (both canned and home-made raw), absolutely no dry, and fish/seafood only when I am willing to deal with barf.  <br>  <br>  I also found that feeding fewer, smaller meals helped.  When cats gollop their food they can ingest a lot of air and this makes for stomach upsets and upchucks.  Smaller meals won't stress digestive juices or the system, as no matter the issue, his stomach and system needs a little rest.<br>  <br>  The concern with a lot of vomiting is the stress it puts on the esophagus as well as the heart, not to mention lack of calories and nutrient absorption.  It is good your cat is drinking, as vomiting can made a cat dehydrated.<br>  <br>  Again, if he hasn't improved, it would be wise to get him to the vet.  Check his hydration by pulling the skin at the back of the neck.  If it snaps right back, his hydration is good.  If it hangs for a few moments before falling back, he is becoming dehydrated and needs some hydration help, stat, and probably from the vet.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hope he's over the tummy upset soon.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Cats vomit for hundreds of reasons.

She could become dehydrated even if it isn't serious. Not to scare you but my cat started the same thing and she ended up with F.I.P a very serious illness. It cost me a few thousand to treat her and keep her as long as I could and as comfortable as I could. They gave her about 8 weeks to live when first diagnosed and that is almost how long she lasted. I had to give her an iv everyday for her fluids and took off work to care for her. She eventully stopped walking except to her little box. When her fever went up and she stopped walking I had her put down.

6mKPb198aa	feed him a handful of timothy hay EVERY DAY along with his food. give him store bought oranges once a day (cut up like 2 wedges) feed him the best food you can find, that few extra bucks will add on another 2-3 years of life.

Although, i'm only human so oopsies happen.<br>  <br>  When she starts to snif around, I'll take her outside. Also after eating napping and evry now and then take them outside. When she goes outside, praise her alot after she goes.<br>  <br>  when she goes inside, have her smell it and say NO firmly, but not too loud, cause she's just learning. And take her outside for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Once she learns she'll hafta be outside anyways, and only gets praise when she goes outside, shell get it.<br>  <br>  Also depending on the dog it does take a while for them to learn. And once they're smell gets inside, they'll think its okay to go inside.<br>  <br>  I heard vinager, gets rid of ther scent, and they dont like the smell of vinager so they dont remark it.

Please don't support the BYB industry by paying a ridiculous amount of money to someone who is unscrupulously breeding mixed breed dogs for profit.  There are no respectable breeders advertising "puggles" or any other crossbreed, designer dog.  <br>  <br>  There are many "puggles" and "pom-chis" and other crossbreed mutts at pounds, shelters and rescues.  While "puggles" may be cute, they also tend to have many of the characteristics of beagles, including being "runners" and being high-energy dogs that require exercise and training.  Sometimes more than their owners expected, which accounts for why there are so many at rescues.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I've been helping a friend retrain a rescued puggle.  She got him from another family who couldn't deal with him and his high-energy behavior.  Please check into both pugs and beagles and their temperaments and breed characteristics before you consider adopting one.  Learn more about the breed(s), not just the "cute" factor, when considering a new dog.
FdcWPp48aa	When a previously house broken dog is having accidents, first thing to do is a check up at the vet.  He could have urinary tract infection or bladders stones.  Need to have him evaluated first.  If no health issue is found then look at behavior issues.  Is there anything that has changed in your house lately?  New baby?  New house? New work schedule?

8a418a8a05471d36539222116b7de4c6aa	Some years ago, I used to do some fostering for a local rescue group, but then we moved to a different city where I was less familar with local shelters and rescues...<br>  <br>  Anyhow, when my older dog died last summer, I went to petfinder.com and looked at dogs in various rescues, shelters and pounds around the area.  I ultimately ended up adopting a wonderful dog from a nearby municipal pound that I *never* would have found, were it not for petfinder.   When I was searching, I also filled out some application for nearby rescue groups (not breed specific).  I found, however,  that it was much, much *easier* to deal with groups, shelters, rescues and pounds where I could actually *call* and speak with someone on the phone (my other dog went blind a couple of years ago, so I had some special needs/requirements for a new dog).   If you click on the dog info and/or the shelter/rescue group info at petfinder, they will often list phone numbers.  Or, if you find a rescue group that you want to deal with, do a web search and see if they have a phone number.  Sometimes rescuers are so overwhelmed with e-mail, that it takes them a looong time to read e-mails and/or to process applications.  A phone call might  make them work more quickly/more efficiently on your behalf.   After speaking with people and explaining my situation, I even had nearby shelters that would call *me* when a potentially appropriate dog was brought in.   I say, if you're having difficulty, limit your search to shelters and rescue groups with phone numbers (and with people who will *answer* your calls and questions).  Best of luck to you!!|`|Xj4ip63Qaa	Local shelter!|`|YYnJvWU1aa	I have gotten both of my dogs from shelters.  My suggestion would probably be to continue with the online search, but at the same time possibly visit your local humane society.  You might be surprised what you find there.  Just a suggestion.  Good Luck!|`|e4891efcb808213d898f07ad2c4ee8e2aa	I am in the process of looking for a dog. I found one on petfinder.com. It is not an online shelter, i have never heard of an online shelter, but it is a website where shelters can post their pets they have for adoption. I went to the shelter's website and sent them an email about a certain dog. They did respond, and they told me to come down to the shelter to see the dog, and make sure we get along. We did get along, i fell in love, and i just sent an application online. They were very helpful, and understanding. Now the only problem i have is my apartment's property manager. She is the judge on whether or not an animals 'looks like a pit bull' Which sucks, because she has small children and two chihuahuas. But if you aren't finding any success through online shelters, try looking on petfinder.com to find local shelters in your area. You can view the dogs online, then go visit them at the shelter to make sure they are what you are looking for. Good Luck, i hope you find your new friend soon!!|`|AA11626012	Petfinder.com is a great site to find a pet to adopt. They have listings from virtually all shelters and foster agencies around the country and you can search by age, size, breed and location so you can find a dog to fit your home that is nearby. They don't handle the adoptions, but put you directly in contact with the shelter that has the pet you want. They also handle listings for cats, reptiles, pocket pets and farm animals that need homes. I can't endorse them enough!<br>  <br>  If you have problems with them responding through email, then you should go right in to the shelter that has the pet you want.
fieKbjFTaa	Well I suppose it just depends on how much you keep on it. You have to be right there to tell him off each time he chews, if you don't catch him in the act then it's too late to scold. I really think it just comes down to training, some dogs chew well into their adulthood while others stop in their puppyhood. It is a natural thing for puppies to do, remember that. Try and remove the objects that he likes to chew on, although I know thats not always easy (my dog liked to chew on wood when she was a puppy which made it hard because a lot of stuff in the house is wood.) She was 7 months old when we got her and she wasn't out of her "chewing stage" but she was a rescue dog and I don't think she got the training that she needed in order to kick the chewing habit. I'm sure if you keep on it, it shouldn't take too much longer! Be patient.|`|b8e4fa3156f546ac8326a8e1e6fb6952aa	a puppy usally ends its chewing stage when it's one and a half years old you should get him chew toys so that he doesn't have to chew on your belongings|`|3mURyr6Saa	im not sure but there are doggy schools to teach dogs to stop or you can show the dog yourslef that chewing things that are not sopposed to be chewed is a no no

I used to have some when i was little.  Please don't get a hamster if it's male another male one to live with because I did that and they fought.  And sometimes the male and female fight too.  People will tell you that they need company/companionship but they're fine without it.

Be sure to buy them some food with variety with like pellets, mixed seeds, etc* They love variety! Also chew sticks (about a dollar at a petstore) are amazing for your little guy their teeth are constantly growing and they need things to chew on to keep them at a good size. Hamsters, Mice, Rats almost all small pets just love toilet paper rolls it is perfectly fine for them No health risks or anything because most of the time they spit the cardboard out but they love to chew it and run in and out of them. Make sure to get them a little hide out hamsters like their own space just as much as the average person would.  If you decide to use woodchip bedding  for  your hamster NEVER EVER USE CEDAR. Small pets are very prone to respiratory infections and cedar bedding can be the first to cause this!  I use pine for my guinea pigs ive also heard aspen is very good. ALSO he needs a wheel hamsters are very entergetic and need to put that energy somewhere! NEVER Get him a Wire wheel, (the metal ones) it can cause alot of problems! <br>   Good luck i hope my information was helpful!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also cute names;<br>  sophie<br>  fuzzbucket<br>  hammy<br>  peepers<br>  fuzzbutt<br>  <br>  those are just a few!|`|c425f8caf3f51e6fd3679c060e0b626daa	well, the girl above me covered the bases, but I wanted to share with you my favorite little boy's names for his hamsters.

Alot of rodents DO have specific diets, dwarf hamsters can not have any sugar as they are prone to diabetes, rats can not have sweet potatoes, and males can not have orange/orange juice because it interacts with some kind of protine that comes from the testicals that turns into cyanide.<br>  <br>  - Produce a LOT of waste, and will often poop or pee on you while you're holding them-------<br>  The only thing I've ever had happen was fear poo (which is pooping when they are very scared) and marking, very small drops of urine used to establish that you are THEIR property.....<br>  <br>  <br>  - Cage smells and must be cleaned daily-----not true if you have a properly sized cage, you should only have to wipe it down 1-2 times a week and do a complete change of bedding and scrubing the cage once every 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  - Require fresh food and water daily-------well duh, so do you, your mammal, should we get rid of you? Reptiles require fresh water every day as well.<br>  - Only live 5-10 years, max-------some species of rodents live less than that, rats AVERAGE longest lifespan is about 3yrs old, which is equivelent to about 60 yrs in human years:<br>  R-1yr=H-30yrs, R 2 yrs=H 45 yrs, R 3 yrs = H 60 yrs, R 4 yrs= 75 yrs, R 5 yrs=H 90 yrs, R 6 yrs= H 105 yrs, R 7 yrs= H 120 yrs.....<br>  (R means Rat, H means Human)....<br>  <br>  Other species of rodents such as degus, live 5-10 yrs.... <br>  <br>  <br>  - Often bite--------I've never had a rodent that bit just because, it is usually something the HUMAN did to CAUSE it to bite, like coming in to pick it up from over head, remember, rodents are PREY items, and that may seem like a bird about to swoop down a eat them. They react out of fear, anger, territor issues, and  illness.<br>  <br>  - Not a lot of variety in species------maybe not variety OF species but there is variety IN the  species, such as dumbos, rex's, double rexs, fawn, black, black berk, down under, bare back, hooded, and so on for different coat/color/ear set of rats.....Hamsters have a TON of different coat colors and lengths, mice come in a ton of diff coat colores as well, I've even seen a few "dumbo" mice.<br>  <br>  Do a little reasearch first...<br>  <br>  I have my rats, and I wouldn't exchange them for the world.

Because of this, people must never let their rodent pets of different species live together as one will almost certainly kill the other. Squirrels are and rats are both larger rodents. I would think putting them together would result in death, most likely of the smaller rat.<br>  <br>  Some animals can get on with others (such as cats and dogs as mentioned above) but these are more often larger animals which are trained and feel like they are part of the family group. It is harder to train smaller animals in a way which would make them feel like their human owners are the leader of their pack, and so if introduced to other species their instincts kick in far more readily.|`|MKLSgaWEaa	lol ya never know. people doubt cats and dogs getting along, but my 5 cats and 3 dogs get along great!|`|c20b9fdfd590d6d321909494ba00d08aaa	nooo!!|`|16P5gG7Baa	no|`|kMV8Y0ayaa	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a squirrel can not get along with a rat squirrels love to eat rats and if its a crazy squirrel that doesn't eat rats the rat will nip at the squirrels ears in its sleep TRUST ME DONT PUT THEM TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

Her cage is her sanctuary, the place where she feels safe. If you stick your hand in there, she'll feel threatened and try to bite you. Put her cage in a room where you'll be for a while, open the door and then go about your business, speaking to her in a gentle, soft tone every few minutes. Don't approach the cage and even if she comes out, don't try to pick her up. Eventually, (and I mean after several days of this) move closer to the cage and just talk to her. After some time, she'll seek you out to be held. It will take time, but with patience, eventually she'll come to trust you and you'll be able to pick her up.|`|e3128f00f7a3a5ecd476681febb23251aa	I would buy a book on training and taming parrots (=.

It could also mean a variety of different parasites. I would say to take it to the vet and have it checked out for parasites or diseases. If thats not really in your budget, watch and make sure he doesn't lose weight and make sure he is properly hydrated. Usually an older cat (10-13yrs old) will lose fur around the ears but at 2yrs old I would say this would be a health issue. It is possible that it is dry skin.

They almost flap surfaces when they walk.  I've had two of this breed, both of which lived past 13 years.  A vet can advise you better of course, but dogs don't walk the same as humans because of the makeup of their front and hind legs and the fact they weigh less than humans. Their muscle and bone structure is different.  Some dog breeds like sheperds develop arthritis and hip displacement problems because of the structure of their hind legs.

AA12260782	Concentrate on the positive.  Instead of freaking yourself out about what you can't do, think of what you do well.<br>  <br>  Think about the horse itself.  Animals relieve stress and are sympathetic listeners.  Maybe spend more time petting and talking to the horse.  <br>  <br>  Always end lessons with your favorite thing.  What ever that is,<br>  do it last.  You remember the last parts better, so when you are remembering previous lessons, it's pleasant.  If you make pleasant memories you are more likely to be more relaxed.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself why you're doing this.  Is winning your only reason?  Is exersize or just "getting out there"<br>  Remember- <br>  You CHOOSE to do this.<br>  If you get this upset, QUIT!!!<br>  It's not worth it, life is just too short.<br>  This should be a pleasurable hobby that relives stress.  <br>  Take up something else.<br>  <br>  You could do a different decipline with horses.  There are lots of clubs, competitions, and activities for horses out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|3jA3kQNaaa	Just relax and pretend nobody is watching you|`|PtjhyB8xaa	You need to identify exactly what it is you fear. Then face it.|`|ZB8x6HOzaa	Do you know exactly what your fear is? Is it riding in general, or something specific? Some people are afraid of making errors and disappointing their trainers or parents. And some people are afraid of jumping fences. You can't begin to combat your fears until you know what specifically you're afraid of. Here are some tips that might relax you, though.<br>  <br>  When you start to feel nervous, close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Don't think beyond inhale and exhale. Try to feel where you keep your tension. If you've gotten sick from nerves, I'm guessing you tend to tense your stomach and abs. Try to focus on that, then try to clench and unclench your stomach. This should release some of your tension.<br>  <br>  Remember in your lessons that instruction is training. No one expects perfection. If we could all ride perfectly, trainers would be out of a job. Also remember that your trainer won't ask you to do anything she doesn't think you're capable of. If you're really doubting your ability in a certain exercise, tell your instructor. No one will hold it against you. You need to ride at your comfort level. As you become more confident, then you can start challenging yourself more. It's also important that when you go to a show, you compete in classes at one level beneath what you're currently schooling at home. If you're doing crossrails or low fences at home, stick to just flat classes at the show. If you're schooling at 2'6" don't show higher than 2' or 2'3". This way, you can enter the ring knowing you can do this because you've done more in the past.<br>  <br>  Above all, remember that riding is supposed to be fun. We ride for the love of the animal, and we show because of love of competition. Try to remember why you wanted to start riding in the first place. What do you love about the sport? Think about that when you start to get nervous.

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	What you are describing is called submissive urination.  It's a way the dog is showing that it is submissive to you.  Puppies and very young dogs do it the most - many outgrow it as they get older.  In the meantime, be very calm, quiet and gentle in handling him to avoid him feeling dominated.  Don't make big, noisy greetings, try not to get him overly excited and avoid situations that are loud or noisy or may scare him.  Socialize him slowly and gently to other people, dogs and situations.  And of course, give him lots of potty breaks.  Good luck.|`|algAgJsjaa	all small dogs pees its a way of life  my grandppl had a weene dog that peed when u walked in the dore but if u give him a treet every time hes exsited and dosent pee try that or make him go outside evry time he might get exsited|`|s5rhDARdaa	he should grow out of it.

AA11592942	yup he is mad at you. pick up anything on the floor you don't want him to mark on. When you come home check around the house and  If there is no pee. Say good dog and give a teat.

If you stick with it he should improve. Good luck.
AA10941321	no its not a hard question.its simple everyone shows their affection differently.some may just like to look at them some dont like to touch em but still love them.just not animal lovers doesnt mean they arent gonna miss that animal if they pass or are given way.|`|AA12260782	My mom did the exact same thing with my cat.  She hated that cat but cried like a baby when we had to put her to sleep, AND insisted we spend $200 dollars to have her ashes returned to us, even though I thought (and still think) that is so weird and a little creepy.<br>  <br>  I asked her and she said that we'd had her so long (16 years) that it seemed weird without her.  She said that she felt bad for me, (I adored that cat) and she wanted to be sure the cat didn't suffer.|`|FfBll2n8aa	Not everyone shows love for an animal in the same way. Some people are affectionate, and some just like having them around, without really showing it. Your mum might have put her attentions and devote her time to you first, and so didn't consider the dog to be such a priority, but it doesn't mean she didn't appreciate having him around in her own way. She might also have appreciated what the dog gave to you, and now that he's gone & you're upset, she's feeling guilty that you no longer have this special animal in your life.<br>  I think if you expect your mum to respect your feelings, then you need to do the same for her - just because she's your mum, doesn't mean she can't get upset just as much as you can, and it doesn't mean that your feelings are always more important than hers. Perhaps just tell her that talking about it right now upsets you, and you need some time to get over it before you can discuss the dog with her. If she knows that, she might talk to someone else less affected, about her feelings instead of you.|`|UEvifol9aa	get the dog back and they will be both happy: your mom & you dog|`|e6db26ce7d147355e062747c4ee178bfaa	My mom didn't want dogs either, but I convinced her to have dogs.

Went back the next day and adopted her own cat back again.. I guess you don't realize what you have until it's gone.. That's my only guess...|`|CWGkfXzyaa	I'll tell you why. People sometimes get pets on a whim and there is a lot more work to it than people think. She and other people who get pets sometimes don't know how to take care of them or are to lazy to figure out how, and guess who suffers??? THE PET. If the pet does something wrong it is not the pet's fault, it is the owner's fault. Why? Because they are animals and we take care of them, train them, feed them, love them. So if the pet misbehaves, it reflects the owner.<br>  <br>  Sometimes kids pressure their parents to getting a pet and it's the job of the kid to take care of the pet. Well, most kids can't even take care of themselves so the pet again suffers and the easiest thing to do for some people is to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  It is a travesty

You can post pictures of your cat so people can look at it and you can screen the people who are asking about them so you choose who they go to.|`|nc7NqJunaa	It is soo very hard to find homes for adult cats. I would try to find a place to live in that is cat friendly. If you can't then try to find a place in both places. You can also try to find a no kill shelter but space is limited and they would probably require a donation of sorts.
MoJ62nmJaa	Tell kitty no(even though cats arent big on listening), then move her off the couch when she does it.  Also make sure she has a scratching post or two, she needs to take care of her nails, thats why she does it.  If she doesnt like her scratching post at first try putting a little catnip on it!  If she continues with the behavior give her a little squirt with a spray bottle - kitty's DONT like this and she will probably take the hint! They also have sticky paws tape that wont ruin furniture . . . kitty's also dont like when their feet get stuck(check out petco's web site - they have the tape, scratching posts, and catnip) Sorry about your couch, good luck!|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	Try 2-sided sticky tape (available at pet stores or a store like Wal-Mart in the hardware section) or try aluminum foil.|`|88c46207ff36e3dbdbca2395f7a5ba61aa	Try  2 sided sticky tape and put it where she is scratching. They hate it.|`|B6WpOHBVaa	An easy way to get your cat to quit shredding your couch is to get another object to scratch. They do that to sharpen their claws. You can go your local wal-mart and get a card board scratching post, or a most efficient one, a carpet covered post.|`|PrWZCtvIaa	soft paws (www.softpaws.com) or look them up to see if you can find a site that is cheaper (it will only be cheaper by a couple of dollars though) Buy them in a color if you have young children so that you can spot them easily when they fall off. I used them on my cats and they work great, after a couple of minutes of them being on they stopped caring about them. If your cats aren't cooperative you will have to get a vet to put them on, otherwise they go on easily.<br>  <br>  My cats never cared to scratch anything but my couches or the carpet, they used the scratch posts to hold the carpet down. The training sprays that cats are supposed to hate only interested my cats more, they would smell it all day long and then as soon as I turn my back they would start scratching again. softpaws or softclaws made it so that they couldn't scratch.|`|db561933e34efdc35386c837182f9a1daa	There is a stay off spray that you can get at wal-mart that works wonders!|`|oQWvreCyaa	Get a large, heavy scratching post.  Taller than the cat will be at full growth, and heavy enough that kitty will not knock it over.  (Unfortunately, they are expensive, and don't go on sale often enough.)  Put it as close to the couch as you can.  Cats like to scratch as close to the center of activity as possible.  It's how they sharpen claws, and how they tell everyone that this is their home.  Put kitty on the post if she/he scratches the couch again.  Then scratch the post yourself, too.  Give her a crunchy treat that she likes either on the top of the post, or right after she/he uses the post.|`|1c0AwMscaa	put purse away|`|AA10174198	use to use a water pistol but better yet, use a can of compressed air with the stick on nozzle.|`|AFhYn73iaa	but a descent scratchy post and spray it with cat nip spray to encourage her to use it, tell her off in a firm tone when she scratches the coach, and praise her in a soothing tone when she uses the scratchy post.|`|BrgA5WX0aa	1.

f13986162646b06dd4d1bea7109438daaa	You can go to the vet and they can give you some sedation pills. <br>  <br>  You can also try this my vet told me. Try giving Benadryl (the 25mg Tablets) the dosage is 1mg per lb. So my 14lb dog gets 1/2 tablet. If any Q or doubt call your vet. Sometimes Benadryl can be harmful if your dog has underlying issues.<br>  <br>  Benadryl does the same as humans. It usually gets them sleepy but there is a small percentage that do the opposite. They get really exited. so Good luck.|`|0QsmAQBwaa	If all you are asking is about the move I suggest you get a car carrier for the trip.|`|31f737b74517df97b26d0c004900963caa	Well, you could try giving her a children's Benodryl to make her drowsy. That's what we do with our dogs to get them to sleep. Maybe if you gave it to her enough time in advance for it to go through her system she might be drowsy enough to not really care. Also if she's a big dog you can give her more than one.

Each step should take a week, and if the dog gets sick on a step, you need to back off to the previous step until he doesn't get sick.<br>  <br>  Put the dog in the car. Have a toy to keep the dog's mind off the car, but don't let him get too rowdy. <br>  Dog in the car, car started and running in driveway. <br>  Dog in the car, car started. Back down the driveway and then move back up the driveway (IF the dog hasn't gotten sick on the way down!) <br>  Dog in the car, take car around the block (shorten the trip for a week if even that is too much) <br>  Dog in the car, take car to local convenience store and back home (or any place close but farther than around the block with a couple of starts and stops along the way). <br>  Dog in the car, short trip (you decide the length based on how your dog is responding. <br>  Dogs who get car sick will especially benefit from either a crate (especially the more enclosed plastic crates) or a seatbelt (check your local pet shop for dog seat belts). These will limit unsteady movements. Keep in mind, dogs don't always vomit when they are car sick.

Your best bet is to get an orginization with an international focus involved. PETA is good sponsor or even another enviromental orginization. It would also help if you knew what kind of seals they are beating and which ones are on the endangered species act, because those are protected and cannot be killed by any means.

I don't think it's cataracts (I have a dog with a cataract from an injury she got before I received her). Take her to the vet who can more accurately determine what's going on.

grytfPQRaa	It is a common rememdy to use mothballs to keep pets off grass and other areas. But;<br>  <br>  Below copied from the Humane Society's website...<br>  <br>  quote:<br>  Moth Balls <br>  Moth balls are not actually used to kill moths, but rather contain a substance which is used to repel moths from your closets. Either naphthalene or para dichlorobenzene, can be used in moth balls, and both substances are toxic. This chemical tends to change it's state from a solid to a gas form very quickly. If inhailed it can be fatal, and if ingested moth balls are extremely harmful. Do not induce vomiting if ingested - rather drink plenty of water and consult a veterinarian as soon as possible. Moth balls can cause hemolytic anemia, a decrease in red blood cells, or the amount of hemoglobin the body produces. This can inhibit the blood from supplying the required amounts of oxygen to the body. Symptoms can include: weakness, lethargy, increased heart and respiration rate, pale mucous membranes, jaundice, vomiting and abdominal pain. Urine may also contain traces of blood.<br>  <br>  Keep your dog off your neighbors grass.<br>  Good luck!|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Yes it is! Your neighbor has a definite problem!|`|902e3fdce6460e40853f39e8ba2fa5e5aa	yes. it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia. the chemical naphthalene is toxic to dogs, and can cause tremors and seizures.|`|AA10168310	Mothballs are harmful to any living thing. Your neighbor is mean if he is the one who put them out there.|`|M1at6KE9aa	Mothballs are deadly.  If you ever see them again, call the police.  If you still have these, drop them in your neighbor's yard or better yet, hand them to him and say, "I believe these belong to you."  He will get the message.  I posted a link below with more information.|`|Q2EMt5p4aa	Yes it could make your dog sick.
1e7bc1f7de0f881c724d8790f3a287eeaa	Yes, its so horrible, i have two black labs and the only way we can tell of ticks is by sheer luck of running across one.<br>  <br>  You should get flea and tick stuff right off the batt for them and after taking them outside particularly near woody areas you need to give them a good patting and while your rubbing them see if you feel bumbs<br>  <br>  With mine its especially hard because they have scabs so i'm not sure if i'm pulling a scab or a tick, ug<br>  <br>  The one time i did find a tick with my naked eye was because it was on my dogs nose, i thought it was a mole or something at first but then decided to poke it with tweezers and it wasn't a mole so i pulled it out, sure enough it was a huge tick.<br>  <br>  Its alot eisier seeing infestations on lighter dogs but if you have tick and flea stuff for their coats then black labs should be fine.|`|sbwghhUpaa	Make sure that the dog is up to date with flea and tick meds.  Fleas and ticks can be seen on all dogs. big or small, dark or light|`|k5VlFHSZaa	I have a black lab and a yellow lab and have always been able to spot both fleas and ticks on both of them. The key is to use flea and tick meds (like Frontline or Advantage). If they are up to date on those, the pests should be very few to none. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned that your dog may have fleas and ticks, take a close look at it's fur. Rub it backwards and look for fleas, ticks, flea "dirt", etc and watch for lots of scratching on the dog's part due to the itch from bites. Keeping the animal groomed and bathed really helps ensure that you don't overlook something. Good luck!
n3Ylo56Waa	I've had hermit crabs and have also tried looking up an answer to this. <br>  <br>  Does the moldy area feel any different than the exoskeleton? Have you tried soaking the crab in warm water (make sure it doesn't drown, obviously ^.^;) Try gently rubbing a wet washcloth against the spot. Also, can you see any mold on the body within the shell? If "yes", then we've really got a problem, as that area is very vulnerable.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it spread from somewhere else in the cage. I know that hermit crab food tends to mold VERY quickly (esp if it gets damp or wet) I know petshops have different items to help a damaged turtle shell and the likes. Perhaps they have a product for hermit crabs...? Can't hurt to look around. <br>  <br>  If none of the above works, my suggestion is to google "hermit crab breeder" and find one you deem knowledgeable and email them for assistance. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

I have two hermit crabs of my own, so I will do my best to try to answer your questions! To try to get it off of his claw, get a little dish (not too deep!). Fill it with distilled water.

If this doesn't work, then try to get it off with a towel, after have taken that "bath." If the toothbrush worked, then great! Also, could you list all of things that are in your hermit crab's tank for me? That would be great, too! Also, what other types of food do you feed your hermit crab?

Play with him and pay lots of attention to him, he doesn't like being alone, neither would you.<br>  <br>  Try to get your family to let him back in the house and monitor his behavior so that he is welcome there.   Sounds as if some obedience training, you go take classes with the dog, would be good.|`|19d47e8f293e0b25e6346d7e02e94d3daa	Isolating the dog from the family was the absolute worst decision your parents could have made. As the adults, they should have taken the responsibility to properly train the dog to behave in the house. They could have at least hired a trainer to help them, which would have been very inexpensive, and it would have saved your family all this stress!! As a trainer, I can tell you that there is no such thing as a dog that is born and ready to behave properly in a house. Behaving properly in a house in something that the humans must train it to do. <br>  The first problem is that the dog should have had a crate inside the house. Anytime you left the house, he should have been taken outside to do his business, and then brought inside and placed in the crate with water and toys. He should also be given a treat as soon as he enters the crate (as a reward). I suggest you go back and do this, it is called "crate training." It is something you can do for a few months while the dog learns how to behave properly in the house. When you are in the house, though, the dog needs to be supervised the entire time so it can learn to behave. Anyway, crate training works, and thousands and thousands of other people do it successfully every single day. <br>  As far as being outside....he is tearing everything apart because he feels abandoned, which he essentially is. He has been secluded from the family, and as a result, he is bored, which results in destruction. If you are going to continue to keep him out there (which I 100% do NOT agree with), he needs social interaction with humans several times a day, he needs the appropriate amount of food and water, and he needs something to do so he won't be so bored. Try getting him some Kongs and filling them with peanut butter. They can keep him busy for hours. If kongs are too expensive, go to your grocery store, ask for beef bones, clean them out, and then proceed to use them (stuff them with peanut butter and such) just like you would a Kong. You can get several beef bones for only a few bucks. Also, you can buy treat-dispensing balls that will exercise him and entertain him. A treat ball at Wal-Mart only costs $6. <br>  In addition to keeping him entertained, you really just need to clear the backyard of anything he could destroy. If he is destroying things that cannot be moved, try spraying them with a hot sauce/hot pepper solution. When he tries to bite into it, it'll burn his mouth and deter him from engaging in that behavior in the future. If that doesn't work, however, your only option is to put an additional fence in your yard. Basically, fence-in a very large portion  of your yard (the majority of your yard). This additional fencing will completely keep him out of things he could destroy (for example, if he is ripping up your porch). He shoudl also have a dog house.<br>  I hope this helps a little, but again, I 100% feel that secluding a dog to the backyard is a bad idea. It only happens when people are too lazy to train their dog, and believe me, secluding your dog in the backyard will never result in a good situation. I highly suggest that you get a trainer. A trainer will be able to help solve this problem, assuming your parents will make the effort to train the dog. Trainers charge different amounts, some around me charge between 50-75 for the first consult, which may be up to 2 hours. At that point, follow-up sessions (if they are even needed) are usually cheaper, and many offer free email or telephone support. Please encourage your family to do this! It will save your family from future stress, and help give your innocent dog a chance|`|3cfc7c9347da69d91a3652d316d8e3aeaa	For digging holes- Fill it the holes holes with water and stick their nose in it for 10-15 seconds.

Do you take him on walks? Do you play games with him? I have a beagle puppy and she needs 2 walks a day and constant interaction before she's tired enough to nap and, thus, not destroy the house. <br>  <br>  If you and your sister really love your dog, you'll want to do whats best for him. Even if that means finding him a new home. Even if that means spending a couple of hours exercising or playing with him a day.|`|qjyNdFNNaa	"moving your dogs to backyard" is a beginning of possibly miserable end.<br>  Get some books and interest in proper training.<br>  So far people have been failing the dogs.|`|yeUMvmBoaa	You could try training him to go with you on a bike ride,  that way you can exercise him some more.<br>  <br>    You don't mention what kind of dog it is. Some breeds are just born to dig.  However, spending more time with the dog as much as possible is a good idea.  Does he have a doghouse or other sizeable shelter to stay cool during the summer?<br>  <br>   It is instinctive for a dog to dig very shallow holes in the shade and lie down on that to help them cool off on hot days.   I would be concerned that his behavior is a form of seeking shade and shelter.<br>  <br>   Other motivations could be that he is trying to hunt mice and other vermin outside, or engaging in anxiety chewing.<br>  <br>    I'd probably go outside and try and get him to dig in only one location-- call him away everytime he goes near the gutter or hose, etc.<br>  <br>   I also would see if you could buy a kong or bustercube and put food in it to keep the dog busier when you have to leave him at home during the day,   Also you can put out a soda bottle full of frozen ice to serve as a toy and a cooler for the dog.  (caution-- my dog tends to chew off the mouth of those, so I'd prefer to freeze a paper cup full of ice instead ).<br>  <br>    And I think I'd ask your parents how many things you've broken in your life.  And whether they'd get rid of you and your sister just for breaking something.  ; D.    Maybe you can get them to see a trainer or an animal behaviorist if you're really insistent they work the problem out.<br>  <br>    The reality is your dog is being a dog.  You can train a dog  ONLY when you are there to teach him what to do and not to do.  If the dog's alone outside, he doesn't know what is good to do.<br>  <br>   Dogs do shed a lot. That's how dogs are, but if the dog is brushed once a week or more, it really cuts down on the shedding!  For short-haired dogs like labs, you want a shedding glove.<br>  <br>   You could volunteer to help vaccum the living room every week if the dog is let inside at evening, or suggest confining the dog to part of the house so he doesnt shed everywhere.  Or suggest a K9 topcoat  (<a href="http://www.k9topcoat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9topcoat.com/</a> ) so he won't shed so much in the house.<br>  <br>     Good luck!   I know how deaf parents can be!

eBozBuraaa	those probably aren't guppies. i have only heard of guppies released in freshwater tropical reigons. i think those are mosquito fish or minnows. (mosquito fish are actually a different type of fish. i went to Petco and the lady told me about how she had 2 kinds of fish : guppy and mosquito. you can't really tell the difference. turns out, the two kinds of fish won't breed) <br>  guppies ususally eat small organisms in ponds or creeks. i think minnows and mosquito fish are the same. probably your best chance is feeding them mosquito larvae aka blookworms (you can get it in a petstore under the name of bloodworms). usually they are sundried. these bloodworms sometimes are too big depending on size so you might want to cut some. btw don't touch it, they are freaky lookin. <br>  anyways, you can feed it live bloodworms if you want. basically put creek/pond water in a container with some sort of object in it to cling on to. leave it outside and wait for the mosquitos to breed. when you see black wiggling stuff (wormlike) you can bring it to your fish. just make sure they finish all of it or else you might have unwanted house quests o.O <br>  btw: if you feed them dead/sundried bloodworms, make sure they eat that all up too. they won't come back to life but they smell when they are disintegrating. also, they cloud up the water. <br>  i assume they also eat algae. they can find it in their tanks.<br>  as they grow accustomed, you can try feeding it flake food. its basically packed with nutrients that they need (like algae). <br>  you can also try feeding them baby or adult brine shrimp. these can be found in petstores or you can raise your own. <br>  <br>  i'm bascically giving u want guppies would eat. plez don't kill me if they don't eat it.|`|488823611b3dd130eb3a102a9da58b4caa	unless you live in trinidad or antigua you shouldn't have guppies in your creek.  if you have minnows than they will eat just about anything.  you can feed them tropical fish food or most salad greens -- just boil the greens for a couple minutes so they are easier to eat.|`|n5ljE0kKaa	actually you find fish that look like guppies, w/o special colors tho. their called mosquito fish, the live bearer type. people buy them to control mosquito populations<br>  <br>  as for the food regular flake food will do or live insects<br>  <br>  but since its caught from the wild live food is best

It's one thing for someone to complain about something they feel is a disturbance (a neighbor can certainly call in a complaint for dog barking) but he CANNOT have your dog euthanized and, to be honest, most officials - if they even bothered to come out - would watch your dogs and see how much they DON'T bark and walk away.<br>  <br>  Dogs bark.  It happens.  It would be different if you left them out for hours and allowed them to do that, but A)you don't and B)they stop when commanded by you all.  There is nothing he can do.<br>  <br>  If it were me, if he ever said that again, I would look him straight in the eye and inform him that if he ever came on my property to harass me again I would have him arrested for trespassing AND harassment.  There's nothing he can do, but YOU can do something if you ever feel threatened by him.<br>  <br>  The only thing I would worry about is - seeing his obvious hatred for dogs - him somehow harming your dogs.  Keep an eye on them outside and don't leave them out when you're not there (not that you DO, but with someone that angry, you never know)  Seriously.|`|VtAiKvXiaa	no not at all, he is threatening you and you should not put up with it. he is new to the street and it trying to lay down the law, use this law against him if he or his partner are this hostile again,  report him for threatening you.<br>  get advice, from CAB OR SOLICITOR, this will prepare you if things continue.|`|iIBQ1Ye0aa	He's full of it,he can't have your dogs put down for barking,if they bit that's different,be careful about leaving them outside by themselves,in case he decides to poison them.call the police next time and tell them he is threatening you.if your other neighbors will back you up that your dogs are good that would help if you needed someone to back you up.these people are jerks and in the end karma will bit them.please be careful about your dogs you never know what they might do,i had a old neighbor put poisoned meat in my yard and my dog died because of it.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	he sounds like a idiot, i wouldnt even give him the time of day. though i would be quite tempted to report him to where he works as hes clearly threatening to abuse his position

1BFETOEpaa	"Chocolate contains theobromine. A naturally occurring stimulant found in the cocoa bean, theobromine increases urination and affects the central nervous system as well as heart muscle. While amounts vary by type of chocolate, it's the theobromine that is poisonous to dogs."<br>  Actually it depends on the dog.  My toy poodle ate about 1/2 pound of milk chocolate one day when I was at work, and survived to tell the tale.  Though she had been sick a number of times and drunk a lot of water, and when I got home, I made her get up and walk for about 10 minutes, though I did not know that chocolate was poisonous, then.  I suspect that she may have inoculated herself against the effects because several years later she consumed another about 6 oz at one sitting, and was not even sick.  Yes, I was careless, and it does horrify me that she could well have died because of it, but, at the time, I did not know that chocolate was toxic to dogs.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Dogs cannot digest it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogtopics.com/165/7-questions-about-dogs-and-chocolate/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogtopics.com/165/7-questions...</a> - 35k|`|VtAiKvXiaa	not poisonous,just the sugar rots their teeth and the milk content can upset their stomach not to mention all the e-numbers added etc. you can buy dog chocolate that is not as rich in these ingredients.|`|mMXLve9Maa	Theobromine.<br>  <br>  Apparently dogs have a bad reaction to this chemical. Large amounts can be deadly to dogs; small amounts can make them sick. |`|wnknEcTbaa	i think?|`|NAGiNKFWaa	There is a lot of information on the following web site....<br>  www. missouri scenic rivers .com/ bad dog foods .html <br>  They explain and have a lot of information on this for you.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	The truth is chocolate contains theobromine that is toxic to dogs in sufficient quantities. This is a xanthine compound in the same family of caffeine, and theophylline.<br>  <br>  Toxic Levels<br>  <br>  The good news is that it takes, on average, a fairly large amount of theobromine 100-150 mg/kg to cause a toxic reaction. Although there are variables to consider like the individual sensitivity, animal size and chocolate concentration.<br>  <br>  On average,<br>  Milk chocolate contains 44 mg of theobromine per oz.<br>  Semisweet chocolate contains 150mg/oz.<br>  Baker's chocolate 390mg/oz.<br>  <br>  Using a dose of 100 mg/kg as the toxic dose it comes out roughly as:<br>  1 ounce per 1 pound of body weight for Milk chocolate<br>  1 ounce per 3 pounds of body weight for Semisweet chocolate<br>  1 ounce per 9 pounds of body weight for Baker's chocolate.<br>  <br>  So, for example, 2 oz. of Baker's chocolate can cause great risk to an 15 lb. dog. Yet, 2 oz. of Milk chocolate usually will only cause digestive problems. <br>  <br>  Clinical Signs<br>  <br>  Xanthines affect the nervous system, cardiovascular system and peripheral nerves. It has a diuretic effect as well. Clinical signs: <br>  <br>  Hyper excitability <br>  Hyper irritability <br>  Increased heart rate <br>  Restlessness <br>  Increased urination <br>  Muscle tremors <br>  Vomiting <br>  Diarrhea<br>  <br>  Treatment<br>  <br>  There is no specific antidote for this poisoning. And the half life of the toxin is 17.5 hours in dogs. Induce vomiting in the first 1-2 hours if the quantity is unknown. Administering activated charcoal may inhibit absorption of the toxin. An anticonvulsant might be indicated if neurological signs are present and needs to be controlled. Oxygen therapy, intravenous medications, and fluids might be needed to protect the heart.<br>  <br>  Milk chocolate will often cause diarrhea 12-24 hours after ingestion. This should be treated symptomatically (fluids, etc..) to prevent dehydration.<br>  <br>  If you suspect your pet has ingested chocolate contact your Vet immediately! They can help you determine the the proper treatment for your pet.<br>  <br>  
cfCoIgoRaa	several suggestions.:<br>  she may have become overwhelmed with the move and new family situation. she may just need some time alone.<br>  <br>  roll her over and see if her nipples are red or swollen.<br>  <br>  I found out about this yesterday and wanted to pass this along. A friend of mine told me that within a week of being bred, the females' vulva will appear "blue-ish" on the end, and even can have a "blue-ish ring" around the vulva. I checked my girl, and sure enough. I called my vet, talked to the vet tech to pose my question, then the vet got on the phone with a single word- " CONGRATULATIONS!". I asked the reasoning in this occurance and she said that when the cervix starts to close ( indication of present of pregancy) the change in the blood circulation from the vulva to the cervix is why this occurs. Although only obvious with females that have a light colored vulva ( Borzois do- sheperds did not and probably why I never noticed), it becomes more obvious. <br>  Considering that although the assumption is made the female could be pregnant, its nice to know earlier than the 28 day palpate that this has occured. While not all females show this, it is more common than not. The vet also said that the pressence of a blue-ish vulva, when a owner comes in asking for the " abort shot", the vet knows that it is too late and the dog is already pregnant. <br>      |`|AqlpRZCiaa	yes my friend I think it's pregnant.....to reassure you can press her **** from the base to the end and milk will come out...based on my personal experience I going to advice you that you have to supply it with plenty of water.<br>  Let it make her "nest" give her old blankets or towels where she decides to give birth.<br>  If you want to help her on labor, just be patient... there is an interval of 3-7 minutes within each of the newborns...<br>  you will see that they will come out from the vagina like <br>  wrapped-sausage and you will notice when is the last one because the biggest part of the placenta will come out too.<br>  Do not touch them....Let their mother lick them a lot.... The dog also will eat its placenta that will help her on nursing process. <br>  Do not worry if the dog leaves the "nest" for a while... it means that she needs to walk for stimulating others beneath her to come out.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	vet check|`|4NMtgOU4aa	She could absolutely be pregnant.

FUr6ypu1aa	once a day|`|kRP9hJWEaa	Once a day is fine. Goldfish are cold blooded, so they don't need to eat as much (as often) as we do.  <br>  <br>  Feed them as much as they can completely consume in five minutes. They may look hungry, but Goldfish are ALWAYS hungry. They will eat until they (literally) explode. They will consume as much food as you can give them. So you have to be careful not to overfeed. <br>  <br>  Flake food is good enough, but if you can find it, pellet food is better. Pellet food will not pollute the water, and has more nutritional value than flake food. They do sell goldfish pellet food at most  major pet stores. Koi pellet food will work just as well. Just make sure the pellets are small enough for the fish to swallow. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754929" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  (Dont worry too much about breed the food is for...Oranda food will work fine for Lionheads or Common goldfish alike)|`|AA11881748	Keep this in mind: goldfish have been known to eat themselves to death.  They also are very messy eaters and put out a lot of waste.  They should be fed once a day with a fast of an entire day once a week.  Only feed them as much as they can eat in about 2 minutes.  |`|AA11044738	once a day will do, overfeeding would do more harm than good to aquarium fishes. kb|`|0G6RGKgvaa	I'd say twice a day. Once in the morning, then again at night. They should be okay with that. =D|`|LO4Az4zOaa	2-4 times a day|`|3iztG2PAaa	2-3 times not to much. Goldfish will eat as much as you give them.

Fish can sustain a long period of time without food but be careful not to over feed them and make sure them have proper oxygen in the tank.

f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	It's a form of submission.. |`|AA10554783	They like the taste of salt from your body.|`|XEbe4Votaa	It's not a nasty dog habit at all, but it's not showing love necessarily, either.<br>  <br>  Dogs often greet each other this way.  You will usually see the submissive dog licking the mouth of the dominant dog.  It roughly translates to "hello, I missed you, and I know you rank higher than me".<br>  (If my younger dog and I go somewhere without my older dog, when we return she will greet him in exactly this manner)<br>  <br>  Tongue flicking and compulsive licking can also be a nervous reaction.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	When I used to talk to my little baby she looked me in the eye...looked like she was listening and replied with a lick or two. I really really think they do it out of love. My dog (when she was little...) used to go and lick my brother for 10 min and didn't stop...i'm sure it was the salty taste lol...but in general i believe they really do understand and care and know what a "kiss/lick" means. |`|VxKH7KHmaa	Its a submissive form of showing you respect, asking for forgivness. <br>  Its a dogs way of saying "I come in peace, please don't hurt me"|`|DeaRdZV0aa	its a form of submission and showing love|`|zsE96IHkaa	It can actually mean a lot of things. Here are some reasons<br>  1) it's grooming you (this would most times be if she thinks your dominant, but a lot of times it is love)<br>  2) you taste good, yum! Just kidding. But you might taste like salt.<br>  3) They're saying sorry for something they did<br>  4) They're just checking you out<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|26keippWaa	Well in packs, the subordinate dogs will lick the face of the dominant dog.. mothers will like pups, etc.  So it's definitely a demonstration of affection, not just a bad habit.  Although some dogs do get out of hand!|`|AA10897607	It`s the same as when they lick their puppies. It`s for groming. |`|oU3nQ7Bfaa	They do it for 2 reasons. They love you and they like the salty taste|`|mTt0YW3Taa	nether its just cleaning it tongue on you lol

CNJyyYIpaa	Have you shared your food with him before? He is probably thinking you are going to share with him every time you eat. Either that or what you are eating smells very good to him.

I love my cats.|`|jSZTXsJjaa	many dogs will also do that.  the reason is because. they consider themselves equal to you not just some pet.  so when they see you eating they assume it is meal time. so they try to eat just as you are doing |`|31b9d943eeebee817b486384aaf5dc76aa	My female cat does that, too.

1FZtoOWhaa	if possible...get your vet or a breeder to help.  Kits, especially new ones are very difficult to keep alive.  And it sounds like mom isn't helping.

I'm sorry to here of your trouble with your rabbit.<br>  <br>  If your doe is a week late (are you sure of the dates - 31 days for aa rabbit) it is unlikely that the babies may survive.<br>  <br>  You say that one of the babies has already disappeared - this may be due to the fact that mum may have eaten it (horrible I know but it does happen).<br>  <br>  With the babies being wrinkly - this means that she has not fed them at all.  She may seem to have milk but she more than likely does not<br>  <br>  It is very difficult to feed new born baby rabbits as there is a likelyhood of you drowning them by giving the milk to quickly - if you can get them to feed at all.<br>  <br>  I am affraid it is up to "mother nature" as to whether they survive or not.<br>  <br>  Touching the babies too much in the first 48 hours may cause the mother to reject them.  I handle them once in the first 4 days, and that is only to make sure they have all there limbs and are ok.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Heather

You need to make sure all of your family understand that you decide what food your dog is fed and that they should ask you before even thinking about feeding anything different.  As for the stomach upset it should be fine in a few hours if she is just fed what she is used to.

During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums. Lacking opposable thumbs, puppies also use their mouths to catch, carry, and play, making it all the more crucial that they learn how to control themselves in the presence of human skin. <br>  here's a treatment:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/biting-and-mouthing.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/biting-and-mouthing.h...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|EibnoZUPaa	His teeth aren't becoming sharp.  They're just his puppy teeth.  They'll fall out and he'll grow his adult teeth in at some point.  He's not aggressive either, don't make the mistake of labeling him aggressive.  He's just a playful puppy and you have not learned how to communicate to him that mouthing is an unwanted behavior.  Take your puppy to a basic puppy class and learn how to handle him.  <br>  <br>  For starters, just ignore & stop playing with him when he puts his mouth on you and reward when he does not.  Also play with him using toys, not your hands.|`|LGpv2grIaa	Be gentle with your pup and be sure not to scare her by yelping too loudly when she nips and bites.

Puppy biting is a normal and natural puppy behavior. In fact, it is the pup that does not mouth and bite much as a youngster that augers ill for the future. Puppy play-biting is the means by which dogs learn to develop bite inhibition, which is absolutely essential later in life.<br>  <br>  The combination of weak jaws with extremely sharp, needle-like teeth and the puppy penchant for biting results in numerous play-bites which, although painful, seldom cause serious harm. Thus, the developing pup receives ample necessary feedback regarding the force of its bites before it develops strong jaws – which could inflict considerable injury. The greater the pup’s opportunity to play-bite with people, other dogs and other animals, the better the dog’s bite inhibition as an adult. For puppies that do not grow up with the benefit of regular and frequent interaction with other dogs and other animals, the responsibility of teaching bite inhibition lies with the owner.<br>  <br>  Certainly, puppy biting behavior most eventually be eliminated: we cannot have an adult dog playfully mauling family, friends and strangers in the manner of a young puppy. However, it is essential that puppy biting behaviour is gradually and progressively eliminated via a systematic four-step process. With some dogs, it is easy to teach the four phases in sequence. With others, the puppy biting may be so severe that the owners will need to embark on all four stages at once. However, it is essential that the pup first learn to inhibit the force of its bites before the biting behaviour is eliminated altogether.<br>  <br>  . . . PLEASE VISIT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE TO FINISH THE ARTICLE. :-)|`|jyVCzVlDaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Begin by substituting your hands, fingers, feet, and toes with chew treats and toys when you want to pet him, inspect his fur, or play. Children should also be taught this method. When you reach out to pet your pup or give him a scratch, have a toy or chew treat in the other hand to offer him. This way, he will direct his chewing and biting onto the object rather than your hand.<br>  <br>  Switch the hand with the toy in it often so he won't anticipate which hand it is in and make a leap at it. The idea is to show the puppy that people and petting are good things, and so are chewies or toys! Start off slowly and keep the time short. As you pet or scratch him, his excitement will build and he'll switch to your hand if you go too long.<br>  <br>  Training your pup that the family's body parts are off limits doesn't stop with petting and substituting. He's happy, he wants attention, he grabs your sock in his mouth and a couple toes in the process...OUCH!<br>  <br>  As soon as that nip happens, face your pup and yell "OUCH!" Let him know that hurts; whine and cry and whimper...and then turn your back and ignore him. Pay no attention until he calms down. Only then can you give him a toy or chew treat and pet him.<br>  <br>  Check out this link to get more helpful tips:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/puppy-biting-jumping-up-hsus.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/puppy-biting-jumping-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this one helps.|`|A5zgb2U6aa	I don't know how effective it is, but there is this spray stuff that you put on your hand and it isn't sticky and doesn't smell bad, but when the dog bites your hand, they will not like the taste of it and it's supposed to make them not want to bite you.|`|0XVmuw15aa	Pinch him in the ear everytime he bites then put him a a kenel for 5-15 minutes.

ynEdpoj8aa	He fears you controlling his neck and is telling you that he doesn't want you to do it.  There is no reason he should be doing that.  You need to work with him while he is calm and relaxed by using his collar to lead him around.  If he does the same on a leash, just keep a leash on him so you can lead him anywhere at anytime without putting your hands at risk.  This dog has trust/fear issues.  If you feel like you may get bit find a professional trainer.  Obedience classes would help as he would get used to relying on you with others around.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	In the wolf world, grabbing the scruff of the neck (or anything on/around the neck) is looked upon as a threat for the dog.<br>  <br>  NEVER - EVER - EVER hold your dog on the ground for ANY reason.

It never makes sense to just keep masking a problem, if you haven't solved the underlying cause.<br>  <br>   It could be a number of things, starting with a food allergy, as well as a localized infection caused by a weakened immune system (or secondary to the allergy), and the other possibility that must be noted is that if she is a large breed like a Great Dane, or a Doberman, also make sure they check her heart.  Heart problems can cause a lack of circulation in the paws, which make them tingle - and a dog's reaction to that is to chew on them.  She should also have her thyroid checked.<br>  <br>    Whatever the cause, bolstering her immune system with some antioxidants and omega-3 (fish oil) supplements will probably help, which you should discuss with your new vet.|`|WTwMFC7saa	Your dog is extraordinarily anxious. You could be doing something to encourage this. Are you taking her for daily walks? Have you tried rawhide dog bones for her to chew on? You have to look at the overall picture. These dogs are anxious anyway. Is there a change in the environment? Check Cesar Milan's website for problem issues.|`|CBVHd3eHaa	mine does too! we just would spray them with bitter apple and she would stop. i am guessing it was allergies for my dog because she only does it in the spring. she is allergic to grass. my other dog is too and he will nonstop lick his paws. you can get some allergy pills for her|`|hB1SkPqRaa	If it is allergies the vet should have at least recommended finding out what she is allergic to so that you can try to eliminate it from her diet or surroundings. Also an antihistamine could be used. Allergies don't "just clear up" unless the source is eliminated. If her feet are raw then you probably need a repeat visit or a second opinion from another vet. |`|c9cea2703c41c34aabc96c549171890aaa	Try another vet! Most allergies can be dealt with, often with an exclusion diet and/or tests, a vet might put her on steroids to give her body a chance to get over the itching..<br>  <br>  Or it could be that your dog has just got into the habit through anxiety, in which case you would need to find a good behaviourist to try to work through it.

bPdqwkpPaa	Best to contact breed rescue RIGHT NOW and get him into a new home while he's still young enough to be easily placed. <br>  <br>  It's obvious that your mom thinks that animal are disposable and wants nothing to do with them.  NO animal should be in your home.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> should be able to put you in touch with some no-kill shelters that can help get him into a FAR better home. |`|Pi8KfmOxaa	im really sorry but that really doesnt sound a good environment to bring a dog up in, hes a puppy a baby no wonder hes scared. you have to keep taking him outside to get a routine going ,leaving newspaper or puppy pads by the back door in case of accidents|`|86vG0vKfaa	Your mother  must be smoking crack. It takes time and effort to train a puppy to only use the bathroom outdoors. A month is a unrealistic expectation. My German Shepard is 5 months old (yesterday) and she still has accidents in the house, but she's almost there. Maybe in a another month or so. You and your mother don't need to have any animals in your house. Animals are part of your family, not expendable objects. There's the help you asked for. Find a better home for your puppy now by selling it or giving it away. There are plenty of no-kill shelters you could take it to, or find a responsible friend that needs a friend.|`|UPTu7uIVaa	That's terrible.  Did she want to get rid of you before you were potty trained all the way?  We have a golden retriever puppy, who is nearly 6 months old, got him when he was 2 months old, and he was not fully potty trained until about 4.5 months.  I think that is terrible.  Your puppy is still a baby.  It takes them a long time to learn things like that.  And you may have to try a new method if he is scared of the bell.  Our dog just goes to the door when he wants out.  You just have to take him outside often so he figures out that outside is where he is supposed to do his business.  And yes, our dog was whipped when he pottied in the house.  I don't think its cruel (and don't care if anyone else does).  You don't have to beat the snot out of them.  I was whipped as a kid, probably turned out to be a better person for it.  He has to understand going inside is unacceptable but he has to be old enough to grasp it.  You should not have gotten a puppy if you did not want to deal with puppy issues.  Next time go to a shelter and get a housebroken dog so that you don't have to do the dirty work.|`|Bw18seFqaa	If he's scared of it, then dont push the issue on ringing the bell.. he will learn another method to ask to go out, or its something you can teach him later after you've got the concept of pottying outside down.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, supervise him closely and take him out well before he needs to go!  When you cant supervise, crate him.  praise like crazy when he potties outside.<br>  <br>  If you catch him making a mess, tell him "NO" firmly, then take him outside and praise once outside, even if he dribbled thru the house on your way to the door!<br>  <br>  If you find a mess, smack yourself for not supervising him close enough!<br>  <br>  Clean up all messes with a good cleaner that's meant for pet messes and be sure to remove all traces of odors.|`|g21KwuT8aa	dont do that. don't try to scare him. what you need to do is look for signs that he needs to go like sniffing around floor and i think circling around. when he's done peeing OUTSIDE, say good boy and feed him a treat. do this everytime and he will kno from the treat that what he's doing is a good thing and will constantly do it |`|uZyr6YmVaa	I hope you are kidding me. You arent going to be able to train your dog to ring a bell when it needs to pee. Thats insane. You can on the other hand train it to "hold it" until it is walk time and to go then. And even the best trained dog is eventually going to have a mistake in the house every now and then. <br>  Maybe you should go ahead and sell the puppy now before it gets attached to you, it really doesnt sound like to me that you are dog people. |`|3KSJslMMaa	I seriously hope this is not a real post and your mother isn't that cruel. Not very many animals are smart enough to ring a bell, especially when YOU and your MOM aren't real dog trainers. Take the dog to a specialized trainer if you want to keep him. But if you guys have such high expectations of any animal, you don't need any animals. That is cruel. If you can't afford a trainer or regular vet visits, you have no business owning any animals. Sell or give away your dog, he will be better off. |`|3GzFSIN3aa	If the bell scares him it is not going to work right away.  A puppy needs to be excited about something to learn, not afraid.  First train him to only pee outside, even if he has to scratch at the door, then try to train him to let you know some other way, that way he already knows what going to the door means.  <br>  There are some great training guidelines on the websites below.  |`|5XlZAZWMaa	come on now seriously get him to ring a bell?? that's just a bit stupid paper train him first and bring him out about 2 or 3 times a day and have patience, dogs cant control their bladder until they are six months so accidents can happen to the best trained puppy. But soon after wards they will give signs that they want to go out to go to the toilet like going near the door or dragging your coat to you but it takes time so have patience and avoid the bell|`|VtAiKvXiaa	if he is scared of it he wont do it, don't you think if he is a pup going to the door should be good enough. open the door he is potty trained.<br>  if you have to have the bell make it more fun , run to door , ring bell , get food, go for p.  get lots of attention.puppy's like games.|`|FdcWPp48aa	If your mother feels like that then it would probably be better for the dog to have a new home.  Sorry, but puppies are not robots.  It takes a lot of work to raise them properly.  <br>  <br>  House Training<br>  <br>  <br>  House training your dog is simple if you follow a few basic rules. Remember that puppies younger than 10 to 12 weeks have little control. Accidents will always happen when teaching puppies to be clean in the house. Be kind and patient, and reward handsomely all outdoor elimination. Always remember that dogs do what works for them. Make outdoor pottying work really well for your puppy.<br>  <br>  <br>  1) The puppy must have NO time unsupervised in your home. NONE. If you are not directly watching the puppy, it should be in the crate, or outside in a safe area. You MUST watch the puppy at ALL times when loose in the house. Use baby gates, crates, or tie the leash to your belt.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The puppy should sleep inside the crate by your bedside. This way you can hear if the puppy should happen to need to go out during the night.<br>  <br>  <br>  3)  You must go WITH the puppy outside for ALL trips for elimination. You must have treats with you. When the puppy is urinating, say "GO PEE PEE" in a nice praise tone of voice the entire time. When she is finished, pop the treat into her mouth at once, and praise praise praise. This should be something she gets at no other time, like tiny pieces of string cheese or boiled chicken. Same for defecation. Say "GO POOP" while she is going, and food reward and praise afterwards. You must observe and reward ALL outdoor potty time. <br>  <br>  4) Keep a schedule. Feed at the same time, and walk outside at the same times. Your pup needs at least 4 trips outdoors each day, and 5 is probably better. Pup needs to go out at wake up time, lunch time, 4-5 PM, after dinner or any other meals, and before bed. Younger puppies may need to go out much more often.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Use a key word each time you go out. I say "Let's go out!!" in a happy tone of voice each time I'm opening the door to go out with the dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) If you catch the puppy IN THE ACT of eliminating in your house, CLAP YOUR HANDS, say AH AH, OUTSIDE!! And immediately rush her outside. If she finishes there, do your usual food reward and praise.<br>  <br>  <br>  The keys to getting your dog reliably housetrained are:<br>  <br>  <br>  SUPERVISION: NO loose time in the house if you are not watching<br>  <br>  <br>  REWARDS: ALL outdoor elimination MUST be observed and rewarded. If you only do this ONE thing, your puppy will get housetrained.<br>  <br>  <br>  PATIENCE: Anger and punishment have no place in dog training. Elimination is a natural and pleasurable experience for your dog. You can teach her to not soil your house, but punishment will NOT help. It will only teach the dog to hide when she needs to eliminate.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have applied these techniques carefully for 4 weeks and you are still finding spots or piles after the fact, it's time for stronger measures. Roll up a newspaper and fasten both ends with a rubber band. Keep it handy. The very next time you find a spot of a pile that the dog has left behind, whip out that newspaper, and hit YOURSELF over the head firmly several times as you repeat "I FORGOT TO WATCH MY PUPPY".<br>  <br>  <br>  Works every time.<br>  <br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  This article copyright 2004/2007, RedyreRottweilers. Free for unlimited distribution as long as copyright info remains intact.<br>  |`|c15rWijuaa	Try teaching him a touch a target. After most dogs learn to touch a target for a treat they can be taught to touch other things.<br>  <br>  First start out with a lid from a sour cream, butter, or cottage cheese bowl. Have someone put a yummy treat on it (hot dogs are usually the best, they have a strong aroma) and just walk him up to it, when he eats the treat say "Yes!" and walk away from it telling him he's a good boy. Do this multiple times, until he is going directly to the target for the treat. <br>  <br>  Now you'll want to introduce the cue word "Touch". When he's on his way to the target, say "Touch" (or any other word you want to use), and again when he eats the treat, tell him "Yes!". Do this five or six times.<br>  <br>  Now you up the ante, try doing it with out a treat already on the target. When you say "touch" and he goes to the target and his nose goes down or he looks at it, say "Yes!" and put a treat on the target for him to eat. Repeat till he's got a clear idea of what you want him to do. They usually catch on pretty quickly if you practice daily.<br>  <br>  After he's got that down, see if he'll touch the bell on your cue. If it's the sound he's afraid of, try holding it still so that it makes minimal sound (you can cover it with your hand) and asking him to "Touch" and if he touches it give him a treat. When he's touching the bell like he was the target, see if he'll do it while it makes a little noise. And just repeat until he's able to touch it while it's making noise.<br>  <br>  Now that you have THAT. You still need to teach him to do it when he has to go right? Well, you'll have to take him out on a schedule (once you wake up, after breakfast, every hour/two hours depending on his age and so on), so before you take him out to potty ask him to touch the bell, and then take him out. He should eventually associate nose touching the bell with going out to potty.<br>  <br>  Also, you should try to explain to your mom that he just a baby, and it will probably take more than a month to get him going outside on a regular basis with no accidents.. I mean she didn't give you a time limit to learn how to use the toilet right? She shouldn't give the puppy one, specially since it's not fair to him. If she's worried about the smell or stains, she can buy a product called Nature Miracle, it available at Petsmart or Petco. It completely eliminates odors and stains.

DNehnacoaa	Lol, it's not.<br>  <br>  Dogs will just eat and eat and eat, then they'll throw up if they eat too much. Chances are at that point they'll probably eat their vomit back up.<br>  <br>  Just feed your dog the appropriate ammount of food according to it's breed, size and age. <br>  <br>  If you're genuinly concerned, speak to a vet|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well there could be 100 reasons, take your dog to the vet for a check up.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	he might not be getting enough fiber in his food causing him to be hungry all the time or worms or a tape worm can make him hungry.if he is drinking lots of water and constantly eatting with out weight gain u should have his blood checked out for sugar since this can be a sign of diabetes.feed him a little more fiber like added veggis and oatmeal or put a 1/2 tsp of fiber powder in his food and see if it helps fill him up.u can feed him small portions several times a day to curb his appitite if all checks out with the vet and maybe he is just nautrally hungry and u will have to bulk up his food. check with ur vet to rule out any problems and then u will know how to get him settled into a regular meal schedule. good luck|`|VtAiKvXiaa	your dog is not hungry, dogs will eat what ever they can ,the more you give ,the more they eat. try doing something else like taking it out for a walk, playing fetch to relieve its boredom. and take its mind of the food.<br>  also regulate feeding times for your dog it will then learn that it gets fed at a certain time of day only. also try not to feed it at your meal time, and ignore it if it begs. set down some rules.|`|755cf75fb142bff521ea16c847c145fcaa	Don't worry about it, my puppy would not eat at all and after 2 weeks she has settled down and began to eat.

Your puppy will settle, a dog will never starve if the food is there so just keep giving it the right amound and it will settle down.|`|iikdZKO7aa	It may have worms. If your dog has not been treated for worms you should treat it.

2802aec61549e3d8892bc0acaa82f943aa	In general: No.<br>  <br>  There are a number of Goldfish characteristics that make them unsuitable for coexisting with tropical fish. Goldfish have been bred for many years to have deformities which make them inefficient swimmers, and this makes it difficult for them to compete with most tropicals who are not that far removed from the wild stock. They're subject to having all of their food stolen away, or their fins nipped, or just plain abused (and killed) by other fish labeled 'Semi-aggressive' like angelfish. <br>  <br>  Goldfish also prefer cooler waters than most tropicals. There are a few 'tropical' fish that like cooler waters, but some have quirks that make them undesirable for keeping with goldfish.<br>  <br>  Goldfish also grow larger than a lot of small community fish: this is something you need to watch out for anyway, but many 'community' tanks have a lot of small fish like guppies or danios. Larger fish will eat whatever will fit in their mouths :)<br>  <br>  It's funny to see someone who has 'years and years' of experience say 'It's absolutely fine!!!!' when in fact the issue is complicated and in no way 'clean-cut'.|`|AA11901352	This really depends on a few things.  Fancy goldfish can survive in warmer waters on a regular basis vs. comets or commons and can get along well with tropical fish.  Then again some fish listed as tropical are really not tropical fish at all.  Yes some goldfish are perfectly capable of living with fish that are classified as tropical but really aren't <br>  <br>  What did you have in mind?|`|u7G6qolYaa	Yes it is totally fine to do that although it will take up space in your tank so you will have to be careful. Goldfish are also very dirty fish so do recommend cleaning your tank often (like at least once a week), keeping it away from the window, and make sure that you only mix your gold fish with community not semi Agg. or Agg. Defiantly add a condition or that you can get from your local pet store or online. You can clean the bottom by siphoning water out of the tank while diging in the gravel and that should clean your tank. You can clean the tank wall sith a magnent cleaner. Well I hope I was a help in every way possible. i will try to answer any other q's you might have.<br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|oaUelbqKaa	No, absolutely not.  Goldfish need colder water, and are best kept only with other goldfish in very large, well-filtered tanks.|`|vwabAIxBaa	no you cant do that.<br>  goldfish like coldish water, and tropical fsh need warm water at 82 degrees, so it wouldnt be ideal at all.|`|YpotOBZmaa	tropical fish have warm water and most goldfish like cold water so i don't think you should|`|6b0dc652367cfa3098f074b2af0128c6aa	I've never had a problem with it ... watch out for fin nippers tho.

Puppies will start setting at a young age for you.|`|KnQ8VnKvaa	They should if you properly monitor their time together and socialize them with people and other animals. Are you sure you want to undertake 2 pups at the same time? Please think of not just the amount of time and energy but the financial end too.

ktC40jtXaa	I have had Labs all my life (yellow) .. and we have never had a problem with them....they are by far one of the greatest breeds! They are very Intelligent, obedient, and great with other pets and children. You wont regret being the owner of a lab!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Labs are great dogs, but you have to start training at a young age and be consistent.  They grow up fast and if not trained will be a holy terror as they have a puppy mind in a big dog's body.|`|6BbxYP8vaa	Labs are very intelligent and fantastic family dogs, however young labs are extremely active, which can make them difficult to train.  I would suggest enrolling the puppy in training classes from a very young age if you are unaccustomed to training this breed.  Furthermore, realize, that all puppies, especially puppies of sporting or working breeds, can be destructive.  Give your puppy an outlet... regular outside playtime with family members, and it might be a good idea to invest in a crate to keep the puppy in when no one is at home.  Unfortunately, often the more intelligent a dog is, the more likely it will get bored and get itself into trouble when no one is around to play with.|`|A21SswSfaa	That all depends on the dog's breeding, training, and personality. You can get an indication of what the puppy will be like from looking at its parents, but you can never tell. Lab puppies are a handful, even for puppies. Most labs I know are wild, crazy creatures until 3-4 years of age. They're good dogs as long as they get regular exercise and training.|`|spHIBZwFaa	Labs are energetic, fun loving, great with families, and normally easy to train. Be prepared for a dog that is always hungry and will act like a puppy until they are older and not able to anymore. Great dogs in all. We have an 11 year old Blk Lab here. You would think we never feed him! lol  Just dont fall for it, weight issues can be very bad for them in their later years.|`|ggWzQkqzaa	they're evrything you think and more, thats why they're the most popular breed in the world, hav u ever heard bad reps about labradors - cuz i havn't . he's so cute n makes me laugh all the time|`|itxWU5HOaa	Man...My beagle bassat hound is dumber than his sh*t and my BL pup is so cute and intelligent..he likes to bring me things in his mouth.<br>  <br>  Most pups cant hold the bladder for the 1st 6 months..so no punishment..you wouldnt spank your child because they wet their diaper would you?<br>  <br>  NO<br>  and if you can > "click" your tounge when you teach em something, followed by a treat.<br>  Eventually cut out the treats to every other time,and he'll start to preform with just the "click" of your tongue.<br>  <br>  If you cant "click " your tongue, just buy a "clicker" at a pet supply plus store.<br>  <br>  Just give em love, de-worm em for the 1st year, get a Parvo vacanation and a yearly rabies, his 6-way and any other shots he might need.<br>  <br>  After the first years set(and de worming), he only need the distemperment(rabies)and 3-way, once a year.<br>  <br>  BTW all puppies get worms..its something to do with bacteria or some shi7..so dont buy HARTZ..cuz its weak shi7, go with something that cost like 30-80 dollars to ensure the dont come back..a good product is "Worm-X"|`|2OVUgPfyaa	Labs are wonderful family dogs.

y5CsUK0uaa	take her to your vet ASAP. it could be something simple like parasites or change in food, but it could also be the beginning of parvo and if so, the earlier you catch it, the more likely she is to survive it. there are some wicked fatal doggie diseases out there so i wouldn't hesitate to bring her in as soon as you can get her in, especially if things get worse at all. and if it turns out to be an infectious disease like parvo or corona, contact the place you got her from - they need to know to quarantine their kennel & treat their animals too.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Take a stool sample to the vet and have it tested for worms/ parasites..

MGAmNxddaa	If this is a puppy,under 3 months old,make sure you buy a puppy shampoo.No matter WHAT age the dog is,do NOT over bathe him/her.The more you bathe a dog,the more you dry out their skin and create more problems.And it will cost you more in the end.I have chihuahuas and Shar Peis and I bathe them twice a year. Once in the spring and once in the fall,for fleas...and I never get a flea on my dogs...and I have 16 dogs!|`|rBCQBHSHaa	You could quit bathing the dog all the time. Soaps that are made to cut thru grease for your dishes, also destroy the oil in your dog's coat and skin.|`|1LlGtiO5aa	Honestly, I use Ivory dish detergent.  It is very very gentle on your hands and cutts grease.  It cleans the HELLZZ out of them.  I have a beagle and people ALWAYS tell me she has the prettiest coat and always smells good and the Vet aways tells me "Gosh, she has the best coast and great skin!"  Seriously.  I buy Ivory dish detergent.  It is vey easy on their skin.  HOWEVER make sur eyou get out ALL the soap.  It can really tear the skin up if you dont.<br>  <br>  I learned this because I worked at a vert in college.  They had a grooming section and the lady that ran the grooming sction, Ellen used to breed and show bischons, poodles, and Whipets.  So she was amazing and she would always get compliments and people would come in with dogs that had bad skin and say "You know everytime I bring my dog here, the ithing stops." it was because of the Ivory.  So buy IVORY dish washer in the white bottle and only use a little.  You will be happy.  Keep it awya from their eyes.<br>  Good Luck and I know it sounds craxy but it's not.  It works extra well on white dogs!|`|x5u1Al4raa	Nile water

gmpST2Zuaa	Cairn Terrier<br>  <br>  The Cairn Terrier is a small British dog breed. This is the type of dog that was used to play Toto in the Wizard of Oz. The Cairn Terrier most likely resulted from the crossing of the White Terrier and the Black and Tan Terrier. It stands between 10 and 12 inches tall and it usually weighs in between 13 and 16 pounds. It has a medium to long outercoat and a soft dense undercoat. They come in shades of black, grey, red, brown, wheaten, and cream.<br>  <br>  <br>  To care for the Cairn Terrier you will want to brush or wipe down their coat on a weekly basis. You don’t want to cut their coat. However, you will need to cut their nails and brush their teeth. To keep this dog happy and out of trouble you may want to set up a dig box or a dig area that they can exercise their digging instinct in. This strategy, coupled with training, will help to limit the damage that they cause digging in your yard. This dog breed doesn’t need a lot of exercise, but they enjoy lots of free time playing in a fenced yard and going for walks with you in the park <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is of Irish heritageThe breed standard for the Soft coated wheaten calls for a height of 17"-19" at the withers with a weight of 30-40 pounds. This is a medium sized dog, with a compact body, giving a square outline when viewed from the side. Bitches tend to be somewhat smaller than the males. The breed is known for its abundant wheaten coloured coat that at adulthood falls in soft waves. It is a continuous, non-shedding coat that requires extensive maintenance and regular trimming to keep its proper shape. Coat can vary from the standard by being coarse, curly or stand-offish in texture and by being too light or grey in colour. Soft coated Wheaten puppies are usually born very dark in colour, being dark brown, red or mahogany, some with black masks and black tipping on the body coat. This colouring continuously lightens until 1-3 years of age when the coat colour then stabilizes to the adult wheaten colour. When trimmed to the standard, the head has shortly trimmed ears, a fall of hair left between and somewhat over the eyes, and a long beard. The body coat is left medium length with coat on the back of the cropped tail and rear legs trimmed such to give a square terrier outline. The coat on the feet is rounded and the coat on the bottom of the pads is removed. Pigment and eye colour is dark with the pads being black. The wheaten is a sturdily built dog with good bone, well sprung ribs and powerful movement front and rear. <br>  <br>  The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is known to be less aggressive in nature than that of other terrier breeds. The wheaten is an active bouncy breed with out being hyperactive. They love to jump up to greet you and can keep up with the best of joggers. <br>  <br>  They are very different dogs in every way cairns are smaller and more aggressive with more of a tendancy to dig wheatens are larger less agressive dogs that love to go on long walks! It really comes down to your own preferance and wich breed would suite your life style!|`|AG5HnBnqaa	I have a cairn terrier - they are lively and friendly but can get a bit tetchy at times - they enjoy to play, but also roll in poo and get into a lot of mischief!<br>  cairns are naturally scruffy. If you are looking for a more tidy dog, choose the wheten terrier. unlike cairns, their coats dont shred. You will need to train a wheten more and they are very sociable!<br>  <br>  my advice is a cairn, as i have one! when they are trained they are friendly and nice to be around|`|LR0QiTpraa	i would recemend the cairn terrier because there smaller and shed less weaten terriers are medium sized dogs and they shed a little bit more than a cairn terrier Hope I Helped|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Size - Cairns are a small dog, while wheatens are medium sized.<br>  <br>  Coat - Cairns have a wiry coat, while wheatens have a soft coat.  Both require regular grooming, but wheatens are MUCH higher maintenance coat-wise and more expensive to have groomed.<br>  <br>  Wheatens will need more exercise.<br>  <br>  Cairns are more "feisty" as a rule.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to attend some dog shows so you can meet some cairns and wheatens in person, and talk to people that actually own them.  Also join a few cairn and wheaten email lists or discussion boards, see what kind of stories people are telling about their dogs.  After reading for a while you will see the same traits and issues come up over and over again.|`|6pzCNM5Caa	size?<br>  color?<br>  attitude?<br>  job?
0DG2AA5Aaa	First off, I want to comment on something that was said in a previous answer. If you adopt from a responsible rescue, your pup *should* have ALL vaccinations and his/her immunity should be built enough to put him/her into a doggy daycare if you so choose. Responsible rescues want to set their animals up for success, so they will keep a pup long enough to make sure that it is healthy, has all vaccinations, has been spayed/neutered, and has been socialized and taught proper bite inhibition. If you come across a rescue that will let a pup go before its 12-16 weeks old, you've found a "not so good" group.<br>  <br>  That said, I think you're wanting to make sure your pup is happy when your away is wonderful. It shows that you care, and kudos to you for not just putting your dog in a crate or leaving him/her home alone all day. (I would still recommend crate training for those times that you can't supervise your pup and the daycare is not available.) Putting your dog in some type of day program (not a kennel) will help him/her become a well rounded, socialized member of society. :-) And you will still be greeted with a wagging tail and tongue baths, when you pick him/her up to go home.<br>  <br>  If you plan to get a puppy (especially a Lab), buy LOTS of safe toys and treats for him/her to chew on. Puppies LOVE to chew, they have to chew, but especially Labs. Start early with training and socialization (seems like you've already got this covered), and work with your dog in a daily routine that will establish and reinforce your position as his/her leader. Read up on NILF, this will help you develop your position and maintain it. (And it's VERY easy to do.)<br>  <br>  Find your pup a good vet... start interviewing now. Seriously, a good vet won't mind you calling or going to their office to ask questions and get to know the staff. In fact, they will welcome it, because it shows that you care about your animal even before you get it. (Do the same with the daycare and trainers that you've found.)<br>  <br>  Check with your landlord and make sure that your lease will allow such a large animal. Many apt complexes put a weight limit on pets that are allowed. You don't want to get this dog and find out a few days/weeks later that you have to give it up. Also, a responsible shelter / rescue will want to check with your landlord to make sure that the pet you choose is acceptable per the terms of your lease agreement. If possible, get a letter from  your landlord giving you permission to own this dog.<br>  <br>  Please don't visit dog parks. You may have the most well behaved dog on the planet, but you never know what type of issues or illness other dogs / owners there will have. You're better off buying a 50 ft lead and running your dog safely in an open field. <br>  <br>  I don't know what else to tell you off the top of my head at 4 in the morning (my time). lol Do your homework, study both the breeds your interested as well as general canine behavior. Buy a good book on training and learn the different methods of managing a dog using positive methods and not abuse. Make sure that you understand all of your local animal ordinances... and stay within those laws. And make sure that you fully understand that owning a pet is a huge LIFELONG commitment, and that rearing a puppy is a lot like rearing  a child. They aren't born knowing what you expect of them or how to pee outside. They're cute when they're little, but they don't stay "puppy cute" forever... they grow up. <br>  <br>  Your dog will be what you make it. Learn how to be a responsible pet owner and don't slack off. And a little word of added advice that may not pertain to your breed of choice just yet... educate yourself about BSL (Breed Specific Legislation). These laws effect all sorts of different breeds, and they target a different breed about every 10 years or so. Be ready, because one day it WILL be the Labs and the Goldens taking the brunt of it all, if we don't fight to end it now.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Unless you can come home during your lunch break.. or have a friend, neighbor or family member who is willing to stop over and potty the pup while you are gone at work, a young adult dog may be a better choice than a young puppy.  Puppies need out to potty often.  I wouldnt reccommend any kind of "day care" or boarding for a young pup until its immunity is built up either.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you for adopting!  There are many wonderful dogs who would love to sleep on your couch while waiting for you and greet you at the door when you come home!<br>  <br>  <br>  My family has always had at least one dog since I was 3.  I've raised a few dogs for Pilot Dogs Inc (guide dogs for the blind), and I've owned Chinese Cresteds for 3 years now.<br>  <br>  My dogs are happy and healthy.<br>  They are walked several times a day.. I do work afternoons, but there are other family members here who work days, they are only alone a few hours at a time.<br>  Neither of them destroy furniture.<br>  They do bark to greet.  Sometimes they bark to alert if they hear a noise.<br>  Sometimes Fred does howl and cry when I leave..  he seems to know tho when Im going to work and when Im not.  He doesnt howl when its for work.  If Im going to the store or someplace tho he does howl.|`|s4MsjfsHaa	Congratulations for asking for advice on how to be a responsible pet owner!  That's a huge step!  <br>  <br>  My first suggestion would be to decide what kind of dog you want, what breed are you drawn to.  I'm glad to hear you're going to go through a shelter - how great!  Once you go to the shelter, you may be surprised that one will pick you rather than the other way around.<br>  <br>  Since you live in an apartment, I'd say pick one that size-wise can live in an apartment (a Great Pyrenees or St. Bernard are probably not the best choice).  Also, be sure of the energy level - terriers are generally high energy, as well as beagles (as cute as they are, they're high in maintenance and often love to dig).  Have you considered an older dog - 4-5 years old may be more calm and settled and perfectly okay with being home alone.<br>  <br>  As far as what to do with him/her while you're at work - if you do choose one that needs training, I'd highly, highly recommend crate training.  Now, having said that, your schedule needs to allow for the time to let him/her out of the crate at regular times during the day.  It's not a cage to keep them in all day, but a safe place to learn how to behave and feel safe - check out the San Francisco ASPCA website on crate training - best info I've seen.  Well done crate training will provide you with a well-behaved dog, who will probably come to love his crate (they often see it as a den, a place to be safe and call their own)<br>  <br>  An even better option is to consider a dog walker or doggy day care.  If you can find a reputable, well-run doggy day care, this would be a fabulous option, at least a couple days of the week.  Here is where s/he can be with other dogs and play and socialize all day, making him very happy!    My niece owns and operates a doggy day care in Illinois - check out her website for information on day care:  www.doggydaycampinc.com.<br>  <br>  Dogs are extremely social animals and need their people and human contact.  Do not get one if he/she will be spending more than 12 hours alone on a regular basis.  It's just too long and too isolating and can and does create behavior problems, created out of frustration, boredom and loneliness.  You MUST be able to make the commitment to make this dog part of your life and family.  Lots of love, time together and connection with you are what will make a happy, well-adjusted dog.<br>  <br>  Only consider getting a dog if you are willing to commit to him/her for their lifetime.  Millions and millions of dogs and cats find themselves in shelters because the magic wore off or the owners don't have time to be with them.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're on the right track - good luck in finding the best lifetime companion!  There is definitely one out there waiting for you!!|`|AA10666701	Your dog will probably be more happy waiting for you at home and getting the chance to greet you after a long day. He wouldn't want to be stuck in a kennel while you work......that is just cruel|`|C3Paj6Blaa	i just went to a puppy store and it turned out that they have a doggy day care where you can leave your pet dog for awhile say your at work or you went for a few days vacation and you can't bring your pet with you.. they also have this puppy talk before you can take home the dog and they'll teach you about feeding or bathing and stuff like that.. if you live in a neighborhood where dog barking will be a problem then you should probably get a non hyperactive small dog.. my friend and i just checked out a Boston terrier and it's relly cute and really sweet and quiet too..|`|KN4Yuvfnaa	i have a golden retriever and she is the best dog you could have! so nice and loving! anyways, i've had her sice she was a puppie and if you need help on questions please i.m. me or email.<br>  benthebug@yahoo.com|`|KXpNMZrUaa	Congrats!!! i wanted one for a long time!!!  take good care of it k?  have fun with it|`|LbgtE1EDaa	Sounds to me like you already have your mind made up, YOUR GETTING A PUPPY. <br>  I'm telling you now though, its a lot harder then it seems. yea its fun but wow is it hard work. its seriously a life in your hands. just like a child.<br>  <br>  I've had my dog for about a year now, and hes the love of my lifeeeeeeee.

You might find it helpful.....<br>  <br>  Some Tips For getting a puppy<br>  by Rich Conklin of Pet Source USA<br>  <br>  Raising a pet is no different from raising a child. Your choice to bring a pet into your home is one that shouldn't be made lightly. New pets are new family members and the whole family should be involved in the discussion. All too often, well meaning families purchase or adopt animals to find out that the new pets are not what they expected, they are not compatible with their lifestyles, or require more care than originally thought. In my experience, more new pets are brought home during the holiday season than any other time of year. New pets are not good holiday gifts. Unfortunately, many of the plants we have in our homes during the holidays can be poisonous to pets. We may not think of eating it, but some curious pets may. Christmas trees and their decorations can create hazards for pets. Dogs will often play with glass ornaments as if they were balls and serious oral lacerations can result. Also, dogs are often attracted by the sweet taste of drinks, especially eggnog. So be very aware of your pets and their surroundings. The traditions some of us participate in during the holiday season do pose some risk to your pets. Also the adoption of pets as surprise gifts is something that should be strongly discouraged. <br>  1. Puppies It's important to learn as much as you can about your chosen dog before actually purchasing a puppy. Also, be able to honestly answer this very important question. How much time do you have to devote to your new puppy? Remember that pets need routine and a time to bond with you. New pets are often frightened and will need an adjustment period. It is very important to make your puppy feel secure during this stage. During this time, if your puppy doesn't have something to chew on, he will look for something. So make sure to provide plenty of chew toys. A puppy can entertain himself for hours if he has something to knaw on. The best age to acquire a puppy is between the ages of 7 and 12 weeks. It is suggested that a person should not get a puppy under 7 weeks. Right around the time your puppy is eight to ten weeks old, he will begin a new stage in his life. During this period the puppy will have begun to develop his adult senses. Puppies can get stressed or bored when their owners leave them home alone and sometimes this can result in chewing your favorite pair of shoes, leaving a puddle of piddle, or emptying the contents of your garbage across the floor. So be prepared to be the attention giver and practice a lot of patience. It will pay off in the long run! Puppies also need to be given a vaccine for distemper, parvovirus and leptosprosis. Insurance is a wise idea for all pets and for animals with a history of illness. Take all new pets to your vet within a week for a checkup and to start their shots. It is a good idea to get the puppy its shots and stay on schedule with them. Unfortunately, too many people adopt pets without truly understanding the responsibilities that come with raising an animal. They end up disappointed with the pets behavior, miss their shots due to a lack of time or even have to give their pet away. That's why I will stress this again, think before you leap. <br>  2. Training Training starts the day you bring your pet home and continues through his entire life. Unfortunately, thousands of happy and healthy pets arrive at animal shelters every year, not because of the pet, but because their previous person didn't realize the time, energy and money involved in keeping and training the pet. To train them correctly and get the results you want, it requires as much effort an attention to detail. Liken it to training a human toddler. Potty training a puppy correctly requires sometimes getting up in the middle of the night, several times. Don't underestimate the value of crate-training, for a variety of reasons. There are natural instincts in dogs which make house training a fairly simple process. The main goal of puppy training is to prevent problems before they get started. Puppy training, and exposing the puppy to the right learning environment at the right time can make a huge difference in adult dog behavior. And by all means, don't keep your puppy from socializing. A friendly dog is loved by all. <br>  3. Family <br>  Your choice to bring a pet into your home is one that shouldn't be made lightly. Raising a pet is a lot of responsibility, but also very rewarding. People obtain pets and replace pets more easily than ever before. Sadly, the increased availability of pets, prepackaged pet food, and veterinary care has not been paralleled by an increase in responsible pet care. In fact, many of the animals we see at the shelter are there by no fault of their own, but because of changes at the pet's former home such as divorce, downsizing or because the family didn't realize the expense and energy that went into raising a pet. In exploring possible pets, you need to decide what type of pet will be right for your temperament, location and family. It turns out that science is now demonstrating that pets are good for us, but when we make the wrong choices, it can all go sour fast. Don't be discouraged, just make rational and realistic assessments prior to expanding your family and home with a pet. Pet's do bring a great deal of love, joy and happiness to peoples lives and are well worth the effort. But remember, raising a pet is a commitment that could last up to 20 years and in some cases even longer.<br>   <br>  By: Rich Conklin <br>  Rich is the owner of Pet Source USA.

It's "what pets want!"|`|hTTPe13Naa	I have a dalmatian cross pointer and a yorkie cross.<br>  The yorkie barks at anything whenever he feels like it and the dalmatian joins in. I walk them rarely but run around the back garden like a lunatic (they follow me)!! we rescued a rottweiler last year around this time and called him max. He was the sweetest little thing, He had the eyebrows and everything. He jumped on my bed one morning and rested his mouth on my neck and kept breathing on me.. Then my mum gave him to a pet rescue place because he was "too much to handle" and i had been walking him almost every day.. >.<!!! <br>  <br>  I think black labrador puppies are soo cute with their long legs (Max had long legs).<br>  <br>  I have had/known ppl that have dogs all my life and im not scared of any of them (apart from when you are walking past someones house and right behind you there is a sudden "WOOF!") :D <br>  <br>  Ok there is my story X.x|`|uwemruhJaa	OK, so now you have read all of this good advice, there is only one thing that I don't see being addressed.  TIMING.  <br>  <br>  I have grown up with and had many animals: dogs, cats, gerbils, hamsters, frogs, guinea pigs, turtles, fish etc.  <br>  <br>  The one piece of advice I would like to give to you if you are looking for a puppy - Wait till spring time.  And here is my reason - you need to train the puppy to go outside, no puppy likes going out when it is cold.  Waiting till the spring time will allow your puppy the spring, summer to get used to the idea of going outside to take care of business and get quick and adept at it before winter comes.  <br>  <br>  Puppies are very energetic and will want to visit things, play, and sniff when let outside to satisfy their curiosity.  Bundling yourself up and bringing a puppy outside for 5 min will get old quickly.|`|wGPRKRhTaa	It almost sounds as if you have never owned a dog.  It seems very strange to me as I was lucky enough to grow up with one.  Some parents do not allow them though.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are wonderful companions.  They can be lots of work tho'.  You need to do lots of research into the various breeds before you pick your puppy or dog.  Do not get carried away in the moment as it is really hard on both you and the dog if they turn out to be totally unsuitable for some reason.  You get to feel guilty for failing them (even if it doesn't make sense) and they get shifted back & forth.  <br>  <br>  Of course no matter what you decide... you might walk in and fall in love with exactly the opposite breed.   Not the best idea, but it can work out as they definitely have their own personalities.  Some are playful, some are not.  Some chew, some don't.  Some bark, some don't.  Some need a lot of grooming, some you can do yourself.  Some are hard to house-train, some train quickly.  My little girl is litter-box trained which is just the best!!  <br>  <br>  If you are a meticulous house keeper... then you should get a non-sheding one.  This is also really important if you; or a family member; or a friend that visits regularly - has allergies.  <br>  <br>  My preference is for small breed dogs.  I have had larger ones but the little ones just get so much closer to your heart.  However.... they are not so imposing if you want them for protection.  They are much more portable but  you have to be ready to scoop them out of harm's way from big mean dogs.  <br>  <br>  All living things need to eat what is right for them.  The little breeds really need their diets watched.  I have a Yorkie & I'm very careful with diet.  She does gets some of my food but it is always prepared from scratch & never is fatty, salty, or sweet.   She also get raw vegetables but never onions, of course, they give dogs a blood disease which can kill them!!  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, a dog can be smelly for some unknown reason or start to scratch a lot.  I have learned that can be caused by a sensitivity to food.  My Yorkie started to scratch and I tried lots of different shampoos, etc.  Finally I took most of the wheat & corn out of her diet and she hardly ever does anymore.  I have heard that Brewers yeast can cause even a smelly ear discharge plus other smells.  Strange but these are just some problems that can occur. <br>  <br>  If you don't own your own house or apartment - finding places that allow pets can be a problem also.  However, I really don't want to discourage you.  They can give so much pleasure and become very loyal.  <br>  <br>  If you work regular days/shifts... it is mostly not necessary to do the doggy daycare thing - as long as you are able to do the necessary walks morning & night.  You could also subscrible to a dog-walking service (a good one can be almost worth their weight in gold)....lol.   <br>  <br>  Larger breeds can be trained to chase a frizbee or ball, etc. They ALL love their   walks.  Well okay, a friend has a rescued Pom & she just wants to hide in the house because she was abused by her previous owner but that is unusual.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, a good choice can be a dog that the owner has had to give up because they are elderly & have to go into an assisted  living facility.  Some of them will be very well trained, cared for and loved.  You might even decide to take your dog as a visitor to these senior homes that allow it.  The elderly absolutely love to see them!!!
5a4n0WAgaa	Remember dogs temps are much higher then ours but ruling that out, possibly nerves, anxiety, frightened.  I always had large dogs; labs, retriever's until my current dog which is a Mini Dachshund.  Now due to her temperament she shivers at times.  Prior to feeding (anxious), anticipating a walk (when I pull out the leash), when someone rings the front door bell, and strange environments such as the vets office, parks, etc.  Different breeds, different dogs, different temperaments.  Believe it or not, there are correctional training techniques you can use to help this.  Do you have a trainer that works with things like this in your area?  Take a look.  Make sure you have your pooch checked out at the vet first just to see that the dog is healthy and then move on to behavioral modification. And check in to her specific breed to see what info you can find (if your dog is not a pure bred find the dominant breed and look there).   Hope this helped.|`|tQw7BtAmaa	it would depend on the type of dog, I have a Chihuahua, and he shivers all the time.  He's not sick or anything he's just scared all the time.  Its just how most small dogs are.  It would help if you put the breed of your dog up there though.
gUhsYF9xaa	its always best to give your dog a name with one or two sylables as they will repsond better to a simple sounding name and are less likely to be confused with such a long name. Hannah on its own or Montana on its own are both nice names, but too much of a mouthfull if said at the same time.|`|GMk8YSXnaa	hannah, yeah, montana, no<br>  firstly, its easier for a dog to remember a two-syllable name, which is fine if montana is jus a last name.<br>  secondly, personally, i jus dont like montana, dosent suit a dog.|`|voYyWgb9aa	call it Hantana :D|`|8Vy0TPMXaa	I would say no. <br>  <br>  Don't forget you are doing to have this dog for many many years and you may regret naming her after a celebrity whose stardom will not stand the test of time. Several years down the line and HM will be no where to be found.<br>  <br>  Name your dog something else - a name that is sparked by her looks and personality.|`|90f588ed7f3f2ed8349444976d57b50eaa	you can call your dog whatever you like but you have to remember a dog can live for approximately 14 years.  It might seem a good idea now but later in life, you may regret it.  You could always shorten it down to Hannah, or Montana which are both lovely names.  Just try and think about your dogs personality and which suits it best.  Have fun naming!|`|9mvoSc2Paa	It's an okay name. Just remember that that dog is going to live a long time, do you want to have to explain the Hannah Montana name when you are older?|`|SvGGWj6Kaa	No, it's a stupid name|`|iJx5x7CAaa	If thats  the name you like then that should be its  name. its  your dog
p3djgow3aa	wel its easier to crate train wen the dog is a pupy but first put ur dog in the crate fo a few seconds. DO NOT CLOSE THE CRATE DOOR!!!!!! if u do , ur dog wil think its a punishment. first jst let the dog snif around the crate and get familiar wit it.  Then start putin it ther evry five min. and see if ur dog will go potty.  wen he or she does, immensly praise it and giv it a treat.  Then it will kno that goin to the bathroom in the crate is a good thing.  keep doin that but also start lengthening the time eg. put ur dog in da crate evry 10 min for a wk, then 15 min and so on.  it wil then become a good habit, but keep praisin ur dog whil trainin it. But then again some dogs, lik my dog, jst wont learn crate trainin. Good luck tho. :)|`|HXDq54kFaa	try and take him out more often and get him use to going out again...and make sure the crate is just enough for him to sit and stand not enough to move around in it because that is when he is making in his cage..|`|4KsnCXI1aa	A normal dog will not go where he sleeps. How many times per day do you take him outside? It is possible that you're not taking him out enough, or he may have health issues. The best thing you can do is take him to the vet and have a thorough check-up. If he has a clean bill of health, just take him outside more frequently and reward him for doing his business out there. There are many books on crate training and how to help them overcome separation anxiety, so it would probably be in your best interest to read one because this is a difficult and somewhat complex issue.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|F2Fi0TAYaa	try a smaller crate or try puting his food and water in with him .he sould only have enough room to stand also try keeping a journal of his bathroom habits so you can plot his usage and adjust to beter suit his needs .|`|HY9XuQbSaa	I've heard to use a small crate big enough so they can stand up correctly, but not a lot of room to roam. Also, make sure they do not drink a lot of water an hour before getting into the crate. Make sure you take them out to potty right before. If the puppy is not very old you cannot expect them to wait very long. When they get older you can increase the time.|`|RXy5vl5jaa	keep him or she in their in and see what he or she does|`|iVIQDgkxaa	I have a new 4mth old puppy, so hes not as old as your Newfie/Chow, but it just took sometime for him to get adjusted.  After a while and tons of clean up he got used to being in there.  Your pup may not have been Crate Trained so your starting from scratch....consistancy is the key with all dog. Dont give up, and reward him when you get to the stage where he doesnt go in te crate.  Best of luck!!!
iNYaNMtqaa	1) Enroll him in obedience class, preferably one in Petsmart or Petco - those classes are held in the store and offer more chances for socialization and they train you to deal with distractions right off.<br>  <br>  2) Set up a feeding schedule if you haven't already. Feed three to four times a day (but only feed the reccomended amount printed on the bag!), at the same time every day. It helps regulate their bowels and bladder.<br>  <br>  3) Take you dog out after these activities: Eating/Drinking, playing, sleeping/napping.<br>  <br>  4)Watch for signs that he has to go. Most puppies circle, sniff intently, or try to squat. If he squats, clap or make a loud noise to distract and then bring him out.<br>  <br>  5) When he goes outside and pees or poops, tell him "Pee, good pee" (same for poop) while he is peeing/pooping and eventually he'll understand that "pee" means that behavior and he might learn to do it on command. Give him a tasty treat when he is done.<br>  <br>  6) Crate train him. It isn't cruel and helps a LOT when it comes to keeping him safe when no one is around, or when potty training through the night (dogs don't usually soil their beds.)<br>  <br>  7) Don't coddle him when he is scared, it reinforces the behavior. Ignore him. Have new people give him treats so long as he isn't running away scared. Have people move slow around him.<br>  <br>  Best thing is to enroll him in the class. A trainer can help you much better in person than we can online.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	Below is from Cesar Millan (The Dog Whisperer) book...<br>  <br>  "Nose, eyes, ears...in that order!<br>  I remind dog owners that dogs see the world differently from the way we do.  We communicate using our ears first, then our eyes and lastly, our nose.  Dogs begin with the nose, then the eyes, and lastly the ears.  Allowing a dog to experience our scent before we engage it in eye contact or speak to it is one way to establish trust early on. <br>  <br>  Humanizing a dog<br>  Many owners make the well-intentioned mistake of thinking of their dogs as children.  I advise people to try to see the world through a dog’s eyes.  Cute outfits, fancy dog food, and a millionaire’s mansion will not make for a happy dog.  Regular exercise, a strong stable pack leader, and affection that’s earned will result in a dog that’s calm and balanced.<br>  <br>  Calm-assertive energy<br>  This is the energy you need to project to show your dog you are the calm and assertive pack leader.  Note assertive does not mean angry or aggressive.  Calm-assertive means always compassionate, but quietly in control. <br>  <br>  Calm-submissive energy<br>  In nature, this is the appropriate energy for a “follower” in a dog pack, and thus the ideal energy for a dog to project when living in a household with humans.  Signs of calm-submissive energy include a relaxed posture, ears held back, and a nearly instinctual response to the “pack leader’s” commands.<br>  <br>  Exercise, discipline, and affection....in that order!<br>  These are the three ingredients for creating a happy, balanced dog.  Most dog owners give only affection, or don’t provide these three necessities in the correct order. <br>  a.  EXERCISE - walking a dog at least one hour every day, and in the correct way.<br>  b.  DISCIPLINE - giving a dog rules, boundaries, and limitations in a nonabusive manner. <br>  c.  AFFECTION - a reward we give to our dogs and to ourselves, but only after the dog has achieved calm submission in our “pack.” <br>  <br>  Check out the videos from Cesar's shows.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	The first thing you need to do is enroll him in a puppie obedience class...He'll learn that strangers and other dogs are not his enemy and he'll get used to being around new people...<br>  Second thing, when a pup eats twice a day, he poops twice a day...When he eats 3 times a day, he poops 3 times a day...If you are just leaving his food out for him to feed whenever he wants, you won't be able to anticipate...He'll need to go about 20-30 minutes after he eats.. :-)|`|CEIdX9ZVaa	yeah well you should try to sign up for those puppy training classes where they will help with their behavior and potty training. I used to have 2 puppy malteses and my parents would keep them in the kitchen where there as no carpet to soak up the urine. while they stayed in there, they would do their business on the floor, but later on, we put newspaper in the kitchen and when we would catch them about to pee or poo, they would carry them to the newspaper and tell them for 5 minutes to go on the newspaper. they eventually learned to go on the newspaper after a month. it doesn't happen quickly so let it soak into his head. or if you prefer him going outside, do the same thing by catching him and taking him outdoors. i dont know if this helps but that's how my parents trained my dogs. but the best way to go is probably to get your dog trainer or go to classes.|`|F2Fi0TAYaa	get a crate just big enough for him he should remain in crate at all times unless you are walkin or playing with him he should sleep there at night this will keep him from chewing stuff also you should get a few differnt chew toys and encourge him to use them play hith him my pup prefers ball or things he can chase bad behavior can be punished with time out for a few minutes eventually he will prefer his crate even sleep there on his own keep a log of his habbits and you can beter ajust to his or her needs also keep a log of his outside visits so you can plot his needs start every 30 mins then icrease or decrease as needed|`|RXy5vl5jaa	have you ever seen him or she sniff on the floor and does he or she barks or does any think weird if she does take her outside|`|fVd4NBsYaa	I would enroll him in a class....But if you can't afford it.<br>  <br>  Then you just have to accomplish task by task. Don't overwhelm him. When he gets one task, then move to the next.<br>  But you have to reward him, to get the task that you want and punish for the task you don't want. This can take a lot of time. But it's worth it. Dogs learn fast, they are actually smart.<br>  <br>  Google different techniques to teaching your dog and the best way to teach him.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to be consistent and patient.|`|oREWdI10aa	I agree with the other posters who said enroll him in training.  You can even get it very cheap at some place like PetSmart if money is a concern.  I worked with a private trainer for my three and I loved her, but I know a lot of people who have gotten results that are just as good from PetSmart.  <br>  <br>  Also, if he's going to be inside, you should really consider crate training.  Here is a link to a great article from Pet Place: <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/how-to-house-train-your-puppy/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/how-to-hous...</a>  That site will probably be very helpful.  I think it even has a free six day email course for crate training.  But if you just do a quick search, you'll find tons of information on it.  Actually, you can find tons of info on just about anything there.<br>  <br>  As far being scared when people approach him, he needs to be socialized.  Here's a great article on that: <a href="http://www.rocketdog.ca/downloads/WellSocializedDog.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocketdog.ca/downloads/WellSo...</a>  The one basic thing that comes from almost everyone is that the puppy should meet between 100 and 150 people before they are 5 or 6 months old.  That link says 100 before they are 5 months.  Here's another from Pet Place: <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/the-importance-of-socializing-pups/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/the-importa...</a>  I have a I have a 16 month old chi and she was  just over 5 weeks when we adopted her.  She was a rescue and very fearful.  I took her everywhere.  She barely weighed half a pound so it was easy to carry her with me and she overcame that fear quite quickly.  She was very timid at first, but before I let anyone pet her, I'd ask if she could smell their hand instead of them just going for her head.  That worked really well.  If someone just grabbed at her, I moved her back and explained.  Some people got pissed, but their emotional stability isn't my problem.  I always explained nicely and most people are very understanding, but there's always one or two, you know?  But I was doing what was best for her, not them.  <br>  <br>  The most important thing is going to be your patience.  He needs to be corrected when he is bad, but he needs double the praise when he's good.  If he does something bad, correct him immediately.  If you wait, he won't know what he did.  He'll know you're pissed, but he won't have any idea why.  Show him what you want him to do and be sure to give him lots of love and affection.  You're going to need a lot of patience and to be consistent.  Try not to get too frustrated because it won't do either of you any good.  It will all pay off in the end and you will be rewarded for your hard work.  They are so worth it.|`|uhK5ZWFuaa	Well is what I did with my dog is we let her out side and told her to go potty and I would ether go outside with her or I would just watch from my back door and when she came inside I would give her a treat and tell her "good potty outside". I think you might want to try letting your dog go outside alone. If you find that your dog left a gift in the house I'd call your dog over to you and put your dogs noise in it (not touching the gift but so they can see what they left) and put them outside and say "Go potty outside". Eventually your dog will under stand to go potty outside. I hope this helps!!! Good luck with your Potty training.

Your dog needs rules boundaries and limitations. you have to show your pup you are the pack leader and you have to be firm calm but assertive. never yell or hit your dog it does nothing but let him know you are not the one in control and it makes them show aggression, and will get more destructive. your pup should not have run of the house and you need to puppy proof the area he is in. you should start with crate training.

AA10859773	Unfortunately I can't find a list of ingredients so I can't give you a firm answer.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't assume that because it's safe for humans or even horses that it'll be safe for cats.  There are so many things that are bad for cats!  Essential oils is one example.<br>  <br>  If you ever have a need to bathe your cat, I would go with a very very small amount of dish soap.  That should be safe enough to use since you're not planning to do this on a regular basis, but are just anticipating your kitty getting into something.<br>  <br>  If you were planning to bathe it regularly (which isn't necessary), I'd recommend getting a shampoo made for cats.  They're inexpensive and they'll last a long time.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you are anticipating that he or she is likely to get into something, it would be a good idea to pick up a bottle to have on hand.|`|1zQqAiicaa	My kitten had an odor to him and i asked the vet about what i can do...she told me to use just human shampoo...anything i would use on myself would be fine for him, just watch his eyes.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I wouldn't.

Q4jlkW0laa	The top three recommended reptiles for beginners are:<br>  <br>  Corn Snake<br>  <br>  Bearded Dragon<br>  <br>  Leopard Gecko<br>  <br>  This is because each of them tolerate the most amount of handling and the most amount of human mistakes while setting them up. There are many pros and cons to each of them, but these three are hands down the most recommended of reptiles to start with. (And some of us never quite grow out of having at least one or two, even when we move on to "complicated" reptiles.)<br>  <br>  Read up on reptiles because they live a lot longer than a dog or a cat and it is a commitment you will have to live with. They are "not hard to look after" but do require a lot more study, a lot more expense in getting a proper enclosure set up, and some require live food - which you also have to take care of. <br>  <br>  There is a a lot to consider, but if you do make the jump, you will find a lot of fun with reptile ownership. What you put into it is what you get out. For instance an hour a week taming any of the three above will give you a life long companion that hangs out with you - our first Leo loved to watch video games being played. But if you don't take the time, you'll end up with a skiddish, unhandable pet - which may defeat the point. <br>  <br>  Remember, all reptiles are considered display animals, you won't be able to play with them every night or wake them up to show your friends.|`|twVyisGnaa	I recommend a Leopard Gecko, Iguana, or Chameleon.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|rRHFbpfqaa	A lizard! |`|wbRjrV4baa	If you don't mind having live insects as food running around the house (because they will escape) the two ideally suited for a beginner are a leopard gecko or a bearded dragon.<br>  <br>  If you don't like the idea of insects running loose around your house then go for a uromastyx (or dabb) lizard as they are vegetarian.<br>  <br>  If you decide for a snake the ideal starter species is a corn snake. Once again food becomes an issue however as you either have to buy a frozen mouse every week or keep them in the freezer.<br>  <br>  What ever you think about getting do some research into it and buy everything you need before you get the animal. Remember as well that reptiles can live a long time and vets fees can be costly so think carefully  before buying one also remember other people who live in the same house as you, if they are petrified of snakes it wouldn't be fair on them if you bought one.<br>  <br>  Just think if someone was going to keep you in a box you would want them to clean it out regularly, make sure it was a comfy temperature for you and give you somewhere comfortable to sleep with a bit of privacy then gave you a healthy diet of things you liked to eat and drink. Find out these things about your animal and do the same for them and you will have a happy healthy pet you can enjoy for years|`|JvSCCiKfaa	Breaded Dragons, once you have them set up with proper lights and housing there really easy.

Just make sure she can't get to the human food.|`|FdcWPp48aa	She'll be fine, it takes a lot of milk chocolate to do damage.  |`|kmTnIuL2aa	She'll most likely be fine. It takes a lot of chocolate to make a dog sick, especially a big one like yours. For smaller dogs chocolate is more dangerous and you should never purposely give your dog chocolate, (or grapes or raisins for that matter), but for yours it shouldn't be a problem. If she starts getting sick or acting unusual you should probably take her to the vet though.|`|DU0F48B3aa	other than a  little due to a food she isn't use to my 30 pound dog loves a chocolate chip cookie once in a while and they aren't teh mini's|`|JczgcRrRaa	Call the vet, she should be fine but just in case ask the vet.

But yes, chocolate is poisonous to our fellow canines. Make sure she never gets her paws on any other chocolate. Reason why:<br>  <br>  The theobromine found in chocolate is toxic to non-human animals such as horses, dogs, parrots, small rodents, and cats because they are unable to metabolise the chemical effectively.  If they are fed chocolate, the theobromine will remain in their bloodstream for up to 20 hours, and these animals may experience epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. Medical treatment involves inducing vomiting within two hours of ingestion, or contacting a veterinarian.|`|lcRlRbWfaa	no.  you have a big dog and a small cookie.  the ratio in size means a lot.  the cookie will not affect her.  most dogs can eat small amounts of chocolate overtime  only large amounts will harm a dog.  i especially know this because my friend has a bullmastiff (a puppy) ate half a bowl of chocolate icecream and she did not get sick. do not be worried.|`|k4dBrJTHaa	Probably not. Although choc. isn't good for dogs (toxic actually), it takes a whole lot for them to get really sick. My Jack Russell LOVES chocolate. Last Christmas we forgot to put away the Hershey kisses before bed, when we woke up there were wrappers all over the house. He was fine!<br>  Tip: The darker the choc, the worse it is for dogs.|`|6101021cc624ac7e4bf3f970d72d3628aa	1 cookie should be fine. Dogs are not gonna die from small chocolate consumption's, its COCOA that is harmful to them. So if it was that small of a amount you should be ok. The worse thing maybe would be diarrhea. |`|LG2DLkE5aa	Doubt it. However chocolate is very toxic to dogs. Monitor her behavior if she has diarrhea or vomiting take her to the vet.|`|AA10897607	As long as it was one cookie nothing should happen to your dog but keep an eye on her and if she starts getting sick take her to the vet. Good luck with her. 
8i90ov0Gaa	I have used tap water for many years and have never had problems. I have heard from multiple sources that it is not necessary to treat the water as you would with fish. As for vitamins, I give my turtles a variety of foods to ensure they get their vitamins. Crickets are easy, because you can gut load them by allowing them to eat things high in vitamins, such as collard greens, which are a good source of calcium, and then feed them to the turtles. I also feed mine minnows (not goldfish. they are unhealthy for turtles), worms, pellets, etc. Some of my turtles will eat various veggies such as romaine lettuce.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Tap water is usually OK if you don't live too close to the water treatment plant. If you are worried, just  let the water sit in an open container for a day before putting it in the tank. I don't even bother to do that.<br>  <br>  For calcium, you can feed earthworms or place a cuttlebone or piece of plaster in the water.|`|pDPSaL37aa	I use tap water for my Red-Eared Slider turtle. When doing this you MUST use a tap water conditioner. I use Aqua Plus. It removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes heavy metals that are in the water. I also use a Wardley Turtle Block. It also helps to condition the water and it has calcium supplements, too. As for the vitamin consumption, I don't give my turtle anything other than ReptoMin food sticks and romaine lettuce (sometimes chicken or beef, but hardly ever). Although, I should start providing vitamins now that I think of it. <br>  <br>  This seems like it would be an easier way to provide vitamins for your turtle (I've never used it myself):<br>  <a href="http://www.repcal.com/AqTurt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.repcal.com/AqTurt.htm</a>|`|AA11044738	it's ok as long as you let the chlorine evaporate for about 1 day before using the water. kb

2SYrVb3faa	 Puppy pads can work, but they train your dog to go in the house, so it can be difficult to transition to going outside.  So either way, this is what you need to do.  Most of the time, you can tell when your puppy has to go.  She will do circles and have her nose to the ground searching for a place.  Watch for the signs!  (They usually go right after eating and drinking)  When you see this, take her to the place you want her to go!  Use a command while she is going so she will associate it with relieving herself.  Now, when a puppy messes up and you catch her, take her to where you want her to go and use the same command.  Stay there a few minutes.  It's not a punishment, but a redirection.  If your puppy goes and you do not catch her, just clean it up.  If you scold or get mad, she won't know what it is for.  Puppies have very short attention spans.  Personally, I would say to let the dog go to the bathroom outside.  Now this process takes time.  There is no easy fix.  It takes commitment and patience.  Just don't give up!!!  |`|V1pOG3Cgaa	You shouldn't rub it in her face. You can just search for answers on this website about potty training and maybe look at the best answers that were given. Everyone has gone through this so you will have a lot of help. If you can train her as soon as she gets most of her shots to go out in you backyard.

If you CATCH her inside your house you can simply say "no" and escort her outside to finish.  If you do not catch her in the act you are screwed.  Clean it up and DO NOT reprimand her.  She will not understand.<br>  <br>  Crate train her for nights and times when you cannot keep your eyes on her.

Praise and rewarding is the key to her understanding to go outside.<br>  <br>  Then, invest in a crate with a removable panel.

If you don't catch her doing it, clean up the mess and consider it your fault for not watching her.|`|K6ZXh7qnaa	First of all, do NOT rub your dog's face in their mess, by the time you do, they forgot what they did to make you so mad!  The best way to train is when you see them about to go, distract them with a loud noise and immediately take them out and put the on the grass and say "potty" or whatever word you want to use.  I have not had a good experience with training pads because you are teaching them that going inside the house is okay.  Also, make sure you take your puppy out very frequently, ie after then sleep, after they eat and more frequently while they are playing or running around.  A puppy can hold its pee 1 hour for every month they are old plus one.  So your puppy should be able to hold if for about 3 hours.  I would suggest taking her out atleast every 3 hours or more if she is very active.  This will show her where the proper place to go pee is!  Also, I taught my dog to ring a bell hung on the door when she needed to go out which she picked up on in a day or so.  Get your puppy to ring the bell, then immediately take her outside to go potty, she'll catch on!   Good luck!|`|ijb1Jp3Eaa	First,don't stick her  nose in it. It does no good. If she all ready committed the act she has no idea why you are doing that. The trick is to catch her in the act and run her to the Pee Pad. Once she has gone on it then you just need to keep her near it and she should continue. If you are letting her rome the house then she is probably getting lost and it's too far. I kept mine penned up in the kitchen area. Her food in one corner and Pee Pad in the other. Within a couple of weeks she was completely trained to the pad. She's three now and has yet to go anywhere else. Girls learn fast. Just be patient and you must remain consistent. Good luck.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Rubbing her face in it will not do any good.<br>  <br>  You need to be consitent and supervise her constantly.  When you cant supervise, crate her.<br>  <br>  If you catch her "in the act" tell, her firmly "NO" then take her to the desired spot, and praise her once there... even if she dribbled thru the house.<br>  <br>  You cant scold her for a pile you find after the fact..  slap yourself for not watching her better.<br>  <br>  Clean up all messes with a good cleaner.<br>  <br>  Personally I think the mats are just confusing to pups..  most "pad trained" dogs I know still often miss, and many of them will use other surfaces that are similar to the pee pad, such as a mattress.  "Inside/outside" seems to be more defining of where's an acceptable place to potty.<br>  <br>  There's no "fast" way to housebreak.  It can take weeks, or even months.  Many pups are actually housebroken too, or have the concept, but they do not have the bladder control, which is why you need to supervise and make sure she gets to the potty area well before the urge strikes.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	YOU MEAN LITTLE THING, YOU!  Rubbing the highest sense organ in urine and feces is cruel and inhumane!!!<br>  <br>  Try just feeding her twice a day, then take her immediately outside for potty time.  Make sure she ellimates completly before bringing her back in.  Also put down more pads and newspaper.<br>  <br>  When I train pups, I don't clean up after them right away.  Sounds gross, but the smell helps them understand where to go.<br>  <br>  Make sure you give positive reinforcement more often.  Treats aren't always necessary and can lead to a fat dog.  Play fight with her.  Put a rope in your mouth while your on the floor and have a tug of war with her.  Lay on your back in the potty area (not in the wet spot) and let her crawl all over you.<br>  <br>  So, only if you catch her going in the wrong spot is verbal negativity allowed.  Watch carefully and pick her up while she's sniffing and put her on the pads.

The health benefits WAY outweigh your attachment to your...jewels.|`|p7swtBYzaa	It's a dog, don't put your feelings onto him.   Dogs don't have sex for fun - it is a fundamental urge to procreate and produce --- that's it.   A neutered dog does not have this urge any more and doesn't miss it.   The advantages are obvious, dog won't move heaven and earth to get out to find a female in heat, dog won't lift his leg to mark everything, testicular cancer is avoided, less aggression towards other dogs, etc., etc.<br>  <br>  It does NOT change the dog's fundamental personality in any way - just the urge to mate with females in heat, period.<br>  <br>  Bulldogs do NOT breed normally - read up on it.   Even if your dog were "doing his business for free", it would be far from free for the owner of the female. <br>  Bulldogs almost never give normal birth - the heads of the pups are far too large to fit down the birth canal - C-sections are about always needed, which is why bulldog pups are so expensive - it is a very expensive proposition to breed them.   So you would not be doing the world - or owners of female dogs - any favor by leaving your dog intact, and it sure won't make him a better dog.<br>  <br>  Please get him neutered.   I have 4 gorgeous (and one all wrong - from a back yard breeder before I got a clue) pedigree dachshunds, I mean gorgeous - one is a retired champion of a conformation so lovely he is admired far and wide - he's neutered.   Another has been shown, is a sable long hair, under 8 pounds, perfect - have been regularly asked for pups out of her for years, even by other showers of dachsies.   They have literally run after me at dog shows to ask about pups out of her --- answer is no.   As long as there are dogs out there needing homes and being euthanized for lack of them - I would not breed a dog, just couldn't live with my conscience.<br>  <br>  I doubt your dog needs to be bred for the good of the breed, so please, have a heart and neuter him.<br>  <br>  |`|bnJLKQWMaa	Cesar would tell you if you dog cannot be 'serviced' twice a year you will have a frustrated and unbalanced dog.  You have to think about the potential number of puppies he will sire in his lifetime, way too many could end up at a rescue center.<br>  <br>  I am sure from what you say you have a great dog but please be responsible, you Wife is right it is best for him and for you.<br>  <br>  I hope you make the right choice and have a wonderful dog for years to come.  Best wishes|`|C1eHfhrHaa	The only reason to breed a dog is to improve the breed.  If that's not your goal, then get him neutered.  It's healthier in the long run, but wait until he is about 18 months old, otherwise his growth will be stunted- he will not get to his optimum weight for lack of testosterone.|`|lNyI0FSCaa	"i would much prefer letting him do his business with a bulldog ***** for free....."<br>  <br>  That line right there is much more than enough to fix him.  He's not a money making machine to do with as you will for free or for pay.  Unless he's two years old, has had all he tests done, and has been shown and proven in the ring, there's absolutely NO reason to breed him.  If you're just going to keep him as a pet, do it.<br>  <br>  However, there are alternatives if you would rather keep him intact while removing the ability to breed.  There are chemical neuters, where they insert a patch into the scrotum.  It's kind of like the birth control patch for women (kind of, same concept but works differently).  Then there is the vasectomy.  I prefer this method actually, but it's much more expensive.  It allows all the benefits of having an unaltered animal with the benefits of having an altered animal.<br>  <br>  I will say this though.  Despite my personal beliefs on altering animals, I would rather see a pet neutered if the owner was even slightly doubtful of their ability to prevent puppies, let alone afford the expense and provide a home for all of them personally so they didn't become 'someone elses problem'.<br>  <br>  ADD: I'm not a breeder, and it is natural for dogs to breed.  However, even if there's not a bulldog overpopulation (and there is, or else I wouldn't see so many poorly bred ones falling out of puppy mills all the time) there's still an overpopulation that needs to be fixed.  Adding more to it in general does not help.  It's great that you think he's healthy, but unless he's had his hips and joints and other things checked out, all the nessisary testing, not just a check up, and been shown, you don't know if he's breed standard or not.  In this way you will not be breeding to better the breed, which is how it should be done, and you would be concidered a Back Yard Breeder, or a mini puppy mill.<br>  <br>  That's not why they are that expensive anyway.  Over here a nice colored lab goes for $800 and there are THOUSANDS in the pound.  Pitbulls go for $1500 from the kid down the street simply because of their color and, again, THOUSANDS in the pound.  Even more of them are pit bull/lab mixes, and as a result of the poor breeding many of them are violent.  So good health doesn't always mean a nice well rounded dog either.|`|e598c0f985767598220ab3c9629e6a89aa	Yes all of those things are correct, but how about conflict between you and the mrs. How about this for a compromise. Look into neuticles or other prosthetic testicles. He will look the same and he won't know they are gone. Oh sure sounds silly but this is a bulldog .. they like to show them off.<br>  <br>  The only thing about his personality that will change is that he will have less tendancy to get that bully dominance, he will be a bit more relaxed. He will still be energetic and playful etc but won't get pushy and demanding as he gets older. Some bulls can turn this to aggression which is a difficult thing to work with. <br>  <br>  Make your wife happy and let him get sniped but you can try and talk her into fake ones for him. |`|XBF8UtOcaa	This question is going to depend on whether you are wanting to use him as a stud.  If you plan on using him now is the time to start getting all the proper testing for him.  And make sure you dont just stud him to any female, research this female, how many other litters has she had, has she had all testing done, what helath problems are known in her lines.  etc..<br>    If you dont want to go through the whole stud thing (and collecting from him yourself :(   or paying the vet to collect he semen)  then it is better health wise for him.  Having males neutered really decreases the testicular cancer chances. I have never used any males for breeding purposes and always have them snipped. With my Bulldogs it has not changed the personality of them and has not settled them down any they still run around the house like they are crazy..lol, another myth is that it will stunt their growth.. you can check out my site to see mine are nice and healthy..      www.mypace.com/bulldogmom06<br>    I know it is a "male" thing, but honestly truely better for your little guy as far as health. <br>  |`|y53WuG1Qaa	Neutering your bulldog will not change his personality, it will simple prevent unintended insemination. Bulldogs have a very high tolerance to pain, he may not even notice any discomfort. This will be your biggest problem. He will need to be inactive for a few days, as to not tear his stitches out . Our American Bulldog was neutered a few months ago. He was a little drowsy the first day, but by the second day he was back to his old ways - same personality and all.<br>   <br>  Your dog will still be able to 'do his business' with female dogs. And if he isn't neutered, it isn't necessarily free. If he inseminated another dog, you are also responsible for the care and cost of the puppies.<br>   <br>  If you plan on breeding your bulldog, remember that good breeders do testing to check for hip dysplasia and other genetic defects. Up to 90% of bulldog births need to be done by c-section, with the other 10% being whelped naturally. Because of their small hips and large heads/shoulders, both mother and puppies can die during birth. THIS is the reason that bulldogs are higher priced than other breeds, not because more people want them than what is available.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever your decision might be, but I HIGHLY recommend neutering your bulldog.
Vt5xYnZ5aa	Sounds like kennel cough to me.  Does she ever spit up foamy stuff?  The doc can give you antibiotics and/or a cough suppresant.  Small breeds are prone to reverse sneezing which is mostly just annoying, but if you calm them down they'll usually stop.

t78DA6Dpaa	It is best to switch to an adult food at the age of 1 year old. If you think the puppy is getting fat then you can switch to an adult food as early as about 8 months old. I have 3 Cavaliers ages, 15 months, 11 months, and 8 months. I mix both puppy and adult Merrick dry food (Puppy Plate and Wilderness Blend) together and give them adult Merrick canned food all flavors. All are of perfect weight. I began adding the adult food to their puppy food when they were 8 months old.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Usually at a year old. In larger breeds they actually can go on adult food a little sooner.

Exercise is the absolute best way to calm a dog. An out of control dog is usually the result of too much pent up energy. My brother has huskies and both dog require 2 hours of exercise on the a.m and p.m. If htey do not get i they are out of control. My Labs need to 45 minute walks a day and that is about what an average dog should have. I would say drain your dogs energy first, tehn try training and then onto what you need to do.

Also you can give her some chicken in with the softened food. there are really a lot of foods that are safe for dogs there are quite a few books on homemade food for dogs|`|voRkMxnBaa	I use to take can food(ground up kind) and mix a little of it with a little milk,it makes it kinda soupy and they always loved it.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Because your dogs are cross-breeds, it's difficult to predict or recommend things. |`|8FBbcnKGaa	any kind of puppy food, warmed up in the microwave with water in the dish. the water will soak into the kibble and make it softer and easier to chew. you could also buy canned food. We've found that mixing kibble with some canned puppy food works wonders. When they start eating regularly, you can either choose to back off with the canned, or keep putting a little bit in. My dogs love it, especially when it's warmed up in the microwave.<br>  <br>  If you still run into issues with your dogs eating, talk to your vet and see about getting a product called Nutri-Cal. It's a dietary suppliment that will also work as a substitute in dogs that won't eat. The moist kibble or the wet food will most likely work. If not, definitely visit your vet.|`|myBki176aa	I have a very small puppy and I prepare all her meals. <br>  She only eats small amounts of food several times a day.<br>  About every 4th day she does eat more than she normally does on the other days of the week.<br>  <br>  I too used to worry that she was not eating enough.<br>  <br>  She really enjoys fresh food so I make her puppy cookies and usually vegetarian meals which she loves.<br>  <br>  For protein I add eggs, peanuts, lentils, beans (not too much)<br>  soy products, oats and a variety of vegetables. <br>  <br>  I occasionally buy her a dental bone to chew on for her teeth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|KqJvc9O7aa	She might not like the food.

kg4aOcKeaa	if you have a leash use it! if you don't want to use it get a fence. <br>  <br>  the reason your dog is not listening is because YOU probably never taught him what no means. you need to say no is a low tone, so it is perceived as a growl. Also you chasing him is just fun for him. I trained my dog to follow me by running the other way so she chased me and using commands such as heel, wait, stay  slow. You should really take a class, many schools offer training specifically in coming when called and leash training.<br>  <br>  invest in the safety of your dog by going to classes, reading some books to train your dog. He won't understand you if you don't teach him the meaning. Especially because dogs follow body language and pitch over words. I can say any word and if i say it in the same tone as i say sit or down, my dog does it.|`|F8o5cbT5aa	How does he do on a leash? That's where I would start. Try leash training him. Whenever he is outside, just make sure it's on a leash. Then you can start training him to stay by your side. Also, right now, he is the Alpha in the family. YOU need to be the alpha. Check out Petsmart or Petco. They offer really affordable obedience training classes that I think would really help.|`|9zqW7oJBaa	Instead of teaching him such an old and obsolete command as NO, train your dog not to push on a lead and to Heel, much more useful than yelling him no to make him stop.|`|IaIl5xuHaa	you really have to be firm and consistent. When you want him to sit gently but firmly push his hind legs down immediately after he stays give him a treat ( this has to be done fast, if it doesn't work the first time don't be afraid to repeat it ...a lot). after a while he will understand. maybe your dog is deaf, if he's not maybe he doesn't know his name, call him by his name all of the time he'll pick it up. if that doesn't work try giving him a treat every time you say his name (immediately after) pretty soon every time you say his name he will come running because he thinks he is going to get a treat. <br>  to avoid your dog getting fat take a handful of food from the portion that<br>   you regularly give him for meals and give them to him as snacks.<br>  make sure to love and play with your dog a lot, and pretty soon he will come because  he wants to.|`|WQVEQjJ1aa	Typical for chocolate labs! If you have a fenced in yard, that is awesome, but if you don't consider getting a 25 ft training lead. It is long enough and you can have the dog under control. If he's that crazy, take him to an obedience class. Other wise fence and 25-30ft training lead.<br>  Sped more time with him and he'll obey you. <br>  Good luck, and remember when you are training him(or playing with) have some treats because when a dog does a good act they receive a treat and will behave knowing that they'll get a reward.<br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|xuQwNSYsaa	I know what your going through, my dog does listen but only when she wants to.  You want to use the word COME when she runs away. use a long tie out or rope first.  Make her COME for the treat if she doesn't rein in the leash then praise her as if she came on her own.  Start at a short distance then get further and further away from him Always be nice with a treat or praise.  Don't try it unless you know you can make him COME and never use the word when he's in trouble this way he will want to come when called. when he's doing something  wrong yelp instead of NO that will distract them.  It works with most dogs but nothing works all the time.  They remind me of teenagers that know better, but do it any way|`|MURxMnLtaa	If you love your dog, you'll keep it on a leash unless he is in a fenced yard.  Also, see about getting enrolled in a basic obedience class.  That will help you teach him about come, down, stay etc.<br>  <br>  Getting a retractable leash to use when he goes out to go potty will allow him to walk around and do his business without you having to follow him every step.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flexiusa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flexiusa.com/</a>|`|NyNaJmIkaa	if he understands the word "no" he won't come running to you when you are yelling it.<br>  Say come and his name. read this for some ideas.

fgxajTiBaa	The second one doesn't really look very formal, it looks like a pretty basic 'puppy' cut. Personally I like actual breed cuts, they accentuate the dog's natural body shape.<br>  <br>  For example, a SCWT SO many people chop off the fall and just keep it in a short even length. <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/SoftCoatedWheatenTerrierBaileycouch1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/Sof...</a> Honestly, when they look like this they don't even look like a Wheaten.<br>  <br>  But when they get a breed cut they look WONDERFUL! <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_LYxGQn08RU4/SFXhKiLUHnI/AAAAAAAAA1Y/ntHmmqzvq0g/s320/IRISH+SOFT+COATED+WHEATEN+TERRIER2.bmp" rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_LYxGQn08RU4/SF...</a><br>  <br>  So I guess I'm more for formal.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	The second one, since the first is the photobucket home page.|`|eidGiG3Kaa	Yea, you need to fix the first link because it doesn’t work. <br>  <br>  When considering different grooming styles you need to also consider which style works best for you. Many show cuts or “formal cuts” leave the dog with a lengthy amount of hair. For example <a href="http://www.dogfacts.org/shih-tzu-dog-pictures.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfacts.org/shih-tzu-dog-pic...</a> Shows a photo of a Shih tzu show cut. Many people may prefer this kind of grooming style compared to the second example you give but you have to consider the amount of time and money you will have to spend if you go with a show cut. I’m talking HOURS of brushing the dog every week. You will even have to brush the dog on a regular basis if you get the hair cut you show in the second link. A lot of people even go shorter on their shih tzu hair cuts such as <a href="http://www.showmeshihtzu.com/images/Tigerhc2.jpg." rel="nofollow">http://www.showmeshihtzu.com/images/Tige...</a> This way they wont have to spend as much time brushing the dog and will spend less money at the groomers. <br>  <br>  So, when choosing a grooming style for your dog keep that all in mind. Personally I prefer the puppy cut you show in the second link.
cnZlMojUaa	I dealt with liver issues in my rescue Scottie. Check into a liver support supplement. I've used 2: Denamarin and Denosyl.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/vet/denamarin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/vet/denamarin.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/vet/denosyl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/vet/denosyl.html</a><br>  <br>  Of the 2, Denamarin contains milk thistle/SAM-e and may be a better option. <br>  <br>  My experience with my dog: When we adopted her, her blood work showed an elevated liver enzyme and she was drinking excessively and overweight. We ran the Cushing's test. It was negative and we tried Denosyl. This was at age 4. At age 10, she lost her spleen and a liver biopsy taken at the same time showed a mottled liver. We ran the Cushing's test again. It was negative. About 8 months later she needed surgery for suspected bladder cancer (runs in my breed). Her liver biopsy this time revealed bacterial portal hepatitis. She was on a month course of Baytril. My dog's liver appeared mottled and enlarged on ultrasound. She suffered from elevated Alkaline Phosphatase levels the entire 7 years she was with us. The mottled appearance did lead us to do the second Cushing's test.<br>  <br>  One thing you really need to understand with a liver issue is that you must be very careful with any medications you give your dog. Most medications are processed in either the kidneys or liver. If one of these organs is not at capacity it can't process the medication and can lead to organ failure. My dog's ailing liver could not process her cancer medication and it caused irreversible kidney failure.<br>  <br>  I'm one that advocates doing everything you can to give an loved pet a quality of life. See your naturopath tomorrow, but also consider the Cushing's test. The Cushing's test isn't stressful for the dog. And good luck; I know this is very stressful for you and your dog.|`|AA10229248	I have a dog on phenobarbital - which is very hard on the liver.

LOH6UVh7aa	I drive a Dodge Diesel 4x4 3500. For the saftey of your horses your MINIMUM  wheel base HAS to be 114!!!  <br>  Don't underbuy! According to my sources, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to put gas mileage ahead of available power on your priority list. (As one person put it. "The first time your higher-mileage rig 'dies' on a steep hill. leaving you to unload and walk your horses to the top, those extra few miles per gallon won't mean a thing?) While a less powerful vehicle may also have a lower sticker price than one with a "workhorse" engine, repair bills or accidents can be your unhappy payback - and you'll really be unhappy if you're back at the dealership six months after buying a vehicle that just can't do the job.<br>  If a "tow package" is offered as an option for any vehicle you buy, say yes. What exactly is a tow package? Usually, this term refers to a group of manufacturer's options that'll help you tow your load; these options may include transmission - and engine - oil cooling systems (to prolong the life of these parts): heavy-duty suspension (to produce a firm, non-bouncy ride for you and your horses alike); heavy-duty wiring harness (for an easy, more reliable hookup to the trailer's electrical system): and a more favorable "axle ratio." <br>  Loaded tow weight: This is the weight of your trailer, plus the weight of your horses, feed, and gear. The greater the loaded tow weight, the more strain your towing vehicle must endure, and the bigger, and better-equipped vehicle you must have if you're to haul without accident or breakdown <br>  The most accurate - and recommended - way to determine your loaded tow weight is to take your fully loaded trailer, horses, hay, and all, to a public scale to be weighed. That advice isn't much help, though, when you don't have a towing vehicle to start with, and may not yet have purchased a trailer! Therefore, we've guesstimated loaded tow weights (LTW) for you; on your spec sheet, record the number that best matches your circumstances:<br>  Maximum number of horses I'll haul:<br>  <br>  a. One-estimated LTW 4.000 pounds<br>  b. Two-estimated 15W 5,500 pounds<br>  c. Three-estimated LTW 8,000 pounds<br>  d. Four-estimated LTW, 10,000 pounds<br>  <br>  Tow rating: In theory, you should be able to match your loaded tow weight to the tow rating quoted in a vehicle's product literature, and be all set. The matter Isn't that simple, however, and here's why.<br>  First of all, depending on how it's equipped, a single model can have as many as a dozen tow ratings: my sources say this is especially true of trucks. Not only that, but tow ratings are calculated on the assumption that the towing vehicle itself won't be heavily loaded - yet when the towing vehicle is heavily loaded, the tow rating goes down accordingly.<br>  This business about tow rating is just one reason why I urge you to take your spec sheet with you when you go shopping. More importantly, don't take salesman's word on tow rating. Instead, contact manufacturers to obtain the detailed tow-rating information on vehicles that interest you. <br>  Vehicle weight is one of several factors that affect the stability of your overall hauling rig. Ideally, vehicle weight should match or exceed your loaded tow weight: that way, the loaded trailer doesn't end up being the tail that wags the dog. If you were to a pair a light towing vehicle with a substantially heavier towed load, you'd find it difficult to steer and stop. Downhill travel would be especially dangerous - the trailer could sway out of control, pulling your entire rig off the road. Though a match of vehicle weight to loaded tow weight is ideal, it's not always possible (just imagine the 10,000-pound monstermoblle it'd take to tow 10,000 pounds)-nor is it necessary. Provided your towing rigs engine size, wheelbase, and axle ratio are adequate, you'll be road-safe with a vehicle weight that's three-quarters of your loaded tow weight. On your spec sheet, record your answers to the following:<br>  <br>  Minimum towing vehicle weight to haul:<br>  <br>  a. One horse - 3,000 pounds<br>  a. Two horse - 3,700 pounds<br>  a. Three horse - 4,300 pounds<br>  a. Four horse - 4,500 + pounds<br>  <br>  Wheelbase: As I stated earlier, a towing vehicle's wheelbase is the distance measured form front to rear axle, The longer the wheelbases. the greater your vehicle's ability to hug the road, hence, the safer it is to tow with. The minimum safe wheelbase for pulling a standard (no dressing room), fully loaded two-horse with a frame-mounted hitch is 114 Inches. That fact alone automatically disqualifies some vehicles from consideration as safe horse-hauling rigs - and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! You'll be hauling live cargo, not a load-stable boat or other item, and thus will need all the stability you can get.  I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ******edit*****<br>  Thank you Buck & Greg!|`|XJ9oSR2daa	2001 F250 crewcab, 4x4 short box 7.3L diesel<br>  <br>  With your scenario a 1/2 ton you might be able to get away with, but nothing less than that.

If you get a goose-neck you can haul more than you can with a pull behind.|`|ZGiVn4MUaa	ud b better off geting a pickup that is bigger cuz  we have a 3500 chevy 97 mega cab long box nd we pull a bigger trailer wit 4 horses in it nd we do ok wit it.....but u dont want somthing to small cuz ull ruin ur engine jus get a 2 wheel drive tho ull get better gas milage...also depends on the trailer nd how many horses nd how big they are to|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	My friend hauls with a suburban, just a 2 horse slant load but it did fine.<br>  <br>  My mother used to use her Dodge Durango, had to go slow up hills but it got WAYYY better gas milage than a giant truck.|`|ddTDArsOaa	Land Rover Defender|`|px27V5N9aa	Nothing worse than people that get a truck they say can pull the trailer just fine....but what about stopping?  What if their is a serious accident and you have to jam on those breaks?  You gonna stop those horses and the trailer too?<br>  My ford explorer can pull a trailer of 3 horses but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be stupid enough to do it!<br>  If I had a severe emergency and HAD to get my ONE horse to the vet I'd pull the trailer with it...but it's a straight away and only a 2h bumper pull.<br>  <br>  <br>  2002 FORD F250, superduty, V10, long bed<br>  <br>  AMERICANMADE AND MULEREINER GAVE GREAT ADVICE!|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	I had a 1995 chevrolet 1500 z71 short bed extened cab pick up and it towed a two horse with thoroughbreds in it very well. You can get them used for a very decent price and i NEVER had any problems with it. It was going strong at 225 thousand miles before It got into an accident. I drove it as my daily driver and loved every minute of it!|`|hEXb1unraa	My dream truck is a Ford 350 DRW...dulley rear wheel....crew cab....drool.....but at 45,000 new its hard to swing.....but Im seriously thinking about buying used...now is the time to buy big trucks and in all my experience, pulling with a big, powerful truck with the dulley rear tires is by far the sweetest hauling rig....i prefer hauling with a gooseneck as it is more stable and an all around safer way to transport....but For a 2 horse at minimum a 1/2 to 3/4 ton with 4 wheel drive....proper trailer brakes in your truck and proper towing package.|`|RloOJ43haa	I use an F-250.<br>  <br>  I agree with Mulereiner that you might be able to use a 1/2 ton pickup for a small two-horse trailer.<br>  <br>  Also, listen to AmericanMadeMorgans.|`|5TCewPYRaa	We tow our 2001 4 horse Keifer Built Genesis GN trailer with a 2004 Toyota Tundra, CrewMax, 4x4 V8 with TRD and Tow Package. <br>  <br>  We used to haul our 2 horse BP with a 1996 CrewCab V6 4x4 Toyota Tacoma with Tow Package, 2 extra suspension leafs. <br>  <br>  Remember to get trailer brakes on whatever trailer you purchase--electromagnetic are the most popular, surge brakes are okay, but EM are much better.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  BB|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I tow my 2-horse trailer with a 2002 Chevy Silverado 2500HD.  That's way more truck than I really need, though.  It is nice to have the extra power.<br>  <br>  You can use a 1/2 ton pickup, and the wheelbase of your tow vehicle should be at least 114 inches.  About 15 years ago I was considering a Dodge Dakota to be my all in one vehicle for towing and commuting, but in the end I stuck with my full size truck (a 1985 Ford F-150 at that time), and had a small car for driving to work.  Now I have a newer truck and a newer car, but still the same set up.  12 mpg for the truck, 32 mpg for the car.
ptNy4uicaa	It depends, I don't think it is rabies, you may still want to take him to the vet. Foaming can occur after eating, or chewing on toys which is normal, but drooling/foaming may also be a sign of dental disease, in which case to be attended to immediately.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	yes!<br>  Get it checked out!<br>  - It could be serious!<br>  Have you given it flea/tick medication within a few days?<br>  He could have swollowed it!|`|oKvyaIPSaa	yes|`|jfbF4MOOaa	I think it would be a good idea to have him checked out by the vet.  It could be nothing, or it could be something very serious.  The only way to know is for your vet to examine him.  I am sure this would help you with piece of mind as well.  Good luck!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	He could be getting into something he's not supposed to.  If this couldn't be the case, I'd at least call the Vet to see what they think.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	YOU SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED he might rabies but id go to the vet and check|`|VtOj4kYdaa	Yes you should be. I would take my dog to the vet ASAP. Good Luck!!|`|FNdsPNrJaa	I would pay attention to when he foams. Did he just eat or drink? Did he come out from somewhere you couldnt see? If he did he could be eating something bad for him and thats why theres foam. Also when dogs chew alot they can foam. If he doesnt seem to be aggresive at all I wouldnt worry. However, you may want to try an aggression test. Put a glove on a slowly reach for his food while hes eating. If he snaps at you I would take him to the vet!! However with puppies and how much they tend to chew on things....I see no cause to worry just yet.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	call a vet<br>  its not rabies but he could have another problem. i would call the vet just in case. It can also be signs of heat stroke.<br>  but really this is normal if your dog is eating at a bone or chew toy b/c its the state of mind the dog is at.|`|WBEUi3gdaa	You should probably call a vet to ask but its most likely nothin big my dog use to do that when he was chewing on a bone or something he kinda just grew out of it though..

ld2vmypNaa	YES..s little babies can drown.<br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle.. <br>  <br>  ***You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  <br>  <br>  Set them on a 20 gallon tank per dozen.  Provide them with a dry land area and a shallow water area.  Newborns need to master the art of floating and staying underwater for long periods of time.  Don't assume that they will survive only with water.  Newborn red-eared sliders can actually drown if you neglect them a dry land area<br>  . Once they are set up in their tank start feeding them.  It is important to get them to eat.  Start by offering them one by one all items on the proper slider diet.  Note:  You might have to 'chop' all of the food you offer since they are small babies.   This includes choping earthworms, mealworms, crickets guppies.<br>  .  I know, this sounds disgusting but believe me, you will get used to after a while and it won't bother you anymore. Newborns need to have their full spectrum light.  So don't forget to include that in the tank.  The full spectrum light will help the newborn shells to harden. Keep the water neatly clean.  If you don't have a filter change the water every two days.  This is very important since  baby sliders are more prone to getting eye infecitions (that can leave them blind for life or even kill them) than adult sliders.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies.<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets<br>  Red-Eared Slider: <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Sounds fine. The larger the tank, the better. As long as the turtles can get out easily to bask under the UVB light, they will be fine.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	::sigh:: make sure they still have a basking light, uvb, and basking spot. btw they might eat your fish.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	Yes that is fine... Sounds to me like they are happier in this tank.
5TM9P8tsaa	*Must be puppy formula only. Anything else can kill them. If milk comes out there nose, they will die for sure. Must feed with eye dropper real slow and every four hours around the clock. There may be something physically wrong with them. IF the mother knows that for sure they push them out of the nest. This is true with most animals.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	Definitely call animal control, they will take care of it, or maybe even the humane society.|`|H2v3QFWRaa	<a href="http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.htm...</a>|`|nMe35c9Aaa	NO BABY FORMULA PLEASE!!! NO GOOD JUST MILK READ THIS!!!!! first off there not going to hurt you they are only babies and at this age they don't even have teeth.they are about 7 week if there eyes are open. second POEPLE duh she said animal control is closed. sorry for people who don't read well. you should take them there in the morning if thats what you want to do( my animal control puts them down right away). but until then the box is fine with the towel. you should put a heating pad in there if you don't have one take a water bottel and fill it with hot water and put it in there but make sure that the towel is between them and what ever you use to warm them so they don't get burnt.keeping them warm is most important next to feeding. do not feed them until they are warm and have been for at least a half hour. now for food take a little cup and put a small amount of milk in it and yogart if you have some( only a small amount and the yogart will help fill them sence they have not eatin in a while) and put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. this will kill the enzymes in the milk so it won't hurt there tummies you can feed them from a syring that is the best thing. you can get them at the drug store in the baby section. please do not use a eye dropper it feeds to fast then the milk gets in there nose and they can asperate( drowned basically) or they get an infection in there nose that can kill them. so please take your time while feeding and go nice and slow. this will get them threw the night. then do whatever you are gonna do. if you have any more questions feel fre to mail me i will be glad to help.|`|JXTdMa3maa	<a href="http://www.mary.cc/squirrels/foundababy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mary.cc/squirrels/foundababy....</a><br>  Hope that helps|`|APt16L4Kaa	call animal control.<br>  no joke|`|0QZgZbLRaa	Keep them warm and in a dark place. If they are old enough to move around on their own put a dish of water in the box. Get them to the rescue centre ASAP in the morning.<br>  I'm assuming that you are in the US. In the UK grey squirrels are not considered indigenous and it is illegal to rehabilitate them and then release them back to the wild. For this reason the RSPCA has to put down any grey squirrels that are taken to them. I used to volunteer for the RSPCA and was always told that if I ever found an injured squirrel I'd be better off trying to nurse it at home where the authorities wouldn't know if I let it go again. Thankfully I've never been in that situation.<br>  I do regularly raise and release wild orphaned ducklings.|`|A0eDA6RGaa	you should never touch them, even to feed them, because they are wild animals and might hurt you. You should put them somewher they can get out, like an enclosed box with lots of air holes, just remembet that they COULD get out. and keep them somewhere warm and they should be ok until the animal rescue opens, then let them come get them. Dont try too hard to save them and get hurt, because by puting them in the warm you can help them without getting hurt by playing with the "cute" animals. If you didnt find them, they probably would have frozen to death anyway so at least you are helping them|`|I38WF5aFaa	Leave them where you found them.  Its possible the mother will find them.  its also possible she threw them from the nest because they aren't healthy enough to survive.  If the mother doesn't find them a fox or other predator will have an easy snack.  It sounds harsh but your chances of successfully rearing them is very small.  If they get eaten their death won't be for nothing.|`|31gN5L58aa	WEBSITES:<br>  <a href="http://www.orphanedwildlifecare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orphanedwildlifecare.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4469374_take-care-baby-squirrels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4469374_take-car...</a><br>  i realy hoped i helped!!!!<br>  :( save the lil squirrells!!!
