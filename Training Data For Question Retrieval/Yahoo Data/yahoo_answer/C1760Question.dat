They put Obama on the teleprompter and wouldn't let him off during the campaign because he kept on slipping up and telling the truth, which always got him in trouble. Sarah used one during the convention speech, as they all did, but the liberal media only made a big story about her using it then, when everyone did for that speech. Why doesn't the main stream media say anything about it now, when Obama uses a teleprompter to even announce his democrat elitist tax cheats? I mean appointees?

The Kepler telescope was launched by NASA to orbit the Sun and search the stars for Earth-like planets.       http://thedaytoday.net       I tend to think they will find quite a few Earthlike planets - it will be intersting to know what variation of life that would inhabit them.       Is humanoid the optimum lifeform ?   Will it be carbon based or can different planets come up with radically different forms of life ?   Can other planets stay stable enough to support intelligent life ?      All these questions and more will probably be answered in the next 10 years - or maybe in the next few days here.      Any thoughts - go on, go wild.

20090307084854AAGxeN2	News & Events;Current Events	Would you let your children or even any elses' children laugh at an old lady burping ?	i find it terrible that this sweet old lady has been forced into seclusion by a bunch of rude, ill-mannered louts.      LONDON: A British grandma has revealed that she has become the victim of her own constant burping, due to which she has been leading a secluded life for two years. Jean Driscoll, 72, a divorced grandmother-of-five from Chelmsford, Essex, started belching two years ago, and despite taking anti-wind treatments and visiting doctors and specialists, she has still not been cured. Driscoll has now confined herself to her home to avoid the embarrassment of people mocking her.       "It was quite mild but gradually it grew much worse. I don't go out any more. People laugh and stare. It's awful travelling to the hospital on the train, everyone looks at you," the Sun quoted her as saying. "People stand and laugh at me. I've had enough of being stared at," she said.       Driscoll, who lives with her son Stephen, 36, was referred to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, but doctors there could not find out what was causing her predicament.       "Obviously I'm pleased there's nothing seriously wrong but I would really like an answer," she said. "I've got no life now. It's making me depressed to be trapped in my home. Nobody has been able to tell me what's causing this. I find it very upsetting," she added.        http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World... 
20090307085916AAi7jFB	News & Events;Current Events	What can women of the world do to help the women of Afghanistan?	There has to be a way. Will they even know that the world outside is celebrating womenhood on March 8?       UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rapes targeting girls as young as seven are on the increase in Afghanistan where conditions for women are little better than under the Taliban, the U.N. and rights groups say.. "Violence is tolerated or condoned within the family and community, within traditional and religious leadership circles, as well as the formal and informal justice system," said Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.   "Rapes in the country have been growing tremendously, particularly child rapes within the ages of 9, 8, 7, even lesser than that," said Wazhma Frogh, director of Global Rights Afghanistan. Domestic violence against child brides is widespread, said Suraya Pakzad, the founder of the Voice of Women organization, who was married at age 14 and has six children. She said girls as young as 10 face "violation" by husbands 40 years their senior. "By the end ... women, or girls, run away." But women without husbands, especially widows, may have it even worse in Afghanistan, the report says. Without a spouse, the women are reduced to begging to feed their children.    Options outside the home are limited where the Taliban holds sway in Afghanistan. The Taliban's interpretation of strict Islamic law, or sharia, has included banning girls from school and the workplace. Even in areas not overrun by the Taliban, women face risks outside the home. "The assassination of the most prominent national female senior police officer, in Kandahar in September 2008, underscores the tremendous risks faced by women in public life," the report says.        http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapc...

KATHMANDU: Ten Nepalese women, all Everest summiteers, are set to climb the highest mountains in other continents to spread the message of world peace and women's empowerment. The mountaineers announced their plan to launch the expeditions to climb the highest mountains in the other continents to spread the message of world peace, women's empowerment and to promote international tourism in Nepal.       The announcement came ahead of the International Women's Day March 8. Nepalese women are brave and they will prove that they are as important as women in other developed countries, said Nepal tourism board's chief Prachanda Man Pradhan.       The all women group is led by Sushmita Maskey and includes Nima Dolma Sherpa, 17, and Nawang Futi Sherpa, 31. Nima climbed Everest last year and become the youngest woman summiteer. Other climbers in the team include Maya Gurung, Usha Bista, Saili Basnet, Chnu SHrestha, Asha Kumari Singh, Pema Dolma Sherpa and Pujan Acharya.        http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World...

A judge and a presiding judge of a juvenile court accepted 2.6 million dollars from the co-owner and builder of a private detention centre where children aged from 10 to 17 were locked up.      The cases of up to 2,000 children put into custody over the past seven years are now being reviewed in a billowing scandal dubbed "kids for cash".       The alleged racket has raised questions about the cosy ties between the courts and private contractors, and about the harsh treatment meted out to adolescents.      Is this not child abuse on a grand scale?

Is anyone re-assured about the government having a controlling stake in so many banks? On the one hand you can argue they will help (allegedly) control the corrupt and gourmandising banking corporate scum and mitigate the damage they cause.      On the other hand, does it fill you with confidence that the "supreme dream-team" of Brown 'n' Darling are at the helm of these financial institutions?      So, basically, are you happier to see the banking behemoths of Lloyds and RBS in the sweaty grip of the government?

Adolf Hitler alleged to have said this on the eve of ww2.      Adolf Hitler probably thought that no one did anything or simply didnt care enough to save the Armenians from the Turkish genocide so he would be able to get away by doing the same to the European J5ws.      He was unfortunately correct. in 1918 the world indifferent and not wanting another war or simply not caring did nothing to stop the Turk from genociding the Armenians. Sure the politicians as usual made alot of noise, but thats all they did        - a bit like nowaday when all the countries make noise and protesters scream their lungs out on street demos over Palestine issue but thats all they could really do against the SECOND most powerful army on earth      Population projections show that by 2050 the ARab will outnumber the Israeli J5w by 75% due to larger birth rates- so time is on their side.      A short violent blip here and their will do no good for Israel it needs a permenant solution now as its only hope.      SO my question why dont they forcibly export all the Palestinans and settle them in Western Iraq with their Sunni Arab brethren by building train tracks to the East?      Or better still do forced marches across the unforgiving Jordanian desert and solve their problem forever?      Surely enough the world will make noise but in the long run history has often shown population expulsions to be just as effective in making peace. It has been used quite effectivly in places like Bosnia, Rwanda, India-Pakistan, oh and dont forget the Red Indian or the Aborigine?
