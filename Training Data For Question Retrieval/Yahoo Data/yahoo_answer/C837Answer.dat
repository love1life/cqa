qcyaBE27aa	Depending on how old your son is, it could be a variety of things- or maybe it's nothing at all.   Your son could have gotten sick in another way...  But if he trully is sick, and you are positive it's from the eggs (I don't think you can get sick from sugar or milk)  there aren't many diseases you can get from eggs except Salmonella, there are two types of Salmonella, one is almost certain with great sickness, and the other is not as serious.  I hope that your son gets better.|`|36a3ynpJaa	It should clear up by then.  Be sure he gets lots of fluids and maybe pedialyte to keep his electrolytes in balance. Two weeks is a very long time for food poisoning.  After three days he should go to a doctor.      Most doctors have read up on food poisoning...|`|ygimTNzoaa	Like a cake dough? I don't think it's because of that. I ate things like that all the time and never had problems. But it may be, always that small chance.|`|QWFvw2yvaa	salmonella sounds right to me.  Many people say it's okay to eat raw eggs but really its not.  You should really take him to the doctor and find out whats wrong with him.|`|fyKydb6Iaa	Many people eat raw eggs ( egg nog ) etc, if he had salmonella  he would be much sicker, if you are still concerned check with a Dr. better safe than sorry|`|pSnIDBP5aa	why did you give it to him?!?!? and why have you waited 2 weeks afterwards?!?!?!?!    its probably not salmonella, might be shigella though. Thats a different type of food poisoning and its bad, i went to hospital for it before.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Not all raw eggs cause poisoning, after 2 weeks it would have run through his system.  He might just have the flu.  My Mom used to make us eggnog with raw eggs, milk and sugar and we never got sick.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  The most common salmonella poisoning symptoms are as follows:   Abdominal Cramps   Diarrhea   Nausea   Fever   Headache   If you have been exposed to salmonella bacteria, you will develop symptoms within a few hours to three days after exposure.
kEQX5sswaa	In the US they take out the Thujone, which is the chemical in the wormwood that gets you so messed up. I drank Lucid absinthe and it tasted so nasty. Like extra strong Jagermeister with some sort of weird spice added to it. It did the job though. A fifth of it got me and 3 of my equally heavy-drinking friends completely wasted.|`|68f4017c29580b34085d7843ed1d4782aa	You should order only from legit sights. You may get fake ones. But you can buy it at Bevmo - right here in the states. I have been told that this is something you may not want to drink.|`|b1iFaaEsaa	a lot of the absinthe you find online is not the "real thing" since it was banned in many countries.      If it is the real thing it may be confiscated.|`|mxEzagl7aa	Absinthe that contains the wormwood is basically illegal to produce which means that any production is outside of the control of qualified and respectable distilleries.  All of the major producers have modified their recipes or have simply shut down.   If you did find some absinthe with wormwood and were caught in the distribution or shipping process, you can face problems with both the state and federal government.  Original absinthe has the distinction of being the only other type of liquor besides moonshine to be declared illegal.  Theres good reason for this; wormwood will destroy the human body faster than most other illegal drugs. Also, since any production would be illegal there is absolutely not guarantee that youll get liquor.  You might end up with a blend of anything from caustic chemicals to low-grade alcohol to radiator fluid.    Its probably best to refrain from engaging a pursuit of this type of alcohol.      As for legal absinthe:    Illinois lacks many of the prohibitive liquor laws that bog down sales in other states, such as Indiana and many southern states so there will be fewer hurdles for you to pass through. Most of the problem rests with the foreign liquor retailer as well as the Customs Department of the United States.  Most overseas-based sellers have strict limitations or they simply wont deal with customers in the US.  Besides this, I know for a fact that delivery will require you to be present and to show a valid Illinois ID.    However, one major problem that does exist is the extensive cost of shipping from overseas as well as the amount of time that that would take.  Anything, including liquor, sent from overseas would likely have to come via air freight and that can get very expensive.  Under normal circumstances this would be a problem, but its compounded by the fact that you can actually get several good to excellent brands of absinthe and related liquors in the United States.  One excellent brand French brand is Pernod.  There are other excellent brands as well, with many being domestically produced.  Depending on where you live in Illinois, you might be able to locate a well-stocked liquor store that carries one or more brands.  If that doesnt work, try domestic brands of absinthe or locate a website in the continental United States that might be able to help you for a smaller shipping charge.|`|tZ8hHhWbaa	No you will not have any problems. Please ignore Lionel Hutz type opinions on this matter.    You can order Euro absinthe with thujone for perosnal consumption but you might breach  21 CFR 172.510. if you try to re-sell it in a bar or something.  According to the FDA, alcoholic beverages must be thujone-free pursuant to 21 CFR 172.510.|`|5MeggG3Laa	omg i was just looking at absinthe last night lol  well if they take out the wormwood then its not absinthe anymore, its just alcohol, in that case you might as well just buy some vodka  you have to have the wormwood in it to make it absinthe

d482e5f2e11aa70ff3043f57722994b9aa	I think I can help you here, I sell tabs on E-Bay, in fact, I supply the top three sellers of tabs on E-Bay with the tabs that they sell. I also understand your concerns about shipping.    I had a deal that went bad, it happens, just one of those things. But a Fraternity in Florida bought 110,000 tabs for $500 (US$), and they did not make it in time for the contest they were in. So...the University of Florida is stuck with 110,000 tabs, and I am stuck with a Pay pal negotiation.    As both sides want to leave this deal peacefully, and a series of refunds have been issued, there are currently 110,000 tabs available for $400 plus the buyers choice of shipping to anybody who wants them.    coindude1@charter.net|`|vMOOE0qaaa	Hi,  Were you after TAB or Pop Tarts?

N53iI8weaa	I would have thought that as a student you would be able to write    "I HEAR Asda's cheap" - but apparently not - and I assume Icelnad is a typo    However...... Some of the newest - and foreign - ones like Lidl and Netto are cheap as are Asda, but you'll find there's so much price fixing amongst all the others that there's very little difference - I mean - 6 pints of milk cost the same no matter where you shop, so the only thing you can do is keep a note of who does what - the cheapest - and where.  Beware special offers, especially three for the price of two when you didn't even want two and won't ever use three before it goes off - you'll be hard pressed to find offers like that on non-perishables ! ! !|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Lidl or Aldi are best---Lidl is 25% cheaper than Asda|`|ToztjpAsaa	Depends where you are in the country.  Every supermarket will have headline offers on selected items to get people through the door, then bump up the price on other stuff to make their profit.  It's difficult to recommend one supermarket that is consistently cheaper than the others, but I would recommend the Co-op for its higher ethical standards and the quality of its own-brand foods.  Steer clear of Tesco.  All their own-brand food is overpriced garbage.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	personally I use a mixture of    Asda, Tesco and Morrison's    They are all a little bit different, and if you buy their special offers you can save quite a bit of money    I'm not fan of Iceland, but everyone is entitled to their own choice|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Not a stupid question hun!

Then spread it on the bottom of a 9X13" pan. Pat it in a bit.    Melt the chocolate chips in a seperate bowl. (I put them in a glass measuring cup and microwave til melted. Be careful because the chips melt fairly quickly and you dont want to burn the chocolate.

AA12198711	Make some Taco Boats.      Get some WonTon Wraps from your local grocery store. They usually hang in the produce isle near the Tofu. They come 60 to a package.    I can make about 48-50 of these with two pounds of ground beef.    Brown your ground beef ( 1-2 pounds) with chopped sweet onion (large or small). Drain and add the dry Ranch Dressing mix (1 pkg. for 1 lb. 2 for 2 lbs.). Stir in well.    While your meat is cooking take the Wonton Wraps and place them individually in a muffin tin to bake and form a small bowl. Transfer them to a cookie sheet after you finish baking them.    Spoon in your meat mixture to each bowl and add grated cheddar cheese to the top. Place them back in the oven to melt the cheese slightly.

Really soft will make good guacamole but you need them a little firmer for salad slices etc.    You can try this to ripen an avocado--Use a brown paper bag and sprinkle inside w flour.  Add the avacado to the bag. Fold the top of the bag tightly.  Check the avacado every 12 hours or so.  Should ripen in 24-48 hours.|`|ODcB4zSdaa	slightly press the skin it should be slightly squishy but staying mostly firm. it really depends on preference thought.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	You should determine when you will be using them.

bC42lYYtaa	DANGERS OF SPLENDA....    Although Splenda has been touted by its manufacturers as the magic silver bullet for dieters and low-carb lifestyle fans, its safety and potential for long term side effects have come into question.     The FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) seemingly approved Splenda and sucralose for use as a food additive to large scale manufacturers, however theres been a great deal of debate questioning just thorough their testing methods were. For example, the FDA has never formerly announced whether their tests were performed on humans and/or animals. Their tests, along with those of Splendas own manufacturer, revealed signs of shruken thymus glands, atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus, increased cercal weight, lowered red blood cell count  and the list goes on. In one small scale test of Splenda on diabetics, the FDA found a significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin, which could potentially lessen the subjects control over the diabetic condition. In short, the long-term dangers of Splenda are entirely unknown, and there are zero studies currently underway to determine same.      DANGERS OF SWEET N LOW    Shrunken thymus glands (up to 40% shrinkage)   Enlarged liver and kidneys.   Atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus   Increased cecal weight   Reduced growth rate   Decreased red blood cell count   Hyperplasia of the pelvis   Extension of the pregnancy period   Aborted pregnancy   Decreased fetal body weights and placental weights   Diarrhea|`|0CKJfjrlaa	Aspartame has been linked to some cancer cases...|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Splenda really has no negative aspects to it;  it's derived from sugar and sucralose.  However, other artificial sweeteners have asparatame, which can cause cancer .. or other chemicals and preservatives that can do who-knows-what:) ...  Your problem is not just with the artificial sweeteners, but the carbonation in the sodas.  It's not recommended to have more than 2 (still too many) sodas per day; since the carbonation can be very harmful to your internal organs - and can actually cause you to GAIN weight!

Makes about 11 pounds."   Original recipe yield: 10 inch tube cake.  Servings:140 (change)     --------------------------------------...    INGREDIENTS:  2 3/4 cups golden raisins   2 cups dried currants   1 cup orange zest   6 ounces candied lemon peel   3/4 cup chopped candied citron   1/3 cup candied angelica   1/3 cup red candied cherries   1/3 cup green candied cherries   1/2 cup brandy   4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon ground mace   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   2 cups butter, softened   2 cups white sugar   10 eggs, separated   2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice   1/3 cup sherry   1 cup sherry     --------------------------------------...    DIRECTIONS:  Place raisins and currants in a bowl, and add enough water to just cover them. Soak overnight.   Chop orange and lemon peel quite fine; do the same with the citron, angelica, and both types of cherries. Pour 1/2 cup brandy over fruit, and allow to stand overnight.   Sift together flour, mace, and nutmeg.   Beat egg yolks until thick and light, then beat in 1 cup of sugar a little at a time. Stir in lemon juice. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.   In a large bowl, cream the butter, and then add 1 cup sugar a little at a time; beat until smooth. Combine yolk mixture with creamed mixture. Add flour and 1/3 cup sherry alternately to the creamed mixture. Stir in all the fruit, and fold in stiffly beaten egg whites. Pour batter into a well greased and floured 10 inch mold or tube pan. This cake can also be made in 2 large loaf pans.   Place a pan of hot water in the bottom of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven. Place cake pans in oven, and bake about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue baking 100 minutes for large cake, or 40 minutes for loaf cakes. Cakes are done when a toothpick comes out dry. Turn cake(s) out on rack to cool.   Wrap cake(s) in cheesecloth soaked in sherry, and store in airtight container for a month or more. If the cheesecloth dries out in the mellowing period soak it again with the same spirits, and rewrap the cake.|`|AA10349833	hey helen, did we eat this cake when we were little?  if so, we need to make it this weekend, right away, yummy.|`|AA11215165	try going to allrecipe.com and typing it into the search engine.
AA11601434	This is a great question. Angel food cakes are inverted over a funnel or bottle neck to cool. Otherwise, if placed on the pan's bottom on a rack, the cake would deflate.    And no, Angel food cakes won't typically fall out of their pan. Because you didn't grease it, the cake sticks to the side until cool and you run a sharp knife around the edges to release it.      The only exception is when you bake an angel or chiffon in a pan with a slippery non-stick surface. I have done this and my cakes still hold fast, but some have told me they have inverted cakes in non-stick pans and the cakes have slid out.|`|AA11373085	I've never heard of that, we never do, and ours turn out beautifully.|`|AA10465219	The cake is inverted in its pan to cool which prevents its structure from shrinking or falling (deflating)|`|bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	It doesn't.

xrRZeROmaa	In Germany, it is preferred.  It won't taste the same, but it will be quite good.  Just don't use the whole can, drink the rest.|`|ubukt8WWaa	Yes, you can.  There are lots of recipes for au jus that use beer.  Budwiser is a good choice because it is mild and not very bitter.  It'll be different, but good.  You might want to add some onion too.  If your beef dish doesn't already have onion, just sautee a little, then simmer your beef broth with it.|`|WYHZTaP1aa	No, I don't think it would taste good.  I would make brown gravy with the beef broth.
hFO5coFKaa	probably not.  they were probably just dried out.  You wouldn't want to do that kind of thing with veggies, fruit, grains, or meat tho!

vnJG8UYJaa	I am not a "pasta" person, but I think the lasagna is pretty good.      It costs more to make home made lasagna that it does to order it from Pizza Hut.  I think it is an okay deal, especially when you don't want to cook.|`|8I4QY6osaa	It's ok.  Not like the home-made ones.  But it's enough to satisfy your cravings for tonight.|`|PBY9MNDFaa	I've not had the lasagne because I don't eat mince but I ordered the seafood arrabiata last week for lunch and it came out half frozen.... no not just cold but actually frozen.  When I told the waitress she asked if I wanted her to heat it up!!!  I said no thanks, I don't want food poisoning for my lunch, I'll just leave it.  My sister did have the lasagne however and she said it was warm but not hot.  Such a shame because I had been looking forward to trying their new pastas.  Big disappointment.|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Aww mannn. Now im hungry. Thanks alot.  ;]|`|k6JJSEQFaa	I tried some a few months ago and found it to be flavourless, dry, and nasty. But then I tried a different kind from another Pizza Hut and it was okay, it could use a little more flavour, but it was okay. I ate the whole tray alone in one night, so it could not have been that bad. But I was hungry so idk. It might taste better where you live.|`|KQQDYFBIaa	well it really depends on who makes it, my boyfriend is the manager at pizzahut and he brings me stuff home alot. he adds extra cheese and seasonings also soo i like it|`|AA12138071	depends on what you like.

g6OlCaOlaa	http://frugalliving.about.com/od/foodsav...    This recipe was pretty easy and it turned out delicious.  I added a can of corn, some rice (the kind you cook in a bag -http://www.usafoods.com.au/uploads/1171_...  - it looks like this and you just follow the directions, then mix it into chili, I also added a few extra spices...but that is just because I like it spicy. anyway, this is pretty easy|`|mICXNVqmaa	Spaghetti. I made it when I was 14. It is very easy. Noodles + sauce (and you can cut up veggies to put in the sauce if you want to make it more fancy and tasty). You could have tofu on the side or salad too. Basically just boil the noodles until they are flaccid, cook the sauce and serve.
o2QlBvfraa	I personally love cucumber finger sandwiches.  I've had them both with just sliced cucumbers and with a cucumber salad made with cream cheese.  Scones are very traditional and can be either sweet or savory.  Here are some links with lists of traditional foods.  Some of them have recipes and others you may need to google to find a recipe.  You can probably also find some things pre-made.  The tea party idea sounds like a lot of fun!|`|KgtlyWDXaa	What a nice idea!  You could serve quiches, or creamed chicken in puff pastry shells, or crustless finger sandwiches or salmon mousse or crab cakes.  Salad could be just a simple green salad with a vinegrette dressing garnished with goat cheese and grape tomatoes.    And of course, petit fours for dessert, or scones, a fruit platter    Sandwich fillings could include, chicken, ham, tuna, egg, crab, shrimp or salmon salad, cucumber or watercress, ham and swiss, chicken breast, tomato and lettuce; grilled portobello mushrooms
JTu1cLkYaa	You can check on peanut butter recalls on this site    http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/pe...    It allows you to browse or search a specific item.|`|AA12336927	Honey I can't tell you for sure YES. To be safe we are staying away from all products that use peanut butter.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Check on the recall, I believe Canada has referred more peanut products back.
Au0HK3O6aa	Well it depends on if you are a rabbit or not.   Seriously how many carrots could you eat in a day?  I am sure you could not eat so many that you would have a problem with them. As someone has already said, too much of anything is not good for you even if you like it.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	You are supposed to eat 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. A serving of carrots is 1 c. chopped carrots or 12 baby carrots. I wouldn't suggest you eat 5-10 servings of carrots though, as a variety of fruits and veggies is better for you.|`|AA10625089	No set rule. just remember that they are high in sugar content and if you eat a lot every day for a long time, your skin will turn orange from the beta carotene.|`|kYHWpK5Laa	not alot cuz you can turn orange|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	it doesn't matter, but everything has it minium and maxium, something too much is not good you know|`|cXVslImpaa	carrots are yummy...so.....lots!! they are also good with cheese    really though, you arent really SUPPOSED to eat any amount. if you dont like carrots, you dont technically have to eat any your entire life as long as you have other fruits and vegetables or, like, a vitamin to get the nutrients and stuff.     just remember, even really healthy stuff is bad if you eat too much of it. eating carrots until you explode is probably worse for you than if you eat one of those funnel cakes at canadas wonderland (dang, those are good though)     dont eat too many a day, try to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables. but if you wanna eat a lot of carrots, i would take a normal sized cup, fill it with carrots then just eat those. usually a cup is a serving of vegetables or something, so that would likely be a good amount.    if you find yourself getting really full though, then stop eating, because then its probably bad for you    lol hope i helped ;)    mmmmm im gonna eat some carrots now (but not too much ;D) im hungry :P

If the beer and liquor you're drinking tastes gross, they you're drinking the wrong stuff.

Of course it can kill you, hence the term alcohol poisoning.

This is because it grows on the branches of a stemmed plant, it has seeds inside it and another tamato plant can grow out of it (just like an apple for example).<br>  <br>  It is however USED as a vegetable in sald dishes and so on, and is not eaten like a fruit.|`|ZeV8jZyiaa	It is a fruit because it has seeds inside.|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ i think it's a fruit, because it contains seeds like a berry..<^><...|`|hiY7CCc7aa	A fruit think (cause it has a "pip")|`|rsN5RzsCaa	its a fruit|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	This is a question raised so many times but not everyone is sure what the answer is.

At 5%, beer is a pretty poor way to get alcohol.  Twelve ounces of whiskey can have ten times as much alcohol as a single beer.

The coffee, as you might expect in a coffee-growing country, is excellent. <br>  <br>  Some of the traditional dishes most often requested by Guatemalans are the Quetzaltenango tamales, kakik (spiced turkey soup), jocon (chicken in green tomato sauce), guacamole (avocado puree), subanik (beef, pork and chicken vapor-cooked in a highly spiced sauce), and traditional Antigua candy. <br>  |`|3gH7jFJGaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Guatemala" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_...</a>|`|CsieMFy0aa	<a href="http://www.foodbycountry.com/Germany-to-Japan/Guatemala.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodbycountry.com/Germany-to-...</a><br>  <br>  Help :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuHnvmKVjaEuOBrhde.wi5Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081112125545AACibJz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TqkDGL67aa	Yucca|`|AA10190225	Tacos guey|`|H9Vn2LHnaa	idk|`|yuIT4b5Zaa	Roasted dog with a side of camel ****.|`|ebMg0NVxaa	i've never had any. but i suppose i'd like to!

NRvriAgEaa	My family does Green Bean Supreme.  You take about a pound of Frozen Green Beans and blanch them, and combine that with 3/4 of a cup of sauteed onions, 2 cups of sour cream, the zest of two lemons.  Than you make a crust of Parmesan cheese, softened butter and bread crumbs, and bake it off for about 40 minutes at 350 or so.<br>  <br>  I like to kick up my Mashed Potatoes with Three Heads of Roasted Garlic, and A LOT of Parmesan Cheese.<br>  <br>  Last year, I did a Brussel Sprout hash by cooking down bacon until crispy in a pan, and than draining most of the fat off.  I added olive oil to the pan with the bacon fat, and cooked about a cup of shallots (I love shallots, you might want less) and once they were getting close to browned, I added in about a pound of Brussel Sprouts.  Once they were browned and starting to get soft, I added about a half cup of cider vinegar to the mix, and allowed that to steam up into the brussel sprouts.  It was really pretty with purple and green, and when you add the bacon back in it had all the right flavors.<br>  <br>  Instead of Sweet Potatoes this year i'm thinking of stealing a Sweet Potatoe Gnocchi, which is a Italian potato dumpling, with maple butter and sage sauce, but i'm trying to get the family to sign off on it.|`|bda036458423be8dda0630bca156ea5baa	For something different you can make corn pudding, brussel sprout casserole, (I make one that includes cream cheese and water chestnuts).  I've also made a vegetable casserole that you can use broccoli, cauliflower, onions, cream cheese and shredded cheddar cheese.  As far as potatoes, there's a potato casserole you make ahead, with mashed potatoes, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick real butter, 1 cup sour cream, chives to your liking.  Mix altogether while potatoes are hot.  Refrigerate, and on Thanksgiving you can bake them in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, but cut thin butter chunks and push them down into the potatoes before you stick them in the oven.|`|kteNQA9raa	I make a wonderful dressing that everyone cleans up. Walnuts or pecans, a cornbread stuffing, grapes, blueberries, cranberries. Frozen sweet corn. Make the dressing instead of with water use Jack Daniels or some wine if you are afraid the alochol won't cook out, it will. You can use a fruit juice. I have used Welch's white grape juice. Make the stuffing the day before you use it. Put it in an air tight container in the frigde and the flavors will blend wonderfully. Don't put the stuffing in the turkey until about an hour before it finishes. If you put the nuts in last, right before you put in the turkey, they will be crunchier not mushy.<br>  <br>  For sweet potatoes. Mix them with marshmallows, butter and pecans. Whip them with a mixer. People will go nuts for it. It will be a different same old thing without losing the tradition.<br>  <br>  |`|ubth4ru3aa	I don't have the recipes, but I have ideas. one of my teachers said that she had AMAZING turkey when it was cooked in a bag with apple juice. also, my family makes cranberry sauce (it's not hard) And my own recipe for chidren are sandwiches.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef from canada and if it is not local or fresh, much of the goat and lamb meat here in North America that is frozen is from Australia or New Zealand, and the local breeds are not the same as those in India, I have friends who are chef/owners of Indian restaurants here in Toronto Canada and they have said the same, local lamb in both Canada and the US is a slight pinkish colour, and is not aged, lamb is sold fresh, and if it is done under Halal butchering regulations it is that much more refined and cleaner, even kosher lamb is a better product, but local as opposed to frozen imported is 2-3 times more expensive, and the cubed products in markets is sawed to portion so bones are quite prevalent.|`|74UbLVd8aa	Its due to what they eat and how they are prepared.

AA10401458	I had an awesome Hyderabadi Biryani right here in Gurgaon         A friend referred this new home delivery chain called "Hydrabadi Biryani House" specialising in Hyderabadi cuisine to me recently and yesterday we ordered some Chicken & Mutton Biryanis from them for a get together.    I have shared the experience with several people since then and can't wait to tell whoever cares to listen about it. It is the most authentic biryani I have had outside of Hyderabad. The aroma filled the house and the aftertaste lasted a good half-an-hour.    Unlike most biryanis (or pulaos!!) available from various restaurants in town, this one is actually layered and comes with a special gravy that biryanis are supposed to be eaten with (and not green chutney like some restaurants serve!). Thank god we have an option to Dominos now for good quality food delivered at home. And still, the prices were good and portions generous! Let me know your experience with these guys.    You can call them on 5002500.|`|09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	Well, I think it's better to make biryani.  Even if you can't make a really good one with your own ingredients, buy a packet of biryani masala and simply follow instructions.  Most ask for a pressure cooker too, so make sure you have one.  Then, it's only a matter of buying the ingredients.  I'm sure in Gurgaon there is a grocery store to buy the masala and ingredients (e.g. basmati rice, etc.).  The reason I say this is because often restaurants and cooks cheat you because they make mediocre/bad food for a high price.  Also, guests will appreciate you if you can say that you made the biryani yourself.  It's not that hard anyway.  Okay, have a nice party!

AA11704793	I use Wolfgang Puck's dough recipe:  1 package Active dry or fresh yeast  1 teaspoon Honey  1 cup Warm water, 105 to 115 degrees  3 cups All-purpose flour  1 teaspoon Kosher salt  1 tablespoons Extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing   Toppings of your choice   In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water.    Preparation    In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.)    Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled).    Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.    Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.    To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough. Lightly brush the inner circle of the dough with oil and arrange the topping of your choice over the inner circle.    Using a lightly floured baker's peel or a rimless flat baking tray, slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the pizza crust is nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Transfer the pizza to a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or very sharp knife. Serve immediately.  Cook's Notes    Substitute to make wheat dough:  1 package yeast  1/4 cup warm water, plus1 cup cool water  1 tablespoon honey  3 3/4 cups whole wheat flour  1 tablespoon olive oil  Pinch salt|`|AA12122368	PIZZA UNOS DEEP PAN CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA  Source: The Pizza Book: Everything There Is To Know About the World's Greatest Pie by Evelyne Slomon  Servings: 6    FOR THE CRUST:  1 cup warm tap water (110-115 degrees f)  1 pkg active dry yeast  3 1/2 cups flour, divided use  1/2 cup coarse ground cornmeal   1 tsp salt   1/4 cup vegetable oil  FOR THE FILLING:  1 lb sausage, removed from the casing and crumbled  1 lb mozzarella cheese, sliced   2 garlic cloves, minced   1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes, drained and coarsely crushed  3 tsp dried oregano (or 5 fresh basil leaves, shredded  4 tbsp freshly grated parmesan     TO PREPARE THE CRUST:  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast with a fork. Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.     Flour your hands and the work surface and knead the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.     Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45 to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk.     Punch dough down and knead it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the bottom of the pan. Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.     Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.     TO PREPARE THE FILLING:  While the dough is rising, prepare the filling ingredients. Cook the crumbled sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat; set aside.     TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE:  When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the mozzarella cheese over the dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese. Top with the tomatoes. Sprinkle on the seasonings and parmesan cheese.     Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees.     Then lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The crust will be golden brown when done.

Love the crust 'cause there are herbs in it.  2 sauces: a quick and a slow :)  And of cause lots of tips for the toppings (see "garnish")  http://www.jannekes.eu/pizza/index.html    Enjoy it !|`|AA11966875	Here is a how to make optium pizza dough, I got from an Italian:    you need 1kg of flour, yeast, 500ml of water, 2 table spoon of olive oil (xtra vergin ofcouse) and 2 tea spoons of salt.    First pre heat your oven, or if you are using a wood oven start to chop down a tree and burn the wood!    Next throw some of the flour on the table, and some over your shoulder for fun.    Put the rest of the flour on the table with a hollow in the middle, like a vulcano (as pizza was invented in Napoli think Vesuvio.  Now add the yeast, water and other ingridents in the crater and start to mix with your hands until the dough becomes soft and smooth like a babies bottom! Now cover it with a damp cloth and leave for a few minutes.    Whist your oven is warming up you can make one of 2 choices.    1. If you like it 'high' or deep pan as the Americans call it, leave the dough wrapped in the damp cloth for 1.5 hours. Then roll it out into your tray and into the oven.    or    2. If you like it thin and crispy like a Roman pizza, roll it out straight away into the pan and staright into the oven.    As the home oven is not as hot as the wood oven, you need to cook it for at least 20mins in total. First you add only the tomato sauce, and cook it for 15mins, then remove it from the oven and add the mozzarella cheese and anything you find in your fridge and return it to the oven for the alst 5 mins of cooking.|`|AA11069735	sauce pepporoni im the pizza man my name is mike peperoni  call me for engredients at 1800-pepeeroni-man|`|b510e3185d86d536a9b4eb3061dd4e90aa	Homemade Pizza     Pizza from scratch in under an hour.

Take white bread or wheat and trim the crusts off to form a circle. Roll flat with a rolling pin, put on a greased cookie sheet, spread about a heaping tbsp of jarred spaghetti sauce, (Prego works good) on top with pizza seasoning sprinkled on top. Let kids add their own toppings and cheeses that they want and broil in oven until bubbly and hot. This also works with English muffins for a quick snack.

It's so non-toxic, it's actually an ingredient in a lot of foods, used similarly as glycerine.    It's not pure propylene glycol, but mixed with water...this makes it less expensive as well as increases the ability to cool.  Water transfers heat (or cool as the case may be) more effectively, so it cools your drink better than the glycol alone.|`|AA11279817	i think its styrafome in most coolers, which is what keep thinks both cold and warm.|`|e8b01c6903abfc77a3802eae2ea9fadfaa	Propylene Glycol.|`|4ffdffe57212024c72d1223ea6da729baa	it' oil.   a light, low viscosity oil. it is very hard to freeze.  in a airtight container it will maintain a steady temp longer.  it will frost over however.

YQTBQ5xyaa	Fruitarians also eat nuts and seeds,which are fruits, botanically speaking.  So that means they can eat tomatoes, squash, avocado, etc., which are botanically considered fruits (some fruitarians eat these, anyway).    This is from wikipedia:    "[edit] Fruitarian definition of fruit:  When discussing food, the term "fruit" usually refers to just those plant fruits that are sweet and fleshy (for example, plums, apples, and oranges). Botanically, though, some foods not typically considered fruitsincluding bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, nuts and grainsare fruits.[4]    Fruitarians use differing definitions of what is considered a "fruit."      [edit] Definition of fruitarian  Some fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant, that is: foods that can be harvested without killing the plant. These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds.[5] Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so,[6] and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds.[7] Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten.[8] Others eat seeds and some cooked foods.[9]    Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as many beans and peas,[10] while others include green leafy vegetables[11] and/or root vegetables in their diet."|`|JPssvCAvaa	It makes you hairy  Monkeys eat like that.|`|NKKiaC3Naa	You're thinking of refined sugar.

I like the Oriental style noodles.  Get whatever you like.    Soup   1:  cook a breast of chicken in about 1 quart of water with the spices from the noodles.  Add chopped leek including most of the inside of the green part (throw away the tough outer leaves).  After that prepare 2-3 carrots, chop diagonally, then slice 1/2 of a Chinese cabbage.  Slice to smallish pieces that can be eaten easily.      (You can cook the frozen chicken and then take it out and add the veges, then chop up the chicken breast or use leftover chicken.)    After cooking veges with cooked chicken for 10 minutes add the noodles (broken), cook 3-5 minutes til done.    Soup   2:  Do the same for the chicken but change the veges.  Cook in Ramen noodles spices.  Add yellow or white chopped onion and/ or some green onions chopped with the chicken while it's cooking,  After it's done, take out to chop chicken breast if it was a whole frozen piece, then,  Add chopped broccoli, carrots, and snow peas as desired, cook 12 minutes, add broken noodles, cook another 3-5 minutes.  Done!|`|QK84psFLaa	i know this will sound hokey, but make them in the microwave, with as little water as possible. when they come out, they should not be floating but still semi moist. then stir in seasoning packet well  it its good on a cracker|`|eAxQxkA2aa	I cook them on the stove according to the package.

First break up the Ramen in to little crunchy bits. Then in a bowl sprinkle on some soy sauce and mix it up. In a skillet cook up your favorite stir fry veggies and beef or Chicken. When your stir fry is almost cooked toss in the Ramen for the last 5 minutes of cooking. When it is done you will have a  great tasting crunchy addition to your favorite stir fry meal. it is yummy. I hope you try it my friend.

kAhYx3IFaa	La plupart des consommateurs d'eau en bouteille cuisinent pour des raisons de prix de revient et de transport,  l'eau du robinet. Rares sont ceux qui utilisent de l'eau minrale pour prparer th, caf, tisanes ou potages, rincer lgumes ou fruits et cuisiner riz, pates ou pommes de terre.    De nombreuses personnes pensent que faire bouillir l'eau du robinet lui enlve toute sa nocivit; ceci est partiellement faux car le fait de faire bouillir dtruit, certes, les microbes mais concentre les lments indsirables. La quantit de chlore reste quasiment identique, le calcaire se transforme en tartre sous l'effet de la chaleur, ce qui se traduit par le dp?t blanc dans les casseroles, tartre qui se dpose galement dans notre organisme.     Testeur de TDS        39 euros En dehors du chlore, du calcaire et des minraux et mtaux inassimilables, il y a aussi de plus en plus de produits chimiques en provenance des mdicaments et molcules industrielles. Selon le dossier "Environnement et eau potable: une mdication de masse  notre insu" de Sherrill Sellman paru dans Nexus n39, le problme est grave au point que ces produits polluants pharmaceutiques et de soins personnels ont un nom: les PPSP. 90% de tout mdicament absorb quitte l'organisme intact et redescend dans les rserves d'eau. Les molcules industrielles s'immiscent galement aux rserves d'eau. Il y a aujourd'hui 10500 ingrdients chimiques qui entrent dans la composition des produits dit de soins personnels (Hydratants, nettoyants, bains moussants, shampoings, dodorants, parfums, crans solaires etc...) et sont reconnus perturber notre systme endocrinien, neurologique, respiratoire et immunitaire. Ce pot-pourri nous revient chaque fois que nous ouvrons le robinet de la cuisine.      Par ailleurs, des exprimentations ont dmontr que l'absorption d'eau du robinet nuit  une bonne assimilation des aliments dans la mesure o les produits de traitement de l'eau ont pour but de tuer les microbes et bactries et sont destructeurs de la flore intestinale. Des vrifications ont t entreprises sur des animaux d'levage diviss en deux groupes, et nourris identiquement, mais buvant dans le premier groupe de l'eau pure et dans le deuxime de l'eau du robinet. Il a t constat que les selles des animaux buvant l'eau du robinet contenaient beaucoup de protines, de vitamines et de sels minraux qui n'avaient pas pu tre assimils. Les animaux buvant de l'eau pure avaient des selles trs diffrentes sans perte de ces lments vitaux.      Les recherches sur la bio-lectronique du professeur Vincent (mesure du pH, de l'oxydo-rduction et de la rsistivit) ont dmontr que les maladies de civilisation se dveloppent dans des terrains biologiques caractriss par un sang trop alcalin, trop oxyd et trop charg en toxines.      L'eau purifie par osmose inverse est la solution idale. Elle a des caractristiques bio-lectroniques parfaites pour la sant : elle a un pH de 6,7, donc lgrement acide, elle est anti-oxydante et sa trs grande puret lui confre une trs forte resistivit lgrement suprieure  40 000 Ohms, facteur permettant un parfait fonctionnement rnal pour l'limination.    Elle permet en plus de redcouvrir le go?t de l'eau vraiment pure, lgre et agrable  boire, qui prserve intgralement la saveur des aliments et des boissons telles que th, caf, tisanes, potages.  L'osmose inverse : c'est quoi ?              Technologie de pointe mise au point par la NASA pour alimenter en eau pure les astronautes,   l'osmose inverse est utilise depuis plusieurs annes dans le domaine du traitement de l'eau.               Le centre de traitement ultra-moderne de Mry-sur-Oise qui alimente 320 000 foyers du   nord-ouest de l'Ile-de-France, utilise ce procd.               Sur le plan domestique, les systmes individuels peuvent liminer jusqu' 99 % des lments   nocifs contenus dans l'eau (les nitrates, les pesticides, les mtaux lourds, le plomb, le mercure,   l'arsenic, les chlorures...).|`|1l5qe3a8aa	Perso, j'alterne eau du robinet et eau minrale des Alpes.|`|6AVo1Phfaa	eau du robinet controle plusieurs fois par jour, par les services sociaux tels que la ddass, etc......je la bois depuis des annes sans problmes ainsi j'vite de me coltiner les packs|`|BcADeLPyaa	Malheureusement, l'eau du robinet devient de moins en moins potable, et les nappes phratiques sont de plus en plus souvent pollues.

Concasser les amandes (pas les pignons) enfin pas tous ... j'ai mis les amandes avec ce qui venait de pignons, j'ai pas tri ;o) avec 1 c  s de sucre en poudre, 1 c  c de cannelle et 1 c  s de fleur d'oranger.  Au mixeur, mais pas fin, il faut qu'il y ait des morceaux ... je crois que j'avais 40 g d'amandes (une petite barquette) et un peu moins de pignons (1/2 barquette de mme taille)  Mettre de c?t dans un bol.           Farce au poulet :     * la marinade au poulet  * 3 oignons  * 200  300 ml d'eau  * sel, poivre si ncessaire     Dans une marmite faire mijoter 2 cuil a soupe d'huile.   Faire revenir les morceau de poulet. Les dorer sur toutes les faces pendant 15 minutes.      Ajouter 3 oignons hachs (pas trop finement), les faire blondir  feu doux. Ajouter 200 ml d'eau ou plus, faut pas que ce soit sec, on peut en ajouter en cours de cuisson.   Couvrir et laisser bouillir 1 heures  feu moyen (moins pour des blancs, enfin ?a n'a pas grande importance, pourvu que la prparation ne sche pas).   Si on a mis des morceaux de poulet, il faut les goutter et les mietter.     Tout ?a, je l'ai fait la veille, et j'ai mis ces ingrdients au frais.     Le lendemain :     Sortir les feuilles de briks du frigo ainsi que les ingrdients ... mettre chauffer le poulet, l'goutter tant bien que mal ... c'est  dire sortir les morceaux en laissant le plus possible de liquide dans la casserole.        Farce aux oeufs     * 4 oeufs  * la sauce de cuisson du poulet     Casser 4 oeufs dans le sauce qui reste (celle du poulet) et les brouiller, cuisson un peu baveuse de prfrence, que ?a reste liquide ...          Montage :     * une vingtaine de feuilles de brick  * beurre  * eau       Dans un moule rond assez grand allant au four, commencer  monter la pastilla.      Arroser le moule avec du beurre.   Mettre 4 feuilles de bricks ou phyllo dans le plat en les laissant amplement dpasser. (humecter les bords  l'eau pour qu'ils ne schent pas pendant le montage !)  Placer 1 feuille au milieu pour maintenir l'ensemble. Etaler les amandes pulvrises et les pignons, ajouter 1 ou 2 feuilles bien beurres, taler la moiti du poulet, poser une feuille bien beurre,  la moiti de la sauce aux oeufs, un feuille beurre, l'autre moiti du poulet, une feuille, le reste d'oeuf, additionner deux feuilles de bricks. rabattre les feuilles bricks du dpart par dessus, c'est pour ?a qu'il fallait les mouiller, sinon, le temps de faire tout ?a, elles sont cassantes ! Remettre 4 feuille de la mme manire que les 4 premires et les border tout autour de la pastilla, comme on fait un lit. Je sais, c'est plus facile  dire qu' faire, mais on peut y arriver ! ;-)))   Passer encore du beurre fondu ...   Asperger le dessus de la pastilla avec l'eau de fleur d'oranger  et enfourner.      Cuire  four moyen 180 pendant 15 minutes, sortir la pastilla du four, la retourner sur un plat allant au four (poser le plat de service sur la pastilla encore dans le moule puis renverser) et la remettre pour 15 autres minutes. Au moment o on retourne, ?a craque un peu ... les feuilles du dessus ont tendance  faire un peu de miettes, mais c'est pas grave, ?a tient bien quand-mme.  Cette opration permet de faire dorer le dessous et surtout c'est plus facile aprs pour le service, moins de miettes au dcoupage ! Le c?t qui tait dessous dans le moule devient le dessus de la pastilla au service.     Avant de servir, dcorer de sucre glace et cannelle. Servir chaud.      Je dois avouer que mettre du sucre glace dessus, ?a m'inquitait un peu, alors je l'ai pas fait, mais j'ai test dans mon assiette et c'est trs trs bon !!! Du coup, les enfants ont sucr aussi, et Fran?ois (mon cher et tendre) a fini par tester et a aim aussi.  La cannelle par contre, comme y'en a dj dedans, ?a apporte rien de plus ...     Voila, je t'ai livr tous mes secrets !    faut que j'en refasse, c'tait trop bon !

The ones from the broth has oil through the broth thus stops the sticking. The other trick is and picked up from the same family, when they steam in the bamboo steamers, they do not use water, that they steam the fish and vegetables, and in this case the dumplings is some of the broth in the bottom of the wok.

AA10531094	Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas). (If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When Charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows: Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds; Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds; Low: 5 to 6 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.)    Pat steaks dry and sprinkle all over with sea salt and pepper. Grill steaks on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until thermometer inserted horizontally 2 inches into meat (do not touch bone) registers about 120F for rare, 9 to 11 minutes.

rS66egIPaa	Well I was a vegetarian from when I was born up until the age of about 7. The reason for this is because my family and I moved to France at that time and we discovered that they didn't sell any meat substitutes in the supermarket and at my school they didn't serve vegetarian options. So it was just easier in the long run.  I don't really remember the transition but now I know that I would find it very hard to go back to not eating any fish.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	I went vegetarian to pescetarian then back to veggie. It wasn't difficult. At the time I wasn't eating healthily and wasn't getting enough protein because I was just living off junk food. Why do you want to eat fish? You can get the protein from plant sources and omega oils from flax seed.   Just eat fish. Start off with a small amount just in case it doesn't agree with you. Work your way up.|`|JPssvCAvaa	Fish contains oils which are good for you.

You can also give this sauce with any type of noodles ( much faster ).

Get two lbs of spaghetti (about $2.00), two large jars of pre-made sauce (4.00), a large zucchini (2.00), a red pepper (1.25), and some chopped carrots (1.00) .  Par boil the carrots, set aside.  In a pan with some olive oil saute the red pepper till just turning tender and stir in the zucchini and par boiled carrots.  Then drop in the pre made sauce and bring to a boil, then turn off.  You don't want to over cook the veggies.  Cook your pasta in salted water, serve family style.  The pasta piled up on a platter with the sauce on top.  Top this all with some Parmesan cheese (6.00).  For a side you can buy a loaf of french bread (2.00) slice and brush with olive oil and dust lightly with Parmesan cheese, toast lightly in the oven.  For desert you can buy a package of carrot cake mix (1.25) and make mini-muffins top them with cream cheese frosting (1.50).    meal for 8 for $21.00.

Probablemente la base de la mayora de las ideas acerca de vampiros que forman parte de la cultura popular actual sea el libro Drcula de Bram Stoker, y las pelculas de cine basadas en l, como Nosferatu y Drcula de Bram Stoker. Algunos estudiosos del vampirismo han sugerido que estas leyendas se hallan relacionadas total o parcialmente con casos de patologas reales como la rabia; interesante el estudio del neurlogo espa?ol Juan Gmez Alonso Los vampiros a la luz de la medicina; o la porfiria. Junto con el hombre lobo, el vampiro es quizs el ms famoso ser sobrenatural de la cultura popular humana.    La palabra "vampiro" viene de las lenguas eslavas (del alemn vampir, que se deriva del polaco temprano vaper y ste a su vez del eslavo arcaico oper; con races indoeuropeas paralelas en el turco y en el persa). Significa a la vez "ser volador", "beber o chupar" y "lobo", adems de hacer referencia a cierto tipo de murcilago. Durante la expansin del Romanticismo en Europa, la principal reaccin al periodo previo de Ilustracin enciclopdica y racionalista, el vampiro se convirti en una temtica comn y pas de la leyenda oral a los castillos y los salones elegantes.       Caractersticas de los vampiros [editar]    Aunque la descripcin de estas criaturas vara un poco entre autores, tienen varias caractersticas en comn:        * Fueron humanos mortales, pero ahora estn en un estado no exactamente vivo pero tampoco muerto, de ah que se les llame no-muertos.      * Suelen ser de aspecto delgado y lnguido, con largas u?as y piel mortecina.      * Segn algunos autores, los vampiros no se reflejan en los espejos, ya que no poseen alma.      * Necesitan sangre fresca para vivir.      * Suelen tener fobia a los crucifijos y al agua bendita si son creyentes.      * Pueden infectar a otros al morderlos, y convertirlos a su vez en vampiros. Los detalles varan.      * Algunos, como Drcula de Stoker, necesitan dormir en tierra de suelo natal.      * Poseen una fuerza sobrenatural.      * Pueden convertirse en criaturas como lobos, ratas o murcilagos cuando se siente en peligro.      * La mayora slo puede ser destruido por la luz del sol o al ser decapitado. Los verdaderos Nosferatu slo pueden morir si se introduce plata bendita en su cuerpo y no hay sangre cerca de ellos en ese momento; de lo contrario, simplemente su cuerpo se destruir slo para reconstruirse nuevamente.      * Si se le clava una estaca en el corazn, el vampiro no muere, sino que queda paralizado mientras tenga la estaca clavada. Segn otras fuentes, si muere, pero hay que dejar la estaca clavada. Y debe ser de madera de ciertos rboles, como el roble.      * Si se le decapita muere, en caso de que sea un vampiro de baja categora (mordido por un vampiro no original).      * Los verdaderos Nosferatus pueden soportar la luz del sol, aunque la odian. Los dems vampiros no soportan la luz del sol, que puede destruirlos o herirlos gravemente. Si les da la luz del sol a los vampiros de baja categora pueden morir pero si llegan a tiempo a la sombra, pueden curar sus quemaduras pues tiene gran capacidad de regeneracin.      * Se pueden alejar con ajo pues lo odian por su olor muy fuerte. Tampoco toleran el olor a rosas.      * Para que un vampiro no original, o de baja categora se vuelva un verdadero nosferatu debe de beber voluntariamente la sangre de aquel que lo mordi (que en este caso debe ser un nosferatu).    El vampiro es un ser fsicamente poderoso, tan fuerte como veinte hombres, de una virilidad extraordinaria y extremadamente "sexy". Proyecta sombra aunque se mueven a placer y no en la accin que hace. Debido a su consumo de sangre permanece eternamente joven, y es el se?or de los murcilagos, las polillas, el lobo, la rata, el zorro y el bho. Es capaz de transformarse en una nube de polvo o vapor, trepa por las paredes con la facilidad de un insecto y, al menos de un modo limitado, es capaz de controlar la furia de los elementos. En Drcula se afirma tambin que slo puede entrar en un edificio si se le invita previamente -un innegable simbolismo sexual- y que tiene que dormir en un atad que contenga algo de su tierra natal. Le repugna la flor del ajo (una minscula flor violeta que despide ese caracterstico olor, no su bulbo, que no despide ningn olor hasta que se corta) y la luz del da le molesta, pero no le da?a significativamente. La suposicin de que la luz del sol hiere o mata a los vampiros es un mito aparecido en los ltimos sesenta a?os.    Suele considerarse que las armas (balas, dagas, espadas, proyectiles) fabricadas en plata pura le pueden herir, pero no las ms comunes de plomo o acero. Existen, por el contrario, opiniones contradictorias sobre la utilidad del fuego para destruir a un vampiro, incluso cuando el fuego procede de armas modernas de alta energa. En cuanto al crucifijo y el agua bendita, es algo que Stoker se sinti obligado a incluir en su novela dado el carcter fanticamente religioso de la sociedad de su tiempo, pero no parece que tengan ms fuerza que la de su propio simbolismo. Esto significa que si el vampiro era cristiano cuando estaba vivo, puede sentirse espantado ante tales smbolos, pero si no lo era, no servirn de gran cosa. Con los vampiros ms viejos, que nacieron muchos milenios antes de la aparicin del cristianismo, la cruz y el agua bendita no seran ms que curiosidades histricas carentes de todo poder.          http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampiro|`|c1649823d7622a4ec0f4b38aec9513d6aa	-es un animal que se parece a un raton pero con alas  unos se alimentan de insectos  otros se alimentan de sangre|`|gvurfza2aa	bat man|`|ZpOcD0Heaa	Amigo los vampiros solo existen en los cuentos de terror... en realidad los vampiros los confunden con los murcielagos y no chupan sangre en realidad son fructiferos comen pura fruta les gusta mucho abundar en plantas de mango..!|`|AA11204273	como lo preguntas en esta categoria:  tequila ,mezclado con un liquido rojo echo a base de salsa de tomate,naranja ,una slasa ligeramente picante.  se pone en el vaso todo esto ,un poco de limon ,slasa maggui y hielo.rocooooo!!!! es mexicano|`|b7b9e872b24505d44fbd2e8b85647b95aa	Hola, supongo que te referirs a la bebida.

Durante la expansin del Romanticismo en Europa, la principal reaccin al periodo previo de Ilustracin enciclopdica y racionalista, el vampiro se convirti en una temtica comn y pas de la leyenda oral a los castillos y los salones elegantes.    Otros nombres son vurdalak (ruso moderno), vrolok (eslovaco), strigo? o strigoiul (rumano moderno), bukolako o vukodlak (serbio), upiro (polaco), nosferatu (del griego nosophoro (?), portador de enfermedad) y vampyrus (latn).|`|57OxTmpEaa	un vampiro, es una "persona" que en el dia es murcielago CREO y en la noche te chupa la sangreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee muajajajajaja xD jajajajajaja xD|`|4WrqmLlUaa	UN CHUPASANGREEEE QUE VIENE A COMERSE A LOS NI?OS QUE HACEN PREGUNTAS SOBRE ELLOS EN YAHOO RESPUESTAS!!!! ahhhhhhh|`|Bjk7xtWDaa	jajajaja todos los q te respondieron se referian a otra cosa jajajajajaaaaaa   tu ablas de bebidas y ellos de politicos jajaajajajaja  apoyo  un vanpiro es una chingaDera q chupa sangre y sale en varias eliculas de terrror|`|2c3b1afb74ba0a066f0d7e6b2f82cb6baa	es una bebida a base de tequila son sangrita y un poco de salsa tabasco.   deliciosa|`|Iw5iabdlaa	es un murcielago quer comne sangre y se le llama vampiro|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Es todo aquel animal que se alimenta de la sangre de otros.....

I wouldn't go off and do things without checking, if you want to be on the right saw of the boys in blue.

The dough does not spread or distort  they can be baked fairly close together and can be shipped or transported without breaking.       1 cup (2 sticks) butter (do NOT use oleo or spread)  ? cup sugar  1 egg  1 tsp vanilla  3 cups sifted all purpose flour  ? tsp baking powder    Cream butter and sugar together until fluffy.   Add egg and vanilla extract.  Add flour and baking powder.   Mix until mixture clings together.   Gather into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate one hour.     Roll out between ? and 1/2 inch thick. Bake 5 to 6 minutes at 375F. Do not let the cookies brown.    Cool on wire rack before glazing or frosting.    Glaze: With a fork, mash together 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon powdered sugar until a fine paste. Add a few drops of milk. Continue adding powdered sugar and milk until desired consistency is achieved. Add 2 drops of almond or vanilla extract.     Yield: about 1 cup.

The farmed salmon is often DYED, and has white fat veins that are more prominent than wild, healthier, salmon.    Wild  salmon,  is usually in colder water and they have to struggle UP stream to sporn, and therefore less fatty, better quality flesh.  They are not as colourful, not dyed, but healthier, they both have some mercury.   Farmed salmon, are sad, and live unnaturally, which MUST reflect in the chemistry; and is the dye good for you?.  They are cheaper in the fish markets than the WILD healthier salmon, it costs more to catch them too.

But do not eat undercooked seafood. The risk is too great.    One form of foodborne illness that some people don't realize is the use of sulfites on shrimp.

I always start off with raw shrimp for my curries, stir fries and such. Even when I make my seafood soup, which includes clams, cod, mussels, crab claws, baby octopus, shrimp etc, I make sure that the soup vegetables are well on the way before I add the seafood. The seafood basically takes no time at all to cook through. The only thing extra I do, is when I am at my fish market and they are cleaning fish, I ask for the fish scales and add those to the soup in the beginning to draw that seafood flavor out, or make a fish stock separately.

You do not need to worry about undercooking any kind of fish that comes from water. The Japanese eat Sushi (sushi is fish wrapped in seaweed, rice, and other items... the fish is not cooked what so ever).    Actually, not cooking shrimp or any kind of fish is better because then you don't get rid of all the natural oils, and health benefits. So if you do like to cook shrimp , go ahead! Just remember, if it's undercooked, it's OKAY!    EDIT - Raw shrimp in my opinion, tastes better than cooked shrimp. If you by shrimp sauce (not sure what it's called) and you dip cold shrimp (just thawed, keep it warm) into the dip, it's DELICIOUS! I've been eating that every year almost since I can remember! It's actually proven to be VERY healthy.   Mmmmmm shrimp... delicious! I love it!    EDIT - The only kind of meat that you can get sick from is white meat (chicken meat) and red meat (steaks, hamburgers). All fish are fine to eat raw. Raw is better when it's fish :)|`|w1kvhxX5aa	shut up answers i answer this one hey give me the under cooked stuff i bet you i live get better answers no it will not hurt you  hahahahahahahahahahaha playa listen to your answers|`|158bc02dd280e2d9ca319323a1e85a27aa	it can be dangerous to eat undercooked shrimp|`|N2O9rJvUaa	nope theres not any danger to eat it undercook as theyre precooked almost all times  i mean if u bought them   if u fish it u shoul cook them well|`|shynI8J0aa	If it is cold, shrimp is fine to eat shrimp raw.

Cooked Taro Root could also be a substitute, but it's very starchy and pretty bland.    In baking, you  could easily substitute mashed papaya or mango but make sure you drain them, as they are very juicy. I have also used applesauce + shredded zucchini, but again, drain them of any excess liquid.    For a smoothy... i would suggest one of papaya, mango, plantain, cantaloupe or even sliced and peeled apple.

tHt0MPHZaa	If you make the transition correctly, there shouldn't be any negative side effects. When I went veggie, I made the transition in about 3-4 days and I had some stomach churning and very mild pains, but that was about it (it only lasted for about a day or so) . You will notice the difference in your hair and skin immediately. Skin is so much smoother, less oily and if you have acne, it will go away and you won't get pimples as often. After about a month of the veggie diet, you skin will adopt a healthy glow! Your hair will feel softer, become more manageable and grow faster. You will notice that you start to smell better and you body will shed some extra fat so you will be leaner! You will also notice you have more energy. There are endless benefits to the vegetarian diet.     It is not hard to get the correct nutrition, just make sure you are getting enough protein from good food sources such as beans, soy ( i recommend fake meat products by Morningstar and Boca!), mushrooms, lentils and other legumes. Go here: http://www.goveg.com/    they have GREAT recipes!  Also, if you are afraid of becoming anemic, take a daily multivitamin with iron and you should be fine.  I wish you best of luck :))|`|7345f8ce5183904e81d1cc2f0591c488aa	you absolutely NEED to buy the book entitled "you are what you eat" by Gillian Mckeith!!!! It is an amazing book that helped me get my poor vegetarian eating habits healthy again.  It is a colorful book with easy tips and explanations about what to eat and why, even if you don't stick with the vegetarian plan this book is for you!    If you are a "bad vegetarian" you will have negative effects, but if you do it right only good things lie ahead.  Before vegetarianism i had stupid amounts of  skin problems (from zits to random discoloration eew!!!!), now i have skin so nice that i actually receive compliments (plus no more backne)! I have loads more energy than i did before, and have actually gotten to the point where i don't want to eat processed food.    Read "You are What You Eat", it will totally guide you through the "no protein" perception of vegetarianism (p.s. certain types of seaweed have more protein in it than meat, but Gillian will fill you in on that stuff).  READ IT!|`|7ad7b6a92f7e7ce5b8737b84ca7924ecaa	Perhaps before you start being a vegetarian you should look at why you don't seem to have much energy. I'm not trying to put you off being a vegetarian, I'm one myself and I think it's a great way to live! But if you're already lacking energy it indicates that something is missing from your diet.    When you stopped eating junk foods did you replace them with healthy foods? You might be lacking energy simply because you aren't eating enough.     A vegetarian diet can give you everything you need and be very healthy, but you need to be aware of what you are eating and make sure it's a healthy diet. You can't just cut out all junk food and meat without replacing it with more veggies, fruit, legume and other healthy foods. If you can do it right it's defiantly worth it! Just remember being a vegetarian doesn't mean cutting things out and eating less overall, it means replacing meat products with other more healthy ones! Good luck!|`|j6vsBzuSaa	Do NOT LISTEN TO THE FIRST PERSON ON THIS LIST!!!! im a vegan about 2 months now, im 13, and its great, i sorta feel bad admitting this, but i ate meat today and it was disgusting. u lose your taste for it. my parents dispprove so they forced me to eat it, and i hated it. go vegan, its better, milk has pus and scabs in it form the cows, they get infected cuts from the milking machines and it all falls in, trust me, there r no side affects, i didnt feel wierd when i went veggie, so go ahead, its much better, trust me! take it from someone about youre age! meat is grooossss.no side affects at all, and assuming u dont smoke or drink alot, you will live on average,6 to 10 years longer than meat eaters|`|AA10938466	You need to eat red meat to get iron in your blood.|`|TVouwqeVaa	you don't get to eat meat wich is a good source of protein and such.

She was very pale, and caught alot of colds during the time she was doing that.  Maybe it weakens your immune system?  I know that the proteins found within meat are basically what builds cells, so if you cut them out of your diet at this age, you probably won't grow anymore.

Once the bread is trimmed, spread the slices with the filling, covering it completely.   4.   Roll the bread up from the short side, pressing down just enough to make it stick to itself.   5.   Wrap a slice of bacon and wrap it around the roll, overlapping the bacon to cover the bread completely. If you need more than one bacon slice, tuck the end of the second bacon slice under the end of the first. Trim the bacon when you get to the top of the roll.   6.   Freeze the wrapped rolls for 30 minutes to firm them up.   7.   To bake, preheat the oven to 350F Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.   8.   Slice the rolls in thirds and place on the baking sheet, cut side down. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes (5 minutes longer if baking from frozen), until the bacon is crisp and the tops are golden brown.   9.
