cbLsxrr7aa	It's incorrect; you shouldn't use a comma to connect two independent clauses. You can change the comma to either a period or a semicolon.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	First, you need to get a 4-year college degree (bachelors).  Major in anything (medicine, surgery, and premed are not majors) and take the premed classes in bio, chem, physics, math, and English.  Keep your GPA above 3.5 and do well on the MCATs to get into med school.  Med school is another 4 years, where you first start to specialize in surgery.  Then you've got a general surgical residency which lasts 5 years, then more fellowship/residency training if you want to specialize in something.  Try <a href="http://www.salary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.salary.com</a> to find out how much surgical residents in your area make.  You won't have trouble finding a job, but malpractice insurance is expensive - you can make a lot more working in a private practice, but then you have to pay all your own insurance.

oTxufwbEaa	It was caused by Queen Victoria.  If it hadn't been for her, it would have been the "Susie Era," or the "Janet Era."  It was a time of relative prosperity and very restrictive social values.  Middle and upper class women did everything they could afford to emulate the Queen, including copying her clothing, hair, makeup and strict moral code.  Men were afraid women were getting a little too restless, asking for rights and education and the sort, so they made all kinds of laws to regulate female behavior and keep them in their place.

qnDYiquFaa	i am not sure about it but i have found something that might help you <br>  are you writing your essay?or??<br>  <br>  <br>  Consumer law<br>  Consumer protection law or consumer law is considered an area of public law that regulates private law relationships between individual consumers and the businesses that sell those goods and services. Consumer protection covers a wide range of topics, including but not necessarily limited to product liability, privacy rights, unfair business practices, fraud, misrepresentation, and other consumer/business interactions.<br>  <br>  Such laws deal with credit repair, debt repair, product safety, service contracts, bill collector regulation, pricing, utility turnoffs, consolidation, personal loans that may lead to bankruptcy and much more.<br>  <br>  here is more <br>  Consumer Protection Laws and Your Business<br>  Be aware of laws against deceptive advertising and pricing -- and when they apply.  <br>  <br>  If you are a business owner, make sure you know about and follow the state consumer protection laws that apply to your business. These laws protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices. They go beyond the traditional legal remedies available for breach of warranty to really help consumers. Laws like these are on the books in nearly every state, although the details vary.<br>  <br>  Hundreds of cases have been brought under consumer protection laws, including these:<br>  <br>  A man sued a department store that ran out of an advertised waffle iron and didn't give him a rain check -- a violation of the consumer protection law in his state. <br>  A homeowner sued a roofing contractor that falsely advertised that it could arrange financing for roof repair jobs. <br>  A woman sued a health spa that reneged on its promise to return her deposit and cancel her contract if she changed her mind within three days. (Health spas have been singled out for special regulation; if you're going to start one, get the Federal Trade Commission pamphlet on this subject at www.ftc.gov.) <br>  To avoid these types of lawsuits you need to know the details of your state's consumer protection laws and tell your employees about practices that could get you in trouble. These state laws often allow a customer to sue even if the violation was not intentional.<br>  <br>  Most consumer protection laws contain a broad prohibition on "unfair or deceptive practices." In addition, many statutes list specific practices that are forbidden, such as deceptive advertising and pricing, discussed below.<br>  <br>  Deceptive Advertising<br>  Under both federal and state law, an ad is unlawful if it tends to mislead or deceive, even if it doesn't actually fool anyone. If your ad is deceptive, you'll face legal problems whether you intended to mislead the customer or not. What counts is the overall impression created by the ad -- not the technical truthfulness of the individual parts.<br>  <br>  FTC Enforcement of Deceptive Advertising Laws<br>  Over the years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against many businesses accused of engaging in false and deceptive advertising. If FTC investigators are convinced that an ad violates the law, they can do all of the following:<br>  <br>  convince the violator to voluntarily comply with the law <br>  issue a cease-and-desist order and bring a civil lawsuit on behalf of people who have been harmed <br>  seek a court order (injunction) to stop a questionable ad while an investigation is in progress, and <br>  require an advertiser to run corrective ads, admitting that an earlier ad was deceptive. <br>  Consumers' Right to Sue for False and Deceptive Advertising<br>  Consumers often have the right to sue advertisers under state consumer protection laws. For example, someone who buys a product relying on a deceptive ad might sue in small claims court for a refund or join others (sometimes tens of thousands of others) to sue for a huge sum in another court.<br>  <br>  Deceptive Pricing<br>  The two pricing practices most likely to get your business into trouble are: making incorrect price comparisons with other merchants or with your own "regular" prices, or offering something that is supposedly "free" but in fact has a cost

2kYNhrWSaa	The Maple produces yellow flowers in the spring after the leaves grow back. In good years, these little yellow flowers completely cover the tree, and the pollen they produce makes the entire tree appear to be enveloped in a yellowish haze. Many are allergic to this pollen, though allergies are rarely fatal. In midsummer the yellow flowers fall away, leaving the base of the flower to become the base of the fruit in which the seeds are kept. The rest of the fruit appears like wings and, in autumn, fall from the tree, spinning as they do. Many people find interest and beauty in the charming way these fruit seem to elegantly descend to the ground

Anything below a 2.0 GPA will get you kicked out of college, and college classes are a lot harder than high school, with much higher expectations.  If that's the best you can do in high school, a 4-year college would be a waste of your time and money, even if you could find one that would consider you with less than a 2.5 GPA (not likely - any school that would take you with less than a 2.5 isn't worth attending).  If you really want to go to college - and really think about why you do - it's community college for you.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	Depends on your test scores and overall average.  If you got mostly As and Bs and then had 2 Ds, it wouldn't impact you much.|`|Lfh0DWppaa	If you've only got a few of them (and I mean very few), then you can do it. But you'll need to balance them out with higher grades elsewhere. <br>  <br>  Schools don't accept students with low grades b/c they don't think you're taking education seriously. If you blow off high school, there's nothing to show them you won't do the same in college (even though you might take it more seriously).<br>  <br>  However, keep in mind a college banks a lot on you by accepting low grades. Students with lower grades affect a college's reporting (for instance, it shows they might have lessor standards and that makes them look like a not-so-great school). This is partly why, too, they want higher grades.<br>  <br>  You could also go to a community college for a while and work very, very hard--if you can get better grades that (good ones, if possible), then you should be able to transfer to a higher college later. But you'll need something to show the admissions people at the higher school that you do care about education and will give it your best. Until you improve your grades in HS or at a CC, you may find it hard to get into a 4-year school.<br>  <br>  So study now and start turning those grades up. And if you're already graduating, enroll at a comm college and get good grades, then apply to the 4-year then.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	The word "liberal" means open-minded, not left-wing, so the liberal arts imply studies that are open to new ideas.  For a fuller definition, this comes from the Columbia Encyclopedia:<br>  <br>  liberal arts, term originally used to designate the arts or studies suited to freemen. It was applied in the Middle Ages to seven branches of learning, the trivium of grammar, logic, and rhetoric, and the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The study of the trivium led to the Bachelor of Arts degree, and the quadrivium to the Master of Arts. During the Renaissance, the term was interpreted more broadly to mean all of those studies that impart a general, as opposed to a vocational or specialized, education. This corresponds rather closely to the interpretation used in most undergraduate colleges today, although the curriculum of the latter is more flexible than that of the Renaissance university.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Liberal arts refers to the humanities - English, anthropology, languages, etc.  Liberal art colleges offer these degrees along with the main science fields and a few others.|`|9Ijv5Mppaa	No, a liberal arts college or high school will focus on the humanities. <br>  <br>  It's funny, because I was talking to this guy who was calling NYU a liberal arts college just because students are generally left-leaning.

Therefore, 3x5=6x -> 15=6x -> 15/6=x -> 2.5=x|`|b6QazRVwaa	3/6=x/5<br>  6x=15<br>  x=6/15=2/5=.4|`|S1Xq18WKaa	We can solve for this ratio problem by applying the cross-multiplication technique. In other words, we can multiply the numerator on the left side with the denominator of the right side; and vice-versa. <br>  <br>  (3)(5) = (6)(x)<br>  <br>  We multiply the scalar values on both sides of our newly derived equation to get. . .<br>  <br>  15 = 6x<br>  <br>  We now can solve for the variable "x" by isolating it. We accomplish this by dividing both terms by the value six. Thus canceling the sixes on the right side of the equation.<br>  <br>  15/6 = 6x/6<br>  <br>  15/6 = x<br>  <br>  Therefore, our answer in exact form is 15/6 or 2.5 in decimal form.|`|38ccd2e4feadc84ad07166662a2e5338aa	Cross multiply so you get 6x=15.

z2BnPqO1aa	Federalism is a form of government that is centrally controlled, yet, there is still power provided to individual provinces.  And in this case, US States. Power is distributed by the constitution, because the federal government is only allowed to govern what has been specifically outlined in the constitution and amendments, while the states retain all other rights.  Also called enumerated rights.<br>  <br>  The best example of this is Marriage Laws, Gun Laws, Drinking Ages, voting laws.

cL0aHkYEaa	"Typo" is the abbreviated form of "typographical error."  It is that sort of commonplace error that occurs as the result of a misstroke in typing.<br>  Typos are NOT spelling or grammatical errors that are due to lack of knowledge or understanding.  <br>  <br>  Wikipedia has a nice explanation of typographical errors as well, with a reference to the origin of the term, and their prevalence in chat rooms and on message boards.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typo</a>|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Well, a typo is usually when you hit the wrong key - and type 'neat' instead of 'near' for instance.<br>  <br>  But I guess an omission could be a typo too. It is an error.<br>  <br>  .|`|AA10463356	An omitted question mark could be a typo if the omission is the result of poor typing rather than ignorance of the rules of punctuation.  If the person normally uses question marks correctly the mistake is probably a typing error.   A typo is any mistake that you make because your fingers hit the wrong keys or no key when a key is needed.  Typos are usually not grammatical errors because most grammatical errors are too complicated to be made just by hitting a wrong key.  Exceptions would be something like typing "He say." instead of "He says."  Unless you know the person doing the typing you wouldn't know without more context whether that is a typing error or a grammar error.|`|smV6u3aeaa	I have to say that if a person didn't put a question mark at the end of a sentence, but there IS a period, it's not a typo. I sometimes don't fully hit the shift bar and end up with something like, "Are you crazy/". But, if a person hit the period key, it has to be very deliberate. <br>  <br>  I agree with the previous answerer who said that typos aren't usually grammar mistakes. Another typo that looks like bad grammar that I see (and sometimes DO) is, "I have you book," where I don't type the 'r' at the end or 'your'. It's not because I think "you book" is correct, that's for sure! <br>  <br>  I think in most cases it's fairly clear when a mistake is a typo if the person demonstrates adequate grammatical skills in the rest of their writing. Most bad grammar is due to lack of knowledge or laziness.|`|xNcBLxMbaa	Whether you call an omitted question mark a typographical error or a grammatical error, it is an error nevertheless. Errors draw attention to themselves and suck the life out of the sentence, as if to say the underlying statement is no longer the center of attention. If you have something worthwhile to say, try to eliminate distractions that undermine your credibility. Remember, in most cases the person reading what you wrote never met you, doesn't know you, and can only draw conclusions based on the strength of your writing. So grammar, vocabulary, and logical arguments matter greatly. Don't be lazy. Put the question mark where it belongs, and leave off question marks where they don't belong (such as your headline).|`|FU4TyghIaa	Depends how you feel about the person who did it.<br>  If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, you would prodably say typo.<br>  At the end of the scale, they didn't understand that a question ends in a question mark or they didn't understand it was a question when they typed it out.

3821763c4b7e0b53c9e3c5fcbac4f9b1aa	Won't it read better this way: "It integrates or refers to the most of the initiatives. It may be the generally accepted and a broad framework for preparing and communicating information about organisational sustainability performance"?|`|OTvSnO7naa	Yes, but the word is unnecessary.  The sentence will read much better without it.|`|AA12095483	Probably, but this is an incomplete sentence.

DQlZIzAFaa	Living on your own teaches a LOT about yourself. You gain a lot of experience and maturity that you can't get any other way. Also, part of college is "growing up" and stuff - get as far away from anything that is your "comfort zone" and you'll learn a lot more about yourself. Living on your own is a great experience.<br>  <br>  Also, if your boyfriend REALLY loves you and is serious (like, fiance serious) he will be willing to put up with a year or two of long distance if it means he gets to spend the REST OF HIS LIFE with you in the future. If you're afraid you'll lose him over something like this, what else could you "lose him" over? I don't wanna sound preachy, but if you're 17 or 18 you don't know what "real life" is like - something living on your own, cooking, cleaning, and paying bills will teach you. You learn a lot about your values and your priorities when you have to make tough choices. If you and your bf can't get through a few tough choices now, what makes you think you can raise a family and live together in ten years?<br>  <br>  Concord, CA kinda sucks, I used to live there.|`|AA12095483	I think you need to get your priorities straight. Why are you going to school in the first place? I don't see anything about career aspirations, or reasons for going. And frankly, a college education is worth a whole lot more than fussing around about a boyfriend. If he's serious, he'll find a way to make it work and to still see you. If not, then that's all part of growing up. But at 18, you aren't ready for a life long commitment. <br>  You could always apply for student residence - a year of dorm living at the college would help you decide if you are ready to go out on your own or not - it's a great half-way step between living at home and being on your own. <br>  But frankly, you have some serious thinking to do before you make any moves. Talk this over with your parents and get their input as well.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	What do I think? I think you'll have to make up your own mind.<br>  .

krHIiK85aa	I'm curious about the foam balls.   Perhaps they're looking for you to use biodegradeable materials?  It's a mystery.<br>  <br>  Here's something to consider.  Exploratorium has a really cool calculator for showing a solar system to scale.  The author also describes different methods he's used to try to show this scale. <br>  <br>  You put in the diameter of the sun you will make in inches or millimeters.  When you click "calculate" the relative diameters of the planets, as well as their scaled orbit radius from the sun is shown.  What you notice is that if the sun is 1 inch large, the planets are mere dots or pin pricks.  If you use something the diameter of 3 inches, the planets are fractions of an inches large (the biggest, Jupiter, would be 3/10 of an inch).  As for the orbits... forget about it.  To draw it to scale, Neptune would be more than 800 feet from the sun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_system/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_...</a><br>  <br>  So here's a few ideas.  Use a tennis ball for the sun and various size tiny beads you'd get in a craft store for the planets. Or a marble for the sun and bird seed for the planets (considered food?).  You'll get closer to the true scale of the solar system so long as you pick a moderate size item for the sun and very small items for the planets.<br>  <br>  The author talks about how you can create one to scale using a roll of toilet paper -- also interesting.<br>  <br>  All of these choices, though, depend on what the teacher wants the model to show.  If the model is supposed to display different qualities of the planets, it will be hard to do anywhere near to scale.|`|MCBQMKsOaa	in my opinion foam balls are the best but since she cant use them you can do what i did which was buy molding clay the good one and cover the foam balls it gets so hard when it drys they would think its just the clay. made the solor system actually look like it was orbiting. the sun was in the middle and with wire i had it orbiting to where you can move them. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://staff.harrisonburg.k12.va.us/~sgilchristthompson/sseb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://staff.harrisonburg.k12.va.us/~sgi...</a><br>  <br>  picture that in 3-D where you can move the balls so it can really be orbiting the sun. <br>  <br>  Materials- Molding Clay (grey is the best)<br>                 Foam Balls (Different sizes)<br>                 Roll Of wire<br>                 Rocks (astroid belt) between mars and jupiter i think<br>                 Paint<br>  <br>  i think it came out nice when i did it they actually still have it and this was an 8th grade project.<br>  <br>  hope i helped

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Dartmouth got 550 transfer applications last year and accepted 38 (23 enrolled).  Northwestern got 1151 transfer applications and accepted 253 (128 enrolled).  <br>  <br>  It is true that most schools don't pay much attention to your SAT scores any more by the time you are a junior.  Your college academic record is far more important.  The exception may be if you are coming from a school which has a lesser reputation (which will reduce your chances of getting accepted anyway).  You may have perfect grades, but they want to know if you could handle the level of work at their school, and your grades alone may not tell them that, so they may look at your SAT scores as an indicator of your academic aptitude.|`|6740cce5db21709e63b8aa09900b506baa	It is true<br>  but certain Ivies frown upon transfer students.<br>  It's harder to get into an Ivy as a transfer than as a freshman.<br>  Northwestern would definitely be loads easier, and as long as you are qualified they will accept you with a 30 to 40% chance.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	I can't speak for NU dear, but Dartmouth and most top colleges care very much about SAT scores for junior transfers. Unless you went to a peer school such as another ivy or top LAC, in which case you have a high score anyway, they don't see your 4.0 from a non peer school as meaning you can do well there.<br>  <br>  With their generous financial aid, it's getting harder every year.

Ma, più in generale, questo “detto” rivela qualcosa di molto profondo, che potremmo riassumere così. La vita umana, che ognuno di noi vive, a guardarla bene è un intrigo inestricabile dal quale non si esce facilmente; siamo ambigui, incerti, spesso incapaci di capire dove andiamo, cosa vogliamo e, su tutto, aleggia sempre la consapevolezza del limite che la morte, inesorabile, esprime perfettamente. La vita insomma, nonostante il desiderio insopprimibile di felicità, è contraddizione che spesso sfocia nella tragedia: chi non l’ha avvertito almeno qualche volta?<br>  In un simile contesto, la “filosofia”, attraverso la ragione, avrebbe dunque il compito di non far disperare l’uomo, dando ordine al disordine, soggiogando il caos, nel quale è immerso, con la luce radiosa dei concetti, che tutto spiegano; la filosofia, insomma|`|4011bf06af6d4421eca5ebbac5f0fdf2aa	comprati un libreo di filosofia e tienitelo sempre d'appresso e il primo che ti dice questa frase rispondigli che stai iniziando..|`|a6c7264a63423a7ff37cad5498bdca4aaa	"Fregatene e continua per la tua strada". ;))<br>  <br>  Cià...|`|30ecc3b60d382b9269e389f98f7c40f2aa	significa ke di fronte alle situazioni + difficili o a quelle 1 pò sfigate bisogna imparare a prender la vita così cm viene invece di farsi sempre troppi problemi e troppe domande!!|`|21804472ce1df1001e925edb96ef8e66aa	non ti fare s e g h e  mentali

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I teach and I'm on facebook (so are my aunt and uncle, by the way).  It isn't just for students any more.  I originally got onto it because I was friended by some of my former students; now my friends are a mish-mosh of friends, family, colleagues, former classmates, and yes, students, or at least former students (I don't think I've ever had a current student as a friend on Facebook).  I personally made the decision never to ask to friend a student or even a former student, because I don't want to make them uncomfortable.  I only accept when they send me invitations.<br>  <br>  Because of that, I'm pretty careful about what I post.  I only have a professional picture up there (although I've seen pictures of colleagues in bathing suits, which I find a little weird).  I try not to say anything I would regret if anyone heard it (my aunt sent my 25 Random Things to my mother, because she found it interesting - I'm more worried about my 84-year old mother's reaction than I am about my students'!).  Today's comment was about buying gardening supplies and wishing the snow would melt.  I may bore my students to death, but I won't shock them!<br>  <br>  Remember also that there are settings on Facebook.  You can specify how widely you want certain categories of things to spread.  Personally, I'm terrified of making a mistake or forgetting to block someone, so I just don't deal with anything controversial.  And on the few occasions that I've seen one of my students say something a little "out there", I've chosen to ignore it.  Obviously, if a student were to write about doing something seriously dangerous, I would act, but most of what I've seen has just been silliness, and we all have a right to get a little silly once in a while.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Wow, teachers are real people with friends?

Here's why...<br>  <br>  In the beginning we see a young Wiesel who devoted his time studying the Talmud and dreaming one day of studying the Cabala. He started off as a boy who had faith and innocence.<br>  <br>  Then the Gestapo come and occupy his town. No one believes that the Gestapo can do anything so they just continue to live like normal. The Gestapo calls for deportation. Wiesel and his family are deported and are taken to Auschwitz-Bierkenau.<br>  <br>  At Auschwitz, Wiesel and the other prisoners worked long hours with very little food.and battled the cold. Every week people would collapse from exhaustion. If they lost the strenght to survive, they would be sent to the gas chambers or their body would be thrown into a lorry like a sack of garbage. It seemed as though it was useless to try to survive, to live another day.<br>  <br>  Wiesel who once had faith in God, changed his way of believing Him. He questioned his existence and asked Him how could he let this happen. He even went far as to asking himself "why should he bless His name?" His innocence is lost as he now has fight for survival without faith.|`|GqsZigbXaa	Question one.

nk3QCoPvaa	First of all, I like your focus. Good for you. Second of all, if you want that house with that much clarity, it is already yours. Congratulations. The universe will just need a bit of time to line up the slower congealed energy of the world with the quick whispy energy of your thoughts.<br>  <br>  Now, as to the house or any other material possessions. My advice is to pour all of your creative energy and fun into being the best architect you can possibly be. When you get up on that plane and find yourself on a life of high-creativity, producing the things that make you say WOW in greater and more powerful ways, then things like cars and houses and bank accounts will automatically fall into place. You will hardly notice though, because you will be having just too much fun chasing down the next WOW.<br>  <br>  Presumably a really good architect will make at least $100,000 a year. That means you can afford to spend about $30,000 per year on a mortgage. That breaks out to about $2500 a month. And you might be able to afford a $600,000 house on that if you put a big down payment. Start putting together $100,000 now. One dollar at a time. Good luck!|`|e415dafdcd312c16ad931bebee78c2ddaa	First, by the time you are out of school, the home will not be the same price.  If you are an architectural drafter, your income will not be as high as an actual registered architect.  I was an engineering drafter and the income of a drafter is not as high as an actual engineer who does the design.  The educational requirements are less for both Architectural Drafter and Engineering Drafter.  You will need at least a 4 year college degree.  Depending on the type of job you will get, more than likely you will be able to afford a $600,000 home,  By the time you finish school, things will change.  You might even want to move live elsewhere, other than LA where the prices are higher. Good luck.  You sound like an ambitious person

pVMUSUEBaa	The letter e with an accent grave (left to right, high to low) is a flat "e" pronounced as in the english word, "let." Zheng is pronounced close to, but not exactly "Jang." The initial "J" is a soft, not a hard "j" and does not have the "d" sound that many English words have when they start with "j." Instead, it has a "z" sound as in the word "Jacques." The closest sound is how you pronounce the "s" in the word "casual." That is a soft "j," and is how the word "Zheng" starts. The rest of it is pronounced to rhyme with the word "slang." Hope this helps.
rHqe7oMoaa	Pitbulls have been selectively bred for aggression BECAUSE they use them in dog fights. <br>  <br>  Gambling is the real problem - Dog fighting is just a way for people to gamble - it can be any type of animal fights (chickens, horses, pigs etc..)<br>  <br>  It is unfair to the dogs to consign them to this type of life - they are not wild dogs. We have tamed them and they rely on us for everything - to make them fight each other is barbaric.<br>  <br>  Dogs used in dogfighting generally don't get adequete medical care because it would be obvious to any trained vetrinarian that these dogs are involved in fighting; which they would then be obligated to report. Heck, when a dog gets injured in a dog fight, they usually just staple (yes STAPLE) the skin back together. They don't get painkillers.<br>  <br>  Many cosmetic alterations to dogs have been first used in dogfighting - ie. tail docking & ear docking.<br>  <br>  Dogfighting is selfish - it has no benefits for the dogs (who just want to please their owners) - it is all done for money.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other dogs/animals suffer in dogfighting - they are called "bait dogs" - smaller dogs that have their teeth removed so they can't hurt the fight dog. Their purpose is to be used as a "training target" for the fighting dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs that have been involved in dog fighting are next to impossible to rehabilitate and place in a loving home because of their previous training.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	once these animals are trained to be fighters its next to impossible to take the fight out of them, also its illegal
cL0aHkYEaa	The problem with the word "divided" in this sentence is the preposition that follows it.  If you want to use "divided," then it should be "divided among" not "divided to."  The same would be true if you were to use the word "distributed" -- which is more recognized as having to do with profits and assets, etc.|`|Jr6emga0aa	It is correct here and means that the profits proportionately belong to the Shareholders according to the number of shares they own. It doesn't mean that the profits necessarily have to be paid to them at any time but, when they are paid, the distribution is proportional to the number of shares.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	I believe so, although distributed would be sufficient as well. it would also be better word choice.|`|AA10030398	Yes, though I'd use distributed since it's more specific and flows into the sentence better.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	No, it should be distributed|`|acdc709fa5e2d178190fdde18844e0a4aa	Yes
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	"Intermingling" is used correctly.  "Absence" is not.  I would word this (assuming I understand your meaning correctly) as:<br>  <br>  "As a consequence, the legal characteristic of limited liability of the company is invalid."<br>  <br>  or, "As a consequence, the legal characteristic of limited liability of the company is void."<br>  <br>  or, "As a consequence, the legal characteristic of limited liability of the company does not apply to these circumstances."|`|cL0aHkYEaa	"Intermingling" seems to be all right, but "absence" is not.

Here is a description of the concept of "Piercing the Corporate Veil" that might give you a better sense of what the wording should be.  Notice that it is Piercing THE Corporate Veil--the word "the" is necessary.<br>  <br>  "The corporate law concept of piercing (lifting) the corporate veil describes a legal decision where a shareholder or director of a corporation is held liable for the debts or liabilities of the corporation despite the general principle that shareholders are immune from suits in contract or tort that otherwise would hold only the corporation liable. This doctrine is also known as "disregarding the corporate entity". The phrase relies on a metaphor of a "veil" that represents the veneer of formalities and dignities that protect a corporation, which can be disregarded at will when the situation warrants looking beyond the "legal fiction" of a corporate person to the reality of other persons or entities who would otherwise be protected by the corporate fiction."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_th...</a>
WAl3vvNnaa	Mr. Darcy is a very proud man. He looks at people according to class and name. This is why he did not want Bingley to marry Jane Benet he saw her as a low class person no worthy for a person like Bingley. He prefers to do things the way that he sees them and will take things into his own hands as he sees fit. Again such as him avoided a marriage between Jane and Bingley. Not only is he proud but he keeps to himself and is quiet at times. It is only at the end you see is Pride start to break as he falls more and more in love with Elizabeth Benet. He becomes more sympathetic and more caring with people, but there is one person who he has always adored. His younger sister. He make more money then Bingley a year, enjoys writing, and reading. Mainly writing. <br>  <br>  Bingley unlike Mr. Darcy is more lighthearted. He sees the good in almost everyone, but he is a bit flighty and does not like to stay in one place for to long. Unlike Mr. Darcy he gives his heart away easily along with the fact that he wears his heart on his sleeve. He enjoys many people's company and does not look at class and name as much as Darcy. He enjoys dancing and just being himself. <br>  <br>  Thesis idea: You could not find two friends more different then each other in the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley are...state your main topics and then continue with the body.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I'm assuming you want to go to football games, not necessarily to be on the school's football team?  And I'm also assuming that you are currently in high school?<br>  <br>  One thing you need to know is that you won't be going to college for medicine.  If you want to be a doctor, you need to graduate from college before you can start medical school, and you don't major in medicine in college.  You also don't need to go to medical school at the same college as you got your bachelor's degree.  <br>  <br>  So at this point, you need a school with a football team and good science programs.  There are two possibilities.  One would be to go to a large state research university with a football team, such as University of Texas at Austin or the University of Florida.  The other is to go to a fairly wealthy private school with a good football team, such as USC or the University of Miami.  In addition to football, any of these schools would have strong science programs and put a lot of money into labs and equipment, which would help in preparing you to take the MCATs (medical school admission test).

For example, it is permissible to say, "Best in Show" when referring to the winner of a dog show, or really any kind of show--flowers, cats, craft entry in a County Fair...<br>  <br>  As it was used by the Yahoo!Answers team, it is taking on the connotation of a particular category or type of answer--so if answers were judged according to silliness, we would say simply "silly answers" not "the silly answers."  The same would apply for the category of answers considered "worst."  It would be "worst answers" instead of "the worst answer."|`|sjOelwhhaa	Yes, you are right:  usually we say "the" with "best" because there is only one. <br>  <br>  I'd say Yahoo left out the "the" because there are lots of best answers here.  If you ask a question, you get to choose the best answer for your question, and there is only one.  Their sentence sounds like advice about many best answers, though.  By this I mean many best answers to many questions.  That's why no "the" was in the sentence.|`|Jr6emga0aa	This is a case in which both the use and absence of "the" are correct. The reason is that there is not one best answer for everything; rather, each question has a "best answer" as determined by the rules. Thus there is the generic best answer of all each question which doesn't require the definite article but doesn't distort the meaning if it's present.

AA11632370	As far as I can remember, we had severe flood in 1988 causing damage of paddy fields, households and the warehouses where the rice were stocked. Many of the major cities also submerged by the flood waters. As we all know that the flood brings alluvium whereby fine fertile soil left behind by a flood in river valleys would cause bumper production in the following year. Therefore, there were loss of rice in 1988 but in the following years there were marked increases in rice production.<br>  <br>  PS. Beside above deposit of alluvium matters, it is also the government's commendable effort to supply fertilizer, pesticides and such items to the farmers under the then BADC that helped increase of rice production. The then dictator General Ershad being President at that time got free hand to implement urgent measures bypassing red tapes that also contributed in the increased production of rice.
AA10295714	This is how I would interpret it. I feel that it is a coming-of-age poem. Meaning that it is about the transition from childhood to adulthood.<br>  <br>  Stanza1: This sidewalk signifies child hood, and the street signifies adulthood. We're taught as children to play away from the street because it's dangerous. <br>  <br>  Stanza2: Black smoke usually forms from a fresh fire with much fuel to burn (I'm sure there is a much better symbol than I can come up with). This could signify all the problems that we face growing up, that most adults may lose sight of, and need to escape. Life has many twists and turns to navigate.<br>  <br>  Asphalt flowers. Cracks and pits in the roads leave opportunity for plants to grow through. In other words; man rips through nature to lay their own roads for their world, but eventually, nature can and will overcome.<br>  <br>  Along with the twists and turns are the white arrows. At most intersections (in life), there are arrows (decisions) to follow. We must make a choice and hope we arrive at our destination.<br>  <br>  Stanza3: As Children get older, they realize that childhood will end, and the obligations of adulthood will begin. Life is short, although it is the longest thing we will ever know or have. Yes, we'll grow into adults; we know its coming; we will get there.|`|GtgAElxRaa	i did this (same poem) last year so im not sure but here goes-<br>  <br>  sidewalk - childhood<br>  <br>  street - adulthood<br>  <br>  this "place" they talked about in the beginning - basically this "place" is so great because there is no "you aren't mature/old enough" but none of the great responsibility that adults have<br>  <br>  the moon-bird's flight - the wait and the longing for privileges<br>  <br>  The dark and depressing street in the second paragraph is adulthood<br>  <br>  This is probably from a parent's point of view because of the use of 'we' instead of 'I' and 'they'<br>  <br>  theme- you could try using the saying "youth is wasted on the young" and further interpret it from there and the fact that parents in a sense (also have to go through the strains of childhood too, but as adults) have to walk on the 'on the sidewalk'|`|e6Kyqb22aa	I think that although teachers say "What did the author mean to tell you?" I find it stupid, since each person deciphers it differently. I think that it is sad but beautiful. He/She misses a place where all is right. But He/She can't even remember the place, only that it was perfect...not that I would know...|`|98lD3z68aa	Everyone sees it differently, but the assignment is to say how you interpret the poem. <br>  <br>  To me, the theme is of a better life, a better tomorrow, to which children know the way.<br>  The mood is of optimism, of finding a place that is not dirty, where weather is not foul, and not where only flowers of tar grow.<br>  The ideas speak to fantasy, because peppermint winds only blow when there's a candy company upwind, the sun is only crimson at sunset, not when burning, grass is generally green, and who knows of the gender or existence of a moon-bird.<br>  <br>  Now take that and write your own interpretation.  Mine is trademarked.

For example, a signboard in a shop that says that all shoes would be sold at 25% discount, which tempts you to consider having a look, even if you really don't need shoes at that time. There is usually a connotation of something undesirable, when we talk of a temptation, but it need not necessarily be so.

cL0aHkYEaa	It's the formation of new bone on top of old, usually because of trauma to the old.  Here is a nice explanation from Wikipedia.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exostosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exostosis</a>|`|Jr6emga0aa	This is a bony growth on a bone or tooth. After a fracture, the bone heals by depositing bone cells around the break. It usually overshoots by depositing more than is minimally necessary. Martial artists train by creating small fractures in the bones of their fingers, the sides of the hands and feet, and joints so that they become stronger and bigger after healing. The exostoses are what allows them to break boards and bricks.

At an american universty you will have to.  There will be people to ask questions to, like friends, teachers, RA's (an older student who will live on your floor and arrange events and manage minor disputes and generally help you out) But once you find out what to do, you will have to do it yourself, barring extreme circumstances.  My advice to you- practice how to cut your own toe nails*, put your own sheets on your bed*, and do your own laundry* before you leave home.  You and your mom can do it together she'll miss you when you leave but hopefully she'll be happy knowing you can take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  *note you may know how to do these things but some international students I have known did not when they got to american university- make sure you do if you dont already, and try to think of things that others do for you that you will need to do on your own at MIT and practice those things.

Iwk92vqyaa	In a state congress, begin this way:<br>  <br>  "Mr. [or Madam] Chairman, Senators and Representatives,<br>  <br>  "I am here because I want to know if you or any relative or friend has ever had his or her life saved by an organ transplant. I know ['of', or '1', or, 'some'] such people and my reason for asking you this is __.<br>  <br>  "When a driver's license indicates that any driver can be willing to donate organs to others or for research, how does this affect my elected officials' decisions about this?<br>  <br>  "Do you ever wonder if such drivers, those willing to donate organs, are completely suitable for this enterprise?<br>  <br>  "If you wonder about that, is there a way the state can show any reason why drivers shouldn't be allowed to donate organs without medical back-up?<br>  <br>  "If your own child, parent or yourselves ever need an organ transplant, what guidelines do you think should be in place?<br>  <br>  "What guidelines for organ transplants are already in place in this state?"<br>  <br>  Like that. <br>  I included several ideas for you to work with on your own. <br>  <br>  For a group of a variety of politicians, address the Chairperson of that group and then do your speech. 3rd ADD: Ladies and Gentlemen works...good call; thumbs up.<br>  <br>  ADD: For members of Parliament, begin:<br>  "Prime Minister, Heads of State, Lords and Ladies [?] represented here..." <br>  (am not where a Parliament exists that I know about, so am at a loss there) <br>  <br>  2nd ADD: Yep, include blood donors & how/if blood is safe from virulent disease.<br>  Sheesh. Gave 'everyone' else I see here a thumbs up & I don't have one. Lost a school election that way = voted for the other one and lost by one vote... Gotta' change, here.<br>  <br>  Once MORE: My rather pathetic dictionary has, at the back, the correct way to address all kinds of people in meetings or for letters, etc. Check yours?...Must leave.|`|j9YiR51Xaa	Definately!<br>  You want an attention getter. Something shocking (but not disgusting) that will really get their attention. Talk as if your lobbying for a family whos 3 year old son was playing outside when his dad left for work and ran behind the family SUV getting crushed. When the paramedics arrived the boy had severe internal injuries and was being kept alive by machines while his family waited on a donation.<br>  Or people with cancer that are dying off at such a fast rate because no one can get them a kidney or heart transplant quickly. or how about the fact that if you donate one pint of blood 3 human lives could be saved.<br>  <br>  You need to get under their skin. Get familair with them. Study them, find out if they or their friends/family have had cancers and could have needed/or had a successful transplant.<br>  <br>  The most memorable speeches are the ones that shock you the most into reality.|`|ICD6WfjCaa	It depends - who are the politicians, you don't say - Council Members? Committee Members, State or Federal Representatives???<br>  <br>  Try - Members of the _____________________ (group name), Ladies and Gentelmen (omit if not appropriate  ie: one gender is not present).  and then off you go.<br>  <br>  Good luck

2qs2lbqFaa	In Italia non servono per il concorso di Dottorato di ricerca le lettere di presentazione. Infatti si accede alla "scuola di dottorato" (come chiamata ora, poiché proprio di scuola si tratta) attraveso un concorso pubblico (per titoli ed esami, ma a volte solo per esami col solo titolo di laurea senza guardare se hai pubblicazioni o meno) che a seconda delle facoltà può essere scritto, orale o entrambi. <br>  <br>  All'estero, in alcune nazioni, basta una lettera di presentazione, un CV dettagliato e redatto in due lingue +  la proposta di ricerca alla quale si vuole lavorare (questa è fondamentale!!!).|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Per fare il Dottorato il Italia devi fare il concorso e non sono  richieste lettere di presentazione. Se vai all'estero è senza concorso e richiedono le lettere di presentazione da parte dei tuoi referenti, valutano quelle e il tuo CV e poi decidono. Sto vivendo in questi giorni questa situazione, ho infatti spedito da poco le lettere da parte dei miei due referenti in Inghilterra per un Dottorato!!|`|wwqiXMClaa	si ma devi superare gli esami...........|`|ZZBbCrxFaa	Certamente (almeno in teoria). In Italia si accede alla frequenza di un corso di Dottorato dopo aver superato il concorso pubblico indetto dall'Università . In condizioni normali si dovrebbe vincere per merito, in pratica non sempre è così dal momento che la commissione esaminatrice è sempre interna al dipartimento. Per farla breve...se i prof ti conoscono hai maggiori opportunità; se sei loro estranea la cosa è molto più complessa...a meno che tu non abbia dei finanziamenti che porterebbero denaro alle strutture interessate. Allora potresti anche non aprire libro, presentarti il giorno delle prove ed essere certa di aver vinto.Mi spiace dirti questo, ma parlo per esperienza personale.Comunque prova, c'è sempre una possibilità!!|`|d2IiaeUIaa	SI OLTRE AD ESSERE IN REGOLA CON GLI ESAMI  CIOE' TUTTI DEVI COMUNQUE AL PRESIDE DI FACOLTA' O RETTORE COME VUOI TU  ( SE NON SEI CONOSCIUTA ) CIOE' ESTERNA I TUOI DATI ESTREMI DI TE GLI ESSENZIALI.

Ad un certo punto , mi giro e ne offro uno ad un ragazzo della fila dietro alla mia , mai visto prima ( Forse un angelo ) con sembianze da rivoluzionario intellettuale e un po' emaciato , con eskimo verde e occhiali rotondi alla Gramsci . Alla mia offerta mi chiede :" Cos'è questa roba ? " " Esproprio proletario , compagno ! " rispondo io...Lui obietta che non la chiamerebbe esattamente in questo modo , allora io gli chiedo  : " Come la chiameresti allora questa scatola di cioccolatini ? " E Lui mi risponde serafico .

Mio zio mi appioppa immediatamente un ceffone e mi sgrida senza misricordia per la mia sbadataggine , poi mi manda in questa casa a consegnare i cuscini...Potete immaginare lo stato d'animo di un bambino di quell'età....Appena arrivato a casa , suono il campanello e mi viene ad aprire la padrona di casa che alla vista dei cuscini , tutta contenta chiama il figlio ( Un bambino più o meno della mia età ) e glieli consegna  . Questo li prende nelle sue manine sporche di nutella e inizia allegramente a menare cuscinate ai suoi amichetti che erano in cameretta con lui e dopo alcuni secondi vedo quei poveri cuscini candidi utilizzati per una battaglia a cuscinate e conciati per le feste ..Gli stessi  per i quali cinque minuti prima avevo ricevuto uno schiaffo che ancora mi bruciava la guancia....La gente ricca ha iniziato quel giorno a non essermi più simpatica....sono da condannare ?|`|6c465e2144b5849933565903aa0d6598aa	mi fidavo della persona sbagliata quando un'altra persona di cui non mi fidavo mi dava i consigli giusti.... alla fine ho capito che l'apparenza inganna!!!|`|AZkd5Bsraa	beh, praticamente ogni giorno si impara una nuova lezione di vita... una delle cose + importanti che ho imparato e la prima che ora mi viene in mente è di nn avere mai pregiudizi sulle persone o x lo meno se si ha un'idea su qualcuno è bene tenerla x sè, senza "spettegolare" a caso. mi è capitato tante volte di farmi un'idea di una persona e poi di dovermi ricredere!

Capita di dover trattare argomenti di particolare interesse per un'azienda e in tal caso può avere un determinato valore. Quando si deve applicare un modello o analizzare i dati di una specifica azienda o settore di attività, allora potrebbe essere di particolare interesse per aziende. Quando la tesi sia una sermplice ricerca, invece, l'unico valore è quello di poter ottenere il pregiato "pezzo di carta".

f90f5e562a648820bf133f7d63cebe5faa	Schedule a teacher conference and work out a communication system for you and the teacher.  At the car is not the time.  My mom (I am 32 now) had my teacher sign a notebook every day where I had written down all my homework.  I was also told to bring every book home every day because I was also bad about saying, "Oh I can't do that I forgot my book, I will do it tomorrow in my other class"  But you need to have a formal one on one with the teacher either on the phone or in a conference.<br>  <br>  You could also discuss the work load with her at that time.  It may be that your child needs additional help or is not completing class work.  If it really seems like the teacher is overloading the homework go to the assistant principal or councellor|`|388e4fa0efb1117a8566597364d83fcfaa	I agree that some kind of communication system needs to be established between the teacher and you, so that you know what your child is supposed to be accomplishing.  I also agree that communicating to your child the importance of education and the responsibility of doing the homework is essential. In addition, ask your daughter why she has not be doing all of her homework, it could simply be that she is overwhelmed with it or that she is having so much trouble with a subject that she is turning away from it.  Reassure her that you are there to help her and that you will work together to find a solution to whatever the problem is if one exists.   <br>  <br>  However, I would certainly communicate to the teacher and the principal that approaching you at the car (in public and not in a private situation) and "griping" (which is definitely not a tack to take in public either) about your daughter's performance is very unprofessional and should not have been handled in that way.  The teacher should have simply asked you if a meeting could be set up so that you could discuss your child's work.<br>    <br>  In addition, I would also make sure that the principal understood that the teacher became abusive and then left  without determining a way to resolve the issue.  This is an unacceptable behavior of someone in a position of authority and a role model for our children.<br>    <br>  Also, if she did not answer your question about the homework load then make sure you get an answer from the principal about what is expected from the students who are in your daughter's grade level.  When you get the answer, double check it with the school board to see what they have set as standards to make sure that compliance is being met.  The teacher could very well be weighing down the children with homework.<br>  <br>  As someone who works in an academic situation, I find it appalling that a school teacher would act in such a manner.  I understand they get frustrated but they are also professionals and role models for the children and little ears have an amazing way of hearing everything.  I'm sure if your daughter was within hearing range, she didn't appreciate having her teacher talk about her so critically where "everyone" could hear it.  <br>  <br>  On top of that, I am assuming that the teacher is of an age that one can consider her a mature adult, meaning that her education, life experience, and maturity should have dictated her behavior -- one would expect that she should have acted like a rational person and not let her emotions take over the situation.|`|eb27982b17f96a0a6c2503526c8578f7aa	You as a parent need to teach your child the importance of making sure it's done.  I explain to my son that his only responsibilties right now are homework and a clean room.  I also check everyday what is in his homework folder and when he's done with each sheet, he shows me. If teacher says it's not done his stuff gets taken away.  He's also not allowed to watch t.v. until its done.  You just need to put your foot down|`|50a028e963295f81ba279b73eb428664aa	Well, the first thing you should not have done was alienate the teacher.  As I'm still a student, I can tell you that they're really not appreciated as they should be.  You may feel it's a lot of homework or too hard or whatever, but kids are more and more unprepared for middle and high school.  I see it happening with my sister and all of her friends.  They need to get used to that workload.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you do homework with her, and then Miki tells you that's all of it, right?<br>  <br>  What you should do is ask the teacher to send either an email to you and your husband's/partner's account with all of the assignments for the night.  If your school has a guidance counselor, you could probably go through that venue as well.  If she doesn't wish to do that, ask for a sort of assignment sheet with the necessity of having your signature inscribed the next day.<br>  <br>  Also, you should ask Miki why she wouldn't want to do all of her homework.  Is she a computer freak, like me?  Does she love television or video games?  Is she maybe having  trouble with it, a possible learning disability?  You may also want to consider if that kind of behavior is typical for your daughter.<br>  <br>  Good study habits now are the only way for her to succeed in the future.  Much luck to both of you.<br>  <br>  Ave atque vale.|`|45d24703e667f5d1c669c6693034f56baa	Ask her teacher to email you the assignments on a daily basis so that you can be sure to check it's all been done.

56a8b94738d6f7e48e7b3c672fa6b650aa	Io finora non ho mai avuto bisogno di rifiutare un voto però se fosse proprio basso lo farei, anche perchè ho la media del 27 e mezzo e non mi mancano moltissimi esami. Non è vero che il voto non conta, purtroppo molto spesso ci sono delle limitazioni. Anche per accedere a dei master tramite borse di studio molto spesso serve il 100 o il 105.<br>  Cmq secondo me è meglio la via di mezzo, ovvero laurearsi con un voto decente, magari impiegando anche 1 anno in più,senza però perdere troppo tempo.|`|5933cc7280b44c3e8b7a78b22c563236aa	Non importa dove arrivi....

Mi spiego. Ci possono essere esami preparati nella totale tranquillità casalinga ed esami preparati con i muratori per casa o ad accudire tuo padre che è stato male in ospedale. La preparazione non è sempre l'unica causa di un cattivo voto. La situazione psicologica del momento è determinante. Io ne ho dovuto preparare uno mentre mio padre era in ospedale ad operarsi al cuore. Non volevo andare ma quella mattina, passata da lui, mi ha implorato di andarmi a sedere perché altrimenti si sarebbe sentito tremendamente in colpa. Non avrei voluto, non ero nelle condizioni migliori...ma era il suo desiderio. Non ho mai rifiutato un voto e non sempre i voti presi sono meritati, a volte ti trovi davanti dei docenti esauriti che si "divertono" ad umiliarti. Mi sono beccata i miei 18 (oltre che i bei voti) senza mai rifiutarli ma ti assicuro non è stato determinante per la mia carriera. <br>  Oramai, con le raccomandazioni che girano, non si guarda quasi più al voto di laurea ma alle tue capacità mentre fai un colloqui, un concorso, una ricerca...Io ora insegno all'università...secondo te sono stati a guardare i miei voti? No, hanno spulciato le mie ricerche pubblicate, i miei articoli scritti, i miei seminari, le mie lezioni? Solo un consiglio: se i voti non sono altissimi puntate TUTTO sulla tesi, che sia originale, di ricerca, applicata. Il VERO BIGLIETTO DA VISITA è la vostra tesi, non il voto!!! Molto spesso, invece, la si scrive in due mesetti così si finisce in fretta. Quello è un grosso errore. La tesi è l'unica reale dimostrazione di quello che conoscete, che sapete fare e che avete studiato, non prendetela sottogamba o passerete per mediocri. I due 18 presi li ho recuperati con una marea di punti presi in seduta di laurea!!!<br>  <br>  Si, è meglio laurearsi presto. In un posto di lavoro a concorso a parità di punteggio passa il più piccolo. Al mio concorso per il dottorato sono passata avanti a tanti studenti che, ottenuto il mio stesso punteggio al concorso, sono stati scartati per l'età e non si richiedeva il 110, sul voto non si è espresso nessuno, non lo hanno nemmeno chiesto. Io avevo 24 anni (V.O.) e già un Master alle spalle. E' contato di più del mio voto di laurea.|`|6228ed24daebc5b39097be0e8e1d6fa0aa	Beh, diciamo che l'ideale sarebbe capire quello che si studia... Pensa se domani ti opera un chirurgo uscito con il minimo dei voti: sei tranquillo???|`|7zYDbsABaa	Cerca di dare il massimo in ogni esame. Alla fine scoprirai di sapere che voto meriti a secondo di come hai studiato. Solo avendo questa coscienza puoi rifiutare un voto avendo  la certezza di meritare di più. Se invece sai di meritare meno allora accetta ma non essere troppo soddisfatto di te, i regali non sempre arrivano.|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Io ho sempre accettato tutto. Grazie a questo a 24 anni mi sono laureata in Chimica farmaceutica. Penso anch'io che sia meglio laurearsi prima perchè ogni giorno c'è qualcuno che prende un posto di lavoro che potrebbe essere tuo!<br>  Ai colloqui poi spesso l'unica cosa che non chiedono è il voto di laurea..|`|f1e73d2a6e92058532461e9812f62a30aa	Rifiuta solo quegli esami in cui sei sicura che puoi dare il massimo, di più.|`|4bcd7fde2079eceafc3e24895331a7c5aa	Beh guarda.... un voto basso all'università nn agevola certo l'inserimento nel mondo del lavoro..... ci sono passato....|`|FtRiLwquaa	io accetto tutto. anche i 18. non devo dimostrare niente a nessuno.....<br>  voglio laurearmi e lavorare al più presto.|`|bbe1a12ab86dfd3f24466103e0b8e0a0aa	fino ad'ora nn ho mai rinunciato xkè cmq i voti sn stati + o meno giusti.Il voto + basso x ora in Matematica dv ho preso 20 ma ho sudato 30 camicie x superarla,era anke analisi matematica mai fatta a scuola quindi appena ho passato il compito m sn presa subito il voto.Oppure kimica ke la provavo da 2 anni ho preso 22 ma m è bastato,GLi altri voti sn dal 25 in su e li ho presi tranquillamente.<br>  Io penso ke qnd 1 materia è diffcile e c hai messo molto x passarla,si dovrebbe prendere il voto ke t danno anke se sai di saperla alla perfezione.Alla fine la cultura rimane a te,è quella la cosa importante|`|f94162100de9f724ed889e5c2a5cbc97aa	La mia famiglia quando a scuola prendevo 6 organizzava feste indimenticabili per tutto il quartiere!!!! il problema è che queste feste avevano una cadenza simile a quella dell'Olimpiade!!
6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Guarda io la penso così..io mi sono laureata in chimica farmaceutica, di certo non è stata una passeggiata, ma mi è piaciuta talmente tanto che la fatica proprio non l'ho sentita. Se avessi fatto un'altra facoltà, tipo lettere, giurisprudenza, o per esempio scienze dell'educazione per me sarebbe stata di sicuro più pesante, ma perchè dipende dai gusti e dalle passioni.|`|uFlg5J9kaa	devi studiare quello che ti interessa. se giudichi piacevole un argomento di scienze dell'educazione e non uno di economia, allora vuol  dire che non ti interessa l'economia e che ti sei iscritta a quella facoltà solo perchè così pensavi che avresti guadagnato più soldi in futuro... peggio per te. E comunque il lavoro di educatore è richiestissimo e richiede una grande responsabilità e una grande passione per quello che si sta facendo, non è un lavoro che si fa solo per portare a casa soldi come i bancari e gli impiegati in azienda.<br>  Io ho scelto di studiare Lingue perchè volevo imparare le Lingue, e mi interessa quello che studio e non lo scambierei nè con diritto, nè con economia nè con altre cose simili. Ho scelto quello che volevo studiare in base ai miei interessi personali, non in base alla convenienza! <br>  Non esistono facoltà facili o difficili in assoluto, e cmq un educatore non deve occuparsi di statistica nè di diritto privato, non sarà mai il suo lavoro! quanto ai libri di al massino 100 pagine, anche questo dipende da te e da quanto sei disposta a rischiare presentandoti a un esame senza aver finito di studiare tutto 3 volte, se sei una secchiona esagerata peggio per te, ma io ho amiche che hanno fatto economia in Bocconi che pure è un'Università prestigiosissima e che hanno sempre avuto anche il tempo per divertirsi e godersi la vita.|`|264ca8f60916cd688cfa4b1e3077fe9baa	Sinceramente anche a me è successo che alcune persone si lamentassero perchè dovevano studiare e magari erano soltanto libretti, a prescindere dal fatto che secondo me i libri non vadano valutati dal numero di pagine, secondo me fa parte del'indole umana di LAMENTARSI e poi effettivamente per ognuno di noi c'è qualcosa di facile e difficile e probabilmente dipende anche dalla città dove si frequenta.<br>  Volevo aggiungere un'altra cosa, vi è mai capitato che qualcuno si lamentasse perchè aveva preso un voto tipo 28?.. perchè anche in questo ci sono facoltà dove i voti sembra che li regalino ed altre invece dove bisogna sudarseli!!|`|4f71746c99beaabf2116b993b797a529aa	Ciao!<br>  Beh secondo me più che altro dipende anche dalla facoltà.<br>  A messina per esempio scienze dell'educazione è abbastanza tosta, una mia amica anche per materie "piccole" si ritrova programmi molto vasti e i contenuti sono a dir poco difficili, c'è una terminologia veramente assurda, devi studiare col vocabolario aperto, e poi sono presenti anche molte materie affini a Medicina. Quindi non credo sia così facile come dici tu.<br>  Giurisprudenza a Messina è una facoltà molto pesante e difficile, mentre a Reggio Calabria è molto più sciatta e facile.<br>  Lettere Classiche (che è il corso di laurea che frequento anch'io) a Messina è una bomba, davvero pesante, mentre , visitando i siti di alcune facoltà di Lettere di altre città ho visto che ci sono delle differenze.<br>  Quindi secondo me non esistono a priori università facili e università difficili, anche perchè per esempio se io, che ho sempre seguito studi umanistici, mi iscrivessi alla facoltà di Matematica, avrei delle difficoltà enormi, mentre un altra persona più portata per le materie scientifiche non riporterebbe i miei stessi problemi :)<br>  <br>  Cenerentola Innamorata|`|e078061115de03bc481ea3677c4c8134aa	informatica:cakkiata(solo libri da 90 pag.max)<br>  Latinologia o scienze della programmazione:libri da 400 pag.max<br>  guarda la diff"ì!|`|f7709981575fb52edb6bc133dc0104ccaa	bè, nessuan facoltà è facile, ma ce ne sono di alquanto facili, come scienze della comunicazione e psicologia|`|25e37a97238827c6b4c4124db0997260aa	Scienze della formazione e relativi corsi..cmq la facilità o la difficoltà dipende dalla tua volontà, le cose facili possono diventare difficili e viceversa. Cmq la scela della facoltà dipende anke dalle tue inclinazioni.<br>  Alla Bocconi le materie forse le regalano..altrimenti una certa Tommasi non si sarebbe laureata...ovviamente ci sn le eccezioni.|`|3e7f1e2f67af23f62e6ce5292c863c1daa	secondo me facile è quello che più ci appassiona...<br>  io studio filosofia e per me è facile, ma quando capitano in corso con me persone che magari vengono da un'altra facoltà vedo che si trovano in grosse difficoltà...|`|QQ7UeCtRaa	quello che penso io e, non esiste niente in questa vita che sia facile, qualunque cosa facciamo dobbiamo sudare. Poi devi amare quello che fai, e crederci fino in fondo. Quando poi comincerai a mettere in pratica tutto quello che hai fatto, raccogliendo i primi frutti di tanti anni di lavoro. vedrai la vita avrà un sapore diverso, e sarai orgogliosa di essere quello che sei. Spero di averti aiutato. CIAO baci|`|fdd2c9e9bcb91f63f662585a67a3c7afaa	Beh, come tutte le cose ognuno tira l'acqua al suo mulino....questo semplicemente per non conoscenza del corso di laurea...uno che studia tecniche bancarie potrebbe essere etichettato come uno che conta i soldi, uno che fa produzione vegetale come uno che coltiva patate....<br>  ....difatti io non conosco nulla di economia aziendale, ma non vado a dire in giro a priori che siccome non fate matematica o scienze affini quel corso sia una passeggiata....<br>  sinceramente mi sono rotto le scatole di sta brutta gente che se la mena perchè iscritta ad una facoltà piuttosto che ad altre....invidia o mania di onnipotenza?

Non penso ci sia un orario fisso. Sai, io ho una concentrazione fitta ma che dura solo un paio d'ore... mai studiato di più.

TWUxUlD4aa	Ti consiglio per esperienza di cercare un lavoro.<br>  Il master è considerato un surplus, talvolta è solo una perdita di tempo.<br>  E' sul lavoro che si acquistano le competenze e il saper fare!<br>  Metti in preventivo che per i primi anni ti toccherà sgobbare e avrai uno stipendio ridicolo (se avrai uno stipendio).<br>  Il lavoro resta l'unico modo per fare davvero esperienza e per conoscere il mercato e i suoi possibili sbocchi.<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|4d70d5292f0076d6cfefde51713f67e7aa	io mi sn laureata martedì..e nei prossimi mesi, dopo una breve esperienza di studio all'estero cercherò lavoro.. nn vedo l'ora di diventare indipendente! poi spesso è meglio l'esperienza sul campo piuttosto che ulteriori anni di studio per la specializzazione e masters..almeno questo vale per il mio ramo ovvero il turismo ciao :-)|`|ahjM9G98aa	Io sto facendo il dottorato ora, ma sinceramente viste le prospettive di impiego e i soldi che mi danno forse avrei fatto meglio a mettere da parte le mie passioni e cercare subito lavoro...<br>  Se pensi che il master possa introdurti nel mondo del lavoro allora fallo, ma devono essere quelli organizzati in collaborazione con le aziende, che ti danno anche una formazione a livello professionale e non solo teorica (con tirocini che potrebbero concludersi con un'assunzione), molti di quelli organizzati solo dalle facolta' sono una perdita di tempo da quello che ho sentito.|`|d02c22c53b4a75158c24dd66958eae32aa	Un mio consiglio?

Ormai anche i master stanno perdendo di credibilità perché ormai le aziende puntano sulle capacità delle persone.|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Io dopo la laurea ho fatto uno stage di 6 mesi e ora ho fatto domanda di Dottorato.|`|ab8bf7e08a0cee9fb0884b545d122fd0aa	personalmente io ho iniziato a lavorare poco prima di laurearmi, stage dopo stage sono arrivata anche a guadagnare qualche soldino, ma veramente pochi per potermi definire indipendente, tant'è che dopo un tre anni ho deciso di fare un master, finalizzato però a quello che avevo capito che volevo fare. Per un anno mi sono messa sui libri e ho fatto un altro stage. Ora però lavoro seriamente e sono diventata economicamente indipendente. Nel mio caso quindi è servito, ma dipende anche da cosa vuoi fare tu e dalla tua laurea.
c99a2712a843e4bec20dcbb797c7e851aa	E' una domanda a cui è difficile rispondere perchè non esistono ancora prove certe che sia dannoso alla salute. Personalmente non lo uso, diffido. Un principio elettrico insegna che se poni una bobina alimentata in alternata davanti ad un pezzo di ferro, questo si scalda per agitazione interna delle singole molecole o magneti elementari. Lo stesso vale per il microonde, che sfrutta un principio analogo lavorando però in altissima frequenza, perchè gli alimenti non sono materiali ferromagnetici. Non sappiamo però quale trasformazione biologica subiscano le singole molecole del cibo e se la subiscono non ne conosciamo bene gli effetti dell'alimentazione a lungo termine.<br>  E' molto comodo, certo, ma preferisco non rischiare; faccio come quando vado a funghi: nel dubbio mi astengo!|`|00b36ccded8a771bae7118dbe0b5afa8aa	no fà bene...<br>  molto meglio di quello fritto,figurati che il mio ragazzo mangia quasi tutto fatto a microonde..|`|0ab0e04e285f08cf89d7824af7b33845aa	E' buona abitudine attendere 1 minuto prima di mangiare una cosa appena uscita dal forno|`|1946b0cd3df66a8b97282b8758fa161eaa	ora ti dico. ho ascoltato in tv uno specialista scientifico e ha detto ke il microoonde  fa male anzi malissimo. tu credi che un pasto si puo riscaldare in 5 secondi? sai quando un pasto si riscalda nel microonde, sopra di egli ci si mettono i gas ed è per questo che fa  male. il micronde da questa malattia il tumore. nn ti sei mai chiesto ome mai in italia ci sono molte persone che soffrono di tumore? in tanti lo usano!!! guarda che non ti stò dicendo balle!! spero che ti fidi di me!!! sei stato bravo a fare questa domanda complimenti!!!!ps:Scaldare con il microonde fa male perché quando si scalda il cibo vengono mandate delle specie di radiazioni al cibo che fanno muovere le particelle più veloci e quindi provocano lo scaldamento, ma dopo queste radiazioni ce le "mangiamo", e questo non va bene.ciao alla prossima|`|727023ff73eb69901ef97822189bcd14aa	guarda per chi ha il peace maker (scusate se ho sbagliato a scrivere) tra le controindicazioni c'è quella di stare lontano dal microonde e di non mangiare cibi riscaldati con questo tipo di forno...qualcosa di vero sicuramente ci saà non pensi??'baci|`|934ba3a46ca97dc0da3aba422237574daa	Scaldare con il microonde fa male perché quando si scalda il cibo vengono mandate delle specie di radiazioni al cibo che fanno muovere le particelle più veloci e quindi provocano lo scaldamento, ma dopo queste radiazioni ce le "mangiamo", e questo non va bene.|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	No macchè, come si farebbe senza microonde??

6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Ti parlo per esperienza personale, mi sono laureata a luglio in chimica farmaceutica a Pisa.<br>  Premetto che la mia passione è il laboratorio, la ricerca.<br>  Dunque, appena laureata ho fatto 2 colloqui per uno stage di 6 mesi in un'industria farmaceutica e mi hanno presa. Ho finito il 31 marzo. Purtroppo non è stato il lavoro che mi avevano detto, si è rivelato completamente documentativo, di ufficio e ho saputo che questo è quello che offrono di questi tempi le industrie farmaceutiche. In Italia purtroppo, per la ricerca non c'è posto (o almeno le possibilità sono davvero bassissime) e le industrie dove fanno la ricerca si contano sulle dita di 2 mani. Io personalmente ho fatto domanda e sto muovendo le cose per fare un Dottorato di ricerca in Inghilterra. <br>  In teoria gli sbocchi di CTF poi sono la farmacia, l'informatore (ma ti assicuro che non è così semplice come tutti pensano), industrie farmaceutiche appunto, industrie chimiche, alimentari. Certo, tra il dire e il fare... <br>  Come ogni lavori inizi sempre da uno stage, poi dipende..<br>  Di certo è una facoltà che apre la mente al 100%, è stimolante da morire, bellissima, io tornassi indietro la rifarei un milione di volte, certo è che se hai intenzione di entrare nel mondo della ricerca devi essere disposto ad andare all'estero e comunque a muoverti dalla tua città in ogni caso (anche se dipende molto dalla città).<br>  Di sicuro è una facoltà che apre più strade rispetto ad altre.<br>  Si te l'ho scritto, uno degli sbocchi è la farmacia.|`|4bcd7fde2079eceafc3e24895331a7c5aa	produrre "paste" in casa...|`|7962bb4d9fe0a6eb1394d827461efb86aa	Spesso, purtroppo, all'informatore farmaceutico...un banale rappresentante di farmaci per intenderci.<br>  Se hai bravura e conoscenze magari avrai la fortuna di trovare un lavoro in qualche  industria chimica.|`|FvASw3Q5aa	molto dipende da quanto sei disposto a muoverti, per capirci se sei disposto a partire dall'italia o comunque ad allontanati da casa, puoi lavorare anche nella ricerca farmaceutica a vari titoli a seconda di cosa ti specializzi [sintesi (quelli che scoprono la molecola, controllo qualita' (quelli che controllano la produzione industriale), , farmacologia (quelli che valutano il comportamento della molecola)tecnica farmaceutica (quelli che creano la compressa/sciroppo e tutto quello che non rientra negli altri...).<br>  Se vuoi restare a casa c'e' l'informatore scientifico, e il farmacista.<br>  Come facolta' ti apre molte strade e non e' tra le piu facili.<br>  In bocca al lupo|`|a56bff39fd5727d22dc6275eabc1828caa	PORTA A LAVORARE

AA10176626	Federal grants are awarded by various government agencies to enable research organizations, state and local governments, colleges and universities, and social service organizations to perform a service - a service that the government finds useful or necessary.<br>  <br>  For example, a local social services organization might need help establishing a new food bank service for the hardcore homeless of a rural community in Wyoming. Either their grant writer, or a professional agency would sit down and put together dozens of pages of grant application, trying to convince the government of the need for the service, and the organization's unique qualifications for providing it.<br>  <br>  The key is that the government awards "grants" for DOING something. Grants are not awarded for being part of some group, or having some handicap, or being a single mom, or being in a really bad financial bind.<br>  <br>  The government offers ONE large-scale group of grant program for individuals - those are the grants that are part of the post-secondary financial aid system - grants for college. Even that's a situation where the government is supporting people who "do something" - because it's a good public policy to encourage the population to become educated. An educated population is a healthier, more efficient, and more self-supporting organization than a less educated one. So the government awards grants to students who would otherwise be unable to afford the cost of a college or technical education.<br>  <br>  If you want a financial aid grant, you must be a registered student at an eligible institution of higher education. The "grants" are paid directly to the school on your behalf, so you can't qualify unless you will be attending one of these schools.<br>  <br>  You apply for all forms of federal student aid, including the various grant programs, by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA.<br>  <br>  There are NO forms of grants for personal financial assistance, like paying bills, fixing up your house, avoiding foreclosure, etc. There are also NO forms of grants for being a single mom, being an Aleutian eskimo, or being the direct descendant of a Mayflower Pilgrim.<br>  <br>  The government DOES provide financial assistance - but those are not grant programs, those are means-tested government benefits programs. You've heard of these programs before - they're things like SSI, Food Stamps, TANF (which used to be called welfare), Veteran's benefits, disaster relief - programs like those. They're called "means tested" benefits, because applicants can only qualify if they have very low incomes and very few assets.<br>  <br>  Programs like grantoneday are scam outfits - they want you to pay them money for information that is available to you for free. If you're confused, it's only because grantoneday cannot help you apply for a grant - there ARE NO SUCH GRANTS.<br>  <br>  Take the time to visit the federal government's one-and-only internet grant gateway - you will find it at <a href="http://grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://grants.gov</a> . See that ".gov" at the end? That's your assurance that you're at an actual government website, and not a ".com" business site.<br>  <br>  When you visit grants.gov, click on "About Grants.gov" on the left hand side of the page. Then click on "Who is eligible for a grant?" in the center of the next page. Right there - the government will tell you to avoid all of the scam outfits like grantoneday - because there ARE NO GRANTS for personal financial assistance.<br>  <br>  It really is kind of sad how effectively the crooks are taking advantage of everyone's financial struggles to rake in the bucks with false promises of things that don't exist. Do NOT give anyone else your money to help you find a grant!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|AA10464818	Unfortunately, you fell for a scam website<br>  <br>  You may want to read the warnings FTC has issued against these "grant" companies:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/03/grantresources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/03/grantreso...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt134.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...</a><br>  <br>  Here is also one of the warnings issued by the Better Business Bureau <a href="http://www.concord.bbb.org/tips_timesharescams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.concord.bbb.org/tips_timeshar...</a><br>  <br>  If you want grants, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.<br>  <br>  Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.<br>  <br>  Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs <br>  <br>  The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.
45c47180e2e7f1378f12c1da27d62709aa	Io ho fatto una tesi sperimentale. Ho "sprecato" 9 mesi della mia vita a fare ricerche e altri 3 a scriverla. Alcune mie compagne d'università sono state più fortunate: i loro relatori hanno segnalato come sperimentali delle tesi ben più compilative della mia... in 4 mesi se la sono cavata. La differenza è per certi versi sottile e sta nell'occhio dei professori. Ma anche con una differenza sottile il punteggio cambia. Non so se sia universale (dopo la riforma non mi pronuncio più...) una tesi compilativa non dovrebbe ottenere più di 5 punti, una sperimentale arriva fino a 10. <br>  Rispondo alle tue domande:<br>  1) quando è opportuno chiederla?<br>  quando vuoi giocarti parecchi punti in sede di discussione;<br>  2) in che modo?<br>  vai dal tuo relatore e gli dici: "ho bisogno di tot punti. Che tesi mi consiglia?"<br>  3) a che scopo? <br>  vedi risposta uno<br>  4)in cosa consiste?<br>  Si deve dimostrare una tesi iniziale attraverso dei dati quanto più oggettivi possibili. Se fai una facoltà scientifica il problema non si pone, se è umanistica ci sono passata anch'io... è fondamentale il consiglio del prof. Lui ti saprà indicare per il meglio (sceglilo quindi con una certa cura sulla base dell'attenzione che mostra verso i laureandi)<br>  5)quanto tepo prima è meglio richiederla?<br>  dipende da te e dalla tua tesi. Se tutto fila liscio e tu sei uno stakanovista penso ti possano bastare 4-5 mesi (meglio lasciare un po' di margine per dare tempo a relatore e correlatore di pronunciarsi; ho visto gente perdere sessioni di laurea perché non avevano avuto il tempo di farla correggere). Comunque prima la chiedi meglio è...<br>  6)la si può chiedere anche per la tesi della triennale?<br>  lo ignoro... ma visto che per la triennale basta una tesina, non so cosa si potrebbe "sperimentare" senza ricavarne un lavoro fin troppo articolato... quindi, forse sì, ma perché farsi del male?<br>  7)tutti i professori la fanno fare?<br>  alcuni vogliono solo compilative... altri fanno fare delle compilative spacciandole per sperimentali... altri vogliono solo le sperimentali... dipende dal relatore<br>  8)quanto tempo richiede?<br>  più o meno si ricollega alla domanda 5)... meglio prima possibile<br>  9)in materie come archeologia, storia o letteratura cosa richiede?<br>  trovare una tesi e dimostrarla... es. stupidissimo: tesi: la nostra cultura deriva da quella del popolo cippalippa. Come lo dimostro? vado a cercare tutte le testimonianze storiche (quindi ricerca negli archivi, nei libri, nell'architettura...) e testimonianze attuali (parole cippalippesi del mio vocabolario, feste, riti, bla bla bla)... Do le mie belle statistiche e tiro le conclusioni (che se vanno nella direzione contraria alla mia tesi iniziale... è male). Il gioco è fatto. Approvazione. Stampa. Discussione. Proclamazione. Festa di laurea. <br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|aehhNLUsaa	Le tesi sono:<br>  Compilative...solo recupero e sintesi di materiale bibliografico su un particolare argomento<br>  Sperimentale...si aggiunge una sezione originale nello sviluppo di una nuova teoria o metodologia di analisi/lavoro correlata di risultati verificabili.<br>  Progettuale...qui la finalità è un opera dell'ingegno, un prodotto un idea un progetto finito. Sono spiegate le fasi di sviluppo.<br>  <br>  In soldoni la differenza è il tempo sprecato sopra, i punti che ti danno il tuo prestigio a farla. Tuti danno la prima. I prof che fanno ricerca danno anche le altre. <br>  <br>  La compilativa in 3 mesi te la cavi e fai un buon lavoro.<br>  per le altre Il tempo tipende da te solo da te.|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Io ho fatto una tesi sperimentale, sono stata 6 mesi (e è andata anche bene..anzi male, visto che in laboratorio ci stavo da dio) in laboratorio anche 9 ore al giorno, tutti i giorni. Ma  la soddisfazione che porta è grandissima perchè è un progetto che nasce e va avnti con te..<br>  La tesi compilativa te la prepari a casa, con calma ma non credo dia queste grossi soddisfazioni. E' tipo una ricerca, di quelle che ne hai fatte milioni nella vita.<br>  Io l'ho fatta sperimantale perchè per la mia facoltà (chimica farmaceutica) è necessario e bello così, x archeologia so che la fanno sperimentale, Per le altre 2 non credo.|`|4ce9fabccc7ab1aba94a00d71109a4d5aa	Io so ke il vantaggio stà nel fatto ke viene valutata con punteggio maggiore...ma deve passare un anno dal momento ke la kiedi fino alla seduta di laurea...inoltre non basta reperire fonti sull'argomento ma si deve inserire il frutto di ricerke personali, o sperimentazioni a cui si è collaborato, o progetti inediti sempre personali...La puoi kiedere tu al prof o può proporla lui...X le materie non so..x la triennale so ke si può kiedere..il tempo da dedicare dipende da te e da come vi organizzate col prof..<br>  Buon lavoro e buona fortuna x tutto!

jcJxVJ4waa	Well, for me high school is frustrating more than anything. Everyone's trying to be better than everyone else, trying to build themselves up to be more than they are, and for what? A few years of "popularity"? I don't really get that...<br>  Everyone seems to be really judgmental, too. When my friend is talking about someone she doesn't like, it's almost always based on appearance, like "Oh my Goddd look at that girl's hair!!!" I personally don't care what the girl's hair looks like, hell I don't care if she's bald, because I've never met her and probably never will. People are really immature, too, talking about stuff that doesn't matter, and just act like they never grew up past grade 6. I feel, well, out of place at times, especially since people all seem to like me when I don't really like them. I'm trying to get good marks, and get scouted by universities, and my friends say I'm crazy (since I'm only in grade 9). So they slack off and then expect me to help them. It's annoying, but I know that in a few years I'll be in university, and everyone will be more like me :) <br>  Aha I didn't mean for that to be a rant, I still like high school for the most part :P|`|O01oFg3Eaa	I was home schooled. I loved it.<br>  High school is such a joke.|`|AA10703907	I'm currently a high school girl, and I hate it. People at my school dress like complete slobs, yet all the girls insist of dumping on makeup. I go to a co-ed, non uniform, private high school where the majority of people are extremely rich.<br>  There are some cliques- the cheerleaders, the football players, the waterpolo players, the dancers, band kids (who are considered really cool in my school- we have one of the best marching bands in the nation), smart kids etc. I mostly hang out with the smarter kids, because I know them the best since most of my classes are with them (all honors). But sometimes I don't feel like I fit in anywhere- I'm tall, blonde, an athlete, and I have good grades, but I never truly fit in with a group.....<br>  <br>  All in all, high schools pretty depressing....I was so glad that school was cancelled today.|`|Td8yQTuBaa	Ok, well to begin with, I am in high school right now. My high school, unlike the rest in the area, is a uniform school, so people don't judge opthers on the way they look or how they dress or anything. Before going to high school, I was a little bit scared because this school was so much bigger than my elementary school, and only one of my friends was coming to the same school as me, so I hardly knew anyone. The first day of school went very well, and I didn't get lost or anything, but I know people who did, and they just asked an older student who helped them out no problem... I think that people build it up to be so scary, but it's really not. Then this year, I encountered first year kids in the hallways who were lost, and helped them out. The clubs and classes are also an awesome way to make friends. Even when you are shy, you end up talking to someone. Of course there are cliques, there always will be, but it's not like they hate each other or anything. Everyone co-exists in my school just fine... As for what 'clique' I am in, I'd have to say the academic nerds... lol. I have a small group of close friends and that's all I need. So, if you are worried about going to high school or something, don't worry about it; you'll be just fine!

hyHvG1Olaa	Your question has three four parts ...<br>  <br>  Part1:  In order to teach a language in the United States one must be fluent in that language and pass the required competency exams for the state in which s/he wishes to teach the language.  This is usually accomplished by a degree in the language and a B.A. degree from an accredited university.<br>  <br>  Part 2:  Each year Newsweek runs an analysis of the best universities in the United States so check out their information.  Also, check out "American Association of French Teachers" at <a href="http://www.frenchteachers.org/." rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchteachers.org/.</a><br>  <br>  Part 3:  In order to teach a language you must also prove fluency in the language of choice of the population you are teaching.  You might want to take some additional English courses or work with a tutor to gain proficiency with English.  Under the guidelines of NCLB and the state testing requirements you will need to prove proficiency.<br>  <br>  Part 4:  The best way to become a teacher of French is to follow the guidelines mentioned above and locate three to four schools you are interested in attending.  Contact the Foreign Language Department and make a campus visit.  Explain before hand in a letter to the Chair your intentions and discuss them during the visit.  They will be happy to provide you with assistance in making your choice.<br>  <br>  Good Luck ...

3b4e8819cc493e2f8e5b05b9eb9cd310aa	It depends what you want to do, really.  For instance, when I applied to grad school for physics (which has its own subject GRE test), the undergraduate advisor in the physics department basically told me that no physics program would look at my regular GRE scores, just my subject GRE, grades, and recommendations (which is a shame, as I did pretty well on it if I recall...).  Now, I'm sure there are programs where this won't be the case, likely the programs with their own GRE subject tests.<br>  <br>  One thing you can always do is go to the undergrad advisor for the department in the field your interested in at your university, and ask them what they think of your record, and of the schools you're thinking of.  They'll give you an answer, and it'll probably be a pretty good one.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	don't no.........|`|95d0a05a38cafe969eda6f67c8061f11aa	I think there are different minimum scores depending on the program you are trying to get into and the number of applicants.  For example, you may have to take the regular GRE and a subject GRE (i.e., psychology), and they may have different required scores.  Your best bet is to contact the programs you are interested in applying to, and find out what they require.|`|FNFRF6zRaa	Although it does vary from by department and University, a 1000 on the GRE is just above average and a good score for which to aim.

AA10135392	You describe the subject of the paper. You need to include the characteristics that you wish to prove your subject has. For example, I am writing about my dog. I want to prove he is energetic, friendly, and playful.  My thesis could be: "My dog Buddy is good natured".  If your teacher/professor prefers a three-part thesis, include all three things you are proving in the thesis (ex. "Buddy is energetic, friendly, and playful which makes him a good pet"). The more concise statement is usually better, but word it according to your instructor's taste.|`|2c21b76dc4ef2047566ac592b78b280aaa	Well, I would try to map out the paper by explaining three or more things that they did in relation to their family life. Each idea would represent a body paragraph. If you want to talk about how they focused all of their energy on family life, just go ahead and list all the points in a sentence by commas. If they did something to help the family, but also were very independant, write "although one point......, they also......then state the next points." Remember mix it up, thesis statements dont have to be one sentence just make sure it is a good map for the whole essay. I hope this helped a little bit. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Yeah the first example i talked about is shown in the first answer given... obviously i dont explain well.

d6b8a01e6a77e612709d3cc28ed1db15aa	3 meters per second per second (12/4)|`|7d3d5f865fda31da88ce0a9d15781c9baa	Acceleration is the rate of change in speed. It is determined by the ratio of the change in speed(v) to change to the time(t) during this change occurred. <br>  <br>  A= v/t or Aav= v/t<br>  <br>  If the ratio remains constant throughout the acceleration, then the acceleration is called constant. In constant acceleration, the same change in speed occurs at each internal of time (t).<br>  <br>  When an object's acceleration varies over a period a time, it can be described as average acceleration. Average acceleration is the average change in spee dof a object. <br>  <br>  For the next example you must assume the acceleration is constant. <br>  <br>  Sample: (finding average acceleration)<br>  <br>  Lets assume your in a boat, docked on the harbor front of Lake Ontario and you want to boat down to Niagara Falls. You accelerate from rest (0m/s) to 80 m/s in 4s. What is your acceleration?<br>  <br>  Step one: State given<br>  <br>  v = 80.0 m/s<br>  t = 4 s<br>  Aav = ?<br>  <br>  Step 2: State the equation<br>  Aav =v/t<br>  <br>  Step 3: replace the equation with the values given<br>  <br>  Aav = 80.0m/s / 4s<br>  Aav =20m/s a second<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 4: State a word answer.<br>  <br>  The boat increases in speed by 20m/s every second. <br>  <br>  So, in three seconds the boat can accelerate to 60 m/s, and by 4 seconds it can accelerate to 80m/s. The acceleration can be converted to 20m/s2.<br>  <br>   <br>  Sample 2 (finding change in speed)<br>  <br>  Kevin was chased by a man eating gorilla at an average acceleration of 4m/s2 for 40s. What was her change in speed at the end of the 40is<br>  <br>  Step 1: State the Given<br>  <br>  v =?<br>  t=40s<br>  Aav = 4m/s2 <br>  <br>  Step 2: State the equation <br>  <br>  Aav =v/t<br>  *we need to find the v so we must redefine the equation<br>  v = Aavt<br>  <br>  Step 3: replace the equation with the given values<br>  <br>  v = 4m/s2 x 40 s<br>  v = 160m/s<br>  <br>  Step 4: State the answer in sentence form<br>  <br>  Kevin's change in speed was 160m/s<br>   <br>  Sample 3 (Finding change in time)<br>  <br>  After being chased by that man eating gorialla Kevin decided to run the rest of the way back to camp. His average acceleration was .50m/s2 and his change in speed was 4.6m/s<br>  <br>  Step 1: State given<br>  <br>  v =4.6m/s<br>  t = ?<br>  Aav = .50m/s2<br>  <br>  Step 2: State the equation<br>  <br>  Aav =v/t<br>  *we need to find the t so we must redefine the equation<br>  t =v/Aav<br>  <br>  Step 3: Fill in the numbers with the information<br>  <br>  t = 4.6m/s / .50m/s2<br>  t = 9.2s<br>  <br>  Step 4: Write the answer in sentence form<br>  <br>  The change in time is 9.2 seconds.

Information (answers to your questions) soothes the soul.  College is a much larger and different world ... make a great start for yourself by taking charge and asking the questions you need to ask instead of wondering and worrying.  The only silly questions are those not asked - and freshman have a lot of questions, so the college anticipates this and expects this.  Learning cannot occur without inquiry!<br>  BEST of LUCK!!!
24cbe82f4481f98a4059fa4561ffa699aa	Your mother is your mom and wants her daughter to have a good future.  If you are fortunate to have a scholarship, then go to the schools that will accept it.  I think you should start at one of the colleges and see how it goes giving it your best shot.  You might come to like it and be happy.  On the other hand, if you don't think it is really what you want to do...keep working hard at doing your best and try some theater classes at the college.  If you are able to balance your grades and a part time job, you could get a job and start saving up for your dream.  Either way, you are probably going to have to let your mom have her way in the beginning.  You will gain respect and maturity during this time in college.  <br>  <br>  It is never too late to follow your dream.  However, you are going to need to support yourself in the future.  Once you  have your col ledge education, you'll be able support yourself while pursuing your dream.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12028690	I'd say,<br>  if you got into one of those college (excluding the acting school), you should go there, and study there.<br>  <br>  While studying, you should get a part-time job.<br>  And after you finish college, you can go to the acting school, with your own money.<br>  <br>  Then, if you didn't do well in acting school, you'll still have your degree from that college you've attend, and you could get other job as well.<br>  <br>  (If you did well then, well, you'll be an actress who'd have something 'more' than just acting skills)<br>  <br>  I think that's a good backup plan.<br>  <br>  Just be patient, that's the only way!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Sono certo che se avessi ottenuto il Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency, questo sarebbe una prova incontestabile - in effetti, avresti una competenza superiore al tipico laureando di madrelingua! I titoli italiani sono riconosciuti anche in Inghilterra - basta chiedere al Consulato o al British Council per sapere come ottenere il rilascio dell'apposito documento di riconoscimento. Pero', ti consiglio di scrivere all'Admissions Office dell'universita' che ti interessa per consigli piu' specifici.

Mi sono laureata a Luglio 2006 in CTF e ora sto facendo uno stage in un’industria farmaceutica, ma di certo non è nel settore ricerca. Come te, ho il sogno della ricerca (da sempre, e ancora di più da quando ho fatto una tesi sperimentale in laboratorio che x me è stato il massimo del massimo), ma in Italia si va avanti solo a raccomandazioni e di certo non c’è posto x chi ha la passione. Insomma, ho chiesto al mio prof informazioni x fare un Dottorato all’estero e spero di poterlo iniziare dopo l’estate. Ti garantisco che qui in Italia le possibilità x la ricerca sono sotto zero, ma se davvero la passione e la motivazione ci sono, ti dico: fai CTF che è stupenda come facoltà ma metti in conto poi di muoverti all’estero.<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|b3f85b4dba2826d687fedd178ccef428aa	io sono in tutt'altro ramo ma una cosa che avrei voluto che qualcuno mi dicesse quando avevo la tua età è questa: se vuoi fare ricerca, accetta sin d'ora l'idea d andare all'estero, di viverci per lunghi mesi o anni della tua vita. Se non sei disposto, farai sempre cose d serie B, x quanto sveglio tu sia.

Rifletti su quello che sai di lui, se sei stato a casa sua pensa anche all'arredamento. O ai suoi hobby: se fosse un amante della pittura potresti regalargli dei colori... Insomma, prova a pensarci un po', se davvero non ti viene in mente nulla fagli un regalo standard: penna in argento, bottiglia di vino (se sai che l'apprezza, altrimenti prosciutto da 10 Kg), portafoto (ce ne sono di elettronici splendidi, che ti caricano le jpg, visto che è abbastanza giovane).

VLwZU5Ekaa	sinceramente sì... ora il titolo di studio di scuola superiore ti apre pochissimi sbocchi professionali, figurati la terza media.<br>  se hai la possibilità economica di andare avanti fallo, te lo consiglio, fatti venire la voglia, anche solo con scuole professionali (idraulico, elettricista etc.) ti danno quella chance in più. Per esperienza ti dico che ho visto molti ragazzi mollare la scuola e venire a lavorare convinti di aver fatto la scelta giusta, peccato che solitamente a 15-18 anni la mentalità del lavoro non c'è, molti pensano che sia come un gioco, che come a scuola se un giorno non hai voglia di fare va bene lo stesso e non c'è cosa più sbagiata. E soprattutto senza titolo di studio o impari una professione e dopo molti anni di gavetta, quando sei veramente capace provi a metterti in proprio (idraulico ad esempio) o rimarrai operaio di basso livello tutta la vita.|`|00b36ccded8a771bae7118dbe0b5afa8aa	molto|`|2b5f50b5ada5d6f214e358adb1c9ff59aa	si fai un istituto tecnico almeno, la vita da studente non solo è importante a livello di conoscenze ma anche di vita. fare lo studente ha i suoi enormi vantaggi specialmente quando sei teenager, se hai paura della scuola o la non voglia, fattela passare e tira fuori le palle.<br>  <br>  naturalmente questo discorso vale se non hai grandi problemi economici o se non ti devi responsabilizzare per il mantenimento di qualcuno che ha perso il lavoro...|`|68077ef2ba257bac960306d8218c728aaa	andare a scuola è importante, almeno le superiori puoi farle, anche perchè a 14 anni non ti può prendere nessuno a lavorare se non in nero, e poi pensaci bene, che lavoro andresti a fare!!!sicuramente uno da spaccarsi la schiena dalla mattina alla sera, almeno con un diploma potresti sperare di impiegarti in un ufficio, o potresti andare alla SCUOLA PROFESSIONALE, quella si che ti prepara per il lavoro, c'è più pratica che teoria, informati|`|7b40d3ec650771bcb66a452653297177aa	almeno una scuola professionale, tipo enaip, che sono solo 3 anni e ti insegnano un lavoro pratico sarebbe auspicabile...|`|A9T8pb6naa	Si è negativo....finisci almeno il liceo....|`|KFmRVFvoaa	Non lo fare!!Almeno arriva fino alle superiori!|`|UGsNQ3WMaa	certo è molto negativo... prima di tutto perchr nn credo che trovi un lavoro così facilmente avendo una terza media e poi (secondo me) meglio andare a scuola ch eandare a lavorare..!|`|a0c3598611e2e11622b3c6d32ad23e53aa	Non è che sia negativo.E' che secondo me se te lo puoi permettere è giusto aumentare il proprio grado di cultura.|`|keM8lwyFaa	Se hai una istruzione superiore hai di solito più possibilità lavorative e ti permetterebbe di non fare lavori manuali....se ancora devi decidere,ti consiglierei caldamente di continuare,ancora puoi diventare qualsiasi persona tu voglia....dall'impiegato all'insegnante,dall'avvocato all'ingegnere.....se poi o non puoi o vuoi lavorare da subito e essere indipendente segui la tua vocazione....<br>  ma ricorda....le mani di un idraulico rispetto quelle di un impiegato(a prescindere dal guadagno)sono callose e ruvide.....<br>  Pensaci....<br>  <br>  <br>  Ciao|`|sFgN7FCTaa	io penso che un diploma cmq ti serve perchè ti permette di avere qlke porta in + aperta nel mondo del lavoro,magari qlke diploma in qlke istituto professionale in modo da avere una qualifica in +,ma se proprio nn riesci molla e prova cn un lavoro,io cmq te lo sconsiglio,ciao e in bocca al lupo|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Si molto, almeno un diploma serva x forza.|`|fc31024cab7df524f50b79c8b82d579baa	oddioooo.......siiiiiiiiii... fidati io non mi sono mangiato le dita ma tutte le braccia....Dio se potessi tornare indietro...........|`|247f95c90d201c8e438921f97710aee3aa	Non e' cosi' negativo, in effetti....Lo e' MOLTO di piu'<br>  ( a meno che non esistano situazioni di vita particolari per cui il lavoro  a quell'eta' e' un bisogno primario...)|`|40d1f8a3b2e56333be6b3995ec6dd5a9aa	No|`|83b1c419c9c0e13333d901e52402086caa	Potrebbe esserlo, dipende dalle tue aspettative per il futuro...

1d467f91b94c5882cb74b286738383feaa	587 years old<br>  The Forbidden City, also known as the Imperial Palace or Palace Museum, is located in the center of Beijing. Built between 1406 and 1420, it was the imperial residence of 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing (1368-1911) dynasties.Construction of the palace complex began in 1407, the 5th year of the Yongle reign of the third emperor of the Ming dynasty. It was completed fourteen years later in 1420. It was said that a million workers including one hundred thousand artisans were driven into the long-term hard labor. Today it has become one of the most important tourist attractions in Beijing.<br>  <br>  The entire palace area, rectangular in shape and 720,000 square meters in size, takes up one-third of the 8 kilometer-long central axis of Beijing’s old city proper, from the city gate of Yongdingmen on the south to the Drum and Bell towers on the north. This harmonious assemblage of buildings displays the best characteristics of Chinese architecture -- majestic style, flawless construction, and fine coordination of the whole and the parts.|`|49bc861d4f237ba6c5183a9804a061f1aa	at least 587 yaers old|`|d3a21e151d6dfee831553522c0d782b6aa	it was finished in 1420 so it might be probably maybe 587 years oold

Once finished, it's on to the next phase, whatever they may be.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the process while you can, life will give you many, many opportunities to "forget." again.|`|AA11115430	I'm in high school and forgetting things in the future is one of my fears.

857c4f3c02a3e9dad636d528ea900863aa	Myth: Large numbers of sexual predators prowl the Internet in search of children.<br>  <br>  Fact: A 2001 Department of Justice study issued by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ("The Youth Internet Safety Survey") asked 1,501 American teens between 10 and 17 about their online experiences. The study concluded, among other things, that "almost one in five (19 percent)…received an unwanted sexual solicitation in the past year." A "sexual solicitation" is defined as a "request to engage in sexual activities or sexual talk or give personal sexual information that were unwanted or, whether wanted or not, made by an adult." Using this definition, one teen asking another teen if her or she is a virgin—or got lucky with a recent date—could be considered "sexual solicitation." In reality, not a single one of the reported solicitations led to any actual sexual contact or assault. Furthermore, almost half of the "sexual solicitations" came not from "predators" or adults but from other teens. When the study examined the type of Internet "solicitation" parents are most concerned about (e.g., someone who asked to meet the teen somewhere, called the teen on the telephone, or sent gifts), the number drops from "one in five" to 3 percent.|`|AA12359885	Writing a Persuasive Essay.<br>  <br>  In persuasive writing, a writer takes a position FOR or AGAINST an issue and writes to convince the reader to believe or do something.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.orangeusd.k12.ca.us/yorba/persuasive_writing1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.orangeusd.k12.ca.us/yorba/per...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.studygs.net/wrtstr4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.studygs.net/wrtstr4.htm</a><br>  <br>  Writing Tips <br>  <br>  This page contains a collection of tips for essay writing and editing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.essaytoday.com/writingtips.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.essaytoday.com/writingtips.sh...</a><br>  <br>  Writing a Persuasive Essay<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cerritos.edu/fquaas/resources/English100/persuade.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cerritos.edu/fquaas/resources...</a><br>  <br>  Problems in Writing Persuasive Essays: No Opinions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://modena.intergate.ca/personal/gslj/noopinions.html" rel="nofollow">http://modena.intergate.ca/personal/gslj...</a><br>  <br>  Compose a Thesis Statement<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/essay/thesis.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/...</a><br>  <br>  How to Write Your Thesis<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/se...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.charleslipson.com/How-to-write-a-thesis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.charleslipson.com/How-to-writ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/th...</a><br>  <br>  Basic Structure<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/essay/" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/...</a>|`|4RlAR1vWaa	First, state the facts, like, "Did you know that your child right now is affected by the dangers of the Internet?" or something like that, captures the audiences attention make them feel different emotions, make them feel moved.

d66ca922cbc3e7544e4f633e12b3f008aa	While this may not answer all of your concerns, It appears to me that you are apprehensive about getting certified in another state, so please let me offer the following:<br>  <br>  When I retired from teaching I simply wrote to (State Office of Public Education, etc.) two of the states (Oklahoma and Alabama) I thought I would relocate to.  The certification process was quite simple and "pain free."  They issued temporary certificates, good for two years in one and five in another) with the requirement that I complete 2 required undergraduate college courses before the time my temporary certificate would expire.  Had I decided to take advantage of my "temp" certificates I could have taught in any of their public schools for the limited time allowed without taking the required courses.  Or, I could have completed the required courses in one summer and have earned the proper certification so that I could have continued to teach for as long as I may have wished to. <br>  <br>  As for benefits, I would have retained (and received) the retirement benifits from the state in which I had last taught but I would have to start anew to rebuild tenure, retirement and sick leave benefits in the new location.  The positive side of this is that after 5 years in the new state I would have become "vested" in that state's teacher retirement system, thereby enabling me to eventuially draw retirement checks from two states when I once again "retired."<br>  <br>  As it turned out, I entered another field (outside of education)  in another state and became "vested" in that state's retirement system.<br>  <br>  Prison systems would definately not be my personal choice and military systems, while probably just fine, would possibly mean the loss and gain of students throughout the school year due to the "transciency" of the parents.  Not a good situation for teachers or students.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ce8l3PJTaa	You might also try something like Sylvan learning center.  You wouldn't necessarily have to have a full day of classroom teaching every day.  I don't know how much they pay, but since it is not in the public education area, you should still be able to get your TRS benefits.  I think TRS allows you to work half-time in public schools without loss of benefits, so if you could find a district that would allow you to work 1/2-day, then maybe you could do something like Sylvan the other 1/2-day.

Ho fatto 6 mesi di stage in un'industria farmaceutica e ora ho fatto domanda per iniziare a ottobre il Dottorato in Inghilterra.

Di solito vogliono vedere passione ed entusiasmo, certo non si può generalizzare.<br>  Per l'estero sicuramente le possibilità sono molto maggiori, hanno parecchi finanziamenti e ti trovi nella situazione che sei TE a poter scegliere il gruppo di ricerca e il progetto perchè ce ne sono molti. In Italia (sto parlando sempre del mondo della ricerca) sono talmente poche le possibilità che spesso devi scendere a compromessi e magari seguire porgetti che non interessano troppo (per questo mi sono indirizzata direttamente sull'Inghilterra).<br>  Per l'estero poi non ci sono concorsi pilotati per quanto riguarda il dottorato, mandi le lettere di referenza (sempre che in quel gruppo abbiano bisogno di persone) da parte dei tuoi prof, e in base a un colloquio scelgono, è molto più pulita la cosa! La serietà almeno c'è!! <br>  Se condo me questa laurea apre molto la mente e questa è una marcia in più!<br>  Chiedi quanto vuoi! Puoi anche mandarmi una mail!|`|Zxi44ZRWaa	Dipende da vari fattori.<br>  Dove vuoi andare a lavorare.<br>  Dove ti sei laureata. <br>  E il voto conta un pochino meno.

L8zZ3eZKaa	I know someone who got 8*s and was predicted 3 As at A-Level and didn't get in. It is incredibly competitive. Not going to a private school should in theory not harm your chances as they are not allowed to discriminate, I think about 4/10 of their students are from the private sector. You will need pretty much all As and *s at GCSE. However I think Oxbridge interview a lot of candidates but most will not get in, especially for medicine as it is one of the most competitive courses.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to do lots of extra-curricula stuff to make yourself stand out as all universities like that. Doing things like the duke of Edinburgh award is a good idea. remember though this is one of the most competitive Unis and medicine is one of the most competitive courses, however I would imagine it is well worth it in the end, but it takes a lot of time and effort.

cilYUWgtaa	Here is California's nursing board's site, you can contact them for specifics. I don't live in California, but in my experience, CNAs are trained slightly more then HHAs. CNAs usually provide care in a nursing home / hospital and assist residents with daily care (toileting showering, feeding, etc) while HHAs usually do things like helping people at home to shop, prepare meals, ensure they take their medicines (but don't actually dispense meds). This is not to say that some places only hire CNAs to do home health, just that the amount of trainig is usually a bit less for HHAs than CNAs. I used to be a CNA, in a nursing home and hospital.

AA11770802	Public Law 107 -110, which is more commonly known as "No Child Left Behind" is a law that President Bush put into effect in 2001 that states that all states have to make standards and then test their children to make sure that they are learning those standards. The law also states that each year, more and more children have to pass the tests, until in 2014 when ALL children will be passing. Every year that schools don’t raise the number of students who pass the tests in all of 48 different subgroups, the school is labeled as "failing" and will be greatly penalized.<br>  <br>  For most people the name of the law, and the idea that all children are expected to pass the tests sounds like a wonderful idea. In reality there are good things that are part of the law, but they are either overshadowed by the bad things, or the way the the law is implemented. For example, part of the law is mandatory help for children who are not on grade level. Access to remedial tutoring is mandatory for children who are not making the grade. That is a good point. Sadly, the law doesn’t allow for the funds and time to do this, so many schools are now taking time out of their day to have the teachers teach the tutoring classes, which means that now there is less time for the teachers to teach the core curriculum. Subjects like history, science, social studies and geography which aren't tested have all but disappeared from most schools.<br>  <br>  What’s even more frustrating is that the more a school fails, the more sanctions are placed on it. You will hear some people state that failing schools “get money thrown at them” and it may appear as that to the outside eye, but in reality it is a curse, not a blessing. You see that money comes with ridiculously strong ties. Failing schools are forced to use scripted programs. The extra money they receive is only for these programs and for people to ensure that the program is being followed exactly.<br>  <br>  You might say to yourself like marina does, “Well, if the school is failing, it is because the teachers don’t know how to teach and so giving them a script to follow will ensure that some form of decent education is getting to the children.” I would agree, if that was truly the case, but you see there are many reasons why schools are failing and often it has more to do with problems outside the school than inside.<br>  <br>  Now before you write me off as someone who is just making excuses, I need to state that I do believe that most, if not all, children can learn. The problem is that they are different, and have different needs. As a teacher I need to be able to adapt my curriculum for those needs. For example, I teach in an extremely poor area. Many of my children do not have beds. They don’t even have mattresses or pajamas. So when we read a story about a child putting on his pajamas and going to bed, unless I pre-teach, (go over what a bed and pajamas are befor reading the text), my students won’t understand the story. Yet the scripted program does not allow for this. If I am pre-teaching and one of the “coaches” comes into my classroom, I will be written up for “non-compliance with the core curriculum.”<br>  <br>  I could go on, but YA will cut me off.

Il rendimento non conta un granché, ho fatto uno stage appena laureata in un'industria farmaceutica e l'unica cosa che non mi è stata chiesta è il voto di Laurea (che comunque era scritto sul CV).<br>  Se vorrai fare ricerca io ti dico già che dovrai essere disposto a muoverti anche fuori dall'Italia (sopratutto fuori dall'Italia), e questo te lo garantisco perché sto vivendo personalmente questa situazione, infatti ho fatto domanda per fare il Dottorato all'estero.<br>  Purtroppo in Italia il mondo della ricerca è proibitivo, non ci sono finanziamenti, posti disponibili ecc.<br>  Per quanto riguarda altri lavori, puoi andare in farmacia (anche se comunque non è così scontato come sembra trovare un posto), nelle industrie farmaceutiche appunto, lì inizi come stagista, poi se ti va bene ti assumono. Anche lì però c'è il problema che in Italia le aziende che fanno ricerca si contano sulle dita di una mano, per cui gli stage riguardano che altro lavori di ufficio ecc.<br>  E' una facoltà che io rifarei subito perchè è bella, stimolante e ti apre la mente in modo incredibile!

6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Io mi sono laureata a luglio 2006 in chimica farmaceutica. Subito dopo la discussione (il 12 luglio) abbiamo fatto un rinfresco davanti al bar della facoltà, è stato davvero molto carino, ben organizzato e divertente!! Poi la festa vera e propria l'ho fatta il 5 agosto. La mia festa è stata fantastica, abbiamo affittato una stanza dentro un agriturismo in mezzo al bosco, con tutto il vialetto per arrivare (e tutto questo a sole 120 €). I miei genitori e mia zia hanno preparato tutto, era a buffet ma con i tavolini di modo che la gente potesse stare comoda. C'era di tutto, dai crostini di tutti i tipi, zuppa, farro, pasta, torte salate, affettati, megamacedonia di frutta dentro 2 cocomeri svuotati e poi..la torta..fantastica! Un millefoglie enorme con scritto "Complimenti Dottoressa" di cioccolata e tutto decorato da un amico dei miei che fa il pasticcere con frutta e fiori freschi.  Eravamo una quarantina di persone, alla musica aveva pensato il mio ragazzo (santo!) con i cd, ci siamo divertiti un sacco, abbiamo mangiato tantissimo..una serata insomma che non dimenticherò mai!!! Le mie amiche poi si sono presentate con il cappello da laurea, quello nero col filo pendente e ho fatto un sacco di foto con quello in testa!!!|`|189d428512058a70ccc9386b52ee4a02aa	mi sono laureata  nel 2005, l'emozione che si prova è grandissima malgrado gli ultimi esami siano difficilissimi!!!<br>  ho fatto 2 feste, una con  i parenti (cena in un agriturismo), e una mega festa con gli amici a base di carne arrostita sulla brace e fiumi e fiumi di alcool (si campa una volta sola!)<br>  <br>  ciao|`|114d52a13a9f725cd10702659dd8f3a7aa	Ciao!<br>  a me mancano due esami più tesi alla fine della laurea triennale...<br>  non vedo l ora di finire l università...<br>  sono davvero stanca e per questo motivo penso di non proseguire,almeno per ora,gli studi!<br>  Un bacio!|`|d5efa2dca4b5f87f683e80895437590eaa	Mi sono laureata nel 2005 e ora mi mancano 4 esami x finire la specialistica! :)<br>  Ho già kiesto la tesi e sxo tanto di finire al più presto! <br>  X quanto riguarda le feste, beh... non ho fatto nulla di particolare x la laurea, x' ho deciso di festeggiare alla grande una volta finita la specializzazione, così almeno posso dire di aver concluso un percorso completo e non solo metà!<br>  Un bacio e in bocca al lupo x i tuoi studi! :)|`|lLLNPKTzaa	Ciao, anche a me mancano 7 esami alla laurea...<br>  Io, come ultimi esami ho lasciato 2 difficili e gli altri facili..<br>  Per la festa di laurea andrò in un ristorante con amici ed ex colleghi di fabbrica e poi un bel viaggio in America...<br>  Un bacio :* e in bocca al lupo..|`|oBqJvq8Qaa	ciao, io mi sono laureata ormai nel lontano settembre 2001....ma non ho fatto alcuna festa di laurea..non ero molto dell'umore dopo quello che era appena accaduto...<br>  però se fosse ora penso che andrei in uno di quei locali molto "rilassati"..qui a milano, per dire, c'è l'onda anomala...<br>  in bocca al lupo e buona organizzazione!|`|8c6cef8be70fa45a41a91b910e30e023aa	Non credo la mia esperienza di laurea sia particolarmente significativa...<br>  <br>  Quando ero a 5 esami dalla fine ho chiesto la tesi, scegliendo sia la materia che il docente, poiché spesso i professori ti trasformano in un loro schiavetto o non hanno un minimo di simpatia per lo studente e quindi lo trascurano o gli affidano un assistente, specie se hanno molti tesisti...<br>  Ho iniziato il lavoro di tesi subito dopo l'ultimo esame, stabilendo con la relatrice sin da subito quanti mesi ci avrei dedicato e gestendo quindi assieme i tempi...<br>  <br>  Di sicuro la tesi non è l'ostacolo più grosso della carriera di uno studente universitario! Primo perché, se il relatore ti segue almeno un po', hai una linea guida con esperienza e competenza cui fare riferimento, e che ci tiene a fare bella figura e dare prestigio al proprio dipartimento.<br>  Secondo perché in sede di discussione non devi esporre tutto quello che hai prodotto ma solo una parte diciamo introduttiva (da noi avevi max 15 minuti per esporre oltre 150 pagine di tesi!).<br>  <br>  L'unico problema, forse, è che ti vedono parenti e amici alla seduta di laurea, i tuoi genitori vogliono sentirsi orgogliosi, ecc...<br>  Ma a parte questo è più che altro una formalità... ed un bel giro di soldi tra materiale da acquistare, rilegature...<br>  C'è solo da stringere un po' i denti... Nei momenti di difficoltà io pensavo ad un professore del 4° anno, che aveva una preparazione ed un carisma straordinari... Ti sentivi una nullità innanzi a lui... Eppure, passato l'esame della sua materia, tutto il resto mi sembrò più facile, ed infatti fu l'ultimo che non passai al primo appello.<br>  <br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|952f9fa730ec743a13dd8728c6d1262faa	ciaoooooooo<br>  sono nella tua identica situazione....<br>  ho pensato di lasciare gli esami complementari alla fine perchè credevo fossero piu leggeri e invece...tutti mattoni...:(<br>  Cmq ce la faremo....<br>  alla festa ci penserò al momento opportuno, un pò più in là ma ogni9 tanto fantastico su quel giorno e sulla festa...una festa semplice con le persone che sempore mi sono satate vicine...ossia pochi "eletti"...<br>  baciiiiiiii|`|hezkqKVNaa	beata te io sto in netta crisi con gli esami ma come hai fatto te ?

Ho sempre rimpianto di non aver fatto il medico e se oggi potessi farlo non avrei alcun dubbio su quale facoltà scegliere.<br>  P.S. Cmq la mia è una vera passione, secondo me, non x "fare", ma x "essere" un medico (due cose ben diverse!!) bisogna avere un trasporto particolare, molta umanità e appunto una grande passione.Forse oggi non ti offre la garanzia di inserirti subito nel mondo lavorativo ed anche x tale motivo deve proprio piacerti ed interessarti in modo particolare,  Cmq pensaci ed in bocca al lupo

gj9WaZw0aa	guarda, io ti posso dire che, da non frequentante della facoltà di lingue straniere e lavoratrice part-time 6 ore al gg da lu al ve, l'università se è una cosa a cui ci tieni molto riesci a farla...indipendentemente se devi o meno frequentare...la diff. è lampante: se frequenti hai la possibilità di prendere appunti e di capire meglio concetti grazie all'aiuto del profe, da non frequentante la cosa inizia ad essere un pochino + difficile...ma con l'impegno si fa tutto. Vedrai ti piacerà....l'università ha il grandissimo pregio di rendere indipendente uno studente (dal punto di vista scolastico), tu potrai scegliere che appello d'esame scegliere ecc...poi secondo me è un'esperienza bellissima..la noia non saprai nemmeno cosa vorrà dire. In bocca al lupo. :-D|`|0d39e3389cab75a474bb9b70e3ba5a92aa	Fatti molti amici,non ti sara difficile... e poi ci pensano loro!!|`|60seaVASaa	allora non sei convinta di quello che stai andando a fare. sta attenta! cmq frequentare significa far metà della fatica!!! e poi ogni tanto si può anche stare a casa, non t puntano mica una pistola alla tempia! sta tranquilla e concentrati prima sulla tua scelta, poi le difficoltà si affrontano meglio se si è convinti di ciò che si fa! in bocca al lupo!|`|GMceE4s4aa	Anche la mia facoltà ha la frequenza obbligatoria, ma è anche vero che alcuni prof non prendono sempre le firme a lezione, quindi in teoria uno può anche starsene a casa a studiare...ma è sempre meglio esserci in aula!!! Se la frequenza non è obbligatoria, decidi tu se seguire o no...|`|GcgGVvJOaa	Se sai già ke t stufi nn sta neanke a iscriverti all'università..|`|uACZBA3saa	avrai un contatto maggiore con  professori,secondo me  meglio anche se devi essere costante|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Io mi sono laureata in chimica farmaceutica che (almeno a pisa dove l'ho fatta io) è a frequenza obbligatoria. Per 5 anni ho preso un treno alle 7.20 e spesso anche la sera alla solita ora perchè il pomeriggio rimanevo a studiare. E' pesante, non si può di certo negare, però aiuta tantissimo, per certi corsi, senza seguirli sarebbe impossibile dare l'esame, o comunque molto più difficile!|`|9er1Lj6Oaa	io stavo dalla mattina alle 9.00 fino alle 18.30 del pomeriggio, dal lunedì al venerdì ed è un pò duretta, soprattutto all'inizio. però se ti piace quello che fai e se ti trovi degli amici non ti pesarà la giornata trascora all'uni. se hai paura di stufarti forse non è la facoltà che fa per te...|`|65ddfa265268ee364fd92da53192e2a1aa	io frequento tutti i giorni perche anche da me è ha frequenza obbligatoria posso assicurrti che non ti stuferai..poi dipende anche dalle amicizie che ti fai...cmq tra l'altro lo hai gia fatto ha scuola quindi!!!|`|9fae8befe93d184c3a7dc1b0a92d099eaa	di solito i primi corsi si frequentano un pò tutti, giusto per rendersi conto di come funziona e per fare un pò di amicizie che possono limitarsi ai momenti di studio ma che di solito vanno anche oltre (se no, dov'è il bello)..<br>  Poi, quando sarai entrata nel meccanismo, sarai tu a decidere e a capire quali corsi frequentare perchè ti interessano, perchè devi, o perchè hai vantaggi nel farlo (es, di solito, un esame più facile o con meno materiale da portare.. ahimè spesso i prof fanno questa distinzione) e quali corsi invece non serve che frequenti (es, perchè il libro è chiarissimo o perchè il prof dice esattamente quello che è scritto sul libro come se lo stesse leggendo).. Frequentare porta via tanto tempo allo studio, e può tornarti utile talvolta non farlo.<br>  in bocca al lupo!|`|VsXfDFysaa	ma tesoro... l'università la scegli in base ai tuoi interessi, a quello che più o meno ti piacerebbe fare nella vita...<br>  se pensi di stufarti cambia indirizzo, o non iscriverti proprio...<br>  cmq vedrai che ti piacerà... io ho quasi finito e mi manca un po' non andare più a lezione...<br>  bye bye|`|eb8dd95f53878aefd88d93f9e6324c68aa	hai paura di stufarti?<br>  e potevi dirlo prima, perchè non te la fai portare direttamente a casa la laurea senza nemmeno scomodarti a fare gli esami?<br>  e poi quando hai fatto digli se ti portano pure lo stipendio...

AA12088088	Segui sempre la passione ed il cuore nella scelta del tuo corso di studi, altrimenti andrai incontro a una delusione e a un possibile fallimento quando ti rendi conto che ciò che studi non ti piace, anzi ti annoia e ti deprime! Ricordati che in un corso di laurea si esaminano gli aspetti più particolari della singola disciplina e quindi devi avere una passione che ti porta ad avere una curiosità ed un interesse all'approfondimento!<br>  <br>  Non fare ragionamenti in chiave lavorativa, perchè l'importante è DIVERTIRSI (culturalmente parlando), estendere i propri orizzonti e coltivare la vocazione che ognuno di sè ha, e che in questo caso sono gli studi! C'è anche gente che ha una vocazione che non riguarda gli studi e quindi devi essere tu a capire se vuoi studiare, e in tal caso cosa è che ti fa più felice!<br>  <br>  Vuoi un esempio concreto? Io studio l'ingegneria dell'astronautica, dello spazio.. secondo te ho mai guardato l'aspetto lavorativo?

Many students are still covered under their parents' insurance policies as long as they remain in school.  If they flunk out, their parents' insurance will generally no longer cover them, so they'll have to find a job with health coverage.  The university's health insurance isn't the greatest insurance, but it does provide coverage of the basics.|`|IpYvEh28aa	make use of the SE like google or yahoo to get some ideas first if you want to get the massive information,however if you do not want to spend so much time,here <a href="http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...</a>  is a direct and good resource for your questions.

w9vnL4Mzaa	An excellent school such as rice does not simply have a calculator goes through all of the quantitative (gpa, scores, etc - NUMBERS) data and spits out "Accept" or "Reject". Every student is different. You probably need a highly competitive gpa, (3.7 at the minimum), and some decent sat scores at the least (1800 at the minimum) and say a 30 on the act. <br>  <br>  However, you can make up for weaker scores by supplying stronger parts of your application. For example, if you have a 3.6 gpa, but you have all honors, IB, AP, or Running Start classes, and you take multiple sciences a year, or something similar (where you schedule is extremely hard) then not getting perfect grades is understandable. You can also include activities such as summer internships, research projects, and any and all extracurricular activities, work experience, or volunteer experience. If you have some activity that drastically stands out from the rest, such as a full time summer internship with Microsoft, and your major of choice is Computer Science, then you have a significant advantage. This is because the college admissions people see that you have a passion for something, and you are already pursuing it with a full-time job in high school.

R90SNarSaa	Good to see that some people don't blindly follow bad advice. The best solution is top give in to bullies. They'll still make your life miserable, but they'll do even worse if you try to stop them.|`|fo5VHocxaa	"Telling the teacher" and "ignoring them" NEVER works. Telling a teacher only works , while your about 8 or 9 , but later on people wont really care anymore , and being a "snitch" and a "grass" will probably lose you a whole lot of friends anyways. Humans were made to fight, we are built with muscles that can develop, arms that can punch , legs that can kick , teeth that can bite, Bullies just take advantage of this situation. Bullying cannot be sorted out verbally , the only way to eliminate it , is by using physical force. Kids should be taught to defend themselves in any threatening situation, I can GUARANTEE this will work. Bullies arent "cowards" , they are stupid idiots but certainly not cowards. Humans were designed to live in "packs" , where the alpha male leads , and the smaller ones follow. Kids need to stop being such pu$$ys , grow some balls , and learn to do what they were designed to do .

X9KdAsuNaa	Wilhelm Richard Wagner (Lipsia, 22 maggio 1813 – Venezia, 13 febbraio 1883) è stato un compositore, librettista, direttore d'orchestra e saggista tedesco.<br>  <br>  Wagner è stato inoltre un teorico musicale, ma è principalmente noto per le sue opere liriche (o "drammi musicali", come lui li chiamava). Diversamente dalla maggioranza degli altri compositori (ma fa eccezione anche Arrigo Boito), Wagner scrisse sempre da sé il libretto e la sceneggiatura per le sue opere .<br>  <br>  Le composizioni di Wagner, ed in particolare quelle del suo ultimo periodo, sono rilevanti per la loro tessitura contrappuntistica, il ricco cromatismo, le armonie, l' orchestrazione ed in particolare per l'uso della tecnica del leitmotiv: temi musicali associati con persone, luoghi o sentimenti. Wagner inoltre fu precursore di sviluppi del linguaggio musicale: tra questi un estremo cromatismo e l'atonalità influenzarono lo sviluppo della musica classica.<br>  <br>  Wagner trasformò il pensiero musicale attraverso la sua idea di Gesamtkunstwerk (opera totale), sintesi delle arti poetiche, visuali, musicali e drammatiche. Questo concetto è compendiato nella monumentale quadrilogia Der Ring des Nibelungen (L'anello del Nibelungo). Wagner si spinse al punto di costruire un proprio teatro d'opera, il Festspielhaus di Bayreuth per cercare di rappresentare le proprie opere così come lui le aveva immaginate.<br>  <br>  Wagner nacque a Lipsia, nono figlio del giurista e attore dilettante Carl Friedrich Wagner (1770-1813) e di Johanna Rosine Wagner, nata P?tz (1774-1848). Sei mesi dopo la sua nascita, il 23 novembre 1813 suo padre morì di tifo. Nell'agosto del 1814 la madre sposò l'attore e poeta Ludwig Geyer, che si era occupato della famiglia dopo la morte del padre. Nel 1814 la famiglia si trasferì a Dresda.<br>  <br>  Nel 1828 Wagner tornò a Lipsia dove completò gli studi. A 16 anni assistette ad una rappresentazione del Fidelio di Beethoven e da quel momento decise di diventare musicista. Compose le prime sonate, un quartetto d'archi e un tentativo mai completato di opera "Die Hochzeit". Dal 1831 studiò musica all'università di Lipsia inoltre prese lezioni di composizione presso Christian Theodor Weinlig (dirigente di un importante coro di Lipsia, il Thomanerchor), al quale dedicò la sua prima composizione (Klaviersonate in B-Dur).<br>  <br>  Nel 1833 cominciò a comporre Die Feen (Le fate), dopo essere stato assunto come direttore del coro presso il teatro di Würzburg. Svolgendo l'attività di direttore musicale del teatro di Magdeburgo conobbe Minna Planer (5.9.1809 - 25.1.1866) che sposò nel 1836.<br>  <br>  Dall'1 aprile 1837 diviene direttore musicale a K?nigsberg (l'attuale Kaliningrad). Poco dopo il teatro fu costretto a chiudere per eccesso di indebitamento. Wagner stesso finì fortemente indebitato e nel giugno 1837 riuscì ad ottenere un posto da dirigente a Riga dove poté sfuggire ai creditori tedeschi. A Riga compose il testo e l'inizio del Rienzi.<br>  <br>  Nel 1839 perse il posto a Riga. Per sfuggire ai creditori fuggì in modo rocambolesco varcando di nascosto il confine fra Russia e Prussia e si imbarcò su una piccola barca a vela alla volta di Londra. Il viaggio burrascoso gli diede l'ispirazione per comporre L'olandese volante.<br>  <br>  Trascorse gli anni 1840 e 1841 in condizioni di semi-povertà a Parigi. Completò il Rienzi nel 1840 e L'olandese volante l'anno seguente. è di questi anni l'incontro con Ludwig Feuerbach e la sua filosofia dell'ateismo e le teorie socialiste di Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, che influenzarono le prime versioni dei Nibelunghi.<br>  <br>  Nel 1843 divenne dirigente dell'Opera di Dresda. Divenne amico dell'anarchico russo Michail Bakunin. Nel 1849 fu costretto alla fuga perché partecipò ad una sollevazione anarchica e si rifugiò a Zurigo.<br>  <br>  Si separò dalla moglie dopo che questa scoprì la sua relazione con Mathilde Wesendonck. In questo periodo compose Tristan und Isolde. La sua seconda moglie fu Cosima Wagner, la figlia di Franz Liszt. Da lei ebbe tre figli: Isolde (1865-1919), Eva (1867-1942) (che sposò un filosofo precursore del Nazionalsocialismo, Houston Stewart Chamberlain) e Siegfried (1869-1930).<br>  <br>  Il re Ludwig II di Baviera era un suo accanito ammiratore. Per anni finanziò con una cospicua rendita lo stile di vita dispendioso di Wagner e supportò la costruzione del Festspielhaus di Bayreuth dove ogni anno da fine luglio a fine agosto ha luogo il Festival Wagneriano. Soggiornò in Italia ad Acireale.<br>  <br>  Nel 1882 la famiglia si trasferì a Venezia. Il 13 febbraio 1883 Wagner morì in seguito ad un attacco cardiaco. è sepolto a Bayreuth nel giardino della sua villa, Haus Wahnfried, non lontano dal teatro a lui dedicato.<br>  <br>  Drammi musicali<br>  Le nozze (Die Hochzeit) (1832, incompiuto) <br>  Le fate (Die Feen) (1834, Prima: 29 giugno 1888 Monaco di Baviera) <br>  Il divieto d'amare o La novizia di Palermo (Das Liebesverbot oder Die Novize von Palermo) (1834-1836, Prima: 29 marzo 1836 Magdeburgo) <br>  Rienzi, l’ultimo dei tribuni (Rienzi der letzte der Tribunen) (1837-1840, Prima: 20 ottobre 1842 Dresda) <br>  Wagner riteneva solo le seguenti dieci opere meritorie di essere rappresentate a Bayreuth:<br>  <br>  L'olandese volante (Der Fliegende Holl?nder) (1840-1841, Prima: 2 gennaio 1843 Dresda. Rielaborato nel 1852 (Zurigo) e nel 1864 (Monaco)) <br>  Tannh?user (1842-1845, Prima: 19 ottobre 1845 Dresda. Rielaborato nel 1847, nel 1860 (cd. "Versione di Dresda"), nel 1861 (Parigi, in lingua francese), nel 1875 (Vienna, cd. "Versione parigina")) <br>  Lohengrin (1845-1848, Prima: 28 agosto 1850, Weimar) <br>  L'anello del Nibelungo (Der Ring des Nibelungen), in quattro parti: <br>  Prologo: L'oro del Reno (Das Rheingold) (1851-1854, Prima: 22 settembre 1869 Monaco) <br>  Primo giorno: La Valchiria (Die Walküre) (1851-1856, Prima: 26 giugno 1870 Monaco) <br>  Secondo giorno: Sigfrido (Siegfried) (1851-1871, Prima: 16 agosto 1876 Bayreuth) <br>  Terzo giorno: Il crepuscolo degli dei (G?tterd?mmerung) (1848-1874, Prima: 17 agosto 1876 Bayreuth) <br>  Tristano e Isotta (Tristan und Isolde) (1856-1859, Prima: 10 giugno 1865 Monaco) <br>  I maestri cantori di Norimberga (Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg) (1845-1867, Prima: 21 giugno 1868 Monaco) <br>  Parsifal (1865-1882, Prima: 26 luglio 1882 Bayreuth) <br>  Oltre alle opere, Wagner compose un numero relativamente piccolo di brani musicali. A 19 anni compose una prima sinfonia; successivamente una sinfonia denominata Faust della quale completò solo il primo movimento, che divenne successivamente la Faust Ouverture; e poi ancora alcune ouverture, pezzi corali e per pianoforte, e una riorchestrazione della Ifigenia in Aulide di Gluck. Di questi pezzi quello eseguito più spesso è l'Idillio di Sigfrido, un pezzo per orchestra da camera scritto per il compleanno di Cosima, la sua seconda moglie. Sono abbastanza popolari anche i Wesendonck-Lieder, conosciuti anche come Cinque canzoni per voce femminile (Fünf Gedichte für eine Frauenstimme), che furono composti su testi di Mathilde Wesendonck contemporaneamente alla composizione del Tristano. Da ricordare anche una Marcia per il Centenario Americano composta nel 1876 su commissione della città di Philadelphia.<br>  <br>  Dopo il completamento del Parsifal, Wagner si propose di riprendere a scrivere sinfonie, ma non scrisse più nulla di importante.<br>  <br>  Le overture ed i passaggi orchestrali delle opere di Wagner sono spesso eseguite come concerti: per la maggior parte di questi Wagner scrisse personalmente dei finali che permettessero una conclusione compiuta. Due esempi sono dati dal preludio del Parsifal e dalla marcia funebre di Sigfrido. I finali di Wagner non sempre però migliorano l'esecuzione concertistica: il preludio del Tristano viene infatti più spesso eseguito nella sua versione originale (direttamente tratta dall'opera) che nella versione da concerto.<br>  <br>  Da ricordare infine che il coro nuziale del Lohengrin è una delle marce nuziali più eseguite in Italia e nel mondo anglosassone. è curioso notare come questo brano sia così diffuso nonostante il fatto che nel Lohengrin il burrascoso matrimonio tra Lohengrin ed Elsa termini irrimediabilmente dopo venti minuti dal coro nuziale.<br>  <br>  Le 113 opere di wagner sono catalogate con la sigla WWV che sta per Wagner Werke Verzeichnis (Catalogo delle opere di Wagner) che comprende anche le opere non-musicali.<br>  Poemi e abbozzi non musicati<br>  L'astuzia maschile è più grande di quella femminile, ovvero La felice famiglia degli orsi (M?nnerlist gr??er als Frauenlist oder Die glückliche B?renfamilie) (1836) <br>  La saracena (Die Sarazenin) (1841, 1843) <br>  Le miniere di Falun (Die Bergwerke zu Falun) (1842) <br>  Federico I (Friedrich Barbarossa) (1846) <br>  Gesù di Nazareth (Jesus von Nazareth) (1849) <br>  Achille (1849) <br>  Alessandro (1849) <br>  I vincitori (Die Sieger) (1855) <br>  La morte di Rolando (1866) <br>  Le nozze di Lutero (Luthers Hochzeit) (1866) <br>  Wieland il fabbro (Wieland der Schmied) (1849)<br>  <br>  Opere in prosa<br>  Di Wagner è stato detto che ha lasciato ai posteri più scritti che musica. La sua produzione letteraria è imponente, e spazia dagli articoli di giornali alla novellistica, dagli scritti autobiografici (fra cui spicca Mein Leben, composto su richiesta del re Luigi II e inizialmente destinato solo a una ristretta cerchia di amici, pubblicato infine postumo nel 1911) ai saggi e alle opere teoriche più impegnative, da interventi su temi pratici come la direzione d'orchestra o la proposta di riforma della cappella reale di Dresda alla politica.<br>  Tristemente famoso è il saggio Il giudaismo nella musica (Das Judentum in der Musik), scritto antisemita concepito come un attacco all'antico protettore Meyerbeer e pubblicato con lo pseudonimo di "K. Freigedanken" (in tedesco, libero pensiero) nella rivista Neue Zeitschrift für Musik in due puntate, il 3 e il 6 settembre 1850.<br>  <br>  Lista delle opere principali:<br>  <br>  L'opera tedesca (primo articolo di Wagner, apparso anonimo sul giornale dell'amico Heinrich Laube Zeitung für die elegante Welt il 10 giugno 1834) <br>  Pellegrinaggio a Beethoven (Eine Pilgerfahrt zu Beethoven) (novella apparsa sulla Gazette Musicale di Parigi in quattro puntate nel novembre 1840) (1840) <br>  La fine di un musicista a Parigi (Das Ende eines Musikers in Paris) (novella) (1840) <br>  Virtuoso e artista (articolo) (18 ottobre 1840) <br>  Sulla musica tedesca (articolo) (1840) <br>  L'artista e il pubblico (articolo sulla Gazette Musicale del 1 aprile 1841) <br>  Halévy e l'opera francese (1842) <br>  Abbozzi autobiografici (Autobiographische Skizze) (1843) <br>  Sulla cappella reale (memorandum) (1846) <br>  I Wibelunghi: dalla leggenda alla storia (1846) <br>  La saga dei Nibelunghi (abbozzo in prosa) (1848) <br>  La Germania e i suoi prìncipi (Deutschland und seine Fürsten) (articolo anonimo apparso sui Volksbl?tter del 15 ottobre 1848) <br>  L'uomo e la società attuale (articolo anonimo apparso sui Volksbl?tter del 10 febbraio 1849) <br>  Arte e rivoluzione (Die Kunst und die Revolution) (1849) <br>  L'arte dell'avvenire (incompiuto) (1849) <br>  L'opera d'arte dell'avvenire (Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft) (1849) <br>  Arte e clima (Kunst und Klima) (articolo apparso sulla rivista Deutsche Monatsschrift, febbraio 1850) <br>  Il giudaismo nella musica (Das Judentum in der Musik) (articolo apparso sulla rivista Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, 3 e 6 settembre 1850) <br>  Opera e dramma (Oper und Drama) (1850-1851) <br>  Un teatro a Zurigo (Ein Theater in Zürich) (1851) <br>  Comunicazione ai miei amici (Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde) (1851) <br>  Il furto dell'oro del Reno (abbozzo in prosa) (1851) <br>  Relazione conclusiva sull'"Anello" e sulla sua genesi (1862) <br>  Prefazione all'edizione dei libretti dell'"Anello del Nibelungo" (1862-1863) <br>  Stato e religione (über Staat und Religion) (1864) <br>  La mia vita (Mein Leben) (1865-1880, edizione pubblica 1911) <br>  Che cosa vuol dire tedesco?

Con una visione strategica di medio e lungo termine. Non stiamo parlando dell'amministratore delegato di una multinazionale, ma del pluriricercato Osama bin Laden. E dopo aver potuto verificare l'abilità della sua Al Queda (La Base) nel trarre profitto dagli atti terroristici, ora saggiamo la sua capacità nel gestire il commercio della droga. <br>  Il "grande bluf" tirato all'occidente dal Mullah Omar e da bin Laden prende le mosse dal piano dell’Undcp, il programma antidroga delle Nazioni Unite. Piano costato un mare di polemiche al responsabile dell'ufficio, Pino Arlacchi. L'Afghanistan è stato fino a pochi anni fa il numero uno nella produzione del papavero d'oppio, con i suoi 90 mila ettari che forniscono la materia prima per la produzione del 75% dell'eroina che gira per l'intero pianeta. Territori situati nel territorio controllato dai Taliban. Beh nel 1998 parte la "svolta": con il corano in mano, i funzionari dell'Undcp chiedono chiesto ai Taliban di promulgare una "Fatwa" (sentenza) che bandisse la produzione d'oppio. Omar accetta, in cambio di cospiqui finanziamenti (erogati direttamente ai contadini, spiegano all'Onu) necessari per riconvertire a grano la produzione. La sentenza viene emessa. Nel febbraio scorso i funzionari del braccio operativo dell'Onu alla lotta al narcotraffico, si arrampicano sui monti afghani del "quadrilatero d'oro"e stendono il loro rapportino: al posto dei papaveri ci sono sterminati campi di grano e ortaggi. Vittoria. Vittoria apparente. Mentre i funzionari scendono per i duemilaottocento metri i due pokeristi Omar e bin Laden hanno già rastrellato il piatto. Nella "Fatwa" c'è una crepa. Un cavillo. Si parla di produzione, ma non di vendita. Difatti l'oppio delle piantagioni è già stato stoccato in magazzini situati in bunker nascosti nelle montagne lungo il confine. E le raffinerie funzionano a pieno ritmo, sfornando tonnellate d'eroina. Nel frattempo l'Afghanistan ha chiuso i rubinetti e per la legge della domanda e dell'offerta i prezzi vanno alle stelle. All'Onu esultano: "i magazzini del Tajikistan stanno per esaurire le scorte. I prezzi salgono. Fra poco la droga che circola per il mondo subirà una drastica riduzione". Calcolo errato. I rubinetti riaprono. Quest'anno, secondo i calcoli dell'Onu, i Taliban incasseranno dalla vendita dell'eroina ben 10 miliardi di dollari, il triplo rispetto all'anno scorso. Circa 20 mila miliardi di lire, una mini-finanziaria. Tutti soldi che finanziano la Jihad. E ora, con la guerra, non c'è nulla che possa impedire ai Taliban di rimettere in soffitta il grano e riseminare a papavero.<br>  GLI ANNI '90<br>  Quest'ultimo decennio del XX secolo si è aperto in Italia e nel mondo, con una serie di grossi mutamenti, imposti da un generale disagio nella società civile e nelle istituzioni. <br>  Economicamente, la crescita produttiva, che negli Anni '80 aveva rinviato la discussione di alcuni problemi, si è arrestata all'inizio del 1990. Le grandi aziende nazionali, come FIAT e Olivetti, hanno perso di competitività a livello internazionale, aggravate da problemi dell'Amministrazione italiana e da un'inflazione al di sopra della media europea.<br>  La crescita della criminalità organizzata <br>  L'Italia ha rischiato, inoltre, di restare esclusa dal processo di integrazione Europa, anche a causa della sempre maggiore offesa della criminalità organizzata in Sicilia, Calabria e Campania, ed in parte minore anche in Puglia. <br>  In queste regioni, nel 1991 sono stati commessi il 75% dei reati di sangue del Paese, e le organizzazioni criminali, sostenute da un'ampia rete di complicità, sono riuscite in alcuni casi, anche ad esercitare una grande influenza sul territorio, sulla politica e sull'economia locali. <br>  La lotta alla mafia è stata sempre più decisa, ma la risposta della criminalità organizzata è stata una vera e propria sfida allo Stato. Una serie di efferati omicidi, nel 1992, ha accentrato l'attenzione nazionale sui problemi di mafia: il 23 maggio è morto, in un attentato dinamitardo, con la moglie e tre uomini della scorta, il giudice Giovanni Falcone, precedentemente impegnato nel pool antimafia, ed il 19 giugno è stato assassinato (foto) il magistrato del pool antimafia, Paolo Borsellino, insieme a cinque agenti della scorta; si sono, inoltre, susseguiti altri attentati dinamitardi in Toscana e nel Lazio. <br>  Pinocchio, il petrolio e i politici.<br>  Ricevo dal professor Ugo Bardi, presidente di AspoItalia, un nuovo articolo: uno dei suoi arguti scritti, in esclusiva per Petrolio, che ci spiegano con semplicità il problema dell'esaurimento delle risorse. Stavolta, il professor Bardi usa Pinocchio per far capire la situazione ai politici. Che dire? Proprio un bell'accostamento...<br>  Pinocchio e le pere: il petrolio spiegato ai politici. di Ugo Bardi<br>  Parlando di petrolio, certe volte si dice che abbiamo consumato circa la metà delle riserve esistenti e per spiegare il problema si fa l’esempio di un bicchiere che potrebbe essere visto come mezzo pieno o mezzo vuoto. La reazione è spesso non proprio quella giusta, specialmente da parte dei più ottimisti. “Se il bicchiere è ancora mezzo pieno,” ci si sente rispondere, “vuol dire che ancora di petrolio ce n’è, e allora qual è il problema?” <br>  Questo è un atteggiamento tipico dei politici, per i quali l’orizzonte temporale considerato non va oltre le prossime elezioni, che si sentono tranquillizzati dal fatto che per quella data fatidica il petrolio non sarà ancora finito. In effetti, si sente dire spesso che “ai ritmi di consumo attuali, le riserve dureranno ancora 40 anni” il che, evidentemente, sembrerebbe non porre problemi a quelli di noi (non solo politici) che non sono più proprio imberbi. <br>  Invece, le cose non stanno così. Il problema con il petrolio c’è, ed è grave. E’ il paragone con il bicchiere che non è quello giusto. Se pensiamo a un bicchiere pieno di birra, il primo e l’ultimo sorso sono la stessa cosa; è sempre la stessa birra, finché ce n’è. Ma per il petrolio le cose sono diverse e, se vogliamo fare un esempio semplice per spiegarle, dobbiamo pensare piuttosto alle pere di Pinocchio. <br>  C’è un punto nella storia in cui Geppetto offre tre pere a Pinocchio. Prima di mangiarle, Pinocchio se le fa sbucciare e non mangia i torsoli. Dopo un po’, però, si accorge di avere ancora fame. Dato che non c’è altro da mangiare, non gli resta che attaccarsi alle bucce e ai torsoli. <br>  Allora, bucce e torsoli li possiamo certamente definire “pera,” se vogliamo. Non è detto, però, che siano altrettanto buoni degli spicchi ben tagliati e sbucciati. Il problema del petrolio è tutto qui: il petrolio “buono”, quello fluido e facile da estrarre e raffinare, è finito o sta finendo. Quello che resta sono bucce e torsoli, petrolio viscoso, pieno di zolfo e difficile da estrarre e raffinare. Non è che non ci sia più petrolio, ma le cose non sono più come prima. E si va sempre a peggiorare: i problemi non aspettaranno 40 anni per arrivare, stanno già arrivando. <br>  ” Vedi dunque, - osservò Geppetto, - che avevo ragione io quando ti dicevo che non bisogna avvezzarsi né troppo sofistici né troppo delicati di palato. Caro mio, non si sa mai quel che ci può capitare in questo mondo. I casi son tanti!...”|`|fCTzHBUGaa	lettera.storia o letteratura, attualità

The best version combines a simple sugar syrup and fresh squeezed lemon juice. This recipe serves two. <br>  <br>  Instructions<br>  Difficulty: Easy <br>  Things You'll Need<br>  1 c. sugar <br>  1 c. water <br>  1 large lemon <br>  16 to 20 oz. cold water <br>  ice <br>  garnishes (optional): mint sprig, lemon slice, maraschino cherry <br>  Steps<br>  1Step OneMake sugar syrup: Combine 1 c. sugar and 1 c. water in a saucepan and heat to boiling. Remove from heat, stir to dissolve sugar completely, and allow to cool. (You'll only use a couple of tablespoons per serving, but this is a good item to make ahead and store in the refrigerator, covered. It keeps for weeks.) <br>  2Step TwoFor each serving, combine the juice of half a lemon, 2 tbsp. of the sugar syrup and 8 to 10 oz. cold water in a tall glass. <br>  3Step ThreeAdd ice and any of the garnishes (or all of them, if you're feeling festive). Serve immediately. <br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  One lemon, depending on its size, will yield about 1/4 to 1/3 c. juice. <br>  For a quick microwave version, combine 2 tbsp. sugar and 2 tbsp. water in a tall, microwave-safe glass. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir to dissolve completely, cool a bit, then add fresh lemon juice, cold water and ice, if desired. <br>  Be extremely careful when handling hot sugar syrup. It can cause a nasty burn. A child can make the lemonade once the syrup is cooled, but an adult should do this first step.|`|1cf16c2775d4be8bf94edff8f551feb2aa	How about you have your brother do his own essay|`|AA11691571	"lovely" has been reported.. <br>  <br>  hope you finish your report in time.|`|AA10877879	erm... it's really easy just do making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

g8JGLnk6aa	It really depends on what your degree is in. I would see the career department at your school and ask them what types of job prospects are available for people with an AA degree who don't plan to get their Bachelor's. If your AA is very broad and not confined to a specific specialization then you may run into trouble finding a job (especially if you don't have a Bachelor's). If it is more specialized then you have more options.

Bfpqr1Omaa	CTF è l'acronimo per chimica e tecnologie farmaceutiche !cmq ti posso dire che è una facoltà tostissima molto lunga e in cui nessuno o quasi (3-5%) si laurea in corso, quasi tutti gli esammi sono scritti e  orali quindi è come se li dovessi dare doppi. L'unica soddissfazione è che una volta laureati c'è possibilità lavorativa  e però è un lavoro che specialmente se fai l'informatore del farmaco ti pota parecchio in giro. Inoltre è una laurea a cicclo unico cioè dura 5 anni ed è riconosciuta dall' unione europea cioè il tuo titolo vale anche all' estero solo ch es edecidi di frmarti prima non hai niente in mano, come invece accade pre lel lauree 3+2. Quindi iscriviti a questa facoltà s esei convinta molto motivata e con un carattre molto equilibrati erchè spesso gli esami si danno più di una volta.ciao e spero di esserti stat d' aiuto|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Per titti070772: ctf esiste eccome, è Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutiche. <br>  <br>  Mi sono laureata in CTF a Pisa nel Luglio 2006. E' una facoltà che rifarei un milione di volte. E' difficile si, ma secondo me offre un sacco di soddisfazioni e gratificazioni, ti fa apprezzare il mondo della ricerca e del laboratorio, è una facoltà che apre la mente tantissimo. Insomma io non mi sono assolutamente pentita e la rifarei eccome!<br>  Come ti hanno già scritto, è una laurea specialistica a ciclo unico, non esiste il 3+2, ma ti garantisco che se ti piace non senti il peso dello studio. E’ anche vero che la maggior parte degli esami hanno una prova scritta e una orale, alcuni (per esempio da me Analisi dei farmaci I, II e III) anche una prova pratica, ovvero fai un tot di ore di laboratorio (di solito 10/15 giorni per 4 ore al giorno) in cui vengono valutate le analisi e le prove che fai e poi quel voto fa media o cmq influisce sul voto finale.<br>  Per il lavoro futuro dipende, io ho deciso di intraprendere la strada della ricerca (perchè dopo 5 anni ma sopratutto dopo una tesi sperimentale ho capito che è il laboratorio il posto in cui devo stare) e ho chiesto di fare un Dottorato in Inghilterra. Le alternative sono poi la farmacia (e avrai modo di capire se ti piace o no durante il tirocinio che dovrai fare durante il corso di studi, di solito dal 3° anno in poi), informatore scientifico, industria farmaceutica (io ho lavorato anche lì ma non è tutto oro quel che luccica), industrie chimiche ecc..insomma gli sbocchi in teoria sono tanti, certo è che come per ogni lavoro non è così facile!

6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Mi sono laureata in ctf quasi un anno fa, non ho mai avuta nessuna intenzione di lavorare in farmacia (anche perchè dopo il tirocinio mi è venuto davvero il disgusto) a tempo indeterminato, ma rifarei ctf per un milione di motivi. E' una facoltà che ti apre la mente, è stimolante, è dura certo, ma dà un sacco di soddisfazioni. A me ha fatto capire (dopo 5 anni+7 mesi di tesi sperimentale) quanto io ami il laboratorio, la ricerca e questo però mi ha portato a cercare all'estero, fare dei colloqui in Inghilterra e Olanda, perchè qui in Italia le possibilità sono davvero poche. Ho lavorato anche in un'industria farmaceutica ma non era il lavoro che tutti pensano, era tutto di documenti e ufficio, ma comunque era uno stage e sul curriculum conta parecchio. Io ora sto cercando di realizzare il mio sogno, cioè il Dottorato di ricerca, quindi questo per dire: merita assolutamente intraprendere questo corso di studi indipendentemente dalla farmacia.|`|Lec6RQ1caa	Sono al terzo anno di Università: il primo anno ho frequentato CTF, ma il mio sogno era diventare medico. non avendo superato i test la prima volta ho fatto un anno a CTF. CTF è una facoltà che ti consente, oltre fare il farmacista, di lavorare in industrie farmaceutiche e aziende relative (pensa alla Bayer, alla Roche ecc). Purtroppo in Italia questo settore, cosi come il settore della ricerca è ancora poco sfruttato. Intrapendendo questo corso di studi devi partire dal presupposto che dovrai andare fuori, dove le possibilità di lavoro sono molteplici e rendono economicamente bene. altra cosa: prova a chiedere quanti siano i laureati in Farmacia che lavorano nei punti vendita... ti renderai conto che i farmacisti che si possono definire tali sono ben pochi... chi ha padre o madre farmacisti spianano la vita ai figli...no?|`|dSfVnASeaa	il mio ragazzo studia farmacia ma solo xlke ha la farmacia del padre...dice sempre ke ki prende quella facoltà rimarrà fregato se nn  ha già la farmacia xke gli studi sono tosti e si finisce col fare il commesso..x ctf devi andare fuori all estero x lavorare se nn vuoi fare l insegnante o il commesso..
VBY6psCAaa	I am also interested in an MBA.  Here in California, most of the good b-schools will want you to have a few years of work experience.  Also, you will need calculus - two classes (which I'm sure you've completed).  Then, you'll need roughly two lower division accounting courses and I believe one upper division course.  However, this could vary from school to school.  I'd advise contacting an advisor at the school of your choice - or the schools - and finding out what they're looking for.<br>  Good luck!

I am in US, but I am learning Chinese language by a special and innovative service in Beijing Chinese School ( <a href="http://www.hellomandarin.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellomandarin.com</a> ) . I like to learn in live class ( <a href="http://www.hellomandarin.com/demo/demo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellomandarin.com/demo/demo.h...</a> ) with teachers from Beijing directly. If you have any questions about learning Chinese, you can get a private study adviser ( <a href="http://www.hellomandarin.com/program/program.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellomandarin.com/program/pro...</a> ). I also like to practice Chinese with volunteers freely everyday on ( <a href="http://www.hellomandarin.com/connectingchina" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellomandarin.com/connectingc...</a> ) . Watching Chinese learning TV on CLTV ( <a href="http://cltv.hellomandarin.com" rel="nofollow">http://cltv.hellomandarin.com</a> ) is also interesting and helpful to practice listening and learn more about Chinese culture ( <a href="http://www.hellomandarin.com/ilovechinese/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellomandarin.com/ilovechines...</a> ).
6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Allora ti parlo per esperienza personale. Io e il mio ragazzo ci siamo laureati in Chimica Farmaceutica. Ora, a settembre, lui inizierà un Dottorato a Dublino, io un anno in un'industria chimica in Olanda. Noi abbiamo prima di tutto parlato con i nostri relatori (che sono persone eccezionali) poi abbiamo contattato direttamente i vari supervisor di vari gruppi di ricerca. Questi gruppi li abbiamo cercati su Internet, in base all'argomento e poi, fortunatamente, conoscevamo pesone che erano state sia a Dublino che a Maastricht dove andrò io che ci hanno fornito importanti informazioni. Abbiamo fatto poi il colloquio, perchè all'stero, come saprai non si va avanti a concorsi ma a colloquio e CV.<br>  In bocca al lupo.<br>  Quindi ti consiglio di inviare una mail direttamente al supervisor del gruppo che ti interessa (tientiti cmq più porte aperte).|`|4Rp142qqaa	Dovresti essere più precisa e comunque rivolgiti alla tua facoltà..

2uZQ4yoOaa	labour, capital and enterprise are 3 of the 4 factors of production...the 4th being land.<br>  <br>  land=everything that comes from planet earth - so from both the land and the sea. e.g. oil, vegetables, fish<br>  <br>  labour=physical and mental contribution of the work force (don't take decisions but follow the decisions taken by the enterprise)<br>  <br>  capital=can be divided into physical and human capital. physical-e.g. roads, tools, machinery. human-value of the workforce and the investment in the workforce. (includes infrastructure as the social overhead capital-investment in the overall workforce so not just the workforce of a company).<br>  <br>  enterprise=management/risk taker/entrepreneurship.person or ppl who take the decisions and the risks. risks b/c there is not always certainty that profit will be earned.this factor organizes the other 3 factors of production to produce for needs and wants of customers.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :) Good luck!!
dXc2TXTGaa	I guess you have a problem. Therefore, you should suffer the consequences of your action (or inaction as the case may be). Your only option is to tell your teacher you didn't get it done and ask for an extension. Tell the truth, no BS. You probably won't get a full grade, but it's better than the zero you will get otherwise.|`|Tyd4rbIXaa	idk

Io sono laureata in Chimica Farmaceutica, la mia tesi è stata di ricerca e il 3 settembre inizio il lavoro di ricercatrice, il mio sogno..ma in Olanda. Ti garantisco che la famosa "fuga di cervelli all'estero" è reale e indispensabile. In Italia non c'è verso, o cmq è molto molto difficile.

oBbs00ZDaa	50 degrees<br>  <br>  because ray BE bisects <ABD, that means that <ABD is split exactly in half so that <ABE equals < EBD.  With that said, set the two equations equal to each other to find X since the angles are equal, meaning that they have the same answer.  X should come out to be 8.  But you are NOT DONE.  Then take the equation for <ABE and substitute the X with 8 and the answer should be 50.  if you need a further explaination, e-mail me.
AA10478980	How about a continent where everyone gets along well and there is no crime or violence?|`|oBbs00ZDaa	You can pick a color and make it a theme, like green or blue.  Maybe the continent can have a theme of music.  It can also be pillow-land, where people really appreciate their, sleep.  It could also be sportsland, or ice cream land.  I suppose you can just take your favorite thing in the world and make it a theme.
