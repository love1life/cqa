RhEhzGbraa	If you do not maintain homeowners insurance on your property, the bank will force place a policy.  This means that the bank will purchase a policy which normally costs 3 to 4 times what you are currently paying for homeowners and furthermore it will usually only cover the home up to the amount you owe.  Your personal property will not be covered.  Neither will your interest in the home above the mortgage amount and you will not have personal liability coverage.  <br>  <br>  The mortgage company will add the cost of the insurance to your escrow account which will probably cause you to have a negative escrow account resulting in a substantial increase to your monthly payment.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would do everything possible to get that roof substantially repaired (the insurance company will accept a repair if the roofing company certifies that the roof is now in good condition) or replaced.  Roof leaks can cause substantial interior damage, mold and even fires.  The insurance company is right for requiring that you replace your roof.<br>  <br>  If you can't replace it, you might want to try to see if the FAIR Plan for your state will insure you.  They might be willing to at least write a fire policy for you--which provides limited coverage but is still acceptable to the bank.  The FAIR Plan is a quasi-governmental program that provides property insurance for impaired properties.  To find the FAIR Plan for your state google FAIR Plan along with the name of your state or contact a local independent agent to help you apply.  Getting a FAIR Plan policy (if they approve you) gives you the advantage of a lower cost than the forced placed policy the bank will try to force on you and will therefore along you time to get the money together for a roof replacement.<br>  <br>  Once you have repaired the roof you should have no problem obtaining insurance in the standard market place.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Have you shopped around?  If you cannot obtain insurance coverage on your own, the lender will force-place insurance for you (likely at much higher rates).  Either find alternate insurance or (better yet) replace the roof.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Your insurer is correct.  A hard rain should not cause water leaks to the inside of the house.  A roof in good condition prevents same.  And I hope you didn't make a claim based upon minor damage from the water leaks.<br>  <br>  No insurer is going to want to take on the risks of further damage to a house with a roof which is not water secure.<br>  <br>  If you cannot provide insurance because of this situation, the lender will 'force place insurance' on your house.  Such insurance is extremely expensive, and will not cover YOU, but will cover the lender only, such that they are reimbursed for damages or total destruction of your house.<br>  <br>  If you pay for this forced insurance for two years, you would have been able to replace the roof for the cost of two years of insurance premiums.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	I went through the same thing when I bought my home in 1982, my then current auto insurer didn't want to insure the house because they thought it needed a new roof. State Farm insured me with no problems. It was 15 years before I replaced the roof!|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	The Fair Plan is a good place to go if you can not get insurance.   And, no one will insure you with a bad roof.

Pur8Ghc8aa	From just what you've given us....<br>  <br>  Liquidity is the ability to convert something to cash, such as selling something.  It's related to losses because you may have to reduce the price, or take a loss, to convert it to cash.<br>  <br>  An example is if I have a brand new iPod and I take it to work with me to sell.  The market there may not have the cash to pay for the new iPod, but if I really must sell it, I would have to reduce the price to sell it quickly.<br>  <br>  Instead of selling it for the $200 I wanted (no one would buy it at that price, making it not liquid), I had to sell it for $50 (making it VERY liquid).|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Liquidity is "cash in the bank".  Businesses need to have it to get thru the bad times when no customers are buying goods. If the business does not have the liquidity, they have to borrow but today there is no one who is lending.

myG2hhaKaa	"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it you will land among the stars."<br>  <br>  That being said, I think you should go for the RN. If that doesn't work out (even after giving it all your best) then you can go on to try and become a CNA. Have you been working towards a CNA certificate/degree? If you have, then maybe it would be wise for you to finish that up first and then pursue more schooling. I'd hate to tell you to drop out, if you are already in the midst of getting a CNA certificate. You can always go back to school.<br>  <br>  Or else, if you want to start off slowly, earn a CNA certificate, while at the same time, start taking one or two classes that will help you earn a RN - if you decide to do so at some point down the road (I'd do psychology, maths, Englishes first --as sometimes Science classes, such as anatomy & physiology expire over a certain time period - usually 5 yrs.)<br>  <br>  But, if you haven't started any program yet, and you want more money and better opportunities, I'd go straight for the RN. If you study hard and make sure you have good time management, it's doable to get an RN while raising 3 kids. It might take a little bit longer- if you want to go slower- but start now. Some schools have a waiting period anyway. So, you can get the easier pre-reqs out of the way now.|`|92d8731117ebf851bec3adb2b243da3daa	Do you want to make $60k+ per year or $25k per year?

The pictures you described are considered inappropriate. That kind of exposure could easily be called Sexual Harassment. With all that you have listed regarding the semi-nude photos and calendar, it would be wise for you to let your supervisor know the photos of nearly nude male and females are offensive. <br>  <br>  Under California law Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Amended, according to the EEOC it would be considered Retaliation if you are fired after reporting Sexual Harassment or any other violation of your statutory rights. So, never be reluctant to report these issues.<br>  <br>  To keep your job - simply tell your superior in a nice way - you'd like to meet with them regarding safety issues and nude or semi-nude pictures that are offensive to you. Explain to them you want to keep your job, but the offensives are affecting your ability to do your job.<br>  <br>  If this situation is not remedied immediately - approach the next chain of command up to the Human Resources Department. Let them know if the pictures and the safety hazards are not fixed, you will have no other choice but to exhaust your chain of command and take these issues to the EEOC, which stands for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Most likely your employer will take heed to this demand promptly.<br>  <br>  For more information - forward a copy of your post to the state and or federal agency in your area. You can go on-line and read about your rights via the EEOC.<br>  <br>  If you don't let somebody at work know about these situations; they may not be remedied. Nobody has to be subjected to Sexual Harassment and or Safety Issues on the job.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Those politicians that signed off on it don't even understand it. They didn't even bother to read it before they voted. I will give it a shot. The stimulus plan is a tax they these 6th graders and their grandchildren will likely have to pay on for the rest of their lives. It is the largest tax that has ever been imposed in this country. You might tell them that the will work from January to at least until June to pay for this tax. It is an attempt to change the social structure of this country to a form of socialism from capitalism where the government takes from those who are succesful and gives to those who fail. This country was founded on capitalism which gives citizens the freedom to start businesses and succeed or fail based upon their hard work and initiative. Under socialism the government takes property and money from those who work hard and are successful and gives to those who are unable or unwilling to provide for themselves and their families. The stimulus plan is a plan to alter the course of this country. Under this plan the government has already taken over a big part of the U.S. banking system. There is a good chance that the government will seize control of some of the other major banks which will give them control over our banking system. The stimulus plan should be called a stimulus tax. It does little to generate jobs. It does have a lot of social programs that this country cannot afford. You might tell them that as this stimulus plan unfolds we are likely to start paying much more for everything we purchase. Under this plan the Federal Reserve, which prints money for the U.S. government will begin to print money. The more money that is printed the less value it has. That is why everything is likely to cost more in the coming months and years. This is called inflation. We are also likely to see much higher interest rates due to inflation. You might try to explain to them how their freedoms are being taken away, but that may not mean much to a 6th grader. It doesn't seem to mean much to most adults. I think it will when they realize the true ramifications this bill really means to their lives and this country. I didn't mean to ramble.

No matter if the bond trades to $95 or $105 the stated coupon is still 8%, however the actual interest rate a new investor would receive would be higher or lower than the original coupon rate relative to the price that they paid.  <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Buy 100 ABC Company 8% coupon bonds for $100, coupon is 8% and interest rate is 8%.<br>  <br>  Buy 100 ABC Company 8% coupn bonds for $95, coupon is still 8% but the interest rate received would be 8.42% since you are still receiving the $8 but only had to invest $95. <br>  <br>  Cheers

tdQTZPI7aa	Without money in the bank you cannot do anything or move anywhere.<br>  Getting a job is your first priority|`|zP1ReEsCaa	Hi there!<br>  First and formost speak with a mortgage broker you can trust to check out what (if any) mortgage plans you qualify for. There are still some "no money down" loans but in most cases you'll still need to pay for closing costs which can be a pretty penny. With some sellers you can include these into the contract to get them back at closing, however you'll still need the money for them up front. With bank owned homes and short sale properties it's usually not an option to have the closing costs included so keep this in mind if you start looking. Also, please don't get yourself into trouble.. you should always keep a couple months worth of "cushion" money in case something unexpected happens...we always hope it doesn't but it's better to be prepared! Have a goal in mind and start saving.. if moving out is a priority for you try to start making proactive choices to help you reach your goals as quickly as it's possible. If your living situation reaches a point where you must move for safety reasons perhaps a friend or public agency could help you out temporarily. If you have any other specific questions I can help with I'm happy to do so! I wish you the best of luck! :)

"It is precisely because there is so much common ground between the two posts that the mapping of the respective territories should be the starting point," says Adrian Cadbury, whose eponymous guidelines launched the separation of the roles in the United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  The most important contributors to the success of any split-leadership structure, of course, are the chairman and the CEO themselves. To identify the right people, boards should assess not only the technical skills of the candidates but also the way their mental dispositions mesh — or fail to mesh.<br>  <br>  For chairmen, the most important characteristic — over and above the usual ones, such as integrity and leadership ability — is a lack of ambition to be CEO: only someone content to serve in a secondary, behind-the-scenes role can have a productive and trusting relationship with the chief executive. The lack of rivalry fosters cooperation, eases the flow of information, and helps chairmen to serve as effective mentors to CEOs and to revel in their success.<br>  <br>  The 2 articles attached would be useful to your study.

I would expect those jobs that would come closer to meeting that income level starting out would be marketing, engineering or nursing. A graduate degree would come closer to starting out at in that salary range than an undergraduate degree. Most college graduates will likely start out in the $30-40,000 salary range. If you have gotten some work experience during your college time that should help you to start at a higher salary level than someone with no practical experience. Internships can help you to gain some exposure to a particular industry and could assist in getting a foot in the door. I would expect some positions to not start at a higher salary and more time at work could be the norm rather than less. Companies want to get more from employees with the down economy. That may require you to work harder and perhaps longer than a standard 40 hour work week. During tax season you will likely be working a much longer day than other times of the year if you work in accounting. Accounting and finance careers could also require longer days toward the end of the year to prepare for the new year.

After several customers had bought upwards of 6 at a time, a limit was put on to 3 per customer. If a supermarket were to adopt the attitude of "it doesn't matter who buys how many as long as they sell", then customers soon get peed off when they go to the store expecting to get a bargain only to find that they've all gone. It's not good business sense in the long run.|`|bVROvLNSaa	It depends on the supermarket.  <br>  <br>  Some will limit purchases to 3 per family grocery order or something like that.  <br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter to the grocery store who buys these items and how many they buy as long as they pay with real money.|`|HskD8XYOaa	Yes its fair if other people want the bargains they have to get there first.|`|b378fc3361a04779c15bf427c58b87afaa	The person might normally buy the quantity you seen them with special offer or not, you don't know.

FATyhyZ2aa	I go there a lot.  /  People dress a little more formal than just casual wear.  I think this is to look like they know what they are talking about when giving technical advice on products.  One of the key things I seek in an sales person is trying to find out if a product exists at all to meet a need I have.  Then if it does, & they have 3 different models, I want to know how they differ.  I always respect that even though they are showing me the priciest model (I'm guessing sales bonus for their personal pocket), they are always honest enough to let me know if a product has more features than what I need & can point me to a less costly product.  (This keeps me coming back & seeking same sales assoc.).  /  Most everyone I've met has been sincerely pleasant.  Even if spending a lot of time with me & questions that do not result in a sale.  They are apologetic that they couldn't help or will speak w/ mgm't to see about getting product.  This relaxed attitude makes me think that employees do like job & are comfortable there.  /  Intv.?  Yahoo has link to ABC news video about 5 main mistakes on job intv.<br>  1-Don't fidget, chew gum, mess w/ hair<br>  2-Sit tall & smile.

That selectiveness shows you are more bound to stay w/ company you pick.  Can ask, "Why is this postion open?  Is it new?  Does no one from within company want it or qualify?  Do you promote from with in?<br>  5-Don't give hardship information.  i.e. If you hire me I'll do my best b/c I need job to keep me out of foreclosure.  NOR, I wasn't fired from my last job.

He could do anything he wants because his credit is top notch.<br>  <br>  Now, as far as closing the other account...not sure on that one. I don't think you want to close it immediately, but maybe after a while. Maybe keep it for a little while and just charge a little something on it from time to time and pay it right off...just to keep you with another account in good standing.<br>  <br>  The thing is that you can't get a high credit score if you don't have *enough* things to show either. It is really pretty dumb, but usually I think it is not a good idea to close the other one right away.

But if you can't get credit any other way, and the terms allow you to get some ownership/equity in the property, it might be an alternative to just renting.  But I would look very hard at the entire deal.  A couple of things to look at especially closely - what happens to the equity that you do build if you can't make a payment, and what will determine the purchase price of the home.  <br>  <br>  For example, say you make every payment for 3 years, in full and on time, and you build $2000 equity in the house.  If you are then a week late, what happens to your equity?  What if you're a month late?<br>  <br>  And say the house is worth $100,000 today, but in 3 years, it's worth $115,000.  What figure do you use to set a purchase price?  <br>  <br>  I would go into a deal like this very, very carefully.  I would want to know the creditworthiness and business history of the seller/landlord.  After all, you are entering into a business deal with him.  <br>  <br>  I would also want the deal reviewed by a lawyer.  Buying a house is usually the largest financial deal that a person makes, and it's cheap insurance to have the paperwork - ALL of it - reviewed by a lawyer.  Most people don't have the experience to form a valid opinion on the paperwork.|`|e843a70685501dd3baec5a35b05ddab4aa	Well don't just think your credit is bad. Go see a lending company. They will exactly tell you what needs to be done to qualify for home. They will help you in any and by all means. Economy is hurting for new buyers. if you have income, trust me you will be qualify for home that you can afford based on your income.  I live in tulsa, OK and i deal with First Mortgage Company, they are very good with people. you just have find lender that care for and not after your money.  if one lender denies you go to another, to another. Trust me some will approve you.<br>  <br>  Also renting to own is not scam but it is very very thin line. Its like if you miss on payment after making payment for 2 years,  you will not be eligible for it.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	I am also a realtor and I would like to know one thing. if credit is your problem then what will change between now and a year from now regarding your credit. the answer is very little and that said you will never get approved for the loan anyway, especially now.  if you have great credit and your problem is the down payment then you should by all means go for it. This is how you know. Go to a bank and get a preapproval. Tell them that you will have ten percent or the price and the down payment is not a problem. if you can get preapproved then yes do it. if not then you are wasting your time and money.  the problem with rent to own is that you get in and the place feels like yours. So what do you do, start fixing it up and doing improvements with cash and sweat equity and then you have to leave.  Be smart and do the homework. For a Realtor to just make that kind of a statement about teaching you how to do it is very interesting. How to do what? You use part of  the rent as the down payment is how it is supposed to work and it will build over time.At the end of that time you need to use that amount to look like the downpayment and close the loan, IF YOU CAN GET THE LOAN.  Good Luck...  PS EVERYTHING MUST BE IN WRITING INCLUDING THE TARGET CLOSE DATE.

Check to make sure that they have not updated it, also in my past experience it can take a couple months for the update to go through because they have to send it to the credit reporting agencies. If you have just recently paid it, this may be the case, if it has been a while and there is no update, try calling the collection agency first to see what is going on and if they are no help pursue further action.

They don't want to release the "responsible" one and only keep the one who is most likely to miss payments.

Ask your siblings if you can "pay them" with gifts over 10 years *or* bite the bullet and make the gifts.<br>  <br>  You won't owe tax if these are your first taxable gifts (you get a $1million lifetime exclusion), but the taxable gifts are part of your estate.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	You can't avoid the Gift Tax filing requirement if you give more than $13,000 to any one recipient in any one tax year.  Give more than that and you must file, and once you've exceeded $1,000,000 in your lifetime the tax will start ti kick in.<br>  <br>  The problem is that it appears that you were a joint owner on the account, with right of survivorship.  Effectively that bars you from refusing an inheritance.  If you could have done that, no Gift Tax would come in to play.  <br>  <br>  Tip for the future -- don't have anyone as a joint owner on an account except a spouse.  Add someone as Payable on Death (POD) and they can refuse it so that it rolls back to the estate.  Make them a joint owner and they may lose the luxury of that choice.<br>  <br>  Overpaying for something won't solve the problem either.  The excess is treated as a gift which leaves you in the same bucket of snot.<br>  <br>  However with the numbers you are talking about it would appear that you are looking at giving each of them $10k and then buying out their equity shares.  Since the $10k is less than $13k, you avoid the whole stinking mess of filing Gift Taxes.  If it's going to be more than $13k for each of them, give them $13k now and $13k each year until you have completed the gift and you also avoid the whole mess.
NwkZ5OmCaa	This sounds like a USA question.<br>  <br>  If your father just died and you *haven't* claimed the money yet, you can disclaim the money back to the estate.  Then the money is divided using the terms of the will.  Disclaimers have to be made in writing to the executor within 9 months.

NcFWcO3Laa	Go to any direct lender in your area and get a free pre-qualification. Direct lenders tend to have lower rates and charges and when they say they can do the loan, they do the loan.  A loan broker has to go out on the open market and sell your loan usually to a direct lender.  The loan broker makes a fee and so does the real lender.  It's called cutting out the middle-man.  They can tell you exactly what you qualify for, what your payment will be, and the amount of money needed to close the deal.  <br>  <br>  If you are getting money for a down payment the person giving the money is required to sign a "gift letter" saying the money is not a loan but a gift.<br>  <br>  I would go with an FHA loan because of the low down payment and FHA will allow the seller to pay up to 3% of the sale price of buyers closing costs.   An FHA is by far the easiest loan to get in todays market.  You are going to pay PMI or MMI unless you put down 20% on the conventional loan.  But have direct lender figure both the conventional and FHA loan figures and go with the one that fits your needs and financial situation best.<br>  <br>  In a few years when you get 20% equity, then refinance and drop the MMI.<br>  <br>  There is no reason you and your girl friend shouldn't buy a house together.  Wow, you might break up.  If you get married you might get a divorce (50% of all marriages break up).  I would take title as "tenants-in-common"  not as "joint tenants".  Buy a property right now with the prices this low is an excellent plan.  <br>  <br>  It would be wise to draw up a partnership agreement prior to buying the house and you might consider stating that if the partnership desolves prior to you both getting married to eachother or prior to an agreed length of time that you would split the profits equally after paying back the parents first.<br>  Good luck|`|racnq84Vaa	No offense, but why would her parents loan you two money when you are not married?<br>  <br>  The hassle of dividing assets when not married is too great.<br>  <br>  But if you still insist on asking her parents, then you ask.

The education credit only reduces tax, so if they don't owe any, it doesn't do give them more money.
e1jgTlEMaa	It totally depends on the field, the employer, and the interviewer.  Without knowing any more details, in general, I'd suggest preparing to answer the following questions:<br>  <br>   -- Why do you want this internship?  <br>   -- Why do you want to work at this firm in particular?<br>   -- Why would you be the best candidate?<br>   -- Example situations -- toughest class, proudest accomplishment, one thing you'd like to improve upon, demonstration of teamwork, etc.<br>   -- What do you hope to accomplish during the internship?<br>  <br>  Be prepared to discuss anything that's on your resume.  Also, might be a good idea to check on any recent news on the employer, so that you appear knowledgeable.<br>  <br>  Remember to show some enthusiasm!!<br>  <br>  Also prepare 2 or 3 questions to ask your interviewer, in case you're given a chance.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

With less money, you'll shout louder because the competitive space will be quieter. Use the opportunity to acknowledge existing issues brought about by the economy. Value and trust are something people are looking for. they want partners who feel their pain and are trying to do something to make lives easier. so it's up to you.

kho74FORaa	Good for you! More people at your age should be involved in the market, That said, lets address your questions, Where to start? Well, I am assuming that you will not be trading on a daily basis so I would find someone that knows someone in the business that they can recommend to you to be your broker.A broker is someone that is licensed to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities etc. for the general public. This broker is key to your success or failure as his advise will weigh heavily on what you buy. So, find someone that is responsive to your needs and will explain the whys and hows of the market and, most important, will take time to give you the service and help you will require. I am not a fan of mutual funds so I can't recommend any one fund to you. Not that they are all bad, I just never liked the idea of a bunch of stocks pooled together and hope that as a group, they all do well. As to what to look for in stocks? One word of advise here: EARNINGS! This is paramount in selecting stocks at this time of economic crisis. Dividends are usually paid from stocks that have good earnings and that is a plus for you and something that you will appreciate long term. Blue chip stocks are always a good investment long term. The days of stocks ending dot com are long gone so do not be taken in on the man on the street that tells you "Do I have a stock for you!" Talk to your broker and trust his decisions until you get a handle on what is what, then after a period of time, you will be a regular expert on the market as it is not that hard to understand. It just looks complicated. Buy low, sell high. Sound advise and if I could give you my own piece of advise it would be the following: If your stock increases to the point that you perhaps double your money, sell half so that you are now playing with there money. Don't think that you are going to be the next Carl Icahn or the likes. Take your profits and reinvest in something else so as not to have all your eggs in one basket. Right now bonds are a pretty sound investment as there are some on the market that are yielding 7 - 8 %. Not real exciting, but very safe. You might want to invest in something you know, like a hobby that you have and what that hobby has in equipment. At least you will know for instance, what Five Iron is if you play golf or what a Wilson Basketball is if that is what you like. Just a thought. Good luck to you!|`|tBXn97NNaa	You sound very precocious, good for you. :)<br>  <br>  The risk of any asset (stock or otherwise) decreases as the price falls.<br>  <br>  Buy index funds over time, and dollar cost average into them.  Don't waste the time deluding yourself into thinking you have "an edge" over other people.  <br>  <br>  Statisically, half of investors won't do better than the average, particularly over long periods of time..  Then there's transaction costs which subtract even more capital from American business. Do yourself a favor, buy a very low cost index fund and you won't do any better than average, but you WILL do better than 95% of investors.<br>  <br>  EDIT: seesam, let's hope you can keep being person A all the time. You may like to think you can, but you can't.  I do know one thing: I CAN be the average all the time.|`|I1VivZxfaa	If you want to get involved with stocks, don't look for a broker quite yet.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to read about the basics of the stock market.  Understanding the type of orders, what a margin is, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, please follow the following trading rules very strictly :<br>  <br>  1. Before trading with real money, set up a practice account and trade fake money for at least 5 months.<br>  <br>  2. Don't gamble...first determine what your investment objective is and your trading style.  eg. if you have a small amount of money, then don't try to be a day trader, and trickle your money in (ie. dollar cost average - basically buying fixed number of shares to average your cost in.  ETFs are a good idea because they are a broad based index.  <br>  <br>  3. If you can't follow rule 1 or 2, then cut your hands off and reattach 5 months after closely observing how the platform and trades work<br>  <br>  Remember, if you want to play with stocks, you will lose.  If you want to treat stocks as a serious business to make money, then treat it as a serious business<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ilXapkHBaa	Talk to series 7 licensed pro.

AA10464818	It is hard to find grants to start a business -- especially for a food stand. <br>  <br>  Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business. <br>  <br>  One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product.

Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pVzwvoGXaa	There are two ways of promoting your website, these are:<br>  <br>  Pay Per Click<br>  <br>  You can use programs such as Google Adsense and bid on a particular keyword, when a search is carried out on that word your website will appear on the right hand side.

Ha. Ha.<br>  <br>  No problem; you can amend your site.<br>  <br>  Use Google Keyword Tool and look for a keywords related to your niche.  Pens, for example. Anything with 400 monthly searches or more is a good market. <br>  <br>  Then type those keywords into the normal google search engine.  See how many results pop up.  Anything 2 million or less is a good keyword for your home page.  Anything 3 million or less is a good keyword for other pages of your site.<br>  <br>  Your pages, articles, blog posts should be at least 300-600 words.  Your keyword needs to be sprinkled naturally throughout that post so that the density is 2 - 6%.  In other words, if your content is 300 words long, make sure your keyword shows up at least 6 times. Anything more than 6% is considered spamming.<br>  <br>  You need to take this into account on every page.  Make sure it sounds natural, and make sure it makes sense, too.  Think about your customers.  Why would they want your pens and ink when they can just go to Walmart and get it cheaper?  Think about this carefully.  Put yourself into the mind of the customer.<br>  <br>  After you've done that, submit your site to DMOZ.  It's free.  Add it it to Google's Add URL.  If you're wiling to pay for traffic to get flooded to your site, be sure to research carefully which sites will do that properly. Some traffic submitters use pop-unders, i.e. your site can become a pop under. <br>  <br>  That's okay for some people, but if you've got Adsense on your site, Google will drop your commissions. So be careful.  Also be careful of traffic sites submitting your siten to unrelated directories, giving you junk traffic.  You don't want to be submitted to a golf directory which has nothing to do with pens.

That part of the price can evaporate quickly, if that expectation is not being met.  Even having land prices remain high but not increasing will destroy that expectation, and so trigger sales. <br>  <br>  You need to be monitoring for this failure to increase to signal time to unload it.<br>  <br>  Just for comparison, land in Southern Ontario in small lots is selling for 11,000/ acre, but this is within commuting distance of cities and towns. Out where commuting is not possible, prices closer to your 4800 /acre are normal.

Your manager should have made contact with the police and made arrangements for doing something about this man. He has not and since you really need the job you may have to be pushy with both your manager and the police.<br>  1. Next time you call the police on him let them know that if the car gets there in less than 5 minutes, there is free coffee and donuts waiting for the officers.<br>  2. Work on you boss to make arrangements with the police to see this man get the treatment he needs.  <br>  3. There are some cities that will not do anything with troublesome homeless, if yours in one of those you are likely to be stuck dealing with him yourself.  Have you invited some of the football players from your high school to come around, they may be better at convincing this guy not to bother you.<br>  4.  If you run out of options you will need to consider your safety as being worth more than the job.  If you get to this point I suggest you let your boss know you will have to quit if he can not find a way to deal with this guy.<br>  <br>  EDIT; You have the right to refuse service to anyone.  He can not stay if he is not being served.  If he refuses to leave the police would then have cause to arrest him.  Be sure to check with the police before you insist on his arrest.  There is also the possibility that he will still come back after he is released. His willingness to vandalize may mean he is willing to do more.

Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.  Getting a refund doesn't depend on your income, it's just refunding any overpayment that you made for the tax you owe.|`|AA11284831	I'm in that income range and go both ways.  Most years I wind up paying, but that's my choice.  I'd rather pay a little under $1,000 at filing time than have a large refund coming.  This past year I took a beating income-wise and also had a job loss so I wound up heavily over-withheld and will get a refund of a couple of thousand.<br>  <br>  It's not your income, but how you plan your finances that determines whether you get a refund or have to pay at the end of the year.  That applies whether you make $25k per year or $2.5 million.

5Z90vsGJaa	normally, nursing schools that gear students for a BSN also gears them up for the RN license. Also with ASNs. you need to pass the NCLEX exam to get an RN licensure. then you will be an RN with either an ASN or BSN.<br>  <br>  you want to be an NP so you're goal is to go for a BSN. ignore the ASN unless you want to take the the nursing route a slow-step-at-a-time life. After getting your BSN, take at least 1-2 years of work experience as an RN and then apply to a grad school for your specialization in NP.  You must have a BSN, that is the only fact i can not stress enough.|`|AA12148298	not sure what state ur in but here thats the degree that u have to have in order to sit for the boards. just cuz u pass the school doesnt make u a nurse u have to set for and pass the boards|`|LuXq0Ja4aa	There are three basic steps involved in becoming a nurse practitioner. First, you must train as a registered nurse (RN). You then need to obtain clinical working experience as an RN. The final step is to take additional nursing training. <br>  <br>  To become an RN, you must complete a degree or diploma in nursing, and then pass a provincial/state exam. It is sometimes required for graduates to have a bachelor’s degree, rather than a diploma, and in the future it is likely that all RNs will need a degree. See the nurse profile for more information about becoming an RN. <br>  <br>  You will then need to work as an RN for a period of 1 to 3 years before applying to a nurse practitioner program. Admission requirements vary slightly by program, so it’s a good idea to contact the school you’re interested in for their specific information. <br>  <br>  Nurse practitioner programs lead to a master’s degree, diploma, or certificate, and are generally about 1 to 2 years in length. Many programs also give students the option of studying on a part-time basis. Students complete both classroom study and supervised clinical work.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	each state has its own requirements for the designation RN, so you have to read your state's rules and laws on this.  BSN is very likely a fine start, and it may or may not be sufficient.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of states in which BSN is more than enough.<br>  <br>  Google will find your states' requirements -- or you can look for the professional licensing board through the state website.  [likely yourstate.gov]

AA10263406	Rentals right now are big business. I have had no shortage of people calling me in the last several weeks looking for a place to live.<br>  <br>  The last time I got a home equity loan (this was 2007), they asked what day I wanted to make my payments on, and gave me up to 45 days before my first payment. Would that be enough time to remodel the place? Other than that, with the way banks are right now, it would be very hard to get the type of loan you are looking for I think.

9xM5heGYaa	There is a huge reason that a person may not want to hold much (if any) stock in the company they work for:  diversification.   In other words, it is bad to put all your eggs in one basket.   Let's say your company goes bankrupt.  That means you no longer have a job AND your entire retirement savings is gone (if it was invested in company stock because a bankrupt company's stock is worthless).  Unfortunately, many employees put all their retirement into company stock because they don't know any better.  They are doing this against the most basic, text-book premise of investing and they don't know it.  This is why you hear all those stories of people at Enron having lost all their retirement money.  That is the risk you take when you are not diversified.<br>  <br>  Companies encourage their employees to buy their stock because they believe it gives the employees an extra incentive to work harder.  In other words, if you work hard and do your part to make the company more profitable, the stock price will increase and your retirement savings will increase.   <br>  <br>  It is a terrible idea to have any more than about 10% if any of your retirement savings in your company stock.|`|tByalcqvaa	Holding stock in your employer isnt a bad idea .

Your shares would be worthless if that happens.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	It is said that people who work for sausage manufacturers tend not to eat sausages.|`|TcyuVk8Qaa	Companies encourage this behavior because if a worker becomes an owner, he/she may perform better at the job in hopes that it can have a positive effect on the stock price. Also, having an employee share holder who doesn't plan on selling the stock anytime soon provides support against share prices dropping. Managements at most companies are in favor of doing what they can to prevent share prices from dropping since they tend to own so many shares of the company they help manage.<br>  <br>  A person may not want to hold stock in the company at which he works because he doesn't think the company is well managed and thinks he can get a greater return on his investment if he puts his money in something other than his company's stock.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	oh, the companies like it because their employees tend to be stable owners who can be counted on vote for management's ideas.<br>  <br>  and, putting too many eggs in one basket is not wise.  you already have your job on the line with  the employer -- why would you want to also bet what little you've saved over the years?  <br>  <br>  one catastrophe [Enron anyone?] could wipe out both job and assets.|`|N9VWMIFxaa	because its going to lose<br>  <br>  If you worked for JP Morgan would you do that?

GJKWgx0Paa	the stock market can be thought of as a voting mechanism.  billions of dollars vote every day on whether they think the future of the economy and individual companies will be the same as today, better than today, or worse than today.<br>  <br>  since the government is in the process of trying to 'change' virtually everything, the markets are unable to reasonably guess whether the future will be better, the same, or worse.  So the prudent thing to do is stay home.<br>  <br>  every serious investor I know sold out about a year ago and, unless he's been playing short sales, has stayed out.<br>  <br>  and we aren't coming back until (1) the picture of the future can be seen with some clarity, and (2) that picture looks good (more profitable).<br>  <br>  in short -- we're waiting.<br>  <br>  you should wait too.  there is no sense in trying to guess if or when some new low is "the" bottom.  that's not critical.  what's critical is knowing the conditions under which your style of investing works and then waiting for those conditions to obviously be present.<br>  <br>  i say obviously because more money is lost trying to jump the gun and get ahead of the wave than you can reasonably hope to gain by doing so.  there'll be enough profit if you wait until the conditions are right.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	As soon as people stop believing everything the media says.

AA10199093	I think it's cool that a.you're paying attention to the news and b. you want to know more about what's going on, so because of that I'm going to explain it to you.  Bernie Madoff is being accused of operating the largest Ponzi scheme ever. Here is how a Ponzi scheme works:<br>  <br>  You want to invest $5.  I tell you that if you give me $5 I can guarantee that it is going to make $10 by next week.  You give me the $5.  The thing is I told your Dad that if he gives me $5, I can guarantee that I'll give him $10 back in two weeks.  What I do, to make you happy is I give you $10, but $5 is from your Dad.  No big deal really as long as new people are constantly giving me money and I time everything out properly.  Now, let's say everyone in this giant pyramid decides they need their money sooner than later because the economy suddenly became terrible.  Well, I can't give everyone their money at once because this investment scheme relies on people giving me money.  So when you and your Dad say, "How come we can't have our money back!"  The whole scam is revealed.   Now instead of $5 and $10 amounts, imagine this going on with millions and billions of dollars!  Incredible right?  So that's basically what happened.|`|HSa041M0aa	I was just trying to explain it to my youngest son...PONZI aka Pyramid scheme is where you just get more and more people to invest, but the money is not actually invested-the money earned is from new people who get suckered into the scheme.  You say -give me 100 dollars and I will give you 150 back; now you have to find someone to invest anywhere from 50-150, with the new money u pay me minus my "brokerage" fee. now I can either reinvest, but either way you need new people coming in to keep the whole thing going.  Amway, Mary Kay, Prepaid Legal are a few companies that sort of operate this way.|`|WA80AAipaa	he did something called a ponzie scheme where he gets money from some people by promising to give them more back in return but uses the money he gets from other people to pay them and it expands and expands until there are too many people to pay and it falls apart

A job is still just a job; it is the right time to become a small business owner. It is best when a company pays residual income, (something you get paid for over and over.)  The industry or product is a good way to measure your success. Make sure it's something people will always need. Even a good business will have a small startup cost. I wouldn't mess with ones that have a high investment.

fa0bd4ad078c3cf1e9535d19710798bdaa	You can't just become a producer, you have to have experience in all aspects of the industry - programming, designing, testing etc, to even come close to becoming a producer, and then you need to have a good reputation. You should think about what specific area you actually want to go into, are you a naturally talented artist/designer?  or are you very good at maths and programming? Most jobs in the industry require you to be either a designer or programmer. If neither of these areas are right for you then you could go into marketing, but that wont involve making games, just making adverts and publicity for the games that other people have made. Testing games doesn't pay very well, and is usually what newbies to the industry start doing to show interest and get some experience. So for now I would try and get some testing work - even voluntary testing work if you wish to get a head start - this way if you go on to do a gaming course in college you can say that you have been a tester for the last few years (which will look good). Ultimately you need to know what you will be best at - designing or programming.

I get tons of experience each day actually reading data from ambulatory heart monitors.  However a tech at the hospital here generally just literally performs the test.  That's probably why they make about $4-5 less an hour than I do lol.  With the right company, if you're really good at it, you can make good money, but frankly, I wouldn't count on it.  I happened to get my certificate as part of another program, but I wouldn't have ever bothered to pay for it and try to get a job based on that alone.  There just aren't a ton of jobs out there, when hospitals and other medical facilities have tons of staff already trained to perform and read EKG tests when they were in other programs such as a PAramedic or Nursing program.  Having an EKG certificate alone isn't nearly as likely to get you a job.

5Af6j1qsaa	When library books are past due a certain number of days, they are flagged as "lost".  The computer will then charge you the cost of the book plus a processing fee (to order a new copy and prepare it for the book shelves).  Note that many libraries are lazy and will not enter the book's price when it is initially processed.  Because of this, the computer system will charge the default price.  Thus, you might have a $5 paperback book, but they might charge you the price of a $30 hardcover book.<br>  <br>  Once the total amount reaches a set limit (e.g., $50), they will send the account to collection.  Thus, if you have two $5 paperback books that they are charging you for at default prices along with $15 processing fees, your balance might be $30+$15+$30+$15=$90, thus putting you over the collection limit).<br>  <br>  The collection agency is usually a specialized collection agency which specializes in library materials.  In this case, they will probably send two letters and/or make two telephone calls to try and collect the fees.  At this time, the patron's credit hasn't been affected (the collection hasn't been reported to the credit bureaus).<br>  <br>  If the library card is yours (a teen card), the collection agency won't report the account to a credit bureau anyway (but the library staff will pretend that it will go on the parent's credit report so that the family will want to pay the balance).<br>  <br>  This is what you should do.  When you bring your books in, do not return them to the front desk.  They do not have the power to negotiate with you (they have the ability to lower the fines, but unless you're friends with them, they'll just send you to the librarian).  Instead, bring your books to the reference desk.  Usually only librarians will be at the reference desk, and they are the only ones that can negotiate with you.  Explain to the librarian that the books are late, and you would like to know if the price can be lowered.  (If you can find a price of the book, and you were overcharged, you might want to mention this as well.)  When the books are returned, the computer will remove the processing fees.  The default price (or the price of the book) will be reduced to simply whatever the late fines are for the book (unless the late fines cost more).  The librarian will then usually cut the fines exactly in half.<br>  <br>  If your city's library system has numerous branches, you might want to call around to different branches and ask for the reference desk.  Explain your situation and see if the librarian would be willing to cut you a deal.  If so, remember the librarian's name (and hopefully they will have added a note to your record specifying the deal).  Branches in poorer neighborhoods are more likely to be more forgiving.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	yeah, go ahead and start paying it off at the library.

We charge a $60 replacement fee if a book is not returned by a certain time, so if you return the book, your fine will most likely be reduced. It could be a lot less than that $101. After you see how much they want, you can decide what actions to take. And your parents will feel that you're acting responsibly if you take it back and try to figure it out on your own. If you still don't have enough, offer to do chores or something to get the money from them to pay for it.

BoAEgaAGaa	There will be no new stimulus check for working taxpayers in 2009.   For approximately 95% of America’s working families, their refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and up to $800 for working couples will be paid through a reduction of income tax withholdings (in other words, an increased paycheck). The reduced withholding is scheduled to start no later than April 1 of this year.  <br>  <br>  There will be a one-time payment of $250 to retirees and disabled individuals receiving certain Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Railroad Retirement benefits, and veterans' benefits. This payment will automatically be made to the appropriate individuals by the government. Retired government workers who do not receive Social Security benefits will be eligible to claim a $250 tax credit on their 2009 tax return. <br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA10469473	You can't find info about another stimulus check because there isn't one.

Are you doing it to increase your comfort, lower your utility/long term costs, boost your status in the neighborhood or are you looking to put money into it to sell it?<br>  The answer to those questions will help you decide.<br>  New vinyl windows will increase your comfort, lower your costs, make your house look good and help it to sell.  Its the only money I can think of that does all of those things.  Maybe a new roof, if you need one.<br>  Knocking out new windows is comparatively expensive, and unless you have a spectacular view where now you have a wall, probably not going to give you any return.  Also- like the above poster, it can get out of hand- just think of the multitude of things that can go wrong.  My DH worked for a window contractor- trust me a GC is going to fleece you.<br>  <br>  If someone dumped 11,000 in my lap, I'd spend about 2K tightening up things- make sure the roof is tip top, get some super grass seed, finish up some concreting projects, insulate better, new front door, some landscaping...  But the rest of it I'd put into non-taxable municipal bonds, or some of the bargain basement blue chips...  Yes, the market is in the toilet, but the best time to buy is when everyone wants to sell.  There's still risk in it, but you pick a company that's going to be around and produces something people buy because they have to and you minimize that.  Casket makers, food producers, toilet paper...  You buy and hold...  ten years from now, are you going to think- damn- I should have put in that vinyl picket fence?  Or damn- those DRIPS were a good idea?

So you can buy low, forget about them, and sell high later whenever your ready as their aren't any maintenance fees.

And if their are any problems their just a 10min drive away.<br>  And forget about e-trades $10+ per trade.

CL9zXIA7aa	He's not filing personal bankruptcy. He has been filing bankruptcies for many of his failed businesses. Lesson to be learned here, don't do business with the creep as he'll typically screw you.|`|2HKSwHkSaa	This time around, Donald Trump does not own any of the Casinos that are listed in the bankruptcy filing.  These are owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc.  His name is still associated with the building, but Trump himself no longer has any involvement with them.   <br>  <br>  As for continuing to file bankruptcy, I don't get how some companies can emerge and start spending even more money. Like in 2004 when Kmart, whom had just declared bankruptcy, bought Sears.   I guess with the restructuring that is offered to corporations through Chapter 11, they can shed their debt to continue operating.  A fire cry from most of the consumers who would file, who are left with nothing with creditors beating down their door.   Alas, unless you are big business, it appears as though not many care about the "little" guy.|`|m5eHZvPfaa	It's not about how much money you have, its about how much debt you have and your willingness and or ability to even pay it back.

Perhaps he's simply the kind of guy who likes to keep his own money, who knows unless we see his financial record books.<br>  <br>  This goes for both personal filings or business/corporate filings.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Easy, if you owe more then you can pay then you use corporate bankruptcy to wipe your debts clean.

fqycKwuQaa	The best credit card will be a card that has no annual fee, low rates and give you rewards when you use that card, a good example would be Discover card rewards or American Express these cards have these benefits but the only thing is that you have to have some credit to get these cards other wise you will be turn down, so if you have no credit history your best bet is to start off with a lower end card and use it for a few months to build credit and then apply for a higher end card, but if you have good credit I would apply for the higher end cards now, check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com here you are able to compare them side by side on rates, fees and rewards and credit status, good luck|`|MoUtk7cUaa	watchout for the preditory lenders like citibank, bank america, household bank, etc.  read the terms carefully, especially the apr and monthy rate in addition to the penalties for over the limit and late payment.  if you can get a rate below 10% and it's not just an introductory offer thatgoes to 24.95%, it's not a bad choice.  be very careful w/ credit.<br>  also, you can get a debit card that is used just like a credit card but w/ a visa/mc logo, everywhere takes them and you don't have to worry about credit, it's your money you're spending, not someone elses you have to pay back.  ask you bank.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	First pull your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com<br>  (go to the bottom of the page and click on the "no thank you...

Stop. Do not keep applying for credit cards because every hard inquiry into your credit report drops your score even more.<br>  <br>  Instead save up some money, deposit it into your savings account and ask your bank for a secured credit card. They will freeze the money in your savings account and issue you a card with the same amount as a credit limit. This is a real card (not loaded with your money).<br>  <br>  Only use this card up to 10% of it's limit in a month and then pay off the balance in full immediately when you get your bill. Do this for about one year and then ask the bank to issue you an unsecured card.<br>  <br>  The secured card needs to report to the credit bureaus so that you establish a payment history and your FICO score rises. When it reaches the score you need for an unsecured card you can apply for it with your bank. They will give you back your collateral money and then turn your secured card into an unsecured card because you have proven to them that you can handle credit.|`|vULSEVq6aa	well.. you can always get a gas card, like i personally, have a citgo or a tom thumb gas card..its a credit card, you can get one of those,  i think the intro rate though is like 24.99-29.99% apr but it doesnt take that long if you show your faithful in paying the amount off each month.<br>  also amex/american express is another good cc but not to many normal places accept amex. more master/visa cards. ..just my opnion though hope i have helped.|`|WkbEAvZPaa	Make sure you're careful with your credit.<br>  <br>  I recommend American Express or Discover.

The thing is, as you sign up for offers, they will constantly make it sound like you’re almost done, when in reality you have to sign up for so much stuff that you will probably give up. <br>  In the event you do make it over all the hurtles required for the computer (assuming this is even possible) you may have spent money in excess of the price of the computer. And you may notice they don’t say when they will send you. The ipod guys I mentioned have been accused never sending out ipods at all.

My realtor advises that this alone dropped the value of my house by $10k, and that it will be that much more difficult for me to sell now :(|`|m45R3s5Daa	the government is only working with freddie mac and fannie mae loans. if you have one of those, you can refi.<br>  but call your bank and see. it never hurts to talk.

If you pick up a skill for woodwork, I always love those little figurines carved from wood!<br>  <br>  If you decide you don't want crafts, there are things like baking sales or hand-me-down clothing at my town's farmer markets. Then again, we have about four-hundred people in our town lol :)|`|9omqVnjkaa	if its outdoors in a warm climate, smoothies always make alot of money.

T57y1bfPaa	I think you should mention it to you boss/employer very politely and explain why you feel you deserve the raise (you have taken on new responsibilities and work very hard, etc). If your boss says 'No' then don't argue and continue to work hard without mentioning it again. If he/she sees you working hard they may bring it up and you could get the raise. It's all about being polite.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes, you should ask for a raise..|`|su37vnIXaa	they arent gonna give you a raise!!|`|U6CF0Gh0aa	I think you should sit tight for the time being, and reassess this when you're eligible in 15 months. By then, it's possible that the economy will be somewhat better, and you'll have even more tangible proof of the accomplishments you've made with your new responsibilities. When you're eligible in 15 months, I'd say go for it! It sounds like you're working harder than you had originally thought you would, and you deserve to be compensated for that work!|`|Xa7TaXDRaa	yes. definitely at least a bonus until you are "eligible" for a raise.  If that's not possible because of timing then work something out with some benefit or service...maybe your boss can just pay for your lunch everyday.  things get worked out like that all the time.  of course its not good if your boss hates you, before you talk about it that is.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	If you feel you deserve a raise, go ahead and ask for one. Good luck.|`|F8UVorfPaa	It is only you who can truly answer your question.
XHhJ8ffRaa	You are not serious right? Whatever you are studying, obviously you are not good at it. This question can't get any easier. I'll tell you it's not c.

He files his own return for his income.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	If you provided more than half his support/expenses and he lived with you, go ahead.  It gets a bit trickier after he turns 18|`|BoAEgaAGaa	As long as he did not pay over 1/2 of his own support and lived with your for over 6 months, you are able to claim him as a dependent.  See page 27 of the Pub 17 I have linked below.  You will have all the same benefits for claiming him as you have had in the past, except you will not receive the child tax credit if he turned 17 before the end of 2008.  <br>  <br>  He will then be able to file an income tax return indicating he is able to be claimed as a dependent by someone else.  If all his income is from wages reported on a W-2, and the total is under $5450, he will receive a refund of all the federal income tax he had withheld.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	He can still have Child Benefit, EMA and you can have working tax credit if he was in education for enough hours even though he had a part time job.|`|80II1Wv1aa	You can claim him so long as he lives with you and doesn't pay you any rent.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	And what??? If he is still living at home with you then yes you can.|`|0uWqjL2raa	You can claim your son on your taxes if he lived with you and he did not provide over half of his own support.  He is your dependent.  He can file his taxes to get his withholding back.  He will enter that he is being claimed on someone else return.  He will not get his $3500 exemption but will get the $5450 standard deduction.  He will  only pay taxes on the amount over the $5450.<br>  <br>  <br>  Christine EA Master Tax Advisor<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/tax_professionals/christine_wilkins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrblock.com/tax_professionals...</a>|`|ASXeYOjAaa	and . . . ?<br>  didn't live with you?<br>  earned more than you?<br>  died in a workplace tragedy?<br>  <br>  Based on the information you provided: You either can or cannot claim him as a dependent.

RNqRnG86aa	The IRS will allow a capital loss for a security that becomes worthless. Check with your accountant to see at what point you can consider your investment worthless. You will not be able to offset the entire investment in one year unless you have capital gains that equal or exceed your capital loss.<br>  <br>  Capital losses are used first to offset capital gains. If there are no capital gains, or if the capital losses are larger than the capital gains, you can deduct the capital loss against your other income — up to a limit of $3,000 in one year. If your overall capital loss is more than $3,000, the excess carries over to the next year. In other words, you treat the extra portion as if it were an additional capital loss in the following year.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	You can't write off the loss until the business folds, or you sell your ownership in it at a loss.
