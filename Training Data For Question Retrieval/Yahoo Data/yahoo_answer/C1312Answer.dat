The middle 2 are numbers (6th and 7th) are 28 and 34.      Where you have an even number of numbers in a median, you should quote the centremost 2 numbers then state the mean of these, so its 28 and 34 (mean is (28+34)/2 = 62/2 =31)
tij4Mojuaa	The liver forms bile, when stimulated by the hormone Secretin. Bile can then be stroed in the Gall bladder.     Glucose regulation also takes place in the liver - if their is too much glucose in the blood, the hormone insulin speeds up the rate at which glucose is taken into the liver and muscle cells from the blood. In the liver, insulin activates an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of glucose into glycogen which can be stored in the liver until more glucose is needed in the body.    Excess amino acids can't be stored in the body, thereforethey must be removed. The deamination of amino acids takes place in the liver. This removes the amino group, converting it to a nitrogenous waste product, and forming a keto acid from the remander of the molecule. Keto acids can then be fed into Krebs cycle and respired to release energy.     Not sure on detoxification im afraid - google it!

XgcwFyHLaa	No, and the following scientific explanation will cover why.    First of all, Eris is just considered a large snow ball on a path that never takes it near the sun.    Under the newly defined categories to be a planet, Eris fares poorly. It has an irregular orbit that is crossed by thousands of other asteroids and comets  (In other words, it hasn't been able to clear its orbital path as the classical planets have done. For example, Jupiter's gravity organizes the Asteroid belt and Troyan asteroid fields in a possition that keeps these objects out of its orbital path)    Also, just because it has a moon doesnt mean it has to be a planet. it is well documented that many asteroids have smaller asteroids orbiting them. That has been observed for many decades.    Also, Eries is smaller and its composition is radically different than the size and compossition of the 4 inner rocky planets and the moon, and of the 4 large gas giants.    Eris' composition is consistent with that of the other objects in the Kuiper belt    Also, its plane of orbit differs from that of the 8 classical planets. The plane of orbit for the 8 planets is ligned up to within one degree from each other, this is due to the fact that they formed together from the same nebular cloud and at the same time.    In fact, Eris' orbital path is so highly eccentric, it gets as close as   37.8 AU from the Sun , However, this is  still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (at ~30 AU). For comparison, Pluto, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, it can cross Neptunes orbit without being affected by its gravity.(Will end it here because am getting too sidetracked and started talking about Pluto. Hope this helps)|`|jwvKTPQvaa	No, if we consider it a planet we would have to include around 15 other objects as planets.  Eris is the largest dwarf planet we know of, so it and planets smaller (ie Pluto) than it have been grouped seperately.|`|f2b6d8aa39507900c3d4c0785edd85bbaa	no, due to size|`|lO0keUAUaa	No.    I'm not too fussed either way but I'm happy to go with the planet definition voted by the IAU in August 2006.  Had the original proposal got up then Eris would officially be a planet, along with Pluto, Charon and Ceres.  Stating a definition is in any event hardly going to settle the issue, many people will no doubt continue to hold to their own views.  Hopefully we'll continue to learn more about what's "out there" and thus have a better basis for coming up with categories for objects.

To be precise, the electric flux through a surface is the integral over that surface of E dot dA (where E and dA are vectors--dA is normal to the surface).    Somewhat bad analogy: if the E-field were like a pressure, the flux would be like a force.    Electric flux shows up in Ampere's equation, which is one of Maxwell's equations.|`|thxBapOCaa	Bekki B is right, Electric flux is the integral of the Electric field vector over some surface with area A.       Picture a flowing river. Now picture placing a hulahoop in the river so that it is perpendicular to the current. The "amount" of water flowing through the holahoop is analagous to electric flux. Now imagine rotating the hulahoop a little so it is no longer perpendicular to the current. less water will be going through it. You have just changed the flux. A similiar change in the flux of a magnetic field produces a current in a conductor. Thats how generators work!|`|n4c6Rrqvaa	electric flux means transferring electricity to other homes|`|mCkN4sNzaa	This is the most important question.....    make ure concepts clearwith the article i am typing.........    Electric Flux is a measure of the number of field lines passing through an area.     If we define area as a vector, with its direction perpendicular to the surface, the electric flux is given by:     FE = E  A = E A cos(theeta)     where q is the angle between the electric field and the area vector.     The more field lines pass through the area, the larger the flux.      i have specially made a demonstration site  ....to understand flux....    go here........    http://webphysics.davidson.edu/physlet_r...

gbsWK3Azaa	First, Civil Engineering design structures that will move during an earthquake (or wind); however, the structures are design for not suffering structural damage (if you are in the top of a sky-scrapper you can feel how the building moves during strong winds or an earthquake).    Well, since Seismology studies earthquakes and its effects (like tsunamis), it provides information about the intensity of seismic activity which can be correlated to the effect in existing structures. This way, design and construction codes can be updated accordingly, for instants, after every major earthquake and after analyzing the intensity, the effects, and the codes used on the affected structures, new codes are released.    Summarizing, Seismology continuously provides vital information used by Civil Engineers to design safer structures.|`|MlmAnnTyaa	http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/GSHAP/    The seismic hazard map gives the features of the earthquake in a specific area. They keep records of all produced earthquakes in one area and then state: the probability of an earthquake with intensity larger than "x" to produce in this area in 10 (or  50 or 100 etc.) years is almost zero.       There are more than one seismic design codes. I only know the one in my country and some of the European seismic design code Eurocode 8.  Basically we approximate the effects of the earthquake to a force applied at the base of the building. The force depends on the type of structure you want to design (concrete, steel etc.), on the earthquake features in the area, on  the importance of the building (hospital>apartment building>warehouse), on the weight of the building ....  We have to think about the most unfavorable situation so we combine this force with other forces (resulting from self-weight, live load, wind load, snow load etc.) in a specific way.  The nowadays design implies structural modeling in a computer program, making it easier to find the maximum effects of these these critical load combinations. The final design step will make sure that the structure will resist at least to these maximum effects.  The problem appears if an earthquake with bigger effects than the ones predicted in the Seismic Hazard Map produces.

ROzZoBQuaa	Restriction enzymes cut in specific spot of the DNA, as you may know.    If you already know the sequence of your plasmid, you can select restriction enzymes which will cut in known regions.    If you dont, then pick as many as you can, and run the rxns one at a time.  Then run a gel electrophoresis on cut and uncut DNA to see how many fragments you get per enzyme and their sizes.  You will then know how many restriction sites there are, although that may not be as useful for characterizing the plasmid as sequencing it would.  I recommend you purify your plasmid DNA with montage plates and then send it in for sequencing.  Remember to prepare a stock in E. Coli for when you may need more DNA.|`|aiYkMg7faa	It depends on whether there is only one type of plasmid or not as to how I would attack this problem.    If there is only one type, the job is easier.  Some simple maths will help you solve it more quickly than just using random enzymes.    1. Find out what the AC content is (% wise).  2. If it's more A than C, use a restriction enzyme that depend more on AT than on CGs, otherwise do the reverse.  3. Use REs that only cut 4 base sequences (or something small).  Leave the long ones alone.    However, if there is more than one type of plasmid, you will need to run double digests per sample to see which plasmid you cut (ie. 1 + 3 in 1 tube, 1 + 2 in another, etc.)    Good luck    Robyn

For the 6 and the 1, the distance in 5 and you keep going down, so the y value is -4 and you take 5 from 1, so the answer is (-4,-4)

As part of your summer job at the Cooly Cooler Company you've taken it upon yourself to convince the Product Manager that the standard portable cooler can be more efficiently designed.  You've decided to demonstrate the differences in surface areas for 3 different designs.     The designs you will compare and contrast are:   1.    Square-based rectangular prism   2.    Cylinder   3.    Combination sphere and cylinder     Spreadsheets and graphs will be used to determine and demonstrate the dimensions of each design that will give a minimum surface area for a cooler with a volume of 50 L.     Reasons for choosing the design with the minimum surface area must be discussed with specific references made to the volume/surface area ratio.     A rendering of the design of choice must be complete with any and all additions that will make the design functional and user friendly.     Ideas for future, more efficient designs may be discussed to strengthen your design choice.     All information must be presented in the form of a report.  Include a cover page, page of contents, introductory letter to Product Manager, spreadsheets and graphs with explanation of mathematics used, reasons for specific choice and a rendering of the design.  This rendering can be drawn, computer generated, built, etc.         Hope your project works out.  Ur welcome

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    If there are 4 events in a sample space, each of them can occur or can not occur. That means there are 4 decisions, each of which can occur or not occur.That means there are 2^4 or 16 possibilities. Out of the 16, there could be:    1 way out of 16 that all 4 events would occur.  4 ways out of 16 that 3 of 4 events would occur.  6 ways out of 16 that 2 of 4 events would occur.  4 ways out of 16 that 1 of 4 events would occur.  1 way out of 16 that none of 4 events would occur.    These numbers come from finding the number of combinations of 4 events, taken 0,1,2,3, or 4 at a time. (4nCr0, 4nCr1, 4nCr2, 4nCr3, 4nCr4)    The probability that no three of the events can occur at the same time would be 1 + 4 + 6 or 10 out of 16 times or 5/8.     I hope that helps!!

Es muy raro que se presenten en una sola placenta.|`|LI7toJNlaa	Los octillizos    si, casi te puedo asegurar que este hecho se presento por fertilizacion artificial, o sea, a la mujer le dan algo para ovular y luego en los dias fertilez se fecunda el o los ovulos, por que te digo esto, por que por esta razon es que se dan los multipartos y como cada bebe se genera de un solo ovulo ste contiene su propia placenta y su propio cordon humbilical.    Si fueran octizillos identicos...es una sola placenta y varios cordones conectados a esa placenta. El unico detalle seria que 8 espermatozoides fecundaran un solo ovulo, que esta dificil.    saludos|`|LRlrSXl9aa	TIPO CHORIZOS.....

RxukJqL5aa	By contradiction, let d>1 divide both ab and a+b.  Then d has a prime divisor p, which divides both ab and a+b.    Then p divides a(a+b) - ab = a^2  Since p is a prime which divides a*a, we have that p divides a.    And p divides b(a+b) - ab = b^2  Similarly, p divides b.    Hence p divides a and p divides b, so p divides gcd(a,b) = 1.  However, this forces p = 1, which is a contradiction, since 1 isn't a prime.    Thus the only positive common divisor of ab and a+b is 1, which shows they are coprime.|`|rjRpQa26aa	In mathematics, the integers a and b are said to be coprime or relatively prime if they have no common factor other than 1 and -1, or equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1.    For example, 6 and 35 are coprime, but 6 and 27 are not because they are both divisible by 3. The number 1 is coprime to every integer; 0 is coprime only to 1 and ?1.    A fast way to determine whether two numbers are coprime is given by the Euclidean algorithm.      The numbers a and b are coprime if and only if there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1 (see Bzout's identity). Equivalently, b has a multiplicative inverse modulo a: there exists an integer y such that by  1 (mod a). In fancy language: a and b are coprime if and only if b yields a unit in the ring Za of integers modulo a.    As a consequence, if a and b are coprime and br  bs ( mod a), then r  s (mod a) [because we may "divide by b" when working modulo a]. Furthermore, if a and b1 are coprime, and a and b2 are coprime, then a and b1b2 are also coprime [because the product of units is a unit].    If a and b are coprime and a divides a product bc, then a divides c.    The two integers a and b are coprime if and only if the point with coordinates (a, b) in an Cartesian coordinate systemCartesian means relating to the French mathematician and philosopher Descartes, who, among other things, worked to merge algebra and Euclidean geometry. This work was influential to the development of analytic geometry, calculus, and cartography. The idea is "visible" from the origin (0,0), in the sense that there is no point with integer coordinates between the origin and (a, b).    The probability derives from the Latin probare (to prove, or to test). Informally, probable is one of several words applied to uncertain events or knowledge, being more or less interchangeable with likely risky hazardous uncertain and doubtful depend that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/2 (see piOr pi with a lower-case p . minuscule, or lower-case, pi The mathematical constant (written as pi when the Greek letter is not available) is ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. In Euclidean plane geometry,  may be defined as either the ratio of a c).    Two natural numbers can mean either a positive integer ( 1, 2, 3, 4,. or a non-negative integer ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,. Natural numbers have two main purposes: they can be used for counting ("there are 3 apples on the table"), or they can be used for ordering ("thiss a and b are coprime if and only if the numbers 2a ? 1 and 2b ? 1 are coprime.

If they have similar polarity they would dissolve - EtAc/acetone - dipole-dipole. dichlormethane is not polar enough so the miscibility would be lower, and hexane is not polar at all, so the miscibility would be low.

L3uK9hjzaa	Differentiate the top and bottom, giving    (2sin2x - sinx)/(e^x - 1). Differentiate again, since the singularity at x = 0 is still there:    (4cos2x - cosx)/(e^x). Set x = 0, giving    [4*cos(0) - cos(0)]/(1) = 4*1 - 1 = 3. So    lim x--> 0 [(cosx - cos2x)/(e^x -1- x)] = 3. Feel free to verify this using a calculator, your procedure may have had a couple of errors.    **********    Edit: Sorry! I missed your second problem. Just use the definition of the derivative using limits:    d/dx(f(x)) = lim x -> 0 [f(x+x) - f(x) / x ]. Substituting for x (from here on out the limit is implied, because typing it insistently is annoying =P)    [ (x+x) - (x) ] / x. Multiply by (x+x) + (x), giving    [ x + x - x ] / [ x * ((x+x) + (x)]. Both x's on the top cancel (I think you messed up with your signs, if I'm reading your edit correctly), and x's cancel on the top and bottom so you get    1/ [ (x+x) + (x) ]. Taking the limit as x -> 0,    1 / [(x) + (x)] = 1/[2x]. So,     f'(x) = 1/[2x].|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	Yes, the limit is 0. L'Hospital is always right.    f(x) = sqrt(x)  f(x+h) = sqrt(x+h)  lim h --> 0 [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h  = lim h -->0 [sqrt(x+h) - sqrt(x)]/h  Now multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(x+h) +sqrt(x). Then simplify and take the limit.

Slope is rise/run so -1/5 would be down one and to the right five. The y intercept is the y coordinate at which the graph crosses the y axis. So -2 would be (0, -2) for the y intercept.    1. slope -1/5, y intercept -2  2. slope -5/1, y intercept -1  3. slope -7/1, y intercept 3    Another way one can go about solving these linear graph equations is by using a table. To do so, you would plug in numbers for x and then solve for y. It is recommended to use lower numbers, for they are easier to solve. The number you plug into x is the x coordinate, and the number you get when you solve for y is the y coordinate. So the point would be (x,y).  You solve for at least 3 points and draw a straight line through  the points because this is a linear equation.|`|Rtkz8IeTaa	y=Ax+B    A=slope     B=point on the y axis

Bonding results in a sharing of electrons so that the orbitals of the bonded atoms are full. when the p and s orbitals are full the electron has what is called the noble gas shell, which is very stable. The noble gases are so stable that they very rarely react. When the octet is full then the atom is at the lowest energy and most stable. A full sextet will result in either a partially full p orbital and a full s orbital or an empty s orbital and a full p orbital. Note: O (g) (not O2 (g)) has a sextet. However, it is very unstable, and will quickly react into the more stable O2 which has an octet.

Then find the determinant of this, which for a matrix [a b / c d] is a*d - b*c. expand the equation (t-1)*(t-1) - 2 in a polynomial. this is the characteristic equation.    now to find the roots of this polynomial equation set it equal to zero and the possible values of t are your eigenvalues.    Now to find the eigenvectors insert each t value one at a time into t*I - A, the matrix [ t-1 -2 / -2 t-1 ]. Now find the nullspace of the two resulting matrices from the two t values. That is, set it equal to zero and row reduce and find the nonzero general solutions. To normalize them, multiply each component of the respective vectors by 1/length of each respective vector. These nonzero general solutions are the eigenvectors. My source on kernels of matrices shows you how to find nullspaces if you like. I included a row reduction source as well.    Take the dot product (source included). I'm not sure what they will come out to be but if the dot pruduct is zero then these two eigenvectors are orthonormal, due to the fact that we normalized them.    hope this helps..  cheers

Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, in the same sequence, but they may not have the same alleles in those genes (determined by the sequence of nucleotides).  For example, if your mother was homologous for brown eyes, and your father was homologous for blue eyes, you would have one gene for blue eyes and one gene for brown eyes.

"Sea Floor Spreading is the process by which plate tectonics produces new oceanic lithosphere. Typical rates of spreading average around 5 centimeters per year. These rates are slow on a human time scale. However, they are rapid so that all of Earth's ocean basins could have been generated within the last 200 years..."|`|DoqmSFiZaa	Sea-floor spreading is the process in which the ocean floor is extended when two plates move apart.  As the plates move apart, the rocks break and form a crack between the plates.  Earthquakes occur along the plate boundary.

On the whole, sea-floor spreading is basically volcanic, but it is a slow and regular process, without the explosive outbursts of the volcanoes on land.     - TrayaBaya-   Deuces.

EbxMItf8aa	This is a real head-scratcher.  I was convinced at first that there was not enough information here to get a definitive answer, since we are not told the speed at which either the escalator, or Jess, ascends.  However, by making an assumption (which does not appear to be justified because it is not stated in the question) an answer does pop out in the end.    Suppose that the escalator has S steps.  The assumption which I make is that the escalator ascends at the rate of 1 step per second, so that it takes S seconds for one step to travel from the bottom to the top.    Suppose that Jess walks up the escalator at the rate of n steps per second.    Then the combined speed of ascent is  (n + 1) steps /sec    So Jess will reach the top in S / (n + 1) sec.    Now, in { S / (n + 1) } sec, the escalator rises S / (n + 1) steps.    And in {S / (n + 1) } sec, Jess takes  n x S / (n + 1) steps.    And we are given that  n x S / (n + 1)  =  54 ..... ..... ..... ..... (A)  -------------- --------------- -------------------- -----------------------    Now, if Jess walks at only ? n steps per sec,    The combined speed of ascent is (? n + 1) steps/sec    So Jess now reaches the top in { S / (? n + 1) } sec    Re-arranging this a little, time to reach top =  { 3S / (2n + 3) } sec.    In   3S / (2n + 3) sec, escalator rises   3S / (2n + 3) steps    And Jess takes (? n) (3S / (2n + 3) ) steps, which  =  6Sn / 3 (2n + 3) steps.    We are told that  6Sn / 3 (2n + 3)  =  40 ..... ..... ..... ..... (B)    From equation (A) above, we get  Sn = 54 (n + 1)    From (B) we get  6Sn  =  40 (2n + 3) 3, or  Sn  =  20 (2n + 3)    If we equate these two expressions for Sn, we get    54 (n + 1)  =  20 (2n + 3)    54n + 54  =  40n + 60    (54 - 40)n  =  60 - 54    14n  =  6    Therefore  n  =  3 / 7    And substituting in  Sn = 54 (n + 1)    S (3 / 7)  =  54 ( 3 / 7  + 1)    S (3 / 7)  =  54 x 10 / 7    3S  =  540    Therefore S = 180    The escalator has 180 steps.    ------------- ---------------- ------------------- ------------------    So, still assuming that the escalator ascends at 1 step per second, it will take 180 sec. for a step to travel from the bottom to the top.    If Jess takes 3 steps in 7 seconds, that is at the rate of 3 / 7 step per sec,    then his rate of ascent will be  1 + (3 / 7) steps per sec, and he will get to the top in  180 / (10 / 7)  =  126 seconds.    In 126 seconds, the escalator rises 126 steps, and Jess takes  126 x (3 / 7) steps  =  54 steps.    And similarly, if he walks at ? (3 / 7) steps per second, he gets to the top in 140 seconds  havintg taken 40 steps.    Everything checks out, but I am still a little surprised by it.    It works because time, or speed, does not appear in the answer at all.  Although I assumed a unit of time of 1 second, I could just as well have assumed a speed for the escalator of 1 step per 2 seconds, or 1 step per 0.5 seconds, or anything else.    It is rare to come across a problem that I have not seen before, and this is a new one to me.  An interesting mental workout !
XQjr3twdaa	Very interesting one.  I looked for a long time for a clever trick, but didn't find one.  This proof is a bit brute force.    First, we can show there are no solutions with x = -1, x=0 or x=1.    x = -1 ==> (-1)^(y+2) = 2009/5  obvious never  x=0 ==> 1^y = 2009 obviously never  x=1 ==> 2^y = 2004, nope.    Next consider y    Next consider x>=2.  Both terms will be positive, so   2009 > 5*x^(y+2) >= 5 * 2^(y+2)  which says y     Using the lower bound 1, we upper bound x as   5*x^3     So now you have a small finite range of possible solutions for (x>0):  1  2    That's small enough to just try them all.      The only remaining detail now is x|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	This equation 5*x^(y+2) + (x+1)^y blows up pretty fast for even small positive integer x, y, so starting with x = 1, the largest y for which this is less than 2009 is 10.  Then for x = 2, y = 6, where it is exactly 2009.  For x = 3, y = 3.  For x = 4, y = 2.  For x = 5, y = 1.  And that's it.  There aren't that many values to even try, and only for x = 2, y = 6 does the expression come anywhere near 2009.

Then when you say that then you think how can something not be in something else. Because if its not, then what is outside it. Everywhere we look there is not one bit of nothing. There is always something happening in every point of space we've looked at. Then again space is a thing it self, and it ends. What is it called when there is no space. Nothing? But nothing is still something, so when does nothing end. Another universe? Then we are in something after all. Then is there universes in this universe.

Both values are conceptual and by no means absolute, or natural. There is no point to try and define the end of an endless equation, just know in a calculation using I, there is no out of limits result. As far as being able to conceive it's value, you have to place it in context, such as how any nonlinear 3 points define a plane who's edges are infinite, that means it spreads out past all scales of conception. One approach to a Grand Unified Theory of matter implies that our entire Universe is just one of many universal bubbles which are frothing about like a pot boiling over. Now imagine that pot, each bubble spilling out an entire universe unto itself, well your 3 nonlinear dots defining a plane go past all that. Infinity is just a big number.

First, rewrite the equation in terms of y:    9x - 4y = - 8  - 4y = - 9x - 8  y = (9/4)x + 2    m1 = 9/4    The slope of a perpendicuar line has slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line.    m2 = - (1 / m1)  m2 = - (1 / 9/4)  m2 = - 4/9    Basic equation for perpendicuar line:    y = - 4/9x + b    Passing through (0, 3), solve for b:    b = y - (m2)x  b = 3 - [(- 4/9)(0)]  b = 3 - 0  b = 3    Equation for perpendicular line:    y = - 4/9 x + 3    See graph below:    http://i533.photobucket.com/albums/ee339...|`|OtUozt5raa	9x-4y= -8  -4y= -8-9x         /-4  y=2+9/4x  slope=9/4  negative reciprocal=-4/9  3=-4/9(0)+b  b=3    y= -4/9x+3|`|Zc3sgcTzaa	i would help u if i knew the coordinates... u know maybe if i would understand it.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	First, put the given equation into slope-intercept form    y = -9/4y + 2    Now, "perpendicular" means the slope is inverted and different sign, so the new slope is    4/9    So your equation should be y = 4/9x + b    To solve for b, sub in (0,3)    3 = b    so the final answer should be y=4/9x+3|`|ZPGFY99Laa	well slope-intercept is "y=mx+b" and u need to get that first of all, then u need to know what perpendicular is, so urs in slope intercept is y=(9/4x)+2    Perpendicular to that is  the "negative reciprocal of 'x' " so it would be so far, y=-(4/9x)+b    now b can be anything but 2... so now u find the intercept that also runs through (0,3), but one flaw is, (0,3) is the y intercept so ur answer is     y=-(4/9x)+3|`|GVIduvuNaa	ok so slope intercept is this. y=mx+b  m is the slope, and b is the point where your line intersects with the y axis.     so, put your equation in slope intercept.   9x-4y= -8  -9x        -9x  -4y= -9x-8   put in 0 for x and 3 for y. and solve for b.     -4(3)=-9(0)+b     and solve.|`|mXYGAZHUaa	The answer is y=-4/9x+3.  Srry its kinda hard to type the methood on here.|`|vGloXoCFaa	Alright well first when the slope is perpendicular, that means it's going to opposite signs and the reciprocal (fraction flipped upsidedown). So the slope is going to be -1/9 (the number next to x is the slope).   Next you have to put it in slope intercept form to solve for b (y=mx+b) using the ordered pair (the 1st is x and the 2nd is y) so its  3= -1/9 (0) + b  3=b  so I'm pretty sure the answer is y=-1/9x + 3  (I didn't use paper so I might be wrong)

Au fait pour ceux qui parlent de l'Afrique dans l'Eurasie, on a vite fait de dire qu'il y avait le canal de Suez pour les sparer, ?a a fait un problme en moins avec une excuse merdique...|`|AA10860030	Pour rpondre  ta question, personne n'a fait de l'Europe un contient (donc ni un savant, ni un idiot): la notion de continent n'est pas unamime de part le monde scientifique. De plus suivant que l'on parle de gopolitique ou de gographie, on peut vouloir trouver pratique telle ou telle dfinition.     Le modle  sept continents(Amrique du Nord, Amrique du Sud, Antarctique, Asie, Europe, Afrique, Ocanie)  est souvent utilis en Europe de l'Ouest et en Amrique du Nord. Le modle  six continents (Eurasie) est trs utilis en Amrique du Nord et est le modle de choix pour la communaut scientifique. Enfin, le modle unissant les Amriques est utilis en Europe de l'Est et en Amrique du Sud.|`|7814fd175d137f322eceefef307694d5aa	l'europe est plus un continent gopolitique alors que l'eurasie est un continent gographique.|`|1ed930a971a2bfbf3e628e3570f1d3dbaa	certainement  pas.|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Le mot continent vient du latin continere pour ? tenir ensemble ?, ou continens terra, les ? terres continues ?. Au sens propre, ce terme dsigne une vaste tendue continue de terre  la surface du globe. Dans son acceptation commune, la zone continentale inclut galement les petites ?les  trs faible distance des c?tes, mais non celles spares par des bras de mer significatifs (comme la Corse par rapport au "continent"). D'un point de vue scientifique, les continents incluent galement les ?les rattaches aux plaques continentales, comme les ?les britanniques par rapport  l'Eurasie.    Les parties du Monde sont des continents dans un sens largi. D'une part, toute ?le fait partie d'une partie du Monde puisque les parties du Monde contiennent toutes les terres merges, mais les ?les ne font pas partie des continents (au sens commun, ou au sens scientifique) puisque leur territoire n'est pas continu avec le reste du continent.    Il n'y a pas de dfinition unique d'un continent. C'est pourquoi les cultures et sciences ont des listes diffrentes de continents. En gnral, un continent doit tre une grande tendue, compose de terre ferme avec des limites gologiques significatives. Bien que certains considrent qu'il n'y ait que quatre ou cinq continents, on considre habituellement qu'il y en a six ou sept.    Deux des plus grandes oppositions portent sur l'Europe et l'Asie qui pourraient tre unifies (Eurasie) et sur l'Amrique du Nord et l'Amrique du Sud qui formeraient l'Amrique. Quelques gographes proposent de regrouper l'Europe, l'Asie et l'Afrique en une Eurafrasie.    Le modle  sept continents est souvent utilis en Europe de l'Ouest et en Amrique du Nord. Le modle  six continents (Eurasie) est trs utilis en Amrique du Nord et est le modle de choix pour la communaut scientifique. Enfin, le modle unissant les Amriques est utilis en Europe de l'Est et en Amrique du Sud.    Le drapeau olympique reprsente cinq anneaux entrelacs symbolisant les cinq continents unis par l'esprit olympique. L'Amrique n'est ici considre que comme un unique continent. L'Antarctique n'y est pas compt car ce continent n'est toujours que temporairement habit.    Les ?les sont habituellement considres comme appartenant au continent dont elles sont le plus proche. Par exemple, les Canaries quoique espagnoles sont rattaches  l'Afrique, les Balares font partie de l'Europe et les ?les du Pacifique appartiennent  l'Ocanie.    Les continents sont parfois combins pour donner des supercontinents ou subdiviss pour des sous-continents.|`|215d94030923678f10bae1287f7b1308aa	oui la sparation se fait au dtroit de Bring  l'extrme est de la Sibrie.-...et de l'autre c?t se trouve......l'Alaska....|`|ef5756e3f75bddce7d61fd286feb4953aa	nan ? fait partie du continent "Eurasie" donc les mers polaires au nord, le pacifique au sud est, l'atlantique  l'ouest, etc........

Pour l'amerique, on distingue souvent l'amerique du nord (us+canada) de l'amerique "latine", le rio grande jouant alors le role de frontiere geographique (et la on parle de geographie politique).|`|f09e1664ada840d462265c5da2240f4baa	Aus sens strict du terme tant que les terres se touchent elles font partie du mme continent. Selon cette dfinition l'europe est une partie de l'eurofrasie (europe + afrique + asie).    De plus leufrasie et l'amrique tant reli par les glaces, on peut considrer qu'ils ne forment qu'un continent !    Ce qui fait les continents ce n'est pas seulement la gographie mais aussi l'histoire. C'est pourquoi on a spare le continent en trois parties elles aussi appeles continent.     Considre que ces deux termes sont homonymes, et que dans le langage courant quand on parle de continent on pense au second. Mais tout n'est que question de poiont de vue !

9f866de97b3257b9ae05e1d80706c489aa	En fait, je crois que l'volution de l'Homme dpend de ses choix...     Si l'humanit cherche (dans sa majorit)  s'lever et  se dpasser (comme elle a t oblig de faire pendant son volution pour survivre), alors, l'Homme continuera d'voluer. Certes, aprs les poils et la tailles, d'autres parties de notre anatomie changerons, mais l o l'Homme a encore le plus de marge d'volution, c dans son cerveau.   Ainsi, peut tre serons nous tous connects dans notre conscient comme nous le sommes dans notre inconscient (cf.

Pour vampiloup, c'est trs pertinent ce que tu dis.   Mais perso je crois, pour diffrente raison  l'expansion de l'unvers et aux premiers instant ou tou chauffe en un chaos de quark et particules. Est-ce que la thorie du Big bang actuelle est fausse, certainement, on n'a pas de physique unifie, il est normal de ne pas interprter le monde correctement.

Chercher " expliquer des choses que notre esprit nest pas en mesure de comprendre et de concevoir" est prcisment la raison d'tre des religions et des croyances mystiques.  La science dcrit l'univers tel qu'il est sans chercher  lui donner un sens.  La thorie du Big Bang te gne car elle ne colle pas avec ta vision intuitive de l'univers ou avec tes convictions religieuses ou simplement parce que "ton esprit nest pas en mesure de le comprendre".  Il ne faut pas oublier que cette thorie n'est pas un but mais le rsultat d'une dmarche logique base sur l'observation. Elle ne fait appel  aucune "volont" ou "force extrieure"...    Je ne sais pas si c'est clair...  Mais ton raisonnement se mord la queue.|`|b2cc3d0e96e4bf7a1a66e6b43bf8ba6caa	Non, je n'y crois pas.    La thorie du big bang, et son corrolaire l'expansion universelle, est une thorie assez bancale, parce que :    Elle comporte des valeurs "bouche-trou" qui n'ont aucune existence relle et n'ont d'autre raison d'tre que de faire coller les calculs  la ralit.  En clair, la thorie du Big Bang "prouve" que les poules pondent des oeufs cubiques. Alors on rajoute une "constante de transformation sphrique" qui arrondit les angles des oeufs, et on affirme ensuite devant un partre journalistique ahuri que la gniale thorie du Big bang prvoit des oeufs en forme d'oeufs, et s'accorde donc parfaitement avec les observations.    Elle est modifie aprs chaque observation (en effet, contrairement  une rumeur savamment entretenue, les observations dmentent systmatiquement cette thorie).    Les partisans des autres thories sont interdits d'observatoires. Ce n'est pas quelque chose que l'on rpte dans les journaux, videmment...      Quelques points intressants :    La thorie du Big bang n'a jamais cess de se tromper sur l'age de l'univers, avan?ant une naissance que ses partisans sont sans arrt obligs de revoir  la hausse parce qu'on dcouvre que certains objets sont plus vieux que l'univers prvu par la thorie du Big bang.  Pendant un temps, la thorie du Big bang prvoyait mme que l'univers est plus jeune... que la Terre elle-mme.  De l'aveux mme d'un vieil astrophysicien, on a renon?  compter le nombre de fois o il a fallu rcrire la thorie du Big bang  cause de cela.    Malgr cela, on sait aujourd'hui que l'univers est tellement grand qu'il lui aurait fallu peut-tre des dizaines, voire des centaines de milliards d'annes pour atteindre sa taille actuelle, ce que la thorie du Big Bang ne peut parvenir  prvoir mme patche  mort.  En effet, la thorie dite de l'expansion universelle, partie de celle du Big bang concernant l'poque actuelle, n'arrive  calculer qu'une vitesse de croissance relativement lente grace au fameux "dcalage vers le rouge". Cette expansion est dja fortement conteste (on peut expliquer le dcalage vers le rouge d'autres manires), mais en plus elle est trop faible pour expliquer la taille actuelle de l'univers.    On a donc invent "l'inflation", sans doute la trouvaille la plus hilarante de toute l'histoire de la science (enfin, tant qu'on ne sait pas combien on paye les astrophysiciens  nous sortir des trucs comme ?a). L'inflation consiste  dire que juste aprs sa naissance, l'univers s'est mis  enfler brusquement et  une vitesse digne de Superman (mme certains astrophysiciens pro-Big bang reconnaisse que la vitesse prvue par la thorie de l'inflation est... absurde), puis une fois sa taille actuelle atteinte se serait remis  grandir  la vitesse qu'on lui calcule aujourd'hui    Fameux, non ?    Et le plus dr?le est que la thorie de l'inflation ne cherche mme pas  expliquer pourquoi cette inflation a dbut, et pourquoi elle s'est termine... Oui, on paie des gens pour trouver des trucs comme ?a.    C'est un peu la mme chose avec les trous noirs : Contrairement  ce qu'on affirme ici ou l, aucun trou noir n'a t vu, mme indirectement. Tout ce qui est prsent comme un trou noir peut tre expliqu autrement.  Mais pire encore : Les thories ne prennent pas en compte un fait pourtant dmontr,  savoir qu'un trou noir ne pourrait mme pas se former  cause de sa vitesse de rotation : Un corps qui s'effondre sur lui-mme garde sa masse, mais galement son "moment angulaire". Et comme la gravit  la surface dpend de la masse, la vitesse de rotation  la surface dpend du moment angulaire.  On a un excellent exemple avec les patineurs artistiques : S'ils replient les bras, ils tourbillonnent bien plus vite.  Or, plus une sphre tourne vite, plus elle va s'aplatir, et donc plus son quateur va enfler.  Quand on voit l'effet que leur rotation a sur les plantes ou les toiles, on imagine sans peine l'effet sur un trou noirs, dont la vitesse de rotation est monstrueuse : Il devient si plat qu' l'quateur sa gravit est incapable de retenir sa matire. Vu la vitesse  laquelle un trou noir se forme, il s'aplatit presqu'instantanment et ne peut qu'exploser.    Et l surprise : On rsoud le mystre des sursauts d'nergie cosmique, le paradoxe d'un univers ternel et o pourtant tout n'a pas disparu dans des trous noirs, la prsence d'lments lgers (un trou noir naissant dtruit tous les atomes absorb, et quand il explose en recre en commen?ant videmment par le plus simple, l'hydrogne), celle d'lments si lourds qu'aucune toile n'est sense pouvoir en produire (grace  la formidable nergie produite par l'explosion du trou noir), les jets de matire gants et qui durent (si un trou noir se forme au milieu d'un environnement riche, il peut absorber la matire local aussi vite qu'elle disparait dans l'explosion), etc.    On devine alors qu'un tel trou noir permet de se passer compltement du big bang, et on comprend pourquoi il n'est jamais pris en compte...          Une citation, qui explique normment de chose et montre  quel point la thorie en vogue et ses filles (Big Bang, Expansion universelle, Inflation cosmiue) peuvent tre sujettes  caution :  =====================  De telles assertions suscitrent une violente polmique dans la communaut scientifique. S'il fallait  ce point amender les thories fondamentales, mieux valait considrer ces observations comme des artefacts optiques ou des effets gravitationnels locaux. La chose tait classe.

Pour essayer d'expliquer l'infini que nos cerveaux cartsiens ont bien du mal  apprhender, il y a une image trs simple qui rpond  la question "quy avait-il autour avant ?"  Faut imaginer le monde comme une rgle gradue, en mtal, infinie. Cette rgle n'a ni dbut ni fin puisqu'elle est infinie. Si on chauffe cette rgle, les graduations vont s'carter (dilatation due  la chaleur).  La rgle est donc toujours infinie, mais plus grande.  Donc, l'univers ne peut pas s'tendre au sens strict du terme, puisqu'il tait dj infini  la base.

De fait , le but de la physique etant de pouvoir predire les evenements, elle utilise des theories, une facon de representer ce qui se passe... une bonne theorie est alors un raisonnement qui permet de predir un evenement (par exemple la position d'uranus a un moment donne)...    la theorie du bigbang est actuellement la meilleur theorie dans son domaine ...  Quant au temps, il ets la desciption d'une evolution... de fait , dans l'une des theories du bigbang, le temps n'existe pas  au dela du debut, donc il n'y a pas de avant !  Ensuite il n'es pas plus cartesien de donner un debut et une fin que d"accepter des infinis !    Enfin, le big bang ne parle pas de "concentre de matiere " mais de densite forte... L'univers pouvait fort bien etre infini deja au bigbang !  Et il n'y a pas de "autour", puisque meme au bigbang, l'univers est le tout par definition...  Le probleme est l'erreur que bcp font : l'univers est en EXPANSION et non pas en EXTENSION, c'est a dire que sa metrique change, il ne s'aggrandit pas dans quelque chose !!!    enfin la physique n'explique pas les choses, elle les decrit pour permettre des previsions et d'avancer ... l'explication, c'est la philo ou la metaphysique ou meme la croytance qui peuvent la donner , pas la physique dont ce n'est pas le role.|`|566d4692c46d3f082dfff6ca835671f6aa	Ton raisonnement a une faille et mme une trs grosse: tu parles de choses que nous n'arrivons pas  concevoir. Et tu te lance dans un "qu'est ce qu'il y avait autour?" c'est un lger problme. tu n'arrive pas  sortir de ton raisonnement purement humain et donc subjectif selon lequel "il doit il y avoir quelque chose autour". N'est ce pas un peu contradictoire? Pour ton information,  l'origine, l'Univers n'tait pas un "concentr de matire" puisque la matire n'existait pas. Il ne pouvait pas se trouver "dans quelque chose" parce que l'espace n'existait pas. Par dfinition, l'Univers regroupe chque chose qui existe, il n'y avait donc que le "nant" "autour", rien, quelque chose de totalement impossible  concevoir puisque le nant inclu l'ide que rien n'existe et que c'est impossible  imaginer pour nous. Je n'affirme pas que la thorie du big-bang est juste, mais elle est bien plus probable qu'un univers qui a toujours exist. D'autant plus sachant que tous les objets s'loignent les uns des autres et ce de plus en plus vite.    Ne prtends pas tre capable de sortir de l'ide humaine, aucun de nous ne le peut.    Pour vampiloup, je dirai que ce serait faux de dire que la science est exacte. La plupart des thories reconnues et utilises sont fausses. La relativit restreinte par exemple, ne concorde pas avec la physique quantique. Ce n'est qu'un exemple mais si la science tait parfaite, la recherche n'existerait pas, le Big-bang est certe constest, mais jusqu'ici tout ceux qui ont propos d'autres thories se sont pour ainsi dire cass la gueule. Il faut reconna?tre que tu es trs fort pour dire "on essaie de nous tromper, tout le monde ment, c'est les chinois du FBI(lol)". Mais si tu as quelque chose de plus crdible, de plus srieux, correspondant mieux avec la ralit, nous n'attendons que toi...Vas-y dvoile tout ton gnie toi qui connait LA vrit.  Chacun fait de son mieux pour la trouver cette vrit, nous gardons les thories les plus probantes jusqu' ce que d'autres, plus logiques encore, se rapprochant plus de cette vrit(du moins celle qui nous semble les plus proche) ne vienne les remplacer. C'est beaucoup trop facile de critiquer sans rien faire.|`|8de7c65272d0ab3f0d935c2bd2b46da3aa	oui j'y crois.|`|6aeeda868b8ceba98f846207a78c864aaa	Tu fais trs bien de te poser toutes ces questions. D'autres l'ont fait avant toi, et d'autres le feront encore aprs. C'est de cette manire que les ides voluent et que l'on se donne la motivation d'aller plus loin.    Je vais tre franc et direct : oui, je crois  la thorie de l'origine pseudo-singulire mono-interactive (le nom savant du Big-Bang).    Mais j'ajoute et jeprcise que ce n'est ni parce tout le monde autour de moi y croit, ni pour me sentir mieux dans univers qui est n comme moi et qui n'a pas toujours exist.    J'y ai confiance ("croire" est un trop grand mot en sciences, on suppose avant tout !) parce qu'il y a de bonnes raisons de le faire. On sait que l'Univers est en expansion, donc qu'il tait plus petit dans le pass, on sait qu'il tait trs chaud, et donc qu'il tait vraiment trs trs trs petit dans le pass. Nos observations ne vont pas plus loin, mais la thorie est aussi robuste qu'elles : on a dcouvert que l'Univers devait se concentrer dans un volume infime quand il a commenc sa phase d'expansion.    Mais sache que parmi les cosmologistes, il y en a de moins en moins qui pensent encore que le Big Bang est le dbut de tout ; de la matire, de l'nergie, de l'espace et mme du temps.   Cette vision est a mon go?t et au go?t de nombreux autres chercheurs un peu trop frileuse, trop primitive, pas assez dveloppe. Le Big Bang, et en fait l'entiret du mouvement d'expansion qui s'en est suivi, ne pourrait au fond tre que le "rebond" de l'Univers s'tant d'abord effondr.    D'autres envisagent que l'Univers est apparu lorsqu'il s'est en quelque sorte "dtach" d'un espace extrieur, sous l'effet d'un phnomne quantique qui reste encore  lucider.    Une chose est s?re et certaine : le scnario du Big Bang est appel  tre modifi, ce sera invitable et les cosmologistes s'y attendent. Mais par contre, sa rfutation est pour le moins fort peu probable. Chacun a de bonnes raisons de croire que l'origine de notre Univers (enfin on ne parle plus d'origine si l'Univers existait dj avant...) tait bien pseudo-singulire et mono-interactive.    Bref le Big Bang n'est pas un dogme, mais une thorie couronne de succs. Reste encore  voir comment arranger les choses pour que ce succs soit encore plus clatant.|`|829d030be0a12dc078bb9efd182782c9aa	On croit ou on ne croit pas en Dieu ou en une religion.    Pour une thorie scientifique il ne s'agit pas de croyance mais de science.  Une thorie scientifique ne prtend jamais avoir une connaissance absolutiste et dfinitive ( la diffrence d'une religion) elle rend simplement compte de l'observation et des expriences et sa validit est prouve par des applications concrtes et indiscutables comme la technologie ou les prvisions : par ex. de la date d'une clipse etc.    Cette thorie ne dit pas qu'il n'y avait rien avant le big bang elle dit simplement que l'univers dans lequel nous sommes  commenc il y a environ 13,5 millliards d'anne  partir d'une singularit et que  la matire et l'espace-temps se sont  alors forms dans une explosion colossale  la suite de laquelle l'univers s'est gonfl  partir de rien (comme un ballon) et continue  le faire entrainant les galaxies c'est ce que l'on appelle son expansion.  Il y a un grand nombre de preuves exprimentales mais il faut etre un peu scientifique pour les comprendre.  Pour ce qu'il y avait ou n'avait pas avant cel fait encore dbat entre les scientifiques bien qu'il est possible qu'on n'ait jamais qu'une rponse thorique puisque l'avant bing-bang (si il existe) est inaccessible  l'exprience.  Chacun est libre de croire n'importe quoi mais ? c'est une affaire personnelle.

RxukJqL5aa	Let's see... there are a few different ways to do this, depending on what type of logical steps are allowed, but in my logic course, this is how it would be done:    Let x be an element of A-(B-C).  Then x is an element of A and x is not an element of B-C.    ---------    Now, x is either an element of C or not an element of C.    If x is an element of C, then it is an element of B(complement) U C.    If x is not an element of C, then let's assume that x is an element of B.  Then x is in B-C, but this is a contradiction, since we already know x is not in B-C, so our assumption that x is in B must be wrong.  Therefore x is not in B, so it is in B(complement).  Now, x is obviously in B(complement) U C.    Either way, x is in B(complement) U C.    ----------    Finally, we know that x is in A from our second line and we know that x is in B(complement) U C, so x is in A intersect (B(complement) U C).    Since every element in A-(B-C) is also in A intersect (B(complement) U C), it follows that the former is a subset of the latter, which is what we wanted to be proven.    ======    Something to point out about this proof: I had to use the law of the excluded middle, which is non-constructive, so it may be that this statement is actually not true in constructive logic.

Les afficionados de l'effet papillon connaissent bien le sujet.  Concernant le destin il faut inscrire cette question dans la dimension temporelle. En effet,  un instant t l'ensemble des causalits tant fix les lois statistiques permettent de dterminer un "plus probable chemin", d'autant moins probable que l'on s'loigne de l'instant t d'ailleurs. Ce chemin peut tre assimil au destin.  Si l'on s'inscrit dans l'optique religieuse, il convient de noter que deux notions apparemment antagonistes cohabitent parfaitement bien quand le postulat prcdent est accept : celle de destin et celle de libre-arbitre. Certaines religions privilgient l'une ou l'autre notion mais dans une acceptation religieuse la connaissance du destin peut s'accompagner du libre arbitre si cette connaissance revt en fait la connaissance de tous les chemins les plus probables quel que soit l'loignement de l'instant t, ce type de connaissance appartenant alors  une sphre hors des perceptions humaines que l'on qualifiera de divine.

Grave question. Des livres pleins ne rpondent pas  cela tellement c'est philosophiquement complexe. Mais ta sous question est bien plus simple. Tu parles d'un dessin " l'avance"...Par qui ? Ton problme est simplement religieux. Crois tu en un Dieu qui aurait fa?onn l'Univers "avant" ou crois tu que les lois physiques suffisent  expliquer l'Univers ?     Si tu te dis croyant, alors il est vident que tu rponds toi mme  ta question, et tout est dcid d'avance. Et mme le doute t'es interdit.    Si tu n'es pas croyant, alors l'Univers est le fruit du hasard et de la ncessit. Des causes qui entra?nent leurs consquences imprvisibles dans un chaos perptuel.    La plupart des gens sont croyants, c'est videmment plus rassurant de vivre dans un monde o tout est dtermin par un grand ordonnateur qui peut rcompenser de milles vierges  violer chaque jour (le Coran) ou d'un paradis (la bible) de jouissance ternelle, que de vivre dans un monde o les pauvres bons peuvent mourir avant les riches mchants. On aimerait croire  la justice immanente qui rendrait le monde rel plus juste. Malheureusement, je n'y crois pas. Et les guerres, les viols, les tortures et la btise humaine inpuisable m'incitent  continuer de ne pas croire au "bon" dieu.|`|81d410a78cc8d123d00921750a4f8553aa	J'ai lu ces commentaires et ai remarqu avec effroi le manque d'ides qu'il y avait. Entre les "je crois ci", "je crois ?a", et les contradictions dans un mme commentaire, ce sujet ne risque pas d'voluer. D'abord, ce qui para?t logique, c'est de commenter votre ide (d'o l'intrt de ces questions/rponses). Ensuite, pour Katiouchka, c'est nul. Dsol d'tre dur comme ?a, mais pourquoi mettre ton ide, puis une autre qui dtruit tout? Pour Thophile Gautier, Dieu=Destin, et Dieu=Hasard. Par contre, tu dis que "Si le hasard n'tait qu'une illusion?". Du coup, Thophile et toi n'avez pas la mme notion. D'accord,  l'cole on apprend "thse, antithse", mais il faut commenter tout ?a. De plus, c'est bien mignon de se rfrer  un Saint, encore faudrait-il que ?a aille. Je n'aime pas beaucoup ce genre de personnes qui ne croient que ce qu'ils voient. Comment un Saint, un Croyant (par dfinition: avoir foi en un tre surnaturel, donc invisible) peut-il donc croire que ce qu'il voit?  Petite aide: "ce qui se con?oit bien s'nonce clairement, et les mots pour le dire arrivent aisment." (Rimbaud)    Pour ce qui est de mon avis, il est divis. Croire au Destin, c'est croire qu'un tre tisse les vies de tout homme et donc qu'il joue avec nous comme nous avec des pantins. Or croire au Hasard, c'est imaginer que l'on est entirement seul, et que, par exemple, j'ai le choix d'crire ou non cette rponse.  Mais qu'est-ce qui me pousse  crire? Pourquoi je le fais au lieu de me coucher? Certainement le manque d'inspiration des autres rpondeurs... Ou alors il fallait que je le fasse.  Et puis, en rpondant, je vais peut-tre clairer la lenterne d'un futur lecteur qui se faisait une pauvre ide du Destin et du Hasard. Du coup, il aurait trouv sa rponse, pourrait crire un livre  ce propos et devenir clbre. Mais si je n'crivais pas, je ne frustrerais pas Katiouchka; elle n'aurait pas cette dsagrable sensation de n'avoir pas su exprimer ses ides et ne deviendrait donc pas introvertie...  Bref, vous l'avez compris, chaque action  ses ractions. L'on dit bien " chaque malheur, un bonheur appara?t"! Ainsi, avec cette notion dans l'inconscient, on imagine qu'en agissant, on fera toujours ce qui a de mieux. C'est pour ?a que j'cris.    D'un autre c?t, il est vrai que trop de hasards perturbent et l'on se prte  penser au destin. Si je n'avais pas envoy un sms  une fille et ne l'avais pas suivie pour bien voir qu'elle se foutait royalement de ma gueule, et si ma Amour n'avait pas t traine par des gens qu'elle n'aimait gure jusqu'au bar, je ne nagerai pas dans le bonheur en ce moment...    Je ne crois pas, je pense qu'un homme se cre un destin (dans le sens "une vie")  l'aide de hasards, et que ces hasards sont aids des destins (des vies) d'autres hommes.  Bob Marley a appris  jouer de la guitare dans un ghetto, a rencontr dans la rue Tosh et Livingston par hasard. Ils dcident de monter un groupe pour "aider" ceux de leur coin. Et ?a marche. Or avec tous ces hasards, Marley s'est cr un destin: celui d'tre le porte-parole des peuples noirs non-couts. Il y a d'autres hasards, par exemple appeler son fils Ziggy plut?t que John (ou qu'en sais-je?), mais il s'est trac son destin, qu'il suivra jusqu' sa mort, et ces hasards ne perturbent pas son destin.    Par contre, si votre Bible ou votre Coran (ou tout autre livre religieux) qui est sur votre chevet vous oblige  penser d'une certaine manire, je m'incline...

Plus serieusement, le gagnant Darwin Award 97 est superbe:      Le laurat pour 1997 s'appelle Larry Waters, de Los Angeles, un des rares  avoir survcu  son exploit. Tout petit, il rvait dj de voler ; c'est pourquoi, une fois ses tudes termines, il intgra l'arme de l'air, avec l'espoir de devenir pilote. Malheureusement, une vue dficiente l'en empcha et il dut se contenter de regarder passer les avions depuis la cour derrire sa maison.     Un jour, il eut une ide de gnie qui allait lui permettre de voler. Il se rendit au magasin le plus proche qui vendait du matriel provenant des surplus de l'arme et y acheta 45 ballons mtorologiques, d'un diamtre dpassant un mtre, ainsi que quelques bouteilles d'hlium. De retour chez lui, il fixa les ballons au transat de son jardin, qu'il attacha au pare-chocs de son 4x4 avant de gonfler les ballons. Il se munit de quelques provisions, ainsi que de son pistolet  air comprim, destin  faire clater un certain nombre de ballons pour lui permettre de redescendre sur terre le moment venu.     Ensuite, il s'installa dans son transat et s'attacha solidement, en pensant planer pendant quelques heures  une dizaine de mtres au-dessus de sa maison. Les choses ne se passrent pas comme il le supposait. En coupant la corde qui l'attachait  sa voiture, au lieu de s'envoler en douceur comme prvu, il partit comme un boulet de canon jusqu' 4000 mtres d'altitude.  A cette hauteur-l, il n'osait plus faire clater ne serait ce qu'un ballon, de peur de se dsquilibrer et il dut se rsigner  planer pendant plus de 14 heures, mort de peur et de froid. Ensuite les vrais ennuis commencrent.     Il atteignit les couloirs d'atterrissage de l'aroport international de Los Angeles. Le premier  le reprer fut le pilote d'un avion de United Airlines, qui signala  la tour de contr?le la prsence d'un homme arm dans un transat. Le radar confirma qu'un objet planait effectivement  4000 mtres au-dessus de l'aroport.  Le plan rouge tait dclench et un hlicoptre dcolla  la tombe de la nuit. Malheureusement un vent de terre se leva et emporta Larry vers la mer, suivi de prs par l'hlicoptre, qui ne russit  le rattraper qu'au bout de plusieurs kilomtres. Une fois que l'quipage eut compris que Larry ne reprsentait aucun danger, ils essayrent de se rapprocher mais chourent  cause des turbulences provoques par les pales.  Ils le remorqurent donc jusqu'au rivage o Larry fut arrt par la police de Los Angeles pour avoir viol l'espace arien. Pendant qu'on l'emmenait, les menottes aux poignets, un journaliste qui avait assist au sauvetage lui demanda pourquoi il avait fait cela.

Tout le monde conna?t la couleur du ciel et les phnomnes de rfraction et de diffusion de la lumire solaire mais trs peu de personnes sont capables d'expliquer scientifiquement pourquoi le ciel prsente cette couleur et pourquoi celle-ci varie avec l'altitude ou en fonction du temps ou de la saison.  Sans entrer dans les dtails de la composition de l'atmosphre ou des proprits du champ lectromagntique qui feront l'objet d'autres dossiers, rappelons que l'atmosphre terrestre est constitue d'un mlange de gaz et de diffrents autres substances (scorie, pollen, sable, sel, poussire mtoritique, ...) auxquels s'ajoutent les lments polluants. L'atmosphre se compose de 78% d'azote et de 21% d'oxygne. L'argon et l'eau (vapeur, pluie, glace) reprsentent la majorit du pourcent restant. La couche atmosphrique est plus dense dans les basses couches, dans les dix premiers kilomtres d'altitude et se rarfie graduellement jusqu' l'exosphre ou commence thoriquement le vide.  Bien que le spectre lectromagntique s'tende des innocentes ondes radios kilomtriques aux mortels rayons gamma, la lumire visible est la seule partie du spectre lectromagntique que l'oeil humain puisse dtecter. Ce spectre qui semble dcrire tout l'univers s'tend en ralit sur une portion trs rduit d'octaves qui limite notre vision de l'univers entre grosso modo 400 et 700 nm, du rayonnement bleu profond au rouge rubis. En-de? et au-del de ces longueurs d'ondes s'tendent des "lumires" invisibles telles que les rayonnements ultraviolet et infrarouge dont chacun a probablement dj subit les effets.  Les diffrentes couleurs du spectre visible sont donc dtermines par la longueur d'onde (la frquence) de l'nergie transporte par les photons. Ainsi la lumire bleue prsente une frquence plus leve et contient plus d'nergie que la lumire rouge.  La lumire du Soleil ou une lumire vive nous para?t blanche mais en ralit elle rsulte de la combinaison de plusieurs couleurs fondamentales ainsi que je l'explique dans d'autres dossiers consacrs  la photographie ou la spectroscopie. Nous pouvons observer ces diffrentes couleurs en dcomposant la lumire blanche  travers un prisme ou un rseau de diffraction. Le spectre de la lumire est galement visible lors de la formation d'un arc-en-ciel car les gouttes d'eau agissent alors comme autant de prismes individuels.  La lumire traverse lespace en ligne droite, en ralit en suivant les godsiques de lespace-temps, tant que rien ne vient modifier sa trajectoire. En pntrant dans latmosphre de la Terre, vers 50 km d'altitude la lumire rencontre des poussires et ce qu'on appelle communment des "molcules d'air", terme impropre qui dfinit les diffrents lments lgers qui constituent l'air que nous respirons. Son comportement dpend ensuite de la longueur donde du rayonnement et de la dimension des particules qu'elle rencontre.    Pourquoi le ciel est-il bleu ?  Les anciens Perses pensaient que la Terre reposait sur un saphir dont l'clat bleut se rfltait dans la couleur du ciel. Cette ide se rfre  la perception immdiate et encore ici il est difficile d'y croire qand on vit dans un lieu semi-dsertique ou sur une ?le. L'explication est videmment toute autre et lie aux phnomnes physiques qui accompagnent la diffusion de la lumire.  Les particules de poussire et les arosols qui composent l'atmosphre ont une dimension des millions de fois suprieure  la longueur donde de la lumire visible. En rencontrant les particules les plus grandes la lumire se rflchit sur leur surface et rebondit dans diffrentes directions, la lumire est diffuse. Dans ces conditions toutes les couleurs subissent les mmes rflexions de la mme manire.  Par contre les molcules d'air ont une dimension du mme ordre de grandeur que la longueur donde de la lumire visible. Quand un photon percute une molcule ou un atome, certains photons peuvent tre absorbs par les lectrons qui gravitent dans le nuage lectronique qui l'entoure. Pour retrouver sa stabilit latome rmettra cette lumire  la mme frquence mais dans des directions alatoires.  A cette chelle atomique les diffrentes couleurs du spectre ne sont pas toutes affectes de la mme fa?on. Bien que toutes les couleurs peuvent tre absorbes, les frquences les plus leves et les plus intenses dun point de vue nergtique (les bleues) sont plus frquemment absorbes que les frquences plus basses (rouges) qui par comparaison sont peu affectes par l'atmosphre. Ce phnomne est appel la diffusion de Rayleigh, nom du physicien anglais qui dcrivit ce phnomne en 1870.  La couleur bleue du ciel sexplique par l'importance de la diffusion de Rayleigh. La plupart des longues longueurs dondes, les couleurs rouge, orange et jaune en particulier traversent latmosphre sans tre trop dranges par ses constituants. Par contre la lumire bleue est absorbe par les molcules d'air qui rmettent ce rayonnement dans toutes les directions. La lumire bleue est ainsi diffuse  travers tout le ciel. Cest la raison qui explique pourquoi, quelle que soit lendroit du ciel que vous observiez, le ciel vous para?t bleu. On peut donc en conclure que sur un astre dpourvu d'atmosphre comme la Lune, la lumire ne sera pas diffuse et tous les rayonnements se propageront en ligne droite jusqu'au sol. Le ciel de la Lune est dsesprment noir, et du c?t obscur il est parsem d'toiles comme un velours de diamants.

The slope is the rise (change in y) divided by the range (change in x):    m = (y(2) - y(1)) / (x(2) - x(1))    In your problem, the first point is (3, 4) and the second is (2, 8).    m = (8 - 4) / (2 - 3) = 4 / (-1) = -4    For lines to be parallel, they must have the same slope, so you know the slope of the second line is -4.  All lines parallel to your line will have an equation:    y = -4x + b    To calculate b, you need one point on the new line:    b = y + 4x    Just plug in your x and y for your point, and you have solved your problem.

Quand les rayons solaires entrent dans l'atmosphre, ils rencontrent les atomes, les molcules d'air, les gouttes d'eau et la poussire dont est constitu l'atmosphre. Les molcules d'air ont la bonne dimension pour diffuser les plus courtes longueurs d'ondes de la lumire, les violet, indigo et bleu en l'occurrence; les longueurs d'ondes plus longues, telles que les rouges, ne sont  peu prs pas diffuses par ces molcules d'air.     C'est donc un mlange de violet, d'indigo, de bleu, de vert et une petite fraction des autres couleurs qui tant diffuss dans tout le ciel, lui confrant ce bleu qui l'on connait bien.|`|e6ea6b17fec59db50a3ead545fdd5e69aa	La composition de l'atmosphre terrestre est de 80% d'oxygne contre 20% d'azote, plus ou moins selon les autres matires. La rflexion de la lumire a travers l'atmosphre nous la fait paraitre bleu un peu comme un prisme( objet triangulaire et transparent) qui divise la lumire en arc-en-ciel. Par exemple, la composition de l'atmosphre martiens tant quasiment invers par rapport  celle de la terre.

422f12d430ede15e0408dc6b92c95fe8aa	La mthode la plus commune est de passer l'eau sur une membrane d'osmose inverse qui retient tous les sels prsents dans l'eau.  en gros, l'eau est divise en deux partie, une partie purifie, contenant trs peu de sels qui sert donc  l'utilisation, et une deuxime partie dans laquelle sont tous les sels qui est renvoye  l'gout.   En dessalement d'eau de mer, il y a  peu prs 50% d'eau purifie pour 50%  l'gout.|`|c47929cdde5297bf4f8b9a7b2f60be98aa	je pense qua ca se passe le plus simplement du monde...  tu chauffe l'eau qui s'evapore et dur recupere les vapeur d'eau que tu condenses par refroidissement...  comme quand tu fais des pates...tu sales l'eau mais l'eau qui s'evapore et qui perle sur le couvercle est dssale...    pareil...mais en quantit industrielle...|`|2f2cfa80e7899e9194eea5ea280067c8aa	La distillation voque plus haut doit exister mais c'est co?teux en nergie et peu rentable. On doit pouvoir en faire un peu en utilisant l'nergie solaire.  Je pense que les procds  fort dbit sont bass sur l'osmose inverse.  En simplifiant, il s'agit de membrane qui laissent passer plus les ions dans un sens que dans l'autre: D'un c?t on va avoir de l'eau qui se concentre en sel (on la renouvellera) et de l'autre, l'eau va perdre du sel.  En faisant plusieurs tapes, on arrivera  adoucir totalement l'eau.  C'est le procd qui a remplac la distillation pour l'obtention d'eau purifie. Pour une eau aussi pure, voire plus , que l'eau distille, il faut terminer par un traitement aux rsines changeuses d'ions. Pour le dessalage de l'eau de mer, cette ultime opration n'est pas ncessaire.|`|f637af17b7bd44a4b7a4830c940af5adaa	il me semble que c'est bas sur l'vaporation de l'eau puis aprs sur la condensation.|`|b99e7deedbbdc3f5462d72afa897b0faaa	on fait boullir l'eau et on rcupre la vapeur.

Le procd de dessalement le plus rpandu est la distillation multiflash : l' eau est chauffe, puis pompe dans des rservoirs o elle se vaporise brutalement (flash). Aprs plusieurs flashs successifs, la vapeur condense est rcupre et donne de l'eau pure.    2. La rfrigration est une mthode fonde sur la diffrence entre les points de conglation de l'eau douce et de l'eau sale. Les cristaux de glace sont spars de la saumure, lavs du sel, puis fondus.    3. Dans le procd appel osmose inverse, la pression permet de faire passer l'eau douce  travers une fine membrane qui ne laisse pas passer les minraux (le sel).    4. L'lectrodialyse est utilise pour les eaux saumatre. Le sel se dissout dans l'eau en ions ngatifs (-) et en ions positifs (+), qui sont mis en mouvement par un courant lectrique  travers des membranes anionique (-) et cationique (+), ce qui diminue la quantit de sel dans l'eau.

Mais , c'est trs mal vu de se poser des questions sur l'eau.    J'ai essay de suivre les travaux de Monsieur Benveniste sur la mmoire de l'eau = un exploit de ma part! il a russi " informer" de l'eau et en faisant traverser un rayon  transmettre cette info , par ce rayon,  un autre flacon d'eau. Il a russi aussi  transmettre cette info par internet ds un labo aux usa. Qui va poursuivre ses recherches????

X4dMZ3dqaa	1. Let t be the time req.     In t hours, Frank will travel 14*t km west. Since, Cleo starts 2 hours late, he will travel 5*(t-2) km.     The total distance betwwen them after t hours is   14t+5(t-2) = 104  19t - 10 = 104  t = 94/19 = 4.95 hours = 4 hrs 57 min.      2.  Let a be at tens place and b be at units place. So the original no is, 10a + b  And the reversed no is 10b+a  The original number minus the new number = (10a+b) - (10b+a) = 9a-9b = 18  a-b = 2                        -eqn 1    Now, sum of the digits of a two digit number is 16.  therefore, a+b = 16;            - eqn 2  subs a from eqn 1 in eqn 2,  (2+b)+b = 16  b=7   and a = 9.  Therefore the original number is 97      3.  Let Tony has a amount of books and Clarissa has b.  (1/2)a+(1/3)b = 30.  (2/5)a+(1/2)b = 31   a = 2*[30-(1/3)b]  putting in 2nd eqn,  (2/5)2*[30-(1/3)b] + (1/2)b = 31  On solving for b,  b = 30  therefore a=40.

b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Yes.  People who accidentally ingest or inhale too much of radioactive materials can die of "radiation poisoning."  The Curies, who researched radium and polonium, died this way.    Overexposure to things like X-rays can result in cancer.  This is what killed Rosalind Franklin, who would have shared in the Nobel prize for the discovery of the structure of DNA, had she not been dead.|`|EDjKCt0baa	100% ABSOLUTELY! BUT, only in high amounts. Ionizing radiation is radiation that is powerful enough to knock electrons out of their orbit- that can create ions- which can cause some nasty, unwanted chemical changes in our bodies, especially our DNA. However, radiation sources from outerspace are blocked or filtered by the Earth's magnetic field. As for X-rays, our bodies can deal with some radiation, certain processes in our body remove damaged proteins and portions of DNA. It takes a lot of radiation to do damage though, like an atom bomb amount. Isotopes are usually nonionizing. Don't worry about it too much, x-rays are safe.|`|AA10481903	Hey Binder.  There is some scientific evidence that suggests low-doses of ionizing radiation (as occurs as background radiation on planet earth) may actually have some beneficial effects on physiology because it stimulates various DNA repair mechanisms to function optimally.    However, higher doses, as occur with medical imaging systems (Xrays, CT scans, isotope imaging scans, etc.), definitely damage DNA, and therefore, are always associated with some health risk.    Best wishes and good luck.

ST is an interfacial property that exists in every interface between   media with different density and/or molecular interactions (more: the different attractive intermolecular forces that act in the two different phases).    Let U is the total cohesive energy per molecule.  If the characteristic molecular dimension is R and its area thus R2, then the surface tension is ST ~ U/(2R2).   Note that ST increases as the intermolecular attraction increases and the molecular size decreases.    That's why solutes can have different effects on surface tension   depending on their structure and concentration.    Upgrading your question:    - for delute aqueous sugar solution - no effect (both factors   mentioned above compensate each other)  - for more concentrated solutions - apparently measured ST is only a bit higher than that of water (due to strong electron- acceptor / electron-donor interactions between sugar molecules  - for oversaturated solution + gel + crystals of sugar - these are   completely other materials, so drastic increase of ST will exist    Nice question.  Good luck 2 you.
AA11457409	Let's do question 2 first since this will make it easier to see how to do question 1.    Let H be home, A be first base and B is 2nd base.    The angle HAB = 90 degrees    let x ft. be the player's distance from first base and let y be his distance from home, then from the pythagorean theorem we have:    (1)   y = sqrt(90^2 +x^2) ft = (90^2 +x^2)^0.5 ft    We are given dx/dt = 28ft per sec (a constant. Acceleration is ignored.)    Now: (2)   dy/dt = (dy/dx)*(dx/dt)    We are given dx/dt and we can determine dy/dx by taking the derivative of equation (1), using the rule for exponents and the chain rule:    dy/dx = 0.5(90^2+x^2)^ -0.5 * d/dx (90^2+x^2)     Now: d/dx (90^2+x^2) = 2x, so    dy/dx = x / (90^2 + x^2)^0.5    When the player is 30 ft from 2nd, he is 60 ft from first. So x = 60ft.  We can now determine dy/dt from (2) using x = 60 ft    dy/dt = (60 /(90^2+60^2)^0.5)*28 ft/sec    = 15.53 ft/sec    (note: this problem can also be solved using angular measure and simple trig)    When doing the first problem, label 3rd base C, and then the angle HCB = 90 degrees, and then solve it in the same manner.|`|d835927845deb7514fc694ba4b5fa767aa	1) The rate of change refers to acceleration. So find acceleration.         Velocity=28ft./s.

059673ed0fa26d9d3758fc8d0aea4222aa	There is no specific gene that makes one of us different from the rest.  Humans have about 30,000 or so different genes.  You have two versions of each of these genes, one from your mother and one from your father.  These two copies could be the same or different.  Your mother and father also have two copies of each gene.  During meiosis (the special cell division yielding eggs and sperm) genes get shuffled around.  Some are tied more closely together than others (like certain family traits), but the odds are 1 in more than 1 million that two people will have two children with exactly the same set of genes.
AA11513203	Simple:     The evolutionary concept of *common ancestry* explains "unity".    Two species that share the same ancestor will share many traits in common. This in turn explains the hierarchical *tree-like* structure of species ... a genus forms "unity" of many species ... a family forms "unity" of many genera, etc.    The evolutionary concepts of *speciation* explains "diversity".   One species becomes two when two subpopulations become genetically isolated for long enough that they accumulate genetic differences that make them incompatible for crossbreeding ... they are new species.

If you meant   a*+2ab+b*/(a+b) (where * means squared)   or   a*-2ab-b*/(a-b) then either one of them can be done.     For the first one it would be (a+b)*/(a+b). One of the (a+b) on the top cancels with the one on the bottom. Therefor the answer is a+b.    For the second one if would be exact same thing just replace the + with a - in all the spots.

S8H5yYcoaa	You want to use the given information to make a system of equations and unknowns to solve.  Let's call our unit digit u, and the tens digit t.  We could make a third unknown n for the number, but we know right away that n = 10t + u, (like how 34 = 10*3 + 4) so let's just substitute that in right away.    The unit digit is 5 more than the tens digit:  u = t + 5    The sum of the digits, u+t, is 8 less than half the number:  u + t = (10t + u)/2 - 8    Now we have two equations and two unknowns, let's substitute and solve.  As u is already isolated, I'm going to plug t+5 in for u in the second equation:  (t + 5) + t = (10t + (t+5))/2 - 8 - now gather like terms to find  2t + 5 = (11t + 5)/2 - 8 - add 8 to each side  2t + 13 = (11t + 5)/2 - multiply next by 2 to get rid of that ugly fraction!  4t + 26 = 11t + 5, and subtract 4t + 5 from both sides:  21 = 7t, so t = 21/7 = 3.    We substitute out t value back into the first equation to find that u = 3 + 5 = 8, so the number in question is 38.|`|OtRD7iC8aa	answer is 38  solution is  let x= tens digit       y= unit digit  then, make the equations based from the problem..      y=x+5;      x+y=1/2(10x+y)-8    now, substitute the value of y to the second equation, you'll have      x+(x+5)=1/2(10x+(x+5))-8  simplifiying..you'll get      2x+5 = 11/2x - 11/2    transfer all the x on the right side and the constants on the left..      21/2 = 7/2 x           3 = x  now u know that the tens digit is 3  using the first equation a while ago, you'll get y     y=x+5     y=3+5     y=8    so the number is 38!!  check it and you'll see that it is right. =)  enjoy solving!

AA10927246	There are 5,280 feet in a mile.  A mile is equivalent to 8 furlongs, where a furlong was the standard length of a "furrow" in a plowed field.    And each furlong was measured as 10 "chains".  The chain was a standard surveyors measurement and was literally a chain that was 22 yards long used for marking distances.    Multiplying it all out:  8 furlongs x 10 chains/furlong x 22 yards/chain x 3 feet/yard  = 5,280 feet    I bet that's more information than you wanted, but I think the history is neat!

AA10277342	Given:  H = -16T^2 + 45T+ 10      It makes more sense to answer these questions slightly out  of order.  Taking the last question first:    --------------------      DESCRIBE A SITUATION THAT THIS EQUATION COULD REPRESENT?    This fits the measurement of an object thrown up from  a platform (which travels up until gravity pulls it  back to the ground).    --------------------    WHAT DOES EACH COEFFICIENT REPRESENT IN THIS EQUATION?    10 is the height of the platform  45 is based on the force the object is thrown  -16 is based on the strength of gravity    --------------------      HOW DOES THIS EQUATION HELP FIND THE HEIGHT OF AN OBJECT IN TERMS OF TIME?    Given any time, plug it into the equation for "T" to  compute the height at that time.    --------------------      AT WHAT TIME WILL THE OBJECT BE AT A HEIGHT OF 20T?    Start with the height formula:  H = -16T^2 + 45T+ 10    Plug in the given height:  20 = -16T^2 + 45T+ 10  16T^2 - 45T + 10 = 0    Use the quadratic equation:  T = (-(-45) +/- sqrt(45^2 - 4(16)(10))) / (2*32)  T = (45 +/- sqrt(2025 - 640))) / 64  T = (45 +/- sqrt(1385)) / 64    T = (45 + sqrt(1385)) / 64 = 1.28461856456026235200    or    T = (45 - sqrt(1385)) / 64 = 0.12163143543973764799    Therefore, the object will be at height 20 after 0.12 seconds  (on the way up) and after 1.28 seconds (on the way back down).    --------------------    WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND WHEN DOES IT OCCUR?    To find the max/min, take the derivative:  H' = -32T + 45    And find the zero solutions:  0 = -32T + 45  32T = 45  T = 45/32  T = 1.40625    Note that H'' = -32, which means that the curve is concave  down.  Thus this is a maximum point.    Therefore, the object reaches its maximum at T=1.40625 seconds    --------------------    WHEN DOES THE OBJECT HIT THE GROUND?    Solve for H = 0:      H = -16T^2 + 45T+ 10  16T^2 - 45T - 10 = 0    Use the quadratic equation:    T = (-(-45) +/- sqrt( 45^2 - 4*16*(-10)))/(2*16)  T = (45 +/- sqrt(45^2 + 640)) / 32    T = (45 + sqrt(45^2 + 640)) / 32 = 3.01948868739253832710  or  T = (45 - sqrt(45^2 + 640)) / 32 = -.20698868739253832710    We're not interested in the negative solution, so we can  see that the object strikes the ground after 3.02 seconds.        .

First, divide both sides by 2. To complete the square, the coefficient on x^2 needs to be 1.  You should get    x^2 + (7/2)x + (3/2) = 0    Now, move the last term to the other side:    x^2 + (7/2)x = -3/2    Ok, here's the magic part.  We have to add something to both sides such that the left side becomes something that can be factored.  We're gonna do one better, and turn it into something that can be factored into something like (x + a)^2.    To do this, take one half of the coefficient on x:    7/2 * 1/2 = 7/4  // don't forget about this number though!    And square the result:    (7/4) ^ 2 = 49/16.    This is that magic number we need to add to both sides:    x^2 + (7/2)x + 49/16 = -3/2 + 49/16    Now the left side can be factored.  Remember I said don't forget the number 7/4?  That's the number inside the factored form.  So, we have    (x + 7/4)^2 =  -3/2 + 49/16    Now, simplify the right side    (x + 7/4)^2 =  25/16    Now you can take the square root of both sides to get    x + 7/4 = sqrt(25/16), or  x + 7/4 = 5/4, or  x = 5/4 - 7/4    Thus x = -1/2, or x = -3.

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	Let's call it : ABCDEF / G = 9HJK8  Therefore, ABCDEF = G * 9HJK8    (1) A and G cannot be 0. (obvious).  (2) G cannot be 1.

CYtMRC4eaa	Assuming that white and curly are recessive to brown and straight, the genotype of the female dog is bbss, and the genotype of the male dog is BbSs.  I chose B for brown and S for straight.    The top of the Punnett square has the gametes BS, Bs, bS, and bs.  The side of the Punnett square has the gamete bs.  Therefore, the Punnett square is a 1x4 rectangle.  If your teacher wants you to make an actual square out of it, just make 4 rows with the bs gametes.    Anyway, you'll find 4 different phenotypes and 4 different genotypes in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 in both cases.

So in the case of kicking a soccer ball,  two objects exert forces to each other:  The foot exert a force on the soccer ball.  At the same time the soccer ball exerts an equal but opposite force on the foot.  This shows that forces always come in pair.    Hope this helps.    teddy boy

87f936b151812275e32957d6ade75d79aa	Roundworms can also infect certain insects. Tapeworms are typically flattened and segmented almost like an earthworm, roundworms are more cylindrical and smoother. Because cockroaches eat all sorts of things, including rotten meat, it is very possible for them to contract such a parasite. They are what are called incidental hosts to this parasite. Most "worms" are commonly assicated with mammlas, but what this worm was doing was probably waiting for this roach to be consumed by a rat, or cat, or some other mammal so that its life cycle could continue. I guess that because cockroaches have a diet similar tot hat of people, it was able to survive. I have to admit, this is a very weird case, you should probably repot it to the local university, or parasitology department if you can. I have been studyinh insect for many years now and have never seen such a thing, not to say that it is impossible, because obviously it happened. Good Question! I hope my answer helped!|`|0b753b18310b7a6a35d26ad50aa1e840aa	tapeworms can't live outside the body unless they live in feces.  i guess that was a tapeworm because you accurately described one.  it is very possible that a tapeworm may have been in the cockroach.  in some countries, people have tapeworms in their bodies that are 3 or 4 times longer than them.  they can fit into very compact areas, though, and they attach to the intestines of the being with a claw-like grip.  i've never heard of a tapeworm infesting a cockroach, but it's possible.

75499f00311699c5e6fcf44ae88b00a7aa	La couleur du ciel vient de la manire dont les rayons du soleil sont transmis par l'atmosphre terrestre. Thoriquement, le ciel devrait tre noir puisque la lumire est invisible !!  L'air contient environ 78% de molcules dazote et 21% de molcules doxygne.  Les molcules de lair sont beaucoup plus petites que les longueurs donde de la lumire du soleil. C'est pourquoi les rayons du soleil sont diffuss par ces molcules. Cela veut dire qu'ils vont en fait "s'parpiller" dans toutes les directions.  Mais, si tous les rayons sont diffuss, ils ne le sont pas tous de la mme fa?on : ils sont d'autant plus diffuss que leur longueur d'onde est courte :  Les lois de Rayleigh nous apprennent que les particules diffusent les ondes dont la longueur est plus petite que la taille de ces mmes particules. L'intensit de la couleur diffuse est inversement proportionnelle  la puissance quatrime de sa longueur d'onde. Or les molcules de l'atmosphre : oxygne, azote et poussires sont d'une taille proche de les longueurs d'ondes lumineuses. Les photons transportant le bleu sont fortement diffuss par l'atmosphre alors que le rouge ne l'est pas.  Intensit de diffusion du bleu : Ib = 1/(446 * 10-9)4 = 2.52*1025   Intensit de diffusion du rouge : Ir = 1/(750 * 10-9)4 = 3.16*1024   Le rapport des deux : Ib/Ir = 8   Donc la couleur bleu est 8 fois plus diffuse que le rouge.  Traduction : les rayons bleus sont plus diffuss que les rayons verts et beaucoup plus diffuss que les rayons jaunes. Les rayons violets sont en fait encore plus diffuss que les rayons bleus (car leur longueur d'onde est encore plus courte). Alors, pourquoi ne voyons-nous pas un ciel violet ? Cela ne tient plus du tout  ce qu'on regarde, mais  QUI regarde : l?il humain est beaucoup plus sensible au bleu qu'au violet.   Notre ?il per?oit donc essentiellement la couleur bleue du ciel. Voil pourquoi vous voyez un ciel bleu !|`|84f34f9592f9e6dadb34a52bb9adb4d0aa	bleu fonce et toile|`|06089df66b35e0bcc293a17c58fc11d2aa	la meme que celle de la nuit !|`|133b4a32e4b23b0120985d7a73843b4baa	En fait ?a dpend un peu de l'endroit et du moment.|`|350a6019ea0e0c667b40ae9a3a0c21bdaa	Bleu|`|5ad8af5c60cba4655eba072e054f6f82aa	bleu parce que les molcules d'air de la haute atmosphre vibrent dans la logueur d'onde du bleu|`|c98e2e1749ca26f86c2e62f9b6f243d5aa	bleu car les molcule de l'atmosphre vibre avec une frquence entre 0.4 mecro... et0.8 mecro...ou il trouve la frquence de visualisation de bleu.|`|81a47b3cf8306846ae53b7bdf7e28c66aa	?a dpend si y a du vent|`|1ceb98d49210d12a27af627419e6c28aaa	bleu a cause de la rfraction de la lumire sur l eau.|`|ca759e74db56b6cace63e2d552f1b641aa	Bleu trs fonc, presque noir.

Tout d'abord parce que ta formation n'est pas adaptee, il aurait mieux valut un BTS, ensuite et surtout parce que les postes en France ne sont pas legion, sauf peut-etre pour des techniciens en analyse. Je te conseille donc de continuer en maitrise puis tenter un master si possible a l'etranger (c presk devenu obligatoire d'avoir une exp hors de France vu la concurrence). Sinon, tente d'integrer une ecole d'ingenieur sur dossier apres la maitrise, ce qui est pour moi la meilleure option mm si elle ne te garantira un emploi a la sortie. En tout cas un conseil vu tu es deja a BAC+3 ne t'arrete pas avant BAC+5 et choisit une voie generaliste que ce soit de la chimie minerale ou organique, je te conseille organique, ca offre plus de debouches pour travailler en pharma, ou petrole ou polymere...

Il existe plusieurs possibilits (autres que l'ANPE....). Mais le choix dpend entre autre de ta motivation, de tes rsultats.  1) Suite logique: un master de chimie (la ma?trise a disparu avec la mise en place de l'harmonisation europenne ou LMD). En 2me anne tu pourras choisir un master recherche ou professionnel (ex- DEA et DESS respectivement). En gros un master pro t'amne a des fonctions quivalentes  celles d'un ingnieur. Pour le master recherche c'est le passage oblig pour le doctorat, sachant qu'il faut dcrocher un financement pour la thse. Tu es toujours tudiant(e) mais fini tu bosses sur ton sujet de recherche, et tu es "autonome" financirement (environ 1100/mois).  2) Certains ont voqu la possibilit CAPES/Agreg. Si tu as fait une licence de chimie physique ou sciences physiques pas de problme. Par contre si c'est une licence de chimie, c'est moins vident car la part de physique y est non ngligeable et va falloir s'accrocher. De plus il faut que l'enseignement t'attire.  3) Enfin si tu dsires intgr le monde professionnel, tu peux bien s?r candidater directement mais aussi t'inscrire dans une Licence Professionnelle (stage de 6 mois en entreprise) qui est gnralement un bon tremplin vers la vie active.   Pour conclure tout cela dpend de tes motivations porfessionnelles, personnelles, et il ne faut pas perdre de vue que plus le niveau est lev plus la probabilit de trouver du travail  c?t de chez soi devient difficile. Donc il ne faut pas hsiter,  bouger tant en France, qu' l'tranger (il existe des programmes spcifiques pour l'UE). De plus ? ouvre l'esprit ce qui ne fait pas de mal...  Bonne continuation.

La contamination par l'homme aurait t ralise par la chasse, la consommation de viande de singe et une mutation du virus. Les tudes scientifiques ont suggr que le virus serait apparu initialement en Afrique de l'Ouest, mais il est possible quil y ait eu plusieurs sources initiales distinctes. Le premier chantillon recens du virus VIH fut recueilli en 1959  Lopoldville (aujourd'hui Kinshasa), dans lactuelle Rpublique dmocratique du Congo. Parmi les premiers chantillons recueillis, on compte galement le cas dun Amricain homosexuel en 1969, et dun marin htrosexuel norvgien en 1976.    Dans son livre La rivire, le journaliste Edward Hooper attribue l'origine du sida aux vaccins anti-polio, ou plut?t aux mthodes de vaccination contre la poliomylite employes notamment au Congo. Cette thse est totalement rfute aprs la publication d'un article dans la revue Nature [1].     la fin des annes 1970, des mdecins de New York et de San Francisco s'aper?oivent que nombreux sont leurs clients homosexuels souffrant d'asthnie, de perte de poids et parfois mme de forme rare et atypique de cancer (comme le Sarcome de Kaposi qui s'attaque aux leucocytes). L'existence d'un problme sanitaire est avre en juillet 1981 lorsque le Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) d'Atlanta relve une frquence anormalement leve de sarcomes de Kaposi, en particulier chez des patients homosexuels. L'apparition d'un nouveau virus est voque ds 1982.    En 1983, l'quipe du Professeur Jean Claude Chermann de l'institut Pasteur dcouvre et isole le virus VIH.    Lorigine virale ne sera pas d'emble voque et lhypothse dune intoxication par des produits comme les poppers (stimulant sexuel contenant du nitrite damyle) a pu tre mise au dbut, car les six premires personnes malades en avaient toutes t de gros consommateurs. De mme, lidentification du virus responsable a t difficile, beaucoup de scientifiques parlant dHTLV comme cause de lpidmie. Semparant de la dcouverte, la presse a commenc par dsigner le virus par la priphrase de ? cancer gay ?, avant de revenir sur ce prjug. Cest  la mme priode que de nombreux transfuss (notamment en France) sont contamins par des lots de sang contenant le virus VIH. En quelques annes, le virus va stendre pour finir par toucher toutes les couches de la population. Seules les campagnes dinformation sur les comportements  risque, les mthodes de propagation de la maladie et surtout les moyens de protection permettront aux pays dvelopps denrayer la progression (sans toutefois pouvoir la bloquer). La prise de conscience gnrale doit aux populations homosexuelles son dploiement rapide ; en effet, de nombreux mouvements, tels que celui dAct Up, et des vedettes internationales ont forc la visibilit, incitant les dirigeants politiques  engager de vritables recherches scientifiques.    Cest aujourdhui principalement les habitants des pays en voie de dveloppement qui sont les principales victimes de ce virus. Les raisons sont multiples et varient dun pays  lautre : tourisme sexuel pour lAsie du Sud-Est, culture valorisant le nomadisme sexuel et la polysexualit (Europe), absence dinformation de la population sur les facteurs de risque de transmission (notamment en Afrique), manque de moyens ou de volont pour faire de la prvention et informer les populations, voire refus dadmettre les faits. Certains estiment que les convictions religieuses interdisant lutilisation des moyens de protection tels que le prservatif sont aussi en cause.

Je crois que c'tait une campagne anti polio.   Pour pouvoir synthtiser le vaccin, les mdecins avaient besoin de sang et,  un moment, ils sont arrivs  court de sang humain et ont donc dcid de prendre le sang de certains singes (gorilles mais je ne suis pas s?re).   Ils ont synthtiser le vaccin avec le sang de ces animaux en pensant que, comme ces derniers taient nos lointains cousins, cela ne poserait pas de problme de rejet pour les humains.   Par contre, ils n'ont pas pens  faire des recherches de virus.  Mais, les singes avaient une maladie infectieuse que l'on ne connaissait pas  l'poque.

Lors de la premire division miotique, elles se divisent en deux cellules filles, chacune contenant un chromosome  deux chromatides de chaque paire.    Lors de la seconde division miotique, chaque cellule issue de la premire division se spare  son tour en deux cellules filles (gamtes) qui re?oivent chacune une chromatide.  l'issue de ces divisions miotiques, chacun des gamtes ne contient que la moiti des chromosomes des cellules germinales (on dit que les gamtes sont des cellules haplo?des).    Dans le cas de la spermatogense, les quatre cellules issues de la seconde division miotique (spermatides) donneront naissance  quatre spermatozo?des, tandis que dans le cas de l'ovogense, la miose d'un ovocyte primaire ne fournira qu'un seul ovule.

566d4692c46d3f082dfff6ca835671f6aa	D'abbord, il faut bien garder en tte que le CODE gntique est universel, il est le mme pour chaque tre vivant, de la plus petite bactrie  la baleine bleue en passant par la dipneuste et l'ornithorynque. seul les gnes varient. Quand  l'volution, elle s'explique facilement: lorsque une cellule se reproduit, elle divise son ADN en deux (un peu comme une fermeture clair) puis, la cellule replace des nuclotides en face de chaque moiti pour recombiner le gne(chaque nuclotide est reprsent par une lettre il en existe quatre pour l'ADN: A, T, G, C, Le "A", allant toujours en face du "T" et le "G", toujours en face du "C") on obtient alors deux gnes exactement semblables et ayant chacun une moiti du gne prcdent. Mais il peut parfois se produire des erreurs lors de la recombinaison de l'ADN, ou lors de la sparation. Dans un tre vivant complexe, il y a une sorte de correcteur qui rpare ce genre d'erreurs ventuelles mais ce correcteur n'est pas parfait, les tre vivants peu complexes comme les virus ne poosdent pas se correcteurs ce qui fait que ce genre d'erreurs arrivent souvent. Ces erreurs peuvent avoir des effets diffrents, ils peuvent n'avoir aucune incidence ou bien leur tre dfavorable (en rendant l'tre vivant plus faible par exemple), dans ce cas, il ne pourras pas se reproduire puisqu'il mourra plus t?t, ou, trop faible, ne plaira pas aux femelles ou aux males (si il s'agit d'un animal). Le gene peut tre aussi  l'avantage de l'tre vivant, par exemple, l'anctre de la girafe avait un cou relativement court, puis, un individu est n avec un cou plus long que les autres ce qui lui a permit de mieux se nourrire puisqu'il pouvait atteindre des feuilles que les autres ne pouvaient atteindre et ainsi en avoir plus, cela lui permettait aussi de mieux voir les dangers, etc. Mieux nourris, il est devenu plus fort, gagnait donc souvent les bagarre pour avoir la meilleure femelle si il s'agit d'un male, ou d'attirer plus les males s'il s'agit d'une femelle, il ou elle a ainsi pus transmettre le gne du "cou long"  sa descendance plus nombreuse que celle des autres, sa progniture  pu  son tour mettre  profit cet avantage, et les porteurs du gne du "cou court", a disparu(du moins dans la rgion ou vivent les girafes).

Placer les oeufs la pointe en bas pour viter que la chambre  air ne soit comprime et afin que le jaune demeure bien centr; viter de laver les oeufs car cela enlve leur pellicule protectrice et favorise la pntration des germes.

Les blancs d'oeufs et les oeufs entiers lgrement battus peuvent tre congels tels quels environ 4 mois.

Il faut un talon..  Normalement l'talon exploite le phnomne le plus prcis disponible, sinon il est temps de changer d'talon.. ce qui est arriv souvent dans l'histoire de la mtrologie..  Dans l'absolu on doit pouvoir mesurer non pas la dispersion de l'talon mais la dispersion de fabrication des copies. Ce qui donne une ide de la dispersion absolue.  On peut aussi prdire la dispersion en calculant les effets de l'environnement  (temprature, pression, etc..), comme il y a une limite  la prcision de contr?le des paramtres on en dduit une prcision "calcule".  Une autre possibilit est d'utiliser des talons pour deux units diffrentes. Par exemple le temps et la longeur sont lis par la vitesse de la lumire.

Einstein lui-mme :    Cher ami,    Vitesse de la lumire    La valeur exacte de la vitesse lumire est de : 299 792 458 m/s.    Cependant, il serait dommage que je me limite  vous donner cette valeur sans en profiter pour faire un peu d'histoire.    On a cru pendant longtemps que la lumire se transmettait avec une vitesse infinie, ce qui est faux, bien entendu.    Au XVIIme sicle, deux savants, Galile et Descartes, avaient deux penses diffrentes sur la lumire. L'ide de Descartes tait que la propagation de la lumire tait instantane et qu'elle avait une vitesse infinie. Mais Galile voulut prouver que l'on pouvait calculer sa vitesse. Il demanda  un assistant de se placer  3 km de distance par rapport  lui. Galile lui envoie un signal lumineux et son assistant doit faire de mme. Galile voulait conna?tre la vitesse en divisant simplement la distance totale parcourue par le temps, mais cela n'a pas march puisque la distance tait trop courte et la lumire arrivait trop vite.    C'est au Danois Roemer que l'on doit la premire dtermination approche de la vitesse de la lumire. Aprs de longues observations, il remarque, en 1676, que l'occultation des satellites de la plante Jupiter ne se produit pas exactement aux moments prvus par les tables astronomiques de Cassini (fran?ais d'origine italienne). Selon la position de la Terre par rapport  Jupiter et au Soleil (Terre en conjonction ou en opposition ), l'occultation du satellite le plus proche se produit avec un dcalage de 16 minutes 26 secondes. Un premier calcul annonce une vitesse de 214 300 km/s. Pas mal, pour un calcul effectu en 1676!    Puis, en 1849, le fran?ais Fizeau tudie la marche d'un faisceau lumineux entre deux maisons distantes de 8633 mtres et passant entre les dents d'une roue dente. Le calcul de la vitesse de la lumire fait intervenir le temps entre diffrentes extinctions du faisceau. Fizeau a trouv 315 364 kilomtres par seconde.    A partir de 1850, Foucault cherche  dterminer la vitesse de la lumire en utilisant un miroir tournant. Il est inform des travaux des physiciens Arago (fran?ais) et Wheastone (anglais). En 1865, grace  un miroir tournant  vitesse leve, Foucault parvint  mesurer la vitesse de la lumire sur une distance de quelques mtres,  l'intrieur mme de l'Observatoire de Paris.

Son bsicamente consumidores 'oportunistas' (sobreviven con lo que est disponible) con caractersticas anatmicas y fisiolgicas ms generalizadas, especialmente en lo relativo a los dientes. Toda la evidencia disponible indica que la dieta humana natural es omnvora e incluira la carne. No estamos, sin embargo, obligados a consumir protenas animales. Tenemos una eleccin.     Los Grandes Simios     Hay muy pocos frugvoros entre los mamferos en general, y entre los primates en particular. Los nicos monos que son predominantemente frugvoros (gibones y siamanes) son atpicos entre los monos en muchos aspectos ecolgicos y de comportamiento, y comen cantidades sustanciales de vegetacin. Los orangutanes son semejantes, sin ninguna observacin en estado salvaje de consumo de carne.     Los gorilas son ms tpicamente vegetarianos, con menos nfasis en las frutas. Hace varios a?os se inici un estudio muy elegante sobre la relacin entre el tama?o corporal y la dieta en los primates (y algn otro grupo de mamferos). Los nicos primates en la lista con dietas puras fueron las especies de tama?o peque?o (que son enteramente insectvoras) y las ms grandes (que se especializan en una dieta vegetariana). No obstante, el espectro de preferencias dietticas reflejan las necesidades diarias de alimentacin de cada tama?o corporal y la disponibilidad relativa de recursos alimentarios en la selva tropical. Nuestros parientes ms cercanos entre los monos - en sentido anatmico, de comportamiento, gentico y evolucionario - son los chimpancs, que frecuentemente matan y comen otros mamferos (inclusos otros primates).     Evidencia de los Humanos como Omnvoros     Historia Arqueolgica     Hasta los tiempos documentados ms remotos, la historia arqueolgica indica claramente una dieta omnvora para los humanos que inclua la carne. Nuestros ascendentes fueron cazadores y recolectores desde el principio. Al comenzar la domesticacin de las fuentes alimentarias, inclua tanto animales como plantas.     Tipos de Clulas     El nmero relativo y la distribucin de los tipos de clulas, as como las especializaciones estructurales, son ms importantes que la longitud total del intestino a la hora de determinar la dieta tpica. Los perros son carnvoros tpicos, pero sus caractersticas intestinales tienen ms en comn con los omnvoros. Los lobos comen mucha materia vegetal.     Los Depsitos de Fermentacin     Casi todos los herbvoros tienen depsitos de fermentacin (espacios engrandecidos donde reside la comida mientras los microbios la atacan). Los ruminantes como las vacas y los ciervos tienen sacos anteriores derivados de un esfago y estmago remodelados. Los caballos, los rinocerontes, y los monos de tipo "Colobino" tienen sacos posteriores. Los humanos no tienen tales especializaciones.     Las Mandbulas     Aunque la evidencia sobre la estructura y funcin de las manos y mandbulas humanas, su comportamiento e historia evolucionaria tambin o apoyan una dieta omnvora o no apoyan una dieta vegetariana estricta, la mejor evidencia proviene de los dientes.     Los colmillos peque?os de los humanos son una consecuencia funcional del crneo ms grande y la reduccin asociada del tama?o de la mandbula. En los primates, los colmillos funcionan como armas de defensa y como instrumento visual de amenaza. Curiosamente, los primates con los colmillos ms grandes (gorilas y babuinos gelada) tienen dietas bsicamente vegetarianas. En los restos arqueolgicos, los molares humanos a menudo se confunden con los premolares y molares de los cerdos, un omnvoro clsico. Por otra parte, algunos herbvoros poseen incisivos bien desarrollados que a veces se confunden con los de la dentadura humanos cuando se encuentran en las excavaciones arqueolgicas.     Las Glndulas Salivares     stas indican que podramos ser omnvoros. Los datos de la saliva y de la orina varan, dependiendo de la dieta, no del grupo taxonmico.     Los Intestinos     La absorpcin intestinal es una cuestin de rea de superficie, no lineal. Los perros (que son carnvoros) tienen especializaciones intestinales ms caractersticas de omnvoros que de carnvoros como los gatos. El nmero relativo de criptas y tipos de clulas es una mejor indicacin sobre la dieta que la mera longitud. Nosotros los humanos ocupamos un lugar intermedio entre los dos grupos.     Conclusin     Los humanos somos ejemplos clsicos de omnvoros en todos los aspectos anatmicos relevantes. No hay ninguna base anatmica ni fisiolgica para la suposicin de que los humanos estamos preadaptados a la dieta vegetariana. Por esta razn, los mejores argumentos en pro de una dieta exenta de carne se limitan a las cuestiones ecolgicas, ticas o de salud.

Segn el Dr. Alan Walker, antroplogo de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, el homo erectus, la especie inmediatamente antecesora a nuestra propia homo sapiens, muestra evidencias de una dieta omnvora.

La ciencia que estudia los mamferos se denomina teriologa,mamiferologa  mastozoologa.    Los mamferos son animales vertebrados al igual que los anfibios, los reptiles, las aves y los peces. Se diferencian de estos otros al tener pelos en la superficie del cuerpo. En la mayora de los mamferos, pero no en todos, las hembras poseen mamas con las que alimentan a sus cras.      Los mamferos descienden de los reptiles. No aparentamos parecernos mucho porque los mamferos surgieron hace unos 195 millones de a?os. Aunque es posible que las dos ramas se hayan separado mucho antes que eso, porque no eran los mismos reptiles de los que descienden los reptiles de hoy en da. En aquel entonces los reptiles dominaban el mundo, y nosotros ramos peque?as musara?as. Con el transcurso del tiempo cada grupo evolucion en diferentes direcciones, ellos se volvieron ms chiquitos y nosotros ms grandes.            Las 4,500 a 5,000 especies diferentes de mamferos que viven hoy en da se estudian en grupos. Estos grupos se basan en las semejanzas y diferencias entre las especies.

At very high voltage you get the "Skin Effect" which the current is only carried on the outer most surface of conductor. The condutor could be hollow and make no difference. If you are taking about magnetic field of a transformer,  the induced current creates a flux movement around the iron core which induces the secondary coil. Once again the flow is circular lines around the core.<br>  <br>   Edit: Your just an idiot. You did this once before to me.

You can bound |E| in two ways: |E| <= |Y|p because the vertices of Y have at most p edges and |E| => |X|p because the vertices of X have at least p edges. Put these two inequalities together and you get |Y|p >= |X|p. Canceling p yields |Y| >= |X| as desired.

CzBNTeLAaa	Stop and move back very slowly and try to get to a rock to stand on or climb a tree. If it still is under attack, do not run, but YES yell and fight back with everything you have. You have nothing to lose if it's attacking you as you will be hit, bitten and clawed at anyway, at least you have some chance of scaring it away, as they don't want to eat you but can and will kill you, but this is last resort. They can climb trees and run much faster than you can.<br>  <br>  In general though, playing dead in a daytime grizzly  encounter tends to reduce the level of injury sustained by most attack victims. Many grizzly attacks are defensive in nature, and playing dead with your head down, and hands and arms covering your head and back of your neck, may show the bear that you are not a threat. <br>  <br>  It really depends on the bear, other circumstances, etc.<br>  See link for how to's about other bears with advice on what to do: <a href="http://www.mountainnature.com/Wildlife/Bears/BearEncounters.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountainnature.com/Wildlife/B...</a>|`|GHkpKIamaa	Fight back? That equals death in about 4 seconds. A person who attacked a bear that I know had his ear cleaved off and had his face gashed open by one swing of the claw.

Besides the kind of bear, you also have to consider the circumstances.

97cf91abb98ca05a5063b3fd1265f094aa	I don't think you would normally allow '0' for the first number, which means you only have a choice of 4.    In any case, you can't allow the first number to be repeated for the second, which therefore also only has a choice of 4 (zero is allowed this time).    Therefore:  4 x 4 x 8 x 7 = 896    (if zero is allowed in the first position, the first '4' becomes a '5').    Second question: 4 x 5 x 8 x 7 = 1120  (or 1400 if zero is allowed in the first position).|`|CAjXVl6Faa	5*5*8*7 = 1400    Therefore, there are 1400 possible four digit numbers

ADDEKw29aa	To convert decimal numbers to fractions:<br>  <br>  1. consider only the digits, ignore the decimal place for the moment.<br>  In this case you have 64, and 23.<br>  <br>  2. Let n= the number of digits after the decimal point<br>  for 0.64: n=2<br>  for 2.3:  n=1<br>  <br>  3. divide the number from (1.)  by 10^n<br>  for 0.64: 10^n =10^2=100. Then divide: 64/100<br>  for 2.3: 10^n =10^1=10. Then divide: 23/10<br>  <br>  4. simplify the fraction by dividing by common factors.<br>  There are 2 ways to simplify. You might find the 2nd way a bit easier.<br>  One Way:<br>  <br>  for 64/100: I notice that both 64 and 100 are divisible by 2. It becomes 32/50. Here, again both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2; I divide them out. it becomes: 16/25. At this point the top of the fraction has no common factors with the top of the fraction and the fraction is completely simplified.<br>  for 23/10: I notice that 23 is prime. At this point the top of the fraction has no common multiples with the top of the fraction and the fraction is completely simplified.<br>  <br>  Another Way<br>  split the top and bottom of the fraction into its prime factors. <br>  <br>  for 64/100: 64=2*2*2*2*2*2, 100=5*2*5*2 (note that all numbers are prime)<br>  The fraction then becomes: 2*2*2*2*2*2/5*2*5*2<br>  after canceling the common factors, it becomes: 2*2*2*2/5*5<br>  just multiply through the top and bottom to get the answer: 16/25<br>  <br>  for 23/10: 23=23*1, 10=5*2 (note that 23 is a prime number)<br>  The fraction then becomes: 23*1/5*2 (note that 23*1=23)<br>  just multiply through the top and bottom to get the answer: 23/10<br>  <br>  Conclusion: 0.64=16/25 and 2.3=23/10|`|849889d59de721e67a08fc11dbe080adaa	0.64 = 64/100 = 32/50.<br>  <br>  2.3 = 2 3/10.|`|3D4C8HUPaa	16/25<br>  2  3/10   or 23/10

Pour que l'univers soit utile il faudrait supposer une personne extrieure  l'univers... et qui ne serait pas Dieu. En effet, mme s'il y a un Dieu, on ne peut supposer que l'univers lui manquait avant qu'il ne soit cr.    La question de l'utilit de l'univers n'a pas de sens.    Enfin, la question de l'existence d'un univers dont aucun tre n'aurait conscience n'a pas de sens non plus. Berkeley a trs bien compris que "tre, c'est percevoir ou tre per?u". Dire qu'il existe une chose dont nul ne sait rien et qui ne se conna?t pas elle-mme est une absurdit... ou plut?t cela revient  dire que cette chose n'est pas.|`|6aeeda868b8ceba98f846207a78c864aaa	Je cite : "C'est difficile de comprendre que quelque chose puisse exister sans que personne ne le voie".    C'est ce que l'esprit humain a toujours fait,  commencer par chacun d'entre nous. Quand nous apprenons quelque chose, nous nous rendons compte de quelque chose qui existait avant qu'on ne le sache.    Selon moi, c'est une erreur de penser que quelque chose n'existe uniquement si on en a conscience. Il y a une ralit indpendante de l'esprit humain. Ce n'est pas parce qu'on a pas ide de quelque chose que ce quelque chose n'existe pas. La conscience humaine n'a pas ce pouvoir de cration, elle ne peut pas faire sortir les choses du nant, elle peut juste les dcouvrir alors qu'elles taient l bien avant.    Il faut bien se rendre compte que la conscience se sert de la ralit comme support, mais en aucun cas elle ne peut gnrer la ralit. Tout se dcouvre, rien ne s'invente.    Donc avec ou sans l'Homme, l'Univers ne sert quand mme  rien.

Sans lui, les animaux pourraient simplement l'observer sur Terre.    D'un autre c?t, l'Univers possde des lois que la matire suit. C'est ce qui a men jusqu' nous et ce qui continuera partout dans l'Univers aprs que nous ayons disparu. D'une certaine manire, la matire qui ragit  son environnement en suivant les lois (chute des corps en prsence d'une masse, mission, diffusion, absorption, etc de photons, etc.) c'est observer l'Univers trs localement. ragir  une information ("prsence de masse par l"). Donc l'Homme ne serait que la dernire tape en date de l'observation de l'Univers par son propre contenu. Les autres tapes existent touours et ont ancore lieu, donc l'Homme pourrait disparaitre et l'Univers encore avoir un sens.  Bon, c'est un peu limite comme raisonnement (je ne fume pas ! :D), mais pourquoi la complexification de l'Univers n'irait pas obligatoirement vers l'mergence d'un tre capable de s'interroger sur l'Univers ?

On est au courant uniqument si un de nos 5 sens est sensible  cette chose.  2   : l'univers, cette ralit dans laquelle on est, c'est un ensemble bien particulier. Ca n'est pas TOUT ce qui peut exister. Il y a "autre chose". L'univers, c'est essentillement de l'espace, du temps et de la matire.    Le but n'est pas vraiment de le comprendre mais juste de savoir dj que c'est comme ?a. Ensuite :    Qu'y avait-il avant l'univers (espace-temps-matire-lumire)...  Comme l'univers n'est pas TOUT, il y avait autre chose avant. Mais c'est quoi ce "autre chose" ?  Autre tat d'esprit  avoir pour parler du "autre chose": il faut admettre qu'il est en dehors du temps et de l'epace. On oublie la logique dans laquelle on vit. Fin de parler d'un objet en disant "il est l  tel moment". On dira juste "il existe".     Le "autre chose" est donc indpendant du temps et de l'espace, on ne peut ni le situer, ni le voir, ni l'entendre, ni le sentir et il tait l avant l'univers et sera l aprs. Le seul indice qu'on a c'est que ?a EXISTE. Voici la rponse :  C'est la CONSCIENCE ou la pense, l'esprit, vous l'appelez comme vous voulez.    Il est donc vident que la mort n'est pas la fin. C'est la fin de la vie biologique, de la matire, de ce qu'on peut choper avec un de nos 5 sens. mais c'est pas la fin de l'EXISTENCE.  Avec ta conscience, ta pense tu peux te balader dans le temps et l'espace, imaginer que t'es en Chine au 13me sicle.  Mais avec ton corps (ta partie matrielle), tu ne peux pas.    Alors qui a cr cet lment supplmentaire dans lequel se trouve la matire, le temps et l'espace ?   QUI A CREE L'UNIVERS ?    Vous allez peut-tre me prendre pour un malade (si c'est pas encore le cas) mais l'univers n'existe pas.    --T'es bien marrant mais on veut une preuve !--.  Ok. On a vu que ce qui fait qu'on existe, c'est la conscience.    -- Oui mais mon sac rouge, je le vois alors il existe !--  Mais quand tu bouges le curseur avec ta souris, tu le vois bouger et pourtant je t'assure qu'il n'existe pas. Ce que tu vois, ce sont juste des petits points lumineux (les pixels) qui s'teignent et qui s'allument.  ------------------------------...  Par exemple, tu te mets dans le noir et t'as une torche dans chaque main. L'une allume et l'autre teinte. Et puis d'un seul coup tu teins celle qui est allume et tu allumes en mme temps celle qui tait teinte. Si un mec te regarde au loin, il va avoir l'illusion qu'il n'y a qu'une torche et qu'elle va d'une main  l'autre.  ------------------------------...  Donc ton "curseur qui bouge" ce sont des pixels qui s'allument et qui s'teignent selon des positions calculs par ton processeur qui re?oit les instructions que la souris lui donne.  Et tout ?a c'est possible parce que des mecs se sont pris la tte  crire un programme.    Revenons au sac rouge : ce ne sont que des signaux lectriques interprts pas ton cerveau. Ca marche pour la vue et les 4 autres sens.    Donc si tu me vois, ?a ne prouve pas que j'existe. C'est parce que je pense que je suis (come le dit si bien Descartes).    --Ok, ton dlire il est bien marrant mais si le cerveau est un ordinateur qui interprte des illusions, qui est le Programmateur ?---    Il sait crer  partir de rien et accomplir des actions que mme notre imagination ne peut pas se reprsenter.

Increased activity causes an increase in heart rate and an increase in blood passing through arteries and veins.

89Yf55oEaa	This is a fairly simple concept to grasp.  Evoloution depends on changes in a species genetic makeup over time.  Sexual reproduction allows for genetic changes to occur in each successive generation.  This is because sexual reproduction occurs using only half the genetic information from the male and half from the female, to put it simply.  As such this helps to increase the variabilty of the offspring in the hopes this will help the offspring to live a strong life eventually passing its genes onto the next generation.  The reason it is important is because in nature only those best suited to live in an environment are likely to survive (natural selection) and because they are likely to survive they also pass on genes to the next generation meaning that as long as the conditions in the environment are stable the next generation will be even better suited to survive in that area.  Without this variability a slight change in conditions within the envirionment could result in the extinction of that particular species because they cannot adapt.  If animals did not sexually reproduce (asexual) they pass on a complete set of their own genes to their kin.  This type of reproduction is dangerous, suppose a disease came along that was lethal to animal X but animal X has no resistance to the disease and is asexually reproducing.  Because the animal had no resistance there is no possible way its offspring has resistance and as such its genetic legacy is lost.|`|f2BRmCitaa	Mutations occur in sexual reproduction.  Mutations result in new genotypes (genetic make up), which result in new phenotypes (outward traits, e.g. hair color).  The environment acts on phenotypes and therefore will "naturally select" these new phenotypes if they make the organism more fit.  Without reproduction, none of this can occur.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps roughly!!

L46IzC8Baa	Correct me if I'm wrong because I am only an eight grader. I recently learned all the elements and I really learned many new things. YES, Mercury can go through objects including your own skin and organs.  When different companies dump out Mercury into the ocean, lakes, etc. The Mercury goes through the scales of the fishes within the body of water.  When the fishes are caught, fishermen have no idea that Mercury has affected them.  That's why when a person eats too much sea food, they can catch what they call "Mercury poisoning" It sucks. haha It's when the Mercury is eating the tissues in your stomach. Ouch much? Oh & elevation affects the boiling part of water because temperatures change throughout land.  Also, it's because the acids within salt counteract with the water in snow.  The salt atoms give off two valence electrons in it's outermost shell.  Also, some substances react with acid because of what family it's located in, in the periodic table.  For example, the first family in the periodic table are the alkali metals, they are VERY REACTIVE. In fact, they are so reactive that they are hardly ever found in their natural state. They're usually combined with other elements. Elements on the right-side of the periodic table are either not reactive, or not very reactive. Yeah, I guess you can say I'm a nerdy eight grader haha=] Message me for more information !|`|73W7ReR9aa	Put some on your hand, my darling, and I'll see you in Heaven:)

Vf2lnEH7aa	According to the National Weather Service, winter storms that meet the following criteria are called blizzards:<br>  <br>  "Sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles an hour or greater; and<br>  Considerable falling and/or blowing snow (i.e., reducing visibility frequently to less than ? mile). These conditions are expected to prevail for a period of 3 hours or longer." (NWS Glossary)<br>  <br>  The very windy conditions occur because of steep pressure gradient. Air moves from high pressure to low pressure. As the distance between isobars decreases, the wind speed increases.<br>  <br>  As for the snowfall, a lot of moisture needs to be added. This can be done by transporting a lot of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to the low pressure system via the warm conveyor belt. Strong mesoscale bands and the deformation zone are locations of heavy snowfall.

XT6W3j5Paa	The short answer to your question is that the information comes from the environment. And yes.... some things do become naturally more complex over time, and living systems are an example.<br>  <br>  The theory of evolution says that random variations generated in the genome of an organism are operated on by natural selection... that is, the variations that do the best job of promoting survival in a particular environment are passed on to offspring. In this way, the environment is "communicating" information to the genome of the organism. It is "telling" the organism, "Yes, this trait is favorable if you want to survive in my type environment."<br>  <br>  As humans, we are the product of billions of years worth of this process operating on our genome. The information in our DNA came from our environment, and all the past environments that gave rise to us. So you see, there does not need to be a designer or sentient programmer in order for complex organisms to come about. The programmer is the environment.|`|F6IOLf3Aaa	Well, look at it like this, before humans, evolution had been working on life for three billion years. That's a very long time and many, many experiments can be conducted within that time frame.  Human beings are just one type of end product of billions of years of evolutionary experimentation.<br>  <br>  Now, do things naturaly get more complex. That is a very, very good question and, as it turns out, yes they can and do through a number of different pathways.  Here's one: The laws of physics, especially quantum physics, allows for this accumulation of complexity from simple origins.  Take the origin of the universe for example, it started out in a very tiny, high-energy, low entropy state expanded from a unified beginnings and than proceeded to evolve over time with phase-transitions into a complex universe that we know today.  Now, if quantum physics allows for the universe to emerge from a simple beginning and grow in complexity, why not allow the same trend or pattern to occur in other things "within" that universe.  Take for example, the way that life unfolds: it starts out as a tiny high-energy low entropy state (just like the universe did) of fertilization, expands and grows in size and complexity from a simple single cell to a complex multicellular organism all without adding or substracting much information, (again, just like the universe).  Let's consider the origin of life and its evolution.  Life began in some unclear fashion that started with a simple protocell and grew in complexity over time. Evolution worked on that life through natural selection to lead from simple life forms to more complex ones.  Do you begin to see a pattern there?<br>  What was the origin of evolution and system change as a function of that evolution?  Once again, look to the natural source, the beginning of the universe.  In particle physics (which describe how subatomic particles behaved during the time of the origin of the universe), there's something called virtual particles. These are subatomic particles that just randomly drop out of the vacuum of space (actually matter and antimatter) and in short order, annihilate one another releasing pure energy and other subatomic particle types.  It is this pure energy that can alter the course of a normal stable atom causing it to behave in ways that may not be totally predictable. The point is, subatomic particles are routinely changing form, releasing energy, and other types of particles and then falling back into the vacuum, especially in radioactive materials.  Now, what if there was some way to scale that action up to a larger level, our 3-D realm for example.  Can you see that maybe, just maybe everything that we think we understand about our world and universe has its fundamental roots within the framework of the quantum world of particle physics?   I believe that it does.  If a person understand enough about how the subatomic world really works, they can see that our larger 3-D world follows the very same kinds of patterns.<br>  <br>  As for the question of moving from simple to complex, in biology there are things call gene amplification where a specific gene may, during translation, get repeated (2 genes where there was just 1 before) and this can have a profound effect on the biochemistry of the organism in question.  Then there are viruses that infect origanisms and bring new strands of DNA into that organism's own genome. So, that is another aveune for biology to move from simple to more complex.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want the answer to how our realm really works, study cosmology, quantum mechanics, particle physics, mathematics, biology, and classical physics.  It is all there for people who can recognize the patterns and make the right connections.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	Life naturally becomes more complex if it provides a survival advantage.

09ba948a9d03c40ca1061ea63e3fd99baa	Bactrie ou virus ?      Dans le langage courant, les virus et les bactries sont assimils  la mme chose et regroups sous le terme de microbes. La ralit est toute autre : Virus et bactries n'ont rien de commun,  commencer par la taille, celle de la bactrie est au virus ce que celle de l'lphant est  la souris (en gros, si j'ose dire).    Le mot virus signifie poison en latin !  Le virus ne fait pas partie du monde vivant car, contrairement  la bactrie, il ne respire pas, ne peut avoir de mouvement propre, il ne grandit pas et ne peut se reproduire seul. C'est une sorte de modle frontire entre le vivant et le minral.  Les virus sont constitus d'un seul type d'acide nuclique ARN ou ADN entour d'une enveloppe, ils ne peuvent se rpliquer qu' l'intrieur d'une cellule vivante en utilisant la machinerie de cette dernire. C'est cette particularit d'intgrer le matriel gntique d'une cellule qui est utilis en thrapie gnique : on introduit le gne dans la cellule en l'intgrant  un virus (inoffensif videmment).  Les virus affectant l'homme sont constitus de gnes trs proches des gnes des cellules humaines.    Toutes les bactries ne sont pas pathognes, il y a environ une centaine d'espces pathognes sur 5000. Mieux, certaines bactries vivent en symbiose avec l'homme, par exemple de nombreuses bactries dans le tube digestif sont indispensables (digestion, production de vitamine K).    En mdecine, la grande diffrence entre virus et bactries rside dans le traitement : les virus sont insensibles aux antibiotiques, ceci explique que la seule arme contre les plus dangereux rside dans la vaccination. Pour la mme raison, c'est ce qui rend redoutable l'infection par le virus du SIDA, qui a cependant l'avantage de stimuler la recherche en virologie dont les progrs en quelques annes sont spectaculaires.|`|2f8596a7b0d25c1cc7c7aefd11e8df34aa	j ai deja repondu 2 fois a cette meme question     consulte l historique des questions|`|033da32b906fb8210a2a2a5cd1c296b6aa	Microbe = micro-organisme (une cellule)  Virus = juste de l'ADN sans cellule, il a besoin d'une cellule hote pour se reproduire|`|5ae4deb60c2dc6b844c705a20f88f0a5aa	le virus dispose uniquement d'un patrimoine gntique et a besoin d'un h?te pour se reproduire tandis qu'un microbe, c'est une bactrie autonome capable de se reproduire|`|f7701c02c410af71c29f02e46c165df3aa	En tapant ta question, tu aurais pu voir que des dizaines d'autres utilisateurs ont pos exactement la mme et des dizaines d'autres y ont rpondu...

Quant au virus, il nest pas un organisme vivant au sens strict du terme: il ne peut pas se dplacer et se reproduire seul. Il doit pntrer une cellule vivante pour se multiplier.    Il y a des bactries qui peuvent tre nuisibles. Songeons, entre autres,  celles qui peuvent causer la tuberculose et la peste. Cependant, la plupart des bactries dans le corps humain sont inoffensives et sont mme bien utiles. Par exemple, des milliers dentre elles vivent sur la peau et empchent les bactries nuisibles de sinstaller, dautres se trouvent dans les intestins et nous aident  digrer.

igV08pkSaa	To work out the bond angles or shape of molecule you need to:  Add up the number of outer electrons on the central atom and the number of electrons contributed from each atom that bonds to it. Then take into account any charges on the molecule. Finally divide by 2 to work out the number of bonds.    NH3     N has 5 outer electrons. Add 3 for the hydrogens. Total = 4 pairs.  CCl4   C has 4 outer electrons. Add 4 for the chlorines. Total = 4 pairs.  H2S    S has 6 outer electrons. Add 2 for the hydrogens. Total = 4 pairs.  ie. they are all based on the tetrahedral structure.    The difference is that, although they all have 4 electron pairs around the central atom, some are not bonding pairs because they don't have enough atoms to bond with. CCl4 has 4 bonding pairs. NH3 has 3 bonding pairs and a lone pair. H2S has 2 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs. Lone pairs repel each other slightly more than bonding pairs. Hence the bond angles will be:   CCl4 approx 109.5  NH3 approx 107  H2S approx 105|`|AA12119511	they are all sp3 atoms.. and are all planar.|`|2a9a8e9419ba9ea9aca8820c51368ca1aa	Because If you create lewis dot structures for all of them , they all bond together sharing electrons making stable electron pairs of 8 and stable outer shells.

ZA8jGhtQaa	Good question.  Every year, thousands of patents are granted on electrical/electronic circuits.  Indeed, it is one of the most common types of patents.    The decision to pursue patents, which kind and how much to spend is a business decision that merits consideration and planning.    Although you can do it yourself you will probably regret it later. But then, you could spend $25k+ with a patent attorney and regret it, too. Patent services are like medical care. Cutting costs now can result in huge costs later. Often, you won't know about the problems until later, and by that time the situation is irreversible. The cost for a typical US patent, from start to finish, is typically between $10 and $30,000.    The patent process is like a tennis match. To get a normal, US "utility" application prepared and filed ("serving the tennis ball") you are probably looking at spending $5-20k on an attorney depending on the kind of invention.    About 1-4 years after you serve, the patent office will return the serve. You will have additional costs for hitting the ball back. When the patent office agrees to grant the patent, there are additional costs for the final processing. All told, after filing the application, the follow-on costs are typically in the $1,500-15,000 range (depending on lots of factors).    The US patent process typically takes 1-7 years. The current published average is almost 3 1/2 years.    There's also the option of an informal provisional application, which typically runs $2,000 or less. The provisional expires in 12 months and there's no tennis match. Provisionals generally don't provide much protection, but they are great to get "patent pending", to establish a date of invention, and to set deadlines for making a formal application.    Lots of people like to file provisionals to get their feet wet and during initial market tests. If it looks like the product will sell then they decide whether to pursue a real patent.    You might also want to consider pursuing a design patent. This costs about $3,000 to start and issues in 12-18 months. Design patents are supposed to be for the ornamental/ artistic/ non-functional aspects of products, but lots of people use them as a cheap way to protect a product's appearance.    A "prior art" search should be one of your first steps in the patent process. In the US, the prior art mostly includes (a) any patent filed prior to your invention, (b) any publication (e.g, magazine article, web page), published more than one year prior to when you file your patent application, (c) any public use, sale or offer to sale of the invention by you or anyone else in the US more than one year before you filed your patent application. There are some other categories -- the patent laws are filled with gotchas. From these three categories, you can see that even if someone else hasn't gotten a patent on your invention (or if they did and it expired), you still might not get a patent either.    The patent law also has gotchas on deadlines. The US and foreign laws favor early filings. Tread carefully here. If you file the application too late, you might lose US and/or foreign rights. Most foreign countries have "absolute novelty" rules, which bar patenting if there has been any kind of disclosure of the invention anywhere. The US has a one-year grace period on the absolute novelty rule. The rules are quite complex so don't rely on this simplification. The safest approach is usually to file your patents prior to any kind of public disclosure or attempt at commercialization.    Now, back to searching. Before you spend the money to hire someone else, try doing some searching on your own. Use a search engine such as Yahoo to see if there is (or was) anything out there like your invention, or articles which are on point. You should also use the patent database of the US Patent & Trademark Office www.uspto.gov to search issued patents and published applications. Most people search and find nothing, but at least it's a good start.    While there are still some professional prior art searchers, it seems like most people just have their patent attorney do the search. It is usually more efficient and accurate.    Be sure to pick a patent attorney who has some familiarity with your technology. We patent attorneys usually specialize. You probably don't want a software expert searching on a new pharmaceutical.    Patentability requires that your invention be new, and also that it is something more than an obvious variation or modification of the prior art. The US courts and the USPTO are getting tougher on the obviousness standard.    These estimates are budgeting guidelines based upon having a competent patent attorney doing the work, and include the government fees and other costs. You can look up the government fees at www.uspto.gov    Though you only asked about patents, you should ask your IP attorney about copyrights and trademarks, too. Many products can be protected by copyright and trademark in addition to patent.    Hope this helps.

eUKOcx8baa	Both 4 and 1/8 are correct answers and the only answers.    Solution:    The trick is to know this "conversion of log-base" formula:    log_a (y) = log_b (y) / log_b(a)    Then you can do this:    6 log_x (2) = log_x (2^6)  = log_2 (2^6)/log_2(x) = 6/log_2(x)    Now write y = log_2(x). Substituting this into the original equation, you get    y + 1 = 6/y    This is a quadratic with two roots: y = 2 and -3.    The corresponding x is then equal to    x = 2^y; that is 2^2 = 4 or 2^{-3} = 1/8.    Both are correct.|`|VrjFRmsxaa	log x (base 2) = 1/(log 2 (base x)) so...    log x (base 2) + 1 = 6/(log x (base 2))    Assume now all logs are base 2:    (log x)^2 + log x -6 = 0    say that A=log x    A^2 + A - 6 = 0  (quadratic)    A = 2  or A= -3     so A=2 and now log x (base 2) = 2, so x=4  or A= -3, and x= 1/8|`|Lx3FOlJQaa	well i got the ans as 1/8 or 4  log x to base 2 + 1 = 6 / (log x to base 2)    take log x to base 2 = y  so y + 1 = 6 / y  and y^2 + y - 6 = 0    so y = -3,2  so log x to base 2 = y  =-3 or 2  so 2^-3 = 1/8 = x  or 2^2 = 4 = x  got ur ans  hope it helped!|`|eQ3IU9sHaa	logx base2+1= log64 basex   "                   " = log64 base2 / logx base2   Using substitution, let logx base2=a  hence,   a+1= 6/a                a2 +a-6=0    solve this quadratic equation. a=-3,2            logx base2 =-3, 2   so x=4, 1/8    hope it helps.

0c04750cfaaf47ee7c15a1d3438d2494aa	The most obvious cause of a change in sea level is the amount of water locked up in polar ice. For example, with Global Warming and melting ice caps the UN's latest estimate is that sea levels will rise by somewhere between 17 and 34 inches by the year 2100.    Geological events that alter sea level will be more to do with changing the shape of the ocean bed. For example an earthquake which raises the ocean floor by 2 feet will raise the sea by the same amount. Obviously this would only occur if all the Worlds ocean floors were raised but the raising of one area of sea floor will raise the average sea level, if only by a tiny amount. Over long periods of time this could add up to a significant alteration is sea level. Similarly, a drop in level of the ocean floor would provide a greater volume in which was contained the same amount of sea water to the sea level would fall.    Similar effects would be seen for the growth of under-sea volcanos, tectonic movements reducing the overall volume of the ocean bed, or landslides from the land into the sea, all of which would increase sea level by displacing the water.    Sea level would fall by tectonic movements which increased the available volume of ocean floor, the destruction of volcanos by catastrophic explosion such as at Krakatoa or the sea breaking into new low-lying areas of land by erosion of coastal barriers (either natural or man-made)|`|gi9ixnr8aa	Tides

In this case, you are only protected by whatever the heat conductivity of the layer is.    Adding layers makes the heat have a very thin layer of air that it must transfer through by convection, and then the next layer is the one emitting heat into the surrounding air. Each layer adds another step the heat must go through to escape your body. These steps slow down the heat exchange between your body and the air.    Imagine playing the gossip game in school - the more people in the chain, the longer it takes the message to get to the last person. This is analogous to the heat exchange between layers of clothing.|`|anaDfv8Qaa	For one they will keep you warm and two if it gets a little warmer on that day you can start taking off layers to be comfortable.

8gN23OAPaa	Deimos and Phobos|`|uxehuiMjaa	phobos and daemos|`|h07mqlPhaa	Asaph Hall was about to give up his frustrating search for a Martian moon one August night in 1877, but his wife Angelina urged him on. He discovered Deimos the next night, and Phobos six nights after that.    Ninety-four years later, NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft got a much better look at the two moons from its orbit around Mars. The dominant feature on Phobos, it found, was a crater 10 km (6 miles) wide - nearly half the width of the moon itself. It was given Angelina's maiden name: Stickney.    Hall named the moons for the mythological sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god, Mars. Phobos means fear or panic (think "phobia"), and Deimos means flight (as in running after an overwhelming defeat). Fitting names for the sons of a war god.    Mars' moons are among the smallest in the solar system. Phobos is a bit larger than Deimos, and orbits only 6,000 km (3,700 miles) above the Martian surface. No known moon orbits closer to its planet. It whips around Mars three times a day, while the more distant Deimos takes 30 hours for each orbit. Phobos is gradually spiraling inward, drawing about 1.8 meters closer to the planet each century. Within 50 million years, it will either crash into Mars or break up and form a ring around the planet.    To someone standing on the Mars-facing side of Phobos, Mars would take up a large part of the sky. And people may one day do just that. Scientists have discussed the possibility of using one of the Martian moons as a base from which astronauts could observe the Red Planet and launch robots to its surface, while shielded by miles of rock from cosmic rays and solar radiation for nearly two-thirds of every orbit.       Deimos           Like Earth's Moon, Phobos and Deimos always present the same face to their planet. Both are lumpy, heavily-cratered and covered in dust and loose rocks. They are among the darker objects in the solar system. The moons appear to be made of carbon-rich rock mixed with ice and may be captured asteroids.    Phobos has only 1/1000th as much gravitational pull as Earth. A 150-pound (68 kg) person would weigh two ounces (68 grams) there. Yet NASA's Mars Global Surveyor has shown evidence of landslides, and of boulders and dust that fell back down to the surface after being blasted off the moon by meteorites.|`|AA11929685	Phobos and Deimos - oddly shaped|`|qhO78kW6aa	phobos and deimos|`|AA11743017	Phobos and Deimos   (in greek, fear and devil) descibed by Sir Percival Hall|`|3f573edfebb558b3d5840168b36252edaa	Phobos and Deimos.    Phobos:Phobos ("FOH bus") is the larger and innermost of Mars' two moons. Phobos is closer to its primary than any other moon in the solar system, less than 6000 km above the surface of Mars. It is also one of the smallest moons in the solar system.             orbit:    9378 km from the center of Mars          diameter: 22.2 km (27 x 21.6 x 18.8)          mass:     1.08e16 kg  In Greek mythology, Phobos is one of the sons of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus). "phobos" is Greek for "fear" (the root of "phobia").     Discovered 1877 August 18 by Hall; photographed by Mariner 9 in 1971, Viking 1 in 1977, and Phobos in 1988.      Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius. Thus it rises in the west, moves very rapidly across the sky and sets in the east, usually twice a day. It is so close to the surface that it cannot be seen above the horizon from all points on the surface of Mars.     And Phobos is doomed: because its orbit is below synchronous altitude tidal forces are lowering its orbit (current rate: about 1.8 meters per century). In about 50 million years it will either crash onto the surface of Mars or (more likely) break up into a ring. (This is the opposite effect to that operating to raise the orbit of the Moon.)     Phobos and Deimos may be composed of carbon-rich rock like C-type asteroids. But their densities are so low that they cannot be pure rock. They are more likely composed of a mixture of rock and ice. Both are heavily cratered. New images from Mars Global Surveyor indicate that Phobos is covered with a layer of fine dust about a meter thick, similar to the regolith on the Earth's Moon.      The Soviet spacecraft Phobos 2 detected a faint but steady outgassing from Phobos. Unfortunately, Phobos 2 died before it could determine the nature of the material; water is the best bet. Phobos 2 also returned a few images (right).     The most prominent feature on Phobos is the large crater named Stickney, the maiden name of Hall's wife (above). Like Mimas' crater Herschel (on a smaller scale) the impact that created Stickney must have almost shattered Phobos. The grooves and streaks on the surface were probably also caused by the Stickney impact.      Phobos and Deimos are widely believed to be captured asteroids. There is some speculation that they originated in the outer solar system rather than in the main asteroid belt.     Phobos and Deimos may someday be useful as "space stations" from which to study Mars or as intermediate stops to and from the Martian surface; especially if the presence of ice is confirmed.     Deimos: Deimos ("DEE mos") is the smaller and outermost of Mars' two moons. It is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system.              orbit:    23,459 km from Mars           diameter: 12.6 km (15 x 12.2 x 11)           mass:     1.8e15 kg     In Greek mythology, Deimos is one of the sons of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus); "deimos" is Greek for "panic".     Discovered 1877 August 12 by Hall, photographed by Viking 1 in 1977.      Deimos and Phobos are composed of carbon-rich rock like C-type asteroids and ice. Both are heavily cratered.     Deimos and Phobos are probably asteroids perturbed by Jupiter into orbits that allowed them to be captured by Mars.

HIV (the virus which causes AIDS) is a retrovirus.|`|9a1b72dd63fec22b15002dec73f9e02aaa	A family of viruses distinguished by three characteristics: (1) genetic information in ribonucleic acid (RNA); (2) virions possess the enzyme reverse transcriptase; and (3) virion morphology consists of two proteinaceous structures, a dense core and an envelope that surrounds the core. Some viruses outside the retrovirus family have some of these characteristics, but none has all three.|`|bef5771272fb281021826859a05c2e47aa	It's a virus that uses RNA to copy instead of DNA.|`|HAL6sZARaa	A retrovirus is a kind of virus that has RNA as its nucleic acid. It also has a DNA polymerase (also called inverse transcriptase) that it uses when it invades a host cell. What they do is enter a host cell, then use the transcriptase to translate its RNA into DNA that then inserts itself into the cell's nucleus and makes the host cell produce viral particles.

Mm4nBY8maa	Well, it depends on the type of frog. It isn't that great to leave a frog without food, but giving them too much food at once can be bad for them. Try giving them food that you usually do, but see if you can dust the ones you give to it before you live with nutrient powder.    Thanks. Anyway I'm not particularly familiar with mostly aquatic species, but you could try putting in amphibian food pellets (sort of like fish food), as long they're not the kind that disintegrates fast. The two problems with that is that pellets don't move, and eventually sink. However, if you put just the right amount in, the frog should have enough to eat. But don't put in too much or the water conditions will suffer. Hope this was helpful.|`|AA10740247	you better search for info on froggs ,you appear to know nothing about them ,there are thousands of kinds of frogs   check wikipedia.

AA10198074	First you want to set up your variables.  X is going to be the number of units of the first grain and Y is going to be the number of units of the second grain.      Now you are going to have an equation for both Protein and Iron    Protein -  2x + 4y = 10    Iron-  5x + 1y = 16    Now you have two unknowns and two equations!  If you need help solving these, then continue reading (but at least try it on your own first).            Okay, here is the solution:  If         2x + 4y = 10  Then  x = 5 - 2y (subtract 4y from both sides and divide by 2)    So 5x + 1y = 16 can be written as  5(5 - 2y) + 1y = 16 or  25 - 10y + 1y = 16 which is simplified down to  -9y = -9 so  y = 1    Plug that into one of your two equations and you get x = 3    So you have 3 units of the first grain and 1 unit of the second|`|kNP7Anrxaa	1) 2x + 4y = 10  2) 5x + 1y = 16    (x = number of units of the first kind of grain, y = number of units for the second kind of grain)    rearrange 2:  y = 16 - 5x    insert that into 1:  2x + 4(16 - 5x) = 10  2x + 64 - 20x = 10  64-18x = 10  -18x = -54  x = 3    take this value for x and plug it into equation 2 (tho equation 1 would also work)    5*3 + y = 16  15 + y = 16  y = 1    ANSWER:  so, you will need 3 units of the first grain type and 1 unit of the second type of grain|`|1tgCC96caa	1st contains 2p+5i  2nd contains 4p+1i    we need 10p+16i    since 10=6+4  we try adding three units of 1st grain  that contains 6p+15i  when added to one unit of 2nd grain we get 10p+16i    so we mix them 3:1    DONE|`|Rys4Zc7Uaa	3 of the first one and 1 of the 2nd    First grain:  Protein 2*3=6  Iron 5*3=15    Second grain:  Protein 4*1=4  Iron 1*1=1    First + Second:  Protein 6+4 = 10  Iron 15+1= 16
HCcB2zrraa	Something easy?  How about a display of static vs kinetic friction?  take a board and mount it on a verticle post with several height adjsutments on one end.  Leave the other end of the board on the desk.  take a flat block of wood and lay it on the board.  When you are at lower angles the board should stay still.  If you tap the board downward a bit, it will slide a little and stop.  As you increase the angle you may find that the board continues to slide all the way once started, but does not slide on its own if set in place.  This is because static friction is greater than kinetic friction.  At some angle the force of gravity will outstrip the resistance even of static friction and the block will always slide.|`|6BQlxNRhaa	perpetual motion.........u get a toy car motor, a small electrical generator, some wires......u make the circuit so that the motor poweres the generator that creates electricity to power the motor......

1Wc2cnifaa	I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for cos it's quite a general question.    Anyway, based on my own work, we all know HIV causes AIDS is a disease of the  virus attacking the immune system.  An example of an investigatory project is to investigate how the virus subverts the immune system and brings it to heel.  One wuold examine viral gene products, surface molecules, and then see what their functions are.
1Wc2cnifaa	Referring to the same source as Virginia:    -------------    Lysogenic Cycle    The viral DNA becomes integrated into the bacterial DNA after infection. It is replicated along with the host DNA when the host reproduces. The viral DNA is referred to as a prophage.    Certain environmental factors (example- UV radiation or chemicals) will trigger the prophage to begin a lytic cycle.    ----------    There is nothing in that that suggests that everytime the host replicates, the virus enters a lytic cycle.    A bacteriophage has 2 cycles of life, the lytic and the lysogenic.  The lytic cycle is where it infects a bacterium and then takes over the bacterial processes to make many more copies of itself.    The lysogenic cycle is where the virus infects the bacteria, but ends up integrating its genome into the bacterial genome as a PROPHAGE.  The prophage will be 'inactive' and dormant, and will be replicated by the bacteria everytime the bacteria divides.  So if the bacteria divides, the virus divides, 1:1 ratio.  Should some stimulus occur, such as UV irradiation, the prophage may become activated (because the late genes are no longer suppresed by the early genes due to UV irradiation) and then commence into the lytic cycle.    I use the bacteriophage as an example, because it is the easiest to explain, some mammallian viruses do the same thing as well, such as HIV.  That is why some HIV infected people remain healthy until the integrated HIV provirus gets activated and starts killing the lymphocytes.  But I digress    THE ANSWER IS "A"|`|BoPtznnRaa	B
1Wc2cnifaa	The HIV expresses surface glycoproteins called gp120 and gp 41...collectively known as the gp120/41 complex.      GP41 binds to CD4 on CD4 T cells and/or macrophages and dendritic cells.  This will induce a conformational change which enables Gp120 to bind to CCR5 or CXCR4 and causes internalisation of virus by membrane fusion.|`|rTNagaZiaa	I think you might be looking for an experimental approach. I'd begin with immunoprecipitation. I'd purify the HIV receptors of interest. Add these proteins to WBC cell lysates / solubilized membrane proteins etc. and add an Ab against the HIV receptor.

mNDlP85Taa	Plant parasites and diseases will generally not affect a human being.  Parasites tend to be specific to species or at least restricted within a kingdom.  Bacteria are usually specific to an organism and are not readily transmitted to other organisms without genetic modification.  That being said, there are organisms present on the plant that probably do not affect it that can affect you.  So plant parasites that get into your bloodstream would normally be taken care of by your immune system and should present no ill effects.|`|6g5NIjjLaa	I heard for zoonosis,but did not hear for plant-onosis !|`|8YaWb9ilaa	yess.they can harm us. they do try to invade us. byt many times our immune system do nt allow them to do so.|`|1Wc2cnifaa	On contrary, most microbes are NOT specific.  The biggest number of infections are still caused by bacteria, and most of them aren't too fussed about who they're growing in, as long as they get nutrients (or course, there are some species specific bacteria)    E coli can survive in the soil...and since that's where you get most of your plants from, including the bitter gourd, if you ate one contaminated gourd which isn't cleaned/cooked properly, you WILL get sick (assuming it's a disease causing E coli).  As for parasites, most of them are species specific...but I'd worry more about the bacteria than parasites if you're not cooking it properly|`|lKXLaJ0Taa	No, most micro-organisms and parasites are species specific.  There are however, exceptions.  Most of which you have probably heard of:  equine encephalitis, swine flu, some tapeworms, avian (bird) flu and of course fungi (including yeast).  There are other micro-organisms that use other animals as vectors, but since the other animal doesn't get sick, it doesn't count according to your question.  An example of this would be malaria or rocky mountain spotted fever.      There is a parasite that grows (infects) a betel nut grown in Guam that has been known to cause cancer in humans.  But you cannot assume that any micro-organism that infects a plant will necessarily be harmful to humans.  In any case, if you ate the gourd, the parasite would have entered your digestive tract, not your bloodstream.|`|54gRWOTtaa	depends on the parasite. chances are no since your physiology is so different from the plants. if the parasite is producing a toxin that is toxic to you as well and you eat the plant, you may get sick.|`|0wTz3z0Kaa	if u eat it, u will get sick

The cell membrane has tiny channels which end in a duct or dead end. These are called Pinocytic canals. Substances pass down these and are incorporated into a small vesicle at the end. In this way the cell gains substances from outside the cell. It is an example of Endocytosis. A larger scale version known as "Phagocytosis" or "cell eating" is used to take in larger substances. This method is used by white blood cells to surround and digest bacteria. I suspect a Pinocytosome may be another name for a pinocytic vesicle but I have never heard of it.|`|JJFxuooCaa	pinocytosome is the activity of the cell for taking nutriment which is liquid. this drop of liquid is covered with a membrane. all of the cells have the ability to make pinocytosome. some hormones and big substances that  consist of big molecules are being taken inside our body by this way.
1Wc2cnifaa	Parasites such as Taenia spp. contain heat-stable, acid-resistant proteins which enables them to survive the stomach acidity.  Once they enter the intestines, they are safe from the acid anyway.    Recent studies in rats show that Taenia are also able to suppress acid production from gastric cells|`|Bfgm6vW9aa	Some of the Taenia ingested with food from contaminated meat do so as spores. The case of the spore is extremely resistant an allows the organism to remain protected until it is in suitable conditions, e.g. has passed through the stomach and entered the small intestine. In this way the worm does not need to worry about the extreme acidity of the stomach, in fact this often stimulates the spore into developing and releasing the embryonic worm.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Calcium is the ion required.  Cross bridges are the extensions on myosin that bind to actin in the contraction of muscle.  Binding of myosin to actin is controlled by two proteins, troponin and tropomyosin, on actin.  Tropomyosin ordinarily blocks the binding sites on the actin (and troponin "locks"  it in place) so the myosin cannot bind to it.  When the muscle is stimulated to contract, an action potential causes calcium to be released from the sarcomplasmic reticulum.  The calcium binds to troponin, "unlocking" it, and this allows the tropomyosin to move away from the binding site, so the actin and myosin can interact, and the muscle contracts.
t5Nrj6Txaa	As you know, the density of hot air is less than that of colder air.  By changing the density, one also changes the index of refraction of a medium, for example, glass is much more dense than air, and has a much higher index of refraction.  What all this means is that light rays are bent by passing through a medium of varying density.  This results in some areas where light is focused and others where it is more diffuse.

EURFnnPQaa	Hey there!    The exclamation mark in mathematics, is a factorial symbol.     By the definition of factorial,    n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)...*3*2*1.    There are also some interesting properties of factorials.    n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)...*3*2*1. -->  n!=n*(n-1)!.    This is called the Recursive Formula.    Suppose, we want to find the value of 5!.    We can use the formula to find it.    5!=5*(5-1)! -->  5!=5*4! -->  5!=5*4*(4-1)! -->  5!=20*3! -->  5!=20*3*(3-1)! -->  5!=60*2! -->  5!=60*2*(2-1)! -->  5!=120*1! -->  5!=120*1 -->  5!=120    So 5!=120.

AA11033593	They are of same group.    Going downwards, the elements have bigger atoms, as each successive element has an extra electron shell.  As the size of atom increases, the valence electrons are further away from the positive nucleus, resulting in increasing tendency to lose the electron.  This increases the reactivity.  More reactive -> less stable      However, Ge is a metal while Si is a non-metal.    But I think it's right. ye. (: goodlucky.

First you need to draw a diagram which will look like a right triangle...on leg will be 300ft, the other will be the distance of the kite from the person in the horizontal direction and the hypothenuse will be the distance overall. (lets say horizontal distance is x and overall is y).  Then youre given that dx/dt=25ft/sec  And you need to find dy/dt when y=500ft  From the triangle y^2=x^2 +300^2  Dif. that:  2y*dy/dt=2x*dx/dt  then dy/dt=x/y*dx/dt  Now if y=500, x=400 so  dy/dt=400/500*25=20ft/sec    Should be right...
f03556b4c1f094c250a6010963ca23eaaa	The range can be any number from negative infinity to infinity. This is true because there are no restrictions on the side of y, nor are there any restrictions on the x side. You probably won't understand this unless you know something about the restrictions in domains and ranges.     Let me put it this way: It is true that x can be any number because it is what you plug in. If x can be any number (and there are no radical signs, absolute values, or anything special) then y can also be any number. The range of a function is the range that y can be, the domain is the range of x.    Now, an easier way is to view this function as a linear equation (since it actually is linear) by making it y=(1/3)x-6.  I assume that you understand that this is an equation in the slope-intercept form. Therefore, the one-third is the slope while 6 is the y-intercept. This is a linear equation and linear equations always (except with absolute values) have an infinite range and domain.     I hope that this will analyze everything you want to know. Good luck!|`|36b8cda73cd16e094b6c982a2986c140aa	For such a function the denominator cannot be zero (x/0 is undefined), so 3x-6 =/= 0, x =/= 2  So its all numbers except for x=2|`|E6CeS4Vgaa	The range is the potential output values, so it kind of depends on what your inputs are. Assuming inputs of all real numbers, there are really no restrictions on the range of the function described as there are no values where your graph deflects or contains a hole. So, the range of your function is all real numbers.

NFDFior4aa	Let's try some smaller exponents to see if you can see a pattern.  Let's use even exponents because the exponents in the problems are even.  And we'll use the same exponent since the exponents in the problem are the same.  3^2-2^2 = 9-4=5  3^4-2^4 = 81-16 = 65  3^6-2^6 = 729 -64=665  3^8-2^8= 6561-256=6305  Do we need to go further?

evaIjWqWaa	La viscosit de la salive est influence par sa teneur en amylase.  Cette enzyme qui permet d'hydrolyser l'amidon lors de la mastication est synthtise essentiellement durant cette priode.  En dehors, des priodes o l'on s'alimente, la salive est naturellement pauvre en amylase donc peu visqueuse.    @ Lougorp.  Attention, tu ne ma?trise pas bien la notion de pH !  Un pH alcalin est un pH basique c'est--dire compris entre 7 et 14.  Les valeurs de pH que tu mentionnes sont acides !  En ralit, le pH de la salive est proche de la neutralit avec un pH d'environs 7,2-7,4 donc trs lgrement alcalin.  En fait, le pH de la salive parotidienne que tu mentionne corresponds au pH  dbit lent, lorsque les glandes parotides sont au repos.  Lorsqu'elles sont active, le pH est alcalin, proche de 8.  La diminution d'acidit est due  l'augmentation de la concentration en lectrolytes librs par ces glandes.  Soit donc vigilant quand tu modifie un texte pour le coller sur Q/R.

A l'heure du djeuner, par exemple, notre cerveau envoie,  travers le systme nerveux, des signaux aux glandes salivaires pour qu'elles augmentent la production de salive   Nous produisons chaque jour environ 800 ml de salive mais le dbit salivaire varie selon l'age, l'tat psychique ou encore le moment de la journe. Elle peut aller jusqu' 1,5 litres on salive plus debout ou couch, moins assis, plus en hiver quen t et ...trs peu la nuit.    La salive est issue des glandes salivaires principales, elle est lgrement acide, son pH varie selon la glande salivaire qui l'a secrte :  1 La salive parotidienne, scrte par les glandes parotides et dverse dans la bouche par le canal de Stnon est insipide et inodore au moment de la scrtion. Sa densit est d'environ 1,006. Elle est alcaline PH 5,5 et contient une quantit notable de carbonate de chaux en dissolution; elle transforme la fcule en dextrine et en sucre.  2 La salive sous-maxillaire, provenant de la glande sous-maxillaire, est fournie par le canal de Wharton; elle est moins fluide et un peu moins dense que la prcdente, mais aussi alcaline PH 6,0.  3 La salive sublinguale et bucco-labiale se distingue des prcdentes par sa grande viscosit; elle sert  agglutiner les parties du bol alimentaire et favorise la dglutition.son PH est 6,5.  4 La salive mixte, c'est--dire forme par le mlange des prcdentes, contient leurs principes constituants et un ferment soluble, la ptyaline ou diastase animale, qui jouit de la proprit de transformer l'amidon en glucose.    C?t composition, la salive est un mlange deau, de protines, des sels minraux, des anticorps, des facteurs de croissance, des substances antibactriennes, et pas moins d'un million de bactries et autres germes par millilitre.    De la diction  la digestion...   La salive est une prcieuse allie des grands bavards : elle lubrifie les surfaces muqueuses et dentaires et permet de sexprimer en toute facilit. Autre r?le de la salive : la prparation  la digestion. Mlange aux aliments que nous machons, la salive forme ? le bol alimentaire ?, cest--dire une sorte de boulette qui glissera facilement dans notre ?sophage. De plus, laction chimique de la salive transforme certains composants des aliments pour les rendre plus facilement assimilables par notre organisme. Il sagit en fait dune vritable prdigestion !     En passant par la protection...   La salive participe activement  lquilibre et  la protection de la cavit bucco-dentaire. Ses proprits anti-bactriennes limitent la prolifration des bactries et liminent les micro-organismes indsirables. Ici, la salive agit comme un poste frontire qui contr?le toutes les entres et lutte contre les invasions microbiennes.    ...Jusqu la rparation   Non contente de faciliter la diction, la digestion et la protection de lquilibre de notre bouche, la salive a galement des talents de rparateur.   Riche en carbonates et en phosphates, la salive rgule le pH de notre bouche en s'attaquant aux acides produits par la dgradation des aliments dans notre bouche. Or, on sait que ces acides sont directement responsables des caries dentaires. Mais elle ne se contente pas d'pargner ainsi  nos dents les violentes attaques des sucres transforms. Elle aide aussi  rparer les dgats, pour peu qu'ils ne soient pas trop importants. En effet, elle contient des ions qui contribuent  la reminralisation de l'mail, lorsqu'il est encore au tout premier stade de dminralisation. Pour toutes ces raisons, la salive est considre comme un rempart anti-caries.    En esprant avoir rpondu  ta question    Amicalement..
xqvZglmKaa	Absolument.  C'est assez facile  dmontrer :    Un vhicule de masse M (p.ex. 500 kg) qui roule a une vitesse v (p.ex. 20 m/s ou 72 km/h) possde une certaine nergie cintique :  E = 1/2 M.v2 = 1/2 . 500 . 202 = 100 kJ (kilojoules)    Si j'augmente la masse du vhicule en y ajoutant des passagers de masse m (p.ex. 200 kg) et que je le fais rouler  la mme vitesse, l'nergie cintique devient  E = 1/2 (M+m).v2 = 1/2 . 700 . 202 = 140 kJ    Donc, plus la voiture est charge, plus il faut lui fournir de l'nergie pour la propulser  une certaine vitesse.

Toutes ces donnes innombrables releves tous les jours et mme plusieurs fois par jour sont donnes  manger  des gros ordinateurs (quasiment les plus gros qui existent !!!) et on en dduit les futures directions de vent, les volutions de pression etc. Bien que ce soient les plus gros ordinateurs du monde, ils mettent quand mme plusieurs heures  faire tous les calculs, tellement il y a de donnes  traiter et de calculs  faire.  Collecter et stocker toutes ces mesures demande de grosses organisations.  Programmer les ordinateurs pour les simulations informatiques du fonctionnement de l'atmosphre demande de longues heures d'ingnieurs informaticiens, d'ingnieurs mtorologues etc.  Acheter ces ordinateurs co?te horriblement cher.  Le rsultat, ce sont des prvisions globales, pas trop trop prcises  petite dimension (?a va pour un dpartement par exemple, mais pour une ville c'est plus difficile et il faudrait multiplier la longueur des calculs par 5 ou 10 pour y arriver. Sauf que ?a ne sert  rien d'avoir le mercredi les prvisions pour le lundi d'avant :) )|`|ZDMOCj2yaa	Dites donc mon vieux vous posez toute la question de la prvision du temps en gnral et ?a demande des annes et des annes d'tudes!|`|mbSfroUJaa	c'est pas de la magie!!!  c'est comme quand on voit les arbres perdre leurs feuilles, on sait que c'est bient?t l't ou la saison sche pour l'afrique.|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Il y a des formules qui font intervenir plusieurs variables pour simuler les donnes mtrologiques sur plusieurs jours et ce en utilisant des bases de donnes historiques des annes prcdentes.
2wDJmluOaa	en el caso del agua (peroxido de hidrogeno) existe un refractometro especifico con esa escala, mide el % de peroxido en muestras puras  en el caso del hipoclorito puedes determinarlo indirectamente mediante un espectrofotometro o un colorimetro leyendo la concentracion de cloro en la muestra|`|gQhLAGv0aa	Agua Oxigenada al 50%  se puede averiguar adicionando Sulfato manganoso y azida sodica en medio alcalino, y por ende precipitando el hidroxido manganoso que absorbe el oxigeno pasando a la forma manganica.    Luego la adicion de acido disuelve el floculo producido, formndose la sal manganosa y desprendindose iodo que se valora con tiosulfato..      Para empezar con la segunda pregunta, hay que saber que el cloro reacciona con el agua por lo que  pH   pH 5-6            HOCl  pH 6 -7.5        HOCL y algo de ClO-  pH  7.5            50% HOCl y  50% ClO-  pH  7.5 - 9         ClO- y algo de HOCl  pH > 9                  ClO- casi enteramente    Los ensayos a contimuacion determinan el Cloro libre.    Determinaciones cualitativas pueden ser  1. Almidon soluble e ioduro de potasio como reactivo  2. Diclorhidrato de ortolidina    Determinaciones cuantitativas  3. Utilizando el reactivo ortolidina y el instrumento comparador Hellige o similares  4. Utilizando el reactivo ortolidina y comparando el color producido por la muestra con una escala patron.  5. Utilizando un mtodo llamado OTA (ortolidina - arsenito), que permite la diferenciacin del cloro residual libre del cloro residual combinado.

None occurs in the stomach (because of the composition of the walls of that chamber) although a lot of digestion occurs.  More digestion occurs in the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches or so of the small intestine.  The two following parts of the small intestine (which is called small, by the way, only because of the diameter of the "tube" - it is actually a large organ), the jejunum and ileum.  Only the last little bit of absorption of water occurs in the next section of the digestive system, the large intestine - much less than occurs in the small intestine.|`|SSM3u4l4aa	The most absorptive? I am going to say the stomach because it absorbs the fluid you take in and distributes it where it needs to go.|`|KJLHLTeDaa	I think its the small intestine... or maybe the liver since it absorbs nutrients..but im not so sure.    good question though! :)|`|42e24d30d694d98b72fad7d6ff4adf6baa	these guys are all wrong.    the large intestines.|`|5ww38duNaa	Small intestine.
