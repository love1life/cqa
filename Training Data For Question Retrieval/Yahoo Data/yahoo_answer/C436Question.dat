20090308031515AAjsrYy	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	When planting potatoes does the trench system allow more growth than say boring a hole big enough for the seed?	I heard where the more soil dug out can get necessary bacteria destroyed when the sunlight hits it, that's why farmed land is dead and needs oil dependant/based fertiliser on it to grow anything.      My garden is organic and I grow fairly successfully each year but I have a small part shady garden so I would not think it matters much about digging trenches I grow several but if I could max' them would be good.       I use home-made compost and get taters the size of yore head (nearly).       The question is........Dig or Not? Any thoughts from experience?   I just wondered if they need a dug space to grow into.

20090308033026AAtLH0A	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	New seeds, where to plant for garden.?	I live in Central North Texas west of Fort Worth on my own little Rock of Gibraltar.  My south facing back yard has one tree.  So I have full sun (10am to 5pm), partial, mottled sun (all day) and 2 hour morning sun only (the house shades this spot).      Last year, my tomato (full sun) yield was poor as were my green peppers (full sun).  I can't get grass to grow back there, much less veggies.  I compost for healthy dirt, but nothing seems to work.  So, I don't really care where I plant things back there.  I do have a "arboretum" coming along, but that takes money and time.  Those things are close to the house and already in the ground.  I hate the tree as the roots pop up above ground making it dangerous to walk (still wearing bandaids cuz of the holes in my foot).      So, with all your great knowledge, please tell me where to plant the following.      Cantaloupe   Acorn Squash (I know these viney critters from past experiences)   Rutgers' Tomatos   Cherry tomatos   Snap peas   Pole beans      I have an herb garden in the front yard that's been doing better every year.  Seems the garlic chives and onions do best in the front, so I will keep them there.      My husband gave me carte blanche on the entire back yard.  The only pests I get are stray cats and huge banana spiders that talk back atcha!  Plus, the occasional praying mantis, geckos and grass snakes.  I'm not worried about critters.  The cats piss me off more than the bugs bug me.      So, if you can, help me figure out the back yard so I can eat this summer.  And, yes I have my own roto tiller.

20090308035433AANJz0O	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Why do Americans build homes out of wood?	Why do people in America build homes out of wood, when you have lot of cyclones, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. I constantly see on the news aftermaths where entire towns destroyed and the debris is all wood! and then again you rebuild it with wood!! and i can't help but wonder why not use concrete!      Where i live we make homes only out concrete. Some people told me that its "cheaper" to use wood, but American homes are just as expensive when it comes to sale price (if not more). Another told me its cause of the cold climate, but if you use proper insulation techniques you can achieve same level of warmth using concrete.      So my question is, why Americans don't use concrete and rid themselves of destruction in times of bad weather?

I am on the market for a new limbing saw; somewhere in the 40-50cc area... after deciding upon either a stihl, or jonsered, i finally chose stihl.  Jonsered's prices are ridiculous (but worth it).  I have an old Stihl 011av that was my limbing saw, but it's getting tired, and i can't keep up with it's maintenance issues.  I visited Stihl's website, and can't make up my mind.  I need a light dependable saw that i will be using rigorously for the season+.  I don't want any comfort none sense, just a good rugged, and serviceable machine.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated..

20090308070433AA5DJXD	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Untreated wood furniture in bedroom / lounge area. When is it a problem?	I bought two sets of shelves from IKEA, and a table, which were untreated. As I am paranoid about humidity and mold I didn't want to take any chances, and I bought some sealant stuff there as well, which we applied. It was enough for one shelves and the table, so we left the other shelves for later, and so far have not got round to doing them.      When we put the gloss on, it seemed fine, but since it's dried it smells nasty. Sort of a sickly sweet and burnt smell.      Soooo, I am not really looking forward to sealing the other one, at least not with this stuff, but it looked like it was a reasonably "healthy" one.      Question then: Would be really so bad to have a set of bookshelves that are from unfinished wood? I would take care not to spill drinks or food or cream or whatever onto them, and they don't hold anything that's not bone dry. But they are obviously still in a room, where food is eaten, people sleep and hair is dried, so there will be some moisture. I guess in general I am most concerned about whether this means a happy breeding ground for molds. If it's more about the wood not looking supershiny etc, that doesn't bother me. The smell of this gloss bothers me.      Thanks!! :D
20090308065840AAsJDfr	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How long should new furniture give off that "new stuff" smell?	I've bought some furniture from IKEA about 4 months ago. It's all new stuff in my room, but the drawers are giving me a problem, and to a lesser extent the wardrobe as well. They are both from the same series as the bed, which is fine (?!). They are all made with this fibre board stuff, and the problem is that the drawers *really* smell of some sort of chemical.      When we got the boxes, I let all the individual parts air out for a few days, and then once put together, I let them stand open and air out, too. And it's been several months, but the smell is still there, every day.   Unfortunately I react to it, and it irritates my throat and gives me headaches. But why only the drawers, and why is it still going on?   Will this go away, or should I just try to get something new? Problem is of course avoiding getting the same problem.   The smell transfers onto my clothes as well, so it's really no good, and I'm running out of patience with it.      Any ideas?      Thank you!!! :)
