5EGm6ZLhaa	A freshman is a first year higher-education student who has not earned any college/university level credits. A transfer student is someone who has earned college level credit and is transferring this credit from one institution to another. <br>  <br>  Degree and non-Degree are rather self explanatory, some schools have certain non-degree which you go to class, do some work and you do it to learn the skills or to gain the knowledge, but beyond that you do not get recognition for your efforts, a degree program is different, you do the work and you get a nice bit of paper which is worth something to employers and graduate schools.
xRG9pwUKaa	You're nearly done with your program. Finish what you started. But, if you're not satisfied with your job opportunities, consider staying. Fact is, there are three and only three growing career fields and it's been this way for years. Medical (including Animal), Education, & Information Technology. <br>  <br>  People talk about accounting as a hot career field. It was, but many accounting functions can be outsourced. Now, I don't know what your major is, but I do know that if you do a BSN program, you'll get a decent job. If you get an MSed or MTE, you'll find a decent job. And, if you're a math person, you'll find plenty of jobs in tech. Without one or more degrees in one (or two) of those key areas, the job market doesn't care what you know, it's who you know. <br>  <br>  Feel like being a double major maybe?|`|odu4jOx3aa	the only reason you cant find a job is because of the recession not because "college isn't worth it".<br>  <br>  now and days its hard enough to get somewhere with a college education, but without one you'll end up working at your local McDonald's.|`|VZ21gL81aa	yes, it is frustrating. Employment opportunities are cyclical. You seem to be hung up on how much others make. <br>  <br>  Stick it out, get the degree, then go about your life. Sooner or later, you will land where you want to be.<br>  <br>  Just for the heck of it, the responder who claimed that professors make 300k a year is SO off the mark..... and the one who indicated that educated people are stuck up..... well, that may be true, but I have my degrees.... along with the knowledge that I can transfer my skills to more than some internet site.......<br>  <br>  Reality: many graduates will end up doing jobs that have no bearing on their program of study. Many store managers are busy paying the bills while they work on their doctorates in the hopes that they may eventually land a university job. I never held a job in my field (bachelors), but somehow manage to pay the bills. Isn't that what is really important? to capitalize on the opportunities that are presented?<br>  <br>  It is a tough job market right now, maybe another year or two.... get some work experience, stay active in your field, be ready to move across the country for the dream job...... but most importantly, finisg your degree.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes it's worth attending.  Take it from somebody who wasn't able to.  I can't tell you how many times I was told I couldn't be considered for promotions because I didn't have a degree.  It was extremely frustrating.  They would say something like - "We know you can do this job and you would do it very well but the company rule says you must have a degree."<br>  You're very young.  Hang in there.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, for some people.  Not everyone is meant for college - for some technical or trade school is more appropriate.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, you learn a lot, establish friendships and in the long term earn more as a result. Good luck.|`|AA11518036	It sure is.|`|AA11604732	As you can see from the chart below, the average college dropout only makes about 75% of what a graduate makes and is 50% more likely to be out of work.<br>  <br>  These are tough times for everyone.  Don't blame your education -- blame George Bush for ruining the economy.  In the long run, you will do better than the average dropouts.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	Stay in school and finish your education. Right now you are in a dead beat job, but college will offer you the opportunity to move on to other jobs, better paid and more stimulating. Nothing beats a good education.|`|lVkaALbOaa	yes absloutly you will understand the information much better|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	You are way to close to not finish-it will always be a regret.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Uhhh...do you have your degree? That might explain it >_>|`|EV1Z1AWCaa	Why go through all that schooling and not finish?  You're going to have to pay for the schooling you have received so far.  Why pay back $30,000 or more without having that piece of paper?<br>  <br>  Times are tough right now. Even with a college degree it's difficult to find a job in the field you want.  But right now I'm stuck in the position I have until I get a degree.  I cannot get promoted without furthering my education. <br>  <br>  A lot of companies, especially larger companies, have made it so they require degrees to hold certain positions.<br>  <br>  You're almost done, I bet you'll regret it if you don't finish.  You'll find a job that's perfect for you and they'll require a degree, then you'll be kicking yourself.|`|iNFE3utOaa	Im 27 and doing better than all of my friends who went to college. I travel around the world and have several online businesses. Im a high school drop out. College helps you learn how to work for other people, because a degree only matters when you're sitting on the other side of someone else's desk for an interview, life experience helps you learn how to work for yourself. If you want to be the global manager of mcdonalds or the VP of Ford, yeah you would need college. If you want to own your own business like Bill Gates or day trade stocks, you don't need college. I live in Thailand(my favorite), Holland, and Brazil half the time. Now let's say I wanted a job there, do you really think my american degree would be honored? Theres some who need their degree or they would not be smart enough to succeed without it, either that or they just enjoy working for other people's companies the rest of their lives. It all depends on who you are. We need doctors and people like that so no offense to them.<br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cjthai" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/cjthai</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ThailandTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/ThailandTL</a>|`|n7BuH75gaa	Unfortunately, in this country (USA) education is kind of an essential part of having a good, comfortable life. With the way things are going right now you have to get your education. You have to pay for it as well. I know it's hard right now but, things will get better. I think you should stay in school and try to move up. Seriously, if you have been going to college for that long, I'm sure, you have acquired certain people skills AND you shouldn't throw it all away by quiting. <br>  Go for it though. You won't regret it.|`|AA11809403	there are areas where a college degree is absolutely worth the time and the money, and strongly effects how far you can go in your career.<br>  <br>  Medicine and engineering are good examples.<br>  <br>  you probably won't be able to go far in other scientific careers (biology, physics, chemistry, psychology) without the education and the paper. <br>  <br>  but there are industries/business where your knowledge and experience ( and luck) matter more than the diploma.<br>  <br>  and, this is a BAD time to be looking for  a job.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	no I don't think it is, people are brain washed by University's and Banks to attend, to support their massive salaries, the average professor makes like over 300,000 dollars a year<br>  <br>  <br>  the student ends up paying off college loans for a decade while working at a low paying job anyway.<br>  <br>  Bill Gates never graduated, All these people are brainwashed|`|S1Q1mVgJaa	The best way to move up in a company is to have a degree. A high school grad tops out at around $25k a year, where a bachelors degree will get you around $55k. This is just the avj. so dint take it to heart. I know a man who owns his own business that makes $250k take home and got his GED so he could get a small business loan. Do what you think is right, just know that your odds get better with a degree.|`|j8zY1KCIaa	I really all depends on what career you get into, if you chose to go into a career that pays very well starting off so that you can pay back any student loans and stuff, then it is very worth it.<br>  Regardless, it is always better to have a higher education than just a high school diploma.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Kyle|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	try to move up in a company that only makes 50k a year?? I make 50k a year being at the lowest level in my company lol<br>  <br>  GO TO SCHOOL! yes it is worth it, and yes you will have the best years of your social life in college.<br>  Go to school while you are young and you will enjoy the expreience|`|Sz36Xyqtaa	man, **** college. i dropped out of high school and live with my parents. i went into male prostitution for a little bit. i buy some marijuana every now and then and light that **** up with my homeboy sherad williams. we be blazin that **** everynight. i sometimes hop on the xbox and pwn some noobs on halo 2. that **** is for real.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	school is important...think about how lucky you are to have the right to and education! <br>  <br>  but i see where you're coming from..right now the economy is sucky and there aren't many jobs to be had, if/when things get better, you will be glad you stuck it out in school and got a degree|`|bfNDLbVqaa	If you think you have the requirements already, then go for the job! 3 years of college would be a good bachelor basis. Just make sure what companies ask for before you quit college. And if you ever make a mistake, remember college doors are always open.|`|hFNqA23Maa	acually yes, I am in college for my 2 year and it is sooo fun.. You get a room mate and you will become best friends.. And also you can get a better job that pays alot more.... And it proofs that you care about education|`|BlHGarlHaa	it depends on wat u want to become.  the thing is that college could help u or waste ur time. people that are in companies or like "bosses" want specific people. some people they take because they are needed.  the thing is, is that this is random. i say go to college.|`|EH7G8voyaa	Stay in college. More opportunites after rather than giving up and being stuck in one career your whole life.|`|Tw7o2Uagaa	If you don't want to be alive, or at least living, no it isn't.|`|QGuxbItCaa	The parties are great.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I am a senior in college also.  You should definitely stay in school.  Right now the economy sucks but once things turn around we will be ahead of the game.  Plus we are already so close to being done, I would hate to throw away all of my time for nothing.  Worst case scenario, I could go be a Big Box retail store manager, making somewhere around 50k a year.  I know Target hires managers with a Bachlors degree of any kind and in MI where our economy is soooo bad they are still paying about 50k a year.  No degree=No job when it comes to a lot of companies.  It's definitely worth having the degree.  Once you graduate and things turn around you will be able to find something worth your time, making decent money.  It doesn't sound like your company is the right company for you, in my opinion.  If they were they would help you move up prior to graduation.|`|bAY9j21Paa	thats a tough one... see, my husband barely got his g.e.d. and he is making over 60,000 a year in construction. Where as my sister has her masters degree and making 20,000 less a year... Really i guess it depends on what you want to do with your life. Most places you have to work up a corperate ladder anyways... where as with NO degree you might start as a receptionist at an office building and work your way up in 15 years to a good occupation in that same building, or you could have a degree start up a little higher, and work yourself up in half the time. make sense? not sure.|`|qWn2DRtsaa	I am a Human Resources Advisor, so I think I am qualified to answer this!  STAY IN SCHOOL!  The problem these days is that they want you to have a college or university degree PLUS experience.  This is nearly impossible, because how can you really gain good experience while going to school?  The bottom line is, without that stupid certificate from your college, most companies won't even talk to you-and without experience, they won't talk to you.  The most important thing you shoudl be focusing on now is networking.  Find that person that can get you in and prove yourself from there.  Do you know EXACTLY what you want to do....and not because of the money?<br>  <br>  It may not be the job you want to start, but it will be a chance for you to prove yourself.  To get into HR, I took a $35k (that's right) pay cut.  It works out in the end -trust me.<br>  <br>  When I say networking, I don't mean the parties as mentioned above.  They are good though!  Hang in there kiddo -it will be worth it in the end.|`|AGKxNYBeaa	It depends on how much longer you have left at college really and how happy you are being at college - if you are hating your course and your not going to be enjoying the qualification it gives you (work wise) then leave, but it seems a waste of three years really. Although will the job yo walk into after college bring you 50,000 dollars a year or will it bring you more? Will you be able to just work your way up immidety? You should think about your happieness first...|`|e0fe2e25bb39063e841fda6e39a6fe39aa	ABSOLUTELY AND YOU DONT HAVE TO SPEND TONS OF MONEY GOING TO AN EXPENSIVE ONE. I WENT TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR JUST 2 YRS AND OBTAINED A NURSING DEGREE AND FIND MYSELF MAKING WAY MORE MONEY (ABOUT 120,000 INCLUDES"LOTS" OF OVERTIME) THAN A LOT OF MY FRIENDS THAT WENT TO BIG UNIVERSITIES WITH FANCY NAMES, ALL THEY GOT WERE BORING JOBS THAT DONT PAY THEM WELL AND A TON OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT THEY ARE STILL REPAYING. SO JUST CHOOSE YOUR DEGREE CAREFULLY. BEST OF LUCK|`|NQ1kxjqXaa	Yes. College will pay off in the long run.

CZQU0kMBaa	How about a topic of how misinformation on the web can be damaging and dangerous.  Although the web can be a wealth of information and opinion;  there is a great deal of misrepresentation of information, and commerce.  (ie) false news and reports,  fake websites, and illicit business.  How can these be better regulated and controlled?
CZQU0kMBaa	LOL Probably because if she was called Ba Peep, people might confuse her with Baa Baa; the "black sheep" that had the three bags full of wool...<br>  <br>  As for Bo herself, the exact origin of the rhyme is uncertain, but can probably be traced back at least as far as the Victorian era. At least one bookmark from Victorian era is illustrated with Little Bo Peep, so the origin may be even earlier than this.<br>  <br>  In Sussex, people claim it is a smuggling tale from the town of St. Leonards (Part of the Hastings conurbation). One of the Martello Towers, known informally as Bo Peep, was used to house the customs men and sometimes to imprison the smugglers themselves. The Bo Peep public house, which still stands, is said to have been used by smugglers. The extra verses of the rhyme make more sense in this context, than they would if the rhyme was really about a shepherdess. Little Bo Peep herself, refers to the customs men; the sheep are the smugglers, and the tails are the contraband (probably barrels of rum and/or brandy). It was known for smugglers to abandon their contraband if they heard the customs men were onto them. The second verse probably refers to the fact that, in local communities, smugglers were more liked by the locals than the customs men and false trails were often set.<br>  <br>  And here are some additional verses probably written later than the original that you might find amusing...<br>  <br>  Little Bo peep fell fast asleep <br>  And dreamt she heard them bleating; <br>  But when she awoke, she found it a joke, <br>  For they were still a-fleeting. <br>  Then up she took her little crook, <br>  Determined her to find them; <br>  She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed, <br>  For they'd left their tails behind them. <br>  It happened one day, as Bo peep did stray <br>  Into a meadow hard by, <br>  There she espied their tails side by side, <br>  All hung on a tree to dry. <br>  She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye, <br>  And over the hillocks went rambling, <br>  And tried what she could, as a sheperdess should, <br>  To tack each again to its lambkin. <br>  <br>  This is certain to be more than you would have ever wished to know about the legendary Miss Peep, but additionally she appears as 'Bo Peep', a ceramic doll, in Toy Story and Toy Story 2. In the Shakespeare play King Lear there is a reference to "Bo-Peep" by the court fool. In the anime Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo they call her Little Bobobo-Peep.<br>  <br>  You didn't realize the depth of her character did you?|`|zHmZkMStaa	"Bo' is the short term for Bonnie, a Scottish name, or lass.  Peep is her last name, but only because it rhymes with sheep.  Sheep-herding was quite common in Scotland when theis rhyme was made up :)

qX1Mf6Gsaa	Use the formula:  distance = rate times time (d=rt)<br>  <br>  the time is 2 hours for both trains.<br>  <br>  let r = the speed of the train from Toronto<br>  and r + 50 = the speed of the train from Montreal<br>  <br>  the equation comes from knowing that the sum of the two distances equals 500 km.<br>  <br>  2r + 2(r + 50) = 500<br>  2r + 2r + 100 = 500<br>  4r = 400<br>  r = 100<br>  <br>  The train from Toronto is traveling 100 km/h, and after 2 hours, the distance is 200 km.<br>  <br>  that's it! ;)|`|a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	At the point where the two trains pass each other, the sum of the distances they have traveled will equal the distance between the two cities.  Since the train from Montreal will have traveled 50 km/hr faster than the train from Toronto, it will have traveled 2 hr (50 km/hr) = 100 km more than the slower train.  Also, since the sum of their distances from their respective points of origins will be equal to the distance between the two cities, and letting D be the distance from Toronto of the slower train, we can write this equation:<br>  <br>  D + (D + 100) = 500<br>  2D + 100 = 500<br>  2D = 500 - 100<br>  2D = 400<br>  D = 200.<br>  <br>  That means that the trains will pass when they are 200 km from Toronto.<br>  <br>  We can verify this another way.  Let r be the speed of the train from Toronto, and r' = r + 50 be the speed of the other train.  Then we can write this equation:<br>  <br>  500 = 2r + 2(r + 50)<br>  500 = 2r + 2r + 100<br>  500 = 4r + 100<br>  400 = 4r<br>  100 = r.<br>  <br>  If r = 100 km/hr, then r' = r + 50 = 150 km/hr.  Multiplying both speeds by 2 hrs., we get this:<br>  <br>  D = 2 (100) + 2 (150)<br>  D = 200 + 300.<br>  <br>  This again shows that the train from Toronto will have traveled 200 km, and the train from Montreal will have traveled 300 km in 2 hours, which is what one would expect considering the difference in their speeds<br>  <br>  The two trains will meet when they are 200 km from Toronto.|`|h2IpiWYIaa	They are 200 km away from Toronto.<br>  <br>  The one leaving from Montreal is going 150 km/hr and the train leaving from Toronto is going 100 km/hr.|`|AA10796679	150 km/h

hc89tLJcaa	Be SURE about your choice. Once you join one sorority, you can never join another one in the NPHC. Do not go around telling everybody which one you want to join. You can tell your friends. But, otherwise, be discreet. Attend that sorority's events and let them know who you are, but don't overdo it. Don't sweat them. They don't need groupies. And, make sure you're ready for a long-term commitment. You are expected to remain active even AFTER graduation. If they want you, when it's time to join, they will let you know. <br>  I joined a Black sorority as an undergrad. It has been a wonderful experience.

I assume you will have less time to devote with a baby, it may take you 5-6 years to complete. My income is 43,500, but that will depend on where you're teaching.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) No.1 You sound very de-motivated & very unhappy with your situation. As far as I can see you have two choices give up now & regret it for the rest of your life (Oh!! I feel such a failure!!!!??) OR you can at least search for something that REALLY interests you in life. Something beyond what other people tell you too do.<br>  <br>  No.2 Your destiny IS actually in your own hands here. Don't you deserve it too yourself to find something anything that moves you, that touches you inside, that matters to you, that you do actually care about.<br>  <br>  No.3 YOU yourself do have the answers to this dilemma. LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF!! listen to your feelings & thoughts you will find the answer. The answer might even be staring you in the face but you haven't yet seen it because your too caught up with other things like what other people might think about you,etc.<br>  <br>  No.4 Try NOT to be overwhelmed by every assignment. Look How do you eat an Elephant??? One spoon full at a time. Just do whats immediately in front of you, because the more you procrastinate the more overwhelmed your going to feel and the more overwhelmed you feel the more negative your going to end up feeling The more your going to feel like you have failed BEFORE you've even tried to write anything.<br>  <br>  No.5 Listen up !! YOUR NOT A FAILURE but you have to join the race to at least have a chance to win. If you opt out you have no chance to win & no chance to prove to yourself and other people who care about you that you can succeed in doing something. TRY BEFORE YOU GIVE UP TOTALLY!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan<br>  <br>  PS:- Your NOT a failure this you MUST believe about yourself.|`|TplAab3Haa	This is quite normal in University life. If you've attended lectures, done all your research, you should be able to do the assignment. By asking your lecturer for assistance you are gaining an unfair advantage over other students. I assume you asked for assistance outside of the classroom setting. Assistance will be given by the lecturer but marks will be deducted from the assignment. The lecturers take the view that they might as well have written it. The place to ask for help is in the classroom, that way no one gets an advantage. Why don't you set up a study group with 3 or 4 friends to thrash out problems and use each others knowledge to assist with your assignments. I'm also making the assumption you are in the UK.|`|hHip4q2Raa	You could talk to the Head of the Department about the professor...|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	you shouldnt get marked down for asking! what actually are you studying? there is a lot of info on the web + student forums etc!|`|RAzCYBolaa	Hi there!<br>  Firstly, this is your final year. You may as well do the best of your ability because this is the last year of all those assignments and essays and tests.<br>  Secondly, I think it is pointless and stupid of the teachers to just not offer you help or advice. You should be able to go to teachers and ask for advice on anything at all! But, if they're going to be that stubborn and not let you get any extra information, try talking to someone else - a parent, cousin, sister, brother, grandma, granddad, friends; anyone who will be willing to support and help you through this tough (and maybe boring) time.<br>  Thirdly, assignments are confusing and difficult for everyone. Though, some people worry about them tremendously, whereas others take them in their stride and don't worry too much about them. If you're one of those people that worry about assignments and find them tedious and annoying, then try to think about the good side of things! <br>  <br>  I hope your assignment and last year goes well!
AA10023710	The best acting schools in the NYC area are Juilliard, NYU, and Fordham. I'd need to know your specific GPA and your SAT scores to know if you have a chance at NYU or Fordham. Juilliard, however, could care less about your grades - they admit purely based on the audition. <br>  <br>  Other schools with good acting programs in that area include Rutgers New Brunswick (which is outside the city), SUNY Purchase (again, outside the city), and Hunter College. Another good acting program is the one at the New School University. <br>  <br>  Which ones are best for you depends on your exact grades, your SATs, and etc. But of those, the easiest ones to get into are the New School, Purchase and Hunter. <br>  <br>  In any case, you'll apply for financial aid, which will help you pay for school. So when you apply, apply to several schools - those that are cheaper, like Hunter, and those that are expensive, like Fordham. See where you get in, see what aid they offer you, and then decide where you're going.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	I went to Pace University.  It was great, a really good school.  Up-to-date technology, great professors..  If you're into acting they host Inside the Actors Studio with James Lipton there and they have really great programs.  It isnt cheap but they offer financial aid plus Scholarships if u have high enough grades.  As a freshman I had an A/B average in high school and I was accepted into their honors program which got me a free laptop and $10,000 scholarship every year...If u keep ur gpa above 3.6 u get more money too.|`|KmGaC1Mzaa	try looking up CUNY schools (City Univerisity of New York) there are a lot of Cuny schools and they are much less then private schools or some other schools in the city ... i'm pretty sure you can find a few that have acting or theater majors|`|581661bc9637001924cbebd11b6b75eeaa	Perhaps before you start looking at colleges you should check into some remedial schools for a while where you might actually learn how to spell the words COLLEGE, SOPHOMORE, FINANCIAL and FINER!

AA10023710	When you say you're going home in March, that indicates to me that your parents are in your life. Your first stop is them. Speak to your parents immediately.<br>  <br>  In addition, go to your university financial office and speak to someone there. Many unis have "emergency loan funds" that they can give out to students. <br>  <br>  Next, look for a part-time job immediately. Yes, you are leaving in March, but try to find an employer who is either good with that, or don't tell them about that, and quit when the time comes. Look for casual employment in a restaurant, pub, etc. Something you can do just maybe two days per week, for a few hours. In fact, see if you can find a job at your uni first, as they'd already have the break built into their schedule. Places like your student bars, restaurants, cafeterias, the library, physical plant, security all tend to hire students. <br>  <br>  Finally, sit down and work out a true budget that you can live on. Do a spreadsheet or something, put in all your expenses - all of them, including pizza, bank fees, rent, transport, books - and your income, and figure out what expenses you must cut to allow you to live on your income.|`|AA12032374	I am not sure there is such a thing as a crisis loan.

AA10407542	I would think about what it is you like to do first.  If you were to concentrate your studies on something you call more "advanced" you must mean more pay.  Sadly, early childhood education pays very little and this is why many University settings no longer offer degrees in this specific discipline.  A director of these programs would be the most advanced but the annual pay is not that great.  So, there is teaching in calssic settings such as public schools, private schools, and kindergarten - high school.  When I read your question however I thought of one role that pays well, requires a degree, and works with children and families.  The position is one not talked of much but always an incredible profession, Child/Life Specialist.  I have a friend who works at a hospital doing just this. (Found a description below)  <br>  <br>  WHAT IS A CHILD LIFE SPECIALIST? <br>  <br>  Child life specialists are nonmedical members of a medical team, meaning they do not diagnose or perform medical treatment. They strive to help children in both inpatient and outpatient settings by reducing the stress and anxiety that many children experience in these situations. While the use of child life specialists has been mostly limited to hospitals, it is now more common to see them in pediatric physician and dental offices, outpatient clinics, counseling clinics, and any other environment that includes a pediatric population. <br>  <br>  I wanted to comment on your classes too.  I would recommend you take a class in child development as it will transfer into many programs (sociology, psychology, int. disc studies, health and leisure, etc) this will give you a good foundation.  I would also recommend you take classes that deal with either adolescent development or child/family classes.  Talk to your college advisor about some of your intentions within this area to see what is offered.  I hope this looks interesting, good luck!|`|j0yv0T0oaa	Are you thinking of majoring in Early Childhood Education or just a course on childcare?

At least is the key word. which means it could be more.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	The number 23 preceding your question is the key to the answer. It is obviously written for a reason, but I can't figure it out.<br>  <br>  My answer is number 10.|`|2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	There is not enough information to answer because there is no information to base the claims of 1-10.<br>  <br>  In other words, consider #1, why would you know if it's true or false? There is no meat, no substance, nothing to grade it on its truth. The same goes for 2 through 10.<br>  <br>  Another example:<br>  Suppose a woman walked up and said to you, "I just said a false statement".<br>  Someone else asks you, "Did she speak the truth?".<br>  You wouldn't know how to answer them because there would be no prior information to build from.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if 1-10 are deemed incomplete, then your question cannot be answered.
uC75y83Taa	Yes, it's way too long.  After the word "us," put a period. Then omit "and" and start a new sentence with "That." Then it'll be perfect!  :)|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	It's not a run-on, but because it's such a long sentence, you need to put a comma after "think of us" and before "and" to make it easier to follow.  Better yet, rewrite it into two sentences:<br>  <br>  "George Herbet Meads efforts links Charles Cooley’s looking glass self to the idea of role taking.  It shows that the looking glass is based on our perception of how other people think of us and that role taking occurs when someone mentally takes the role of another to understand the world from that persons point of view."<br>  <br>  EDIT - it also needs some work on punctuation and capitalization.  For example, "person's point of view" needs the apostrophe, and if efforts and looking glass self are titles then they need to be capitalized.  However, I'm assuming that you've got those angles covered, and the main thing you needed to ask about was whether you had a run-on sentence, correct?|`|BAJd8raoaa	Wow, still fresh on my mind from last semester's sociology textbook.  It's Herbert, not Herbet.  And yeah, your sentence looks fine but for a lack of a couple punctuation points.  Comma after 'us,' and an apostrophe in Mead's.|`|6mOOskuBaa	Nope, this is not a run on sentence.

As Gail Trimble has pointed out on TV interviews there wouldn't be the interest in her looks secondary to her performance if she was a man.<br>  <br>  She also pointed out that there are different types of intelligence, and that she would not do so well in analytical use of knowledge - she did very well under pressure though and used her "blotting-paper" mind and unflappable persona to win the series for her college.<br>  <br>  So many arguments seem to go back to more primitive times - I think as men used to bring home the bacon, they (and strangely women too) often resent women who demonstrate greater aptitude as do they resent women in powerful job positions.|`|0l98mcf3aa	Oh I find 'brainy females' so exciting.

For example, I am a PhD student (in plant molecular biology) and I lecture sometimes to help out. I also look quite young (I'm 26 but I don't look it). When the people I lecture too find out I'm going to be teaching them I sometimes get sotto voce comments about my abilities, suitability to lecture and my age. But then I think... oh well if they don't want to listen they can get out and fail the module. It does upset me when I go out and I can't talk about my work because no one understands it though. Worse is that my extended family are always so proud of my sisters (an accountant and an IT lady) but not so much of me, I think they find it hard to understand so they don't really try (my immediate family excluded bless 'em, they try really hard to understand).|`|AA11604732	I love brainy females.

zhJOZhKEaa	Even though the laws can vary wildly from state to state... I think you will be fine being 'off' till March 2nd.  Homeschoolers can typically have the freedom to decide for themselves when school is 'on' or 'off'.  You can easily consider this your 'spring break'.  <br>  <br>  Also...even if you were still in public school you would allowed a reasonable number of 'sick days' per semester.  The typical number I see is 10 per semester... so even if you were considered 'absent' from now to March 2nd you aren't exceeding that number.<br>  <br>  Many parents 'deschool' for several weeks or even months when switching between public school and homeschooling.  I really can't imagine that such a short break as you are looking at would be a problem.
109aa4f9a03a8c64015d007f32e3ef20aa	It depends on what your major will be.<br>  For instance, if you're going to engineering school, then you have to have had Calculus or Analysis.<br>  For accounting, you'll have had to taken bookkeeping.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	most colleges require you to take Freshman level algebra & Trig (same class).<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and take at least algebra I, II and possibly trigonometry to be prepared.<br>  <br>  I was a psych major, I took my math in my first semester at college - got a B and never had to take math again.|`|jUIvuftTaa	It depends on the university, but generally it's a plus on your application. You would have to think about your own ability first though. If you are up to the challenge now to complete AP or IB courses in math then I encourage you to try it. If you can receive a good enough score for a certain college, it could save you 4 or 5 hours a week of class time in your first semester of college!! That means more time for naps, studying, hanging out, you name it. Oh you save money too. =]<br>  <br>  Oh and you should note that different majors require different level of math to be completed. For example, a major in Biology only requires Calculus 1 (Equivalent to AP Calculs A/B), while a Engineering major require much much more than that. (I think it was Calculus III for my college) High school Calculus goes up to Calculus 1, so it's perfect for just about anyone to complete.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what year you are in high school, but it's not too early to think about these things. I certainly regret that I started late junior year to think about my future in college. I hope it all goes well for you, good luck!!|`|M71hN9OBaa	it helps.<br>  <br>  if you do good on your high school placement tests, they'll put you in advanced math...so by senior year you'll be a senior taking a freshman college math class.<br>  <br>  it's not madnatory, but it makes you stand out to colleges.

All relationships start running into trouble when one partner perceives that the partnership is uneven, that one is putting more in than the other. Its odd that 15 years seems to be a decision time. I had a similar problem with my first wife, she wasn't ill, just idle. At 15 years after an argument she asked me if I wanted a divorce, I don't know who was more surprised, me or her when I said yes. No one can say if your an idiot or not, somehow I doubt it, but from what you've said I think you've given it a good go. Only you can make the decision, its like jumping into the unknown, its scary. I made my decision and I don't regret it, I found a new wife and been happily married for the last 23 years. I think that in your Heart of hearts you know what to do.

You did a good job.  You'll have to finish what I started.  Good Luck!<br>  As Mrs. Walker walks over to her front door she notices a shadow behind her husbands car, she walks over to the car and a man jumps out grabs her by the neck and covers her mouth he mumbled "don’t struggle, just come with me" Mrs. Walker realized he had a knife in his pocket she tried reaching for it but the man hit her across the head and placed her in the boot of his car. Jim Walker, Mrs. Walker’s husband, looked out the window when he heard the car speeding off, on the ground was Mrs. Walkers bag, Mr. Walker ran out picked it up and realized that the car that just sped off had Mrs. Walker in it. That night Jim got a phone call saying "don’t call the police or she will die, I want 5 thousand pounds within three days" Jim didn’t know where to get that amount of money in a short period of time. Jim didn’t have to call the police as he was a police officer. When Mrs. Walker awoke she was tied to a chair and her mouth had tape across it, it was pitch black and there seemed to be two men standing in the corners of the room. The next morning Jim searched all over the drive way for evidence on who took his wife but nothing was there except a small blue card with a logo of a tiger on it. At work Jim searched all over the internet to find out anything about this card but there was nothing. He tried looking for fingerprints there were none but there was a small black piece of leather behind his car.<br>  Jim racked his brain trying to figure out what it is he remembers about the little piece of leather.  It was only about one and half inches square with rugged edges and in the very center was a raised area.  Just a pinpoint area about the size of a pea; by feeling of the leather it appeared there was something underneath the tiny hump.  Jim knew he had held this very piece of leather in his hand at some time.....but when and where and why can’t he remember.  Jim knows without a doubt that this is a link to where his wife is; should he puncture the material in order to find out what’s underneath or should he leave it as is until he remembers where....wait, the memory is coming into the recesses of his mind.  Now he has it!  He and Scott were at that old junk yard looking for a part for Scott’s car.  Scott had put the little scrap of leather in his pocket because he liked the way it felt, when he rubbed his fingers across it.   What would it be doing here in my driveway?  Then Jim remembers that Scott knew Mrs. Walker (name?) way back in middle school.  They lived in the same town and Jim remembers Scott saying he would ride by Mrs. Walker’s (name?) home to try to catch a glimpse of her in her bathing suit out by the pool.  Scott even parked his old Chevy in the wooded area one time and sat and watch Mrs. Walker (?) sunbathing.  At the time it
T0gv52CDaa	The job I had as a psych undergrad student wasn't an internship per se, but it gave me a lot of valuable experience in the field.  I worked on-call at a home for mentally ill adults.

Yes, the hard work you're doing now will matter a lot when it comes time to apply to med schools, so keep it up.|`|RMPJOS6jaa	The only way your GPA will begin at zero is if you don't transfer any of your CC credits.  In order to transfer into a university with advanced standing from a CC you have to transfer a minimum of 30 semester hours.  A university will only accept transfer credits if those credits satisfy one of their degree requirements.  Once a university accepts your credits it considers them equivalent credits to those earned at the university and uses those credits to compute your overall GPA.<br>  <br>  If a university accepts your CC credits a medical school doesn't care whether you earned them at the university or at a CC.<br>  <br>  Many people mistakenly allege that courses taken at a CC are considered inferior.  They may hold this belief because some CC's (and universities, too) do offer non-major courses and a lot of people think they can take these easier courses and have the credit apply toward a degree.  That's called learning the hard way.  But if a CC course satisfies a major requirement at the university then it doesn't matter if you take the course at a CC or at a university.  A lot of people who respond to questions on Yahoo aren't aware that the majority of states now require all courses at a CC to be able to transfer to the state university system.

l7fyLFFtaa	5-10 minutes is so little time for a team building game and 30 kids is huge for such activities. I do have a couple of suggestion though.<br>  <br>  1. Line them up, shoulder to shoulder, then have them get into order from shortest to tallest. That was easy. Once they are done have them get in order of birthdays, staring with Jan 1 - Dec 31 (no years). This time, however, they need to do it without talking.This is called the Birthday Line-Up.<br>  <br>  2. Knots - Break them into groups of 6-8 kids. Have the kids get into a circle with their group and face each other. Yo should have 4-5 separate groups. Have all the kids raise their right hands and then grab the hand of someone across from them. Now have all the kids raise their left hands and grab the hand of someone different. Now the groups need to untangle themselves, get out of their knots. They cannot let go of the hands they are holding though. - This is a great activity but could take more than 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  -Curt<br>  <a href="http://recreationguy.com" rel="nofollow">http://recreationguy.com</a><br>  <a href="http://summercampprogramdirector.com" rel="nofollow">http://summercampprogramdirector.com</a>|`|FxvZmBGBaa	u cud do that game where u have groups and 1 person looks at a picture for 10 secs and then reports bak 2 group and the group has 2 draw the picture.  take it in turns to luk at picture and report bak...gud team work!!!

If you have financial need, the federal government will cover the interest for you while you are in school (subsidized).

Use this Expected Family Contribution (EFC) Calculator to:<br>  <br>      * Estimate how much your family will be expected to contribute. After all, you can't make a realistic plan to cover your share if you don't have an idea what your share could be.<br>      * Gain insight into your financial aid eligibility. If you're unable to contribute the entire cost of college, financial aid is available to bridge the gap. That's how the financial aid system works.

AA11604732	Why are you asking the same question over & over.<br>  <br>  Stop being a Troll.|`|AA10023710	I agree about the colleges in RI, with the exception of Brown (and RISD) and Providence College. What about Brown don't you like? To me, it seems to meet every one of your requirements. In addition, they tend to offer excellent financial aid. <br>  <br>  And that's really the crux of this. Other than the state colleges in your home state, every college is going to have an expensive sticker price. You'll need to apply for financial aid, as you know. Is it the case that you won't qualify? Because you can't really evaluate the cost of a college based on its sticker price. You need to apply, see if you get in, see what aid they offer, and then decide. Yes, include some cheap as well as some expensive schools on your list, but those expensive schools - especially if they are private - can sometimes surprise you. That's especially true of some of the top schools, like Brown (although NYU is well known for crappy aid.) To get an idea for schools that offer really good aid, look here, under "no loan" and "loan cap": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_aid#No_loan_financial_aid" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_a...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, if you go to uni overseas, US gov't financial aid won't follow you. The U of M may have some aid for foreign students, but in general, if you go overseas, you'll be expected to be able to pay the full tuition and fees. In general. Speak to them about support, of course. <br>  <br>  Other schools you may like in the UK and Ireland include Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, University College London, Imperial College London, King's College London, (and the other unis that are part of U of London), U Birmingham, U Liverpool, Queens Belfast, Cardiff U. <br>  <br>  If you think you could get into a school like NYU or U Chicago re: grades and etc., some schools that I think may suit you re: location and so on include: Boston University, Northeastern, Fordham Lincoln Center Campus, U Southern California, Holy Cross, Clark U, Smith College, Carnegie Mellon, U Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Tulane (yes, far south, but what a funky city), U Miami (same reason), Yeshiva U, Worcester Polytechnic, St. Louis U, U Denver, UMass Amherst (in a town, not a city, but a very fun and active area), Drexel, Vassar. Maybe Boston College, although it's got a real campus feel, but it's very tied to the city. Maybe Tufts for that same reason. <br>  <br>  Smith and Vassar are iin smaller cities, but those cities have a lot of life to them, and the college really is smack dab in the middle of it all.|`|0WASp0bHaa	For a large university that has a good tuition price you should be looking at those in your own state. In state tuition is going to much better than going to a university out of state. <br>  <br>  Most colleges in big cities have high room and board prices, just because of where they are located.|`|0fygxRHLaa	fair game?  are you picking a college or shooting animals?

5EGm6ZLhaa	You will find that most of your general education classes will simply *transfer* over to your new degree, the business ones will not. You may also find that you will need to take additional lower-division classes such as intro to psychology, research and statistic methods, maybe a different science or math class.<br>  <br>  It isn't a big issue, any marketing classes you have taken will likely be of no use too.<br>  <br>  I would say around another 60 credits, give or take a couple, depending on your exact classes. Speak to a adviser at your school and they will go over your advising transcript with you and tell you want you need.
bS3f0f1paa	I have found that flash cards work best for me. And having someone else there to MAKE me study them. Any time i ever had a test in school, i would make up a bunch of flashcards of teh stuff that i thought or knew would be on the test, and then I would go go over my cousins house. She would go through the flashcards with me for quite a while, and wouldn't let me stop until I went through and got every single one of them right. And if I missed one i had to start over. It was very affective for my mid-terms. I was awful at math and we did it with math problems even, and i only missed one question. Every time I did that I passed. : ) hope this helps.|`|EoCk1VzDaa	It sounds like academics just isn't your field.

He is already going to Pre-school. Pre-schools are full of educational toys and tools. Above that you already agreed that your grandson is in Wonderful preschool. He has social exposure. All he needs is someone working with him. <br>  <br>  Go to public library get lot of books. Read him over and over. Children need repetition. They love repetition. You can get educational Phonics, Maths DVDs and Cassettes also. Watch those with your grandchild and he will love it. We often think that kids need more and more tools but all they need is our time. You can even teach him reading by reading mail flyer's, coupons etc. You can teach him reading from free websites on internet. There is no need to spend any money. Time is priceless and the best tool.

And then private for two years then to public.  Don't worry about grouping, because everyone ends up generally with certain people. These should be the people you like a lot  by the way.  Just relax, and you will be fine.  Don't step lower than yourself for them if they are 'those kinda people'.

AA10023710	If you go to a top law school, it's highly likely you'll get a job before you graduate, or soon after. But if you go to a lower tier law school, the only way I can say you're "guaranteed a job" is if you graduate toward the very top of your class. And if it's a tier 4 school, or worse, one that isn't even ABA accredited, then I can't promise that. Likewise, if you graduate from a low tier law school and don't do super great there, I can't say you'll even end up working in law when you graduate. You might, you might not. <br>  <br>  You don't necessarily have to be outgoing. People see those law shows on TV and think that law is all about courtroom litigation. That's far from the truth. Most law is research and writing. You may never see the inside of a courtroom. And there are different types of law that suit different personalities. You'll need to do your research to find the ones that fit you best. <br>  <br>  You do, however, need to be able to present yourself well re: interviews and work, and to be able to network. <br>  <br>  In other words, to better your chances at actually working in law when you come out: go to the best law school you can get into, make sure the school is both ABA accredited *and* well respected in your region, do very well there, and do an internship and get other law related experiences.|`|AA11604732	Before choosing a law school, look at the pass rate for the bar exam.  If you go to a school with a high pass rate, you will be able to get a decent job.  If not, you may never pass the bar.|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	Employment opportunities largely depend on the area of law you are wanting to enter and of course your own desires. For example, if you wanted to enter the corporate arena and work for a top firm, then the opportunities are slim because most of the these firms only hire one or two graduates each year and thus the positions are highly competitive and if you are not in the top 5% of your class, then you are going to struggle. For small and mid-size firms and government agencies, where most law graduates start there careers, there is usually plenty of of opportunities available for them, certainly in the criminal law area. Like everything in life, there are no guarantees, the key is to work hard and network, this may sound somewhat strange but you are really interviewing for your first job from the first day of your acceptance into a law school-- you need to be getting out there.<br>  <br>  Yes you need to be outgoing, pro-active, self-motivated, dedicated and most of all have excellent communication skills, both orally and written, because if you cannot effectively communicate with clients or your peers, you are not worth anything and would perhaps be better suited to academia and research related fields. <br>  <br>  During your entire law career, you can expect to spend 90% of your day with your head in a book. In law school you will read around 400-420 pages per week, be spending countless hours in the law library preparing and writing briefs for your upcoming classes. Once you graduate a typical work week in the corporate world 70-80 hours. The pay is good, but you need self-discipline, time management and be able to make sacrifices and compromises when necessary.

The difference between true academics who are commited to architectural education and those who are mediocre architects who failed to make it in the real world.<br>  <br>  What you should be looking for are schools which suit your particular interests - maybe sustainability - or ones that are strong on history and theory. Some are very practically minded, others theoretical - some scientific and others arts orientated.  The Architectural Association is slightly different from the main stream schools and not one I would recommend.<br>  <br>  Location is also important particularly as most schools will base design projects in their city - would you prefer Oxford or Leciester, for example. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with finding out as much as you can about the subject now - if you know who Frank LLoyd Wright, Mies Van der Rohe or le corbusier are, you'll be at a much better advantage than most of the people I studied with when they started university.|`|TrOEFKikaa	It partly depends on the kind of education that you want, some are more theoretical, others are better preparation for practice, and this will all change by the time you apply anyway.<br>  some of the best:<br>  UCL (the Bartlett)<br>  AA (a private university that only teaches architecture)<br>  Sheffield<br>  Bath<br>  Nottingham<br>  <br>  I'm not so sure about De Montfort myself.

And when used in this sentence, I get the feeling that Lily is a young girl who is suffering and heartbroken.|`|t79pLOCUaa	I wonder if it is effective or just poetic license.<br>  Tears do not 'tremble' whether pearl-like or not, so the simile is not quite correct..<br>  A better, more coherent sentence, and perhaps just as  evocative might be<br>  'Lily's pearl-like tears trembled at the end of her lashes'<br>  OR<br>  Lily's tears trembled as if they were pearls on the ends of her lashes.|`|R02vAa48aa	"Effective sentences flow.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The answer is:<br>  <br>  D. Assonance<br>  <br>  Assonance is repetition of vowel sounds to create internal rhyming within phrases or sentences, and together with alliteration and consonance serves as one of the building blocks of verse. For example, in the phrase "Do you like blue?", the "oo" (ou/ue) sound is repeated within the sentence and is assonant.<br>  <br>  Examples of assonance:<br>  <br>  Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn. - William Wordsworth, "The world is too much with us" <br>  <br>  Hear the mellow wedding bells. — Edgar Allan Poe, "The Bells" <br>  <br>  Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness - John Keats, "Ode to Autumn" <br>  <br>  And murmuring of innumerable bees - Alfred Lord Tennyson, The Princess VII.203 <br>  <br>  The crumbling thunder of seas — Robert Louis Stevenson <br>  <br>  That solitude which suits abstruser musings - Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br>  <br>  The scurrying furred small friars squeal in the dowse - Dylan Thomas <br>  <br>  Dead in the middle of little Italy, little did we know that we riddled two middle men who didn't do diddily." - Big Pun <br>  <br>  It's hot and it's monotonous. - Stephen Sondheim, Sunday in the Park with George, It's Hot Up Here <br>  <br>  tundi tur unda - Catullus 11 <br>  <br>  With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground. - David Bowie, "Law (Earthlings on Fire)" <br>  <br>  on a proud round cloud in a white high night - e.e. cummings, if a Cheer Rules Elephant Angel Child Should Sit <br>  <br>  I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans - Will Smith, Miami <br>  <br>  So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see, they try to shut me down on MTV but it feel so empty without me- Eminem, Without Me
LwywrSRkaa	I suppose that's what some of the best do don't you think? I have the same, I'm a high achiever too at school but I feel teachers find me weird when I come stressed to school every morning! (I did today, I was in such a bad mood!)<br>  Whatever you make don't plan it for a long period of time but perhaps for a week. Some people find it's better to concentrate on one subject and others find it's better to do different ones so they don't get bored. You should do about 10-30 minutes a session (and then change the subject for the next session) and then take a break. You should at least spend 2/3 hours a day. Leave one day to give yourself a rest though.<br>  <br>  Switch of everything that can distract you (like music, the computer etc.). Also find a place that's comfy for you, and not a boring old study room where you can't concentrate! Choose a place where you can work to the best of your ability.<br>  <br>  You can break stuff down into 10, 20 or 30 minutes and swap it between different subjects. If you are somebody who gets distracted easily, strictly do 10 minute sessions!<br>  <br>  A flexible timetable works the best. As you feel more comfortable with whatever you planned you can increase the difficulty.<br>  <br>  You will also need to find your own revision methods, I like making notes, doing podcasts, posters, flash cards etc. find out what works best for you. Make it look interesting though; not boring but colourful and attractive so you will be more motivated. Ask friends or family to test you too. I find what works for me, is to get my revision books get to the pages I need to revise take a whole bunch of plain paper. I learn a page then I scribble down everything I remember.<br>  <br>  You could also make up stories, songs and so on. If you don't like revising from books you can go on things like BBC Bitesize, or Samlearning and loads of other revision websites. BBC has a lot of podcasts as well.<br>  <br>  Start early and you don't have to do intensive revision every day but it is helpful to look through small notes to remind yourself. Best way to get confident in exams is to do a lot of practice papers, so you get used to the style and know what sort of things to expect. =)<br>  <br>  I find that I work the best in the morning and most of my work that I do gets easily done in the morning.<br>  <br>  Of course don't do it excessively, have fun now and then as well. Little treats and rewards help as well. ;) Good luck! =)|`|KdxTQ6nGaa	think about it this way. There are tons of kids out there who would die to be where you are now. Treasure it and work hard!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hISwD8tcaa	if you cant stick to it, change it. for example if you never stick to your revision in the morning, but do in the afternoon, then schedule more in the afternoon and have a rest in the morning. then look over things again before you go to bed. and take a walk even if just 5 mins up the road and back to get you out the house and some fresh air when you want a break is really helpful. i found revision so boring (i've done gcses and a levels) i found it was best if i did 1 hour sessions, then breaks with walks and food (you need to keep your energy levels up- bananas work so well!). then have you got anyone who can test you on what youve done? thats good as means you get to be social as it can be lonely on your own and its a good way of showing you what you know, rather than just reading pages and thinking your taking it all in. even if you ask a parent who knows nothing about the subject to help, if you have made good revision notes they should be able to help easily. good luck and dont panic x oh and one more thing... good nights sleep!|`|uzAS4OUqaa	With your time table, you should be able to stick to it or else u wont have one in the first place. In case u cant, u need to make up for it.<br>  For u to be less motivated, u are either over confident bout the paper, or u are sure to fail, or u genuinely cant find the time to do so. <br>  The ideal way to do this would be to create an interest with the subject. Try and make a little discovery or a little research to find out more on the subject. If u continue to be interested, u r actually spending more time with the books.<br>  Please do not go too far with the exploring coz it can also end up wastage of a lot of time.<br>  Also, remember that ur parents did a lot of struggling to put u to wher u r now. You wouldn collect money, and buy an ipod if u knew it was broken or if u knew it wasn so good. Similarly, ur folks or whoever put u in school wouldn do so, if they didnt think u could make it worth.

sGtO3fafaa	I would say finance and art history as a double major or art history as a minor. Don't major in a foreign language if you need to learn it do it on your own. It won't matter to an employer if you studied it at a university or are self taught.|`|AA10023710	Lots of unis will actually have Arts Adminstration as a major or minor. Don't get overly stressed if you can't find this specific major or certificate at the unis you really want. There are other ways to get the knowledge you need, which I'll discuss. But here's an example of a program: <a href="http://www.tiffin.edu/artadmin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tiffin.edu/artadmin/</a><br>  <br>  Museum studies may be a good alternative, if arts admin isn't available. But a business, management, or an art major could work quite well, depending on what other classes you take. Note that some unis will also let you create your own major, so if your school doesn't offer Arts Admin as a major, you may be able to craft it yourself. <br>  <br>  Whatever you major in, I'd suggest you be sure to take classes in marketing, finance, art history, museum studies (if they have it), fundraising, arts education, management, public relations, accounting, business law, business writing, HR, and etc. You may also want to take some classes in the basics of art - basic drawing, digital media (if that's the type of art you're after), painting, etc. Not so you become an expert artist; just so you can speak the same language as the people you represent. <br>  <br>  What you really must do is get as much related work experience as possible while you study. I'd have you start by getting a job in your university's gallery, or similar. Volunteer at a local museum. Eventually, try to get a part-time job in a gallery or museum, if you can. But absolutely do an internship in a gallery. That is going to be key. <br>  <br>  When working in the arts, it can be very useful to have French, at least to a basic level. So much of the original documentation of art history actually is in French (or sometimes German, but more commonly French), and even the stuff that's written in English uses a lot of French terms. You need to at least be able to pronounce the words correctly. Take some French classes. <br>  <br>  Depending on the type of art you think you may want to focus on, that may also prompt the need for an additional language. For example, if your gallery may focus on the arts of Latin America, you'd want Spanish. Etc. You may therefore also decide to take some extra art history classes that focus on the subject matter/region you're most interested in; as well as some history classes that are related.|`|brdgnuNVaa	what can't you do!? is the real question...you should double major in somekind of art and minor in marketing or management....as for volunteering there are plenty of places such as local community centers, after school programs for kids, museums, etc. they are always willing to take help for art programs. if there arent any art programs in your community start one up! that would look great on a college app. good luck

G2N3t9axaa	Most people might not know this, but people who don't graduate high school make like 40% less money than high school grads in most cases. But there are plenty of people that have made a name for themselves without a high school degree. But you have to be passionate about somethign to do with your life. If you have a plan and not just being lazy because your tired of school, then pursue your goals. But i would say evaluate what you want from your life if you would like to succeed in life you may want to think can i accomplish this if i dont have a high school degree. Or will it take me longer to get to my goals. I would say atleast finish high school. What you have two years one year left just finish this one thing. If your tired of school then dont go the college route but have a plan. PLEASE for your sake have a plan. Or at the very least get your GED that can atleast act as a diploma so that you can get a decent job. But you should know that GEDs are only valid in the state you get them in so if you ever want to move and be able to get a good job you'll need a HSD. <br>  <br>  So i say bad idea for the most part, you know yourself are you committed enough to pursue something without schooling?
LwywrSRkaa	Here are some tips from me! Although I can't tell you what they specifically will ask you but here are some common questions they can ask and I will give you some tips too.

And don't worry most interviewers are friendly they don't want you to feel uncomfortable, they just want to see your personality and whether you are suited for whatever subjects you chose.

TNTFomKeaa	I think when you're picking your GCSE's it's important to keep your options for the future as open as possible. Pick subjects that will get you accepted on the A-level courses that you want, if you know what they will be. <br>  Languages are useful, whatever career you want to go into. Definitely take French. History is also a good idea because it is a respected academic subject. It also teaches you how to write and think about ideas, which is very important.<br>  As for the more creative subjects, I would just do GCSE Art, rather than textiles as well. Artistic subjects are a lot more work than academic ones. If you decide that you want to do creative A-levels, then you will find that an Art GCSE will get you accepted on any course - textiles, technology, art...<br>  I don't think you need to worry too much about careers yet. It's good to have some idea but it's better to have a lot of options. With a good base of subjects you will have a lot of options at A-levels and a good shot at getting into university if that is what you want to do. You could go and see a careers counselor at your school if you're worried though.<br>  Good luck!

mUdeM1Dqaa	I don't know what your presentation is supposed to consist of, but maybe one simple solution is to get today's newspaper. Cut out the articles of current events on major problems happening that are a result of people who made poor decisions because they were lacking in clear direction. For example, take the subprime mortgage mess. Banks were so obsessed with making money that they didn't see the "cloudy issues" ahead with people not paying their debts. <br>  <br>  Another topic is Obama's stimulus plan. Republicans don't support it because many of the plans to distribute money are too vague. They kept asking for more explicit direction and details as to how the money would be used.

q2b3C8AMaa	In my state, in order to be any kind of teacher you have to be licensed. You will have to take a test (around here it is called the Praxis) for Art I think. You may also have to go through internship A.K.A. student teaching. I would check with your college advisor and maybe the state board of education.

Since class rank and GPA can be highly subjective it helps to have something that is consistent from one person to the next.<br>  <br>  However, it should be noted that the standard tests (SAT, ACT, GRE, ...) have biases and imperfections of their own.

HjiqMDI6aa	Normally, for any talk, there has to be a clear message sent across. Fair enough, you are doing it on a band, but what is your point?<br>  <br>  A good talk will need:<br>  <br>  1) Research into getting the facts spot on<br>  2) Personal interest. It's no good talking about mummification for the Egyptians if you don't even like it.<br>  3) A few jokes or puns every now and then so that not everyone is bored<br>  4) Say what you truly think your opinion is.<br>  <br>  I did 'Chain mails are bad' for mine and another talk I did was 'Bad Social Networking Site Habits'.<br>  <br>  Whatever topic you choose you should believe in it. Choose something different - not like animals rights or anorexic celebs or something. Do something like:<br>  <br>  1) Old people and their bad habits<br>  2) Weird kings in history<br>  3) 10 Random laws in countries<br>  4) Stairs and how they can kill you<br>  5) Why it is good to be vain<br>  6) If the world was made of chocolate...<br>  7) If I had a billion pounds...<br>  8) How people can rip you off on eBay<br>  <br>  Be quirky, be exciting and sometimes in talks, being stupid is what gets you the A*. Worked for me at least! Do a lot of thought processing, mind maps etc. for your chosen topic and research it well if you are giving facts. Have a solid point and throw in a few jokes. Also, playing the clown helps sometimes as long as you stick to your point so if you have to grossly exaggerate your point - DON'T BE AFRAID!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NV43ZXoMaa	Talk about a fave country of yours i did mine on america and i got a really good grade. and it lasted longer than 5 mins!! =]|`|wHWtWT1paa	OK you should do it on something you already know quite a lot about.

J18K52Wtaa	Birds have what is called "uni hemispheric" , this means that one half of the brain works and the other rests. They are cuddled together and are so small and have a certain type of balance to them, the wind is lighter then the bird and the bird usually will not be knocked off of a branch. If they feel any threat-the part of the brain which is awake will alert them that they are in danger and must move.

For example, if you took a biology class with no lab, but the other university's bio class includes a lab, then your course would not be comparable.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, you should talk with the admission's counselor of the university you want to attend. They'll be the one's doing the credit comparison to inform you of what they will or will not accept.

Med8LbTcaa	Please do not listen to those people talking down about homeschooling. Homeschooling is a great option for people with these kinds of problems.<br>  <br>  I had all those problems when I was in school although I was much younger, in second grade. Beginning in third grade, my mom decided to homeschool me and I became much calmer, more focused, and I actually started to love school. Now I'm in seventh grade and instead of worrying about silly problems at school which tend to pull a person behind, I am thinking and working on more important things. <br>  <br>  I am looking into K12 too for eighth grade (use Calvert right now). I believe K12 has enrollment by season, meaning you have to wait for the next enrollment period before you can begin school. I believe the next date is sometime mid March. However, I think you can enroll anytime as a transfer student. If K12 somehow doesn't fit for you, there are many other accredited online homeschool programs.<br>  <br>  Also, to the person who said you can socialize when homeschooled, there are many different angles to that. The beauty of homeschooling is that you can participate in a lot more social activities. I do ballet twice a week, and am also in a homeschooling class for medical science at the local community college once a week. It's the best form of socialization I've ever had.<br>  <br>  Persuading your parents to homeschool you shouldn't be that hard. Just show them you can do it, you really want to do it, and they will let you do it. Good luck, and have fun with homeschooling!|`|S21940Fkaa	There are many reasons for homeschooling and there are many homeschooling options and different curriculum to choose.  I can understand that it would be incredibly frustrating not being able to ask questions that's why you should research something other than K12.  Some of the brightest and most well adjusted students/adults are or have been homeschooled. <br>  <br>  To enhance your social life check with teen programs and community centers near you, sports leagues, classes (swimming, drama, etc.)  There are so many options I have trouble narrowing them down for my sons.  <br>  <br>  They are mostly self taught and ask me maybe 2 questions per day.  It was not an easy transition but after 2 years they work 5 subjects in 4 hours instead of 7.  Maybe you can save your questions til eve when your parents or even other school age friends are able to sit for a study session.  See, options....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2nXBcSfBaa	I myself am homeschooled by k12. I agree with the first poster, you do not want to homeschool. It is so hard to understand without someone guiding you, helping you see what you did wrong and stuff. You will miss being around people. I hardly ever see my friends anymore, and really miss social interaction. They have their dinky little field trips every now and then, but they are so lame and its awkward being surrounded by other kids that you dont know.|`|AA12370001	Drama at school and having some girl steal your friends is no reason to be home schooled and change the entire dynamic of your life, your parent's life and your family's life.  Deal with the drama by ignorning it and find some other friends that won't turn on you and go to some other person.  Get involved with other clubs and groups and make some new friends.<br>  <br>  You are being selfish and are not thinking of anyone else in this case.  You are using this as a way to get out of a situation that is easily solved.|`|oPfuSTfUaa	take it from a homeschooler..it sucksss! get new friends or get someone to help you. but your goin to regret picking homeschool  when you get older!
KxymQPuDaa	I'm a sophomore at FLC in Durango CO. The first year of college is usually the hardest. It's kind of like high school only harder. I advice you to take mostly gen ed classes your first year.  You have a lot more freedom at college. You aren't forced to go to class by anyone. Living in the dorms is a lot of fun. I'm still friends with most of the kids from my old dorm. Above all, college is what you make of it.
wSMBLtL8aa	I have had both top and bottom. I preferred the top. The climb up can be a pain sometimes but it is up and away from the rest of the space. There is more privacy with the top bunk. Also, you don't have people sitting on your bed when guests are over hanging out. The bottom bunk is more convenient to be used as additional seating. But it is really your preference, there is no right or wrong answer. I have had both and survived each time.|`|AA12021966	I haven't had either in my college dorm rooms. I probably would have preferred the bottom bunk though.
AeyqcqVvaa	Regression Equation <br>  A regression equation allows us to express the relationship between two (or more) variables algebraically. It indicates the nature of the relationship between two (or more) variables. In particular, it indicates the extent to which you can predict some variables by knowing others, or the extent to which some are associated with others.<br>  <br>  <br>  A linear regression equation is usually written <br>  Y = a + bX + e <br>  where <br>  Y is the dependent variable <br>  a is the intercept <br>  b is the slope or regression coefficient <br>  X is the independent variable (or covariate) <br>  e is the error term <br>  <br>  The equation will specify the average magnitude of the expected change in Y given a change in X.<br>  <br>  The regression equation is often represented on a scatterplot by a regression line.<br>  <br>  A regression line is a line drawn through the points on a scatterplot to summarise the relationship between the variables being studied. When it slopes down (from top left to bottom right), this indicates a negative or inverse relationship between the variables; when it slopes up (from bottom right to top left), a positive or direct relationship is indicated.<br>  <br>  The regression line often represents the regression equation on a scatterplot
pt6wIlS1aa	Sensory areas are things like vision, hearing, touch. Not just being able to see, for example, but being able to make sense of what you see, or being able to find a figure against a patterned background (known as figure-ground discrimination). <br>  <br>  If you and your husband haven't been concerned about your son, then he may have something really minor. or else it's something subtle that might not affect him until school, when he starts learning reading or math. Or maybe he's just developing a little more slowly than average - which doesn't mean he's slow, so don't panic.<br>  <br>  If neither you nor the doctor had concerns, how did you come to be filling out the questionnaire in the first place? What is the role of this woman who called you, and what kind of evaluation is he having next week?<br>  <br>  Certainly you parents would NOT be at fault.|`|AA11247439	Sensory processing (sometimes called "sensory integration" or SI) is a term that refers to the way the nervous system receives messages from the senses and turns them into appropriate motor and behavioral responses. Whether you are biting into a hamburger, riding a bicycle, or reading a book, your successful completion of the activity requires processing sensation or "sensory integration." <br>  <br>  Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD, formerly known as "sensory integration dysfunction") is a condition that exists when sensory signals don't get organized into appropriate responses. Pioneering occupational therapist and neuroscientist A. Jean Ayres, PhD, likened SPD to a neurological "traffic jam" that prevents certain parts of the brain from receiving the information needed to interpret sensory information correctly. A person with SPD finds it difficult to process and act upon information received through the senses, which creates challenges in performing countless everyday tasks. Motor clumsiness, behavioral problems, anxiety, depression, school failure, and other impacts may result if the disorder is not treated effectively. <br>  <br>  <br>  What SPD looks like<br>  SPD can affect people in only one sense–for example, just touch or just sight or just movement–or in multiple senses. One person with SPD may over-respond to sensation and find clothing, physical contact, light, sound, food, or other sensory input to be unbearable. Another might under-respond and show little or no reaction to stimulation, even pain or extreme hot and cold. In children whose sensory processing of messages from the muscles and joints is impaired, posture and motor skills can be affected. These are the "floppy babies" who worry new parents and the kids who get called "klutz" and "spaz" on the playground. Still other children exhibit an appetite for sensation that is in perpetual overdrive. These kids often are misdiagnosed - and inappropriately medicated - for ADHD. <br>  <br>  SPD is most commonly diagnosed in children, but people who reach adulthood without treatment also experience symptoms and continue to be affected by their inability to accurately and appropriately interpret sensory messages. <br>  <br>  These "sensational adults" may have difficulty performing routines and activities involved in work, close relationships, and recreation. Because adults with SPD have struggled for most of their lives, they may also experience depression, underachievement, social isolation, and/or other secondary effects. <br>  <br>  Sadly, misdiagnosis is common because many health care professionals are not trained to recognize sensory issues. The SPD Foundation is dedicated to researching these issues, educating the public and professionals about their symptoms and treatment, and advocating for those who live with Sensory Processing Disorder and sensory challenges associated with other conditions.

If you don't earn all your pell or stay in the classes the whole time, and the earned amount doesn't cover your charges, then you have to pay the school that amount back. <br>  <br>  As for your loans, you get 6 months consectively dropping below part time. Then you have to start repaying or do be eligible for a forebearance.|`|PebbnptYaa	well, for the grant issue idk u'll have to ask someone who's responsible and knows about it, i believe they might say smthn about it?<br>  i dont think 'll get ur credit for this semester if u drop now,,,im not telling u 2 stay in college, like u said u know whats best for u,,,but a<br>  finish this semester, it would make alot of things easier.<br>  dont think u'll get a refund on ur money,<br>  good luck with everything. florida is a nice place, u might be able to make money easily, its gonna be hard at first to start a new life<br>  but its worth it?
VZ21gL81aa	ok, you can drop in the middle of a semester. See the catalog and FA office BEFORE you do anything rash though.<br>  <br>  Your loans will become due, with a 6 month grace period as of the date you withdraw. You would 'consolidate' your loans. Your monthly payment depends on how long you want to pay for them. (There are online loan payment calculators).<br>  <br>  Academically, you earn no credit for this semester. <br>  <br>  IF you can, stick it out for this semester, since you will no doubt by now get no money back, and you will have poured a lot of money into somethng for which you receive no benefit.<br>  <br>  Although you have your mind made up, my sincere advice is to drop out AFTER the semester. I would go so far as to register for Fall classes, then drop out in August, this delays your repayment timetable.|`|AA12032374	when you drop out mid semester, you will not get your money (that has already been paid) back. If there is a balance owed, you will still owe that.If you have a grant, that will expire. When you finally decide to go back to school, you will have to reapply for that grant.If you have federal money for school, you will have to start repaying that in 6 months. Just remember the interest will start accumulating immediately.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No, you don't get your money back if you drop out that late - usually only within the first few weeks, and even then you can't get all of it back.  You still have to pay back the loans.  You can apply for a deferment so you don't have to start paying them back for 6 months or so after you leave, but you will have to pay them back.  If you are planning to go back eventually, you'd be much better off finishing the semester - you can finish earning the credits you paid for.  Drop out now and it was just a waste of money - and a huge hit to your GPA (you'll get all F's this semester).

How weird is that!...okay it's not that amazing but whatever.<br>  <br>  I had to take the first sentence from a book (mine was Stephen King's "It"), I then had to carry on the story. You could try grabbing a random book (preferably one you haven't read), open it at any page and then read a bit, then see if you imagination can carry out the story.<br>  <br>  You could write a "Day in the Life" story, Start it of as if the main character is a human but have a twist towards the end that tells the reader that it is actually an animal or something else.

It looks all good and fun, but leaves you with a sick and icky feeling inside. Negative thinking will get in your way, constantly hindering you in your everyday life. Your self esteem will drop, along with your evaluation of other people, even your friends. Negative thinking has many negative results. Some are that you will be looked down upon, both by others and yourself. Another is you won't be able to do as much because you're busy feeling bad. Finally, the worst thing that you could possibly do to yourself would be to become a negative thinker.<br>  There are many forms of positive thinking, but that does not make it an easy skill to come by. The easiest way is to never start thinking in the negative way. If you do, however hard you try, begin to think bad, here is some advice to help you break your bad habit. first, discover what is making you feel bad about yourself. Second, try hard to do the opposite (note: This will take some time to get used to. Don't get discouraged and keep at it). if you procrastinate, make a schedule and stick to it. Not only will you feel better, you will be able to force yourself to do some of the things that make you feel worse.The effects of being a positive thinker are some of the most notable changes possible. People will look at you differently than they used to. you will feel better. You will get better grades from your newfound confidence. Finally you will inadvertently change into and more creative, nice, caring, and fun-to-be-around individual.|`|wuDWThH0aa	just take it easy friend! Life is so COOooL! So just enjoy it to the fullest!

a66nvk0taa	Firstly you won't get a job in Germany. No language school or state school would employ you. Why? you have to have a degree as well as a T.E.F.L Certificate/Diploma. Two your not an EU citizen. There the German speak very good English. Remember they study languages at a very early age in schools there. Irish and British teach English all over Europe been EU citizens plus haven't to go through red tape to employ a non EU citizen. Plus an employer has to prove that he/she can't get someone to do the job meaning they have to advertise the job in all 28 EU countries before they would take someone from outside the EU. I'm Danish and speak and write good English. Just live right beside Germany. Look on the map and you see Denmark. Arhus is my home place. But if your from the UK make sure you have a degree plus postgraduate certificate in education PGCE to teach in Germany.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	No, as they mostly already know english, having learned it thrioughout their schooling....If I were you, I'd look into teaching english in SE Asia or the UAE...both pay very well, though they each have their ups and downs....|`|Scq7n4dkaa	I WOULD HARDLEY DOUBT YOUD GET A JOB WITH 4 YEARS OF GERMAN AS GERMANY ISNT BAD SOME GERMANS SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH THAN US sorry for the caps just forgot!!!!

5frOVAgSaa	you should also show the paper to ur head of department and then just pray for the best and let the things flow. according to my personal experience at university, it is unwise to argue with teachers even when you know you are right because who knows if they will hold a grudge against u in the future and that can dent ur grades in other courses as well.|`|809245c84f901f4623e72189b3866e79aa	What reason was given besides "I don't agree with your opinion"  Or were you supposed to write a paper on one topic and chose to do something different thinking if you turned it in it had to be accepted?

There are only 28 Vet schools in the US.  All are excellent, but have residency requirements -- so there will only be one or two Vet schools that will consider you.  I actually know people who became medical doctors because they couldn't get into Vet school.  <br>  <br>  In order to become a Vet, you need to do everything perfectly.  You need to volunteer with a Vet, you need to go to a good college for your BS, you need nearly perfect grades and you will need high test scores.<br>  <br>  The following link will give you more information.

It's a more business-type environment, while Emerson is far more artsy. Emerson is the stronger school, though. <br>  <br>  You should still apply to both, and see both where you get in and what sort of financial aid they offer you. Do campus visits at both, see how you feel. Then decide.<br>  <br>  I wonder, if you like Suffolk, and have the grades for Emerson, if you may not like and maybe be able to get into Bentley? I know it's outside of Boston, and not in it, but it's a good school and I wonder if you might not like it?<br>  <br>  Another college I might have you look at is Northeastern. Good business program, right in the city, solid university, and if you suspect you have the grades for Emerson, you may want to try for Northeastern as well.

However, that's on a real IQ test, and if you had taken a real IQ test, they would have told you that, so you wouldn't need to ask us - which means you took an internet IQ test.

They may invent new games or use the available tools in unanticipated ways, forcing the plan to change.<br>  <br>  Once my son discovered the concepts of the screwdriver and the hammer, he started disassembling objects, toys, and safety mechanisms.  Even without actual hammers or screwdrivers (boy, we hid those fast!) he was able to use the concept of the tools to develop substitutes, and has taken apart the kiddy gate, tv remotes, electrical outlets, and other things that have given us panic attacks.  He started doing this at 2, and is now almost 3.

Emu6AG6caa	The entry requirements needed to get into nursing are, a degree or a diploma in nursing (a ‘pre-registration’ programme),  5 GCSE’s or equivalent at grade c or above and 3 A-levels or equivalent for a degree programme.       <br>   The skills required for a nurse would be the similar for every job in the health sector. The skills would be great people skills along with good communication and observation skills. I would need to have the ability to answer questions and offer plenty of advice and reassurance.  To be able to work as part of a team and not becoming emotionally attached to any of the patients.        <br>   The experience needed for the nursing sector would be spent in a hospital or even a nursing home. This could be done through work placement or even a part time job. You would also need to shadow a nurse for a year to be fully registered. <br>  It is always good to have knowledge and this can be obtained through study and research.  <br>  The apprenticeship framework for nursing would be doing your GCSE’s then doing a BTEC national diploma in health and social care or 3 A-levels in science or a NVQ and then go to university to do a degree.

TrHPjbKKaa	A consumer: One that consumes, especially one that acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing. A consumer is an end user.<br>  <br>  A customer: One that buys goods or services. A customer can in turn resell to a consumer. <br>  <br>  For example, the customer can be a toy store who buys from a major brand manufacturer of toy products. The toy store sells to a consumer - the end user.<br>  <br>  Another example:  When you buy a car, you are a customer of the dealership you buy from.  But you are a consumer of the seatbelt or air bag that is installed in the vehicle (you didn't purchase them separately)|`|aFzqYyLSaa	not a whole lot, but you can be a consumer without being a customer, you can consume goods that you didn't buy.

AA11604732	This kind of information is not published.<br>  <br>  However, it is probably lower than that of most other majors.

Dh0JX2Onaa	It is a good warning. Prepare for the real MCAT./<br>  <br>  Information may be found below for MCAT study materials. Some of them are free./|`|mhFpZT3laa	It's a good look at what you would score right now on the MCAT. Obviously, you haven't studied the 500+ hours necessary. So its kinda a scam because people take a practice MCAT without studying and almost always do poorly because of this. Kaplan isn't lieing, they are just taking advantage of the fact that most people take the exams they offer before they study. Kaplan's materials are good though.

It's quite important. <br>  <br>  You should, of course, also ask people what they think, but if there is any way at all of you getting to these unis and doing a visit, I want you to do so. <br>  <br>  For example, when I was chosing between unis, I thought I wanted to go to Uni A. I was sure of it... until I visited both it and Uni B. After that, I realized that Uni B was a better fit for me, and that's where I went.|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Er...isn't it obvious?

AA10465540	A provisional license, if even available would limit your employment opportunities.  It is much better to regret taking an extra semester than to regret not taking it.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	You could do that, but you'll have a much easier time getting a job if you get your student teaching finished now.  If you get the provisional license you have either 1 year or 3 years to obtain your actual license.  (I've heard that they are changing the rules on this, so I'm not sure if it's 1 or 3 years.)  Student teaching is a great way to learn how to manage a classroom.  You'll learn more from your student teaching than you did in most of your classes.  It's a very valuable experience and I don't think it's a good idea to be thrown in a teaching job when you don't have that student teaching under your belt.  <br>  <br>  Requirements for a VA License:<br>  You must take and pass the VRA, VCLA, and PRAXIS II.<br>  Successfully complete student teaching or graduate from a 4 year college or university with a state approved education program.  <br>  Child abuse training.  You can do this online and it doesn't take long.  Look for it on the VA Dept of Education website.  They list the other requirements there too in case I've forgotten anything.

a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	Yea but what kind of jobs that's what the trade school I went to said and then they were offering help getting jobs that paid less than the job I already had. If I had to do it again I would not go to a school like that. I would look for classes at my community college. its cheaper and you learn more. The class I took was medical insurance billing. That place finally went out of business, it was a really shady school, apparantly they were just ripping everyone off, first of all by admitting people with obviously very low IQ's even though they knew the program may be to diffiuclt for them, and then "helping" them pass tests and so on so the could take their money, it was really scandalous and a weird place all the way around. And I've heard stories about other schools like that too. It's like they arent realy learning anything but they don't know what else to do with their lives and they are infatuated with the idea of "being in college" or "doing something with their lives" It's sad really that a place like that would take advantage of people like that. <br>  <br>  I dont really know that much about it though I just know I had to pay that student loan back of couse and that's never fun.<br>  <br>  .  My sister went to a place called apollo college I think here in Portland Or and she got a semi decent job after but again Im not so sure she couldnt have gone to a community college for that same training for cheaper.

AA10706568	To answer your first question, no, you do not use a semicolon in that sentence. You're supposed to use a semicolon to link two independent clauses that aren't directly related.

An example of the correct use of a semicolon is the following: Everyone stood shocked around the bloody scene; Mary let out a small whimper. <br>  <br>  The difference between a comma and a semicolon is that a comma is used to separate dependent and independent clauses, to introduce direct speech, and to mark of elements in a sequence of words and phrases (Ex: shoes, purses, coats, and bags).|`|KBh6jKCTaa	Joe, my brother, is awesome.<br>  <br>  Joe is my brother; he is awesome.<br>  <br>  Joe is my brother, and he is awesome.<br>  <br>  semicolon works like a period, and it separates two complete thoughts.<br>  comma is used to separate thoughts, but not complete subject-verb sentences like the semicolon. <br>  rule of thumb: if you can put a period there and both thoughts make sense, go with the semicolon. if you can't, go with the comma (comma is also used to separate sentences with a conjunction - (like and)|`|FI4meAMmaa	Use semicolon when separating two complete thoughts which could be complete sentences.

Also, Alexander Graham Bell, Benjamin Franklin, the Wright brothers, Eli Whitney, Albert Einstein, Booker T. Washington... ; D<br>  <br>  I took my sons out of public school in K and 2nd grade because I felt the need to include more arts and creativity and free learning in there educational diet. We do stick close to our daily schedule but the teaching and learning is free hand (for lack of a better discription). We've been going for 2 years and it works very well for us.  They are both atleast 1 grade level above our area school and they do 5 subjects in less than 4 hours daily.  <br>  <br>  We have a community center  where they socialize in afternoons and weekends.  They participate in league sports, guitar, church and community plays and I have always been a 'family field trip' kind of person so they get that too.<br>  <br>  My best advise is to stick to why you dedided to home school and build EVERYTHING regarding homeschooling around that.  It's so easy to get off track, bog yourself down, fall into someone else's ideals, etc.  Homeschooling is a wonderful option so keep it wonderful!  Good luck...|`|ldElfsOCaa	Absolutely you can not make a better choice for her. And for a head start...the correct term is home education. The term you have used and most use is actually inaccurate as you are teaching a child, not a group. This will make you look smarter knowing this! Anyway, home education is far superior to school in that you can teach your child in a way that is suited to their unique abilities. It is not hard, but you do need to know the law. Read it carefully as many and most school districts will ask for more than the law requires. Do not let them intimidate you. If you know the law and they know this, things will run very smoothly. It has been a great experience for me and my day goes by without the normal every day school and homework frustrations, and my child has time to be a child! However it is wise to involve your child in extracurricular activities but don't feel pressured to overwhelm them. Remember socialization is talking with people of all ages, etc. NOT sitting in a classroom with kids all of the same age and the need to raise your hand to speak to an adult, and often to speak at all except maybe at recess or lunch. Not to mention the chance of bullying or popularity pressures which usually only occur in groups of stressed out kids...hence school. How in the world did this become the socialization standard? These are just some key things to remember as opinions on them are sure to cross your path. Absolutely do not believe you have to buy tons of text and materials, or spend hours on end to teach your daughter. These are opinions of people who are poor parents or who have never experienced home educating, yet still seem to have an opinion as if they have. Children are curious learners by nature and if you are a good parent who talks with your child, you will do fine. Let them watch you balance your checkbook and involve them in store purchases at the register, meal planning, etc. Life is learning, all you need to do is include them and you are teaching them. Remember that a child will only learn when they are interested in something. Grasp onto what interests them and don't push something they are not ready for or you will butt heads. Play educational games, go on field trips...you can have so much fun with this. Recently I decided to buy a composition book to encourage writing with my daughter. I started a story and we continue on from what each of us wrote. Each day we will do a page and continue each others story. She loves it. I give my daughter materials such as educational reading, art supplies, etc. She picks what she likes and doesn't even realize she's learning most of the time. If you supply the resources, they will find something they like and you can do this while never sitting down to a text book. They WILL learn. Yes it may not be all the same as what is being taught at the school, but we are all individuals with individual interests. So saying a child is behind is ludicrous. This is only possible if the child is stuck in a room with no resources, no interaction, no love, etc. I hope this makes sense. Just don't let people get you down with their stereotype opinions about what level a child should be at and when, or that socialization is only achieved in schools. Your child will blossom at what level is best for her rather than the possibility of being behind because a letter grade isn't quite where it should be. Most adults know the basics to live life adequately no matter what letter grades they had in school. Yet so much emphasis is still placed on letter grades and levels. When something special comes along your child wants to do, she will reach for it without fear of falling behind because of letter grade pressures,  previous criticism , or opinions. All of which only make children feel bad about themselves, and often they begin to label themselves as stupid. Many of them give up and are placed in special education (which also labels them) simply because they can't get that letter grade they need to have at the time it is demanded. Many of these children are not behind or slow at all. They just did not have an interest in what was being taught at the time and then they are pressured to create a false interest which makes them hate school, stresses them out, and turns them into quitters. Often in special education they stay where they continue life feeling less. Not all children go this route, but is shows how much is demanded from children today. They need to come home and spend time with family, not to do more "home"work. Remember these are our children, they are not human encyclopedias. How many times have you tried memorizing something for a test, you take the test, pass it, have a sigh of relief that it's over, and then forget everything moments later....school teaches children to forget. We cannot retain information that does not interest us or that we do not regularly use. Teach your child how to find information when they need it, to do research and they will continue to learn their whole lives.

AA10023710	First, do you plan to study fashion design, or something in fashion business? If it's design, then your portfolio is going to hold more weight than your GPA or ACT. If your portfolio is strong enough, you may still get in. This is especially true at art schools like Parsons and Fashion Institute of Technology - btw, two of the top fashion schools in the US. <br>  <br>  Where do you want to go to school? I assume NY, but are you open to other regions? I ask because the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, and the Academy of Art University, both in California, are open admissions. That means that they will let you in no matter your ACT, your grades, and even the state of your portfolio. They are no where near as good a school as FIT or Parsons (or Drexel, or Otis, or RISD, or Kent State University - all good options), but if you can't get into a better school, they are absolutely an option for you. <br>  <br>  I know that Kent State has a great fashion program, and they really aren't all that difficult a university to get into. I think you may stand a chance there, if you can write a decent application. <br>  <br>  Are you near NY now? Westchester Community College has the Westchester Arts Workshop in White Plains, NY. It's a community college, so it will let you in no problem, and it's cheap, if you're from NY State. But it's also a pure art school. If you do well there, and get your associates, you can transfer to any great art school in the US, including Parsons. And did I mention, it's cheap?<br>  <br>  If you're from NY, FIT is also cheap for you. It's a SUNY. You really need to apply there, as one of your options. It's an amazing school, and again, cheap! <br>  <br>  When you apply to schools, you'll also apply for financial aid using the FAFSA form (google it, and speak to your HS guidance counsellor). Financial aid will help you pay for school.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	your childhood experiences have nothing to do with being able to get into college.  All college cares about are numbers... as in your GPA, test scores, and money.<br>  There are TONS of schools who don't really care what grades you previously got.  You need to contact a local school in your area, ask to speak with admissions, and let them know you are interested in finding a fashion school and see if they will help you do it- they probably will.<br>  Many schools will work with you on payment.  You can get a government grant (Pell Grant) if in fact your family has no money.  If you are under 23 yrs old, it goes by how much money your parents/guardian made the previous year.  If it is low enough, they give you money for school that you don't have to pay back.<br>  Many schools also offer financial aid, in which you can go to school there and then when you graduate you pay them a certain amount each month after you are working until you pay them back. (be careful though.... financial aid is terrible if you miss a payment- if you thought a credit card company could be harassing from missing a payment you haven't seen a thing)<br>  It doesn't matter what your background is whatsoever usually for school like fashion or beauty school.  It just matters if you are willing to sign up for financial assistance, put one foot in front of the other, and show up to class all the time.|`|zBZo1idcaa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

byjniI5raa	Although each village in Bali has its own individual character, the schools all share common problems. Classrooms are uniformly basic, and all too frequently in poor physical condition. Roofs often leak, and with desks, doors & windows broken. Teachers struggle under rudimentary conditions with few, if any, educational materials or teaching aids. Even so, many of these dedicated individuals long for more training and better teaching tools. The children respond with heartwarming enthusiasm to the smallest improvements, their minds full of curiosity and eager to learn.<br>  <br>  The BCP support of schools was initially limited to supplying much-needed teaching materials.  Later, through the volunteer program, we were able to offer classes in English and environmental education.<br>  <br>  We have been able to help with urgent maintainance of school buildings, and are actively seeking organisations willing to adopt a Balinese school.  Future plans include providing more opportunities for teachers to receive further training .<br>  <br>  <br>   Kindergartens and Pre-schools <br>  <br>   An exciting BCP development has been the creation of a growing number of  kindergartens and pre-schools.  Two are operating in rural Tabanan Regency, and another  opened in 2004 in the village of Penestanan outside Ubud.  A further kindergarten  opened in the mountain village of Tamblingan, and another in the mountain village of Wanagiri.  The latest are in Tanggup and Katik Lantang.   In several cases the kindergartens we have created have since been taken over and run by the local government aministration.<br>  <br>  The hands-on approach encourges children to learn by exploration and self-discovery. In so doing they acquire important life skills not taught by conventional rote learning.  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  There is a constant need for teaching aids and educational equipment.  The BCP kindergartens also welcome experienced volunteer teachers and teacher trainers able to come to Bali for a prolonged stay - ideally six months or more.

SMezBOmiaa	Interracial marriage was never allowed in Virginia until 1967. Furthermore, fourteen of the Southern states approved “one-drop rule”, which states that citizens with black ancestors must be classified as slaves. In the late 1800's, a shoemaker named Homer Plessy boarded a train restricted only to white passengers. Plessy was seven-eighth white and one-eighth black. However, under the law in Louisiana, any person with any African American ancestors would be considered black . Plessy was arrested for violating the Louisiana Separate Car Act. In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled against him.  It was deemed acceptable for blacks and whites to have separate but equal facilities. <br>  <br>  Desiree had an unknown background, and because of this, Armand assumed that she was part black. She was married with the wealthy white man, but was then dismissed with her black son. This story is very symbolic of racism. One of these symbols pertaining to racism pronounced here: “Young Anbigny’s rule was a strict one,too, and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay” ,

You need to get yourself a tutor now.  Algebra is difficult to figure out on your own; if your parents haven't been able to help you, you need to get outside help.  You could try expensive tutors, with tutoring companies, or school teachers who tutor on the side, or you could find another student who's done well in algebra--that's the cheapest option usually.  <br>  <br>  You didn't say "how" you are homeschooling.  Are you in an online program?  Correspondence classes?  Working from books at home?  Or what?<br>  <br>  If possible, quit the current algebra class that you are in.  Begin again, with a tutor to help you get through the parts that give you difficulty.  A different curriculum might help, too, since some are easier to follow than others.  But mostly, you need someone to help you whenever you don't get something, since the material in algebra builds upon itself and students quickly get lost if they try to keep moving on without understanding the previous material.<br>  <br>  (Going into public school won't necessarily solve the problem.  You still might need the tutor there.  So, figure out a way to get one now and see if you can lick this problem without rearranging your entire educational program.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|uCVaw2F0aa	Hi, I'm homeschooled too.

Now would be as good a time as any to branch out and learn a third language. Spanish, and Mandarin are the two most common foriegn languages that students learn these days besides french. Why not try picking up one of those.|`|OVzIN9Yraa	French is not necessary for University, unless you're planning to major in a French program. At the same time, French is a good skill. Knowing the language wont hurt you, and it is an asset in many jobs across Canada. It is ultimately up to you- if your not interested in the language and not doing good in it, then there is really no point in taking it. Focus on what your interested, your strengths, and what you want to study to help prepare for your career.
DfLpoKLYaa	Hold a chili cookoff. Charge people to put their chili pot into the contest and also charge people to attend. You'd have to advertise fast.<br>  <br>  OR, you could hold an all-night rock-a-thon one weekend and get sponsors. That would be the easiest thing to do. You'll never a lot of HOSA students to participate. Get the students to rock in rocking chairs all night and they are sponsored by the amount of hours they rock. Like, Try to get people to sponsor you for $3-5 per hour. 3x24hrs=$72 or 5x24hrs=$120 It'll add up fast.<br>  <br>  Silent auctions are good, but you have to go around and collect items, and you don't have a lot of time.
IhZeoXqvaa	Nearly all people who take time off of school and do not finish said that they would go back.  I would not do it if I were you, but it is ultimately your decision.  If you are questioning it to the point that you are asking other people who have never met you, it's probably a bad idea though.|`|WSVN66wyaa	You can do what you want, but bare in mind that if you leave school there's a good chance you might not go back.|`|ZCCZT9agaa	Well with this economy disaster we are passing through and the state of California being one of the biggest in debt states would they even give you a loan for school. And referring back to your question I think you should take a year off to save money because you don't want to be like those graduate students that take finish school and then owe so much money that it takes them a few years to pay it. so basically you r working to pay off a debt. screw that take a year off it will be better.|`|WrXQfYTeaa	Well firstly,are you absolutely sure that you can claim residency after year? Having transferred schools wayy too many times, I am no stranger to calling admissions constantly and heckling them with questions, I would say try that with as much as you can, so you get the absolute facts. The thing about finishing school late, I really don't know your situation, are you getting in undergrad or grad school? It technically doesnt really matter how long it takes you, as long as youre comfortable with it. I have pre-med friends, who are very brilliant, but will be in undergrad school a bit longer simply because they forgot to take a certain course. Dont worry about the "stigma" attached to being in school longer, but remember how difficult it can be to get back into the swing of things after only a summer off. Then imagine a year off. Do what is best for you, even if it may be the more difficult path.|`|3Jqn7a3Vaa	If you will save a lot of money, I would take a year off.  What is really the difference if you finish when you are 25 vs 24 years old?  That's still a very young age and you'll have plenty of time to get your career going.  You can also try to work hard this next year and save money to help your future college costs and further prevent large loans.  <br>  <br>  You just have to realize that while your friends will begin to start their careers, you will still be in school, struggling with money and living a different life.  If you can accept this reality, your plan will work.|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	in my opinion continue with school. school in my opinion is more im important. i know there are loans to be paid and how the economy right now is bad. if you have to pay for your schooling in any way try financial aid. of fafsa etc. i know how you feel your tired of being in school cause weve been doing it our whole lives. see if your can do all of the above. if you can claim residency finish school. the choice is yours its best that you have a plan and if it all works out in the end you should be fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck ^_^

qJ0Y07EGaa	It gives credence to your "opinion;" makes it more palatable to the other person.
lPdCTyOAaa	A freshman in HS?  College?  Based on your question, I'd say you should be an ultrasound tech.  <br>  <br>  Your question is pretty bizarre and demonstrates a lack of understanding and a lack of attention to detail - both of which are critical of pediatricians.  Also, the two careers are so very different.  It's like asking..."I'm thinking of joining the Navy.  Should I fly fighter planes from an aircraft carrier, or should I be a cook at a training base?"  The differences in pay, in prestige, in duties, in training regimens, and in mental and personal requirements are like comparing apples and drawbridges.<br>  <br>  A pediatrician is a medical doctor.  This will require excellent grades in challenging courses in college (along with a good score on a standardized test, the MCAT) so that you can get into medical school.  Once you get into medical school, you have four very difficult years of education while you rack up considerable debt.  After that you've got at least three years of residency, where you work investment-banker hours and pull down a waiter's salary (no big deal...you've no time to spend it anyway).<br>  <br>  Becoming an ultrasound (note the spelling) tech is a much less demanding process.  A bachelor's degree is unnecessary (though perhaps some prerequisites are).  They typical program last 21 months...two school years and a summer.  It is a vastly less prestigious job, and requires much less intelligence, hard work, and time.  Naturally, it pays less too, but it still pays pretty well.  I think the median salaries are about $70,000, which is definitely nothing to sneeze at - particularly without a college degree.<br>  <br>  In fact, it may be the more sensible financial option.  Pediatricians are somewhat on the low end of the MD pay scale (can't give you numbers, sorry), even though it's still a lot better than being an ultrasound tech.  But their training also requires years of foregone income and significant debt.  With aggressive saving and sensible investment, those extra 8 years or so working and lack of debt will mean that it will be YEARS before the pediatrician has caught up to you financially.  It is also worth considering the fact that you will have much less stress and will work fewer hours.|`|WrXQfYTeaa	Um, well you misspelled "ultrasound", btw. <br>  Since you're only a freshman, you still have some time to explore a bit and see what you're good at. Schooling for becoming a pediatrician will take much longer and be way more intense, keeping in mind it will take up your life. If you love kids and plan to have some of your own eventually, you would probably want to spend time with them, and with a career in medicine, that can frequently get compromised, since it is a very demanding occupation, I would say try volunteering at a hospital or something, if youre looking into a career in medicine, that way it will look good on your resume and you can be exposed to many types of possible careers in that field.|`|Dsr5X8HAaa	It is ultrasound.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide what you want to be and since you already can't spell, you seem to be showing sign of heading towards M.D.|`|AA11604732	Given the information you provide, there is no way that anyone can give you a good answer.<br>  <br>  However, your question is kind of odd -- kind of like asking "Should I be a CEO of a large company or a clerk at WalMart?"<br>  <br>  Pediatricians are medical doctors, who get a Bachelor's Degree, then go to medical school for four years, followed by a year as a medical intern and a five year residency in Pediatrics.  They make hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.<br>  <br>  Ultrasound Technicians have a high school degree and a couple months of training.  They make about $50K per year.<br>  <br>  You need to do a little more research.|`|ZCCZT9agaa	I remember a year ago I was in your same shoes trying to decide between the engineering field and the medical field. And after my second year of college i still am not sure what i want to be. You shouldn't decide based on what people have to tell u. You don't want to do a career because of someone telling you. You want to do it because you are passionate about it and like to have fun while doing it.

AA11604732	There are no prestigious online programs.<br>  <br>  Most online universities are For Profit corporations with no admissions standards.

AA11604732	It depends.  Do you want a low paying job when you graduate, or a REALLY low paying job?<br>  <br>  Both degrees attract three kinds of people:  Those who don't know what they want to do; those who are lazy & want an easy major; Those who aren't bright enough to do a more challenging degree.  For that reason, these majors are at the bottom of the list when you look at Starting Salaries by degree.<br>  <br>  Why not major in Economics and take a few classes in each discipline.  At least then you might be able to get a job when you graduate.|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	Sociology.|`|e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	Just so you know, you could major in both.  A lot of people do.  I am double-majoring.  Personally, I would do Sociology.  I don't really care for American History so I'm pretty biased.  But you have more options with a Sociology degree as well.  You could go into business or counseling, etc, if you didn't want to teach.
6ZKdO0Iqaa	If you've decided definitively that you want to pursue a particular field, it's better to attend a school that offers a major in that field. The difference between a major and a minor is the amount of credits you have to take to obtain the degree or the minor. Really, a minor is just wa way to organize all of your free credits after core courses and major req's and electives. <br>  <br>  So if you know you want to pursue a particular field, you're going to want to go some place where you can take lots of classes in it. If a school doesn't offer a major in a field, it usually means their course selection in that area is limited and you might find you're looking to take classes they don't have.  Good luck|`|4jXgOVZoaa	Major- Is pretty self explanatory, think of this as "what you 'majorly' studied."  Your major is your core concentration.  Your program of expertise.<br>  <br>  For example: Major: Psychology, You are primarily focusing the study of the mind and behaviors.  Most psychiatrists, psychologist, and counselors use this major as their basis for their career.  But many people with this major become lawyers, pharmacists, professors, nurses, hr managers, etc.  <br>  <br>  Minor is the sub-major, you took a few classes to open that career option to you...for example, you major in Business Management, but minor in Human Resources Development.  You know how to manage and run a business...but you also know the importance of recruitment, benefit and compensation relations, retaining your employees, and corporate labor laws.  <br>  <br>  If this career that you want focus on while getting your degree is only a minor program at your university.  Talk to your advisor about letting it be your Major.  Some universities are open to letting you design a program.  But of course it comes proving yourself academically.|`|e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	If the college offers only a minor for your field of interest, I would suggest not going to it. <br>  <br>  It is easier to get a job when you have an actual major in it.  A minor usually helps support a major or gives you more experience.

e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	More than likely you lost all of the grants once you were dropped.  I would check on that, because that would mean that your seat was not in fact paid for.<br>  <br>  Your grants and everything are only in effect when you attend the school.  Once you were dropped, you lost them.  That's the way grants work I'm afraid.  So your seat was not being held, because you did not pay for it.  You lost it.<br>  <br>  Also, it is difficult for any school to make special arrangements for one student.  Most of the time, people are restarts because previously they had just stopped coming to class, pretty much just skipping and getting kicked out.  If you did not let your advisor know your situation, then they have no reason to believe otherwise.<br>  <br>  Remember, always get the answers.  If they do not e-mail you back, then walk in and ask for answers.  They could have told you this a while ago.  You are the only one in control of your life, do not blame them for being fair.

Then tell him you're interested and see what he says.  It's only against school policy if he's currently your teacher (unless you're under age, of course) - if you really like him, you don't want to get him fired.|`|AA11604732	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You can't let him know until you ar eno longer a student.|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	You could ask him if he was attending any of the concerts and if so, which ones. If the critique is a written one, ask if he'd be willing to look at the critique before it is actually supposed to be turned in. You don't have to send an email, unless you wanted to...besides, you could always drop by his office and ask him if he is going to any of the concerts & if so, which ones. If you decided to send an email then there is no need to attach your email address. Just be careful that you don't come across as a stalker...that could get you kicked out of the school. Asking him if he's attending any of the concerts is not suggesting that you are interested in him. <br>  <br>  I still think that you should leave him alone in terms of pursuing him romantically, at least until you have graduated.

WXExyAlWaa	No. A semi-colon is used when it can be a comma or a full stop. The second phrase should be capable of standing alone in a sentence. It ought to be<br>  <br>  Aegeus wants children to carry out his legacy, children that cannot be born of him without help from sorcery or power divine.|`|S1IxBEqlaa	No, this is incorrect usage. A semicolon combines two similar sentences. The phrase "Children that can not be born of him without help from sorcery (I believe this is what you meant) or power deving (what is that?)" is not a complete sentence. <br>  <br>  A better option would be this:<br>  <br>  Aegeus wants children--children that can not be born of him without help from sorcery or power deving--to carry out his legacy.<br>  <br>  Of course, what you're essentially saying is that Aegeus requires help from sorcery or power deving to create these children, which doesn't really make sense to me. Perhaps you want to eliminate the "not" in "children that can not."|`|6Nuaqihpaa	You cannot use a semicolon there. The two places you use semicolons are in complicated lists<br>  <br>  ex. Rome, Italy; Paris, France; London, England<br>  <br>  and between two closely related, complete sentences<br>  <br>  ex. I have a dog; his name is Fido.<br>  <br>  Here, "Children that can not be born of him without help from sorcery or power deriving" is not a complete sentence because it does not have a verb.<br>  <br>  Thus, you would use a comma, not a semicolon.|`|M8tlF8Yuaa	No, a semi colon is used to separate two phrases that could stand on their own as complete sentences; your second phrase is not a complete sentence.<br>  <br>  You need either a comma or a dash to separate the two phrases - not a semi colon.<br>  <br>  "Can not" is correctly "cannot."<br>  <br>  "Sourcry," I assume, should be sorcery. I don't know what "deving" is.|`|AgIjuGaxaa	No, that is incorrect.  A semi colon is the same thing as a period, you just don't capitalize the next word.  Your second phrase can't be a sentence all by itself, so you cannot use a semicolon there.  BOth sides of the sentence must stand alone in order to use a semicolon.|`|xNFsj6Wqaa	An easy way to find out if you have used a semicolon properly: if you can take the words after the colon out and use it as a full sentence, then you are using the semicolon properly. <br>  hope this helps. i am good at english, so yeah.<br>  <br>  ?|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	No, it is not used correctly. A semicolon must join two INDEPENDENT clauses. That means either of the clauses COULD stand alone as a sentence. Your second clause is NOT independent.<br>  <br>  Also, "cannot" is one word.

1kOIXVHoaa	Well, you only have to pick half a dozen posts on this board to realise the majority of people who come here still don't really understand what is meant by homeschooling. <br>  <br>  Away from this board I've never met anyone who derides homeschooling or those of us who are home-educated; however when I think about the majority of the 'anti' comments posted here, I am honestly starting to wonder if there are people who see homeschoolers as some sort of modern day fifth column! You know, society uses schools to influence, mold and control its young and, as we're seen to have deliberately chosen to put ourselves beyond ( or should that be 'chosen to reject') their communual influence, molding and control, we're considered to represent some sort of a threat to the status quo, to their status quo.|`|LsAArkUyaa	People fear what they don't understand. We challenge the norm by homeschooling, therefore those who follow the norm blindly believe that there must be something wrong with homeschooling. Otherwise they have to look at the norm and question whether it is really the best for their children.|`|AA12095483	Everyone isn't against home schooling - it's a viable option to regular school. The problem is, many people don't understand what home schooling actually is - there is a common notion that kids stay home and don't really learn much of anything. A supposition that is totally at odds with the fact, because the home schooled kids usually get a better education than the public schooled kids. <br>  Don't let the small stuff grind you down. Just ignore them and feel sorry for their ignorance.

It could be 2 singles that are joined with a conjunction, or two singles that are joined with a clauses or phrases, or more than 2 singles with many punctuation marks, (they are the pits to diagramme!).  So you see, setting them up is a matter of knowing what you want to say, saying it, and then seeing if you can combine several of the single sentences to produce a longer, more intricate, erudite one.<br>  <br>  Do not get too carried away with complex sentences, however.  They can be hard to read and understand.
S1IxBEqlaa	I hear that and think two things: 1. Those two words crammed together look like a typo, and 2. Oh, gag me, punch made from seafood. I picture shrimp, squid, and mussels floating in a bowl filled with bright pink liquid. In short, I think you need to come up with something else. Hope this helps!|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	It's quirky and unforgettable all right, but it does sound unappetizing.  At first glance it made me picture a concoction of crab juice, clam juice, fish blood and other seafood by-products.  I know some people drink some of those things, but they don't exactly fly off the shelves.  On further reflection it reminded me of the "Bass-O-Matic" commercial spoof on Saturday Night Live, and that was funny but in a gross way.  I guess it depends on who your target audience is and what kind of sense of humor they have.
4htyTXJSaa	life go's on, its time for you to move on, i fill ya, i just miss the people in highschool not the work, but college is different, put the old things  behind you and bring forth the new. It'll take some time, u should be thinking about college and your career, but remember all good things must come to a end|`|AA12370001	if you have already graduated you can't enroll.  If you aren't enrolled and are on school grounds you are breaking the law.

eoTRFDlRaa	The ones like Math and Science can be, IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS, but if you do then you'll be fine :D<br>  Lessons like Design And Technology and other lessons you pick can be easy, and fun because you get to design and create ^^<br>  They're nothing to worry about :)|`|frx92Y3kaa	They are ok, chances are if you're doing a GCSE exam in year ten, it'll be for the compulsory subjects, and usually - *usually* - they are split up into modules.<br>  <br>  For example, the science exam board gives you multiple choice papers, which sound easy but they're quite hard. There's a lot of confusing answers, so you have to make sure you understand what you have learnt in lesson.<br>  <br>  In class, people may take the mick out of doing your homework, but in the end it'll pay off. Just make sure you revise well - don't cram it all in the night before. Revise, concentrate in class and always ASK if you don't get something, 'cos you won't get to question the invigilator in the exam.|`|bIMDoZe7aa	There pretty easy i got all A's and A*'s, year 11 is the time when exams get difficult time just flies by so before you know it your in the midst of your GCSEs but just think of all the study leave your gonna get then its not so bad.|`|QO5p0kTXaa	No there all extremely easy especially maths but not as easy as the U.S ones.|`|4pGsRz6iaa	kind of
DjVeebCZaa	At the end of the story Gimpel is not a wise man, but he is smarter than before. Although he still believes a lot of the improbable things other people tell him, he is able to apply common sense to his reasoning. He has developed a better sense for differentiating between the improbable and the probable. At the end of the story Gimpel is not a wise man, or a complete idiot; however, he is smarter and has more common sense.
AA10176626	L:<br>  <br>  Many people receive both SSI and Social Security benefits, but the qualification rules are entirely different.<br>  <br>  SSI is a program available to any disabled person who has limited income and limited resources (subject to a number of qualifying criteria)<br>  <br>  SSD is a program that is only available to individuals who have a permanent disability that will significantly limit their ability to do "basic" work activities for at least one year. Basic means things like sitting, walking and remembering.. Unlike the SSI program, which is not actually a form of Social Security (despite the fact that it is administered by the Social Security Department) , an applicant can not be eligible for the SSD program unless they have earned enough "social security credits" to qualify. SSD is an insurance program, and you must have "purchased the insurance" by paying social security taxes over a certain period of employment.<br>  <br>  Think about it this way - SSD is a Social Security benefit program that allows you to start taking advantage of the social security insurance that you "purchased" before you reach the usual retirement age.<br>  <br>  SSI is a government benefit program paid to individuals who have a disability, low income and little assets.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, however, that receipt of SSD benefits will impact your ability to qualify for SSI benefits. SSI eligibility is based on an income test - and your SSD benefits qualify as  income.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped you.|`|cz5XbKfOaa	No. SSI is for people who do not have enough work quarters to qualify for SSDI and have limited income. SSDI is for people who have at least 40 work quarters.

Subtract and you get the supplies expense. <br>  Debit the expense, and credit the supplies used.

AA10176626	Seek:<br>  <br>  Stafford loan funds are disbursed directly to the bursar's office at your school, where they will be used to pay down any balance in your student account. You will not (and can not) receive a check from the lender that you can use for your own expenses. The only way that you will ever receive these funds is in the form of an "overage check" from your school.<br>  <br>  Though anyone can qualify for a Stafford loan, you will only be approved for a loan if your school certifies to the lender that you have remaining "financial aid need". Your maximum borrowing eligibility is your remaining financial aid need - you can not just 'ask' for a certain amount of money.<br>  <br>  Sending the funds directly to your school and requiring the school to certify need are meant to do exactly what it seems that they're doing  - to limit a borrower's ability to use the money specifically for educational expenses, and not for any other form of living expenses.<br>  <br>  And no, unfortunately, your aid eligibility is only for the current semester - you will not be "certified" for retroactive aid.<br>  <br>  I hope that information helped you. Good luck.
