20061226084750AAyEIsI	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	My Canon digital camera broke itself on Christmas!?	I have one of the digital powershot "elph" models... it is 2.5 years old but has never had any trouble until yesterday. I went to turn it on and it would not function. It made a sound like the lens may have been jammed (it would not expand out from the camera), but then when I turned the dial to "play" mode (used to review pictures), it would not perform that function either. The power is working, because the power light comes on. And it makes a mechanical sound as if the lens is jammed, but like I said, I don't think that is the problem, since the camera normally plays pictures without expanding the lens. Does anyone know what I can do? I love my camera and use it all the time! Not sure I can afford a new one right now. Thanks!

In definitiva devo trovare un alimentatore che mi dia esattamente quella corrente (100mA) oppure una corrente comunque superiore o inferiore a quel valore? Grazie a chiunque mi aiuti!!!

Salve mi chiamo claudio sono diplomato in elettronica e telecomunicazioni e ho bisogno del vostro aiuto per un piccolo progetto di elettronica che vorrei sviluppare.      PROBLEMA :      ho una telecamera wireless e un videoregistratore a cassette. Vorrei realizzare un piccolo sistema, molto semplice e banale per :      1 – far partire la registrazione quando nel locale ove installata la telecamera e il videoregistratore vi è un intruso. ( magari quando viene aperta la porta del locale senza che vi sia qualcuno al suo interno )   2 – far registrare il tutto fino alla chiusura della porta del locale o per un minimo di 20 secondi e un massimo di un minuto ( tempi ovviamente variabili )   3 – se possibile spegnere il videoregistratore quando “l’intruso” abbandona il locale o chiude la porta.      Vi prego di aiutarmi perche è da piu di un mese che sto diventando matto per realizzare tale progettino.      Cordiali saluti claudio

I currently have a family plan with 750 minutes total (we don't use it all that much) for 2 phones.  We are both using the LG VX8300.  We don't go over our minutes and pay about $68 US per month.      We will be eligible for our new phone shortly and I was wondering what would be a good "step up" from what we have?      The 8300 was a good phone, sometimes the battery drained too quickly.  We don't use it for web at all.      Do you have any suggestions on what phone would be a good choice as an upgrade from the 8300?      Thank You.
