9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>If there is a fair and correct definition for "Terrorist" <br>  to define who is terrorist, the answer will be very easy.<br>  <br>  >>>A Freedom Fighter is not a terrorist.<br>  >>>Any person calls freedom fighters "terrorists" is himself a real terrorist.<br>  <br>  >>> SO . The First step to start should be " A fair definition of terrorism" :<br>  Who is a terrorist : <br>  <br>  A freedom fighters such as Hamas fighters in Palestine,<br>  or<br>  Coward land occupiers , such Israeli solders occupying Palestine since 1948. Since that time they are killing children, women and old people using phosphorous and chemical weapons, and forced the natives to leave their homes and live a refugees in other countries since 1948 until now.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Latest Israeli war on Gaza starts on 27 Dec. 2008, killing children, women and old people using phosphorous and chemical weapons.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	terrorism results from people feeling helpless, so they resort to the most extreme measure..Terrorism is most likely related to religion because religious people are predisposed to this sort of flock mentality, as no questions, martyr yourself|`|vY0ScgeXaa	At present time, terriorists are mostly from the middle east, and their mostly muslims.<br>  <br>  so you can say at present time 90% of terrorists are muslims. and thus ofcoz terrroism is related to religion.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	As catnip says, you could relate terrorism to religion.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, you could argue that modern mainstream religions all, generally speaking, preach peace, tolerance, non-violence and individual self-improvement.  From that point of view, the extremists who practice, sponsor or encourage terrorism could be said not to be a true or representative part of their religion, but to be acting on their own interests using religion as a convenient excuse and means of recruitment.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps have a look at other examples than Islam, like the Troubles in Northern Ireland, too.|`|7mRwtSTPaa	terrorism has no religion <br>  it is the act of spreading terror between people. <br>  The muslims are not terrorist, as the religion did not promot terrorising, but forbids it. <br>  why do you think there are christians and jews who spread terror. <br>  u could call any country who declare wars are terrorist ( I mean the government of course)|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Terrorism can be employed as a means of taking over land or other scarce resources. Surely the drugs wars in certain South American countries are really a form of terrorism.|`|CqjyDIPKaa	no because terrorists aren't all from the middle east and they aren't all muslim. actually most terrorists are white middle class males who live right here in america. your generalizing too much. when people think terrorists most automaticaly  think muslim because of 911, but its not the case.

PkC1Sk8Qaa	That sentence is far too lenient. He didn't just kill a living thing, but did it in a terrible way that shows murderous thought.<br>  <br>  We shouldn't live in a society were we judge humans as being worth more then animals. We are all living things which sense and feel things such as pain and fear and deserve to be treated as such. Instead of human rights, how about we call it living rights or something. <br>  <br>  Animals need our protection from nasty people like this man. Animals don't have the law protecting them, they cannot go to the police or hire an attorney to fight for their rights in court. They are virtually powerless in a society which deems because they aren't as intelligent as us that they are worthless inferior and our play things. Perhaps because they cannot defend themselves is why they deserve our protection more.<br>  <br>  This man should be jailed for a very very long time, I would never let him out if it was my call. Sick sick man.|`|1T35X8dEaa	Wow. That is a lame sentence.<br>  <br>  This guy should be stuffed into a microwave and see how if feels.<br>  <br>  I think he should be sent to jail for this.<br>  <br>  I watch the ASPCA shows on animal planet, and the people who are cruel to animal get like a couple of years in jail, huge fines and a ban from ever owning pets again.<br>  <br>  <br>  His punishment was not right, I doubt he would want to be stuffed into a microwave and have it turned on. Someone will find him and try to do the same thing to him.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it sounds harsh, but I think that it is wrong to harm any animal. But yet if the person choses to Be the Monster that harms an animal "Eye for an Eye, tooth for a tooth"|`|UbR8EfMxaa	no we need to turn him loose on the taliban|`|3QtO3SpFaa	You know, I read somewhere that a majority of the most infamous serial killers in history started out by torturing and killing animals.

Everybody in the UK leaves the engine of the car running 24 hours a day.  Don't thank me.   Its very hard to be humble with a mind like mine.    Another solution would be to train cows to phart in unison. The cows could be placed on a railway line that went around the coast of the UK.  Every 100 yards a whistle would sound and all the cows would let out a mighty phart.  Of course we would soon run out of milk but we are British and no sacrifice is too great when a crisis looms.    The train would not enter Wales or Scotland.   They can solve their own problems.|`|ST2Gg9Ovaa	i say old bean...rather..."Biffy","Ginger" and i are up for a bit of a ding dong with Mr Snowflake and all that, i have my man Bagthorpe(87) packing the belfry with the old 50 cal as we speak, lets show them we are British what, dash the invaders, we will show them with our stiff upper lip and sturdy stride....oh one must go Bagthorpe has fell from the roof again...ruddy old duffers no good at heights, tally ho.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	I told you global warming was the next big myth devised by government to keep us in line after we all discovered religion was a con trick.

That's the ONLY reason Italy would win.  Americans showed the world when it attacked Iraqi (at the time was the 4th largest military in the world in terms of numbers) that number's really don't matter if you don't have technology/weaponry to go along with it.  Perfect example would be American helicopter's spot an enemy from 15miles away and then shot their missile killing the target from 15 miles away, the North Koreans wouldn't be able to handle that type of tech.  <br>  <br>  Don't forget also that the VAST majority of citizen's in North Korea eat less in one month then we eat in 3 days....so North Korea has no loyalty, so probably 60% of N.Korean army would surrender almost immediately.|`|IltJCXjcaa	THE actual answer is Italy. Albeit that North Korea have a bigger arsenal than that of Italy, Italy would be able to get assistance from America, Japan, Germany, Australia, Canada, and other Nato countries. So in fact, North Korea would be defeated.

Some people accuse him of autocracy, verging on dictatorship. Others welcome his social reforms. My own feeling is that he's done a little good and a lot of bad. It's quite true that the ruling elite in many South American countries have subjugated the poor in a way that would be quite unacceptable in Europe. However, Lula in Brazil has shown how a left-wing leader can pass meaningful reforms without antagonizing the establishment. In contrast, Chavez has gone out of his way to antagonize the establishment.<br>  <br>  The main problems with Chavez is that he's acted to eliminate media opposition in a way reminiscent of one-party states. While he has done a lot to help the poor, his social welfare programmes are not being enacted with sustainable funding. He is using the country's oil revenues to pay for it now, without any regard to what will happen when the oil runs out. He has also allowed public spending to grow out of control, causing significant inflation and fiscal instability. In contrast, Lula has been a lot less ambitious in his reforms but has based the reforms he has carried out on a sustainable footing.<br>  <br>  I think the best summary of Hugo Chavez's policies is that he's bribed Venezuela with its children's money. His rhetoric is unattractive to me, being strongly based on a socialist, class war tradition. But it's his actions that really show: a reduction in the ability of the opposition to express its views freely and the profligate use of money that should be invested to secure the country's future.<br>  <br>  If I were Venezuelan, I would vote for the opposition.|`|3QtO3SpFaa	My best friend is Venezuelan. I have come to realize that I can't tell her anything new that Chavez has done because I get things thrown at me. She really hates Chavez.<br>  To answer your question, Venezuela is supposed to be a democracy. In fact, their constitution is based on the US constitution. However, Chavez has done everything he can to override everything in their constitution in order to make the country socialist. In fact, earlier this week, Chavez won a decision put up for vote to declare an end to the presidential term limit. In other words, instead of a president only being allowed 2 terms of office, he had that eliminated so that he can move one step closer to a dictatorship. At this point right now, he still needs to be re-elected every 2 years. But I'm sure that will change and my friend Zyahr will throw everything at me when I tell her the bad news.
9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact peace is so far ; --- After and before israeli elections ---<br>  Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace is so far.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Your statements are all false.

5677d737254b1ba0e2d4414411541abeaa	If Muslim terrorism didn't exist, you'd be posing a moot question.    The "media" of late are notorious for exploiting sensationalist copy and photos, and islamo based terrorism offers a multitude of grist for this profit oriented mill.    Imo, Islam is promulgating its own reputation with and without the machinations of the news industry, and one of despicable repute.    Have you ever looked at what Muslim based media are doing to inflame terrorism?    It seems you are a pro-jihadi and anti-Western propagandist?|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Not even close.

Also, Islam  religion  leaders  who  support  terrorist  or  leaders  who  don't  propagandize  ideas  of  peace.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	The "War On Terror" is a poorly perpetrated FRAUD.    http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/20...|`|fO8sn3m4aa	For sure. The "war on terror" is fake, it was created as an excuse for war (and the subsequent massive military budgets), regaining control of the lost Afghan heroin, elliminating Isreal's enemies in the Middle East, installing the security apparatus, passing new fascist laws etc etc etc.  It has been planned for decades to the replace the cold war (which was also a fake war setup by the CIA literally to increase their budget), they did this by faking intelligence that the soviets were going to invade West Berlin.    They still don't know who was responsible for 9/11 or how it was carried out, for those they do, you've been watching too much Fox news. Most likely it was a US intelligence operation or rogue military operation.  Osama bin Laden (who was a CIA asset) had zero to do with it. The FBI admit there is no evidence to support the claims he was behind it, or even who were the terrorists on the planes (if there even were any as you don't need to be in the cockpit to hijack a boeing many are remotely controllable) . Al Qaeda (known as Al CIAda in intelligence circles was created and funded by the CIA, its an arabic phrase meaning "the Base" which was a database of CIA assets. They may claim they went "Rogue" but more likely they are performing as planned. Isreal carries out numerous "false-flag" attacks under that name. Britain are old hands at this tactic and britains MI6 was responsible for many bombings blamed on the IRA.    The western media is controlled by the CIA (literally having talking heads on their payroll and staff editors and fact-checkers) and Isreal so what you see and hear is primarily what they want you to see and hear.    For those who think that's far fetched you should look up "operation Gladio" on google, which was a series of bloody false-flag terrorist attacks decades ago funded by western governments in order to blame the communists.    The weapons industry is making a killing.

8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	I did not see the piece but i have seen and heard many with the same rhetoric. The point is that people like him hold the position they have today thanks to talks like that. They are highly considered not because of their knowledge but because of their big mouth and status that gives them the ability to speak freely and arrogantly about such subjects. I will never feel guilty for slavery why you ask? because i have no American ancestors for one and also because as I have been told MANY times by the same elite people and professors in my life if you really want change then YOU have to fight for it and make it happen, No matter how hard your situation ultimately only YOU can fee yourself and improve your life.<br>  Where is that state of mind when it comes to slavery? oh no they had to wait for half the white man to free them. How about that "good" half? is it being rewarded today for helping free the slaves? I'd like to take that professor to the cemetery where thousands from that war are buried. Men who lost their lives to free the slaves and ask him to have that same speech on their stones.<br>  They are hypocrites, they blame because the only argument for their failure is excuses and more excuses.<br>  As for the drawing itself what a bunch of hypocrites. They had no problem for 8 years making fun of GW Bush being portrayed as a chimp and worst but God forbid you ever touch Obama huh? some fairness there. <br>  Finally I will say this. Blacks have been fighting for equality and they have mentioned many times that to change racism colors should be gone and we should all just be Americans yet they insist on being called African American and Obama for them is not JUST the new president he is the new and first BLACK president.

With the ASEAN meeting happening in Hua Hin next week, it would be a safer time than normal to have a big demonstration because with so much foreign press in Thailand the government won't want the army to start shooting protesters because it would look bad. I don't think its going to be a showdown like a battle or anything but the demo. on 24th Feb. could be quite significant for pressuring the government to call elections/revise the constitution back to the more democratic 1997 constitution.

I certainly don't want to quit, as I need the health insurance. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I keep the thermostat off entirely - we use a space heater that we move from room to room (we've covered the walls in blankets on colder days, to help keep the heat in) because it uses less electricity.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we get free wood from my parents, and then we have a fire in the fireplace. <br>  <br>  We've even gotten to the point where we shower together or share bathwater because of the energy it takes to heat the water to a tolerable temperature.<br>  <br>  And we live just outside DC - I can't imagine what people in this situatution are doing in places like Maine or Minnesota or North Dakota.<br>  <br>  Hang in there - it's gotta get better some time.<br>  <br>  Have you thought about getting a roommate?|`|rES1XnMmaa	you don't have any friends? to talk too?... sometimes friends are over rated..sounds like you are going through a really tough time...did you lose your girlfriend or family and or friends?... a lot of small towns look like ghost towns... things will get better you can e-mail me if you want...|`|e4SflIigaa	It can always be worse.. you could have 1 arm or 1 leg or be blind or have cancer.. but you are healthy so suck it up and get a job, save and be grateful|`|DV4xyeChaa	Let them eat cake.....|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	I'm so scared me and my husband won't be able to pay the rent and since we don't own a home we will be homeless because it takes $1,500.00 in texas approximatley for another place to rent,i've turned off my heat too,my last gas bill was $226.00,i've been cold in this house for months,and i will be burning up come summer,we can barely afoord to eat,buying ramen noodles again like i did when i was on my own right out of high school,hell i think i was doing better then and we make better money now.|`|mldo1vxYaa	You are not alone, a lot of people feel like that at the moment, and just as you think you are ok something happens to tell you otherwise. Unfortunately all we can do is weather the storm and manage as best we can. We have cut down on going out,and unnecessary expenses and it has helped, we have other ways of having fun that doesnt cost as much.<br>  <br>  Please dont think of not wanting to live, at the end of the day its only money, i know thats easy to say but there are more important things like your family and friends.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	The elites that caused this mess wouldn't care if you did. In fact that might be what they want if they think about it all which they don't. They don't care about us. They care about themselves and stocking their oversized egos. They are playing politics with Obama and the Democrats. I would contact CNN and MSNBC and other news outlets. Tell them your story. Cut back on what you can. To fill in free time, you can always read books from the library to gain new knowledge that might help down the road. <br>  <br>  Many of us are in a difficult position. My job seems safe but I don't know. The same goes for my husband. I'm not taking anything for granted. I have step kids and by all accounts - their mom and step dad are idiots. They are spending like they always have. Their step dad lost his job. Talk about pressure. My husband and I are trying to save and cut back just because we don't know. But the kids don't get it. They see their mom and she's making it tough on us with the potential more driving my husband will have to do for these new activities. She's a quitter so it may not last - probably won't. She's weak. It's stress. <br>  <br>  The unknown stresses me out. People putting other people down does not help. It's not fair. Do we have complete control? NO!!!!!<br>  <br>  Most people have not received any kind of financial education. To try to educate them when they are adults is just about too late. They don't get it. They are too used to their bad habits. They are overly optimistic. <br>  <br>  Push for financial education to ALL kids starting as early as possible - keep it ongoing.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I completely agree with you.  My husband and I are struggling too up here in Michigan - and we both work full time jobs.  There are 2 of us and we still don't have enough money - I hate living paycheck to paycheck.  And furthermore, I really don't want to get a second job or for him too.  40 hrs a week is ENOUGH - I can barely stand doing that, let alone taking on anything more.<br>  <br>  We just have to hope things get better.  Don't give up - hang in there.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	At least you still have a job|`|uJhrqJCDaa	I read these yesterday. I think it describes the worst case scenario but Unfortunately I think we are in the worst case scenario.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/23259" rel="nofollow">http://www.energybulletin.net/node/23259</a><br>  <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/47157" rel="nofollow">http://www.energybulletin.net/node/47157</a>|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	Pres Obama is saving "the less fortunate"!

Dont worry about them!!|`|8dREUd2xaa	You should buy less and they will have to lower the price. <br>  <br>  What should I do about flabby arms?|`|AA10283080	It is a miserable time for all of us right now but instead of getting depressed about it you have to remember that there are a lot of people around the world who don't even have clean running water or a car to put gas in. You may have it tougher than you have in the past but you don't have it as tough as some people do or as tough as some people did years ago.<br>  <br>  Uh...killing oneself is never the answer. Living in a country that has a bad economy is not a good reason to kill yourself.
5107c3cf09f31a605b6d95cbf016f1dbaa	Couldn't agree with you more.  I said exactly the same.  At least she has money to leave her kids - other's have nothing but benefits.|`|q4tTabfjaa	When you don't do something, someone will complain.  <br>  When you do something, someone will complain.  <br>  When you ask someone else to do something, someone will complain.  <br>  When you forget to ask someone else to do something, someone will complain.  <br>  The only person you have to really live with is yourself, now I suggest you live with yourself and let others do the same.|`|cwJrCcguaa	Also Jack Straw, it takes the heat of their backs about the economy.|`|8xB1Kfc9aa	That man always has his hand out to catch a lift on a passing bandwagon<br>  Cheap little excuse for a man that he is|`|cUamLDj3aa	you wouldnt wish that on anyone but it was funny when he called her jane ha ha and shes getting elton johns house for the wedding,|`|rpK7ZUKBaa	Plus the stupid man even got her name wrong!<br>  Duh Gordan|`|sbnUAllfaa	. <br>  Mark 1 is right in his summing up of the nation in distress, and of the<br>  PM's comments. I rather think the nation focuses on one Individuel,<br>  (Jade) because they feel they know her as an entertainer. This they want to relate and pour sympathy upon, regardless of the faceless<br>  masses who have the sick, the lame and the halt to look after. Grief is<br>  is so sad.<br>  <br>  Truly Yours,<br>  <br>  Pee - Wee|`|W8aiAWe2aa	I see your point.<br>  It would have been better for him to have said nothing. Or to extend his sympathy to all terminally ill people.|`|822a369b8f320e09663fcafb542917aeaa	Of course it's getting out of hand.  I posted a question yesterday asking why our Prime Minister is concerning himself with this.<br>  <br>  We can all feel sympathetic towards her situation, and he is human, but he is also running a country that at the moment seems to be coming apart at the seems and the health of one citizen shouldn't be at the forefront of his mind.<br>  <br>  But as I was told yesterday, quite correctly, that he is in a no win situation.  He would be damned whatever he did and he does have to think of votes.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	I think it's worse that people on here are continually having a go at someone who is dying. Any one of us could befall this fate at any time, people should reflect on that.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It does seem to be getting a little out of hand now but it won't be for much longer.  Try to have compassion for her.|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	That's the sad "reality" of life I'm afraid
gYgXn2weaa	Netanyahu, I spit.  WW III is getting rapidly closer. By the recent events there is no democracy whatsoever in israel, read the link below. Hitler was not in this mans league, Hitler was a psycho but Netanyahu is a cold blooded, evil and totally in control megalomaniac who has made it clear that he is going to finish the Palestinians off.|`|hYOEQdgnaa	Hitler doesn't bang anything anymore, so that leaves Netanyahu, someone who celebrated the 60 year anniversary of the King David Hotel terrorist attack with his friends|`|8mQILFtVaa	Netanyahu is a Jewish extremist radical!

DUH!|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	Chavez.|`|74RNHyxHaa	At least Hitler was open about what he was doing, Netanyahu thinks he can fool the world with more Israeli lies about peace and justice.

VZVLn7qbaa	I'm with you, I've had enough of her already.  Blatant publicity hound, if you ask me.|`|J7RuBjPTaa	I agree with you.  As someone said in a previous question, she's got a salon, several properties and about ￡8million on the bank, so it's not like she's short of cash.<br>  <br>  She spend her remaining last weeks in private with her kids.  She's not the only person with a terminal illness, though you wouldn't believe it with all the publicity.|`|AA11015890	Why are you asking this?  It must be the trillienth time this type of damn question has been asked.  GET OVER IT!!!!!!|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	As long as the media is making her a star in the same way they are running after the OCTO MOM.<br>  If the media want to pay her for the interviews and photos. Who cares? I am not spending money buying magazines that show them.|`|AoJKQRNXaa	she is securing her children's Financial future , like any real mother would do if they were in her position|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	I couldn't care less she's a loud mouth egomanic|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	no its her life and she can do what she wants|`|ai4lrclMaa	She is leaving her children alone. She knows what it is to have no means of support and she is desperately trying to provide for them in the only way open to her.<br>  <br>  What is appalling is that the media company that made so much money from the franchise which brought that girl to prominence did not simply give her the money and let her be alone with her kids.<br>  <br>  That we the public will pay to gawk at a young woman losing everything and everyone she loves....that we will discuss the relative merits of her personal morality while she faces this...is an indictment of us...not of her.<br>  <br>  What would I do to secure my children's future in similar circumstances?<br>  <br>  Whatever it took.<br>  Just like Jade.|`|cwJrCcguaa	She is reading from Max Clifford`s song sheet, he tells her what to say and how to act and the `less than brilliant` girl just follows along.<br>  <br>  He will be making more money than she ever will out of it.<br>  <br>  Money for the children is pushed to make the country go `aawww` and want to read all about her.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No I don't agree.  She can't and won't get better whatever she does.  <br>  She is trying to leave her tiny children with enough money to ensure their future and to show them how much she loved them.  I believe her to be talentless but so are many so-called celebrities but she has my respect as a mother.|`|jWTZfP4naa	i'm annoyed with the Jade Goody machine. she's not a person, she's a business. She is a network of publicists and creatives.<br>  <br>  i'm annoyed with journalists, mostly, those that are reporting this travesty ought not to be able to call themselves by that name.|`|DphUE9tbaa	Not actually with her.  She is a stupid woman and knows no better.  She is dying and suffering, but we cannot expect her to behave with dignity because she has none.  What annoys me is the whole bloody circus around her - vampires like Max Clifford, etc.  NOBODY should be interested in this and NOBODY should be making money out of it.  It is sordid.  It is the Jeremy Kyle show of death|`|AA12050428	This business about securing a good future for 'her boys' is pathetic. How much do they need?  Many of my friends and self included,while  recovering from Cancer raised money for the Hospital where we were treated.<br>  Wouldn't we all feel differently if she was doing that?|`|Fo1Gm4Xnaa	I fully agree with you, and there are many women out there who do not have the luxury of millions in the bank so thee family is looked after.|`|21bf104810db24cdcc8e23a34e620563aa	How can you be annoyed at a young mother who is dying of a terrible, terrible illness.|`|T4AMBr5uaa	She is simply trying to leave some financial security for her children, wouldn't you do the same? I am shocked by the lack of compassion displayed by some people posting on here, would any of you trade places with Goody? I think not. Besides the high profile may make others aware of the dangers posed by this type of cancer, it may do someone some good, if not Jade Goody herself. Reading some things on Yahoo about Jade, i am ashamed to be English right now.<br>  God Bless her at this awful time.<br>  (and no i am not some kind of religious nut, i simply have some sense of common decency)|`|DIihJrUiaa	Yes, I agree. I am not so much annoyed with her, she's always been a media whore, but am annoyed at serious news sources like the BBC constantly reporting on every detail of her life and illness. Also think it's ridiculous that the terms of her bloke's curfew have been alterered for their wedding, this wouldn't happen for anyone else who wasn't in the media spotlight!|`|AA10063059	she isn't just ill she is dying and her campaign to promote the dangers of cervical cancer is fantastic,if she just went home and shut herself away,as you would like it ,she would be dead by tomorrow,this extra adrenaline is keeping her going this extra mile,her boys will look back at this and be proud of her,she is also helping other people with their fight with cancer,<br>  and to all those heartless answers that agree with you remember what goes round comes round,|`|4BdFfeLpaa	Sorry, but there is no "trying to get better" from cancer. Jade is terminally ill and dying. I think what she is doing is actually really brave and because of her "publicity" she has actually boosted the number of women going for smear tests, which can only be a good thing.<br>  I myself have lost a close family member to cancer and it is the worst thing in the world. Her decision to remain in the public eye is to earn money and secure a future for her two boys in the way she knows how..what she is doing is completely selfless and I'm sorry but if you're fed up with seeing her story in the papers then don't read them!|`|wtvzW516aa	I totally agree with you! Like you said, I would not wish what she is going through on anyone. However, I can't help but despise  the woman! Her past behaviour does not leave anything to be desired at all. Like you said, any 'normal' person would be spending their valuable time with the ones that matter, rather than cashing in on it.! I just turn the tv over whenever  she's on.|`|HIav9sVuaa	thats horrible first of all doing all these interviews and shoots is helping her make money to give her children the best in life for when she gos i think any parent would do what they could and by being in the papers even shes raisisng awareness of it.<br>  you say shes cashing in on it but she wants money for her two young sons can you imagine not being able to see them again you would want the best and that means the best if that was my mum i would be really proud of her|`|8xB1Kfc9aa	Can't get annoyed with the girl - I don't know her: but I do get p*ssed off having the her private, intimate problems thrown at me from every gutter rag and downmarket tomnoddy in the media|`|jK3NouAQaa	She's not really dying you mugs! This it's all a publicity stunt.<br>  <br>  Anyone can put on one of them 'baldy swimming caps' and look miserable every time there's a camera about.

9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact peace is so far; Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace is so far.|`|bGuVAltxaa	To be honest there wasn't much of a chance of peace anyway but there is even less of a chance now, in fact all I can see now is more conflict between the two sides now that Netanyahu will be president, for me this man is dangerous and to think now he has nuclear weapons at his finger tips is frightening, to think this man has the support of the Israeli people says everything, the two sides as a far apart as ever.|`|AA10565392	Magnificently said!

You always want to look professional, but if you're going to be interacting with kids at the ballpark on a hot summer day, that certainly doesn't call for a suit and tie. Think "modesty" and "professionalism" but don't be rigid about it. And don't be afraid to ask.

If it was aimed at a Christian or a White Conservative nothing would have been said. I feel very insulted as a white American, I think there should be laws for us to. If you look at history white woman were enslaved as well as children of all races but honestly that was a long time ago and should not affect people now who had nothing to do with it!!
dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Ehud Olmert is the Prime Minister of Israel.  He is currently in the process of turning the reigns of power over to Benjamin Netanyahu.  Olmert's popularity as waxed and waned over the course of his tenure in Israel mostly in relation to the conflicts with Hezbollah and Hamas.  In June 2006 Israel invaded Lebanon to counter Hezbollah; in January 2009, Israel invaded Gaza - both invasions did not produce the intended outcomes and there was a backlash of anti-Israel sentiment as aggressors in the global community.<br>  Do a search on Olmert - there is a lot about him.|`|6fveYQa5aa	Start with Nazi war crimes and then make your comparisons.

Condi and her aides had no clue either, so they sent it to the FBI.<br>  <br>  No one could solve it at the FBI so it went to the CIA, then to the NSA.<br>  <br>  With no clue as to its meaning they eventually asked Britain's MI-6 for help.

9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	FOX news itself is probably the least biased of the news shows.  FOX has a variety of commentary programs which do tend to be conservative.  However, it should be noted that FOX is the only network that does lean conservative.  All other networks tend to be liberal and give a liberal slant to their news shows and if they have commentary it always is liberal.  I would rather have my news straight without bias and have commentary clearly labeled as such.  It gets my goat when I watch a "news" cast that only gives the liberal side and never the conservative side or worse yet classifies conservatives as unpatriotic or stupid.|`|062a4b193e67d89823d7d580a2b39b33aa	Yes, Fox news has always been caught in some kind of turmoil because of the views most of their news casters have, and they just don't care about hiding their opinions to make the news fair.  So yes, they are very biased.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I started watching Fox News years ago because I thought it seemed a bit more realistic since it wasn't all doom and gloom. It seemed more upbeat. Of course the doom and gloom was warranted because look at the mess we are in. It's still very early from reports. Time will tell. Prepare or ignore it. It's on at the gym I go to. I can't stand it. It seems very negative and hateful. Why are all of the women so attractive? What do they have against normal looking women? They don't make good reporters? Is that the only way they can get their audience to pay attention to them? The men are nothing to look at. It's not like the attractive people's channel. They did a special on Britney Spears and that might be when I stopped watching them. <br>  <br>  The other stations are not much better but I can tolerate them more. <br>  <br>  www.truthout.org<br>  www.alternet.org<br>  www.salon.com<br>  Juan Cole - expert on the Middle East<br>  Noam Chomsky - linguistics and knowledgeable about foreign policy<br>  <br>  It's best to read and watch a variety of news. Question everything. Try to see things from different perspectives. Seek the truth. The truth is blind. It has no ideology.|`|kH0AsPfgaa	Yes, perhaps Fox leans slightly right of center.  But not as much as all the other channels lean left.  So in reality, you will get less biased news on Fox than the other channels.

I realize that Jesus is the only Way, the Truth, and the Life; and is the only Mediator between You and man.<br>  <br>  I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner. I believe that Your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross, died for my sins, and rose again on the third day. I am truly sorry for the deeds which I have committed against You, and therefore, I am willing to repent (turn away from my sins). Have mercy on me, a sinner. Cleanse me, and forgive me of my sins as I forgive anyone who has ever sinned against me.<br>  <br>  I truly desire to serve You, Lord Jesus. Starting from now, I pray that You would help me to hear Your still small voice. Lord, I desire to be led by Your Holy Spirit so I can faithfully follow You and obey all of Your commandments. I ask You for the strength to love You more than anything else so I won't fall back into my old ways. I also ask You to bring genuine believers into my life who will encourage me to live for You and help me stay accountable.<br>  <br>  Jesus, I am truly grateful for Your grace, which has led me to repentance and has saved me from my sins. By the indwelling of Your Holy Spirit, I now have the power to overcome all sin which before so easily entangled me. Lord Jesus, please transform my life so that I may bring glory and honor to You alone and not to myself.<br>  <br>  Right now, I confess Jesus as the Lord of my life. With my heart, I believe that God the Father raised His Son Jesus from the dead. This very moment I acknowledge that Jesus Christ is my Savior and according to His Word, right now I am born again. Thank You, Jesus, for coming into my life and hearing my prayer. I ask all of this in the name of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen."<br>  <br>  Remember what I said.

In Texas anyway, we are required to inspect our vehicles annually and the mileage is recorded on the back of the sticker. These records are kept and copies are on file. Wouldn't that be the easiest and most efficient way to do it? No this is about surveillance...that or somebody owns stock in a GPS company.
L8zmQS8Jaa	I find this line of questioning and the rhetoric it depends upon very very sad. <br>  <br>  I would expect that a "Soldier of Christ" might search for either truth or compassion.  Instead the rhetoric is dependent upon "FEAR" and "INSULT."  I don't recall any parable teaching a campain of either "FEAR" or the requirement of such a superior attitude that there should be any "INSULT."  But I do recall something of Humility.  I might expect to be offered  change next.  It would be more in character.  We have seen entirely too much of this kind of rhetoric. <br>  <br>  Regardless of the merits of your arguments, to tell me that I must be afraid or that I should be insulted are both techniques of social control and domination.  I have to react with the greatest suspicion. <br>  <br>  When it is clear that instead of offering any independent thought you are simply quoting another source, I am again saddened.  A Christian fundamentalist at least quotes the Bible. You are quoting Bill O'Reilly. Does he believe himself to be a god? Perhaps you believe that he is. <br>  <br>  What makes me AFRAID is that the capacity to discern the truth seems to be ever reduced in favor of following a few talking heads.  Our job is made increasingly difficult as our media is warped into points of view dependent upon the news editors and commentators. I am INSULTED when someone believes that I will accept an emotional perspective simply repeated over and over again.  And I am saddened that so many people don't "see planks in our own eyes." But you probably expect me to respond by "turning the other cheek."|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Definitely....You answered my question so you know how I feel about the situation.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	There is no doubt in my mind that Obama will lead us right into the face danger the likes we have never seen before.<br>  <br>  My question is, Lord how much longer will You tarry?|`|HVY2rqzfaa	meh, not nearly as afraid as I was of the gross incompetence of your old leadership|`|wMFfGkIRaa	YES!<br>  <br>  Welcome to Socialism..<br>  <br>  THE USA that we were born into and knew is now GONE!|`|2zY0j133aa	no not at all! <br>  it is nothing but a political game that the president Bush was playing!|`|6fveYQa5aa	1 FOX is not a news source..it is Jewish billionaire's play toy to keep eyes focused away from Jewish crimes around the world.<br>  #2  President Obama is not in charge , The private Zionist Federal Reserve and it's Corporations are in charge and will soon form a new system of government.<br>  #3 By any psychiatric definition many of your heroes are sociopaths and you're the best audience perfect for their needs.

The switch from Republicans to Democrats in the White House probably only made these foreign moves even easier to pull off.<br>  But who cares who is in power in the White House?  What exactly do you want the President to do?  Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran and South Korea are sovereign nations.  The U.S. President - Democrat or Republican - has no right to tell them what they can or can't do -  no more than they have to tell the U.S. what it can and can't do.  Are you suggesting that Obama should threaten to attack them if they don't do what he wants?  Isn't that only going to push them even closer to Russia and the Taliban?  Doesn't that just make the U.S. look like an imperialist aggressor?<br>  Obama and the rest of the world's leaders have more than just foreign affairs to worry about right now.  The collapsing economy needs to be fixed ASAP.  Ironically, the U.S. would have more money to spend on foreign operations if Bush hadn't wasted so much attacking Iraq.  It's long been know that Pakistan is soft on the Taliban, so wouldn't it have made more sense to spend the resources there than in a country that had no ties to 9-11 terrorism?<br>  Joe Biden's comment was quite prophetic, but it is not exclusive to Barrack Obama.  Any incoming President would have faced the same challenges.  The world is really messed up right now, so there are going to be some changes.  Unfortunately, some of these changes are going to be bad.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	President Obama is not endangering the USA.  George W.

TPN1yIj7aa	there were warning signs. i presume at 14yrs old she can read. her mother works in health and safety and the girl wants to be a barrister. (I'm sure she'll make a good one).  I saw her on the tv yesterday and my immediate thought was "well she sounds bright enough" but she chose to ignore the signs and no amount of legislation can cover stupidity. You can argue and say that at 14 you're allowed to be stupid but she'd asked her mum for a spray tan and was refused and they may well have had a conversation about tanning anyway. <br>  <br>  Tanning salons shouldn't be banned, people have a right to toast themselves to bright orange if they choose but at the same time, pubs and off licenses ask for proof of age so for something like this i feel that these tanning centres should be manned not banned.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	I have spent a little while looking to see if these Salons are subject to specific Legislation -eg License to run a Public House- but it appears that in the UK they aren't.<br>  <br>  Add that to "unmanned", or "unpersoned" if you prefer, then it is fairly worrying.<br>  <br>  ps: impressed that a Lassie who reads the Scottish Sun can spell Cymru!|`|4x8hiC1xaa	yes they should<br>  if some1 really wants 2 b a different color other than what they were born as the its called go 2 walmart n buy sum spray on tan or go lay outside naked n get a real tan<br>  <br>  tanning beds are bad for ur skin<br>  ik people say that the sun is worse but the sun is million miles away from us so its rays die down alot before they reach us when were outside<br>  tanning beds on the other hand has the same harmful rays as the sun axcept its just a few feet ( or even inches) away from ur skin so it doesnt die down at all which will harm ur skin faster than if u go outside in the sun|`|0MunIx8raa	Well any salon that doesn't follow rules and allows this to happen should be shut down.  You shouldn't have to lay in a tanning bed for 19 minutes anyway.  For those who do follow rules they shouldn't be punished for those who are careless.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	I think they should because there was a girl that got sick from it and i have heard on the news that it's not healthy it like being in the sun getting sun burnt|`|9twZdl6laa	It's called freedom of choice.  If you don't like them, don't use them.  Do you really want the government to take away another one of our freedoms?|`|W8aiAWe2aa	What the hell was a 14 year old doing using a salon anyway!!!!<br>  <br>  Yes they should be banned as they are a known cause of skin cancer.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Yes, they are really bad for your skin. I use to go to them when I was younger and it gave me rosacea, and hyperhidrosis. It can really mess up your skin.|`|f9yORGumaa	Banning tanning salons is absurd! They should always have experienced staff on hand, however. If a tanning salon is left unattended for people to use as they wish, then (and only then) should that particular salon be banned.<br>  <br>  People love to tan. And in reality, it doesn't turn you orange. It looks just like a tan from the actual sun (but better because there are no tan lines). <br>  <br>  People like to tan. Why take that away from them. People die from cigarettes every day and no one has taken those away!!|`|1T35X8dEaa	I think both parties are at fault. The Tanning Salon for not checking the age of the girl, and for the girl for not reading.<br>  <br>  If you want a real tan go into your back yard and get a sun tan.<br>  <br>  I don't think that tanning salons should be banned, I think that it staff should be present at ALL time, and monitor the users. <br>  <br>  It could be that the teen girl, set the degree too high, and stayed too long in the tanning bed. <br>  <br>  Her "first degree burns" are what people call Sun burns. she should have read the signs and not ignore them. It is mostly her fault, but it is also the Salons fault for not monitoring her usage and checking her age|`|3qa3BftUaa	No. She defied her parents by going to a salon. She ignored the no under sixteen sign. There were adequate warning signs which she also ignored. Instead of going on for just 4 minutes as advised, because she had'nt got a colour, she paid for another 15 minutes.. <br>  Whilst it is terrible that she suffered these burns, if she had'nt ignored everybody as teenagers do, she would'nt be in this situation. Its about time people took responsibility for their own actions. <br>  <br>  Those that are responsible should'nt be made to do with out, because there are idiots who ignore safety warnings. One stupid act by one stupid person, ruins it for the hundreds that are responsible.|`|wTxCz2EJaa	That particular salon should be shut down but an outright ban on all salons is uncalled for. The responsibility should lie with the individuals. Both the staff who need to make sure everything is being done safely and the customers who need to know when enough is enough.<br>  Yes they are a cause of skin cancer but so is the sun. They pose little threat when used responsibly.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	No they should not be banned based on this incident. The use of any product or service requires the user to follow directions. Just like cough medicine, heating pads, curling irons, kitchen knives, etc. These are all injurious things when the user is careless. I am sure there are instructions and warnings in these establishments and while I am sorry the girl was burned, she obviously did not follow those instructions.|`|5xgcKSbjaa	Well, she said she saw the warning signs, and didn't listen.  The girl can read, and she still chose to fry her skin anyways...So now everyone that likes to tan responsibly, has to suffer.  Oh, and how is "tanning" a bad thing?  How is going in the sun a bad thing?  We are living breathing animals, we were in the sun since the beginning of time.  I'm so sick of people telling us we basically need to go outside in the summer in long sleeves, long pants and the infamous "wide brimmed hat".  Just go sit in a cave and SHUT UP.|`|AA12279950	It's simply a staffing issue - if there had been a member of staff there, this could never have happened.  It's the lack of 'policing' that bothers me, if these units are just fed with cash, and not overseen by a human being, anyone can use them, next time it could be a 9yr old.  It also raises hygiene issues - if this girl was able to keep feeding the meter for 19 mins and there wasn't a staff member present, who would have cleaned the sunbed after her?  Yuk, yuk, yuk!|`|HVY2rqzfaa	While I don't think they are particularly good, I think that people should take responsibility for their actions rather than force the government into taking responsibility for us. <br>  <br>  She had access to correct information but chose to ignore it.

I watch the tourists flock here each year and half of them get badly burnt on the first day. Tanning salons are like everything else, be responsible about what you do.|`|yuTue84caa	no if she was stupid enough to use the sunbed for that long then its her own fault. I use sunbeds regularly but never go in for more that 10 minutes. I agree that all sunbed shops should be staff and everyone using them should be monitored.|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	i think they should close them , why do you want to be a color that is not even close to who you really are ? plus they can always sray tan if they cant live with out it .|`|52pZj3WFaa	So, she broke the rules, but all salons have to be closed? <br>  Where's the personal responsibility in all this?|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Yes...why doesn't everyone just wait for summer & get tanned the old fashioned way...its healthier & more fun!|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	no i love laughing at the orange people in my town.|`|F3DuuyThaa	no they shouldnt be banned|`|JkQKzW3daa	As a former tanning salon owner:<br>  I do not believe a tanning bed should be operated without any trained supervision.  I attended classes regarding the proper use of a tanning bed, and how the body handles it.  It's not a fifteen-minute seminar.  There is quite a bit to know about tanning, before you can safely operate the equipment and make recommendations to clients.  <br>  <br>  Ban unstaffed tanning salons before more people get hurt!  People are too stupid to be trusted with this medical equipment.  <br>  <br>  Only salons with trained and certified professionals should be allowed.|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	Yes they should definitely be banned. Teenagers don't heed warnings and it is likely that young girls like her go to them all the time all over the UK. They have no idea what they are doing to their skin - in fact most people that use sunbeds have any clue what long term damage is caused by sunbeds. I think sunbeds in general should be banned, if you're really desperate for a tan just use fake tan, it's not harmful to your skin and it looks just as good if you use the right stuff!!|`|KjRkECgtaa	Un-staffed salons should certainly be banned or perhaps less severely just staffed...<br>  <br>  but banning tanning salons altogether? Surely the potential for skin cancer that I want to hold should be under my own control (I mean this sincerely).|`|kp1Ksiyzaa	perhaps there should be like a time limit or something... and a age limit!|`|q5BkV27Daa	Well if you follow the rules it should be fine, but this girl didn't and paid the price. And why is a 14 year old in a tanning salon, and who gave her the money?|`|lgxE5nUoaa	When I was 21 I went tanning.  I have very fair skin and after a year of tanning, people said I looked "normal" but nobody thought I was actually tan.  So I gave it up and I would never go back - too expensive and not worth it.  If people want to go and fry themselves, I say have at it.  But you won't find me there.|`|ogLHkR0oaa	As far as I'm concerned the girl has only herself to blame ! It showed the salon on tv, there was a sign on the door stating "No Under 16s Allowed" There were signs on the interior walls giving warnings about tanning times. The girl's mother stated that she worked "in health and safety" she wasn't too concerned about her daughter being a risk on visits to this place !|`|AA10283080	No.<br>  <br>  14 year olds should be banned.<br>  <br>  If we can't ban them we should ban stupid people from entering public places without supervision of some sorts.<br>  <br>  With all the information out there we have on our bodies and how certain things are harmful to it you'd think people would be able to make decisions for themselves and live with the consequences of those decisions. As it is the people like this idiot in the story are the ones who are turning our world into a place where big brother has to monitor our actions and limit our freedoms for our own safety....which they shouldn't have to do.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	i think the unmanned ones should be banned but not other tanning salons. I always used sunbeds over the years and i knew the risks and now i have had a chunk cut out my stomach due to melanoma caused by sunbeds. But we all have a choice but to have them unmanned is irresponsible|`|GOifC7i3aa	no<br>  <br>  why should tanning salons be banned because this person could not follow instructions?<br>  <br>  why should we ban thinga because some people are stupid?<br>  <br>  perhaps she will learn to follow instructions .....and rules<br>  she was underage when she chose to make use of this service<br>  <br>  perhaps we should just ban stupid people

hYOEQdgnaa	A banker spends twice as much on alcohol in one night as a nurse gets in one year.

1e49c01a09d631f160dc7e1ac3b6b9beaa	I noticed the flags & thought how ceremonial they looked.  I'm proud to be a Canadian & I've got enough confidence as a Canadian not to let something like that bother me.  In fact I'm glad they did it, because it shows how far Canadians are willing to go to show Politeness & Respect to a visiting dignitary, & who cares if the US would not have done the same.  It shows we are different & respectful.<br>  <br>  We better hone up our skills of politeness, because the world will be watching in 2010, or would you rather show another face of Canada that we know to be true, but refuse to admit that we know longer are as friendly & polite as we boast about?<br>  <br>  The flags were a fine spectacle to show how Canada can host important moments in history.  Remember, the 2010 games will have to show thousands of different flags that are not the Canadian one.  Show your true citizenship & embrace the spectacle.|`|O71xlcG3aa	I see a hundred different flags here a day...the texas flag, us flag, rebel flag, mexico flag and so on.  Such a petty thing to get upset about.  I'm pretty sure that Obama and the rest of us have nothing but love and respect for Canada!  I'm just saying there are more important things we should be concerned about then flags...|`|NMpbLtuTaa	It didn't bother me because in some ways I am very North America minded. Reasons for that are:<br>  I am not at all English and do not defend British colonialism;<br>  My ancestor arrived in Canada in the 1600's;<br>  His brother lived in what became the United States; and<br>  I have many family connections in the United States.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I am a loyal Canadian and do not believe for a second that we should join the United States. As a matter of fact, I believe Canadians should pay more attention to their resources because the Americans will take whatever they can get for free.<br>  We should be on guard against the idea that provinces can become states with more powers under the American federal system than they have under the Canadian system. What would happen if Canada joined the U.S. and then the new nation took a turn toward strong federalism and socialism? <br>  We could have millions of Americans moving to Canada and taking over what Canadians have worked for without paying a cent!|`|pyN2S2MHaa	I noticed that, too.  I don't think that a state visit by a Canadian head of state to Washington  would lead to such a massive display of Canadian flags.  It was as if Parliament hill were an amusement park heavily reliant on American tourism. But -ouch- there's an element of reality in that.<br>  <br>  Oh- since the Prime Minister is not our head of state his visit might not merit much pomp and ceremony.  But I don't think that Americans would allow their flag to be displayed equally with the Canadian flag for the Governor General or even for the Queen - not even if there were an occasion when she visited Washington exclusively in her role as Queen of Canada.|`|e4ebc08557e7843458d66e6d4375e253aa	A few years ago there was a group of Canadians that secured the release of a group of Americans being held hostage in an arabic country. I don't recall the exact details but afterwords, I noticed alot of Canadian flags being flown below the American flag as a way of saying thanks.  Didn't bother me at all, in fact I thought was kind of cool. Please don't think thatAmericans are greedy and opurtunistic. I am a loyal American but I love Canada too.|`|daf31a0f11d6dd2ff61a771f182635ddaa	I hadn't noticed the proliferation of American flags, but I can understand your concern if you feel that there was an overabundance of them.  Of course the Canadian flag should be more prominently displayed in Canada, as it represents the country|`|AA12050428	I really would have thought one was sufficient, the others are a bit OTT.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	I did not happen to notice that but I think you are right.
AA12349988	I agree - other criminals are let out to get married, but not allowed overnight stays.<br>  <br>  Lets see what happens but if I was Hello or Heat or whoever and  I had the exclusive pics I would be throwing booze down his neck so that he does something stupid and then I could make a packet on the photos.<br>  <br>  He's not the sharpest tool in the box - this could all back fire.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	This has already been asked countless times.<br>  It is public knowledge that Jack is breaking his curfew for one night. Reason it is public knowledge is this is public news because of Jade.<br>  <br>  How do you know that this has not happened countless times for other normal people like you and me. Would they put that on the news??? NO of course not.<br>  <br>  Maybe just try and focus on the fact that it is just one night for his dying bride.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	people are let out of prison for funerals and to visit dying relatives. At the end of the day what does it matter to us, we are not going through what they are going through. We may not agree with what he did and we may not like him but the woman he loves will be gone forever in a few weeks so lets give them a break it does not affect us|`|EEpBrsSnaa	Normally I would agree with you but these are exceptional circumstances and I think this is fair, just this once.|`|AA12279950	He's being treated no differently to anyone else.

How did she manage that?|`|AoJKQRNXaa	extenuating circumstances|`|d6MDxrMlaa	No.It's the wealth.|`|3qa3BftUaa	I think under the circumstances it is the right thing to do. What he did was wrong and he should be punished., but It would be petty and disgraceful to not allow a dying woman one night with her husband. She has only a week or so left to live. The government bends the rules for others when it wants to. Jade deserves this one last act of kindness before she dies. If she was'nt dying but still getting married then I would'nt agree to his curfew being broken as they would have the rest of their lives together. But it would be a sad state of affairs if this request was denied in my opinion. Would it not be against her human rights.<br>  <br>  If we can allow evil scumbags like that muslim preacher of hate to get what he wants when he wants, then dying people should get what they want too.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Whilst I don't like the nasty comments made about Jade Goody on this site, I feel inclined to agree with you about this.  Children need to see that everyone is treated equitably.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	Hang on Jack tweedy isn't being released for his wedding, he is being released from an asbo so he could spend his wedding night with his future wife.<br>  <br>  If it bothers her that much why can't she spend the night at her mother in law's house where he has to spend his asbo?<br>  <br>  He will be at the wedding, and at his wife's side when she dies.<br>  <br>  The wedding night is a completely different kettle of fish.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	All of the media that is feeding into the Jade Goody's cancer thing should be condemned as she is not news but at best Jade is D list celebrity. I believe it is totally unfair as Jade Goody is doing nothing more than prostituting herself for the money and using her surge in popularity to get the rules changed for her criminal boyfriend. I wonder what Social Services in the UK has to say about this arrangement especially someone who has a GBH conviction? GBH is quite a serious charge especially if it was with intent to cause serious bodily harm. I guess the only thing Jade can be thankful for is that the guy lived. Now since he is marrying her I wonder if the A v Hoare decision will be applicable here and the person that her boyfriend savagely attacked would be able go after him for additional compensation.  Me I am hoping the guy tries to use the decision in A v Hoare to go after her boyfriend.  In any event instead of spending time to say good-bye to her children and family she is trying to make the last pound she can. In my opinion she is not doing anything positive for women with cervical cancer and only proving her critics are correct.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Jack Straw said that it was reasonable to allow this and who is to argue with him ? This was allowed on compassionate grounds which in my opinion is perfectly reasonable|`|GsV67vUNaa	It's not one person though.<br>  <br>  Working in a hospital, I've seen people have their curfew broken to be with their dying relatives. I've also seen one allowed to have a day out of prison to be with his dying wife.<br>  <br>  It happens quite regularly in cases where somebody is dying (which Jade Goody is).|`|52pZj3WFaa	Nope. And anyone else would have organised their wedding to take this into account. She obviously believes her own press and that she is sooooo loved by everyone that she can do what the fcuk she wants. And she can, judging by whats going on.<br>  <br>  Well done Max Clifford. Why not just let everyone off of their judgements because we've all got a sob story to tell.|`|DIihJrUiaa	No, I think it's ridiculous that the rules have been bent for him. Also, if he has to be back at his Mum's house at 7pm every night and they are only letting him off for one night, what kind of marriage are they going to have?!|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	i was thinking that today<br>  i know it's her dieing wish to get married so i'm all right with the break but i think they should have extended his curfew for missing that day<br>  <br>  p.s. we have the same avitar :O|`|hYOEQdgnaa	Under most circumstances no it isn't.  But under these circumstances I think anyone in Jack Tweed's situation should be allowed to break their curfew for one night|`|tbjujTjsaa	They obviously got it toooo easy those celebrities|`|kvm9MWdZaa	I think you would have to be made of stone to object to this.|`|ppU2UO8Waa	no he shouldn't but his wife is going to die of cancer in like 2 weeks so i think if its for his wedding then yes !|`|yil9IAH4aa	yes|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	it is hard to be a celeb.<br>  if you are honet with yourself and sit down and think about it instead of angling your argument to slagging them off with your friends i guarantee you will see......<br>  it aint a free ride i promise....<br>  <br>  its the law of the land and the governors and guardians of the law decide.<br>  <br>  Jack tweed was simply defending his misses.<br>  kids like that have been all over the news and papers responsible for violent crimes against innocent, weak, and vulnerable people, lone women and attack in number and very aggressivly and brutaly. This type of crime that Jack Fought to prevent is a fairly modern disease.<br>  But still Wickedness.<br>  <br>  i have never heard of anyone guilty of his crime being treated harshly in prison or over there sentence, if there wife was dying i am sure they could get the same treatment, your being simple and jumping on  a band wagon, YOU ARE SIMPLY ONE OF THOSE WEIRD PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO HATE CELEBRITIES OR LIKE TO DO SPITEFUL THINGS TO THEM, maybe a bit like the 'fan' in that movie...<br>  <br>  it was self defence, he steeped up, he's a very young man, close probably to thier age, i think he did extremely well, those creatures he attacked could of raided his house and created a trend or weirdness... no seriously.... you should be grateful.|`|T4AMBr5uaa	What on earth has happened to compassion in this country? How do you know that rules aren't bent for others in his situation? How many in his place have a bride to be who is facing imminent death? The man is not a murderer or a paedophile etc, besides if he was a danger to society he would hardly be out, albeit tagged.<br>  I too have no time for the moronic celebrity obsessed society in which we now live, but i hope i can show a little feeling for someone who is dying. For God's sake, she is just 27 years old, how would you feel if it was you? I honestly hope that such tragedy never touches your life. I have known others who have died from cancer in their 20's, it's awful - have some common decency and allow this human being to have her last wish.|`|q5BkV27Daa	She's dying for Gods sake, what difference does one little night in a lifetime matter. Yes he committed a violent crime and he went to prison and is tagged for it. I think there is something wrong with the system (and you) if you cant give him a break to spend what will probably be his last nights with the woman he loves.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	They used to say that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor, it makes you wonder if things are going back that way.  Where I have all the sympathy in the world for Jade and I know she has not got long for this world, I still think its a disgrace to change the curfew on her future husband.  The ordinary man in the street could have the same problem, wife dying, want to get married, but the rules would not be changed for him. So in answer to your question, no I do not think it is fair to change the rules for one person.<br>  Lets just hope that another criminal with a curfew does not use this case as an example for them to have the curfew lifted just once. The only reason this man is known is because he is the boyfriend of Jade Goody, apart from that he is just another criminal with a curfew.  The curfew is only being lifted for a wedding not for the fact his wife is dying.

I don't ever use slang and especially not around my grandparents, particularly my grandmother. I am very conscientious of this and I want to be respectful. That said my grandmother is very sharp and maybe sometimes a little more with it then me! She'll call me up on things. I so find it very interesting that the report says that slang is influenced to (some degree) by generations. Actually there is quite a lot of truth in that, I have heard many terms which were even used in the 50s and 60s. But! I also read somewhere that slang (probably in particular places) is heavily influenced by immigrants. I feel this has more truth in it.<br>  <br>  Edit: My grandmother does not use words that I am not familiar with. She's lived in England since she was 15 and so I think she is so used to speaking proper English. My grandfather on the other hand does use some to a degree but if I ever do not understand something from what he said I'll just work it out. I enjoy talking to both of them but me and my grandmother can speak for hours with no communication problems at all.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Sadly mine too are long gone but my maternal grandmother was an absolute riot. She'd have you in stitches from morning to night telling old tales. Being from the west coast of Ireland she called everyone 'agraw' which meant dear or darling.

Today Radio York have been discussing the grandparent looking after children issue again and there's a compilation of children's sayings about grandparents which are lovely but this particular one really made me laugh. Teacher asked a little boy where his Grandma lived, to which he replied "at the airport". Teacher asked him to explain a little more and the six year old stuck his hands on his hips, sighed deeply and said " when we need Grandma we go pick her up at the airport and when we've finished needing her we take her back".

dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Yes, I think hate speech should be banned.  Freedom occurs within limits of ethical, moral and civil behavior.  People have taken this freedom of speech too far in their interpretation, and with so many formats of open and anonymous communication, there seems to be no restraint on what people will say and how they say it.  Words can create the reality and reality affects behavior.  If people don't have enough self-discipline and respect for others to refrain from using hate speech, then there needs to be protocol for acceptable communication.  If that is banning hate speech, so be it.<br>  The guidelines for communication in YA is a good example.|`|52pZj3WFaa	I think that hate speech should be banned. Freedom of Speech is something that we just cannot handle and treat with such disdane, nowadays.<br>  <br>  Hate speeches incite hatred in others and are based on uneducated bias and ignorance.

Lx6TXgHKaa	Your suggestion is nice in theory.<br>  But just try to put yourself in the place of teacher and see what they have to go through in the classroom. Some children are unruly and their parents too are as unruly. Instead of explaining their own children about the folly they have committed they come to school to defend their children's behavior. They have a big ego problem.<br>  <br>  Even if a teacher somehow punishes a child, it's not because s/he hates the child, but because s/he wants the child to improve, for it's own good. It's really absurd if a small child and his/her parents make that thing an ego issue.<br>  <br>  Only if you could make the child improve on this count, teachers will be more than happy.

9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>Israeli racist terrorist criminal organization always has criminal and terrorist leaders.<br>  <br>  >>> In fact peace is so far; Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace is so far.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Right.
