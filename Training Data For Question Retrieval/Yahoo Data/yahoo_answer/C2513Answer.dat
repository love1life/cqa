nuyjnfOfaa	First off . . Great question!    I would say that the differance between the two is that erotica has a plot, decent characters and a good story with a mix of detailed sexual interaction thrown in: the sexuality in the erotica is to enhance the story, not just there for the sake of being there.    Porn is just that, sex for sex's sake.    I enjoy reading and writing erotica!|`|38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	In my oppinion, erotica actually has a plot, and the content that makes it erotica actually contributes to the plot, like rape scenes, usually.    Pornography is pretty much just writing sex scenes for the sake of it, without any plot or meaning at all.|`|cXrOpvXoaa	All pornography is a base form of erotica, all erotica is not necessarily pornographic. Erotica is anything that stimulates one in an erotic, or essentially sexual manner. It is very different for some people including fetishes but the response is the same. Good luck and God Bless.

Employers don't look at your major (unless you want to be a doctor, or something like that), they just want to see that you have a college education.  College isn't supposed to be a job training school, it's supposed to be a center of higher education.    I majored in History and I ended up finding a job with a company in Korea.  Your major will not prevent you from finding or obtaining a job.|`|NQoyw4T5aa	Teacher of same, politition, journalist, lawyer.

mG0SVb7waa	sweet. But sometime later you feel bad 'bout it.|`|LuAnWR1yaa	It can be both, but the thing that is scary is you never know when it will come back and bite you----- Regret!!!   Cheers!!!|`|xm7kFnfNaa	Bittersweet. The revenge for you is sweet, but it can seed even more bitterness on who you extracted revenge upon. They will desire revenge on you, hence a vicious cycle of shot for shot will take place. Futhermore, revenge is extremely contagious - as soon as you correct a wrong in your mind it grows and you wish for more of its sweetness. Eventually this sugar of your own personal justice will poison your life.|`|Gx61oFg6aa	I'm all about vengeance- Let me tell you something Vengeance is the greatest feeling that man can experience, the greatest feeling that the Great Lord has bestowed upon men, because vengeance is better then anything, the greatest euphoria. There's no better feeling then pitting ur mind, wit, cunning against somebody elses and then going to bed with a smug smile on ur face knowing that u destroyed somebody's life who was to foolish to fuc with the wrong person. Vengeance is what sustains us. But like machiavelli said when you seek vengeance you must smite him to the ground body, soul, and spirit for he will seek reprisal as soon as he recovers. Destroy every atom in his goddman body if u must.|`|AA11011758	Revenge!   Forgive and Forget, then there won't be any reason to ask this question, the taste of sweet or bittersweet, would have to be just an opinion of a comparison of a action of an evil person.|`|0942a1bc2a399b2936d5b87ef3f878e8aa	i think its both , i think first its sweet and then you realize its bittersweet later.|`|J8jJeypDaa	it could be either of the two or it could be both.      i think it's all about social and  religious orientation. the 2 could mold you into the kind of person you are. if you're social background brought you up to be cold hearted that goes with religion that sees punishment as the means to being close to our maker that goes the same for th family, then it's sweet.    if you are brought up god fearing but society taught you to punish, then it could be bittersweet.    depending on the kind of people and rulest hat govern around you, the outcome could be both.|`|BscGSVfVaa	bittersweet, the bitterness comes with the responsibilities  we bear for our actions. revenge is usually a reflex and people are so hurt that they don't think of the consequences, it is when they regain their reason when it becomes bitter.|`|3IVqoH16aa	I think bittersweet.  Revenge is not a direct expression of a feeling, only an indirect one.  So that feeling of satisfaction you get from revenge isn't as complete as you would have hoped.  I think the motivation behind revenge is a need to feel understood.  You want the other person to know that they wronged you and how deeply they hurt you.  But expressing this emotion directly indicates vulnerability.  And if one is afraid of being or appearing vulnerable, revenge can be the preferred self-expression/solution to the problem.   So when you exact revenge, you never know if your message got across like you wanted it to and you have the knowledge that YOU have now wronged someone.  Is the wrong justified in some cases?  Hmm...tough question.  Even if it is justified, does it still affect us?|`|XvO4iLk0aa	A waste of time. As long as you are concerned about it, you are lost in the past and the perpetrator is controlling your life. i have been through this more than once and finally learned to build my life based on wisely using experience, rather than letting the past be my anchor.|`|VuDvxXZ6aa	Revenge is sweet. Because you cant let someone that has betrayed you or hurt you get away with it.|`|azIA2rmRaa	Bittersweet.  You can't walk away from doing something bad and not even feel the slightest bit guilty. If not guilt, you'll at least think about it.|`|gR0i6w82aa	It can be both depending on the circumstances.      1.  It can be sweet, especially if you took no part in the "revenge," but just got to watch it.  Example:  You are falsely accused of stealing on the job, and you know who set you up and who really did the theft.  You remain quiet and let the internal investigation take its course.  At the end you are cleared, the guilty parties are adequetely punished.  It is sweet, and your conscience is clear, because you didn't take any ugly actions to "get even."    2.  Your wife/husband cheats on you and it breaks your heart.  You know your spouse's lover is just playing around, not serious, so you let your spouse find out about the other flings of the lover.  Your spouse now also has a broken heart, or at the least, humiliated pride.  This is bittersweet, because your heart is still broken, and the relationship is irreparably broken.  There's even a possibility that if your spouse had learned about this "cheating" in another way, you could have repared the relationship, but now it's hopeless.  Definitely bittersweet, and not sweet!|`|e26a557a9ad5b63bf3480b4165307199aa	I don't think its either. I think its unfufilling and poisonous to whoever is vengeful. I think its far more harmful to that person than the person who is the target of the revenge.

mJrKfFLJaa	The 007 number assigned to James Bond may have been influenced by any number of sources. In the films and novels, the 00 prefix indicates Bond's discretionary 'licence to kill', in executing his duties.    Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story entitled ".007: The Story of an American Locomotive", in which anthropomorphized train locomotives talk about their work and problems; the story has nothing to do with espionage, but Kipling's work would have been very popular during Fleming's youth and he could well have been familiar with the title. Kipling was also the author of "Kim", a popular and influential spy novel also about an orphan spy.   Another version of the origins of the number 007 is that it is the number of the coach service from Deal in Kent to London, passing by Higham Park, where Ian Fleming spent much time, and where he was inspired to write his children's novel, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.   It is also said that Bond borrowed his 007 title from Dr John Dee. The 16th century English secret agent used the code for his messages to Queen Elizabeth I. The two zeros meant "for your eyes only".     James Bond has number 007 because he is the seventh agent. Thus there's also a 001, 002, etcetera.     John Dee (1527-1608) was an English mathematician, professor, astronomer, and spy who gave it all up for the (at that time) more lucrative occupation of being an astrologer. And it was John Dee who was the original 007:     In Dee's private communications with the Queen, the secret name identifying him to Queen Elizabeth is believed to have been none other than that of 007. In Hort's biography of Dee, it mentions only a "journey on some unnamed business of the Queen's."     Perhaps, just as interesting, it has also been contended that the character Prospero from Shakespeare's "The Tempest" was Shakespeare's idealized portrait of John Dee.     Final Notes Here's one final interesting gem of information passed onto me by astrologer Rick Levine at StarIQ. One possibility, according to astrologer Rob Hand, is that - rather than signing his letters to the Queen with the numbers 007 - John Dee's secret signature may have instead been a glyph word picture depicting a pair of handheld eyeglasses that looked like the numbers 007.     As such, Dee would have been slyly passing on the message that he was "the Queen's eyes."     Not having access to any original documents, here's an imaginative guess as to what Dee's secret signature may have looked like.     It has been alleged that there was a Soviet assassination unit known as "double zero" or "double oh".   DFF|`|mggll8dRaa	I Agree With "Jonathon's Answer",.....!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Ian Fleming chose 007.for James Bond,because Fleming was a spy for London during World War 2.and his spy number was 007. That is the reason he chose the same number for James Bond|`|8ekoa6szaa	Maybe 7 was his lucky number?  I've never heard and don't know the answer, but I've always wondered about 1-6!!!

Bond was number 7 in the line of agents with the license to kill.     Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story entitled ".007: The Story of an American Locomotive". The story has nothing to do with espionage, yet Kipling's work was very popular during Fleming's youth.     007 is the number of the bus service from Deal in Kent to London.

The two zeros meant "for your eyes only" (Note the reference to another Bond movie).    Some people think there was a Soviet assassination unit known as "double zero" or "double oh". Since Fleming was a student of such things this too might have been an influence.   |`|XcKVtm5Gaa	007 means that he has a license to kill, he is the top one.  I fully agree with Robert and Jonathan. bang on

VuJRn8gVaa	I would say... being brutally honest, here, that it has potential and that's just what I'd call it.  It seems to be linear in some places, descriptive in others, weary in some, hopeful in others, so I feel that it as i read it, it lacks cohesiveness. Also, I noticed a lot of trite or cliche words and phrases; if I were you I'd go through and weed some of them out (ie, the word *just*- get rid of it!).      Sounds to me like you have insomnia and are troubled by sleep, so you think about happier things to distract your mind while your body drifts off. All in all, I honestly like it.  I'm not really sure what it is about the poem,  but I really like it.  If I were you, I would spend some time rewriting and editing and clean it up. You should read Sylvia Plath (esp. Ariel) and then work on it.  This reminds me of Sylvia Plath in a way.  Maybe she'll inspire you.  :)|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I think it has really good thoughts, it's interesting. All you need to fix is the structure.|`|UHmfzQbGaa	it is good in the way that is has depth, but it needs maybe a little bit more flow, and maybe the word nirvana is used a little too many times?  And no, it DEFINITELY is not bad.
zH80yyDQaa	Maybe you should read the book?    Just Kidding! I would say that the Rising Action is when Mr. Darcy asks Elizabeth to marry him and then ends up insulting her and her family.     OR     When Elizabeth finds out, when she still likes Mr. Darcy, that he is actually supposed to get married to his cousin.     Which ever you think is worse.|`|UWIVOidYaa	Well, here:  http://mb.sparknotes.com/mb.epl?b=533&m=...  I really hope you read it, though; it's a great book.    Edit: Note, I changed the link.

A 8 months old baby has no experience of life yet he/she can imagine life according to him/herself observations, agree? Do you think that the observations & the experiences are the same? Not of course. Probably you're asking this question after being an adult, right? It's obvious to think that way.

I feel very sad for people in this situation because I am so lucky with my parents.  I am now the caregiver for my mother 15x7x52 -- one of these days I hope someone will step up and give me a break; but this is a gift that I treasure.

Bjb4ZdBkaa	"to be educated is to be transformed by what you know" am too lazy to look up who said that.     Being educated is about the acquiring information and knowledge non-stop. It is about understanding that the human mind can never fully coomprehend evrything. It is about using this information and knowledge you have in a way that is based on many anaylses and conclusions in your mind. One of the greatest dictators of our time, Rubert Mugabe (Zimbabwe) has four degrees. As evidenced by his behavior book smart is not to be educated but rather to b eeducated is how one uses the knowledge one posesses|`|NENdAfDLaa	I think that being educated is simply being able to read, study, comprehend and interpret. It sounds really simple, like a child's point of view, but it's true. I've been given a new gift; the gift of interpreting, which is to present something in understandable terms. I received the gift from Jesus because I did something for Him without hesitation. In return, He gave me this gift. I have been using it for awhile now. It's strange, because most people still don't understand what I'm trying to tell them. All I can do is the best I can do.   |`|RsQkXEtWaa	Education is much more than going to school and getting good grades. In fact grade are becoming less relevant as time is progressing because of what kids these days are getting graded on. Getting an A for bringing a book to class or having an organized notebook is not what makes up education. I believe education is partly about learning common facts and learning basic reading and writing skills, but its more importantly, about learning how to think and analyze. We need to stop giving students standardized tests ( which are usually easier than any of the tests they have take that year).|`|FoIxsunVaa	Not all knowledge is education. Educated people are not smarter or more knowledgeable than uneducated people. They have just gathered information in a formal way.    Your attempt to confuse the subject by describing "education" as a pejorative against those without one is an uneducated prejudice. But the POINT you are trying to make is valid. I just don't think you are actually asking anybody what education is. That is just a red herring. You really want to spout about the "wisdom" of an 80 year old grandmother with a third grade education.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Your question mixes education with knowledge, wisdom, understanding, experience, and worship.     The professor has a certain acquired knowledge. The Grandmother has experience a life of education. The Lawyer a certain knowledge of the rules of conduct.    But for us all the law is life itself and not the rules of its conduct.     A life of learning to your full capacity is true education.

AA10478980	In Chapter 5 Simon says what is probably one of the most important quotes in the novel.  He says What I mean is . . . Maybe it's only us . . .  It's in chapter 5, several pages from the end.   Simon's words are central to Golding's point that innate human evil exists. Simon is the first character in the novel to see the beast not as an external force but as a component of human nature. Simon does not yet fully understand his own idea, but he knows that there is something in them that is changing and evolving into viciousness.  He is thoughtful about it.      There is another place in the novel where Simon refuses to eat the meat, so you may be able to find that one.

You're probably not really that bad, are you? Give yourself a break, dude.|`|ioVRxBEtaa	What ever you want for you to make you feel better about yourself and when you are an old person you can look back and have no regrets and your children and grandchildren are proud of you-- time goes fast- make the most out of it|`|5fmPj6uEaa	if you can achieve your aims causing no hurt to others then you are doing fine.|`|4025a3c70cf6be94cf57472ae130d67caa	I have a question, Why should those goals be mutually exclusive?    Further, why is getting a degree, job, etc. the right thing?    Being polite, kind, caring, understanding should never be regarded as a chore that must be done. These like getting an education, if not a degree, become their own reward in the end. I know this sounds like an Old Grandmother speech but it is in fact true. This why, when we display these characteristics to others we find that those around us act the same back and those that don't, those who wish only to use and discard those around them are very quickly exposed. This means that in the end one is surrounded by a better class of people, ones who care and wish to help those around them. Ordinarily this is only OK but what of those times when we fall on hard times? Those who wish to use us disappear back into the wood work leaving only those who wish to help behind. We become more resilient because of those around us.    Also, the goals of just being and getting a job and all that do not need to be mutually exclusive. There are a multitude of jobs out there requiring a plethora of skills to complete. It is said that when we love our job we never have to work a day in our life, this is one of the truest statements ever made. I currently work in a laboratory and since I have started I have not worked a day since I look forward to coming into my job each day. Work should never be teadious, strenuos or feel like a ten tonne weight hanging above our heads, if it is then it not the right job for you. Being a productive citizen when you love what you do is not an effort, it is a joy, achieving goals when you want to get to it is not hard work it is laughably easy.    Find what you love to do, what fires your soul and you can quite literally have your cake and eat it too!    Hope this helps.|`|qSbNY5XPaa	How does 'good' feel about all this? It just wants to get spread around, and no one is willing to give it the courtesy. Good is left alone, ignored by humans in favour of the superficial and temporarily satisfying. No one can 'be' good, you have to give it a ride. But not in only if you have a spare seat, you have to piggy-back it.|`|lk1Qmtzeaa	First of all, you are putting entirely too much stress upon yourself for no particular reason. By saying that you must choose a path of kindness, niceness, politeness, etc., (note the word "choose"), you are defining yourself as an evil, disruptive and unproductive person by nature. If that were the case, you would not be asking the question. You would be thinking or doing evil things. Since you are asking the question, there really is no choice but to do, as you say, "the right thing." It is in your nature to be kind. It is in your nature to be nice, polite, productive, and so on. You cannot choose to live your life against your nature any more than you can "see" your eyes when you look at things. Just relax. Let go of the perceived conundrum. It really doesn't exist. You created it. Let it evaporate and just enjoy your life. You will be very surprised how much you will enjoy getting a degree, especially about five or 10 years afterwards. Relax. Enjoy.|`|cnj6fqpyaa	I have this arguement with myself on a daily basis. If you want to help people then you are doing what you want anyway. It's not very rewarding if you only help people to help yourself fit into the machine. That's the same as kissing the boss' *** to get a promotion. It's very selfish.     I find that most human acts are selfish but if you get a good feeling because you helped someone who really needs your help (not like the boss) you will be rewarded with genuine peace of mind. It will give you a sense of worth like no other. Don't ever just do something because someone else told you that you should. You will never have any self worth if that's the case. Society has too many of those people, just living their lives bound to what society says you shoudl do to be a good citizen. Do it because you want to and that makes you a good person in my eyes, not that you would care what my eyes see, if you were doing things for yourself.|`|cZscHVvvaa	Certainly sounds as though you're having to make an effort to be "good". Just what is it that you want to do that you consider to be less than good? Avoid work perhaps?   I would say it's best to be yourself and do what it is you want to do, with the proviso that it should not harm others. In a way, avoiding work can harm others if they have to work harder to support you but then again you should not spend your life living a lie. Take some time out and figure out what you really want to do; you'll end up being a better citizen than if you had driven yourself mad by trying to be what other people wanted you to be.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	This is a "false dilemma."  In fact, you have "freedom loving" and "duty/success loving" sides to your personality.    One approach:  each evening, as you go to sleep, ask God to teach, heal, and guard you, as your body rests.    During the day, be productive, do the right and expected.  However, try to find out and determine what makes you happier, among doing the right things.  If you like or love some kinds of productivity more, that's a clue.    Next, give yourself a Sabbath; Saturday or Sunday, dedicate the day to loving God, doing what you call "giving up and just being yourself."  That doesn't imply drunkenness, etc., but just relaxing, going on walks in nature, gardening, some sports, just having a good time.    Try this for a while.   It may be that you have some concern about taking a regular Sabbath; too much school work, etc.  However, refreshing yourself, just relaxing, going fishing, smiling because you're happy, more often tend to encourage you to be more focussed during the week, when you apply yourself.    Balance, in other words.    "Paths of Light and Darkness," Mark Prophet.

Even if you like what you do on a daily basis there may be a few things that you do not agree with. Either the time that you are required to do it in, or the manner that you have to do it in.      Most people do what they don't want to do out of comfort. Take for example if you have a job that you hate. It is not that you want to continue to do something that makes you unhappy but you may need the money or you have to hang in there till you can find something better.|`|priviDmYaa	well it depends on what the person likes and their age, students that dont like school will most likely spand maybe 65% of their day doing what they dont like to do while those who like it will spend 15% to 20% doing what they dont like to do. Adults with jobs will probably spend varied percentages doing what they dont like to do. somtimes between 60% to 30% doing what they dont like to do, and unemployed adults spend maybe 30% to 70% doing what they dont like to do since they dont have anything to do with their lives.  The main motive of doing what you dont like to do could be because what it is that you dont like to do could be a necessity, or its your only choice, as i said before, students that dont like school have a higher percentage than those who like school since school is pretty much a necessity, and unemploted adults dont have an alternative to doing nothing since they dont have any money to do something|`|udAoP6R1aa	well, Im still in school, so about 70%, and then I'll start working full time, so the percentage will still probably be over 50 %...thats just the way our society is...|`|kTBE4dYEaa	ok i worked out mon-thurs i spend 33.33% of my day doing stuff i don't want to do. so 1 third of my day is crap, but i don't think that is too bad. except i'm on holidays, so a normal day when i have uni as well as work is worse...|`|sY7g3ttPaa	No, I did not want to answer your question.

Everything, EVERYTHING you do, you do it because you want to. You always have the choice to not do it and accept the consequences.

So in answer to your question; 0%|`|xypsY8bFaa	I'd say about 40% of my day is spent doing things I'd rather not be doing (like dealing with all the rules at my work, cleaning up messes, doing dishes, accounting for every penny I spend to stay on budget, etc.) As much as I would like to not do these things, they are necessary to take care of, to provide and care for myself and my family.

A dictionary defines the term "God" as "the supreme or ultimate reality." What is the nature of such an awesome reality?    Is God an impersonal force or a real person? Does he have a name? Is he a triune entity, a Trinity, as many believe? How can we come to know God? The Bible provides truthful and satisfying answers to these questions. In fact, it encourages us to seek God, saying: "He is not far off from each one of us." Acts 17:27.    An Impersonal Force or a Real Person?  Many who believe in God think of him as a force, not as a person. In certain cultures, for example, gods have been identified with the forces of nature. Some who have examined evidence gathered through scientific research into the structure of the universe and the nature of life on earth have concluded that there has to be a First Cause. Nevertheless, they hesitate to attach a personality to this Cause.    Yet, does not the complexity of creation indicate that the First Cause must have had great intelligence? Intelligence requires a mind. The great mind responsible for all creation belongs to the person of God. Yes, God has a body, not a physical one like ours, but a spiritual body. "If there is a physical body," says the Bible, "there is also a spiritual one." (1 Corinthians 15:44) Explaining the nature of God, the Bible clearly states: "God is a Spirit." (John 4:24) A spirit has a form of life that differs greatly from ours, and it is invisible to human eyes. (John 1:18) There are invisible spirit creatures as well. They are angels "the sons of the true God." Job 1:6; 2:1.    Since God is an uncreated person with a spiritual body, he logically has a place of residence. Referring to the spirit realm, the Bible tells us that the heavens are God's "established place of dwelling." (1 Kings 8:43) Also, the Bible writer Paul states: 'Christ entered into heaven itself to appear before the person of God for us.' Hebrews 9:24.    The word "spirit" is also used in the Bible in another sense. Addressing God in prayer, the psalmist said: "If you send forth your spirit, they are created." (Psalm 104:30) This spirit is not God himself but a force that God sends forth, or uses, to accomplish whatever he wishes. By means of it, God created the physical heavens, the earth, and all living things. (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 33:6) His spirit is called holy spirit. God used his holy spirit to inspire the men who wrote the Bible. (2 Peter 1:20, 21) Hence, the holy spirit is the invisible active force that God uses to fulfill his purposes.    God Has a Unique Name  The Bible writer Agur asked: "Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a mantle? Who has made all the ends of the earth to rise? What is his name and what the name of his son?" (Proverbs 30:4) In effect, Agur was asking, 'Do you know the name or family line of any man who has done these things?' Only God has the power to control natural forces. While the creation provides powerful proof that God exists, it is silent about the name of God. In fact, we could never know God's name unless God himself revealed it to us. And he has. "I am Jehovah," says the Creator, "that is my name." Isaiah 42:8.    God's unique name, Jehovah, occurs nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures alone. Jesus Christ made that name known to others and praised it before them. (John 17:6, 26) That name is found in the last book of the Bible as a part of the expression "Hallelujah," meaning "praise Jah." And "Jah" is the shortened form of "Jehovah." (Revelation 19:1-6, footnote) Yet, many modern Bibles seldom use that name. They often use the word "LORD" or "GOD," written in all capital letters to set it apart from the common titles "Lord" and "God." Some scholars suggest that the divine name may have been pronounced Yahweh      Why such differing views about the name of the greatest Personage in the universe? The problem began centuries ago when the Jews superstitiously ceased to pronounce the divine name and started to substitute the Hebrew word for "Sovereign Lord" whenever they came to the divine name as they read the Scriptures. Since Biblical Hebrew was written without vowels, there is no way to know precisely how Moses, David, and others of ancient times pronounced the letters that make up the divine name. However, the English pronunciation, Jehovah, has been in use for centuries, and its equivalent in many languages is widely accepted today. Exodus 6:3; Isaiah 26:4, King James Version.    Though there is uncertainty about how God's name was pronounced in ancient Hebrew, its meaning is not a complete mystery. His name means "He Causes to Become." Jehovah God thereby identifies himself as the Great Purposer. He always causes his purposes and promises to become reality. Only the true God, who has the power to do this, ca|`|6xqZBGLxaa	God is not our mind but our soul that is at rest, and that soul vanishes every time you mislead it to a wrong path, but it grows stronger when you lead it to the path of salvation and not hatred, that's the reason you feel safer when you have great faith in god... |`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	god has all the organs, that human beings have as he was created by man.|`|252b5fc46c0e5d66c884611ebe9e9db8aa	God has the point of existence...

U02wg7graa	Aaaah. knowing smile.<br>  <br>  Well that is always the question.There are no hints about that in the book at all, other than someone remarking on his posture and saying how he looked as though he had been in the army. I doubt that as he was only gone three years, and going in at the bottom (as you say, as a penniless vagabond without a name), there is no way he would have made his fortune that way. Perhaps he still had contacts with gypsies and went into something like smuggling. <br>  <br>  The only thing it really points to is his determination to get Cathy. It was after she talked of how with his lack of fortune it would degrade her to marry him. So he got a fortune.|`|3mYJ6WL9aa	A now,Uncle Joe.<br>  I've pondered this one myself.<br>  <br>  Apart from the money-issue,he comes back a gentleman{outwardly at least.}So I would presume that he has lived in"higher"society than the rough-edged Yorkshire background of his adoption.<br>  <br>  But judging from the more cruel aspects that his character manifests on his return,he has also found association with a criminal element.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that "gentleman criminal"was the source of his wealth.I'm glad that Emily doesn't spell it out as it adds to his mysterious appeal.He arrives from nowhere,disappears & rearrives from nowhere.<br>  <br>  Yes,there is textual reference to his possible gypsy-origins.But nothing to suggest that he went back to his roots.rather the opposite as he is outwardly more gentrified when he returns.<br>  <br>  I don't think the army theory is feasible.That would have tamed the wild animal aspect of the complex character that is Heathcliff.<br>  <br>  Obviously,he had to return with wealth in order to bag Cathy as his departure was motivated by her cruel,gold-digging words.<br>  <br>  There is a theory that Heathcliff was actually Cathy's father's illigitimate child.<br>  This is pure supposition.It also slides the relationship intp incest-territory.There is plenty of cross-marriage in the novel without this.<br>  <br>  My big question would be,"Why did Heathcliff return to Cathy at all?"On his return it really is a case of"arsus ex fenestra est"anyway.{Pun intended on Lockwood window-scene!}<br>  <br>  The mystery of his years away to my mind is a wonderful aspect of the novel.Just imagine having such an enormous obsession!

Le modle de Clausewitz, plus complexe, invite au contraire  articuler lautomate et ltre humain car seul ce dernier, sil a t bien form, pourra dans une situation imprvue interprter des rapports incomplets ou fallacieux et prendre la dcision juste.    La discussion sur lintelligence de lordinateur se situe sur cette toile de fond doctrinale. Soit on suppose que les hypothses du modle de Jomini sont vrifies (information parfaite, planification parfaite, etc.) et alors en effet laction peut tre dtermine au mieux par lautomate car il calcule vite et sans erreurs. Soit on suppose que la situation comporte une part dincertitude, de ? brouillard ?, et alors la contribution du cerveau humain est indispensable.    De ces deux modles, lequel est le bon ? Lorsquil sagit dassurer la maintenance dun quipement, le modle de Jomini semble simposer (sous la seule rserve que le technicien doit mettre une alarme en cas dimprvu). Mais par ailleurs si lordinateur permettait de supprimer lincertitude, cela se saurait dans les salles de march : les informaticiens auraient fait fortune  la Bourse.    La distinction propose  entre ? vnement interne ? et ? vnement externe ?, on peut dire que le modle de Jomini sapplique aux vnements internes,  la conduite du processus de production de lentreprise, et que le modle de Clausewitz sapplique aux vnements externes, que lentreprise ne peut ni ma?triser ni organiser entirement : relations avec les clients et avec les fournisseurs, conditions de la concurrence.    Sur ces vnements externes, mme si linformation sur le pass et le prsent tait parfaite - ce qui nest jamais le cas  lanticipation du futur comporterait encore une part dincertitude. Les conditions pratiques de laction stratgique, celle qui porte non sur lexcution des taches mais sur leur conception, sur le positionnement de lentreprise, sont donc celles que dcrit le modle de Clausewitz. Le modle de Jomini conforte la confiance en soi du professionnel, mais si celui-ci lapplique aux vnements externes il prend le risque de se trouver dsarm devant limprvu.|`|cbc57ee380ac2ae68cd6175627c1bce9aa	Les lois de la robotique et de l'informatique sont seulement mues pas une rponse simple : oui ou non, 0 ou 1...

Rosalie Lillian Hale is the adopted daughter of Esme and Carlisle, adoptive sister of Edward, Alice, and Jasper, and wife of Emmett. Her physical age is 18, and she was born in 1915 in Rochester, New York, as the daughter of a banker. Rosalie is described as being the most beautiful person in the world, even for a vampire; she is tall, statuesque, and has long, wavy blonde hair. As a human, Rosalie was described as a woman who had beauty, elegance, class, and eyes resembling violets. Royce King II took an interest in her and soon the two became engaged. Rosalie was extremely envious of her good friend Vera and her baby boy and, while on a visit, noticed that she did not share the same relationship with Royce as Vera did with her husband. Dismissing it, Rosalie later walked home and met an intoxicated Royce and his friends. Royce bragged about his fiance's beauty, leading to her being beaten, presumably raped, and left to die. Carlisle, coming across her, decided to change her into a vampire.     Emmett Cullen (born Emmett McCarty[4]) is Rosalie's husband, Carlisle and Esme's adopted son, and Edward, Alice, and Jasper's adoptive brother. Emmett is described as being tall, burly, extremely muscular, and, to most humans, the most intimidating of his adoptive siblings. He has slightly curly dark hair and dimpled cheeks.    Emmett was 20 and living in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in 1935 when he was mauled by a bear. The injuries from the attack were severe and he was found by Rosalie, who had been hunting in the area at the time. Rosalie, who was reminded of her friend's baby having the same curls, dimples, and innocent appearance, carried him over a hundred miles to Appalachia where Carlisle Cullen was, asking him to spare Emmett's life by turning him into a vampire.|`|g4fRPhsMaa	Rosalie and Emmett.

By the 3rd book Eclipse both Edward and Jacob want Bella. By Breaking Dawn she chooses Edward.|`|fCLW9woNaa	Rosalie and Emmett. Their relationship is described as very physical. They get married again every once in a while. They are the beauty and the muscleman. Emmett follows Rosalie and does what she wants. Even though he doesnt dislike Bella, if Rosalie isnt down with Bella, he isnt either. Later on Emmett becomes like an older adopted brother to Bella teasing her and Rosalie becomes more friendly in Breaking Dawn.  Rosalie and Emmettt are tough to explain and you can really only grasp their relationship if you know their backstories and read the books, but i hope i helped a bit. :) you should definitely read the books. they are amazing.
TPBDESp5aa	I think part of the reason so many girls love Edward is because he still has those chivalrous manners that you don't see so much these days. He's extremely polite and listens to what Bella has to say. Basically he is respectful of her.  Also, if Bella really wants something, and he doesn't see it being harmful to her, he lets her have it.

ACTlFjBWaa	Louis XIV (baptised as Louis Dieudonn, "Louis God-given") (5 September 1638  1 September 1715) ruled as King of France and of Navarre. He ascended to the throne a few months before his fifth birthday, but did not assume actual personal control of the government until the death of his prime minister (Premier ministre), the Italian Jules Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661.[1] Louis remained on the throne till his death just before his seventy-seventh birthday in 1715. He reigned for seventy-two years, three months, and eighteen days, the longest documented for any European monarch to date.[2]    He was known as Louis the Great (in French Louis le Grand or, alternatively, le Grand Monarque, "the Great Monarch"), because, following his initial success in the Franco-Dutch War and the Treaty of Nijmegen, the Parlement de Paris decreed that all public inscriptions and statues of the king should carry that epithet attached to his name.[citation needed]    Louis XIV is also popularly known as the Sun King (French: le Roi Soleil) because of the idea that, just as the planets revolve around the Sun, so too should France and the court revolve around him. As a result, he was commonly associated with Apollo Helios, the Greco-Roman god of the Sun. As a patron of the arts, this association was fitting because Louis was, like Apollo Musagetes, the "leader of the Muses".[citation needed] Largely due to his tutor, Bishop Jacques-Bnigne Bossuet, Louis believed in the Divine Right of Kings. Bossuet preached that kings were appointed by God, but also had a responsibility to act as such.    For much of Louis's reign, France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major warsthe Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Successionand two minor conflictsthe War of Devolution, and the War of the Reunions. Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include Cardinal Mazarin, Nicolas Fouquet, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Michel Le Tellier, Le Tellier's son Louvois, le Grand Cond, Turenne, Vauban, Villars and Tourville. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including Molire, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Lully, Le Brun, Rigaud, Louis Le Vau, Jules Hardouin Mansart, Claude Perrault and Le N?tre.    Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessors to create a centralized state governed from the capital in order to sweep away the remnants of feudalism which had persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which rose in revolt during his minority, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish Palace of Versailles. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal absolute monarch of early modern Europe. The phrase "L'tat, c'est moi" ("I am the state") is frequently attributed to him, though considered an inaccuracy by historians.[citation needed] Quite contrary to that apocryphal quote, Louis is actually reported to have said on his death bed: "Je m'en vais, mais l'tat demeurera toujours." ("I depart, but the State shall always remain").[3]|`|xm441ADLaa	The Sun King.   Is Google not working today?|`|gqiQB89Oaa	I think he lost his head because the queen ate all the cake...  or she let some people eat cake...|`|9uYSiaPcaa	King of france.|`|ezDrtxSdaa	Louis XIV was the absolutist monarch of France during the 1600's. He engaged France in a series of costly wars that expanded the nation both in Europe and across the seas, but left her with a large debt. He was a follower of the school of Mercantilism where the nation relied on itself for trade (a nation's colonies provided the raw materials and the home nation made refined good that they sold and tried to gain as much gold as possible). New France grew greatly in the New World at the time, and the Louisiana Territory was named after him. Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin helped him run the country, and he preserved his absolute authority through a system of informants called intendents that were throughout the country. He was a very strong leader and is famous for his quote "I am the state."

FAVORITE BOOKS EVER!!!!!???    lol  hope i helped!!!
vFB2HXpCaa	Yes, it was Boo Radley who killed Bob Ewell.    Heck Tate was telling Atticus that Bob killed himself because Heck also realized that Boo didn't belong in the limelight so just to make sure no 'publicity' started on Boo, he would end things right there.|`|c0e54f1c710307980fe8e11a79599649aa	Boo Radley killed Bob Ewell with the kitchen knife.   In order to protect Boo, who saved the kids' lives, Tate told the Finches that Bob fell on this, his 'own' knife, though in reality that was the clasp knife Heck claims he took from a vagrant.  The whole thing ties in with the notion of creative 'compromise', as with Scout not telling the teacher she is reading in her own time, and with the general religious idea of the letter kiling and the spirit giving life.|`|4sxd8wbqaa	To Kill a Mockingbird by  Harper Lee    Student Study Guides:    These links will give you a summary of the book, character analysis, plot and much more, so that you will be able to answer literary questions.     http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/|`|0f7a3885389cd1cf823b981668a4eaa0aa	boo radley killed mr. ewell but Heck Tate didnt noe so he just said that he killed himself.|`|OoyAyNxraa	Well, Ive read the book and seen the play, so i would have to say that his death was a huge accedent.

You might want to ask your teacher though, just in case.|`|91ea82679983a653edb6c30b11999fb2aa	Boo Radly  did kill Bob  Ewell with a kitchen knife I don't know if it was Boo or  Bob Ewell brought the killing knife into the situation.  He was protecting the children and himself.    Heck Tate said it was an accident so that neither Boo nor Jem would be brought to trial over it.  Because dragging boo through that would  kill him  both figarativly and  litterally.  So since Bob Ewell was no loss to the world.  It was better his death was seen as an acident.    Also perhaps saving his kids the shame of knowledge that their father attacked & tried to kill 2  children  better to have him drunk, clumsy & fall on his knife.

JkHdGCqeaa	I've also recently finished reading Battle Royale and I definitely have to agree with you that is surpasses the interest I've ever had in ANY book.<br>  <br>  There is a book that I've also read recently that is in about the same "genre."<br>  <br>  It is called Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, altho it is a YA book, I thought it was FANTASTIC. If you end up liking this book it apart of a trilogy which will keep you reading longer, which is always a plus (:<br>  <br>  About the overrated books, besides Eragon, those two books are actually quite well written, thought provoking, and entertaining.

Il est le dernier des trois fils de Sophie Trbuchet (17721821) et de Joseph Lopold Sigisbert Hugo (17731828). Ses grands frres taient Abel Joseph Hugo (17981855) et Eugne Hugo (18001837). De frquents sjours  Naples et en Espagne,  la suite de son pre, gnral de Napolon, marqueront ses premires annes. Vers 1813, il sinstalle  Paris avec sa mre qui sest spare de son mari, car elle entretient une liaison avec le gnral d'empire Victor Fanneau de la Horie. Elle dispense  son fils une ducation assez libre avec l'aide de Fanneau de la Horie, son parrain et prcepteur, qui accorde une grande place  toutes les formes de lecture. ?g de quatorze ans  peine, Victor, en juillet 1816, note sur un journal : ? Je veux tre Chateaubriand ou rien ?[1] Sa vocation est prcoce et ses ambitions sont immenses.    Avec ses frres Abel et Eugne, il fonde en 1819 une revue, le Conservateur littraire, qui attire dj l'attention sur son talent. La mme anne, il remporte le concours de l'Acadmie des Jeux floraux (voir Clmence Isaure). Deux fois laurat (1819 et 1820), galement prim par lacadmie, Victor Hugo dlaisse les mathmatiques, pour lesquelles il a un go?t marqu (il suit les cours des classes prparatoires), et embrasse la carrire littraire. Son premier recueil de pomes, Odes, para?t en 1821 : il a alors dix-neuf ans et ses tudes au lyce Louis-le-Grand lui permettent de faire conna?tre rapidement cet ouvrage. Il participe aux runions du Cnacle de Charles Nodier  la Bibliothque de l'Arsenal, berceau du Romantisme, qui auront une grande influence sur son dveloppement. Ds cette poque, Hugo est tout  la fois pote, romancier, dramaturge et mme journaliste : Hugo entreprend tout et russit beaucoup.       Le jeune crivain  [modifier]     Victor Hugo jeune hommeCest avec Cromwell, publi en 1827, quil fera clat. Dans la prface de ce drame, il soppose aux conventions classiques, en particulier  lunit de temps et  lunit de lieu. Il met vritablement en pratique ses thories dans la pice Hernani. Cette ?uvre est la cause dun affrontement littraire fondateur entre anciens et modernes, ces derniers, au premier rang desquels Thophile Gautier, senthousiasmant pour cette ?uvre romantique  combat qui restera dans lhistoire de la littrature sous le nom de ? bataille dHernani. ? Ds lors, la production dHugo ne conna?t plus de limites : romans (Notre-Dame de Paris, 1831) ; posie (Les Chants du crpuscule, 1835) ; thatre (Ruy Blas, 1838).    De 1826  1837, il sjourne frquemment au Chateau des Roches  Bivres, proprit de Bertin l'A?n, directeur du Journal des dbats.

Fils d'un gnral de Napolon, il suivit d'abord son pre dans le hasard des expditions et des campagnes, en Italie, en Espagne, o il fut page du roi Joseph et lve au sminaire des nobles de Madrid. Vers l'age de onze ans, il vint s'tablir avec sa mre, spare  cette poque du gnral,  Paris, dans le quartier, presque dsert alors, du Val-de-Grace. C'est l qu'il grandit dans une libert d'esprit et de lectures absolue, sous les yeux d'une mre extrmement indulgente et assez insoucieuse  l'endroit de l'ducation. Il s'leva tout seul, lut beaucoup, au hasard, s'prit, ds quinze ans,  la fois de vers et de mathmatiques, se prparant  l'cole polytechnique et concourant aux Jeux floraux.    Couronn deux fois par cette socit littraire, nomm par elle ma?tre s jeux floraux en1820, distingu par l'Acadmie fran?aise en 1817,  l'age de quinze ans, pour une pice sur les Avantages de l'tude, s'essayant  une tragdie (Irtamne dont on trouve quelques fragments dans Littrature et Philosophie mlees), il comprit que sa vocation tait toute littraire, abandonna les mathmatiques, et lan?a en 1822 les Odes. Il obtint une pension de 2 000 francs de Louis XVIII, peut-tre pour son livre, peut-tre pour un trait de gnrosit dont le Roi fut touch ; il se maria (1822), et ne songea plus qu' marcher sur les traces de Lamartine, qui tait l'idole du jour.    Journaux (Le Conservateur littraire), romans (Bug-Jargal, Han d'Islande), thatre (Amy Robsart avec Ancelot,  l'Odon, chute), vers (Ballades et nouveaux recueils d'Odes) l'occupent jusqu'en 1827. A cette date, il donne Cromwell, grand drame en vers (non jou), avec une prface qui est un manifeste. En 1828 il crit Marion de Lorme, drame en vers, qui est interdit par la censure, en 1829 les Orientales, en 1830 Hernani, jou  la Comdie fran?aise, acclam par la jeunesse littraire du temps, peu go?t du public.     La Rvolution de 1830 donne la libert  Marion de Lorme, qui est joue  la Porte Saint-Martin avec un assez grand succs.  Ds lors Victor Hugo se multiplie en crations. Les recueils de vers et les drames se succdent rapidement. En librairie, c'est Notre-Dame de Paris, roman (1831), Littrature et philosophie mles (1834), Feuilles d'automne, posies (1831), Chants du crpuscule, posies (1835), Voix intrieures, posies (1837), Rayons et Ombres, posies (1840), Le Rhin, impressions de voyage (1842).  Au thatre, c'est Le Roi s'amuse, en vers (1839), reprsent une fois, puis interdit sous prtexte d'allusion politique, Lucrce Borgia, en prose (1833), Marie Tudor, en prose (1833), Angelo, en prose (1835), Ruy Blas, en vers (1838), les Burgraves, en vers (1843).    En 1841 il avait t lu de l'Acadmie fran?aise, aprs un premier chec. En 1845 il fut nomm pair de France. En 1848 il fut lu dput de Paris  l'Assemble Constituante, fonda le journal l'Evnement pour prparer sa candidature  la Prsidence de la Rpublique, et devint un personnage politique. A la Constituante, il sigea parmi la droite et vota ordinairement avec elle.    Peu soutenu dans sa candidature  la Prsidence, mais rlu dput de Paris, il sigea  gauche  l'Assemble lgislative, se marqua nergiquement comme anti-clrical (Loi sur l'enseignement) et inclina peu  peu vers le groupe socialiste.  Au 2 dcembre 1851 il se mla au mouvement de rsistance, et dut prendre la route de l'exil.     Il se retira en Belgique, puis  Jersey, puis  Guernesey, refusa de bnficier des amnisties, et ne rentra en France qu'en 1870. Pendant son sjour  l'tranger, il publia Napolon le Petit, et crivit l'Histoire d'un crime, pamphlets politiques en prose, Les Chatiments (1853), satires en vers contre les hommes de l'Empire, Les Contemplations, posies (1856), la premire Lgende des Sicles (1859), Les Misrables, roman (1862), William Shakespeare, tude critique (1864), Les Travailleurs de la mer, roman (1866), Les Chansons des rues et des bois, posies (1865), etc.    Revenu  Paris sous la troisime rpublique, il vit le sige de 1870 et la guerre civile de 1871, qui lui inspirrent l'Anne terrible, posies (1872). il donna encore la deuxime Lgendes des Sicles, posies (1877), l'Art d'tre Grand-Pre, posies (1877), la troisime Lgende des Sicles, posies (1881), les Quatre vents de l'esprit, posies (1882).  Il avait t nomm snateur par le collge lectoral de Paris en 1876. Il parla peu. Il vota constamment avec la gauche. Ses opinions politiques d'alors taient reprsentes par le journal Le Rappel, fond vers la fin de l'Empire par ses parents et allis.   Il mourut le 22 mai 1885, ? dans la saison des roses ?, comme il l'avait prdit quinze annes auparavant,  l'age de 83 ans, comme Goethe. Son corps fut dpos au Panthon, aprs les funrailles les plus magnifiques que la France ait vues depuis Mirabeau. Il a laiss une grande quantit d'?uvres indites qui para?tront successivement. En 1886 on en a donn deux, le Thatre en Libert, et la Fin de Satan, qui n'ont rien ?t  sa gloire.|`|5503f10b320098a9225487b624007c96aa	J'ai lu 2 biographies de Victor Hugo.

l1VZkkOSaa	"The earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a tablet from the reign of Sargon of Akkad, dating back to the 23rd century BC."    "The city of Babylon obtained hegemony (dominance) over Mesopotamia under its sixth ruler, Hammurabi (fl. ca. 1728  1686 BC)."    "The fall of Babylon is taken as a fixed point in the discussion of the chronology of the Ancient Near East. Suggestions for its precise date vary by as much as 150 years, corresponding to the uncertainty regarding the length of the "Dark Age" of the ensuing Bronze Age collapse, resulting in the shift of the entire Bronze Age chronology of Mesopotamia with regard to the chronology of Ancient Egypt. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are:    ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC   short chronology: 1531 BC   middle chronology: 1595 BC   long chronology: 1651 BC "

Sorrow, sadness, sulking, all of those feelings which we cling onto in order to feel something more, or for whatever reason. They are feelings which some understand to be a part of us, but which actually destroys our perception, our love, our reality, which eats us up from the inside and makes us hate, makes us withdrawn, without love and without the ability to love. I don't mean just love people, I mean love life.  These are feeling which in my opinion we have control over, which we can let go of. Whether you have lost someone dear to you, you are addicted to drugs, you are abused, you have been raped, you are ugly, fat, you are not loved, you don't love yourself, you are poor, etc. These are not the greatest sorrows. The greatest sorrow is what these things turn you into if you allow your sorrow to control you.   What is the greatest antithisis or sorrow?

This happened in December 1941.  The war had been going since September 1939 when Britain and France were the only two countries courageous enough to oppose Hitler's invasion of Poland.  France was beaten in 1940 but Britain was not and the Soviet Union became allied with Britain when Hitler attacked them in June 1941.  So the USA was the last one to join in but until December 1941 they were happy to trade with both sides and made a lot of money.  |`|R3HjDrRJaa	japan attacked us and they were part of the axis so...|`|sj3s4obcaa	Before Japan attacked the US, the US was sympathetic to the British while they were being bombed by Germany.

Cest la raison qui explique pourquoi, quelle que soit lendroit du ciel que vous observiez, le ciel vous para?t bleu. On peut donc en conclure que sur un astre dpourvu d'atmosphre comme la Lune, la lumire ne sera pas diffuse et tous les rayonnements se propageront en ligne droite jusqu'au sol.

So with that mind set, we had to spread pro-American democracy to as many countries as possible to prevent them form becoming pro-Soviet communist states.     Both the NATO and the Warsaw Pact were formed as military alliances to further this division. It did lead to an arms race that ulitmately bankrupted the Soviet Union and ended the cold war.     As nuclear technology got more advanced the problem of total destruction of all life on the planet became a real fear... and the escalating struggle between democracy and communism would eventually lead to the end of civilization.     The main players were the US, Western Europe (Germant, Fance, Britain, etc) and Japan on the capitalist democracy side and Russia (Soviet Union), China and Eastern Europe (Poland, East Germany, etc) on the communist socialist states side.

As is said, a picture is worth a thousand words. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h1567...|`|4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	I found this on wiki....    "The Indian Removal Act part of a U.S. government policy known as Indian Removal, was signed into law by President Andrew Jackson on May 28, 1830. The Removal Act was strongly supported in the South, where states were eager to gain access to lands inhabited by the "Five Civilized Tribes"The treaties enacted under the provisions of the Removal Act paved the way for the reluctantand often forcibleemigration of tens of thousands of American Indians to the West..    Hope it helps!    Dan

zGgEVAbraa	what i did was i went to google and typed in "dance studios in ********, **" and it gave the three dance studios in my small town:-) and so if the dance studios in your area have websites (which they should) they should come up and they usually will either have a list of classes and a price or a phone number you can call and choose the cheapest place. but usually the cheaper place isnt as good. and some places have scholorships that you can apply for to take some classes.       dancing is alot of fun and i hope you can take it:-) but i also take ballet class with your other class because ballet helps with ALL TYPES OF DANCE! even hip hop. most people at my studio dont take ballet and they SUCK! but the people who take ballet are good in all types, jazz, hip hop, tap, lyrical, etc. it helps with balance, strength, flexibility|`|4cfad72d9681ff8bba1e815806a91bd7aa	THEY NOT CHEAP.|`|mc6Aa31haa	If you are serious about pursuing dance, i would start with ballet, as it is the most technical of the dance forms. While they all are difficult and require alot of technique, most colleges only offer ballet programs. Ballet will also help you build muscles, and it's terms are used widely in each form of dance.|`|U5qQfrbAaa	Is your question where you could find cheap dance lessons?  It depends on where you live.  I would ask people that go to your school or live in your general neighborhood, asking them what the monthly/yearly price is for their lessons and costume price, and then decide.  The cheapest place by me is 33$ a month per class.  I go to a center where it is 40$ a month per class. I take four classes a week.  They are not cheap.|`|9gtkMokKaa	I took dance class before, and it was jazz. if youre age 10 or under, its good to start in jazz, it teaches you all of the basics, but if youre 11 or over, i would do hip hop., it lets you make the dance your own because theres not one "right" way to do it. i find hiphop so much more fun than jazz. it all depends on you though. do you want to do jazz, ballet, hiphop, lyrical, baton, etc? choose somthing you wont get bored with easily.    but make sure iuts REALLY what you want to do. its a big commitment.|`|OrPaxoVZaa	First of all, you should definitely start with ballet. You need ballet to take jazz or contemporary. And classes aren't exactly cheap.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a><br>  <br>  If you want better than a P&S, you'll need to save up for a DSLR - and they are in a different league, of course.

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted.  You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.     Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.     Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.     A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	the "core" of genealogy is records and documents. If you REALLY REALLY are serious about finding the info, you won't limit yourself to what is online, and what is free. It just does not work like that.   To start with, there are some basic rules.. ie, start with you, and work back. Use your birth certificate as the first document (yes.. even though you know who your parents are). GET INTO THE HABIT of always finding a record. You will get to the point where no one has the answer, and by doing it with records, you will find more.   But, records of live persons are not online and should not be. "Recent" records are restricted to a point for privacy and security reasons. If you are in the US, 1930 is the latest census open for research, but you normally can reach that, quickly. UK has different dates.   WHO, WHEN, WHERE, are the questions. What will be used for grandma Smith who died in 1982 in Florida, will be totally different from 5 gr grandfather Jones who died in Mass. in 1743. Knowing what you are looking for (not just "info" about my relatives) is the key to finding what is needed.   This does not mean that the internet is useless, far from it.  Ancestry.com has ALL census records but it is a service, and reasonable to pay. Other sites have random censuses.. you might luck out, might not.   There are thousands of genealogy sites, but which will "work" depends on who your ancestor was, and when. One site I offer all the time is the tutorial at www.rootsweb.com.  It helps explain how to get going. Once you are going, you always have folks here to be more explicit.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	ancestry.com is a good place if you are really serious about researching.  But it isn't free.

Es hermoso que te llamen princesa. Eso es se?al de que quien as te llama, te ha entronizado en su corazn. Es tener la seguridad de que para alguien eres una princesa. ?Claro que es un nombre seductor! ?Claro que es halagador! Por eso sigue llevndose desde hace casi tres mil a?os; y mientras se conozca su valor, no desaparecer. Seguir siendo el nombre de las que han sido elegidas por el destino para ser princesas de corazones.    Santa Sara es una abadesa de principios del siglo IV, durante el reinado de Teodosio el Menor, que rigi su monasterio situado en la regin de Libia llamada Sokhit Hmamou, en griego nitriothV nwmoV / nitriotes nmos (regin de la sosa). Las fuentes de la poca destacan la virtud de la abadesa Sara, que llev la comunidad que gobernaba a uno de sus momentos de mayor esplendor. Recuerda el santoral romano otras dos Saras que merecieron el honor de los altares, por lo que pueden las que llevan este nombre celebrar su onomstica el 13 de julio, o bien el 12 de septiembre o el 9 de octubre.    Pero es de Sara, la mujer del patriarca Abraham, de donde proviene la grandeza de este nombre. En un pueblo de estructura patriarcal como lo son todos los que forman nuestro tejido cultural, el simple hecho de que la historia se ocupe de una mujer, es se?al de la enorme relevancia que sta tiene en la construccin de su pueblo. Es el caso de Sara, esposa de Abraham, mujer de belleza legendaria. Dos episodios de su vida confirman el irresistible atractivo de Sara. Primero fue en Egipto, donde el Faran mand incorporarla a su harn, convencido de que era la hermana, y no la esposa de Abraham. Colm de dones a Abraham: le regal "ovejas y ganado vacuno y esclavos y esclavas y asnas y camellos" (Gn. 12, 16). Cuando se enter el faran por las calamidades que Dios le mand, de que Sara era intocable por ser la mujer de Abraham, los despidi a ambos con todo cuanto les haba regalado. Volvi Abraham a las andadas con Abimelec, rey de Gerara: tambin ste hizo llevar a Sara a su palacio, convencido de que era la hermana de aquel gran jeque que se haba instalado como extranjero en su territorio. Abimelec tuvo una premonicin en sue?os. Dios le dijo que devolviese a Sara, y as lo hizo. Pero fue la maternidad de Sara, en competencia con la de su esclava Agar, lo que marc su vida. Un da que estaban peleando el hijo de sta, Ismael, con su propio hijo, Isaac, decidi que aunque ambos fuesen hijos del mismo padre, tenan que seguir caminos distintos. Y de este modo se deshizo de la esclava y de su hijo, quedando ella como nica mujer de Abraham, y su hijo como nico heredero.    La historia de Sara nos rebela que fue una gran mujer no slo por su belleza, sino tambin por su carcter y por su gran habilidad en el manejo de situaciones altamente conflictivas. Las Saras tienen en ella un espejo que no ha perdido el brillo a pesar del paso de los siglos. Su nombre fue una premonicin de lo que fue su vida. Es lo que tienen derecho a esperar las Saras. ?Felicidades, princesa|`|911374944db4b5d6de121f4a0f9bcc47aa	Silvia - La que sonre-De la selva.|`|e6d85d076cc8959e1c832e6622aa734faa	Laura: laurel signo de triunfo...su origen es latino y me parece femenino y personal.|`|ba1742dbc71f7d4ad58266d35df95e85aa	Estigia:  Es la laguna por la que pasaban las almas de los que iban al infierno, segn la mitologa griega.

eadd82811eb6093ac993b05dff54a9d0aa	Nel 1738, a Parigi, in condizioni disagiate, nasce Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Fin da bambino, dotato di un olfatto molto sviluppato, Jean-Baptiste va alla ricerca di tutti gli odori del mondo. Una volta cresciuto, lavora nel negozio del profumiere Baldini, dove apprende tutti i segreti delle spezie e delle essenze. La sua ossessione, per, rimane quella di riuscire a distillare e conservare il profumo delle donne. Questo incubo lo far diventare un assassino.  Sottoforma di Kolossal europeo, Tom Tykwer, seguendo il romanzo di Sskind del 1985, immagina gli odori, i profumi con i frammenti di immagini, seguendo ci che dice Baldini, "Ogni profumo racchiude tre accordi. L'accordo di testa, di cuore e infine di base". Ogni volta che Jean-Baptiste annusa, odora, le sequenze si frammentano, fin dal momento della sua nascita. Il regista costruisce una visione di un mondo settecentesco, putrido e illibato, nauseante e profumato, senza tuttavia farci mai provare l'esperienza di annusare. I liquidi, i corpi, la pelle sono il modo in cui "Il profumo" si manifesta, e nello scorrere i 147 minuti di durata, alcuni tempi morti, anche per gli amanti del romanzo, risultano pesanti e infiniti, ma il finale illumina e l'orgia universale condita dalla colonna sonora sinfonica  una fotografia meravigliosa, sublime di cosa l'amore possa arrivare a rappresentare. L'imperfezione  dell'uomo, la violenza  del mondo. L'amore, invece, appartiene a ognuno di noi, che lo vive a modo proprio, anche quando il male prende il sopravvento.   questa  la trama del libro...  io lo letto  bello ho visto anche il film.....   piu bello il libro pero|`|e90d4d4195eb82fdf87d53f0b70fc437aa	Io ho visto solo il film ma sinceramente mi ha lasciato molto perplessa.

Dopo tutto questo parlare mi viene una domanda ..cos' la realt ? L'insieme dei fatti ?La conseguenza di verit-falsit ? L'effetto collaterale di una sentenza ?    Forse ci sono due realt : una per sopravvivere, quella "self made", nostra   e un'altra , quella che non chiede, ma che governa , silenziosa e inesorabile .      ciao|`|8f38c71520fe4cedf526371847421f32aa	La verita, e come le scoperte scientifiche.......rimane tale sino a che non viene confutata dai fatti      __________    fatto!!! fa' male veramente!!!! :(|`|6e30948d174d2f4b65c4c4d331b3ba96aa	sino a che non ti colgono con le mani nel sacco  Verit e Falsit sono indifferenti per costruire una realt da dare a bere ad altri    che ci vuoi fare ,ci sono un sacco di creduloni in giro..  maldicenza e pregiudizio si alimentano di realt in scatola|`|9rWrsWvlaa	la verit ha mille facce  e le bugie ha le gambe corte    sta a noi decidere da che parte stare o guardare    poi la mia lellina ha detto tutto in altri campi  hahahahaha    bacetto fratello predicatore|`|IhQQyKbJaa	Non sono indifferenti poich entrambe, per ognuno di noi, assumono connotati diversi.

Tutta la realt pu essere manipolata a piacere!I telegiornali diffondono notizie eclatanti di cronaca nera.Se ogni giorno una madre sgozza il figlio,noi che subiamo il tg,siamo portati a credere che quella sia la realt ineluttabile e che tutte le madri abbiano il complesso di Medea(permettimi la citazione classica),che i rumeni al volante sono sempre ubriachi e che ammazzeranno o violenteranno qualcuno,perch le tante madri che amano i figli non fanno notizia e i rumeni onesti e buoni sono gente ordinaria.I media manipolano a loro piacere le notizie e anche le nostre menti,dato che loro sono la nostra(e spesso unica) finestra su realt che non ci appartengono direttamente.

Poi, a livello filosofico, non si pu dare una risposta definitiva alla tua domanda - almeno, io non sono in grado di farlo -  perch la verit non  unica, ha mille sfaccettature. Solo in campo scientifico, credo, si parla di verit confutate dai fatti (laboratorio, ricerca scientifica, ricerca sperimentale) che potranno essere superate da verit future.

La nostra, in effetti,  1 realt virtuale. A questo punto, t debbo dire, ke nn  per niente assurdo xk noi "lo sappiamo" e ce ne rendiamo conto ke la nostra vera vita, se l'avremo meritata, nn  questa ma in 1 dimensione + celestiale. Purtroppo, al giorno d'oggi, esistono veramente alcune "anomalie" ad  esempio fantasmi, eventi paranormali ecc, ke nn sono altro ke dei "tarli" nn "bachi" di un certo progetto divino ke nn fanno altro ke rovinarlo. Io ne sono certo. Ke dici tu la tieni questa certezza, cio c' questa possibilit?

Lascio ad altri quest'onere.   Io esprimo apertamente un mio giudizio, posso essere d'accordo su una cosa che dici, come non esserlo..Posso rispondere a tono ad una tua provocazione oltre misura con la stessa disinvoltura con cui l'hai fatto tu. Quando uno si incazza o si prende gioco di qualcuno non sta troppo a badare a quello che dice e come lo dice e se c' gente ultrasensibile o che fa finta di offendersi ad una risposta puramente dettata dall'emotivit del momento, perch istigati a farlo, beh...allora quelle persone imparino prima a guardarsi dentro e poi forse potranno insegnare agli altri a non essere volgari quando non bisogna esserlo.   Si d il caso che proprio chi ostenta un linguaggio affettato, moderato e che dice di non sopportare la volgarit altrui, in luoghi dove questa  bandita dall'etica professionale o per il quieto vivere sfoga poi nel peggiore dei modi, queste frustrazioni sociali in rete, in chat, e tra amici. Ma finch sei tu che ti sfoghi  tutto lecito, quando  qualcun altro che non sei tu, a farlo, allora scatta l'allarme del finto scandalo. Niente di pi ipocrita!!    Io, ad esempio, non sono uno che si incazza molto facilmente perch sono una brava persona e ho il sorriso per tutti, lascio parlare tutti e rispetto anche le idee estreme di alcune persone..proprio perch so che  lecito per tutti uno sfogo personale e se si cade nella volgarit  spesso pi per togliersi i sassolini dalle scarpe, di una giornata stressante, in cui devi saper dimostrare di essere una persona civile. Poi, finito lo sfogo, si ritorna ad essere composti, e quasi neanche ci si ricorda pi cosa si  detto prima...o ci si ride su.   Ma se burlarsi di qualcuno, parlare senza tab di un dato argomento (mettiamo il caso del sesso...), fare un'esclamazione un po' colorita per dare enfasi a ci che si sta dicendo, mette sull'attenti alcune persone molto suscettibili e "raffinate" e vieni etichettato come maniaco, sfigato, perdente, insulso...allora qui il discorso va ben oltre la volgarit. Perch anche chi ti giudica, futilmente, maniaco o sfigato, ha espresso una forma di linguaggio volgare. Che tu dia o no importanza alla cosa, questa  la realt.|`|4ca34b8f09a03da6fa1900c5d9d56cf0aa	pudore, educazione, pulizia...|`|ea126890ee035dad9426c818ee874651aa	essere fini|`|023078d0136c30c4912db4da2c069b40aa	SIGNORILITA'  FINEZZA  EDUCAZIONE  RISPETTO PER GLI ALTRI...

gb9w3vkzaa	cara specchio, ho cercato il libro , l'ho trovato ed ecco come amo sentir parlare di me come donna:    "Quella donna  una casa segreta.  Nei suoi meandri, conserva voci e nasconde fantasmi.  Nelle notti d'inverno, riscalda.  Chi entra in lei, dicono, non esce mai pi.  Io attraverso il profondo fossato che la circonda.  In quella casa verr abitato.   In lei mi aspetta il vino che mi berr.  Molto dolcemente busso alla porta e aspetto."    E' dell'uruguaiano Eduardo Galeano, nonostante il testo perda un po' musicalit nella traduzione io la trovo stupenda, intensa, misteriosa, sensuale, materna...mi d un brivido, lo ammetto.|`|hEbIF92uaa	ahhhhhhh le donne!  le donne sono il nostro nettare ,la nostra acqua,la nostra aria,  le donne ci fanno sognare ,arrabbiare,volare.

Il mio corpo di contadino selvaggio ti scava  e fa saltare il figlio dal fondo della terra.  Sono stato solo come una galleria. Da me fuggivano gli uccelli  e in me la notte entrava con la sua invasione possente.  Per sopravvivermi ti ho forgiata come un'arma,  come una freccia al mio arco, come una pietra nella mia fionda.  Ma cade l'ora della vendetta, e ti amo.  Corpo di pelle, di muschio, di latte avido e fermo.  Ah le coppe del petto! Ah gli occhi dell'assenza!  Ah la rosa del pube! Ah la tua voce lenta e triste!  Corpo di donna mia, persister nella tua grazia.  La mia sete, la mia ansia senza limite, la mia strada indecisa!  Oscuri fiumi dove la sete eterna continua,  e la fatica continua, e il dolore infinito.      ciao|`|jGZqyYBbaa	" Si ama solo ci che non si possiede del tutto"  M. Proust    Ci sono poesie che ne mettono in risalto la tragicit, altre che ne mettono in risalto la pena, altre ancora la gioia e il piacere ecc...:  a me piacciono tutte indistintamente; sono punti di vista dovuti al/ai sentimento/i di un poeta-uomo, di fronte a un donna che pu essere irraggiungibile (come la "donna angelo"), o fonte di timore e paure (classiche di noi uomini) o entrambe (e tant'altro!). Da qui la difficile scelta.      Tuttavia, la poesia che vorrei ricordare - in particolare per la sua singolarit -  quella del poeta crepuscolare Nino Oxilia dalla sua raccolta "Gli orti" intitolata "Aspettando una donna":    Arde il fuoco sugli alari  e il riflesso dipinge sui legni,  suoi cuoi, sulle stoffe, disegni  fantastici e vari  nell'oscurit.  La fiamma si allunga, s'arrischia  nel buio, ricade, s'adagia,  si sfrangia sopra la bragia,  fischia,  sta.    Tic-Tac. Tic-tac. Ver-r.  Ver-r! Verr!     Tra un ora,  un p rossa e confusa,  comparir nel vano  dalla porta socchiusa.  Poich  la prima volta  io le dir "Signora...",  prendendole la mano  con aria disinvolta.  La prima volta! Ho lasciato  con qualche ipocrisia  sopra la scrivania  un foglio cominciato.  Io le dir: "Lei m'  sorpreso qu, tra i miei  versi..." Non creder,  ma finger anche lei.  "Non m'aspettava?"                               "Sa  temevo che il mistero,  le visite..."  "Dov' la stampa del Durero?"  "La stampa? Eccola qua"  "La guardo e scappo. Ho poco  tempo da restar qui".  Io le dir di s,  ma rattizzando il fuoco...    La fiamma si allunga, s'arrischia  nel buio, ricade, s'adagia,  si sfrangia sopra la bragia,  fischia...    Siederemo nell'ombra del divano  un poco discosti, parlando  nell'atto pi naturale.  Il riflesso del fuoco, a quando a quando  mi sveler l'ovale  puro del volto o il gesto della mano  e penser: "tra poco sar mia,  la bacier sui denti luccicanti,  sui denti lisciarelli..."  Invece le dir: "S, certi istanti,  ma il resto! Rete di malinconia,  contessa... Non toglie i guanti?  L'aiuto. Vuole?" E il fuoco sveler  i suoi capelli presso ai miei capelli  nell'atto d'aiutarla,  ed io vedendo i suoi occhi brillare  - umidi fiori nell'oscurit -  penser: "Se provassi a baciarla?  Ora la bacio". Ed ella penser:  "Si comincia, mi pare..."    La fiamma si allunga, s'arrischia  nel buio, ricade, s'adagia,  si sfrangia sopra la bragia...    Poi sulla molle pelle d'orso bianco  nuda la stender vicino al fuoco.  Godr nei lunghi baci a poco a poco  la gola, il seno, il fianco  nella penombra concessi...  Ella, tremando mi dir "mi piaci",  smarrita in un aureola di baci,  sperduta fra le spume dei riflessi;  poi si celer la faccia  pudica dentro al cerchio delle braccia  e nascosto il bel volto smarrito  si ecciter nel bivio cerebrale  dove converge il bacio sensuale  dell'amante, col gesto del marito.    La fiamma ricade, s'adagia  sfrangiandosi sopra la bragia...  Tic - tac  -  Tic - tac...    Penso. - Quanto pi onesto e pi sincero  poich le piaccio ed ella  mi piace, ritrovarci in una bella  mattinata di maggio pel sentiero  che reca al bosco e giunti al folto -- dico  sarebbe ben pi puro -- alla mia donna  rialzassi la gonna  con un gesto impudico,  e presala alle reni  la inchiodassi sull'erba  premendo sotto al mio petto l'acerba  grazia dei seni!  O purezza d'un buon gesto smarrito!  Saggezza delle favole d'Esopo!         .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .  Ma dopo,  quante pagliuzze in fondo al suo vestito!  ...Dopo, invece, la traccia  del mio possesso recente  cercher invano negli occhi di falco.  Ella ricomporr serenamente  i capelli a corona della faccia  e offrendomi nell'atto del commiato  il suo polso inguantato,  dir: "Stasera vado a Lorely.  Venga a trovarmi in palco.  Addio, chri. Good bye..."    La fiamma fischia, fischia...          Ciao!|`|5e8c06e7a1f5f152fe29b84d0a0904b3aa	Cosa sarebbe il mondo, senza le donne?  L'Olimpo senza Afrodite!  Che noia. ^_^

hiC5I9YRaa	Non metto orecchiette per segnare il punto, ma li uso, semplicemente.  Li annoto, sottolineo, li vivo insomma.  Calcola che ci sono libri che ho letto anche 10 volte (Doctor Faustus di Mann o il Faust di Goethe).|`|4cyML1ngaa	Dipende dal libro: se  di scuola allora sottolineo (rigorosamente a matita) e riporto annotazioni e commenti.  Se  solo di lettura allora sto bene attenta a non sciuparlo, non mi piace vedere i libri in disordine, tutti sgualciti e rovinati.  Se devo ritrovare un passaggio particolare di solito mi ricordo pi o meno a che punto  del libro e lo rileggo un pezzo.  Non ho mai scritto il mio nome sui libri perch sono gelosa, capita raramente che ne presti uno e accade solo con persone in cui ho molta fiducia.|`|230f75b0787f10ed433e6aa0629b6a9daa	Pensavo di essere maniaco ma vedo che c' chi lo  pi di me. Ecco come mi comporto io con un libro:  1) Dev'essere in perfetto stato se  nuovo e in buone condizioni se  usato.   2) Se  scontato tanto meglio, i libri che compro a pochi euro li leggo con maggior soddisfazione. Quindi frequento poco le librerie e molto i centri commerciali  3) Quando li leggo sto attento a non sgualcirli, specialmente la copertina. La cosa che pi odio , nell'edizione tascabile,  quando si piega la rilegatura in modo che quando li sfogli si aprono sempre allo stesso punto.  4) Se posso non li impresto mai a nessuno e non leggo libri imprestati.|`|iAtzySIGaa	io ho due categorie di libri:  quelli che porto al mare, sul bus, nel bagno, che posso "sporcare", prestare, mettere in borsa ecc...  e i cimeli  quelli che non presto a nessuno, che tratto con cura, che ripongo in libreria e che soprattutto non pasticcio...  il punto dove arrivo in entrambi i casi non lo segno, ma uso il classico "segna-libri".|`|hWFfGWTcaa	I miei libri sono immacolati, al massimo un po' sgualcita la costola... ma sono pieni di striscioline di carta che uso per tenere il segno di passi particolarmente belli e su cui annoto le mie impressioni...|`|nUTubwScaa	Benissimo, faccio attenzione alle orecchie sulle pagine, figurati le sottolineature!!!

Io li tratto con amore, rispetto e delicatezza . Quando mi trovo in  libreria e finalmente ho trovato il mio libro , lo tengo in mano come una conquista, me lo tengo stretto, stretto,lo sfoglio, impaziente di essere a casa , dove poi  me lo "coccolo" , lo guardo, tocco la carta, sento il suo odore e mi tuffo nelle sue parole.    ciaooo    p.s.: capita che  faccia delle orecchiette..lo so che nn va bene...ma ammetto che capita. Lascio sempre in un libro letto un ricordo, pu essere un ticket di bus, un biglietto d'entrata ad un museo, un nastro, uno scontrino, una foto,una cartolina, ecc. ,insomma sempre qualcosa che mi ricordi il periodo in cui l'ho letto.|`|X3W0kvBZaa	Alcuni miei libri sembrano nuovi, mai letti... altri lo sono veramente!|`|bnfX8fu7aa	Come dei figli...con estrema delicatezza, anche se mi piace viverli e se trovo qualche frase o espressione molto bella me la scrivo, anzich sottolinearla. Mi piace che i miei libri sembrino nuovi, anche dopo averli letti moltissime volte. Per tenere il segno mi sono fatta fare un segna libro con una citazione "la rosa che oggi sboccia domani appassir", non mi piacciono n le orecchie per tenere il segno n metterci la prima cosa che capita...lo so, sono maniacale...  Inoltre mi piace averne sempre uno con me, per leggerlo nei momenti di pausa, anche breve, io leggerei ovunque e sempre. Quando torno a casa la sera, anche se ho sonno da morire devo addormentarmi leggendo qualche pagina, non ne posso fare a meno.

Molti hanno ditate di nutella, segnalibri improvvisati, bigliettini, fiori, dediche. Qualcuno  macchiato di lacrime.  Nei libri in lingua originale ci sono le mie annotazioni di traduzione, a matita, cos quando li rileggo non devo andarmi a cercare di nuovo le parole sul dizionario.  Alcuni libri hanno gi le orecchie perch la mia bambina li sbircia. Uno mi  caduto nel bucato. L'ho messo ad asciugare insieme ai panni, con le mollette:  diventato un po' spaventapasseri, ondulato come un pezzetto di fiume, con i bozzi. Lo amo ancor di pi per questo.

ae233b7eaa6aea02dd72690736b2f265aa	L'amore non esiste. Quando lo si dece lo si definisce e molto spesso lo si confonde con QUALCOSA che si voluto .Tante volte  la ricerca di qualcosa , un PERCORSO  , delle volte  un' OGGETTO , tante volte  un'IDEA.  Il comune denominatore  il verbo -essere-.   L'essenza determina l'amore ,ma non  un'essenza del genere intangibile ,  un'essenza oggettiva , per questo finita , terminata , terminale , localizzata .   Io dico che l'amore non esiste , tuttavia ritengo che esiste l'amore  per l'amore e l'amore dell'amore.   Non esiste un'amore contrattualizzante o contrattualizzato . Chi sente l'amore per un'oggetto o per una persona , sente ("sente" se  stesso) la sua forza generatrice di emozioni , lo stupore dimostra qualcosa , ma non dimostra l'amore.  Non etichettiamo il sentimento pi o meno orientato , pertinente o non  , con l'amore.

Si dice che non esiste perch non  eterno e non dura tanto a lungo quanto si possa volere. Non finisce mai in simbiosi, ma uno dei due deve soffrire per la perdita dell'amore.  L'amore  solo complicit, la noia  il primo nemico dell'amore.   Il Mondo  bello perch  vario, a buon intenditore poche parole servono!|`|dZeXWZGeaa	Chi dice che l'amore non esiste o non lo ha mai provato oppure non  stato capace di riprendersi dopo un'esperienza non finita tanto bene. Purtroppo queste persone esistono e sono sempre di pi, gli scettici, gli immorali...ma sono convinto che la colpa sia interamente della societ: quella che strumentalizza, che costringe, che opprime i sentimenti e la spontaneit ma soprattutto che insegna a distruggere e non a procreare per la vita e per mantenere l'equilibrio universale.  Chi sostiene che l'amore  un'invenzione quindi, pu essere solamente accecato da questa realt apparente, non ha trovato la forza di rialzarsi, di guardarsi le spalle per poi capire errori e cause, non si  voltato verso il futuro camminando nel presente con la speranza di un mondo migliore, dove l'amore c' solo che  difficile da scovare nell'illusione umana.  Non  stato capace, non ha voluto, ha scelto la via pi semplice anche se pi distruttiva.

Le emozioni -che sono variazioni di potenziale elettrico tra alcuni neuroni del cervello, secondo quello che mi avevano spiegato anni fa -esistono, e sarebbero anche misurabili..    questo  -in due parole, scarse e forse poco precise -un parere, per cos dire, scientifico.    Io sono certo che l'amore esista, anche se non so come definirlo: a volte non sono per certo di una cosa..   fa bene?    prendiamo questa definizione data dal mio amico Hap:    L'amore c' c' fidati...  E' difficile da trovare ma quando lo scopri ti obnubila la mente, i sensi, il respiro, riempie ogni attimo della tua vita, ogni tua azione, ogni tuo pensiero...e ti fa capire che tutto il resto  di contorno, marginale..      secondo lui, l'amore  un quid che ti annebbia la mente, ti fa perdere il respiro e ti fa vedere come marginale qualsiasi cosa attorno a te.    se una tale definizione  realistica -e non ho dubbi che lo sia - e se l'amore fa questi effetti, lo definiremmo un quid positivo?    fa bene qualcosa che ha questi effetti? se la tua mente  annebbiata, tu non comprendi; e se io volessi approfittare di te, avrei buon gioco nel farlo...    quindi, da questo punto di vista, non direi che sia un bene.    Il discorso  molto complesso, perch ci si deve chiedere se e fino a quale livello le nostre emozioni ci apportino dei vantaggi,e se tali vantaggi superino gli eventuali svantaggi ad esse legati, e da esse causati..    Mi  davvero difficile dirlo. se lo desideri, e se non sono stato chiaro, posso eventualmente spiegarmi meglio, o almeno provarci.    Saluti.|`|felcUDgRaa	L'amore pu esistere quando nasce piano piano e va formandosi nel tempo,quando le due personalit si fondono assieme diventando un tutt'uno.Anche una grande amicizia pu essere paragonata all'amore,perch si basa su un rapporto di fiducia incondizionata nei confronti dell'altro.Gli altri tipi di innamoramento,cio quelli non dettati dall'esperienza dell'altro,ma da quello che l'altro ci appare,o che vorremmo fosse,non si pu definire amore ma  pi simile a una forma di impazzimento "buono",che non ti fa pi vedere la realt e la sostituisce con la realt della propria fantasia,con tutti i danni,a cominciare dalla psiche,e tutti gli altri di conseguenza che comporta.Diciamo che la maggior parte delle volte l'amore  uno scherzo del cervello,non basato su un motivo oggettivamente valido.A molti di voi sar capitato di pensare a quando eravate innamorati di una persona,e ripensandoci vi sembra quasi strano che vi siate innamorati di quel tipo o tipa.Potremmo dire che l'innamoramento  uno scompenso biochimico del cervello che non fa vedere bene la realt,e che quando finisce di solito lascia un senso di vuoto,proprio perch era basato sul nulla.Chi dice di non avere amore potrebbe essere rimasto molto deluso perch gli sono successe le cose che ho detto sopra.

uJBnZWtcaa	Bleach will prevent mold but you can't use the Ultra bleach because it has other things in it. You have to use regular bleach diluted with water. Spraying it with a bleach solution also means you're putting water on it because you have to dilute the bleach.  You might try sponging a solution of, oh, a 1/4 cup bleach in 4 cups of water just on those places you see the mold.  Don't get bleach on your clothes or in your eyes, etc.  Use standard safety procedures.    Easier....but it'll leave your artwork minty fresh:-)  Try mouthwash.  It's not as strong (or good) as bleach but it might work. It's also safer.    Also, window cleaner (like Windex) contains both alcohol and ammonia which mold doesn't like.    The stuff used to clean showers and tubs has chemicals in it to prevent mold so it might work, too.    Whatever you do about the mold, put your piece near moving air.  If you live where it's cold and the heat is on, put it near a register or stick it near the furnace.  If not, put a fan on it. Mold is growing because it's staying wet. You need to get it dry as soon as possible.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	wipe it off with water and detol(an antiseptic liquid) let it dry .  paint with emulsion pant.  hope this helps|`|TrOEFKikaa	I second the use of paint, or maybe varnish that will soak in-then you just need to scrape off the mold, get a really nasty oil based varnish on there!

The anti-Federalists codified in these amendments the protection of states rights, spelling out that any powers not granted explicitly to the Federal government were  granted and reserved to the states (and individuals).<br>  <br>  Property rights were carefully spelled out in the Constitution and there is much writings from the Founding Fathers about the concept of property.  The southern slave-owning states felt it important to guarantee the rights of state citizens to retain their 'property' - ie. slaves.|`|qC0qeZaXaa	The Virginia Plan and the New Jersey plan was a compromise between the large states and small states, not federalists and anti-federalists.<br>  <br>  The only reason that the anti-federalists ratified the Constitution was because they were promised that the bill of rights would be immediately added. That is why the bill of rights was, in fact, written almost immediately after the Constitution itself was ratified.<br>  <br>  Anti-federalists just wanted to make sure that the government didn't have all of the power.

ceBTTCPwaa	<a href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com</a><br>  <br>  Blacksad is a comic book series created by Spanish authors Juan Díaz Canales (writer) and Juanjo Guarnido (artist), and published by French publisher Dargaud. Though both authors are Spanish, their main target audience for Blacksad is the French market and thus they publish all Blacksad volumes in French first; the Spanish edition usually follows about one month later. The first volume Quelque part entre les ombres (literally Somewhere between the Shadows, but simply called Blacksad in the US) was published in November 2000. The second volume, Arctic-Nation, was published in 2003 and the third, ?me Rouge (Red Soul), was published in 2005. (An English translation has been delayed as of May 2007 due to the bankruptcy of its North American publisher, iBooks).<br>  <br>  Although it was the creators' first comics endeavour, the first volume was an immense success, selling more than 200,000 copies in France alone. The series has been translated from the original French and Spanish into Bulgarian, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Swedish and Taiwanese.
c43abcf478c36558125ffbfc8c630fd1aa	Il grande unico sublime,  Edgar Degas fu una delle figure centrali e pi feconde dell'Impressionismo, ma dal punto di vista sociale e artistico si distinse dagli altri appartenenti al movimento. Nato in una famiglia agiata e amante dell'arte non conobbe le difficolt incontrate agli inizi da Monet e Renoir; inoltre, si mostr poco interessato al paesaggio, tema prediletto dagli impressionisti, e prefer le scene d'interno, soprattutto con figure di ballerine, lavandaie e donne al bagno, mentre nella pittura all'aperto i soggetti pi ripetuti furono le corse dei cavalli. Negli ultimi anni, tuttavia, i problemi di vista da cui era affetto si aggravarono, portandolo quasi alla cecit. Degas fu consacrato fra i geni artistici dell'Ottocento, ma trascorse gli anni della vecchiaia in cupa solitudine .Poverino solo e dimenticato da tutti.

ksOW8Y4Aaa	Well, the exact definition of a Roman Villa is a bit vague, anything from a country home to an elaborate estate could be called a villa. And then there was inflation and regional variation, so I'm not really sure if you will be able to pin down anything like a typical price. I can only say that Villas of any type were most definitely something only the very well to do could afford, and their price was beyond what the vast majority of citizens could dream of affording. IE A villa would cost more than most Romans would make in their lifetimes.

jWscvsgVaa	Massacre - The deliberate and intentional killing of a large number of human beings, under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty, or contrary to "the usages established among civilized peoples"     Battle - Generally, a battle is a conceptual component in the hierarchy of combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, wherein each group will seek to defeat the others within the scope of a military campaign, and are well defined in duration, area and force commitment.    I would consider the Fetternan Massacre to be a massacre, even though it has some elements of a battle and the Lakota intentions were more of a battle but it largely played out the characteristics of a massacre, the US forces were still largely unaware of the Lakota forces which were placed there for the sole reason of killing as many US soldiers as possible.    The Sand Creek Massacre was definitely a massacre due to the fact that the Cheyennes were not fighting whatsoever and had even surrendered, this meant that there was no strategic objective for the US soldiers other than to kill all that was in the camp.    The Wounded Massacre is also another definitive massacre, while it could be considered an accident at first, what happened after the first shot was fired was clearly a massacre due to the fact that the red indians were showing no hostility whatsoever, they had infact already surrendered.|`|DenLZAL1aa	You are dealing with a state of duality.

And artists like you and me create things where imagination can run wild and where other people when seeing our art, can fall into that world and lose themselves for awhile to forget their problems. And we can create things that no one else can: A place of our own where we can decide everything and not have to worry about what anyone else thinks.   So dont sweat the Laws of gravity and science, their boring anyway. :)|`|wpBMkIzlaa	Hmmm...sort of confusing how you asked it but then again I'm not feeling good today. But anyways, I would mostly try to keep the wings closer to the middle/top of the back, not the lower back|`|3HwBoqtwaa	when i draw people with wings i usually put the wing bases on the shoulder blade area, more towards the spine that the underarm side. also they need to in the lower middle of the blade, not near the top of the shoulder.   like you said, this is ignoring the laws of nature. so its not supposed to make scientifical sense. just go with what you think looks the best on your charecter.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I mean, I've never seen anyone with wings or anything, so I'm saying this by basic instinct here, but I feel like wings would connect to the spine in between the shoulder blades.
Bk4eIAWWaa	Shutter lag is a standard problem with point and shoot cameras. DSLRs do not have that problem. If it is a major concern perhaps you should move up to a DSLR|`|pKlKJR4qaa	Does it make a beeping noise and a red light blink then after 2 seconds of that it takes the picture, it might just be the option with flash or you could always change the option to no flash and no viewing time to you can take pictures non stop.|`|Osmyhvc7aa	It is probably the type of camera that you bought and there is nothing you can do.  It is just a delayed reaction.  If you want to take really fast pictures buy an SLR camera.  They are the most expensive but also the best.|`|WGU1bJ7jaa	no i dont think so, the flash does not take a picture faster  probably is just the camera with that function or you have the red eye function on|`|AA10070469	Trey depressing the shutter half way down and hold. Most will focus but not trip the shutter. When you have the picture were you want it than push the shutter down until the flash fires.It should fire faster.The reasonfor the lag may be the time it takes to ffocusthan fire the flash.It may not work for your Camera but its worth the try.It works with Canon and Fuji makes.
AA11898755	Absolutely...its a matter of 2 primary concepts - balancing adjacent colors and glazing.   The color theory concept is called "simultaneous contrast," that is, the automatically occurring influence on the apparent intensity of adjacent colors. (Green next to red vibrates, green next to yellow seems to blend, et.c). Side by side - compliments vibrate; adjacent (or harmonics) appear to blend.  The use of "glazing" will also serve your desired ends. Mixing an intense color (no white) with "medium." [Medium is used to increase the fluidity and transparency of paint without decreasing its flexibilty and stability. (standard medium recipe: 1part damar varnish, 2 parts English turpentine and 3 parts refined linseed oil - shake well)]  Applying a glaze over another dry color gives you not only the effect of the two colors (red glazed over yellow makes orange) but increases the depth of color in a way that is unattainable with directly mixed opaque red and yellow.  THAT is the key to luminosity! This was the trick of Expansionists and Luminists. Medium makes a glaze, a glaze is transparent. You paint a glaze on the canvas, light passes through the glaze, strikes the canvas, is reflected back toward the viewer literally illuminating the interior of the paint film itself! Voix la! Luminous paint!   Get to a museum (even the best photos are  poor exemplars) that has Hudson River School or American Luminists/Expansionists and look closely at the colors used and how they sit next to and over each other and you'll get it.   And what a wonderful artist toward whom to strive!

Thus, a million dollar must belong to a malicious and mischievous realm, and so, I would not go for it.    There is another perspective. That, what is true, must be eternal. So, true happiness refers to perpetual happiness. On the other hand a million dollar might give you pleasure, but that is temporary. So, it is wise to pick true happiness.

aNlT1NRqaa	I really like  1. I like the composition & dramatic lighting/contrast.     2 is a tourist shot, shot from the bedroom by someone who's never been on a farm. Closer @ goat level might be more interesting.     3-5 are just bad plant pictures.     3 is too flat and the background is too in focus & distracts from the fern. Might have been better if the fern was in sunlight & with a wider aperture.    In  4, nothing is identified as the subject. Single out one flower.     5 is just a mess. nothing to do on that but drink until you forget having taken it.    Something I read once, long ago: "The difference between a good photographer & a great one are the pictures they show others".

He was a womanizer, right up to (and including) the day he died.  And he was a prolific plagarist, including a significant part of his Doctorate publications and even his famous speeches (including dispute as to how much of his "I have a dream" was stolen).    He did what he did for civil rights, and for that he should be honored.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Perhaps, or you could also have some Scandinavian or Polish ancestry.  Biologists theorize that the epicanthic fold in adult populations originally evolved as a defense against extreme cold as well as extreme light that occurs in Northern Eurasia, although having such a fold would also protect the eyes against extreme dust storms.     It occurs in significant numbers among Native Americans, particularly of the Middle Americans was well as some populations of the South American lowlands, the Khoisan of  South Africa, and many groups of Eastern and Southeastern Asian origin. Moreover, it occasionally occurs in some European ethnic groups, most notably among Scandinavians and Poles.      The children of a set of parents with one partner having a pronounced epicanthal fold and one without an epicanthal fold will have varying degrees of an epicanthal fold as a result.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	I have an extreme case.

The majority of Europeans came from East Asia or Central Asia thousands of years ago, but that trait still probably wouldn't have been passed down.    "The term "epicanthic fold" refers to a visually categorized feature; however, there are different underlying causes. One hypothesis as to why epicanthic folds came about involves the climates in which populations expressing them arose. Sunlight reflects more intensely off light colored surfaces, such as those prevalent in snowy regions or savannahs and deserts. The theory is that an epicanthic fold in such an environment would protect the eyes from extra UV radiation. The trait may also be useful against strong winds and cold weather such as the ones on the Central Asian steppes."|`|WIv1jPleaa	I have noticed that the Cherokee features are very prominent/dominant  even if a person has just a small percentage of Cherokee blood running through his veins.   That could explain why - despite the fact that you are mostly Caucasian - the epicanthic fold is present and noticeable.

KBBonf97aa	Othello is a Moor, which makes him someone of darker skin, though not specifically African ancestry.  The term Moor was has also been used to describe people of Arab countries.  But it's assumed Shakespeare wrote the role as specifically ethnic because it added a layer of subtext to a character whose actions are ultimately deadly.  It basically allowed audiences to insert their own prejudices into the story and draw their own conclusions as to whether it was race or jealousy that doomed Othello.  Here's a ridiculously simplified version of the story:    Othello is a respected general in the Venetian army and completely loves his new wife, Desdemona.  His most trusted friend Iago envies Othello's power and believes Othello should have promoted him to a higher position, despite pretending to understand why Othello chose another man for the job.  Since everyone respects Othello, Iago decides his best chance at vengeance is to shake the very foundation of Othello's life - his happy marriage.    Recruiting unwitting friends and acquaintances to help him, Iago begins planting seeds in Othello's head that Desdemona is secretly unhappy,  unfaithful, etc.  Over time, Othello becomes convinced that Iago is his only ally and that everyone else is complicit in Desdemona's scheming.  He is so blinded by the imagined betrayal, he kills Desdemona.  And in classic Shakespearean fashion, as soon as Othello has killed his wife, he's presented with evidence that his trusted ally basically orchestrated Othello's entire downfall and that Desdemona was innocent all along.  Then, unable to live with himself after killing his beloved wife, Othello kills himself.    There's a great updated BBC version of "Othello" on DVD starring Eamonn Walker, Keeley Hawes and Christopher Eccleston.  The story is moved to a modern police station, but the plot is still pure Shakespeare.  It's far better than most updated versions of Shakespeare and it's available through NetFlix.  Hope this helps!|`|ShaUAySvaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello Plo...  you can find a lot about is by simply looking around online and reading :]  BEST ANSWER - you know you love me :P|`|BrxTq9sGaa	othello isnt black. the play is about a love triangle and based in the olden days

P5Pjjy26aa	I really don't think you should find random graffiti on the internet and put it on your hoodie. If you're into graffiti you should do something yourself or have a friend do it.   Or you could buy a hoodie with graffiti printed on it, so that you are  not stealing someone's artwork without payment or credit. Check out the Kazbah at Karmaloop.com or if you can find it, there is this one crew, Giants Casting Shadows, that have some pretty sick pieces and a dope clothing line.|`|YgDO6sxAaa	your name in animated letters. nothing to fancy but maybe your fave color or something like that.or maybe the name of a sport so that you can have your own custom made jersey hoody. :)

5VqxkMFuaa	a. is the closest thing to an answer, even though it is not entirely true. The crisis of '73 (for the US) was mainly due to the Arab oil producing countries putting an embargo on export of oil to the US because of their support of Israel. The oil crisis of the late '70s was due to the disruption of oil export to the US because of the revolution in Iran.

uJBnZWtcaa	Get to know your camera and what it can do.  Get away from Auto on the mode dial.  Take lots and lots of photos, look at each one for what could be done differently to make it better.    Pay attention to lighting and atmosphere.  Early morning and late afternoon light is great for landscapes.  Fog and smog don't make for good wideangle shots but diffuse light is great for close up and portraits.    Good photo editing doesn't change a photo.  If a photo needs a lot of work, then it wasn't taken correctly.  You might want to tweak the lighting or contrast a tad. Maybe crop it.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	lots of great info on the web, if you have time to read check out some or all of these sites...    http://digital-photography-school.com/po...  http://www.tutorial9.net/category/photog...  http://www.picturecorrect.com/Photograph...  http://theonlinephotographer.com/the_onl...    A couple quickies from lil ol' amateur me:    Watch your composition, don't just hold the camera, "roughly" center and snap.  Adjust your shuttter/aperture/exposure and film speed.  Doing so can potentially save you quite a bit of time.  Keep the sun behind you for general lighting, and watch that your shadow isn't in the photo.  Obviously there are times when you want to blatantly ignore one or both parts of this.  Spare batteries and cards if you're going out for a while and have no means to download.  Enjoy the time and have fun.

0aEYjVzMaa	you need to practice practice practice  if you and you teacher have time after class you should ask her to show you how to do one.  one on one is easier than a group teaching if you really want to learn something.    and you need to practice at home.  make sure you have the basic concept of where your feet are supposed to be.  prepare, and try and do a half pirouette, or even a quarter one.  keep doing that until you feel really comfortable with it.  then move up about a quarter, and keep doing it till you feel comfortable.  just remember to keep your movements slow and controlled.  though it may be harder than just randomly spinning out of control, it's much better for you.  soon you'll be able to do a single.  after that, you can continue to work your way up.  i'm still working on them myself, the best i can do is a triple.    it may get discouraging, but don't give up.  good luck!|`|EZHXhsLTaa	hey don't be frustrated. I've been doing ballet for 12 years and have just now come up with the dedication to start working on pirouettes. I still have a tough time doing a single from time to time.    The key to a pirouette is even spotting. Pull up your stomach muscles also and keep your hips forward. Bring your leg under you.|`|PrqfYO7Oaa	Try doing a piroutte in quaters, then once you've done that four times and got back to how u where facing before try then doing it in halfs, then try a full one, and when your doing them once you stop try and stay on your toes for as long as you can, it helps with balance. I hope this helped (: goodluck xo|`|Gc08POCYaa	i remember those days...        but dont get discouraged! an excercise i used was stand somewhere staring at a wall and find something you can spot.    so now start turning over your right shoulder and when you cant look at your spot anymore whip your head around and find the spot and continue with the same move make sure you keep your feet close together!!      when you move on to pirouettes you have to pull up as if someone were pullng your ponytail and squeeze everything !! your butt and abs[:    GOOD LUCK|`|qLdFVKWYaa	don't be discouraged! i had the same problem as you and now i can do doubles and even triples and more! believe it or not it really has alot to do with balance and spotting! try to see how long you can balance on one foot and then on demi pointe. and use your arms to bring you around. because it has to do with arms as well.practice everyday. and just know that even though i don't know you, i believe in you! you can do it!|`|CMUexmmiaa	One of the best ways to get a pirouette is to get balance. Stand on one foot with your other leg up, touching your toes to your knee. The top of your thigh should be a perfectly flat surface. Put your arms in second position and go up in on your toes. Hold it for as long as you can. Keep doing this until you get your balance down. Then try to do the actual turn. Remember, keep your back totally straight!  After you do that, try starting your pirouette in fourth position. Then you have something to really push off on!  Hope this helps!|`|f8c2e2aa545c71ab2860b423f0719bdfaa	The best advice I can give you think think tall it makes your balance better.
0XbyDBQLaa	Usually directors ask why you want the position, why you believe that you are qualified, and what you would do or change is you got the position.    Basically, confidence is key in these interviews. The patterns that you know are great, and the dynamics are too. I don;t believe that you'll have to learn how to do those specific left-handed techniques for the audition though. I'm a drum major, and my director always stresses clarity above everything to me. Sometimes, especially from the field, it is hard to see a clear pattern when the fancy techniques are used. Although they are impressive, you won't need them in this position.    If you still want to learn how to do these techniques, I would suggest asking your director or the current drum major/s. Don't be shy, asking for help will prove to them that you're really serious about wanting this position, and they're there to help!    Hope this helped! Good Luck! :))|`|bC3eBo0aaa	Oh goody, my area of expertise.  I don't know how your field band works, but in mine they make you march while you conduct.

yFx2QGGWaa	How World War Two effected the US    Economic- First of all it got the US out of Great Depression because of all the government spending by both the US and Foreign Governments. Also the US had built a large cargo ship fleet to transport goods to and from the US (the Famed Liberty and Victory ships) Also It made the US the only western superpower because the US gained money from the war.    Foreign Policy- First of all it was a change of foreign policy for the US to leave isolationism and truly become a member of the global community. Then they had the muscle of the most powerful weapons on earth and a powerful navy, air force, and army. Then add all the nazi tech we took back to make missiles, better jet aircraft, and other things. The US was able to be a major player in the affairs of the world    I'm going to combine the three categories of Civil Rights, gender roles, and the impact on the lives of minorities.  First of all the war proved that they were not substandard to the WASP's(M) ( White, Anglo-Saxton, Protestant, Male) The African Americans, Asian, Hispanic, and Native Americans proved themselves on the battlefield that after WWII the Armed forces became Integrated. The Women proved themselves in the home-front taking the jobs that men left to go to war and they were building the tools of war in heavy industry, women were now seen out in jean paints or overalls, using welders & rivet guns, and doing things that most people think that they could not do. For minorities they were able to prove that they were just as good as the WASPs. The only group that was hurt by WWII was the Japanese-Americans, they were basically treated like POWs.    The federal government bascally became a big group regulating anything that effected their abillity to wage war. The US controled the flow of goods and were raw reasources were sent (Women were forced to used markers to fake that they had pantyhose on by drawing a line on the back of their legs) Information that delt with the war was controlled, unlike today and CNN, the US made sure that no-one was getting critical info about what the US was doing and all of it was one-sided. They also told people to watch what they said ( the old line,"Loose Lips, Sink Ships") people gave up a little of their rights at that time but not much as we have today.    Don- The US did not give up its sovereignty, the UN is NOT a government, it is a body of nations that come together to create stabability in the world. They don't have as much power as you think they do.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	Haven't you done your homework? This essay question seems to be related to specific topics covered in class. Of which, I was not in.     Obviously women were introduced into the workforce during ww2 and allowed to show their mettle in factories and production lines. I imagine that many women kept their jobs or wanted to keep them after the war. Perhaps they were able to keep them as soldiers that came back from the war went to college under the GI bill.  Certain materials that were rationed for the war effort could go back into items for domestic production and consumption.  Yes we did use the A-bomb. However, it did not seem to carry much weight as Stalin failed to keep his promises regarding Eastern Europe. He continued to occupy them and forbade free elections.  A new era of optimism since America was on the winning side but also a new era of fear as the Cold War opened up with the USSR.  Shortly after ww2 Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the major leagues. Perhaps Herman Goering pointed out our hypocrisy.|`|3woyz5ucaa	Led to the cold war and increased tensions between the US and the USSR. NATO was created because of WWII and so was the Warsaw pact. Pretty much all the later wars such as Vietnam and Korean wars were a result of WWII, just not a direct result. The United States gathered many scientist from Germany which was known as operation Paperclip, and sped up the production of atomic bombing and jet planes (the soviets also had German scientists, and this was just the beginning of an Arms race during the cold war). The US is the only world super power which claimed that name after WWII.|`|Y04GKUIUaa	economy-it helped the US get out of the Great Depression by spurring the economy    expansion-it greatly increased the power of the US government over the people of the US    minorities-it proved that minority races could indeed perform well in the war and were willing to fight for their nation|`|VOZWgWgLaa	The primary ways that WW2 impacted the United States were in economics and foreign policy.    Before WW2, the entire world was marred in the Great Depression. For the US, the war saved the American economy. More people went to work in industrial plants to support the war effort and many also directly served in the war, largely ending the high unemployment of the depression.    In terms of foreign policy, WW2 brought America out of isolationism. Up until 1945, America believed the vastness of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans protected them from the wars of Europe and Asia. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941, and the German U-boat campaign of l proved that distances were not an effective shield. At the same time, the presence of aggressive Soviet forces along the river Elbe and running all the way to Greek-Turkish border in Europe, America was presented with an enemy that it perceived to be a real threat. The threat posed by Stalin encouraged Truman to keep America active in international politics to prevent the Soviets from taking over Europe and encouraging the Communist Chinese from taking over Asia. The Atomic Bomb was nothing more then a weapon used in the post-WW2 diplomacy. The US used the threat of the bomb to stop the blockade of Berlin by the Soviets, and provided a strong deterent to Soviet troops in Europe. After the Soviets got their own bomb, it insured that all Soviet/US conflicts on a military level would be small scale and in insignificant portions of the globe.
Nwm1JZNXaa	I would take dance classes definitely if you want to get better at that.  I enjoyed jazz class for theater...  That would probably be the most helpful for you.  I also took voice lessons, but wasn't in chorus, so if you have the money to spring for that then do it but if not you should be fine as long as your stick with chorus.  Also I would try and take part in community theater in the summer if you can.  You can make great connections that way too.  Probably the last thing would be to just keep reading plays and seeing them.  The best think is to throw yourself into it full force and see people who are really good at it.  It will help you get motivated and learning.  Good luck.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Let me tell you this right now:    Everything you learn about acting in highscool is wrong.

Although thats what makes it even more unrealistic, but you do sound as if you are on the right road, how long is the theatre troupe? There is no extreme rush right, although yeah the sooner, the better but i would say take that first, and it's another great thing on your portfolio. And we only live once,so why not go for our dreams? and it depends how your family look at it, if they really believe in you and want that for you as much as you do that they are willing to sacrafice money for a trip which would have to kinda be organised that you do actually see agents there ect. But on the other hand you could always try get a job and go there for like a year, find someone to share a flat with so it would be cheaper if that is an option to you?

rVhrVyRGaa	http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?na...    Surname: Boggs  This is an ancient and honorable surname found in the spellings of Boggers, Boggas, Boggis and Boggs, of which the later is the usual spelling. All are rare, even in Yorkshire, which was probably its original 'home'. The name derives from the Middle English (12th century) word 'bogeys', and as such it was a nickname for 'bold' person. The precise meaning of 'bold' in 13th century terms was certainly not the same as the 20th century. It implied somebody who was 'a character' or 'a likely lad', and was clearly complimentary. The surnames Bogey(s) or Bogie(s) survives in their own right, particularly in Yorkshire. One of the earliest recordings is that of John Bogays of Wakefield in 1301, while in 1309 William Bogace is recorded in the same city. By 1327 it was recorded in East Anglia, William Bogges being so recorded in the Subsidy Rolls for Suffolk. Subsequently in many different spellings, the surname did achieve considerable popularity in the region. Other recordings include Nicholas Bogges of Somerset in 1377, and somewhat later Robert Boggas of Stratford, Suffolk, in June 1562, and Guye Boggish of Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, in 1623. On April 12th 1655, William Boggis was recorded at All Saints, Sudbury, Suffolk, while on June 3rd 1707, Isac Boggis as spelled, was a witness at the christening of his son, also Isac, at All Saints Church, Norwich. A Coat of Arms was been granted in East Anglia, the date is believed to be circa 1680. It has the blazon of- per chevron, red and silver, three crescents counterchanged. The crest is a single sail. The arms suggest a navigator who gained success over the infidel. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Elyas Bogeys, which was dated 1260, The Hundred Rolls of Yorkshire, during the reign of King Henry 111, known as 'The Frenchman', 1216 - 1272.      http://www.familysearch.org  has these varied spellings: BOAG; BOGUE ; BOOGE ; BOGS ; BUGG ; BUGGE; BOGG ; BOOG; BOX; BOG. Listings were found worldwide.|`|0HAn67yZaa	boggs Name Meaning and History  English: nickname from Middle English boggish boastful, haughty (a word of unknown origin, perhaps akin to Germanic bag and bug, with the literal meaning swollen, puffed up). The name (in the forms Boge(y)s, Boga(y)s) is found in the 12th century in Yorkshire and East Anglia, and also around Bordeaux, which had trading links with East Anglia.|`|5fpKb2aIaa	It is from Scotland and was originally spelled Boak.

pDKm9Wmgaa	You would need watercolor paper for your paintings. Watercolor paper won't fall apart when moistened. You can use watercolor pencils three different ways. First, you can draw dry onto wet, where the pencil is dry and the paper is moist. You can draw dry on dry and brush water onto the drawing. Not too much water, you don't want the color to run off. You can wet the pencil point and draw wet onto dry. If you have woodless watercolor pencils, the shavings can be put into a small amount of water and used that way. If you google 'painting with watercolor pencils' in images, you will get lots of pics of paintings and some instructional video.|`|s6bD8vOtaa	wow you got a really good answer!|`|AA10737082	Northlight Books has a website and there are several good books on watercolor pencils.  Jerry's Artarama website has free lessons on their site on many mediums and techniques.  Go to     www,jerrysartarama.com  and look for their free art lessons.     Any good watercolor paper will do for the watercolor pencils.  SInce the pencils don't take as much water as tube watercolors, you can get away with a little lighter weight paper which is cheaper. You can use the pencils several ways.  You can add one dry color on top of another and blend with a wet brush (my favorite technique). You can wet the paper and draw on it and the water in the paper will make the pencil strokes "bloom". You can use a wet brush and scrub it on the pencil point to make a paint right on the brush and stroke it onto the paper. You can scrape particles of pigment off the point of the pencil and activate them with a wet brush into a little pool of paint.  If you go to the Jerry's website, have a look at the AQUARELLE pencils - made, I think, by Derwent (the BEST watercolor pencils). The Aquarelles pencils are solid pigment - no wood in the pencil, just color.  These have a HUGE amount of color and are lucious  and long lasting.|`|jSTy7E4Maa	HI!  I would agree with most of the things in the answer you got above.   I use watercolour pencils A LOT. They are one of my favourites.   I use them not only on akvarelle paper, but basically on any paper (most of papers contain enough glue to survive watercolour pencil usage). I used watercoulour pencils not only on aquarell paper, but on copy paper, carboard, even on canvas on board (which was mostly painted with used egg tempera).  I use the penciles in many ways:  dry pencil- on dry paper (looks like normal color pencils), wet pencil on dry paper (makes stronger colour an diferent quality of lines), dry pencil on wet paper (try this out, it is fun), and wet pencil on wet paper (very intens colours). I also combine these pencils with other water based techniques (such as water colour, guash, egg tempera, ink, etc). You can get really interesting things if you combine techniques.    I would suggest, not to be so afraid of trying the watercoulour pencils you got. They work fine with any water based techniques, and on most  paper surfaces (well dont use wet pencil on serviette or toilet paper! . but you know that) I guess there is not one "propper" way to use them. Try it out, experiment , be creative, have fun and find out what works for you. You got some ideas here with our ansers, and now it is your turn to get some fun with your new pencils.   If the answers you got are not sufficient, please feel free to contact me by email, and I will be hapy to send yousome examples. :-)  Hope my answer helped and I wish you good luck in your artistic expression.

If you have to mail one in and don't get it back, chalk up another $25 or so.    The procedure is the same in all counties in California, although the cost may vary. I suspect the procedure is about the same in most states in the USA, although the cost and the length of time may vary.

(i think its close to the gigs part.)look for people needing actresses or actors for films. its easier to get a part in those.you can put those on your resume. when you go to auditions casting directors only really look at your resume as like backup or whatever. and your headshot is how they remeber you or if you look the part.what they really pay attention at is your talent.oh yes and don't be in acting for the fame(or the jonas brothers you wouldn't believe how many girls it seems want to be actresses all of a sudden so they can be friends with them) be in acting for your love of acting.

0Jkp4qitaa	Ancient China used natural barriers.  They did not know other ancient cities existed.  The Himalayan Mountains was a natural barrier.    There's also the modern and ancient deserts-  The Gobi Desert is one of the driest deserts in the world. In the Gobi, there is at least the hope of water, although an oasis is rare.      The Taklamakan Desert, China's other desert, is nicknamed the Sea of Death. It offers poisonous snakes, frequent sand storms, boiling days, freezing nights, and intense water shortages. The Sea of Death is not a small desert. In fact, it is the second largest desert in the world.       And we cannot forget the rivers!  The Yangtze (Long River) is the third longest river in the world. It is about 4000 miles long. It floods each year and leaves fertile soil along the banks. The Yangtze River has high banks, which keeps homes safe from the annual flooding.      The Huang He (Yellow River) is about 3000 miles long. It also floods each year. The banks along the Huang He River are low. Civilization in ancient China began along the Yellow River about 5000 years ago.      These early people called all rivers in China by the nickname "The Great Sorrow".  That is because each year during the flood season, all homes along the Huang He River were destroyed. Each year, the ancient Chinese had to rebuild their homes and their lives.

It will also give the opprotunity to make more friends, and develop a talent.  If you have dance recitals, you'll have teh chance to stand out.  Its a great experience and hip hop is one the most fun types of dance to learn.  You can probably get into a beginners class or a class who takes a lot of new people so don't worry.

zS7bOjn4aa	Firstly, congratulations on getting the part of Laurie. I've been in Oklahoma myself as Ado Annie so I should be able to help.  We had to get our costumes too. My recommendation would be to find a seamstress and some material and have your own costume made, and then you can specify exactly what you want and don't have to conform to what people can give you over the internet or something.  My other recommendation would be to try a costume website and see what they can offer you.  Our Laurie wore a costume that was supposed to be for Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' and she had it altered to make it longer and more 'Old Western'  Try taking a look at the original movie that starred Shirley Jones and Gordon Mac Rae as Laurie and Curly.   Or the pro-shot stage version with Josefina Gabriella and Hugh Jack man.

wYvFytHoaa	Okay whoever mentioned the dollar bill trick for the pad...DO NOT try that!!! Dollar bills are much to rough for the delicate pads. And pads never stick shut, they just make a sticking sound...if that's what's happenening, use cigarette paper to blot off any dirt but don't pull it out while the key is pressed, take it out after releasing the key. If it still sticks, I recommend some Yamaha powder paper which can be found at a good music store.    And about not being able to play an F , if you can play the other notes fine, it's a leaking pad or the key regulation is out of adjustment. Try playing a low C, going up in the chromatic scale...what note goes airy in the chromatic scale? Once you fine that note, you'll be able to locate the problem more easily. Play the chromatic scale with the lightest finger pressure as possible because if you have to press on the keys hard, you surely have leaking pads.  Take your flute to a good repair shop if there's something wrong.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	ok well to play f sharp you put your finger on the last key at the middle part and you put your fingers on the first three keys in the middle...were you doing that? Well, I had the same problem with my instrument, it was an airy sound and since I cant see your flute I am not sure if it is because one of your keys is broken like mine. I wish you the best and i suggest going to get it checked like i did. Hope i helped and good luck,     ~Confusedgirl|`|2xOF70S1aa	well, you have been able to get it out before right? i'm assuming that you have a leaky pad.  show your flute to your band/orchestra conductor or teacher, they should be able to tell what's wrong with it.  you don't need to buy a new one you just have to have it sent in.  if you have any other questions then you can e-mail me at fluttietutti@yahoo.com, i'd be happy to help.|`|CEewwlz8aa	Your key for the f sharp might be stick/stuck, so take a clean dollar bill and put it under the key and press down it works! Good luck!
zRFvk96Eaa	I would ask him. I would guess he had a perfectly logical (6 year old logic) reason for doing that.    Maybe he saw a cartoon that looked like that and thought it was cool. Maybe you both share a body type where you have really short necks.

He probably admires you, and he wants to be like you.  Or, Maybe that was just a way of setting the two of you apart from the rest of the family (not that he doesn't also love them) and he was imagining spending time with you.   I'm no psych major - just a mom of a 6 year old too.

gM03eKTJaa	You would probably be better off with tying it on (string ligature) for a quick fix, but it's probably best to go to the shop and TRY ALL their ligatures and buy the best - it doesn't have to be metal (there are some good leather/fabric ones). They're just more convenient, stable and less fiddly.  I'm not sure what taping a reed on would do but be careful that it might leave some of the adhesive behind on the mouthpiece/reed and that would be messy. You probably haven't taped the reed on tight enough or taped it too high or low on the reed. The ligature (or lig. substitute) should be between the lines etched onto your mouthpiece (if any).  If you don't know how to tie a string lig: http://sterkel.org/clarinet/wendl.htm|`|wJiWuTMjaa	get a ligature. just go to a music store and show them ur mouthpiece. for now a better thing 2 use  than tape is a hair tie|`|wp7iz2VGaa	just put some food equipment lubricant into the clarinet and it will sound fantastic|`|mQmOLNWFaa	get a proper ligature.  The rubber/leather ones are really good|`|exxHakadaa	You really need to get a ligature. It's a lot easier to play than without one. They aren't that expensive.|`|6b336f053449299053a7b76756dc1081aa	Leather/fabric/rubber ligatures are the best, they usually have only one screw and the screw is often placed opposite the reed.  I found that metal ligatures are cheaply made and the screws need to be so tight that they risk breaking.|`|QzmndrDJaa	This would definitly be a problem caused by not using a proper ligature. You need to go to the store where you got your clarinet or to a music store and tell them you need a ligature, because your clarinet is supposed to be sold with one included. If they tell you they can't give you one ask how much it would be to get one and get it as soon as possible. Also, scotch tape will mess up your reed, not to mention the damage it might do to your mouth piece itself.

D6htQcDbaa	No, not necessarily.  The tension between European powers for supremacy (especially over naval power, land, alliances, etc) and nationalism were underling causes. But the main cause was the struggle over the Balkans region of Europe, which both Russia and Austria claimed. Then, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the Austrian throne) by Serbian nationalists occurred. Austria and Russia declared war on each other soon after. Germany entered the war to aid Austria because of their strong connections and alliance.|`|olahi6esaa	They didn't start it, but they certainly were responsible for most of the damage during the war.
dbfb8185661f046a9017398b63ebcc44aa	I'm hoping to do NYC soon , so I had talked to a friend of mine who has done several flights producing spectacular shots including Grand Canyon. So this was his advice to me.  Settings , no one setting due to all the variables ie: weather, speed and direction traveling (which dictates your lighting), so he advises start f4 at 1/400 ISO 200look at the photo and histogram and make adjustments from them. He also suggests bracketing at -1 0 +1 for using photoshops HDR merge  Other tips he gave which might come in handy                First, go early morning , early sun enhances the colors , produces some incredible shadows and not so much light as to was out the shots.  Second, Don't zoom too much, go for quality and crop later.  Third , keep the horizon level , can't tell you how much he emphasized this, but it was a lot  Fourth , shoot fast to avoid shake by the helicopter, even though you are moving you are shooting distance so motion blur becomes a non factor.   Fifth , get there early to get a window seat, evidently some seat three in a row and being in the middle not only sucks but you'll annoy those next to you .   Sixth,   don't take the ride constantly looking through the camera it's a great experience don't miss it!  So all that said , have a great trip!!!|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	You should read the manual so you can set the ISO also... ISO regulates the light sensitivity.  If it is extremely bright out ISO 100 or whatever the lowest ISO is will work.  Shutter speed should be set after this along with aperature if your camera permits it.  Higher ISOs are for low light... 6400 would be used in extreme dark conditions|`|AA11148143	Go with shutter priority. Choppers are shaky, as you seem to know already, and motion comp may not be adequate.    Daylight should not be a problem, but these things work against you at night. Use the 5 MP setting, by all means, that's about the best you can do for resolution anyway.|`|Glm1aaGOaa	sport!|`|5nw3LU3caa	I dont think there is a solution to your question. I've tried it myself.  I am a pilot on a comercial airline.|`|GQemfOANaa	Hi, if your shooting from the helicopter on a you will be looking at a shutter of at least 125/sec and above..aim for apertures of over 8 so that you get a good mix of fast enough shutter speed and good amounts of shapness/depth of field.|`|XD7koB5faa	There is no easy answer to this, but several guidelines.  The good news is that the camera has image stabilization, which should be good for at least 2 stops of speed.      Ideally, even with image stabilization, you are going to want high shutter speed, as you correctly surmised.  This is to compensate for any helicopter vibration, plus the long, 400 mm equivalent focal length of the lens.  1/500 sec would be a minimum, with 1/1000 much better.    As for ISO, I haven't read about the quality of the image at higher ISO settings.  I would experiment with those before going on the trip so that you know how much noise you can tolerate.  But, if you have to choose between noise from high ISO or blur from low shutter speed, take the noise.  You want sharp images.    As for the image getting dimmer as you increase the shutter speed, that makes me wonder what setting you were using.  If you were in 'M' (manual) mode, that would explain the problem.    For your helicopter ride, I would suggest the 'S' (shutter speed) setting.  This allows you to select your preferred shutter speed and the camera should adjust the aperture (within its limits) to get the right exposure.      Good luck with your trip,    Ted|`|o8y4JgFpaa	the helicopter setting

aNlT1NRqaa	There's a little more math involved, so here it goes:    Film or full frame digital your eye sees approximately the same as a 50mm lens.    3x on a digital ps camera usually starts @ 35mm so =35-105 or 2x closer than you see it. A 4x ps camera usually is 28-112 so same telephoto as a 3x. Your 15x zoom is probably a 38-525 (or 10.5x your eyes)    The lenses your getting tell me you're looking @ Nikon (good choice). They use a 1.5x multiplier, which means your 18-55 = 28-80 (actually 27, but 28 is where the film lens starts so everyone uses that) and the 55-200 = 80-300 (6x your eyes). 300 may seem like a lot less than 525, but the new camera will be so much better, you'll be able to crop to 525 and still have a better picture than your pocket camera. If you still want a better zoom, don't get the 2-lens kit & buy the 70-300VR (450mm equivalent). It's $500, but even better quality.    My standard suggestion: Buy @ a camera store. They know what they're doing, good ones won't sell gray market (danger!), some have lessons, and they will help you and be easier to get help from, in the event you get a defective product.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	My SLR came with a 18-70mm.  I just bougth a 75-300mm today.  The zoom is so impressive, I can read text through the camera that is a blur without.  On the other hand, I tried to take a picture of my kitchen that I just painted and I couldn't zoom out enough, so I had to switch back to my old lense.  You will probably find 18-55mm is adequate most of the time but there will be times you want to zoom farther, then you will want the bigger lense.  The digital camera zoom rating means nothing to me, it certainly isn't 15 times larger, I don't know how they rate them.  My new lense said 4x on the label, which seems close to right, things appear larger with the lense than with the eye.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	All SLR lenses are listed in millimeters not X factor. While a 18-55mm is a 3x zoom the 50-200 is a 4x zoom and a 100-300 is a 3x zoom. The 18-55 and 100-300 are both 3x zooms but give a very different field of view. What the X zoom means is that the largest length is 3 times bigger than the smallest for the 18-55. With point and shoot cameras you can call it a 3x zoom because the lenses are permanent. With SLR cameras you can change the lens to suit your needs. To get an idea of the amount of zoom a lens will have compare it to your current camera. You say your camera is a 15x zoom. Look at the front of the lens. It should tell you the millimeters of the lens. It might say 5-75mm for example. This would be the equivalent of a 27- 414mm equivalent on a 35mm camera. This is because of the tiny size of the sensor in a point and shoot camera. Now you are buying a DSLR that will be using a much larger sensor but not as big as 35mm film. So you have to multiply the focal length (mm) by 1.5 for Nikon or 1.6 for Canon to get the equivalent focal length of a 35mm camera.   Now to figure all this out your new camera with these two lenses will have an equivalent focal length of about 28-320 or an 11.4x zoom. If you went with a different telephoto lens like a 55-250mm you would have an equivalent focal length of 28-400mm (14.2x). If you went with a 70-300mm lens you would get a 28-480mm equivalent or a 17x zoom. There would be a slight gap in the middle if you went with this lens though.    Before you buy the camera determine what degree of zoom you have to have. Then buy the lens that best suits your needs|`|n71t0xoCaa	When they talk about X factors that is really more marketing than telling you anything about what the lens does. An 18-55, 70-210 and 100-300 are all 3X lenses and they are totallty different. larger range lenses have to deal with chromatic abberation and distortions that  often make lower zoom or even prime lenses sharper and able to give better image quality. On a small sensor point and shoot this is less of a problem because it is easier to get a larger zoom range in relation to the smaller sensor due to high crop factors. Additionally they do not have the image quality to be bothered by the poorer lens quality|`|iL1tYfJMaa	most canon and nikon camera have a cropping feature that is about 1.5 times    Therefore your 50-200 mm lens would become somehting  like 75-300     18-55 mm would become 27-80 or therabouts.|`|482c3c164b9ceae77a848c4b02f2704eaa	Those sound like a good place to start, but keep in mind, kit lenses are sometimes low quality. You can always add more later, but that 200 will probably be more than you're ever need unless you're going to shoot things like the moon.|`|WJLl0d3Jaa	Looks like everyone else explained already, but I'll just add that's a good starting kit for a beginning photographer.    Quick question, are you going the Pentax route? They are a good company, but you may have trouble finding lenses if they aren't one of the Big Two (Canon/Nikon, and Sony, sorta).

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	You're confusing several different things.  HTML code and image editing are two separate things.  MySpace is VERY new, but HTML code has been around for a long time.      HTML is the code used to design websites, and that has been around for a LONG time.  It was probably standardized sometime in the mid-1990s, around the time the Internet ("World Wide Web") became widely available to the public.  Every website you go to uses HTML code to design the page...what font size and color to use, where to put images and links, etc.  It's a code that tells your computer how to display the page.    I have been around computers my entire life (starting with old Apple II e's when I was a little kid).  I first started using the Internet around 1997, although I vaguely remember when I first heard something about the "world wide web" around 1993.  I know for a fact that I never had heard of such a thing as the "Internet" before 1993 or 1994.  In fact, I lost contact with a good friend when I was a kid, when he moved around 1992...I didn't have his new phone number or address, so there was no way to contact him.  There was no such thing as email at that time.    There might have been image editing programs for computers, but it was nowhere near as popular as it is now.  Image manipulation has become popular because of social networking sites like MySpace (and ESPECIALLY MySpace) because this is really the first time where websites were made just for the sole purpose of socilazing.  In fact, before MySpace, you never would have seen so many pictures that people took of THEMSELVES.  I'll bet that if you asked people, you would find a lot of people who bought a digital camera specifically because they wanted to post pictures on MySpace.    They wanted to put "cool" pictures on MySpace to copy what their friends are doing, and so image manipulation became popular.  In fact, in some ways MySpace really is degrading photography because it has put too much focus on manipulating bad snapshots on a computer, instead of just trying to take more interesting pictures with your camera.     A lot of people would probably find this hard to believe...but there was a world BEFORE MySpace and digital cameras and "photoshopping."  Digital cameras are relatively new...they didn't become widely available to the public until probably the late 1990s at least.  I don't know anyone who had a digital camera until at least 2000 or 2001.  And before MySpace, if you looked at pictures online, you wouldn't have seen all the manipulated images that you see now.    MySpace is very new.  One of my friends first told me about it around 2005.  And I didn't know anyone else who was on it before then.  There might have been an early version of it in 2003, but it was more of a closed network at that time.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	Yes, long before MySpace there were websites but digital photo editing didn't take off until digital cameras came along    The first cameras and editing software were for Apple computers:    The first digital cameras for the consumer-level market that worked with a home computer via a serial cable were the Apple QuickTake 100 camera (February 17 , 1994), the Kodak DC40 camera (March 28, 1995), the Casio QV-11 (with LCD monitor, late 1995), and Sony's Cyber-Shot Digital Still Camera (1996).     Photoshop has a long history.  It was used with Apple computers, too.  The only way to get photos into the computer was to scan them.

Se Tu M'ami is also wonderful by Pergolesi    If you're looking for something from an opera "O Mio Babbino Caro" from Gianni Schicchi is a great dramatic piece that has wonderful range for performance, the top note is an A below high C.     The only issue would be time, they're all pretty challenging, especially if you don't have much time to learn them.|`|rT22hTL0aa	You say the audition is tomorrow?  Are you sure you want to learn something new by tomorrow?      "Caro Mio Ben" is a well known and beautiful Italian song.  "26 Italian Songs And Arias" is a book of Arias commonly used in classical voice lessons (however, you may not be able to get it by tomorrow).

That is the direct responsibility of the architect.  The architect may provide structural framing and foundation plans as well.  Besides a structural engineer, an architect will also work with a civil engineer, contracted directly with the owner, structural engineer, and sometimes Mechanical, Plumbing, and Electrical engineers.|`|YgDO6sxAaa	well there's slope. for steps and rooftops. i want to be an architect when i grow up.
AA10729675	In addition to what?    There were three main classes, very rigid, with rare possibility of mobility.  All classes of course are under the king.    Then you have the nobles.  Then the free citizens or awilu.  Some being of low estate are called the mushkenu.   Free citizens had to serve civil or military service.    Then you have the slaves: wardu.    Some slaves could pay back for their freedom: those were called the debt-slaves.    I think that the Code of Hammurabi should reflect that.  But the Code of Hammurabi was not the first Code in Babylonia; there were several before Hammurabi.  Babylon liked codes.
eG6iObzFaa	thats a great poem! i love it! whoever you wrote it for should be really happy!|`|6ocK56vzaa	Seems more like a bunch of statements rather than a poem, because it doesn't really use any literary devices (i.e. metaphors, similes, rhyme scheme, personification, etc.)|`|dTEbLgvEaa	Just sounds like you are infatuated with someone and still in that romantic period.|`|4WjB4tHjaa	Wow!    It is very good!|`|XBulMn2zaa	Some good lines, but needs work to be considered a poem.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	I am not a fan, because of the message it sends.  It leads the reader to believe that you need someone else to make you whole and complete.  My opinion.   :o)
1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	you need a 4th verse, after "but i've got news for you" there should be what the actual news is. it's like but i've got news for you i tried so hard but that's not really the news i think you really need something after the second verse.|`|e29392feb37f2277efd21fe12dbdea66aa	sorry but it kind of sucks....|`|5sH8JAVkaa	I know poems don't have to rhyme but in this poem I think that's the missing piece.

My guess is, by your statement of your dislikes, they are probably fans of one or both genres, correct?  lol    My musical tastes vary a lot, so I'm not sure if you'll be interested in what I like, but if you want a really broad range, you could try listening to musical soundtracks such as "Phantom of the Opera".  I also like 50's and 60's music like The Platters (No, I'm not that old.  I learned about them in swing choir in school).      Enya and Enigma are very relaxing.      But, I listen to almost anything.  Classical, jazz (all forms), Big Band era, classic rock (Def Leppard, Jethro Tull, Moody Blues), a bit of rap...I'm not a fan of country, but I do like a few female artists who have a "take charge" attitude.      But, as I said, I doubt my list will help you much...but you can try a few if you like!  :)|`|zBpj9jCfaa	Okkervil River  The Decemberists  Fleet Foxes  Dan Deacon  The Weakerthans  Minus the Bear  A.A.

But, your musical tastes say a lot about who you are.  Maybe they just want you to like what THEY like.  Unless you want to change something about you, then stick with what you like already.
CMUexmmiaa	It depends on what kind of a jazz dance you are going for...  If you're going for jazz like Harry Connick Jr., then a song like "Save the Last Dance for Me" by Michael Buble would be a good one(still not a traditional jazz song). But if you're going for more of a jazz dance to a pop song, then "Upside Down" or "Can't Help Falling in Love" by A*Teens or "It's Not Just Make Believe" by Kari Kimmel.  Hope this helps!!!|`|UBUoqsL4aa	Vouge by Madonna.. Its not on the radio much.. *cough*  Knock on Wood..

Its absolutely fantastic. Almost as good as the Twilight Series.     It is a Sci-Fi novel. It's set in the not so distant future when Earth has been taken by these aliens (not really aliens, not like little green men or anything) called 'Souls'. These Souls take over the body and mind of a human and just use it as a 'host body'. But when Wanderer, a soul, is implanted in the host body of Melanie Stryder, the mind of Melanie does not fade away as it should.    Its SO good! A must read!    How about... The Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld? His writing is similar to that of Stephenie Meyer.   Uglies is a Sci-Fi novel set in the future. In this world, when you turn 16, you have to get an operation to make yourself 'pretty'. Tally, the protagonist, can't wait to be pretty. But her friend doesn't. She wants to stay an Ugly. Tally has to choose whether she wants to betray her friend and become a Pretty, or follow and stay an Ugly forever.     An AMAZING book, too. There are four books in the series: Uglies, Pretties, Specials and Extras. Scott Westerfeld has also written a vampire novel called 'Peeps'. Not as good as the Uglies series, I must say, but still a fabulous read.     In Peeps, vampirism is actually a sort of disease that can be transmitted through saliva and... other bodily fluids... ahem... Anyway, its about this Vampire, although they don't call them that. They call them 'Parasite-positives'. Peeps for short. So, this guy Cal, only carries the disease, the symtoms don't affect him. The problem is, he's infected all of his past girlfriends. So he has to hunt them down and find them before they can do any damage to the peoples of NYC.
