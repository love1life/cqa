But the first time I used it with my DSLR, I realized it was not strong enough to hold the camera when I was tilting back to get things like the moon or high in the trees. I also noticed the pivots didn't move smoothly.       Unfortunately, when I look at tripods they all look the same - except some are black. The only noticeable difference is the price. Any tips or specific recommendations would be appreciated.

20090309130338AA46mGr	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wiimote Charging Stations?	I have been using a charging station for my wiimotes for the last two years. I got this charging station and two battery packs from a company called 4gamers and these have always been reliable until just last month. I thought this was just the batteries coming to the end of their life having been recharged so much.      Last week I bought a new wiimote charging station with two brand new Rechargeable battery packs and these ones are immediately not working. Oddly though if I just insert two AA batteries into my wiimotes they are fine and respond no problem.      I just find this very strange having developed so suddenly after two years and also due to the fact I purchased new battery packs. Does anyone know if there is a particular fault within the wiimotes which causes this or has anyone else experienced a similar problem?      Any feedback would be very greatly appreciated.

It says "Are you sure you want to delete?"  You have to push a yellow triangle button for yes, and it isn't on this remote and I cannot figure out which button to push.      It is a One For All Universal Remote Control URC 3021.      Is there a way to reprogram my cable box so it doesn't ask the "Are you sure" question?

I've seen macro lenses for iPhone, but not for any other kinds of cell phones.  In theory, all I would need is a lens of the correct diopter held at the correct distance to make this work. Could anyone tell me how to calculate this and find the right sized lenses so I can just build an housing that will hold it at the right distance?

20090309141633AAAteZF	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Camera with nearly good quality as DSLR/SLR cameras?	- Shutter speeds, At least 10 seconds, and at least 1/2000   - ISO, at least low as 100, at least high as 3200   - Good video quality w/audio (don't know where to start on this).   - Price range: No more than $350.         I'm looking for a camera where I can shoot great pictures, not trying to go all with the 'professional' look and quality, but great enough that to 'regular' people the photos seem good as if it was taken with DSLR/SLR cameras. Also I'm probably going to be playing with shutter speeds. As for video, I'm probably going to do music videos (again I don't want it to be all professional) I just want something to shoot around and do production with that will look great with quality. With the audio, I know some of you might mention blue tooth/ wireless microphone for music videos, but I'm going to edit 100% of the audio out and replacing it with the audio music anyways so I don't need a camera compatible of having that feature. But I'd still like a camera with a microphone and audio feature just so I can shoot at parties or when I'm bored doing video blogs and such.      I'm not looking to go all greatly expensive. Don't show me camera's that or more than what's my expecting price range. I pushed it from 250 - 350 already. I don't need for anyone to say " for only 100 or 150 more you can get this" Because If I'm going to spend anywhere near $500 I mine as well just get an expensive DSLR, and I'm not looking to do that, I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know some what about photography knowledge which I picked up from a class I took in high school (which wasn't that many years ago).      Thanks..

20090309151641AAo1Brl	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Should I give away my cell phone?	We bought a fourth line for our daughter to get used to using a phone, (she is 6), but she forgets its even in the house because its so small. We decided getting a regular land line would be better (though the cell was saving us like $20/month).      I've been trying to sell our cell phone with contract (craigslist & ebay), but no one wants the phone if they have to take over the contract. Should I just give the phone away with contact? We paid over $100 for the phone, but to cancel the cell phone plan would be $300. It seems like either way I'm out of a lot of money. :(      What do you think?

So i was trying to get the phone working and it asked to sign into my google account so i enter my name and pass. Then it says my sim card is not provisioned for data services. So that means i cannot sign into google while using the prepaid sim card. So my question is, is there some other way to sign in or activate the google services from a computer until i can get into the phone to connect it to wifi? i can borrow a friends sim card and want to make sure that will work?

20090309154508AAJUNOl	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	CCTV CAMERA TV SCREEN ERRORS?	I recently purchased a simple wired cctv surveillance camera. Installing it was no problem. I needed 30 meters of wire from my front door to my tv set. In between i had to add some wire so i therefore soldered some lengths. The camera works well. Even the sound.   BUT i am constantly getting these two fuzzy lines on the screen which keep on going up and down the screen. They are very annoying. Is it maybe due to the fact that the wire is 30 meters long? The camera does actually work well because when i directly connected it to my tv it was 100% clear!. Or maybe is it the type of wire i used for it? (i used phone wire as it has 4 wires. I used 2 for video and 2 for audio).         I am really frustrated. Can anyone try and help and guide me please?

I've been mainly looking at Canon PowerShots due to the CHDK software available for many of them. Three of my good friends have the SD1100, which are only about $150 and take good quality pictures. Would it be worth it to get a more expensive camera than that?

20090227100415AAeAIDC	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Which ps3 did I get? 80 or 40 gb?	I won a eBay auction for a used ps3 40gb with spiderman 3 blu ray. The winning bid was $260.00 it included the retail box and all contents including manuals. Other than the box being all taped up It could have passed as brand new. I hooked the system up and saw that it had a capacity of 74gb, which leads me to believe this is an 80gb model! I don't know how to tell besides the USB ports but I hear the new 80 gigs have 2 USB ports. That is what I have 2 ports and a silver face slot where the disk goes in. Could this have an aftermarket hd in it or could they have given me a 80gb instead of 40? Whatever the case Im happy system runs quiet and it looked brand new out the box. I'm not trying to mention the mixup when I leave feedback. They may ask for it back

20090227100356AAlvubq	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	I'm not impressed with my new film camera.?	I need some help.   I just bought a lomography fisheye camera. The most basic kind.   It cost about 60 dollars.   I got the film developed and it had a brownish tinge to it, and very grainy.   What can i do to keep this from happening?   Better film?   Maybe the person who developed them for me did a bad job.   I'm so used to digital cameras.   oh and there is a flash on it.

Preferably I would like Killzone 2 to be included in the bundle. When I say best this mainly means in terms of value but bundles are also viable with good selection of games.
