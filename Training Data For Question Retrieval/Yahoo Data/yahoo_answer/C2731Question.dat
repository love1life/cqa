20090309232600AAWktal	Pets;Dogs	So... When a dog becomes aggressive and you can't trust him anymore... What do you do?	This last week has been really hard with my animals and my oldest dog suddenly becoming aggressive isn't helping.   He ripped into my foster puppy over a bone and then bit my room mate,  and he has broken my other dogs leg, first he attacked and bruised the bone, the next day after being separated I walked away for 10 minutes and heard shrieks to find him doing it again, this time his leg was broken.   This isn't food aggression, it comes from no where.   He will do this in front of my room mate but not me.   The vet said and my trainer said, there is nothing they can do about it except keep them separated.   He gets plenty of attention and exercise, and he is submissive to me.   WHAT DO I DO?!

20090225091542AAYml8s	Pets;Cats	My cat has bilirubin in his urine and is having a blood test for liver problems?	Took my Kitty in for his yearly check up and he had been having loose stools. Dr. started with bladder test first as his urine pattern had changed in the litter box (more in the middle than on the side, more like a saucer shape, may have no bearing?) The urine test showed small amts of bilirubin which I guess reflects something from the liver. So he is going in today for a blood test to see what that shows. Nothing I can do until then, just wondering what you all know about it. Looked on Internet...all I find is fat liver disease, can be treated, can be fatal. How bad is this? Do I drive my self nuts? Treatment says I may have to inject food into him? IDK. Hope he will be ok. Other than that...he has not changed, he is 6 1/2. He is eating and drinking well. Water has not increased. Very active. Indoor cat. His name is Wilson! He is so hungry right now! They said no food after midnite. Poor kitty! THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE, MY CAT FRIENDS!

20090225093307AAPoV0M	Pets;Cats	I'm getting worried about my kitten.  Any advice?	OK, my daughter's boyfriend gave us his 6 mo old kitten because his mother is allergic.  I also have a 9 yr old Bombay, male.  I took her on a trial basis because my older cat is very territorial and I didn't know how he would react.  Today will make 1 wk.  When she first got here, she seemed so happy to have another cat to play with.  The older cat took to her right away, which shocked me.  Anyway, she has been a tiny bundle of energy as all kittens are and up until today, she would play, eat, pounce on the other cat etc.  Today, she doesn't seem interested in her food.  I'm giving her the food her former owner gave her.  She loves the way I mix the hard with canned.  She would gobble it up in no time.  Today, she's not interested in eating, or playing anything.  She's just moping and sleeping.  Her nose is not dry, clear eyes, I couldn't see any ear mites.  Is she just plain pooped out from all the playing she's done this last week?   She loves the older cat and she doesn't miss the former owner either because he came over yesterday and the day before and when he picked her up, she paid no attention to him.  She was looking at the older cat and just wanted to play.  I'm a little worried.  She is such a sweetheart and I don't want to see her get sick.  Before anyone tell me to take her to the vet, she has her first appt, next week.  Thank you everyone

Hi i have 2 Lovebirds and i am breeding them (don't tell me not to please) but i have to make the decision whether too hand feed them or let the parents feed them.

How often to i need to hand feed them?   What formula is the best?   How much do i feed them?   Do i need to feed them in the night?   When do i pull them from the nest?   And finally... Do i need to keep them in a separate cage or with the parents after i have hand fed them?      If you can answer any of these questions i would be very grateful, thank you.

Requirements:   *Broke very well, and doesn't buck offen.   *Does well both bareback and with a saddle.   *Older Mare, preferable Quarter Horse, or Paint.   *Goes on trails, and jumps small logs and such.   *Would do well with kids.

20090225094400AAcplS5	Pets;Dogs	Is there a chance of winning a small claims case against a unregistered dog breeder?	I bought a pit bull pup from a guy claiming to be a breeder for $300 last week. He told me he would give me papers on the dog but 'they wont be in til next week' and that the dog had all of his 'puppy shots'. The night I first brought him home the pup had diarrhea and I called the guy I bought the dog from and notified him of it and he told me it was probably b/c I switched the dog food so I went out and bought the same food he fed the dog. The dog continued to get sicker and on the 6th day of having him I took him to the vet where they informed me of the pup having parvo and that there was little chance of survival due to the pups condition when I brought him in. Sad to say we had to put the pup to sleep. I called and kept the dog breeder informed the whole time and at first he agreed to refunding me my money for the pup. Last night his story changed he said that the dog couldn't have had parvo b/c he got him vaccinated and if he did thats not his problem b/c he has papers to prove it so all I asked for was for him to prove it by meeting me at a location and giving me copies of the pup shot records but he refused so I informed him I will be taking him to court. Does anyone think I have a case? I also have text message conversations between us two with him saying the dog had his shots and me informing him the pup had diarrhea the same day I bought him! I know it was kind of dumb of me to buy the dog with no contract but thats what happens sometimes when your excited, anxious, and desperate!!!

20090225082013AAwL5WD	Pets;Horses	Pulling my horse trailer...?	Ok so currently I have 2 horse trailers and 2 trucks. when we started out my dad already owned an SUV (BMW 4.8 X5) so we had a truck and just needed a trailer so we bought a 2 horse straight load warmblood size with a tack room exiss trailer (obvi. bumper pull). we loved it.   we then got more horses and were traveling more so we got a 6 horse goose neck (i was showing about 5 horses every weekend in season) straight load WB size exiss trailer and an f.450 to pull it.       we are now down sizing again and no longer have thef.450 or the 6 horse trailer. we still have the BMW and the BP trailer. i was just wondering what everyones view as BP vs. GN were. do you have a preference as far as safety, handling etc? i never really had a proplem with my BP but really did enjoy driving the biger rig with the GN. it was a breeze to drive and i always felt totally in control. I trailer my horses (currently 2 of them) to my trainers 3 times a week. where i live it is very "hilly" and although it is most highway driving part of the drive is on a two lane, "hilly" drive and i alsways get worried pulling my horses with a BP. i just fele like i have this hught truck and this huge trailer held together by a little "ball" just seems unsafe         anyway, this isnt really a question its just a "preference"       either way i'm planning on getting an f.350 (normal body style, not a dually) and a 2 horse WB size exiss GN trailer.         thanks in advance for advice, opinions, stories etc.

My shih tzu has bad skin and the groomer sells the entire Merrick line but she also said that Nature's Variety is great too and another groomer nearby sells it and suggested trying both so I know she is being fair.        I won't buy online or through a catalog and these are the only two better foods I can buy in my area without driving at least 150 miles.  Except of course hills from the vet which I won't do for various reasons.      Money IS a factor.  and I know each dog is different.  Which one should I start with first and how long should I give it to see a difference?  before going to the other brand.      My shih tzu is 14 so I'm going with canned.  Groomer recommends Merrick wilderness blend for hypoallergenic reasons.  I haven't spoken with the other groomer who sells Nature's variety.      This is all so confusing to me.  He was on Purina One for years but he needs as my groomer says, real food, and it will help his skin plus other things as well.       Thanks in advance.

20070413210726AAhLxfW	Pets;Dogs	Dog ear infections?	I just cleaned my black lab's ears. They were a good bit dirty, but with actual dirt. xD There was also some brown gunk 'n stuff in them. But in her ear canal, it was COMPLETELY clean. Not even a dot of gunk or dirt in the canal, itself. So, that means that she doesn't have an ear infection anymore, right? She had infections in both her ears a few months ago, and I had cleaned them and took care of them and I got rid of the infection in one ear completely, but the other one was still just barely dirty in the canal. Well, I got lazy, and stopped cleaning her ears. (I had been doing it for 2-3 months) I would, and still do, clean them with vinegar water. I looked in them with my magnifying ear thingy... Like the doctors use for people. xP (Dunno what it's called) And her ear canals were perfectly clean, and I swished them with some v/water to make sure. She shook her head, I checked again, and nothing had come out. Sooo, does that mean she doesn't have an ear infection?

20070910101106AAHfAH1	Pets;Dogs	My post about Japanese Chins mixed with Boston Terriers & Frenchies?	Hey, I would like to apologize for my post, it did sound very irresponsible. I would like to mention that me and my mother thought of the idea because it would be exciting. I used the word "fun", but I should not have because I used it in the wrong way.      I would also like to mention that we were going to do it to create an excellent new breed, Not to just create mixes. We are not stupid, and we care enough about dogs to not make a selfish decision. We did not want to do it for the money. My grandfather worked as a manager of a successful petstore where he bred birds who ended up having very good temperments, and he did it to benefit bird lovers.      Me and my mother are NOT going to create mixes, we have decided to POSSIBLY breed boston terriers with boston terriers, and jap. chins with jap. chins, in order to perfect the breed, but even that is not a definite.      Please remember to be nice in the future rather than expressing complete hate. Thank you.

Wir haben momentan eine Hündin und einen Rüden. Unsere Hündin haben wir ohne Papiere gekauft und sie hat leider HD (Hüftgelenksdysplasie) und unseren Rüden haben wir vom Züchter (crazybandits.de) und er ist kerngesund. Nur zu empfehlen! Trotzdem überlegen wir unseren Nachwuchshund von einem anderen Züchter zu holen. Deshalb bitte ich um Eure Erfahrungen. Sollte es einen Homepage geben, dann bitte angeben.    Was machen wir mit dem Hund?   Er kommt in einen liebevolle Familie mit zwei hundeerfahrenen Kindern. Der Hund wird, wie unsere zwei anderen auch, zum Rettungshund für die Fl?chensuche ausgebildet und auch aktiv darin t?tig sein. Arbeitsbereitschafft sollte schon da sein. Bin wirklich auf Eure Erfahrungen gespannt!   Noch kurz ein Wort: Im Internet nach Züchtern suchen kann ich selber. Ich m?chte Auskünfte von Leuten, die einen Labbi vom Züchter haben bzw. im unmittelbaren Umfeld. Danke!

When my dad decides to take him out for the day either to the park or horseback riding, he tends to follow and be with my dad for days. Its like he forgets that his bed is in my room and ignores me.      Usually, he knows I'm the caregiver, so he knows to come to me for everything.       When I take him out daily, he tends to forget my dad and hangs out w/me.       Why do dogs behave this way?

Am I taking the right steps in getting them together? Thanks!
20081114054800AAv833z	Pets;Cats	I am very worried I'm not being a good cat owner. Please help.?	I have had my new kitten for nearly 2 weeks now. He is a 3 month old Himalayan. I also have an 11 month old neutered male Persian. The first week I had my kitten he was very social, purred constantly and was not afraid of people. I have now noticed that he is purring less (only at night in bed with me and in the mornings when we are together before I leave for work, and when he is very calm). He is also a bit skiddish around mother and a little bit around me. He is alone with my 11 month old during the day while I am at work. What could have caused this behavior change in him? Have I done something wrong in socializing him? Any advice or suggestions as to what's happening is greatly appreciated because I do not want him to be shy and skiddish. If there is something I can do please let me know. Thank you!!      Also, I should mentioned I've been putting Christmas decorations up around the house. Could this change be having some effect on him?

20090225095632AA3Hyte	Pets;Other - Pets	6 week only fancy mouse problem?	We have had "Dakota" for about 9 days--we got her and her sister when they were 5 weeks from a reputable pet store.      From the start she was the runt and while her sister seems to be growing and is always running and playing, Dakota just sits quietly in your hand and isn't showing signs of getting bigger.      She does seem to drink a lot and does eat well enough.  She will on occasion run in her wheel but mostly she likes to just sit in your hand and nuzzle you.        She's darling and we're all in love with her, but none more than our nine year old daughter.  There is starting to be a feeling that something isn't "right" with her and many tears are flowing.      What should I look for and is there anything that springs to mind that could be wrong with her?  Or is there a chance that this is just her personality?  We've never had mice before so I don't have any comparisons.      Thank you for any guidance you can offer.

Yesterday, a friend brought his Guinea Pig to me because he didn't feel okay trimming her nails (they're black) and since I'm experienced with trimming black nails he brought her to me. The problem is that the quick is already at the tip of the nail and I just couldn't do much, I just cut a little piece of the nail, but still her nails are too long. Is there any way to make the quick go back, like keep cutting the tips until it can be trimmed to a normal size when the quick gets short or is there something else that could be done?

20090225093325AAlEi56	Pets;Reptiles	My bearded dragon just layed about 20 or more eggs. How wet does the substrate have to be keep, moist or wet?	I have a birth box with vermiculite.  After she is done laying the eggs, how wet do I keep the substrate?  I am going to put a lid on the box with holes in the top of it.  What should the humidity be in the birthing box with the eggs? The temp in the box is about 86, is that ok.

My freind suggested that I put a smaller (10 gallon) aquarium in it and fill the rest with dirt so it is level, but im not sure if that would work. Any suggestions?
20090225100235AA2VRCJ	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat getting sick since we got a puppy?	We got a puppy yesterday, and I noticed this morning that my cat had gotten sick in the hall way, then again right as I was walking out the door. She has never done this before, is she just stressed because of the new puppy? Or can she be allergic to the puppy? What else can it be?
20090225100641AAMGTfe	Pets;Horses	Travelling bandages?Can you help?	I was recently at a big saddlery sale and bought a lot of stuff! One of the things I bought was bandagesx5.I bought them for very cheap as they had been reduced and didn't look at them too closely. They're kind of elastic/stretchy and have a string to tie them with. I know you can definately use them as tail guards but I also want to use them for travelling wraps.Can I do this and if so do i need to put anything under them on the ponys leg? Thanks

20090225100907AAT8Izy	Pets;Dogs	I have a 2 year old maltichon and about to own a male neutered daschund?	So, I've been reading alot of google postings, etc.. I even prod and cond this in and out.  In the long run goign out on a trip will be a hassle because my parents don't like dogs and will never take care of them for me and friends i do not have except for the people upstairs.  They also got 2 dogs.  I am recieving unemployment and looking for a job and my boyfriend with whom i live is working.  My boyfriend financially said we'd be fine and he thinks its okay to get another dog.   Would this be a wise move to have another dog meaning i would own 2 dogs? How hard is it to find an apt. that will allow me to have 2 dogs? I don't mind the cleaning, walking, i got an excellent groomer and the best part the dog is small.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated!      Thanks
