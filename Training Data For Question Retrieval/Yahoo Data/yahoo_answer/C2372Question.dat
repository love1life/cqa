I wrote to a professor who I was thinking of taking a class with in the summer cause I wanted to know what kind of background in the subject she felt was appropriate for her students. I also talked about my background and asked her a few other things and she replied right away with one word... "No."   I was like What??   So then I replied back and said, "Can you please clarify what you mean by NO? and she replied back and said that the courses I took are not considered appropriate pre-requisites and that I wont be able to take the class.   Why the hell is she so rude?

Maybe as to ask them indirectly somehow? How would she react if she thought I knew or suspected it?       Please be polite as you can in your answers, I'd really appreciate it.

20090227162238AAMKUvM	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Grad school application question: if 250 is the suggested minimum for the essay, then...?	how long should my essay really be?  I'm guessing a 250 MINIMUM [as opposed to MAXIMUM] means that writing 250 words is just getting bu.  My take is that if I want to show the grad school that I am very interested in pursuing my field and that I have goals, I should probably write MORE than 250 words,  However, though a maximum word count isn't given, I know writing too much can irritate the admissions people.  So what would you recommend for world length in order to write a decent, solid application essay?

I was in school today and I was fine in the morning.    then I went to science and I had to print some homework off by the end of the day for my teacher, i did it straight after the lesson, but as I went to hand it in I was shaking uncontrollably I ran off and I didn't go back, then I went to my next lesson, I had history, we were just watching a dvd, and taking notes, half way through the lesson I got a note from my music teacher, asking me to see her at lunch time.   I have been involved in music a lot throughout the past 2 years, recently though, I don't know why, maybe because of bullying, I have been really quiet, as I was leaving a lesson, a few weeks ago, she asked me what was wrong and I said nothing, so she just said okay.   she put me down for singing in a competition, even though I had told her I didn't want to do it, I was too nervous and I don't think I'm good enough.   anyway, when I got there I stood outside for a while, trying to calm myself down, but I went in, regardless, she closed the door, and just started with, okay, one of the reasons I've called you here is because the woodwind teacher would like you to return your instrument, I decided I was terrible at it,and that I couldn't carry on trying to play it. so I said okay, she then closed the door fully and moved further away from it, I stood there and she sat in her chair, at this point I started shaking, she said she was very worried about me, that my confidence had dropped, that I wasn't the same person I used to be and that everyone was worried about me, she asked how my grades were and I told her I had a 96% on science, 94% on maths, so she said okay. she continued for a while, saying this and more, I continued to shake,uncontrollably, trying my best to hide it, she said she knew I'd had a hard time with the girls in my class, and told me that I was always welcome to go up to her room at break etc, I couldn't of course, it'd make me feel like a huge social outcast. so I insisted that I was fine, but I continued to shake, I felt my knees weaken, but I managed to keep myself looking normal.   she mentioned that I didn't do a lot in her cass the day before, "I was talking" I lied.then I said I had started again a few times too, also a lie, I had spent the lesson staring at my piece of paper, thinking.   she said the usual, any problems see me, that sort of thing, etc etc.   I said okay, she just said come and see me on monday, I'll help you pick a song for this competition, even though, I don't even remember agreeing to do it, I just said okay, and goodbye and all that stuff, and left, but I don't know why I was shaking, at such silly little things, like handing in a piece of paper and going to see my music teacher, who is also in charge of the more able and talented group, last year I got up on stage and sang, and I wasn't even nervous before hand, now, well, I am, very nervous, any ideas why this is?   thank you   Surfysez      oh and I did hand in the science homework, but I waited until my science teacher had gone home, and a caretaker let me in, and I put it into the box, what do I say,sorry sir, I came but I was too scared to hand in a piece of paper???   how pathetic am I ):   he's the sarcastic type who wouldn't understand :(   the kind of person who reads your testmarks out in class,which has never been a problem for me, as a straight A student, but for others it is very embarrassing, he insists that the people who have struggled with a topic, were too lazy to revise, and I just don't know what to do,   what should I do?   any ideas why I was shaking?   please help!      thanks a lot!!!      thanks for reading also, I realize it's long, but I don't know why I'd shake about this, especially considering, I used to be so confident!   why would I shake, I'd not usually be nervous about this, also, I've found myself flinching when anybody comes near me, I don't know why, I just dont trust any of my friends, when i do they just laugh, but it's pretty weird.   DON'T ANSWER IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TELL ME IT'S TOO LONG!!!!

I am also in the IB program and volunteer extensively to go along with some AP classes on the side. I am Asian by the way.  I scored at 750 on the Math PSAT and low 600s on the Reading/Writing.       By the way, does having your grades go up during the course of high school make you have a higher chance or is it negligable?    I had many B's in freshman year, but I have been painfully pulling straight A's for the last 2 semesters. This is reverse when I asked my friends about theirs. All of theirs went down.

I've been accepted into both social work programs for my masters, but I do not know which one to choose. U of C is ranked 3rd according to US News and BC is ranked 14th. They are both competitive schools to get into, and I've heard that BC is quickly climbing the rankings ladder in all fields. I could see myself living in both cities, although I like Chicago a little more in terms of the feel of the city. I do have a lot of friends going to Chicago, but I know I would easily be able to make friends in Boston. I might eventually like to go and get my Ph.D. in Sociology, so I know U of C would look better when applying to programs in the future, but I'm sure I could still get into a school if I went to BC. So tell me:   -what are the pros and cons of living in both cities   -where would you choose to go to and why   -which is a better city for a single woman in her early twenties to be in.

20090227171833AAEw9qi	Education & Reference;Teaching	Class Problems, what should I do?	I'm a third year civil engineering major who is having schedule problems for next quarter. Basically, our university requires a course for graduation (CEE 103), but the course is only offered once a year in the Spring. No one offers this course over the summer. Moreover, 103 is a prerequisite for another course (CEE 135A) that is only offered during the Fall Quarter. Also, 135A is a prerequisite for a list of courses I need for graduation. So, no 103 equals no 135A equals no graduation. There's about 15 other kids in the same position as me. I talked to a counselor and he said they have limited resources and they can't do anything about it. If they have limited resources why would they accept so many students? He also told me that I should change the emphasis of my degree, or come back and drop another twenty grand for a fifth year (dude's a moron). I emailed the professor and he told me he can't do anything. What should I do? Who can I talk to? Can the department chair do anything? If I email the department chair what should I say to him? Personally, I think this entire situation is a load of ****.

A Chinook salmon has a maximum underwater speed of 3.0m/s, and can jump out of the water vertically with a speed of 6.0m/s. A record salmon has a length of 1.5 m and a mass of 61kg. When swimming upward at constant speed, and neglecting buoyancy, the fish experiences three forces: an upward for F exerted by the tail fin, the downward drag force of the water, and the downward force of gravity. As the fish leaves the surface of the water, however, it experiences a net upward force causing it to accelerate from 3.0m/s to 6.0m/s. Assuming that the drag force disappears as soon as the head of the fish breaks the surface and that F is exerted until 2/3 of the fish's length has left the water, determine the magnitude of F.

20090225101915AAPqmRq	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is this a good short story? (a school assignment)?	ok i'm an engineering major i totally suck at reading and writing i work better with numbers. this is for my comp class we have to write first 3 paragraphs of a short story, i couldn't think of any so i wrote something that really happen. now is this a good story if so what is the focus, setting, voice      For three days now I have been coming home as soon as I can from school to check the mail before my mom gets her hands on it. Every day after school I rush to my car and try to get home as soon as I can some days I skip the last class so I can get home in time before 2.00pm which is when my mom leave home to go to work, and she check the mail every day right before she leave. For almost three days I was driving home sweating having a weird feeling in my gut and picturing that my mom will be by the door with her glasses on and her hands on her hips, mad ready to yell at me.     The reason I want to check the mail is because I failed three of my classes. And every time we fail a class they send a letter home to our parents. Luckily I took a graphic design class last year and a bootleg version of Photoshop so I can make a fake report card and give it to my mom I have don’t it a couple times and so far she haven’t caught me.     I came home on time just when I came home the mail arrived and I started to go through the mail. And finally there it was a very letter from my school, I kept the rest of the letter aside and quickly hid the letter in my pants, because my pockets were full and there was no other place to hide it. And when I turn around there was my mom. She smiled and said “ what did you hide in your pants”, I had no choice but to give her the letter, knowing that as soon as she read it I’m going to be in a lot of trouble specially I already gave her the report card that has two B’s and three A’s.

20090225101749AApF186	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Senior Project Trouble: What should I write about from this topic?	My senior projects are coming up. My first idea was to do tattooing since it is one of my keen interests, and for my demonstration I was going to record me getting my tattoo done and the aftercare and interviews with the artist. Well my teacher laughed in my face about it and pretty much told me to blow it out my....well...wagon.      So my dad gave me a cool new idea. He runs the restaraunt out at the Zoo outside of town and he knows that the keepers do career days where they bring animals out of the zoo to schools etc. and my dad said he talked to the keepers and that they would love to do that. The only problem I have with this is that I don't know what my exact them could be. Zoo keeping? Veternary? Exotic animal care and handling? What could my overall idea be for bring a zoo animal to my school? What points should I cover?

20090225102127AAW95rJ	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	How does the financial aid department at a university configure my need for financial aid?	I have been putting out so many financial aid and tax questions lately, so I thank everyone for their answers, they've been a lot of help.  But of course I have another one so here goes.        I understand that the fafsa configures my EFC and that it is used to determine my need for financial aid.  But since I also have Florida Prepaid College Plan, I know that they will lessen my need for aid.  However FPCP doesn't pay for everything and often times there is often about $300 or more left over, plus books and living expenses, even though I live at home and work.  My question is, is that all I'm going to get?  The $300 or so left over?  How do most universities determine a student's need for financial aid?  If it helps, I will be attending as a full time junior at Florida Atlantic University, living with my parents.  Thanks again yahoo community!

20090225102925AAtnoht	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Do you think my essay is good?	PERSONAL OPINION ESSAY        Can love survive without money? With today’s economy many relationships are being Put through the test of the oath we once took in our marriage vows in “sickness and in health for richer or poorer”. With unemployment on the rise and ressesion crisis worldwide we also see a high increase in divorce rate.    It seems that many people tend to forget about the love they once shared for one another before getting married. The hopes and dreams we once shared with each other seem to overcome any major obstacles that would get in the way.  But over time the pressures of life, work, kids and bills will make many forget about that love that kept them together. Tired and weak love becomes fragile and venerable and the lost of a job can be traumatic and stressful event that shakes the foundation of many venerable marriages.    Love is a powerful feeling that one feels towards one another. Let’s not forget when we took that holy oath towards each other on that wedding day. Money is important for survival of a marriage but more importantly is the love that we share for each other. A person can have all the riches in this world but without love life can be a lonely place.

20090225102806AA4Vhts	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I contact the school regarding school staff yelling at children although I am not a parent?	I live on the third floor of a condominium complex that is directly across from an elementary school. I am at home during the early recess hour on most days and I noticed that I could hear adults on the play ground yelling to/at the children. The noises of the play ground don’t bother me but this woman’s tone and volume is just too much. I observed the adults who were supposed to be watching the children sitting on a bench on one end of the playground yelling to children on the other side. I have worked daycare in my younger years and we were never, unless under urgent circumstances, allowed to scream anything to the children, nor were we allowed to sit in one spot. I am not a parent so; do I have a right to email the schools principal about my concerns?
