ERVib5gYaa	I'm not sure but you would be better off looking for a farm and then contacting them via email or something. I live in London and the only farms I know here are ones in Kent so I would try outside London. If you can't call them, write or email them and explain your situation .. that you want to 'intern' or whatever. Summer is quite far away so I am sure they will get back to you before then.  Yell is a pretty credible website.. so take your pick and good luck.  http://www.yell.com/ucs/UcsSearchAction....
SU6AP3t5aa	the job market is down in florida and there are so many people looking for jobs you would be better off babysitting
RDVr1wTbaa	okay, so im probably a little bias because i live like ten minutes away from san francisco, but i would definitely pick san francisco. yes, the weather is much colder and more windy than catalina, but san francisco is so unique and is so famous worldwide-- anyone who lives in california should definitely go to san francisco. And by looking at your list, looks like you'll see a lot; but dont forget to go to ghiradelli's square, chinatown, and pier 39-- those are my favorite places in the city!! (oh and just to let you know, san francisco doesnt have a real subway system, so dont go out of the way looking for that-- but the trolleys are a must!)  as for hotels, it is difficult to go for nice and cheap-- especially with california's sky-high real estate prices. and also, many hotels charge extra for a room with a good view. but if you are willing to splurge on hotels, hotel vitale is the BEST, but its super expensive. but any hotel on the embarcadero would be good, because they are right on the water, with views of the ferry building and the bay bridge--- also a short taxi/bus ride to any tourist destination  hope you have fun, wherever you decide to go!!!|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Catalina is nice for a day trip, but it's so small that you can see all the sights in one day. The harbor is a marine preserve so you can't swim, or fish there. You're restricted to a glass bottom boat ride. Snorkeling is done on the far side of the island.     For a vacation you will like San Francisco much better. Just take a sweater. The evenings can get chilly and foggy.   Save Catalina for a day trip.|`|MtANnIlfaa	San Francisco is very eccentric. You will see all, and i mean ALL types of people there. So if you all are conservative i wouldn't suggest going to SF. Though it is loads of fun if you are open-minded. I personally would go with SF.|`|fAKKv0ytaa	San Fran has a lot to do.

It helps, too, if you speak another language already, one similar to French (Italian, Spanish, etc)    I'd suggest you totally immerse yourself in French, watch French TV, read French news papers, find some French friends, and go out of your way to try to speak French (anything! even just a "bonjour") to really get 'into it'.    You can even start now, from TO.  Get some newspapers (online, even), and watch RDI, try to glean something from what you're reading/watching.    As for jobs, depends on what you can do.  You won't get anything working with the public.  You HAVE to speak French.

Egyptians either Christians or Muslims are good lovers and life partners. You have all logic reasons to get married to him. (According to what you mentioned)    I'm Egyptian myself with many friends from all over the world and I've met many cultures. Ask women who are married to an Egyptian, ask expats who are living here with their Egyptian husbands. They will tell you almost the same.     Don't listen to those answers (Es... and M..), those are haters to Egyptians and they don't know anything about them.

However don't burn your boats. if you have a european property, don't sell it, rent it out. Keep reserve funds back home. I woudl also say live in your home country as it's so much easier.    In Egypt, before you sign anything, get the document in Arabic, and take it (by yourself, this is important) to your embassy to get it translated into your language, with an official embassy stamp. if you are happy, signed the arabic version of the document you had translated at the embassy, ***NOT ANY OTHER COPY***.    Keep all copies of this paperwork yourself, do not let your husband hold any copies of anything.     if you buy any real estate in Egypt, do the same with the property contracts.|`|bnRDldxbaa	I know what you mean, i had the same from many people i knew when i married my Egyptian husband, it wont last, holiday romance, he's after your money, & he wants to live in UK.   If your head (not your heart) is not flashing warning lights, then trust your instinct, but keep your mind open for any signals. Its being careful you know, & as you said, do protect your business, i'd do that for any Englishmen too.  On a positive note, i did all those things, (even had him checked out), & i was one of the lucky ones. We have now been married 7 & half yrs, i practically had to force him to come back to England with me (after i had lived in Luxor 2 yrs), he earns more than me now & is still totally faithful & loving to me, he's a good man.  I have found him to be hard working, lots of fun, honest & never afraid to show me how much he loves me, i'm one lucky woman.  I hope that you are as lucky with your man as i have been with mine, good luck.    PS. one tip = communicate. You are both of such different cultures & religions that talking is very important to understand each other, i think its how we have made it this far.   My hubby said i turned his world up-side-down when i took him to England to live, so be prepared if he hates it at first, Khal loves it now (5 years on).|`|iQjS2lJ4aa	Don't listen to the haters, especially mohammed.

I myself am Coptic.  My brother actually got married to an American woman (I live in the US).  They've only been married for 4 months - but they love each other and everything is going great with them.  She was originally Catholic, but she too converted to the Coptic Orthodox Church.      I'll be perfectly honest - inter-ethnic marriages are great, but the cultural differences do in fact complicate matters moreso than if you had married within your own ethnicity.  They present more challenges, but the challenges can be met if you and he are willing to put the effort.      Just to give a few pointers... Coptic people are EXTREMELY religious!  So if you're not that religious, than his family may not be entirely accepting of you.  Also, they have extremely conservative views on marriage and family (as do many others from that part of the globe).  So don't expect to have any girl's-night-outs or "time alone".  In Coptic culture, it is inappropriate for a woman to go anywhere by herself without her husband acompanying her.  Don't expect to party at any night clubs or go to any bars - as that too is not acceptable.      The bottom line is this - if you feel that you love him and he loves you, than by all means get married!  I hope I was able to help.  If you need any more advice or like to know more about Coptic culture, feel free to e-mail me anytime.  You can do so by clicking on my username, then by choosing "E-mail Memory Alpha" on the profile page.  Congratulations once again!  I hope you have a great wedding and many wonderful years together!|`|BsE3xGpraa	Him being Christian or Muslim makes no difference, Egyptians are really the same, even in religion both are very religious!

nFV0LAudaa	Have you tried priceline yet? I use it all the time to name my own price. You can select the number of stars for the hotel you want, and a relative location of the hotel. Name the price you are willing to pay and select the hotels thats offered. I've used it numerous times when I travel around the USA and have got super deals! Worth checking it out!    I think its one of the best sites for hotels if you are after a bargain. I'm sure there are others out there, but I've search high and low this is my most recommended one.    Remember you have to use the name your own price to get the best deals! Hope that helps

Q3RqWHFsaa	Omakase means you give all discretion of the way to be served for the restaurant chef including the procedure, price and volume.    You ought not ask any question except the ingredients or how to eat the dishes. Before starting to order, you'd better declare him your favorites and unfavorites as specifically as possible such as octpuss, squid, shells, shrimps, seaweed, sea urchin roe, salmon roe etc etc.    In addition, if you are weak to Wasabi, Japanese horseradish as condiment, you must ask him not to use it in advance.    You can't ask second helping even if you like some of them very much because the preparation is perfect and no additional stocks are usually available. All dishes are not appearing all together one time but as French dinner as in order one by one so that you have to take some rythmical consumption of each dish  for next dishes.    If you can't try some plates because of taste, you may decline those but all are charged even if you don't touch anything. Your positive comment including how to cook sushi would be highly appreciated by the chef.     On starting to eat the first dish, Japanese says "Itadakimasu"as greeting and appreciation. You may say so to the chef and the words "Gochisoo sama deshita" as same as I really enjoyed in the end are both also quite modest manner in Japan. It doesn't matter if Omakase or not though.|`|MtI4uZEyaa	Never forget to tell your budget at the beginning, otherwise, you'll be charged incredibly high price.

It will be weighed at the counter, if within the weight range, a destination sticker will be put on it and it will be taken (or on a conveyor belt). You will see it again at your destination at the luggage carousel. This baggage should not have your passport, money, tickets etc that you will need - these should be in your cabin / hand luggage - usually handbag / backpack size - will be taken with you onto the plane. Before that however, you will have to go through security, which will screen your bag's contents. Bag will be put onto a conveyor belt and you will walk through a sensor. Make sure you do not have any sharp implements or liquids in this bag - they will be confiscated for safety reasons - they should be in your checked baggage.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Checked baggage is your big suitcase.

We have an official La Coste store in One Utama, Damansara Utama @ ground floor.    I have no idea whether is it the biggest or not but that's the only la coste store i know in Klang Valley so far.
PV1GN6wNaa	Santorini is famous for this. You can do it during the winter/autumn/spring, where no hordes of tourists are present! Many websites offer this. I think there is one called like "visitcyclades.com" It is really romantic...  Google it and you 'll find out!   Best wishes!    Edit: I have been in Croatia, mainly passing with a car. The nature is amazing. I didn't stay long in cities though, although I liked the little I saw.
b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	The best suggestion i can make is to check with Milupa who make Aptamil.  There should be a number on the box or check their website.  they might be able to tell you if it is under a different name there or a decent alternative.
U8kDudnKaa	The Kingdom of Mysore is ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty from 1399 until the independence of India in 1947.The Wodeyar kings built a palace in Mysore in the 14th century, but this palace was partially damaged by a lightning strike in 1638. It was repaired and expanded, but fell into neglect by the late 18th century. It was demolished in 1793, and a new palace was built in its place in 1803. This palace was destroyed in a fire in 1897 during the wedding of Princess Jayalakshmanni.    The regent of Mysore at the time, Maharani Kempa Nanjammani Vani Vilasa Sannidhana, commissioned a British architect, Henry Irwin, to build yet another palace in its place. The architect was directed to combine different styles of architecture in the construction of the palace. The construction was completed in year 1912.    I have visited the place and it is very beautiful.    Good Luck.|`|AA12137598	my Great Grandfather    His name was Mysore Peer Alas,    So its called Mysore palace|`|z685eF67aa	A British architect, Henry Irwin designed the Mysore Palace|`|zScO40UTaa	TIPPUSULTHAN

AA12350023	Americans are actually spoiled here in SaudiArabia.. I know you hear the opposite maybe from American propaganda.. But seriously, you will be spoiled..  I have many friends that are teachers here in English (me, I chose to tutor english instead of a school atmosphere).. but anyways.. I have one friend, her and her husband are here. they have been teachers for like 10years here and love it and will stay as long as SaudiArabia allows them to. They love it here, and are raising their children here..  You can practice your faith privately.. and there are groups who do get together in some compounds to have services.. No one bothers them..  and as the person above says.. Do be socialable and go out and visit places.. Dubai is just a plane ride away.. See Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar,. Oman.. many places real close... I frankly think its worth it to do.. if after a couple years you dont like it.. well chaulk it up to experience learned.. welcome! ^_^|`|UhnvXXxjaa	lol @ especially civilians     anyway, honestly if i were you i wouldn't go to Saudi Arabia|`|DSVUvfGuaa	A very good idea. Arab have a great respect for teachers especially for Europeans .. Go ahead , you wont regert it , believe you me.|`|diaSqz8laa	Americans are treated with the utmost respect here. And if you have any type of teaching degree, you will be treated like royalty and paid very well. You can also teach in the private sector, like for companies, hospitals, banks, Aramco... the list goes on and on. They are never tired of looking for American teachers. Your best bet is to get hired through a recruiting agency in the USA. Then you will receive so many perks and benefits as a foreign hire. It is actually an offer that you shouldn't refuse. If you live on a compound or amongst the non Muslim American families you will never miss the "comforts" of home. Since you have worked in other countries that also have conservative customs, you are most likely very open minded and will be able to fit in well in this society. You can practice whatever you want privately. No one, not even the Saudis expect you to be Muslim if you work over here. And as I said...the pay is great. You will be tax free for the duration of your stay here. The pay is top notch for tutorials on the side if you desire. Students are now paying quite a bit to be tutored by an American.|`|jz0PYljzaa	These guys speak english better than u do..|`|3CPSWXhGaa	i'm american.  i teach english at a university near jeddah.  i'm also a catholic.    i think it was a good idea for me to come to saudi.  it may not be the best place in the middle east as far as social life, but the money is good.  and with the economy so bad, i'm really happy that i have a stable job.      i was in kuwait for 9 years before coming to saudi.  i have friends who work in dubai and other gulf countries.  they have great social lives and access to churches and alcohol, but they say that the economies in those countries are suffering.  (but i don't know about qatar).      as far as the treatment in saudi... i am very happy with the way i'm being treated.  there is a lot of anti-american sentiment these days with the whole israel-gaza thing, but overall, i don't have any complaints yet.      good luck.|`|WvzS59FKaa	If you want to earn and handsome amount of money and have good benefits then Saudi Arabia is a good place to work.    Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country and are very conservative in their way of life as compared to the culture here in the US.      In Saudi Arabia all men should wear a mustache or a beard because when you are cleanly shaven they will think you're gay and men there can have a lustful interest in you.  So better grow a mustache there.      You can practice your faith there but not publicly.  And when you bring religious article and thing better keep it in places that cannot be seen even if they look through your things      The weekends there are Thursdays and Fridays and usually have Sunday mass on a Friday although mass there is underground inside Saudi- American compounds.  You could ask Filipino families there who are Catholics where they usually attend.      Muslims pray 5 times a day and they close stores for prayer for a few minutes, so if you're getting your haircut and caught the prayer time some barber shops tell you to wait outside during prayer time.    When eating out at restaurants men and women and families have separate places to go    Saudi Arabia is a very rich country, you will see a lot of lights in the streets, huge malls with a lot of designer stores, malls that sell all gold jewelries. etc.      If you will be staying there with your family, you surely will get very close with less temptations from the distraction of the world as compared to liberal countries.    As Catholics. my family and I used to live in Saudi Arabia for quite a few years and it was an experience we have been blessed with.|`|cAFVkWhOaa	do what yr heart says|`|y49j8gyAaa	I dont know how you would go to church. but at least you are a guy, and not a girl|`|wxcmnFEKaa	You have a chance to work in the Middle East, then take it. I think the only problem you will face is Alcohol =P. The advantage is that your embassy will really really help you a looot. If you got a chance to work in Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, or Oman it will be better than Saudi Arabia.    Anyway if you got to work in Saudi Arabia don't miss your chance visiting the Middle East countries especially Oman. Very nice deserts and mountains and beaches to valleys. Take a ride on the sandy desert dunes, do some camping between mountains before you finish your work here. And I think they will pay you very high salaries in Saudi Arabia, you can invest. =P|`|wTeJulT5aa	I don't think there's anything wrong with going to Saudi Arabia to teach English.  Americans are treated very well here.  You can practice your religion privately.  It's no problem, and no one will bother you about your religion.    It's up to you if you want to come.  You can probably find a nice paying job, especially since you have a lot of experience.

wxcmnFEKaa	First you can take yourself to the bus station in Pudu Raya in KL to take a bus to Melaka. I'm not sure about the rates, but I think it will not be more than 15 RM I guess. I'm not sure about going around in Melaka but I think there are taxis and buses all around. You can go to:    -A Famosa built in 1511 by the Portuguese.  -The Stadthuys In 1650 this was the official residence of the Dutch governors.  -Dutch Graveyard is a war memorial devoted to the British officers and soldiers who died in the Naning War (1831-32).  -Portuguese Square is a Mini Lisbon situated within the Portuguese settlement. This square boasts all their culture and history.  -There is Port Dickson if you like beaches too.    As for transport if you have driving license I would suggest you to rent a car either from Shah Alam or from there in Melaka and go around easier any time around the day. It takes one to two hours driving from Shah Alam to Melaka. Have a nice trip. =)    Oh I forgot, check these pages: http://wikitravel.org/en/Malacca_(state) and http://wikitravel.org/en/Melaka.

It is just how you will carry yourself and be in proper manner.  Show other people that you still look great and with positive aura even though your height and weight are your problems.  Take care.

35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	I think it could have been structured differently.  By which I mean I'm selfish and a little pissed off that people earning eighty grand get money, but as a university student I miss out simply because I don't get any social security payments.  Seriously, they could at least give me five hundred bucks to cover one semester's text books.    And it seems like a pretty lazy solution.  The long-term stuff, which accounts for about two thirds of the package, mostly seems like a good idea.  But as popular as cash handouts are, I'm sure Kevin and his mates could have come up with something cleverer.|`|ewuyoA2Qaa	well free money is great, but it will be blown on junk|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I think it will be better spent building a giant rollercoaster going right around the Melbourne CBD.

A $22 billion deficit. After all those years of having a surplus. Why can't we just spend what we have?     You do realise that once the economy stabilises, taxes are going back up and higher, interest rates will go back up and higher, and so on..     Make the most of it while you can.    I still think we should have only used what surplus is available. The country is heading towards a recession, what happens now? If something else happens are we going to borrow more and be in a $100 billion deficit?    Here is all the info about the payments - http://www.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs....|`|gV6kZeAraa	It will help some families to buy items they couldn't afford before (or with a hardship).

Canberra knows what they doing.     It's like feeding the wolf, but keeping the goat alive.    Long live the Labor.|`|rVqFTqCdaa	the cash handouts are being given to stimulate growth in the economy and to help people out.It will certainly do the first thing, as people will spend it at businesses etc making the businesses profit etc...but will it make a significant difference -- this is the important question... But even If people waste it on crap the govt will at least still get 10% back through the GST and more if its gambling alcohol or cigarettes.    The thing I have an issue with is the fact that its being given to everyone who earns less that 80,000!!! thats crap! it should be more like 60,000. the people who earn 80,000 a year should learn how to be more careful with their money and not be materialistic people who buy things they want rather than need on loan... and the people who dont work should be made do a weeks work in turn for the money. other low income earners and independent students (who will pay back the government eventually through higher paying educated jobs) should be given the money to help them pay for necessities such as rent, food etc, which are increasing in cost.      REPLY TO MEL :its not easy to keep the budget in surplus when their is going to be a $115B decline in budget revenue due to the economic crisis...    you say spend what we already have?? - well yes thats is happening, but if there wasn't such a decline in revenue due to the crisis we probably would still have a budget surplus.     - the whole idea of spending money still, and not too much (the budget is still cautious) is to stimulate infrastructure and economic growth so that the slump felt by the recession is less extreme as money is still being invested in the economy , thus stimulating a small degree of economic growth, or viability-eg govt picking up the private sector investment slump a bit.|`|NNJSdoGRaa	I'm really not up on all the mumbojumbo. But, I do have an opinion on money hand-outs. We are being told by every expert in Australia that our children will be dying at younger ages than their parents because of obesity. Why then doesn't the Government pay for every child in Australia to join a sporting group. Fully paid fees, equipment, petrol vouchers for travelling to games/matches. The retailers will still benefit by selling shoes, socks, hats, boots, sporting equipment ( including bikes, trampolenes, surfboards,roller blades etc..), drink bottles, sun screen... Food and drinks. At least it won't go into the pokies,smokes and booze.

The contemporary is ok but it can get noisy if you have a room near the monorail since it goes inside the building.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	well "best" is only a matter of opinion.   i personally think the best deluxe resort is the contemporary.   -its a very uniquely shaped resort  -the monorail actually goes inside of it  -it has one of my favorite restaurants in it (chef mickey's)  -i love the shops in it  -cuz its so close to magic kingdom (my favorite disney world park)|`|q9NPU952aa	All of the Deluxe Resorts are wonderful -- it really boils down to personal taste.  I am a Polynesian fan, myself.  Other people don't care for that particular resort.    When you stay at a Deluxe Resort, you will have a beautiful, well-appointed room, lots of amenities and an amazing, cohesive theme to the resort.  This is true for every Deluxe Resort.  So, how do you choose?    First, decide on location -- do you want to be on the monorail line?  Near Epcot and Hollywood Studios?  Animal Kingdom?  Once you've chosen the location, then take a look at the resorts near that area.  Choose based on the theme and feel of the resort.  You are sure to love it!    Happy Disney Dreaming!|`|0WASp0bHaa	Two big favorites are the Polynesian and the Animal Kingdom Lodge.     Polynesian is great for transportation. It has the boat to MK. And the monorail to the transportation center and to MK. It has a beach to sit out on and the night time water parade. The scenery is beautiful and the have the lighting to the tiki torches every evening.     AKL is our new favorite. We had a savannah balcony view room. I can't believe how much we all enjoyed seeing the animals right outside our patio door. I had coffee early every morning out there and watched the giraffes eat. There are decks to sit on and see the savannah if you don't have a view from your room. There is also a huge fire pit by the savannah. Lots of different activities for the kids. Great counter service restaurant by the pool. Beautiful lobby with african art work throughout the resort. We had no problems with the bus transportation to all the parks from there.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Personally, I like the Polynesian.  But it definitely depends on the person.

BTW, those open palms pushing to you never stop when you marry a filipina. Good Luck!

People dont really talk any different than California, I wouldn't think.  Colorado Springs is a more laid back area not a great deal of hustle and rush.  Well at least you wont have to worry about earth quakes but the winters do get pretty bad in the springs especially near Monument.    As for places you need to see, you have to go see Garden of the Gods. it is so awesome.     That is about it really, it is a nice area, good city and Denver is about an hour away.    good luck and welcome to Colorado.|`|pj63ZODzaa	hmm.  i live in southern cali now, and used to live in boulder/denver/vail for 5 or 6 years.  lingo?  people don't really use as much "so-cal speak" in co unless you are in boulder, where there are a lot of kids at the university from so cal.  culture?  i suppose image is not as 'important' in colorado- fashion is for comfort and outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, etc.  it's a little hippie in co- think birkenstocks, bluegrass music... but the love of organic foods and staying fit is the same as it is in cali.      things to do?  while it is winter, if you don't know how to ski/snowboard- learn.  it is awesome, and the snow- i think- is much better than cali snow.  however, it is very different: in cali, you have "sierra cement" while in co you have "colorado champagne"  cali snow is really wet and heavy (cement) and co snow is light and fluffy (champagne).   summer in colorado is awesome.  tons of music shows, you must must must see shows at red rocks, just outside of denver (morrison, co) and there are tons of bluegrass festivals, the main and one of best things i have ever done, is the telluride bluegrass festival.  also, colorado has a boatload of microbreweries if you like beer.  my favorites are tommy knockers which is in idaho springs, on i-70 on your way up to the mountains and there is the mountain sun brewery in boulder.  yummy java porter.  there is a cool bar in denver called the red room which is a vodka bar that serves caraffs of cold vodka with pickle slices.  check out boulder, also has a pedestrian zone, pearl street mall is what it is called.    colorado springs, haven't been there too much, but nearby in the pouder canyon (seriously) there is a music venue called the mishawalka, which is in a canyon on a river, and you can camp there for shows.  really fun.  there are a lot of great hikes, the famed '14 fourteeners' 14 peaks that are over 14,000 feet high.  also a lot of natural hot springs.  glenwood springs is known for its vapor caves and hot springs, and was where doc holiday died and is buried.      when driving in the mountains if it is snowy, you might want chains for your car.      have fun!!!!!|`|8d7C9GSzaa	I was born in San Diego and I've lived in Colorado for 13 years now. I must say there are a lot of cultural differences, but in a REALLY good way.     People out here are WAY more laid back about things, appearance does not matter as much out here. We wear flip flops in the winter time and are big outdoors people.    Learn how to ski or snowboard, it's like surfing is in Cali, you make way more friends and have a much better experience learning. Honestly I'd think one would be a fool not to take Advantage of the beauty of the mountains.     SInce you're from Cali, you WILL be cold! Our winters will have snow and compared to S. Cal. you should for sure get a parka, and snowboots with good traction (trust me, you don't want to fall on the ice in the parking lot!). Our heat and winter is dry, it's ALWAYS dry out here so bring much MUCH moisturizer. Get aquafour or A&D ointment because at first you might get bloody noses so that stuff will be key.     And for your 1st few weeks when you party, BEWARE of the altitude change, Denver is the Mile High City, so you'll get drunk WAY easier. Drink LOT's of water when you first move.     We ARE into natural food just like people in Cali.    Denver is a real chill city w/ a budding nightlife...    www.groovetickets.com  select Colorado as your state to see events in Denver's best clubs.    I recommend The Church & Club Beta; 16th street mall is also where you can find a happening nightlife, so hit those places up.     But I'd say people here DO dress up, but not to the same extreme, & when hanging out, it's more about comfortable & practical.     We are VERY proud of our state, it's beautiful here :-) heck I got the Colorado flag tattood on my ankle! lol    During the summer it will be hot, but also a dry heat. Tank tops are a good idea.     It will snow all the way into spring... you should DEFINATELY invest in all season or snow tires, & if you have a little front wheel drive or rear wheel, you'd BETTER know how to drive in the snow, and even then you could get stuck on hills. I suggest signing up for a snow driving course, I see SO many stupid accidents because people just didn't know how to drive in the snow! Don't be one of those people....     I guess that's it, or all I can think of and I hope it helps!    here's a website too.     http://www.coloradodirectory.com/funfact...|`|wXloRCegaa	I just stopped driving a cab in Colorado Springs so I've got ya covered on the info.  First and foremost, Colorado Springs is SO different from Denver!  Denver is currently standing right around 2.5 million people in the metropolitan area where as Colorado Springs is a mere half million.  C.S. is much closer to the Rockies as well but Denver will put you closer to the slopes and resorts.  They're very different and yet only an hour's drive separating them, joined together by IH-25.    I've always called C.S. the city of extreames.  You're either completely conservative or completely liberal.  You're a junkie or you're straight edge.  You're an Evangelical or you're Wiccan.  You're an eastsider or a westsider.  There is just not a lot of gray area anywhere here.      It can be a really intense place to live, especially when the city is completely surrounded by military instillations (I'm not kidding), surrounded.  What does that mean, you might be asking?  It means 35,000 soldiers and their families in town by 2011 (per Ft. Carson and the local newspaper, the gazette).  Also, lots of young guys with post tramatic stress syndrome who haven't had a drop of alchohol in however long they've been deployed to the middle east and just want to drink eachother under the table at 6,000 ft above sea level.    If no one has mentioned the altitude, prepare yourself.  C.S. is 6,000 ft. above sea level which means you will dry out and dehydrate almost instantainiously when you arrive.  Prepare yourself with lots of water and lots of chapstick.  Don't expect to be able to run a mile when you get here, in fact, don't plan on any physical activity for a few days while your body acclimates.  You will also get drunk much faster  too.  Keep in mind, this is where olympic athletes come to train, so you know it's going to be harsh!    What I've said so far could be overwhelming but most folks will tell you that it's a great place to raise a family.  Also, if you're into any kind of natural sport, it's going to be available to you here.  Most people are laid back.  Why?  Because anyone you meet in C.S. (not Denver) is going to be from either Texas or California.     Enjoy your stay and make sure you tip your cab drivers well.  ;)|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Colorado Springs is uber conservative. Combine Focus on the Family with several military installations and, well, you get the idea. I have friends who are not at all conservative who live there, and they say they step lightly and watch what they say.

AA10042296	Can't the school give you help finding a place?  Are there no dorms?  I would think that many rentals would open up from people that just graduated and moved out.  You might find something searching the internet, but they will probably be upscale and expensive.  Most rentals in Mexico are found by searching and word of mouth.  So if the school can't help, your best bet is to go down there two weeks ahead of time and start walking the streets around the school until you see a sign in a window that says "Se Renta."  Also check bulletin boards in supermarkets and ask in all the neighborhood tiendas, and those ladies always have there ear to the ground and probably know somebody who knows somebody who has something to rent.

puyAEPZyaa	I would definitely recommend going to the Cirque du Soleil "Believe" at Luxor.    -It is the newest Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.  -It features all the traditional Cirque du Soleil acts, but also features acts that were developed by Criss Angel, so the show differs slightly from the traditional Cirque du Soleil people are used to.  -The show keeps its audience on the edge of their seats, especially with the mysterious appeal Criss Angel added to the show.    Check out www.cirquedusoleil.com/believe to see some pictures of the show.    Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip to Las Vegas as well as the show!|`|HAFZs1Liaa	We locals have read all the reviews of this show of Criss Angel's and they aren't pretty.

AA11090428	There was never any plans or intent for Disneyland to be planned in singapore. Before Hong Kong, they had plans for Taiwan, Korea, China but not Singapore. Plannings for such sites are determined by the local population, average tourist per year and ideal landscape. Currently, Singapore simply does not meet certain criteria.  So far, the third Disneyland in Asia has been set in China and the anticipated completion date would be around year 2020.  Walt Disney Co signed a statement of intent to build a Disneyland on the mainland in 2002, and then set up a venture to develop the site, which would be about 4.7 times the size of Hong Kong's Disneyland.  Hope this information helps.    Edit: Sorry, I thought you were asking regarding the plans from Walt Disney. From the Singapore side, I found this:    http://www.wildsingapore.com/sos/media/0...|`|ASSbLOk6aa	Seletar Air base was the proposed site. It was later scarp because Singapore deem un-feasible .

Por otro lado debes saber que los seres humanos tienen diversas necesidades aparte de las que tu crees.    La psicologa de los seres humanos no es tan simple como para definirla solo como una "esperanza de ser salvados"    Creo que hay gente que solo critica porque hay esa libertad pero realmente no tiene una razn bien meditada para hacerlo.    saludos!|`|IXZW0etoaa	Sabias que Dios tampoco cree en los Ateos?|`|6tLVubymaa	+2|`|B1HvN4Yeaa	Mmm... pues eso es lo que tu piensas no nos puedes obligar a nadie a pensar como tu, cada quien tiene el derecho de creer en la religion que guste.

BYE BYE|`|008fab917bb9f087b12b1103c933faf5aa	No considero que forzosamente la creencia en un Dios sea smbolo de ignorancia.  No tenemos mtodos cientficos para demostrar la existencia o inexistencia de Dios; los mtodos para llegar a su existencia o inexistencia generalmente corresponden a la teologa o la filosofa.    Considero que es demasiado fuerte, e incluso un tanto ignorante el juzgar a todos los creyentes de ignorantes.  Si bien, es bastante razonable el considerar que la conceptualizacin mitologica que se da acerca de la existencia de de Dios, ya sea hablemos de la religin Catolica , Judia, Musulmana, u otra; no parece razonable en factores de viabilidad, ello no es lo sustancioso de las religiones.    Finalmente la creencia en algo as es un acto de fe, y el proceso para llegar a esta verdadera fe no solo es arduo y largo, si no que involucra en muchas ocasiones razonamientos de ordn filosofico ms alla de cualquier brote de ignorancia.    Adems la ignorancia es un factor inherente al hombre, el ignorar es lo que nos hace preguntarnos, y el preguntarnos es lo que nos hace investigar, y la investigacin nos trae conocimiento y aprendizaje.    El creer en dioses, o cuestiones paranormales es natural del hombre, una caracteristica propia de l; an cuando llegara un hipotetico caso de que desaparecieran las religiones que conocemos en la actualidad, nuevos fetichismos, creencias y prejuicios los seguirian, desde el consumismo, el idolatramiento de los msicos, o la tecnologa alcanzada por el hombre.    Considero tu pregunta un tanto catartica, espero que no juzgues a todos los creyentes como ignorantes.  En mi caso soy creyente, pero no te puedo explicar la naturaleza de Dios, apenas y puedo conceptualizarlo; ?por qu?, porque soy ignorante de todo lo que involucra ese misterio, mi capacidad no alcanza a comprenderlo an, he all el misterio de la fe.

La religin le da fuerzas cuando estn cados, el saber ma?osamente que dios no existe, puede ser el mejor camino que el de ser ateo o religioso, sin embargo debes tener mucha fe para compensar lo que sabes. enga?arse lo hace toda la gente, y tambien enga?an a los dems, pero enga?ar a los dems si puede considerarse de mala cala?a|`|ZAFYAxVraa	Vos sos ms ignorante por no respetar las ideas de cada uno.|`|bo5QTCEvaa	Ni?a Cosita Dulce.

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola! Yes, I do. One of the most popular timeshares in all of Cabo. It has done very well over the years and seems to be one of the better ones. It is also conveniently located downtown, where most others are out of town at least 10 to 20 minutes.    The company that owns all 4 Pueblos (the Bonito CSL, the PB Sunset Beach, the PB Rosa, and the PB Pacifica) is called Pueblo Bonito. They also have property in Mazatlan, and Vallarta.    As you can expect, in most cases there will be good and bad reviews when you are in the business of timeshare. You need to go down, talk to other people who are at the resort and make your own decision. The website www.pueblobonito.com has more info. They have a good reputation, so if you are thinking time share, it is a good option here in Cabo.|`|siHN027laa	I had a great Time Share at Hacienda del Mar for ten years and with RCI. Switched it a few times and went to Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, etc.  Reason I sold it was that last visit there they were charging $13.00 for a run and coke (small glass, too) and my annual maintenance fees went from about $100 to over $500 a year (and continue to go mup and i had a smaller unit) and they really weren;' doing anything to the resort to upgrade at the time.  I'd check some of the websites that sell other folks TimeShares as you can get some great bargains at times.  I'm not rich by any means and my wife and I decided we could have just as much fun, relaxation and enjoyment by shopping intently for the best rates and paqckages as compared to what we were spending on bar bills, overpriced restaurants and outrageous maintenance fees.  As an example, we stayed (through a friends RCI Membership), 7 full days at the Mayan Palace at the marina in Puerto Vallarta. We had sleeping room for 7, dining room, full kitchen, 2 baths, patio overlooking the Banderas Bay all for $118 for the entire week!!!! Not a day but the whole week...and that incuded the IVA.  We rented a car locally on the internet (Budget, I think it was) for $90 for the entire week, unlimited mileage. We bought some food at Mega and Soriana's and had a lot meals in the room, we bought our booze at Walmart and other inexpensive places. Yes, we did go out for dinner, yes we did drive south to Manzanillo and almost to Guadalajara and north to Tepic and San Blas.   What a week that was and total cost was less than $800. !!!!!|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	Pueblo Bonito is a company. They have 3 resorts in Cabo, the Rose, Blanco and Sunset Beach.

moF46oZYaa	In theory this could benefit some African countries but definitely not South Africa.    This would be disasterous for South Africa on so many levels.    Firstly it would encourage mass immigration of people to countries within the AU, like the millions of eastern europeans now working in Britain, and since SA is the most prosperous country in Africa where do you think they will all go?    Economically it would place a huge burden on our country, having to support the other less developed AU member countries.    We would be obligated to get involved in their problems,even if a country is on the other side of the continent and as I'm sure you're well aware, other countries in Africa aren't as peaceful as ours.    When you join such a union you give away some of your ability to make your own decisions, I for one don't want Muammar Gaddafi or whoever telling our president what to do in our own country.    Many of the north African countries are muslim and have a huge Arab influence, these countries are VERY different to South Africa....sharia law here we come?!!    On another note, what I would like is a union between countries in southern Africa, i.e South Africa and our neighbours.|`|hfigZbx5aa	The reason this worked alright with Europe was because the European countries were pretty self-sustaining without it.

South Africans would suffer - having to support other African "states". We're just getting on our feet, and we need to take care of ourselves for a change.

Instead of a hundred little kleptocracies, we can suffer the "advantages" of a big, massive one!    Get real!

And now, typically, instead of admitting it and trying something new that could actually work, they are simply going to blunder ahead blindly and make the joke even more grotesque than it already is.

WxwrWnubaa	Fish are wonderful pets to have in your home or office. They are quiet, undemanding, and colorful. In fact, sometimes, you dont even know they are there. You can enjoy watching them on a regular basis, especially for a few quiet moments of reflection. However, as quiet as they might be, fish require some tender loving care since their environment is not self maintaining.    The cleaner you are able to keep the fish tank, the healthier the fish living in it will be. If you place your fish tank away from direct sunlight, it will help to control the growth of algae. This will minimize the amount of scrubbing that you have to do to keep the tank clean. In fact, dont make the mistake of thinking that algae eating fish living in the tank provide in home maids. It doesnt, and you will still need to clean the tank.    Maintaining a fish tank at home is one of the simplest tasks as long as you remember to keep up with the individual components of it. Get into a schedule of completing the necessary cleaning and maintenance tasks for it, and it will become second nature to you. A handy list of things to remember and when to remember to do them is provided.    Daily Tasks    ? Check the fish each day. If any of them have died, remove them immediately by scooping them out with a small net made for fish tanks. Dispose of the fish properly and immediately.  ? Check the electrical plugs to make sure that they are plugged in properly, especially if you have small children or other pets that have the run of the area. A dislodged cord can lead to an early demise for all of your fish.  ? Check to make sure that everything is running properly. Learn to identify the sounds of the equipment so that you can notice immediately when something is amiss. Reset or repair anything that needs to be fixed.  ? Removing any uneaten food after approximately ten minutes will help to keep the tank clean.  ? Give the gravel at the bottom of the tank a light swishing to disturb dirt particles so that the filter can remove them.    Weekly Tasks    ? Trim excess growth or dead leaves from any living plants in the fish tank.  ? Use an algae scrubber to clean any existing algae from the sides of the tank walls. If you dont have an algae scrubber, use a nylon sponge or mitt.  ? Use the algae scrubber or a clean toothbrush to scrub any algae from tank decorations. You can do this while the decorations remain in the tank if you dont mind getting a little wet.  ? Replace approximately one fifth of the tanks water with fresh water that has been allowed to sit for at least 24 hours to release any existing chlorine. The fresh water needs to be held in a clean container that has not been used for any other purpose.  ? Clean the gravel. To do this properly, you should use a gravel cleaner that is designed to vacuum the dirt particles from in between the gravel pieces.    Monthly Tasks    ? Clean the filter tubing. First, disconnect the tubing. Use a filter brush to clean it.  ? Clean the external glass of the tank using a paper towel that has been sprayed with a glass cleaner. Never spray the tank directly.  ? Use a damp cloth to wipe the top of the tank clean.  ? Use a damp cloth to wipe the outside of all external fish tank accessories.  ? Clean dirty tank decorations by removing them and scrubbing them clean with an algae scrubber. Rinse the decorations completely clean before returning them to the tank.|`|coY11FiIaa	Clean it!!

z15RhXfjaa	Wow I think everyone here is being very generous on the rent front.    I live in Greece and I am paying 600 euro a month for what is supposed to be a posh apartment, but is 60 years old and falling apart.    The apartments/studios I have seen for 300 I wouldnt put my worst enemy in.|`|gcRgEFrmaa	You should be ashamed!!!!!|`|z8ZyjO3Vaa	"..an average house in an okay area is around 330!" Average means very poor and ok area is what in greek is called b a s k l a s a r i a.  But it' ok for most of the people whom the main problem in life is...Fyrom:)|`|AA11589437	It depends on your lifestyle. I always say that everyone can spend as much as he earns. Take the rent for example. In a very good area, a small studio apartment may cost 300-500 euro per month. But in another area, not bad, just less "luxurious" you can find a 2 bedroom flat for this money. So let's say that 300 for rent is a normal price to pay, average.  The bills would average be 100 euro per month.  In the winter time it would be more because of heating, in the summer less.  Transport also depends on what means of transport you use. You may spend 15 euro per month if you use public transport every day. If you walk more you pay less, I pay about 1 euro per month for transport within the city, because i walk everywhere in the centre. If I go far I take the car, so I pay for fuel, around 30 euro per month - excluding long trips for weekends etc.  Entertainment? Well, cinema is 7 euro, dinner in Athens is about 20 euro, but in other cities it is cheaper. If you go out once a week, you will need 100 euro per month.  Plus your shopping, I estimate it would be 200 euro per month for a single person (supermarket I mean).  So, if we add everything, we get 750 euro per month. That is  when you don't spend too much, but you don't starve either or stay at home to save money. But we have not calculated holidays, travelling and shopping for clothes, gifts, etc. That is why people who get a salary of 700-800 euro live with their parents, to be able to afford these "extras". If you earn 1000 euro you can live alone just fine (I know people who do). If you have a flat, like I do, and you share it - so you share expenses, you live quite comfortably even with a small salary.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Ohhh you are flattering me..    Seriously now, a rent for an apartment of 1 bedroom-living room-WC-cuisine (about 50-60 m3) is from 280-400 (depends of :how new-built is that,in which area,etc)  I think that an average house in an okay area is around 330.    water is almost nothing (for one person) ,is about 10euros per 3 months ( i think) .  Power is 80-110 per 2 months.    For transportation, it depends the way you move.I use only bus and trolleys (metro is not so usefull for my route) so my monthy card is 15e for unlimited usage.     Food and entertaiment depends on the person.    A salary of 800-850 (average not basic) :  330 rent  50 power  5 water  15 or 35 transportation     and the rest is for shopping and entertainment.    Note that, most Greeks (almost the 80% own a house on their own ) ......      I don't forget how horrible you are, but in normal questions i give normal answers.|`|JQIztxIlaa	Athens - bus, tram, underground -> 80 cent for 60 minutes with changes; cinema -> 8 euro; coffee -> 3 euro; beer -> 2 euro; parking is free; rent for a flat for 1 month -> 300-500 euro; monthly expenses for one person on average -> 300 euro;  Thessaloniki is a bit cheaper in terms of daily expenses, but rent is the same.

f6a42ef1b57ba4b191c4db4cc48534edaa	Central America, I would say Panama. I grew up in N.C. but traveled since 1981. Lived in Panama 5 years.    Visited many times Honduras and Costa Rica.     Panama is very modern and as fast paced as you want it to be or as tranquil as you want it to be.|`|p1n1ViwIaa	South America is best than Central America... less poor    Central America is always hot, in South America there are place of temperate and cood climate in the south cone (near to Antartica) and in the andes mountains|`|03sLrNPCaa	I am a gringo living in Honduras and have visited most of the Central American countries.  So far Honduras is my favorite.  A very low cost of living, all of the creature comforts, plus a sense of feeling welcome. But as far as a place to match the pace of LA?  Possibly one of the cities in Costa Rica or Panama.  They are both a bit more "Americanized" but still are a long way behind the speed you are accustomed to.  For most folks one of the main attractions of entire CA is the very relaxed, "ma?ana" environment.|`|aVDyZFxqaa	I looked into the country of Panama as a place to live, at one time.  I learned it is very modern now. Americans are retiring there because they have a sort of favored status due to our two countries history's involving the Canal.  Also, they don't have earthquakes there which scare the you know what out of me!  The official website is very informative.  Good Luck.|`|pXS9xa1Laa	Costa Rica, There are parts that you can move to that are quite similar to america actually, their cities are beautiful. Also, the weather is nice. Its never to hot or to cold. The cities are fast paced and busy. I've been there three times and all over the country and it is amazingly beautiful, i couldn't have asked for more in my visits, there are tourist areas also, but away from the tourist areas are just as nice. Enjoy!|`|HvyE4qpYaa	Costa Rica... hands down no questions about it.    You're not looking to rough it. You're not looking to learn about ancient Mayan civilizations.... or to live among the people.  You want a faster pace of life, with all the amenities that SoCal has (well all the ones you REALLY need, like gym, clubs, tanning, etc)... then it's Costa Rica,....no question about it.     Let's look at the other ones:    Belize- Great scuba activities near the resorts. English-speaking country... it may help out when dealing with important documents.... but any medical issues other than colds and fevers and you'd have to cross over to Chetumal, Mexico for treatment as Belize health facilities leave much to be desired (friend relocated to Belize 2 yrs ago)    Guatemala- Poor and dangerous.  yeah, it's a fast pace of life... because you're always running from gunfire.     El Salvador- Birthplace of MS-13, need I say more?    Honduras- Not too bad by the beach resorts, but you won't be LIVING there.  The rest of the country hosted many sally strother's commercials.     Nicaragua- Political unrest heaven.    Panama- Not too bad... but there is drug activity along the border with Colombia, and doesn't offer the standard of living CR does.    It goes without Question that Costa Rica is hands down the best: Politically Stable, safe, beautiful, high standard of living, and many direct flights to the U.S.|`|BbfNMXtiaa	When I visited Belize I met some Americans that moved there and loved it, but for a faster pace, I have heard that Costa Rica has more to offer in the city. Plus it is just a really friendly and beautiful country.
2wyDALHgaa	I do try but I really wonder if it makes a difference.  Does made in Canada/US mean that it was really made in Canada/US or does it mean that it was assembled in Canada or the US?  Does it mean it was packaged in Canada or the US?  Does it mean it was partially packaged or made in Canada or the US?    We have fish packing plants on the east coast that pump out "Canadian" fish products but we have no fishing industry to speak of any more.  It's all fish caught outside our territorial waters by foreign fishing vessels but because it's cleaned and canned in Canada it can say "made in Canada".    When I see all of the Made in Canada and Made in the USA dog food being recalled because of contaminated Chinese ingredients I can't help but wonder how it can say it was made in Canada/USA?    I see Toyota and Nissan cars that are said to be made in Canada and they are certainly assembled in Canada but are they really made here when the parts are mostly shipped in from overseas?      I really feel that Made in Canada or Made in USA labels are really more of a marketing ploy then a statement of fact.  I still try to support them and buy the products though because at least I know that some of the work was done here rather then shipped in totally from overseas but it really is deceptive.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Are goods made in teh USA or Canada anymore?|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I try.

It's just that 'jamon serrano' is so good!|`|AA12212523	There  is some debate in Canada and a change coming concerning  "Made in Canada" labels.    You need to be sure that the whole thing is made in Canada or the US. You also need to watch for changes. The Kraft peanuts I used to buy had "Made in the USA" on the packaging.     Now it says "Manufactured for Kraft, USA". Presumably the peanuts are now imported. I wonder if they always were.

rVUvopaLaa	do you mean materially poor i suppose?  here's how;  get involved to charity works.      participate to http://www.gawadkalinga.org/ or any other activity that restores the dignity of the poor.      you can do it alone initially and encourage others to do the same once you get progress from what you started.      collect old stuff or unwanted things from your garage, shed or closet.  give it to certain family you think will value it and find it useful. make sure not to give out rubbish.  remember your goal is to restore their dignity.     if your resources is limited.  spend your time with them instead.  by way of teaching them how to live the decent way although materially poor.      begin adopting small number of families only if not one family only.  depends of your resources and time.      finally, show your genuine interest.  make sure to be sincere remember they have feeling too like you.  they also know if you are just using them or it's just for fun for you or something else.      in these way you'll get connected to the poor and you'll understand the kind of life they have.      good luck!|`|Imqb5ueqaa	Only one way ----- actually associating with them.     One can not get "in touch" by just observing from a distance. Because you will not see the nuances that define their aspirations, their problems, their attitudes. You can not hear their conversations. You can not see what is in their pantry (or what is in their caldero). You will not understand why they drink Ginebra instead of Generoso or Matador or Emperador or Tanduay. Or why they drink Red Horse and not Colt 45. Or why they only dream of having their kids finish high school. No, never from a distance.    When I was younger, I was engaged to to depth research. We did this by actually assimilating, living with the families in the remote barrios. Realizing that even their attitudes in front of us strangers change a bit. But as we moved on, we were able to spot these things. I even regularly drank lambanog or tuba with them.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	a down-to-earth attitude.|`|gV6kZeAraa	Just be nice to them and show your appreciation if they work good.  Do not look down on them, they are hard working people.  Just little smaller than you.

I'll give you two overseas and two here in North America:    Zermatt:  At the foot of the Matterhorn.  Great town, and lots of high terrain so there will be snow    Chamonix:  Classic French resort.  Great town, great views of Mont Blanc.    Aspen:  The most glitzy American resort, lots of romantic spots and great skiing with Snowbird.    Whistler:  Probably the best terrain in North America, and a good ski town for those romantic dinners.

ZPxJNpMxaa	If you want to resign then the notice period in your employment contract or according to the BCEA, which is based on service, over 1 year dictates a 1 month notice period, must be worked.    The notice period can be waived if there is agreement in writing between the 2 parties.    If you have worked for a year and taken all your annual leave ( 21 calendar days) that is fine, however, if you have not worked for a full year and taken all your leave then technically you would be indebted to your employer on a pro rata basis.    However, the employer is not permitted to deduct any amount from your wages, excluding those dictated by law, without your written consent, so legally without your written consent he may not deduct these monies.    My advice is if you have taken more leave than you qualify for in terms of service, agree on the number of days owed and allow the deduction....that is fair play and remember your employer could well become a reference on your CV.|`|L6nyAX8Aaa	I strongly doubt it. One is entitled to at least 21 consecutive days leave per year but only once you have worked for one year year at a company. In fact if you resigned before the annual leave, and you were entitled to leave, the company should pay you out.    So they should not be able to ask you to pay it back. If they do subtract the leave money from your salary you should report it to the CCMA within 30 days from when the dispute arose and I am sure it will be sorted out.

rVUvopaLaa	it's a cultural thing as earlier suggested try something practical. with it try to find out their interest say what's the dad are into during free time.  what i mean maybe he's interested to do handy stuff at home perhaps you can buy a handy cordless drill which is expensive in the Phils but you can buy a good value in US.    if the mom loves cooking perhaps you can buy one of those mixers or food processors or simply vegetarian cookbook if she likes one of those.    these items are not heavy enough and not bulky for you to bring over.      also ask your girl about it.  just a word of caution when asking be subtle about it don't make it obvious.  why?  chances are they might be expecting something from you.  in other words make sure it'll be a surprise.      or you can also give something coming from the state you are from.  an item that can only be found or popular from your state.      finally maintain a low profile.  don't be too generous but be considerate.     by the way they will also test your sincerity.  trust me.    good luck!|`|KVlRYoidaa	BUY THEM THEIR OWN HOUSE SO THEY WON'T LIVE WITH YOU AND YOUR FUTURE WIFE.|`|kFq62tBpaa	it's a reasonable "Cash" amount.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	your fiance has much more better ideas than we do, since she have known them for so long...    but it really depends on their lifestyle, you know... if they're rich or in the upper middle class, then you should give them the appropriate gifts, maybe perfume/cologne, or a watch, or a purse for the mother and a belt for the father...    but if they're in the middle class, then clothes (such as shirts/shoes) would do...    this is my opinion... it'd be better if you ask your fiance...|`|vxN09hLdaa	it should be on the practical side...    in general, you can get some idea from your Filipina girlfriend on the specifics especially so that you did not include the province where she came from. it could have given me some idea.    as a general rule, don't give them perishable items such as food, beverages or wines.  try something that they could enjoy for a longer period of time.    good luck...|`|alN2JxuUaa	A practical gift will do.    You should check on what they need first...    Maybe an appliance or perhaps a furniture.

I am sure you will be able to get an impression what they really need. Also, you may want the option of letting them be able to choose the gift for themselves? Just a thought.    Have a great time in the Philippines!|`|7ONAv4vYaa	You can ask your fiancee of ideas for the gift.    If it is your first meet I guess it is better if practical, has a lot of thought in it and tells about you. You can add a framed picture of you and your fiancee for remembrance. You can give them something that says you are a Filipino by heart. That you like to be a Filipino, because Filipinos have strong family ties. Filipinos never forget their family and they enjoy a lot of family get together.    Or You can go for something that you like to give them.     So that your future in-laws won't expect so much from you, you have to start from simple, practical and has a lot of effort. May be in the future gift you can give them a luxurious one.    Is the level of practicality and luxuriousness in your standards? Because in a simple Filipino family something from America is already luxurious. If you are bringing it from America, then it's not a problem if whether it's practical or luxurious. As long as you are bringing each of them a gift, that is already thoughtful. For your fiancee's siblings, maybe something in fad. maybe ipods.. or shoes.. or shirts( like NBA t-shirts for her brothers, because Filipinos are fond of basketball ) or anything that can be useful to them.    The thought always count..    BTW, congratulations.|`|EjhJliKmaa	a framed picture of you and your fiancee would be cool.

AA10310496	Great Britain is the island that contains England, Wales and Scotland.  The United Kingdom is the countries which make up Great Britain plus six of the nine counties of Northern Ireland.  It's full title being...  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.    Edit  When I have said the nine counties of Ulster in past answers people from Ireland have told me that I am wrong in saying that Northern Ireland is part of Ulster!   Seems I'm wrong if I say it one way and wrong if I say it the other!|`|7oA361fbaa	Great Britain is the name of the island on which England, Scotland and Wales lie.    The United Kingdom (or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to give it the full name) = England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.    Additonally - "six of the nine counties of Northern Ireland" is incorrect - There only are six counties in Northern Ireland - The total 9 counties make up the Province of Ulster - Contrary to popular belief, Ulster and Northern Ireland are not the same thing.|`|OXqztCf6aa	GB = England, Scotland and Wales.  UK = GB plus Northern Ireland.      Sarch UK - I have noticed that in the past you have referred to Northern Ireland as being a province - IE: the province of Northern Ireland - which is incorrect.    Northern Ireland is a country.    The country of Northern Ireland lies within the Province of Ulster. These two entities are not one and the same (I and understand how confusing this can be, as people frequently call Northern Ireland 'Ulster' - There was even talk years ago of officially changing the name to Ulster!)    Ulster Contains three counties that are not part of Northern Ireland - Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.    The best way to think of Northern Ireland is of a Country - Forget about provinces and counties, that just confuses things!    Anyway here endeth my rant and this post will probably get deleted for chat - Just wanted to clear this up :D

It's a meal substitute distributed through a multi-level marketing system, I think. It costs around RM 150 for a tub that lasts a month. Google for sales agent.    The other lazy way to lose weight is to go on a low-carb diet. Abstain from starch /complex carbs such as rice, bread and pasta, consume only small amount of sugar and eat mostly protein and lots of vegetables. Be sure that you drink enough water too to avoid digestive problem.     I have seen friends losing 5 to 10 kg in 2 months on this low-carb diet. But unfortunately, it could encourage build up of cholesterol and other health problem if prolonged.  http://www.thedietchannel.com/Protein-di...  So it really should be a short-term drastic solution. Once you have achieved encouraging result give yourself a little break and slowly adjust to a more balanced diet. Learn to enjoy exercise and do it regularly.

Otherwise, it's 2 hours of sitting in bumper to bumper traffic.|`|UV8bN0Giaa	I wholeheartedly agree with DON W that the Air & Space Museum Annex which is located right off Route 28 adjacent to Dulles Airport would be your BEST CHOICE in view of your time restraints etc.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Rather than trying to make it downtown, instead head over to the Smithsonian's Air & Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Building, which is right on the edge of Dulles Airport.  There's a connecting bus from the airport which will only take a few minutes, and you can take your time looking at the exhibits.    http://www.nasm.si.edu/UdvarHazy/    If you have your heart set on getting to the main Air & Space Museum (or other Smithsonian museums) downtown, you could make it if you take a taxi both ways, since it's not rush hour and the trip will only take about an hour each way.  Expect the trip to be expensive though.

Fr den Louvre gilt: Beschr?nke Dich auf das wesentliche, was Du dir unbedingt anschauen m?chtest. Oder verteile deine Louvre-Besuche auf mehrere Tage.  Ein Bummel auf der Avenue des Champs Elysees ist Pflicht.  Vom Arc de Triumph gehst du ber die Avenue Kleber bis zum Trocadero. Von dort aus hast einen geeigneten Anblick auf dem Eiffelturm.    Der Invalidendom mit dem Sarkophag Napoleons fand ich auch sehenswert.

Ti consiglio soprattutto le lande desolate del nord, le contee di Mayo Sligo e Donegal. Paesaggi mozzafiato, scogliere a picco sul mare...|`|3c5eb0161ab5b89442c841c4499a0f2daa	Ciao!  2 considerazioni. L'Irlanda  bella  tutto l'anno ma vivresti la vacanza diversamente a seconda della stagione in cui la visiti.   Se vai in estate, probabilmente non devi neppure portare l'ombrello. Sar verde e con vento (parlo soprattutto della costa Est che conosco meglio) ma non patirai troppo il freddo (almeno di giorno).  Suggerisco di andare a vedere: Dublino citt per la sera,   Howth summit e fare la passeggiata che porta al faro durante il giorno ( alla periferia nord di Dublino)   Fare un coast to coast Dublino - Galway e andare a vedere il bellissimo promontorio mozzafiato (se non soffri di vertigini!)|`|a0534634b9a4e387e6c28a7b102e37d2aa	Ciao...io sono tornata stamane da Dublino! Il periodo migliore  giugno /luglio ma non ti fidare e portati abbigliamento a strati (anche maglioni pesanti, settimana scorsa si oscillava tra i 12 e i 18 gradi!). Se hai abbastanza tempo ti consiglio di volare fino a Dublino e noleggiare un'auto (rcordati che guidano "al contrario" rispetto a noi!) e visitare l'Irlanda del Nord (Belfast, per poi andare in alto fino alle Giant's Causeway e al ponte di corda), da l vai in Donegal e poi il Connemara, visita Galway e l vicino le splendide Cliff's of Moher (se puoi affronta anche gli 8 km di mare e visita una delle Aran Island che si trovano di fronte alle Cliff). Scendi ancora e visita Dingle e il ring of Kerry. Arriva fino a COrk che tra tutte  la citt che amo di pi (forse anche perch ci sono stata per pi tempo!) e poi torna verso Dublino. Pernotta nei b&b che sono puliti e accoglienti (beh...un po' meno a Dublino!)  Dublino  molto carina e giovane, se vuoi qualche consiglio su dove andare a mangiare fammelo sapere.  Buona vacanza se decidi di andare!

181afc46a68e81839e75f210b85c4d59aa	Non  impossibile, anzi nella stagione estiva,  molto frequente, l'unica cosa che ora siamo un p avanti con le date!!    Tratto da irlandando  ____________________________________  In Irlanda lavori stagionali e temporanei, soprattutto nel settore turistico e della   ristorazione, sono piuttosto diffusi tra i cittadini stranieri che spesso lavorano per pagarsi un soggiorno linguistico in questo paese.   Di durata variabile, da alcune settimane ad alcuni mesi, questo tipo di impieghi sono generalmente disponibili durante tutto lanno, sebbene lofferta sia maggiore nei mesi estivi e nel periodo pre-natalizio.     Coloro che partono allavventura con un limitato bagaglio di conoscenza dellinglese e con lintenzione di imparare la lingua sul posto, potranno cercare lavoro direttamente al loro arrivo in Irlanda, portando il proprio curriculum in giro.   Qualora non si voglia andare a bussare porta a porta per le vie di Dublino a elemosinare un posto di lavoro, ci si pu rivolgere alle agenzie di collocamento locali, anche se la maggior parte delle offerte viene pubblicata sui giornali, nei posti di lavoro stessi (negozi, ristoranti e pub, infatti,  indicano in vetrina i posti di lavoro vacanti) e su pubblicazioni specializzate (ad esempio, la Vacation Work Publications pubblica ogni anno alcuni fascicoli con indirizzi di fattorie, centri vacanza, alberghi, etc. che offrono lavoro stagionale in molti paesi  non solo europei - tra cui lIrlanda. Tra queste Summer Jobs Abroad e "Work your way around the world").     Generalmente per i lavori stagionali non vengono richieste referenze e non sempre  necessario avere esperienza.    possibile trovare lavoro nel settore agricolo, in alberghi, ristoranti, pub, ostelli della giovent e nei negozi, oltre che nel settore ambientale ed in alcuni centri vacanze (soprattutto se si ha la fortuna di esseri padroni della lingua).   In tal caso,  importante cominciare a cercare lavoro in anticipo dall'Italia e fissare, magari, dei colloqui direttamente da qui, cos non si rischia di arrivare sul posto scoraggiati e senza sapere dove sbattere la testa.     Unaltra possibilit di impiego, per giovani tra i 18 e i 28 anni,  quella come au pairs (alla pari), se si intende restare per alcuni mesi. Di solito non viene richiesta un'ottima conoscenza della lingua inglese, ma obiettivamente  preferibile per capire e farsi capire meglio!   Oltre a un certificato medico occorre presentare delle referenze ed avere unassicurazione medica privata. La sistemazione  presso una famiglia e lorario di lavoro settimanale, suddiviso in 5 giorni, non supera le 30 ore.   Oltre al vitto e allalloggio generalmente viene offerta una modesta retribuzione (70-80 ). Il modo migliore per trovare lavoro alla pari  quello di registrarsi presso unagenzia che abbia buona reputazione in Italia (per esempio Au Pair International -   http://www.au-pair-international.com/irl... o direttamente in Irlanda (per esempio Swan Training Institute  www.sti.ie)  oppure consultare la seguente pubblicazione Au pair and Nannys guide to working abroad (Susan Griffith & Sharon Legg.

Inoltre, almeno sulla South west, prima prenoti e meno spendi (non  sempre cosi qui) e se sei fortunato riesci a volare per 99 dollari da New York fino a Las Vegas (quasi 6 ore di volo), con tasse aereoportuali molto pi basse che da noi.Inoltre mi sembra che venga comunque offerto da bere e uno snack.    Per quanto riguarda invece la tratta Nord-Atlantica, linee low cost per gli USA non mi sembra ci siano, tuttavia c' una compagnia, che opera in regime di low cost, almeno per quanto riguarda le politiche tariffarie, che vola dal Regno Unito e Parigi verso il Canada, la Zoomairlines.

06f2eb2f7d00c648750c5d8da78dbb25aa	Ci sono stata cinque o sei anni fa...posto stupendo come tutta l' Irlanda. C' una strada principale, tipo zona pedonale dove ci sono solo pub o ristoranti... il venerd e il sabato  un inferno (in senso positivo) si forma una specie di serpentone umano da un pub all'altro in cui vieni inglobato, da cui non  possibile uscire e devi bere in ogni pub parlando con chi  davanti a te, che non hai mai visto prima ma che ti offre da bere... Adoro gli Irlandesi.  Dalla zona di Galway partono i traghetti per le isole Aaran, assolutamente da non perdere.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	nella via centrale di galway i pub si susseguono ai ristoranti, x cui c' l'imbarazzo della scelta. se ti va di ascoltare buona musica irlandese dal vivo ti consiglio il king pub, sempre pienissimo ma molto grande x cui trovare posto non dovrebbe essere un problema!!  x le gite c' la classica visita alle aran. da galway partono i traghetti x le isole. puoi fare in giornata o in + giorni, ricordati che alle aran si gira solo in bici, a piedi o a cavallo quindi quando arrivi l ti conviene noleggiare una mountain bike x' vedere tutto a piedi  improponibile a meno che tu possa fermarti diversi giorni.  buon divertimento!|`|99c7f41f75475114b7dad7f4acd73bceaa	Io sono stato a Galway la scorsa estate.  Sinceramente non so indicarti locali particolari, ma sono innamorato di quella cittadina piccola, tipica e piena di gente.  Mi sono bastate le passeggiate per la via principale e la tranquillit dell'Irlanda.|`|65abe6f73b218f0026166aff777b97abaa	citt molto giovane e con l'imbarazzo per scegliere un locale dove passare la serata .. ma ti prego non ti limitare solo alla citt ... i dintorni sono ancora meglio .. scogliere piccoli villaggi .. verdi pascoli ... insomma prima visita la citt ma poi hai l'obbligo di uscirne ...
89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	le spiagge + belle sono alle keys (key west in particolare) oppure a nord di miami tipo pompano beach, delray beach e tutte quelle in quella zona, se guardi una cartina vedrai che sono paesi uno attaccato all'altro. personalmente consiglio pompano beach, la spiaggia  fantastica. buon viaggio!!|`|03e4d30735a7e18028e8ebc08c6b730caa	Vai a Fort Lauderdale.

Buona vacanza!!!|`|5c89b2d2c55087b81a29082d670f8ce4aa	Se stai nella zona di Miami vai a i Keys West( los cayos) la prima isola che trovi si chiama isla morada, ma, secondo me le spiagge Pi belle si trovano nel nort della florida, Tipo: boca raton, Maratona e tutte quelle della zona the west palm beach, per favore!! evita miami beach  bella di sera!!!, il mare non  cosi bello e soprattuto costa moltissimo!!!|`|fc9d9b1e67d5672fc8ffa5ba40e9f3a2aa	Le isole Keys !   Vai anche a Palm Beach se puoi, non andare a Miami Beach,  come stare al centro di NY all' ora di punta.|`|a1c4079ac30ca7c102912d6d1a9cc7dcaa	A me sinceramente non e' dispiaciuta neanche South Beach. Ma stai attento anche solo a prendere il caffe' lungo la spiaggia perche' hanno dei prezzi allucinanti! E attenzione anche a lasciare l'asciugamano o altro incustodito!|`|ad5d671a39fca33ab186eed618defb98aa	Mi dissocio tquasi totalmente con Cannella perch in Florida ci sono stato e, in particolare a South Beach ho passato pi di un mese e andavo a fare il bagno lasciando la mia roba in spiaggia senza problemi. South Beach  meno cara di certe localit turistiche italiane.... Per quello che riguarda le spiagge direi fra quelle menzionate sono TUTTE belle ma quella che mi  piaciuta di pi  Panama City Beach..... Se ti servono info della Florida, contattami (son gi stato parecchie volte)

Poi conosci un sacco di amici...|`|eb4e6e1af78198f86221d94f4e7a6c9aaa	Ciao,    Nel 1997 feci il mio primo "Viaggio" con la V maiuscola, ed era proprio negli States!     Ero con un piccolo gruppo di amici e l'itinerario l'abbiamo definito in linea di massima prima della partenza ma poi adattato sul posto. Avevamo 31 giorni a disposizione nei quali abbiamo attraversato gli USA da ovest ad est in macchina (due monovolume), passando per 15 stati oltre al Canada, da Los Angeles a New York per un totale di 14.000 km...    L'itinerario era pi o meno:    Los Angeles -> San Diego -> San Francisco -> Yosemite -> Death Valley -> Las Vegas -> Brice Canyon -> Zion NP -> Rafting sul Colorado -> Arches NP -> Grand Canyon -> Mesa Verde -> 4 coners -> Dino's NP -> Yellowstone -> Glacier NP // Calgary -> Banff NP -> Regina -> North & South Dakota, Monte Rushmore -> Chicago, Detroit, Toronto, Niagara Falls, New York City (a grandi linee...)    Il viaggio  stato fantastico, met delle notti le abbiamo passate in motel (in USA esistono due catene "low cost" molto famose, la  "motel 6" e la "super 8", oggi con 50$ dormi in 4 ;-) e l'altra met in camping nei vari parchi naturali in tenda.    Viaggiare in auto negli USA  molto semplice, basta la patente Italiana anche se quella internazionale qualcuno la chiede, ma non  obligatoria. Se si ha meno di 25 anni si paga una sopratassa al "car hire", i contratti includono pi o meno tutto compresi 2 guidatori. quelli extra si pagano in pi    Se vuoi dei riferimenti precisi scrivimi, vedr di farti avere qualcosa di pi concreto... qui occuperei 30 pagine di Answers ;-)    Ciao!|`|4ac916ff607bebc0852b2d659814e512aa	ancora non lo fatto ma mi sa che si avvicina il momento di farlo anche perche gli usa sono unici......|`|020b266f5e00b2b7481a2ad92dff7cb2aa	no :)|`|ad5d671a39fca33ab186eed618defb98aa	L' ho fatto pi volte in Florida!!!!!!!!!!

Sono uno molto attivo quindi mi butto in un mare di attivit, visito il luogo, mi informo sulle attrazioni locali ma mi piace anche rilassarmi. Credo che si possa trovare un buon connubio tra cultura e relax senza esagerare in ambo i sensi, poi molto dipende dai gusti. Conosco alcuni che starebbero 12 ore al sole in spiaggia ed altri che non fanno altro che girare per musei. Per me sono esagerati entrambi ma, ripeto,  una questione di gusti.|`|ddd562ac4be585da24dc0b32c943edb7aa	Mi piace visitare sempre posti nuovi,conoscere la loro cultura,visitare i musei,conoscere le loro specialit gastronomiche.Il relax lo posso trovare anche a casa mia.

La Svizzera... vediamo...     - per la cioccolata,  - per gli orologi,  - per i formaggi,   - per la montagna - panorami (se ti piacciono),   - per le gite in bicicletta,   - per la benzina (meno cara),    - per i grotti (i grotti sono dei posti dove si pu andare a    mangiare. Sono posti alla buona, ma si mangia benissimo.     In questi luoghi  tipica la cucina ticinese, cucina del posto    dove si possono mangiare formaggi, selvaggina, bere vino del     posto ecc...)  - per aprire un conto in banca (se ne avessi il bisogno). Nella mia         citt... ci sono solo 95 banche... diciamo...ci sono pi banche     che cabine telefoniche...    I posti pi belli da visitare nella regione dove abito io, a mio avviso sono:     LUGANESE:   Lago di Lugano  Swissminiatur - Melide  Fabbrica del cioccolato (Alprose) - Caslano (regione Malcantone basso)  Monte Br - Lugano  Monte San Salvatore - Lugano  Tutta la regione del Malcantone. Formata da piccoli paesini (alcuni solo 50 abitanti). Ci sono vari percorsi per fare gite, ideale per bambini e anche per animali). Ti sto lasciando link (secondo)  Monte Lema - Miglieglia (regione Malcantone alto)  Isole di Brissago - Brissago (Luganese)  Casin di Lugano - Lugano  Casin Campione d'Italia - Campione d'Italia (Luganese)  Morcote - (Luganese)  Kurhaus - Cademario (Malcantone alto) - (ti sto lasciando link del posto - il primo)      BELLINZONESE:     Visita dei 3 castelli - Bellinzona    LOCARNESE:   Lago di Locarno - Locarno    VALLI:   Val Bedretto  Valle Maggia  Val Verzasca  Leventina      Ovviamente ci sono anche le piste da sci, nel caso tu ci volessi andare per l'inverno.   Nella regione del Ticino nn ce ne sono di molto belle, ma nel resto della Svizzera ne trovi tante.   In caso fossi interessato allo sci, fammi sapere.     Spero di averti incuriosito un pochino.

Anche se affitti un'auto, non  un salasso.  Fatto salvo il biglietto aereo che avrai gi pagato, potresti cavartela con meno che a stare in Italia.  L'ideale per  una  carta di credito (o due) che ti permetta di sforare un po' il bilancio se ne vale la pena.  Ricorda che negli USA non hai nessun diritto ad assistenza sanitaria e cose simili, quindi un'assicurazione potrebbe pararti bene le spalle.    Ovviamente tutto questo discorso vale se tieni un profilo "basso".  Negli USA c' anche modo di spendere una follia, in quanto "l'offerta"  enorme.

Dice che non  il caso di andarci per turismo, perch non c' un accidente. In totale ci sono circa 300000 abitanti, che non amano particolarmente i turisti.

e00a2482d451174caa6c8f9b599d517faa	Il tuo dubbio, gi ti consegna la risposta su di un piatto d'argento:  Parti.  Facciamo una piccola analisi :    Perche dovresti partire:    1 hai 20!  2 andresti a fare esperienza all'estero, imparando una lingua che al tuo ritorno potresti rivendere tranquillamente.  3 puoi facilmente trovare lavoro (inizierai con lavori pi modesti)  4 Puoi tornare quando vuoi (i tuoi ti accoglieranno a braccia aperte)  5 Allargherai la tua mente e il tuo modo di pensare(crescendo pi in fretta e meglio)    Perch non dovresti partire:  1 Hai un lavoro temporaneo che forse ti rinnovano  2 I tuoi non sono d'accordo    In tutta sincerit, ho vissuto all'estero per brevi periodi se hai la volont il lavoro lo trovi (cameriera, pub,ristoranti per iniziare) sono esperienze che ti fanno crescere, vedrai che i tuoi all'inizio non saranno d'accordo ma poi ti aiuteranno (qualora ne avessi bisogno). Comunque vada ti porterai a casa un bagaglio inestimabile e poi se non vai oggi che hai 20 anni quando parti! Certo che se avessi gi qualcuno in Inghilterra (amici/parenti/conoscenti)sarebbe tutto pi facile, ma anche cos si pu fare tranquillamente! L'ultima domanda: se dovessi litigare con il tuo amico e rimanere sola in Inghilterra avresti dei problemi??? se la risposta  no: vai in camera e prepara lo zaino!|`|1254d7bbe9d83d68b3f41d29714e4c95aa	Penso che la cosa migliore sia quella di partire. considerando la tua giovane et potresti realizzare davvero tanto.

Non saprei quale zona consigliarti per un viaggio, dipende se preferisci una vacanza di mare, oppure visitare siti archeologici o citt coloniali. In Messico c' un'ampia scelta di possibilit.  In Yucatan, per esempio il mare  molto bello e puoi visitare siti archeologici maya. In Chiapas natura selvaggia, villaggi indios, il sito archeologico di Palenque.  La Baja California con i deserti e la migrazione delle balene a febbraio. Quest'ultima  veramente spettacolare!! Nella baia di Guerrero Negro puoi andare in barca ed essere avvicinato balle balene curiose.... fantastico.  Nel Messico centrale ci sono citt molto interssanti come Taxco, Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende, Guadalajara.  E non  da evitare nemmeno Citt del Messico (il DF) che non  poi pi incasinata e inquinata di tante altre metropoli, il centro storico a me  piaciuto molto; vale la pena visitare il museo archeologico e il sito di Teotihuacan (non ricordo come si scrive) a circa 50 Km dal DF.  E poi ci sono i messicani che sono veramente simpatici e cordiali, soprattutto se cerchi di parlare in spagnolo e non in inglese.  Spero di averti dato qualche spunto.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	io x ora sono stata sono nello yucatan e zone limitrofe, mi  piaciuto tantissimo ma questa  solo una piccola parte del messico. spero di riuscire a tornarci presto e visitare anche chiapas e altre zone meno battute.  cmq quello che ho visto io  fatastico, le rovine maya sono molto interessanti e belle da vedere, il mare  quello dei caraibi, x cui cosa vuoi di +???|`|229caa18e73bc4e7cf737f079ed6ae85aa	Bello, molto bello!

British Airways, da sito!!! o al massimo Lufthansa.  la metropolitana si chiama BART (BayAreaRapidTransit) e ti porta in citt dall'aeroporto. E' una metro un po' particolare perch a differenza della metro di Londra, ad esempio, che  una rete fitta che porta ovunque, le varie linee della BART seguono un tragitto comune rettilineo per un bel pezzo.  La citt  bellissima, a piedi e ancora di pi in macchina. Se hai o noleggi la macchina puoi fare la 49 miglia "Scenic Drive", tour panoramico che ti mostra tutta la citt. E' segnalata con dei cartelli blu e bianchi con un aquilotto. Ci impieghi qualche ora e merita. Se sei a piedi, cartina alla mano, ma occhio che le distanze ingannano: la citt  davvero grande, e faticosa per via del continuo saliscendi tra le colline, cosa che non prevedi dalle cartine... Ti sconsiglio agosto, uno dei mesi pi freddi, piovosi e nebbiosi l, bens settembre-ottobre!!! Trascorrici qualche giorno almeno.  Della citt mi  piaciuto soprattutto il fatto che da qualsiasi punto tu guardi hai sempre un panorama diverso... spettacolare. Ma non voglio anticiparti pi niente, vai ed esplora.

Non pu andare male, al massimo torni a casa se non ti senti a tuo agio. Cerca lavoro nei call centre, ce ne sono miliardi. E poi goditi l'Irlanda! Buona fortuna!!

E' grande ma piccola allo stesso tempo, offre tantissimo dal punto di vista artistico, culturale, come vita notturna, come gente! ...per, e questa  una mia sensazione, non mi fa sentire piccola, e insignificante come mi accade quando vado per esempio a Parigi. Ha il merito di farti subito entrare nei suoi meccanismi, nei suoi movimenti! Cos senti di viverla veramente...  Filosofie a parte Barcellona  bella architettonicamente. Io adoro Gaud, la sua genialit che ha quasi di mistico. Davanti la Sagrada Familia ho i brividi, tutte le volte che ci vado..eppure  un'opera incompleta...Ma non  solo Gaud, c' il museo di Picasso, il museo della musica, la rambla, il porto vecchio e il mare magnum. Persino il quartiere fieristico ha una sua bellezza, avvenieristico, ultramoderno. L'unica cosa che  brutta ma davvero brutta (ma mette in risalto la bellezza circostante)  il penis, un palazzo osceno. Non sto a dirti cosa rappresenta. Lo avrai capito. Il cibo  squisito, paella e tapas..favolosi! Credimi  una citt magica....ah se ti capitasse di andarci vai in piazza municipio a guardare lo spettacolo delle fontane..incantevole davvero e poco distante la casa di Mies van der Rohe ...se ti piace l'architettura bahuaus.....Barcellona  viva, colorata, allegra,  una citt x i giovani....senza togliere nulla alle meravigliose capitali d'Europa...credimi Barcellona ha qualcosa di diverso che avverti subito quando ci metti piede! ciaooooo|`|935af829a7695b05f6b89ae548cbaf83aa	Di sicuro la Monument Valley al confine tra Arizona e Utah.

48019b04789aa0ac279078db6dcd184daa	Il passaporto deve essere valido per entrare negli States; controlla la data del rilascio del tuo passaporto quindi:  Puoi entrare negli States se hai:  1) un passaporto a LETTURA OTTICA rilasciato o rinnovato PRIMA del 26 Ottobre 2005  oppure  2)passaporto con FOTO DIGITALE rilasciato fra il 26 Ottobre 2005 e il 26 Ottobre 2006  oppure  3)passaporto ELETTRONICO emesso a partire dal 26 Ottobre 2006    Sappi che nel caso tu voglia richiedere un visto turistico al consolato ti dovrai  sottoporrere ad un iter  abbastanza lungo e costoso, gli Stati Uniti infatti cercano di scoraggiare il pi possibile le persone che richiedono il visto, dovrai chiamare il call center del consolato per prendere l'appuntamento per l'intervista, con ampio anticipo.  Il costo del visto, oltre alla spesa per chiamare il call center, dovrebbe aggirarsi sui 100 dollari, a cui devi aggiungere il viaggio nel consolato (Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli a seconda del luogo di residenza). Per qualche oscuro motivo, noto soltanto ai funzionari consolari, pur essendo possibile stampare il visto in tempo reale (come facevano due anni fa), ti verr chiesto di portarti una busta pre-affrancata con posta prioritaria, per rispedirti a casa il passaporto, (c' sempre caso che magari viene perso per strada e cosi non potresti partire), naturalmente il consolato non prende alcuna responsabilit di sorta e l'invio tramite corrieri  espressamente vietato.   Detto ci se viaggi senza visto ti sar possibile rimanere per un periodo massimo do 90 giorni, senza possibilit di prorgare il soggiorno.  Nel bagaglio a mano non dovresti avere, oltre ai comuni oggetti da taglio, alcun liquido o gel o lozione o crema (niente creme, gel, per capelli, profumi, dentifrici ecc....) sappi che il tuo bagalio a mano sar ispezionato manualmente.  Nel bagalio da stiva invece non dovresti portare alcun cibo fresco, soprattutto carne fresca, frutta, verdura.    Per tutte le informazioni riguardanti i documenti consulta il sito del consolato americano (per telefono non viene data ALCUNA informazione - salvo farti chiamare il call center) oppure il link qui sotto.

Ci sono delle escursioni con la barca che ti porta nei golfi vicini.  oppure puoi noleggiere un'auto e andando a nord fare un'escursione nella regione dei laghi.

Molto interessante e con un giorno  la visiti tranquillamente.

Eso de los chiclets tambien es cierto, si puedes llevar muchos dulces de todo tipo y muy posiblmente te tengas que regresar sin ropa (mucha gente te la pide, porque en cuba es muy escasa) otra cosa que no se consigue en Cuba son cremas dentales y jabones, as que si llevas algunos le harias un favor a algunos (la verdades que yo los cambie por algunas artesanias cubanas).    Otra recomendacin es que si puedes llevar agua (se que ahora los aviones a veces no permiten que transportes lquidos) pero la verdad es que cada litro de agua lo compraba en dos o ms dolares (enla Habana en Varadero no necesit comprar agua).    En cuanto eso de la visa y que no tew pertmiten viajar a USA, ya est superado, el gobierno cubano expide una visa en otro documento que no es el pasaporte asi que no queda evidencia de tu visita (por el asunto de quieras ir a USA, que antes los gringos no te permitian entrar).    Suerte|`|2bcd46bf21fbbe1463e0e271f0b9be22aa	Fcil. Ve a una agencia de viajes, compra un paquete para un hotel ms o menos ( el Deauville no te lo recomiendo porque las cucarachas casi te sacan cargando ), como el Riviera, el Vedado, o el Neptuno ( aunque un poco lejos ). No es nada peligroso, puedes andar tranquilamente en la calle por las noches. Puede ir a las playas, muy bonitas por cierto, O puedes ir a museos y diversos sitios histricos. Hay muchas discos y bares donde puedes tomar tranquilamente unos mojitos. O puedes comprar una botella de ron y tomartela en el malecon disfrutando de la brisa marina y cuidandote de tanto jinetero que hay, que es de lo unico que te tendrs que cuidar.

d90d8bd428a8c2c94813864af4a919c6aa	vi consiglio vivamente la California, tra l'altro maggio  il periodo migliore per andarci. Ci sono tantissime cose da vedere, per tutti i gusti, quindi potete stare in mezzo alla natura, come il sequoia national park, il king national park e soprattutto lo yosemite national park che meritano tantissimo.  Vicino avete Las Vegas che non potete perdervela!  San Diego  molto carina, se vi piace vicino a los angeles c' disneyland e universalstudios.  Hollywood e Beverly hills sono molto carine, giusto per passarci qualche giorno e rifarsi gli occhi con le mega tenute delle star.  E in assoluto la citt pi bella  San Francisco, che non ti bastano nemmeno 2 settimane per vederla tutta, ci sono tantissimo cose, e la parte pi bella  senza ombra di dubbio Fisherman's wharf, con tutti i moli e tutti quei negozietti carini.  Vi consiglio veramente di andarci, merita!|`|21b7f3f7ae87ad08016aa48a6632d0a3aa	Il gran canyon non te lo puoi perdere!!!!  uno spettacolo mozzafiato ,unico!    ...visto che ti sposi...il top sarebbe poter prenotare da dormire proprio li dentro ....devi muoverti per fissare perch s che fissano 6 mesi prima ! ...

A me piace vedere poche cose bene piuttosto che fare tutte le citt senza vedere nulla. Il compromesso ideale credo sia la California con volo che ferma a New York dove potete passare 4-5 giorni. Ti consiglio la California perch  facilissima da girare con un'auto e c' tutto. Puoi fare Joshua Tree, Yosemite, Death Valley, Big Sur per goderti la natura, con fermate a San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Palm Springs se vi piace il genere. Los Angeles  bellissima (io vivo qui da 4 mesi) ma evita i tour che ti fanno scendere a Hollywood, poi ti scaricano un'ora a Santa Monica, ti riimpacchettano e ti portano altrove. A me piace passeggiare tra i grattacieli di Downtown, perdermi a Venice Beach ma anche nei quartieri storici come El Pueblo. C' tutto quello che vuoi in California, se preferisci il mare puoi scendere fino in Messico. Anche San Diego  molto carina. E non dimenticare il clima, da aprile a novembre si gira in t-shirt e calzoncini...

All'estero facilemnte paghi oltre un euro una bottiglia, al supermercato.  Il vino non  pi detto che costi meno in Italia, anzi viaggiando in Germania ne trovo a volta anche a meno che qui, e vino ottimo.  Se vai nell'Europa del nord i trasporti (trani autobus) ti costeranno pi che in Italia (ma con i treni ci staimo pian piano avvicinando ad altri paesi oltralape).  In Inghilterra, inutile dirlo sar tutto o molto pi caro o pi caro che da noi. In altri paesi, dipende.I formaggi e latticini (latte, yoghurt), costano meno in Germania, Austria che da noi.   La benzina  cara ormai ovunque, persino nei nuovi paesi UE, supera gi abbondantemente l'euro al litro, ad eccezione del Lussemburgo, dove la benzina costa ancora qualcosa in meno.  Le sigarette, eccetto Inghilterra, costano ormai come in Italia in tutto il nord Europa, nei nuovi paesi UE invece costano meno della met.  Andare al ristorante oltralape (Germania, Austria, Polonia ecc..) costa meno, non c' il coperto, e i piatti sono sempre serviti con vari contorni inclusi, la birra al ristorante costa meno che in Italia.  Noleggiare auto, almeno in Germania, pu essere molto meno caro che in Italia, una compagnia, Alamo,  ormai da mesi si fa pagare soltanto 27 euro al giorno, km. illimitati e tutto compreso.|`|851b3608388e014eca065fb5fe404f1daa	Vino, formaggi e salumi.|`|349597932e3b4d7744bb9673ef742810aa	sognare costa meno...sei nella tua stessa nazione...:-))|`|2371437863fe7ff3b80d1067e5c251feaa	Il caff in Italia costa pochissimo rispetto all'estero.

Puoi trovare alcune volte delle occassioni  ma se sono delle cose preziose o belle di fattura di certo non le paghi 20.00 euro.   Io  quando viaggio compro poche cose ma belle. Infatti ho smesso di portare ricordini sciocchi a tutti i miei amici.
