20090203111541AAWER3Z	Travel;United States;Washington, D.C.	Why doesn't it snow in Washington DC?	Seriously.  I don't mean a "sprinkling" or a trace of snowfall. Proper snow in which you can make a snowman.  It just does not seem to snow at all. Invariably, weather forecasts for snow end up being rain/sleet, or the storm misses entirely.  What I find most strange about this is:      1. It is not like it does not get cold in Washington D.C..  There's plenty of 34 degrees and under days.  So it is not a question of it being too warm.      2. I have lived here since 1996.  Up until about 2003, there used to be several snowstorms per winter, with proper snowfall.      3. It does snow in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, West Virginia.  What is it about Washington DC, that the snow *always* misses it?      Is there a geographic explanation for this?

The two year old is, well in his terrible two's and can be extremely difficult.When he wants to see and do something but can't, he screams and cries.  I know he won't understand standing in line.  Just going to a simple amusement park or Chuck E Cheese is miserable because he cries when seeing  something and can't just go do it immediately. On the other hand, my almost 5 year old is so into the Disney princesses and at the perfect age and  I don't think she should have to suffer because of her brother's terrible two's.

A few years back, my family and I decided to go up to Port Austin for the day.  For those that live in michigan, thats "upper" lower peninsula.  anyways on the way home we stayed at a hotel and it was a holiday inn FOR SURE.  but im not sure the city it was in.  it had quite a few pools and a few different activities in the pools, such as a water slide and kiddie pool.  I might be wrong on the details but I know that the one pool was extremely big.  it was about 3-5 floors.  if anybody has any idea what im talking about, please give me city names or ideas to where you think it is located.  Remember, its in MICHIGAN.      The reason I'm asking is because I want to take my boyfriend and myself there for the weekend.  It was a really fun place from what I can remember and anybody knows anything about what I'm talking about, that would be great!   all answers and help greatly appreciated!

20090222220408AAkLM1y	Travel;Asia Pacific;Singapore	Are Singaporean Girls pretty in general?	If we talk about appearance in general, mainly face, figure and skin quality, how pretty do you think SGP girls are compared to Japan, Korea and China girls. Personally i have been in SGP for more than 11 years. And i found the ladies here are generally quite bad in quality. especially the skin and the face part. Skins are generally dark and coarse, some like the Moon surface. And the shape of face also pretty peculiar. I don't mean to offend anyone, but that's just the feedback i got from my friends also. I am thinking to seek feedbacks from guys who have enough exposure in Japan or Korea or China also. And compare it with the ladies there. If you are a lady; or a guy who spends most of time in SGP, ur taste might be different (so please do not put ur comment here).
