I do not have a car and ride public transportation 2 hours each way to get to my job and I go to college full time in the evening. My employer told us today that 2 weeks a month we would need to work later. This will not work for me because I'm in the middle of my semester and wouldn't be able to make it to school on time. I told my employer that I can't work these new hours because of school and they asked me if I was quitting. I told them no and they said that either way I would never get unemployment because if I left early the first day of the new hours they would say I abandoned my job. What is unemployment for if I can't ever use it?

Career experts, aviators, psychiatric technicians, fitness trainers, Teachers/Coaches and anyone else with first hand knowledge in these respective areas, this is for you.      I am 29. I have a 10 month old baby girl. I recently passed the GED test with my scores in the top 86%-99% rank, meaning in the top 1%-14% in each of the subjects given. I spent 10 years as a critically successful artist. However, due to the financial aspect(I refuse to go commercial and I have a family to feed), and the fact that I'm burned out, I would like to take full advantage of my recent layoff from my "day job", and find a new passion/career and excel in it, both for myself and my family.      After an entire year of 'deliberation' with myself and my wife, I have formulated a plan to obtain a vocational certificate while I am unemployed, and then to get a better job than what I had before, so that I can realistically pursue my degree.      However, I have had a great deal of stress stemming from my background, which is where you guys come in:      - Ages 15-18, I had spent some time in two private psychiatric facilities on four different occasions for depression/suicidal thoughts. Two of those were for documented 'attempts'. I was just crying for help and going about it the wrong way.      .Obviously, I dropped out of high school. I now have a GED.      .I have a misdemeanor "hit and run (property damage)" on my record(2004).   -4 years probation for this incident, 3 years for the hit and run, and 1 year for driving without insurance.   -I spent a night in the holding cell (2004).   -4 days in county jail as a result of a "failure to appear" stemming from that same case (2006).   *Apparently, if this charge isn't already, I can have it exphunged.      .The car that I had was repo'd due to the fact that it wasn't insured on the night of the accident.   -that has account has been settled and taken care of, monetarily anyway.      I ran myself into $3,000 in credit card debt with business that I started in 2006 and incorporated in 2007. One of the reasons why I am burned out.      I know that this is a train wreck, but I need another shot. Question is who'll grant me that opporitunity? The choice in certificate will also effect what degree that I major in.Here are the vocational fields that I am considering:      .Aviation certificate- civilian or military(Pursue an Aviation, Science, or Psychology degree after)   .Psychiatric Technician certificate (Psychology)   .Fitness/Athletic Trainer certificate (Kinsieology, Psych, definately a teaching credential)   .Health Care certificate- Psych(as mentioned), EKG Tech, Dental Asst, etc.      I've researched ALL of these to DEATH. I can repeat the cert guidline info backwards and forwards, I do have an interest in ALL of them with the execption of Health Care other than Psychology. But, which is the more promising field? Who will hire me?      I'm going to exphunge my record, but how far will that stretch on my record?

When I first started they told me eventually they will take me permanent and will be given benefits and all. It has yet to happen, beginning of this year,they hired a new person. They gave me a salary cut, and are now paying the new person more than what I'm getting paid. We are both doing the same thing, only thing is she has a bit more experience than I do. I couldnt believe how this whole thing turned, I mean; they supposedly dont have enough budget to take me on perm but they have enough to hire a new $40,000 a year employee??   On friday, I got ANOTHER salary cut and my hours as well. my boss stated that it was due to work poor work performance. I got demotivated to do anything. The only reason they choose not to fire me is because they're such cheap f*cks that they dont wanna pay unemployment. They're pushing me to quit. Is there anything I can do about this legally?    he has shown biasm. he said from this point on and this only goes for me and no one else in the company: I must dress in business casual while everyone is wearing jeans everyday, I dont have anymore computer access and I need a computer to do my job and my rate has been cute, total - $7 dollars an hour...It's making me very stressed...any advice?

I did not know they were brothers, I complained because of his behavior. His sister did not terminate me, she gave theoretical training in classroom. The supervisor that provoked the suspension for funds for the training was another one. She was afraid from me, because I am bilingual and I have a university degree. This supervisor asked my password and I gave it to her, because I thought she wanted to help. Next day I got a call telling me the funds for the training were suspended. I asked to talk to the higher level, and they did not let me. They escorted me to the door. I was never hired or discharged, the funds for training were suspended, anyways I have been a victim two times and I do not know if to inform all of this in the job application to the future employer, I have the feeling that this is going to close the doors for future job opportunities.  I am already applying for uc benefits. What should I do?

BUT if u can't afford it you can get 10 clients interested (meaning they at least register on the site for more info) instead and that will have payed for ur b/g check. i'm prolly gonna do that but still, the lady said i could make about $600 a week once i get the hang of things, and it sounds too good 2 be true. But they're registered with the better business beaurau. (under "ASI" cuz thats what the company name used to be). i wanna go for it, just a bit nervous. Snagajob.com did have 2 scam "jobs" as a survey taker & airline tickets seller which we all know is fake, but so far those are the only frauds i've come across. Ne1 had experience in telemarketing in the US or with this company? Thanks.

20090223115953AAlx73D	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What do I ask a Real Estate expert?	I have a meeting with a real estate company ( First Team) that is extremely popular here in Orange, ca. I want to take classes, and so they set me up to talk to someone about what happens in the business, before I go to their seminar.    The lady who set me up, told me to ask any questions, but I have NO IDEA what to ask?    She also said that the meeting would "decide" if they wanted to sponsor me?    I didn't know they could do this, but I planned on working with their company anyways, because they have a lot of the listings here, and they are not one of the bigger businesses, which I think would be expensive to work for....   Any suggestions?

I had to freeze my account today after I wanted to check my statement and it said that my debit card is not authorized. There was a direct debit set up by with Cahoot for 5000pounds! I have no idea how it could happen and the bank had to freeze my account. My question is, will I get that money back? I mean I have debit card, no credit card, so I think that it could not be taken because it's not a credit card. It said on my statement that last week, twice cahoot took 5000pounds but returned it the next day because there was not enough funds on my account, so I guess I will get it back.   First time it happened to me, does anyone know how long it may take to get sorted?

I am wondering, because the ex got into trouble for taking the EIC, etc. that he was not entitled to last year - is my return being automatically flagged by the IRS this year so they do not make the same mistake and issue him the big refund (which he is having to re-pay).

My partner has been offered a sales job paying ￡30 a day, for an 8 hour shift.  I calculate that to be ￡3.75 per hour.  This is a 40 hours a week post.  He has been told that if he earns enough commission, that will make his pay up to the legal minimum of ￡5.73 an hour, but commission rates have not been specified for the job.      I have worked out that if he doesn't earn any commission, that is considerably less than minimum wage, so only the commission will make up the shortfall.  I thought minimum wage was guaranteed, regardless of commission, and that commision can't be used to make up the difference.  Can anyone guide me as to the legal position on this issue, please?      Thank you in advance for your answers.

Banks provide debt financing and business loans and most conservatively seek to secure the loan with premium collateral.  In return, they seek a modest return and charge a modest handling fee.      I would like to get to know Firms who are willing to legally do debt financing (eg. junk bonds or collateralized debt) in a situtation where the collateral and company may not be so straight forward or conservative.  I already know of a few sources, some more conservative than others; however, I am looking for firms who may have more aggressive and flexible requirements and who ideally can do business in Asia.      Thus, I am not looking for the normal Tier 1 banks as they are the conservative ones.  I am also not looking for illegal loan sharks.  I'm looking for those who are risk takers where they would like to invest their money in attractive new businesses that may not yet have revenue or profit, but would like to do invest (equity) or ideally do debt since debt may provide safer recourse.      Any recommended contacts would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, if you have deals as well, I'd be interested.

I moved to another town in the meantime and I want to stay here due to family reasons, not coming back to my old employer. I spoke to manager on the phone and explained her situation, she was understanding. I have good relationship with them.   I recently found a new job, they are now contacting my referees.   My questions is, at what point I should I hand in my written notice? Now, or wait till references and occupational health clears, after I receive letter of employment or after I receive starting date in writing from new employer ? (the new employer was not sure about starting date, they hinted it might be somewhat delayed, which is worrying me).   I have one month notice in my contract. My current manager would like me to give my notice as soon as possible, now that she knows I am not coming back, because it will allow her to start recruitment process sooner. New employer is another NHS trust.   I will be grateful for advice, thanks!

My fiance and I are looking to buy a house, and we found a promising property that we really like.  There is a lot of work that needs to be done, but most of it we can do ourselves.  The main thing that we can't do that needs to be done is fixing the roof.  Would a bank ever agree to a roofing allowance?  It would be nice to have re-roofing be covered under the loan, since we wouldn't be able to afford it out of pocket.  The property has been on the market for quite a while now and the price keeps dropping, they've switched real estate companies 2 or 3 times... I'm sure they are really just looking to get rid of it, but I'd almost be willing to pay MORE than the asking price if they would throw the roof in too...

They told me I would have to create my own user ID and log in to pay bills myself to be able to discuss the bill in the future.  Ok, what sense does this make?  I log in and pay a bill then my husband logs in an hour later under his own name and pays it again b/c he won't see my pmnt since it was done under my name?

20090223122956AAUN9qI	Business & Finance;Investing	Would the investment banks have bought sub prime loans if they were not able to have them sold them rated AAA?	It appears to me that the AAA rating assigned  to bonds, made up of sub prime mortgage securities, made the sub prime loans feasible. After all if the investment bankers could not sell the sub prime mortgage bonds why would they buy the sub prime loans in the first place? The investment bankers probably knew they could get the  credit rating agencies into assigning the AAA rating. Then investors would be confident they were buying a safe conservative investment that was rated AAA from the investment bank.      It appears that the AAA bond rating is the linchpin in whole sub prime structure.      What do you think?

On 2-11-09 our landlord informed my wife and I that she and her family wanted to move back into the house that we had been renting from her for nearly 2 years. She stated that she would let us out of our lease (which runs through June) if we found a place as well as provide us with a letter of recommendation. 9 days later on 2-19-09 we informed her that we had found a place. This is where things take a twist. She was shocked we had found a place so quickly. We realize that we may have to foresake the deposit 750-800$ as a result. We have written documentation from her that acknowledges she would let us out of the lease, paperwork which states how good of tenants we are and an audio recording of her in which she acknowledges the arrangement. (You can record by law any conversation that you are directly involved in btw.) I too believe that she has spent our deposit $ and that it has not been secured in an account. I believe I read where this might be an issue which would void the lease?  I have been in contact with 2 area lawyers but as of yet not heard back as to how strong of a case I have should things progress. Ideas? Help?

20090223124811AAOa3VQ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does anyone know where to find information on the Mortgage Rescue or Hope for Homeowners bills/acts?	I've heard there are Gov't programs available now for homeowners who have mortgages far over the current value of their home? I mortgaged my house for $195k when I bought it 4 years ago. Since then the value has dropped to about $140k (maybe even less,) my husband hasn't had work in over a year and my home business is seriously struggling. From what I have heard, they can mortgage your house for its current value and get the bank to waive off the rest. Then when you sell it the gov't and the bank both get a piece of anything you sell it for over the mortgaged amount.      However, with all the people trying to profit online from programs like this by becoming go betweens, I am having a tremendous amount of trouble finding real information on it or how to go about it.

I need to be able to raise my credit score pretty fast, like in 3 months or so. I only have 2 credit scores. One is 614 and another is like 530. I need to be able to have a mid fico of 580 in a hurry, which is 3 total scores. I was told that if I get 2 or 3 secured credit cards, use them and then pay it off at the end of the month, it will bring my credit score up rapidly. But I was also told that if I were to get a few secured loans and do the same, it would help me out better due to the interest rates and fees on a secured credit card. So I pretty much have two questions here. Is it better if I get 2 or 3 secured credit cards or get 2 or 3 secured loans? Also is it better to have 2 or 3 of either of these or one big one?

20090223132128AA7XIPN	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Bringing Letter of Recommendation to job interview?	Hi there,      I have a job interview coming up on Thursday, and it's not for anything fancy, just for a part-time physical therapy aide job. My situation is as such...I used to work for a physical therapy clinic with a wonderful staff and supervisor, until they left to start their own private clinic. Two months before I was laid off, we got a new set of staff and a new manager, and to make a long story short, he, well, laid me off, in very nice/polite terms (oh, you were a great person but good people get fired all the time, blah blah). Anyway, a few months ago, I got an interview at a physical therapy clinic for an aide position, and everything went extremely well. The clinic director was just about to give me a position, but then informed me a few days later that he spoke to my ex-boss and he did not give a good reference about me (apparently, there were things that I was doing that he wasn't entirely happy with, but nobody ever bothered to tell me). So he cost me one job (there are other details pertaining to this that I won't go into).      So my question is, would it be okay for me to use letters of recommendation, in addition to one or two professional call references at my next job interview? At that last interview, the interviewer never asked me for my references, so obviously my ex-boss is the only person he talked to.       I don't want this to happen again, and I have two very nice and positive letters of recommendation written for me by a professor from last semester, as well as my supervisor from the old staff that I used to work with. I've also been volunteering and my supervisor said she'd be happy to provide me with a positive reference, as well as an old coworker. So when I go to my new interview, even if they don't ask for references, would it be considered ethical for me to just hand it to them at the end of the interview? And should I request that they not talk to my ex-boss (he's also only known me for 2 months) on the job application, and just give them HR's number instead? And if so, what should I put down for the reason for not contacting them?      Thanks for reading this :)

Apologies in advance if it is long winded. I won a bag on eBay. The seller advertised it as being a genuine Mulberry bag. The bag arrived a few days later and it was evidently a counterfeit. I paid with paypal. I contacted the seller who did not respond so I opened an dispute with paypal. The seller immediately refunded me my money (without me sending the bag back first). The seller claimed she did not know the bag was a replica. Her behaviour was quite strange to say least, but noting can be proved. Paypal told me to only return the bag to the sellers confirmed payal address to cover myself. I gave Paypal the address the seller gave me but Paypal informed me that the address which the seller has given me to return the bag is not the address paypal have on file for the seller       I contacted the seller and sent at least 5 emails to the seller over a two week period explaining that I need to return her item to the confirmed address that paypal hold for her- 3 weeks later she replied demanding to know where her bag was. I forwarded the emails which I had sent to her and explained to her that I had tried  on 5 occasions to contact her. She is refusing to give me the address paypal have on file for her for some reason? Also, the seller is now accusing me of not returning her bag. I have no wish to keep her bag- she has already refunded me the money and I want to return it to her, but I am concerned that if I don't send the bag back to the confirmed address I will not be covered if the item goes missing?      I contacted paypal again and asked what difference  would make as I would send the item back Recorded or Special delivery- so if the item got lost or damaged in the post everything would be covered; they informed me that the seller could claim she did not receive it as long as someone else signed for it I would not be covered by Royal Mail as the item would not technically be lost/missing?       Then about half an hour ago, the seller sent me an email threatening to contact the Police as I have not returned her bag! I attempted to explain again that if she would give me her address I would return the bag with immediate effect. She then replied saying, "My dear Rhianna you have just made a big mistake" (!!)      So...what should I do?

I thought that we would either file married joint and split the refund, or we could file legally separated since as of december 12th we were legally separated, and then we would just each claim 2 kids each... hes really only entitled to one i feel since one child moved with him on december 23.       well he already took all the stuff down to h and r, and is claiming all 4 kids. so when i go to file i have no dependants, even though im the one who takes care of them.    can he do this?   i dont care about getting audited really, i have all of our info for the past 7 yrs. he doesnt have anything.

20090223140734AAzDqoF	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Will i get fired if i confront my boss about this?	When I started my job close to a year ago, I started as a Personnel Assistant for a staffing company. My main job duties were to answer phone, make start packets for new hires, and keep up with the start to finish of these new hires. Background checks, drug screening results etc. Pretty easy. As time went on I became more familiar with Payroll, I helped out here and there and now I basically handle all aspects of Payroll and my original job duties. Since we handle all of our new hires nationally, everything we do is sent out through fed-ex packets. So when we have a rush of 30 new hires beginning in a week, its a lot for me to keep up with. Did they return all their paperwork? Did they take their drug test? Did I send over their client paperwork to their new manager? While that’s going on, recruiters are telling me, HEY, I need 5 packets to go out overnight to these people who need to start next Monday. The phone is ringing. I still have to do Payroll for the 200 people who are currently working for us. The original Payroll Admin is sending out joke emails and videos with all the extra time on her hands since this is such “a learning experience for me”, “im doing such a great job in Payroll”. I love Payroll and I love my other job duties, it is just overwhelming. A recruiter got a promotion to lead recruiter and she is on a Power trip, only a couple of people here know how much work I do , but she tells me I need to do a project for a recruiter because it will take too much time out of his recruiting time. Im speechless because im busy enough as it is. She basically tells me in other words, “tough sh*t, its your project now. She even tells me our manager suggested it was a good idea. This recruiter doesn’t like to do new projects, he doesn’t really follow policy, he is holding on to his job by his past experience as an airplane mechanic which is what we recruit for. Im stuck as far as what to do.. What is unfair is, the so called reason I have to do this is because it is too time consuming for him to do, but all the other recruiter have to do it. It will take time out of his recruiting but is it not okay for time to be taken out of their recruiting? Why is this project being handed over to me? I do not want to do something that 1. I don’t have time for 2. Is not an admin’s responsibility 3. Is not fair to other recruiters that I do his work and everyone does their own. Do I confront my manager? What should I do? Im stuck, I don’t want to seem like im complaining to my manager and get in trouble but I also do not want to be taken advantage of. Please help

Now he wants to file a claim on PayPal and I don't have tracking... what should I do?  I really shipped it.  I am going to lose the claim and $50 plus the item itself and shipping, all lost.

My computer has crashed about two weeks ago, and then a week ago my credit card was stolen, so that has been canceled. Since my computer has crashed I had been purchasing my songs on my iTouch, but now that my credit card doesn't work I can't buy songs. So I had the brilliant idea of buying an iTunes gift card, redeeming it on my iTouch then purchasing my songs that way. But I can't do that either, it won't let me. So my problem is.. is there ANY way for me to put songs/apps on my iTouch any other way without having to sync to another computer and erase MOST of my songs (I used to use Limewire btw.) It is driving me crazy, I need new music :)      Also I have tried to gift the money I had put on to the account and use my older account, but still with the credit card problem it won't let me.      I'm pretty sure I'm S.O.L. but any help would be great, thanks :-)

At my mom's job she was to get a 3% raise on her one year anniversary.  They still have not given it to her.  I'm looking for the word that is listen on the paycheck as back pay for all the hours she worked with the 3% raise.  I thought it was garnished but I know its definately not that.       For example, say the raise finally shows up on her paycheck, there should be a box where she is paid the raise shes missed from her one year anniversary till now, even if its only $20 or so.
