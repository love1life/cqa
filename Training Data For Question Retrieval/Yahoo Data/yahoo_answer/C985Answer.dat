0583ad70e8336d13342bfa4c9e22025aaa	At all of the rowing clubs that I have trained at, the Concept2 rowing machines have always been the rowing machines of choice. And with good reason too as they are probably the best on the market.     (I'm not sure if you're in the UK/US/somewhere different altogether, but as I live in the UK, I have a lot more experience with the UK stuff, i.e. prices, the websites etc. but the US Concept2 site should feature pretty much all the same things!)    Although they are pretty pricey (a new machine will set you back between 800-1200, depending on the model) they offer a multitude of features, including optional accessories such as log cards which can be used to record data from your sessions, uploaded onto your computer for your reference or shared via the website (I know the UK site definitely has this) and used to compare with others on the online Leaderboard, which is really cool.    This page compares two of the latest models and suggests which of the two may be better suited for your individual needs:  http://www.concept2.com/us/indoorrowers/...    I hope this helps and that you do keep up rowing because it is such a great sport and a brilliant form of exercise :)    P.S: I don't work for Concept2, even if I did just give them a huge marketing boost, lol :)
G490hupxaa	Great question.  For the sake of comparison, I'll rule out team sports, so Duke/UNC and Red Sox/Yankees don't play in this.  Let's look back at some of the others:    Frazier/Ali - unbelievable fights, but they only fought 3 times.  Edge to Rafa/Fed    Sugar Ray/Thomas Hearns - I think this was actually better than Frazier/Ali, but still not as good as Rafa/Fed.    Sampras/Agassi - best All-American tennis rivalry.  But doesn't stack up to these two. Edge to Rafa/Fed.    Borg/McEnroe - As great as this was, they didn't have the number of classic encounters that Rafa and Fed have had.  No contest here.    Tiger and anyone - Well, since there is no competition for Tiger, that's easy.    Palmer/Nicklaus - I'm too young for this one, but just looking at the record, the drama wasn't there to compete.    Navratilova/Evert - I lived through this and never felt any electricity.  This was a great rivalry, but I'm not sure the level of competition outside these two was enough to compare to what Fed and Rafa have to endure to get to their showdowns.  Rafa/Fed get the nod here too.        OK, granted I haven't gone thru every possible rivalry, but in my eyes, none can compare.  These are the two best players in the world, and certainly two of the greatest of all time.  If it were not for Rafa, Fed would have SHATTERED Sampras' mark of 14 slams.  And at 22, who knows how far Rafa will go.  We could really see them in 3 more finals this year.  It is great for a sport that has seen better times and we are all very lucky to be able to watch.  So after all that, my answer is YES.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i have no idea of the other rivarlies in sports....    but from what i do know about tennis i know that the best rivarly was bewteen Martina Navrotolova and Chris Evert.. they probably played each other about 75 times in there careers....and it was said that was the longest lasting rivarly, nor would it be likely that there would be another rivarly like that..|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Yes It is...|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|D6Llh23Baa	yes. no other pair has met for so many times. and to think, almost every game they've had are epic matches. nice.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	There's nothing to name anymore. Fed/Nadal rivalry is greatest in the world of sports. Clearly, they're the two best players who has separated themselves by a great mile from their nonetheless good contemporaries; and arguably, they will occupy the 1 and 2 spots in the greatest ever category in tennis at the end of their careers. Furthermore, they're still writing their rivalry, and from what we are seeing now, it is getting even better and better|`|degfdvTGaa	Yup, i reckon it is...and the tennis they always manage to produce is breathtaking.|`|AA10911150	Potentially, yes. They've played a lot in important matches and the contrast in their playing styles and personalities makes it interesting too. But Federer is going to have to start winning a few for me to call it the best sports rivalry. Even though Sampras usually had Agassi's number in the Majors, their overall record was very close and it was always hard to say who was going to win when they played. So far, the Nadal Federer rivalry has been a tad more lop-sided, even to the point where there is a air of inevitability when Rafa wins. Not a good thing in such a high-profile rivalry.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	Coe V's Ovett, 1980 Olympics.|`|1w5blbobaa	Well certainly "YES".  I use 2 like Sampras vs Agassi rivalry b4,bt the way Nadal vs Federer competition going on I can say by far this is the MOST HEALTHY,MOST INTERESTING & MOST COMPETITIVE rivalry.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I can't think of a better rivalry, specially because of the respect, admiration and even affection those guys have for each other. They're both remarkable athletes *and* people, and it's a shame one of them has to lose for the other to win.|`|b70XH245aa	ya..man awsom..i also like djoko-nadal and djoko-federer|`|uuHrf7cGaa	Borg/McEnroe comes for their rivalry - unfortunately Borg retired at an early age of 26 - if not this would have gone very similar to what we see now. Magic/Bird(team rivalry) in NBA during the 80s. Ali/Frazier in 70s. Then on women side - the ever boring Chris Evert and Martina(I loved her game) rivalry.   But in terms of best - you got it right - it has been going on since 3 or even 4 years and quality is great and would continue as long as these two play top level tennis without retiring or getting injured.|`|ASNnhmR5aa	Not really.  Before this we have Sampras-Agassi rivalry   Amongst the women, I'd pick Evert-Navratilova as the best|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Yes.It is the best rivalry ever.Their matches against each other rarely misses the excitement.They are the most passionate and real entertainers in tennis history.|`|Elg7pnWiaa	If not the best (it's always difficult to say that in my opinion) it's definitely one of the best rivalries of all-time, mainly because they have faced each other 19 times and for sure we will see them facing one another many times in the future. And all of that 19 matches have been the most exciting in many many time. Wimbledon's final match last year was one of the best tennis matches that I can remember, I can't wait for this year's Roland Garros and Wimbledon!!!|`|z9TxQ262aa	It's up there but I believe that Borg vs McEnroe is even better!
DhEZj9cKaa	Base Layer (ie under armor, or something that will help wick away moisture from the skin)  Second Layer (a light to medium fleece)  Outer Layer (a coat or shell that is 100% waterproof)    If you know that it is going to be real real cold that day you may want to throw one more light to medium layer in there.  But as the day goes on and you get warmer you can shed the mid layers to help stay cool enough that you dont sweat a whole lot.  I hope you have fun I will be out there in a few weeks too.|`|t3rmVomeaa	When skiing at WP, remembere the inversion factor when you are getting dressed in the morning.  If you are staying down in Fraser or Granby, its gonna be much colder down there in the valley than on the mountain.  The cold air sinks into the valley and sits there until a storm or some wind comes and mixes it up.  It may be 0 degrees outside your condo, but 20 degrees at mid mountain.  This isnt always the case, but lots of times I see people wearing way too many layers and are constantly shedding throughout the day.    Check the mountains weather report before you head to the slopes for the day.  If the high is below 10-15 degrees F., Dress in as many layers as you can put on.  15-30:  Wicking base layers on both top and bottom, fleece mid layer on top, and wind/waterproof outer layers on top and bottom.  30+:  wicking base layers, skip the mid layer, and insulated outer layers, not too thick though, maybe a shell on top.  If it hit 40, I always just went with boxers, ski pants, and a fleece vest or hooded sweatshirt (only time I ever wear anything cotton on the slopes.)  Skis socks or a wicking type smartwool sock are almost mandatory.  They support your legs and are designed not to bunch up and cause pressure points inside your boots (which will make you miserable.)  Cotton socks trap and store moisture against your skin, and your feet get real cold real fast.      (I ski very aggressively and work up quite a sweat while doing it, you may want to add another layer or two depending on how hard you will be pushing yourself. If you get cold, go to the WP base, head to the Derailer for good food and drinks to warm up.  You cant miss it.)     I used to live there...any other questions, you can email me directly.
8skV9ze9aa	3B: M. Young  1B: C. Davis  DH. H. Blalock  C1: Salty (.275 AVG, 21 HR, 75 RBI, 60 R)  C2a: Teagarden (.267 AVG, 8 HR 33 RBI)    If Teagarden is traded, then he'll most likely start at wherever he plays. (.271 AVG, 18 HR, 70 RBI)    Rangers C2b: Max Ramirez (.283 AVG, 4 HR, 23 RBI)    The depth chart is pretty much set right now, and neither Teagarden nor Max Ramirez will get consistent playing time at DH. Teagarden will come in every once in a while to give Blalock a rest, or if Blalock slumps (so will Ramirez if Taylor is traded). Davis will probably be the Rangers best hitter after Hamilton by the end of '09 so I don't see him being taken out.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	If I were to make a guess, I would say Saltalamaccia will be the every day starter. There is a pretty good possibility that he could be traded. Teagarden will probably be the backup. There isn't much room in the Rangers infield with Young moving to 3rd. A rotation should be expected with Blalock, Davis, Salty and Teagarden at DH with whoever's left filling 1st and Catcher.    My stat projections for Saltalamacchia: .268 16 HR 68 RBI    Teagarden(if backup): .272 6 HR 25 RBI|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	i think salty will be the catcher

I'd like to drop down a bucket of balls in front of you and see it before I believe it.

Let's vote!|`|hec58R76aa	I hit my 5 wood 200 -220. I think you should get your yardages checked. tiger can't hit that far. But if you can and did, sign up for the long drive competition.

I hit my 60 degree wedge from 220 out...    I think its funny that on YA, everyone hits it further than Tiger Woods, and everyone is a sub 5 handicap.

Though There are a few exceptions to the last.  I find it entirely unbelieveable that any one hits a 5 wood farther than the Guys who are out there making their living hitting golf balls.
616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	In the end it didn't matter because the TD was overturned, but as far as I know it is still illegal to assist a player over the goal line. I remember the Fridge being penalized for this when he tried to carry Payton over the goal line in a game back in the day.    On the NCAA level there was recent controversy over this in an ND versus USC game.    NCAA: "no player of the team shall grasp, push, lift or charge into the runner to assist him in forward progress."    NFL:Article 5 No offensive player may:  ( a) lift a runner to his feet or pull him in any direction at any time; or;  ( b) use interlocking interference, by grasping a teammate or by using his hands or arms to encircle  the body of a teammate; or  ( c) trip an opponent; or  ( d) push or throw his body against a teammate to aid him in an attempt to obstruct an opponent  or to recover a loose ball.  Penalty: For assisting the runner or for interlocking interference: Loss of 10 yards.    If this penalty would have been enforced (which it seldom is because players push the pile often) it still would have been a chip shot FG.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I know what you are talking about.  It is illegal, but I don't think the officials ever take notice too much.  In 2005, Notre Dame could have beaten then number 1 USC, but Reggie Bush Pushed Matt Leinart into the end zone and USC won.  I always get mad when I see this go unpenalized.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	I don't know about this rule. But it happens all the time. Especially from the Steelers. If this is a rule, my guess is that you can help PUSH A PLAYER INTO THE END ZONE , BUT YOU CANNOT PICK HIM UP OR CARRY HIM IN.|`|jLOCqhckaa	I'm sure it was removed, because this is the first time I've actually ever thought about this. But if the rule was still there it would have been noted by at least one of the legions of sport writers or commentators.|`|JKIWCgbUaa	It is illegal to push, pull, or whatever to the ball carrier to advance him. however, it is legal to push on the pile or push or pull a different player that is next to, in front of, or behind him to advance him.  It is a penalty but Refs hardly make this call because it is something that they dont usually look for.  It is also hard to tell when this is going on sometimes. So yes, it is not heavily enforced.

WpqwaqcQaa	they make safety rounds or you can use bird shot, you have to think about who else is in your house and what happens if the shot goes thru the walls.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Use 2 3/4 inch 9 pellet buckshot....<br>  <br>  Yes I suppose 2 3/4 inch 1 ounce slugs would be a decent choice... If your good enough then it would seem they would be a better choice but I still avoid....... I happen to be a bit of an ace with slugs and surely would suggest you practice a lot with them but here is the down side.... Let say you get in a gun fight at a distance of say 100 to 150 feet.... With slugs you would have to aim dead on and that may not be easy of your excited.... Surely you still have to aim with buckshot - but if your not exactly on the money its a safe bet a few of the pellets will hit your target........|`|K5AeQuSNaa	If you are not in an apartment, go with 00 or #4 buckshot.  It will drop anything on 2 legs.  If you are in an apartment, or are worried about other people in the house, use #6, #7 or #7 1/2 birdshot.  Don't try to get cute with alternating slugs and buckshot.  You will invariably lose track of which one you are on in a stressful situation.  And while you still have to aim, using shot instead of a slug gives you a slightly larger margin of error.  If you think you will need slugs, take a few with you.  You can just drop them directly into an empty chamber when the time comes.  Practice doing that at the range, and you will quickly get the hang of it.<br>  <br>  As for soft armor.  No.  It won't go through it.  But a slug, or load of buckshot at close range will hurt them badly.  All of that kinetic energy doesn't just disappear.  It has to go somewhere, and the vest will only absorb so much.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Number 4 bird shot is lethal enough against an intruder when shooting inside your home.* Yes rifled slugs or sabots will penetrate body armour.* Any size Buck shot is not needed or necessary in order to terminate an intruder inside your home.* If you were outside the home like in a barn or outbuilding then you could safely use Buck shot.*|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	Why not mix & match? I've read of people loading a buckshot shell followed by a slug shell followed by a large shot (#4) shell or some similar combination. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.|`|tydulqH3aa	I think #4 would work best .<br>  When head shooting ,no need for armor.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	A. not made<br>  B. 00 buck works/has more power per pellet if you miss and it goes through a wall, somewhat dangerous in that case<br>  C. any normal type rifled slug: hits hard and almost guaranteed to punch through the person and possibly even a normal house wall as well with dangerous levels of power. Not the best choice<br>  D. Other- My recommendation is large birdshot or small buckshot #2-BB bird/#4 buck unless you expect to deal with heavily-clothed (think heavy coat/sweater/couple shirts) assailants then you might want to step up to #1, 0, 00, 000 buckshot. If you live in an apartment buy the heavy game loads(1 1/4oz, shot 3 1/4 dram equiv.)  with either #6 or 4 birdshot as they will be the least dangerous to residents beyond a wall then most anything else.<br>  <br>  Most soft body armor will stop any bird or buck shot load only the lightest grades will not stop a regular rifled or Brenneke slug. The threat level 2A and 3 stuff commonly used buy police will. The energy delivered beyond the vest has been claimed to be worse then a major league baseball player hitting you in the chest with a bat. Sabot slugs would likely go through but are rather expensive and need a rifled barrel or choke tube to properly stabilize them.|`|qLBU4t9Zaa	If it's just for self defense, you don't need buckshot or heavy slug.  Those are to kill deer-they are heavier and fewer pellets.  You'd probably be ok with getting birdshot-they're cheaper and will do damage still..there are more and lighter pellets.  Hopefully you don't have to use it though.  But even going out and getting into turkey shoots (you shoot targets) for competition is fun just to use your gun.|`|H50lXUwIaa	Buckshot is most effective.<br>  Slugs are more powerful but you have to aim more towards them.<br>  the size of buckshot depends though.<br>  Why use a shotgun? just a question.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	With that weapon, I would load it buckshot, slug, buckshot, slug, etc.  There is no reason to have to choose.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	At close range there is nothing better than a Shotgun, but fill the magazine tube with one 00 Buck, then a Slug, 00 Buck and so on, Stagger them.|`|eV6MHADQaa	0000 bird shot to small for humans need to be close for less spread<br>  00 good for people good short distance and long<br>  deer slug good for hunting works on people but have to aim|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I like number 1 buck shot there are more pellets then oo buck shot and still a lot of power|`|5qzndqYQaa	Use A and B.And shotguns can peirce through soft armor a close range.

UbDn94q9aa	Shawn hichael!!<br>  <br>  Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (born July 22, 1965), better known by his ring name Shawn Michaels, is an American professional wrestler. He performs for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), formerly the World Wrestling Federation, on its Raw brand. Hickenbottom is one of the senior performers in WWE, having joined in 1987.<br>  <br>  Hickenbottom began his wrestling career with Mid-South Wrestling, now known as Universal Wrestling Federation, and American Wrestling Association (AWA). During his time with AWA, he performed in partnership with Marty Jannetty, as The Midnight Rockers; winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice. Hickenbottom and Jannetty then signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF), while in contract with AWA. They returned to AWA, only to go back to the WWF in 1988.<br>  <br>  Hickenbottom later worked as a sole performer, taking on a new persona of "The Heartbreak Kid." He was the leader of a backstage group known as The Kliq, which was known for performing an unscripted act during the Madison Square Garden "Curtain Call" incident in 1996. The following year, he teamed up with Hunter Hearst Hemsley, who often was referred to as Triple H (HHH), and Chyna to form D-Generation X (DX). This group of wrestlers was known for their sophomoric crude humor. That same year, Hickenbottom took part in one of the most controversial matches in wrestling history, dubbed as the "Montreal Screwjob." After a back injury forced him to retire following his WWF Championship loss at WrestleMania XIV, Hickenbottom opened a wrestling academy, called The Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy, in which he trained upcoming wrestlers. He made his in-ring return at SummerSlam in 2002. In 2006, Hickenbottom and Triple H briefly reformed DX, but after an injury that Triple H sustained, Hickenbottom returned to singles wrestling.<br>  <br>  Overall, Hickenbottom has been a world champion four times, including three reigns as WWE Champion, and one reign as World Heavyweight Champion. He was also the winner of the 1995 and 1996 Royal Rumble and was the company's first Grand Slam Champion. Aside from professional wrestling, Hickenbottom is a born-again Christian, husband, and father of two children.|`|I14OzlGpaa	Michael Shaw Hickenbottem is the wreslter known as Shawn Michaels The Heart Break Kid.

J7ZZL1bCaa	After seeing Ireland playing the first half-hour of their game against Italy, I was very confident that Wales would thrash them. Their second-half performance however, sowed a seed of doubt.  Both Wales and Ireland have two potential banana-skins before then though,...England and France won't roll over to give us a shot at the Grand Slam. They should take it one game at a time.<br>  I'm still hopeful that Wales can make it  back to back Grand Slam wins though.|`|8SRjjYg4aa	Wales won last year, so to many they are favorites again this year. They have done great so far. Ireland is also a great team, and they are not doing to bad either. <br>  Ireland's defense does have some holes in it, and they could benefit from quick ball a bit more often, but i think that Ireland could win if they work at it.<br>  <br>  Either way, there are going to be some great matches.|`|nINl1ynhaa	I would like to see Wales win again the Six Nations. They've got a good coach and their first game against Scotland indicates to me that the team operates in a cohesive manner and are prepared to play an open running game.<br>  <br>  I have always been a fan of Wales, and their style of play is reminiscent of the great Welsh era when Gareth Edwards, JJ Williams, Gerald Davies, JPR Williams were playing.<br>  <br>  Iechyd da Cymru<br>  <br>  Kia Kaha<br>  All Blacks and Kiwi Fan|`|3164a41154ab9b11f8993b7fabfb4776aa	Neither.  France will beat wales next game, then wales will beat Ireland in the final game.<br>  <br>  That will put Wales, France and ireland joint top|`|62RKtkOhaa	I would say that Wales would have the best chance of it as they play Ireland at Cardiff in the final game. I still think France may put a dent in Welsh hopes tho.|`|AA11755427	both off to a good start but given that i am irish your odds would be short on me backing wales m8 lol.|`|BDsYZGTqaa	WALES!|`|ArfODtCCaa	mmmm wales|`|LloD26R9aa	Neither.<br>  I think it is too close at top for a gran slam winner. I think France will beat Wales and Ireland will lose to Wales.|`|lYTOUUtEaa	WALES   There are to many holes in the french and irish defence|`|1c3539edf849a557b8ad5254f359bc3eaa	it has to be wales all the way.they are playing well and aint even got out of second gear yet!!!|`|j1FCM0pqaa	ireland :D|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I think Ireland could manage it.|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	As an Irishman I think a grand slam will be won by either Wales or Ireland and that it will come don to the last match in Cardiff. Funnily enough, Ireland and Wales are two teams that aren't afraid to play away against each other, we have a good record in Cardiff, winning twice out of the last three times we played there. It will be difficult though.<br>  <br>  Talk of France turning over Wales is a bit wishful I think. In my opinion France are on a slow decline, not due to the quality of their players as they are still producing world class players but they're over worked. This week for example, some players will play on Sunday in the Top 14 and in FIVE days, they'll have to play a test match against probably the best side in the Northern Hemisphere at the moment. They'll be knackered.<br>  <br>  Here's where the Welsh and ourselves benefit as we maintain control over the majority of our players and they can recuperate and rest. With regards to the final result it'll be close but here's hoping for an Irish victory. :)|`|eSodtiniaa	Ireland are a team I really can't understand in that they have been so strong in the past few years but never seem to make it. Why? Something I just cannot explain. For the past few years I have thought surely it's Ireland's time but it never has been. Not being partisan but my country (Wales) are really looking good again this year but, whoever wins the Championship I don't the the Grandslam is on for anyone.|`|ETarSy9Maa	Wales.<br>  The only other contender is Ireland as stated.<br>  This mumbo jumbo about France even getting near Wales is ridiculous.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Both off to a great start but The Irish did have a good win over the French so far. I think the Irish will take it out.
sODHwf1Maa	You can't become a citizen of Norway just on the basis on the fact that you have some cousins here.<br>  <br>  To become a citizen of Norway you have to have lived here for 7 years, as well as probably some other things as well.<br>  <br>  Norway doesn't allow dual citizenship, so if you want one, you have to waiver your American one.|`|rGGymoowaa	That all depends on the citizenship requirements of Norway and usually in most counties it has to do with parents and grand parents. <br>  <br>   Chris Kaymen ,NBA player, was allowed to play Basketball for Germany in the Olympics based on the fact one of his grand parents was borne in Germany.

ll2y4YIGaa	no they are pro, so they dont have to pay for it. and i think that some of the players that are sponsered get payed to use certain equipment from certain brands|`|BrWVhd9naa	They dont their sponsors give it to them for free <br>  EX: crosby is sponsored by rbk so he gets their free gear|`|yTb3AlOvaa	I dont think they pay for their equipment, but they sort of do purchase it. I believe that they choose the equipment they like, lets say maybe a bauer stick and a pair of bauer skates. They tell the staff what type of equipment they want, and the staff purchase it for them. This is also why they have specalized sticks and stuff with their name on it.|`|jBXutMblaa	Really? No, they don't.  The teams have mass quantities of each players' equipment, i.e sticks, helmets, pads.|`|YJBkvhqxaa	No. Their  equipment is given to them for free from their sponsors.

ZKikquiOaa	Try finding a real and local archery store.  The first step is usually to find a local range, then talk to the other archers where a good store might be.  If you're in the US, go to www.usarchery.org they have a listing of ranges.  <br>  <br>  If there are no local stores or ranges, then try the following websites<br>  <br>  www.3riversarchery.com <- they have a wide variety of traditional equipment<br>  <br>  www.lancasterarchery.com more limited variety but they have a few<br>  www.fsdiscountarchery.com|`|lcg1u1U7aa	You should try a large sporting goods store they may have a few good recurved bows.|`|SkN2NqpGaa	There are many places to go to get a "traditional" bow:<br>  <a href="http://www.tradtecharchery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tradtecharchery.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.robertsonstykbow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.robertsonstykbow.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.horsebows.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsebows.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kustom-king.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kustom-king.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.eastern-archery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastern-archery.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.threeriversarchery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.threeriversarchery.com/</a><br>  <br>  As you can see -- if you have look at each of the above websites -- "traditional bow" does not mean just "recurve" or "longbow".... Prices do usually reflect the quality of the product, but there are always exceptions: I have seen many hand-made "custom" bows that were definitely not worth even 1/5 the price asked. On the other side, there are bowyers who will replace a bow if any part of the bow they sell you fails, even three years later, with no questions asked (now that's a guarantee!). Do yourself the favor of at least asking about a written warrantee/guarantee before laying down the money for that bow.<br>  <br>  The real difference between compound bows and the others, is those pulleys (cams) on the compound bows. All they do, really, is make it easier to hold the bow at full-draw -- they do not make the bow itself "more accurate", nor do they necessarily make the bow "more powerful"; "Power" is a function of bow design, and "accuracy" is a function of skill.<br>  <br>  I have a longbow, and enjoy using it. I have used various types of recurves (I started with one), as well, and have found that recurves and longbows are generally the same as far as "ease of use"...how easy a bow is to use depends on the bow's design. Example: My 50-lb draw longbow is just as difficult to use as a 65-lb horsebow I once tried -- the difference being the horsebow's design. In fact, I have had more trouble using compounds than any other type of bow, because of that "let-off" they have; that "hump" when the cams "break over" just doesn't feel right, and gets in the way of a smooth, even draw, even though a compound bow would let me stand around all day holding at full-draw.<br>  <br>  As "targetbutt" said, find an actual Archery Store -- NOT Cabela's, Gander Mountain, Bass Pro, Sportsman's Warehouse, or any of the other "Big Box" sporting-goods stores (they just want you to spend money, not help you find what you need) -- an actual Archery Store, where ARCHERY is the focus, not just one of at least six "departments"; they live archery, they breathe archery, and archery is their business. They do not sell rifles, footballs, weight-lifting equipment, out-board motors, or any of the other generic "sporting goods" stuff. The folks at a reputable Archery Store will help you find what you need for ARCHERY. (For the love of all that is holy, stay away from Wal-Mart! Going there for reliable archery equipment is like going to an auto-parts store for a camera...) IF you really have no choice but to go to one of those "Big Box" stores, do not allow yourself to be talked into getting something you don't want -- remember, they want to make a sale, not necessarily sell you what YOU need.<br>  <br>  Wherever you get your bow, make sure you try it out before you decide to buy it. A good archery store will have a shooting range you can use to "test drive" a bow. If the bow doesn't fit your hand, you will never be comfortable using that bow, no matter how long you have it; if you have to struggle to pull the string back, it's the same as the bow not fitting your hand. This is why I always say to not buy a bow from places such as E-bay until after you know what you want/need and know what you will like; with very few exceptions, there is no refund of your money once you have taken delivery of an "E-bay bow".|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Ebay has lots to choose from, new or used.* Save $$$ by getting one there, I did.* Bought a 58 inch 45Lb Re-curve Bow Hunter Model for $70.00..* It normally would cost $300.00 Dollars.*|`|TvARYVRJaa	e bay recurves|`|BJ4O0acoaa	<a href="http://www.greatplainsbow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatplainsbow.com/</a>|`|qLBU4t9Zaa	Just go into any sportsman store, the one's I go to they usually have them in the back or just with the other bows.<br>  <br>  And I know the compounds look really complicated, but they aren't so bad.  When you figure out what does what it's simple actually.  The sportsman workers should even be able to help you out.  Longbows are just a lot harder to work with.<br>  <br>  Oh and, if you still want the "traditional" bow-I'd suggest a recurve rather than a long bow.|`|wGftCjJUaa	watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1jc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1...</a>

U5KOQt0Taa	I doubt Cleveland fans would stay true to their team, they just like them because they have one of da best NBA players in the league today. <br>  <br>  If he did i say the Knicks.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Probaly most clevlend fans are fakers.<br>  <br>  Edit: he isnt "king" james he is lebron james i hate how everyone calls him "king" why didnt they call kobe king when he put 61 or 81?<br>  <br>  lebron never put 61 or 81.|`|rvl2f6ERaa	new york knicks 2010|`|PSBHeDGMaa	he wont go. but if he did some would follow ( outsiders from diffrent states/countries) and some would stay true (ppl from clevland)|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	they wont change team just for lebron im sure when lebron is playing they will root for him but not change teams|`|5FypDafWaa	They will stay tue and he will sign with the hawks|`|khbLZQHIaa	Some fans will stay, others will leave.  It depends.<br>  <br>  I'm staying with the Cavs no matter what.  I'm a Cleveland native and would never leave my hometown.  I know some Cav's fans on this site freely admit they're LeBron fans, not Cavs fans and will follow LeBron.<br>  However, people like Cavs in '09, tvman, me and a few others stick with our hometown.<br>  <br>  He won't leave though.  So I'm not going to pick a team.<br>  I lie.  It would be the Knicks if he DID leave. (But he won't...)|`|csKyqot0aa	If he leaves then I think he would maybe go to the Hornets.

As for the other Cavs fans, I would say half of them would stay true, and half of them would now be a fan of LeBron's new team.<br>  <br>  If he leaves, I think he would sign with Phoenix, or New York. Maybe ever Miami, or Houston.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	I think some would go wherever LeBron goes...because those are the fans of LeBron...<br>  the truest fans would stay with Cleveland. <br>  <br>  <br>  I dont know where he will sign, I think he will stay with Cleveland|`|1ieKW07Naa	They'll stay true and he will sign with the Grizzlies.|`|mwxKnUleaa	It depends what on the type of fan, but I think some will just follow Lebron wherever he goes
mwxKnUleaa	I don't know, but I would love to see Vince Carter in a dunk contest one more time before he retires|`|t1uKdzmLaa	At first, I would agree and say that he should participate in the dunk contest.<br>  <br>  Now when I think about it more; it would be better for him not to participate because it could potentially ruin his legacy as one of the best dunkers of all-time in the NBA. Therefore, in order to maintain his current legacy...it might be a better idea for him not to take part in a dunk contest in the future. <br>  <br>  If he still had those awesome dunking skills though...then why not. Otherwise, keep your legacy Vince, haha.|`|EJAhiT1Gaa	No, hes too old to be doing all the crazy dunks that lets say nate robinson and lebron james( hopefully next year will be in) do! <br>  but good question! (:|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No, because he'll be retiring in the next few years.|`|5FypDafWaa	Yes|`|PwUTG6lEaa	no because vince cant dunk anymore and he is to old|`|csKyqot0aa	He probably won't be.

VbvrG9NJaa	Okay well I was like the same way, like I had been asked to move up to firecracker when I was in 2nd grade but then i stopped and moved down again, so then I worked once a week for 2 more years, where they asked me again if I wanted to move up and I said yes and I stuck with it and I made it to level 6.<br>  But the thing you need to do is maybe ask your coach if your good enough, like some of the skills you need are <br>  -lower kip<br>  -roundoff backhandspring <br>  -squat on <br>  -cartwheel<br>  -front hip circle<br>  -back hip circle<br>  -fronthandspring on vault<br>  -fronthandspring<br>  -dive roll<br>  -backhandspring<br>  -back hip circle on high bar<br>  -half turn on beam<br>  -handstand on beam<br>  And thats just some of the things that you need to be in level 5, but if you really want to move up then I would just ask your coach if your good enought to move up and if they say no then ask them what you need to do to move up.|`|3rdvbfDZaa	At my gym you have to be asked to be evaluated. They set up a time for your evaluation and if you have potential to do good in the next level then they will move you up. Or, if you don't ask to be evaluated but they think you are really good and want you at the next level, they might ask if you would like to move up. Once you get to team, you don't do evaluations anymore, they just tell you at the end of the competition season if you will move up a level or stay at the same level for the next competition season.|`|uKyfRzxIaa	If you compete with USA gym, then you have to qualify to move up. Say you're on level six. Some gyms have you work on level 7 after qualifying and see if you learn stuff fast. Others, like myn, just let you move up once you qualified. You can also request to move down.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	You could ask them when they think it's time for you to move up. They will think about it and possibly move you up

nRBC4E5saa	You don't know if Alistair Overeem is black?  Um... yes, he is.<br>  <br>  His brother Valentijn has also got some good submission skills.<br>  <br>  And you're probably too new to MMA to remember Carlos Newton.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with them being black, obviously, since there are some good black submission specialists.  It has to do with what they train.  Thomas is a BJJ guy, Newton is too.  The Overeems have, I think, more of a shootfighting submission background, although they're primarily kickboxers.  But let's look at other black fighters.<br>  <br>  Evans: comes from a boxing and wrestling background.  There are no deliberate submission in those two systems.  He's new to the submission game, so I imagine he isn't confident enough to use his subs yet.  And why should he have to?  Hitting people and taking them down are working out great for him so far.  Tito Ortiz, a fighter in a similar mold, never really showed any submission skills until the Machida fight.  Up until that fight, nobody who watched his previous fights could even tell you if he knew what a triangle choke was, much less how to apply it.<br>  <br>  Rampage: boxing and wrestling, like Evans.<br>  <br>  Jon Jones: Greco-Roman and Muay Thai background.  No subs.<br>  <br>  Cheik Kongo: kickboxer with some OK takedowns.<br>  <br>  Paul Daley: Kickboxer with some OK takedowns.<br>  <br>  Melvin Guillard: wrestling and boxing.<br>  <br>  It's all about what they train.  Some guys are better at some things than others.  I could go, "Why does Forrest Griffin's wrestling suck?" or "How come Matt Hughes can't punch his way out of a paper bag?" and the answer would be the same.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Check out Kimbo Slice's cousin Rhadi break this guy's arm in an armbar. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1on6UkhuM0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1on6Ukhu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I'd guess it might have something to do with the popularity of team sports and striking sports over grappling and some natural athletic advantages of black people like thicker skulls, larger nostrils and lungs to process more oxygen, longer limbs, and different muscular points-of-insertion.  Since team sports and boxing pay so much money, are so popular, and so available to train in, the most athletic people gravitate to them more so than grappling sports.<br>  <br>  Eastern Europeans are that way too.  They're just put together like iron wrapped in raw hide.|`|57xYln1Haa	I think it is because they are not as flexible and focus more on the power stand up game rather than grappling. It also might be that when they get in a fight they dont have the patience to try to work someone into a submission since it takes a little while to preform. It is kinda weird tho i mean when was the last time you saw a black wrestler?|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Ever heard of Anderson Silva?|`|LFLflsWFaa	Troll.|`|c73AAq22aa	will they rather knock you out lets say that

If he had returned to Smackdown or Raw he would have been buried in the middle of the show somewhere.<br>  Next week he gets a title shot for the ECW title. He wasn't getting a title shot on Smackdown.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	yes as if you were suppossed to be put on SD and have a big feud with Jeff Hardy at Wrestlemania and then be put on ECW i would say he would be very annoyed|`|OHBvEYKHaa	YES i would|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Honestly I think Christian is thinking smart, He knows that if he wants to be big, he wants to be the first one to do it, like going to TNA, now he actually made a name for him self there, and coming back to the WWE, and onto ECW, he knows that doing it big there will send him even higher. He knows everyone wants to go mainstream, but he wants to do it too but in ways that nobody else thought of. Most people know Christian as Edge's on-screen former tag-team partner and champion. So for Christian that's a good thing and that makes him, "AN INSTANT CLASSIC"|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	At the moment, my friend, yeah. But, over time, I would get over it. Eventually, I would end up on either Raw and Smackdown.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PLyhhDFNaa	ecw would be easier for him to win the title as most of the people there are up and comers not established like on smackdown and raw|`|8h5dqzf6aa	no because ecw will give him more pushes such as main events and the ecw title.And he has been in the main event since he returned and if he was on raw or smackdown he wouldn't even wrestle|`|W0rRfLU0aa	so long as it only lasted a couple months ya know time enough for the fans to remember that i am better than world champ edge|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I heard he actually asked to be on ECW..I'm not completely sure, I read it somewhere.|`|GMcdPLoIaa	He knew where he was going and I'm sure he's making more there than he was in TNA and/or the Indy Circuit.

Before embarking on his professional wrestling career, he was an officer in the Punjab state police;[8] he was also a labourer.[9]<br>  <br>  In WWE, Singh is a one-time World Heavyweight Champion (his first championship throughout his wrestling career), and has appeared in the films The Longest Yard[1] (2005) and Get Smart (2008).[8]|`|I14OzlGpaa	The Great Khali is wrestler from India.  He is very talented.  He doesn't speak English on camera and in real life speaks very little English.<br>  <br>  He is also a lot more flexible than the WWE portrays him to be.|`|hApu3H5Jaa	He is a decent entertainer, only through his manager though, and a crappy wrestler. He really has only 3 or 4 moves that he uses.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	khali is a face indian wrestler on the smackdown brand|`|pa4iC5Nkaa	I think he is good.  He is like 7' 3".  I wish he was still on raw though!!!|`|z5rlyGXNaa	he is big from india he is good he has a lot of good moves|`|rphR4pXKaa	Not really cause HHH pedigreed himand won the match and he's like over 7' so not really....But he a big M****** F**** though!|`|YrHuv1g3aa	No, hes rubbish and slow|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, the Great Khail (real name Rana Dalip Singh) is wrestler, actor and former powerlifter from India. He is currently in the Smackdown division of the WWE.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Wrestling fan|`|hL3eS2zKaa	He is an Indian wrestler. He is very strong and he's like 7 feet tall, weighing at 420 lbs.<br>  He is strong, and has a strength advantage, but he has very limited wrestling skills. I personally think, without his strength, he wouldnt be a very good wrestler.|`|SsodRf4kaa	He is the master of the Kiss Cam and if you are a girl then you must love him.|`|H09OAJxSaa	he sucks to me!he is just really tall thats from india thats all you need to know!
fS8joiTaaa	my friends 5 10 and he cruises around with me all the time and im 5 6 so im sure you should be fine. Just stand up and ride like your supposed to.

22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	you probably have to know someone in the WWE|`|MsbNcMZbaa	Yup. You're going to need a hook-up either with someone in the WWE or at the venue the show is being held at.
BRX96ZUnaa	I think it was a decent trade. Rafer was a good shooter and could handle the ball well. But he shot below about 36% from the field this season and was struggling. He was not a good distributer and couldn't give the ball much/make plays for the Rocket's big 3. So they are going a different direction with Aaron Brooks and hoping that he could be someone who can give the ball to the big 3. But we will not see that this season since T-Mac is gone.|`|Y32OY6PAaa	yeah|`|mwxKnUleaa	I think they will end up getting solid contributions from the players they got back|`|rvl2f6ERaa	no because they got rid of their pg, but he was struggling and the rockets did what they had to do, thats business

yRPYuJhsaa	I've had The Bambino for close to 2 years now and it's still flying like it was on the first day. I strongly suggest it unless you're more into longer boards.

I thought mytv was a network station.  It is with the regular stations here.|`|VQ7t2jOmaa	why is wwe not a normal company|`|qR99SYPXaa	the should go back to the cw or go to the USA network. i agree wit u
Y4mz8BShaa	Is it an ARES?<br>  <br>  You're looking at a great piece of metal.
BgKueDyMaa	If it came down to having to trade one.. You would wana trade shaq, He is getting old as. But keep it as it is !|`|a7AatQcEaa	For now keep everyone. However in the long run how long is Shaq going to last trade for a younger guy eventually or a draft pick.|`|ZSB8yqNlaa	i would trade shaq|`|9UhoUcM2aa	its STOUDEMIRE.. <br>  and out of all those I wouldn't trade any. I like their team how it is|`|dDhTMacAaa	Shaquille O'Neal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Amare is 26 and very, very good...and Steve Nash is absolutely loved by that franchise and it's fans. Trading him would be a PR "blowup."|`|urqGJPwpaa	I'm sure now, they would rather get rid of Amare.  He is hurt.  Can't help your team when you're hurt.
BNqbOfBsaa	besides running you need to lift weights. Do Squats with some weights. remember to keep your back straight and look straight at all times. <br>  <br>      lunges are also good. Your own body weight should give you a good challenge. just remember to alternate legs. <br>  <br>    explosive plyometetric exercises are also good. like trying to jump as high as possible... on top of something like a step or something.|`|uIN5RjJVaa	Hello! Ok, so first you have to achieve something more than 100 meters, so 100s don't seem like a big pain to your body; like 150's. Then you have a drill that goes like... sprinting a 50 meters,jog back (recovery), sprint a 150 meters, (jog back)- that's one set. Then, do that three times. It will really boost your speed in a couple weeks. Now remember, things take time! So don't be upset if you're very tired and sore the first week, it WILL get better. <br>  ~ You also have to try to work all part of your body when you run. Work on the form. So like lifting weights, a long run, fast and quick sprint drills. That will make you a lot faster. Try core exercises also. <br>    ~ All of these exercises will make you a stronger and faster runner. But I'll repeat myself and say: So don't be upset if you get tired or whatever the case. You can do it. Don't be discouraged! if you are really serious about track, then you have to commit. :)

I9HpfwGLaa	yea they got Kevin Curtis whos going to be really good. hes young and finally getting an opporutnity in phily. also phily's got reggie brown whos already proved himself and is getting better. i doubt theyll use a first round pick on that, they are more conservative and dont go all out on big players early in a draft. anyway there draft pick is way too late to get a good wr, so they might just go with a guard, tackle or d-end cuz the players at their position are getting old.|`|8EcqER8Vaa	u feal uneasy because mcnabb is gunna hav him for 1 year like stalworth and T.O but its a good edition and a miracle cuz philly did sumthin in free agency they should draft pat willis though|`|dbd321fb08640ea557f8ffb4b79535efaa	I thought Stallworth was the better of the two but I guess not for the money he ended up getting paid by New England.|`|a87e63e84d30d91092c2d7a318770320aa	they have jeremy bloom! lol hes a fast white dude

5981536910b10187bd7f11cb716c6f18aa	the best thing about a good shooter is a bad short term memory<br>  <br>  they call it a shooting mentality, you shouldn't remember what you did your last shot only think about your next one<br>  <br>  clear your mind or atleast think about something else<br>  <br>  let your body take over and stop thinking about it<br>  <br>  need to stay relaxed and focus or you will remain a streak shooter<br>  <br>  remember that you also need to practice practice practice|`|AA11828783	don't know if this will help, but I used to tell shooters i coach this:<br>  <br>  If you make 3 in a row, you will probably make the next one cuz you are hot.<br>  If you miss 3 in a row, you will probably make the next one cuz you are due.<br>  The point is... always think the next one is going<br>  I got this quote from an NBA player named World B. Free (he changed his name from Lloyd). streaky shooter, but great scorer for the Cavs in the 80's.|`|f36cace489da324aaf029b35b824ae99aa	It sounds corny, but it's your confidence. You have made yourself believe that the only way you can make a shot is if you made the previous one, and the only way you'll miss a shot is if you miss the previous one. Make sure that you believe you can make every shot. It will take time, but you'll work out of your groove. Try to remember what you did right when your shot went in, and, whenever you are in a bad groove, take a simple shot to get back into a hot streak.
cbf3a108a986334e802773d299b19075aa	while your running breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, it helps to regulate breathing.|`|6041c891e3a830b0fdce1bd23376198baa	When running, breathe in a pattern. In your head, say 1...2... 1...2... For weight, just try to be skinny, but also muscular. Not just your legs, also your arms. Another tip, when I get tired, when I hit the ground, I hit it with the middle of my heel first. Then I "roll" my foot, one way to know you're doing it is your feet hitting the ground shouldn't make as loud of a sound.|`|82213b59057374301ca35f173c30bab6aa	All i can say is try this:<br>  <br>  choose a foot to begin your breathing pattern. then start out walking and when u start breathe in on that foot then after 2 steps later breathe out. don't breathe in again for another 2 steps after that. just try walkin for a while then if u get the hang of it try joging then if that works then u can start running it and the will help u alot i promise!|`|AA11587164	First have a weight of 130-140 lbs.

4fDTL7eaaa	I am not sure if he is even human. I cant stand the fact that people are so cruel to animals. I wish he was getting more of a punishment -but in this world, illegal gambling and betting is more important than the pain and suffering of animals so maybe they will give him a good long vacation in prison for that at least.  <br>    He should be banned from the NFL for the animal cruelty as well as the other offenses.|`|d2a490a97e6d421761d881a9a9752da4aa	This idiot Vick was losing his career anyways.  He had a career QB rating of 75, barely completed half of his passes.  Grossly overrated|`|RFKy3A8Xaa	I'm glad it happened. As a pitbull owner these dogs are being banned all over because of loosers like Vick who use them for entertainment and people wonder why they kill and maime when they are loosed on to the streets. The media jumps on anything to do with a pitbull.  Instead of  being portrayed as the loyal, loving animals that they are. <br>   He's a lying coward who deserves the maximum punishment.|`|AA11986659	People who abuse animals...will probably,if they have not already,abuse humans,or children.Do I enjoy watching his meltdown?No,I see a wasted life for the sake of some sick gambling thing.He's an *** !! Oh,and by the way...where's Al Sharpton now???|`|Ah0R2INDaa	I'm the one giving everybody thumbs down! <br>  For one <br>  Vick is an increditable talent, and now bandwagon riders are saying he is overrated as a player! <br>  <br>  Secondly yall protesters and haters act like Vick started this dog fighting culture, which is centuries old.<br>  <br>  Thirdly People have always used animals for there enjoyment, and to make money (Circus and Racing)<br>  <br>  If the horse didn't have to race, would it have broke a leg and be put to sleep. Could that be from over training the horse?<br>  <br>  Does PETA protest the circus? Animals were not ment to be stored in 6x8 cages, or train cars!<br>  <br>  How many zoo animals look as healthy as they do in there natural habitat. Where is PETA?<br>  <br>  Lastly there are far more worse things going on in our country and our world. If yall took more time attending to those issues instead on this one man fighting dogs, this world would be a better, cleaner place!<br>  <br>  Bob Barker tell u to nooter and spade your dog and cat.  So now your taking away the basic rite God intended for all animals including man.|`|zVyWLaU9aa	I just want to know where all the "Innocent until proven guilty" people who've been all up on Vick's jock are now LOL.  I knew he was guilty from the very beginning, anybody who has a brain knew he was guilty.  I'm going to love every second of knowing that he is behind bars bunking with some 300 pound in-mate named Bubba.  Sleep tight Mike... sleep tight :)|`|0E81ZHxIaa	shooting dogs, drowning dogs. starving dogs, killing dogs. this man is sick and should not be around anything living, he has no values and no value for life. probably some day he will harm a human life .once you start degrading life, it could be anyone         I don't care about his career that's, that's Over. he will be reminded about this cruelty all his Life, I guess they don't pay well in the NFL , if he has to abuse dogs for a living|`|9JvGHSliaa	Did Vick enjoy watching 100's of dogs being starved, tortured, beaten, fought, drowned, hung, shot, and electrocuted? <br>  <br>  Considering he has been involved in these things for the last 5 years (that we know of) I would have to say YES<br>  <br>  Yes, I am glad he is being punished, I am glad that because he IS famous, it has brought this horrible bloodsport to the forefront, and people are now aware of all the dirty sadistic details that are associated with dogfighting and training dogs for fighting. <br>  <br>  But BECAUSE I am humane, I can't say I am 'enjoying' seeing Michael Vick go down. I would have enjoyed MORE seeing him improve as a QB this year with the Falcons, and dedicating the amount of time and money he gave to dogfighting, instead, to something worthwhile, as Warrick Dunn does with his time and money. Take a look at Michael Vick in Wikepedia, look at his charity work. The MAIN mention here is his VICK foundation, but if you go to the webpage www.vickfoundation.org, you will see that this organization is defunct, and has been for a while. The website just shows the logo, with no links, no information about the charity, just a typical dummy corp. He donated a paltry $10,000 to the United Way after the horrible shooting at the college in VA.Other charity events he has touted he would be involved in, were cancelled before they were actually carried out. More evidence to give us all a glimpse into the twisted, selfish nature of what it means to be 'Michael Vick'.<br>  <br>  It is all sad, but the real victims in this are the 100's of dogs who suffered unmercifully for the entire span of their short lives, struggling to gain 'approval' from their owner, who repaid them by hanging and drowning.|`|AA11301892	I'd feel really bad if I were the Falcons--They have to put up with Joey Harrington for this year--that's like trading in a decked-out Silverado for a used bare-bones Dakota.|`|GPKB42HZaa	Why yes I am.  I also think a few others should be banned for life also for their crimes.   Money talks with Pro Players.  And that stinks.|`|MaksATcKaa	Its not something enjoying....Its like watching grass grow....|`|QLnZ6OPxaa	Yes and no...i love to see a criminal get punsihed for a horrible crime but i hate to see a very good player leave the leauge|`|WG6nxrHxaa	I am lovin every second of it. its not like the NFL is losing anything valuable or talented. anyways animal creulty is dispiciple|`|ca5ff883a5cf30d4efe2e313e739d021aa	I enjoy watching him lose his career.  He deserves it because he is a bad man, and he committed a horrible crime.  Any normal person would go to jail, so Vick should as well.|`|pNN7YnKSaa	It's horrible.  He is a great NFL player, and I hate that he did what he did, and that he is going through this.  The NFL won't be the same without this great player.

AA11216016	hey i hate shaq to (at least on the basketball court) and i agree with you that the man has no talent, but i still respect his strength and ability to get all these dunks.... but i agree with you in the sense that just because he is 57% doesnt mean he has made even HALF of his jumpshots|`|1428712b5c8c4d04fa9d7f70a2bccd25aa	I never really thought about it but you are SO right.  Why is it that they never call hanging on the rim anymore?  Sometimes they bend it nearly to the floor.  I think dunking has gotten way out of hand.  Any thug can do it.  I agree that it is NOT shooting.  That's where the finesse is!  The media loves Shaq.  I do not.|`|7497f7be7e0fda7dd55a633c697f0d23aa	Hey Snidely...<br>  <br>  You dunk the ball! <br>  <br>  BTW I bet even though Shaq probably can't hit a 12-footer, plenty of big dunkers (Amare Stoudemire, Primoz Brezec, etc...) can|`|n7JmcsZNaa	That's how Shaq shoots. And a basketball through the hoop still equals 2 points if it is inside the 3 point arc, does it not? I don't care if a guy puts the ball between his buttcheeks and blows it through the hoop with a fart- if he scores (and by god, shaq can score) then it's fine with me. <br>  <br>  Basically, if he's scoring consistently it is worth tracking, regardless of how he's doing it. Let the coaches who have to craft a defense to stop him worry about HOW he's getting his.|`|Pa21rv5naa	Yep i think ur crazy. That doesn't bother me.|`|ac11c0ffc13fccd33a2486df7c7cd3b3aa	I am not a Shaq fan myself, but dunking is not easy at that level or any level for that matter. What you obviously fail to realize that dunks cannot and should not be taken out of the FG category because people MISS DUNKS and it still COUNTS FOR TWO POINTS!!! You seem to have forgotten those things.<br>  <br>  I agree with your assessment that many big men have not developed a game worthy of mention outside of the key, but there are some that have and that particular element of their game is what makes them great!!! The fact that they can shoot is what seperates them. Just so you know, great players are oftentimes established by the skills that they have......in relation to skills that others do not. You are implicitly suggesting that all players should have the same skills. That cannot be further from the truth. If everybody had the same skill and played the game the same, there would be no reason to make trades, everbody could be an all star, MVP and every team would be a championship contender. That would be monotonous and there would be no point in televising the games or selling tickets. I agree with your notion that at times the dunk is given too much attention but you just took it in left field somewhere with the assertion that it should not be figured in statistically. I think there should be a new figure in the win-loss columns for Duke or any other team that played Duke at any point during the season. Considering the blatant bias in officiating, how many teams have losses this season or have had losses in the past at the hands of the officials bailing them (Duke) out, ignoring their infractions or flat out cheating? <br>  <br>  Dude, you just sound angry. And I have to say I am a little concerned about the language that you and Snidely used when referencing the players: You called them 'over-grown guerillas' and Snidely called them 'thugs'. 'Guerillas'? Do I really need to tell you how that sounds? "Any thug can dunk"? Excuse my frankness, but that is just @#$*in' stupid. 'Thug'? I think the choice of adjectives that both of you used has a lot more to do with who's in the NBA and may be representative of some of your ideas about a particular demographic, than what actually goes on in the NBA (hint hint)!!! You both need to check yourselves for bias and you know what I mean.|`|cdQryr7paa	So, what are you saying? there should be a seperate stat for dunking?<br>  A dunk counts 2 points just like a 15 foot jump shot does.<br>  I suppose we should make a dunk only worth 1 point then since they are so easy to get, right?<br>  With the quality of athletes in the NBA, with their sheer athetisism, size and skill, I doubt either one of us would be able to get a dunk in the NBA.<br>  It's a testimony to not only Shaq, but other big men in the league that they are able to excel close to the basket when there are so many tall athletes trying to stop them.<br>  Stop hatin man, a dunk is a shot, it's just a high percentage one.<br>  Not much you can do about that.|`|AA11828783	Do you actually believe that dunking on a 7 foot guy is EASIER than making an open 15 foot jumper? That is ridiculous. It is easy to say "well, he is just big", but you really don't understand how athletic Shaq is, especially in his prime, or how much work it takes to get position in the paint and use your body. Catching the ball within three feet of the basket is extremely difficult. If you don't believe me, then go find an athletic basketball player over 6-10 and see if you can catch a pass that close. I have done it man, and I promise you, it takes a LOT of work! That is a skill which one has to practice, just like dribbling or passing or anything else. Shaq has obvious advantages, but some of those advantages have come through a lot of practice, and anybody that thinks he doesn't have talent or skill just doesn't know basketball.

a155zHkBaa	Sounds like your area of need then is RB or TE.   At RB, the next best choice would be Chris Henry at TENN.  Updates on various football sites state that he has very good shot at starting this year or at least splitting carries. Your next options could be one of these 3 guys at RB.  Lorenzo Booker at MIA, Kenny Irons at CIN, or Garrett Wolfe at CHI. All 3 guys are quick 3rd down type backs who may seen some action early in their career. If one of regulars goes down with the injury, they could step in right away.<br>  <br>  At TE, the only 2 worth grabbing are Greg Olson at CHI or Zach Miller at OAK.|`|038ac0681c8e17898898f77cb24637e0aa	I am assuming that you are looking for either a rb or a te right?<br>  <br>  Well for rb the rookie option you have left would be Kenny Irons in Ten.  His only competition is Lendale White and last thing I heard on him was that Lendale was 20 lbs overweight.<br>  <br>  As far as Te go you have a couple options.  Obviously Greg olson in Chi would be a good get.<br>  <br>  There is also Zack Miller who was Drafted by Oak.  He is not as explosive as Olson but he is a very solid player.<br>  <br>  If you want to take best available then you have to take Olson.  But if you need a rb then take Irons. Hope this helps!|`|21wb5N6Kaa	Take Dwayne Jarrett. He will be a stud for years to come being on the opposite side of the field as Steve Smith. Carolina released Keyshawn after drafting him so they must have big plans for him!|`|AA12179647	This may sound odd but I would take Chris Henry RB out of Tennessee. I have been watching some of his practices and I think he could be the next Eddie George.|`|AA10240466	That's an easy one for me.  Everyone seems to think going for the TE position makes sense right now.  No.  Take that second WR first.  I would take Robert Meachem next.  He went a little under-the-radar by the time draft day came around, but he was causing a lot of interest during the combines.  Take him next, then could choose TE at # 7.  Remember, TE's no matter how great they might be, will NEVER bring as much value to your team as a strong receiver.  By the way, while everyone is clammering for Greg Olson and Zach Miller, you might want to check out Michael Allen out of Wentworth.  He could end up being a real steal down the line for you.  Do your research.|`|useLnAqtaa	Take TE Olsen for Chi.<br>  <br>  If there isn't a solid option at RB or TE that you like - Take another QB.  Never know, might be a good insurance policy to trade later.<br>  <br>  You'll have Russell and Quinn to pick from.  There is also Ted Ginn Jr at WR

344dbebf643386d6cad63f28f9857b88aa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo tan sólo a medias en tus afirmaciones.Por supuesto que Amancio Amaro "el Gallego Brujo",fué un jugador excelente.Era rápido y tenía uno de los mejores regates que he visto en mi vida.Aún guardo en mi retina un encuentro copero frente al Betis,en dónde encaró a un defensa,le amagó varias veces,con el balón pisado,primero para un lado,luego para el otro,se arrancó por un lado,el defensa se fué para allá,y Amancio se fué para el otro,con el resultado de que el defensa ya no pudo cerrarle el paso y se quedó literalmente tirado en el suelo.Pero si hablamos de regateadores excelentes,el mejor de todos los que ví,sin ninguna duda fué el francés Kopa...?qué elegancia jugando al fútbol y que finura!...parecía que tenía un guante de seda en los pies,y como hacía de fácil los regates y quiebros más difíciles.Pero con respecto a la pregunta,si hablamos de lo que es puramente "el mejor",ése no fué otro que don Alfredo di Stéfano.Cuando llegó al Madrid cambió el sistema del equipo por completo,jugando como un ariete puro,lo cual era muy poco usual en el fútbol espa?ol de la época.Esto causó verdaderos estragos en los equipos rivales,poco acostumbrados a la figura de un delantero centro "puro",y quizá,fué la clave de los éxitos que el Madrid cosechó por todo el mundo durante todos aquellos a?os.Pero di Stéfano no era solamente un delantero:era un auténtico "Land Rover",pues bajaba a la defensa a ayudar cuando era necesario,recuperaba balones en el centro del campo y montaba los contraataques y organizaba el juego del equipo,amén de conseguir goles en su verdadero puesto de delantero.Era el auténtico amo y se?or del equipo y un verdadero líder.Era el jugador más completo y polivalente que ha habido y tan sólo le faltó jugar de portero.Sin ninguna duda,ha sido no solamente el mejor jugador en la historia del Madrid,sino en la historia del fútbol mundial.<br>  <br>                  ?Un saludo!|`|1a1d63b050745400846bd3903bef99d4aa	Di Stefano y Zidane. <br>  <br>  Estos son los mejores jugadores de la historia del Real Madrid.

qaayrLBoaa	I've always hated Cena, and I always will. I was cheering for Edge during that feud. 90% of Cena fans go on looks and the storyline alone. Personally, I like to choose based on skills, and the dedication to wrestling. Sadly, since most people don't go by that, great talents such as Funaki, Elijah Burke, and Trevor Murdock will never be big names in the WWE.|`|0a389a531d55df75efb2f3d60a30ea95aa	no actully its not funny and what im about to say is not up there im gonna say THAT IVE BEEN A FAN SINCE HE DID DEBUT I NEVER HATED HIM WHEN HE MADE FUN OF THE FANS I NEVER SAID I HATE HIM|`|15XxFt0naa	lol Most Cena fans werent even born when Cena debuted LMFAO|`|cb519698c04d943276cb72431ab33dfcaa	Actually i didn't watch wrestling when he debuited so i really don't care.|`|AA12111181	i have always loved john i dont care what anyone says always and forever ohh and REPORTED!!!~!!!|`|H0TjTgJkaa	cena was more likeable before he was the champ as someone before me said.<br>  he used  to have a cool image and do this fun rap stuff.<br>  now he has to  be a kid's and chicks hero. don't hate  the player, hate the game, in this case marketing.|`|TKUDYE0paa	you hattin on cena because hes sexy he got the body he know how to wrestle and hes the champ|`|TPvTWaziaa	cena's my fav and he always will be unless someone cooler comes along but actually i did like him better before he was the champ|`|1838b50b11c178bd97308d9bb3b013b9aa	lol well put, most of the Cena fans werent watching wrestling when he debuted anyway, so what you are saying isnt gonna make sense to them|`|2fcfad55502ac06d4c0b54db7447b18aaa	what are you ranting about?

c279df37c09594677fdfb930b0eca85baa	You definitely have to go with Fitzgerald and Galloway. Fitzgerald is going against the 27th best pass defense in the NFL. <br>  <br>  Galloway's stock rose a ton when Rattay stepped on to the field. Cleveland may be the most injury plagued team in the NFL.4 weeks ago they were 6th in pass defense and now they are 17th against the pass. They are missing their entire secondary from the start of the year. Two cornerbacks and one safety are on injured reserve. Galloway will have a huge day to say the least against the Browns. Plus, you saw Rattay burn the Bears. The Bears were the number 1 pass defense in the NFL until Tim Rattay stepped on the field. If Rattay did so well against the Bears, imagine how good he will do against the injury depleted Browns. Galloway is a must start. You won't want to miss out.<br>  <br>  Then, I would go with T.O. Just cause he will get more looks than the other two. Don't go with Booker. Don't even think about it. DON"T PLAY BOOKER! The reason is because Booker was Harrington's go to guy. Harrington may not be playing for the rest of the year. It may be Cleo Lemon rest of the year. Sit Booker. Henderson definitely could do good, but T.O. will get more looks and catches making him a no-brainer third wide out option. Phily pass defense is good. But T.O. will get ample opportunity to succeed.<br>  <br>  Starters: T.O., Fitzgerald, Galloway<br>  <br>   If you would like to see team pass defenses up until this point then go to the website below.|`|1dcd89d066b147fb17782f288f89d93caa	Owens-Always solid, Romo's favorite target. Going against Philly should hinder him but still bank on at least 50 yards and a TD<br>  <br>  Fitz-Leinart's favorite target.San Frans D has played better of late. Always solid too one of 'those' players. Good for 100+ but no TDs I'm feeling.<br>  <br>  Booker-2nd option behind Chambers. Harrington is looking like Lion's boy again. Not always solid but gets in those funks. Good match up against the Jets but might run the ball more because of the run D and Harrington's bad play.<br>  <br>  Galloway-Good WR that struggles because the Buc's QBS can't get him the ball. Good matchup with 'holy' Browns pass D. I'm feeling like Cadillac will get the ball more though, 50 yards no Tds.<br>  <br>  Henderson-Back to being buried in the pack behind Bush and Colston. Still, he is Drew Bree's long ball man and at any given point can haul in a 50 yard TD pass. Giants pass D is pretty good but might be able to slip by because the Giants will press Colston and Bush more. 75 yards (3 receptions) 1 TD.<br>  <br>  Starters:Owens,Fitzgerald, and Henderson. If you don't like Henderson then go with Galloway, then Booker. Hope it helps and good luck!|`|552997f5cda14ecd92784e52182f6ee6aa	start owens, Fitzgerald, and Galloway|`|AA11664928	Owens Galloway and Fitz.|`|b98e749f44ca707d62c9b0bb6a2c5743aa	I would start Owens, Fitzgerald, and Galloway.|`|AA10130483	Owens Fitgerald and Booker...

US9S4Pvnaa	Sorry, never heard of it, but I can offer some advice.<br>  <br>  Most beginners focus on plyometrics way too much when they begin their quest for a higher vertical and put a lot of effort into it but never get anywhere.<br>  <br>  Plyometrics teach your body to express your strength quickly.  However, if the strength is not there to begin with, plyometrics won't help.<br>  <br>  You will improve the most if you first increase your strength to an adequate level before incorporating plyometrics (depth jumps and depth drops).  An adequate level is usually a 1.5 times bodyweight squat, with a 2 times bodyweight squat being ideal.<br>  <br>  You can do light plyometric drills (hopping variations) just to increase coordination or as a warm-up, but increasing your strength should be your priority at first.<br>  <br>  Ask if you need any more help.|`|GnCb89Fsaa	no.

If you hav this taken care of, many of the other things will take care of themselves. <br>  <br>  You will have a major edge in the second half if you don't half to worry about chest pain. While everybody else is worried about sucking air, you will be able to concentrate on shot form and other things. <br>  <br>  So work hard now to take care of your heart-shape. This will be a MAJOR burden to everyone else. Do lot's of running. do what's called LSD- Long Slow Distance. Do this as part of your daily regement. If you get up to about six miles a day, three days a week, you will be unstopable.  <br>  Combine this with sprints for fast break and recovery and you will be the coaches dream come the season.<br>  <br>  Good luck, the hardest part is getting out there and working.|`|bgL74idMaa	Either go to the gym or run around your neighborhood.

Maybe because I have a good coach.

Augie has them playing solid, fundamental ball right now.  The team is showing a lot of power right now and scoring a lot of runs.  My major concern is that they have not faced top tier pitchers in consecutive days, so it's tough to get an idea of how the team will react to this.  <br>  <br>  Historically, Texas has won playing small ball, a key trait of Coach Garrido.  They don't seem to be following that pattern this year and it's tough to win the CWS by outscoring your opponent.  They have a solid pitching staff with 3 good starters but the key will be maintaining offensive production.<br>  <br>  Should be fun to watch.
c07bef522d9ac48ee7dc6e556afb1e29aa	Se fosse uno strappo muscolare non potresti nemmeno camminare, figuriamoci correre.

Consiglio il ghiaccio se il dolore persiste e tanto streaking.|`|gYdsCvtaaa	No forse non è uno strappo, non avresti potuto continuare a correre...comunque avresti dovuto fermarti e fare applicazioni di ghiaccio, ma continuando a correre hai comunque peggiorato la cosa.

ecgGhOmyaa	1) It was a player option, not the team option, meaning it was Bonzi's decision on whether to return or not, so, contractually, the team had no choice (unless they waived him or something).<br>  <br>  2) Like you said, he and Adelman got along in Sacramento and he DID torch Houston's Texas rival, San Antonio in the playoffs so the Rockets may consider him an X-Factor for the season.<br>  <br>  3) His contract is a bargain. After his agent screwed up the Sacramento deal last off-season, he signed for Houston well below market price. Him excercising his option means he's not there for the money so he must geniunely like something about the team (or city, or coach, or whatever), which should be a good thing from the Rockets' perspective.|`|90c488c48e66cde795789abd24cdf280aa	as a rockets fan.....it was very stupid to let bonzi wells comeback...however van gundy did screw him over....can the rockets win with bonzi wells?...yes they can.....but they still need to make a few more moves|`|iREDESO4aa	For whatever reason, Bonzi plays REALLY well for Coach Adelman, and I think this is probably Bonzi's last hurrah.  If this year doesn't work out, he's probably finished.  Since it's a contract year for Bonzi, it would be in his best interest to have a big season so he can market himself as a free agent during the next off-season.  Adelman will find a way to work him into the mix, and I'd be surprised if he doesn't have a much better season than he did last year.

q69fsVWCaa	Splits and your back.  Obviously you want your leaps to hit the splits, so I tried practicing oversplits by elevating the lead leg under the heel.  Yes, it isn't exactly comfortable, but it will tremendously improve your splits.  As for your back, do bridges and try to walk your feet in so they are closer to your hands OR you can do a bridge and then put your legs together so they touch at the ankle and knee and then straigten your leg.  That helps flexibility in your upper.  Those worked for me, and I hope they work for you.  Good luck in competitions!|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Well heres what my gymnastics club does for stretching. Start with running around the gym for five minutes. It will wake you up.<br>  Then do your splits like you normally would, If your down in your splits then do an over split by putting one of your legs on something higher. Hold each leg and middle for two minutes. Then do three bridges to help stretch your back. And for your legs do kicks. Take to steps and then kick forward repeat this 10 times, now move to the back still walk forward but when you kick you will kick backwards and then you can try kicking to the side (Kick as high as you can). Your legs should be warmed up. Now you can just do your generall stretching. <br>  Then your done.<br>  Hope this helped. =)|`|1mtsOtQsaa	<a href="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~bushnell/english-30/materials/new_church/fox_rack_x480-g4.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.upenn.edu/~bushnell/e...</a><br>  I googled a picture to give the best response.|`|KqZtpbibaa	Stretches:<br>  Splits 2 minutes each leg<br>  Bridges <br>  and practise doing perfect round off back handspring in the grass or something then you can manage doing flips when you get to gym.

b8qbnX8Aaa	Not a bad team, but not a great team either, id give it a 7.5.  Bulger is always one of the top fantasy QB's every year and Big Ben should bounce back from that terrible year last year.  Alexander is ur stud at running back and I'd start Dunn over Ronnie Brown until Miami actually gets someone who can throw the ball.  Boldin is a good pic at reciever and Galloway is consistent as long as he's healthy.  Counting on a rookie in Johnson, even though they say he could have a huge year and Stallworth finally had a good year last year in Philly.  Only question is can he duplicate that again this year or will the injury bug bit him in the a** again.  Two good TE's, but then again TE's are hit and miss and don't really score a ton of points, unless you have Gates or Gonzalez.  Good kicker, even though he's been a little inconsistent the last couple years.  And two good solid defenses.  Pittsburgh is always tought and Dallas is going to be one of the better ones this year.<br>  And to mmilner_24, sorry but you need to do a little research on RB's.  Warrick Dunn has been one of the better fantasy RB's the last two years.  Ronnie Brown hasn't done anything, he barely cracked 1000 yards last year and don't expect it out of him this year because the Dolphins are still terrible.|`|MwJlZZQgaa	eh, it's mediocore, but not bad. I would give it a 6.|`|dOFzsff1aa	Good Qbs....decent RB's very good recieving core. The rest is solid i give u a 8.5/10|`|AA11828783	not bad, but not great. I would keep Alexander and Brown. Lewis and Dunn are not that great. You could maybe package one with Galloway for a better reciever, then pick up a backup RB on the waivers

En la tercera entrada David Wright pega un batazo entre jardín derecho y el central.  La pelota no era tan profunda y se podría decir que era un largo sencillo pero José Reyes estaba en la primera y se vino hasta home.  La jugada en home era cerrada y por poco lo ponen out y le permitio a David Wright llegar a la segunda tranquilo.  La velocidad de José Reyes le permitio una carrera a su equipo y un extra base a su companero.  <br>  <br>  Las cámaras seguían la trayectoria de la bola, la tirada a home, y de la jugada en el plato pero no al corredor. Si las cámaras  hubieran fijado en José Reyes correr desde primera a home parecía un galgo.<br>  <br>  Para contestar la pregunta hecha pues solo dijera que aprende algo del Béisbol antes de dar una opinión si fundamentos.

Un Besbolista puede ser muy delgado pero requiere aplicar mucha fuerza para hacer un buen lance o un batazo, en cambio uno con buena masa muscular (no hacen musculo formado y esculpido porque los volveria lentos para lanzar, batear y flidear) requiere menos esfuerzo para el mismo resultado, y con igual esfuerzo se vuela la cerca!

Until I found the right running shoe for me, I was always fighting with shin splints and knee problems.

QFDIATegaa	porque<br>  tiendes a lesionarte mas facilmente, el músculo y las articulaciones de un deportista de fin de semana están mas que duras y ante un esfuerzo físico corre el riesgo de lesión.|`|2076f9159f8d1cf19f3144e3d5e60f4eaa	Creo que el problema qes que al no ghhacer ejercicio a diario o con frecuencia, tu corazón no se adapta además, mas que el musculo el problema es con las articylaciones. Tus musculos no creceran si se fortalecerán, además cada vez q hagas ejercicios vas a manevccer adolorido el dia siguiente, cosa que no sucede con las personas que se ejercitan con regularidad.|`|IsvV57Zwaa	Es cotraproducente porque tú cuerpo se esfuerza demasiado cada vez que tratas de establecer un nivel para esfuerzo físico, es decir, con ejercicio continuo se establece un nivel que tu cuerpo es capaz de adoptar y reconocer, pero cuando dejas demasiado tiempo necesitarás el doble para recuperar el nivel anterior así  que tu cuerpo sufrirá más, y los órganos más afectados en todo son el corazón y los pulmones que son músculos y que necesitan de una rutina constante para mantener su ritmo habitual... |`|xQ7P9ojkaa	Es un poco largo de explicar pero partamos de que no cumples con un principio básico del entrenamiento que es la constancia de acuerdo a un programa progresivo, los músculos necesitan para desarrollarlos, tiempo de trabajo y de descanso donde se recuperan por el trabajo energético y consumo de glucógeno, además de que necesitan tener elasticidad no solo en los músculos sino también los ligamentos y tendones, recuerda que trabajan juntos, si tu quieres puede ser una constancia cada semana o cada 10 días pero realmente te limitas a un nivel de fuerza, elasticidad y resistencia bajo y no das margen para realizar mayor esfuerzo, ahora que pasa cuando quieres ir más allá es decir superar tus metas,. . . . te vas a lesionar por el esfuerzo.<br>  Existe gente que corre cada vez que puede o sábado y domingo, le podríamos llamar que solo es ejercicio de mantenimiento sin nivel competitivo real sino por cierto grado de complemento para la salud, siempre y cuando lo combinen por ejemplo correr las milla 1,600 metros aproximadamente, 15 minutos de estiramientos y 10 minutos de ejercicios que favorescan la técnica, antes de la carrera y 10 minutos de estiramientos y otros 10 de ejercicios de elasticidad y flexibilidad, así no creo que exista da?o, pero si solo sales a correr por correr pues ahí si te vas a lastimar incluso puedes ir lesionando paulatinamente incluso tus sistemas y aparatos que componen nuestro cuerpo, entre otros; el músculoesqueletico (articulaciones),  como el cardiovascular, también es importante aclarar que los pulmones no son músculos, pero si dependen principalmente de un músculo para realizar su trabajo y es el "flexo solar".<br>  <br>  En concreto que pasa a nivel músculo, sí lo desarrollas, pero de manera límitada, combinado con el espejismo psicológico de que estas haciendo ejercicio te confías y cuando lo o los exijas en otros deportes o situaciones de acción inmediata, como salir corriendo para alcanzar el autobus, lo puedes lastimar, y al hablar de atletismo te recomiendo, si es tu caso, que mejor le dediques más tiempo este deporte es buenísimo.|`|7kRTgs3jaa	lo trabajas sin tener una practica... osea en esa semana tu musculo se recupera si pasa el tiempo vuelve otra vez como estaba antes de que lo trabajaras entonces es como quien dice con 0 resultado<br>  deverias hacerlo por lo menos dia por medio o cada 2 dias<br>  saludos<br>  |`|lJNH4tikaa	ajjjajajajaja como a jansyyyyyyyyy jaajajajajaj k tiene movimientos esporadicos jajAJAJAJAJAJ|`|4E74ZuTFaa	t ebay para el suelo

Ya era hora...<br>  Saludos.
nS5hPqoTaa	Bueno, es una combinacion de factores....No le hace falta una sola cosa para mejorar. <br>  Primero y principal les hace falta una buena dirigencia; mejores Directores Tecnicos y entrenadores.<br>  <br>  Segundo les hace falta mejores jugadores...Sin animos de ofender pero no hay grandes jugadores, son todos regulares, ninguno se destaca. Los mejorcitos son Giovani Dos Santos, Rafa Marquez, Pavel Pardo, Guille Ochoa, Borgetti, Blanco...Les hace falta mas experiencia internacional; jugar mas en el exterior, ganar mundiales sub-20. No se hace un jugador de un dia para otro; los jugadores que van a ser buenos lo son a los 15, 16 a?os. Mexico nisiquiera ha ganado un mundial sub-20. Solo han ganado un mundial sub-17. Juegan muy poco en el exterior; de los jugadores de sleccion solo hay 9 jugando en el exterior. Es muy distinto el futbol de liga de Mexico (entre mexicanos). <br>  <br>  Otra cosa que les afecta es la actitud que tienen. Cuando comienzan una competencia o un mundial piensan que van a salir campeones....hay que poner los pies sobre la tierra. Para ser campeones o sub campeones mundiales hay que ser muy bueno; hay que competir con grandes potencias como Alemania, Francia, Italia, Holanda, Inglaterra y Brasil y Argentina de America Latina. Mexico esta mejorando dia a dia, pero no se puede comparar con naciones que obtenido titulos y copas mundiales. Hay que tener un poco mas de humildad y aprender de los errores. No hay que sentirse con superioridad, porque Mexico se piensa que porque le gana a los paises centroamericanos o caribe?os es el mejor del mundo, y no es asi...<br>  <br>  Espero que esto conteste tu pregunta.

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	With mx bikes the order of how big your bike is, is really governed by firstly your age and then pretty much your ability.  I know with my youngest son he would start racing a section on a stock bike and then once he was riding the bike to optimum we work get extras added to it until the bike eventually has to be ported and blue printed to make it more of a rocket ship to be able to compete and keep up with his ability.  Then he would get older and have to move to an older section with a larger bike.  He is now turning senior next year and is racing his crf250r at optimum and it is time to get another bike (the same) so it will be fresh for the start of the year.  He will get a 450cc when he can physically pick it up.  But till then he will have to go to riding only one class and although the races are longer as a senior, it will be a change for him as he was allowed to race 3 classes this year.  So I don't think in racing mx it is a case of wanting a bigger bike but a natural progression.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	No one races a 125 or 250 2 stroke anymore, they just cannot compete with the 4 strokes. A 250F is not that much heavier than a 125, so it really isn't bigger. It feels exactly the same to me just better power. Same with a 450F versus a 250 2 stroke. A 4 stroke is much easier to ride in every way. |`|x3QdSOAeaa	Well think of it this way<br>  <br>  some people prefer bigger bikes to smaller bikes because think about it, would you rather be riding a bike thats bigger for you or smaller?<br>  <br>  with the smaller bike you may be a little underpowered, its to small and just uncomfortable to ride, but with the bigger bikes you have more power, you can move around alot more hence it being more comfortable and easier to ride<br>  <br>  i myself can only just touch the ground on my crf250r, its a tad big but the 250,s and 250's are around the largest size of bike you can get (height wise) so your already riding a full sized bike unless you got to a 600 ir somthing crazy like that<br>  <br>  It isnt hard to control big bikes and remember that they are all different and all take time to get used to but in the end you can ride just about any bike that you want all you have to do is practise on it and get used to it.|`|J8jV4DsQaa	hiii natie...i tell u why,it shows the power lies in you the more powerful bike, the more powerful u r, so guys like to ride high capacity bike,i know its hard to control bt as a guy i also prefer high power bike cause u got great feelin when ride on that,u just flow like air there's no such great feelin other than....its so coool|`|Lsng62eLaa	power...

AA10785898	Both have good upside, so I'll put down some things to consider.<br>  <br>  1.  San Diego is at home.<br>  2. Oakland is coming off a bye week.  That usually means rust.<br>  2A. Culpepper only completed 5 passes against a pathetic Miami defense.<br>  3. Oakland's strength so far has been running the ball, but Lamont Jordan is hurt, and San Diego is a good run-stuffing team.<br>  4. Minnesota is still unsettled at QB for the week.  That sometimes means a short field for your defense if they turn it over.  They might give up more points.<br>  5. Minnesota is coming off of a bye, so the defense is rested, but again the offense may be rusty, out-of-synch.<br>  6. Brian Griese is not Tom Brady.  He's been mistake prone.<br>  <br>  All things considered, I am playing San Diego hoping that they build on momentum from last week.  Their offense should be clicking better, and that keeps the defense fresh.<br>  <br>  Go with your gut... this has been a weird season.|`|KWWXZrJQaa	minnesota has been a monster of a defense this year.  the bears are USUALLY anemic on offense.  both are good plays but I'd stick with a more consistent vikings defense.|`|a0c95fc1a67ea521b01c5ac057a51aa2aa	I would definetely start the chargers.

ntS2iHa0aa	Yo creo que cada deporte tiene un gran deportista, leyenda de su especialidad pero yo votaria por Lance Armstrong sobrevivio al cancer y logro superarse con deporte logrando 7 Tours de francia y encima uso su fama para iniciar una fundacion para prevenir, informar y estudiar el Cancer, asi como apoyar a las personas que padecen dicha enfermedad.<br>  <br>  LANCE ARMSTRONG<br>  es un ciclista convertido ya en una leyenda por su superación de un cáncer y posterior victoria en siete Tours de Francia consecutivos, algo que ningún otro ciclista ha logrado hasta el momento nunca.<br>  <br>  En octubre de 1996 se le detectó un cáncer testicular con metástasis pulmonares y cerebrales. Gracias a una quimioterapia agresiva, pero seleccionada para no disminuir su capacidad pulmonar, Lance pudo recuperarse progresivamente <br>  <br>  Lance pensaba definitivamente en retirarse de las competiciones deportivas, pero tras fuertes reflexiones y con el apoyo del director Johan Bruyneel decidió seguir, de cara a 1999, Armstrong se encontraba pletórico de moral y su director le convenció de que era posible incluso llegar a la meta más alta: vencer el Tour de Francia, el no era de los favoritos pero al final arrasó en la clasificación general por delante de Alex Zülle.<br>  <br>  Y así, a?o tras a?o se fue armando un equipo cada vez mejor que no defraudó en ningún momento. Cada a?o, tanto Armstrong como su equipo iban a más; y antes de que muchos pudieran darse cuenta el texano llegó a la edición de 2003, el Tour del Centenario, con la mira puesta en igualar la marca de cinco Tours consecutivos de Miguel Induráin. Lo logro.<br>  <br>  En 2004 Armstrong aspiraba a hacer aún más grande su leyenda, y lo hacía más cuestionado que nunca, tras los apuros pasados el a?o anterior y el bajo rendimiento que había mostrado durante su preparación para "el sexto". Pero el ciclista estadounidense volvió a sorprender ganando el Sexto Tour de Francia imponiendo una nueva marca.<br>  <br>  El 18 de abril de 2005 anuncia en rueda de prensa en Georgia que se retirará tras intentar el asalto al séptimo Tour en julio, pese a tener un a?o más de contrato con su equipo actual, el Discovery Channel  el cual tambien Gano siendo ahora el record 7 tours de Francia<br>  <br>  En 2006 Armstrong corre la maratón de Nueva York con el fin de conseguir fondos para la lucha contra el cáncer, haciendo un tiempo de 2h59:37 llegando a menos de 1 hora del ganador, el brasile?o Marilson Gomes dos Santos (2h09:58).<br>  <br>  Tambien fundo The Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF) fundacion que está convencida de que en la batalla contra el cáncer, el conocimiento es poder y la actitud es todo. A partir de que se realiza el diagnóstico, ellos suministraninformación práctica y las herramientas necesarias para vivir con fortaleza. La Fundación concentra sus actividades en programas de la comunidad, iniciativas nacionales de propugnación, subsidios para la investigación científica y clínica, y recursos y educación para sobrevivir, entre lo que se incluye la pulsera Amarulla Live Strong (vive con fortaleza), el recurso integral de LAF para los supervivientes al cáncer. LAF fue fundada en 1997 por el sobreviviente al cáncer y campeón de ciclismo Lance Armstrong|`|112861b0e6e1319214bb167521ec47f5aa	Bueno, pues de los que me han tocado ver sin duda el mejor para mí ha sido Michael Jordan, era determinante en su equipo, siempre asumia la responsabilidad del ganador, tenia en sus manos el tiro ganador cuando se necesitaba, ya sea para definir un juego de rutina como para definir un campeonato, sobresalia absolutamente de todos los demas, ademas de ser un extraordinario deportista, simpre tuvo una imagen intachable como persona, era un iman de publicidad, la liga NBA se dividia entre Michel Jordan y los demas. Varias veces definio los juegos grandes en el último tiro que salio de sus manos.<br>  <br>  Un deportista ejemplar, un ser humano que vinbo desde abajo, lucho contra la adversidad, en el colegio su entrenador le dijo que no sobresaldria en el Basquet bol por que era de estaura raltivamente baja y ademas era débil, y depsues de ello ya todos conocemos la historia del mejor jugador de baloncesto de todos los tiempos y para mí uno de los mejores deportistas o el mejor de toda la historia.<br>  <br>  P.D. Y no me gusta mucho el basquet bol.

Gore might have a slighly better year, but Rudi is a safer bet. Your WR are already pretty solid, but this makes them very solid.

VHp086UWaa	1. First you need to scout the team to see what they need.  You can ask the coaches what positions they need more depth at the most.  If you try out for that position you will have a better chance of making the team.(if they have a cut)  Don't kiss up to the coaches too much but speak and have small conversations from time to time. <br>  <br>  2. Next you need to figure out what position you want to play and would be best at.  Go on the Internet and find as many books as possible on  the position.  You only have one year to play so you have to take in as much info as you can.  <br>  <br>  3. Finally watch football on TV, college and pro.  You can learn a lot from the best players in the nation and some commentary.<br>  <br>  This should get you started and I hope it works out for you.|`|W5S1QUJPaa	a senior in high school?  if so u have a chance...it really depends on how much heart u have....and if ur any good....if ur in high school ur height isn't to big of a thing to think about it....i was 5' 9" and started quarterback all 4 years of high  school on Varsity....but if ur somewhat fast...try going out for CB or a slot receiver...in pick up games i usually play Wr now because i am more dominant at the position...just find the position that u want to play and practice that position over and over again|`|WjiHe4jvaa	If you want to play football you must go in a club and start playing there.I think they will tell you if you are good enough for this sport,but in my opinion if you start playing you must train regularly.|`|cHBK64mTaa	i dont know what u need but u can do anything u put ur mind to. gl hun.

White and Foster are about the same.  Right now Foster is ahead of White but you have to think about the whole year and they will end up with the same stats roughly I think.   <br>  Toomer I thought looked pretty good for his age last week not that he will win you any games but I thought he looked good|`|8d166f3158dec4eecdd2b3ce0fad2804aa	No  - still wouldn't do it.

38b0f3f3c60255bdf08f21c057999758aa	Peterson still gets the start because you don't know who is going to be the goal line RB or how exactly they are going to be sharing carries - obviously Peterson has established himself as a primary RB and only next week will you be able to adjust for sure.  <br>  <br>  For WRs, Welker should be one because Brady and his boys are going to pass all day on Cinci's poor pass defense - Welker should be a viable target.  I would probably go with Holmes next just because Big Ben certainly will be eyeing him in the end zone this week.  Berrian is tricky because you don't know who Griese is going to be looking for, if anybody.  I would sit him out and just watch the game unfold.  Brown is clearly not the Eagles primary receiver, and neither is Marshall or Bowe on their teams, so all of them should remain on the bench.<br>  <br>  So: Peterson, Welker, and Holmes for this week.  Good luck.|`|kjsVkB1Laa	AS a rabid Ohio State fan, I am angry for you calling him Sanantonio Holmes, but I tap Welker and Holmes for this weekend. I guarantee AT LEAST a touchdown and 60yds for Welker. Holmes is a definite start also, with Hines Ward as the main WR for Pitt being injured. You sort of posted a similar WR question to mine.<br>  <br>  Start Peterson, he'll suck it up and play.|`|RkFT7V9Baa	Try to start any RBs that are getting the start.<br>  <br>  You got pretty bad WR options but i would start Marshall(walker hurt), Welker, and Holmes(ward hurt).

Detroit may have the worse defense in the entire NFL and teams have just carved them up any way they have wanted too.  add too it all the injuries on the Chicago defense and you get an equation where Chicago will want to run the ball to keep its defense and Detroits offense off the field.  If Griese doesn't throw picks (like Grossman did) then its all the better <br>  <br>  Expect both back too look good, but i give the nod to Benson because i think he has a better chance to get 2 TD's.  If you play in a PPR league (points per reception) go ahead and go w/ your gut if it says Jordan cause he can steal four or five catches on any given Sunday.  If you don't have a PPR league its a pretty easy choice.|`|quT7AXCRaa	JORDAN

KWWXZrJQaa	I think Evans and Colston start to heat up and you'll be fine at wr.  Chambers has historically fallen off at the end of the year.  If you need a rb then do it.|`|DmE47G0laa	you look pretty set at wr. curry, coles, and santana moss is solid enough. sure, they may not be producing semi-consistently (other than coles), but even colston will be ok very soon, if not by this weekend.<br>  <br>  brandon jacobs has more value than chambers any given day.|`|V977mV3Paa	I like Chambers of that lot; push another wr at him such as Crayton his value is at it's peak, maybe Moss skins suck.|`|xbgjKPyxaa	Everyone's high on Jacobs - but I prefer Derrick Ward for yardage. Jacobs will likely play a limited role from this point forward as Ward has proven he can carry the load - Jacobs has 26 rushing yards this year.<br>  <br>  Chambers, probably the 25th best receiver in the league, has put up double-digit points each week except for one and should light it up pretty well against Houston this week. Keep him. Counter that trade with Colston for Jacobs...

Thee is more upside there than the others.|`|O4dkkqj2aa	I wouldn't go with MJD cuz 1) he's splitting time with Taylor and 2) I think he's having a sophomore slump.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd go with either Welker or Patrick Crayton. Reason being...?...Look who they've got at QB. Crayton will get looks as a #3 behind me-o and Jason Witten against the Bills and Tom Brady will spread the ball around like he used to so Welker will get some looks.|`|qk1cPg44aa	jones-drew and i aint tellin you why!you don't need to know why.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hello.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hello.com</a>|`|89215263dd58c2b6823e421fc15c68c0aa	I'm personally going with Crayton.

AA10785898	I have Brees, and he's killed my team.  He has 8 points for the entire year.  Even crummy QBs can get 8-10 points a week.<br>  <br>  I don't think you can trust him right now.  Seattle has been pretty stingy on defense, and Brees can't rely on the running game with Deuce out.  He should be firmly on your bench until something changes, which right now looks less and less likely.<br>  <br>  Anderson has been good with cosmetic points, even against tough opponents.<br>  <br>  Miami's defense has been soft, and Anderson should have a decent outing.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	im from new orleans and im tellling you, the offense just looks completely lost on every single play. brees either throws a int or and incompletion. go with anderson. he's actually been the unsung hero this year. he's compiled a pretty decent fantasy season. he's having fans in cleveland say brady who?|`|796236e92a12bcc49a378a4de65ca0ddaa	Are you kidding, Anderson. New Orleans has been and looks like they will continue to suck all year.|`|bzmRqKH7aa	I have Brees too and I waiting for him to have that breakout game.  Hopefully it happens this week but so I would go with Brees.|`|e8huelzTaa	Do you have a third option? Just kidding Anderson is good for fantasy points. Even if Brees has a big week, it will barely mirror what Anderson will do and has done all season.|`|sfEMRwRWaa	haha im in the same predicament as you. but im going with anderson no doubt he's been averaging 25 points in my league and is good for atleast 2 TDs a week and 250+yards <br>  <br>  and as far as brees goes until he proves he can throw TDs he will ride the bench
lOuMvM73aa	That's really kool, I usually go to see Raw especially, but I do also go see smackdown because of Rey Mesterio, Undertaker, Kane, Batista, and all of them. It is awesome to get ringside. Maybe someday I'll see you there! :)|`|lW1cDqCeaa	Awesome! You are so lucky. WWE completely bypassed my city. They didn't have all the wrestler at the show so they just did what they could to promote Cyber Sunday. Hope it helped. BTW did alot of people leave after an Undertaker match? That's what I've heard|`|65cf721831c6b55073e81a617635c296aa	They didn't have a full crew in England and so they wanted to promote Cyber Sunday so the matches were brief to suite their need for promos for their next big pay per view. Sorry that the fans had to suffer this.|`|2qjIcSY6aa	because wwe has put drama first before action. i still watch wwe and i probobly always will, but tna is more exciting.
PJrXqMohaa	If you have room on your roster, then yes. If you have a backup running back on your roster that you rarely start, then it's worth it to pick up Young instead. Shanahan's offense has consistently produced 1,000 yard + rushers. One wildcard may be Mike Bell... he was the running back of choice a year ago, and he's currently the backup fullback. There's a slight chance he may take away some of Selvin's carries.|`|1qJCaT7eaa	I think it is as long as you have the flexibility to stash him on your bench until a final decision on Henry comes down.|`|GrUegc64aa	Depends on how long you can afford to hold him and wait. <br>  <br>  I have him too, and it looks like this Henry case could stretch out for a loooong time. But if you have the empty roster spot and you're okay at RB for now, it will probably pay off in the end. Keep in mind that there are other backup runners too, so he may split carries sometimes.|`|PlAMTNfXaa	I'd wait a little bit. Henry is going down, no question about it. But he will try and suspend it for as long as possible. If you don't mind having deadweight on your bench and you can do it, go for it. But if your like me you want active players who can do something, you might want to wait a minute.|`|AA10785898	The soonest any suspension for Henry would begin is mid-November.<br>  <br>  Young may or may not get more reps than normal.  But if Henry is expected to be out, Shanahan is likely to run him into the ground while he has him available.<br>  <br>  This comes down to how much "dead weight" you are willing to carry.  If you can afford to stash him on your bench for 3-5 weeks, do so. <br>  <br>  He has great upside, but in this season with all the injuries and turmoil, he may not be worth it.|`|IttNaVrbaa	You better believe it!  There's no way Henry will play the entire season and Denver doesn't have depth a RB.  He will end up paying big dividends towards the end of the season.
dLw6QG4eaa	I would trade one for one <br>  I think that you would be giving up too much for the WR and RB for TE<br>  Try to just give up one WR for clark<br>  <br>  Then you can give up Cooley and Young for # 2RB or WR <br>  <br>  See how that would help you.<br>  <br>  If they want 2 people try and little weaker WR with young and see what they say.|`|iul7KYtAaa	I would go with Chambers as the guy to trade. The Chargers rely on their running game, and when they pass it's to Gates and LT first. Wide receivers are secondary only.

How did you get such a good team in an eleven manager league. The only spot I could say needs improvement is WR. Maybe try trading A. Johnson and maybe J. Jones for R. Williams. I think that would improve your team. But after this week dude, I still think you're gonna be undefeated. Hope this helps, good luck!|`|GrUegc64aa	I would be everything I own that you are going to win, hehehe.  <br>  <br>  Earnest Graham isn't that great, LaMont Jordan is worthless, Arnaz Battle is on a terrible offense ... <br>  <br>  You have Tom Brady and LT - enough said. <br>  <br>  You might want to take Andre Johnson out of your lineup - he probably won't play, I think.|`|rytyt5klaa	if you want to blow him out of the warter try to get larrey jonshen and youll have a unbeatable team
gtmzZJsKaa	Scheffler, he had some decent numbers against Green Bay, and their defense is pretty good, against detroit i think he will put up even better numbers...|`|GrUegc64aa	Maybe Scheffler - he's gotten TDs lately.|`|FVh9oFjXaa	Go with Scheffler against the weak Det D.

Obviamente sin sus compa?eros no lo hubiera logrado pues 1 contra 11 imagínate... Igual Maradona, sin sus compa?eros no hubiera sido el gran jugador que fue. Pero a Pelé se le reconoce mucho que halla sobresalido entre tantas estrellas que tenía junto a él. Respecto a que jugó muchísimos a?os al fútbol así como Raúl pues te lo voy a decir sinceramente: Tienes que tener una gran categoría para debutar en un club como el Real Madrid o mejor aún, en una selección como la de Brasil a los 17 a?os. Esto no lo hace cualquiera; tal vez tendrán muchos a?os de jugar pero por qué debutaron tan jóvenes??? Por su calidad...<br>  Por ahí leí que alguien puso que Pelé no salió de Brasil... Recuerden que antes la liga brasile?a era la mejor del mundo...|`|QFDIATegaa	parece que hay varios que no saben de fútbol (como Max S)<br>  Maradona jamas a jugado contra Cruyff<br>  en el equipo de Pelé jamas jugo Zico (otra epoca)y menos Eusebio (Portugal)<br>  <br>  Es cierto que Pelé solo no gano las 3 copas<br>  pero Maradona + los campeónes del mundo de 1978 Argentina no pudieron ganar la copa de 1982, y en el 94 por culpa del doping Argentina quedo en el camino.|`|TLWbfVyQaa	Pele jugo con Garrincha y fue el mejor<br>  Jugó con Didi y fue el mejor.<br>  Jugó contra Beckembauer, y fue el mejor.<br>  Jugó contra todos y siempre se destaco por encima, eso tiene su merito, no crees?<br>  Fue el lider de un ataque donde estaban Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostato y Rivelino, unos fenomenos. Ser mejor entre los mejores es una muestra de su grandeza.<br>  Saludos.|`|bBIgtcpbaa	Hola, tienes razón pero asi como tu dices que son 11 jugadores, si Pelé no hubiera conformado ese equipo serían 10 y otro jugador más, y a lo mejor ese jugador no aportaba lo que aporto Pelé, he ahí el detalle.<br>  <br>  Muchas gracias.|`|c6ffe04c52e1620bdf3465a65e1b570daa	nadie esta diciendo que porque ganas mas copas o tienes mas goles eres el mejor del mundo. <br>  pero son elementos que pesan, que sirven de respaldo para tu curriculum.<br>  <br>  ademas si eres campeón del mundo porque no decirlo? el hecho de que tengas 22 jugadores campeones no te quita el derecho de decir que eres campeón<br>  <br>  logicamente que es cierto que los goles y copas no son todo<br>  Cruyff (subcampeón)<br>  Distefano (no brillo en mundiales)<br>  Van basten (0 goles en mundiales)|`|fc1e11d8a53c9531442ad08f23ef85f3aa	bueno al menos las 3 copas q gano lo hizo en la cancha y nunca he escuchado que le haya pagado a un equipo como peru para q se dejara ganar como en argentina 78. por otro lado tambien fue grande en el santos por eso se llamaba el "Santos de Pelè" en el cual lo gano todo, tambien metiò mas de 1000 goles y era uno de los jugadores mas completos de la historia. <br>  <br>  Bueno si quieres ver quien ha sido el mejor jugador lo q queda al final son las estadisticas que son un criterio objetivo y real mientras q la calidad es algo subjetivo. La cantidad de copas que se ganan es un buen criterio ya q son una prueba de que se estuvo en un equipo ganador y a un alto nivel|`|6WtccV1yaa	Pele fue y sera un monstruo...por lo feo. No,  hablando en serio fue un crack. pero es cierto lo que planteas. al lado de él tenia tipos que tambien la rompian y asi es mucho mas fácil ganar. si queres te nombro algunos: Garrincha, Vavá, Jairzinho, Tostao, Rivelino, Jerson...|`|9sXPovTIaa	Tienes razón, pelé no es el mejor jugador del mundo. Pelé fue el mejor del mundo, hasta que se retiró. Lo que dices es cierto, el equipo de futbolistas que acompa?aba a pelé era el equipo de las estrellas prácticamente, pero pelé tenía el don, la magia, la bondad y todo lo necesario para dejar la sensación de que estaba jugando él solo contra el equipo contrario. Sin duda fue un grande, que nunca necesitó de drogas para lucirse como otros.|`|BOK2o6GAaa	es uno de los dos jugadores desequilibrantes que  han existido en el mundo, el otro esw maradona.<br>  cuando jugaba pele, podia jugar con mi hermana, atajar mi abuela, el solo era el equipo, los demas solo acompa?an.<br>  como maradona, los demas.... estaban ahi.<br>  no es como ronaldhino acaso es el mejor jugador del mundo? ... si lo sera, por que el rafa le pasa las pelotas, messi se las da como con la mano, pero que hizo en el mundial? no es un jugador desekilibrante,<br>  si yo fuera kikin fonseca y lo tubiera de compa?ero a messi, a rafa, y tambien meteria goles, mi abuela con 82 a?os meteria goles.<br>  por eso independientemente de quien sea mejor, pele o maradona, fueron los unicos jugadores, que no importaban lo que fueran  sus compa?eros.|`|ETIW4MDkaa	Pienso lo mismo que tú.|`|GGEjzcmCaa	porque el iso la mayoria de los goles pero es mas importante un jugador como maradona q maneja mejor la pelota ace mas lujos q pele q ace goles no digo que pele no ace lujos sino q maradona ace mas y mejores|`|GQ0556J6aa	Buen pensamiento... creo que hay algo de certero en esa perspectiva, por algo son "equipos" de fútbol, y gana todo y no sólo el jugador... tal vez es algo que se relaciona con la popularidad... de todas maneras es bueno destacar a uno del grupo cuando tiene calidad, técnica, buena capacidad , agilidad a tono y astucia para con el espacio.<br>  suerte!|`|I7wIzdfLaa	Entonces por calidad el mejor es...

No, Maradona sí lo hizo... <br>  <br>  Yo creo que la envidia de la gente en contra de la Argentina, les nubla la objetividad en estos tópicos...

344dbebf643386d6cad63f28f9857b88aa	Pues yo creo que actualmente Robinho es el jugador más en forma del equipo,y que todo lo que dijo Pelé en su momento sobre él lleva camino de realizarse.A Robinho le hacía falta un entrenador que le diese cierta libertad en su juego,para que el brasile?o sacase toda la magia que lleva dentro,y menos mal que Schuster lo ha hecho.Con Capello,Robinho era un jugador suplente,que las pocas veces que salía al campo estaba dubitativo e inseguro,y un jugador de su tremenda clase necesita tener el balón y sentirlo en sus pies.Pero si tenemos en cuenta que al italiano no le gusta el juego de ataque,pues ahí queda todo explicado.Y es más,me voy a "mojar" y me voy a atrever a decir que,de no ocurrirle ningún percance al brasile?o,de aquí a dos o tres a?os podremos estar hablando sin ninguna duda del mejor jugador del mundo.Por calidad y juventud no va ha quedar la cosa...<br>  Un saludo.|`|99546e4c48dbc0fabbf4700679f27a7aaa	En la actualidad del domingo sí fue el mejor, jaja.<br>  Para mí el Real Madrid tiene tres indiscutibles: Casillas, Sergio Ramos y Van Nistelroy, son los más regulares.|`|4457a43a6f8bd1e15fccb35837880d6baa	El mejor, sigue siendo, Casillas.|`|1a1d63b050745400846bd3903bef99d4aa	Robinho es el jugador del Madrid con más técnica de balón, y tal vez el jugador de campo más en forma del equipo blanco pero el mejor del Real Madrid sigue siendo el 'salvador', Iker Casillas que ha evitado más de un disgusto a los madridistas.<br>  <br>  Sin duda, ayer se hizo un partidazo con un bonito gol (el segundo) y fue el encargado de abrir el gol de la victoria con el saque de banda de "pillo" que hizo. Pero, quiero decirles a los madridistas que aún le queda mucho a Robinho para ser como O Rey Pelé o para lograr todo lo que logró Ronaldinho (2 Fifas Wordl Player, 2 FifPro y 1 Balon de Oro). <br>  <br>  Ducktoy|`|Fndm0DH3aa	tiene rato que es uno de los mejores jugadores del mundo actualmente, y está entre los mejores del Madrid, lo vengo diciendo desde el a?o pasado, que ganó la copa América y la liga de Espa?a, cosa que otros jugadores mas inflados como messi no pudieron hacer.|`|QFDIATegaa	de momento parece que si|`|ArMJkoCBaa	Robi?o "Robishow" sin duda es el mejor creador de juego que tiene el Madrid, Pero en mi opinion TODOS son exelentes en la pocision que se desempe?an, Iker como arquero, Robi?o como creador, Ruud como goleador, en fin... en el Madrid estan los mejores, y todos son los mejores en la posicion que se desempe?an ya sea en defesa en el medio o en la delantera.<br>  <br>  HALA MADRID!!!HALA MADRID!!!|`|BOKMyoOLaa	yo opino.. k en este momento el mejor del madrid es IKER CASILLAS|`|FzTuoLjiaa	Ni de co?a.

Robinho todavía no puede competir por ser el mejor delantero del mundo, todavía no lo es de su equipo (en goles).|`|lLvo0VKfaa	Si algo tiene este Madrid es que no se basa en un solo jugador(tipo Barcelona)... sino que procura jugar mas colectivamente, sino jamas escucháramos a Casillas, Sergio Ramos a Van Nistelrooy a Raul y al mismo Robinho, es dificil encontrar en este club al mejor, pues todos tienen algo....en el ultimo partido si fue la figura indiscutiblemente, algo inegable es que es que mejor trata al balon, cosa que no hace Vangol, o Raul, su talento es el mas grande induvidualmente talves con el de Snejider, pero te repito, este Madrid juega en grupo y es muy dificil sacar al mejor.....|`|uKBCWMtKaa	Poco a poco Robinho ha ido madurando hasta convertirse en un gran ídolo, sin tanto protagonismo novelesco ha demostrado ser un excelente jugador de fútbol, y la figura del Real

X99es3FNaa	Esistono forme di allenamento specifiche per il fattore velocità, le cosiddette "ripetute". Consistono nel percorrere brevi tratti (100m., 200m., 400m., 800 m., ecc.) ad una velocità molto sostenuta (diciamo almeno 20 sec. in meno di quanto tu impieghi normalmente a percorrere tale distanza); quindi recuperi per un periodo di circa 1,5 - 2 minuti, per poi percorrere nuovamente la stessa distanza alla stessa velocità.<br>  Ovviamente avrai bisogno di un percorso calcolato, possibilmente una pista, oppure di aver tracciato a terra il tuo percorso.<br>  Lo scopo delle ripetute è quello di potenziare la tua resistenza cardiaca, che normalmente è il primo fattore che consente la velocità.<br>  Tuttavia, è opportuno, prima di iniziare, effettuare una visita cardiologica che ti garantisca il perfetto recupero cardiaco e l'assenza di qualunque forma di problema in tal senso.<br>  In bocca al lupo!<br>  Gforfan<br>  <a href="http://runnerswelcome.myblog.it/" rel="nofollow">http://runnerswelcome.myblog.it/</a>|`|6wGTbCETaa	Allora,anke io ho avuto il tuo stesso problema, cmq devi capire ke nn siamo fatti tutti x correre.seguendo un buon allenamento, questo allenamento vedrai dei risultati corsa dopo corsa.

Por la ciudad y barrios de alrrededores, generalmente suele haber más tráfico de coches y todo el humo que sueltan los coches lo vas inhalando cuando vas corriendo, en un parque gracias a los arboles el ambiente es más puro y el aire está más oxigenado. En segundo lugar y ahora que se acerca el verano en los parque suelen bajar algunos grados de temperatura con respecto a la ciudad, el ambiente es más humedo. Y en tercer lugar si dentro del parque corres por una zona de alvero o similar que no sea asfalto, las articulaciones sufren menos.<br>  <br>  Saludos, espero haberte sido de ayuda.|`|ogfEChyuaa	te recomiendo que utlices la pista mas ligera para correr por ejemplo si la pista de vicicleta es de concreto o de piso firme; usa este tipo de pista ya que si corres en un lugar con tierra o cesped te cansas mucho mas rapido.

Of course, if it's not a nice breathable hat, you may cause your head to sweat a lot more, which will make your body work harder to shed heat instead of working hard to run.  Get a nice runner's hat and you'll be good.<br>  <br>  To build up distance and speed you have to train for both.  Running a 6:30 mile is certainly not "novice" speed so I'd suggest maybe you follow a structured training plan that is normally suited for 5K racing.  The master has always been Hal Higdon:<br>  <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/5K%20Training/5-Kadv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halhigdon.com/5K%20Training/5...</a>|`|JdK1UFo7aa	Well you firs have to do long runs to make the two mile run look easy run 5 miles a day and then 4 then 3  and wen you hit 2 mile run to make it easier run two laps then sprint one run one than sprint one and then jog and then sprint till you get to the last lap and wen its last lap you give all your energy and sprint! this exercise will make you lose a lot of body fat and make your 2 mile run look easy! then when you run it for time you should keep the same paste until the lust 200 meters wen you have left 200 meters you sprint as fast as you can! <br>  This exercise helped me I had to run two miles for my soccer team in 14 min. but I made it in 10 min 40 sec and I am only 15 That was my new record!!! I run everyday you should too just change your running a bit don't do the same run over and over do some hills, sprints, long jogs, run 100 meters sprint 100 run 100meters and repeat it 7 times!   <br>  Take one day of  a week! and drink a lot of water at least 8 glasses per day! good luck! You can do it!<br>  and also running with a hat will slow you down a bit because of extra weight but its better to run with it if it is really sunny.|`|9uaAdQp7aa	well you should firt take it easy so your stomach wont get a side ache then id say 1 hour of running so youll make the teem

Best offense in the NFL but defense is getting older and they lost half of their DBs.<br>  4. Giants. Super Bowl champs. Best pass rushing team in the NFL.<br>  5. Cowboys. Very talented team, but choke artists when it really matters. Is this the year they finally get it done.

Much less is known, though, about the potential impact of carbohydrate and electrolyte drinks on performance of the intermittent high-intensity exercise typical of team sports like football and basketball.<br>  <br>  That gap in knowledge has now been filled to a large extent by a US study demonstrating that carbohydrate and electrolyte drinks during team sport exercise preserve both physical and central nervous system (CNS) function, so alleviating performance declines in the later stages of games.<br>  <br>  Twenty active men and women performed two experimental trials during which they were fed either a 6% carbohydrate solution or a fluid-and-electrolyte placebo. The trials consisted of four 15-minute quarters of shuttle running at varying intensities and 40 jumps at a target positioned at 80% of maximal vertical jump height.<br>  <br>  During each break the subjects performed a battery of tests designed to measure peripheral and CNS function, including 20m sprints, a 60s maximal jumping test, internal and external mood evaluation, and tests of cognitive function, force sensation, motor skills and target jumping accuracy.<br>  |`|Twb0zNU7aa	Powerade or water they usually show them drink it i never seen them drink anything else|`|h4H80Vsqaa	Tomato juice|`|8Amir7Nlaa	gatorade?|`|qFNT4iWDaa	its called muscle milk my dad drinks it hes david beckam|`|euZRbiA2aa	a high energy drink like lucozade sport|`|ZX0ackIraa	probably gatorade or powerade

9akK1ssHaa	i would say he is worth a shot the way anderson has been playing this year, i used to think tarvaris jackson was the worst starter in the nfl, but anderson can't even hit a screen pass|`|dJnRFpWWaa	I don't know. What I do know is that the Browns have to establish a better running game. That means the offensive line has to run block a lot better than it has to date, and it also means that the offensive coordinator has to make a commitment to establishing the running game at the outset of each game.<br>  <br>   The passing game feeds off of the success of the running game unless you are running the West Coast Offense. It is not the other way around. Is the passing game important? Of course it is, but far to many bad things can and do happen to an offense that is overly dependent on its passing game to score points. <br>  <br>   I go back to when Sam Rutigliano was the Browns head coach and the Browns played in the best football stadium in America down in the flats. Check out the films of the offense from those years and you will see that Brian Sipe managed a nice running game with a controlled passing game featuring Ozzie Newsome and the great leaper from the University of Colorado. Run, run, run. Run, pass, run. Run, run, pass. Pass, run, pass. Run, run, pass. As an example.<br>  <br>  The strategic commitment to running the ball allows you to control the tempo, keep the clock running, and keep your defense rested while scoring points. If the strategy succeeds, then you make many offenses become one dimensional by the fourth quarter of play, which gives the edge to a defense that can wear down the pass blockers and wear out the pass receivers. And that's even more important as the cold weather descends on the Midwest.<br>  <br>  Simply my inexpert opinion.|`|ce73ff33ebc0f03c56798009b3bafb8daa	Brady Quinn is awful. He was exposed as a fraud in both bowl games he played in at Notre Dame. He first got his teeth kicked in by Ohio State and his brother-in-law, unfrozen caveman football player, A.J. Hawk.

rM5kMMYoaa	The problem is you feel that you can't do any better. If you think you can't, well then you won't be able to.<br>  <br>  Last year as a freshman, I was so determined to break 5:00 in the mile, that that was all I could think of at the time. When my first race came along, I ran 4:59. After that, I trained hard both physically and mentally. I finished that season with a 4:42. A month into the summer, I did a mile on my own, and I ran 4:28.|`|pLxEVJF8aa	Practice, practice, practice! :P<br>  <br>  That's the only answer really. Try jogging every day if possible, but not so much you're in pain. Then, maybe every 2 days, run until you're aching with pain and rest for 2 whole days, before running again until you ache with pain, and repeat. Also, cut back on fatty foods or fizzy drinks and smoking (I doubt you do, but still, this can make your tired quicker).<br>  <br>  Also, 3 hours before you run, eat something like a big plate of Spaghetti (or any pasta). It should take about 3 hours until it starts burning off as energy. Don't eat before you run, or you'll feel bloated.|`|WnAYZtLuaa	well as a 8th grader for me i ran a 5:29 for the 1mile and i broke the 8th grade record..then when i got to high school as a freshman i train ALOT and ran CROSS Country in the fall. so by the time track came i ran a 4:45...now im a sophmore and i just finished XC....so i suggest that you run XC if u have it at your school, and run everyday after school, before school, and on the WEEKENDS....that the best i can tell you!!! DONT GIVE UP!!! enjoy running|`|BcJN6YQOaa	you asked this question yesterday and already had a best answer, go with what they said.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	if u have reached a point where u cant pass, then u might be stuck at that spot for the season. it would be extremely difficult for u to drop all the way to a 4:53 in a short amount of time. just push pass the pain. just remember, nothing goes wrong. nothing can go wrong. u arent going to die. "pain is temporary. pride is forever."|`|l3Wq57gsaa	you are probably at a plateau, much like in weight lifting. there are pretty much two possibilities, either you have to push past the plateau and then make your gains. Or maybe you have just hit your max, every person has a spot in any physical activity (especially running and lifting) that they simply cannot get much better because of physical limitations. It is a decision only you can make and take some time to make it because if you do think you can push more and you are at your max you have a greater risk of injury|`|GIVarsPnaa	Keep running hard and long consistently and eventually it will pay off. Its going to be punishing work to break a 5min mile but just keep trying. You have another 2 years to beat the record so that's plenty of time to catch up.

cRqwANvlaa	Slow paced wrestling.

It has nothing to do with success or fans.    Also, Art Rooney has specifically said that he didn't want to hear the Steelers called that. His words: "We didn't want that... We're Pittsburgh's team. We feel strongly about that."|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I understand your enthusiasm and I am with you on that. Scanner's  1 team is the Stillers I was born and raised watching them.

I'm not rooting for the Steelers or the Cowboys no matter what happens.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No. "Americas Team" is a nickname for the Cowboys... nothing more. Only the Cowboys fans actually believe that the Cowboys are "America's team"... There is no team that is "America's Team".|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I remember when the 49ers were trying to sell themselves that way, too.  Today, and especially this week, it's hard to argue with the Steelers being America's team.  I was rooting for the Cardinals because a)they were underdogs whom had never been to the Big Game, and b) they were born in Chicago, and so was I!    Anyhow, congrats to the Steelers and I hope someone else gets to win next year, someone who never has.|`|jLOCqhckaa	The tittle of Americas Team is stupid! Really stupid don't taint your Vin Lombardi trophy with such a stupid slang. And you call yourself a Steeler fan? And Cowboys...SUCK!!!!!!!|`|OlbasHyRaa	who really gives a crap for that dumb title of "americas team"??? let them Crygirls keep that name, it means nothing at all. Plus, the Steelers can now brag their the first ones with 6 superbowl wins and NOT any other team. So I am happy Steelers did it and believe me, they dont care about a stupid title "americas team", they are damn proud to be the first with 6 championships and I am very happy they are because if it wouldve been Dallas, the cockiness wouldve been worse.
tivIxrX0aa	always wear gloves. in one on ones, try and make yourself look as big as possible, and come out as quick as you can. dont commit yourself too early in one on ones, stay on your feet and try to put off the striker. most saves will be reaction saves: if your not comfortable catching it be happy to just tip i wide, dont try something your not comfortable with|`|ZaIcQC3Gaa	always wear gloves they will make you more confident (and wont hurt your hands) Just play smart a goalies job is to do anything (within the rules) to keep the other team from scoring. when one on one always make urself big and if you can never let someone roll the ball under you. Its a much more difficult for someone to chip you or go around you. And dont get down on urself usually in a one on one situation the striker is expected to score

WpqwaqcQaa	if you want to get stronger you do less repetitions with increasing weight.    if you want definition you do more sets with easier or lower weights.    like instead of 2 sets of 10 you do 2 sets of 12 to 15    but don't bounce and never swing.|`|huto12P3aa	It is better to do the harder excercises.

Optimize Your Lifting    Building more muscle mass will require more force in lifting. What I mean by that is the heavier the weight is, as well as how fast you push it, creates force. This force will in turn build more muscle.    2. Use Dumbbells    Avoid using the machines and stick to the basics in your muscle building work outs. Dumbbells are the best due to their increased range of motion. They allow you to work many different muscles during your training.    3. Cut Out Any Aerobics    While aerobics are great for cardio, they won't help in building muscles. In fact, they interfere with muscle building and burn glycogen.    4. Eat Meat And Fish    Be sure to eat lean red meats and fish. Such as, salmon that contains high amounts of Omega-3. The proteins in meat will enhance and create added muscle growth. The more the better!    5. Add Supplements To Your Diet    In order to get the most out of your muscle fitness workouts, add supplements like glutamine and creatine. If you have a low level of glutamine it will only prevent optimal muscle growth. By adding supplements such as glutamine you will encourage more growth.    6. Take It To The Max    Another solution to how to build muscle mass is to train heavy and push yourself. Instead of 3 sets of 6 reps with 35 pound curls, push it to 50 pounds and do 1 set of 10. The point is to push yourself until you can no longer move the muscle.    7. Rest    I can't stress the importance of this enough. There are many bodybuilders who fail to build muscle mass fast because they over train. They never give their body a chance to recover. By giving your body the rest it needs, you will be able to restore glycogen levels and allow your muscles to return to optimum levels.    These are only a few tips that can help in knowing how to build muscle mass. Put them into your muscle fitness workouts and you should begin seeing results|`|r1fb8t25aa	easier and more....protein|`|mFIthT2Jaa	If you wanna bulk up the rule is less reps and more weight, whilst if you looking for slender definition it's less weight and more reps...

The guy has been a beast!  I don't think it is even close right now!    Defensive Player of the Year - Dwight Howard    I don't think anyone else really stands out at the mo - especially with how the NBA isn't really a defensive-minded league anymore.  Howard leads the league in rebounds and blocks, and also hasn't been getting enough credit for the amount of shots he has been changing this season.    Rookie of the Year - Derrick Rose or OJ Mayo    There's a lot of candidates here really, but Rose and Mayo stand out to me.  Mayo has been a consistent scorer and a threat to go off night after night. Rose has been better this season than I originally thought he would be.  There are a lot of other rooks that could jump in and take it though - deep draft this season!    Coach of the Year - Stan Van Gundy    Van Gundy has always been an underrated coach from his years in Miami.  He has a great system, and is winning without a true starting power forward by using Lewis and Turkoglu in the frontcourt.  If Nelson can hurry back, they could have the leagues best record by April    Most Improved - Danny Granger    The guy is putting up huge numbers, works hard at both ends of the floor and is now the undisputed leader of a young talented Pacers team.  He's averaging 26pts per game, and is a very underrated defender.  He's also been a factor in clutch situations throughout the season.|`|fPMmN2p5aa	As of today...    MVP = Lebron.  He's playing great AND he has his team playing great.  I bet the Celtics are afraid to play the Cavs at this point in a playoff series.  They may even pull a trade to stock up.    Defense MVP = Dwight.  He grabs over 9 defensive rpg AND will get you a little over 3 bpg.  Camby's numbers are close but his team suck.    Rookie  = Rose.  An I am not just saying this because I am a Bulls fan.  He gets the edge over Mayo and if Mayo doesn't watch out, Brook Lopez will take his runner up spot.    Coach = Mike Brown (Cavs).  He has been able to utilize Delonte and Ben Wallace as ROLE players to Lebron and that's impressive to me.    MIP = Nene!!!  This dude came back from a torn ACL in 2005 and testicular cancer last year, yet he is putting up great numbers and has improved tremendously.       Now all this could change in 1 month, depending on consistency.  But those are my votes at this point in the season.|`|GswnLKtQaa	D-Wade for Defensive MVP!    1st in scoring  1st in FG% among Guards  top 3 in Steals 2.2 pg  top 10 assist 7 pg  Leads the league in blocks (among guards)    most improve player - Harris from NJ (why did dallas trade him?)    rookie of the year - OJ Mayo (scoring machine)    sixth man - between jason terry of lamar odom (I'll take Odom because he's on a winning team.     coach of the year - Van Gandy of Magic (Magic are title contenders once again)|`|25ymUKdraa	MVP: lebron james  Defensive player: dwight howard  roy: oj mayo  coach: mike brown or stan van gundy  improved player: j.nelson or d. harris

f1ZXKCGFaa	Yes, it's true. The German Federal Republic is founded on the right of "resistance" of the people as a result of the Second World War. If there was the possibility of established a dictatorship, the people have the right to the use of weapons. All this was set after the trial in Nuremberg.   I know because I'm Italian and sometimes I have to go to germany for a few races Trap shooting and my German friend told me of this particular right of the people.

And Miller had a lot more great postseason moments as well.<br>  <br>  Allen was better at putting the ball on the floor and getting to the basket.  And he was probably a better defensive player than Miller was. <br>  <br>  Allen was also far more athletic....but that's not what winning is all about.<br>  <br>  If it comes down to one game that you HAVE to win, go with Reggie every time .<br>  <br>  Miller was a true leader of his team...Allen is a fine supporting player, but he could never single-handedly carry a team the way Miller could. Allen is a lot like Clyde Drexler in that sense.... extremely athletic, but never one to singlehandedly lead his team to the promised land...he needed a lot of help.|`|b6715aca25e2e5d167208d3241299021aa	This one is tough, because now that Ray Allen won a Championship everything seems so hazy.

Op1WIwyPaa	Just like the last people said. Don't become a poser.    I think you should reconsider wanting to look like a surfer. Being a "surfer" is what happens when you start surfing. You can't buy it. The surfer way of life is about the atmosphere and outlook on life. Don't try to be someone who you are not. If you want to be a surfer than start surfing.    The Surfboard Man  http://www.thesurfboardman.com|`|4veNeNU6aa	This has nothing to do with surfing.  Just because you wear a certain brand of clothes or wear your hair a certain way, doesn't make you a surfer.  People like you seriously make me sick.|`|r1FX4xfMaa	don't just try to look like a surfer just because you live by a beach. if you do, you will be a poser. if you want to look like a surfer, get some lessons and start surfing|`|xhPKkkELaa	The other three guys are right. You want a "surfy" style, start surfing, because how you dress has nothing to do with being "surfy". I'm fat and 56, and I dress like other old guys, and I surf. So, I guess that makes a pair of jeans, a plain colored oxford shirt and sneakers is "surfy". Oh, and I lived by the beach for almost 12 years, and I still didn't change the way I dressed.    Dress how you like, however makes you feel good about yourself, and feel comfortable (and I imagine attracting guys is one of your reasonable considerations). But don't dress like a phony surfer. It is a huge turn off, and people very quickly see through phonies.|`|PBuYKm8Aaa	Too look the part:  Sandy blond hair  kaki shorts  rainbow fip-flops  knee length shorts  girls swim trunks  anything Roxy, ronjon, billabong, rip curl, etc,.  Awesome shades  Tank tops  shell necklaces    All easily accessible at Pac Sun|`|XX2MotEmaa	here are my "guidelines"    1.) get a board  2.) start learning how to surf. nothing's worse than a poser.  3.) don't try hard. let it come naturally.  4.) don't think that if your a surfer you look, walk, talk, and act a certain way. My dad is 56 years old and is one of the top master Senior Longboarders in the country and he works @ harris. I have 3 nssa titles under my belt and if you met me you would have no idea.  5.) Don't get too caught up in the surfer boys either. I'm 16 and i dated one of my best friends for 4 months. They think they're god walking on water. When he got his 10th nssa title all he would do is brag.  6.) DON'T BRAG!!  7.) Go with the flow  8.) Don't get centered on it. Use it as a relaxation tool. But if you want to get into competative surfing, after you've learned some cool tricks, use it a chance to feel good if you're feeling lousy.  9.) bing extra clothes, shoes, towels, sunscreen, wax(do not forget the wax!!!), a board if you ever surf tallows, and a cell phone charger.  10.) Have fun and be diverse. Try not to fit your self into that "surfer category"|`|yRPYuJhsaa	start surfing|`|2ljcpLXEaa	You don't need any shops, just get in the water every day, let the salt do the work for you.

I guess foxsports, cbssportsline an espn having it on their pages was made up too.  No bad calls happened I guess.

Sure they were calling the game tight and there was a lot of penalties, but they were going both ways. Whenever I played sports, that is all I wanted from the refs was to call a fair game both ways. And as for other refs, you have to remember that they dont get to watch the plays like we do. They dont get to watch a cameraman follow the ball for them. And they dont get to watch replays after every big play right away like they usually show on TV. People need to give the refs a break. They will make bad calls every now and then and people will always be biased for there team.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Bad season for the refs. The Super Bowl was a reflection of the entire season. You are correct.|`|VXXMsvkiaa	Oh yeah...the refs need to get some glasses because at the end of the superbowl when that "fumble" happened, his arm was obviously going forward.  A la Tom Brady and the tuck rule, why did they not review this and overturn it?  The refs seriously sucked it up this year.  Started with Hochuli, and ended with a missed review that should have been reviewed.|`|0WPdeB4Paa	I think there are so many rules, it has become a difficult game to officiate.  There is so much tv coverage, so many angles, that it is possible to find fault in nearly every play.  We expect these guys to be super-human.  To be as good as technology, but in the end, they are only people.  In the old days, you didn't have replays and booth-reviews.  If the call was not good, you just lived with it.  Now it takes 5 seconds to run a play and we spend 2-3 minutes dissecting and analyzing what occurred.  While intentions are good, technology will not remove the human element of the game and I would prefer going back to less technology.  If the call is bad, live with it.|`|i5KzKBYZaa	the refs suck every year. and for some reason the refs love he steelers i mean everyone seen how bad super bowl 40 was ben never got in that endzone. and then this year they cheated the cardinals out of 30 yards on back to back plays because they were in love with santonio holmes. i hate the steelers and refs in general|`|jhNUuz0maa	The refs don't get all the calls correct, that is a given. The last play should have been reviewed, but I don't think it would have changed the outcome. Yes, there would have been one more play, and I could say the Steelers would have knocked down any ball thrown, or the play would have been dead, but then others could say the opposite. It is what it is. If the refs were all for the Steelers, a lot of the calls in the beginning wouldn't have been made. The first TD would have been TD and not overturned. The Cardinals challenges went the other way both times, so you can't say the refs were for the Steelers. Well, you can, but you would be wrong.|`|NzGZbCRQaa	Jake S,    The play was reviewed during the commercial break and easily determined to be correctly called as a fumble.

Also, the stuff you do in team practice will make you better.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	how about googling it?      i hate these questions.|`|jLOCqhckaa	Practice...hard...and brutal.Don't ever stop. And when it's over you'll be stronger. Try getting a Gym Membership.
WrDGhduxaa	Your stride may seem small, and not actually be short.  Speed is your stride length and the number of strides you take, so if you increase the length and reduce the number of strides you are slower not faster.  Your foot should contact the ground only slightly in front of your center of gravity, coming rearward in a pawing motion at the same rate you are moving forward.  The stride is lengthened behind  you not in front.  It takes strength to increase the stride because it is pushing off that increases the length.  If you over stride and the foot lands in front you are breaking your forward motion until your center of gravity passes over the foot.  Try to relax the stride length changes as the speed changes.|`|xtgA7Ltaaa	First you should check with  fitness professional to make sure that is the problem.  That being said, the easiest, and probably the safest, way is to work on a treadmill.  First get to your normal running pace and stride length, then without increasing your pace-count/minute, gradually increase the treadmill speed and concentrate on keeping up by lengthening your stride.  Do this gradually and it should help you to increase you stride on a normal run.  Again, go to a gym or the YMCA and have someone check you running stride to make sure this is really the problem.    Good luck, and keep running.

u6ZMGFUDaa	well i can say much for gail kim but Christian has been the spot light on tna for most of the time. there has to be some reason he went back to wwe. (it think cuz of money) any way right now, ecw only has 2 good wrestlers. so if he stays on ecw he might get to the top fast|`|TefoBPyyaa	r u  nsane she took on a 250 pound women that just has to backfist sum of the tna stars to knock them out and she won the first tna knockout title from the 250 pound women  look her up on wikipedia and you will figure out what she really has accomplished  and 2day was her bday      u can also c abyss w/out his mask if u look up chris parks on wikipedia|`|PLyhhDFNaa	gail kim have really improved her game because she was given a shot at the top in tna|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, Gail Kim has improve a lot from the her early days of the WWE. She is bring a lot of skill from TNA.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|t1uKdzmLaa	I don't think she was used properly during her tenure with the WWE. Yes, she did have one championship run but look how fast they released her. <br>  <br>  She was barely given an opportunity to make a real name for herself in that company...but when she joined TNA...she was able to prove herself with that company and those who watched her while she was in TNA knows she is a good wrestler...so maybe that is why everyone is excited to see her return to the WWE cause they know she will make an impact in the divas division. <br>  <br>  Of course, one would say that Trish and Lita are better than her...that is cause they had longer careers in the WWE and were the cornerstones of the divas division during their times. <br>  <br>  I believe that if the WWE uses her properly this time around...she will have a better career with them the 2nd time around.
5VSAuCwiaa	No, they are not doing it intentionally. They are not even doing it. The FIA is in charge of the regulations and evaluating the incoming teams, among other things. FOM is the one in charge of the track contracts, television rights, etc. Bernie decided to not renew the contract with Indianapolis and Gilles Villeneuve because:<br>  <br>  a) The USGP advertising was being intentionally toned down by Tony George to keep it under the shadow of the Indy 500.<br>  b) Gilles Villeneuve was literally tearing apart.<br>  <br>  The FIA is very happy with the application of the USF1 team and Max has talked favorably about them.|`|02kkSw3Laa	It's not being done intentionally and it has nothing to do with the popularity of Nascar. The bottom line is that Bernie makes more money when he has races in oil rich Middle Eastern nations that actually have  less of an F1 following than N. America.<br>  <br>  Canada was axed because they were unable or unwilling to pay for the expensive costs of hosting a GP. Same with the president of Indy Tony George in the US. F1 will be back in N. America once the economy gets better IMO.|`|y3j27KMYaa	I don't think there is a conspercay at all, F1 is not popular in America, thats it, lets be honest, for the WRC, who care about rally in America, perhaps the only one will be the Subaru and Mitsubishi fanatics. The WTCC too, touring car racing is very popular in Europe, but in America ? <br>  I really hope that at lest the GP of Montreal will come back soon, one of the greatest event of the F1 season|`|ab3efd718c864b03946535d2dc7dfbfbaa	I don't know what their problem is, but if they keep it up, I am not sure anyone is going to be watching it. I know that for over 5 years Honda has been sponsoring the F1 broadcasts in Canada but now that Honda has pulled out of F1, who knows who is going to be the main sponsor.|`|5a1aa56c6591c1edf54e7a20cf077fc4aa	I believe they are..What market are all the manufacturers of F1 most interested in getting their cars sold?  AMERICA!!!! so if thats the number one market for all the manufacturers in F1 why isn't their a race here anymore?  BUT hopefully it will change now that the USA has a formula1 team that IS going to race in 2010!|`|AA10349169	Well, I know the FIA has always hated us, but they should be back at Indy soon|`|1c05cd87b278063482a9135943e3cdeeaa	with f1 they realised that there was no way that they could compete with NASCAR and I presume that is the case with the WRC. I don`t think it`s a case of the FIA "dissing" North America, it's just that they have markets like the middle east where there is no competition with f1
OfNTLq3Qaa	First you are right they should leave but ignore them, they don't matter.<br>  Second: Not all wrestling fans are fans of the WWE. <br>  You should just enjoy the fact that you are a fan.|`|FEViNlQMaa	It's a test whether we will get mad or pissed and we must maintain our cool despite this insults|`|gVlTlpb2aa	just report them|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I agree it is very annoying,and BeeRad if you don't like it don't watch it and shut up really we don't care what you think,we obviously like it you don't,then don't post questions here!|`|9Us6XYg8aa	1-not fake.<br>  2-its scripted.<br>  3-The moves are real though.<br>  4-but the matches are stages.<br>  5-I agree it IS annoying.<br>  6-and rude.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Because they have nothing better to do than try annoy peoplewith their stupid and disrespectful remarks if they keep aying its fake why do they keep coming on here making fools of themselves|`|hApu3H5Jaa	They need something to look down on. They think we care, they also think that posting something on the internet can make a world of difference. What they don't realize is how pathetic they look, different types of people have to live with this everyday, the people who troll message boards (BeeRad or whatever that guys name was) are disgusted with themselves so they need something to look down upon, something to make them feel better, when all it does is make them look even more pitiful.|`|ETkqlgqwaa	IDK. No it's not fake. It's scripted. Story lines are fake. It's acting, but it's entertainment. Sure punch by punch, they try not to hit each other, and possibly miss, but you can't fake some of that stuff. They're obviously getting injured, and tell me how to fake Jeff Hardy's dive onto Randy Orton off the set over 30 feet high. Edge spearing Foley at WM 22 onto a flaming table.

6NokYZ2Xaa	well first off, what you're already doing sounds fantastic. you're off to a great start with him.<br>  <br>  Although you're going to use him as a barrel horse, i'd take him on a trail ride or just randomly riding arround the arena on him. Not every time you ride him has to be a barrel racing work out. If you push it too hard, he'll resent it and wont be as willing to perform when the time comes. <br>  <br>  As for getting im into the left lead, ride him arround the arena (either in figure eights or in circles, it's you're choice) and force him into it. do NOT let him refuse it. if he gets away with it once, he'll try it every time you ride and will only cause more problems. <br>  <br>  Always remember: don't get frustrated with him easily, he's just begining. & HAVE FUN!!<br>  <br>  --Good luck with you're new horse & barrel racing!|`|1JqACKIdaa	My brother trains barrel horses and I sat 2nd in the state my high school year.   I love it!  anyways, maybe you should try a lighter bit on him, it sounds like that bit is to heavy for him.  Maybe just an O ring could be used.  The figure 8 thing I don't like at all and my brother doesn't use that technique either.  I would work plenty circle with him to get him adjusted to the left lead and use your leg ques as you go. Once you have him in the lead work a few more then stop and start over again. Ride him ever day to show him who is boss!  Good luck!

119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	AR magazines are in fact universal, in the sense that as long as you buy the ones that match the caliber for your rifle.

ptQ5SkPVaa	Actually you are right.Some people don't like the Warrior because of his honesty. He did get out before suffering any major injury. I have heard that he is really a great guy. I don't know why people hate him.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	When people in the wrestling circle say he self-destructed is not how is doing now, not the money he made, or anything of that nature, but what happened to him career-wise.  WWF was all set to put tons of money & the entire company as a whole behind the Ultimate Warrior.  He was being billed & pushed to become the next Hulk Hogan, the next icon to literally carry the industry on his shoulders.  Kids loved him, fans dressed like him, girls packed arenas to see him.  At WM7, he was given the first honor of being the only wrestler to CLEANLY PIN Hogan in the center of the ring for the World title.  If you have the dvd, watch the end of the match & look not just at the pin, but the celebration after, the fireworks, Hogan handing him the title, I mean REALLY look at it.  That was Hogan & the WWF giving Warrior the ball & saying "run with it, you're the quarterback now..".  In the NWA, this was tried with Lex Luger when he first came up from FLorida CHampionship Wrestling, same with Sid Vicious when he came from World Class.  It failed miserably.  With Randy Savage, it just didn't take, even with Elizabeth at his side.  Kerry Von Erich, the Modern Day Warrior was never truly given a chance, then his death really rocked everyone.  Most recently, Brock Lesnar was next up, but he left to go to UFC due to not liking wrestling schedule on the road.  THe closest anyone has come has been John Cena, but he doesn't have what is needed to dominate & be liked by the fans as a whole.  Fans cheer for Cena, then they boo him, who knows why..  With Warrior though, it was all there in his hands & he simply gave it away.  He alienated himself from the other wrestlers, there were accidents that he was responsible for during matches, most notably nearly breaking Lanny Poffo's neck with a clothesline.  Then, there was the "Career-Ending" match he had with Macho "King" Randy Savage.  Savage was out on his feet after trying to jump off the top rope onto Warrior on the outside.  Warrior moved & Randy hit jaw first on the gaurd rail, fracturing his lower mandible & bringing on a concussion that would sideline him for months.  But, Warrior did not just roll him in & pin him, he went on to hit Randy with two shoulder-breakers before splashing him & pinning him for the win.  This caused many in the locker room to turn against Warrior as he took advantage of an injured opponent (..& the injury was not a work or anything, Randy was out for 4-6 months after that event).  He was late to events that WWF was sponsoring, there was an incident with a kid during a March of Dimes show that was a public relations disaster for Warrior & the WWF(the kid thought Warrior was Randy Savage & an argument with officials got a little heated..).  After all of that, his departure from WWE was not on the best of terms & no one knew what happened for some time.  Then, there was the final straw with the WCW-situation & the NWO storyline.  Eric Bischoff paid Warrior a huge sum to get him to face Hogan at a ppv. WWE refused to let Warrior out of the clause of using his name, they really did not want to let him wrestle was the underlying theme.  Warrior cut "Ultimate" out of his name & went on with the match, thus allowing Hogan to finally defeat the only person that had beaten him that he had never beaten..<br>  <br>  Ultimate Warrior did not self-destruct mentally or emotionally or financially, but business-career wise, he more than self-destructed, he destroyed himself & what could have been a monumental legacy..  For others who could be put in the same category, see Lex Luger, Goldberg, etc.|`|I14OzlGpaa	He may be fine now, but he wasn't fine when he was an active wrestler.

FKhY6EVAaa	Machida, even though I hate watching him|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Machida for sure.  I think Machida has a good chance of cleaning out the 205 division.  People may hate his style, but he is a smart and skilled fighter.  His unorthodox style is causing problems for other fighters.  I think this will continue.|`|36u3Ml0kaa	I love GSP but Machida is better at karate.  He is better in my opinion of what karate should be because he uses it very defensively and tactically.|`|73nTYgdraa	Both started out as Karat users, but GSP evolved into a more well rounded fighter, The Ultimate Fighter.  Machida sticks to Karat as possibly his main style, along with Jiu Jitsu.  Answer is Machida.|`|gBO908P6aa	Machida's movements, prowess and wit puts him above GSP as the better karateka.  His fighting methods are one of a kind because he fights as if he was in a point sparring match with another karateka - and yet he scores!  Machida's stance is uniquely karate-ish while GSP adopts the common MMA ready stance.  Plus he's the only one I've seen who actually uses karate leg and foot sweeps and pulls them off.    This frustrates opponents into committing even more blunders.  I know 50% of my hair is gone every time I watch Machida because he's just so frustratingly adept at messing with you.    Oh and also because Machida's half-Japanese.  Nothing against French-Canadians, but I gotta go with the Japanese dude when it comes to Karate.|`|9f53e05cc8ec82fa794d70c7c68ae1d8aa	Machida would beat GSP on the feet, so Machida.    Yeah, he ran away really fast after leaving Thiago in a coma at UFC 94.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	GSP used to use his karate more, now he concentrates more on his wrestling and GNP. Machida is the better Kareteka|`|3BGJETHYaa	Machida.  Look at his hit percentages.  He might not fight with the one-super-hit ideal that some karateka, but his technical skills are still more or less flawless.    EDIT:  He doesn't run away.  He controls distance, which is very different.  However, when your opponents always come forwards, it looks like mostly running away.  He's been known to rush in and apply knees to opponents who do stop coming forwards.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Machida. I think he is a bit more decorated than GSP. And he is so good at it that he is yet to loose a single round in MMA!
NzrTgpe4aa	They believe in Brooklyn they would get more fans. Partly because most of the people who watch their fans are from the New York area, and because of low attendance. It will cost them, but if they can get money from fans who actually come to watch their games, it might not be a bad idea and if it works it will be a smart move by Nets management|`|BgKueDyMaa	I think it is because..<br>  <br>  They realise that they are crap ? Maybe ?<br>  Haha
tY3rZSsiaa	do you believe that one game with 61 points, 0 rebounds and 3 assists automatically makes you the best player in the league?  lebron hasnt scored that much this year and probably wont, but lebron is in the same boat kobe is now without bynum, which is carryign his team.  from what ive seen this year, lebron has done that and the cavs have one of the top records in the league and tied at the loss column with the best teams in the league.  wade doesnt get my vote because hes nto carrying his team to a good record so far.  you can even argue that kobe is a better buzzer beater player, and yea he is the better buzzer beater than lebron.  lebron has had as many maybe more games in his short career where he has had what eventually ends up as the winning score or tieing score.  well see what kobe can do without bynum and see if he can carry the lakers as well as lebron has been doing with the cavs, then you can make an argument that kobe is better than lebron this year.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Kobe played a great game. 61 points on 19/31 shooting 20/20 ft's on 36 minutes.    ok but haters will be haters, because they are jealous Kobe achieve another record. I already heard kobe had no rebound in the game (I think because gasol, odom and ariza grab em' all they all combined with 34 rebounds) some say kobe is a ball hog which is a lame excuse when a player is shooting the lights out why would he stop?. And Kobe had 3 assist. Great night for Kobe.|`|GwawzO5Faa	What can I come up with?  Wade's and James's numbers are better than Kobe's across the board.  http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/stats/bycate...    Kobe is still Kobe but this year Wade and James are simply better.    Kobe scoring 61 against Mike D'Antoni's system and the Knicks isn't really that surprising.|`|AA11828439	Dude, Haters are losers. Why are you feeding them? This is what they live for. Deny them the pleasure.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It truly amazes me what these clowns come up with. On another message board some joker said he didnt get one rebound, LOL. So help me, Kobe could stop a bullet for the President and these a-s-s clowns would find something wrong with it, LMFAO. Its times like this when the haters truly expose themselves for the clueless idiots that they are.|`|98wFqBwSaa	We already went over this bro.  No one hates Kobme, we hate the Lakers Fan Boys who ask dumb questions like this one.|`|AA10425091	They will come up with something crazy.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	its not that people hate kobe, people just cant play like him so they have to devalue a player like his caliber.|`|kjJkQpzPaa	He scored on the KNICKS, wow  No, when he can win a championship without Shaq, let me know|`|56Mb4BXIaa	yea on excuse can be that he scored against the knicks. "big deal"|`|AA10188905	I didnt see Shaq win a championship without an amazing SG King and wait until this year. Lakers will win if Bynum can get healthy. Kobe is the best player in the league flat out. This game wouldnt even be that big of a deal if it wasnt at MSG. That should show you how great of a player he is though.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	I enjoy the hate, it reminds us of just how good Kobe is... we don't see post like this about Bruce Bowen! LOL...    61 pts in 30 something mins is amazing and the world was a witness.. forget the fact he didn't have any rebounds. He didn't need to, his shots were hitting bottom. :) Plus Pau and Lamar were all over that. They had 14 a piece. He had to share the wealth somewhere, right?     He was in a zone, even the Knicks saw it. And for those that say it was only the Knicks? How many people have done what Kobe has? Oh, that's right? NONE!!! Kobe owns that record!|`|5ANmjtLOaa	Kobe haters cry, Kobe breaks another record!    so what it's the knick! well tell me when was the last time someone drop 61 vs the knicks!|`|0ytjj1EGaa	He is The Best      the 61 pts is Just A PROOF NOT A REASON|`|Pa0014qhaa	Hey Mr. T,     Kobe haters say, "They pity the fool who writes stupid questions on Yahoo Answers."|`|qyAlUIKtaa	ok i was a kobe hater but i realized that he has skill and lebron james is rigt there two i like them both but kobe still has his past and lebron is much younger only time will tell|`|aV9epMGVaa	ok so lebron drops 40 on the knicks and its a national treasure and kobe drops 61 and ppl still complain.. kobe was the golden child of the nba in the late 90's early 2000's and he made a mistake..and becuz he is so good ppl wont let it go..they try to do anything they can to water down kobes greatness|`|c64b55c57d1c97df1d0f7cdd4b322789aa	People don't hate Kobe cuz he's good at bball, they hate him because he was accused of rape and if thats not true he at least cheated on his wife. So that 61 doesn't mean dog sh1t to me the guys a douche bag.
qbPbvLuLaa	I still say these rankings don't matter. I don't care if chivas is on top I'm not going to change my mind about the rankings and now all of a sudden I think their important.|`|7Xridrxaaa	stupid rankings! I respect chivas for everything they are but the rankings were stupid.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Fake  Vergara probably paid off the people who made that ranking|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	its you who give Chivistas a bad name...    To Alberto and Hatecrew and all others, in behalf of real Chivistas I apologize of what this lil kid just posted.    rankings really dont matter.      plus this is old news, it was posted yesterday already...by me.    See already posted: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...    and to Hatecrew I responded on my question to what u said...just getting things cleared man.|`|MMTZuSY8aa	Keep dreaming.|`|ed0ySnCmaa	They are on something.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	yea ok...but if you check america is best in overall this is just for current times|`|8zgFyfibaa	Well well well look at this lil boy cussing. You want me to tell your mommy so she can ground you some more. Hahahahaha      I thought chivas dint care about those statistics because they are based on votes.but because chivas has surpassed america now you believe it. I can remember when america was number 38 and chivas were talking shet saying they don't believe in that. Oh well I can care less shet at least were on the list. I can say chivas are doing good, cruz azul too are doing good, but atlas no mames look how bad they are doing. Oh well     Congrats to chivas I can respect and admit they are starting thi season good I'm not gonna hate because I can recognize you chivas are doing better than america at the moment.    Pero puro 100% azulcrema estoy contigo america en las buenas I en las malas.    Edit@f carolina h I disagree with you we can say we passed the dutch and scottish league why, well because in scotland there's only two teams in scotland that are known (celtic,rangers), in the dutch well I can say we are in the same level.     Remember two mexican clubs have gone to the world club cup (america,pachuca) no scottish team or dutch team has ever played in there.     Mexico deserves to be there we are the best league in north america and the concacaf.     But I agree with you that honduran league should be like the 60th place.         Mexican teams have played european teams and have won and lost but we played real good agaisnt them.      Edit:hatecre maggot I agree with you I also said the same thing. When america was higher than chivas.all the chivas  said that those rankings were bullshet. Now that they are higher then america and cruz they believe in the list.    Also, when galindo was almost signing to america. Chivas fans were saying no its a mistake he should stay in europe.but now since he came to chivas they say its good he's back in mexico. Hypocrites like you say.     Personally I say toluca and cruz azul should be higher than chivas because cruz azul went to 2 finals in the same year and toluca was campeon in the apertura.|`|atff6gP2aa	i bet you if any other mexican team was ranked that high you wouldnt believe it you would be saying the ranks are dumb.|`|3uOv4gOYaa	Chivaz, chivaz, chivaz, chivaz, chivaz    Puro Mexico y puro chivitazzzzzzzz Pu**s|`|kPbou3Vdaa	Chivas can suck my big, 10 inch size dick.|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	Who gives a **** about those rankings.

AA10425091	you got mad skills, I think you should be the coach and help those less fortunate than you.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Nice skills man, I think you should play SF position. You could over power and be a quick SF and play very well in wing because you have the speed and can dribble, shoot (your Shooting-A mean your a shooting threath from the outside so play in the wing position). since you don't like to post up I think that PF is not the position for you. Good Luck man hope this helps.|`|kjJkQpzPaa	Damn, that's impressive!!  Personally, with your dribbling, speed and height I would have you play the point.|`|AA10188905	If all of what you said here is true, not doubting you im just saying, then I would say you have a good shot at JV especially if 2 of the sophmores are going to varsity. In my experience if a junior doesnt make varsity after 3 years of playing, they will more often stop playing, although that is just my experience. So maybe you could be a starter for JV. Who knows, if you work hard maybe you could be a varsity bench player. Anyway, I would say that you would probably be best at SF or maybe SG based on the info you gave above. But good luck and just work hard.|`|qyAlUIKtaa	wow but i bet you are over exaggerating a bit|`|AukGqk17aa	for me you should play SG/SF    NICE stats    FOR the team     the position the Cotch will put U

Chelsea will come good this year.|`|5V5L9DoBaa	only the consequences have been withdrawn, which is the match ban.    Thats like withdrawing goals which are offside/illegally scored post-match, or adding goals which should have been goals and disallowed unfairly.    Its not gonna happen or else each match would be played 3-4 times. There should be a video ref imho so referees can be assisted by others watching from different angles and close up and off the ball incidents and tell the ref through an earpiece. There would be much less errors|`|tbgaqgQyaa	em nice try  no|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Unfortunately football doesn't go that way.

Sugar Ray Robinson - I don't really think there is any argument over Robinson so no need to go into detail.    2. Henry Armstrong  - Armstrong was a non stop power puncher who could move and went for the knockout every time out, He held titles in 3 weight divisions Featherweight, lightweight and Welterweight in a time when there was no super or Jr divisions. In one year he fought 27 times and scored 26 knockouts. His final record was 149 wins with only 21 defeats and he knocked out over 100 men. Today guys can easily capture titles in 3 or 4 weight divisions because there is 16 weight divisions when there were only 8 in Armstrong's time.    3. Sugar Ray Leonard -  Before he even turned pro he held 3 National Golden Glove titles, 2 AAU championships,the pan American games crown, and in 1976 he won the gold at the Olympics. As a pro he has wins over other greats Duran, Hagler, Hearns, Benetiz his only loss before retirement was too Roberto Duran who he made quit in the rematch less then a year later dominating Duran from round 1 to 8. Towards the end of his career he was fighting with limited sight in his left eye. He captured titles in 5 weight divisions from Welterweight to Light Heavyweight.    4. Archie Moore was on of the craftiest boxers in history, he was the originator of the in ring chess match, a thinking mans boxer who was slick, fast and was said to have "sneaky" power, he was a small man who jumped to Heavyweight and knocked down Rocky Marciano. His career spanned 23 years and he finished with a record of 185 wins  22 losses with 130 KO's. He also trained a young Ali for a short time.    5. Roy Jones Jr - Forget about once he he lost his youth and agility and became normal, but when he was in his prime he was unbeatable, he never used a jab to dominate the Middleweight and Lightheavyweight division like no one in history has, he jumped up to heavyweight and embarrassed John Ruiz. It was not untill he dropped back down in weight that he lost his legs and became hittable. Say what you will about his chin, in his prime you couldn't hit it. He dominated a prime Bernard Hopkins with a broken hand and easily outpointed James Toney.|`|Vh48WbW8aa	1 Sugar ray Robinson  2 ALI  3 Larry Holmes  4 Julio Cesar Chavez   5 Mike Tyson|`|6QhACK70aa	LASZLO PAPP EASILY CAUSE HE WAS JUST UNBEATABLE   CARLOS MONZON  RICARDO LOPEZ  EVANDER HOLYFIELD (HIS HEART IS BIGGER THAN MOON)  ROBERTO DURAN/MARCEL CERDAN   (ONLY CAUSE THEY BOTH UNDERRATED)|`|dh48AkbCaa	sugar ray robinson  henry armstrong  benny leonard  willie pep  muhammad ali    honourable mention to:  roberto duran  carlos zarate  salvador sanchez  marvin hagler  carlos monzon  khaosai galaxy  jimmy wilde  joe louis  jack johnson  ezzard charles  gene tunney  stanley ketchel  ray leonard  julio cesar chavez  roy jones jr  harry greb  ricardo lopez|`|Limt9t5Qaa	1.

Fought everyone and usually beat everyone even if it took a second fight.    Jack Johnson: The first black heavyweight champ beat everyone and had to deal with being hated for his race. He had great speed and defnsive skills and power.    Muhammad Ali: Beat the unbeatable Sonny Liston. Didn't lose his title in the ring, had it taken away from him. Came back and beat the unbeatable George Foreman. Like Johnson, known for his speed and defense but had surprising power.    Marvin Hagler: Unheralded and unrecognized as he was never in the Olympics. As tough a fighter as I ever saw. Got screwed out of his title because Sugar Ray Leonard was more popular. If the fight was close after 11 rounds Hagler would take over and owned the late rounds.    Joe Louis: Held the Heavyweight title for nearly twelve years and fought everyone to do it. He beat the preceding champions (Schmeling, Sharkey, Carnera, Baer & Brddock) and the men who follwed him (Walcott and Charles).    Roberto Duran: The hardest hitting lightweight ever. Incredibly tough and intimidating. His "no mas" fight against Leonard was a shock because he was so tough, it scarred his career, but prior to that he was one of the all-time greats.    Carlos Monzon: Another great middleweight who held the title for a long time (8 years). He beat everyone and retired as champion. Greatly underrated.    Esubio Pedroza: Another forgotten man. He was bantamweight champion for about eight years. He was tough and nasty. Like Hagler, he owned rounds 12 through 15.    Larry Holmes: Maybe the greatest jab of all-time. He beat everyone until he got screwed out of his title in a decision against the more popular Michael Spinks. He was 48-0 prior to the Spinks fight. He is also notable for publicly stating that he fought for money and when he lost his title that's why he kept fighting.|`|uUMLGucwaa	ALI...TYSON..PAQUIA...FRAZIER..MARCIANO....

5xIroQjMaa	Well, I'm not too familiar with the Cardinals organization as a whole, but lets go over what their strong points and weak points are.     Pitching; The number one weakness. Even if Carpenter makes a complete recovery, that only gives them 2 really solid starters. Carpenter and Wainwright. Kyle Lohse had a fairly strong performance last year, so he's not bad, but there's still 2 big holes in the rotation. So my first priority would be to try and sign Oliver Perez or Ben Sheets, or perhaps even both. Now, the Cardinals would be missing a marquee closer, but I would try to develop one from inside the organization instead of signing one.     Infield: No need to tinker here. A very solid infield, all the way around. Molina is one of the best catchers in the league, Pujols is the best first basemen in the league, and Glaus, Greene and Kennedy are all rock solid.     Outfield: Rick Ankiel is solid, but after him the outfield gets fairly thin. This is where Pujols demands for Manny come in. You solve both your problems with a single acquisition. Sure Manny's not the best outfielder in the game (or even close to it), but he swings just about the deadliest bat either. It doesn't matter if Manny protects Pujols or Pujols protects Manny,  but either way your lineup is set. To make up for Manny's fielding deficiency, I would try to swing a trade to bring in a CF with outstanding range. Maybe take a look at Andruw Jones if he's truly lost weight and can patrol the outfield like he used to.|`|AA10188905	Go after Manny like Pujols wants to keep your best player happy. May pick up a decent pitcher as well. Thats it for me though. I think with Manny the Cards could make the playoffs. Just offer him 3 years.|`|W7BZcdynaa	St. Louis is going to suck this year      1) Chicago  2) Milwaukee  3) Cincinatti  4) Houston  5) St. Louis  6) Pittsburgh      You saw it hear 1st!|`|SEcM9EDZaa	The Cards have a surplus of outfielders and holes at 2nd and 3rd, so I'd offer either Ludwick, Schumaker and/or Duncan in a deal to acquire help at one or both of those positions. I might lowball Joe Crede to play 3rd. Then I'd bring Rasmus up and let him learn on the job in center.  I'd let Motte challenge Perez for the closer's role and try to add depth in the rotation because it is thin by NL Central standards. There isn't any real help available in the FA market, so if I couldn't make a deal for a 2nd baseman I might offer outfielders for a decent SP.|`|c6q3EERdaa	Woo!    I'd sign a 2B (which they really need) and a starter. I'd probably go with Orlando Hudson and Braden Looper. The Cards know what to expect from Looper, and Hudson is a good switch-hitting 2B.    I do not agree with signing Royce Ring and having Adam Kennedy as their starting 2B. I'm surprised the team didn't re-sign Lopez or Miles, considering they need a utility guy. I doubt they will re-unite with Scott Spiezio, but they need someone like him.

The ump didn't throw him out because the player waited to do it behind the dugout and the ump didn't see. His father chased him into the dugout and threw him against the dugout wall and started yelling at him that he was an embarrassment I pulled the father off and took him outside the dugout and told him (in a very heated way) that this is MY dugout and your son is my problem, not yours. If I don't deal with it to your expectations you can talk to him later but right now is game time and he belongs to me. I have a policy that no player should ever be reprimanded in front of his team... so the whole team's "oohhh, you got in trouble" mumble was called the Coke Walk. If you messed up that bad and I needed to "yell" at you or just tell you what you did wrong, you got a coke. All the way to the consession stand was what you did wrong and why it was wrong - all the way back to the dugout I told you how to make better and how much I believed in you. Almost everyone I have coached had to take the Coke Walk at some point. Probably 90% of the kids were in tears on the way to the snack bar - Not because of me but because they thought people in the stands hated them. The trip back was about how to focus and how much I believed in them. I never had a kid that come back from coke trip with a bad attitude. The one I mentioned before happened in the second inning and he came back to finish no hitter. It's just a game, that means it's supposed to be fun.

Sharpe and Johnson are funny, and they're not afraid to question what goes on.  Least favorite...Deion Sanders, I refuse to watch the NFL Network's pre-game and post-game shows simply because he's on there. <br>  <br>  Game analysts...Cris Collinsworth, Dan Dierdorf, and Randy Cross.  They definitely bring new things to the table and bring up things you don't necessarily see right away.  Least favorite...John Madden.  Dear God he's a joke anymore.|`|GMcdPLoIaa	Aikman is GREAT!

Hgm9qaf9aa	They had a lot of seniors in key positions, i.e. quarterback, running back, wide receiver.  Lose 7 starters on offense, 4 on defense.  So I would say unranked to start the season.  Probably go 7-5.|`|cdQryr7paa	Ranked???<br>  LOL<br>  Not in the top 25, that's for sure.

Sorry|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I dont think so thell prob battle it out for the wild card and come up short to the rays.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Personally, I hope the Mets win, but if they can't, I'd much rather see the Sox do it than the Yankees.|`|V430UrvFaa	Nothing is for sure at this point, but for sure the Red Sox will win big in the regular season but the post season is completely different. There will be many predictions of a Yankees and Red Sox ALCS, but I'd give the Red Sox a good chance to win the world series as well, they have brilliant pitching and a solid lineup.|`|io3hggzZaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... no!|`|AYiVipawaa	Red Sox. They have the best pitching: 5 excellent starters and 4 setup guys in the bullpen. They're offense will be very good, if Ortiz recovers (Youkilis, Pedroia, Bay, Drew) but not as good as the Yankees.    Yanks aren't guarenteed it, cause their pitching isn't all that. You have to remember that their pitching sucked last season, so now it's pretty good. Their hitting is also pretty good, cause they've got teix, arod (i hope he gets injured, that loser).|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Maybe but personally I hope they don't since I am a Yankees fan but I wish both teams good luck|`|nSSKixvCaa	Yeah, they are going to win a few series in the regular season.|`|icTRTBAraa	I don't know yet I think they will make it to the playoffs but the Series?|`|W7BZcdynaa	Win the AL East.

First of all, they are going to be competing in a VERY TOUGH American League East division that sees a revamped Yankees team (just acquired 3 of the top Free Agents on the market) and a young Rays team (the defending AL champions). Not to mention, the Sox seems to always have trouble when they face the Jays for some reason (kind of like the Yankees when they face the Angels). With no more Manny, everyone is wondering "How will Ortiz pan out?" While Bay and Youk are good hitters, they are NOT a Manny Ramirez type hitter. Best thing for the Sox to do is give it their all.|`|h074DM42aa	No.|`|Ng0MKmxaaa	Probably not but it could happen.
7uGMyGn2aa	its definetly possible! its clear that youreally have the determination to take the sport to the next level, as you have already begun to dismiss those who say it is not possible - thats only cause they r jealous they dont have ure drive!   you have a lot of good upcoming stars from india, so its clear that the all india tennis association will b keen to fund people who can continue the success. Im not sure who it was but there was a male playing in Wimbledon 2008 who didnt even START playing tennis until he was 17! so aslong as uve reached a decent level and put in as much work as him its still possible!  Jst look at the likes of federer who is 27 and shows no signs of stopping - u have pleanty of years ahead of u! go 4 it - u have the drive - dont let people tell u u cant - anything is possible :)|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Possible but improbable.  You should play tennis to have fun, because it is an awesome sport.  Its a great lifelong sport that should improve your health and your social life.  Do your best at it, but at 17, your chances at becoming pro are quite low.  But don't let anyone stop you from dreaming big and reaching for the stars.  Good luck!|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	do u play just for fun?ummm listen... not to be mean but there is a 0 percent chance u will become a pro, especially since ur already 17. are u willing to practice 6-7 hours a day?nah its even too late for that. i have been playing tennis for 10 years(6 years in tournaments) i am 13 years old and i practice 6 HOURS A DAY! listen, good players are already pros by the time they are 17. Jennifer Capriati, for example, was already in the TOP 10 IN THE WORLD by the time she was 15. u can play some USTA tournaments but that's about as far as u can go. im sorry, but u should have started when u wer 10(at the latest) tennis isnt as easy as u think it is TRUST ME....i JUST got sponsored by prince and i have been working my butt off 4-6 hours a day for the past 5 or 6 years. ya. thats harsh.im sorry but u becoming pro isnt gonna happen in reality, not to be mean. but thats the truth.but since im a tennis player, im harsh and im gonna tell u one last time how it is:  IM NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN, BUT LIKE ALL TENNIS PLAYERS, U GOTTA TAKE THE TRUTH AND WORK WITH WHAT U GOT.. SORRY  so in other words...ITS TOO LATE  (that is, unless ur RELE RELE good and u play tournaments and are VERY high ranked, then thats a WHOLE different story. but by the looks of it, i dont think u are)|`|DshFTbcsaa	it's possible if you are amazing at it. there is no way you could just pick up the sport now and become professional. You would have had to been playing for a while now, and not only that destroying everyone you played against. Tennis, like all other sports, requires lots of skills that takes years to develop. Trying to just pick it up now and be professional would be almost impossible|`|uuHrf7cGaa	Anything is possible - where there is a will there is a way. If you believe in yourself and have the magic you can do it - go for it. It does not matter where you live. You should be a lucky one to live in Delhi - to get what all you need.....Patience, dedication, gratitude, money and time are the most important things you need to remember.     On the other hand - if you are not athletic and you do not have what it takes to be a tennis player - do not even go there.

2C8Kjj78aa	I'm making an assumption based on your screen name, but here is a list of the universities that have Division II women's volleyball teams.  Note that some of them are transitioning to Division I.    http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/spon...    In 2008, Concordia-St. Paul won the DII championship, beating Cal State San Bernardino in 5 sets.      As for requirements -- that's hard to say.  Volleyball is pretty competitive at the DII level.  Figure out what kind of school you want to attend in terms of location, majors offered, quality of life, etc. and then narrow down the list and start contacting the coaches.  There may be some walk-on opportunities but it varies from school to school, so it's best to have some contact with the coaches before you show up.      Good luck...

Y4RS35M7aa	You will never damage your Taurus center fire revolver from dry firing it.      Period.|`|f31934c5ab0ede56c2ad73c5a2c9979eaa	Unfortunately the gun companies are now under the control of lawyers and it can really suck sometimes (like Kimber, Kahr, and Springfield 1911 guns adopting added parts like Colt did way back in 1983).  Kimber takes the opposite approach and wants you to dry-fire their gun as opposed to lowering the hammer.  They say that it is to keep the sear from wear (to keep trigger quality) but it is more out of fear that someone will lower the hammer on a laoded round, slip, and "bang"!  Ruger has practically ruined the legacy of the Mark I/II series with all the nonsense that they pulled with the newer Mark III.  These businesses are about money first and foremost, not us guys out there extolling the virtues of good firearms and shooting.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	There's nothing in the 608 that will be harmed by dry firing.  You won't bulge the breech face, damage the firing pin, wear out the sear, peen the hammer, or crack the transfer bar.    I'd guess that the Taurus legal department has advised them to issue the no-dry-firing edict to cut down on potential lawsuits over negligent discharges.  That's just a guess, though.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Just buy some plastic caps to load in it for practicing and not worry about it.

SEFOLOSHA is AWESOME. <br>  he's a really great player. and I was very upset to see him leave the Bulls... along with Nocioni and Gooden.. <br>  I always went to the home games. and now its not the same anymore. <br>  Thabo was a really good player when they actually let him play!|`|br1kwegaaa	This was a very good deal for OKC.  The Thunder needed a #2 to go along w/ Westbrook, Green and Durant.  Thabo isn't a scorer, but the Thunder don't necessarily need another scorer on their squad.  They  need a solid defender and someone who is willing to do the dirty work on both sides of the floor.  Sefalosha will start for the Thunder.  Thabo will be much better than anyone the Thunder would have picked with the late 1st round pick this year.  And Thabo still has plenty of upside in his career. <br>  <br>  Chicago has a logjam w/ Deng, Gordon, Salmons, etc. at the 2/3 spots, making Sefalosha expendable.  Deng, Gordon and Nocoini were ahead of Thabo on the depth chart, which limited his playing time.  The Bulls do have plenty of talent on the roster after their trades and can be a very intriguing team if they jell in time for the post season.|`|dDhTMacAaa	It is likely a pick that isn't theirs.
