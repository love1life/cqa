A4tps9Klaa	In my opinion, i would say Taker's 16-0 streak. I've always been a big fan of both Triple H and Taker, but i think the streak really stands out because who knows when a streak like that would ever be tried to be duplicated. Since Flair has won the most world titles of all (16 i believe, but i could be slightly off), I personally feel that Triple H for whatever reason is being pushed to equal, or eventually exceed Flair's number. One thing that i always think about is that if a wrestler won a title that many times, he's also lost it almost as many times. To me, a few real long title runs would actually be more impressive to me than very short, numerous title reigns. However, I understand that real long title reigns are a thing of the past (in order to keep the product fresh, and the fact that there are more wrestlers since the brand extensions some years back.) Going back to Taker's streak, i would be SHOCKED if Taker were to have his streak snapped at this point because the streak will forever be a part of his legacy in WWE, unless WWE and Taker felt that there was a particular deserving individual to snap his streak, but i find that unlikely at this point. But again, this is just my opinion. Great debatable topic though! :)|`|ES13pJjoaa	HAHA THATS EASY UNDERTAKER.<br>  Triple H only gets all those title reigns because he is married to the chairman of the wwe's daughter.Undertaker deserves the 13 world title reigns and undefeated wrestlemania streak.hhh deserves nothing<br>  <br>  <br>  It was a joke letting HHH win.Taker is 100 times better than HHH.Undertaker has a better name/a bigger moveset/is much taller/wiser etc<br>  <br>  HHH IS A SELFISH ASHOL.Undertaker is the bes t in the world not  triple h|`|w2nMrQzwaa	If i didn't know who these people are, i would say HHH 13 title reigns, because that is a fantastic amount, but as i know that he is married to the boss' daughter i would have to say Taker's 16-0 record at WM|`|nF36n2pKaa	Taker has clause in contract that he CANNOT lose at mania, HHH is married to the bosses daughter...so Niether In my opinion.|`|bMg8MTumaa	taker 16-0 <br>  i agree with people triple h is a very good wrestler but if he was not married to steph he would probably have about 7.|`|An10In6daa	Undertaker's 16-0 Streak|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Takers 16-0 record|`|Lv89kHKpaa	16-0<br>  <br>  Triple H doesn't deserve 13 world titles|`|6u2YkXjlaa	undertakers 16-0 at wrestlemania.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	16-0 <br>  because while titles are impressive going undefeated at the biggest night of the year is way better.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	undertaker because he didnt win it by marrying in to the family and championship!!!!<br>  hhh doesnt deserve 13 championships, he doesnt earn them like every1 else!!!!!|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Undertaker 16-0<br>  wrestlemania record|`|vN7hzs0taa	Triple H won the title 13 times yes but it means he lost it 13 times|`|Pvg6djVSaa	taker|`|AlGOniumaa	The Undertakers 16-0 at Wrestlemania, because it least there's something prestigious about it.<br>  <br>  I have a lot of respect for Triple H as wrestler, but I think 13 title reigns is ridiculous, and uncalled for. In pro wrestling championships belts don't necessarily make you the best in the business; but what they do is give you a spotlight to prove it. Guys like Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker don't need the Championship spotlight anymore, because their experience has taught them how to steal the show without it. So apparently Triple H still has something to prove to himself or someone else.|`|dtpY4BEraa	both and my reasons are<br>  <br>  wwe want taker to keep undefeated 16-0 he will never be defeated now<br>  triple H because hes good and everyone thinks he gets the push becasue of who he is married to which may be true but would be nice to think that he didnt just get it because of who he is married to|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Undertaker's 16-0 is more impressive, it's his legacy, he's beaten HHH, Orton, Hogan, Roberts, Edge and Flair at WM.

9NRyeif9aa	1.Bourne will return anytime before WM25.i can see him returning in a qualifying match for the MITB Ladder Match,then he'll beat his opponent go to WM25 as one of the MITB contenders,but he won't win it yet,because there are some certain persons who derserves to win the Briefcase more than Evan Bourne,and that's Mr.Kennedy! Kennedy is hungry for a title shot,he's hungry for his return,and i can see him winning the MITB Ladder Match again.as for Bourne,ECW should push him to an ECW title match.the guy deserves the title too.<br>  <br>  2.nobody does the Shooting Star Press better than Evan ''Air'' Bourne. the Billy Kidman version was a bit boring,no impact and no bang! Bourne's version is what we call "Poetry in Motion'' perfect delivery for a perfect highflying manuever from the one of the best highflyers in the history of Wrestling.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	World Wrestling Entertainment has provided no updates on Evan Bourne's surgery or rehabilitation. There a re a lot of wrestlers especially in the Indiependent Wrestling Promotions in the United States, Mexican Promotions, Japanese Promotions who do the Shoooting Star Press. Both Paul London and Billy Kidman do a better Shooting Star Press. Hector Garza and a number of other wrestlers also come ti mind.|`|F60inLeOaa	Ive been a WWE fan forever...and i admit...Evan Bourne does some cool stuff....but nothin totally new like RVD Or Rey Mysterio....And he has no personality.......I dont think wrestling has been the same since Stone Cold and The Rock left.....|`|T8IFOfHCaa	fck|`|Nmjjqoybaa	WQ1) You can expect his return anytime between Wrestlemania to Backlash<br>  <br>  WQ2) Paul London  .. he was one of the best at doing the shooting star press ...  he wanted the shooting star press as his finisher but Vince gave it to Evan Borune .. it said on an interview|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	WQ1) No one knows for sure but since the money in the bank ladder match NEEDS Evan Bourne he will be back before wrestlemania to win a qualifier... bank on it (see what i did? haha) I think they will do something with Mike Knox since he attacked Bourne and stole the slammey and that actually could be a good story because Knox is quite good (yes he is! don't argue) <br>  <br>  WQ2) No i don't think anyone else does do it better, there have been many stars use it since Jushin "Thunder" Liger innovated the move. No one gets the height or has the consistence that Evan does.

AA12400459	The 200 IM is a complex event, so don't expect to nail it the very first time. <br>  <br>  I think it will help that you are weak in the first two strokes. Those with very strong fly and back sometimes mistakenly go out too fast (thinking they have to take advantage of their strengths) and pay for it dearly at the end of the race. For you -- concentrate on staying long, smooth, and relaxed for the first 100. Then pick it up for the last two legs.<br>  <br>  On fly, make sure you BREATHE. If you get excited and forget to breathe often, you will really hurt later. I recommend breathing 2-up / 1-down. Really stretch and extend forward on the strokes when you don't breathe.<br>  <br>  On back, breathe only one time per arm cycle -- not every arm. For example, breathe when you raise your right arm and exhale while you pull with your right arm. Or do that with your left arm -- whichever feels more comfortable.<br>  <br>  If you are comfortable with your breaststroke and freestyle, just keep doing whatever you normally do for those strokes. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is that it's a 200 -- it's not 4 x 50 sprints. Stay smooth, but don't loaf. Concentrate on good stroke mechanics the whole way, and finish strong, and you'll be fine!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BXq8MZ8Zaa	yeah, im an IMer too, and fly and back are my weak strokes too. heres a couple tips that i keep in mind when i swim my IM.<br>  <br>  these first couple apply to the entire race:<br>  <br>  1) make sure youre in a streamline position both off your walls and your start, so you can hold your speed longer. having a loose streamline will slow you down by several seconds over a 200. also, the longer you stay underwater, the less you have to swim on top =)<br>  <br>  2) when you start each 50, the first 25 i like to build it up. get settled into your stroke and get your timing and stroke down, building into the turn. then on the next 25, you really go for it.<br>  <br>  Butterfly:<br>  1) streamline dolphin kick off the start and wall, but especially off the wall. thats because if youre underwater, the wake from the other swimmers will go over you.<br>  <br>  2) dont breath every stroke, try breathing every other, to establish a good rythym.<br>  <br>  3) be smooth. this is only the first 50, so dont expend all your energy, conserve it for later because youll need it. flow through the water and dont forget to kick.<br>  <br>  Backstroke (this is my worst stroke by far)<br>  1) save your legs. that doesnt mean dont kick, because you still need to kick. just make sure you have enough left in your legs, otherwise breaststroke will be miserable.<br>  <br>  2) if you arent good at back (like me) then try to keep your tempo up, so that you dont fall too far behind.<br>  <br>  3) make sure to keep your head back and still.<br>  <br>  Breaststroke<br>  1) the first 25 you should establish your stroke and get comfortable. build up your tempo as you approach the wall.<br>  <br>  2) think about surging forward every time you take a pull, bring your hips forward and your feet up. then, snap your legs together and shoot into your glide.<br>  <br>  Freestyle<br>  1) try to breath every 3 strokes, so you can see whats going on around you. dont breath the first stroke off any wall though,  because youll lose a lot of speed that way. take one stroke, and then breath.<br>  <br>  2) kick with everything you have left. its your last 50, so it should be an all out sprint.<br>  <br>  3) drive hard to the finish. make sure you're catching your water, no matter how tired you get.<br>  <br>  <br>  if you keep all that stuff in mind, your 200 IM should go great. good luck!|`|fPU8Skifaa	The 200 IM is only a difficult race if you think of it was a 200. To help simplify it, think about it as one 50 fast of each of the four strokes. If you go out too slow on the Fly then your time isn't going to be great. You just have to treat each new stroke as a new race and swim the whole think fast but smooth. Remember to have a good start, good streamlines, good-and legal-turns, and a good finish. If you can get in the right mindset to sprint the whole thing, you should have a really good time!|`|5C4S6SBQaa	OMG! I AM ON A SWIM TEAM TOO SO THIS QUESTION HOULD BE A SNAP! And I know how complicated IMs can be so let me try to help:<br>  <br>  My uncle used to be a coach for my team and when we used to do IM, some of the girls lost track on what they had to do next when they turned. Remember: Butter, back, breast, free. That will keep you doing the right stroke at the right time.<br>  <br>  Conserve you energy when you are racing but don't fly down the lane like a freakin' race horse. Try going at your own pace for practice but when you have time(or when a lane is clear) ask for a lane by yourself and get someone to time you one doing a 100 IM. That way, you will know what you mainly need to work on and to keep on doing what your doing on what strokes.<br>  <br>  Your legs and arms are pretty much what you need to get down the lane with a first place ribbon, right? Then do stregnth and endurance training. Try going to a gym or a YMCA and running minutes at a time. Do push-up and sit-ups and anything you can thing of that will help your legs and arms. Try a  sport outside of school like TENNIS! Perfect! You run like hell and hit the ball over the net(BTW, Ive played tennis before and it works both your legs and arms). <br>  <br>  If you get exhausted when you are doing 50m... Do some cardio while your at it. Your heart is what you basically need if you get worn out easily. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped at all.|`|m12R3pEMaa	Well.  I am a 200 IM swimmer, so let me try and help.<br>  <br>  As for butterfly- sometimes the slower you go on that 50, the harder it is to actually swim the stroke.  Fly is the weird stroke where faster can sometimes be better.  Just breath steadily about every 3 strokes.<br>  <br>  Backstroke- Breathe with every hand that you put in the water.  Pick a nice "cruise" pace, like a fast practicing pace.  Breathing is very important here.  You may not feel you need to breathe every rotation, but you'll later be thankful for the oxygen.<br>  <br>  Breastroke- Remember to glide after each stroke.  I have a personal tendendency to make this the most inefficient part of my race because I cut my stroke short.  Use your energy and get all that you can out of that glide.  <br>  <br>  Freestyle- Put everything you've got left into that last 50.  Don't be afraid to breathe every 2 strokes, just concentrate on getting to the finish.  Also, don't forget to kick.  Most people feel so tired they forget about their legs!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  This is one of the toughest races, and I say that from experience.  I hope you do well!

k4UKTpedaa	Maybe, sometimes even if there is snow they may close because their yearly insurance has run out. At the beginning of year they buy their insurances for a set period, and if there is still snow they have to close. So I would make reservations for Mammoth. During the spring if you get good weather not only can you ski, but mountain bike riding, fishing, snowmobiling by June Lake, and hiking a drive to the hot springs by the airport if not closed. Remember the sun goes down late in April and there is so much to do up there, it's worth it. Have fun!|`|iNqN0pp9aa	It is hard to tell.

sqfjfR3iaa	World Wrestling Entertainment pays Ezekial Jackson a base salary plus bonuses, just as they pay everyone else.

21J0IIZbaa	Pittsburgh over Wake Forest <br>  I hope UCLA can win.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	I don't even know, I would have said UConn before dyson went down.<br>  <br>  I also would have said UNC before I realized they can't play defense.<br>  <br>  Pitt looks outstanding at their best, blair destroyed thabeet, but then they lose to providence. <br>  <br>  Oklahoma looks defenseless without Griffin, indicates they may have a big problem if someone can shut him down.<br>  <br>  I think 10-15 teams have a shot to win it. <br>  <br>  My Cards appear to have gained focus after getting devastated at ND, maybe they have a shot too. <br>  <br>  GO CARDS!|`|wBGjks5uaa	UNC Chapel Hill, UCONN, Pittsburg or even Oklahoma|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	North Carolina Baby!|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	Pitt or Louisville|`|9iB1AiQlaa	UConn or Pitt. Those are just my first instinct guesses|`|7bx2XQlqaa	I've predicted the winner the past two seasons so I'm on a roll! lol<br>  <br>  And this year, I'm going to say UNC is taking it.  I hate them, but its true. Ty Lawson is going to dominate in the tournament this year.  He's just too good and UCONN's injuries hurts them a lot.<br>  <br>  The NCAA tournament is all about guard-play.  Its always been that way.  Lawson, Ellington, and Green will shine and UNC will win it all.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	Pitt, OU and UConn rely on a couple of guys while UNC has 5 or 6 guys capable of 20 or 30 point games. When Thabeet had a bad night against Pitt, UConn lost. When Griffin got hurt OU lost 2 in a row and when Blair got in foul trouble against Providence, Pitt lost. Hansbrough missed a couple of games and UNC didn't miss a beat. I think they'll lock down on defense when they need to in the tournament. Plus they have Final Four experience and they're hungry. UNC will win it all!|`|Xoyrweeqaa	North Carolina. There's all this talk about Pitt and Uconn, but I don't see that happening. They are good, but UNC is no doubt the best team in the country. I'm not a UNC fan, but i'm just going by what I think.|`|qDBeG26Saa	Marquette<br>  there good but they need to get more depth|`|1Mscji6Saa	pitt panthers.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	I choose TEXAS|`|6yoQhXsOaa	UConn is the best. not unc.|`|AvNlOHP9aa	pittsburg, this being because they are rising fast.<br>  my fav team is the cards.|`|niVHJdyLaa	UNC is definitely the best pick.  First of all, they are the healthiest team.  After playing without one of their top recruits, Tyler Zeller, all year, he is back.  Second of all, they have an experienced team that has made the Final Four.  Hansbrough is a senior, and is the defending player of the year.  Lawson may be the fastest PG in the country, and Danny Green is the best 6th man in the country.  On top of that, the tough competition found in the ACC, the best conference in the country, will allow the Tar Heels good warm-ups to the NCAA tournament.<br>  <br>  Oklahoma is a one-man show, and its' obvious that unless Blake Griffin dominates the game, Oklahoma can't win.  That was like Texas when they had Durant a couple years ago-- and they didn't fare too well.  But even that team had DJ Augustin.<br>  <br>  Thabeet is a bit overrated, and was shut down all game against Pitt.  Without Dyson, he's going to get more coverage.  Pitt is a gritty team, but isn't  a true powerhouse.  Teams like Duke, Michigan St. and Xavier have good rankings but have major downfalls (offense, inexperience, competition) and could be some of the top seeds being bounced early.|`|VU9PEme3aa	I think pitt even though they lost to Provdence but they are still a great team|`|wl4XUhLtaa	Pitt

Chel$ki must come to Torino and Arsenal must come to Roma both of them won only by one goal, especially Arsenal that won by PK, there is not even close to done job for two of them and even Real Madrid can surprise at Ainfield (just like Barca won two seasons ago).... only team that I think is already secured is Man U because Inter is not top quality team!!!!|`|cjNtjOZtaa	In my view it's not , I think all three leagues are equal, it just depends on what you want to see , pace skill or good defending or just hoofing the ball aka championship .|`|t2nObP1aaa	it never needed to be proven|`|IWM1khX7aa	It's always the best.<br>  <br>  1.

ef9bde338c53689b9b1568a4a538cb08aa	I would almost agree with you but Kelly is awesome. Also, I wouldn't even put Rosa Mendez in any Diva category (I find her so annoying) and the bells twins suck. <br>  <br>  Other than that, I agree.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	All the ladies work hard in the ring, so I won't judge them on that....but don't be surprised if the company attempts to retool and let some who can't cut it inside the squared-circle walk (not renew contracts) and replace them with solid workers (the TNA renewal contracts are ridiculously lowballing talent and Gail Kim won't be the only one signing with WWE).|`|gXHxf2G9aa	We seem to be getting somewhere but i'm not sure how far off we are yet...if it wasn't for Beth, Mickie and Melina I really think WWE would be up the crapper!!!<br>  <br>  The other diva's have their own individual roles to fill but it takes commitment, determination and skill to keep fans entertained during a match and few have that.<br>  <br>  Michelle is playing the role of Heel very well atm but she really needs to get a number one rival quick or she could be in serious trouble(Maria although skilled isn't really a wrestler) with losing interest with the fans.<br>  <br>  I think the Diva's on all brands have some work to do but we're very lucky to have Beth, Mickie and Melina on Raw to keep us entertained in the ring and out :)|`|M2NwClB2aa	i wouldnt put rosa mendes in a category because she is annoying and she's starting 2 get on my nerves and maria and kelly kelly aren't that bad, idk about the bellas their ok...i guess if anyone katie lea and  jillian should be in the crap category because jillian stinks just like her singing hahaha|`|RcORfsOIaa	Ok top of the list is best currently bottom is trash<br>  1) Beth<br>  2) Mickie<br>  3) Natayla<br>  4) Melina<br>  5) Maryse<br>  6) Jillian<br>  7)Gail Kim<br>  8) Kelly Kelly<br>  9) Michelle McCool<br>  10) Maria<br>  11) Alicia Fox<br>  12) Eve<br>  13) Bellas<br>  14) Rosa Mendes<br>  <br>  i forgot Katie Lea she's in between Maryse and Jillian|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	kelly is better than ppl think|`|hw6TcgO4aa	kelly kelly is not  she is cool

ozVqauMXaa	I'd say Young would be a slight favorite to start over Murphy, but who knows yet?  Also, are you worried about the WBC because of an injury concern?  I'd have a backup plan for any pitcher who is pitching in the WBC.  Otherwise no worries.  There is no scheduling conflict with the start of the season, and I would think any hitter would benefit from the WBC in terms of competition, and getting their timing, etc.|`|gUMucKOkaa	Players in the WBC will be back with their teams before the regular season starts so that should have no impact on you.<br>  <br>  You have the entire spring training to decide if you should start Young or Murphy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
X8NGHSP8aa	No, he had a hissy fit because Mangni didn't talk to him the two times that they were in each others company and his feelings got hurt.

He was the same with the Lions, fat and lazy when he wasnt interested and dominating when he wanted to. He wanted out of Detroit (personally I dont bame him) and eventually he was such a cancer they dumped him on the Browns, they will need to do the same. Luckily for the Browns his potential to shut down an opponent will entice someone to make a deal. So yes...they have little choice based on his history to send him on his way.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	he wants out but i doubt the browns would trade him in year 1 of a 6 year contract unless they got a 2nd or 3rd round pick.

AA10300394	Practice, practice, practice! I was a cheerleader for years and I have a terrible memory. Just keep doing it over and over. And you should have learned it with the 8 counts ( meaning, do a certain move at 1, a certain move at 2, etc ) which can help too. Sometimes they don't just say 1...2...3.. they might say it like "1 and 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and 7, 8" or something like it. If it's a difficult move, it might take up 2 counts (counts 1 and 2, instead of just 1.)<br>  <br>  Sorry if that's confusing. It makes sense when you say it, not really when you type it. But anyway, keep practicing! That's how you remember it. :)|`|HfIkmgAUaa	All u can actualy do is keep practicing, the more u do it, it get stuck in ur head. one of the girls on my squad had trouble,after a week of nothing but dance,she could do the dance in her sleep|`|D6vDOkqHaa	im a cheerleaeder it not that hard, anyway recite the cheers over and over again, and for the moves do in in eight counts as in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and repeat. thats wat i do anyway it really helps me remember|`|5de97489e8a440e9b2e1255938a501b5aa	juss keep practicing and practicing and eventually u will kno the routine by heart, im an allstar cheerleader, and i joined in the middle of the year and i thought i wasnt gonna learn the routine in time, but i juss practiced and learned the routine very quickly

TfcEqYWHaa	Your Answer:<br>  Its never too late to start! I suggest playing defense if your not into running. Even though lacrosse is constantly moving during the game, playing defense will give you time to rest while the ball is on the other side of the field. Another option is to try playing goal keeper. No running and you get just as much action as the field players. I played goalie for a while and its a little scary at first but it's exciting once you get use to blocking the ball more so than catching it. <br>  <br>  The most useful way to practice your skills is playing wall ball. Find a big wall and bounce the ball off it with your stick like your throwing it to someone and catch it. Another tip is to switch what hand you hold your stick in just because a lot of coaches use exercises that require catching and throwing in your non-dominant hand. you can practice this by playing wall ball too. <br>  <br>  I hope that answers some questions you have. Just remember to have fun!

Seguro que disfruto de muchas "juergas" pero no era lo "prioritario". De Pel se recuerda la PERSONA de muchos otros al FUTBOLISTA. En cuanto valoras persona, deportista y futbolista por separado NO HAY COLOR.|`|8180855df89327ffdaaf609bbf70dd7baa	PELE...|`|3a896c64d147de032fc83bfc2400dc57aa	Pel, fue el mejor jugador el mundo, Maradona solo fue un argentino que tuvo suerte (en el ambito deportivo, claro pues en la vida no le fue muy bien).|`|b94d08446586f7439f89709c4be41ab6aa	UFF CLARO QUE PELE ..

En realidad yo no se cual es mejor de los dos porque sinceramente a Pele lamentablemente no lo vi jugar, por eso seria tonto decir algo de Pele.

Es muy poco original. Cero interesante. Cada hora la vas a ver posteada en el Yahoo Respuestas. "Quin es mejor Maradona o Pel?" junto con la tpica "Estuve follando,Ser que qued embarazada?" con sus diferentes variaciones. Y las respuestas obviamente sern las mismas: Habr alguno que se siente con derecho de opinar de la vida de los dems y dir "Pel porque Maradona fue un mal ejemplo porque ha metido cocana, y porque y porque bla bla bla" (mal ejemplo de qu, qu saben ellos de los problemas de Maradona, y adems quin dijo que haba que vivir como lo hace Maradona, cada quien con su vida, dejarlo tranquilo no?), un montn que en su vida han visto un partido de Maradona o de Pel, pero que se sienten expertos dirn "Pel porque era un crack dentro de la cancha, estuvo en 3 mundiales e hizo ms de 1000 goles" (lo chistoso es que de esos 1000 no han visto ninguno), otros que por amor patrio dirn "Che pues Maradona, que fue un grande y nos hizo campeones del mundo" o sino algo en portugus como "Pele y su joggo bonito ha sido lo mas grande du mundo" (o que esperaban que Argentina le fuera a Pel y Brasil a Maradona?), ellos expresan su amor patrio, lo que est muy bien, pero para responder la pregunta no sirven sus opiniones porque no son imparciales.

NFuddCIpaa	no doubt about it,golden state would lose to utah by 1-4 or 2-4|`|mp6D7EUKaa	Whoa, a little harsh on the Warriors.  Just because you guys got a 2-0 lead doesn't mean you have to talk like that.  I got a lot of respect for coach Sloan and many of the Utah players.      I'm a huge Warriors fan and have been for many years, and although I am pissed out of my mind, I think we can all admit that this is great basketball.  Just be content and feel a little lucky that you guys are up 2-0, because this could very well be 1-1.      Don't sleep on Golden State yet.  They play well at home, and they are a loose (but confident) team, and if they can play this well in Utah, they may be able to pull one out  although they definitely blew tonight.  This teams does not put any pressure on themselves which probably hurt them down the stretch of tonights game because maybe they were too loose shooting those free throws.  But to all you Utah fans:    The Jazz played very well against Houston in the first two games in Houston, but who won those first two games?|`|IhoZ7i32aa	I couldn't agree more.

Just remember, no series ever actually starts until a team wins on their opponents homecourt.

So i don't think you should be talking now, TALK WHEN THE WARRIORS WIN. =)|`|AA11668458	Do not talk like that against the GS because it just makes the JAZZ fans look bad.

If Utah wins Game 3 on Friday, Then it will be  a 4 game sweep.  If they lose game 3,  They will win Games 4 & 5 to knock out Davis & Jackson and the rest of the Warriors.  I don't think Golden State has the power to stop Boozer and Company. Go Jazz!!!

If you ever watch a Bret shoot interview he always talks about his dislike for HBK and has gone on record saying he will never like him and will always hate the guy. As for Vince I am sure Bret doesn't like him either but had to work with him for the Bret dvd so it didn't turn out like the warrior dvd. Also Bret agreed to work with him on that in exchange for Vince allowing Bret to use pictures of his career for his upcoming book, but just because he worked with him it doesn't mean he still doesn't hate the guy, after what happened to Owen and the screwjob I think it is safe to say he will always dislike those two. Also for the guy who mentioned Bret not hating Goldberg you're wrong there Bret blames him for the end of his career, he blames him for the stroke and said that Goldberg never once said he was sorry and in fact said it wasn't him who hurt Bret so I think it is safe to say Bret doesn't like him either. In fact Bret has become a bitter man and I don't think he really likes anybody anymore.|`|mkEGjlmNaa	Please tell me this is a joke.  You do know that wrestling is fake and these guys are just preforming trailer park theater, don't you?|`|7sa6B6Qhaa	Bret still holds grudges with both men in real life for the Montreal Screw Job.  It's not a scripted storyline, they factually gypped Bret, but he deserved it if you ask me.  Bret hasn't been as vocal about it lately, as a matter of fact he made good enough with Vince that he sucked up all foolish pride long enough to put together a DVD and appear at the Hall of Fame Ceremonies last year.  The funny (and stupid) thing is about the whole thing is that Bret's not mad at Bill Goldberg, the very man who ended his career.

I would think he'd be able to distinguish between the two, as they are very different. He was probably just making up an excuse. The Warriors play well, and are a handful with their running style, but they will not win in Utah, nor will Utah win in Oracle Arena.

M9JF9qcOaa	Depends on the league depth. One reply described Glaus as a backup player. Not in my league. If the trade is effectively Hafner for Tejada, Weeks and Rodrigues, do it. (If they are not all valuable players in your league you should invite someone to play with you.)   Most leagues Glaus is a decent (if flawed) starter (esp if qualifies at ss in your league), and Hafner is a real monster when healthy.   I would not give up Hafner and Glaus without looking for more in my league, but as always it depends on your settings.|`|IBn7kGSMaa	no way, I wouldn't do this one if someone payed me to.    Weeks is struggling beyond belief at this point, I have him on my team and am considering letting him go for his underproduction.  Glaus is much more valuable fantasy-wise than Tejada is, he has more power and gets more RBI's.      There are many closer options you can turn to now on waivers if you really need one that bad.     Hafner is so valuable, he is going to have a .300/40/120 season whether you like it or not.  And last of all, Lugo is just your average, run-of-the-mill waiver wire pickup that wont help your team that much.    If you look at the trade from each angle, it will hurt you if you accept|`|a231c73e8f9714e084b453a53b1f107eaa	Hell no. Hafner's too valuable. Think about it like this. Weeks is Lugo with more power. Glaus is Tejada with less average. I think that Weeks and Tejada cancels out Glaus and Lugo. So the trade basically becomes K-Rod for Hafner. That's insane. Don't do it.|`|IfKNASUmaa	YES! hafner is slumping and weekes is great and young.  Also tejada adds speed while rodriguez helps too.     Overall: You Must Make This Trade|`|eVJdTlIIaa	nahhh wouldnt do it...|`|42a9e269fff41142880c66cd98852c03aa	quickly, before they change their mind|`|OTyN4DNtaa	Ya, quickly.  Lugo is borderline a roster spot, glaus is a backup and hafner is a monster but only available at util.  tejada and frod are solid producers and weeks is great for backup cause he should be available in multiple positions.  he could start on many fantasy rosters.

O fato histrico aconteceria em julho, mas em novembro, Pel marcaria o milsimo gol de sua carreira, tornando-se o primeiro jogador profissional de futebol a atingir tal marca.    A data em que o Santos venceu o Vasco por 2 x 1 no Maracan?, com o gol de pnalti que colocou fim quele clssico, completa 35 anos nesta sexta-feira.    Paulistas e cariocas empatavam por um gol at os 32min do segundo tempo, quando Pel invadiu a rea e foi derrubado pelo zagueiro Fernando. Ele aguardou o posicionamento dos fotgrafos atrs das redes, correu para a bola e mandou-a no canto esquerdo de Andrada.    Enquanto o ex-goleiro argentino socava o ch?o, j que n?o defendeu a cobran?a por muito pouco, Pel corria para dentro do gol, pegava e bola e, rodeado por membros da imprensa, iniciava um discurso em prol das crian?as pobres e abandonadas do Brasil.    O santista chegou a vestir uma camisa do Vasco com o nmero mil nas costas e, aplaudido por mais de 65 mil pessoas, deu a volta olmpica no Maracan?.    Estdio que se eternizou no cora??o do Rei. Foi no Mrio Filho que o tricampe?o mundial estreou em jogos internacionais, estreou na Sele??o Brasileira e foi premiado com uma placa por um gol fantstico marcado naquele mesmo gramado.|`|841d8ef1aa3d50d90fe8eec8ab47ba16aa	19/11/1969 no maracan? contra o vasco|`|a2069d61a24588e4e0d81e292d733badaa	foi no dia 29 de Novembro de 1969, as 23h,11minutos no jogo do Santos contra o Vasco da Gama do Rio de Janeiro no Estdio Mario Filho (Maracan?), pelo torneio Gomes Pedrosa (Brasileir?o da poca), diante de 65.157 pessoas que o aplaudiram de p depois do gol quando dava a volta olimpica.

Rooney a aussi eu une grande influence.  Mais ce qui me pla?t avant tout c'est que l'quipe qui sort avec le victoire est celle qui a jou ce que les anglais appelle le "total football". Milan n'a pas ferm le jeu, loin de l, mais MU a vraiment jou pour attaquer, plus que pour dfendre et  l'arrive cela donne ce type de match.

He is carrying smackdown at the moment, and I think the show would loose alot of viewers if he wasnt on it.    Did you also notice they had two from the vault matches! Thats poor. It would help of they were worth watching. Who wants to see Chavo Guerrero against the hurricane?    The Benoit v MVP match was competetive, but was given far too much time in my opinion, It got a little boring.    I didnt really enjoy the tag match either, I cant stand Deuce & Domino, I just hate their stupid gimmick!    The Kane V Daivari was basically a squash match    I was a bit dissapointed with the Taker/Batista V Kennedy/Finlay match too. That was also boring.    Mark Henry is comin' back soon yeh, but I have read that he is fatter than ever and looks akward in the ring.       Yeh I was dissapointed with Smackdown, it was a poor show.    I really hope they make Kennedy a superstar, he has the in ring skills, and the mike skills to do it. Also I would like to see Benoit being used properly for a change, its just a shame his character is boring and lacks charisma. They need Rey Mysterio back!    poor show|`|RSgd7PBtaa	YE SI DID NOTICE HE DIDNT HIT HIM...EH ONLY SKINNED HIM...lIKE SERRIOSLY...MORE AND MORE PEOPLWE ARE GETIING TO NO THATS THEY DONT EVEN TOUGH EACH  OTHER..AND THE CODNEMDED THING...I NOTICED THAT AND I SAID IN MY HEAD...WHAT THE...GTE ON WITH THE DMAN SHOW...AND MaRK COMING BACK...DONT LIKE HIM BUT HE MAKES IT BETTTER.!|`|qr4oSSrPaa	get use too it buddy if you watch a smackdown from 2002 when heyman was the main booker and compare it to today you'll think that your watching to completly different companies since dave langana took over it has been bad.|`|9fd674b6fd3741eba2d20489a19d5e75aa	There were 4 matches?

If the DH is in the 5th slot in the order, for example, he may be pinch-hit for by another player, who must hit inthe 5th slot.  This offensive substition does not affect any of the pitchers for his team.    The DH is used in every professional league around the world EXCEPT the National League in North America.  The irony of this is that the DH was first suggested by Branch Rickey, in the 1930's, when he was GM of the St Louis Cardinals, a National League team.    The rule (6.10 of the rulebook) was adopted for the 1973 season.|`|AA12074189	The designated hitter is a player used in the American League.

It's most utilized in the American League where the DH bats in place of the pitcher. In actuality, the designated hitter can bat for any defensive player, but it's most commonly used to hit for the pitcher because the pitcher is often a team's weakest hitter.|`|AA11025456	it means that if a player on the team is a pitcher or catcher they would have somebody else on the team hit for them so they could rest their legs|`|AA11143405	DH means that a batter will hit for the pitcher.

Il n'y a plus de match sans erreur et cela n'est pas juste pour une quipe qui se bat d'tre injustement pnalis.  c'est pourquoi aujourd'hui j'adore le rugby et prfres de loin ce sport et son esprit.c'est pourtant un sport de contact trs rugueux et il y a des fois des coups ports mais ?a se rgle vite fait il n'y a pas de bagarre et quand les joueurs sortent du terrain les perdants font une haie d'honneur aux vainqueurs !! on verra jamais ?a au foot! en plus il n'y a jamais de simulation de faute et pourtant ils se prennent des coups..les joueurs sont courageux et je trouve cela remarquable.  il y a vraiment un "esprit" rugby que le foot a perdu, pourri par l'argent et les enjeux.  la preuve en chiffre : le stade de france  t rempli et  battu ses records d'affluence sur des matchs de rugby et non de foot  (79 741 spectateurs pour un simple match de championnat du top 14!!!c'est pas la coupe du monde et pourtant...)  et oui quand on est en famille avec femme et enfants c'est plus s?r et plus agrable : il n'y a jamais de bagarre entre supporters ou de jets d'objet par exemple..     j'espre toujours que le foot s'inspire du rugby et redescende sur terre pour redevenir un vrai sport..l'espoir fait vivre !!|`|nZ1SlJaDaa	Rugby sans hsiter !!!|`|3c00fe170901c5cc65f8ca631e300c06aa	Rugby !

Comme disait je ne sais plus qui je suis convaincu que "tout ce que la vie attends d'un homme se trouve en bon ordre dans un match de rugby", et comme disait un autre, je crois qu'une quipe de rugby reprsente la "parfaite proportion entre les hommes. Sur et en dehors du terrain, ce sport m'a appris le respect de l'autre, l'abngation et le sens du sacrifice, l'esprit d'quipe, et bien d'autres choses. Il m'a surtout appris que pour faire un bon match, il fallait 2 bonnes quipes, c'est pourquoi les supporters au rugby cohabitent avec fraternit dans les tribunes des stades...  Evidemment la complexit des rgles le rend difficile  apprhender par le grand public, et c'est ce qui fait que le foot sera toujours plus populaire, car plus accessible. Nombreux sont ceux qui ne voient pas toute la technique individuelle et la tactique dployes. Le profane ne voit bien souvent que des brutes qui se rentrent dedans, car les subtilits de ce sport ne sont per?ues que par ceux qui le connaissent un minimum.  Je ne critiquerai pas le foot, mme si je m'ennuie bien souvent en le regardant ou en y jouant, mais tant passionn de rugby, pour moi il n'y a videmment pas photo!|`|LFia0dQNaa	Rugby incontestablement.

Muchas veces se unen para reafirmar una postura en comun, a veces con fines macabros que se entremesclan la ambicion, el poder y la influencia para determinado origen.   Es buena tu pregunta, de hecho yo tambien soy agnostico. Creo que no ha sido til el hombre para con las religiones, recordemos tambien que detras de cada cura hay un hombre. Una vez que ya se empieza a disipar el misticismo de la religion, a traves de los a?os, la iglesia como amortiguador de duda existencial, deja de surtir efecto. Entonces, ?Donde est el problema?. En la educacion. Mucha gente por ignorancia se rehusa a pensar que no hay otra forma de evolucion, salvo la que esta escrita en los sagrados mandamientos. ?Porqu se ha generado esta ignorancia provocada?. Porque la religion posee fines de lucro. ("La religion es el opio de los pueblos".

cd023b628db4ffd97e9837ab845e37f8aa	Big Show is probably gone for good. I don't see him renewing his contract in Feb if he's having health problems. Sabu is on shaky ground as it is with blowing spots in the ring and he has some work problems backstage too. Now with ECW firmly under Vince, he'll likely start phasing out the older, old school ECW people that they brought in just to try and get the old ECW fans watching.    I would hope they would put the title back on RVD... but they might not even do that. Vince is still ticked at him because of the traffic bust, and he prolly knows with Heyman gone and Vince's version of ECW locked in that RVD will likely not want to stay with WWE when his contract is up in a few months. Why put the title on RVD if he'll have to have him lose it before his contract is up (can't have another screwjob situation).     Lashely just isn't cutting it (which is why they moved him to ECW anyway, they didn't think he was ready to be a main player on the other shows). He doesn't have much in ring skills, and he really can't do promos. He has that hulking mesomorph look that Vince loves so much, but that's it.     I think Vince would rather put it on Test or Holly right now. If Vince is smart (stop laughing), he starts to really build up CM Punk, and have Punk take the title sometime later this year at one of the big PPVs.|`|9bcad488b49fb718ef4dc63d79233060aa	ME!!!

They came into the playoffs winning nine out of the last 10 games and five in a row, dismissing the Mavs with authority. I think with this next round whether it's gonna be with Utah or Houston, it's gonna pretty competitive and pretty exciting.    In the regular season the Warriors were 2-1 vs the Rockets, and 2-2 vs Utah. I think there's more balanced scoring with Utah than with Houston and I think Utah has a more reliable defense than Houston. That combined with the fact that I'm a huge fan of both Yao Ming (remember Yao is his last name) and Tracy McGrady has me rooting for a Rockets-Warriors series for Round 2.

GSW had an advantage because of the couching, but overall Dallas did not have it tonight.  They must have left it here in Dallas with us.  But anyway, it is just a game and I love it.  Good job GSW.

I'm not trying t be negative though but I guarantee they will hit a bump in the road this season just like the White Sox did in 05. So just don't get too cocky, because many Sox fans were. And you still have the playoffs to get through. So just hope they continue their winning ways this season and (as a White Sox fan), kill the Cards and Cubs (PLEASE!!!).|`|471b0f516164655a2182e6d175d1dfacaa	I think the Brewers have a real shot this year because their GM has made a lot of good moves, they have a lot of good young players, and their division(NL Central) is possibly the worst in baseball.|`|4eac92e4d4c2f35101eff6da4c797f23aa	Yes, they're pretty good, maybe this years Tigers and the division is kind of weak so it looks promising for them.|`|SOa9OnDyaa	I have join the I'll pee my pants if the brewers make the play offs so yea im going to pee my pants this year for sure

The field shall be laid out according to the instructions below, supplemented by Diagrams No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 on adjoining pages. The infield shall be a 90-foot square. The outfield shall be the area between two foul lines formed by extending two sides of the square, as in Diagram 1. The distance from home base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on fair territory shall be 250 feet or more. A distance of 320 feet or more along the foul lines, and 400 feet or more to center field is preferable. The infield shall be graded so that the base lines and home plate are level. The pitcher's plate shall be 10 inches above the level of home plate. The degree of slope from a point 6 inches in front of the pitcher's plate to a point 6 feet toward home plate shall be 1 inch to 1 foot, and such degree of slope shall be uniform. The infield and outfield, including the boundary lines, are fair territory and all other area is foul territory. It is desirable that the line from home base through the pitchers plate to second base shall run East-Northeast. It is recommended that the distance from home base to the backstop, and from the base lines to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on foul territory shall be 60 feet or more. See Diagram 1. When location of home base is determined, with a steel tape measure 127 feet, 338 inches in desired direction to establish second base. From home base, measure 90 feet toward first base; from second base, measure 90 feet toward first base; the intersection of these lines establishes first base. From home base, measure 90 feet toward third base; from second base, measure 90 feet toward third base; the intersection of these lines establishes third base. The distance between first base and third base is 127 feet, 338 inches. All measurements from home base shall be taken from the point where the first and third base lines intersect. The catcher's box, the batters' boxes, the coaches' boxes, the three-foot first base lines and the next batter's boxes shall be laid out as shown in Diagrams 1 and 2. The foul lines and all other playing lines indicated in the diagrams by solid black lines shall be marked with wet, unslaked lime, chalk or other white material. The grass lines and dimensions shown on the diagrams are those used in many fields, but they are not mandatory and each club shall determine the size and shape of the grassed and bare areas of its playing field. NOTE (a) Any Playing Field constructed by a professional club after June 1, 1958, shall provide a minimum distance of 325 feet from home base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on the right and left field foul lines, and a minimum distance of 400 feet to the center field fence. (b) No existing playing field shall be remodeled after June 1, 1958, in such manner as to reduce the distance from home base to the foul poles and to the center field fence below the minimum specified in paragraph (a) above.              DIAGRAM  2    -            DIAGRAM  3    -       1.05  Home base shall be marked by a five-sided slab of whitened rubber. It shall be a 17-inch square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are 81/2 inches and the remaining two sides are 12 inches and set at an angle to make a point. It shall be set in the ground with the point at the intersection of the lines extending from home base to first base and to third base; with the 17-inch edge facing the pitchers plate, and the two 12-inch edges coinciding with the first and third base lines. The top edges of home base shall be beveled and the base shall be fixed in the ground level with the ground surface. (See drawing D in Diagram 2.)   1.06  First, second and third bases shall be marked by white canvas bags, securely attached to the ground as indicated in Diagram 2. The first and third base bags shall be entirely within the infield. The second base bag shall be centered on second base. The bags shall be 15 inches square, not less than three nor more than five inches thick, and filled with soft material.     1.07  The pitchers plate shall be a rectangular slab of whitened rubber, 24 inches by 6 inches. It shall be set in the ground as shown in Diagrams 1 and 2, so that the distance between the pitchers plate and home base (the rear point of home plate) shall be 60 feet, 6 inches.     1.08  The home club shall furnish players benches, one each for the home and visiting teams. Such benches shall not be less than 25 feet from the base lines. They shall be roofed and shall be enclosed at the back and ends.     1.09  The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small core of cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two stripes of white horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh not less than five nor more than 5 1/4 ounces avoirdupois and measure not less than nine nor more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference.     1.10  (a) The bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 23/4 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood.

Basically, when your team is batting, hit the ball and run as fast as you can. If someone steps on the base your running to with the ball your "out". If you make it all the way around you score a point. The farther you hit the ball, the easier it is. Batting cages are very helpful for practicing, it's a small ball, hard to hit. When your team is in the field, the goal is to either catch the ball [which would make the batter "out"] or tag the runner or the base they are running to and get them "out". Team with the most points win! It van get complicated with additional rules, but these are the basics. It's a fun game.|`|7vBxWZrcaa	You sit around... do nothing...  sit some more.... do nothing... play jokes on your teammates.... do nothing.... watch the pitcher throw the ball.... sit some more... game over.....|`|71d0b84b1579cc5b1830dece760949b0aa	it's very complicated so look it up on http://www.wikipedia.org    but the Main point of the game for hitters is to get to home plate (there are many ways you can do that)   the main point for pitchers is to strike the hitters out, or get them out somehow without letting any runs score or idealy to not even let a hitter get on base. (no hitter/ perfect game without walks)  oh and to play you need a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd baseman, a shortstop, catcher, 3 outfielders, and umpire, and a  pitcher idealy at least 3 ready to play if you want to play for real
AA10034577	Drop someone else.  Get a hot OF like Shawn Green or Victorino, but just leave Jones on the bench again until he heats up again, and he will.|`|GtyCKa4Oaa	dont u dare drop him trade him upgrade in any thing u need|`|kjTZZ0YYaa	dude you kidding? When you hear the name Andruw Jones, you hear an all around good hitter and a great center fielder. He is just in a little bit of a slump. Bobby Cox put him in the 6th spot in the rotation at the start of the week but now he is in the 5th spot. He will be back to the   4 spot in a week or so when he gets back on track.     Andruw Jones is better then Sammy Sosa and Eric Byrnes!!!|`|q9v26B6Vaa	Definitely do not drop Jones.  He is easily a top 20 outfielder (or even higher).  If you are really uneasy about Jones, trade him to someone else and pick up a different player or stat that you need.  Jones is typically a slow starter anyway; wait till after the all-star break.  Jones will come through for you.  Besides, if you were really contemplating dumping somebody, either dump Sosa or Byrnes. . .their worth is minimal because they are so streaky.  Hang in there with Jones!!!|`|aedbe6a507e04180b3b975bdb7e2f1b4aa	Hey think about it like this. If he has averaged 35 hr's a year for the past 7 year's and averaged about 85-100 RBI then, he has some big hot streaks coming up.     The baseball season is long, I wouldn't even bench him because that'll be the week he hits 5 hr and 10RBI. Trust me I'm a braves fan, this guy is like Manny w/o the clout. And would you bench Manny. I'm from the South and people on the east and on the west coast don't know about Andruw.    Drop him and I'll pick him up instantly. He's worth a 1 waiver spot if dropped. I wouldn't even trade him b/c the best is yet to come barring injury. Hold tight at least until mid-June on a trade. You never drop a guy like him.    Never!! Hope you catch my drift. Have I said never. NEver.
727d7e47afd7d0b1ceb01fdf824d755caa	Why is it easier to believe that a cop killed his pregnant girlfriend who was due in 2 weeks and left his 2 year son alone in the house where he killed her than to believe that CB murdered his wife and child? Goes to show the mentality of people not wanting to believe that the people they 'know' could do something like that. Problem is that no one really knew him - they knew his wrestling personna and nothing else!|`|FTsTKIsuaa	This is all true, but can we all just wait for the investigation to end before we slam Benoit with names like "child killer" and "coward"?|`|4ff1511dee3e82b9571d8c5ef1795e41aa	a is batista w/o the whole killin thing and b is who?|`|vGu6bcR9aa	They think he didn't do it because they don't want to believe. They love and "know" his public persona. That's all. They have no clue about the real man.     He killed his family and they still love and look up to him.    Frankly, that's sicker than what Benoit did.|`|qr4oSSrPaa	first of all things don't add up and secondly police have to make a statement to get people off their backs. Its too early to make judgements. We will never know what happened.|`|AA11921177	I don't believe Benoit did it because there IS NO proof. Simple as that.     Yes i'd like to think he wouldn't do that, but seeing as theres no evidence theres no reason to think Benoit could have killed his family. Simple as that.|`|o5dK6Osqaa	The only reason why people don't think Benoit did it is because there's no evidence.|`|hFbULUaqaa	omg this question was a waste of five points because theres no proof chris was on steriods  or anything all u people here are stupid and when they come out with the real results he didnt do it im going to laugh in everyones face|`|AA10396846	Wrestlers have to change their look just for their characther personality. But if you see them in real life then there will be an humongus change in personality.|`|5D2LmmGHaa	lol, we just dont wanna believe it. i  grew up watching him, its like finding out the nija turtles and barney smoke crack lol, but  i have come to terms, i jus wonder what would drive a man so crazy|`|sSbAB9nTaa	latest on yahoo    Detective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.    The station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.                  from minute one when i heard the family issues the day before that was a red flag      but why the wife and kid|`|Re0I4wGFaa	Death is what he deserved. He killed his wife and his 7 year old son. Are they wouldn't be saying it was a murder suicide.|`|0013b499066df25bb53241d27463f068aa	I agree with benoit no.1 fan and julie       WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE       Come on he skipped vengance cause his wife and son were severly ill and coughing up blood and gave up his work and came home to be with them        Good god stop speculating and wait for the facts i for one don't belive it        give it a break someone that kills his family is not gonna wait 2 days to kill himself duh .       Show some respect           I believe Chris is innocent         He's left behind 2 children mourning there father's death        not to sound mean but put away the detective hat sherlock and leave the investigation to the proper authorites         R.I.P Chris and Family       Prayers go out to his remaining children in this tragic time       I for one am going to miss him|`|3O1EcmrGaa	The minute I heard this story I thought he was responsible.  IF it's found out that he killed his wife and kid, he's a bigger piece of **** than O.J. Simpson to me.  This story upsets me because I was a big fan of his wife Nancy in ECW and WCW when she was known as the Fallen Angel and Woman.  A buddy of mine and I were discussing how we missed seeing her on tv and how great she was in her heyday only days ago, and now she's dead.  Add to that the fact that a 7 year old kid was murdered and it's extremely disturbing.      I was never a fan at all of Chris Benoit as I always found him extremely boring and thought it was a sick joke when he was made part of the 4 Horsemen in the mid 90's.  He and that idiot Steve McMichael had no business being pushed that high and I was so happy the nWo completely squashed that group on a regular basis.  There are lots of fans who love the "ring technicians" who are f'n robots in the ring with no personality, and Benoit was the textbook definition of that.  The fact that people compared him to Bret Hart and Kurt Angle is a joke in itself as these 2 men were entertaining and also better in the ring.  Sorry to be kicking a man when he's down (or dead in this case), but I've been hearing about this all day and am already damn sick of it.  No matter what the outcome is, it's sad, but if it's found out that Benoit did it, just gives me more reason to not give two shits about him.

De plus France/NZ en 1999 c'tait le 1er match de Kelleher et c'est pas le petit jeunot qu'on va rencontrer cette fois, par ailleurs on a pour le moment pas montr grand chose et vu la compo de l'quipe de France (o sont les avants?)..., enfin celle des all blacks qui a mit 40/0  l'quipe b de l'Ecosse tait constitue de plusieurs rempla?ants ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'quipe qui affrontera la France.    Petit note pour les nouveaux supporters dont tu dois faire parti Jeff the french, Sachez que le rugby n'est pas le foot! On respecte l'adversaire. Il est honteux de siffler lors d'un hymne ou durant le haka. Les All black pour tout supporter de rugby (et qu'importe de quelle quipe) respecte et mme admire cet adversaire. C'est une quipe mythique! Tu peux chambrer certes mais pas manquer de respect! C'est aussi lamentable que de siffler la marseillaise!

XWDjyYNpaa	You've definetely got to go with Lamont Jordan in this case.  Both defenses that the backs are going up against have played weak against the run, however Miami's utter lack of offense probably means their defense will be on the field more often and more tired (the Eagles will at least have enough offense to keep their D off the field for the whole game).  Also, Joey Porter guaranteed a win this week for Miami; his Pittsburgh teammates might have been able to step it up whenever he called on them to deliver a win but my bet is that Miami folds.    It's also worth noting that they're giving up an average of 130+ rushing yards a game, and that before last week (where they still gave up 110 to Thomas Jones) they gave up at least 1 Rushing TD in each game (2 for Marion Barber in week 2 and 1 for Clinton Portis in week 1).  I like the odds of Lamont seeing the end zone this week.|`|dO5zuuD9aa	Lamont Jordan. He's going to have a great day running the football. The only thing is that if Oakland gets down early, he's not going to have a chance to run the football.   Also, Eli Manning is back almost 100%, so the Giants are going to throw the football more than last week. Plus, the Giants are going to get down early.|`|AA10036487	Jordan vs. Miami.  Miami D stinks, they even let T Jones run all over them.  Jordan is better and has been consistent all season long.|`|kNn1o8ebaa	word Eeagles lost .|`|fC5HvuVYaa	Way to just repeat previous answers.

A imprensa esportiva brasileira  porca, um lixo, os caras discutem o campeonato como se fossem torcedores e n?o como se fossem "profissionais" da rea, o que a maioria realmente n?o .Falam muito do corinthians por causa daquele suposto indice de IBOPE que eu realmente n?o sei se  t?o real assim a diferen?a do corinthians para os outros clubes de SP.Fa?a que nem eu, que parei de assistir essas porcarias de programas, as vezes passo pra ver se v?o mostrar algo do S?o Paulo, como ontem por exemplo que eu n?o pude acompanhar o jogo e estava curioso pra saber o resultado, tive que assistir a reprise( ainda bem que estava no final, 35 do segundo tempo ) porque n?o citavam nada sobre o lider do campeonato, pois estavam muito ocupados com o "empolgante jogo"  do corinthians que tinha acontecido no "dia anterior".     como j disseram aqui a imprensa "planta" material pra falar do corinthians muitas vezes fica at for?ado.      Fa?a como muita gente j est fazendo, boicote esses programas e procure outras fontes, pra mim a internet est sendo a grande salva??o.      Obs: Por mais que critiquem a globo, no seu programa esportivo ela dedica um tempo separado e bastante equivalente pra cada time grande aqui de SP.|`|WzrChwE6aa	Porq o Corinthians  o time de maior torcida de SP, por isso d mais audincia quando falam dele!

Isso n?o acontece somente a em S?o Paulo, aqui no Rio de Janeiro tambm  assim com o Flamengo!  O Flamengo todos os anos vm montando elencos horrorosos, lutando contra rebaixamento e a imprensa sempre dando mais ibope ao Flamengo!  Isso deve ser por causa da quantidade de torcedores em rela??o as outras, s pode ser!  Eles acham que quantidede  tudo e, na minha opini?o  a qualidade e n?o quantidade!  Todos os anos o Fluminense vm montandos equipes boas e, entrando nos campeonatos, pricipalmente no brasileiro brigando pelo ttulo e, o Flamengo j entra sabendo que vai lutar contra o REBAIXAMENTO!  Em S?o Paulo n?o  diferente daqui do Rio de Janeiro!  Pobre imprensa brasileira! D nojo assistir programas esportivos pela falta de profissionalidade desses caras!

20lW8vUVaa	Wow 10/10!!!|`|AA12056929	Hornswoggle v Rey Mysterio- This is a sad occasion. Like GAB '91 sad. At least Rey took the title from the little bastard    Palumbo v Kane- Seeing as I've already answered your NWO match, I'm guessing the titans are having a pretty extensive feud. This would be fun to watch    Flair/Batista v MVP/Matt- Evolution coming back together is a great match. And Batista losing is even better.    RVD/Umaga/Finlay vs Viscera/Booker/Masters- Pretty good match, except for "Big Daddy V".  I'd be cheering for Booker and Masters, but Team RVD has a better lineup    Khali v Edge- Why the hell does Khali have the title? At least the Rated R one has finally gotten his due. Well, if Abyss can hold gold, then why not Khali, eh?    Kennedy v Cena v HBK- It would be better to see Kennedy take the belt from someone (preferably HBK), but it's great seeing Kennedy champion    Royal Rumble- YAAAAAY!! ^_^    Not too bad. I like the champions and match-ups you chose.

3d4ddde8be0ebf1caa0a81d5debb0cb9aa	O cavalo  bem conformado para o trabalho e a corrida. Por exemplo, as narinas grandes facilitam-lhes a respira??o. Os cavalos tem um apurado sentido de olfato, ouvido sensvel e uma boa vis?o (sentido dos eqinos). Tem dentes fortes, mais s comem cereais e plantas, jamais carne. As pernas compridas e musculosas d?o-lhes for?a para puxar grandes cargas ou para correr em alta velocidade. Os cavalos tambm usam as pernas como principal arma. O coice de um cavalo pode ferir gravemente um homem ou outro animal.  Como qualquer outro esporte, arrasta multid?es aos hipodromos, e fazem parte da histria de Reis e Rainhas. A Rainha Elisabeth da Inglaterra  proprietria de inmeros cavalos, e sempre est presente nos grandes prmios,  assdua frequentadora dos hipodromos londrinos. Carlos Gardel dedicou tangos a esse esporte, ele mesmo sendo proprietrio de muitos animais e amigo de grandes joqueis.   um dos nicos esportes, em que alm de torcer para seus animais favoritos, ainda lhe proporciona o prazer de apostar no mesmo instante da corrida.  considerado o esporte dos Reis.|`|PlKAGC09aa	Pra corrida de cavalo  necessrio estabelecer uma dupla, onde: o cavalo entra com a for?a e o jckey com a mente.|`|85d54250c68ae31ecebd55741a89e5dcaa	nunca curti esse tipo de corrida nao|`|0da42ae392d8302588bbca65657289c6aa	 sim....  um esporte de cavalo!

2328eacc729e77583d0b7971974a3f44aa	Risers are used to keep the wheel from touching the deck. If it does you will be sent flying off. It isn't necessary, but you might want it if you  have low trucks and big wheels. Bearings are the circle things in the wheel that make it wheel spin. Yes a 127.98 is a good price for any board. It depends on how cautious you are. You might not break a bone, but you will get hurt.|`|xClf00Ccaa	well riser's are for like skating vert so if you carve you wont get any wheel bite on your deck but you dont need them , it's easier to skate street without them    the bearing's are the main thing to the skateboard like wheels are for a car,without them you could'nt roll    If it's a complette then Yes! it's a great deal if it's just a deck then no    and......the breaking the bone part ,like 3 months when i started skating i broke my ancle,(it didnt hurt to bad though)    hope this help's|`|012af62fb8859cf9daddd90fda9ffd8daa	1.risers add hieght to the board and from having the trucks rub against the deck  2. Bearing are the thing that make the skateboard roll there inside the wheel and two on each wheel. The hight the ABEC the faster it will go  3. For just the board no but if it is a complte its alrite. I recomend getting a element if your going to pay that much money becasue Element makes a Fiberlight skateboard which is a fiberglass strip inside down the length of the board and they will last longer  4. if matters how crazy u r at it....like ive been skate for a couple years and never broke a bone but i dont try to jump 10 stair cases or anything

D7OFstJzaa	tennistiquement les fran?ais sont trs forts, le problme se trouve dans la tte des joueurs.  Si on prend l'exemple de Pioline et Leconte, ils avaient le talent pour faire des carrires normes, mais gach par leur mental (Leconte trop fantaisiste, Pioline trop "fragile"). Bref, il leur manque les nerfs, et c'est ce qui fait la diffrence, voir Federer, Nadal, Agassi, Sampras.  Si on regarde bien, avant Mauresmo, les derniers fran?ais qui ont gagn un Grand Chelem taient...Noah et Pierce; l'un a des ascendances africaines, l'autre amricaines. On sait que les amricains sont "presque" insensibles  la pression, cf Agassi, Sampras, Roddick, les Williams and co. Pour Noah, je me dis que ses origines lui ont apport la dcontraction dont bcp de joueurs fran?ais auraient besoin.    Mais au niveau du talent pur, les fran?ais n'ont rien  envier  personne, except Federer, comme beaucoup de monde...|`|b7c65878e9594bbdf565fd903892c067aa	Il commence - enfin ! -  se rveiller...Gasquet a  mon sens enfin pass un cap et quelques autres jeunots ont montr un gros potentiel (Mahut, Tsonga...). Chez les filles, la monte de Bartoli fait plaisir : on a enfin quelqu'un qui peut nous surprendre dans le bon sens (avec Mauresmo on tait plus habitus  des mauvaises surprises, en la voyant perdre contre des beaucoup moins bien classes qu'elle...).    Donc il commence  merger qqch de franchement pas dgueu de ce tennis fran?ais, aprs des annes de vaches maigres. Maintenant, Gasquet et Bartoli vont tre sous le feu des projos. Esprons que ce surcro?t de pression et d'exposition mdiatique n'entravera pas la poursuite de leurs progrs !|`|bxt511X2aa	Il commence  percer,  sortir de l'ombre.

Y por supuesto que a niveles mundiales tienen mas popularidad el Football y aun mas el Baseball, incluso en Amrica Latina el Baseball es el deporte   1 por encima del SOCCER, de ahi que surge "LA SERIE DEL CARIBE", donde participan obviamente USA, MEXICO, CUBA, PUERTO RICO, ETC., ETC., en cuanto al Football, hay liga en Canad, Mexico, tambien en Argentina, Uruguay y algunos pases de Europa (UK, Italia, Suecia, etc.) y Asia como Japn, donde por cierto tambien es muy comn el Baseball.    Incluso en nuestro propio Mexico aunque no lo crean an existen regiones en donde el Baseball esta por encima del soccer!!, esto en el Norte y en el Sureste, incluso tenemos nuestra propia liga profesional de Baseball!!!    Asi pues creo que es evidente el exito superior de los deportes Gabachos por encima de los de origen Europeo (Soccer, Cricket y Rugby) que nuestros amigos Che's defienden como si fueran suyos, pero todos son de origen INGLES aunque a ellos les arda, sorry!      Ah y otra aclaracin mas:    Para sorpresa de muchos resulta ser que el deporte   1 en el mundo NO ES NINGUNO DE LOS MENCIONADOS!!    Es ni mas ni menos que el Volley Ball !!!  En 2o es el Basket ball  Y hasta el 3o el Soccer    Pues se basa en el nmero de asociaciones que integre cada pas de cada deporte en especifico, asi como el nmero de jugadores o competidores que lo integren, asi pues nuevamente se equivocan los Che's al afirmar que era el Rugby el 2o mas popular.    De donde lo sacan???|`|wMiIcUYpaa	definitivamente por falta de cerebro,ya que no entienden ni entendern las reglas aunque presumen de tener equipos de americano son una verdadera basura,su cerebro solo les da para patear una pelotita como bobos,y para el estpido del usuario llamado GLACIAR ES UN TOTAL IGNORANTE,QUE NO SABE QUE Mxico tiene a la golfista n1 del mundo,tiene a una de las mejores corredoras de velocidad,marchistas y remeros,tambin se le olvida que sus miserables gatitos boxeadores nunca le han podido ganar a un boxeador de  Mxico,y as puedo seguir con la enorme lista que conforman los atletas y deportistas mexicanos reconocidos mundialmente,tambin quiero aclarar que hace mucho que no veo a un argento  destacarse en los juegos olmpicos de no ser la basura del soccer .|`|biPz9jqdaa	No sabes lo mucho que me molestan este tipo de preguntas.    Tanto el futbol americano, como el rugby (AS SE ESCRIBE, PARA LOS QUE NI SIQUIERAN SABEN ESCRIBIR), son deportes de contacto, y como todo deporte, son hermosos. De hecho, todos los deportes son hermosos. Lo nico que afea al deporte, es la gente que corrompe la escencia del deporte, y dentro de esta gente pueden exisitir jugadores, entrenadores, administrativos y aficionados. Y los aficionados tenemos una gran responsabilidad al respecto. No es por nada, pero los aficionados del soccer han demostrado en continuadas ocasiones que no conocen, no aman y no respetan a su deporte que tanto dicen querer. Pero la falta de respeto, adems la extienden a pases, razas y religiones. Creo que a ningn deporte le hace falta este tipo de aficionados, y sin duda, aqu en este foro, no nos hacen falta este tipo de preguntas que slo generan el odio racial entre dos pases que se suponen deberan ser hermanos.    Yo respeto a los argentinos, an cuando ellos, en innumerables ocasiones me han insultado sin conocerme a fondo. Los respeto, ms no los estimo, ni me caen bien. Sin embargo, porque los respeto, no voy a contestar sus insultos en este foro. Pero slo les pido un favor: el nombre de mi pas es Mxico. As se escribe. RESPTENLO POR FAVOR, Y TENGAN LA DECENCIA DE ESCRIBIRLO COMO NOMBRE PROPIO, CON LA M MAYSCULA.    Yo no entiendo como dicen ser un pueblo tan culto y educado, y vienen a los foros y cometen tantos errores ortogrficos que merecen ser calificados como horrores.     Y por ltimo, si se van a estar ofendiendo e insultando mexicanos y argentinos, por favor, vayan al foro del soccer, que es el lugar adecuado para hacerlo, pero no en este foro de futbol americano, pues no refleja el tipo de aficionados que somos los que nos gusta el deporte de las tacleadas.|`|gd7E8ylaaa	Te parece que el rugby es un deporte de nenas?

Adems, como bien han destacado previamente, en el rugby no se utiliza ningn tipo de proteccin ms que un protectro bucal. Y eso hace que haya que estar muy bien preparado para recibir golpes, por lo que se debe ser bastante hombrecito.    Por el contrario, en ese ftbol inventado por los ESTADOUNIDENSES (y no americanos, porque yo soy argentino y tambin americano), deben utilizar todo tipo de protecciones (casco, hombreras rgidas, y hasta por poco cinturn de seguridad), por lo que demuestran que muy "machotes" no son.    En fin, no s para que gasto mis palabras en un espacio provocado por alguien cuyo pas NO FIGURA en NINGN tipo de deporte competitivo. De hecho son los hijitos tontos de Argentina en todas las disciplinas en las que compiten.     Y no gasten palabras escribiendo estupideces como "Brasil tiene de hijo a Argentina en el ftbol", porque si bien puede ser cierto (aunque en el historial slo llevan dos victorias ms que Argentina, y Argentina en mundiales deja afuera a los cariocas), mjico (escrito en minscula en forma adrede, porque son MINSCULOS) no nos puede ganar ni aunque jueguen 22 contra 11.     Chao, mejicano "estadounidense frustrado" y lustrabotas infeliz.      AGREGO, adems, para el admirador de los ingleses que contest posteriormente, que mjico (minscula), se podr destacar en esos deportes como golf (?encima femenino!) (que ridculo, ni siquiera saba que exista esa competencia, ja) o en alguna disciplina olmpica, como correr. Pero en deportes de equipos, que son los que arrastran a la gente y los que mucha ms popularidad tienen, mjico (minscula) NO EXISTE. Argentina los baila en todas las disciplinas. Y le recuerdo a ese pancho villa frustrado, adems, de alfunas personalidades del boxeo argentino, como "Locomotora" Castro y Carlos Monzn (y hay muchos ms), que todas las ma?anas se desayunaban boxeadores mejicanos antes de salir a entrenar. Ambos fueron campeones mundiales, y, repito, esos son slo DOS EJEMPLOS, puesto a que HAY MAS BOXEADORES.     Por otra parte, y slo con el fin de brindar un ejemplo ms, en relacin a las competencias olmpicas, recuerdo que en basket, el equipo argentino le gana hasta a el "dream team" de los yanquis sacados de la NBA. ?mjico tiene algn jugador de basket en la NBA?

aKk2yyu0aa	I think Romo will put up better numbers. One thing you do not mention is that the Lions O-Line is horrible so Kitna will not have all that much time to find Johnson and Williams.  I think Kitna the potential of a better offense if the line problem is ever addressed.|`|4da00b977a794eba3578530ea9ba8bacaa	Tony Romo don't forget Romo also has Jason Witten and that big O line in front of him to keep him upright.|`|kfZrKosEaa	by far this is easy. Romo. he is a better quaterback.  plus he has a better overall team. that plays a lot into it|`|WOza2TYMaa	It's tough, because Romo is the better QB, Kitna will definitely throw more picks, but Kitna has the opportunity to have more touchdowns and yards because the running backs are not good.  I'd go with Romo, though.|`|6dc3f9293c12f69abfd0fd232cf39605aa	I think Kitna will put up better numbers because he will have to throw so often because they wil probably be playing from behind quite a bit and he does not have the luxury of two solid RBs to ease his load and responsibility.  That being said I think both are pretty good and will finish the season in the top 10 for QBs.|`|3eb517b281fe3266df5d302e1221bafbaa	Romo is going to have the better fantasy season, sure Detroit will have to pass, since they will by losing by so much, but that also means more sacks, fumbles, picks, etc.  So depending on the league, those stats can hurt you.  Romo has a better receiving core, with owens and glenn.  Also looks who Detroit has to play twice, the Bears, they will just tear him apart, so for those two weeks they play.  Of course Romo will have his bad games, all QB's do except for Peyton, but Romo will be better this year, plus he wants to redeem himself after last year's botched snap in seattle.|`|AA10398624	The real question here is who will have the better FANTASY season.  Since that is the chat room we are in, I guess that was the question.    Kitna will have the better season!      Last year Kitna averaged 22 yards/game more than Romo.  Romo threw more TD/game than Kitna.  (remember Romo did not play first 4 games)    One big factor you left out above.  Dallas has a defense, etroit has NO D.  Hence the name etroit.  Detroit will once again be playing from behind in most of their games and abandon the run in the middle of the second quarter.  Kitna also has Mike Furrey who was SECOND in the league in receoptions last year.  So, this trifecta that Kitna has is stellar.  Only downside will be INTs where Kitna will have more than Romo.

Aprs tout doit tre possible mais personne ne l'a encore fait. Faut dire qu'une mle  7 doit pas mal souffrir.  Mais si tu regardes les gabarits et les qualits d'aujourd'hui, les 3e lignes pourraient jouer au centre.  D'ailleurs de plus en plus, les arrires peuvent jouer  l'arrire, en 3/4 ou en demi indiffrement(Mc Donald, Giteau, Rogers, Dominici, Clerc, Traille).

El futbol argentino se basa en traslado de la pelota y no en el desplazamiento de los jugadores, el toque preciso de la pelota es ms importante que la aceleracin, la tenencia celosa es ms importante que la recuperacin ... Argentina logr tener un futbol de pocas variantes pero con gran dominio de la pelota y mucha precisin.    Entonces los argentinos no tienen manera de contrarestar el juego brasilero porque deberan cambiar su propio estilo de juego para lograrlo. Para ganarles dependen, por ejemplo, de que Brasil entre en el juego de Argentina (estando Argentina muy precisa y concentrada al menos) o de que Brasil tenga un mal da o que sus jugadores estn a un 50% de sus posibilidades fsicas.

fTuEgEWiaa	I think he's gonna have a tough year. The O-Line hasn't imporved during the off-season, but perhaps the addition of Mat Schaub will help Green find some room.    Green is an injury risk as well and I'd be more worried about that if I were an owner.|`|WOza2TYMaa	I think that he's not going to have that good of a year, especially since Matt Schaub has not proven he can start a whole season.  You need a good passing game to complement the run game, which I'm not sure they'll have.  Speaking from a fantasy standpoint, Ron Dayne will get some carries as the power back and may take touchdowns away from Green.

h4TuAthfaa	Pues creo que nunca ha estado acabado, el campen del mundo parti como favorito y lo sigue siendo, es verdad que Hamilton es un hueso duro de roer, pero aun falta campeonato, creo que tanto Alonso como los hombres de Ferrari siguen siendo candidatos fuertes al ttulo, el campeonato est abierto y cualquiera puede ganar, todo el que conozca de Formula 1 sabe que de una carrera a otra todo puede cambiar, un despiste mas una victoria del rival pone todo muy cerrado, asi que ahora es que hay lucha, y claro que Alonso es candidato fuerte...  Saludos.|`|ynVmA09baa	Si considerais que ese es el resultado que Alonso buscaba es falso...ahora "escupir sutilezas" esta semana, para dar de que hablar en la siguiente carrera. Es un resultado que muestra que este a?o el Mundial es una tarta de 4...nada ms!!! No es el resurgir del Ave Fenix!!! Lo siento a los que lo admirais tanto...|`|ur6x9DfBaa	la verdad creo k hamilton se esta pasando de listo... mientras Fernando hace las carreras bien y limpias es decir sin movimientos antideportivos, hamilton, corre bien, pero alguna k otra vez le a exo alguna cosa a alonso en carrera. y weno la verdad sino fuese xk alonso a tenido algn k otro inconveniente mecnico, seguro k aora mismo staria primero. sigue as alonso y veras como ganas!!|`|6ldGQ3Peaa	Y se le ve muy tranquilo.

Nadie niega su capacidad de manejo, pero en cuanto a relaciones pblicas esta muy verde todava.  El problema es que l mismo se presiona y bajo la obsesin de ser el   1 (que ya no es) en Mclaren,  ha mostrado mucha inmadurez que le perjudica considerablemente.  Est evidentemente desesperado, ya que no hace mas que atacar al moreno Hamilton, quien, sin mucho hablar, se perfila como el prximo campen de la F1, aunque todava falta para ello.  No obstante eso es lo que pone en evidencia a Alonso.  Sinceramente espero que gane Hamilton para que Alonso madure y pueda ser un mejor competidor en un futuro.|`|gskl3Mnkaa	no te creas porq por una carrera alonso no este acabado.  ya veras...

ECW: I think Dreamer too old so CM punk will finally get that last push over Morrison.  ECW tag team: Big Daddy v would tear them apart.  Crown: The Game would never ever ver ever evr evrevrevr lose this.  United States: Ric is just to old, so M.V.P to retain.  Tag team turmoil: Make it a TLC MATCH! Then Hardyz will prob win.  Womens Championship: I think Melina ill win in a street fight she is more viscous.  Intercontinental: I said it before and I say it again; Umaga is to big for intercontinental champion, to good. So he would win as usual.|`|oxvu3yeCaa	not bad other than putting shelton in two matches give the intercontinental spot to someone else and you have a winner|`|uQRwshMHaa	go to wwe.com & see all the results|`|59JRBw73aa	this are coming up matchs  more on-www.smackdown.com|`|dYu8k0Eyaa	The Khali Kane and batista would be terrible even though thats the only thing smackdown has going for it    why tommy dreamer in the ecw champ match?  why not Marcus Cor Von Vs.

AA11689967	Well one way is to not hold on to the rim as much (if you grab it). If you dont do that then you can use some hand chalk.  Lebron James and Kevin Garnett use hand chalk and although your hands are a little ashy and you might not have as much grip on the ball, the contanct of the rim to the hand doesnt hurt as much and wont cause blisters|`|wukRaiUxaa	yes it does son.|`|52209998b664d1cb638373399bdf9245aa	stop holding onto the rim afterwards...|`|df194b8f796256e5bb8a369d888d6d46aa	use talc|`|tbg6oJX8aa	stop yankin your crank|`|8039be540df1845420248ce48f6ca331aa	Don't touch the rim of the hoop, just throw the ball down|`|M0rjeC5naa	Well judging as how your not supposed to dunk on every play, your are probably just trying to show off. A word of advice. Don't hold onto the rim to long, just about a second or half a sec. Also, try not to dunk as much, just cuz you can doesn't mean you have to. I can pretty much break anyones ankle when I play at the park, but that doesn't mean I take it to the rim all the time, I only take it to the rim about 25% of the time. I like dishing assists than scoring, I take more pride in assists than points. So Just dunk once, or maybe twice in a pickup game. It also helps to conserve your energy man cuz alotta times when you exert that much energy you tend to get tired by a 4th or 5th game.|`|cP1h4GdAaa	Don't dunk so much.|`|Wc1jYej0aa	the blisters will go away as soon as your hands develop the calasts. just keep rubbing lotion on them or use vasline..lol

Es muy importante que en el primer set siempre pongas el 60% del peso mximo, para entrar en calor y evitar lesiones.    Variedad:  Cada dos semanas debes cambiar de rutina. No permitas que el cuepo se acostumbre a una sola rutina, porque sino perder su efecto.    Dormir bien:  Despus de una buena rutina de ejercicio nos cae muy bien un buen descanso en la noche, pero recuerda acostarte temprano. Aunque parezca increble, los msculos no crecen en el gimnasio, sino en la cama al momento del descanso. Es importante que cuides tu descanso de entre 8-10 horas, si no descansas lo suficientes es como si no hubieses hecho nada.    Lleva el tiempo:  Tu rutina de pesas no debe pasar de 60 minutos, recuerda que queremos evitar lesiones. Tu debes es ir al gimnasio y en ese tipo hacer lo que debes hacer y listo.    Supervision:  A menos que tengas un sper habilidad para memorizar que has hecho cada das en el gimnasio, te recomiendo que lleves un diario y anotes el peso que levantaste y la cantidad de repeticiones que hiciste. Es bueno llevar un buen control, as vers y tu progreso|`|jAx76Mbraa	PRIMERO QUE NADA UN CHEQUEO MEDICO, PUEDE QUE NO ESTES CAPACITADO PARA ALGUN EJERCICIO EXTREMO, Y LUEGO ADELANTE,......|`|jvo5dCkpaa	k te guste y tengas ganas

Nothing.    Three people, including one innocent child is dead.   Chris Benoit is a coward who could not own up to his actions--he died a selfish man who hung himself to avoid a trial, prison and possible death by lethal injection.      In my eyes, anything he accomplished during his professional life means nothing.   He is no hero, he is a piece of garbage and I hope his last 24 hours on this earth were complete torture.

Ac07bz3taa	On sanctionne les plaquages et d'un autre c?t, on laisse passer les en-avant des All Blacks.     Le rugby moderne a bon dos. Ca va finir par ressembler  du spectacle, comme le foot amricain (mme s'ils ne font pas semblant de se rentrer dedans.)    A trop vouloir attirer le public vers le rugby, on va finir par dgo?ter ceux qui l'aiment depuis toujours et lui ont fait traverser les annes.    Je le reconnais, je suis en train de raler comme un vieux con. Mais le jour o on ne pourra plus vraiment faire mal  son adversaire sur un plaquage (rgulier, cela va sans dire), je jouerai au hand-ball...|`|83300d3cbe9bf29df2b2bfd1404eb4cfaa	etes vous joueur de rugby ?    tout ce qui va dans le sens de la protection du jouer est indispensable le rugby moderne et de plus en plus intense et un minimum de scurit s'impose, la stratgie a change voila ce qui fait que effectivement il y a moins de grandes  envols plus de combat au prs: c'est l'volution moins je prfrais plus de  crativit|`|JeBdGbwjaa	Il est toujours possible de plaquer un joueur en le soulevant...  La sanction (carton jaune ou autre) porte sur le fait de soulever le joueur et le retourner (tte vers le bas). Ici, le plaqu risque de retomber sur la tte ou l'paule, ce qui peut engendrer une trs grave blessure voire un handicap (clavicule ou acromion cass, paralysie).  Ces plaquages sont fortement rprimands durant les matchs.  Ensuite, cela dpend du jugement de l'arbitre au moment de l'action.|`|e3cfa3212b3f1e22526595c4b899ca5baa	il y a beaucoup plus de svrit sur les placages car on s'est rendu compte que c'tait la phase de jeu qui occasionait le plus de blessures graves devant la mle. Il est demand aux arbitres de punir trs svrement les plaquages en cathdrale. Cela va dans le sens de la protection des joueurs  Mais si pendant un match il y a un placage soulev et que le joueur accompagne bien le joueur au sol, il n'y a pas vraiment de raison de siffler une pnalit et de sortir un carton. A contrario, il est possible de mettre un rouge direct sur une phase de jeu vraiment dangeureuse|`|3bfd58a146afb7d862388c77c86454b6aa	c'est vrai que c'est nul de santionner les plaquages, pour moi, il faut juste svir au niveau des plaquages hauts tel que les cravates|`|f4c5a06c19216c969fe107cca15443b0aa	warf warf warf    Ce n'est pas parce qu'on sanctionne maintenant les cravates et autres chatdrales, plaquages sans ballon, plaquages  retardement ou plaquages en l'air d'un carton jaune que cela change le rugby:    1/ ils ont toujours t sanctionns:  l'poque romantique une cravate dclenchait automatiquement une gnrale... mme si j'aimais ?a, je prfre un carton, ?a amnera plus de jeunes  notre sport    2/ il est toujours possible de faire (trs) mal sur un plaquage, sans pour autant mettre en danger l'adversaire (un arrt buffet comme celui que Collins a mis  Chabal le prouve: parfaitement rgulier).     Pour info, la violence de l'impact d'un plaquage dans un match de haut niveau est gale  celle du choc que subit votre corps si vous vous mettez au volant d'une Clio, attachez votre ceinture, et foncez sur un mur  80 km/h. Un coup port au mauvais endroit avec cette violence peut-tre mortel.    Le combat dans le rugby doit rester encadr par les rgles mme non crites: mes gosses commencent  jouer et si je n'ai pas envie de les voir pratiquer un autre sport, je ne veux pas non plus les voir dans un fauteuil roulant.    Laurent    P.S.: la remarque "on sanctionne les plaquages mais pas les en-avant des all blacks" fleure bon la remarque chauvine du bourrin qui ne connait rien au ballon: le supporter idiot qui gueule au bord du terrain de sa voix pleine de vin chaud mais qui n'a jamais mis les pieds sur le terrain.

Hv496AkOaa	Of course they can have a winning season. All you have to do is move them from the NFL to the Big 12.  But knowing them, they'd probably lose to Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.  Looking at the Texans roster right now, I see 7 wins, maybe 8.  They have done nothing to address the offensive line and made David Carr the scapegoat.  They have no recievers past Andre Johnson and their defense is good but not great.  They're about a year or two away from making loud noise. They'll get a shout or two in this year, but not any major noise.|`|4a25a24be0ea3d5a331edb7fe19c6e6aaa	uhhh.... not a winning season, a tying season at best.... even tho dey got ahman green, da line will still be bad, but i think da defense will get better wit demeco ryans leadin da defense|`|3e9768577c4d7cc51dc244221c948c23aa	Not likely.

Now it is possible that it gives you a mental effect that may help like a placebo can for some people. If you want to save your back and shoulders then put them through proper training that is your best bet along with being sure you use proper technique.

VLS16mVraa	Well if you could tell me how many players in your league that would be great!!! Anyway here we go    QB -  Manning the best in the league. Should put up the same numbers year in and year out. He is a good selection, but if you took him anytime before 9 or so, its a bad choice. He will give you the 300 pts or around there this year.    RB - After Rudi your in some trouble. Bell/Jones shouldn't be starting in any league. Bell will be the starter for the first 6 weeks and he should be on the bench on most teams. You will need a better 2nd RB after Rudi.     WR - Not as good as people might think. Ben should have a good year, but watch out for Holmes. Ward will put up his numbers like normal, but after that, I wouldn't expect more than 160 FF points this year. Moss is even scarier. Brady spreads the ball around so much that he won't put up those numbers that are expected. He will go to Moss for a bit more than most players, but still expect Brady to throw the ball around a lot. Branch is probably your best. Hasselback is a good throwing QB and Branch should see the result of that.    TE - Its the only target in BAL. Its a nice choice and McNair always likes to find his TE in the endzone.     K - Its a kicker    DEF - After the top 3 (SD, CHI, BAL) this is the next best defenese. DEN with the addition of Bly, should stop the passing game dead in its tracks. Also with DJ up the middle, the run should be a hard place to go also. Expect DEN to be a really good DEF this year.    Overall its a 6/10. You have some good spots, but after that, your really struggling. A big hit is Bell/Jones being your second RB. I don't know your points, and i'm figuring its a private league. I wouldn't be looking for any place above 4th maybe 5th. See if you can get some value out of somebody on your bench and get a better 2nd RB.    Good luck!!    Edit: Ok 12 people private league...Interesting. Ranked 3rd? The season hasn't started yet. It could just be where you are placed in the league spot. Anyway even though the projected FF points say one thing, the reality might be something else. Bell will most likely be the starter for the first 6 weeks, and then Jones probably split for most of the rest. Its a smart move to have them both, but without your bench, I can't really see if you can make trades.    Also in most places, once you have drafted you can't delete your team. It just makes it fair so that you can't draft, delete, and then have your friend pick up all your good players.|`|d66987418547d65e3d573a1602b64453aa	ecellent 10/10|`|Fotpsrx8aa	pretty good you could have better receivers and go with tatum bell because jones is hurt and tatum is suppose to start|`|484c8707aec4051305c3e097494da326aa	u have a pretty good team but i dont think its as good as mine. ur back up rbs r not good for fanasty and ur wrs could be better

50540febaba7a41f5e73641e8ff8b574aa	You should get rid of all three. Droughns for the obvious reasons, he's playing fullback and Ward is the number 1 guy now that Jacbos is out for a little while. Devin Hester will be involved in the offense but still limited. He's currently the 4th or 5th receiver. And Troy Williamson is not a great receiver. He has butter finger hands.    Check your wavier wire and/or free agency and look for these players to add: Arnaz Battle (WR), Derrick Mason (WR) or Demetrius Williams (WR), Brandon Marshall (WR), Derrick Ward (RB), Chris Brown (RB).

Concernant Ciss il n'a pas le niveau aujourd'hui et pratiquement tous ses buts marqus prcdemment sous le maillot bleu taient face  des adversaires de faible niveau mais ce qui joue en sa faveur c'est son envie toujours entire de se donner et se dvouer totalement lorsqu il porte ce maillot contrairement au maillot phocen qui apparement ne l'inspire gure  redoubler d'effort.  Et pour Vieira, c'est honteux de se poser la question. Souviens toi de sa coupe du monde, il a marqu et fait autant de passes dcisives qu'un milieu offensif super efficace alors qu'il est rcuprateur. Et tout ?a sans parler de ses qualits de milieu dfensif qui ont permis avec l'aide de makll de museler les brsiliens au point de rendre quasi inexistante l'armada offensive brsilienne. Certes il a t trop souvent bless depuis et on a bien vu contre l'Ecosse qu'il n'tait pas totalement remis et donc forcement pas encore en pleine possession de ses moyens. Mais ce joueur de gnie a toujours t l lors des grands rendez vous il suffit de regarder son palmars impressionnant!   Vieira est donc indispensable dans le groupe france aussi bien sur le terrain que dans les vestiaires.  Mais concernant l'attaque des bleus je t'accorde que Benzema, Nasri et Ben Arfa valent bien mieux que Ciss et Trzguet  l'heure actuelle, et heureusement nous possdons un entraineur qui n'est pas ignorant quant  l'closion de ces jeunes talents trs prometteurs.  Et n'oublions pas Govou qui aura mis presque10ans  clore mais qui laisse aujourd'hui,  28ans, envisager une fin de carrire au plus haut niveau.    Et reste  voir ce que donnerons les Gourcuff, Menez et Gouffran qui devraient aussi exploser au plus haut niveau d'ici peu.

First of all, I agree about your other post about "total points" not being a measure of who the greatest scorer is, though it does mean something, since it does combine scoring with longevity.  <br>  <br>  As for the Laker fans thinking everything is a diss towards Kobe, I see what you mean.  I mean you didn't even mention Kobe in that post, and they're getting all defensive.  Kobe ranks 24th all time in points scored, but 9th all time in ppg.  One would think that by those numbers, your arguement actually favors players like Kobe since they're higher in ppg than total points, and would more be a knock on Kareem and Malone.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Dude, I'm not insecure it's just everything Kobe achieves you have to ALWAYS down play it like it's nothing.<br>  <br>  If Wade was on that list, I bet you would be prasing him all day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: STFU GTE.

When in reality, he's probably the greatest player of all time (i think there is better competition now days as compared to when Jordan played, not a knock on MJ I still think he's second best)  And he is one of the best team players in the NBA today.  He's averaging over 5 assists per game and is leading the most-balanced team in the NBA to the best record.  What more do you want?<br>  <br>  Its just frustrating to hear ignorant people say Kobe sucks and all that BS because people need to realize we are all witnessing greatness that does not come around very often.

Saying 5 years is long enough for Rafa to win the league, conveniently forgetting it took SAF 7 years.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Yes, they did well.

AA10068004	Since you can only have 16 on the roster once Sharp comes off IR, who are you going to get rid of?<br>  <br>  One thing I would suggest, and this is only if he is available.... see if Clemmensen (NJ) is available. I noticed people have been dropping him today on Yahoo fantasy. He is only going to minors until after trade deadline and with Marty just coming back Clems will still get a decent amount of playing time. He did very well for NJ. This is of course only if he is avail and your looking to carry 3 goalies.|`|Q6fuBhPZaa	your team looks good   but you can still check your stats and see whats holding you back<br>  <br>  <br>  oh by your team looks good I mean your skaters     Rinne is your only constant goalie
wBGjks5uaa	Most likely the Suns. The Spurs, Jazz (since they have boozer back), Hornets, Nuggets are all set. The Rockets will make it because they still have Yao and Artest, plus Battier is a solid defender. The Blazers are in because of all the talent they have and the Mavs will pick it up, because of their 3 superstars.|`|P93I8CHtaa	suns<br>  <br>  semms pretty obvious that the spurs and nuggets will stay also|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	The Dallas Mavs.|`|67EaIAvbaa	rockets..no mcgrady..they are done.|`|dDhTMacAaa	I think it will be the Suns.<br>  <br>  They are back to an up-tempo style but don't have the shooters they used to or Amare Stoudemire.<br>  <br>  They are still disinterested in defense and that will bite them in the back-end now that they aren't dominant scorers.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Spurs, Suns are done|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Suns,spurs,blazers|`|oxeMPxT0aa	I say the Suns.

xQgciq09aa	Their defense has improved so much, since the trade, I think they have a shot at finishing in the top 4, maybe even as a 3 or 2 seed.<br>  <br>  Nobody will catch the Lakers though.|`|dDhTMacAaa	I think Houston finishes sixth.<br>  <br>  The injuries have hurt them and I think they will finish just past the top 5 but sneak past two teams that underachieved.|`|q2EafutHaa	I think they'll end up in 5th place. They're on a 5 game winning streak without Mcgrady so they should be fine. I think they'll play portland.|`|NEtVRjplaa	I think the Rockets will be in 6th place, putting them against Denver Nuggets.|`|bABkMrADaa	they will be 5th|`|wTVZYQwlaa	they wont make the playoffs without T-MAC he is houston look at him last year he put the whole team on his back and they were still winning with out that "china doll" now mith no t-mac no playoffs its simple as that ron-ron is good but not good enough to be a leader and "china doll" is going to have a nother injury buy the end of the season.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	Unless another injury to one of their key players comes up, they are on pace to win 5th seed in the West.<br>  <br>  Because according to the playoff seedings rule, the division winners are guaranteed to have the top four seeds regardless of their records. <br>  <br>  Houston (5th seed) actually has a better record than the Blazers (4th seed) by one game. But the Blazers lead their division which means they get one of the top 4 seeds. <br>  <br>  Houston will be facing the Blazers in the first round. <br>  <br>  And I think they can beat the Blazers in 6 games simply because they are a more experienced playoff team and they play great defense which wins playoff games.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	6th place Spurs vs Rockets at 1st RD|`|wl4XUhLtaa	8th and face the lakers|`|Qyk0Rdu5aa	6 and will face nuggets|`|xOvMH412aa	1st|`|21J0IIZbaa	They will go out in the first round against the Lakers in 4.  1st vs 8th
AA10043476	I know Kurt Angle will not be going back to the WWE anytime soon. He has stated as much numerous times. The WWE will not allow him to work a limted schedule. Simple as that. <br>  <br>  You might see Sonjay Dutt on WWE TV in a year or so but I truly dont believe anyone from TNA will be going to WWE anytime soon. Petey Williams will most likely come back to TNA. You have to consider the fact that most of the guys in TNA are down on jumping ship because they havent seen any x TNA guys besides CM Punk, Even Bourne and MVP get any kind of push. Not to mention everyone was dumb founded at the return of Christian which was border line pathetic. <br>  <br>  If i had to take a guess over the course of the next year. <br>  <br>  TNA to WWE Sonjay Dutt and Lance Hoydt (Vince likes his size)<br>  <br>  WWE to TNA <br>  I think you'll see Nathan Jones (who already signed his TNA contract), <br>  <br>  Chuck Palumbo - already made deal just waiting to sign the contract<br>  <br>  Bobby Lashley - Verbally committed to TNA after he has tested the waters of MMA. <br>  <br>  Elijah Burke <br>  <br>  Paul London<br>  <br>  I have heard rumors of RVD and TNA due to the mited schedule RVD favors. That would be HUGE for TNA. <br>  <br>  Also I have heard rumors of Tommy Dreamer maybe working TNA.

kGXU1Dotaa	He'll have a great yr this yr i really belive he will Arod don't need steroids why he did it still baffles me.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	How is he proving he is good even without steroids?  Yeah, he played well today, in a game that doesnt matter, but how does that prove he isn't on something?  What proof is there that he's not on HGH or something else that's undetectable?  He's lied and cheated so much, that I don't believe a thing he says anymore.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	But the steroids he took gave him an edge.   Even after stopping the specific steroids he too, he would retain 80% of the gains. <br>  <br>  So he cheated and is still reaping the rewards.|`|62c73d4f4e3fb973d1175efbe209c74baa	But the failed steroid test took place back in 2003.  He was probably clean last season too.  Keep in mind that there have been penalties for steroid use since 2005.  I wouldn't be surprised if he stopped between then and now.  <br>  <br>  But perhaps most importantly, who cares about spring training?  We've known about A-Rod's awesome ability since he was in high school.  One spring training game won't change anyone's opinions.|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	Yes. I was impressed.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	YES. This is his redemtion season! If you look at his pattern, then this year should be an MVP Year or really close.|`|CshFQShGaa	Nothing that happens in spring training games matters, good or bad. The stats don't count, the pitchers he's hitting will be bagging groceries in about 2-3 weeks, and no one will remember it after SportsCenter tonight.|`|UR0kWdQdaa	You don't know he's not on steroids still. It's hard to believe any player, they all lie. A-roid lied back in 2003 so who knows, could have taken them since.<br>  I bet he's still a roid boy!|`|VeJ1niiMaa	I think today is great start in trying to redeem himself even if this homerun didn't count. He still has a lot to do to gain back the respect of baseball fans.|`|AA10252869	Yes he is great without steroids|`|i9eAnKsBaa	get over the fact a-rod used steroids|`|b4mDpU4faa	yeah dat is pretty good and plus it was without steroids so yes he did da good|`|i4DRfoboaa	its good|`|nH8AV9Soaa	not that much. if he keeps it up in the regular season then he will|`|W44q5AUhaa	i would love to answer your question. but, who is this A-roid you speak of?
Fl4b4Yd4aa	Mcnabb hes a lot better does more with less|`|8H4loaiVaa	Rivers. Both have good Running backs but I think if LT left Rivers would be fine but when Westbrook is out McNabb has a bad game. If it weren't for Westbrook McNabb would've been gone from Philly a couple of years ago. If you notice the teams that make it a point to take Westbrook out of the game win the game.|`|HUtskwSUaa	Philip Rivers runs his mouth too much, I just can't stand the guy and wouldn't want him on my team, McNabb doesn't seem to be too smart at times, but he is very skilled even at his age, and when surrounded by good players he does a good job.|`|KbGNCdWLaa	Two biggest losers in football right there...<br>  <br>  which std would YOU rather have, syphilis or gonorrhea?<br>  <br>  You know what?  I stand corrected.  Rivers is Herpes.|`|pMr6Cdl3aa	Neither to be honest.. But If I had to pick it would be McNabb. He's alot smarter with the football and has done more with less talent.|`|MCHIPQa0aa	DONOVAN MCNABB  BECAUSE HE IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE BEARS HAVE|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Ugh, I hate both of them! Rivers I guess.|`|J6grdba3aa	rivers. he's younger ad hasn't been hurt as much. plus donovan is a baby!|`|EArmnY05aa	I go wit my brutha, day to meny whyt qb. da blacks is betta dan da whyts.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Rivers because McNabb has been to the big game too many times just to choke. At least with Rivers there is something to hope for, with McChoke you will get to the Championship game but know your going to loose. Plus McNabb acts like a fool when he's winning, doing the moonwalk making stupid faces playing with his buddys on the sideline, man, when is he going to come out of the closet?|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	wow, phillip rivers a thousand times over, mcnabbs a choke artist. i think hes practicing his choke technique again as we speak|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Rivers.  He's a better passer and he's younger.  McNabb is more mobile, but he's getting up there in years and who knows how much longer he'll be around.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Between just those two I would say Rivers. He's younger and has more up side than McNabb. Neither has shown that they can win consistently in big games.|`|fQIxah8laa	Phillip Rivers. Although I like Mcnabb but Phillip is younger.|`|wbIEau0qaa	mcnabb, rivers is a cry baby, you'll turn rivers would cry a river if he played in philly|`|nAtBuBRhaa	Well, I'd rather have McNabb on my team for different reasons, and I'd rather have Phillip Rivers on my team for different reasons. First off, I think McNabb is a good leader, but everyone in Philadelphia hates him, and I think he can't play with pressure on him. And Phillip Rivers has so many weapons that make him look good that he doesn't really need to try. But, don't get me wrong, he's probably a good quarterback. But, throw him on the Lions or some team with not that many weapons, and see how he performs then. I would take McNabb from what I've seen: 5 NFC Championships with no Pro Bowl receivers (Besides T.O. one year), playing the Super Bowl sick and almost winning. And they are both real hard workers, but McNabb is just more experienced, and I'd take him and throw him on a team with some targets and win a Super Bowl.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	Rivers...  rush limbaugh said it best a long time ago about mcnabb.<br>  <br>      that retard dont even know the rules..<br>  <br>  <br>    theres an overtime??? der...|`|JTSNljLhaa	lets see if i say Rivers i will get a bunch of thumbs down but if i say Mcnabb i will get even more thumbs down....how about both on my team................... or better yet none of them|`|fAMpj8s2aa	rivers. black qbs have an awful record when it comes to leading a team to superbowl.|`|wd9EPcGWaa	Phillip Rivers... younger|`|AxeOdUFQaa	mcnabb|`|RQ42DjcCaa	Rivers by far.

Le systme utilis demandait qu'une diffrence individuelle se fasse (elle n'a pas eu lieu...)  Ne faudrait-il pas jou avec 3 dfenseurs, 2 milieux dfensifs, 3 milieux offensifs et 2 attaquants contre se genre d'quipes ?... A quatre derrire, je pense pas que c'tait ncessaire...  Tout le monde croit que les Pays-Bas vont attaqu plein pot...

55833baa318dbad677efdb3bbd677ccfaa	Absolutely, it's a good time to give the NL Central some respect. It seems to go in cycles. Back in 2004, the NL West was being battled over by teams with records under .500 (sound familiar?) and the MLB's best record was in the NL Central (the Cards) and the NL wild card came from the NLC (Astros). It does seem like in both leagues, the middle of the country is looked "down at" from both coasts. Whatever. That's fine. I'd rather take someone by surprise.|`|AA11600032	The reason the NL Central has been so weak is because it has the greatest amount of teams in its divisio. Anyone could walk away with that division title due to the amount of games they have to play against each other.|`|KPLDOfxxaa	The NL Central is like the AL East GOOD|`|xqxBe9VQaa	yea the cubs are 1 of the best in baseball...... the cards and brewers are strong...... and even look at the reds and pirates their both close to .500........everybody says the nl west is so great and the division leader is 1 game under .500......    :)|`|AA12040384	Well,I believe it is a weak/soft division.  I mean instead of 6 teams fighting for first,it's really only 3:Cubs,Cards,and Brew crew.|`|VwccuEFHaa	yeah ive been getting sick of hearing that the nl central division is weak.  Every year the cardinals got to the playoffs, the general conception is that it was only because the nl central is the weakest division.  Sounds kinda weird when the two teams in the nlcs were both from the nl central in 05 and 04, and one from the central won it all in 06.  They are definately one of the best divisions in the majors, and if the american league didnt dominate interleague play, they would be the best.

mP5v0damaa	Bonjour, cette question est finalement difficile, nous savons tous que les lois du sport ne rpondent  aucune logique, la beaut du football : "sur un match tout est possible".    Si nous prenons le rsultat brut de cette Euro, il est clair que nous sommes infrieurs  ces deux nations, puisque la France s'est incline lourdement face aux Pays Bas, et logiquement face  l'Italie.     Mais si nous cherchons bien, nos bleus sont-ils rellement infrieurs  ces deux nations, comme on dit souvent dans le football, "sur le papier" ? Sommes-nous encore plus nul depuis leur limination ?    Notre chec cuisant est le rsultat des errements de notre cher slectionneur :    - incapable de mettre en place un systme tactique efficace,    - une vraie slection de l'quipe de France. Pourquoi "une vraie", en slectionnant bien sur nos meilleurs joueurs du moment, en fonction de l'tat de fraicheur et surtout des performances.  En prenant dans le groupe des joueurs qui ne sont mme pas titulaires  part entire dans leur club, Malouda, Sagnol, Henry, Boumsong, Clerc, Abidal... la France n'tait pas reprsente par ces meilleurs joueurs, Sagna, Mexes, Flamini...    L'ossature base sur l'quipe Lyonnaise n'est pas une solution, Domenech veut-il mettre en valeur "marchande", les joueurs de son ami Aulas ? Malgr 7 ans de succs dans l'hexagone, les Gones n'ont rien prouv au niveau international. A l'indice UEFA, nous sommes loin des Italiens.     Au niveau du jeu, la Hollande a offert du jeu, elle est tombe sur une trs belle quipe Russe (dont l'entra?neur est le fin tacticien Hiddink), et  l'Italie une organisation.    Il faut galement rappeler que Domenech n'a jamais battu l'Italie en phase finale avec les Espoirs comme avec les A. C'est significatif de son manque tactique, et surtout de par ses changements il n'a jamais modifi le rsultat d'un match.

Je pense que lon peut comparer lensemble des connaissances dun tre humain  une sphre : Ce que lon conna?t est le volume de cette sphre et la surface extrieure est lensemble des points de contact avec linconnu. Plus on accumule de connaissances, plus le volume et la surface par voie de consquence sagrandissent.

A mon avis, c'est meme bien de se sentir dbutant car cela montre que tu as envie d'apprendre (les comptitions ne font pas tout !)..

Pour les pratiquants avancs, ne jamais tre satisfait et avoir toujours envie d'apprendre " ( Pascal PLEE fils du Respectable Henry PLEE ).    Mais aussi une citation d'un autre auteur sur le mot apprendre qui s'adapte bien aux arts martiaux :    " ce qu'on apprend sur un dojo c'est comme dans les livres qui sont la grammaire du silence, la le?on de lumire.

031d0da1f4db3c2cda415fd7cbd45254aa	Deja, le supporter Lyonnais a un nom: le Footix. Le Footix connait naissance sur terre generalement apres 1990, et ne connait donc dans sa pauvre existence footbalistique que les exploits de Lyon. Ajoutez a cela les journaleux de la France entiere qui band.. sur Lyon et comprenait donc que sans meme y reflechir ou se faire sa propre opinion, ces fameux Footix se retrouvent conditionne a supporter le Club de leur epoque. Les plus anciens des supporters du Football, qui sont nes avant 1990, ont une opinion du Football beaucoup plus pousse et un attachement a un Club beaucoup plus eloigne du "je suis pour celui qui gagne". On appelle sa des VRAIS supporters. Car ajoutez a cela qu'il existe aussi beaucoup de "Footix Post 1990", qui ne sont donc pas dans leur periode pre-pubere, mais qui soudain se trouve un engouement pour leur Club de Toujours qu'ils ne connaissaient meme pas avant le debut du Siecle, car supporter un club qui gagne a coup sur, sa fait toujours plus fashion selon eux que d'avoir une vraie ame de supporter, quelque soit les resultats de leurs equipes... Pauvre France.  Bref, les supporters Lyonnais sont donc compose a 70% de 5-18 ans, et a 30% de "Je decouvre le foot et je suis pour qui? pour Lyon bien sur". les vrais fideles sont ceux qui etaient deja a Gerland avant cette periode. on pourrait donc dire environ 40 000 personnes, mais Gerland faisait il recette y'a 10 ans?..?   Non vraiment, tout est inquietant dans le developpement mediatique de ce Club et dans sa decouverte de supporters sortis de terre voila 4 ans (Oui  4 ans, avant on etait sur de rien: 3 titres, c'etait pas assez pour se revendiquer supporters..)|`|7e8ba585dd88a7d915ca41e15637a5c1aa	sa les supporter lyonnais ils sont la que depuis 6ans quand lyon ne gagneras plus (bientot) il auront plus de supporter  moi je suis bordelais de la naissance a la mort|`|VypIYOrtaa	c est une quipe sa  ???|`|41bcc39f5a08b87d484871b72d9c73d2aa	Moi je ne supporte pas Lyon en particulier, mais je les supporte en ligue des champions car je suis fran?ais, et j'aime le beau jeu !  Autrement je supporte le MUC depuis 89 pour info.    Et avec Aulas quand est-ce que vous reconna?trez qu'il a tout compris au foot (comme Tapie  son poque !! Quoique lui, il tait de l'autre c?t des affaires...), en ne mettant la pression que sur ses paules au lieu du reste de l'quipe !|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	Perso je suis lyonnais, et l'OL, j'ai jamais supporte...

Ensuite, j'ai , comme ado, t fan d'une des quipes du moment: Paris et ses exploits europens  Depuis cet age l, j'aime l'OL (le club de ma ville) et le PSG (qui m'a fait vibr ado)   Mais je ne supporte pas que l'on traite de "footix" des supporters de l'OL. Dans tous les clubs, il y a des gens qui ne sont supporters que depuis qq annes, et je vois pas o est le pb.. Moi, je suis all encourager Lyon depuis 90 mais je con?ois que des spectateurs aient attendu que le spectacle soit  la hauteur, pas besoin d'tre un ultra pour tre supporter|`|c54c4aa381f196272ae7883c1bbe1596aa	Allez les verts !|`|Q2Ts9mD4aa	Whouahhhhhhhhh, quelle info, c'est norme !!!|`|cOGpQW8yaa	yen a qui supporte depuis 6 piges|`|18cebe5bddcf4324231849a5f41a5cccaa	Tu devrais changer de disque, tu deviens franchement risible avec tes questions  deux balles et ton aversion concernant les Lyonnais !!!

Moi, je suis comme toi, c'est--dire plut?t anti-Aulas. Alors bien s?r, il y a des gens qui vont me dire "quand mme il a construit son club il a bati un empire et tout ?a". Oui...mais  quel prix ? Il est detest de tous les supporters fran?ais hors-lyonnais, il est aigri, il ne choisit que des entra?neurs "dociles" pour asseoir son pouvoir au sein du club, il passe son temps  chercher des boucs missaires (bien souvent les arbitres d'ailleurs...) pour justifier tel but encaiss ou telle dfaite concde, il manipule la LFP et le pantin Thiriez, ainsi que les mdias sportifs. Alors continue  tenir des propos anti-Lyonnais et anti-Aulas, le temps te donnera raison...|`|e8pRsDsGaa	T'es un peu con toi. Tu dis qu'ils sont paranos parce qu'ils ont l'impression que tout le monde les dteste et en mme temps tu dis que personne les aime...  Perso j'suis pas pour Lyon parce que j'habite  Paris et donc je suis pour le psg (mme si l'autre avec sa thorie  deux balles sur les footix medira que ce n'est pas possible), mais j'admire Lyon et Aulas parce que c'est les seuls qui nous reprsentent en Europe.  Ensuite, mme si les gens supportent l'OL depuis que le club est champion ?a fait quoi? Les gens ne se passionnaient pas au dbut et supportent depuis qu'ils savent qu'un vrai club existe. On pourra savoir qui sont les vrais supporters pendant la priode o l'OL ne fera rien pendant 3ans de suite,  comme l'quipe de France o certains la supporte tout le temps et d'autre nous dise que c'est pourri que ?a les intresse pas quand on fait match nul contre la Suisse en Allemagne, et qui aprs le 9 juillet nous disent qu'ils supportent depuis toujours|`|yPZ8h5Byaa	Depuis qu'ils sont champion. Non je rigole moi c'est Paris et pour toujours mme dans l'adversit.    Je suis tout  fait d'accord avec toi pour ce qui concerne Aulas et les supporters lyonnais. Ils se prennent pour des stars alors que aucun grand joueur ne veut aller dans leur club. En Amrique du Sud tous le monde rve d'aller  Paris alors que Lyon personne conna?t.    Ds que Lyon vend un joueur pour une somme assez consquente, on dit que c'est un super joueur alors que dans leur nouveau club ils ne font rien. Avec des vrais joueurs et des vrais quipes on voit le vrai niveau des joueurs.|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Yop  Tiens c'est marrant de reprocher  quelqu'un de supporter un club parce que c'est le meilleur. C'est le lot de tous les clubs si on regarde bien, quand celui ci est en haut de l'affiche. Je me souviens, j'avais 6 ou 7 ans, c'tait la fin des annes 80, je commen?ais  m'intresser au foot, l'OM gagnait tout, avec mon frre nous avons support ce club... Et ?a ne nous a jamais quitt. Suis-je donc moins lgitime qu'un autre supporter ? Faut-il ncessairement supporter le club de sa rgion ? Ne peut on donc pas se prendre d'affection pour un club tranger ? Comment expliquer alors qu'il y ait un fan club fran?ais pour un club comme Aston Villa, par exemple ?  Bien sur, nombre de supporters Lyonnais le sont depuis le dbut de l'insolente russite de cette quipe. Mais c'est vrai pour chaque club, dans chaque pays. Regarde la popularit du Real ou de Manchester en Asie. Toute grande quipe au sommet de la gloire attire des hordes de nouveaux supporters.

On dirait un pantin dsarticul, il me faire clater de rire quand je le vois se dandiner comme une tap.... Enfin tu as l'air de trouver ?a beau.   A part ses coups de pied arrts, je ne vois pas ce que tu lui trouves ? Il a t priv de ballons et chaque fois qu'il l'a eu, il a essay de tirer et s'est fait contrer.  Comme Ciss, de la vitesse mais si tu ne le laisses pas dmarrer c'est un joueur comme un autre !!!  Les transversales de Scholes, pas vu beaucoup, la preuve il a t sorti par Ferguson.  Bref on a pas du voir le mme match, j'ai vu de l'ambiance, du rythme, des occasions, des "fausses-queues" (Ferdinand) et un but exceptionnel de Benzema.  Maintenant, on sait que tu n'aimes pas Lyon, ce n'est pas une raison pour les trouver inexistants et les autres trs bons. On verra au match retour, avec la dfense aux abois comme Manchester hier soir, il y aura peut-tre la surprise et non pas la "bra...> que certains avaient prdite pour le match aller comme pour le match retour.

Lyon a tenu en respect MU jusqu' les faire douter et perdre les pdales pendant un bon quart d'heure. Mme quand on aime pas une quipe il faut reconnaitre le bon jeu tactique de Lyon. ils ont su faire chec  Ronaldo, Giggs et autres. C'est un manque de concentration et la fatigue associ  la ruse des joueurs de MU qui a fini par avoir raison des lyonnais. L'avalanche de buts qu'on attendait n'est finalement pas arrive car il y avait une quipe qui jouait la prudence et une autre qui tait crisp par l'adversaire mais au final le bon jeu, l'efficacit a fini par faire dfaut aux lyonnais.|`|LCcu21nNaa	Ennuye? Mais le mot est faible!!!  c'etait  mourir debout  le match qui m'a plu etait AS Rome 2-1 Real Madrid. c'etait intense du debut  la fin.|`|edab8a6e6dd779c5494e3d10f916942aaa	Bonjour pas ennuye mais endormie oui!

En plus tu parles de beaux gestes de Ronaldo alors qu'il a rien foutu, il a juste fait quelques passements de jambes pour amuser la galerie.  Mais bon, aprs avoir lu tes autres questions, je pense que tu n'es pas trs objectif, tu dis ca juste parce que c'est Lyon qui joue....|`|9e36513a40f3e535ac69d53aa645afaeaa	Comme d'habitude, il est facile de critiquer mais si par bonheur Lyon est champion d'europe, Il y aura 60 millions de supportaires lyonnais dans notre pays. Je n'aime pas lyon mais en coupe d'europe je les supporte comme toute les equipes fran?aises.  Enfin pour faire un grand match il faut deux equipes car les deux equipes n'ont pas emball le match. Il fallait regarder Arsenal Milan pour voir un grand match avec du rythme meme sans but|`|d5c122bb0da8c311325ab02a03d8cfeaaa	Non pas du tout, les Lyonnais ont beaucoup donn, dommage que Fred soit rentr trois minutes avant la fin!

Bonne ambiance  Gerland et pour le rythme, je sais pas mais quand on voit Lyon dans la surface de MU et 5 secondes plus tard Mu dans la surface de l'OL c'est pas du rythme ?a?|`|0tJypYJyaa	C'est vrai qu'au niveau de l'intensit on a vu mieux, mme de la part de Lyon. Mais Man Utd n'tait pas dans un grand jour, notamment  cause d'un 4-5-1 pas spcialement habituel... Lyon avait ses chances en emballant le match... D'ailleurs c'est aprs une dizaine de minutes assez fortes ( un temps fort comme on dit de nos jours) que Benzema a marqu.   Dit comme ?a j'ai l'impression d'enfoncer une porte ouverte !|`|f75685c0f3362b9611b2893b6c7bd490aa	je m'ennuierai moins devant la bralne qu'ils vont prendre au match retour|`|VypIYOrtaa	u sava pas trop mal m si manchester se serait don un petit plus a fond sa aur t une avalanche de but|`|M2vr9ABqaa	Ennuys, non, absolument pas.  Il faut vraiment ne pas aimer les grandes comptitions  suspense comme la ligue des champions pour s'ennuyer.  Et puis emballer un match, si c'est pour donner du rythme  Manchester qui adore ?a et perdre, ce n'est pas la peine.  L'efficacit passe avant tout.  La preuve, tout le monde voyait une branle de Lyon, et ils ont obtenu un bon nul (Il aurait mme pu gagner 1-0).|`|rj6flKF9aa	Je ne suis pas du tout d'accord moi je me suis rgale avec l'excellente prestation de Benzema, l'efficacit de Toulalan ce que je regrette c'est l'absence de Rveillre au match retour mais je crois en eux.

Parce qu'ils sont persuads que c'est  Marseille seul qu'on sait jouer au foot.  1-1 face  Manchester c'est un bon rsultat mme  domicile.  Et puis ce fut un vrai match.  Pour preuve il y a eu but pour Lyon et Manchester a tout tent pour revenir au score et a russi.  Mais je crois que ce qui te d?oit le plus c'est que Lyon n'ait pas pris une vritable branle comme certains auraient souhait.|`|KIvxSCYUaa	mauvaise langue ! tu n'aimes pas Lyon alors tu les pourris ! ne serait tu pas jaloux ?!!! tu manque d'objectivit ! et mme si ?a ne te plais pas sache que Lyon est un grand club !!! et oui !

6fUxRdLqaa	Ils auraient raison. "Que 3 matchs  tirer avec un boulet, on sera dans l'quipe avec le prochain slectionneur".    Ils ont t bouds pour des raisons que je ne citerais pas, donc ils sont en droit de faire de mme.    Cependant, comme Domenech avouerait sans doute qu'il se soit tromp, ce serait gamin de leur part.     En fait, j'en sais rien.|`|4f7c784130ec3dd4f06d897acec05c70aa	pour repondre aux gars plus haut sur le refus de seection que dire alors de totti et nesta par exemple qui refusent la selection mais qui jouent en club, en plus a un exellent niveau encore|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Un joueur ne peut pas refuser une slection, c'est un rglement donc en gnral il s'agit d'un arrangement entre lui et le slectionneur.  Mexs sera videmment rappel, il est le rempla?ant tout dsign  Thuram. Son absence  l'Euro tiens plus  la difficult de le placer sur le banc de touche derrire l'indboulonnable Thuram.  Trzguet ne fais pas partie des plans et des projets de jeu des Bleus. Ce n'est pas une question de qualit mais de registre, je pense pas que la France ait aujourd'hui l'effectif pour exploiter au mieux Trzguet. Les Bleus ?a ne joue pas comme la Juve.  Zbina ? C'est dj une chance pour lui d'avoir pu porter le maillot national. Il ne s'est jamais impos dans un club mais par contre pur cirer le banc il est imbattable. Il fait partie de ces erreurs de casting des slectionneurs.  Giuly est un bon joueur mais est-ce qu'aujourd'hui il est meilleur qun Ribry ? Giuly n'est que rempla?ant  la Roma comme il l'tait au Bar?a. Et Giuly n'a jamais t un cadre de l'quipe de France.|`|2k08U0Zuaa	t'as oubli celui qui ferait le plus plaisir a sa femme... pires ;)|`|I42e6WpMaa	Je pense que si Giuly, Mexs taient rappels ils ne refuseraient pas et ?a ferait du bien  cette quipe d'endormis hyper protgs|`|THfAwixEaa	slt  @Martin 2 anelka a dja refus :  Anelka, ag de 24 ans, a refus une slection nationale avec les Bleus,  l'occasion d'une rencontre amicale face  la Yougoslavie.

On a pas le droit ! Y'a une loi qui protge les quipes nationales (cf. jurisprudence Makll du temps o Mourinho entra?nait Chelsea). Je trouverais que ?a donnerait raison  Domenech, ces joueurs seraient indignes de  porter le maillot bleu. On ne doit pas refuser une slection, ?a devrait tre le but suprme de tout footballeur.    @tr3m2kj: Oui exact, mais l'affaire Anelka est antrieure  l'affaire Makll (celle o Mourinho disait qu'il tait un "esclave" de l'quipe de France). Les rglements ont pu tre modifis entre temps.|`|DtAcrS3Yaa	ma premiere reaction serait du soulagement|`|89368382f623aa6b96b79e7c6191d89caa	La vraie question est pourquoi Mexes et Giuly n'ont meme pas figur dans la liste pour l'euro...Pas la bonne couleur? Pression des sponsors?|`|HCWBXYAXaa	Et Pirs|`|MJw3tCEnaa	Bien entendu qu'il va rappeler Mexs ,c'est maintenant  le bon moment  pour lui, il est devenu un peu plus mature...  Eventuellement Trzeguet si un nouveau systme se met en place  mais c'est peu probable. Pour les deux autres faut pas pousser. Zebina n'a jamais eu le niveau, et Giuly l'avait du temps de Jacquet, Lemere et Santini, cela fait  longtemps qu'il est fini.  L'avenir est avec les jeunes que Domenech connait trs bien. Laissons Raymond faire c'est le plus comptent. Qu'on arrte avec les Deschamps and co, sans Jacquet il n'existerait pas et en temps qu'entraineur il n'a rien prouv et est incapable de s'inscrire dans une continuit (pourquoi l'a t'on dgag de la Juve?) ,pourquoi ne fait il pas plus d'1 an? Monsieur ne veut pas prendre de riques? Domenech lui en prends...  Le seul handicap de Domenech est la blessure de Ribery qui  est un lment indispensable pour l'edf. Ribery aura un impact bien plus fort que Zidane sur le jeu de l'edf car il est bcp plus physique. Il va manquer terriblement  Domenech pour les matchs de reprise...|`|NLCai8iRaa	Tu oublies Platini,Giresse,Papin....|`|af85c115ba23447d8ca8af039e266310aa	Ce serait bien.

L'information a t annonce sur FR3 Nord - Pas-de-Calais ce midi et Puel sera remplac par Rudy Garcia, l'ex-joueur de Lille et entra?neur du Mans qui tait en ngociation avec ses dirigeants mais n'est pas parvenu  un accord.  Etant supporter lillois, je suis un peu d?u du dpart de notre coach mais aprs 6 ans de bons et loyaux services dans le Nord, on ne pouvait dcemment attendre qu'il reste chez nous 4 ans encore (le temps de construire notre grand stade).  J'espre que tout ne sera pas remis en cause au LOSC et que nous continuerons de progresser comme nous l'avons fait depuis une dizaine d'annes.  Je souhaite sincrement  Claude Puel de russir  Lyon, surrtout en Ligue des Champions (il a quand mme l'exprience de l'avoir joue  Lille 2 fois en 3 ans, nous avons mme jou un 8e de finale devant Manchester alors que nous tions trs loin d'avoir de gros moyens pour supporter la comparaison) et je souhaite aux supporters lyonnais d'apprcier ce trs grand entra?neur  sa juste valeur.  Vues les structures lyonnaises, son fidle public, pour peu que Lacombe et Aulas laissent un peu de prrogatives  C. Puel, il n'y a aucune raison pour que les G?nes ne tirent pas le maximum de ce trs important changement de cap.  Bons matchs  toutes et  tous pour ce soir.|`|tYcGBGLhaa	Pour moi, Claude Puel qui a deja annonce son depart de Lille|`|1048ea1f588c8e99b4ca71160b83f780aa	Cette anne l' ol va souffrir !!!|`|pEaMkIQBaa	Je dirais Didier Deschamps|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Je pense que ?a se jouera entre Claude Puel et Didier Deschamps avec un avantage au lillois mme s'il est encore sous contrat au LOSC.|`|dac222d4ef9ac4a84edddab9b8ed0ab3aa	Deja ils vont prendre un qui parle Francais, car tous les joueurs parlent Francais, donc ca limite deja a Blanc, Deschamps, Puel, Rijjkard.     Je sais pas si Laurent Blanc se plait bien dans le club un peu pourri de Bordeaux, donc je le verrai bien bouger vers Lyon.    Second favori serait Puel qui semble aussi rentrer dans le moule Lyonnais.|`|kt8nHK4Raa	IL PEUT SE BARRER LE PERRIN ILS NE PERDRONT PAS GRAND CHOSE. DOMMAGE J'AIMERAIS BIEN CLAUDE PUEL  SI IL POUVAIT SE DEGAGER DE LILLE.|`|4c5qWE1saa	Moi, je verrais bien Didier Deschamps...|`|t2H6u7Ngaa	Didiers deschamps pourrait prendre la place de perrin.

Rappelez-vous contre quel entra?neur il a perdu en finale: Jos Mourinho !|`|f7bc9c0dd1c101de64f7e811cb9f7be4aa	Claude Puel a t annonc,souhaitons lui bonne chance.
mK06dus9aa	Hey UC - Shame you missed the 1st half Juve virtually didn't touch the ball for 20 mins Chelsea 8 shots 2 on target plus 1 goal Juve 0,0,0. <br>  <br>  After the goal it was a different game and Juve came back at us but honestly to very little effect. This is a good spring board and we can score in Turin and go through. Ballack ran out of steam but when he went  off he had run 1km more that anyone else. Malouda continues to be crap. Anelka is a fish out of water when wide.|`|dd1c4772483cf17b8d588eaddff60b28aa	As I used to get on my school report sometimes ...<br>  <br>  "Could do better"<br>  <br>  Chelsea were excellent in the first half with most of the play but they trailed off in the second half with a few scares.  However, they are taking a 1-0 win to Italy - let's just hope that we get better as Hiddink's role progresses.  I do think he made a mistake with Malouda though.<br>  <br>  Please hurry up and get better Essien - we are really missing you!|`|tfotPdeZaa	Well I think Ballack just wishes he plays for Munich. They had an amazing win tonite :)|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Ballack is past his best.|`|b37h4lhcaa	did you see that tackle on nedved|`|a6ps7MH1aa	well im actually goin 2 answer d question yes ballack wasnt great he made a few mistake and if he hadnt they could have got another goal thank god drogba was given a chance tonight im glad scholari or howeva ya spell it is gone and anelka and kalou both played great in the 1st half in the 2nd half d ref was a bit unfair towards drogba i think juventus knew they had 2 *** out and play well which hurt chelsea's confidence a bit|`|8FM4OrT9aa	hey i think he wants to play for liverpool i hear his cousion is on that team and they r not half bad and he did ok i think they could have won a lot better then 1 - 0|`|duJgBxUoaa	^^Shup you racist cnut!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry i didnt see the match :)
ueXvEC5xaa	Les chos de recrutement sont plut?t interessants, reste malheureusement  conclure...    La cellule recrutement mise beaucoup sur des joueurs  fort potentiel. En revanche comme dit plus haut, les sommes des joueurs sont astronomiques... Certains prennent un malin plaisir  vouloir bloquer le PSG dans sa phase de recrutement...  Quoi qu'il en soit, si les principaux transferts se font se pourrait tre interrssant (Sessegnon, Basa, Briand, Guily (plut?t que Govou), et qui sait Thuram...|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Je crois que ?a va tre difficile. Faut qu'ils assurent ds le dbut, sinon ?a va gronder. Et le fait que les recrues tardent  arriver n'est pas fait pour aider  la prparation de l'quipe. En plus je crois pas que Le Guen soit l'homme de la situation.|`|VJjaxC70aa	Mdrrrrrrrrrrr d'avance !!!!|`|ghj36B4maa	rien pck si on continu comme sa on va jouer avec la reserve de l'anne passer|`|8b844b702a1517d664e1689d0b6830aaaa	pour l'instant il y a beaucoup de joueurs annoncs et peu d'arrives (sans parler des dparts de Dian, Yepes, Pauleta, Alonzo, Digard....)  ce qui m'inquite le plus pour l'anne prochaine est le prsident Villeneuve ; j'ai vraiment des doutes sur sa capacit  diriger un club de foot  A part ?a j'espre que le PSG fera, enfin, une bonne saison en championnat|`|lht40RMRaa	Avec Villeneuve, on est mal !!!  Avec Le Guen , on est trs mal !!!  Avec l'quipe actuel, nous sommes pas dans la merde !!!    Depuis quelques annes, c'est un calvaire d'tre supporter du P.S.G ...    Nous avons du courage, lol !!!  On devrait tre reconnu comme des vrais martyrs en ce moment, lol !!!|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Niveau recrutement pour le moment on a rien vu venir bien au contraire mme puisqu'on a surtout assist  des dparts. Les pistes voqus sont intressantes et moins farfelues que certaines qu'a pu nous sortir Villeneuve. Maintenant j'ai peur que le PSG se laisse encore aller a des transferts douteux, pas quant  la qualit des joueurs mais plutot au prix de ces transferts : Basa 8M, Sessegnon 10M, Briand 8M...   L'idal pour le PSG serait de vivre une saison tranquille en milieu de tableau histoire de s'viter la crise du bas de classement et l'euphorie du haut. De toute fa?on faut bien se l'avouer, le PSG n'a plus les moyens de viser le haut du classement !|`|yTj32jb2aa	Je leur souhaite de faire presque aussi bien que cette anne.      Juste une petite place plus bas ce serai parfait.|`|qwgtcqlKaa	Je supporte le PSG et ce qui m'inquite le plus, c'est que le PSG est en train de devenir un club comme Nantes, c'est--dire qu' force de jouer le maintien tous les ans et  force de dire "on est un grand club, on ne peut pas descendre", on va finir par descendre pour de vrai... Sinon, concernant Sessgnon, du temps ou il jouait  Crteil, je l'ai souvent vu jouer et je peux vous assurer que c'est un super joueur et je peux vous parier qu'il finira ballon d'or africain dans les 5 prochaines annes.|`|avQ8PbmBaa	Pour le moment pas grand chose ! j 'attend de voir le dbut du championnat avec l'effectif au complet car la c'est encore trs brouillon !    H&F|`|e8pRsDsGaa	Yves a: Mme une place plus bas le PSG n'aurait pas t retrograd vu qu'il tait 16e.  ti manol: Perso l'anne dernire je ne pensais que Nancy aurait els moyens de viser le haut de tableau, donc on verra bien.|`|x4lIR3mEaa	le PSG est trop inactif sur le march des transferts. et mme en recrutant d'ici l, les nouveaux joueurs n'auront pas fait la prparation foncire avec leur nouveau club et ce n'est pas l'idal pour tenir toute une saison.    nous n'avons malheureusement pas le choix, on attends en esprant que des recrues dignes de ce nom arrivent.....    PS : je pense que Sessegnon a un potentiel intressant et qu'il pourrait bien tre la rvlation de la saison avec Paris.....

Se for o maior clssico nacional, sem ser do Brasil, na minha opini?o  Real Madrid e Barcelona, ou os clssicos entre Milan, Inter e Juventus. Ou ainda River Plate e Boca Juniors.    Mas, se for entre dois times de pases diferentes, acho que  Milan e Real Madrid (o jogo entre os maiores campe?es internacionais), e depois S?o Paulo e Boca (os maiores sul-americanos).|`|ae564ea5798b94612eb3edd82d88c987aa	Vasco x Flamengo|`|MDcz1nMDaa	Milan x Liverpool.

Vive Bordeaux !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Z3kXbI2haa	Traditionnellement, et c'est encore vrai chez les amateurs dont les quipes n'ont pas beaucoup de maillots donc la numrotation s'arrte  des petits nombres, le numro correspond  une position sur le terrain:    1 - gardien  2 - arrire droit  3 - arrire gauche  4 - Stoppeur  5 - Libro  6 - Milieu dfensif  7 - Milieu gauche  8 - Milieu droit  9 - Avant centre  10 - Meneur de jeu  11 - Deuxime attaquant ou ailier    Maintenant, chez les pros, peu importe, ils choisissent le numro qu'ils veulent, mme si ?a n'a aucune signification : Henry est 14, Anelka 39... C'est du grand n'importe quoi. Zidane jouait 10 en quipe de France, mais on lui a attribu le 5  Madrid. Cela a t fait car tout le monde pensait qu'il prendrait le 10, donc beaucoup de maillots de contrefa?on ont t fabriqus avec le numro 10 et le nom de Zidane. A la signature du contrat, pour jouer un tour aux contrebandiers et viter de perdre de l'argent sur la vente du maillot, le Real a dcid de ne pas lui attribuer le numro 10; Zizou a choisi le 5. Voil comment ?a marche dornavant.    @BN: Ah si t'as peut tre raison ! Mais je sais que des changements de numro "habituels" pour des raisons que j'ai voqu existent. Pour Zizou tu as certainement raison malgr  tout.|`|ghj36B4maa	martin 2 t sur que la raison du 5 de zidane n'est pas plutot que figo avait deja le 10?|`|Jr3ypWinaa	Ouais il y a une signification !!!  Je sais pas exactement mais moi j'ai des potes qui jouent au foot et par exemple le 9 c 'est un attaquant, le 8 aussi mais le 2 c'est un dfenseur !!!  Je peux pas trop te renseigner plus que ?a !!!  Je suis pas une pro !!!  bisous !!!  bonne soire|`|51b03e8339c1e3ff06fe641d5edeb866aa	Poue l'Euro ou la Coupe du Monde, les numros sont attribus pour la dure de la comptition.  Seul impratif: le numro 1 doit tre attribu  l'un des trois gardiens.|`|af56642e7dbc6e645c50b44bda5c6fa5aa	HISTORIQUEMENT LES N CORREPSONDAIENT AUX POSTES (1 POUR LE GARDIEN , 2 ET 3 POUR LES LATERAUX , 4 ET 5 POUR LES ARRIERES CENTRAUX , 6 MILIEU DEFENSIF , 8 RELAYEUR , 10 MENEUR , 7 ET 11 AILIER ET 9 AVANT CENTE)     MAINTENANT ILS CHOISSISSENT  MEME SI CERTAINS TITULAIRES PRENNENT DES NUMEROS SE RAPPROCHANT DE LEUR POSTE|`|5dAqoPCkaa	oui et non il peuvent aussi choisir, je croie|`|4DEuPy96aa	Oui les numros qui sont marqus sur les maillots signifient la position du joueur sur le terrain.  De mmoire, le 10 par exemple jouera toujours libraux et le 5 dernier dfenseur. Tout dpend aussi de la composition, les fameux 4-4-2 et autres....Dans ce cas, il y a des petites nuances.    C'est plus simple pour nous pauvres terriens qui ne jouons pas au foot : tu vas en magasin, tu achtes un maillot, tu fais floquer le numro de ton choix et tu peux mme aller faire tes courses avec si ?a te chante. Pas d'obligation de rester sur un terrain hihi    Bon j'espre pas avoir dit trop de btises ....

Hmofgtbuaa	Excellent OOOoooooooo :)|`|0HmxjLEYaa	Nestor, tu as tort.  Contre Rennes et Nancy, l'arbitrage (ou plus exactement, les erreurs d'arbitrages) ont t pour leurs adversaires.  Mme si on peut regretter qu'une faute d'arbitrage en annule une autre, c'est plut?t quilibr en fin de saison.  A noter la conduite exemplaire de Franck Dumas (trop peut-tre d'ailleurs).  Pour reparler de l'arbitrage,  mon sens, ceux qui sont le plus  blamer sont les arbitres de touche qui ont moins de travail et moins de responsabilits que celui du centre, et qui ne sont pas meilleurs.|`|pc6Dp5Rjaa	Elle est vraiment nul ta question.

Z3kXbI2haa	C'est vrai que c'est con de dire ?a... J''aime l'OM, mais j'avoue que dire de telles choses  quelques jours de OM-PSG c'est n'importe quoi... Ce sont pas les pires dirigeants que l'Om ait eu, mais il y a moyen de faire beaucoup mieux. Ils feraient mieux de dsamorcer le truc, mais ils prfrent en remettre une couche. ?a frise l'imbcilit. Je n'ai pas vu le match de dimanche, mais apparemment l'esprit sur le terrain tait bon, c'est mieux comme ?a. Malgr les dcisions arbitrales controverses, en plus. On voit qu'il y a du progrs d'annes en annes, je comprends pas la raction de Diouf-Anigo dans ce contexte... Prochaine tape: stopper les jets de projectiles sur les joueurs parisiens qui tirent les corners. Cette attitude est dtestable.|`|qZRRg8heaa	Je pense effectivement que Pape Diouf nous prend pour des cons...

7ZvZOuGqaa	Je suis assez d'accord; Aulas est un escroc (mais il n'aura jamais l'envergure et le bagou de Tapie dont il n'est qu'une trs pale copie). Oui il torpille le recrutement de l'OM et se rend compte qu'il ne sait plus o il va avec son club...  Et il faut arrter de croire que Lyon a fait un cadeau  L'OM; ils voulaient se dbarasser de HBA et n'avaient pas de meilleure offre; c'est tout, sinon ils l'auraient vendu ailleurs...

Lyon a dj fait un gros sacrifice financier alors que des clubs europens auraient pays le double. Lyon ne fait pas de manires quand il faut sortir le carnet de chques au besoin, on ne peut pas non plus exiger que ce soit toujours le seul  consentir les efforts financiers mme s'il s'agit du plus gros budget de L1.  Il est possible bien s?r que dans les coulisses de l'OL on ait chang d'avis surtout que Puel semblait compter sur Ben Arfa.  C'ets dommage que les gos surdimensionns de Diouf et Aulas envenime l'affaire car le transfert aurait trs bien pu tre conclu d'ici  la fin du mercato, il n'y avait aucune urgence.|`|tvS6JnbJaa	Les ternelles pirouettes de Mr Aulas encore une, Ben Arfa tait ce matin  la commanderie  l'entra?nement esprons que Aulas n'es pas trop de pouvoir sur la commission.|`|e8pRsDsGaa	Moi j'aimerais bien qu'on arrte de toujours cracher sur Aulas ds qu'il essaie de faire quelque chose pour son club...

DuqWGoZ0aa	Henry est un snateur issu de la gnration 1998 (coupe du monde o il avait t tout sauf dcisif)!!!  Je le trouve limit dans le jeu, et son principal atout (la vitesse) semble l'abandonner au moment mme o il dcide de jouer dans un championnat moins permissif dfensivement et surtout dans un club o il n'est qu'un nom parmi d'autres, aprs avoir t le dieu des gunners et de tonton Arsne!!!  Le rsultat ne s'est pas fait attendre :  Une premire exprience en Liga mitige (tout comme son passage clair en Srie A)!!!  Henry ne brille que lorsque les autres le font briller!!!  Je verrai  l'euro 2008 un trident Benzema-Anelka-Ribery soutenu par Nasri, mais Henry est indboulonnable pour services rendus (et par crainte de Domenech d'avoir  grer son ego de diva sur-cote)...|`|aqCti9Cdaa	Les mdias lui ont largi le pantalon : ils lui ont lui ont insinu qu'il tait  aussi fort que Zidane; il a voulu confirmer leurs dires et s'en est all vtir un autre costume, le bar?a; seulement le costume tait trop grand pour lui. Henry est et restera un joueur d'1 seul club : Arsenal. Les gnies (Zidane, , Maradona, Ronaldo etc..) russissent partout. Ils jouent en smoking quand d'autres mettent le bleu de chauffe.  En 1 mot comme en 100: Henry pte plus haut que son cul.|`|b319e40a4cc46ce27d4857774273e7a7aa	Bonne question jpense que tu a raison henru et fait pour jouer en pointe|`|3HJt88t4aa	le problme c'est l'entraineur..   avec ces choix a la con!  dsol mais jlm pas|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Tu ne peux pas jouer avec deux buteurs en pointe. Trzguet et Ciss sont des buteurs, leur registre ne leur permet pas un autre positionnement. Et en tant que Buteur, Henry est le titulaire indiscutable du fait de son palmars et de son rendement.  Benzema lui peux jouer en pointe mais aussi en soutien donc il peut tre complmentaire de Henry. Je ne pense aps que le problme puisse venir d'un mec recordman de buts en slection !|`|nB8Eco0Caa	Henry, et Turan ils fouten quoi au bar?a, surtout Turan,  ou ils disent au bar?a, que c est le plus mauvais joueur,.|`|x4lIR3mEaa	tu as mis le doigt dessus !!!    le vrai problme c'est que Domenech ne veut pas remettre en question le statut d'Henry.    quel que soit le schma de jeu, il faut que celui-ci s'adapte  Henry et c'est une erreur.|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Moi je rvais de tester une doublette Benzema - Trezeguet, mais bon, tant pis, ce sera Henry.|`|ofX8kUHFaa	comme tu l'a dit je croie qu'Henry est fait pour jouer tout seul en pointe|`|5AhfKOCUaa	Benzma et Anelka s'entendent trs bien avec Henry. Pour moi il n'y a aucun problme Henry.    Trezegol c'est diffrent, c'est plus le jeu de l'EDF qui ne lui convient pas. Ce n'est pas un problme avec Henry.    Quant  Ciss, ce mec ne peut s'associer avec personne parce que c'est une quiche ambulante. Ciss ne peut s'associer qu'avec le banc de touche.|`|5natitcCaa	Je trouve que la meilleure association reste Henry et Benzema!!! Henry est un joueur qui aime recevoir le ballon dans les pieds et pas des centres de 30 mtres. Voil pourquoi il peut bien s'entendre avec des joueurs comme Ribry ou Benzema dans un jeu de passes courtes et PRECISES. Trzguet ne sait pas faire ?a et Ciss encore moins!!!!      J'imagine un trio offensif de l'quipe de France  la manire du Bar?a (des meilleurs jours bien s?r) : Henri (Henri) - Ribry (Ronnie) - Benzema (Messi)!!!!
Z3kXbI2haa	Salut Jack  J'espre que non, je les aime bien ces deux l, et je vois mal comment on peut faire sans Mexs. En mme temps il est sur la sellette le Raymond, donc il va devoir faire des concessions s'il veut rester en poste.|`|okIVrZyGaa	pour 13etgay je croit qu'il est temps   mais pour mex s il a encore quelques bouffees dans les peme|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Mexs a videmment sa place en Equipe de France, son absence  l'Euro est peut-tre d? au statut indboulonnable de Thuram, il es tplus facile de mettre Squillaci sur le banc de touche que Mexs.  Trzguet peut tirer sa rvrence. Il a dj 30 ans donc son avenir international n'est plus  long terme et l'quipe de France n'a pas l'effectif pour exploiter au mieux les qualits de Trzguet|`|99a1514860c9a253558b587d2a335c4caa	Tout d'abord, eh bien moi je suis TRES content que raymond reste  la tte des bleus. C'est une liquidation de plus de la maffia 98 (qui a impos Thuram & Co pour cet euro et qui a fait une campagne scandaleuse en faveur de Deschamps (Cf Zindane qui parle de "l'autre" ou de "celui qui est l" sans le nommer)... pourtant ce que je prfre chez Raymond c'est estelle. Mais qui  sa place ? Arsne, Blanc et Houiller n'ont pas voulu (logique) et Deschamps, il est entra?neur o dj ?  Bref.  Revenons...  Mexes : sera titulaire la prochaine fois. Il est indispensable mais tait barr par le duo Thuram-Gallas.    Trzguet : aucune chance, hlas, hlas : c'est un excellent joueur qui aurait pu faire la dcision face  la Roumanie ou les Pays-bas**, mais c'est un joueur de surface qui ne peut scorer que dans le mme schma tactique qu' la juve, c'est  dire avec deux super centreurs ; l'inverse donc de l'quipe de France qui ne joue que dans l'axe et repose sur cet imposteur* de Ribry pour essayer d'alimenter l'AC...      * imposteur, je prcise avant d'tre lynch, car il n'apporte RIEN  l'quipe de France, mme si c'est un super joueur au Bayern. Lynchez moi aussi : comme Zidane aprs 1998.  Je ne suis pas le seul  le penser, heureusement.  ** ben-j a bien raison : sur cet euro, Trezguet-Ben Arfa, c'eut t 10 fois mieux qu'Henry-Gomis|`|g22XZeWDaa	non pour moi treeguet vaut mieux que henry actuellement  tu nas qua comparer la saison des 2 joueurs    quant a mexes il peut toujours esperer|`|ac6b93cbce698bed54fdca2231c0d216aa	on a vraiment pas de chance en France; sakosy, domenech, ;c'est certain avec l'incomptent domenech mexes et trezegoal sont barrs ou plut?t mal barrs|`|34aabb69af2c0216ac78f8e1cd6a39e5aa	fallait pas coucher avec la mre Denis!!!|`|xvlmnTxZaa	Avec la tune qu'ils ont oui|`|NAsA7KKnaa	Je  suis persuad que Mexs finira par tre titulaire indiscutable.  On est pas le meilleur dfenseur  du calcio par hasard  ( dixit La presse italienne )|`|73149ee4acb395fceaf22ebd146f5e90aa	Pour Trzguet, son seul espoir, c'est de quitter le Calcio et d'aller  Lyon (et c'est pas impossible vu cette dpeche : http://www.football.fr/footballfr/cmc/sc...  Vu que Raymond ne prend quasiment que des lyonnais (cf Boom, Squilacci, Clerc,...) ou ancien lyonnais (Abidal, Malouda) qui n'ont strictement plus rien  faire dans l'EdF, ca pourrait etre bnfique pour Trez....   Pour Mexs, pour redevenir + srieux, je pense que RD n'aura plus d'autres choix que de le prendre et le faire jouer... Parce que s'il recommence avec une dfense avec Abidal dans l'axe ou Boom + Squillacci, je crois que j'arrete de mater les matchs de l'EdF.|`|2k08U0Zuaa	lol. Merci qui??|`|FODqOFnwaa	Mexes peut un jour esprer jouer en EDF, mais pour Trezeguet, c'est foutu ...........|`|xZEitwAqaa	pour Trezeguet c'est dj le cas|`|BT7PPmd5aa	sachant que domenech a t retenu pour continuer l'aventure a la tete de l'equipe de france trezeguet et mexes n'en feront pas parti dans un avenir proche    trezeguet pourrait tres bien mettre fin a sa carriere internationale    quand a mexes, il me semble encore un peu jeune !    ce que je trouve le plus bizarre c'est pourquoi mexes, trezeguet et flamini ( recemment transfre en italie)  n'ont pas ete retenu et coincidence evolue tous dans le championat italien.......aurait il une haine si tenace envers les italiens ? ou aurait il peur qu'il soit trop attach a l'italie et plus facilement corruptible ?

Z3kXbI2haa	Hh je crois que c'est un plan de Domenech de faire croire qu'on est nul. Comme ?a les Pays Bas vont tre surs d'eux et vont nous prendre de haut, donc on va les battre. Et en les battant on est quasi qualifis. on est ensuite capable de faire un nul contre l'Italie.    Ou alors on est vraiment mauvais, ce qui est fort possible...|`|b63dad4636b13552e531d43cf4bb85a1aa	l'inspiration des joueurs fran?ais c'est l'argent : pub sfr etc etc  le foot oui dans les grands clubs , l on se donne  fond car cela rapporte , alors que jouer pour l'quipe de france bof , fait trop chaud , le terrain tait lourd et ces roumains , c'est leur faute ils ont pas voulu jouer ben comme la france , elle a pas voulu jouer n'ont plus  Incapable de faire des vrais actions de bouger rien ,c 'est lamentable , le mieux qui puisse arriver ne pas tre dernier du groupe en tout cas l'italie et les pays-bas passeront|`|1048ea1f588c8e99b4ca71160b83f780aa	La Hollande a gagn oui mais contre une quipe  qui pratiquait le foot. Je pense que contre la Roumanie, ils vont rencontrer les mmes problmes que la France. Une quipe qui ne joue que la dfense, des joueurs magouilleurs qui tombent pour un oui et un non, des arbitres qui ne sanctionnent pas. Dans les six mtres de Coupet lors d'un duel de la tte, le bras du roumain sort de cinquante centimtres, la main cherche le ballon pour le mttre dans le but .Pour moi un carton rouge doit tre donn.  Quand le fran?ais veut ramasser le ballon pour jouer la touche  le joueur roumain pousse le ballon du pied volontairement   une vingtaine de mtres pour gagner du temps , l' arbitre devait donner minimum un carton jaune.|`|jfOmv82laa	sans vouloir para?tre pessimiste je pense que la France peut commencer a plier bagages  c'est franchement pitoyable que l'excuse de la France ait t la chaleur pkoi ne pas simplement admettre qui ont jouer trs trs mal?|`|67868ad91a17d5a08c4f98eded1b8cb9aa	En l'tat, oui la France peut se qualifier car, en l'tat ils sont pour l'instant 2e de la poule!  Domenech est un boulet pour l'quipe de France, sur ce point l, je pense que l'on ne peut qu'tre tous d'accord. Mais on a quand mme des joueurs de grande classe qui malgr leur gros boulet, arrivent  se hisser en finale de coupe du monde.  Le gros problme avec un selectionneur comme Domenech, c'est qu'il n'a aucune stratgie, et ?a se voit contre des quipes qui dfendent  10 derrire, comme l'a fait la Roumanie.  Rappelez-vous l'Ecosse galement, qui a du avoir 30% de possession de balle sur les 2 matchs, et la Suisse  la coupe du monde avant aussi dfendu sec. L'quipe de France est incapable d'attaquer contre ce genre d'quipe (la faute  Domenech videment)  Par contre, face a des quipes plus joueuses, ses attaquants peuvent mieux s'expriment, car que ce soit Anelka, Benzema ou Henry, ce sont des joueurs qui aiment les espaces.  Donc face  la Hollande ils auront des occasions de faire parler d'eux.  Aussi ne pas oublier que la Roumanie tait dans la poule de la Hollande en qualif, et que la Roumanie avait battu la Hollande  domicile, et avait fait match nul en Hollande.  Mais en cas de mauvais match cette fois-ci, il n'y aura plus aucune excuse  leur trouver, car la Hollande ne devrait pas jouer  10 derrire, et le match sera  21h|`|4174269741f58c994fee497ba0731d34aa	Moi je dis qu' la fin beaucoup fermeront leur claque merde !    A part Malouda qui ne joue plus au foot depuis longtemps l'quipe de France est motive et bonne !    Faisons les comptes  la fin du 1ier tour, pour l'instant personne n'est limin, personne n'est qualifi !    Avant ce fameux but hors jeu il devait y avoir un penalty pour les Pays Bas quand Van Nistelrooy a t dsquilibr par Buffon ! Le rsultat est logique, l'Italie a laiss trop d'espace a des joueurs rapides et prcis, la victoire est belle et mrite !|`|TMX05hiPaa	Mais non rassure toi, avec 3 fois 0-0 on peut se qualifier pour les 1/4, regarde :    2me Match :     France 0 - 0 Pays-Bas  Italie 1 - 1 Roumanie (ou 0-0, ou 2-2 ...)    3me Match :    France 0 - 0 Italie  Pays-Bas 2 - 0 Roumanie (ou 1-0, ou 2-1, ou 3-0 ...)

Esprons qu'ils se bougeront un peu plus (bon c'est  20h45, ils auront pas l'excuse de la chaleur ! et Domenech qui comptait sur l'arrive de la pluie pour dbloquer le jeu, mdr !)    En tous cas, les joueurs italiens ainsi que Donadoni se sont excuss au prs des supporteurs italiens de leur prestation. Tu vois Domenech, ou Henry, ou Malouda dire "excusez nous, on a vraiment mal jou, et en plus on a pris le melon". ?    J'ai t vraiment d?ue de la prestation des bleus hier, j'attendais bcp plus, alors oui, c'est facile de les critiquer, mais franchement .. rveillez-vous, quoi.

Parce que les nerlandais ont gagn 3-0 face  l'Italie ?  Ok la victoire est mrite mais le premier but mme Gilbert Montagn l'aurait pas accord, aprs le second but c'est le rsultat du coup de massue du premier. Le troisime rcompense un contre rondement men face  une quipe italienne oblige de se dcouvrir.  Les qualits de l'quipe de France sont trs diffrentes et son jeu en mouvement peut mettre en difficults la dfense hollandaise un peu lourde. Toni a bien t contenu hier mais ?a n'a jamais t un monstre de vivacit et que dire des fant?mes de Di Natale et Camoranesi. Sans compter un Pirlo curieusement imprcis. Et  la diffrence d ela Roumanie, les Pays-Bas ne refusent pas le jeu et ne vont pas se regrouper  10 derrire, il y aura des espaces d'un cot comme de l'autre.|`|hLBT9gCRaa	C'est vrai que quand on voit ce genre de match, on peut franchement se poser des questions...  Mais aurait-il fallu prendre des risques de se faire contrer et de perdre le match ? L ?a aurait t mission quasi impossible pour la suite avec 2 quipes  3 pts...  Imaginons un autre scnario...  La France rdite 2 autres fois un match pourri et finit avec 3pts et 0 but marqu..  La Roumanie et l'Italie font nul... (peu importe le score)  Les Pays-Bas "atomise" 1-0 les Roumains... (ou plus)  Rsultat : on finit 2me avec 3 pts devant l'Italie 2 pts et la Roumanie 1 pt...  Moralit : Mme avec un jeu pourri, on peut se qualifi...  Esprons tout de mme autre chose !|`|170b89daf50575c3616f4ddd88999817aa	Ca dpend....    Bon dj, on savait que l'equipe de France ne sait pas jouer contre des equipes refusant le jeu.  De plus on utilise le meme schma de jeu contre ces equipes et les equipes haut de gamme.  Enfin, quelques joueurs de l'equipe non pas le niveau, et ca commence enfin  se voir (Abidal et Malouda).    Donc :  Avec un selectionneur qui s'y connait autant en tactique que moi en couture   + Une selection ingale car les joueurs ont tous le meme profil (Henry, Anelka, Benzema)   + des joueurs qui doivent s'occuper de leurs postes plus dpanner pendant 90 minutes les bourdes des autres  + Des joueurs dont l'envie est loin d'etre vidente    = Non, en l'etat la France ne peut pas faire un bon Euro.    Si les pays bas reproduisent leur niveau de jeu du match d'hier contre la France, alors on est cuit.    Mais en changeant de tactiques, on a peut etre une chance de passer les poules.    un 4-3-1-2 par exemple un trio rcuprateur Makll, Toulalan, Vieira (ou L. Diarra), devant un Ribry en electron libre et 2 attaquants diffrents genre Gomis/Henry ou Gomis/Benzema.  Evra en arrrire gauche videmment.    ou un 4-3-3 : Makll  gauche, l. Diarra  doite Nasri dans l'axe, et devant l'attaque RIbry, Henry, Gomis (ou Benzema)  Evra toujorus en arri-re gauche.    Vu qu'on a pas de remplacement  Malouda, on doit joeur sans cot gauche (chose qu'on fait mais du coup on joue  10 pratiquement  tous les matchs).    J'ajouterais que si on passe  la trappe, c'est pas plus mal, car si on ne sort pas des poules, La Fd va enfin virer Domenech, et on preparera 2010 avec un selectionneur qui devra rattraper le temps perdu. En essayant de voir le niveau des espoirs francais tels que : Pongolle, Bodmer, Flamini, Gourcuff, Ben Arfa, Hoarau, Lloris, Pel, Menez, Clichy + d'autres tels que Planus, Mexes, Puygrenier, Bonnart, Be Cheyrou, Valbuena, Chantome, Diaby, etc...      Mais  l'issu de cet Euro, le mnage doit etre aussi fait dans l'equipe.    Malgr tout ce qu'ils ont pu nous apporter, il faudra virer certain cadres. I  ne faut pas faire comme avec Zidane et tarder  essayer de jouer sans eux.  Makll prendra sa retraite  Henry ne devrait plus etre titulaire et depanner quand il y a des blessures.  Coupet retraite  Thuram retraite  Gallas remplacant  Vieira Remplacant ou retraite.  Anelka comme Henry.    Si on s'y prend bien, on peut faire un coup pour 2010 mais surtout tout dechirer en 2012 et 2014.|`|vn2woAbsaa	vive l'equipe des bleus!!!!!!!!  euh non dsl   vive l'equipe des noirs!!!!!!!!!|`|u9DydtCcaa	Non et c'est tant mieux car je ne la supporte pas votre quipe d'africains de bras casss. Elle va se prendre une grosse branle contre les hollandais qui jouent un jeu trs vif  une touche de balle et avec des vrais attaquants ultra-percutants et ralistes devant le but (Van Nistelrooy, Sneijder, Huntelaar, Van Persie) et contre l'Italie qui aura dj battu la Roumanie, Toni et Del Piero feront la difference.

4b3f6f2492de7da3c5a7fa091858490aaa	Oui, en gnral la presse raconte ce qu'elle veut, suivant les vnements.    Avant le dbut de l'Euro, l'quipe de France tait l'quipe parfaite. Bien s?r que non, Trzguet (et mme Ciss) n'taient absolument pas adaptables au systme de jeu.  On garde Vieira, bien s?r c'est le capitaine, il sera remis pour les 1/4.  Thuram est vieux, mais il a des jambes, enfin il ne joue jamais au Bar?a mais c'est quand mme un champion du monde d'il y a 10 ans !! Alors c'est normal de Mexs soit carte.  Quand au slectionneur c'est un gros raleur, mais ses choix ont amen les bleus en finale de coupe du monde, alors c'est qu'il doit tre bon.    C?te italien aussi, on se voit dj champion d'Europe avant le dbut de la comptition. Tout le monde se rjouit de la grande forme de Toni, et que Del Piero et Cassano soient prsents.    Les 2 premiers matchs des fran?ais et italiens sont ce qu'ils sont..    Les slectionneurs en prennent pour leur grade. Maintenant aux yeux des journalistes les slections sont trop vieilles, Domenech est trop ttu et Donadoni trop inexpriment, tout le monde veut sa dmission. Les italiens ne veulent plus de Del Piero mais finalement ils auraient prfr Inzaghi.     A la veille du match couperet, la presse italienne voit dj sont quipe qualifie d'humiliante et archi nulle rentrer  Rome, alors que les fran?ais semblent confiants et capables du meilleur, Domenech s'est enfin dcid  virer les anciens.    Au lendemain du match, pour la presse italiennne, les azzurri sont passs de rise de l'Eurot  champions du monde en titre et prochains champions d'europe. La presse est aux anges, les italiens se sont qualifis, comme si ils avaient pu en douter une seule seconde! Et oui, ils ont t magistraux, ont inflig un magnifique 2-0 aux fran?ais, l'esprit de 2006 est de retour..  C?t fran?ais, on critique Domenech et tout le staff. C'est vrai que ne gagner aucun match sur les 3 c'est forcment qu'on a une quipe pourrie.    Si la France avait remport ce match, Domenech aurait t l'homme providentiel, capable de se sortir de toutes les situations. L'quipe de France aurait encore t dsigne comme favorite du tournoi.  Les Italiens se seraient rus sur Donadoni, auraient critiqu l'quipe trop vieille, et finalement auraient remis en cause la slection de Cassano, cens  la base faire la diffrence contre la France, et la forme de Toni (qui a du se manger 10 buts depuis le dbut du tournoi).    C'est pourquoi je ne porte pas grande importance aux journaux sportifs en gnral (et autres journaux qui parlent occasionnellement de sport). Ils raccontent n'importe quoi,en fonction de circonstance. Ils sont capables d'crire un truc et son contraire sans se trouver ridicules ..    D'ailleurs Jacquet avait bien dit que "l'Equipe" est un journal de mer*e.|`|587MPPTjaa	et voil la mienne!  http://www.humour.com/affiche/ekippfranc...|`|TMX05hiPaa	On doit pas lire la mme presse alors|`|a3d023d364e04ebe419bb0614846f0bbaa	HoooOOooOoo!!!

Car il ne faut pas oublier que c'est un sport spectacle.  Ce que tu reproches aux footballeurs c'est donc exactement la mme chose que pour tout artiste (opra, thatre, cinma etc).  Ceci tant dit : chacun son choix : moi perso j'adore le foot, et mon mari beaucoup mais beaucoup plus modrment. Mais on arrive tout de mme  bien s'entendre sans problme.     Que faut-il faire de l'argent ?

Mais je ne suis pas d'accord sur le fait que tu n'y trouves pas de sens. Le sport a un but : dtendre (au moins dans la tte), amuser et se dpenser, voire  se dpasser (dans les matchs  enjeux).    Pour ce qui est des millions, je trouve toujours un peu dmagogique de hurler avec les loups sur les salaires des joueurs. Ce ne sont pas eux qui demandent autant. On le leur propose, je ne vois pas pourquoi ils refuseraient, ce serait stupide de le faire d'ailleurs. Et si tu vas par l, dnonce tous les systmes qui semblent iniques : le cinma, le thatre, la chanson, la peinture...    En plus, on s'en prend souvent aux joueurs de football, mais il faut savoir que ce ne sont pas les sportifs les mieux pays. Pour cela, il faut aller voir du c?t du golf, du basket-ball, de la Formule 1. Enfin, la majorit des sportifs ne gagnent pas non plus des fortunes colossales ; ce sont simplement les meilleurs, les plus dous et/ou les plus talentueux qui sont rcompenss avec des sommes faramineuses.|`|3b9c8e3b0d54f5745200d5b385943c0caa	non pourquoi tu dtestes pas grave mais moi qui pratique du football c'est un bon sport pour de dfouler  condition de savoir un peu jou.|`|otRqy2braa	s'inquieter nan pas  ce point t'es libre enfin mais perso j'adore les mecs qui s'interesse au football...je te trouve un peu bizarre voil..bise  toi|`|f4e26fc8b9b46a6f63bf2d072e45e3e2aa	yen a bien qui sont content de regarder un homme politique  la tv. etre d'accord avec lui, votez pour lui, se faire berner, raler et continuer.|`|VKPT5iMxaa	Moi c'est le sport diffus a la tv en gnral , qui m'irrite, regarder      ,des mecs suer et se donner des coups tout ?a sous l'oeil aprobateur d'une horde de frusts abreuvs de bires,on se croirait revenu sous l'empire romain Panes et circenses!!!

Oi2csQUKaa	Rivers are productive for fishing for several reasons. Fish in rivers are constantly dealing with current. Swimming against the current, and even exerting energy just to hold their position in the current means that the fish are, essentially, exercising twenty four hours a day every day. They must eat frequently to maintain their energy levels. Fish that are eating aggressively and frequently sometimes aren’t as cautious and are more likely to eat an angler’s presentation.<br>  <br>  River fish seem to be less affected by weather than their cousins that live in lakes.

sM2vQFZGaa	I have a feeling the Vikes DLine will put MAD pressure on Aaron Rogers and he wont be able to handle it.  Tjack will have AD and Chester to fall back on, and Berrian, Rice, and Wade are gonna be solid.  Cedric will have a breakout season and the Vikes will end up winning hopefully. Cant be too confident though. the Pack are an amazingly young and good team.  27-24 Vikings  Wishful Thinking|`|NPctQezsaa	PACKERS WOOT    my fave team! ;]     I think Packers might win with new QB Aaron Rodger by sitting on the bench for 2 seasons thought by Brett Favre|`|GhhBCfTtaa	Green Bay! cause they're packing the heat|`|muiIXn76aa	VIKINGS  PETERSON!

Now that he's gone I feel as though the playing field has been leveled between the two teams.  If the Packers' run defense can hold stand up to Peterson then the Packers will win.  If they do not hold him back, the Vikings will win.

85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	means pounds. On the recurve it will say something like 45# @28" which means at 28" draw it will be 45 pounds. As for weight for you, whatever you can handle. If you are just shooting paper targets, 25 or 30 pounds is fine. If you want to hunt you'll need to work up to heavier draw weights. 40 pounds of draw is enough for deer but if you can draw more, it will shoot faster and flatter with more energy. My long bow is 70# at 28" which is a real handful but for just shooting in my yard I have a recurve that is 45# and it's also killed many deer. Good luck with the new bow|`|ZKikquiOaa	Yes, it means lbs.  You do need to convert it if you are used to measuring things in metric.  But pounds is widely used in the archery world, even though metric is the standard in the country.  You also need to take into account your draw length and the bow length.  For instance, a 20# bow is usually marked at 28" draw length, so if you're built like Kareem Abdul Jabar, then you won't actually be holding 20 lbs, someone like him drawing a 20 lbs bow might actually be holding close to 30 lbs if not more because of his long arms.  A standard 68" bow usually will get 2 lbs for every inch drawn beyond 28".  So a 20# @ 28" bow drawn to 30" will be 24# and so on.  The shorter the bow the more it'll "stack" up the poundage per inch, a 62" bow will get close to 3# per inch.<br>  <br>  As to the correct draw weight, that's a tough matter.  To properly learn archery, you don't want to have to struggle at all, that's the ideal condition for learning.  So the ideal starting draw weight for a bow is somewhere between 15-20lbs for an average man.  Then as you get better, ideally you need to add at most about 4 lbs at a time.  But doing that costs money, so you have to balance out between money spent on bows and your goals.  When I started, I made the mistake of going straight to a 30lbs bow.  I was shooting decent groups with it, but along the way the heavy bow made me develop bad habits that takes time to unlearn.  So it comes down to goals, what are your goals, will you be happy with hitting a paper plate from 20 yards all day, or do you want to be able to hit a quarter from 20 yards all day.  The higher your goal, the more important it becomes to start properly.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to find a range, or even when you visit a shop.  Try drawing back a bow.  Ask the clerk or other archers at the range to spot you for the following.  As you hold the bow for more than 20 seconds do you do any of these?<br>  <br>  1.  Leaning back, where your body start leaning away from the target.<br>  2.  Is your bow shoulder low or high?  High and creeping bow shoulder means the bow is too heavy, this is where the bow shoulder slowly rises to your ear.<br>  3.  Are you shaking?  Best seen when you wear short sleeve and have them watch your bow elbow for shakes.  Shakes after 40 seconds is ok, shakes after only 6 seconds means the bow is too heavy.

Pour le pratiquant dart martiaux, il sagit de bien doser sa dfense, de bien la proportionner, en fonction de la gravit du danger et surtout de ne pas attaquer le premier ( aprs une agression verbale par exemple.   Donc ventuellement aprs une esquive : Un rglement verbal, grace  une bonne ma?trise de soi, vaut donc mieux dans certains cas quun affrontement physique. Et puis, viter le combat, nest pas l une victoire ?|`|6e8566c08c4ab951b772f914dc30b02eaa	La rgle de proportionnalit est inscrite dans le Code pnal, ce n'est pas un mesnonge :  ? N'est pas pnalement responsable la personne qui, devant une atteinte injustifie envers elle-mme ou autrui, accomplit, dans le mme temps, un acte command par la ncessit de la lgitime dfense d'elle-mme ou d'autrui, sauf s'il y a disproportion entre les moyens de dfense employs et la gravit de l'atteinte ?.    En clair, tu ne peux pas gorger quelqu'un qui te gifle et tu ne peux pas briser la nuque de quelqu'un qui t'attaque avec un coup de poing.    L'tat de ncessit : si tu peux fuir, il n'est pas lgitime de riposter.  L'atteinte : il est question d'atteinte  l'intgrit physique.  La simultanit : il faut que ta raction soit immdiate. Il ne s'agit donc pas de cogner quelqu'un qui t'a agress dix minutes plus t?t.  La proportionnalit : c'est la raction qu'aurait un individus normalement courageux dans des circonstances semblables.    Autrement dit, si cela vite  une personne de se faire tabasser par 3 gars, c'est lgitime. Si ce la vite  quelqu'un de se faire triper, c'est lgitime. C'est mme une obligation, sans quoi tu es coupable d'abstention de porter secours.    La proportionnalit de ce point de vue a cette dfinition :  "Le principe de proportionnalit est un principe d'adquation des moyens  un but recherch."    Tu peux penser ce que tu veux, mais comme le dit le dicton "Dura lex, sed lex".|`|DpGqVoawaa	La rponse de l'ami Stphane est parfaite et circonstancie.

LIKkt8djaa	A real simple method is to realize whichever way your leading shoulder is pointing is where your board is going to turn, If you turn your lead shoulder to the left it'll twist your hips thus causing the board to turn that direction. Just remember to keep the edge facing downhill up and you're good to go for starting out.|`|UULgRsDSaa	go when its not crowded, like a non-holiday weekend or weekday|`|HVpeJzM4aa	just run into them and maybe they'll learn their lesson...<br>  <br>  but seriously...i'm not saying this to make fun of you but if you were able to make quick turns you'd easily be able to progress to the intermediate and expert runs. But the easiest method...point with your lead hand to where you want to go and you'll go that way.|`|CUIOR6aVaa	all about the knees and the hips... bend the front knee to make quicker turns, steer the back around with more weight on the front foot to do the rudder effect, that how to dodge quickly
mNLclwSPaa	Im was not the best you could say when I did skate, but you wanna get in a comfortable position, if your goofy, use your left foot to pop, and if your regular use your right foot to pop. You want to pop, immediately jump, and then slide your non-popping foot towards the top of the board. If you need a visual, you can check youtube. Hope this helped ;)

Wjp0niEhaa	String the mains (vertical) first, starting in the middle with two tie-offs on each side.  The crosses usually start at the head (with a different knot).|`|qykk5MvIaa	you always start form the main. if you have 4,8,12 holes in the thoart, you start from the head. if you have 2,6,10 you start from the throat. when you finished both sides of the main you tied it off. usually when you finished the main, you should have two tied off knots. and you weave the cross and you should have two more tied off points. in total you should have four tied off points. that's how i do my racket with two piece. ususally if the string is long at the tied off point, you should tension it.

eUm5BynQaa	Tu devrais faire toute tes scances avec un pullkick ou pullboy car en Tri tu utilises pas bcp les jambes en natation car tu as la combi qui t'aide beaucoup tout comme le pullboy (contrairement  la natation pure). Aprs pour progresser rapidement ca va pas tre facile! car c'est le plus technique des trois et ce n'est pas dit que tu es des facillits dans cette discipline. Je te conseille donc pendant un an de faire que de la technique mme si c'est chiant, et de faire des compt de natation qui vont te faire progresser! Il est plus difficile pour un homme d'apprendre a nager que pour un enfant, car tu a des dfauts technique ancrs dans ta mmoire qui ne vont pas tre facil  changer alors laisse un peut tomber les courses de vlo et pedestre pour une saison! Beaucoup de triathlte on une license de natation en plus de celle du tri, tu devrais faire la mme chose. Pour finir, je pense que la sortie d'eau est spychologique! si tu arrives dans les 1er dans le parc a vlo, ta une motivation d'enfer mais si tu arrive dans les derniers et que tu vois plus un vlo dans le parc, ben c'est la dprime... car en faite cette discipline n'est pas proportionnelle au reste si tu regarde bien... enfin bref! essai de sortir devant pour l'an prochain et bon courage!|`|VqzW1mI9aa	Euh... faire du biathlon...|`|jyRrFfQ0aa	Pose la question  Laurent Jalabert, devenu fru de triathlon aprs sa brillante carrire de cycliste.

Just realistic.  The guy is incredibly selfish, and egotistical.  He rants and raves and demands a trade when the Lakers get ousted in the Playoffs (Which WILL happen again this year by the way) then he says "Oh I've always wanted to be here!" when they play like winners.  He is the essence of the selfish era of the NBA.  Very little team-play.  Only focus is being flashy and making highlites on ESPN.  It's a joke.  Kobe is a joke.  HE can't win a championship on his own, and the day he realizes it, maybe I'll "believe".|`|18bb6ca5f4d5808abed2ed34b3660ef7aa	What r u talkin' about?..I've always believed....that Kobe was full of himself..not taking away from his game, he's an excellent player..we all know that. But Kobe has BEEN an excellent player for some time now. His Lakers are usually always in the mix when it comes to the top teams in the NBA. Did any of us really expect him NOT to put up the kind of numbers he did? Did any of us really expect him NOT to be the driving force for his team? So how is that someone who's already proven, gets MVP? Because he whined and pouted around about it? In my opinion, the MVP has to be someone who not only contributes to the betterment of his personal play but the team overall. The Hornets were non-contenders for so long b4 the combining of Chandler, West, and CP3 under the guidance of a veteran of the game himself, Byron Scott. Within one regular season, they were able to turn a team that went from "sh*tty to pretty".  What the Hornets team did, a large portion of that being due to the leadership and performance of Chris Paul, is what SHOULD'VE got CP3 the MVP. Yeah, I guess it's true..if u throw a big enough fit, u get what u want..even if u don't deserve it. Congrats 2 Kobe and fans..|`|60ba25528589cc782df7cf63a3359a73aa	I am not a Kobe hater|`|dMgOiiwBaa	Nope.
2nJs36Rqaa	Did you not watch the game?  lol  He was being a little punk, no question about it.  The suspension was deserved.    I can see why Wizards fans are so over the Cavs beating them... after all its been three years in a row now.  Cavs fans remember all to well those losses in the 90's to the Bulls.     But really?  It kind of looked to me like the Wizards gave up in game 6.  There was no sense of urgency, no fire at all.      Despite all of the drama in the series, the better team ended up winning.  Nuff said.|`|hoTXDp1Uaa	YEAH.... OK....  You lost because you didn't have the human highlight film DARIUS SONGALIA!      I think living in the city with the highest crime rate is starting to get to the Wizards head.  They are just a bunch of thugs, that instead of playing BASKETBALL, tried to beat there way to the second round.    Good luck next year. Get rid of Arenas and Stevenson and you'd have a decent team.|`|4f2ef1fc4cc7f74e2cf87f8f54e37cddaa	The wizards play like its street ball.  Maybe Darius shouldn't have hit him in the face, maybe haywood shouldn't have got himself ejected in game 2, and maybe stevenson shouldn't be making throat slitting gestures that cost him $25k.  The whole wizards team is a bunch of scrubs and so are there fans.  There is no emotion from the washington fans they just sit and watch and then get pissy.  Maybe next time Deshawn should grow that beard over his mouth so he won't be able to talk crap.|`|q7vkyCdOaa	http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/2008playoff...|`|I7x0EHtIaa	I sure do not see any Cavs fans boo hooing today.  I would say NO, Cavs fans are not the biggest crybabbies.|`|krGvzTenaa	At the end of the day, who came put the sencond round!!!  like Lebron said "Cleveland is advancing"!|`|gqoIfbH0aa	Ummm... I haven't whined about that once, if you look back to the Jordan era the Pistons were definitely more physical, but if your gonna piss someone off, don't let it be any of the following players.    1. Kobe Bryant  2. LeBron James  3. Kevin Garnett  4. Amare Stoudemire  5. Ron Artest    These guys can be vicious if they wanna be an pissing them off ain't that smart. The Darius thing, well honestly how much difference would he make to an 18 point deficit? The Cavs looked together tonight and if they played like this more often they'd have a much better record.     (and Ron Artest... Well remember the Indiana/Detroit frenzy??)|`|cUJIyhQ0aa	Just face it, CAVS WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AyTFWb4Eaa	no.  wizards fans are. did u see them last night? first of all elbowing to the face is not basketball.  caron did it yesterday and all the wizards guys did was talk trash because they are jealous that the cavs now beat them three years in a row. hah.  they always talk trash but do nothing about it.  that equals fakeness if ya ask me.  o well they will sit at home now and eat chips and dip while the cavs move on!|`|bU2rGQHSaa	After reading this question, it looks like you're the one who is crying!

Just keep firing up one of the best in the sport,and you will lose time after time after time!|`|40fe7e68f6c8a8f5502b3a4d8052be4baa	No....but I do think the Cav's coach is the biggest crybaby about LeBron.  I mean my God!!! It's playoff basketball and yes some of the wizards fouls were a bit over the top but does the coach have to cry about every foul on LeBron?  Jeesh!  We get it already that LeBron is your little star...ok big star, but can you please stop crying?  Other coaches have stars too (Phil and Kobe, Doc and Garnett, Byron and Chris, Pat and Dwayne) and my God, they do not cry about every little thing about their big stars!  Somebody give him some tissue!!!

Et puis voir ces mecs, avec leur cervelle  4 sous, vilains comme des poux (la plupart) et que l'on gave de fric parce que leur seule instruction c'est de savoir se servir de leurs pieds, je trouve cel rvoltant. Vous pouvez me raconter ce que vous voulez, mais bande de petits, vous ne voyez pas que l'on vous gave de cette connerie jusqu' plus soif, pendant ce temps l vous ne pensez pas que demain il va vous falloir aller au turf pour que vous puissiez vous payer votre prochain ticket de match( et surtout qu'il ne faut pas oublier le "plein de bire, parce que sinon ce ne serait pas bon de ne pas tre pleins comme des vaches" ou bien pour vous payer le dernier maillot couleur merde de pigeon que porte le zigoto n 10 ....Rflchissez, on vous pompe votre fric et ce qui vous reste de vos derniers neurones... NON ? J'ai tord? C'est pas grave les mecs: pendant que vous tes au stade ou au bistrot, y'en a quelques uns qui s'occupent de vos petites femmes qui sont bien fatigues ...... quand vous rentrez saouls comme des polonais et que vous voulez faire zizi panpan: elles sont rassasies sur ce point et pour moi je vous engage  continuer, les bidochons....

XnSzpxquaa	Tant mieux pour vous il jouera certainement plus qu'a Lyon et vu la qualit du joueur c'est une trs bonne chose pour l'Om.|`|YrT0DP2Qaa	Bah c'est con pour lui, il ne sera pas champion !... Mais cela aurait pu tre pire s'il avait sign au PSG !... Je sent que je vais me faire des amis !...|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Ben Arfa est peut-tre le plus dou de sa gnration. On l'a malheureusement assez peu vu  Lyon du fait de la frilosit offensive de Perrin. Techniquement Ben Arfa est trs fort et il se rapporche peut-tre plus d'un Ribry que ne le faisait Nasri.  A l'OM il va trouver un temps de jeu digne de son talent et son duo avec Valbuena va renverser sans doute pas mal de dfenses de L1. Et puis l'avantage  l'OM c'est qu'il n'aura aucun mal  faire oublier les Zenden, Ziani, Akal, Oruma... Et ?a permettra  Niang de retrouver un poste en pointe, que ce soit aux cots ou en remplacement de Ciss.  Au fait il devient quoi Grandin ???|`|tvS6JnbJaa	enfin ?a se prcise !!!  J'ai eu peur pendant un temps il tait plut?t vers Paris mais heureusement pour lui le PSG recrute pas en dessous de 35 ans il prpare l'avenir comme ils disent.

Je viens de voir ?a sur le site off' !|`|WTWYiauhaa	Ben Arfa  l'OM, je dirais que c'est le meilleur transfert pour l'instant. Le mec est super talentueux mais boycott a lyon. Tant mieux pour marseille! Il va exploser l bas et l'anne d'aprs, il va rejoindre Nasri a Arsenal... J'ai entendu Arsene wenger dire qu'il achterais bien les 3 joueurs(Nasri; ben Arfa, Benzema) pour les faire jouer a Arsenal.C'est une bonne ide mme si je pense que ce sera un peu difficile puisque apparement Ben Arfa et Benzema ne s'entendent pas trop( un des deux a surement pris la grosse tte) Petite anecdote: Thierry Henry en voulant s'assoire a sa place habituelle dans le bus de l'equipe de france pendant l'euro a trouv un des jeunes (je ne sais pas lequel) qui tait assi   sa place, le jeune lui aurait refus de lui rendre sa place et aurait dit que c'est la place des jeunes maintenant et henry est allez s'assoire dans le fond du bus sans rien dire. Makelele aussi se serait prit la tte avec Benzema enfin voila quoi...  En tout cas, Ben Arfa est un joueur super fort techniquement, jeune certes mais je pense qu'il a plus de talent que benzema d'un point de vue offensif mais moins que Nasri en ce qui concerne la lecture du jeu et le jeu collectif... Decidement, l'om ces dernires annes a su attirer les meilleurs talents dans son effectif. Quand l'om recrute un des joueurs les plus prometteur et d'avenir (21 ans seulement) et d'origine parisienne qui plus est, le psg s'offre les services de Thuram, un grand joueur certes, mais bon....un peu trop vieux non?|`|ueXvEC5xaa	Choix tonnant, sachant que ce joueur il y'a 2 semaines criaient sur tous les toits qu'il souhaitait aller au PSG et pas  l'om...    Et une chose qui me drange c'est que si aulas vend benarfa a lom c'est qu'il y'a anguille sous roche... Ou pas d'autres prtendants pour un joueur surestim qui n'a pas montr encore grand chose...    J'attends de voir les prestations de ce joueur avant de donner un avis. Si il a le mme poids que nasri, ce sera un trs mauvais recrutement...    Pour moi il est l'gal de nasri, tout le monde les encensent, mais sur le terrain ils n'ont encore rien prouv (surtout nasri avec une saison pourrie).    Quand initialement Ben arfa voulait venir au PSG j'tais plut?t contre, lui prfrant Rothen...|`|WQgBYvBgaa	BEN HARFA peut tre bon ... mais il coute personne .. il pense qu'a lui j'espre qu'il va grandir ....|`|cYvRaerraa	TRs bonne chose pour la Ligue 1.

Also watch yourself in the mirror. What attitude do you give off? I saw that I looked insecure and sometimes rude, even when I didnt feel that way. Now I smile a lot more and people have noticed.   Just act happy and people will be drawn to you.  Good luck :)

n35WinClaa	Trop facile de ne taper que sur lui !! Hier soir, on fait une "bonne" premire mi-temps, on fait jeu gal et on a quelques occases.   Par contre en deuxime, les changements de GERETS ont destabilis le milieu de terrain et on n'a plus touch une bille. Alors oui, Zubar se rate sur les 2 buts qu'on prend, mais on les aurait pris de toutes fa?ons. Le PSV jouait beaucoup plus haut et rcuperait tous les ballons au milieu !! CHEYROU et CANA se sont fait bouffer !! Pourtant, ce n'tait pas CHELSEA en face !! Et devant, personne n'a su elever son niveau de jeu !!   Je m'explique tout ?a par le manque d'experience  ce niveau de comptition !! On n'a que des joueurs qui ont une trs faible experience en LDC !! Et ?a compte beaucoup !! Le PSV, eux, ils y sont tous les ans en LDC !! Ceci explique peut-tre cela !!

Tu prfres qui entre Givet, Civelli, Erbate et Zubar? En sachant que Rodriguez est bless ?a devient compliqu...  C'est bien beau de recruter Ben Arfa, Kon et autres mais faut penser  la dfense aussi parce que Mandanda peut pas tout faire tout seul|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Zubar apporte encore une fois la preuve que le recrutement dfensif marseillais est moisi : Faty, Givet, Erbate, Csar, Krupoviesa...  Maintenant Zubar ne porte pas  lui seul la responsabilit des errances marseillaise en dfense. J'ai parfois l'impression que Zubar joue seul en charnire centrale tant Hilton se fait discret (il a du prendre des cours avec Gallas !) alors que le brsilien tait cens devenir le patron de cette dfense.  Zubar n'a pas sa place si l'OM veut viser haut mais il ne fait pas tache parmi l'effectif dfensif actuel de l'OM.    Franchement je pense pas que ce soit l'erreur de Zubar qui entraine le deuxime but qui crucifie l'OM parce qu'avant cel le PSV manque l'immanquable par deux fois. Et de Niang  Mandanda personne n'a t au niveau en seconde priode !!!

Certes il n'a peut-tre plus le foncier pour faire une saison complte  Chelsea mais l on parle du PSG et de la L1.  Le volume de jeu de Makll est impressionnant et il va pouvoir encadrer les jeunes, Chant?me notamment et Clment dans une moindre mesure.  Et Makll n'a finalement explos au niveau international que sur le tard, il n'a gure que 8 annes de trs haut niveau, il n'a pas la mme usure physique et morale.|`|MPe5O3lfaa	C'est un vrai risque (pour lui et pour le PSG) comme pour Guily, Thuram (si il peut jouer) voir Gallas. Si la mayonnaise prend, Paris peut viser trs haut, dans le cas contraire attention les railleries (les sketches des guignols de l'info sur les papys du psg doivent dj tre prts...)|`|e3875ba166d5339682a4f6dd0f3298adaa	Si  l'Euro 2008, les vieux n'ont pas su faire la rsistance, ce n'est en Ligue 1 et en Coupe de l'UEFA qu'ils en feront davantage. D'abord Lilian Thuram, puis maintenant Claude Makll, (deux dfenseurs qui ont t trotalement "out"  l'Euro 2008), ce n'est pas en embauchant des footballeurs vieillards, qui ont dix ans de retard d'adaptation sur le football actuel que le PSG (Pour Sniles de Gloire) va se refaire une sant. La politique entame par Paul Le Guen avec des jeunes, qui ont quand mme fourni une excellente saison, compte tenu de leur inexprience, devra se poursuivre, car ne savent faire profiter de leur exprience, que les vieux qui ont conserv la vista. Or, soyons honntes, ces deux-l n'ont plus  voir avec le football...|`|oPReYRS4aa	J'avoue le mec il en a encore dans les jambes, il la prouv  l'Euro aprs une saison complte  Chelsea.|`|m38A4G9Uaa	?a peut faire que du bien au psg, vu ces dernires saisons chaotiques.....  en plus, makll a fait un trs bon choix personnel,je pense, puisqu' une bonne fin de carrire dans son pays c'est pas mal....|`|Z3kXbI2haa	C'est clair il a t mont en srie avec des Duracell ce mec ! Moi je dis bon choix, tout comme Giuly, malgr leur age un peu "avanc". Le mauvais choix c'est Sessegnon, et ce serait Briand. Pour Gallas faut voir, je sais pas trop quoi penser.|`|VfJHzqD9aa	bon choix pour une anne|`|LgkmipDCaa	et si touts les autres joueurs milieux sont idiots comment va-t-il faire?  il ne va pas quand mme tre sur tout le milieux a la fois  je dis bon chois mais revoir les autres|`|C8F8DKsxaa	Tu parles bien. Makelele est de bonne humeur ces temps-ci. En milieu de terrain, il fera quelque chose surement de bon|`|6a3df69d4fb9cef1abfbec26634189a7aa	a mon avis c'est une bonne chose pour le club mais une moins bonne pour le joueur ... avec tous les joueurs moyens qu'il aura autour de lui, mme si son niveausera largement suffisant pour le ligue 1 , il risque de vite perdre patience et que son jeur s'en ressente.|`|B1wQ0gZXaa	Salut    J'aime bien Makll mais j'ai l'impression que le PSG veut s'offrir tous les retraits lol!!!|`|b563QdObaa	D'une grande exprience ce joueur, j'espre que le PSG sera champion !|`|pEaMkIQBaa	Le PSG recrute des vieillards, ils font pitis|`|9e36513a40f3e535ac69d53aa645afaeaa	Je n'aime pas du tout le PSG  mais le recrutement de Makelele est une bonne chose pour eux car il a une tres bonne mentalit pour encadrer les jeunes et surtout les recadrer s'il le faut.|`|8d119ee6dda7014f0de00a9f8333ac1baa	A vrai dire Makelele seul non. Son transfert est une bonne chose pour les autres joueurs bien s?r et le type de contrat qu'il possde (joueur puis staff d'encadrement) est cohrent.  Il ne jouera peut tre rellement qu'une saison, mais son savoir faire sera important.    Enfin Makele fait parti d'un recrtutement permettant la cration d'une pine dorsale sur le terrain. Ces joueurs n'auront pas vocation  faire plusieurs saisons mais de prparer la transition pour un club qui sombre chaque anne de plus en plus.    En conclusion sur le papier c'est trs bon, dans la pratique et la particularit de la L1, on verra ce que ca donne. C'est un coup de fouet qui tait ncessaire au PSG, voir mme vital.  Pour moi ces recrutements sont cohrents.

The Pats offense maybe ready because of the bye last week, but I think that has hurt any chemistry/synchronicity that Matt Cassel had developed with his receivers. they will rely on the run and the SF D will force them to throw and make mistakes.|`|mMPcD6SHaa	New England will beat the hell out of San Fran, and will have a better game plan than they did vs. Miami.|`|g8DU3ZZjaa	If we're in luck...The 49ers.|`|86ukTrs1aa	niners|`|y9TaQ3g7aa	49ers by uuuummmm about 14 or 21 points|`|w2CCGhZqaa	Niners. All the way.     The 49ers beat Seattle at Quest Field. O'Sullivan is probably the better QB right now. NE is having trouble on Defense. The loss to Miami is not helping the decision. SF lost to a pretty good New Orleans team. It may not be a huge win, but I think the niners win by 7.
9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Bien s?r et ces mmes gens te disaient que s'entrainer jour aprs jour aux cots des Pirlo, Kaka, Seedorf dans l'un des meilleurs clubs du monde ?a n'apportait rien.  Les deux annes que Gourcuff a pass du cot du Milan ce ne sont pas deux annes de perdues, alors certes il a moins jouer que certains autres jeunes de sont age mais bon cirer le banc derrire Kaka c'est autre chose que jouer aux cots de Ziani ou Arrache pour le cas de Nasri.  Rennes est un trs bon club formateur, prsent rgulirement dans les phases finales de la Gambardella.

Et aujourd'hui, on sait  peine o il joue. Ok, Gourcuff est bon  Bordeaux. Mais pour ce qui est du futur de l'EDF, il est une possibilit parmi d'autre. Il aura certainement sa chance,  lui de faire comme Zidane  son poque : de prendre la place et de ne plus la lacher.|`|n35WinClaa	Tout comme ceux qui " t'insultaient" il y a 2 ans, je trouve que tu t'enflammes un peu sur GOURCUFF. Bien sur que c'est un grand espoir pour l'Equipe de France, tout comme l'tait et l'est encore NASRI, mais d'ici  dj affirmer que c'est le "FUTUR" de l'equipe de France, c'est un peu presomptieux !!     L'avenir nous le dira !!|`|XDY42wrHaa	Tu sais ne t'enflamme pas trop vite, le Gourcuff attend de le juger sur la DUREE !   Gourcuff est talentueux, il a fait un excellent match avec les bleus, il est efficace avec bordeaux, je dit pas le contraire, mais il ne faut pas pour autant dire que Nasri est mauvais, tes propos sont stupide.  Pour Wenger donne le lien ou il dit que nasri est "une 5me solution" je te crois sur le faite qu'il est pu dire qu'il est voulu recruter gourcuff, mais pour nasri je reste perplexe.  Au lieu de venter l'un et d'enterrer l'autre, rejouit toi d'avoir 2 excellents joueurs chez les bleus en milieu de terrain !

mZdQDqRPaa	Shawn has gotten a lot of attention here and well deserved. Who knows if it's a ground swell, or a few fans creating the extra interest. I agree with most of the comments here though, and agree she seems to be a great role model. In particular she showed exceptional graciousness towards the other competitors, something we need to demonstrate to the world so our more nationalistic hooligans don't take over our world image.    Nastia is the more beautiful and classically tall and thin (and more medalled) of the two, but that's not particularly what we need for our girls. Shawn has undeniable heart and goodness, traits we need to emphasize over all the bad girl images out there today. I love her smile, and the fact that she seemed just a little self conscious about her teeth.    Loved those peace sign ear rings she wore at her interview with Bob Costas!|`|LL1D67Nwaa	possibly she seems very nice and a good role model|`|i5sDVVFoaa	Yes, she is 100 times better cuter!  She is not a score loser, but Nastia IS. Nastia always has that pissed-off look when other gymnasts got a better score than her, even her own teammate Shawn!     I am so happy for Shawn to get her gold medal! |`|dqbO66QQaa	i think she is...lots ppl like her|`|LQXPoGCGaa	Yes she is.

She does have a great attitude. Always smiling even with all the f-ed up s-ht that went down in the gymnastics in these games.    On the other end of the spectrum, Nastia was intensely focused. You knew she was gonna win the all-around when you saw that look on her face after the uneven bars. That's was the look of sheer determination. |`|969b340fdebec0ff6c8202d1859ff4eeaa	to maskddin, America's "old" sweetheart would be the 1984 all-around gold champ, Mary Lou Retton, I'm surprised you haven't heard of her.  to answer the question now, Shawn is a great gymnast, but remember Liukin won the all-around, I would think she would take priority....but I see where you're coming from, Shawn has that pixie like appearance that Mary Lou does.

And besides, they ended up getting Jason Bay, a topnotch player from the Pirates to take his place.

However, he has looked good in the playoffs.  |`|SpAv1g2maa	Two reasons  why (1) - that the L.A.Dodgers,made manny a real good offer.

Yo, aunque sea venezolano de nacimiento, sin embargo, voy a apoyar a Brasil, es mejor as y de hecho es ms seguro para cualquier juego como una apuesta. Por lo tanto, Venezuela tiene 0 % de posibilidades de ganar el partido y si tal vez lo gana lo hace 1x0 con ayuda de los arbitros o por suerte, nada ms, eso es recndito y no se puede imaginar, porque sencilla y llanamente es una fantasa y por supuesto un sue?o.|`|ZiJucRN1aa	ma?ana es obvio que gana Brasil, pero quiza venezuela nos de una sorpresa...! |`|KrxrtNwSaa	Los de venezuela salen a la cancha sin nimos y sin corazn, por esdo ya nadie los apoya|`|5MFyuS1Kaa	NO|`|6sN0FJqoaa	Nada en el Ftbol es imposible, nunca se sabe..., pero en mi criterio debe ganar Brasil (y con comodidad) ?razones? el partido en Boston era amistoso y mucho ms tranquilo , y con una seleccion que tuvo un da muy afortunado, en cambio ahora vienen de partidos en los que han tenido una defensa desastrosa que ha desencadenado en resultados que no llenan las expectativas trazadas, de todas formas le deseo la mejor de la suerte a todos los Venezolanos (as) , besitos  =)|`|jiZ6hTieaa	no creo..brasil es mas probable ganador|`|Yr480oRZaa	noo|`|AzSs2i0baa	brasil ha bajado su nivel ,ya no es como antes ,ahora no va puntero enh la tabla ,ahora cualquier cosa puede pasar incluso podrian darle a Brasil su buena comidilla  y que gane VENEZUELA ojo yo soy PERUANO ya venimos a ganrles de visitantes a los venecos  jajajaja ?!!si se puede!!|`|9CVQkrMXaa	 Espero que sea un buen partido y no se sabe quien va a ganar porque a pesar de que Brasil no esta en su mejor momento cuando quiere no lo para nadie, y nose mucho de como juega Venezuela espero que gane :).|`|AB5BTlDPaa	sinceramente, no, venezuela tiene jugadores y potencial, pero no es suficiente su plantel como para ganarle a brasil

Et puis, les voisins n'aiment pas les Parisiens surtout, comme beaucoup de Francais du reste ...    Enfin, tu oublies un detail: ce n'est pas les Tunisiens qui ont siffle, ce sont des francais d'origine tunisienne !!! Ca change tout, c'est plus une manifestation de mecontentement par rapport a un probleme interne qu'une manifestation etrangere hostile.    Sinon,  mon avis, la France est largement supplantee par les USA, voire la Russie, l'Allemagne ou Israel notamment, dans ton classement ...|`|ecayIjO2aa	Dommage que les US n'aient pas d'quipe de foot|`|6oqqeT5haa	C'est ton point de vue.      La france reste ce qu'elle est. Je ne l'aime pas et je ne la dteste pas non plus. Alors je n'ai pas besoin de le crier haut.|`|PWM2b7Rnaa	Mis  part les maghrbins aucune des nations que tu cites ne siffle notre quipe !|`|vCVsc8IDaa	Super ton amalgame.|`|d875dcf8e3aee8bbdf8c44a1297228a9aa	Pourtant beaucoup rvent de s'y installer: faudrait savoir.   Faut dire que le " sang  impur qui abreuve nos sillons", c'est un peu naze.     La vraie question c'est que sifflent-ils? Si c'est le mal-tre, le fait d'tre rejet, de se sentir  l'cart, de vivre une vie de merde, ?a peut se comprendre. Si c'est politico-religieux et qu'ils vivent mal le fait que la France soit un tat la?que souvent anticlrical qui trouve l'islam un peu agressif, alors qu'ils aillent se faire.....ailleurs.   Faudrait demander aux tunisiens de Tunisie ce qu'ils pensent des fran?ais, de la politique de la France vis--vis de leur pays etc..  l'avis des tunisiens de France, franchement on s'en tamponne.   La premire rgle si tu veux tre intgr quelque part, c'est de la fermer. Et c'est valable partout dans le monde, y compris dans tous les pays africains.   Quand  siffler la politique fran?aise ?a peut se discuter, tant entendu que les gouvernements fran?ais ont toujours soutenu les dictatures dans les anciennes colonies et que ?a continue.     Reste que ce sont des supporters de foot, ?a veut tout dire. |`|f4a43037c2bfb12254917d4928e1efd2aa	euh je suis suissesse et je t'affirme que vous n'tes pas du tout le pays le plus dtest du monde, alors calme toi :-)|`|ac7fbc4ca9f48d659dbc6c469cc90824aa	oui personne n'aime les Francais. t'as oubli de mentionner la Belgique dans ta remarque. car eux n'ont plus ne vous aiment pas et ce  cause de votre chauvinisme sans cesse grandissant et mprisant envers les autres.  et ca c'est un belge qui le dit....  moi ca me ferait bien plaisir que la France ne se qualifie pas pour le mondial !! |`|iaMMqgFKaa	ok, ils ne nous aiment pas...si tu veu, mais esce une raison pour ne pas respecter un hymne? De toute manire on ne voie ca que dans le foot, dans les autres sports, y'a pas de pb, le public a un esprit sportif et respecte.  Ce n'est que le faute des suporteurs, pour moi, le foot est le sport qui respecte le moins l'esprit sporif.|`|11081f0d7eeec70122773967096a1093aa	non, faut pas voir les choses ainsi. Avec les maghrbins, les siffles ont un rapport avec l'histoire colonial et cela tout le monde le sait. Tendit que les autres pays europens, eux se sont les principaux rivaux de la france tant donn qu'elle est en haut du classement fifa... c'est l'equipe a abatre, volia!|`|05OvNdgAaa	La Tunisie, le Maroc et l'Algrie sont raciste envers les Fran?ais !!|`|m8htTWNhaa	Ben je les plains... enfin nous Fran?ais avons l'habitude de faire face  la mesquinerie du monde entier. Milan Kundera n'a t'il pas dit : "La francophobie c'est une mdiocrit plantaire" ?  @Greg : c'est ?a la Belgique dteste les Fran?ais... je n'en ai pas l'impression, quand je vais sur les forums du"Soir" ou des trucs comme ?a. Ce qui ressort des coms c'est que bcp de Belges font un norme complexe d'infriorit envers la France...|`|B1aGbnYfaa	c'est le rsultat du racisme des francais  l|`|aLiqUBYqaa	Et aprs on dit que c'est les fran?ais les racistes!!!  Y ' a pas photo !|`|IPdsK0kvaa	On peut comprendre que des trangers n'aiment pas la France. Mais des fran?ais d'origine trangre qui sifflent leur propre pays...Pourquoi ne redemandent ils pas la nationalit tunisienne s'ils ne se sentent pas bien comme fran?ais? On ne les oblige pas  tre fran?ais quand mme...  |`|9hIvr7j3aa	Je suis portugais et JE N'AI JAMAIS VU LES PORTUGAIS SIFFLER LA MARSEILLAISE !!!    la dernire confrontation date du 05/07/06  Munich pour la demi finale de la coupe du monde o il n'y avait pas eu de sifflets!!!   la precedente date du 25/04/01 c'etait un match amical   j'ai regard ces deux matchs!!!    arrte de dire n'importe quoi!!!|`|MzaeT9OIaa	T'inquites, les Espagnols sont en train de nous passer devant et les Portugais sont pas loin.     Quand  l'algrie, le Maroc et la Tunisie ?a se passe trs bien quand on va jouer chez eux.  Il faut juste qu'on arrte de les jouer  domicile, ?a ne nous apporte que des problmes.|`|JnyRrBa6aa	Vous vous trompez peut-tre, je suis un supporter de l'italie mais j'aime beaucoup la france et depuis que je connais l'quipe de france, seul la tunisie hier a siffl sur la marseillaise, demande toi cette question: est-ce que je peux siffler sur un hymne?? c'est vrai c'est bte de la part des tunisiens mais peut-tre ils ont rserv ?a  ben arfa. de la part d'un algrien que tu as voqu son pays dans la liste!!!|`|dKPXtCE5aa	tu dis n'importe quoi.  LEs italiens n'aiment pas Domenech. Et fran?ais et italiens sont comme anglais et fran?ais d'il y a qq anne : les meilleurs enemis  Pour les portugais et espagnol, je ne sias pas d'o tu sors ?a. Si la source est de ton grand pre, ?a ne compte pas.   La tunise, le maroc et l'algerie sont dans le mme sac. Pour avoir un lment de rponse, va voir ce qu' dit MALEK E a cette question  http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  |`|qjg3KSunaa	Non , a mon avis la France n'est pas le pays le plus detest du monde mais par contre elle frequente les pays les plus detestables au monde ! Quand on voit la haine deploy hier , du dbut a la fin du match c'est a peine croyable des siflets ininteromputs ! bref hier les fascistes ne jouhaient pas en bleu !! Bon heuresement ils se sont pris leur racl sur le terrain !!|`|vVbxLIAgaa	et oui cest comme ca|`|e0ZaHRjbaa	pour hier ,je crois plutot que c'etait envers ben harfa les sifflements|`|8kf5jmwBaa	@Greg : la belgique n'aime pas la France, normal la france a tout ce que la belgique n'a pas, une bonne equipes de foot et ensuite pas un aussi beau pays!  mais de toutes fa?on vous tes de gros ipocrites, vous detestez les italiens a dire qu'il gouverneront bientot le pays, qu'il prennent le travail des belges et qu'en Plus de ?a beaucoup d'entre eux sont fneant MAIS quand eux joue vous vous dite supporter de l'equipe italiennes et a sortir claxonner quand les azzurri gagne !!!!, Mais sans oublier que quand la france a t en finale en 2006, beaucoup de pure belge ont t chercher des origines fran?aise dans le coin de leur poches ;-) mais ?a on ne dira pas     Sinon pour repondre a la question, la france est un pays a la grande geule lgendaire, voila pourquoi certaines personne n'aime pas la France, mais elle est aussi trs apprcie pour son art et sa qualit de vie! Je ne pense pas que la france soit le pays le plus dtest du monde! je pense que c'est les usa d'abord
