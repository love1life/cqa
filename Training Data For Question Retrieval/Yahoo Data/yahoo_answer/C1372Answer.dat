Find a physician or a psychologist who specializes in working with people who have autism spectrum disorders, and seek an accurate diagnosis.  You may be a very shy person with OCD, and that can be treated successfully.  My guess is that you don't have Asperger's.  But get to s specialist to find out for sure.|`|ttL8zjuZaa	Sure.<br>  We all do.<br>  No really, im like this, if everyone i knew were more interesting  they would be like this. And then awkward social situations could be conversational. My cousins are like this. The whole not knowing where to place body situation is easy, if you want to fix it - Out of Body Experience. Look, just listen to some entrancing music and concentrate on the blood flowing to your brain, especially the lefternmost temple.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	You have something.

Wait...that is Asperger's, isn't it?|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	you need an official diagnosis.|`|AA10914343	NO. <br>  you need to go to school counselor for therapy. sounds like you just have a bad case of social anxiety, as well as some physical issues you REALLY need to work out.<br>  try making eye contact for 2 straight minutes with somoene you trust. after 1 minute, youl start to LOVE it!. its called James's paradigm.
f05KdsZkaa	i don't before now yes, i don't know why.. but i like the answer of someone here, don't fear awkwardness.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	My explanation is that I'm a bit anti-social. Most people I know suck anyways|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Don't know for certain, but maybe it's just because they're not in the work environment, and you might have little else in common. I'm just guessing.. I tend to avoid people if I feel they are unpleasant to be around, people at work; I see enough of already. Sounds normal enough to me! But the only way I know of to be friendly if you don't feel that way, is to say 'Hey' anyway, until you lose your fear of it. You may get enough positive responses from that, that your fear will dissipate. Hard to say, and hard to do. Good luck!|`|EJQRIffaaa	be yourself if your in the mood to chat, chat and be friendly, if not dont, <br>  try not 2 worry what they think of you because they proable would nt think anything other than she is in a rush or didnt see me, or has no time to chat<br>  <br>  no one can be friendly all the time - so dont worry about it,|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Yes and I don't know why! Even if there my friends, I still try to avoid them for some odd reason. I once saw my best friend since pre k and I didn't even say hi!|`|x5ftqjo5aa	Umm...no, usually i acknowledge them and say hi, unless i don't like them|`|XDcOhAALaa	haha. everyone knows how you feel. remember though that even though it may be awkward it often hurts people's feelings when you ignore them or pretend you don't notice them especially if you're the only ones in a hallway or something. just simply say hi. don't look at your feet and keep walking on. People feel unnoticed and hurt when you walk right past them.|`|AA11984907	Only to those I don't get on great, otherwise I do acknowledge them & say Hello & stuff.|`|9fp7LmG9aa	That's hilarious, I try my best to "duck" people that I see when I'm out (you know them, but don't "know" them and if you had a choice you probably wouldn't even know them, let alone "know" them)...I feel your pain.  People are weird like that; I think it validates them to have you acknowledge them.  If I'm spotted (because I'm usually unaware of my surroundings-like most men) I usually just give a quick nod and hurry by like I'm in a rush, the key is not to stop walking...if you stop walking then you are skrewed and will end up talking to them for 5 minutes about absolutely nothing.<br>  The thing that sucks about living somewhere for 15 years is that you can't step outside of your door without being spotted by someone from your past (what really sucks is when you completely forget about someone and they seem to know everything about you-that's really ackward...how do you tell someone that you've erased them from your memory?).

Given that all of the above are raised in approximately the same environment, this would imply a genetic factor in intelligence.|`|sNoRTobUaa	yes it surely does although environment also plays its own part..you can check the source if u need the detail
b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Genetic counseling is used by couples who want to know the chance that their child will have a condition that they have or that runs in their family. This is very commonly used in the Ashkenazi Jewish community because of a greater risk of inherited disease. There really are no risks, it's just a doctor that does a test on a couple and then advises them on the chance that their child will have a condition and what they can do to avoid it or make it less serious. This could definitely be a good option for a lot of people.|`|kNWevwzUaa	because they don't want their future children to inherit their bad genes.<br>  <br>  <br>  If a person has celebral palsey, he or she wants to make sure his or her child doesn't inherit the disease either, because they could born with it worst, severly.<br>  <br>  If me and my future husband are planning to have kids, then I will undergo genetic counseling, so my future children won't inherit my bad genes.
ljaax9Eeaa	You know when your just going to sleep and you get that feeling ofyour falling? And you wake up right away? All that is; is your mind i forcing you to breath. Sometimes when your going to sleep you stop breathing and your blacking out which could kill you if you dont wake up to breath. If you hit the bottom, YES you will die. So dreams sometimes are the real thing. You just dont realize it.|`|kjW1fmmPaa	I have had several dreams that intruders broke into my house and shot me in the head, I swear I felt a burst of heat where  the bullet supposedly hit my head and everything started going black as I struggled to stay alive.  Very scary.  But I woke up alright! If feeling things in your dreams meant they were really happening, it would be a scary world out there.  Remember that dreams are just put out by your brain while you are asleep, they are not real but they may have some underlying meaning, perhaps in your fears or hopes or recent things that have happened to you.<br>  <br>  Now get some rest!|`|0pE3dhT8aa	I guess there is a remote chance if this happened to a very elderly person with a heart condition.

They can freak you out occasionally, but they do not control life and death.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It's not the matrix, but we just don;t know
QodGdcIiaa	Hi! This is such an excellent query. I believe that, as Albert Einstein stated, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination." I feel that imagination is really quite dominant when one permits their heart to be pure. Little children's minds and hearts are so clean and they just explore! All is so new and wonderful to them! SOsososo sadly, as we grow up, it becomes easier to take beautiful details of life for granted. We say "oh, that isn't so great, I've seen it every day of my life." We let negativity enter our hearts and minds. I feel we need to be not childish, but childlike in the sense that we never forget to be grateful for all we have been given, and give back for all our gifts freely with the ideas of our imagination and not be afraid to create! =)<br>  Your question is just so fascinating ! Imagination is such a priceless present to us =))) Love always???? 8-D|`|rWeqefs3aa	I also clearly remember being completely in awe of the world around me, I spent hours on end completely content with life. Also there was an absolute connection between myself and my imagination... there was most definitely an element of magic to my psyche... If you ask me do we lose our gift as we grow? No, I believe it is both our destiny and the key to happness remembering and being consumed by positive energy... sensing good cosmic vibrations. I hope it's a spiritual awakening we learn to accept in time~|`|AA10510845	I don't think the "kid" in us ever really goes away.  It's just that the adult self takes over.  When we're kids, the whole world is an exciting adventurous place, and our imaginations are on overload.  As we mature, imagination takes a back seat and reality becomes more important.  But it's okay to revert back to those imaginative days when everything was new and exciting.  We never really want to lose that ability to dream, have fun,  and lose ourselves in imagination.  That's really the force of creativity that produces writers, artists, musicians and other talented people.  So even in our most stressful moments, it's okay to let that kid within us, come out to play in childlike wonder.|`|NTUr0t3haa	Children's fantasy, imagination, and pretending are developmental tools that prepare them for later stages. Adults don't require that developmental tool so it's used much less. <br>  <br>  Yes, there is a loss of innocence and yes, the imagination gets crowded out by responsibilities and reality-based concerns. But it's not gone.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of adult artists and people who do imaginative things. The imagination is still there if you engage it.|`|VUfhHvjpaa	No, only  a little memory and even that is not true in all cases, but imagination is enhanced.<br>  <br>  I think youngsters today are devoid of imagination. They have too much on their tables to pick and choose and don't have to imagine much at all today.<br>  <br>  When I look at the clouds I see a myriad of shapes and forms that could tell a story....|`|L5ie6msYaa	we do loose imagination. over the year reality hits us, in many negative ways. this reality keeps us so ocuppied thas is hard to even find time to imagine|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	How sad.  Becoming an adult and behaving in a mature manner doesn't mean losing your ability to have fun, have an imagination and even (gasp!) ask silly!  Being creative, humorous, child-like are all essentials in my life as an adult.  We might not always be able to hang onto everything we loved when we were kids, but get yourself some action figures and have yourself a great time!  Nothing wrong with that whatsoever!  I think we often lose that abilityif we start taking everything too seriously.  There is a time and place to be a grown-up.... and a time and a place to let the little kid inside you come out to play.|`|AA11136495	i think its because when we get older we realize how life really is.. As a kid everything seems to be a possibility, we dont know the limits to life,   various laws of order in the world, and just generally how things "must" go in the adult world..

Anyone different is looked down upon in the adult world it seems, children have the freedom of mind to be creative.<br>  just a guess :}|`|KpoEH9Wmaa	the world is no longer truly good. sometimes, it is truly the young that will suffer. in this world, the most idiotic adults are children and the youngest kids that are truly the adult.

As the first answerer said, when you are a kid EVERYTHING seems possible in the future. YOU could be the next president! YOU can be a ballerina if you want to! YOU could be a famous artist! Then you get older and you realize that you hardly have a chance of becoming president, you do not have the body type to be a ballerina, and that artists don't make any money and only are 'discovered' after they die. <br>  Reality sinks in and your dreams sink with it.
QZno7ch9aa	No :-)
HimBbU6caa	I'm a heterosexual male who accepts all forms of sexuality. I may have a hard time understanding them all, but I respect them. I don't frown upon two for men being lovers or having relationships. I don't frown on two women for being lovers or having relationships. I just have no interest in seeing or hearing about two men having sexual interaction of any kind. As far as two women...well Iet's just say that I don't turn the channel when they start to get it on.<br>  <br>  I'm far from a homophobic person, on the contrary, when I lived in Hawaii from 2007 to the middle of 2008 I had a great male friend who was homosexual. Me being a man I just don't want to see two men getting down that way. I think that erotic moments between two individuals that are witnessed by others subconsciously puts the observer in that situation. It's the same situation when people watch porn. People watch it in order to somehow put themselves in that mix. That's why you have strait men like me who would rather not see two men kissing. It puts me in that mix somehow. I don't want to be in that mix.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm not dumb enough to think that two women engaging in sexual relations is not homosexuality. I think people should understand that there are people here who accept other peoples beliefs. I think I made my case for how I feel and i believe it is fair. For those who can't accept it or call me a hypocrite well it's just got to be that way.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Nah...the guys who are homophobic don't view girl on girl porn as homosexuality really.<br>  <br>  They view it as entertainment created purely for their viewing pleasure.  <br>  As they watch, their minds have jumped far ahead of the scene they're viewing to the part where the two girls become focused on him instead of each other.<br>  <br>  It's all about what they're gonna do for him, and the fact that they use each other to warm up just further defines them as "dirty girls, or bad girls"  - i.e. girls willing to indulge all of his fantasies.<br>  <br>  They are completely convinced that all that action is preliminary.  The thought NEVER enters their minds that the women might not even like guys.  <br>  <br>  Refer to Sidifiri and Martillo...different reference points to the same conclusion. For the guys who watch girl on girl, hedonism is the attraction -homosexuality is a coincidental side effect.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	The whole point of the fantasy is that he, and he alone, can convert both women to heterosexuality if they could just experience his amazing prowess in the sack.|`|srIMFTb8aa	Such men will accept anything if it turns them on.  Hypocrisy at its finest.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hey, Elaine, are you busy tonight? ;)|`|Xa4Ov1Haaa	You make a good point. Unfortunately, there a countless good points like this that can be made against every form of racial or sexual bigotry, as well against religion (which I mention because you mention the bible in your question). And still, regardless of all sense and logic and reason, there have always been and probably will always be millions (or even billions) of bigots and religious people in the world.<br>  <br>  If you're religious, I apologize for clumping religious people and bigots into one category. But for the purpose of my answer to your question, I consider both religion and bigotry to be so packed full of logical inconsistencies and holes and flaws that it blows my mind that anyone believes in any of it.|`|AA10712251	its a fantasy thing. almost every man dreams of having 2 woman at the same time. theory is that in any 3 some 2 of them have to  be gay/bi. a heterosexual male can easily visualize himself in the picture; showing them what a man can do that a woman cant. he will not even thinking of stepping between 2 men.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Way to many people are screwed up when it comes to sexuality, They point the finger at others and then get married, cheat, beat up their wives.

They don't think the "two pretty lesbians" are really homosexual.<br>  <br>  Or maybe they think the only real (read: really scary) homosexuality is male, because of their general beliefs regarding male superiority.|`|MeZrMoGyaa	Because they like women.

Personally, I dream quite a lot when I nap, have a lot on my mind, or when I have been thinking a lot.  The things you eat, and when you eat them can influence your dreams a lot too, because, when your body is active, your mind has to tell your body to do things so its having to do more work when you are asleep.  I think thats why you aren't supposed to eat right before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have anxiety, you will have a lot of vivid dreams too.  If you are worried about something, your mind will race when you are asleep.<br>  <br>  I'm a vivid dreamer, so I try to notice when I dream.

If you want to apply a name/ "disorder" to what makes you an individual or different so be it.<br>  <br>  I find it funny though...that the only people who seek medical attention for these things are those who are financially stable.<br>  Come to the west side of Buffalo and ask my neighbors if they don't feel crazy sometimes.<br>  <br>  <br>  We'll stick to our 40's.<br>  <br>  Pills are not the answer.<br>  <br>  Though I'm getting slightly off topic I'd like to say that throughout history there have been many individuals who suffered from severe depression and still went on to accomplish great things. Some even inspired by their misery.I worry that as antidepressents and other meds become more and more culturally accepted we may miss out on some very creative people.<br>  <br>  Not to mention in a society where everything is about name brands and authenticity one would think that so many wouldn't be willing to settle for artificial happiness but instead seek the real deal.<br>  <br>  I might buy a RCA DVD player but I wont settle for artificial happiness.<br>  <br>  <br>  One more thing. There is no way enough research has been done to find out what the long term effects of many of these drugs might have on future generations.|`|rbGoxvI6aa	First thing I thought of. At least it contributes to the discussion.<br>  <br>  I think that anything out of a limited range of behaviors is fixed by medication because our society is more limited. Now all children must go to school and it is getting to the point where all children have to go to college.Because of a lack of job opportunities outside of academics people must have personalities that allow them to stay concentrated on the work or they will fail(And Society would value them less). <br>  <br>  "Why do you think this wasn't a big problem in the last generation?"<br>  Less ridged society. Not everyone had to be the school or college type.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT <a href="http://encefalus.com/sociopolitical/psychiatry-antipsychiatry-history-mental-disease/" rel="nofollow">http://encefalus.com/sociopolitical/psyc...</a> I think you will enjoy that :) I forgot all about the mass amount of money drug companies make!|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	Not all eccentric and unconventional behavior is classified in the disorder category.  Disorders are those behaviors that hinder or cripple normal and healthy relationships and work.  <br>  <br>  I think more of them are being diagnosed for a couple reasons.  One reason is that there is so much more understanding of human behavior and personality.  I had some "disorder" traits as a child, but back then there wasn't a very good understanding of childhood depression, for example, or ADD.<br>  <br>  The other reason is because so many "disorders" have their root in dysfunctional families and those are increasing exponentially.  <br>  <br>  I know eccentric people and people who are unconventional, who think differently, but also manage to fit into everyday society and, in fact, spice it up and bring a unique perspective.|`|DUUJryfEaa	Unconventional behavior is only a problem if it affects your ability to function in daily life.  Other than that, it probably can be seen as just a personality quirk or an idiosyncracy. I would rather people think differently from each other and be themselves than trying to fit in and be "normal."  Mental illness has been a problem since the dawn of mankind, but really has only been addressed in the last couple of centuries, as our society and culture have evolved, if even that far back. It is only a big problem now that we are bringing it to awareness and trying to correct it.|`|0DtsNuWAaa	Yes, I am trying to find out, if my BF has a disorder, or if he is just socially inept<br>  <br>  Please help me with this serious situation...thanks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AknxmOMwz.fMZhMa9uclevfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222043528AAdM3k9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

dCM320w7aa	I respect them. Loners are usually people who are not influenced by what other people think. Anyone can get in a clique and have a groupie mentality.<br>  <br>  I do think that they should come out of their shell and talk to people more. They could be missing out on meeting some great friends.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I feel that we have never had the right people in our lives to trust, believe in, and have been hurt too much by others so we end up having a hard time forming friendships...|`|s5ZZaANDaa	They're not living a fulfilling life|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	I think is something wrong  with them!|`|ODTe2l77aa	Sometimes people just don't like other people.

I am not a loner, so I sometimes have a hard time understanding someone who chooses to keep people at a distance.  Most of the time, my guess is that there are profound trust issues from past experiences with family and other people.
ZvWt2qEQaa	You were so scare, you bit your teeth hard and arch your back to brace for your fall so you wake up in pain.|`|fUKWTjjiaa	there's a name for that kind of dream, can't remember. anyway, did you do anything the day before to inflict this eg. weight lifting, hit your teeth?|`|zx8fi7a1aa	sometimes dreams are affected by something happening to your physical body in real life...that does not always discount any meaning behind the dream though...<br>  <br>  it could've been that at the time you were running from something that was spiritually enlightening...at the same time you may have felt like your life was getting out of control and you were becoming anxious about it...<br>  <br>  your teeth and back pain could also represent that you were growing anxious about your losing your inner strength and ability to grow spiritually.|`|3k7YtxeEaa	Perhaps the tension and fear of the dream was causing you to grit your teeth and tense your back muscles to a painful intensity.  This pain then became a part of the dream and was, naturally, still there when you awoke. <br>  <br>  Dreams are weird!|`|SCeIOtZpaa	It was a vivid dream, that was in your mind. <br>  <br>  Once I had a dream that I had surgery, and when I woke up I was scared to roll over because I didn't want to hurt my stitches.. then I realized I had just been dreaming.. but it still kind of hurt.|`|5O4kuA7Caa	I think its one of those dreams where when you get hurt in real life, it shows in your dream. like for example if someone hit you on the back when you were dreaming, you would see something happen to your back in your dream.|`|cbeFe1VGaa	Your teeth and back were probably hurting in real life and the pain transpired into your dream, thus influencing the dream. <br>  <br>  As to why you were feeling pain in these areas could be a number of reasons....<br>  <br>  Pain just spontaneously arises and falls like the breath.
ZvWt2qEQaa	You are having a crush on that guy so you dream about him. Wake up and do something about it, stop dreaming, go get him before someone else does.|`|fETbCVXbaa	This dream is showing you what you really want. Maybe you think he likes you back. My teacher was talking to us about dreams one day adn he threw in a question, "Did you have the dream or did the dream have you?" Think about that. There is this country where they think that you are actaully awake in your dreams and that is "real life" and when ur "awake" your not really awake. You use 10% of your brain power when you are "awake" and 90% dreaming. Kinda weird...
aDHjec5gaa	It's okay to like sadistic and cruel things, a lot of people do. The thing is, normal people aren't influenced by those kinds of things and they aren't stupid enough to actually do those things you see. You can see all sorts of horrible things, but if you start to want to do those things, then you should get help.|`|JLBuXqStaa	I don't know...but I like books and movies like that too.<br>  I think theyre just more interesting.
OtKCAeQZaa	Stop being alone get out and do something even if it means to go for long walk do it.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Ultimately, you can't stop someone from doing anything.  That being said, I do have a suggestion for you.  I'm assuming there are some specific people who do most of the gossiping.  Next time you are at work, approach those people, smile your best smile, say hello, then let them know that if they ever decide to find out if anything they are saying or hearing about you is true, they are welcome to come talk directly to you about it and you'll let them know.  Then walk away, still with the smile on your face.|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Gossiping always happens at work unfortunately.  Some people are just like that.  They will gossip about anyone or anything, it's pretty pathetic, but just remember you're better than that and try not to let it get you down.|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	stop talking to them!!<br>  Ignore them!!<br>  don't get your self so much attention!<br>  watch who you go out with, and whom you talk to!|`|3WItFAwlaa	You have two options.  You can either cut their tongues out or kill them.  If you cut their tongues out, they will probably text each other about you.  So you have to kill them.

UXxDUjnMaa	well its not just with high school guys its with men to, there all afraid of rejection and embarrasment. wouldnt you be nervous if u had to ask a guy you really like if he wanted to hang out, and not just be friends? its in there retarded nature! and if he's geeky im sure he doesnt think he's good enough for you and is prolly thinking that you think that as well. you have to understand with all that pressure on a guy who isnt very good in school is geeky and has prolly never kissed a girl (or even had a girlfriend) and is trying to look cool in front of his friends. you can only imagine why he is nervous. and even men are like that they never grow up!! trust me on that one!! hope i help you!! :)|`|AA10510845	Just to set the record straight, guys who have facial tics doesn't mean they're geeks.  They probably have Tourettes, and they can't help blinking or other tics.  If the guy is hesitant to ask you out, he probably is fearful of being rejected.  Why don't you ask him out if you'd like to go out with him?  Girls do that nowadays.  You don't have to do anything expensive, maybe just hang out together someplace, and have a soda, or just sit and talk and get to know each other.  At least that will break the ice, and then the next time, it will be his turn to ask you out.  Good luck!|`|AA11324847	First off, if he knows the girl liked him, there would be NO hesitation. You overestimate your signals. Guys have been trained not to read much into things, girls flirt with us all the time, yet when we call em on it, we get that look like a stalker and that "we're just friends" sh**. And if they are nervous, do you honestly not know why? Figure it out, it shouldn't take long....oh and another thing, usually the hot girls are sluts and easy and mean so most guys avoid them we're not stupid.|`|A9JV4uAxaa	I personally think that it may be one of three things...<br>  <br>  1. There affraid of rejection<br>  2. They dont know how to ask it<br>  3. They get nervous when the do it(i.e red face, sweaty palms)<br>  <br>  99% of the time the reason why they won't ask you out is because of these three things.|`|iSDs32e2aa	Afraid of rejection all guys are|`|JLBuXqStaa	1. who is david yurman?<br>  2. maybe hes just nervous around you...|`|cT9WK2oqaa	O.K, so i believe it has a lot to do with the fact that you're a diva. lol. most diva's reject "geeks". he most likely has the idea in his head that you think he's a dork and would never date anyone of "his Kind". i believe that if you show a little more interest and made it obvious about your attraction to him, he would feel more comfortable as to ask you out. also, don't be afraid to ask him out. in a girly way of course! lol.|`|fIoi3HWxaa	That exact reason: they are nervous. They think they arent on your level, as in they arent good enough for you. Think about it, if he gets rejected everything will go downhill for him. But if he doesnt, he immediately gets instant gratification. Besides, girls often see guys as rock solid emotional boxes, which by all means untrue. We have a sh*t load of emotions. We just arent as open about it due to our peers judging us.|`|XAkLPdhqaa	Rejection is the answer. But I feel like nothing ventured, nothing gained. The worst you could do is say no, and then it's on to someone else. There are yes's out there.|`|9FPmnhNbaa	he has got no balls. <br>  you may just have to set up the date.<br>  or maybe he just isnt ready to go out with someone.<br>  chill out.|`|9wojIiiWaa	jsut ask him out, and u sound skanky, also we nurvous because gurls are biatches lol and if a guy asks u out u go spread the roumor or somecrap about saying no to him. its these little things that giv you girls a bad name

I like having the ability to hear both sides of a disagreement and understanding what both sides are about without injecting emotion into everything. I like having way more tolerance of other people's nasty behavior just because both sides of my brain work together and I can understand that everything everyone does is for a reason, whether it be good, bad, planned, reactive, or filtered through emotion or trauma or whatever.

eU2wZy7Aaa	You can do so much with a degree in anthropology. You can work in a museum, in academia (professor/scholar), travel for research, work as an independent contractor for businesses, etc. There are actually four different branches of anthropology. <br>            1) Cultural Anthropology - studies people of the world and their cultures and behaviors<br>           2) Biological Anthropology - studies human and other types of evolution and the biological factors involved<br>            3) Archaeology - digging in the dirt<br>            4) Linguistic Anthropology - studying different languages of the world<br>   <br>   I hope this helps - Also, you probably will need a Ph.D at some point, or at least a Master's if you seriously watnt to pursue anthropology as a career!

When I learned that feathers are constructed differently based upon the function they fulfill on the bird's body my behavior did not change at all.<br>  <br>  I believe learning is built upon what you know before.  You can only learn when the foundation for new knowledge has been put in place.<br>  <br>  Sometimes learning changes behavior.  When I learn that a bowl of frosting only requires about 1/4 cup milk, I stop using more and my frosting isn't so soupy

DUUJryfEaa	There are plenty of mental disorders that exist, like schizophrenia, attention-deficit disorder, bipolar, all sorts of personality disorders, neuroses, etc., some more severe than others.  My advice is to do some research, there are plenty of websites on mental health out there, and then choose what most interests you.|`|FIcc1OREaa	How about "The Effects of Sexual Repression In Public Figures?"<br>  <br>  It's interesting that many public figures who take a strong stand against sexuality end up getting caught doing that very thing or worse and are publicly humiliated for it.

C0K3Bo2Aaa	More cavity's from less brushing :(
UBcBjRMfaa	Another answer to your question is that a nation sharing a common history will find pride. Nationalism is a pride in a common language, identity, and history that people in a certain country share. The history of the United States pulling away from Europe and needing to join together in order to remain strong enough to cut those ties would be an example. As a Canadian I take pride in things like Vimy Ridge, which really established Canadians as Canadians. Before that war we were simply a British Colony. Look at us now. :)|`|CwJVeYlBaa	Well to understand history is to know that history repeats itself. Every generation has repeated events such as Alexander the Great's Empire that was basically stopped cold by massive beasts now known as elephants. They can be compared to Hitler's empire and the elephants that stopped him. Those elephants were tanks. So the best answer to your question is to just take national history, make a comparisson from past events, and Then finish it with a conclusion about history repeating itself, and how to learn and progress from blunderss or advance from inovations.

3k7YtxeEaa	Sometimes in dreams, babies represent responsibility.<br>  <br>  Have you ever asked someone for help with a problem and they answered you,  "That YOUR baby!"  They mean, "That's your problem, your job, your mess to clean up.  Leave me out of it."<br>  <br>  I see you've been car shopping.  Perhaps that has left you feeling a big overwhelmed with responsibility.  Remember, when driving, or making any choices about your life, the responsibility to choose what is right is ultimately YOURS.  No matter what your friends advise or pressure you to do or choose, you are the one who will get the blame if things go wrong, and you are the one who will have to live with the results of your decisions.  Of course, others may be blessed or suffer due to your choices as well.... such as any victims you might create if you drink and drive, or drive irresponsibly in some other way.  That is just one more reason to try to make the most responsible choices.<br>  <br>  Of course, this may not be about your car, at all.  It could be about another specific issue, or your daily struggles in trying to make the best choices no matter who is trying to influence you.<br>  <br>  Pray for wisdom and do what you know is RIGHT and RESPONSIBLE, not what seems "cool," or "popular" or will satisfy the momentary whim of a friend.<br>  <br>  God bless you!<br>  Fairelight|`|zx8fi7a1aa	dreams aren't always literal...in fact, more often they are metaphorical (a picture of something else)...<br>  <br>  the baby boy could represent a new idea you either have or will have and may have developed from gaining insight through other's ideas...maybe someone you trust...|`|5mHF9C8Iaa	Maybe you are frightened of getting pregnant?

I think you need to see a psychiatrist, because only a professionally trained person can get to the root of your problem.  Having imaginary friends is nothing to be ashamed of, but everyone needs social contact with real people in order to have fulfillment in life.  I know you're hurting inside, so you need to see someone who can help you.  Real people are not all out to hurt you, dear. But living the secluded life you've been in, can do you much more harm.

NDyaprhgaa	People have to learn to love themselves. You have noticed good traits so you have some love for yourself. Personally I think people feel this because they lack confidence. I feel the more confidence a person has, the happier they are and the more they love themselves.<br>  <br>  You figure out who you are through the different experiences you go through. You are only 21 people don't expect you to know yourself and you shouldn't either. People who think they know themselves will one day find their self experiencing something that changes the idea they have of them self. <br>  <br>  If you know what your studying aren't your true passions you really shouldn't pursue with them. They are not going to make you any happier. Look for something you enjoy. A subject that has similarities with a hobby you have or a career that's a hobby.<br>  <br>  You need to live your life without worrying about things like this.<br>  You never will need to know who you are. & You are completely right.<br>  One day you may find the answer to your question no searching necessary.|`|QqoIJNXBaa	We are a lot alike! I really like what you said at the end of your question: "maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself".

Talk to them about this stuff!<br>  <br>  Listen to your heart. Is there something you've been curious about but never looked into? Like a subject at school, a hobby, a dance move? Whatever it is, go for it! Keep pursuing even the slightest curiosity until you find what's going to make you happy.

Most of them haven't finished school if they are in college, or haven't moved out of their parents houses yet, You haven't lived a heck of a long time, why would you know who you are yet??? You haven't really experienced enough of life yet to know what you truly want.  IF you don't want a business degree than change your major, Go to the counseling department  and see if they can give you an aptitude test which would help you decide where your talents lie and where that might lead you.  You're only 21 there is a lot of life left yet for you to get to know yourself.  There is time yet give yourself time and it will come to you.|`|af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	What you reflect is not a lack of self love, but a lack of self like.

Everyone looks at the world in a different way.<br>  <br>  For me a good life is having someone who I love and having that someone love me back just as much.  Also having good friends you can turn to.<br>  And also being financially secure so you can do what you want when you want and being able to help out friends when they are in need.<br>  <br>  A good day for me is something that is very hard for me to have.  I'm disabled and have pain in all my joints, mostly in a back that is being eaten away.  So, a good day for me is a day I can get up in the morning without too much pain, get dressed and go out and have <br>  brunch with my husband and then go take a walk or do something like shopping or go to a museum.<br>  <br>  A good person is someone who is open to all things in the world and doesn't judge.  Of course for me, it is someone who understands that I can't always make dates we have scheduled and I can't always answer the phone.  But other than that, it's someone who doesn't judge if you have different tastes in movies, food, politics, whatever, you are accepted for who you are and are not attempted to be changed.  A good friend is just there for you at all times, even in the middle of the night if something horrible happens.  You do what you can to make a good person feel even better just because you want to, not because you feel like you have to.  They are someone you are not afraid to say anything to as you know you are accepted as you are.  A really good person is hard to find.  I know several and they make my life worth living.|`|2qIg8Tunaa	To me a good life is earning a living by doing something you absolutely love, spending that life with the one person you can't live without and not having to worry about not having enough money to pay the bills. A good day would be anyday that I wake up no matter what happens. And as far as what makes a good person is anyone who is totally honest, non-judgemental, open-minded and learns from their mistakes. That may just be my opinion, but I have had one hell of a life and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.|`|B00vcfVEaa	A good life is when a lot of things go your way.<br>  A good day is when a lot of things go your way still.<br>  A good person cares about others and helps no matter what the personal cost.<br>  <br>  I'm not a very good person I think.|`|AA10500537	when you have someone  that loves you.<br>  when things go great<br>  someone you can trust .

2iqBP8cLaa	Start a grateful journal - write in it every day, even just 5 things (or more) of things you are grateful for however small.  It could be the light through the leaves, you have shelter and food, you are healthy.<br>  <br>  To relax from the anger, take just five deep breaths, in through the nose slowly, pause, and out through the mouth.  Silently say "In", "Pause" and "Out" as you're doing so.  (This has saved me from severe anxiety).  Those thoughts will enter - try to enter your breathing time - just acknowledge it's attempt, then go immediately back to the breathing.  After a couple of weeks of this you will notice it becomes really a lot easier to relax when you're feeling upset, angry, resentful.  The grateful journal will be a daily reminder of things you still like in this life and help you to live in the moment.<br>  <br>  I read this book, "Calming the Anxious Mind" which really helped me out a lot.

6ndM8fNLaa	Find out what you are so angry about and what is making you sad and bitter. Really reflect upon it and decide what needs to be changed based off this. Every morning or the night before, make a list of new goals - maybe only one goal at first - for the new day ahead of you. Check it off at the end of the day if you accomplished that new goal and you will have a new found self-confidence and feeling of power when you do that. If you did not get around to accomplishing that goal, it's ok. Everybody has done that in their lives, not completing every little thing they wanted to. But you get back on your feet each day and have something to look forward to. Also, how is your social life? Try getting to know others and serving others. It will help you to keep your mind off things that are bothering you for a while and you may even feel good about yourself for being nice and helpful to other people. Go and have fun once in a while too! You will be great if you put your mind to it and try not to be so hard on yourself.|`|AA10510845	I think you're going through the angst that most teenagers experience.  Mostly, it's due to hormonal changes in your body as you develop into adulthood.  You'll find as you get older, that things calm down quite a bit, and your whole perspective of yourself will change.  Meantime, I know it's a pretty rocky road.  Maybe you should talk to a counselor or therapist and tell him or her your concerns and feelings.  It often helps to talk these things out.  In addition, concentrate on your studies at school, because a good education is important, and you're not too young to decide what you want to do as a career.  And finally, choose your friends wisely -- not the ones that will get you in trouble, but people you can have fun and recreation with.  Maybe a girlfriend is what you need to help you be at your best.  And do the things you love, whether it's sports, movies, collecting things or other hobbies.  Keeping your mind active is good therapy for anyone, and especially young folks who are under stress like yourself.  Be patient.  Things will change for the better.

You want to make a change so now you can. You just need to change your way of thinking. Everytime we do something we have a choice. Identify your choices and pick the one that works best for you and makes you feel good about yourself. You have the choice to smile or frown, the choice to criticize yourself or boost your own morale. Start boosting it by cutting yourself some slack and focusing on the good things about yourself. Make a list if you have to. Focus on some of the good things in your life. There are people out there that have no family, friends and not even a warm place to sleep. If I can't find anything to be grateful for there is at least that. Also the more you go out and do-like trying new positive things-leaves less time for worrying and introspection. Most people have the power to make great changes-they just haven't realized it. You can do it.

iUzSlmSbaa	I agree but I have to say that I found it absolutey irresponisble of the parents to leave litte Madeleine alone in the hotel room when the hotel offered a kind of ''creche'' where she could have played under supervision.. those people are well educated people the McCann's both of them and even someone who is a dustbin man and a woman who is a high school dropout.. knows that it's absolutely irresponsible to leave so young a child alone in a hotel room.. even if they went upstairs every so often to check on her.. what kind of parents do that? Either they hire a nanny to look after the girl or they could have accepted the offer of the hotel.. put her in the ''creche'' she would still be alive now.. nobody knows she is dead .. but chances that she is still alive are getting pretty slim.. she has been missing for too long unless she was sold to some kind of child molestor who is fond of blue eyed blond haired little girls.. I am sorry I don't understand what went through the mind of the parents on that evening when they decided to go downstairs and dine and dance.. and occasionally run up to check on her.. makes no sense at all from two people who are supposed to have some common sense.. They have part of the blame to bear.. as they were irresponsible parents.. even if they could  not know this could happen but a responsible parent with a bit of sense would never have left her alone..I don't know how they can sleep at night and not blame themselves as well...|`|4NcshCDvaa	Poor little girl. <br>  <br>  : ( <br>  <br>  such a precious little girl!

XDcOhAALaa	It's because, in reality, they are short. Dreams are thought to last only several seconds to several minutes. REM lasts only a half an hour at the most. REM (rapid eye movement) is what happens while you have dreams. <br>  <br>  Plus a lot of times dreams are repeated in your mind during sleep making the dream seem longer. <br>  <br>  When you explain a dream it may seem short because you may only be summarizing it. Either that or you've forgotten most of your dream which happens to a lot of people. We only remember a fraction of our dreams.

uDUk0SCEaa	Interesting question.<br>  <br>  Pupils dilating indicates that the eye is trying to take in more light. This means that the brain is trying to see something better.<br>  <br>  Psychology studies have suggested that our eyes dilate when we see something we like. Alternatively, our pupils can dilate when we see something we don't understand/recognize/identify.<br>  <br>  Additionally, our pupils tend to dilate when light reaching the eye decreases.<br>  <br>  This can be a result of something blocking ambient light, or it can also be a result of something being darker. Further, it could be a change in the amount of light that is hitting the thing you are looking at.<br>  <br>  Also, our eyes have more than one response based on the speed that they are working at.<br>  <br>  For example, when you are looking at something that is moving, your eye will shift priority to higher speed, which uses less detail. Conversely, when you DO identify something and your eye wants to pull in more detail from something that isn't moving, your eye can dilate to take a more thorough look.<br>  <br>  Unlike a camera, our brains store visual information according to subject, so you can recall a lot of visual information based on what it was. Looking longer at something that isn't moving will cause your eyes to try to pull in more information for that subject and that subject will increase in importance to you.<br>  <br>  Now, there's also a difference between your pupils dilating and 'starting to dilate'. What you could be noticing is a normal bit of shifting in dilation to quickly compensate for light...<br>  <br>  BUT the eyes also have the ability to tune localized sensitivity (much like a camera has an ISO setting for its sensitivity, but the eye can do this just in certain regions). This is what allows for your eye to see a lot of detail in bright areas and shadow areas at the same time, such as when looking through a window.<br>  <br>  This sensitivity is a lot slower to adjust than the pupil's dilation. You can see evidence of this when you look at a light bulb, then look away and close your eyes. You will see a reverse 'imprint' of the light bulb. That's a change in sensitivity for just that area and it's happening in the retina. As the retina adjusts for that small area, the pupil will slightly dilate to take in more light from other areas (it already contracted to react to the strong light from the light bulb).<br>  <br>  This back and forth happens constantly. The eye is always adjusting different regions and fine tuning the dilation of the eye to get the best balance for what it can see in dark/light areas. And it usually occurs as the pupil contracting dramatically on a scene change, then slowly dilating to find the best balance.<br>  <br>  What does it mean for you? Well it might mean that you find that person visually appealing or visually interesting. Or it could mean nothing at all.

I have no idea how you homosexuals react when you believe you're in "love."  My experience lies exclusively with heterosexual relationships.  However I suspect that, being both males, your heightened promiscuity would double the odds of one of you cheating on the other.<br>  <br>  My practical advice, however, is that your decision to marry your partner will have little to no outcome on your future.  That is because homosexual "marriages" have no legal significance or recognition in nearly any country of the world or any state in the union of the United States.  Either of you may forgo the relationship at any time without risking legal consequences.  So go ahead and do whatever you want.|`|uhchod38aa	It's a sweet and romantic idea but I'm going to disagree with it. The people who have been together for years can tell themselves that.

Nothing wrong with it, I'd rather be divorced than married to the wrong man, but definitely prefer he be the right one and be married once having it last a lifetime. <br>  <br>  Been 5 years now and we're both sure, but we've both been sure before and had it not work so we're still waiting for marriage. We both feel the same about it, and hope to never be divorced, so we're living as a married couple just haven't taken the vows. So far so good. <br>  <br>  We're thinking in the next year we'll probably get engaged and then married within a couple/few years...we'll see how it goes. <br>  <br>  I believe in the end we'll be 100% sure, or we won't and then we're likely to just go our separate ways because we do think we'll *know* for sure.

We knew we would grow up and get married.  He was The One.  He introduced me to his friend (now my husband), but we didn't pay much attention to each other.<br>  <br>  The boyfriend figured out he was gay.  His friend and I became friends.  After several years of hanging out we decided to date, mostly because neither of us had much luck getting dates - we were both very shy.  Eventually we moved in together then we got married.  We've been together over 20 years now.<br>  <br>  I don't think you always know the right one when you first meet them.  Lasting relationships develop out of friendship and respect and a willingness to work together.  My husband is my best friend, and he always will be.  We're not the most exciting couple, but we love each other.
OFHh0KJaaa	Well, we are going to have one giant ghetto. High rime rates And if there is no tax funded police protection, and anarchy reigns. There will be looks of murders and women being raped. Examine the ghetto in America. <br>  <br>  In Washington DC in the inner ghetto cops are so busy chasing fatherless bastards around, that it takes about 6 hours to get to a call. A lot can happen in 6 hours ladies. And in DC, as in NYC, there is a gun ban. So only the criminals can kill when they want too. And they love the idea of an unarmed public unable to shoot back. <br>  <br>  In this mobocracy, or ghettocracy, it will eventually either collapse, or turn into a police state, or dictatorship.

My guess is the second.<br>   Anyway before I get onto the issue of worry I have a few points to make. Firstly, many of the laws concerning womens participation in the labour market are about eqaul access, this is only fair in the eyes of compitition. Since women occupy certain sectors of the labour market and positions in others without the help of positive action it is likely this will continue to be the case. Other provisions would suffer this is a problem. Secondly it is exactly the lack of meddling by the state in the financial sector that started the world economic crisis in the first place. This is almost unanimously recognised by economists and is vindicated by its occurence in the most liberal economy in the west and the fact that states such as Germany, Canada and China with regulation and balanced bugets by government meddling have survive. This is also why the G7 are meeting to take about regulation and not deregulation.<br>   Worried? A bit but the fact is Welfare States are very hard to remove. If there is support for a benifit or programme a democratic government will find it hard to withdraw. This is why benifit retrenchment often targets marginal sections of people. If women are to be disadvantaged in terms of benifit reciept etc governments will lose their support. This is one of the reasons that despite the attack on welfare states since the 1980s they are still in place and in some cases expanding.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	I think that after the infrastructure collapses, and we go back to a more natural state of things, our culture will become much more egalitarian, as the contributions of women will once again be seen as having true merit.

Second, all of the programs we push have lobbied for the government to instate have been to benefit those who most need the help, and combined, do not add up to a fraction of what has been spent on the nuclear arms that we are now trying to figure out how to dispose of.  <br>  <br>  The "big government" complaint from the right has zero credibility right now.

Of course they know that it involves some nudity beforehand, so if they didn't want to take off their clothes they wouldn't have contacted SG in the first place.|`|TmvVyS1haa	I think everyone should be naked if they want to be haha. seriously if you're comfortable with your own body, than whose to say whether or not it's bullshit to show it off right?|`|0AIGhZiIaa	I would say from what you've said, most definitely so.|`|X6HUimEFaa	Probably.|`|AA11739944	No, it's a real thing. I know someone who once wanted to do that.|`|wqQf6IKqaa	Ewww those people are soo disgusting....|`|CaE3JOMbaa	No, I think they believe what they say. I'm not saying I agree with them however.|`|K8CGXTLQaa	What's wrong with getting girls to pose around naked? I'm a guy and I'm always naked!|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	In a word, yes.|`|3Fma3URSaa	Yes|`|DXzUCgj8aa	i love being naked!!!|`|jkOQQBihaa	It's about sexual freedom intermixed with body art. Not all Suicide girls have tattoos. But yes, it is about modeling. Not all SGs get naked. It's about the Rockabilly, Goth, Tattooed, Pierced community.<br>  <br>  TALK GIRLS INTO GETTING NAKED?<br>  <br>  They company is owned by a girl, and women have to undergo an interview and application process before being accepted. Men don't make SGs do ANYTHING. You should have asked a better question:  What is Suicide Girls Really All About?  That would have been a better question instead of making uninformed statements|`|VOlFnLbXaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiYqpOwEUwd2f52KtTuW.n7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222024220AA4TwHC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>   <br>  answer im not askin im tellin|`|XDcOhAALaa	simply, their whores that don't know what to think of themselves or their bodies.<br>  <br>  totally unnattractive.|`|ET6SbXGcaa	yes. and i'm sure those girls do it for money and not to teach people how beauty is unique.|`|x5ftqjo5aa	i hate the Suicide Girls|`|Gwl9AeJ1aa	NO.<br>  **** off.|`|LzzTpVEUaa	That's what I think.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	the girls know they're gonna get naked and want to, who cares what they say|`|yU2WHyvgaa	of course
ljaax9Eeaa	lol...im 18 and i think your dream is just trying to be creative with you. Your just expeirencing wildness. Meaning your brain is giving you adventure, except for the part where your mom dies...Thats sad. :) hope that helps you out alittle|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	How weird. I've also had many disneyland dreams. I've come to realize that it's connected with my sexuality. It's a "fun wild ride", you know what I mean? You get to finally go! My dreams never actually had a boy in them, but there were other "feelings" at the end of each dream? When you are a little kid, you wonder and try to imagine what that could all be about, plus you are putting together, subconsciously, what your future mate should be like. That's why you experienced two ages in your dream.<br>  <br>  The act is also a little scary, you have to admit, too, hence the scorpions. It's scary to be so vulnerable.

Hp2DKNH5aa	satan uses guilt to attack the faithful.<br>  <br>  That said how about replacing that guilt with the thought that if you find a job better suited to your personality that just maybe you are vacating a job someone else needs much better than the one they have.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	I think this is a new phenomenon that is affecting a lot of Americans.  To almost have a sense of guilt for having nice things or having the ability of making decisions that some people may not be able to even think about in this time.  It is similar to a feeling of survivors guilt.  Essentially it could be determined as a sense of survivors guilt, since your head is still above water so to speak whereas others are struggling to make it and some have even gone completely under.  Just be cautious as most of us are and if you find a better opportunity for yourself, then take it.  Just make sure not to make any hasty decisions as you have a good foothold where you are now.  Good luck to you.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	There is an emotional phenomenon people experience during times of local or national distress, known as "survivor guilt."  Right now during this time of immense national upheaval when so many people have lost their jobs and whole companies have been closed down, some people feel somewhat guilty (although grateful) that they have been spared that and still have a job.  Realistically, you still have the right to seek alternate employment for a sense of increased personal fulfillment.  Maintain a realistic sense of gratitude for the job you already have and feel free to continue looking.
AcgDcQG0aa	Perhaps unionized companies can't compete well against non-unionized companies due to higher wages and more expensive benefits for unionized workers.  Which leads to the demise of unionized companies and loss of jobs for the unionized workers.  <br>  <br>  But unionized workers who work for various governments are still doing quite well because they have no competition to deal with.  The government can always raise taxes or borrow more money to pay for their above average wages and benefits.<br>  <br>  Although with the current recession, taxpayers might revolt against higher taxes.  And this might lead either to cuts in wages and benefits for government unionized employees.  Or widespread layoffs.|`|EdBCksSwaa	When you can get something made half way around the world and ship it back here for cheaper than making it here I would say that's a major factor-----------out sourcing,companies have to now to stay a float|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Labor Unions have declined because their premise, based on working conditions of workers, has improved.

ADpL3vBZaa	hhmmmmmm... I am not really sure what you are trying to say, I do not think everyone is equal because they believe in the American Dream. However, I do think that everyone strives for the same objective, and that is to have the American Dream (which means, having a nice house, good paying job, a family..etc.)<br>  I believe that WE ARE NOT many different cultures/languages.<br>  However, I do believe that the American society is based on diversity. <br>  <br>  Americans are very diverse due to our culture, religion, language, and traditions but we are still united by one objective, and that is to have our American Dream. <br>  <br>  :) how about that??|`|4t2kd03Waa	To begin with America has the American culture. We Americans have been generous in extending a welcome mat to people from many countries with different cultures.  This does not make us a multicultral country.<br>  <br>  We have our own culture, American. It is the responsibility of others to adhere to our culture while at the same time enjoy the culture of the country they came from in their own social situations. <br>  <br>  These people came to America because they want to live here and it is wrong of them to want to change us to their culture. Americans need to hold on to our culture and not let it become bastardized. The worst senario is for our culture to degenerate to a third world type culture.
a9i8Q98Aaa	I love how guys can be so cute when they aren't paying attention.  Like the way I'll come home and my brother will be curled up on the couch with my poodle or how the guy who flirts with me at work tries to talk about anything just so he can stay a little longer.  And guys can be so ridiculously sweet.  My friend sits around and talks about how pretty and smart his girlfriend is, not to the point that it's irritating, but just enough to really warm your heart.  I love guys.|`|zXPGm2fraa	I love the way my Dad speaks directly to me or anyone else. I am impressed with my son's memory and physical strength and endurance, and also my brothers'. I love their jokes, and their need for a pat on the back. I love how my friend who works with me goes to battle for everyone in his family. And I really admire my boyfriend's talent for all things mechanical.|`|n0nqLAshaa	I am what they call a trophy husband! Some of those poor guys seem like house cleaners. Guess that's what happens when you get a fem as a wife. I do my fair share of cleaning but oh I do complain about it.|`|1wIek546aa	When i cook, i dirty nearly every dish we have. my man cleans every single one, wiped down the counters, cleans out the sink, and never says a word of complaint.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Some of the people I love most are men. <br>  <br>  My Daddy, my best friend since grade school, some of my closest friends, of course my boyfriend, even my ex. <br>  <br>  Some of my favorite teachers were men, favorite celebrities, people I look up to. <br>  <br>  I'll never understand anyone who can hate an entire gender, sounds like BS to me, eh.|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	My husband cleans up after me, does all the housework and laundry (even offered to put a load in at 5 a.m. Wednesday before we leave on vaca, after working all night), and doesn't even want me to cook!<br>  <br>  I think I'm the luckiest woman on earth.

MN5lflnGaa	I don't know if this is the answer you're looking for, but I'm 15 and am trying to figure out just what qualifies as "True Love". I realize that most teen relationships are fake teen love, but just how do you know? And more than that how do you know if it's just sexual. I've read a lot of Christine Feehan's novels and they're basically attraction but its qualified as love.  <br>  I just got out of a relationship that only lasted a week because when he did something simple like put his arm around me I felt tense. But now I question if it was the right thing to do. And that was 6 months ago.|`|OoHN2qjDaa	...don't you mean stockholm syndrome?|`|8KVvfxdxaa	surely Helsinki syndrome.  The more modern tales of true love are more along the lines of 100 Dalmatians, and Happy Feet.
wgZVeLZPaa	Used to be that way, but getting older it's not so much about that anymore. When people grow up, many times the games like this stop. And it's nice to actually become friends with women, instead of feeling like there is any type of competition going on.|`|jWBikTSjaa	I want to say no, but it probably is true in many cases.  Not necessarily a particular man at that particular moment though.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	Usually true.  OK, I am sure I will get lots of thumbs down for this one, but here goes.<br>  <br>  I am not model material or anything, but I do consider myself above-average in looks, and other people also tell me I am.  All the women I work with pretty much hate me for absolutely no reason.  I am and always have been nice to them.  I do NOT walk around with my nose in the air, thinking my appearance makes me better than other people.  This happens with women I meet outside of work too, though not *quite* as bad.<br>  <br>  Male friends and coworkers have actually told me that other women don't like me because they are jealous.  But, when attractive women have worked at my company in the past they were always friendly to me.  I treated them the same as I treat everyone else, but they liked me whereas the less attractive women did not.<br>  <br>  Most of the women who don't like me at work are married or in a relationship, so I guess they don't think of me as competition for an actual mate, but maybe for male attention in general?|`|rD5HyZyeaa	I think this cuts both ways. When a woman sees a gorgeous woman, she would like to look like her - and when a man sees another man who is super attractive, he wishes he could look like him. Women try to play it off more, whereas men will try to one-up the other guy, usually in conversation.|`|4YqBHfkkaa	True, obviously.<br>  <br>  Did you really even need to ask this?|`|KkRb3paPaa	yeah it's true.. well with me though haha|`|AA12095067	False - I prefer attractive women as companions because they're usually more secure about themselves and thus more fun and relaxed to be around.<br>  <br>  I haven't noticed pretty women getting a lot of jealousy - I think it's more women with a lot of sexual appeal or that instinctively know how to manipulate men that tend to get all the hate (and to an extent probably deserve it). These women are usually not particularly beautiful, and that infuriates other women even more - "She's got all those men after her, and she's not even good-looking!!!!".<br>  <br>  Pretty women who aren't sexy and are clueless with men are usually made pets of by other women, who are always saying, "Why can't she get a boyfriend - she's so pretty and sweet!!!!"|`|Bi2UszTpaa	Thats not only true in women. Men also feel jealousy when there is a more attractive guy in the building. <br>  Not being a self-absorbing guy, but I am very physically attractive, so this doesn't happen to me as often.   But I do not consider looks alone to be enough to attract women.  Basically anybody with a good and fun personality is enough to attract the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	True.<br>  <br>  I lost a job because of it. My boss actually told me his wife felt threatened by me, but I shouldn't pay attention to it, but he was tired of it causing problems in his marriage because of my very presence. I was very depressed for a long time because I really loved my job & I needed my job too! And I was a good employee. What's even stupider is that his wife is pretty too & I'm already happily taken too & not a threat to anyone! Except I guess myself. I have a hard time making friends w/ women because of this assinine jealousy in many. We should be like a sisterhood & support each other instead & have fun together instead of baring claws.|`|zXPGm2fraa	It's a weird thing, every guy I've gone out with has said that when they are WITH me girls flirt with them and try to get their attention, but when they are ALONE those same girls ignore them. At first I thought they were just being defensive and making it up, but the last time was so obvious I couldn't deny it was true. Not women that seem to be down-to-earth and kind though, they act the same all the time.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	TRUE. I have the most difficult time with women, and Im not the catty kind. Ive been told that Im a genuine sweet person. I have the most difficult time even making friends w women bcuz I can sense their jealousy. Insecure women should really be put in some kind of institute. They make life complicated for everyone !!!!!!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Y? <br>  <br>  Edit: And I was asking what the Y stands for. I am just going to assume it means "You don't know"<br>  <br>  True! Women want to feel beautiful, and when another beautiful woman comes into the picture, it makes them feel less attractive in comparison.|`|hhRuKIzRaa	False!  I don't see men with pretty women very often.....so it appears that pretty women aren't competition after all...|`|WJUxHXsAaa	true and false because woman are jealous but most like to think that a man will like them for who they are. =]|`|1wIek546aa	When i see a woman with a body i want, it's not jealousy that i feel.<br>  <br>  it's self loathing.<br>  <br>  why can't i have that kind of self control? why can't i have that kind of diligence? why am i not at the gym 7 days a week?<br>  <br>  that kind of thing.|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	False. Most women just don't like other women because there catty. If a women really wants a man she will do anything in her will to have him.  myself will admit when another women is good looking. (& i'm not gay)|`|x2DweOpqaa	often true. the element of competition is usually an underlying matter when it comes to jealousy. however, not all female jealousy is based off of that.|`|8U4NMYOvaa	True...most women are naturally self conscious|`|Aj0bXSz1aa	True as hell.<br>  <br>  That's how it goes down all the time.<br>  <br>  Girls are devious people man...|`|TCNDX14Daa	Most are but im not, cuz I know if the guy truly loves me there is no competition!|`|JfoWgwhoaa	Unfortunately, True. I hate it, but I don't think that's going to change.|`|B24KqmgGaa	Yes|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	Well...it's human nature, isn't it?
8FbOtXAXaa	I think that a persons upbringing and environment play a role in who you become, just like you said you are a controversial person but you don't think that you chose to be controversial. Your parents might be controversial and you picked up on it growing up. A lot of what makes us who we are is our parents I believe. For example, I grew up with religious parents and I mostly take after my dad and always looked up to him and to this day anything that he would find disgusting like a persons attitude, I react the same way. I also think that we are our own person and not everything that our parents like, we like. We may choose our friends for certain reasons, we wear the clothes we want because it is our own style, we choose all sorts of things so that is why I say it is part upbringing part environment. Good question!|`|20LnuCejaa	A big part of your personality is genetically shaped.  In other words, you were born with it.  Now...a personality can be bent (somewhat altered) by a person's environment, meaning social structure and upbringing.|`|bdeb4da71e553971e11438bdeb0fcdaeaa	I believe that situations around you have effected you to become the person you are today. But also, maybe we are predestined. However, certain situations in life can teach you lessons. I mean, I am afraid of crossing the street to this day because I almost got hit by a car when I was younger. And also, I was always a curious person. I remember in kindergarten, my mother told my sister and I to memorize the number "84". My sister shut up and memorized it, but I kept annoying my mother with questions like, "Why 84?" "What does that mean?" "What if I forget and say another number?" Maybe that's also why I am such a doubtful person? <br>  <br>  However, I do not know where my love for art comes from. Maybe I was exposed to it a lot when I was young, or the amount I was exposed to was stuff I really liked.|`|CaE3JOMbaa	I believe everyone is born with a personality, but the people they meet and interact with can have a strong influence. Apparently there was a woman who needed a heart transplant, and they gave her the heart of a previous murderer, and she was a lot angrier person afterwards. I'm not sure if I believe that story, though.|`|ET6SbXGcaa	some believe that you are born with a tabula rosa (blank slate) and that you act and think as you were taught (such as how your parents behaved). it really is a matter of opinion on whether or not it was fated toward you. i believe you learn how some people act, what others like, and you pick and choose what fits you best.|`|0mxeTAKFaa	I think we were born with it. I mean we all see things differently then the other person. We were born with differences, which those differences make us choose to go different ways.  Were all unique in the way we act on things and see things which make us very different from the next person. good question..
AcgDcQG0aa	Karl Marx once said that he wasn't a Marxist in response to some people who were trying to create an ideology out of his understanding.   I think he was simply trying to understand what was going on.  And he wasn't trying to judge others or tell others what to do.  It was the Marxists who used his ideas to tell others what to do.<br>  <br>  And Adam Smith was also an academic who simply tried to understand what was going on.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps Adam Smith and Karl Marx would make different suggestions about how to improve the Canadian economy for the benefit of its people.  But in the end, it's up to the people to decide what's best for them.
6tR0gS5kaa	Differential Association Theory as proposed by Edwin Sutherland emphasizes that human beings act in reference to their environment and that criminal behavior is learned***  He states that that the process of leaning criminal behavior is really not all that different that learning any other behavior.  an important aspect of this theory is the frequency and intensity of interaction, in other words, the amount of time that a person is exposed to a particular behavior is key in determining if that person too will display the behavior.<br>  Essentially: the more time time you spend with deviant characters the more likely you are to become deviant yourself.
bGsXsDhBaa	You said:<br>  <br>  >>>>  "Because to me it seems like the people who hate homosexuals are going to hate them no matter what, and the people who care are going to continue to not give a damn no matter what"   <<<<<<br>  <br>  If Martin Luther King had sat back on his laurels and decided that people were going to hate negros 'no matter what' then, sweetie, we would still be whipping and lynching gorgeous black people like Obama - who is your president - and Beyonce - who is the top selling singer in the world!<br>  <br>  I, for one, am so glad that Obama is not still standing in a bus giving up his seat to me just because I am white.<br>  <br>  This translates to the issue of homosexuality in that I am activist and determined that I shall NOT (metaphorically speaking) give up my seat to a heterosexual simply because he presumes superiority.<br>  <br>  He is my equal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  TO GASPARI:     <br>  <br>  I would go with you on that if the entire human race was equally determined to find a gene that *causes* heterosexuality because the very notion of your post presupposes that we have to find out what *causes* me to be me and it is homophobic and nazi-like.<br>  <br>  You just don't get it do you?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  What cause you to be straight?  What is wrong with you?  Would you like me to do experiments on you to find out what causes you to be straight? That would make you happy and empower you, wouldn't it?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  READ the irony in what I have written. The above is what you are prescribing for me and my friends and a billion or more on the planet. It is unutterably condescending and presumptuous and it is exactly what women here find disgusting about the white middle class heterosexual male patriarchy.<br>  <br>  YOUR attitude to this is no better than Nuns who used to cane little girls hands in convents because they wrote with their left hands.<br>  <br>  The Convent analogy is a very kind and mild analogy. I could bring up worse:  Nazis who *studied* people in the way that you suggest.<br>  <br>  Please - show your intelligence and respect without putting us under your microscope.<br>  <br>  It's insulting at best. Disturbing at worst.|`|R1WapAO6aa	Technically it doesn't matter, but it doesn't make sense if it's a choice. People who think it's a choice think that they can make them straight. Personally, i'm not gay or anything, it makes sense to me that it's not a choice. When i see a beautiful woman i get turned on, and i don't get turned on by seeing a guy. Gay people have the opposite, some of them are forced to have heterosexual relationships because of society when in fact they're "closet homosexuals." For bisexuals, they just get turned on by both, that's just the most logical explanation for me.|`|gf0sAfoTaa	I think that if it is a genetic disorder that the person is afflicted with then we cannot say that they are gay, it is merely the gender that they identify as. This is the norm to them. We all start of female in the uterus and then half of us go on to develop into male. Many genetic aberrations do not allow the metamorphosis to take place. Over 100 AR mutations causing various forms of AIS have been reported. see AIS<br>  ~~~~~Please click on the link provided below!!!!!!~~~~~<br>  <br>  It is only choice if a perfectly "normal" (whatever that is) person chooses to be with a person of the same gender.<br>  <br>  However as a heterosexual male, It eludes me as to how someone Else's gender choice/ preference effects me. I have had male and female friends that describe themselves as gay and we simply accept that as given.  Any sexuality we keep for the privacy of our own homes as "normal pair bonded couples do" and again I ask;<br>  How does another persons preference affect me or my sex life,<br>  Especialy since I am monogamous and married? <br>  So I believe a persons sex preference is between them and thier partner.  Hence, it's effects on me are nil.|`|4UaHYaDcaa	Actually I think it might.  The people I've met who had a problem with homosexuals believe that they're making the wrong choice.  They believe that no human could be born that way because the Lord would not make them that way. <br>  <br>  The problem is their religious beliefs.  They think that there is no possible way that someone could be born gay because their God is against it.  The whole basis of hate against the gays is based on the thought that they're openly rebelling against God and choosing a life of sin.<br>  <br>  Every time someone tries to tell me that being gay is a choice I just say fine.  Then I tell then to, just for a minute, be gay.  The answer is always the same.  "I can't," then usually with "but only because I don't want to!"|`|iTUugOTLaa	Ofcourse it matters! It may not matter in the context you have placed it: the social view. Yes, perhaps the people who go against homosexuality blatantly are too stupid to understand any of these issues, this has much more to do with education, values and the media. The real issues behind homophobia are deeper and have to do with insecurities as most men are not entirely heterosexual nor entirely homosexual. Many a man has had homosexual sexual fantasies yet this doesn't have anything to do with their identity as a man/woman nor does it have to do with their life roles.<br>  <br>  As for the genetic issue, it has more to do with wether or not men have a choice over what they want. If a gay man could choose to get erections and sexual arousal from a naked woman, maybe he would, simply because of how society and popular religion is against homosexuality. But they don't, they apparently "choose" to be gay and go against all of that. Why would I do that? Assuming I was gay, is it possible not to "realize" it yet? Or is it something I decide on my own?<br>  <br>  These are important existential questions for many people, both male and female in the world, and if more evidence is shed on this we may learn a lot about ourselves and our peers.<br>  <br>  On a side note, in the hating world, assuming some very inhumane people come up to be our future government, or assuming human "breeding" keeps going as it does (you can get sperm over Ebay now) we may be able to "select" heterosexual or homosexual humans through genetic engineering if the genetic theory is proven. On the other hand, the social stress would make more sense if it was choice.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	To me it doesn't matter. The whole "innate" or "choice" debate just obfuscates the real issue. And that's that people have the right to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they are not hurting anyone else. If two men, or two women, love one another and want to marry, and have a family, who the hell are any of us to tell them they cannot? Choice or "born that way," they have the same right to pursue happiness, love, and a family life as anyone else, and to CHOOSE who they marry, and live that life with.|`|PILm2U4Taa	For some, oddly, it certainly appears to...<br>  <br>  As far as I understand it, it's been proved that homosexuality has a genetic component. For *some* anyway, it's definitely a genetic predisposition. This does not mean, however, that everyone engaging in homosexual behavior is genetically predetermined to do so. There are all kind of reasons, conscious and subconscious, that come into play. In the end, WHO CARES?!? People in our "free society" are supposed to be FREE to live however they find personally fulfilling, regardless...<br>  <br>  It would be more admirable, in my eyes, for a gay person to say "I'm gay, I have no idea why, but it works for me. Please mind your own business."<br>  <br>  People should feel the need to explain, or make excuses, for being themselves...|`|n0nqLAshaa	Well I have no idea why they want to say its one or the other. The end of the day they are still gay. I assume if its genetic then they had no control over it. If its choice well that's the life they chose to live. Its all about blame on some level.|`|82tgfHzqaa	Well it's not a choice, so the first step towards building understanding is to help people understand that it's not a choice.<br>  <br>  Some people think of gays as social deviants who are just being gay to spite straight people, or some crazy logic like that. These people also don't associate humans with the rest of the natural world. They're the kind of people who get offended if you refer to humans as animals. So when you point to homosexual behavior in nature, you can clearly demonstrate that it is genetic. Other animals don't choose lifestyles.|`|FUIBscKGaa	I agree with you, and  I wouldn't care if it were a choice or not.  It just doesn't bother me.  But I still know in my heart of hearts that it's not a "choice".  I think it's ridiculous that we have to go through proving that, but it's being examined more than ever now, and I'm confident that we will.  We'll have some definitive proof here soon, and the haters will have to find another explanation for their irrational behavior and beliefs.  Or maybe they'll go on a big "cure" kick.  Either way, they'll keep stressing on other peoples sex lives, even as children are starving to death the world over.|`|mCAWxobNaa	It certainly matters inasmuch as if we could find a genetic locus which predisposes people to homosexuality then no one can argue that homosexuals are somehow defying nature- it would be a revolutionary breakthrough for gays, understanding human behaviour at the bio-molecular level and it would open up huge research avenues.  This would be the greatest achievement of molecular biology since the human genome was unraveled.  This would have far reaching implications for everyone, irrespective of their sexual orientation.|`|3862H0WVaa	Yes it does really.<br>  I don't see why anyone if they fancied the opposite sex would choose to adopt a gay life style. I would worry about their sanity.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Some people are opposed to homosexuality because their morals tell them that homosexuality is akin to bestiality, incest or pedophilia-- that it is wrong and deviant. Other people don't think that homosexuality harms anyone or anything so they are not hostile to homosexuals. But you're right, regardless if homosexuality were a choice or genetic, people would still have the same opinions. Would it matter if pedophilia was genetic or a choice? Most people would still think that pedophilia is wrong. I don't equate homosexuality to pedophilia though, because I don't feel that homosexuality hurts or exploits anyone. However, others do and they will always think homosexuality is wrong.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	I don't know how anyone with even a tiny bit of common sense could honestly believe homosexuality is a choice.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  I think many people who even suggest that, do so because they would feel more justified in discriminating against homosexuals if being gay were a choice people deliberately make rather than something they cant help.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Well When people go around saying it's a choice then they are saying it's "curable" or that give people a reason to hate me in my mind. Also I didn't chose it so I do get a little on edge when people say it.<br>  <br>  But all in all you should just shut up and let people live their lives if you don't agree.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't matter/<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I don't think it matters, no . . . but to some people, it makes all the difference.  For example, if someone believes that homosexuality is against God, learning that it is genetic, and therefore created by God, causes them to rethink their beliefs and maybe become more tolerant.
8yE2sYGeaa	Dreams are funny things, as there is no way to guarantee that so-and-so will dream of you|`|8d8ejHPfaa	That you want to "make" someone dream about you suggests that you want to interfere in their dreams without their permission, and for your own purpose.  Even if I did know how to "make" someone dream about you, I wouldn't tell you because it's wrong to manipulate someone and interfere with their free will like that.|`|906a6ae6f41dff1d6d4759c7c004ce4aaa	Hi there, Beautiful,<br>  <br>  Well, the only way to get someone to dream about you is to present yourself to them....<br>  <br>  You see, dreams are come to us by experience.  What impresses upon the mind the most is the matter to which the dream will become manifest...<br>  <br>  It depends on what is most prevalent to the dreamer.<br>  <br>  You can present the image of yourself so that it is impressed upon the "dreamer's" thoughts.  <br>  <br>  Let's say, you passed this person like wind on the sleeve.  <br>  <br>  Because dreams rely on experience, even that person who passed like wind on the sleeve, is likely to be present in the dream because it is experience.  It is a part of the story of the where, when, and how, that experience is derived.<br>  <br>  Even the passerby may dream of passing the dreamer and visa-versa.<br>  <br>  Just remember, the dream is seeking the "story" from the dreamer about the issues which effect his thoughts and judgements in a day.    If the most prevalent thing is not the "passerby", then it most likely will not play a role in his story.. .or history of the day he experienced...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your sister,<br>  Ginger,<br>  ((Dream Interpreter for over 20 years))|`|OCK7sRGlaa	I would ask them some kind of deep question that would take some thought to answer and tell them you only want to hear the answer after they've thought about it. There might be a chance that they'll dream about the question and maybe even you.|`|fETbCVXbaa	you can't. Dreams are controlled by your own self and what you think about.

OI4iDdSKaa	I think that it varies from person to person.<br>  <br>  My mother suffered from sexual abuse as a child, and as an adult, she takes no pride in anything she does and idolizes her emotionally abusive boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Someone else I know, is very soft spoken, and not very open about their feelings.<br>  <br>  Another person is completely fine. They have been able to move on from it.<br>  <br>  It depends greatly on the person.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't listen to what studies have shown, because those things are never 100% correct. It depends on the person.|`|EM044mlVaa	My cousin was abused by her mother, she still denise it but many have seen it happen, she was only 5. and again when she was 14, but she thought it was normal, and when my mother yelled  out that her sister was abusing her child, everyone knew it already. when she did that it was because of a fight they had, and she they where in separate rooms and for my aunt to hear it , my mother would have to yell it. And now, my cousin drinks daily, goes out to PH (a bar) with her friends, some say that she takes drugs and not too long ago, we did the tests and it was positive. she also aborted twice, thinking she might do the same to her child as her mother to her, but nobody reported it to the police and its too l8 anyway, shes 19, i try to get her mind off of things, and she doesn't take drugs anymore, and she takes me to the PH. we have fun. the abuse incident was never talked about again.<br>  <br>  i guess it depends on weather, you father to son, or daughter, mother to son, uncle to nephew, or something similar, because everyone have different ways to EXPRESS themselves, by drinking, or hanging out, by looking for a way out of the memories (drugs), or by simply not talking about it and pretend life has bin good. :s <br>  <br>  hope this helped. :) <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|A8t8bcJKaa	It affects people in many different ways. Some people change their sexual orientation-become gay, lesbian, BI, etc., become child molesters/pedophiles themselves, become promiscuous, or just abstain from sex. It varies from person to person.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	There is no one pattern for survivors of sexual abuse.  Do some internet searches and I think you will get some of the information you are seeking.  Here's one link to get you started:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apa.org/releases/sexabuse/effects.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/releases/sexabuse/eff...</a>|`|qrjqYAHtaa	Usually, yes. studies show sexually abused children are more likely to get into drugs, trouble with the law, and/or abuse their own children.
uZQ9GDSlaa	I've had these all my life, and one day I figured them out. I figured them out when I became a christian, and realized that evil spirits influence people to do things. Even myself. That's what the scary poltergeists are in my dreams.<br>  <br>  The basement is your subconscious. They got in, and convinced you that YOU were coming up with the thoughts, when really it was them. Either that, or the basement could be the nether regions of your body, maybe the bowels. Having problems down below?|`|3WJi9zLsaa	It can mean one of two things.<br>  <br>  a. If its just a dream.. ghosts calling from your basement would mean something from your past, something you have already dealt with in your life is trying to come back and re enter your life...<br>  <br>  b. The spirits are entering your dreams to let you know they are down there.. go Down there and burn some sage in every corner (look up smudging) and ask them to leave or if you got some serious balls what they want.. Assuming ur not religious use this technique:<br>  <br>  Imagine the room filled with brilliant dazzling white light leaving no room for them... the more energy you put into the image the greater it effect on pushing them out...<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  omg i just read the first reply you had... she is dead right!!! very good answer.. you can only really get rid of them by the power of God! you can Just say I command you, leave this room this house and state now in the Name of Jesus Christ and return no more! use it you'll be surprised how well it works!|`|3NwanU68aa	You are afraid of your basement. It is probably a dark and scary basement. Other then that it means nothing.
llJH1uXvaa	At least you know that you are negative so just do and think opposite.|`|1wOY3zD4aa	I keep a file of good performance reviews, graded papers, and notes, so that if I do badly on one thing, I can look at those and remember that one bad performance is not the end of the world.<br>  <br>  I keep pictures of my friends and family around me that make me smile when I see them.<br>  <br>  When I start to get frustrated with things (annoying coworkers, too much homework, messy house), I go running, take a walk, or plug in some headphones to calm me down.<br>  <br>  When I get overwhelmed by deadlines and want to just give up, I sit down and plan out a schedule. Somehow, schedules make it seem like you have more time. Even if I don't follow the schedule, just writing it down makes me more positive that I'll finish.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is figure out what is making you negative and find a way to counteract it. Most of the time, you can do it yourself and you don't need a counselor to help you (although there's nothing wrong with seeing one if you feel like you need one).|`|Ro5JXg2xaa	There is never a quick fix for anything, but an easier way to think more positively is to try and get into a better mindset from the moment you wake up. Let the little things that normally bother you just slip away, even if you don't want them to sometimes. And maybe vent a little just so things don't build up. No one is 100% positive all the time, and all it takes to get a little bit closer is to notice things, just as you are doing. Just being aware of what you say and think, and wanting to change it is the greatest start.|`|TH1WSO7Uaa	no quick fix.  its called behavioral therapy.  you can do it with the assistance of a doctor or counsler.  Or theres audio programs that claim to be able to do it.  good luck|`|6YlHOiGHaa	affirmations.looking at positive pictures,comedies,

Other products, that are purchased based on reliability and stability might be hurt by his/her pressence. <br>  <br>  Also you run the risk of un-intended comedic occurance. Would you buy a vacuum that Rupauls says "Sucks great!".... Funny, but I'm looking for reliable...|`|8Q6EGSepaa	I knew a friend who used to say, "If they don't want gays in the military then why do they make the guys in the posters so handsome?"<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it probably would hurt a national corporation.  But keep in mind, that while it might not happen in mainstream media, in GLBT media these companies do make targeted add campaigns.<br>  <br>  To the guy who said he would consider the company "anti-Christian"--I hope he's still boycotting Disney.  They were the first company in the nation to give domestic partner benefits to same sex couples.
BeGiNoTSaa	Most of these people doesnt know what is going on in life or there is some people who does know but there do not care want they care is all about themselve most of these people are having problems in there lives like financial probelems, drugs, family problems, and etc. I agree with you that all of us should take everything seriously because right know there is a global financial crisis. I bet if alot of people care take everthing serious we humans could overcome and lessen the problems in this world. What we people could do we should find away to help the other people who doesnt care is to help them open there eyes and realize what is going on in this world like advertising on tv, discussing this in school, teach this to kids so they could be aware also.I hope this helps. God bless.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	Yes there are a lot of serious issues going on right now and a lot of different ways to handle it as well.  We could all put on dark clothing as though going to a funeral, and act as though we are third graders in a private strict Catholic church.  No giggling allowed.  Or we could try to go on with our lives the best that we can.  It is one thing to take things in life seriously, and an entire different one to take all  of life too seriously.  If you feel very strongly the urge to help those in need then I think it would be a great idea for you.  There are plenty of agencies in which you could do so, and in turn find people who have the same passion as you do about the current situation.  Good luck to you.|`|AA11324847	I know what you mean. usually an attitude like that signifies immaturity and irresponsibility.|`|qrjqYAHtaa	That's probably why. As humans, we don't want to face reality.

AcgDcQG0aa	Perhaps the most important cause are laws that protect the ownership of private property.<br>  <br>  Because when people can accumulate property without the fear that someone will arbitrarily take it away from them.  Then some people will naturally accumulate more property than others.  Either because they are more healthy and more willing and able to work.  Or because they have some skills that many other people don't have. <br>  <br>  There are many reasons why people have conflicts with each other.  And inequality of wealth is only one of such reasons.   Perhaps the rules and the laws are not perfect.  And some people are able to take advantage of others.  Which leads to conflict.|`|d05ed685aa8a2e1e6330fa189845ac1faa	Simple luxuries are the the same for everyone, as is poverty & wealth. <br>  <br>  We are all the same yet different individuals. We have same basic needs such as air, food, water, clothing, shelter, security, pursuit of happiness, Liberty, attention & Love. Even those basic needs can vary according to the individuals. <br>  <br>  The imballance I believe is rooted in many causes. <br>  Lack of honesty is one that comes to mind. If one is dishonest with ones needs, one might desire more only because his neighbor seems to have more. If one believes that there is a limited suppy then out of desparation one might hoard the surplus. If one is just plain greedy it is because of the need to be number one at the expense of others. <br>  <br>  The "ruling powers" are not honest with the Earth citizens. For instance, remember when the various nations sent ships to claim the North Pole. Is that not the propertyu of us all here on Earth? <br>  <br>  Besides, what sense does it make to clain either freezing water or melting ice?  <br>  <br>  The imbalance within the self causes ones ego to be vain-glorious. The lure of being number one or only one is beguiling. Such imbalance causes the lack of compassion.<br>  <br>  It is nice to be important, but it is more important to be nice. <br>  <br>  Beware of those whom would have you to believe that there is not enough, because they are the ones eatuing butter while rationing margarine to you, whether you prefer it or not. <br>  <br>  If some people intend to live forever where will they obtain the spare parts??|`|4b6944c4b303ab9627900f771b29a1afaa	Capitalism is unbalanced.<br>  Communism is balanced (only in theory).<br>  <br>  Unbalanced is way more fun.

8cuPVvYnaa	You need to find the balance of letting them talk things out with you and not allowing them to just stay in themselves. Encourage them to get out with you and live life. When you are going through a tough time, talk with them about your problems too. A person with depression can shut down so much that everything bottles up inside them (why you should help them feel safe to talk with you) OR they can become so preoccupied with themselves that its not healthy.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Stay friends with them, then tell them they have to start going to counseling to get the help they need.  If your friend refuses, then it becomes your responsibility to go talk with a responsible trusted adult to get your friend the necessary help.  The best situation would be to urge your friend to talk with his or her parents, and for your friend to ask for the help he or she needs.  Do NOT try to do counseling yourself with your friend.... but by all means, be a supportive friend.  The sooner you start this process, the faster your friend can start getting some help.  Best wishes to you and your friend.|`|OI4iDdSKaa	Honestly? If they aren't willing to try to feel better, you rarely can. Depression isn't something that your peers can pull one out of.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Yes, you have anger problems.  However, you are neither the devil (are you serious that your family thinks that???) nor are you stupid.  However, you are "stuffing" all your feelings prior to your explosion.  This creates emotional tension inside you over a period of time, so that when eventually something will cause everything to explode, you lose it.  It's kind of like stuffing garbage inside a plastic bag and doing this over and over for a period of weeks, until finally the bag breaks and mountains of nasty smelling garbage comes spilling out.  Suggestion:  Start working on your communication skills to deal with your stress and your emotions right after they come up, rather than holding them in until they come out sideways and you get violent.|`|d88r9fKMaa	It's all in your head and it's unhealthy to even think of so lose the attitude.

Sure, you should be able to talk to other people as well, but it's fine that you like it the way it is.

8d8ejHPfaa	An attic in a house is basically a storage space, a place where you put memories like your Christmas decorations or the clothes you wore last summer to get them out of your way for awhile, yet still have access to them when you need them.  In your dreams an attic is also often a kind of storage space, where you put things like memories and other aspects of your personality, and  thoughts that you have suppressed until you're ready to look at them.  To go through a door into another room in the attic suggests you have opened up one of the boxes you have stored there, you're looking at the contents, and may be exploring ideas there. A bedroom suggests aspects of yourself that you keep private from the rest of the world, in a house there are "public" and "private" rooms, the living room and kitchen are rooms where you go to interact with others, the bedroom is where you go to be alone with your thoughts, and find rest.  When you open the door from the attic to a bedroom, you're exploring a private area of your memories or thoughts.  A sibling you don't have in real life suggests an aspect of yourself.|`|xDOp37T7aa	Dreams "mean" absolutely nothing. There are drugs to suppress, induce and amplify them. They mean nothing more than a hallucination.|`|n90rLOUsaa	dreams in which you find new rooms in a place you are familiar with can sometimes mean the need to explore, or get out of everyday life. you should try something new, or go somewhere new.

So, my final answer is D.<br>  <br>  Social costs would be like paying for smoker's cancer treatment. If you make cigarettes and had to add on the social costs, you would need to charge more for your products (selling price). Internal costs are only the production costs. I would say that an increased selling price would reduce demand (except perhaps in addiction cases) thus lowering the need for product and reducing output.|`|9CoaKELzaa	I'm pretty confident the answer is 'D)' or 'E)'.  It's a bit of a tricky question but if you think about it logically, a firm that pays the social cost (that is, the firm takes care of an apparent burden/cost put on everyone regardless of their relation to the firm).  Since they pay the monetary cost of manufacturing AND the social cost (whatever that cost may be) you would figure the company would set a higher selling price to make up for the social cost they had to pay.|`|2tAelzDMaa	Im not so sure about the social cost so i dont know if my ans is the best one. i think D is correct.

sNoRTobUaa	research shows that emotionally intelligent children are better learners .I.Q. contributes only about 20% to factors that determine life success, which leaves 80% to other forces, says School Psychologist Alicia Braccia, who hosts parenting workshops on emotional intelligence.  Taken together E.Q. and I.Q. produce a well-rounded child who is prepared for life professionally and personally. "Children who are emotionally competent are at an advantage in every area of life, whether family and peer relationships, school, sport or community and organizational pursuits," says Braccia. Research shows that emotionally intelligent children enjoy better physical health, are better liked by their peers, have fewer behavior problems, greater attention spans, and score higher on achievement tests.

Taking sleep aids like NyQuil can cause some people to have odd or unusual more vivid dreams.

However our society has already made acceptable the once taboo relationships of homosexuality to the point of even recognizing same sex marriages in some countries of the world and one state in the United States.  So why should we stop there?  Why should our society not accept other once taboo relationships as well?  Where should we draw the line and why?<br>  <br>  Let me ask would you consider sexuality between siblings less offensive if the siblings were of the same sex?  Would sexual activity between a pair of blood related sisters or a pair of blood related brothers be more acceptable than between a brother and sister?  And if so are you not then discriminating against the latter heterosexual couple?<br>  <br>  The fact is that our society is in the process of redefining the once clearly delineated concepts of marriage and sexuality.  What was once taboo is today becoming mainstream.  And how does society have the right to impose it's ethics and standards on two persons who are hurting nobody simply because other persons might find it offensive?  Do you believe you have the right to tell two persons they cannot love one another simply because they are brother and sister?<br>  <br>  Before you get upset remember it was this same argument which has been made to justify same-sex marriages.  That is what happens when you start to change the rules.  Anything goes.

Technically there is nothing "wrong" with them...your personal point of view is what makes their choice to be that way "wrong".<br>  <br>  I know one person that truly believed family and friends were a "burden". Paraphrasing their words: "they are relationships that have to be 'groomed' and stroked, in that, people need to feel they are 'valuable' to you. Also, with those relationships come expectations, and from those expectations grow obligations, which people will try to hold you to". They said that if those were the conditions of "friendship", then they didn't want any part of it. They did not have the time to spend, trying to make other people feel better about themselves because of their personal insecurities. She wanted to be accepted as she was, with no strings attached, and she felt that having expectations placed on her was an attempt to change who she was and it was not her duty to change other people. <br>  <br>  While I can understand their point of view, it's difficult for me to live that way.|`|BeGiNoTSaa	Some men think of this because of the different probems in there lives like financial problems, school problems, and most especially family problems.

BeSZ4nXraa	yes, you should definitely love yourself for trying to find yourself.  I gotta say though, that if you don't want to business, then don't.  If you can't change majors now, consider a masters or something in something else, or just use your undergrad as a platform to get into different work.  It also helps to try new things to figure out what you like and don't like.  Trying new things also can help you decide which aspects were fun or not, stuff like that.  I don't know where you live, but it seems in some countries and some areas in the US that people are not taught to be introspective, and I think that's a real loss.  Money and shallow things seem to take precedent as determiners of worth, but I won't rant any longer. :)<br>  <br>  To answer your main question, can someone truly know and love oneself?

A literatura científica está repleta de concep??es artísticas de tais criaturas. S?o elas as transi??es evolucionárias entre o animal e o homem? Eram “homens-macacos” os nossos ancestrais? Os cientistas evolucionistas afirmam que eram. é por isso que amiúde lemos express?es tais como o seguinte título de artigo duma revista científica: “Como o Macaco Tornou-se Homem.”1<br>  <br>  2 Na verdade, alguns evolucionistas n?o acham que tais ancestrais teóricos do homem devessem ser corretamente chamados de “macacos”. Mesmo assim, alguns dos colegas deles n?o s?o t?o exigentes.2 Afirma Stephen Jay Gould: “As pessoas .?.?. evoluíram de ancestrais simiescos.”3 E George Gaylord Simpson declarou: “O ancestral comum certamente seria chamado de símio ou de macaco, na linguagem popular, por qualquer um que o visse. Visto que os termos símio e macaco s?o definidos pelo emprego popular, os ancestrais do homem eram símios ou macacos.”4<br>  <br>  3 Por que os fósseis s?o t?o importantes no esfor?o de documentar a existência de ancestrais simiescos da humanidade? Porque o atual mundo vivo nada possui que apóie tal idéia. Conforme foi mostrado no Capítulo 6, existe enorme abismo entre os humanos e quaisquer animais hoje existentes, incluindo os da família dos símios. Assim, uma vez que o mundo vivo n?o fornece qualquer elo entre o homem e o macaco, esperava-se que os fósseis fornecessem.<br>  <br>  4 Do ponto de vista da evolu??o, o óbvio abismo entre o homem e o macaco atualmente é algo estranho. A teoria da evolu??o sustenta que, à medida que os animais progrediram na escala evolucionária, tornaram-se mais aptos a sobreviver. Por que, ent?o, a família “inferior” dos símios ainda existe, mas n?o há nenhuma das supostas formas intermediárias, que, presumivelmente, eram mais evoluídas? Hoje em dia, vemos chimpanzés, gorilas e orangotangos, mas nenhum “homem-macaco”. Parece provável que cada um dos mais recentes e, supostamente, mais avan?ados “elos” entre as criaturas simiescas e o homem moderno se tornasse extinto, mas n?o os símios inferiores?<br>  <br>  Quanta Evidência Fóssil?<br>  <br>  5 Pelos relatos da literatura científica, em mostruários de museus e na televis?o, ter-se-ia a impress?o de que certamente havia abundante evidência de que os humanos evoluíram de criaturas simiescas. Dá-se realmente isto? Por exemplo, que evidência fóssil havia disso nos dias de Darwin? Foi tal evidência que o incentivou a formular sua teoria?<br>  <br>  6 A publica??o The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Boletim dos Cientistas At?micos) nos informa: “As teorias primitivas da evolu??o humana s?o realmente muito esquisitas, se a pessoa parar para examiná-las. David Pilbeam descreveu as teorias primitivas como ‘isentas de fósseis’. Isto é, eis aqui teorias a respeito da evolu??o humana que a gente julgaria exigirem alguma evidência fóssil, mas, com efeito, havia t?o poucos fósseis que eles n?o exerceram influência alguma sobre a teoria, ou n?o havia quaisquer fósseis. Assim, entre os presumíveis parentes mais próximos do homem e os primitivos fósseis humanos, só havia a imagina??o de cientistas do século dezenove.” Esta publica??o científica mostra por quê: “As pessoas queriam crer na evolu??o, na evolu??o humana, e isto influiu nos resultados de seu trabalho.”5<br>  <br>  7 Depois de mais de um século de pesquisas, quanta evidência fóssil existe de “homens-macacos”? Declarou Richard Leakey: “Os que trabalham nesse campo disp?em de t?o pouca evidência em que basear suas conclus?es que é necessário que mudem freqüentemente suas conclus?es.”6 A revista New Scientist (Novo Cientista) comentou: “A julgar pela quantidade de evidência sobre o qual se baseia, o estudo do homem-fóssil dificilmente merece ser mais do que uma subdisciplina da paleontologia ou da antropologia. .?.?. a cole??o é mui tantalizadoramente incompleta, e os próprios espécimes amiúde s?o mui fragmentares e inconclusivos.”7<br>  <br>  8 Similarmente, admite o livro Origins (Origens): “Ao avan?armos mais na vereda da evolu??o em dire??o aos humanos, a caminhada parece distintamente incerta, mais uma vez devido à escassez de evidência fóssil.”8 Acrescenta a revista Science (Ciência): “A evidência científica primária é um acervo lastimavelmente ínfimo de ossos, à base do qual se deve compor a história evolutiva do homem. Um antropólogo comparou a tarefa com a reconstitui??o do enredo de Guerra e Paz a partir de 13 páginas selecionadas ao acaso.”9<br>  <br>  9 Exatamente qu?o esparsos s?o os fósseis de “homens-macacos”? Observe o seguinte. Revista Newsweek: “‘Poderia colocar todos os fósseis no topo de uma única mesa’, disse Elwyn Simons, da universidade Duke.”10 Jornal The New York Times: “Os restos fósseis conhecidos dos ancestrais do homem caberiam numa mesa de bilhar. Isso resulta num mirante deficiente do qual perscrutar o nevoeiro dos últimos poucos milh?es de anos.”11 Revista Science Digest (Sumário de Ciência): “O fato notável é que toda a evidência física que temos a favor da evolu??o humana ainda pode ser colocada, com espa?o de sobra, dentro de um único caix?o! .?.?. Os símios modernos, por exemplo, parecem ter surgido do nada. N?o disp?em de passado, de nenhum fóssil. E a verdadeira origem dos humanos modernos —?de seres eretos, nus, fabricantes de ferramentas, de cérebro grande —?é, se havemos de ser honestos com nós mesmos, um assunto igualmente misterioso.”12<br>  <br>  10 Os humanos de tipo moderno, com capacidade de raciocínio, de planejar, de inventar, de edificar à base de conhecimento prévio, e de utilizar línguas complexas, surgem subitamente nos fósseis. Gould, em seu livro The Mismeasure of Man (A Dimens?o Err?nea do Homem), observa: “N?o dispomos de evidência alguma de altera??o biológica no tamanho ou na estrutura do cérebro desde que surgiu o Homo sapiens nos fósseis, cerca de cinqüenta mil anos atrás.”13 Assim, o livro The Universe Within (O Universo Interno) indaga: “O que moveu a evolu??o .?.?. a produzir, como que da noite para o dia, a moderna humanidade, com seu cérebro altamente especializado?”14 A evolu??o é incapaz de responder. Mas, poderia a resposta estar na cria??o de uma criatura muito complexa e diferente?<br>  <br>  Onde Est?o os “Elos”?<br>  <br>  11 No entanto, n?o encontraram os cientistas os necessários “elos” entre os animais simiescos e o homem? N?o, segundo a evidência. Science Digest menciona “a ausência de um elo que falta para explicar o aparecimento relativamente súbito do homem moderno”.15 Newsweek observou: “O elo que falta entre o homem e os símios .?.?. é simplesmente a mais glamourosa de toda uma hierarquia de criaturas fantasmagóricas. Nos fósseis, os elos que faltam s?o a regra.”16<br>  <br>  12 Visto n?o haver elos, “criaturas fantasmagóricas” têm de ser inventadas à base de mínima evidência e ser divulgadas como se realmente tivessem existido. Isso explica por que poderia ocorrer a seguinte contradi??o, conforme veiculada por uma revista científica: “Os humanos evoluíram em passos graduais de seus ancestrais simiescos e n?o, como alguns cientistas contendem, em saltos súbitos de uma forma para outra. .?.?. Mas outros antropólogos, manipulando quase os mesmos dados, alegadamente chegaram à conclus?o exatamente oposta.”17<br>  <br>  13 Assim, podemos entender melhor a observa??o do respeitado anatomista Solly Zuckerman, que escreveu no Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Revista do Real Colégio de Cirurgi?es de Edimburgo): “A busca do proverbial ‘elo que falta’ na evolu??o do homem, o santo gral de uma seita nunca moribunda de anatomistas e biólogos, dá margem à especula??o e ao florescimento de mitos t?o facilmente hoje, ou até mais, do que há 50 anos.”18 Observou que, com demasiada freqüência, os fatos foram ignorados, e, em vez disso, aclamava-se o que era popularesco na época, apesar da evidência em contrário.<br>  <br>  A “árvore Genealógica” do Homem<br>  <br>  14 Em resultado disso, sofre constantes altera??es a “árvore genealógica” amiúde esquematizada da suposta evolu??o do homem a partir de animais inferiores. Para exemplificar, Richard Leakey declarou que uma descoberta mais recente dum fóssil “p?e por terra a no??o de que todos os fósseis primitivos podem ser dispostos numa seqüência ordeira das mudan?as evolucionárias”.19 E dizia certo informe de jornal a respeito dessa descoberta: “Jogue-se no lixo todo o livro de antropologia, todo o artigo sobre a evolu??o do homem, toda a gravura da árvore genealógica do homem. Est?o, pelo visto, errados.”20<br>  <br>  15 A teórica árvore genealógica da evolu??o humana está repleta de refugos de “elos” previamente aceitos. Um editorial de The New York Times observou que a ciência evolucionista “dá tanta margem a conjecturas que as teorias de como o homem veio a existir tendem a contar mais sobre seu autor do que sobre seu assunto. .?.?. O descobridor de novo cranio amiúde parece redesenhar a árvore genealógica do homem, colocando sua descoberta no tronco central que leva ao homem, e os cranios de todo o mundo mais nas linhas laterais, que n?o conduzem a parte alguma.”21<br>  <br>  16 Numa crítica literária sobre The Myths of Human Evolution (Os Mitos da Evolu??o Humana), escrito pelos evolucionistas Niles Eldredge e Ian Tattersall, a revista Discover (Descobrir) observou que os autores eliminaram qualquer árvore genealógica evolucionista. Por quê? Depois de frisar que “os elos que constituem os ancestrais da espécie humana só podem ser adivinhados”, esta publica??o declarava: “Eldredge e Tattersall insistem que o homem procura em v?o seus ancestrais. .?.?. Se houvesse evidência, contendem, ‘poder-se-ia confiantemente esperar que, à medida que se encontrassem fósseis mais hominídeos, a estória da evolu??o humana se tornasse mais clara. Ao passo que, se algo ocorreu, foi justamente o contrário.’”<br>  <br>  17 Concluiu Discover: “A espécie humana, e todas as espécies, continuar?o sendo uma espécie de órf?os, ficando perdida no passado a identidade de seus genitores.”22 Talvez “perdida” do ponto de vista da teoria evolucionista. Mas, será que a alternativa de Gênesis n?o “encontrou” nossos pais, da forma como realmente eles se acham nos fósseis —?plenamente humanos, como nós somos?<br>  <br>  18 Os fósseis revelam uma origem distinta e separada para os símios e para os humanos. é por isso que inexiste evidência fóssil do elo do homem com animais simiescos. Os elos realmente jamais existiram.<br>  <br>  Qual Era a Aparência Deles?<br>  <br>  19 Entretanto, se os ancestrais do homem n?o eram simiescos, por que tantas gravuras e réplicas de “homens-macacos” inundam as publica??es científicas e os museus por todo o mundo? Em que se baseiam? O livro The Biology of Race (A Biologia das Ra?as) responde: “A carne e os cabelos em tais reconstitui??es têm de ser supridos por se recorrer à imagina??o.” Adiciona: “A cor da pele; a cor, a forma e a distribui??o dos cabelos; a forma das fei??es; o aspecto do rosto —?n?o sabemos absolutamente nada sobre todos estes caracteres de quaisquer homens pré-históricos.”23<br>  <br>  20 Science Digest também comentou: “A ampla maioria das concep??es artísticas baseia-se mais na imagina??o do que na evidência. .?.?. Os artistas precisam criar algo entre o símio e o ser humano; quanto mais antigo se diz que é o espécime, tanto mais simiesco o tornam.”24 O ca?ador de fósseis, Donald Johanson, admitiu: “Ninguém pode estar seguro de qual era exatamente a aparência de qualquer hominídeo extinto.”25<br>  <br>  21 Deveras, New Scientist noticiou que n?o existe “suficiente evidência nos materiais fósseis para retirar nossa teoriza??o dos domínios da fantasia”.26 Assim, as gravuras de “homens-macacos” s?o, como admitiu certo evolucionista, “pura fic??o, na maioria dos sentidos .?.?. simples inven??o”.27 Assim, no livro Man, God and Magic (O Homem, Deus e a Mágica), Ivar Lissner comentou: “Assim como aprendemos aos poucos que os homens primitivos n?o eram necessariamente selvagens, assim também temos de aprender a reconhecer que os homens primitivos da Era Glacial n?o eram nem animais brutos, nem metade macacos, nem cretinos. Daí a indescritível estupidez de todas as tentativas de se reconstituir o homem de Neanderthal, ou mesmo o de Pequim.”28<br>  <br>  22 Em seu desejo de encontrar evidência dos “homens-macacos”, alguns cientistas se deixaram levar pela crassa fraude, por exemplo, do homem de Piltdown, em 1912. Por cerca de 40 anos, foi aceito como genuíno pela maior parte da comunidade evolucionista. Por fim, em 1953, a farsa foi descoberta, quando técnicas modernas revelaram que ossos humanos e ossos simiescos tinham sido ajuntados e artificialmente envelhecidos. Em outro caso, desenhou-se um “elo que faltava” simiesco, que foi divulgado na imprensa. Mas, reconheceu-se posteriormente que a “evidência” consistia em apenas um dente pertencente a uma forma extinta de porco.29<br>  <br>  Que Eram Eles?<br>  <br>  23 Se as reconstitui??es de “homens-macacos” n?o s?o válidas, ent?o o que eram aquelas criaturas antigas cujos ossos fósseis foram encontrados? Um destes primitivos mamíferos, que se pretende constar da linhagem do homem, é um pequeno animal do tipo roedor que se diz ter vivido há cerca de 70 milh?es de anos. Em seu livro Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind (Lucy: Os Primórdios da Humanidade), Donald Johanson e Maitland Edey escreveram: “Eram quadrúpedes insetívoros, quase do tamanho e do formato dos esquilos.”30 Richard Leakey chamou tal mamífero de “primata ratiforme”.31 Mas, existe qualquer evidência sólida de que tais animaizinhos fossem os ancestrais dos humanos? N?o, antes, apenas especula??es desiderativas. Nenhum estágio transicional jamais os vinculou com qualquer coisa, exceto com o que eram: mamíferos pequenos, semelhantes a roedores.<br>  <br>  24 Em seguida na lista, que goza de aceita??o geral, com admitida lacuna de cerca de 40 milh?es de anos, acham-se os fósseis encontrados no Egito, e chamados Aegyptopithecus —?símio egípcio. Diz-se que esta criatura vivia há cerca de 30 milh?es de anos. Revistas, jornais e livros apresentaram gravuras desta criaturinha com legendas tais como: “Criatura simiesca foi nosso ancestral.” (Revista Time)32 “Primata Africano Simiesco é Chamado de Ancestral Comum do Homem e dos Símios.” (The New York Times)33 “Aegyptopithecus é um ancestral que partilhamos com os símios vivos.” (Livro Origins [Origens])34 Mas, onde est?o os elos entre este e o roedor antes dele? Onde est?o os elos que o liguem ao que é colocado depois dele no alinhamento evolutivo? N?o se encontrou nenhum.<br>  <br>  Ascens?o e Queda dos “Homens-Macacos”<br>  <br>  25 Em seguida a outra admitidamente grande lacuna nos fósseis, apresentou-se outra criatura fóssil como o primeiro símio humanóide. Dizia-se que vivera há cerca de 14 milh?es de anos e era chamado de Ramapithecus —?símio de Rama (Rama era um príncipe mítico da índia). Fósseis dele foram encontrados na índia há cerca de meio século. à base destes fósseis, montou-se uma criatura simiesca, ereta, sobre dois membros. A respeito dela, Origins declarou: “Tanto quanto uma pessoa possa afirmar no momento, é o primeiro representante da família humana.”35<br>  <br>  26 Qual era a evidência fóssil para tal conclus?o? Observava a mesma publica??o: “A evidência a respeito do Ramapithecus é considerável — embora, em termos absolutos, continue tantalizadoramente pequena: fragmentos das mandíbulas superior e inferior, além dum grupo de dentes.”36 Julga ser isto “evidência” bastante “considerável” para a reconstitui??o de um ancestral “homem-macaco” ereto dos humanos? Todavia, esta criatura quase que totalmente hipotética foi desenhada por ilustradores como “homem-macaco”, e gravuras dela inundaram as publica??es evolucionistas —?tudo à base de fragmentos de mandíbulas e alguns dentes! Mesmo assim, conforme veiculado pelo The New York Times, durante décadas o Ramapithecus “fixou-se t?o seguramente quanto qualquer outra coisa à base da árvore evolucionária humana”.37<br>  <br>  27 N?o obstante, isso n?o mais acontece. As descobertas mais recentes e mais completas de fósseis revelaram que o Ramapithecus assemelhava-se de perto com a família atual dos símios. Assim, a revista New Scientist declara agora: “O Ramapithecus n?o pode ter sido o primeiro membro da linhagem humana.”38 Estas informa??es novas provocaram a seguinte pergunta incluída na revista Natural History (História Natural): “Como foi que o Ramapithecus, .?.?. reconstituído apenas à base de dentes e mandíbulas —?sem pélvis, ossos dos membros, ou cranio conhecidos —?penetrou furtivamente neste desfile em marcha para se tornar homem?”39 Obviamente, grande dose de pensamento desiderativo deve ter feito parte deste esfor?o de fazer com que a evidência afirme aquilo que ela n?o diz.<br>  <br>  28 Outra lacuna de amplas propor??es paira entre tal criatura e a seguinte, alistada como ancestral “homem-macaco”. Esta é chamada Australopithecus —?símio do sul. Fósseis dele foram encontrados no sul da áfrica na década de 20. Possuía pequena caixa craniana simiesca, pesada mandíbula e foi representado como andando sobre dois membros, encurvado, peludo e de aparência simiesca. Afirmou-se ter come?ado a viver há cerca de três ou quatro milh?es de anos. Com o tempo, veio a ser aceito por quase todos os evolucionistas como ancestral do homem.<br>  <br>  29 Por exemplo, o livro The Social Contract (O Contrato Social), comentou: “Salvo uma ou duas exce??es, todos os pesquisadores competentes neste campo concordam agora que os australopitecos .?.?. s?o reais ancestrais humanos.”40 Declarou The New York Times: “Foi o Australopithecus .?.?. que por fim evoluiu no Homo sapiens, ou homem moderno.”41 E no livro Man, Time, and Fossils (O Homem, o Tempo e os Fósseis), Ruth Moore disse: “Segundo toda a evidência, os homens por fim encontraram seus ancestrais primitivos, há muito desconhecidos.” Enfaticamente, ela declarou: “A evidência era sobrepujante .?.?. o elo que faltava tinha finalmente sido descoberto.”42<br>  <br>  30 Mas, quando é realmente tênue ou inexistente a evidência a favor de algo —?ou ela se baseia em patente logro —?tal pretens?o, mais cedo ou mais tarde, reduz-se a nada. Isto tem acontecido com muitos exemplos passados de supostos “homens-macacos”.<br>  <br>  31 O mesmo, também, se deu com o Australopithecus. Maior pesquisa revelou que seu cranio “diferia do dos humanos em muito mais formas do que sua diminuta capacidade cerebral”.43 Escreveu o anatomista Zuckerman: “Quando comparado com os cranios humanos e simiescos, o cranio do Australopithecus tem aparência sobrepujantemente simiesca —?e n?o humana. A proposi??o contrária poderia ser igualada à asser??o de que o preto é branco.”44 Disse também: “Nossas descobertas deixam pouca dúvida de que .?.?. o Australopithecus se assemelha, n?o ao Homo sapiens, mas a macacos e símios vivos.”45 Donald Johanson também disse: “Os australopitecos .?.?. n?o eram homens.”46 Similarmente, Richard Leakey considerou “improvável que nossos ancestrais diretos sejam descendentes evolucionários dos australopitecos”.47<br>  <br>  32 Caso fossem encontrados hoje quaisquer australopitecos vivos, eles seriam colocados em zoológicos, junto com outros símios. Ninguém os chamaria de “homens-macacos”. O mesmo se dá com outros “primos” fósseis que se assemelham a ele, tais como o tipo menor de australopiteco chamado “Lucy”. A respeito dele, Robert Jastrow afirma: “Este cérebro n?o era grande em tamanho absoluto, tinha o ter?o do tamanho dum cérebro humano.”48 Obviamente, também era simplesmente um “símio”. Com efeito, New Scientist disse que “Lucy” tinha um cranio “bem parecido com o dum chimpanzé”.49<br>  <br>  33 Outro tipo fóssil é chamado de Homo erectus —?homem ereto. O tamanho e o formato de seu cérebro enquadram-se realmente no ambito menor do homem moderno. Também, a Encyclop?dia Britannica comentou que “os ossos dos membros descobertos até agora n?o podem ser distinguidos dos do H[omo] sapiens.”50 N?o obstante, n?o é claro se era ou n?o humano. Caso fosse, ent?o era simples ramo da família humana, e desapareceu.<br>  <br>  A Família Humana<br>  <br>  34 O homem de Neanderthal (assim chamado por causa do distrito de Neander, na Alemanha, onde foi descoberto seu primeiro fóssil) era indubitavelmente humano. De início, foi representado como encurvado, de aspecto atoleimado, peludo e simiesco. Agora se sabe que esta reconstitui??o err?nea se baseava num esqueleto fóssil terrivelmente deformado pela doen?a. Desde ent?o, encontraram-se muitos fósseis neandertalenses, confirmando que n?o diferia muito dos humanos modernos. Em seu livro Ice (Gelo), declarou Fred Hoyle: “N?o existe evidência de que o homem de Neanderthal fosse, em qualquer sentido, inferior a nós mesmos.”51 Como resultado, recentes gravuras dos neandertalenses têm assumido um aspecto mais moderno.<br>  <br>  35 Outro tipo fóssil freqüentemente encontrado na literatura científica é o homem de Cro-Magnon. Foi assim denominado em honra ao local, no sul da Fran?a, onde foram encontrados através de escava??o os ossos dele. Estes espécimes “eram t?o virtualmente indistinguíveis dos da atualidade que até os mais cépticos tiveram de admitir que eram humanos”, dizia o livro Lucy.52<br>  <br>  36 Assim, é clara a evidência de que é infundada a cren?a em “homens-macacos”. Antes, os humanos possuem todos os sinais de terem sido criados —?de forma separada e distinta de qualquer animal. Os humanos só se reproduzem segundo sua espécie. Fazem-no hoje, e sempre o fizeram no passado. Quaisquer criaturas simiescas que viveram no passado eram exatamente isso —?símios, ou macacos —?e n?o humanos. E os fósseis de antigos humanos que diferem ligeiramente dos humanos da atualidade simplesmente demonstram a variedade que existe na família humana, assim como, atualmente, dispomos de muitas variedades que vivem lado a lado. Há humanos de uns 2,10 metros de altura e há pigmeus, com variados tamanhos e formatos de esqueletos. Mas, todos pertencem à mesma “espécie” humana, e n?o a uma “espécie” animal.<br>  <br>  Que Dizer das Datas?<br>  <br>  37 A cronologia bíblica indica que se passou um período de cerca de 6.000 anos desde a cria??o dos humanos. Por que, ent?o, a pessoa com freqüência lê a respeito de períodos muito mais extensos desde que surgiram tipos de fósseis reconhecidos como humanos?<br>  <br>  38 Antes de concluir que a cronologia bíblica deve estar errada, considere que alguns cientistas criticam acerbamente os métodos de data??o radioativa. Certa revista científica fez um relato sobre estudos que mostravam que “as datas determinadas pela decomposi??o radioativa podem estar equivocadas —?n?o apenas em quest?o de anos, mas em ordens de magnitude”. Dizia: “O homem, em vez de estar andando pela Terra já por 3,6 milh?es de anos, talvez esteja por aqui por apenas alguns milhares [de anos].”53<br>  <br>  39 Por exemplo, tomemos o “relógio” radiocarb?nico. Os cientistas desenvolveram este método de data??o pelo radiocarbono, em todo o mundo, por um período de duas décadas. Foi amplamente aclamado pela data??o exata de artefatos da história antiga do homem. Daí, porém, realizou-se em Upsala, na Suécia, uma conferência que reuniu os peritos mundiais, incluindo radioquímicos, arqueólogos e geólogos, a fim de trocar idéias. O relatório de sua conferência mostrava que as suposi??es fundamentais em que se baseavam as medi??es provaram-se indignas de confian?a, em grau maior ou menor. A título de exemplo, verificou-se que a taxa de forma??o do carbono radioativo na atmosfera n?o se mantivera estável no passado, e que este método n?o merece confian?a na data??o de objetos de cerca de 2000 AEC ou antes.54<br>  <br>  40 Tenha presente que a evidência realmente fidedigna da atividade do homem na Terra é suprida, n?o em milh?es de anos, mas em milhares. Por exemplo, no livro The Fate of the Earth (O Destino da Terra), lemos: “Há apenas seis ou sete milhares de anos .?.?. emergiu a civiliza??o, habilitando-nos a construir um mundo humano.”55 A obra The Last Two Million Years (Os últimos Dois Milh?es de Anos) declara: “No Velho Mundo, a maioria dos passos críticos da revolu??o agrícola foram dados entre 10000 e 5000 AC.” Também afirma: “é somente para os últimos 5.000 anos que o homem disp?e de registros escritos.”56 Mostrarem os fósseis que o homem moderno apareceu subitamente na Terra, e que fidedignos registros históricos s?o, admitidamente, recentes, harmoniza-se com a cronologia da Bíblia sobre a vida humana na Terra.<br>  <br>  41 Neste sentido, observe o que o físico nuclear W.?F. Libby, Prêmio Nobel, um dos pioneiros da data??o radiocarb?nica, declarou na revista Science (Ciência): “A pesquisa no desenvolvimento da técnica de data??o consistiu em dois estágios —?a data??o de amostras, respectivamente das épocas histórica e pré-histórica. Eu e Arnold [um colaborador] tivemos o nosso primeiro choque quando nossos consultores nos informaram que a História remontava apenas a uns 5.000 anos. .?.?. Lêem-se declara??es no sentido de que tal e tal sociedade ou sítio arqueológico tem 20.000 anos. Aprendemos um tanto abruptamente que estes números, estas idades antigas, n?o s?o conhecidos com exatid?o.”57<br>  <br>  42 Ao fazer a crítica dum livro sobre evolu??o, o autor inglês Malcolm Muggeridge comentou a falta de evidência a favor da evolu??o. Observou que, assim mesmo, floresciam loucas especula??es. Daí, disse: “O relato de Gênesis parece, por compara??o, bastante sóbrio e, pelo menos, possui o mérito de estar validamente relacionado com o que conhecemos sobre os seres humanos e seu comportamento.” Disse que as afirma??es infundadas de milh?es de anos de evolu??o humana “e os desvairados saltos de cranio em cranio n?o podem deixar de impressionar todo aquele que n?o se vê enredado pelo mito [evolucionista] como pura fantasia”. Concluiu Muggeridge: “A posteridade sem dúvida ficará pasma —?e espero que ache muita gra?a nisso —?de ver como tal teoriza??o desmazelada e nada convincente conseguiu dominar com tanta facilidade as mentes do século 20, e ser t?o ampla e irresponsavelmente aplicada|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	N?o creio nesta Hipótese, e se o macado for descendente do homem e estiver Involuindo ao invés de Evoluir?<br>  <br>  abra?os<br>  @|`|7ec9d48c962acd4c0cfa97864b28aa99aa	sim, como qualquer outro animal o Homem está em constante evolu??o.<br>  <br>  <br>  nao era bem um 'macaco' mas....

Inclusive, o que mais criticam é o que mais sentem inveja.<br>  N?o devemos ligar e nem nos iludir. Muitas vezes fiquei super magoada, triste. Mas agora n?o ligo mais, só n?o conto mais nada da minha vida para essas pessoas. O melhor é ficarmos próximas das verdadeiras amizades.<br>  <br>  Tudo de bom,<br>                            Linda.|`|adYlHpQ1aa	olha se sou nem sei..<br>  nem gasto energia e tempo me preocupando com essas coisas...<br>  coisas ruins deixo pra quem tenta jogar encima de mim desfrutar.<br>  <br>  edu|`|d6891b8806bf2f21a7f3a9745be0926baa	Considerando que toda e qualquer a??o e todo e qualquer pensamento fica registrado na memória vital do espírito e no éter-cósmico, pode-se caracterizar as formas-pensamento como concretiza??es de pensamentos. Por exemplo, se um homem, num ambiente de trabalho, sente inveja de um colega pelo fato de este se mostrar mais competente, mais esfor?ado e, portanto, mais solicitado e admirado, a inveja do primeiro "cria" no éter-cósmico uma forma-pensamento própria do sentimento. Essa forma-pensamento pode possuir forma física, como a de uma faca, de um homem morto, ou pode possuir forma indefinida, caracterizando apenas o sentimento pelo qual ela foi gerada. A forma-pensamento pode se depositar no éter-cósmico ou pode "colar-se" ao indivíduo invejado, no caso do exemplo em quest?o, causando-lhe prejuízos psíquicos e até físicos. Está aí a explica??o científica do famoso "mau-olhado", agouro direcionado a uma pessoa que, efetivamente, na maioria dos casos, logra prejuízos. Porém, as formas-pensamento n?o se resumem apenas a sentimentos baixos. Elas podem se originar de sentimentos nobres, como o amor ou a benevolência. Por exemplo, uma m?e, amando profundamente seus filhos, ao assistir ao progresso dos mesmos, se enche de alegria e envia forma-pensamento benéficas a eles, que podem se caracterizar por imagens alegres como um cora??o, um rosto sorrindo, ou por formas indefinidas mas de cores vivazes e alegres. Também fatos e acontecimentos podem gerar formas-pensamento, como no caso de uma guerra em que muito sangue foi derramado e muitos espíritos sofreram atrozmente e pereceram. Tudo isso pode ocasionar uma grande mancha escura na regi?o onde a guerra se sucedeu, com grande aglomerado de formas-pensamento negativas, gerando, n?o raro, perturba??es de ordem psíquica nos próprios moradores da regi?o, em fun??o da grande quantidade de energias deletérias. Além disso, um determinado homem, através de seus incessantes clamores de inveja, pode, por exemplo, lan?ar formas-pensamento de um lugar para qualquer outro. Por invejar a casa de um amigo, por exemplo, um indivíduo manda, inconscientemente, formas-pensamento negativas para lá, e as mesmas ficam ali depositadas, gerando diversos males, de acordo com a intensidade do pensamento do emissor. Por isso, é sempre bom pedir em nossas ora??es ajuda àqueles que, mesmo sem querer, exercem esse maligno prejuízo aos outros, e pedir também que nossa casa, assim como nós mesmos, possamos ser limpos pelos espíritos amigos de quaisquer formas-pensamento negativas que possam ter-se depositado em nossa casa ou em nós. é importante acrescentar que somente os espíritos já evoluídos é que conseguem dar a forma e comandar com plenos poderes suas forma-pensamento; os demais espíritos as produzem inconscientemente.|`|0q2s9Nx2aa	Já dizia a minha vó, a inveja é pior que a macumba!!!!<br>  <br>  Agredito na inveja sim...ela existe e é real. mas podem acreditar toda  pessoa invejosa s?o pessoas  medilcres e pacatás.Sem condi??es de obter e almejar algo de bom!!1<br>  <br>  Sai pra lá,,,,urucubaca!!! rsrsrs<br>  <br>  bjs :)|`|3041791e8eaa2b61b517244073fd147eaa	Eu sinto que muitas pessoas sentem inveja de minha forma física,e meu aspecto jovem,apesar de já ter quase cinqüenta anos.Isso é genético,e vem da família de minha m?e.Eu n?o me importo,inclusive acredito que a inveja faz mal para quem sente,pois provoca sofrimento.<br>  Quando você sentir que alguém sente inveja de você,sinta-se feliz,pois ninguém invejaria uma pessoa feia,mal sucedida,burra,ou coisas assim ruins!<br>  Você me pareceu muito bonita.Bom pra você!Os invejosos é que se danem!<br>  Beijos,e tenha ma boa noite!|`|4bTNozbiaa	Com certeza gata.|`|4ec25bf3f0c7d48a7504d0832efe077aaa	Sim! conhe?o pessoas que esta tentando acabar com meu ministério<br>  Mas o espírito que leva estas pessoas a fazer ou desejar isso, já esta derrotado em nome de Jesus!|`|8564a538bfe2550c46b1e4aa74b2e460aa	Colirio diete nele!<br>  Mas encare isto como um desafio e autoconhecimento.|`|f31f177d957f2d0bf144551113dc53b0aa	Observar pessoas com inveja  de mim sim!Mas n?o deixo que isso me atrapalhe,nem me fa?o de vítima!Eu tento me fortalecer com ora??es e sal grosso....rsrsrsrs(Brincadeira)As pessoas que sentem inveja dos outros é digna de pena!!S?o pessoas infelizes e fraca!|`|klQthyWAaa	Olho gordo é coisa de quem é superticioso e inveja é coisa de nossa natureza e que faz parte de nosso dia-dia e se alguém botar olho gordo em mim n?o adinta porque olho gordo pra mim é cego...|`|pCkgtv9naa	Olá!<br>  Já sim, é horréével...<br>  Até as coisas que vc nem percebe que faz, o invejoso ve e faz igual...<br>  <br>  ? vontade de exterminar!<br>  ehehe...<br>  T+, abra??o!|`|uFedN3bgaa	Já me senti vítima da inveja, ooo que sensa??o horrível, mas hoje tirei de meus pensamentos essa energia negativa, inveja n?o me pega mais!|`|AA12005596	Sim.

Conheci uma crian?a q me olhava d um jeito muito estranho e muito pouco infantil. Um dia eu peguei ele olhando para partes do meu corpo e fiquei muito constrangida. N?o me parece q a cria??o dos pais influenciou esse comportamento, nem acho q a tv ou os coleguinhas dele possam ter tanto poder de influência. Acredito q existem personalidades já bem avan?adas na infancia e possuem uma tendência sexualizada. N?o estou julgando pelo lado negativo, mas por ser um fato q a gente observa claramente. Por ex. qdo a crian?a pega em nossas roupas íntimas ou qdo ficam muito agarradas, querem entrar no banheiro junto c/os pais, sentem ciúmes d outras pessoas do sexo oposto ou até dos próprios pais qdo est?o juntos, parece q quer competir a aten??o. Isso tb pode ser reflexo de uma grande sensa??o de abandono por parte de alguém q n?o lhe deu amor de verdade e em vez disso só lhe oferece bens materiais. Mas isso n?o é o único motivo e se n?o for tratada com um bom psicólogo ou até mesmo um psiquiatra, a crian?a pode desenvolver uma sexualidade deturpada e isso pode provocar uma competi??o entre m?e/pai/filha, seduzir todos a sua volta, fazer coisas anti-éticas para se sentir no poder e no controle. A sexualidade está diretamente ligada ao poder, por isso o distúrbio sexual e a ganancia exacerbada por dinheiro e poder, est?o associadas na altera??o da personalidade de uma pessoa q cresce com esses desvios.<br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado.

De manera que no es por capricho. Y la Iglesia es la encargada de gobernar al Pueblo de Dios.<br>  En cuanto a que Dios no quiere que contraigamos enfermedades de transmisión sexual, estamos totalmente de acuerdo en que es así. Ahora bien, para que ello no suceda, es bueno pensar en la abstención y en la fidelidad matrimonial...<br>  Y sobre lo último, en lo concerniente a la procreación, si hablamos de paternidad responsable, estamos diciendo, en católico, que el ser padre implica saber en qué momento trae un hijo al mundo. Y ello pasa también por la abstención de las relaciones sexuales en los días fértiles de la mujer. Para ello hay métodos muy efectivos y no anti naturales, como por ejemplo, el método billings o del mucus vaginal... Y una relación así está indicando el mucho amor que se tiene la pareja.<br>  Es mi opinión, salvo mejor parecer...<br>  Fraternalmente,|`|aa9dcd574e2a8332ed98c20f35b737cbaa	La iglesia prohibe muchas cosas,entre otras que los curas se casen,esta prohibición se le conoce como CELIBATO,ALGO QUE EN VERDAD ES CONTRANATURAL,me imagino como sera la ansiedad al despertarme a media noche y no sentir las caricias de una mujer, por lo demás me pregunto, acaso el santo padre carece de ese instinto natural y hermoso llamado sexo,me pregunto acaso se estará actuando con sinceridad,|`|b8bf590ed8037ed81c2e126371938ea4aa	La iglesia no habla en nombre de dios.<br>  Dios si que querría lo mejor para todos, pero la iglesia solo mira por su bien, y como es un tema que no les afecta...    pues les da igual.|`|bc72418926db32e5e1fd901ffaae44e2aa	no le inportaria  es por la protexion  de nosotros     sitienes  parejas  usalo  por tu bien|`|bedfabd5b1ab1a8c1b1af8d6e8051f89aa	buena pregunta, pero pienso q todo depende de las crencias sociales asi como teologicas que cada uno tenga, yo en mi opinion pienso q no le importaria. esperere las respùestas de los demas|`|c7dea420d53eeb4ec7ce14812a0afeafaa	Mira, Dios ni quiere ni deja de querer nada.

No!! Y luego le dijo, ve y ten relaciones sexuales con cuantas mujeres y hombres (el ejemplo es valido hoy en día) se te pongan enfrente!! Y Luego le dijo ve a la oficina que te cree y trabaja con un sueldo de hambre y dale de comer a todos los hijos que te de la gana de tener!! Todo eso es culpa y responsabilidad del mismo humano. Además las enfermedades sexuales no se contagian solamente por el pene, si tienes relaciones sexuales con una pareja enferma te podes contagiar por la saliva, sexo oral y el intercambio de otros fluidos, en pocas palabra no puedes creer que estas seguro(a) solamente por usar un condón. El condón no ha solucionado los problemas que mencionas, siguen habiendo ni?os huérfanos, mas abortos, el SIDA y las enfermedades sexuales siguen en aumento!! por que?!!! Y a Dios si le importa, y si lees un poco, lo demostró desde el comienzo, cuantas parejas le hizo a Adán??? y si lees un poco mas te darías cuenta de que si en algún momento alguno de los patriarcas tuvo mas de una pareja, no fue idea de Dios!! ya que en ningún momento el se los ordeno o se los sugirió!!y todos recibieron el castigo por su desvarió como lo estamos recibiendo hoy toda la humanidad!!Y si el condón fuera la solución no naceríamos con uno?? Dios nos dio las relaciones sexuales  para reproducirnos y gozarnos de ellas con responsabilidad!! No tomamos conciencia de la responsabilidad que es tener relaciones sexuales.<br>  Ahora bien, pongo el siguiente ejemplo, le darías un arma a un ni?o de 12 a?os? Y luego esperarías que hiciera buen uso de ella? El condón funciona similar, le estamos diciendo a nuestros jóvenes, “Ten, ten relaciones sexuales, no importa, no te va a pasar nada, no importa con quien las tengas, ni con cuantas personas tengas” y cuando el accidente ocurre esperamos que respondan responsablemente!!! O me vas a decir que los accidentes no ocurren? <br>  Quiero decir que no soy Católico y que si creo en Dios, esta pregunta ha sido muy discutida desde que la iglesia dio su posición al respecto, pero el problema al discutirla es que nunca esta completa, la iglesia en todos sus discursos no solamente dice que no aprueba el uso del preservativos, el objetivo principal de la iglesia es el fomentar “LAS RELACIONES SEXUALES CON RESPONSABILIDAD”. Y el mejor ejemplo para comprobarlo es el siguiente, ha disminuido el SIDA por el uso del condón? O han dejado de existir las enfermedades venéreas? Y si nos remontamos a los orígenes de todas estas enfermedades, encontraremos un factor común, todas se han dado por tener demasiadas parejas sexuales,  el problema no es el uso o no del condón, el problema es la conciencia de las personas al escoger sus parejas sexuales, la mayoría de las personas piensan “me pongo el condón y no pasara nada” y no les importa con quien tienen relaciones sexuales, la postura de que “cada quien haga lo que le de la gana”, tampoco funciona, y es que todos somos hijos, padres, hermanos, novios, etc.. de alguien y a nadie le gustaría que su papá salieran con varias mujeres, o que tu novia(o) tenga varias parejas sexuales, pero todos usan el condón como un parche al problema, ya nadie piensa en que puede dejar o quedar embarazada, solo se pone el condón por una noche y todo resuelto, pero como podemos ver los accidentes ocurren y surgen hijos sin padres, abortos, todo por no tener la conciencia a la hora de tener relaciones sexuales.|`|baa65356c86f3c94bc6b043877a206e3aa	No los conozco!|`|a52faacf8fef4d5c9c0c94a3c7f8401caa	ni idea, porque, tambien si dejamos el uso de eso, contraeriamos enfermedades facilmente...|`|06888ff9e36d481a1213b3ee4e4ab71eaa	La iglesia no prohíbe el uso del condón. La Biblia reprueba las relaciones sexuales sin fines reproductivos.<br>  <br>  Hay que tomar en cuenta, que hace miles de a?os, no había la población que hay ahora, entonces era muy importante generar descendencia. Además antes la medicina y la ciencias de la salud tenían el desarrollo de hoy en día, por lo que la expectativa de vida era muy reducida.|`|0974967e082ad43a5afa1bd6e8df8d69aa	LO KE DEBERIA DE PROHIBIR ES KE HAYA TANTA SOBREPOBLACION, NI?OS KON HAMBRE, SIN LA POSIBILIDAD DE UNA VIDA MEJOR, SIN UNA BUENA KALIDAD DE VIDA|`|161cd96920709717defa3ee723753a59aa	Hola es interesante lo ke dices realmente yo no sabía ke la Iglsia prohibe el uso del condón mmmmmmmm pero pues si preguntas ke si eso a Dios le importaria realmente pienso ke no, osea no me refiero ke no le importe en su totalidad pero pues si es para un fin como es el bienestar de nosotros y para evitar enfermedades y embarazos no deseados, yo creo ke lo apoyaría!!!|`|594a009424409af48f63be0985a9a0e2aa	Considero que Dios prefiere que se tengan los hijos con amor, y no "por accidente". Además es bien visible para todos, no sé cómo ellos no lo ven, que la mayoría de las familias que tienen infinidad de hijos o no los pueden alimentar bien, o no los pueden atender como se merecen a cada uno en particular.<br>  Pero la principal razón que deberían considerar para comenzar a hacer una gran campa?a  A FAVOR de todos los anticonceptivos seguros (condón, pastillas, etc.), es la campa?a en contra del aborto. La única manera de comenzar a disminuir los abortos inducidos es hacer una gran campa?a de anticoncepción y planificación familiar, y repartir y ense?ar cómo usarlos. Los métodos "naturales", (de Ogino-Knaus, etc., o sea contar los días, etc.) está demostrado que son un sorteo, sólo deben usarse si realmente les da lo mismo quedar embarazada o no. El del coitus interruptus supongo que no lo deben permitir e igualmente no sirve para nada.<br>  En cuanto a no permitir el condón para prevenir enfermedades de transmisión sexual... sería como no permitir usar vacunas, no tiene lógica. Por supuesto que el método más seguro de prevención es la abstinencia o la fidelidad. El condón no es 100% seguro (puede romperse, salirse, etc, no lo digo porque sea poroso como dicen algunos), pero es bastante seguro.<br>  Cabe aclarar que es la Iglesia Católica la que lo prohíbe, las demás iglesias, salvo excepciones, lo dejan a la conciencia de cada uno.<br>  <br>  Pero por si no les queda claro a los que los prohíben...<br>   MáS ANTICONCEPCIóN = MENOS ABORTOS<br>  MENOS ANTICONCEPCIóN = MáS ABORTOS.<br>  <br>  Creo que ellos no están a favor del aborto, ?no?|`|647fa2b6292e7f7fb330c6781950579eaa	bueno habria  que ver si los sacerdotes lo usan ya que se supone que ellos son los representantes de dios en la tierra. y si como se avisto ultimamente que tienen relaciones sexuales y hasta la iglecia a sido demandada por abuso sexual. realmente no creo que ha dios la importe mucho este detalle.

O chocolate também é um estimulante para o sistema nervoso. “A cafeína e uma outra substancia presente no chocolate, a “teobromina”, s?o as responsáveis por esses estímulos”, Outro motivo para o sucesso absoluto do chocolate é o prazer que ele causa. “O chocolate é t?o querido entre as mulheres, principalmente durante a TPM, porque traz uma enorme sensa??o de bem estar e prazer devido à presen?a de triptofano, que estimula a produ??o de serotonina, neurotransmissor responsável por estas sensa??es”, .

AA12005596	Preconceito é um mal enraizado na sociedade em todos os tempos durante a história, ser vitima dele é constante para quase todo mundo e supera-lo e um trabalho difícil quando feito sozinho, eu tento ajudar aqueles s?o perseguidos para que unidos possamos superar este mal, acabar com ele é difícil contudo diminuir os efeitos maléficos dele é um processo mais fácil.|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	Claro. Numa sociedade sem preconceitos ela se desenvolve normalmente sem desigualdades.<br>  <br>  Abra?os<br>  @|`|472fecfbf3edc1411d903ca61997dc60aa	Nos dias de hoje, onde tanto se fala em discrimina??o - seja ela de que natureza for - é um assunto que, de modo geral, provoca mal-estar e indigna??o na maioria das pessoas. Quando um grupo se posiciona abertamente contrário a um outro grupo (étnico, social, sexual, etc), acabará afetando com suas idéias apenas uma pequena parcela da sociedade.<br>  O preconceito apenas pode ser considerado um entrave no desenvolvimento da humanidade quando ele se mostra de forma velada, disfar?ada, simulando outros interesses que, de imediato, n?o demonstram caráter discriminatório.<br>  Esta é a forma de preconceito mais perigosa e covarde, capaz de levar pessoas pouco instruídas a adotarem uma postura que, originalmente, n?o fazia parte de suas vidas. Tem muita gente por aí com discurso altruísta, propagando nas entrelinhas o ódio, a discórdia, a ignorancia que apenas serve para nos separar.|`|LSdSlz27aa	Preconceito é um juízo preconcebido, manifestado geralmente na forma de uma atitude discriminatória que se baseia nos conhecimentos surgidos em determinado momento como se revelassem verdades sobre pessoas ou lugares determinados. Costuma indicar desconhecimento pejorativo de alguém ao que lhe é diferente. As formas mais comuns de preconceito s?o o social, racial e sexual.<br>  <br>  Preconceito racial e etnocentrismo <br>  Preconceito sexual: sexismo, machismo e femismo <br>  Preconceito lingüístico <br>  Homofobia, Transfobia e Heterossexismo <br>  Xenofobia <br>  Discrimina??o <br>  Chauvinismo <br>  Preconceito social <br>  Estereótipo<br>  <br>  Escala de Allport é um método para medir o preconceito numa sociedade. Também é conhecida por Escala de Preconceito e Discrimina??o de Allport ou Escala de Preconceito de Allport. Ela foi descrita pelo psicólogo Gordon Allport em seu livro The Nature of Prejudice (1954).<br>  <br>  A Escala de Allport vai de 1 a 5.<br>  <br>  Nível 1 - Antilocu??o<br>  <br>  Antilocu??o significa um grupo majoritário fazendo piadas abertamente sobre um grupo minoritário. A fala se dá em termos de estereótipos negativos e imagens negativas. Isto também é chamado de incitamento ao ódio. é geralmente vista como inofensiva pela maioria. A antilocu??o por si mesma pode n?o ser danosa, mas estabelece o cenário para erup??es mais sérias de preconceito. Por exemplo, piadas sobre portugueses (no Brasil), brasileiros (em Portugal), ******, gays etc.<br>  <br>  Nível 2 - Esquiva<br>  <br>  O contato com as pessoas do grupo minoritário passa a ser ativamente evitado pelos membros do grupo majoritário. Pode n?o se pretender fazer mal diretamente, mas o mal é feito através do isolamento.<br>  <br>  Nível 3 - Discrimina??o<br>  <br>  O grupo minoritário é discriminado negando-lhe oportunidades e servi?os e acrescentando preconceito à a??o. Os comportamentos têm por objetivo específico prejudicar o grupo minoritário impedindo-o de atingir seus objetivos, obtendo educa??o ou empregos etc. O grupo majoritário está tentando ativamente prejudicar o minoritário.<br>  <br>  Nível 4 - Ataque Físico<br>  <br>  O grupo majoritário vandaliza as coisas do grupo minoritário, queimam propriedades e desempenham ataques violentos contra indivíduos e grupos. Danos físicos s?o perpetrados contra os membros do grupo minoritário. Por exemplo, linchamento de ****** nos Estados Unidos da América, pogroms contra os judeus na Europa, e a aplica??o de pixe e penas em mórmons nos EUA dos anos 1800.<br>  <br>  Nível 5 - Extermínio<br>  <br>  O grupo majoritário busca a extermina??o do grupo minoritário. Eles tentam liquidar todo um grupo de pessoas (por exemplo, a popula??o dos índios norte-americanos, a Solu??o Final para o Problema Judeu, a Limpeza étnica na Bósnia etc).

Na maioria das vezes o ciumes é por se sentir insegura no relacionamento, a mulher tem medo de ser trocada, de ser dispensada, de ser vista por vc sem interesse, por se sentir as vezes feia ou inferior a outras mulheres. Tenha certeza que a mulher ciumenta sofre muito, muito mesmo. Ela até pode brigar com vc, armar o barraco mais depois ela chora muito, se arrepende. O ciumes é muito forte e as vezes a mulher n?o tem controle a esse sentimento. Tente fazer com que ela se sinta Linda, Sua, Poderosa e n?o fique olhando a mulherada na rua né ! se aparecer uma mulher que chame aten??o , vire o rosto quando estiver perto da sua Amada, fa?a de conta que nem viu...e n?o fique elogiando fulana, o cabelo de ciclana..a Unica que merece elogios é a SUa !!!

Este mesmo Jesus que bateu na minha porta, está sempre batendo na porto do seu cora??o e chamando vc para estar com Ele, se vc aceitar ent?o vc será feliz, n?o há mais nada que lhe possa trazer a felicidade sen?o Jesus. Meu amigo, n?o se aborre?a por lhe falr de Jesus, porque sem Ele nós n?o poderemos fazer nada. LEIA Jo?o 15:5" onde Jesus disse " ...sem mim nada podeis fazer" LEIA ainda DT.29:29, onde está escrito que as coisa emcobertas pertence a Deus e as reveladas pertence a nós e aos nossos filhos, paraque se cumpra esta Lei. Digo isto porque pode acontecer que para vc, eu possa está sendo um fanático... crist?o, isto é locura para quem n?o foi chamado por Deus, só mente os escolhidos por Jesus s?o que tem esse privilágio. LEIA Jo?o 15:16 e veja quem é que nos escolhe para estar ao lado do Senhor. Vc pode ser escolhido ainda hoje, caso queira aceitar Jesus como o seu único salvador, ent?o será feliz para sempre. Vá a uma igreja onde se prega o verdadeiro envangelho de Jesus Cristo e tome posse destas bên??os assim como eu tomei, e seja feliz, assim como eu sou. Jesus te ama e eu também.

Die Autorin Gudrun Fey empfiehlt in ihrem Ratgeber "Gelassenheit siegt", ruhig zu bleiben, auch wenn der Betroffene sich von anderen provoziert fühlt. Dabei geht es nicht darum, das jemand st?ndig so tun solle, als berührten ihn die Vorg?nge nicht weiter. Wesentlich sei vielmehr, auf Attacken so zu reagieren, wie der Einzelne es für richtig h?lt. Das k?nne durchaus auch ein Wutanfall sein, wenn es dem Betroffenen angebracht erscheint. Verbleibt der Angegriffene allerdings in der Rolle, die der Gegner ihm zugedacht hat, ist er meist in der schw?cheren Position. So werde beispielsweise ein cholerischer Chef vermutlich sein Verhalten gegenüber einer Angestellten ?ndern, wenn sie einfach einmal zurück brüllt und damit die vorgegebene Hierarchie durchbricht.<br>  <br>  Geht der Versuch jedoch schief, lohnt es sich für den Betroffenen, an der eigenen Einstellung zu arbeiten. Ziel ist es laut Expertin Fey dabei, die innere Ruhe zu bewahren. Denn wer es schafft, sich nicht durch Ausf?lle anderer aus der Fassung bringen zu lassen, für den stellen Pampigkeiten von Vorgesetzten oder Kollegen kein wirkliches Problem dar. Derart ausgeglichene Menschen betrachten solche Patzer als menschliche Fehler oder Schrulligkeiten und ?rgern sich nicht weiter darüber.|`|fc6dc15ec491239d0a71c8d517617182aa	.....such Dir langsam, gewissenhaft und in aller Ruhe eine neue Stelle - 'ungekündigt' ist auch heute noch ein Argument bei der Stellensuche/Bewerbung.

War nur lauter als Er, um Ihn mit fester Stimme zu verdeutlichen, das Er unrecht hat und ich mir solche Gespr?che besonders vor anderen verbitte.<br>  Ist natürlich nicht immer ratsam bei Vorgesetzten. Am besten ruhig bleiben und Ihn austoben lassen. Ich bleibe dabei besonders h?fflich aber bestimmt, Grenzen darf ein Chef nicht übertreten.

ZEb7B1M5aa	Lore,<br>  <br>  Saiba que "os olhos das pessoas revelam muito mais que mil verdades ditas". Quando uma pessoa entra em um processo psicoterápico, muitas vezes teme revelar algum segredo ao terapeuta. Pensa que pode "esconder" ou deixar de dizer algumas coisas. Saiba que nesse processo o terapeuta n?o só escuta as queixas, ouve a hitória de vida, observa o comportamento e aplica testes. Ele observa todo um contexto em que o cliente/paciente está envolvido. Nessee sentido os olhos, o olhar, a express?o facial e o comportamento s?o fundamentais. Prova disso é que todo o processo de entrevista é feito "olho-no-olho".<br>  <br>  Além disso, o olhar insistente revela que a pessoa deseja algo ou alguém. <br>  <br>  Já dizia "Adoniram" (compositor) = "Tiro ao alváro" "...seu olhar mata mais do que bala de carabina, que veneno extrequinina, que peixeira de baiano...

Mas esse senhor também disse certa vez que se todos os governos seguissem os passos de Jesus aí teriam encontrado a solu??o para a paz. De modo que é o que tento fazer, seguir o exemplo que Jesus nos deixou, assim sendo o dia mais importanto do ano para mim é a Celebra??o da sua morte que ocorreu no dia 14 de nis? e que é celebrada anualmente peas Testemunhas de Jeová no dia exacto que calha esse dia no nosso calendário. Porquê? Porque foi com a sua morte que possebilitou que tivessemos o perd?o de nossos pecados e esperan?a de viver num novo mundo que há-de vir um dia...

Esse valor inclui, entre muitos outros itens, a seguran?a do papa, as ambulancias, os postos de saúde e os hospitais para as pessoas que v?o acompanhar a visita, as obras na Basílica de Aparecida, no Campo de Marte, no Seminário Bom Jesus e na Fazenda Esperan?a, o recapeamento de ruas e a constru??o de um reservatório de água em Aparecida, os folhetos das missas, e as vestes, a alimenta??o e a hospedagem dos bispos que participar?o do encontro com Bento XVI na Catedral da Sé.<br>  <br>  Os valores de outros gastos, porém, s?o guardados a sete chaves. A Aeronáutica, por exemplo, n?o diz quanto desembolsou para buscar os dois papamóveis em Roma. O Mosteiro de S?o Bento, em S?o Paulo, que hospedará o papa por duas noites, também n?o divulga quanto já gastou - sua reforma incluiu cameras de seguran?a, internet sem fio, pintura das paredes, restaura??o de imagens sacras, ilumina??o externa, remodela??o de jardins e até polimento de mármore.<br>  <br>  Com menos pudor, o Seminário Bom Jesus, em Aparecida, onde o papa dormirá nas duas últimas noites no Brasil, abriu suas contas e revelou ter recebido R$ 6 milh?es de um grupo de empresários. O dinheiro serviu, entrou coisas, para construir um elevador.|`|WzrChwE6aa	Só vi pela televis?o.|`|ZbtP8lXsaa	Impossível n?o ver o papa, pois nos noticiários e em todos os lugares só falavam nisso ate paresse que o pais parou por causa disso, n?o que eu n?o goste do papa, mais é que desse jeito p pais n?o vai para a frente.|`|qBUpRmqyaa	N?o vi e n?o gostaria de ter visto.<br>  Ainda bem que ele já foi embora n?o aguentava mais noticias sobre o papa.<br>  Ele tinha tanto seguran?a em volta e o Rio de Janeiro vivendo uma verdadeira guerra, nem parece que estamos no mesmo país.<br>  é lamentável.|`|v28DqvBFaa	Vi o Papa apenas pela televis?o.<br>  N?o sou católica.<br>  Acredito que a visita dele tenha trazido paz e esperan?a para aqueles que acreditam e tem fé em Deus (católicos). <br>  E mesmo para os n?o católicos, além de Papa ele é chefe de estado, e tem influencia política, é bom que leve uma boa imagem do Brasil para outros países.|`|AA12005596	N?o vi, mas gostei da visita dele ao Brasil.

u5C2xFBEaa	I don't believe that anywhere, except the US and Islamic countries, even cares about public breastfeeding or exposure in general. Not to the extent of having about four related questions in one thread.<br>  <br>  Fundamantal moralists need to get a grip!|`|uxwSd0KLaa	I am the mother of 5 children and I agree with you ; on all points . If they want to breastfed its ok ; but like your said its a private moment ; not a display of your breast . For those who breastfeed ; they have alternative when they go out in public ; bottles of milk or they can go [ at least ] in their car an    breastfeed their baby ; because breastfeeding is not for all woman and most of people are very uncomfortable when a woman make a display of her maternal instinct in  a public place ; of course nobody would   say nothing to the mother ; but it doesn't     'mean they are all over joy by the sight of the [ lunch ]|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I have no problem with public breast feeding so long as women are covering their breasts!! Which is what the issue really is, their refusal to cover their breasts, not the act of breast feeding. Nobody wants to be caught out in public being forced to divert their eyes because of an exhibitionist b*tch who feels a strong need to show her breasts while feeding her baby. And I dont want to hear anyone mention how the baby doesnt want to be covered..........WHOS IN CHARGE????? If you do not have any control over your infant then your an unfit mother! I guess if these stupid women want to continue their conduct, we should start allowing men to show the base of their pen*s in public because after all "ITS NATURAL".|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I don't see what the big deal is-breast-feeding has been going on for centuries. I just want ppl to cover up their breasts so I don't have to see them, that's all since I don't like looking at lots of skin, but if I see a breast I'm not going to faint.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I never "pulled out" anything.<br>  No one other than my baby saw my breast.<br>  No big deal.|`|YQOT68xFaa	I'm fine with it as long as the woman is discreet about it. Most nursing moms are - I have never actually seen a woman expose her entire breast while she's nursing. You see more booby from all the little teenage pop tarts running around at the mall than you see on a nursing woman. And I don't see too many people whining about wearing low-cut tight shirts in public. <br>  <br>  I have had two kids. I breastfed both of them for a year, sometimes in public. And I am a pretty modest woman, too. It is not indecent exposure; it's feeding a baby. Also, I am unable to pump after a couple of months - what am I supposed to do? Never go out in public? Feed my baby unhealthy formula because someone may not approve of breastfeeding? Sorry, but no. I do it discreetly; that is as much consideration as I am willing to give others. If people still don't like it, tough.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To the people who suggest nursing in a bathroom: I will breastfeed in a stinky, filthy public bathroom when you take your burger and fries into the stinky filthy bathroom and eat *your* meal there too. It is disgusting and unsanitary. I am not feeding my baby in there!! And I should not have to because I am doing nothing wrong by nursing an infant.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	If it comes from the breast, it's already warm. Not many people are out in public and able to get to a microwave when they're breast feeding. So the whole, "just pump it and bottle feed" argument is kinda dense. <br>  <br>  If someone whips out both boobs and just doesn't care, then yeah that's kinda out there, but I bet if you had a nickle for every time you saw that you couldn't even make a call on a public phone with the profits. <br>  <br>  Most women we see breast feeding do so with a shirt that can be pulled down easily for just one nipple, or open buttons to get to a nipple, with nursing bras that only expose the nipple itself really. Most also use a blanket so nobody is seeing ANYTHING actually. <br>  <br>  Think about it, when you breastfeed, you leak, so most aren't going without proper bras and nursing pads, I really doubt you're seeing much breast at all. <br>  <br>  You;re also free to not look. Problem solved.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Already answered this and I'll say again that while it is a natural thing it is also a private thing that ought to be kept that way. I do not want nor need to see this at all, ever.<br>  <br>  Some "people" have no regard for others opinions and think that they can do whatever they please even if it offends someone else. Yet ask these women (mothers) about something that men do that offends them and it's a whole different ballgame.<br>  <br>  In short, I do not want to see breastfeeding, ever.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	babies need to eat how much more natural do you want?  if it offends you then please don't eat in public again because i'm pretty sure you offend someone with your eating habits by opening you mouth in a disgusting manner that could make some people lose their appetites.....or better yet become a IV eater and no one will have to see the inside of your disgusting mouth or see any missing teeth or how yellow they may be and so on.......|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	I would suggest that if you are disturbed by breast feeding, that you are probably some kind  of pervert. That what the things are for, and babies need nourishment, and not on your schedule.<br>  <br>  Is the body so repulsive to you???<br>  <br>  Or is it just babies that you don't like???|`|RQWyYV6Laa	I find the sight of fat middle aged man chomping away at his fatty steak in a restaurant appalling.  The sight of a little baby drinking milk from its mother is not disturbing at all.  Maybe those who oppose breastfeeding in public should eat their meals in the public toilet.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I think it is ok if done discreetly . . . using a blanket, etc.  But a woman just whipping out her breast in public and suckling her tot is unnecessary and inconsiderate.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	I feel the same way, and apparently this makes me a freak here on YA.  I am simply a squeamish person in general.  I don't even like to hear other people blowing their noses, let alone babies slurping breast milk.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	I really don't like it, it makes me feel sick. But who am I to say what people should do with their babies?|`|NYU37jfGaa	If you are breastfeeding a child then you have to feed it when it needs it, otherwise it becomes uncomfortable for both baby and mother.<br>  <br>  When I was feeding my babies i therefore had the choice of either going nowhere at all, or occasionally feeding them in public places. I chose the latter.  Nobody expressed any distaste or outrage when I did so.  But then I never ran into anyone like you.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is quiet and discreet.  Nobody can see anything, because most of your tit is stuck in the baby's mouth, they can hardly see more of your breast than they would if you were wearing a low-cut dress.  Besides, if you don't like the sight of a breastfeeding woman, don't look at her.  who's forcing you?<br>  <br>  Actually, it is far more unpleasant when the child gets onto the next stage, that of taking solids.  The sight of a baby dribbling pureed food out of its mouth, or squeezing it through its fingers, is actually quite revolting, much worse than the sight of a breastfeeding woman, yet nobody ever suggests that babies on solids should not be fed in public.<br>  <br>  As for breast-pumps, I only ever tried to use one once, when I was due to have a prolonged session at the dentist when no.2 son was a baby.  It was extremely uncomfortable and I didn't like it at all.  Neither did my son who, my harassed husband told me afterwards, was enraged at being offered a bottle, refused to touch it and screamed almost continuously for the three hours I was at the dentist.  It was not a happy experience for anyone concerned.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for any woman who is married to a man with your disdainful attitude towards breastfeeding, but I suppose your wife is resigned to it.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	I think breastfeeding is natural. If a woman does it out public its one thing to have herself and the baby covered if its nursing, its another to just whip it out for the world to see. There are family restrooms that womans can feed their children in, even in the womans lounges. I dont agree with showing it to the world but being covered or in a lounge doesnt bother me. I will be breastfeeding here in a few months and im not entirely sure on being out in public doing it.|`|uhchod38aa	I think its a matter of preference. Yes, we have breast pumps, but straight from the source is just much more convenient. If the mother is being discrete, I really don't see what the big deal is. If the choice is your personal discomfort versus my child's hunger, I'm feeding the baby. I'm sorry if you're offended.|`|OjUphhrgaa	natural yes, so is urinating. i speak as a mother that breastfed, i would never assume others are comfortable with public display ( living in the usa). for me its about me and my baby. now if i had to be public, i would cover in every way possible. ( i chose to pump if i had to go out) that's me.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Yes I agree with being respectful of others, just being tactful would be nice. Then again how many men have you seen taking a piss in public in your lifetime, and that's not exactly a nurture thing...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Lux  lol that was good :)|`|gYbe3BNeaa	Nursing is the best thing for mother and child which is why a mother's right to nurse her baby in public places has been enshrined in law.<br>  <br>  If you don't like it then turn your head away, nobody's forcing you to watch.|`|1wIek546aa	I've already exposed myself to enough ridicule answering this one!|`|xZmepGVUaa	I think women can find a private spot to breastfeed their child.  That is something i need not see.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	Well I don't know where you are so maybe you've never heard, but there are these things called nursing bras and blankets that women use when nursing publicly so they don't have to just whip out their breasts.  Breast pumps take time to use and even if you bring bottles, it might not be enough for the baby as one can rarely anticipate just how hungry it will be at any given time.  <br>  <br>  One could argue that the simple fact that some people are more uncomfortable with a screeching baby should be reason enough for you to suck it up and look away.  Unless the mother goes A Clockwork Orange on you and forces you to watch her whip out a tit and slap on a baby, you can easily turn your head slightly and go about your business.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	What does "personal and private moment" mean? You make it sound like masturbation, or something. Why is eating a "personal and private moment?" When YOU eat is it "personal and private?" Or do you eat in public on occasion? Why is your eating different from a baby's?<br>  <br>  As for what others may or may not be comfortable with, I agree, to a point, that we all need to be considerate of one another, BUT where do we draw the line? Some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection...should no one kiss in public in consideration for the PDA-ophobes? <br>  <br>  And why is the breast this ucky "body part" that shouldn't be exposed? Arms are body parts, too. Breasts ARE NOT sex organs.<br>  <br>  And, please, spare me the whole "pump your milk for going out" crap. Depending on the feeding regimen, it may be VERY hard to find the time to pump between feedings. And some women, who can breast feed just fine, can't pump at all. A baby is going to get WAY more than a pump will, it's rarely enough unless you do it religiously, and someone who breast feeds exclusively will not pump that frequently.<br>  <br>  EDIT--The "logistics" of it are personal and private? Again, what does that mean? More vagueness...HOW is it "personal and private?" And why is it different from you eating?<br>  <br>  And it's important to note here that it IS perfectly legal for a woman to feed her baby in public, so it looks like you will have to suck it up and look away after all.<br>  <br>  EDIT-Yes, that's quite vague, in fact. What you are lacking is explaining WHY any of the above is an issue. WHAT about a human being being attached to another is an issue? WHY is it an issue? People who kiss are "attached" to one another...again, WHAT is the problem?|`|dmCyY2SKaa	You're entitled to your opinions, but keep in mind that I might be offended by the sight of you eating a hamburger, so why not eat in the bathroom or cover yourself with a blanket next time you eat in public? Better yet, eat at home before going out, so you don't have to offend anyone by eating in public. That's why frozen meals were created, so people could have a supply of ready made meals if they are going to be out.<br>  <br>  I do have something to say, what I'm saying is that breastfeeding is not shameful or vulgar, it's not something that women have to hide or do in private. Women should not have to feed their babies in bathrooms or cover up with blankets if their babies are uncomfortable eating underneath a blanket. Women don't have to pump their milk before going out anymore than people have to eat their meals before going out. Manufactured powder milk is nothing like breast milk... it cannot even compare. Breastfeeding is exactly like you eating a hamburger, there is nothing sexual about it, you're just conditioned to believe that breasts are sex toys and nothing more.
1bd923f06c9cde1cc57ee684b51c2faaaa	Oggetto: <br>  Priorità: Alta<br>  Vi preghiamo di trasmettere questa e-mail a tutte le donne che potete. Per  gli uomini che ricevono questa e-mail, vi preghiamo di  spedirla ad amiche,<br>   ragazze, sorelle, madri, figlie ecc. Grazie!  Controllate le etichette degli assorbenti interni che  volete acquistare, la  prossima volta, e controllate se riuscite ad<br>  individuare alcuni dei segni  familiari descritti in questa e-mail. Non meraviglia  che tante donne al  mondo soffrano di cancro alla cervice e di tumori  all'utero. Sapete che i  produttori di assorbenti i interni usano diossina e  rayon nei loro prodotti?  Sono sostanze cancerogene e tossiche!  Perchè allora gli assorbenti interni non sono contro  la legge?  Perchè gli assorbenti interni non sono un prodotto<br>   alimentare e, dunque, non  sono considerati pericolosi o illegali. ECCO LO  SCANDALO:  Gli assorbenti  interni contengono due cose che sono  tenzialmente<br>   pericolose: Rayon (per  assorbire) e diossina (un prodotto chimico usato per  sbiancare I prodotti).  A volte contengono anche piccole percentuali di  amianto, per indurre nell'organismo femminile una emorragia più intensa  (più sanguinamento più  assorbenti consumati). L'industria degli assorbenti  interni e' convinta che  noi, essendo donne, abbiamo bisogno di prodotti  candeggiati, sbiancati per  pensare che il prodotto sia puro e pulito. Il problema  e' che la diossina,  che viene  prodotta in tale processo sbiancante,  può apportare gravi danni all'organismo! La diossina  e' stata associata al  cancro da studi clinici, ed e' tossica per I sistemi<br>  immunitario e  riproduttivo.  E' anche stata associata con endometriosi e basso  numero di spermatozoi  per  gli uomini. Lo scorso settembre, l'Agenzia di<br>   Protezione Ambientale EPA ha  reso noto che non esiste un livello "accettabile" di  esposizione alla  diossina, visto che e' cumulativa e lenta a  disintegrarsi. Il pericolo Reale  viene dal contatto ripetuto (Karen Couppert "Pulling  the Plug on the Tampon  Industry") Io direi che usare circa 3-4 assorbenti  interni al giorno, per  cinque giorni al mese, per 38 anni e' un "contatto  ripetuto". Non pensate  anche voi?  Il Raion contribuisce invece ai pericoli creati da  assorbenti interni e<br>   dalla diossina perche'e' una sostanza altamente  assorbente. Percio, quando  fibre degli assorbenti interni restano nel collo  dell'utero (come di solito  accade), cio crea un  "serbatoio" di diossina nel corpo. Tra l'altro, resta  all'interno molto piu a lungo di quanto rimarrebbe con  assorbenti interni  fatti solo di cotone, perchè il rayon è più leggero e  tende ad attaccarsi.  Questo e' anche il motivo per il quale la TSS  (Sindrome da Shock Tossico)  può colpire donne che usano assorbenti interni (come  potete leggere dal  foglio informativo di TUTTI gli assorbenti interni in  commercio). QUALI SONO  LE ALTERNATIVE? Usare assorbenti esteni, o prodotti  non sbiancati e fatti  completamente di cotone.  Anche altri prodotti d'igiene femminile (assorbenti  esterni/fazzoletti)contengono diossina, ma non sono<br>   tanto pericolosi quanto  gli assorbenti interni. Sfortunatamente, prodotti non  sbiancati e in cotone  si trovano quasi solo in negozi di "prodotti  biologici" (quindi sono più  cari). Nel 1989, degli attivisti inglesi organizzarono  una  campagna contro  lo biancamento attuato con cloro. Sei settimane e  50000 lettere dopo, I<br>  produttori di diversi prodotti sanitari passarono  all'ossigeno (uno dei  metodi Verdi disponibili.

If you just started taking it really recently, then you have to be patient to see what kind of help it will provide.  However, if you have been on it for some months, and you are still feeling this depressed, you need to have your medication checked.  Did your primary care physician prescribe the medication?  If so, then you need to see a psychiatrist or a mental health nurse practitioner to either have your medication changed or the dose checked.  Personal physicians mean well, but they are not well-trained on mental health issues and frequently don't understand all the particulars about the effects of psychotropic medications.  You need a specialist.  Then you need to get into some counseling and into a support group to help you with the rest of the issues.

Os crimes com armas de fogo neste país, demonstram que bandidos a cada dia que passa est?o mais acostumados com as armas,enquanto nós vitimas temos de nos curvar diante deles pois o nosso governo n?o quer que o cidad?o de bem tenha uma arma e pior ainda n?o dá condi??es de você conhecer a própria arma.<br>  é que nossos governantes n?o s?o pessoas comuns.Eles podem se dar ao luxo de ter seguran?as armados para defender a eles e a suas famílias.<br>  As leis neste país podem colocar quem se defende na cadeia mas quem amea?a vai continuar foragido. A sociedade n?o suporta tantos problemas com assaltos, deveriamos perguntar aos nossos governantes onde está o Estado, quando um cidad?o de bem, morre nas m?os de um marginal. Lembrem-se, o Estado tem o dever de dar seguran?a para a popula??o. Ou melhor o Estado de certa forma aprovou o desarmamento para as pessoas que tentam se defender daquilo que o Estado n?o consegue dar para toda uma sociedade que luta e trabalha para sobreviver.Ent?o é racional quando tentamos nos defender, o único problema é que n?o temos a seguran?a de uma defesa bem feita.

kiOD8s8Kaa	I was on an inline skating tour in Florida a couple weeks ago, and at one point we skated past another skater who appeared to have fallen and was bleeding.  There was a police officer there (since they were escorting the tour), as well as a couple people from the National Skate Patrol.  Presumably, that means there should have been people there who could have taken care of him.<br>  <br>  Well, the next morning we found out that the guy who had fallen had died of a massive coronary arrest.  It sounded like there wasn't much they could have done for him, even with trained professionals there.  One of the friends of the skater spoke to us that morning, saying that he died doing what he enjoyed the most.<br>  <br>  I'm not assuming that your customer was having the time of his life in your store, but my point is that there isn't always something that can be done to save a life in case of an emergency.  It's a good thing you were concerned, of course, and the fact that you're still thinking about it shows that you're human and you have compassion for others.  But second-guessing yourself will just give you guilt that you don't need.  There are some medical emergencies that ordinary bystanders, even with CPR training, can't treat.<br>  <br>  You might want to think about taking a CPR course through the Red Cross or some other organization, if you haven't already.  It might make you feel more at ease about the possibility of something like this happening in the future.|`|hv3gyI9Eaa	what i see he die happy whit you around,you help someone die whit hope,a lot of people die whit hate.|`|xPeIvywdaa	hes gone, God decided it was time, if it wasnt then the daughter would have revived him or he never woulda passed out<br>  <br>  this is why you are taking med courses, to prevent this in the future, use it as a remembrance of your goals, and let it fuel your fire of motivation|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	i'm so sorry to hear this. i know it's hard to see someone you know dead. and it's not your fault. and there's nothing more you could do. in fact, the cpr trained daughter did exactly what needed to be done. <br>  <br>  it was just his time. people die...<br>  <br>  and i'm sorry.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	What a shame.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	First off I'm sorry you seen someone die. That right off the bat is extremely hard. If your not cpr certified, what could of you done differently? the daughter was doing cpr and if you pushed her aside she could of became disgruntle in the moment of stress. Truth is she did all she could do.. i'm sure if there was something else that could of been done. You would of spoke up. Honeslty it was that gentlemen's time to go and he was going no matter what anyone did.|`|PW13AMKLaa	accept it as a fact of life|`|45f823136674b05c2b27453bd834a9d2aa	As brutal as it may sound, death is a natural part of life.  People are born, they live, and eventually die.  It sounds like you actually did the right thing.  The best chance that man had of revival before the EMTs got there was receiving CPR, and since his daughter was doing that and 911 had been called, there really wouldn't have been anything you could have done in that situation.  It's normal to feel unwarranted guilt in this situation because most animals have a basic fear of death, also known as survival instinct.  Many animals, including humans, feel obligated to exhibit altruism in others' times of need, especially since we are social animals and often times other individuals survival is linked with the survival of the group.  When you aren't able to successfully help your counterparts, you feel guilt, since your primate survival instinct tells you that other humans' lives may also affect yours.<br>  <br>  I know that explanation sounds much more science-y than sympathetic, but I hope it helped to explain why you feel guilty even though there is no real reason to feel guilt.  Perhaps you could try visiting a psychiatrist?  A psychiatrist may help you manage the guilt you feel, and some companies that people work for may even pay for the session, especially since it is related to an occurrence at work.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes well for you in dealing with this traumatic incident, and believe me when I tell you that sometimes people just die, regardless of the actions taken to prevent that.  You just do your best in the situation, you know?  And seriously consider seeing a psychiatrist.|`|BbC1w6Diaa	Let it go man.<br>  <br>  Realize that everyone dies, and that there's nothing you can do about it. Even if you don't believe in God or anything, everyone has a time when they die. I'm not necessarily saying the time is chosen by God, I'm saying that there is a point where people just die, and no matter how hard you try to save them they're gone. <br>  <br>  Don't beat up on yourself too much, from the sounds of it you weren't there in time anyways. So in essence it was inevitable.|`|af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	I hear your feelings and understand your guilt.  It is not your fault and you likely could not have changed the outcome.<br>  <br>  As a doctor you will have many times when you second guess yourself.  You will be practicing medicine and doing the best you can in each case. People will die and there will be times when you wonder if you could have, should have, or maybe shouldn't have done something.<br>  <br>  You will talk about this in med school and you will remember some of your victories and all of your defeats. Remembering is good, you will be a better doctor in the long run.<br>  <br>  Medicine is an art as much as it is a science. You will acquire an attitude that will help you in the tough times so you can be smarter the next time. If you did not feel badly about the death of this person -- then I would worry. <br>  <br>  Best of luck in a long and helpful career.|`|giBfNMX6aa	You are being too hard on yourself.  If the daughter was performing CPR correctly, how would you doing the same thing change the outcome?  It wouldn't.  If you've taken CPR then you know that they tell you that there are many times it fails to revive the patient.  It's hard to watch someone die, and to feel guilty (he's dead and you're not).  Grieve, but don't beat yourself up.  I'm sorry that you had to experience that, but death is as much a part of medicine as saving someone's life.
6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Capitalist economies are inherently unstable  and invention by the government including the fed  so far has only had partial success in  making them stable. This is the biggest challenge  they have faced since they have had a policy of active intervention so we will know in a year or so if they can make the economy more stable. see history of US economy<br>  <a href="http://www.visualizingeconomics.com/2008/05/27/us-inflation-annual-percent-change-1774-2007/" rel="nofollow">http://www.visualizingeconomics.com/2008...</a>|`|TnDFT313aa	The fed intervening with interest rates for those seeking home loans caused the out of whack market that in turn caused this recession.  So no, they've done enough.|`|pXfNSVd7aa	The Fed has been intervening, unfortunately for them, the traditional tools of monetary policy are not working and the federal funds rate is hovering near the zero mark. This means that they can't lower it any further and interest rates are not responding. In order for longer term rates to fall, banks must be willing to lend out the money that they receive from the fed, and not just hoard it. Unfortunately with all the uncertainty that's exactly what the Banks are doing! They are holding on to the money, thereby rendering traditional monetary policy useless. In the past the fed has set up several facilities where banks have the options of borrowing, they have been taking in as collateral asset backed securities. More recently the Fed is busy intervening in long term markets directly. So they are doing a lot, it's just things have gotten really bad, which is why the government, and fiscal policy have taken center stage.

But it has been said that those who kill themselves must return here again and do it all over again. I for one, do not want that. When I leave here, I never want to come back, and so I will endure this prison called life, until it is done. After all, everyone living is presently enduring a death watch. And the time you spend here is very short indeed when you look at the overall scale of the universe. Try to make the decision to cope with what ever comes your way good or bad, knowing that when it is over, and has run its course, and you die of natural causes, you will not be destined to return to this prison of meaningless existence, and will probably even be rewarded with happiness for the first time. Life is tough. And to those of us who remain tougher, and endure it to the end, we will be rewarded. Take everything in life lightly knowing that life here, can not, does not, go on forever. Physical life in short then, is a test you must pass, in order to get out of it. Good luck and stay strong--we will stay strong--you and I, and all others like us, for one we will meet in a new life where pain is no more, and there will be no more return trips to this disease called life.

My grandfather killed himself and my father, grandmother, mother and aunt have all been hospitalized at least once since I was born for attempt at suicide. It won't be worth it.. it may seem like the only way out but think about a week from now... people will be hurt by it but they will have to move on... Don't do that to the people around you. It helps me a lot to write about it. I hope this helps. E-mail if you need someone to talk to.

Molti si scoraggiano e trovano quindi la cosa difficile perché si aspettano immediati riscontri dai propri sforzi. Invece cambiare è facile ma serve pazienza e una lucida osservazione delle 'ricadute' e degli apparenti momenti di stasi. Comunque non darei così tanta importanza al 'farsi avanti nella società'. Si può ribaltare il punto di vista e vedere che le persone che strepitano di più lo fanno per mascherare le proprie insicurezze e il proprio vuoto interiore e vengono accettate proprio per lo stesso motivo.

E mais, dará errado da pior maneira, no pior momento e de modo que cause o maior dano possível.<br>  - Todo corpo mergulhado numa banheira faz tocar o telefone.<br>  - A informa??o mais necessária é sempre a menos disponível.<br>  - O pessimista se queixa do vento, o otimista espera que ele mude, o realista ajusta as velas e quem conhece Murphy n?o faz nada.<br>  - A probabilidade do p?o cair com o lado da manteiga virado para baixo é proporcional ao valor do carpete.<br>  - O gato sempre cai em pé.<br>  - N?o adianta amarrar o p?o com manteiga nas costas do gato e o jogar no carpete. Provavelmente o gato comerá o p?o antes de cair em pé.<br>  - A fila do lado sempre anda mais rápido, e n?o adianta trocar de fila, a outra sempre será mais rápida....kkkkkkkk<br>  - Se você está se sentindo bem, n?o se preocupe. Isso passa.<br>  - Se a experiência funcionou na primeira tentativa, tem algo errado.<br>  - Mais vale um pássaro na m?o do que um voando sobre a nossa cabe?a.<br>  - Por mais tomadas que se tenham em casa, os móveis est?o sempre na frente.<br>  - Existem dois tipos de esparadrapo: o que n?o gruda, e o que n?o sai.<br>  - Uma pessoa saudável é aquela que n?o foi suficientemente examinada.<br>  - Você sempre acha algo no último lugar que você procura.<br>  - Toda partícula que voa sempre encontra um olho aberto.<br>  - Os primeiros 90% de uma tarefa demora 90% de tempo a executar. Os restantes 10% demora outros 90%.<br>  - Uma gravata limpa atrai sempre a sopa do dia.<br>  - Conclus?o é o ponto onde você ficou cansado de pensar.<br>  - Se está escrito Tamanho único, é porque n?o serve em ninguém.<br>  - Se algo é confidencial, será esquecido na máquina de xerox.<br>  - Se o conserto ficou perfeito, e porque você usou a ferramenta errada.<br>  - Todo arame cortado no tamanho indicado será curto demais.<br>  - As pe?as que sempre exigem manuten??o estar?o colocadas nos lugares mais inacessíveis.<br>  - Qualquer equipamento coberto por uma garantia, deixará de funcionar logo após a garantia expirar.<br>  - Você sempre encontrará o defeito no último lugar em que procurar.<br>  - N?o é possível sanar um defeito antes das 17 e 30h da sexta-feira.<br>  - O defeito será facilmente sanado as 9 e 01h da segunda-feira.<br>  - A informa??o mais necessária, é sempre a menos disponível.<br>  <br>  ??<br>  <br>  Espero que tenha gostado, pois eu sempre dou muita risada quando leio...kkkkkkkkkkk<br>  <br>  ??|`|7114515a23c4157a39bfe50e37a1fcfbaa	Acho que o coitado do  Murphy deve ter sofrido um bocado, pra ter descobrir isso td... rsrsrrss<br>  <br>  Bjinhos.|`|fc9f3558499f81d447347723d4747460aa	Existe uma teoria a esse respeito, quando o que procuramos está sempre no final da pilha ou quando estamos esperando o ?nibus o nosso é o que mais demora.|`|242ca19fd7dc56821ff28f2e4a2419f2aa	Toda vez !!!<br>  E o pior , se eu estiver com o meu marido ele quer ficar trocando de fila.

b1KBkYIVaa	Mi è successo in passato quando per una serie di strane circostanze mi sono ritrovata a consolare la ragazza con cui il mio ex-ragazzo mi aveva tradito... Che serataccia! E pensare che lei era venuta a "scusarsi per l'accaduto.".. Io le ho detto la verità su come erano realmente andate le cose , le ho illustrato in che modo balordo lui si era comportato con entrambe, le ho raccontato che non mi aveva mai lasciato, a differenza di quello che aveva detto a lei. Morale della favola: due birre e tanti fazzoletti di carta per la povera sventurata. Non conoscevo questa ragazza eppure mi si stringeva il cuore nel vederla soffrire tanto, le sono stata vicino per un lungo periodo, fino a che non si è ripresa. Non siamo rimaste amiche ma in compenso abbiamo superato insieme una fase abbastanza critica.<br>  Le mie amiche all'epoca mi dicevano tutte che io ero fuori di testa, al mio posto loro si sarebbero scatenate con calci e oggetti di varia natura su di lei. Io ho visto una persona che come me soffriva per qualcuno che non lo meritava.

Se voces pesquisarem verao que em épocas remotas o homem usava brincos também. Certos acessorios  caem melhor para o público feminino e outros para o público masculino. E com isso nao quero dizer que o brinco nao seja acessório também para homem. Um homem usa brinco porque está mais seguro de si mesmo hoje em dia. Porque esse homem sabe que o brinco nao fere sua masculinidade. E porque o Marketing e os grandes desenhadores (que trabalham com esse novo nicho de mercado que sao produtos adaptados exclusivamente para esse público) sabem que estao com um filao na mao. Eu adoro homem de brinco! Desde que seja algo discreto e que combine com o rosto, personalidade e roupas desse homem. Eu nao vejo um super gato com um brinco de tipo Carmem Miranda, com terno e gravata e uma maleta na mao. Resumindo: é uma questao de coragem um homem usar brincos e nao tem nada a ver esse papo de que ele está despertando o seu lado feminino ou coisas desse tipo. Tem que ter personalidade para p?r um brinco e aceitar as críticas. E muitos morrem de vontade e nao fazem e solta respostinhas discriminativa. E esquece que em muitas lojas no Brasil há muito tempo que foi lan?ada uma calcinha que nao é calcinha é na verdade uma cueca desenhada para mulher. E aí como fica?

O antigo nome do ácido sulfúrico era Zayt al-Zaj, ou óleo de vitríolo, cunhado pelo alquimista medieval iraniano Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber), que também é o provável descobridor da substancia. O ácido sulfúrico tem várias aplica??es industriais e é produzido em quantidade maior do que qualquer outra substancia (só perde em quantidade para a água). A produ??o mundial em 2001 foi de 165 milh?es de toneladas, com um valor aproximado de 8 bilh?es de dólares. O principal uso engloba a fabrica??o de fertilizantes, o processamento de minérios, a síntese química, o processamento de efluentes líquidos e o refino de petróleo.<br>  <br>  Uma característica peculiar ao ácido sulfúrico é quanto ao seu comportamento relacionado à concentra??o. Quando diluído (abaixo de concentra??es molares de 90%), a solu??o assume caráter de ácido forte e n?o apresenta poder desidratante. Por outro lado, quando é concentrado (acima de 90%), deixa de ter caráter ácido e acentua-se o seu poder desidratante.|`|siYL1UG7aa	H2SO4
