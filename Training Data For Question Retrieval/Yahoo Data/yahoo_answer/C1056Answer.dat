OAEuYZkZaa	Shotguns are short to medium range weapons.  If you are a good shot and have a shotgun that is set up for slug shooting, you can stretch maximum range out to about 100 yards.  With Buckshot effective range is more like 50-70 yards, depending on the choke.  Small shot, i.e. birdshot is only effective out to about 40 yards.  At 40 yards, most birdshot won't even penetrate a heavy jacket.<br>  <br>  Shotguns are best for wing shooting birds and waterfowl, but are also required for deer hunting in some states.  Buckshot and slugs are used for deer hunting and for defensive use.<br>  <br>  Rifles are effective to much longer ranges.  Depending on the caliber, rifles can have an effective maximum range of anywhere from a couple of hundred yards to well over 1,000 yards.<br>  <br>  (NOTE:  Maximum range and Maximum Effective range are not the same thing.  For example a box of .22 LR cartridges will have a warning that the bullets are dangerous to a range of 1 1/2 miles.  That doesn't mean you can hit the broad side of a large barn on purpose with a .22 LR at a range of 2610 yards.  Effective Range, i.e. the range at which an experienced shooter can reasonably expect to place a bullet within his chosen target is much more like 150-200 yards.  Likewise, a box of .308 Winchester cartridges that warns of having a range of 3 `1/2 miles has an effective range in the neighborhood of 500 yards for most shooters and up to 1200 yards for experienced long range shooters.)<br>  <br>  For home defense, the shotgun is generally considered to be more effective, but I prefer handguns or lever-action rifles in pistol calibers.<br>  <br>  Handguns in suitable calibers are fine hunting firearms.  Every game animal on earth, up to and including elephant and whales have been taken with handguns.  .22 caliber handguns are great for squirrels, rabbit and other small game.  For deer sized animals nothing less powerful than a .357 Magnum should be used, and in honesty a .357 Magnum handgun is pretty marginal for deer sized game.  The most popular hunting handgun calibers are .41 Mag, .44 RemMag, .45 Long Colt, .454 Casull, and a host of wildcat cartridges such as the .475 and .500 Linebaugh cartridges.<br>  <br>  With a shotgun using #2 shot and smaller (the larger the number with shot the smaller the pellet, #12 shot is smaller than the period at the end of this sentence.) is good for all types of birds and small game such as squirrel, rabbits,raccoonn, possums or varmints.  On the downside, if you want to save the pelt, shotguns tear up the hides to the point they are prettty useless.  As a rule of thumb the larger the game the larger the shot you need.  For deer and defensive use you need buckshot or slugs.  For hunting use 00 (pronounced "double-ought") or 000 ("triple-ought) buckshot.  For defensive use, #1 buckshot reduces risks oover-penetrationon while still giving adequate penetration to inflict a lethal wound on an attacker.  0 ("single-ought") and 00 are better for lethality, but they also penetrate walls better.<br>  <br>  I really hate to say it, but if you are going to try doing everything with only one gun, the gun you use should be a 12 gauge pump shotgun.  I very much prefer revolvers and rifles to shotguns, but they just are not as versatile as the good old 12 gauge.  With a 12 gauge you can hunt squirrel,quail, dove, turkey, deer or even bear with the same gun and also use it for home defense.  Any rifle that would be suitable for bear would leave nothing but a bushy tail of a squirrel of a rabbit and would have a mighty slim chance of taking out a flying quails.<br>  <br>  Good Shooting,<br>  Doc|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Shotguns are for closer range shots = 100 yards or less.....<br>  <br>  Rifles are good for longer shots, 100, 200, 300, 400 yards or more.......|`|dpSr0icwaa	a shotgun generally fires a whole lot of small projectiles, and is a short ranged gun. This is ideal for small, fast moving targets like a duck flying through the air or a rabbit zig-zagging through the bushes, when you are close, say about 30 yards away.<br>  <br>  a rifle fires a single projectile at very high speeds and can shoot very far.   This is best for shooting longer range.  A small rifle like a 22LR is good for shooting rabbits and such...but it is easier to stay further away so the bunny doesn't notice you and doesn't run, then shoot them when they are stationary.  <br>  <br>  Now, if you have a shotgun, you can get 'slugs' for it.  A slug is a shotgun shell where instead of about 100 small bbs the shell simply has 1 real big chunck of lead.  This makes it very similar to a rifle.  This is commonly used for deer hunting and for protection against bears. It isn't nearly as long range or accurate as a rifle, but it is still good to about 100 yards.|`|OrvTG44laa	A rifle will shoot out a single bullet.  A shotgun does not shoot bullets, but shoots out many little pellets, also called 'shot'.  They can also shoot slugs though, which is basically a bullet for a shotgun.  <br>  Shotguns are used for prey that will be moving.  For example, when you hunt bird, the bird is usually flying.  Try hitting a bird in mid-flight with a single bullet.  It's not going to happen.  But with a shotgun, you shoot out many small pellets.  The pellets spread out, so they have a better chance of hitting the bird.  Shotguns can also be used for rabbit, because a lot of the time, rabbits are running away.  They are also good for squirrel, because squirrel might also run.  For turkey hunting, you need a shotgun.  You can hunt deer with a shotgun, but I advise using a rifle.<br>  A rifle is for game that isn't flying or running.  It is also great for long range.  Shotguns have a very limited range, but rifles can go much, much farther.  So for prey that won't be on the run or flying, a rifle is better.  For close range- usually under 50 yards, a shotgun is appropiate if you don't want to buy two guns.  <br>  So it all depends on what you're hunting.  If you're mainly hunting turkey, rabbit, squirrel or birds, get a shotgun.  Other game, get a rifle.<br>  I'm not legally allowed to use a hangun- I'm 14-, so I really don't know much about them.|`|TvGW3xV0aa	It depends on where you are. Most often though, shotguns are used for small game, birds, and deer (with a deer slug). A rifle is used for big game (bear, elk, moose) and sometimes even deer if you are in a place where you need to make 100 yard shots or more. Many states won't let you hunt with a rifle for deer. Handguns are used for target shooting or even hunting deer (makes it more challenging).|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I use a shotgun for brush busting and up close work slugs are great for that. At a distance though I have seen a 300 yd shot with a shotgun. My grandpa did it I have no idea how but he did it though. A rifle is the only way to make consistent shots beyond 75 yards. I am going ot get a hand gun when I turn 21 for a back up hunting gun cant be to safe.|`|CbbVUB4Waa	To be honest if you were to use a shotgun with a rifled barrel and then you shoot slugs it would be possible to kill bear, deer, elk, moose. But to answer your question most of the time there is a season that you are able to use a shotgun most of the time it can be used during rifle season. Most people don't like to use a shoot gun because you have to be at such close range to them it is to hard but to others that is part of the challenge. So heavy brushy area were the distince between you and game is under 100 yards or you can just use it for a challenge|`|Lazhb6CWaa	shotgun for protection or hunting, pistol for self defense or even a second hand arm in hunting, and a rifle would best be used for hunting.

Give him some time and Tate Forcier will have an impact. Don't undersell Rich !|`|jxKQqbC9aa	sounds pretty good but ratings mean nothing until you step on the field|`|YZiwAq0raa	I think Tate Forcier is going to be an excellent QB one day. His rankings speak for themselves. Forcier is highly regarded by every possible recruiting service, he has good speed, spetacular moves in the open field, and razor sharp accuracy. I disagree with this notion that he's the next Colt McCoy. That's an insult to Forciers running abilities. Sure McCoy is an amazing passer, but as a runner, he's nothnig special. Forcier is not that kind of QB. Forcier is the white version of Troy Smith. Forcier can run for 1000 yards in a season, and he also has the uncanny ability to scramble around in the pocket and a make a huge play just like T. Smith did for Ohio State in 2004, 2005, and 2006. <br>  <br>  With Steven Threet transfering, Justin Feagin moving to slot receiver, Denard Robinson not arriving until June, and Nick Sheridn playing himself out of the copmpetition, Forcier is guaranteed to be Michigan's starting QB next season. I'm excited about Forciers future, however, I'm skpetical about 2009. Those who think our offesne will take off when Forcier-a scrambler who is "ideal" for the spread option offense-starts next season are delusional. Forcier will be true freshman, and he will likely struggle and go through big time growing pains just like Threet did this season and Ryan Mallet did last season. He will not save our offense (although i certainly expect to see flashes of brilliance). Forcier needs to gain experience before he becomes the really good QB we all expect him to be. I expect him to play like Jice Williams did his freshmen season, and then I expect Forcier will take off.|`|HiIplkfZaa	He looks pretty good, they could have been a little better with a QB and a another half-way decent DB, They have all the starting oline returning next year too.

nnVDvFOSaa	I have never taken part in a 3 peaks challenge myself, but I have helped with running the events so I have an insight into what these challenges are like.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, from the feedback that I have heard from the teams that have taken part, it can be the most gruelling task that they have ever undertaken in their lives but very, very rewarding.  It is not a matter of a walk in the hills; you are going up three of the highest mountains in the UK and weather is subject to change a the drop of a hat (however if you are an experienced hill walker then you would know this).<br>  <br>  To take part you can either go up the charity route and persuade some colleagues at work to put together a team and then raise the required minimum your chosen charity sets.  There are quite a lot out there that use these events, and they usually rely on the expertise of companies that provide advice to teams on equipment, safety and training.  It's even better if you know that there will be communications support provided, i.e. each team is given a radio so the event managers can stay aware of your progress.  There should also be a team from the local mountain rescue organisation spread out at certain points on the mountain ready to scramble if there is a emergency.  If this attention to safety appeals to you, then I would recommend that you look at the Global Challenge UK website (www.globalchallenge.uk.com).  They are one of the leaders in organising these events and their site lists the charities that they have worked for.  There is also the opportunity to become an associate and volunteer at these events. <br>  <br>  I have also come across groups that are just carrying out a personal 3 Peaks Challenge just for the sake of it, but I would only recommend if you are an experienced hill walker.  Always, always always...  have at least 4 people taking part and at least 2 support drivers.  Make people aware at each peak where you are walking and wear the correct gear.  A decent first aid kit (with blister plasters), high energy snacks and water are always essential.  Finally...  Do not set off to Fort William on the day of the challenge start to buy yourself a pair of walking boots (I have come across some numpties) - you should ensure that they have been broken in!  For more hillwalking advice you can look at Trail or Country Walking Magazine (www.lfto.com)

gGeckNsQaa	I guess that the martial arts question has been completely missed. That amazing revelation that you were lazy just took the whole crew by storm.<br>  <br>  To be honest, no one can really recommend an art for until you get over being lazy. Like that bald guy said, we can't expect you to train seriously in anything if you refuse to get over being so lazy. No recommendation would do any good, because you would not train well enough to make it work.<br>  <br>  Now, once you get over that laziness issue, then ask the question again. But, when you do, give us more details. Is does not good to recommend BJJ if you're only 5'-3" and 120 pounds.

Did you catch the answer yet?<br>  *<br>  You simply cannot gain any success or acheivement until you overcome your laziness.

As long as you TELL yourself that you are lazy, and verbalize it in wtritten form like you did here, you will continue to be lazy. It's sad, to me, that you are so comfortable with your laziness that you will willingly share it with the whole world. Like this is the Jerry Springer show or something.<br>  *<br>  Pick up a self-improvement book. Any self-improvement book, even one specifically on weight-lifting or fitness or the martial arts. Is laziness one of the traits that will get you to the goal? No, it's not.<br>  *<br>  You want to succeed in anything, anything at all. You have to learn how to talk to yourself, how to see things right in your head, and how to motivate yourself to make things happen.

qlYEF0YAaa	Working with the paddles are invaluable. Making quick, one motion, accurate throws is what makes a shortstop. When fielding and turning double plays, it should feel like you never close your glove on the ball. The quicker the better. Soft hands are the ability to judge the hops of the baseball, which allows you to get your body and feet in the position to make the quick accurate throw. When practicing, you should never "block" a ball, every ground ball should be caught, and every throw should be accurate.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	"Soft" hands simply means you "absorb" the impact of the ball with your hands, wrists and forearms.  By "receiving" the ball and not "grabbing" it, you give yourself the valuable mili-seconds needed to turn quick plays.<br>  <br>  It all about mechanics.  "Training gloves" help you understand this because they are basically hard paddles that you strap to your glove hand.  Because they're hard and have not flex, you have no choice but to "receive" the ball with both hands.  And since your thorowing hand is already on the ball, you save valueable time not having to dig the ball out of your glove.<br>  <br>  You can easily make a training glove out of a small piece of wood and some string to tie it to you hand.  Make sure the "paddle" is only a little bigger than your hand.<br>  <br>  If you want to try out the idea without the glove, try taking infiled with your glove CLOSED.  Instead of taking grounders into the open glove, try trapping the ball on the backside of the webbing near the thumb.  I don't recommend this for long term practice, as your glove hand is in the wrong position, but it'll give you the feeling of trapping the ball vs catching it.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	You sure u have the right size glove for a shortstop. Some infielders like a smaller glove so they can find the ball in the glove faster. I played varsity ball for 4 years at short, and I like the larger glove cause of the bad throws from the catcher on steals. I use to keep my hand out of the glove partially(bottom half of heel of hand sticking out of the glove. I also threw practice was able to field 95 % of grounders in the pocket of the glove so that I knew were the ball was and were to place my throwing hand. Good practice is have someone continually hit u ground balls about 25 the first time and start increasing by 10 till u reach a hundred. U no one is available to hit them to u take a ball and throw it against a wall or the curb in front of your home and try fielding the ball into the pocket. This practice does work I used it and I tell my infielders that I coach to use it. Will help u get rid of the ball faster.<br>  <br>  Positioning yourself for the batter, also helps. Know what the pitcher is going to throw and if the batter can handle the pitch. You should be able to see this by his stance. This comes with practice and knowing your pitcher and if the batters can handle his pitches. In HS you most likely with see a batter in two games read the sports pages and see what the batters in your league are doing. Knowing your opponent gives u the advantage

The question is - for all intents and purposes, impossible to answer. This is due to the fact that it is very difficult to effectively compare two martial disciplines in a clinical environment. Each martial art has it′s own foundations, fighting theories, fundamental assumptions and origins (where it originated under what circumstances). It would be almost impossible to agree upon which precise criteria would comparisons be based upon. <br>  <br>  What is the best martial art?<br>  <br>  This is not only done by techniques because techniques and the human capacity to perform them in the short period of time (seconds) during a true case and in constantly changing environments , situations and against different opponents makes it virtually impossible to use only techniques to overcome all sorts of attacks.<br>  <br>  Let us assume we would like to compare the effectiveness of two different martial arts systems. We would need to have practitioners face off in combat. But under what rules? The very nature of the rules inevitably determines precisely which techniques will be favoured. In other words, the contest will be determined as much by individuals skills as by their ability to function comfortably within the framework created by the rules. Judo rules favour Judo practitioners and Karate rules favour Karate practitioners. It is well worth noting that mixed martial arts tournaments also have rules and limitations: After all, only two people are fighting, no weapons are allowed, weight class divisions exist, a referee is present and there are many techniques that are banned (groin strikes,spitting, eye gouges, blows to the back of the neck etc...) It will never be possible to artificially assimilate life and death combat. Besides, even if it were one fighters win would prove that individual′s/instructor's superiority, not that of his chosen martial art.<br>  <br>  So if you want to practice the best martial art first of all you must be prepared to do a lot of hard physical training (did you ever see an overweight warrior?) to prepare your body. Next explore your fears and instinctive reactions and adapt or change them to fit your needs as a warrior so you will be able to use them in true combat and finally learn to understand your opponent so you can use his fears and instinctive reactions against him.<br>  <br>  This will give you the best martial art.|`|La8dhcwzaa	There is no best martial art.

Kemp still has to prove himself.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	Kemp is better.|`|BF4qc8m1aa	Yeah, I'm going to reveal my inner-baseball nerd-dom by busting out the metrics.  A lot of people bust out Fielding Percentage to measure defense, but it is a flawed method of measurement.  If as a fielder, you refused to go after tough balls and just let them bounce, you will have  a good percentage.  If you went for every single difficult ball, you will create more errors.  Who's the better fielder: the dude who just takes the easy catches or the guy trying to make the play? <br>  <br>  I will use a number of metrics (which are mathmatical formulae created from a number of statistics and variances) to determine who is the better player.  I will base this only on last season, as it was a good year for both players.  First, I will use EqA or equivelance average. EqA measures total offensive output, from BA, to HR, to SB, everything is included and weighted.  Last year, Kemp had an EqA of .279 while Markakis is .310. This again shows a clear advantage for Markakis offensively.<br>  <br>  To measure defense, let's look at FRAR, or fielding runs above replacement player. This is the difference between an average player and a replacement player is determined by the number of plays that position is called on to make. That makes the value at each position variable over time.  Last year, Kemp has 23 FRAR, while Markakis had 15. This is a decided edge for Kemp.<br>  <br>  Now, let us examine if Kemps defensive advantage means makes up for it.  I will use Win Shares. Win Shares are a metric created to show how many wins in a season a single player is responsible for.  Last year, Markakis produced 25.1 total win shares, with 22.3 being batting win shares and 2.8 being defensive win shares. Kemp had 21.7 total win shares: 15.9 offensive and 5.8 defensive.  Win Shares show that Markakis is a significantly better hitter and Kemp is a better fielder. Win Shares shows that Markakis was responsible for 3.4 more wins last year than Kemp, and therefore is a more valuable player.<br>  <br>  WARP, or Wins Above Replacement Player, also measures the complete worth of a player compared to a replacement player. Kemp's WARP was 6.5, Markakis was 8.9.<br>  <br>  All of these metrics should show to you that, while Kemp is a better defender, Markakis is the better overall player.|`|PjFd29pHaa	kemp|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	When both are in RF, Markakis has the better fielding percentage, but Kemp's CF fielding percentage is better than Markakis' RF fielding percentage.<br>  Markakis has the better OBP, which in turn gives him the better OPS (as well as a few more runs, HRs, and RBIs).<br>  Kemp is much better at stealing bases, which is the deciding factor when the other numbers are eerily similar.<br>  <br>  This has to be the most difficult question I've answered on here.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Increase your vertical leap. You will need the lifting power of your legs to get you in the air and up to the basket.<br>  <br>   Plyometrics are the best (and often fastest) ways to get results. Doing squats, or if you don't have weights, wall sits, also help you gain those inches. <br>  <br>  Something that also helps is having strong abdominal muscles(Abdominals have little or no effect on jumping. They are stabilizers and do not help with movement[1]). Increasing your height will take time, though, so stick with it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Muscle groups that need to be stronger: Quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, calves. The quadriceps extend the knee. The hamstrings and gluteals extend the hip.<br>  <br>  <br>   The calves plantar flex the ankle. <br>  Muscle groups that need flexibility: Hamstrings and hip flexors. Tight hamstrings will impede the knee extension during the jump. Hip flexors resist the hip extension part of the jump. <br>  <br>  <br>  Running stairs will develop the quadriceps, hips, and calves. <br>  Invest in a good pair of shoes. Most players find that high-quality shoes improve their ability to dunk, and more importantly, prevent you from getting hurt when you try to dunk. <br>  <br>  <br>  Practice jumping at the court.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jump across the whole court and back. Try two laps or more. <br>  Jump to touch the net with a running jump until you are able to do it ten times in a row (not all in one day!). <br>  <br>  <br>  Progress to the goal of touching the backboard, again until you can do it ten times comfortably. <br>  <br>  <br>  Set your sights on the rim until you can touch it consistently. <br>  Practice handling the ball. Get a feel for how to use inertia to control the ball when your arm is extended. Even people who can palm a basketball will lose grip when dunking. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Start with an adjustable height basket, if you have access to one. Lower the height so you can get a feel for dunking, then raise it gradually to the standard height as you improve. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Dribble toward the basket, then take the allowed two steps while palming the ball in your dunking hand. Jump as high as you can after your second step, extend your arm to the rim, and drive the ball through the net.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most people jump off of one foot, but some people find that they jump higher off of two. Find what works for you. <br>  Dunk a tennis ball or golf ball first, then a volleyball, and work your way up to a basketball. <br>   <br>  Dunk one-handed first. It helps to find a small sized Basketball to train with. It takes a lot more effort to touch the rim with two hands, because you must jump high enough that both reach the rim. After that, you can progress to the reverse dunk. <br>  <br>  <br>  The ball may come back and hit you in the face. Be prepared for it. Fear of getting hit will negatively affect your ability to dunk. <br>  Let go of the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Be persistent. You'll likely embarrass yourself during your first several attempts to dunk, but get up off the floor and try again. You'll be impressed at your improvement if you keep going. <br>  <br>  Do backboard touches for 2 minutes|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Do Squats and Situps.|`|XlFMwaasaa	get one of those ankle strengtheners that make you walk on your toes all day. people in my high school did it without any trouble from teachers|`|jDi063pQaa	I have found what I think is the best free resource for jump training information. This guy's blog... <a href="http://youtube.com/jumptrainer" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/jumptrainer</a>|`|C4mzZwiWaa	practice jumping|`|XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|GZYBSV7Raa	If you are looking for those last few inches to dunk, consider these quick tips: Visualization, a forceful arm swing, pnf stretching, and strengthening the tibialis anterior and toe muscles.<br>  <br>  The provided link goes into these tips in greater detail.<br>  <br>  James T.|`|17ixPSQQaa	My coach use to tell me to jump onto something solid that was about 3 feet high ( the bottom bleacher works good) and then jump off as fast as I could and keep doing this until you feel the burn.

That being said Jeremy is washed up. He's not really that old but he has had well over 100 pro fights on his official record. I'm sure there were many fights that weren't sanctioned so there not on his record. That's just how it was back when he started. And not to mention how many amature fights did he have. The human face is not built to be punched and whether us fighters want to admit it or not the more you get hit the slower you react to being hit. Horn has just been hit to many times. The 2nd fight with Liddell didn't help things . He hasn't really been the same since then. Bisbing would overwhelm him much like Palhares did.

There is also a stupid rule that you cant scout for youth players not within a certain catchment area of the club, effectively preventing English clubs from scouting players in other parts of the country. So, they look at foreign players...nothing stopping other clubs doing the same, so guess spotting the potential and developing the players isnt as easy as you seem to think...giovanni dos santos a case in point.<br>  <br>  Fabregas credits Arsenal, not barcelona for developing to his potential.

QouSk1E7aa	Not all of them, but a lot of them are indeed hypocritical.<br>  <br>  Sting is a bigger example than Cena.

WORKRATE is EVERYTHING and the only thing that matters....Once the WWE machine started to give Cena a gimmick all the hate started because the "throwback" gimmick had a short life as did every single WWE concept at the time.  Bad gimmicks stay with wrestlers for their whole career.....it would take YEARS for somebody to get past a lame gimmick.....just look at Burchill who people once thought had a future in the company.....its hard to overcome the lame pirate gimmick......look at the Spirit Squad....Lenny....oh I mean Kenny Dystrka  cannot get the fans to forget about the cheerleader gimmick.....and now he is somewhere selling Shamwow products...<br>  <br>  Bury a wrestler in his first appearance in the company and he will never go far in the company....really the fans might have ADD and short term memory but the taint of a retard gimmick like Eugene last a lifetime...|`|AA11312903	Somewhat depending on what aspect of the business they're talking about. Smarks want to see indy wrestlers who grew up in their hometowns as champions in mainstream wrestling. Problem is, mainstream wrestling isn't about the most talented its about the most marketable. Plus indy promotions allow stiffness and promote innovation in matches. Vince doesn't comply with that fearing injury to his top workers. Hating someone because of their decision to tweak their gimmick to a child's level shows you arent a true wrestling fan in the first place.|`|olZS5xQdaa	The current product with Cena at the top wouldn't have done well against WCW when they were hot in the mid to late 90s.|`|OfutBhxYaa	NO|`|FdNYv4D9aa	It's not hard to make SMARKS happy..all they (we) ask for is PROPER pushing..not UNDER or OVER pushing.<br>  <br>  I like Cena personally, but the main gripe people have is that WWE shoves TOO MUCH of him down our throats and that's NOT a good thing! At the same time, you CAN'T underpush guys who may be superior in the ring compared to Cena, especially in the game of pro wrestling.<br>  <br>  WWE NEVER gets this simple formula right and either OVER push limited guys like Cena (even if he's a great worker), and yet, under-utilizes the superior mat, technical, and mic workers. Once WWE at LEAST shows equal appreciation to the more talented in-ring performers (instead of using them like yesterday's garbage, to job to far less talented workers) then the SMARK community will have less reason to complain. <br>  <br>  Until then, the SMARK community will have EVERY right to levy endless and tireless, perfectly-warrented, criticisms against WWE.<br>  <br>  @Sirtweezy, <br>  <br>  If LOWERING my level of thinking..to a "WWE-marketable" child-friendly level....dimishes my credibility as a "true wrestling fan", then I'm PROUD to lose that credibility.....because a TRUE wrestling fan will CRITICIZE, CRITIQUE, and JUDGE WWE's every effort to desensitize and stifle the essence of professional wrestling, and will continue to recognize, appreciate, and PREACH/promote the art of wrestling that WWE is trying oh so hard to do away with. Making it marketable for kids does NOT mean that you must abandon the NWA and WCW way of doing it! Because the fans..kids and adults..will STILL support it, even if the character is/isn't "marketable". CM Punk is a FAR more accomplished and skilled talent moreso than Cena, Batista, and HHH...and is an INDY legend..........and his time on the top wasn't a waste, nor was it detrimental..and the guy has a slight aura of untapped charisma too...and coulda EASILY received the major attention and push that Cena, Batista, and Hunter always are treated to. That's a fact. Same for talents like Jericho, Christian Cage, etc...guys who are SKILLED at what they do!

iMGSaC0qaa	Well my answer would have to be both. I mean back when Hogan was in his prime He was the man among men. His character was targeted toward kids. Eat your vitamins hulkamaniacs! And he was portraited as a hero in the wrestling world. A guy kids could look up to and he was the main guy who helped wrestling reach its high points in both WWF and WCW when he was with them.<br>  <br>  When it comes to Austin, he had the same affect only on the adult crowd. his character was the beer drinking, Raise the middle finger, don't give a damn about anyone or anything which also helped revolutionize the sport to draw in more of the adult crowds to the shows and to tune in on TV. <br>  <br>  I would have to say both had a major affect on pro wrestling during their prime. You can't really compare each because their primes were so far apart, and directed toward the completly opposite crowd...|`|qF1oQG7Xaa	Both had huge impacts, probably hulk had the biggest impact in his time, because in his time. He was the best, whilst stone cold had others like the rock in his generation. However, hulk was a giant for his time, but would he be classed as a jobber in todays wrestling world? Sure, he didn't have the greatest move set, and he may of been overrated, but he was the best at his time, And he held the WWE championship for years.|`|QouSk1E7aa	VINCENT KENNEDY MCMAHON, BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF THOSE GUYS WOULD HAVE BEEN CRAP WITHOUT HIM. VINCE MADE HULKAMANIA|`|EzazmdpZaa	Hulk Hogan|`|OfutBhxYaa	hulk hogan|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Hulk and Vince got wrestling to point that it could have a stone cold. Not really a great tech wrestler but had charisma to spare. Plus never seen a cartoon with stone cold in it.<br>  <br>  Congrats on getting the account back. Was pleasantly surprised to see that hogan avatar again.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I go with Hogan as the bigger superstar of the two. The Austin 3:16 era might have lasted longer had it not been for the fact of his injury suffered at the hands of Owen Hart at Summer Slam 1997. That piledriver really shortened Austin's stay in the wrestling ring. <br>  <br>  "Hulkamania" began in 1984 when he pinned the Iron Sheik after Sheik defeated Bob Backlund about a month before and it did not really end until 1992 when he wrestled Sid Vicious in Wrestlemania 8. He did come back, albeit briefly, and defeated Yokozuna in Wrestlemania 9 but he went over two months between Wrestlemania 9 and King of the Ring 1993 without defending his WWF World title and this may have disgusted a lot of fans. Hogan had the better and longer career on the sport of pro wrestling. He was a four-time WWF World Champion during his stay in the WWF from the 80's through the early 90's and headlined and main evented Wrestlemanias I-III and then V-VII which is a very remarkable feat indeed (He co-main evented Wrestlemania VIII with the Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair match). Hogan made WWF what is was during that time. Austin's career was cut short because of his injuries but he still had a great career but Hogan simply had the bigger impact.|`|3nN1vTTuaa	I want to say Stone Cold, because he was better wrestler. But Hulk Hogan did more for the sport than anyone could have. Hulk is a celebrity and drew many fans to the sport. <br>  <br>  That is kind of funny, i don't know why they would do that.|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Hogan was way bigger than Austin.  The problem is, that Austin was more recent, so more people remember  him.  WWE kind of portray's Hogan as a clown now-days, but he was bad-*** for quite a while.|`|AA11312903	Austin...while Hogan made wrestling a mainstream sport Austin (along with others) made it global sport that kids AND adults could enjoy...Hogan's gimmick was mainly aimed at kids...|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	the best answer is hulk hogan.

jaHYoyg6aa	Lift up big rocks?<br>  running MIGHT help somehow?<br>  Eat healthy?<br>  Push ups?<br>  lots of protein?|`|AA11312903	Lots of cardiovascular exercises like squats and sits jup and push ups might work... 9 times out of 10 though equipment will be required though...|`|PAhdlQ5eaa	just do like Hulk Hogan said "Eat your vitamins and drink your milk Brother!"<br>  <br>  The only thing really is pushups, situps, and squats.  But that's more just going to tone your muscles and not build a big amount of strength.  You need to hit the gym.|`|FPTgqmZLaa	Without equipment, probably cardio (like the other answer said) and conditioning.

xuNVegrGaa	first i love the legacy vs fathers idea very original but dusty rhodes is so out of shape it couldnt happen but it would be great if it did. The 4 championship matches and taker vs. HBK are all but confirmed to happen. But i would have christian fued with swagger and be in tht match rather then MITB.  I would go with the Rock instead of Stone Cold just because the Rock would be better to wrestle a match with stone cold's health. Big Show and Kane are not on the card.  They could make a good rivalry if worked on over time. they will have to fit big show somewhere because he is a huge part of smackdown now as being vickies "friend"  Also no jeff or matt hardy.  They will obviously have a match at WM 25, maybe ladders or TLC.  Great Card overall 9/10|`|zNajmAYFaa	Everything looks perfect, except MITB and United States Championship. The US title will be something different. That would be a great match, but, add Big Show in and it would be even better. MITB wont include Jimmy Wang Yang. Santino Marella doesnt seem to want to compete anymore. Everything else is classic!!!!!!! Randy vs. Triple H is like as big as Rock vs. Michaels or Michaels vs. Stone Cold. I know they have already gone at it before. But, a match at WrestleMania is different. There isnt no BS at WrestleMania!|`|uqlbt4vyaa	Rubbish card as the Bop Bop Bop is going 2 be in the main event with kane|`|Jq73KCL7aa	My name is Jack Swagger, and I am an All-American American|`|AA11312903	Wow they should make you head of WWE creative team...the MITB and the US Title matches are pretty much on the money...plus that fathers vs. sons storyline could go places...

lPDHMOVZaa	Vikings or Bills... any team that can lose the big dance 4 times and still not give up hope, deserves to finally "get over the hump". A Bills/Vikings Superbowl would be great to see.|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Deserves has nothing to do with it.  It is about earning.  But to try to answer you question, I would have to say the Cardinals.  They played good enough to win but the Steelers played two plays better (the interception run back and the last TD catch).  You could also make an argument for the Titans a few years ago and the Bills for all those straight Super Bowl appearances and still no ring.  Now if you asked which player deserves a ring, that list would be huge.|`|AA11369268	Comin from a Steelers fan, I'd actually have to go with the Browns.<br>  <br>  Browns fans are the most loyal to their team of any of the teams without a ring, and they are also the loudest fans who love their team the most.<br>  <br>  The Eagles don't at all because their fans are whining babies who threw snowballs at a Santa way back in the day.<br>  <br>  Bills or Vikings are good picks too since they both went to the Super Bowl 4 times and lost every time.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Eagles. They have made it to nfc championship several times but just can't seem to pull it off and make it to the big game. They're a good team and I would like to see Donovan Mcnabb win it.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	even though i hate them the eagles the last couple years they were so close and just dont win in the nfc champ game.|`|9048b8342cac419502141b2551de84ffaa	Texans|`|37964990822e94f29802880a94facc8daa	eagles|`|j6Qa4DbEaa	Eagles all the way baby!|`|Suo2siFDaa	Seahawks|`|XLXncQu9aa	The better question would be, "which team do we have the most pity on?"  I would have to say I have the most pity on the Lions since they went 0-16 this past season.  As far as who deserves a ring?  Honestly, none of those teams do.  The thing about the NFL is that championships are earned.  Do I feel bad for those teams that continuously play badly every year or the teams that get close but just can't hack it?  Yes.  I feel pity for them.  But it doesn't mean they deserve a ring. No one deserves anything.  Respect and championships are earned, not deserved.  If you play your best you will be the best.|`|jLnXuam7aa	Bills|`|HtYGxZcCaa	lol at what NJITB says<br>  <br>  Im going to say the Eagles they havent won since 1967 and McNabb has face tons of adversity. Theyve suffered so much and came so close-yet so far many teams. I think the Eagles deserve a ring to relieve them of there 40 years of misfortune|`|HNE7dJQiaa	Eagles Seahawks Chargers Titans Jaguars|`|wxXguyK3aa	Lions.<br>  Any team that goes 0-16 deserves a ring, they also deserve a hug.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	The Cards because they got screwed. I also can be biased and say my Saints.

3eDsHCTVaa	first of all, to see the most potential u need to have some strength in your legs similar to about being able to squat 1.5 times your body weight (ex: if u weigh 150lbs u should want to squat 225 or more).<br>  as for me i am 5'11, 7'8 reach, 165lbs, starting week 3 today feb 24, 09. so far have gained 2.5 inches and have a 18 inch vert, which equals to a 9'2" reach in the air. so adding 10 more inches (28" vert) is what i need to touch rim, so anything on top of that helps to develop dunking. i know i will be able to dunk with this program. i have no complaints as far as negative side effects. i do it in my garage on cement, and sometimes at my college wood floor. i also do weight training for legs on mondays: <br>  squats, *as of this date 200 lbs<br>  deadlifts, *225<br>  calf raises, *215<br>  leg curls, *105<br>  leg extensions, *115<br>  air alert helps me to jump quicker and more explosive, plus i am sprinting faster too which helps to get a step in front of a defender. plus after 2 weeks of air alert and weights, i can now do single leg squats.

439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	There is no conspiracy theory.<br>  <br>  The guy was out 8 months and he is still ranked number 1 in the world.  His wife delivered their second child in February, he stuck around for that.

qbQT7oMtaa	lakers will be tough to beat in the West though. Parker is playing great right now and I am sure they will reach the Western Finals.<br>  Manu has not been playing extremely well and the key for them to beat the Lakers would be for him to step up, which has not been the case the past 2 years. Let them rest Manu and then he can come back healthy and have a true impact on the playoffs. Last year, it was mostly Parker and Duncan, if the 3 of them are able to have a strong impact, they could beat the lakers in a 6-7 game series.<br>  In the East, Cleveland will take it but loose in the finals (again SA or LA)|`|hmrqHVtPaa	I won't be surprised when it happens, but these laker fans will be crying blowing  their tears on their panties, the lakers ain't even that good, their pansy a$$ fake defense will be exposed just like the suns in 2005 and 2007.<br>  <br>  Bandwaggoners give me all the thumbs downs you want, its the truth, I am  not sorry if it hurts that bad but all you bandwaggoners are nobody to be questioning the Spurs tradition of this decade.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	haha you obviously dont watch basketball with dumb comments like that!<br>  first of all the lakers aren't at full strength as well.<br>  we will get bynum back right before the playoffs. no one cant match up with the lakers now, just wait till we can move pau to the 4 spot. endless possibility's. 2nd the magic probably aren't gunna make it past the 2nd round.<br>  beating the blazers is much of an accomplishment.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	no the lakers and cavs r playing in the finals<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lakers in 7|`|50PfC3OIaa	Much like your Whitney avatar, you're probably on crack.<br>  <br>  edit: LOL!

T5UBrKZjaa	www.sportskool.com/softball is a website with FREE instructional videos by Coach Mike Candrea.

His record speaks for itself!!!<br>  <br>  I would study those videos and do the topics (hitting, throwing, catching,etc...) JUST LIKE in the videos. Besides performing, you need to be able to answer questions that you understand how to hit,catch & throw<br>  <br>  Talk trash about no one, whether to their face or behind their back. They always find out and if the coach finds out well.......<br>  <br>  You can get one of those orange traffic cones and maybe a few whiffle balls or nerf balls and practice hitting ( wiht nerf balls you can do it in your garage or basement.<br>  <br>  Finally, hustle for everything, let the coach know, BY YOUR ACTIONS, that you will do whatever it takes, play where ever he/she says, to help the team succeed. Saying it, is one thing, doing it is another.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TsRgRLuiaa	need to practice every chance you get....<br>  i just made the jv team and im a freshmen<br>  i've been playing for a while so just keep practicing and you will make it..<br>  hustle everywhere they tell you to go :) They love that lol|`|B46t8gkLaa	PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE. i know it sounds cliche but it's so true.|`|n3AeoyQvaa	roids are a good alternate to practice|`|s4VzPulYaa	Hey, I'm a sophmore and i'm going for varsity =D<br>  I ended up being pulled from jv to varsity my freshmen year, due to my passion for the game, and my will power to never be beat. <br>  my coach describes me as a raging pit bull trying to get off of the chain, so i guess whenever i think of that, it remindes me of how i'm supposed to play, veeeery aggresive, and like i love the game. <br>  You should do the same, that will get you much farther than anybody that had natural talent. heart and love is more important than all that other stuff.<br>  practicing goes with that easily, i love softball soo much that i spend nearly 2 hours a day practicing all by myself, then i go to my regular team practice.

I1w0HfQbaa	For the Mike Tyson fan in him why not buy him a boxing career DVD set of all of Mike Tyson's fights, professional and amateur? If that is too expensive for your wallet during this economic crunch, then ESPN released a Mike Tyson: Two Disc Knockout Edition available for about $22-25 depending on where you buy it. It features 19 of his fights, including his fight with Buster Douglas. It is available on Amazon.com and there are a lot of good reviews for it. I bought it myself and was satisfied with it. There was some editing in the Douglas fight but, for the most part, I enjoyed the set.<br>  <br>  Do not buy any cheap Mike Tyson DVDs for around $10 for you will be utterly disappointed with the editing and quality of the merchandise. For Muhammad Ali there is a website called customizedvds.com which sells various Ali fights, such as his trilogy with Ken Norton which will set you back $20; his last hurrahs with Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick which will be $15.00; his two fights with Floyd Patterson which is $15.00 amongst others. His career set is a little pricey so maybe try focusing on buying certain fights in his career. There are also websites like boxingwholesale and boxingheaven which will be willing to help you regarding your needs because Ali and Tyson are very popular career sets for their business.|`|y5CGdNpTaa	if he's a boxing fan I sure he would enjoy a good cigar to enjoy while he relaxes and takes in the fight. try <a href="http://www.cigarfox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cigarfox.com</a> they can deliver right to your door. great presentation and a unique gift idea|`|kBScgrVMaa	If he hasn't already got it, you could get him the dvd "champions forever", it features Muhammad Ali up close and personal just before Parkinson's really took a grip of the great man, filmed in 1988, Reggie Jackson done some brilliant footage along with awesome interviews. <br>  Champions forever, is an in-close look at 5 kings of the ring, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Ken Norton and Larry Holmes, all in the SAME ROOM together, never before seen, and never since!

Pvbb90guaa	A restricted free agent is a restricted free agent (RFA) is one with three accrued seasons of service, who has received a "qualifying" offer (a salary level predetermined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players) from his current club. He can negotiate with any club through a certain date. If the restricted free agent accepts an offer sheet from a new club, his old club has "right of first refusal," a seven-day period in which it may match the offer and retain him, or choose not to match the offer, in which case it may receive one or more draft picks for the upcoming draft from the player's new club. If an offer sheet is not executed, the player's rights revert to his old club the day after negotiations must end. And a free agent is a team player whose contract with a team has expired, and the player is able to sign a contract with another team if that player is chosen.|`|Xbn6jvnvaa	It really depends on the sport, but basically an restricted free agent is "a player is free to solicit offers from other teams for new contracts. However, before this player is allowed to sign with the new club, the current club has a chance to match (or come within 10% in some leagues) the terms of the new contract in which case the player must remain with the original team."  You can look at the Wikipedia article for more on the specific sport leagues.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	A restricted free agent can sign with another team to an offer sheet and the old team has 7 days to match it and keep the player.<br>  <br>  An unrestricted free agent can sign anywhere.

Ramirez will get you SB, Runs, HR, and RBI's.<br>  <br>  There's lots of good pitchers that can be taken later in the draft so don't waste your fist pick on a pitcher.

xhPKkkELaa	Welcome to surfing. This question has been asked enough times before, but there is really only one true answer.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers. There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.<br>  <br>  Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. At 6, you should be mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.Good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a><br>  <br>  (I'm a New Jersey surfer, mostly in Cape May and Atlantic counties.

Try it out for a few days until you are sure you like surfing. Then, you could get a longboard surfboard which is the easiest board to ride. 2-3 years later you can get a new board either a longboard or you can try a shortboard.

tFNSPLlFaa	Ge  a one or two inch bandage, wrap it round your head covering your ears then wrap insulating tape over that twice round. Look at bbcrugby.com six nations highlights to see how professionals do it. Not many props where headgear as it makes it difficult to hear and soon get pulled off. There,s a funny film of Danny Grewcock an English player getting mad and he pulled his own headgear off and ripped it up in front of the ref. He always was crazy. Stay low and bore in!|`|yBoRU10Paa	Rubbing your ear with his head?  Sounds like you've got a special admirer.|`|bLpNuvPiaa	Wear headgear.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia: Most common among amateur wrestlers, rugby players, mixed martial artists, and grapplers. If the external portion of the ear suffers a blow, a blood clot or other fluid may collect under the perichondrium. This separates the cartilage from the overlying perichondrium that is its source of nutrients, causing the cartilage to die. This leads to a formation of fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. When this happens, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.<br>  <br>  Headgear that protects the ears is worn in wrestling and rugby (where it is called a "scrum cap"), many martial arts, and other contact sports to help prevent this condition. For some wrestlers and fighters, however, a cauliflower ear is considered a badge of courage [1].|`|2xlCj4utaa	yes. get a scrumcap or if u cant afford it use normal strapping plaster

Orton may have wrestling "in his blood," but there must be something else in there blocking it from making it to the surface!<br>  <br>  Cena's got it all: he's got mic skills, ring skills, and most importantly, people respect John Cena.|`|lGIL36faaa	errrrr  becoz kids and adults have heard about  john cena more than randy and becoz cena gained alot of publicity and popularity wen he became the wwe champ like so many times! wich really was boring even tho i like him!|`|5xIroQjMaa	First off, it's not like Randy Orton is some wrestling god. He's a mediocre wrestler at best, that has yet to put on a match that impresses me. That's not to say that Cena is a great wrestler, but neither are very good. So if you like Randy for his wrestling skills, please stop deluding yourself. <br>  <br>  As far as their gimmicks go, it's a gimmick. If you're going to hate someone for portraying a thug, and embrace Orton for portraying a criminally insane man with a propensity for violence what does that say about you? Personally, I think Cena has about ten times Orton's mic skills, and since they're both bad wrestlers, I'd rather watch Cena cut a promo than Orton. Not that Orton is bad, he just isn't quite in Cena's league when it comes to getting behind a mic.|`|5lLLDK4Laa	Well first of all, since when did their looks matter? Second, i love john cena and randy orton both. And third, it's obvious why more people cheer for john cena. he's a face and people (especially kids) favor the good guys.|`|ePpkKhqTaa	well it is obvious since john cena has better fighting moves and style than randy Orton and because of randy Orton behavior i think he is losing many fans right now|`|qF1oQG7Xaa	Because Cena has so many younger fans, like under 12. Most of them are wannabe gangsters, and pretend to like his music so they seem cool at school!<br>  I prefer Randy though!|`|Xk0dp3YXaa	Honestly I don't like either of them. Not because of wrestling skills, not because of their fanbase. I just don't like them.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	because Cena is the good guy. why do u think Hulk Hogan was so popular?|`|BwhMgmxFaa	caus they both sucksn fedfgodsnsonngds
JDuEuPM4aa	It's all fan reaction for a show such as RAW or a PPV ... Smackdown on the other hand does sound out heavy boos sometimes or cheers but there's never any added heat or an added pop.<br>  <br>  The fan reaction is very important cause the WWE needs to know if a wrestler is getting over with the crowd or if a feud is being enjoyed etc etc ... so all of this centers from the crowds reaction of it ... if they added in sound for wrestlers then there would be no need for Cena to say things like 'whether you love me or hate me' or the controversy surrounding his crowds reactions sometimes because it would all be completely false and the fans opinions wouldn't matter.|`|5xIroQjMaa	They've had matches where heels were cheered, faces booed. Particularly in England and Canada. The fan reactions are important as a gauge to a wrestlers popularity, and like it or not Cena is popular, and with more than just kids. Just realize that people aren't going to agree with you, and your opinion is not always the majority. On top of that, his sales support the cheers. He's a top draw for a reason. And it's cool not to like him, just don't act so surprised that others do. For my part, I can't understand why Shawn Michaels or Ric Flair ever got over.|`|qbEeecndaa	no they do not have cheers or boos over their speakers. it would not happen|`|FdNYv4D9aa	There have been MANY instances at both the LIVE Raws and the PRETAPED Smackdowns when WWE have PIPED IN cheers and boos for their major stars, in order to get them over with the TV fans. If you sometimes read the fan reports online, whether it's from Raw or Smackdown, it's ALWAYS a case where a superstar (in whatever city) was HEAVILY cheered or HEAVILY booed in the arena, even though it seems to come across as a fraction of that on TV to us....the weekly viewers. This is mainly true for somebody like John Cena, who's still often heavily booed in some cities (way more so than what we hear on TV)...and even HHH, who's also booed a lot in some cities (versus the immense cheers we hear)...or even somebody who we THINK is getting a nice face pop, but in the arena...NO reaction whatsoever!|`|SXRdNW80aa	I was at Raw in Nashville this week, and there was no "pipeing in" reactions at that show. That's not to say that it doesn't happen, because it does. However, the boos you may have heard any time John Cena was on screen were soley from me. :)|`|zNajmAYFaa	Uhhh there is like 17,000 fans in the arena each week for a show. I think they dont need speakers for that. People like to join in on boos so they dont look like a idiot. Good way to not get into a fight if ya ask me lol

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It's basically Y2J doing a great job on Raw by effectively and successfully working his heel gimmick.For me Chris Jericho is a legend of the Attitude Era and one of the most talented in WWE.He works an excellent style of technical Lucha Libre wrestling and puts  on exciting matches and entertaining promos and segments.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chris-jericho-tribute/1739721421/?icid=VIDURVENT10" rel="nofollow">http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chr...</a>|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	You see him as a grade a jackass in his current storyline, that's good, that's what the writers want you to think.

ujMsLUcNaa	I think it's fair to say that Jordan Farmar has paid his due. He has played behind Kobe long enough, and now it's time for him to inherit the throne and move into the spotlight. The starting 5 has enough firepower to start the game but the 2nd unit needs that spark that Kobe can deliver, much similar to what he provided for the U.S.A. Olympic team. Jordan Farmar will make a fine backcourt mate next to Derek Fisher and I bet it won't be long before Phil Jackson proclaims Farmar as "the best Jordan I have ever coached". The Lakers need to show JF that they're committed to him before his 3 year contract expires this summer. I don't think they could afford to let Farmar pull off a Kobe and jump across town to join the Clippers. That would be a huge blow to the organization.<br>  <br>  Dallas is already feeling the burn from trading a young phenom in Devin Harris for veteran Jason Kidd. It won't be long before the Lakers experience the same dilemma. It may be time to trade Kobe and let Farmar thrive, similar to how Cleveland had to trade Ricky Davis so they could develop LeBron. I know it sounds like a 2 steps back 1 step forward move but it must be done. Jordan Farmar will be the face of the Lakers in a few years. It's inevitable that all the former Kobe fans on this site will be comparing the 2 Jordan's on a daily basis and somehow, miraculously cook up some false sense of reasoning in their aspirations to prove that Farmar is the better Jordan. It should be one mass hysteria, I tell you.|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	IDK really... It worked for D- Wade during the olympics and kobe's body will get a lil bit preserved...

ElH6jMEXaa	I think its an extremely critically asset - the ability to take a punch can't really be overstated in a sport where the essence of it is to punch and take punches.<br>  <br>  Beyond the simplistic, the ability to shake off big shots is paramount in a fighters ability to adapt and survive in situation where other might not.  <br>  <br>  You're point is accurate in that boxers without "great" chins can have very successful careers, but so can fighters who are not "great" punchers, or who don't have "great" speed, or even don't have "great" technique - it doesn't make the chin anyless critical as those elements.<br>  <br>  Mickey Ward wasn't going to outslick anyone, he was going to have to eat punches in order to impose his attack, this is true for hundreds of fighters - they have to utilize their natural build in order to be effective.  <br>  <br>  The truth is, some guys just take a punch better than others, just like some guys are faster than others - I think the ability to take shots is right up there with natural speed and power as far as its importance in boxing.|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	a boxers chin isnt even concidered an aspect|`|kBScgrVMaa	A boxers chin isn't overrated. The boxers you named were devastating punchers, you will usually find KO hitters can't take shots, whereas Light punchers can go the distance with killer punchers. <br>  <br>  It's a funny ol' game, and I think it just depends on the calibre and the training a fighter has had for a particular fight. <br>  <br>  How did Frazier and Norton beat Ali, then both get KO'd in two rounds by Foreman, before Foreman lost by KO to Ali? <br>  <br>  It's all about skill, training, game-plan and timing of the fight, plus the sheer will to win.<br>  <br>  Chin comes into it, but with the right training, the chin can be untouched, just look at Floyd Mayweather, when was the last time he got "Chin-Checked"?|`|AA12325046	I wouldn't say that it's exactly underrated as it's helped many a fighter have great careers because of their ability to take a good shot like Marciano, Greb, Hagler etc.  But as you said, they can still have good or even great careers such as Terrry Norris, Ken Norton, Floyd Patterson, and Thomas Hearns so yes they certainly can compete on world class level even without iron chins, but just think how good they may have been had they had strong chins.

Anyways for what ever reason he stuck around for the race, after it was over I managed to grab a used tire from another team to get him to sign it.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	No, that leaves taxpayers to subsidize 29 other franchises. With the Yotes bleeding money and Phoenix likely holding out hope that new ownership can find a way to keep them in town that seems to be the motivation here (plus they cant pay the bills anyways). The city still makes money on parking, fans spending time around the arena eating, shopping and otherwise dropping their dime so while maybe not right it still provides income on many different levels. At different times other struggling franchises in all the major sports have needed the help of their city to cut their losses and often it paid off with the rebound of the franchise and longterm influxes of cash for their city. As an older Red Wings fan I recall the 1970's before Joe Louis Arena was built, the old Olympia stadium was a dump of a barn and fans were as scarce as wins (and wins didnt happen often back then). The city stepped in and even the auto industry did, they gave away tickets, they gave away new cars and eventually the city got repaid when Illitch bought the team and went about spending major money to entice fans back (and the Joe was built). Winning cures most of what ails any city and the brass in Phoenix are likely hopeful the kids are close to being contenders and new ownership will both keep them there and spend the money to build a winner.|`|795nSfFiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Under that theory every team should be raising season ticket prices 3.5% and charging 6.50 a beer and hold exactly 18532 people in the arena and ... Well you get the point. Every team has a deal worked out with a local arena, No two teams have the exact same deal. I think its kinda nice that the city is trying to help out he team, or rather some private investor which ever the case may be.<br>  <br>  Good Bye|`|AA11674745	No.<br>  <br>  If a team needs such help then more power to them.

CBVlu3Gvaa	Not to rain on your parade....but even I can spin a ball.  63 yr old.....It is nothing more nor less than a proper ball strike with a descending blow delivered by a club with clean sharp grooves.  The spin is generated by good ball striking....there is no magic....no trick clubs involved.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	yeah, it can be done but takes a lot of practice to be able to do it on command.  And when the pros do it, the condition of their greens is 10 times better than anything you or I get to play on.|`|prahKrpjaa	Every time you see someone take a divot after hitting the ball, they are "hitting down" on the ball.  All it means is that the clubhead is still travelling towards the ground when impact occurs.<br>  <br>  Whether or not the ball spins back depends on the trajectory, clubhead speed, green conditions, and amount of spin placed on the ball.  In addition, the type of ball has a large influence on spin rate.  If you're hitting top flites, they're not going to spin as much as Pro V1s.<br>  <br>  As far as equipment goes, the only thing "different" is that a pro's equipment is always pretty new.  Their groove are fresh, and that helps a ton, but it certainly IS standard equipment.<br>  <br>  I also think that you don't notice the ball spinning back as much from the point of view of from the fairway compared to what you see on TV.|`|nkPMesJdaa	Its all about the angle of approach for the club head into the ball. With the proper swing, you could make a wood sit and spin. Clean grooves have nothing to do with it either, although, clean grooves enhance the spin. Try taking a wedge, any one, and take a back swing. On the down swing, make an effort to hold the rear shoulder back. Swing the club head past the body before you allow your body to turn through the shot. DO NOT SCOOP IT. DO make a conscious effort to make your divot in front of the ball. It will take practice. Try it, you'll like it.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	i could spin the ball even when i was of a 20 handicap.<br>  <br>  some really good 0-1 hcp players, would not be scooping it, they would be hitting down and through. you do need a relatively fresh newish wedge.<br>  <br>  you do need a soft golf ball as well, pro v 1 or srixon zurc.|`|21XwrcP9aa	Of course it can. Its not possible with every green in the world though. If you have a very firm and fast green the ball wont bite (spin back). On a good couse with good contact you can make a 7 iron spin backwards.|`|k0vXGlNAaa	hitting down on the ball works and you don't need any fancy clubs or anything. try moving the ball a half inch or less back in your stance and keep your swing the same. I hit down on the ball really well and i get some great back spin.

WnTHyxAiaa	heavy weights build muscle mass and strength.  light weights biuld muscle firmness, tightness, shape, and add more cardio.<br>  <br>  i would recommend doing 1 part heavy, and 3 parts light.  <br>  example.<br>  <br>  but remember, work out your whole body not just the biceps.

hMkb7H31aa	Usually, like during inter-league and World Series games, if the home team is in the AL, the DH is used by both teams.  If the home team is in the NL, the DH is not used.  <br>  <br>  However, in Spring Training games, if an NL team, as the home team, agrees to use the DH vs an AL or an NL team, then the DH will be used by both teams.  Use of the DH gives batters more game experience regardless of AL or NL.

I1w0HfQbaa	I think there will be a lot of controversy if she is chosen as a pick. She is seen, specifically by Sports Illustrated writers Rick Reilly, as an opportunist who cashed in on her father's fame and name recognition. Also, female boxing is considered a distant second and inferior to male boxing. I read and am a fan of boxing and I do not watch much or pay attention to women boxing. There will be quite a bit of bad blood if she gets puts on a postage stamp. Muhammad Ali may be a safer bet for your class project. <br>  <br>  If you want to do a project with an African American boxer I think Floyd Patterson might also be a good pick as would be Joe Louis. They would be good nominations to be put on a stamp. In response to your question, then no I do not think she would be a good choice for a postage stamp. Cashing in on daddy's name and beating up tomato cans which would make Peter McNeely's manager Vince Vecchione green with Irish envy does not warrant one's face on a stamp.|`|IH6Wlmqsaa	Richard Pryor would be a better choice. Does Ms. Ali really deserve to get a stamp?|`|kBScgrVMaa	Why have you chosen Laila? Because of her father? <br>  <br>  If it weren't for the great Muhammad Ali, the world would never had heard of Laila, and she would never had laced on the gloves, what exactly has she done to warrant a stamp mark??<br>  <br>  If the question said Muhammad on a stamp, now there's a more genuine question!|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	I could be wrong but I thought only people who have passed on are put on stamps.  I can't think of ANY reason Laila Ali would be put on a stamp.  The list of people who are more deserving would run the rest of our lives.<br>  <br>  Someone mentioned Joe Louis.  I think it's safe to say Im sure Louis has already been "Stamped".  If not then something is VERY wrong................<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...........with EVERYTHING<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ............In                         life|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	There is no good reason to put her on a stamp.  You should have chose someone else because you are not going find any good reasons to put her on a stamp.  No offense but you  picked a non deserving person to be honored.  What about Oprah?

faIU064Saa	You sir need to explain the number of teams in your league, and the type of league that you have. If it is a keeper league then Hanley Ramirez will be great for years to come and will get you points in all categories in a 5x5 league. If you only get to keep him for a year and you are in 5x5 then A-Rod makes more sense. He is in a well-protected lineup and will get his chances being protected by Yanks rather than Marlins. If you are in a points league that values home runs and RBI's etc. then Pujols is a monster, and always has been. Explain yourself, and maybe you'll get better answers.|`|PLSC6Hjqaa	Pujols. Very consistent and I believe there is too much going on around A-Rod. Hanley won't have the same year although he is a solid choice as well. I would kill to have first pick and every time it would be Pujols. Plus Pujols is a hot commodity so good trades could come your way.|`|omqQHSUlaa	Take Hanley he is the best all around player <br>  he gives you HRs, RBIs, SBs, he also has a nice AVG<br>  Pujols i think is the most likely to get injured out of the three<br>  A-Rod i don't recommend because he only gives you HRs|`|fudmYesMaa	Pujols for sure.  Over the past 5 years, he has consistently been the best fantasy player out there.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Whatever you do don't take A-Rod cuz he underachieves in the post season, Take Hanley or Pujols. One of those two.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	if possible i would maybe trade down in the draft (if possible) i have a feeling that people will back off of drafting Arod early b/c of the whole steroid thing.....although i think he has 10+ years straight of 30hrs....so Arod is a pretty safe bet to get you at least 30 hr, 100 rbi.  If you do end up at the #1 spot.  I would probably go with Hanley Ramirez, as he is a 5 tool player.  He helps in basically all offensive categories, avg, hr, rbi, runs, steals.  Pujols will have a better average, but does not run nearly as well as Hanley does.  Not to mention you could get a good 1b and 3b later in the draft.

sBrYcT5daa	I don't see much change in the standings happening, so I go with:<br>  <br>  EAST<br>  <br>  Cavs, Celtics, Magic, Hawks, Heat, 76ers, and two out of Bulls, Pistons and Bucks<br>  <br>  <br>  WEST<br>  <br>  Lakers, Spurs, Nuggets, Rockets, Blazers, Jazz, Mavs and one out of Hornets and Suns|`|plFyCtm3aa	Right now it could be anyone... <br>  <br>  But the Cavs, Celtics, Lakers, Orlando, and San Antonio are making it for sure.<br>  <br>  The rest is a little subjective because we have a lot of battles going on right now.|`|HiuNSScLaa	Miami Heat|`|Y7cZC9KYaa	The good teams|`|AvxMhVGmaa	I know the Spurs will for sure, just like they have in the past 15 seasons!|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Cavs <br>  Celtics<br>  Hawks<br>  Magic<br>  Heat<br>  Knicks<br>  Pistons<br>  Don't know|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	i think the inal four will be cavs spurs lakers celtics|`|ONrFDcUTaa	i agree with what nickname|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i cant tell all but i got one the heat from the east are going to the playoffs who agrees who does thumps up you dont thumps down|`|WZvny7mMaa	East<br>  1.

EKF2HdZKaa	people just hate em cause they are winners........|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Simple: They are haters, can't accept the 3rd best team in the league. The ESPN sports personals are dumb honestly they know nothing about sports with the acceptation of a few. All they do is present things that have already happened. Spurs will be good for the next 5 years guaranteed and people can't accept the best franchise in the past decade.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	NOBODY has said that they won't make the playoffs. Stop putting words in people's mouth.<br>  <br>  Sure, some people think they are boring.. who cares? I don't think they are boring. As far as I'm concerned, they are the second best team in the West.|`|ZSAVHC84aa	I mean, they're not an explosive fun team, I'm not a fan but they sure do win a lot. That's all that matters, right? They don't play to make people happy, they play to win.|`|dWX9xM0caa	cuz its true|`|JgAE7eV9aa	I am not a Spurs fan but I am not a hater also. The spurs are being critize because they are boring through the eyes of some viewers. And the NBA fans only cares about exciting teams and players. I believe that a team or a player can can be so dominant (like the Spurs) but if they are not entertaining people will just say that they are a waste of time.|`|Qyk0Rdu5aa	Cuz their boring, their old, not making the playoffs|`|c3tADklmaa	If they're so old, how come they're this good?
qhTxeSnbaa	IDK. I think that was just for Khali to get popularity. I didn't work for me.

He may start doing it again if WWE doesn't get any other ideas for him.|`|lGIL36faaa	no thank god|`|ImOcVhwLaa	Maybe the do it like during commericals when Superstar don't wrestle?|`|1JywgkyMaa	i thought you hated wrestling,rooker|`|Q1MI6L96aa	It mercifully has ended.|`|iOICjcZcaa	Didn't you just ask a question saying all wrestling fans are ugly?<br>  <br>  To answer your question, no. They started that just to give Khali a face push. They knew it could easily get stale and damage Khali's gimmick, so they just kind of dropped it.
1WBgYZYbaa	You can just put his name in all capital letters. <br>  <br>  If you are a major fan of Punk you can put I LOVE C.M.Punk (I did that one at the last Raw event in my area which was the 800th eppisode!<br>  <br>  GO C.M.

P93I8CHtaa	celtics|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i guess celtics|`|qlaZpHnPaa	The Celtics, I hope he ruins their team.|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	Well he can go destroy the Celtics but IF there's a team he should be or fit in, it will be the Warriors or the Rockets... U might think that I'm crazy for saying the Rockets but Yao Ming can't  carry a team through the playoffs... You're probably saying that so is Stephon but Steph can actually do something... Slashing to the paint is the exact playing style Yao needs to help him elevate his game... But this will only work if Steph will be a willing passer that I think he will coz of what happened to him in NY... I know for a fact that Artest and Steph will get into each others nerves but I think that they will cooperate. They matured so much and I think that they will learn how to do it... The coach's way... And the Rockets should release T- Mac coz even if he gets back he will just hurt the team in both ends...|`|WZvny7mMaa	Most likely he will head to Boston. Although I think he is going to ruin their team chemistry.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Go?!?! He's already went! He's playing for the Boston Celtics. I smell another title! LOL|`|mwxKnUleaa	I think the team most likely to take a chance on him are the Celtics.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Boston fosho|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	Celtics|`|hLjr2UUFaa	Celtics|`|TNN6U75Maa	this year boston, next year Greece.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	ORLANDO|`|sj8EM9ejaa	ya me 2 celtics
83ebpB19aa	Mamba is not the most biased Laker fan on here.

I don't think he is the most biased Laker fan here.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Why are you always getting in people's buissness?|`|1f60cd236744da3f80d9d6fa54fe4bfcaa	idgaf|`|ZdNSSm0waa	You need a hobby

I would just type golf North and or South Carolina/golf in a yahoo or google search bar and just take things from there.<br>  Also search golf magazine on the web and I bet you can find out about lots of places.
UMVWQiYJaa	21.2 ppg, 4.2 asts, 5.6 rbs, 1.7 stls, fg% 52.7<br>  <br>  James Harden, not sayin he should win it, but consider.|`|jSk6PjAPaa	i like the way ty plays but he cant beat blake and if he did beat blake he wouldnt be able to beat tyler hansbourogh.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah good season for Ty but Blake will win.|`|eF60R7DPaa	Tar Heels SUCK!!!!!!!!|`|mwxKnUleaa	Yeah but he is probably not going to get the most votes among his team|`|xWGJHMkuaa	22 Points<br>  13.8 rebounds<br>  63% from the field<br>  <br>  there is no debate, it will be Griffin and it will be unanimous. It doesn't matter that he is a foot taller because he is playing against guys that are also a foot taller. height has nothing to do with anything. You're obviously a tarheel fan.
d62609feeef052232f9aa56525f7e0bfaa	It's so sad, I liked the Pistons too, but that Billups trade really messed them up, and now with the trade deadline gone they will just be the same. Iverson was supposed to help, but I guess not. Playoffs is a little hard to picture this year for them. There's time to rebuild in the off season.|`|NkIUVDZgaa	probabobly playoffs but they wont keep up the six straight times to confrence final ai is so used to being the only star like in philly in denver melo was the star but in detroit you have hamilton,prince,wallace,and stuckey so every one needs touches hes also used to not everyone shooting in the starting lineup|`|E3KTxCksaa	most likely they will finish anywhere between 6-8th seed in the East, thus making the playoffs, in my opinion it was a bad idea to trade away billups, billups is more of a team player and makes other players better around him compared to A.I.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	Yeah... but they will be in the bottom half. maybe 5th or 6th. Even if they are playing bad right now, the other teams in the East are also bad. I agree that they will exit at the first round. they'll be luck to move to the 2nd round but they will not reach the conference finals.|`|5a16b1497fd05d47f5d38ed5213418c7aa	This is the time for detriot to step it up however if they keep losing games like they been doing they won't make the playoffs.|`|gQynVSUGaa	I dont know if they will make the playoffs. Ever since Iverson was on Detroit, they have played much worse than they used to. 80% chance.|`|xOvMH412aa	I think they will end up w/ a record worse than Charlotte Bobcats|`|GswnLKtQaa	they are probably going to be at 7th or 8th seed by the way they are playing now. actually I thought the pistons will make a run after the all-star break I guess i'm wrong.<br>  <br>  If they fight the Magic they might have a chance considering they beat them last time. but if the Cavs they are in serious trouble.|`|VHphDgrhaa	No they won't make it just like you said they have gaven up for some reason. <br>  BQ: miss playoffs or barely make it with the worst seed.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	I dont know|`|vFbzBo4eaa	If they keep like this no but if they start to play really serious then maybe they will have a chance<br>  BQ:We will see|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Probably not.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	yea
6S8KjBLQaa	Um Franklin would be James Blake (both black)<br>  Lucy would be Justine Henin (mean girl)<br>  Sally would be Svetlana (so sweet)<br>  LOL Peppermint Patty has to be someone manly like Amelie Mauresmo (with her bff Marcie as Nathalie Dechy)<br>  Charlie Brown is Roddick (will never have it easy)<br>  Fed can be Snoopy, Woodstock Rafa...<br>  Pig Pen is Murray..|`|92Pa1cpcaa	I would make federer, schroeder, because they are both virtuosos; then i would make roddick, snoopy ,because he is cool; and I'd make djokovic, shermy because sometimes you like him and sometimes you don't.

Eventually there will be a Triple Threat match for the WWE championship it will probally be Edge vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy with Jeff Hardy winning the WWE championship again and Matt will apoligize.|`|JmK3Bgdyaa	He was jealous of jeff hardy getting all the attention,winning everything and stuff like that.<br>  It's part of the smackdown story line.<br>  They're still gonna be The Hardy Boyz,brothers and best friends. :)|`|sh01nOWCaa	Because that was the storyline that they came up with DUH!
kqP7GwOcaa	Actually I think Rocky Marciano is the most UNDER rated heavyweight champion in the history of boxing, Rock doesn't really get the credit he deserves because he was physically a small heavyweight, and people tend to think the bigger fighters have a significant, even overwhelming size advantage, which is not always the case.   If Marciano would have fought Liston, Rock would have knocked Sonny out in a more convincing manner than Ali did.<br>  <br>  Truth be told Marciano would have exposed Tyson faster than Douglas or Holyfield did an Mike wouldn't have lasted more than 4 or 5 rounds with Rock before Tyson got KOed.  Character plays a huge role in the effectiveness or a heavyweight boxing champion, and Tyson doesn't even belong in the same sentence with the likes of Marciano, Ali, Louis or Jack Johnson, let alone the same ring.<br>  <br>  No Marciano isn't over rated, but Tyson most certainly was.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Even if he had one loss people would know who he was, that is boxing people would. We remember lots of good boxers that were not undefeated.<br>  I don't think he was over rated, and in fact feel he is under rated because people are always talking about the great people he beat were past their primes.<br>  It is not his fault that they may or may not have been in their prime, he fought all of the great fighters and won.<br>  Tyson is the one who is over rated. He would not have done well against most of the great fighters in history, he came along at a fortunate time, he would not have beaten Ali, Foreman, and probably not Frazier.<br>  His flaws were exposed and he melted down fast, when confronted by people who did not fear him.<br>  Marciano, like Tunney made their money and retired before they lost their brains and health, which means they were smarter than many boxers.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	no he came around at the right time|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Despite what happened to Liston in his second fight with Ali, Liston had a good chin.  He was never hit with any power like what Marciano had.  Who knows what would have happened had they met.  Marciano was as well conditioned an athlete that there has been.  He possessed strong punching power and had the heart of a champion.  He was overrated as a highly skilled  boxer which he was not.  He made up for it big time in the attributes mentioned above.  He was matched with a highly skilled boxer Ezzard Charles in their first fight together.  Charles was ahead on points going into the late parts of the fight.  Charles tired out and Marciano scored enough points to win.  He may have lacked the boxing skill but he never lost a fight.|`|R0J1W3BCaa	"A prime Mike Tyson would have crushed Marciano like a bug" LMAO|`|AA12325046	Mike Tyson was crushed by an average Buster Douglas and lost to Kevin MCBride so he may be the most overrated of all time.  It takes more than muscle to be a great champ.  You have to have mental toughness and heart and Mike did not.  Rocky won them all despite handicaps and Joe Walcott WAS THE CHAMP when they fought so he was in his prime.  Rocky never wanted to fight Louis.  Nobody ever mentions Tyson fighting 38 year old Larry Holmes now do they who was more past his prime than Louis.  I know you already have your mind made up so it makes no difference what others believe anyway.  Marciano fought from 47-55 and beat people regularly that were much larger because of endurance and will.  Yeah he beat Archie Moore who was the #1 ranked contender after beating 6'3 220 lb Nino Valdez to earn the shot and was champ another 7 years after that so hardly past his prime either.  Funny people don't say Bernard Hopkins who is 42 is past his prime now do they?  And Tyson beat a scared Michael Spinks who was the Lgt Heavy champ too and a bunch of tomato cans too or didn't you know that?  And finally who did Tyson ever beat that is in the Boxing Hall of Fame?  As you see sir, I back up what I say with facts.  Long live the memory of Rocky Marciano a great champ and a class act.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Marciano isn't overrated,he did fight good competition at the end of his career and not just Louis,Walcott,and Charles.He did beat an old Louis and Walcott was up there in age also but he was a better fighter later in his career.Walcott was winning convincingly in the first fight he got caught a that was it.In the second fight Marciano knocked out Walcott in the 1st round.Ezzard Charles had Marciano beat but feared finishing guys off because he killed a guy in a match years earlier and was never the same.He became a much more conservative fighter and hesitated to finish guys after that.Rocky's corner knew this and in the second fight with the fight in danger of being stopped because of a nasty gash on Marciano's nose they told him to "go out there and beat him because he ain't going to finish you".I agree that Liston would have killed him but Tyson would have had a little more trouble.You can't question Marciano's heart or take too much away from his accomplishments,he is a legit top 10 heavyweight.If you want overrated just look at Ali.|`|DpPVA3oiaa	I would not say he is over rated he beat the people he had to beat at the time . I have watched a lot of Rocky`s fights he was nothing more than a slugger and we all know what happens to sluggers and I only have one word for them it`s Ali . Joe Frazier George Forman Sonny Liston     get my point. Could Rocky have knocked out a Mike Tyson only after Cu`s died Rocky was very slow had a great heart and remember Rocky`s chin was not as great as his heart was is Rocky one of the top Ten heavy weights of all time NO but he was one of the best in his time.|`|AA11884987	I agree so much dude you have no idea. people always want to believe old fighters are better than fighters today. A guy like Lennox lewis would have killed marciano and i mean that literally. Lewis has like what 6 inches on him in height like probably a foot in arm reach, 40 pounds plus on him and a lot stronger. Lennox would have anihilated him.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i think he is very underrated actually!

You might also consider taking him out to the range with you and showing him how the gun functions. My dad took me for the first time when I was 8 and I loved it.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to show him by example and constantly reinforce the basics. <br>  <br>  The NRA has a series of programs, books, and videos geared towards kids called Eddie Eagle that takes a Sesame Street approach to gun safety.

Try to go out with the rest of the swimmers in your heat and then try and pull ahead of them on the 2nd 100. After this, just try to keep that same pace. Try to breath every three or five strokes, and not breath into your turns, off of your turns, or going into the finish.|`|dMmeVi5zaa	The key thing here is to pace yourself and be consistent.

GgVufxlHaa	If you want to improve, focus on a certain skill set first. Take it a step at a time. If you're a hitter, see where you're most comfortable hitting from- middle, weak or power. To improve on your hitting, try hitting a volleyball against the side of your house or other wall to work on your control. To work on blocking, ask a friend or coach to hit from the other side so you can work on adjusting yourself to the different hits.<br>  If you're more of a back row passer, focus more on that first. Get a friend to hit balls to you and try to return them with as much accuracy as possible. Once you're good in one area, expand and begin working on other areas of your game. Ask a coach to help you learn proper technique first, though, so you don't learn the wrong way to hit or pass because it'll make it much more difficuly later. <br>  This is a pretty good instructional video to get you started:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQqmyfppu2w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQqmyfppu...</a><br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|jSc9sI6faa	Here are a few tips for volleyball skills:<br>  <br>  >When passing the ball; make a table with your arms, keep your bottom below the ball, and point your thumbs to the floor.<br>  >Wherever your shoulders point, that is where the ball is going.

You don't want him to be showing too much power yet. If he is accurate and can make good contact with the ball than yes. Power is better to develop around high school.

Also run track and work with the sprint coaches on your form - you may want to get myosource bands for increased running resistance.  <br>  <br>  For sprinting you should be doing 50 meter sprints along with running hill sprints for conditioning.  Your really don't need to do sprints longer than 100 yards since that's the longest you can make a play in football however if you like it's good to run aerobic miles before and after your sprints for instance 1 mile.  Run with the football and get used to running laterally and practicing your juke moves.  Good luck!|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	go to a speed camp|`|NK6AtTWBaa	speed workouts.  i dont know anything about your current status but i recomend the following: 10-15 wind sprints a day the length of the field with 30 second recovery time in each endzone between reps.  <br>  3-4 reps of a 400 meter sprint at an all out pace.  1 for 1 rest time. (if it takes you 60 seconds, rest 60 seconds)<br>  when you want to push it go for the hardest workout i do:find a track.  do an 800 meter at a fast pace (not all out) after completing that, don't stop inbetween reps, but the second rep should be much slower (60 seconds or so) do 5 reps. (3 fast 2 slow. with the slow one's inbetween each fast rep.)  <br>  <br>  i would do the first one every day and then rotate the other two out every other day.  ex. do 400 meter workout on wednesday, then the 800 on friday, then 400 on sunday etc.hope this helps.  best of luck to you and your goal.|`|PEvoumoZaa	i can guarantee you that if you workout your legs (such as quads, hamstring, and your calves) and your arms you will become a much faster athlete.

There is an arm which rotates (from memory) a mechanism which then clamps the top & bottom of the brace firmly on to the racket.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	There are two kinds of braces, one that's wooden that fits entirely around the racket then screws down at each corner, the second is a metal brace that is shaped like an X that clamps at four points on the racket frame with one screw in the middle.  The braces can be adjusted slightly to fit better though all wood rackets are approximately the same dimensions.  I'd make the X brace if I were you because it is alot easier to design and simply has one screw in the center to tighten all four corners.  Not sure the exact dimensions but if the corners of the X can touch the racket frame simultaneously, you'll know its the right size.
km9cQNAXaa	Have a look at the Colt Diamondback or Colt Python. Choose depending on whether you prefer a single or double action.<br>  <br>  I would avoid the very short barrel versions. For hunting accuracy is paramount and I would go for the 6 inch barrel. You should be able to find a good used example within your budget.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The two (2*) Best ones are the Smith &Wesson or Ruger.*|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Someone suggested either a Colt Python or Colt Diamondback.  Both of these are double action and both are out of production.  The Python is normally a .357 Magnum that also shoots .38s but there is a .38 Special only Python that is pretty rare.  The Diamondback was only chambered in .38 Special and .22 Long Rifle.  Both the Python and Diamondback are high dollar guns when you can find them on the used gun market.<br>  <br>  Consider the Ruger GP-100 or SP-101 depending on whether or not you need a full size one or compact.  S&W offers several models in .357 Magnum but they are higher dollar than the Ruger.  The Model 686 is probably the best S&W .357 Magnum revolver currently in production.<br>  <br>  H|`|QNX9NET3aa	You are in luck. Many people prefer the semi-auto handgun. This makes revolvers less in demand and cheaper for you. The Ruger GP-100 is a fine sturdy gun. Anything from Smith&Wesson or Colt would be a good choice as well. For target shooting and hunting try to find one with atleast a 6" barrel and adjustable sights. Some of the best bargains IMHO are late model .38 special revolvers. True they can't shoot .357 magnums but they can shoot .38 special+p ammo. and that is a little more powerful than .38 special. You need to handle the guns and find one that just feels right.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	The Ruger GP100 is a great choice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/SearchResults.asp?SearchType=0&Keywords=gp100&Page=1&Items=50" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/SearchR...</a>|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I think you should buy a S&W

jSkHquK5aa	Progressive Interval Conditioning is the key to increasing stamina for cardio-intensive sports like soccer, basketball and hockey. These constant motion sports require incredible stamina for running, sprinting, back-stepping and passing. The explosive power needed for shots-on-goal means that stamina training is imperative to be successful in these aerobic sports.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Speed Intervals. Jogging with intervals of sprinting. You can do these in a linear fashion, like on a treadmill (3-4mph jog, 5-6mph sprint). An alternative is to conduct them on a field or court. Divide the distance into quarters. Jog to the first mark, sprint back to the start, jog to the second mark sprint back to the start, etc. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Intensity Intervals. Hills or stairs are the best way to increase lower body intensity. Work on the explosive nature of your sport by alternating sprints uphill with jogs on the downhill. This will also shift your heart zone training between anaerobic (80-90%MHR) and aerobic (70-80%MHR) zones. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Progressive Multiplier. Increase training in three dimensions one at a time: time, quantity, and distance. After three training increases, do a low impact training on the fourth. Focus on fundamentals and form.|`|vyGyLV7paa	try running long distances, about 4 miles each time, every other day|`|OjYCej45aa	I'm in Australia so I don't know if you can buy this where you are, it's a product called VIG you can buy it at the chemist, it's 100% legal, it increases blood pressure which will reduce fatigue. The problem is that it can give asthmatics the symptoms of asthma, but take two puffs of your inhaler when you take the VIG and another two puffs just before tryout. <br>  P.S. I also have asthma and this is what the doctor told me. But I recommend you see the doctor for yourself, this may not be ok for your condition.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck|`|zqRwDnJvaa	try just warming up first and running for long periods of time. You could try drinking energy drinks before but they can make you more tired afterwards as they give you short bursts of energy. definately stay hydrated but building up endurance takes time.<br>  <br>  I would definately say have a good nights sleep before and have a high carb breakfast before the tryout.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|y2xkJ1rKaa	run instead of watching tv or doing anything else go running. run long distance and do some sprints here and there. you'll build up your stamina and your burst speed. o yeah good luck!
dn2nHtxOaa	They keep control of the players by being calm, and using the power of the yellow/red card.<br>  They can advise the spectators to be quiet, but they don't have authority so thees not much you can do here.<br>  Theres not much equipment to look after.

UoT86gbiaa	First off, this is basically a 4-for-2 deal.  Franceour is a garbage throw-in, as he's barely ownable in most formats.  The other owner is adding him to disguise how the offer is really quantity for quality.  Any time you're getting a bunch of players in return, you're probably losing out.  Unless you have a bad team or need to compensate for injuries, look to try to get even deals: 2-for-2 or 3-for-3, not this 4-for-2 offer..<br>  <br>  To the analysis: You don't need Fielder or Dye, as you're covered at both their positions.  Upton is a downgrade from Sizemore, Suzuki is a BIG downgrade from McCann.  Turn it down, and tell the other owner if he seriously wants McCann then he has to seriously improve your team somewhere else, like 3B or SS or both.|`|0MJRD9sYaa	Don't do it. You already start 4 outfielders so it would mess up your lineup. You would have to make another trade to fix it. This is what your lineup would be:<br>  <br>  C-Suzuki<br>  1B-Pujols<br>  2b- Kinsler<br>  3B-Zimmerman<br>  SS-Tejada<br>  OF-Crawford<br>  OF-Ellsbury<br>  OF-Upton<br>  Util-Fielder<br>  <br>  So you would be forced to start Kurt Suzuki and bench Jermaine Dye.  You are definitely getting better talent but I wouldn't do this trade unless you plan on making another one.|`|9Dv4GBHYaa	who care best team in the mlb pirates|`|LGVrhTFTaa	I like that trade for you..<br>  Upton will steal more bases then Sizemore,hit about the same average,but hit less homers.Prince Fielder would make up for the loss of homeruns,and then some,and would vastly improve your utility slot.<br>  And Dye could replace Ellsbury,or Crawford when you're way ahead in steals+runs (Which I think you will be quite a bit!) <br>  Suzuki is a up and coming catcher in his own right,and I highly doubt McCann will repeat last years numbers,catchers hardly ever do.<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|syzMIfLLaa	I donk know, Upton wont replace what you loose in Sizemore, Dye wont steal bases.  Fielder might not gain you more over Ibanez than you loose going from sazuki to McCann.  A top rate Catcher is hard to come by, and harder to replace.  I would pass up on the trade and look if Hafner is on the FA list, he has been in most leagues, and is poised for a great comeback.
6S8KjBLQaa	Um yes, because I'm pretty sure Rafa won't lose to somebody ranked in the hundreds, like say, a wildcard from Uzbekistan..<br>  chances are slim he can mannage, seeing that he's never lost a match at the french open.<br>  Edit- it is played over 2 days, and I guarantee Rafa won't lose in the 1st round, so it is a pretty good guess that if you buy tickets for those two days you'll get to see your man...have you lost faith in him lol|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	I am really scared about your condition.|`|0dJU51fcaa	The guys injured - he may not play at all!|`|AA12034105	Yeah they're played over two days :)<br>  But they have moved him to the Susan Lenglen court before :S  It's more likely that he will play on the Philip Chatrier court but they could move him again :S<br>  Even though he's the #1 and four time champion they could still move him :(<br>  Jankovic was moved to court 18 when she was seeded 2 for Wimbledon lol<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Awk do you want me just to phone Rafa and ask him when he's playing and on what court ? haha :P<br>  He owns Roland Garros so they should do as he wants haha !!<br>  <br>  Haha how did you work that one out ?  I would loveeeee to go but I dunno if the mother would entertain that one ahaa :P<br>  She might go as far as England but France if another story ahaa :P<br>  <br>  Yeah our boy has never once let us down on clay ;)
tzrLDbHWaa	OK, everyone who is saying this is a bad move, doesn't make sense, thinking he shouldn't sign such a low contract in a game without a salary cap, well you've all proven one thing.  You know nothing about baseball.<br>  <br>  This is Lincecum's 3rd year.  You know what that means?  It means he has NO CHOICE at all in the matter.  He can't do anything but take whats given to him.  650k is a nice paycheck for Lincecum considering the Giants could have told him he's playing for the minimum, like 400k, and he could do nothing but accept it, NOTHING AT ALL.<br>  <br>  Players are property of the team that drafted them until they've played 6 major league seasons.  The first 3 the player can't do a thing but accept what the team gives them.  After the 3rd season they're eligible for salary arbitration, which pretty much means that the team submits an offer and the player submits an offer, and a judge decides which offer is fairer and thats the new contract.  Most players will reach an agreement before salary arbitration, but since they really can't leave and go elsewhere, they're not going to get the huge megadeals until after year 6 when they can actually negotiate with other teams.<br>  <br>  So, for all of you who think thats a bad deal for Lincecum, think about it this way.  If you had no choice but to take what was given to you, and all SF has to give you is 400k, wouldn't you be delighted at 650k.  Next year you'll be making some nice money, but for this year 250k that they legally don't owe you is a nice bonus.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I don't understand why he agreed to it either. If he hit the markets, teams would give big bucks for him. Maybe he likes it in San Fran. That could be the only possible reason why he'd except 650k in a game where theres no salary cap|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Jimmy's got the right answer.<br>  Don't worry, Linecum will be making a pretty large payday when he hits free agency and signs elsewhere.  Most likely the Yankees.  hey, hey, what's with all the thumbs down??  I was just kidding.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	It's just a practical example of baseball's salary structure. Pre-arb players have little negotiation leverage. Lincy got a healthy raise of over 60%. He'll be fine.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	The giants still own his rights and until his arbitration years run out. He will probably sign a contract with the giants like Cole Hamels did with the Phillies.|`|AA10441760	He's not a free agent nor is he eligible for arbitration. The story basically translates to " Linececum accepts a pay raise from the giants". If he doesn't like it he could hold out but that would only result in fines to his small bank account.|`|3XLEQQI6aa	i think he deserves about $5 million a year but i think that under a million dollars is crazy|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Hes a home grown player that hasn't come out of contract to load him up with millions yet.
ubGNtkHQaa	That's what happens when you sign mediocre pitchers (Penny, Smoltz) that are way past their prime.|`|xbez1qBPaa	This is just warm up games. Meaningless. They'll be in it right to the end in September/ October. Just like always.<br>  Judging by your name, you must be a Yankees fan.<br>  Remind me, how many rings they win this century?|`|VPDcy4Qwaa	No they can't.|`|RJghPceKaa	god do you realize that minor leaguers are playing half the time?|`|e3aZsDqwaa	hehehe GO YANKS|`|khqWGKU9aa	Lets not get ahead of yourself here. Although a yanks fan, spring training is pretty meaningless. The only good thing about it is, Joba for instance will be able to work up his arm to become a starter. But to the guy who said they signed old pitchers. Yes they did but if healthy they could have the most dominant rotation. Signing those 2 guys for the price was a bargain, and they are gambling that they will be healthy. And to "taker" they have won 1 in 2000. And its sox bandwagon fans like yourself that actually answer these questions with answers like that, so how many world series do the sox have in all? what is it 9, maybe 10. 26>10(give or take 1). So lets be real.|`|bke1xKcCaa	Who cares? And I say that as a Yankee fan. Besides they beat Boston College. Lol|`|oj1omE0Aaa	who cares it's just spring training|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	They did.

cOPCNP7Laa	I heard he was going back regardless...|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Bring Fat Ronaldo back!|`|xMEuz7otaa	I think we'll see Beckham back in L.A. with the Galaxy simply because he can't get out of his contract early.  Or at least AC Milan will not be interested enough to pay the amount that MLS will require.  I've heard that Milan offered 3.5mil or 5mil, I'm sure that the Galaxy are looking for more like 20mil.  And they'll never get that.  Beckham will be back in LA this season and he'll most likely walk away in October, like his contract allows him to do.|`|8zgFyfibaa	Well he should come back it was only a temporary loan,he should step up he wanted to come to la galaxy and now he wants to stay in milan.<br>  <br>  He's not worth 20 million and milan are not stupid to pay that much for a player so closed to retiring. <br>  <br>  Let him leave la galaxy in october but by that time milan won't want him. <br>  <br>  He thinks he's the best probaly in modeling etc.... but the only thing he was known for was free kicks that's it.|`|8UOkX4Jnaa	Have some respect for the player he is pretty awesome!

I think it would be difficult for him to be drafted to raw because of all the firepower they have (and its looking like HHH is headed to raw). I dunno though.

q8dX0MsNaa	you can always use a braid. l don't believe they have a memory but l stopped using them, myself.<br>  most top quality monos have somewhat less memory but it is a built-in factor of nylon monofilaments. <br>  some co-polymers like silver thread also have less memory. silver thread is a good line. smaller diameter, too.<br>  try a conventional reel once. there are a number of bass sized baitcasters that have a click button so you can leave the reel in freespool and listen for the bite.<br>  l use a big S/W outfit for cats with a newell 330 reel and 30lb mono.|`|bkhvdfJxaa	i agree on the p-line...but id prefer the breaded line...stronger stength for less the size......just incase the ONE comes along.....|`|PwB9aDiNaa	Stren is a great brand of line i use it for bass,trout,catfish, and carp|`|lECmz3SEaa	Southbend|`|RZFl8C2waa	P-line is the best line on the market by far. I would reccomend buying the flouroclear. It's called flouroclear, I don't mean flourocarbon. They have excellent flourocarbon as well. All their lines are extremely low in memory and coated with flourcarbon so it's invisible under water. They have 15 pound line too. It's about 30% thinner than any other brand so you could get away with 17 if you wanted to, especially with carp and catfish. I fish in bass tournaments and rarely break off with P-line and never have any problems with it. Stren is probably the worst line on the market, don't fall for advertisement, the problem with companies today are that they spend too much money on advertisement and not enough on making a good product. The p-line flouroclear is $8.99 for 300 yards.
KJMOvKcSaa	DEFINANTLY! I always get sheckler plan b decks. Plan B has the best street skaters (Ryan Sheckler) and one of the best vert skaters (Danny Way). I suggest you get one from ccs.com though.

Mcdyess definitley deserves a ring with all his hardwork and dedication despite the injuries he has had.
RJ5Bevmpaa	These answers are very highly inaccurate. Speaking from years of experience, ask a security staff member which exit the players will come out of after the games, they should be able to direct you to the door you are looking for. There will be a crowd of generally 30 or so fans outside that door waiting, so you will know when you are in the right place, there will be a fenced in lot to the right of the doorway and you'll get the feeling as though you were down in a parking garage with the door at ground level when you are at the right door. If you stand at the door facing the road/river, the door will be off to your right shoulder, your back will be at the fenced in area, and Cobo Hall (I think it was Cobo?) will be off to your left. <br>  <br>  This will also be valuable for getting any visiting teams' autographs as well, as their bus tends to be parked out in that same area and the players will wade through the crowd to the bus after the game.<br>  <br>  All of this will tend to happen about a half hour after the game ends, so the players can shower and do interviews etc.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	you wont get into the parking lot at the Joe. You should go by the tunnel where the Wings come out of. At the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd try to get right next to the tunnel and yell for an autograph..just no loud and obnoxious. Just be like Pavel! or Mr.Datsyuk! can i please have an autograph. Just be polite the pros love it.|`|PuLmPdYvaa	stand out by where the players park thats how i got some nyr autographs|`|ViB84hYzaa	There is no access to player parking at the Joe. Getting autographs overall at the Joe is very difficult and my guess is you will not get any. The only thing I would suggest is to get there at the time they open the doors to ticket holders and get to the glass and next to the runway where they come out from the locker room for warm-ups.<br>  <br>  add: They park street level in a gated lot adjoining the Joe, near the Gordie Howe entrance.<br>  Players will not sign autographs before or during the game! Chances are again, very slim of you getting autographs from the Wings at home unless you catch them after practice or out on the town. You would have better luck obtaining autographs while the Wings are on the road staying at a hotel.<br>  Your best bet in this case is to send autograph requests along with a self addressed stamped envelope to...<br>  Player name c/o Detroit Red Wings<br>  19 Steve Yzerman Dr<br>  Detroit, MI 48226<br>  limit your request to 1 or 2 items at first.....and again, good luck.
7qeHZe9Yaa	I think it still is great.<br>  <br>  It is true, us wrestling fans tend to live in the past,we can't help it sometimes. I think we all know it is not as good as a few years ago but for this era it is great. <br>  <br>  During the attitude era it was great to see a brawl come from out of nowhere because it was in fact all about attitude. Now looking in this PG era a person who brings in the money (John Cena) is obviously going to get pushed more. I think we all just have to live with it because it is not going to change anytime soon.|`|hNIyshmkaa	Well with people around during the Attitude Era (such as myself) they expect too much. With the high quality product I grew up with I expect WWE to have that same high quality even if I know it isn't possible. So I don't necessarily think we're too picky I just think we expect too much.|`|L33SgSmVaa	There is no competition for wwe anymore leading to the suckiness.<br>  TNA has too much ground to catch up to even consider competing with wwe.  <br>  <br>  Only way to get wwe standards up would be to have WWE brands vs another wrestling brand like TNA going head to head on tv.|`|qBk0fPWGaa	Yeah, i mean chris jericho wrestling GOD!!!!!|`|MFFYPdhVaa	its decent
t4MN8gcMaa	Payton was better, he never gave up on a play, and he was always moving forward, you could almost never get him down on the first hit and i never once saw him go out of bounds to avoid contact.  Barry sanders, was a great back too, but he would run for 1 yard, like twenty times in a row then break one all of the sudden.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Sanders had more pure running ability an explosiveness.  But Payton was better at recieving and blocking, so he was better overall.<br>  <br>  As I fan, I'd rather see Sanders play.  I can't a remember a player who was more entertaining.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	walter payton|`|gBfPkdroaa	well i think over time, Adrian peterson will learn to be one of the best, and i definatly have a good feeling about matt forte. he broke paytons rookie record.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Payton.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	walter peyton<br>  no reasons hes better hands down<br>  check out his highlights|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	I'm gonna say Walter Peyton. He was so SWEET!!!<br>  <br>  GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	I love Barry but Walter Peyton It was near impossible to catch and tackle him and he came back from a surgery that people said he would never play again and did he prove them wrong<br>  <br>  But the Best of all time JIM BROWN every play was like 20 or more yards they change the rules of lacrosse to try to stop him when he played|`|CxoytUYhaa	Walter is the best ever and then its Sanders. If anyone can be in their class it would be Jim Brown. He was a beast. He brought the position of runningback to a whole different level.|`|S7uGTirdaa	Walter PAyton is the hands down best running back ever. But there are a lot better than Barry. theres Earl cambell, tony Dorsett, Jim Brown, and lots of others.|`|CDvQ7OLWaa	barry|`|Pj3V07yaaa	walter|`|mUSs0lyaaa	barry sanders. i think A.P.'s name will be right up their with them when he retires.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	walter payton is the best hb ever|`|AA11364084	Barry Sanders no question!!!
hynkDOeEaa	I think they will resign them, after all look how well he led the cardinals this season right?!<br>  <br>  <br>  But to answer your question they won't do to good unless Leinart steps his game up or they get a better QB.|`|tPaRZod9aa	If they don't resign Warner, they don't deserve to do good.|`|UlXBL8tbaa	poorly!|`|rM9WzIkHaa	they will do bad no matter what the 49ers are going to have the best record in that confrence|`|KTp27Fokaa	4-12, 3rd in division|`|AA10789965	it will be back to life, back to reality...
nLwDGJAGaa	THANK YOU!!! Finally, there's someone who knows what they're talking about! People are acting like it's AI's fault because he got traded to Detroit. Blame Joe Dumars for that, he was the one who wanted AI.<br>  <br>  Michael Curry needs to go. He's not aggressive enough.  Also, Detroit needs a true PG. Stuckey needs some more development. Me personally I would have like to see AI and CB play on a team together.<br>  <br>  I'm actually afraid to watch them play Boston Sunday on national tv:( However, I am excited because I am going to see them play the Hawks live in Atlanta!!!|`|bNx2ARfEaa	I do believe Curry is the problem but look at the stats. Iverson is doing all right but Billups is rocking in Denver. Which is another reason. Also (I hate to admit this about my favorite team) but they are babies. They always complain about fouls so calls rarely go their way.|`|aupDanleaa	If they had Billups they're right there bos,  cle, orl he gives them defense and leadership which iverson doesnt have. Just look what hes doing in Denver hes not putting up crazy numbers hes just whats enough to win.|`|9mtMw9Qaaa	I COMPLETELY AGREE...!<br>  but they shuldnt have trade....kuz know their team chemistry isnt as high...<br>  u know wat they say...if it aint broke  dont fix it.|`|6HQHSYvDaa	The way i look at it they had to trade billups. sure theyve been going the the eastren conference semi finals for like the last 6 years with billups but they usually lose in the eastren conference semi finals. And now that boston orlando and clevland are all getting stronger there is no way they would got past anything with billups. the pistons made this trade purely for the playoffs not the regular season because someone like iverson can explode at anytime and carry a team through  a couple of seris. plus there was a bunch of financial advantages for pistons after the trade. everyone is blaming iverson because hes kind of a ball hog and pistons have been playing team basketball for the last decade , so noone  on the team is really use to iversons game. especially hamilton who expects the ball everytime he comes off screens but now he doesnt really get the ball where he comfotable|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Piston's is all about defense even back to the Bad Boys days and defense is the reason why the Pistons made it to straight Final apperances. Maybe it's the change of coach but it's mostly the trade for Iverson. When Ben Wallace left the Pistons got alittle weaker. Now that Billups is gone the Pistons are way weaker.|`|MTbgg5eyaa	It's not about Allen Iverson. It's about their new coach, Curry.<br>  His offense is too complicated yet stupid if you come to think of it, they traded away Chauncey Billups, and replaced Allen Iverson. So, basically, they can be argued as a running team, and a running team, with a coach who calls his offense a "motion offense", would be like the Phoenix Suns, with Terry Porter.<br>  <br>  You see, the guy keeps on making mistakes, doesn't call mismatches, and rarely make a perfect play.<br>  Terry Porter is the one responsible for this. If they fire him, and replace him with the like of Avery Johnson (fast tempo yet strict defense), they will be going to start banging teams.<br>  <br>  What you realize is Allen is the reason, and nope, A.I. is not the reason, I mean, he was the one responsible for carrying the Nuggets when Carmelo was DUI-ing. When Billups came, the Nuggets were already playing fast-paced offense, and we all saw that Billups liked it.<br>  <br>  No wonder, Billups never seemed too happy with the Pistons' coach, Michael Curry, because he was underachieving under his authority.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	I think your right. Curry doesn't know what to do. i think he should bring rip back to the starting line-up and bench stuckey. Before the losing skid AI and Rip are already able to play side to side. Curry doesn't know what's the best to do. He has 2 of the best scorers in the league and they are both putting up below their averages. I think Dumars should follow the suns and fire curry.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	your right its not iversons fault it joe dumars fault for firing slip and for trading away one of the top offfensive and DEFENSIVE point guards in the league. Oh and did i mention the most clutch|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	Because he is black no im joking idk they are having some problems|`|NRiSJewTaa	pistons are falling apart

sqfjfR3iaa	I don't know. I went to Raw House Shows in Madison Square Garden in August and December. The WWE will notifiy me when they have House Shows, Live events television Tapings and Pay Per Views in New York City. I may be up there for Ring of Honor before WWE comes back there. It looks like the earliest that WWE could do a Pay Per View in New York City would be September 2009. The Great American Bash in July will be at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, PA and in August, Summer Slam will be at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Don't look for Wrestlemania XXVI to be in New York City, the WWE announced 2 days ago that Wrestlemania XXVI will be in Glendale Arizona, University of Arizona Football Stadium, where the Arizona Cardinals play. Look for the 2010 WWE Hall of Fame Induction to be in the same Arena where the Phoenix Suns play Basketball and the Phoenix Coyotes play Hockey.|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	On April 28 2009|`|Q7U2HaYdaa	Come here:<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a><br>  this site never lets me down and it always shows High Quality and HD streams and plus it never lags with the amount of people!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> Also it shows RAW, Smackdown, ECW, TNA, ROH, Boxing, UFC!!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> !!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a><br>  this site never lets me down and it always shows High Quality and HD streams and plus it never lags with the amount of people!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> Also it shows RAW, Smackdown, ECW, TNA, ROH, Boxing, UFC!!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> !!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a><br>  this site never lets me down and it always shows High Quality and HD streams and plus it never lags with the amount of people!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> Also it shows RAW, Smackdown, ECW, TNA, ROH, Boxing, UFC!!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> !!!!!!!!!!!

irljnVkAaa	The league should determine who the champion of England is, but a champions league place should go to the winner of the FA cup. If this doesn't happen, the FA cup will become even more devalued by the big teams as they only play for money.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	no ffs, the champion of england is the league winners|`|exARv7Bmaa	Sure, anything you say pal.|`|YiFwUJZkaa	If a team from the lower leagues wins the FA cup then how can they be the best team in england if they cant even make it into the EPL?<br>  The best team in england is the one that wins the EPL.|`|mK06dus9aa	League = Best Team, end of.|`|cpSXA0udaa	That what the Community Shield is for|`|VtjZ4DBcaa	No, the Premiership is the fairest judge of a team's ability. Whereas in the FA Cup, a bad refereeing decision or lucky goal can end a team's chances, the league allows the top teams to rise to the top over the course of a full season. The fact that you write that the league is won by the "richest team" that can "outlast all other teams with depth", also means that it is almost certainly being won by the strongest (and most deserving) team overall.<br>  <br>  The FA Cup is undoubtedly a fantastic competition that Premier League teams should probably take more seriously. It allows unheard of teams to compete with the giants of British football, but it doesn't really determine a true "Champion of England". In my view it also rewards boring, defensive football as a lesser team can defend constantly in the hopes of at least earning a money spinning replay or a penalty shootout attempt. The Premier League may not pe perfect, but ultimately it is the best judge of English football.<br>  <br>  If you liked my answer check out my sports blog at britsknowsportstoo.blogspot.com|`|xMEuz7otaa	Well, I think that you are right about bigger, richer teams doing better in the league, but I don't like the idea of a tournament deciding who the league champs are.  Then what is the point of playing week in week out in the league?  Bigger richer clubs also do better in the FA Cup then smaller clubs do.  If the league winner was the team that won the FA cup, then bigger squads would just play there reserve sides all season long and send there best squads out for FA cup games.  Also, how would you deal with promotion and relegation? In that case then, theoretically you could win the FA Cup, be crowned league champions and also be relegated to the Championship in the same season? <br>  I think that salaries and crazy transfer fees are the problem and if they were somehow brought under control, then  you would see a more even playing ground for everyone.

nLwDGJAGaa	I also can't believe that M. Curry isn't gone. I think that it's all a coaching and management issue. I think they can be a .500+ team by the end of the season. I do put part of the blame on the players. There is absolutely NO team chemistry. Everybody on the team has NO passion except for McDyess, AI, and Maxiell.  But all good things must come to an end.<br>  <br>  To address the above answers:<br>  People need to stop blaming A.I. for the Pistons problem. Chauncey Billups and Allen Iverson are two different players. There are some things that CB can do better than AI. There are some things that AI can do better than CB. Stop thinking that AI is going to come in and do the same thing that CB does because he's not CB! Also, he has came to Detroit and sacrificed his game for the team but he's still selfish?! <br>  <br>  I'm sorry but I had to address the ignorant comments|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	Yes. But their record will be the lowest among all of their record for the past 6 or 7 years.|`|eF60R7DPaa	no...and they will miss the playoffs|`|iWUkh5d5aa	he was barely hired|`|tGjoKeUtaa	No. Iverson is not a leader the way Billups was. Just look at Billups in Denver. Denver is way better with Billups with Iverson same with in Detroit. Plus Sheed is gettin old as well as Rip they just need to rebulid around Maxiel and Stuckey. IN my mind them two r great|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Yes they will be over .500 but will not get past the 1st or second round.|`|xWGJHMkuaa	The team has talent yes, but zero chemistry, and that is just as important. First of all, they have the self absorbed Allen Iverson, who cares about only himself. Second, they have Rasheed wallace who they may just end up releasing in the coming weeks, even more of a cancer to the team, and terrible on court behavior. THirdly, they have no point guard. Stuckey is a great young player, with a bright future, but he is not a point guard.  He is a scorer. He belongs at the 2. 4th, they have no center, rasheed is a forward, not a center. 5th: they have no leader, no one in the locker room like a ray lewis type player to take control.  Detroit needs a change in attitud. Michael Curry could be doing better, but it's really just wrong place at the wrong time. The team doesn't respect him, how can he be successful? I hope they drop sheed, nothing but a cancer who has 20 games left with them anyway, and tank the rest of the season to get into the lottery. I'm talking about 35 minutes a night for Amir Johnson. THis season was over the minute they traded Billups.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying AI is the same kind of player as Billups. THey are different players and that IS WHY the Pistons are done. Iverson's style and  personality are just not a fit on the Pistons. What they need right now is a true leader and a point gaurd. AI is neither of those things. Billups is both.

dmX3zwbHaa	Kyokushin will make you mental and fysical strong , they focus heavy on power,knock out kicks and punches no flashy useless **** it's the real deal (alot of bag,pads work out).  And no there are no throws, and holds. You can compare it with muay thai only that you can't hit the face with fists (knee,legs you can).<br>  <br>  check it out on youtube.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If you are talking minus the sport aspect then yes. Kyokushin is a very authentic and hard core form of Karate Do. They primarily focus on developing the body into a sort of steel weapon. Since Kyokushin is heavily recognized for their brutal combativeness in Kumite sessions few people realize the beauty to and authentic training that goes on in the system. <br>  <br>  Just as in all Karate, or any martial art for that matter, there are good schools and bad schools. When I trained in Kyokushin for my brief period I was lucky enough to train under a Sensei who had traveled and lived in Japan studying it. He wasn't heavily into the sport aspect of it but enjoyed a good round of Kumite once in awhile.<br>  <br>  Unrealistic kicks? Have you ever fought someone that landed one of those kicks? I doubt it. Kyokushin kicks are considered the most lethal in karate and they will knock you out or break bones.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	It focuses on making your body tougher and more resilient to Damage.  It is a striking art, it also teaches a lot of close combat fighting and how to deliver devastating blows when you're close to your opponent.  Not a whole lot of fancy kicks, but if you want to get tougher and take less damage in a fight, this is the way to go.  There's also lots of Kumite (sparring) with no protective gear|`|ThNC4f1kaa	My impression - punches to the body and unrealistic kicks. Not that it's a bad thing.

ThKao2mTaa	We all knew that Football players are tougher than Basketball players because mainly of their physical body strength. They are trained to tackle, bump and even take down opponents to stop them from scoring touchdown..... <br>  <br>  If basketball players are trained just like the football players do, then I think they can get bigger, bulkier and stronger than what they are today, For example, If Kevin Durant would likely to go under the training of Football players for strength development purpose only then he would likely gain more more muscles and become bulkier in no time thus, he may not be prone to injury.<br>  <br>  NBA players like Lebron James, Allen Iverson and Ben Wallace played Football during their early years proved how tough they are today in the NBA. And of course don't forget how good Terrell Owens is (a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys)  when he played in the 2008 and 2009 NBA All-Star celebrity game.<br>  <br>  G0t it?

wyWGtzfAaa	To win. <br>  <br>  Sorry but thats all I could really tell you. In a fight like that anything can happen.  If I could I'd try to clinch him and use knees or jab him and finish with an elbow.  Im better at Muay Thai then ground so I'd try to stay on my feet, or get up as quickly as possible. <br>   Basically the way I have been taught is to always be moving forward. Try to do as much damage to one guy quickly and then move forward and be ready for his friends.  If its over then leave right away.  No flexing, no **** talking. Just leave.<br>  Thats only when you really have to. If you train and know how to fight pretty well you can seriously hurt someone who thinks their tough but doesn't know wtf they're doing. So be cautious.|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Knee him in his gut. Then sock him in his face.

I'm also really short ( 5'5'') so in a fight I'm usually at a disadvantage. I don't need to keep my hands up, as I've got really got reaction times from boxing. Guarding is always good technique, but not nearly as impressive( if, after the fight, he thinks he never stood a chance of landing a punch, he won't ever start another fight) <br>  <br>  So in any street fight I've ever been in (except one - the guy was 6'5'' so he just guillotine kicked me and i was KO'd )  i just stand off and let him throw punches, I keep moving, and stepping out of range in good time( don't need to be fancy about it)  when he gets frustrated and starts throwing haymakers all over the place i'd throw in a few jabs, when he throws himself off balance i'd step him, line him up with a left jab, and knock him clean out with a right cross. never fails. <br>  <br>  In school however knocking him out would get me expelled, so i would try not to do that. <br>  <br>  just slap down any bitchy jabs, keep your hands up, hovering just out from your temples, shrug your shoulders so your chin is essentially guarded from hooks by your shoulder. Your guard should be such that a fist can't hit your chin/temple from the sides unless you move your hands. If he throws hooks( a wide punch at the side of your head), tense your respective arm. If he throws jabs(straight arm punches toward your face), 'slap' his arm towards the opposite side of his body at the wrist/forearm, with an open, stiff hand. It's good tecnique to slap down a jab while stepping around him. <br>  <br>  Eg. He throws right hook, extended left jab, you Tense your left arm to take the hook, then slap his left jab across his body( to your left) with your right hand( this will seem instinctive at the time ) and step swiftly to your right. <br>  This will put you in a situation where you are to his left, his left hand is still occupied with your right arm. you can then land a safe, and fairly solid hook with your free hand( which is still sitting at guard after that hook) <br>  <br>  This stuff if really hard to explain via text. It seems like common sense when you think about it... try it out with a friend and see if you get it. But these things are all about practice. <br>  the trick i focused on is probably the most likely to help you. ( but usually, if you're not trained, you will just grapple and fall on the ground. )<br>  <br>  Good luck though. <br>  <br>  If all else seems hopeless, Square up to him, and head-butt him. <br>  <br>  Specific enough for ya? =]|`|RygWpQnraa	use you legs as often as possible and fight fast not like a turtle  (no offence Mr. turtle  hahahhahahah : )|`|0oCVN8zKaa	say you want to fight and show them what ur about|`|AA10698309	Do not start the fight. <br>  <br>  If you are attacked... Your plan should be to finish the fight in one strike from your defense against their attack. Block the punch and strike the throat or solar plexus. If you are charged throw a front kick to the head or solar plexus.|`|lJJsKvunaa	First, throw a kick to either his ribs or his legs. Most dudes don't expect a kick and even if they see it coming, they have no defense for it. I'll catch them.<br>  <br>  If they get close on me, then I'm going into the clinch and putting a knee into his grill.<br>  <br>  Pretty simple.|`|ONFI9GfQaa	You should avoid fighting but if you must never have a plan allow it to come naturally.

acaf29a0171c5a4fbac431f28c3f6832aa	Traditional martial arts doesn't necessarily have to be old arts that are more than 50 yrs old. They refer to arts that follow a set tradition instead of evolving into something new. Not all of these traditional arts are limited to one or two ranges of fighting, but unfortunately most are and that is what corrupted everything. Before you had all of these different martial arts with different names and such, martial arts was just simply "martial arts", "fighting", or "combat". This is not to day that traditional martial arts are "BAD". The reason why there are so many is simply because of the goal in mind. Ya know, which way you want to use the body to defeat your opponent, which position you should place your hands in order to land it precisely on such and such spot. Ya know, stuff like that.<br>  <br>  MMA is not just randomly mixing martial arts that will work. It's about training in all areas of combat so that you will be well rounded. Because of the corruption of traditionalists only focusing on one or two ranges of fighting, in the modern days now, people have to train in different martial arts just to be well rounded instead of going to one dojo to get all of your training in.<br>  <br>  If you think closely, the natural way of human combat is to use all ranges of fighting. By nature, we can all punch, kick, grapple, and use weapons, so the MMA thing is like going back to the old mindset of being well rounded.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	MMA- best sport around, a true test of person v. person on an equal playing field.  There are plenty of fighters who have backgrounds in traditional martial arts: wrestling, karate, boxing, judo, muay thai, BJJ, ect.  The best martial artist knows that he needs to keep learning new techniques.  <br>  <br>  Traditional martial arts- great for self defense, self-esteem, fitness, ect.  Thing is on the street people can have weapons.  You can kick someone in the groin.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	There is a huge difference. I read through your entire question and you are misconcieved on MMA. MMA is simply a name applied to the sport of mixing styles and fighting to win matches. It is not a martial art. Although all traditional martial arts came from mixing of various systems there is much more to them than MMA. Traditional martial arts have ethics, philosophy, traditions, etiquette and their ultimate aim is to improve the person...not win matches in a cage. Interesting question though.<br>  <br>  Edit - any good martial artist will tell you that a dictionary definition of martial arts is not relevant to them at all. Also the culture is what determined the ethics and philosophies associated with martial arts not religion.|`|ONFI9GfQaa	MMA is a sport nothing more the idea of mixing martial arts can be bad if you do not know all the forms of what you are 'mixing'.|`|AA10976536	"Traditional" martial art just means that it's been around for 50 or so years. Nothing more, nothing less - they can be as sport-oriented as any modern, UFC-influenced style. Judo, for example, is pretty much a sport style, and it's been around since the 1800's. Tae Kwon Do also has heavy a competetive sport element in it, depending on who is teaching it. <br>  <br>  And they can be just as mixed as the MMA's of today - Hap Ki Do, for example, is essentially Tae Kwon Do with an aggressive form of akido tacked on the side. (Which is a fine thing to do, IMO - they compliment each other nicely.) <br>  <br>  So really, it's a false dilemma: Traditional martial arts of today were the MMA's of yesteryear. Some were sport-oriented, some were self-defense oriented, some fitness-oriented. This isn't a new question, really.<br>  <br>  That being said - the 'traditional' arts of today are those that have stood the darwinian evolutions of time. I'm sure there were many quite fine martial artists in the past who studied multiple systems, incorporated elements from all of them, and then failed miserably for whatever reason. So the critique of traditional martial artists is really a sort-of scientific, experimental critique: specific MMA's haven't been shown to work well together in a rigorus, repeatable fashion, so why are some claiming that they work? <br>  <br>  But again: taking two limited arts (such as boxing and wrestling), teaching them together in a fashion that complements and fills in the holes of the other, addining in some knife defense, and calling it a martial art? I personally have no problem with that - but it needs to be rigorously tested to show that it DOES work, and the instructors need to understand the limits of both styles (they're sport styles, really) and what needs to be changed as a consequence. <br>  <br>  And traditional MA's need to understand that their styles, while rigorusly tested at one time, need to be continually tested to ensure that the instructors at least understand WHY they perform techniques in a certian way, and what the ultimate goal of the system is. Otherwise, you start talking at cross-purposes.<br>  <br>  EDIT - and no, traditional martial arts do not necessarily require philosophy or ethics - The definion of martial art (according to the dictionary) is "self-defense or combative melee techniques, often used as sport." I study Escrima, and I've never heard any ethical training or philosophy whatsoever beyond "make sure it's self-defense, because the instructor dosen't want to be charged as an accessory." Neither, In my experience, does Muay Thai. And claiming that neither of these are martial arts is going to fail the "man on the street" test . <br>  <br>  many martial arts DO have philsophy and ethics associated with them, but that's because they were often used by buddhist monks as meditative exercises. Others have it for the simple reason that it's a good idea to tell someone WHEN to kill, in addition to HOW to kill. (Soldiers get the same type of ethical training.) But it's not a necessary requirement.

38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Because Bulls fans are bitter and pissed that their team LOST.<br>  <br>  Brad Miller is a cheap player and classless just like the Bulls. Did you see that vicious elbow he threw at Perkins head when Perk tried to poke the ball loose? Vinny DelNegr pulled him right after that.<br>  <br>  I cannot believe the word "flagrant" is even mentioned with Rondo or the play on Miller. Only whiny Bulls fans are complaining about that one.<br>  <br>  The refs pretty much gave the game to the Bulls but the Celts still won so go C's!|`|FpJ2qvrCaa	Being that I am a Bulls fan it was pretty obvious that it was a flagrant foul, just because you like your team and you are denying it is cool, but it easily was a flagrant foul, BUT because it was at the end of the game and it was a crutial play i had no problem with the refs not calling it, plus they were in Boston and the Bulls would never get that call anyways. But it was flagrant, just admit that it if the same play happened to Pierce that it probably would have gotten called as a flagrant and you would say it was a flagrant also.|`|gU0bWOoyaa	If Brad Miller had been balancing the ball on his face, then maybe you could convince me he was going for the ball.  "Difficult enough to see that Rondo even fouled him"????  Was the mouthful of blood he was spitting out not enough proof for you?|`|6Efhd6lNaa	I actually agree with you 100%. People just love to hate on Boston I guess.|`|NoENXFrLaa	youre a complete imbecile - after showing the replay like 10 times, i could clearly see rondo jumping up take a split second to determine whether he could hit his arm or hand, and then just hit him straight in the mouth. brad miller ended up losing a tooth when rondo could have just grabbed his shoulder. the camera angle makes it look as if rondo just slaps him because rondo hit him from the opposite side of the camera , with brads face on the other side. rondo definitely did that on purpose, and im surprised that the bulls didnt retaliate. take it like this- if that was kobe or lebron or some other big star they would have called a flagrant. even if brad miller acted like half of the players in the NBA he could have enticed a flagrant call out of the ref.|`|ahdu4zakaa	Difficult enough to see that Rondo even fouled him? HUH? Are you kidding me? He knocked one of Millers teeth loose for Christ sakes. Rondo swiped at the ball and missed by nearly two feet, LOL. And  by the rules of the game that was a flagrant foul 1. It wasn’t called because  the game was in Boston. Not a Bulls fan, but you sure must be a Celtic fan, lol.|`|0nSsAdbaaa	DaaaaaaM!  Did you see DHoward throw that bow! That coulda killed Dalembert if it hit flush!  <br>  <br>  BUT!! Dalembert WAS using both arms and forearms and str8 pushed DHoward in the back. DHoward was reacting to S. Dalembert dirty play. Not sayin it's right, but ESPN doesn't even acknowledge Dalembert's blantant hard push in the back puttin his elbow and forearm all up in DHowards upper back. <br>  <br>  DaaaaaM!|`|csM5GNpraa	if he tried to swipe at it and missed it would have hit his arm not his face<br>  <br>  he had the ball extended in his right hand and rondo was behind him and swung at his face...idk how much more clear it can get|`|Rad4jlGBaa	I don't think it was a flagrant foul it. It sure was a foul and a hard one to|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I'm not a fan of either team and that was definitely a flagrant foul because he didn't go for the ball.  He went for his head/neck from behind.  Flagrant foul calls were implemented to prevent injuries.  Rondo barely reached the back of his head, so I'm not sure how you thought he swiped at the ball.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think Rondo meant to hurt him, but it was obvious he tried to foul him hard to prevent an easy lay up.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	i also didnt think that was a flagrant.  miller brought the ball up slowly and close to his face and rondo was trying to block it.  unfortunately by hte time rondos arm got there, the ball was above his face.  i dont think that was intentional, it would be really stupid to try to hurt a guy and risk losing a game because of the 1 or 2 extra free throws he wouldve got from a flagrant, had it been called a flagrant.
