E5gaKzCsaa	They say to keep out of reach of children and pets so one of them doesn't eat the stuff and choke on it. Very soon after you use it on the floor, it will dry up. There's been an urban myth going around that it's poisonous to pets, but if it was I think we'd have heard a lot more about it by now. Unless the cat spends all day doing nothing but walking on the floor and then licking its paws, I don't see how there can be a problem. Almost every product that anyone uses to wash any kind of  floor might be toxic to cats if they drank it, and I've never heard of a cat getting sick from stuff used on a floor.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	I have never heard of Daffodils "killing off" other plants.

You transplanted daffodils.....when?  Now that they are coming up........not the ideal time.  Normally your move the bulbs when they are dormant, that is in the summer.  Still you can transplant daffs now if you dig them up with plenty of soil so as not to damage their roots and move them to a similar soil in your garden.  Time out of the ground should be minimal...minutes, not hours.  <br>  <br>  When did you plant other flowers?  Same time as transplanting the daffs?  I have no clue why the other flowers died unless the soil was not properly prepared, the transplants were not hardened to the weather but came straight from a warm greenhouse, the transplants were allows to dry out........so many possible problems.  <br>  <br>  I'm also wondering about soil disease or insect brought into the garden with the wild daffodils.  The total death of the garden is highly unlikely and impossible in a short time frame.  How long between transplant and death?  Foreign invaders would take a season or more to overcome a garden. <br>  <br>  Too much manure over your garden before planting may have made the soil too salty for anything to grow.  Is this a possibility?

0F8hauikaa	Hibiscus is a fairly large tropical plant with beautiful large blooms. They need lots of water and sunshine, but you'll have to bring it inside if the weather gets to cold since it's a warm weather plant. I have mine inside now but will put it out when it's a bit warmer. Oh sorry, you said no flowers (but you can make tea from these). You could grow a tomato plant in a container and also an herb gardnen. Places like Lowes and Home Depot have starter kits for them.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Home Depot has alot of lil starter plants for the herbs part, then look around to see what to set it in, and a tray so extra water evaporates or recycles in.

If you can buy a started of kale, just one single plant, its very colorful and if you let it go to seed, it stretches up to the sky instead of staying compact like lettuce.|`|X0f444TOaa	Palms need more sun than that to do really well.

One arm of the triangle is the distance from the ladder's foot to the wall. Three feet. The other arm of the triangle with a known distance is the length of the ladder, the hypotenuse. That is 11 feet. <br>  Now, the square of 11 feet is 121. The sum of the the other two sides must equal 121. If the square of three is nine, then you need to find the square root of 112 (121-9=112). That will be the height that the ladder will reach.<br>  It's a bit over ten feet, but hey, you do the math!<br>  :-)|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	a-square + b-square = c-square<br>  <br>  a = length of ladder<br>  <br>  b = distance from wall<br>  <br>  c = distance up the wall<br>  <br>  So the square root of c-sqare will be your final answer|`|yhLGe7nLaa	you would use the pathagory therom<br>  a^2+b^2=c^2<br>  where the ladder is the hypotenuse and the distance from the wall is a leg. your answer is the other leg. <br>  a^2 = leg<br>  b^2 = leg<br>  c^2 = hypotenuse <br>  so you plug in the information that you have<br>  a^2+b^2=c^2<br>  a^2+3^2=11^2<br>  find the squares<br>  a^2+9=121<br>  subtract nine from 121 in order to put a^2 by it's self<br>  a^2=112<br>  find the square root of 112 to find your answer|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	As you have been told you need to use the formula<br>  <br>  (A x A) + (B x B)  = (C x C)  <br>  <br>  This is called the Pythagorean theory  it dates back to the time of the Greeks.  This is a formula that will determine hypotenuse of a right triangle.<br>  <br>  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90 degree angle.<br>  <br>  The "A" and the "B" are the legs of the right triangle the "C" is the hypotenuse (the hypotenuse is the third side - oppisite the right angle) in the formula.<br>  <br>  In your problem you need to determine what is the "A" and the "B" and the "C".  And then you need to solve what is the unknown.   The building and the ground form a right angle, so the legs of the right angle would be the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder and the distance up the wall to the ladder (the reach or the unknown number).  The length of the ladder is the "C".<br>  <br>  So you have     the distance up the wall (unknown) squared plus the distance from the wall squared (3 x 3) that is equal to the length of the ladder squared (11 x 11)   <br>  <br>  in  formula terms    (A x A) + (3 x 3) = (11 x 11)<br>                                   ( A x A) + (9) = (121)<br>                                   (A x A) + (9) -9 = (121) - 9<br>                                   (A x A) = 112<br>                                   ( A x A) = 10.58 (rounded off to 2 digets)|`|7IVEMAg8aa	You would use the Pythagorean theory. a^2 + b^2 = c^2.<br>  <br>  3^2 + b^2 = 11^2<br>  <br>  9 + b^2 = 121<br>  <br>  b^2 = 112<br>  <br>  b = 10.58 rounded.

Sunflowers follow the sun across the sky. Are they planted on either the west or east side of your house?

The longer the guarantee the more costly the shingles.  Some of the metal covers will last longer than that.  If you are buying a house it is a really good idea to get an independent house inspection completed, a reputable inspector should give you a good estimate on how long the roof will last.<br>  <br>  I had mine redone about 15 years ago, and I am careful about walking on it, we live in a snow area and I am careful when I have to clear the snow off of it.  I had talked to a roofer a number of years ago and his recommendation was that if you get a roof repaired that you should always remove the old shingles, that is the only way that they can inspect the sheeting on the roof.  And the other recommendation was when you get the roof done, change the color enough that an old shingle could not be used.  The owner indicated that he had the utmost confidence in his employees, but if they were a couple of shingles short and it was the end of the day and the store was a long way away, that it would be too much of a temptation.  I changed the colour on mine, it was not necessary as they left me a couple of shingles just in case, so it would not have been a problem.|`|RZaPnqzWaa	I had a 20 year roof that lasted 28 years.

hc1fsgDWaa	Hi, If the concrete around the pool is cracked the weeds will not stop coming up in between it.  You might want to think about pulling it up and putting something else down as a walkway and around the pool itself.  You can look in books for ideas or look online.  Many landscapers will put pictures on their website to give ideas of what they can do.  My husband is a hardscaper and his website gives lots of pictures of his work and maybe you can get an idea of what would work in your yard.  www.pridelandcare.com.<br>  You can look in places like Home Depot for outdoor lighting kits.

The trick to a successful application is to know what to include, and how to apply it as it'll be splotchy and look like hell if you don't.<br>  <br>  Using this straight from the can will drive you crazy when using a brush as each stroke that comes in contact with the one before it will grab and be considerably darker then the one before. . . that's the definition of splotchy. If you are going to brush this you need to use a good china bristle brush and add "Penetrol" to the Polyshades to eliminate the lift and drag of this product; the Penetrol will help not only keep a wet edge, but it will promote adhesion if there's a urethane or other clear finish.  Another resource, if you get what's know as fish eye (a what appears to be a water drops marks in the product during or after application) is fish eye eliminator.  Apply a test area without the fish eye remover to see if it is going to be an issue before adding it to the stain.  The Penetrol is a must.  I'm not certain of the pines current condition but I sand the wood finish with #320 paper, vacuum and then tack cloth before applying the stain; you can use what's called "No-Sand" or "Liquid SandPaper", but there's a time application parameter in using these, and really nothing beats actual sanding.  In 9 out of 10 applications I'll spray this job as it provides the best finish.<br>  <br>  Now, all this being said, I'm going to tell you that this is a tough job that requires a professional or professional ability to achieve an architectural grade finish with. I'll help you with it if you feel you want to give it a shot, but, there are other more DIY friendly ways to achieve good aesthetics with this room if you're willing to consider a solid type stain that willbe more like traditional painting for you.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	One thing to check is the outlet(s).<br>  Is it old?<br>  If you plug a two-pronged plug into it,<br>  is it loose?<br>  Or does it fall out easily?<br>  If it is or does,<br>  I would replace the outlet.<br>  Or have it replaced.<br>  It could be creating an arc due to the loose fit.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Wow, I hate to argue with an electrical engineer, but after 40 some odd years in the vac repair business, I can tell you that most of todays full sized uprights, as well as cannisters with a power head will pull right up there at the 12 - 13 amp level when you're using them.   That's 87% of the voltage level of many household service circuits.  That's almost twice what the motors of  most vac's pulled just about 15 years ago.  Also most houses now have a lot more and thicker carpet than they used to, which translates into longer times of usage before shutdown.     When I worked for Electrolux, we used to run vac's on which we had just replaced a cordwinder power cord for approx. 30 - 45 minutes, with the cord extended to full length, so it would warm up enough to flatten out all the kinks and wind up better on the reel.   Any good full sized modern vacuum used for more than just a few minutes sweeping the average home's carpets will get quite warm.   Hot and warm are  relative terms.  Full bags and plugged intake and exhaust filters will make motors run hot, sometimes overheat, all those things need to be checked and serviced if necessary.   As long as the plug meets some resistence when being plugged into and out of the recept, and the recept doesn't appear burned,  I would judge it to be useful as is.|`|d9eb4b5d542ecc86721993f4f20e61f0aa	It is normal for prongs to be warm after extended use. But hot prongs indicate problem.  The cord may also be hot. It indicates that the vacuum is drawing more current than normal.  Open the vacuum to reveal the fan or impeller that sucks in the dust. Remove any belts attached to it and turn it by hand.  It should spin free.  If not then there is some thing stuck in there which causes the motor to spin slower than normal and draws more electric current.  A bad motor bearing will also do the same. Excessive current will cause the plug to become hot. You should service it asap. Extended use may damage the motor even start a fire.|`|V9HNzXFuaa	It probably draws about 12 amps, so yea if you feel the prongs as soon as you shut it off and pull the plug they will be warm.  Just like they are on a toaster, space heater, hair dryer, or anything else that pulls alot of current.
KArPQEWuaa	Even though it is glowing does not mean it is good (igniter). If it does not pass enough amperage it will not ignite. Not to say it's not another problem, but the igniters fail more often than safety valves (a lot more).|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Stu is correct, the igniters may glo brightly and seem to be fine, but if you look closely, you will probably see a very bright spot at some point in the ceramic element.  That usually indicates a crack, which will cause a very high resistance connection.  The connection may still allow the unit to glow, but it won't reach it's proper voltage allowance so the safety valve can open and let the gas through.  Unfortunately, as he says, it's a guessing game.  The only way to know for sure which it is, is to replace one or the other.  The igniter is much easier to replace than the valve, so that's what most people replace first, and it's usually the problem.    If you're thinking of replacing this on your own, you would, of course, need the make and model of the unit, then find a good major appliance parts supply company in or close to your town. Call them and they should be able to supply the part.   Depending on the brand, the igniters usually run between $40 - $75.|`|sXwrL1GIaa	this is a safety device that could mean a number of things 1 there is a small gas leak in the cooker 2its getting two hot<br>  3 the safety sensor is not working properly|`|W7J5udmHaa	got gas? maybe clogs,better to repair  right away .  as that dangerious|`|CwXe7OgIaa	EEEK, a ghost!

Then on a next occasion use a white or semitransparent sheet and make some intricate designs on the inner surface so that its visible from underneath and cover the top of your gazebo with a vine or very light coloured plants that would give a green hue to the whole thing yet if the plants are tropical or evergreen ones the colour too won't run out.<br>  <br>  If you got the idea of what I just said explain it to me as well.... :D just kidding.

DxIQJ5m2aa	Consult with an agent at the cooperative extension office to see what grass will grow best or if you should sod. Either way you go with seed or sod, you will need to spray to kill the weeds that are there a few times. Till it up and rake out the dead growth and spray again to get the ones you missed. At this point it might be a good idea to install a pop up sprinkler system. Then seed or sod. In your zone it would be best to do this during the fall as not to scorch your new lawn in the heat of the summer. Good luck.|`|ZPcCcONNaa	Keep spraying with weed killer - when new growth appears again spray again. Then have yard dug over - lay fresh loamy soil and have seeded keeping water up to it until it is 4-5 cms long. Keep kids and pets off until established.

UNUJNgHxaa	First off are you talking about a portable generator or a permanently  mounted one? If it is a portable one, then they have what is called a "floating" ground. There-for they do not need to be grounded. If it is going to be a fixed generator you will need to read the specification to see if or how to ground it for your particular needs. Some generators only need to be grounded from the casing to the frame. Other will need to have the internal leads grounded to the frame of the trailer.Some will need to have a "bonded" ground.(a rod directly in the Earth) Make sure you read and understand the instructions on proper grounding. If you have the instructions that is great. If not you can do a "Google" search with the brand and model. Most instructions are posted on the web. I hope this helps and good luck to you.|`|AA10051049	The owner's manual for my generac says to use a rod driven into the ground and attach a #12 wire to it and the generator.

944iJNAdaa	Seeds only have so much energy in them, and that energy has to be strong enough to push the young plants out of the ground and still open leaves up so they can start receiving sunlight and produce energy on their own.  If seeds are buried too deep they won't have enough energy to emerge and still open leaves up, so they die instead.

AA11498082	Do the stems get long?  That's called "leggy" they're reaching for sun.  South windows are best for starting seedlings, otherwise invest in "grow lights" to augment the light inside.  Legginess tends to encourage damping off as algold said.|`|mzNLIK5Taa	I'm no expert, but one problem i can think of is that you may be watering too much and the small plants are dying from damping off. which is a fungus that kills seedlings. <br>  <br>  Or it could just be that the conditions aren't right for the plant to grow. maybe it isn't the right soil or the plants aren't being drained properly.|`|zKn9IXygaa	The indoor method<br>  <br>  Seeds that are planted directly in soil outdoors often have a slim chance of survival. Many gardeners prefer to sow their flower seeds indoors, where they can be watched over and nurtured. There are a number of other reasons why starting seeds indoors is a wise choice:<br>  <br>      * Growing season. In many areas, the growing season is shorter than the time needed for a plant to produce flowers. If sown indoors, gardeners are able to get a jump start and plant flowers that are not native to the area. If you live in an area where late winter seems to never end, starting seeds indoors will ensure they aren't killed off in an early spring frost.<br>  <br>      * Bloom time. When given a head start, many types of flowers begin to bloom earlier than if they were planted outdoors. Marigolds, for example, are a true testament to this.<br>  <br>      * Healthier seedlings. Creating a controlled and nurturing environment for seeds helps them to become healthy and stronger plants. You can guard against leggy seedlings if you're keeping a close watch indoors.<br>  <br>      * Controlling Damping Off disease. White mold is apt to form on the top of soil in cold, damp, dark weather, which will wilt seedlings and eventually kill them. Kept indoors, this disease can be eliminated by keeping seedlings in direct sunlight, allowing soil to dry, increasing air circulation, and removing existing mold.<br>  <br>  Sowing your (indoor) seeds<br>  <br>  There are many indoor resources to help your little ones get going.<br>  <br>      * Seed-starting kits. These magnificent creations have made the world of gardening that much easier. Seed-starting kits usually consist of some sort of bio dome or miniature greenhouse, which includes a bottom tray and vented, clear plastic top, and seedling food. Trays are divided into individual cells, where seeds are planted. Some even include individual sponges or disks, which expand in water, with holes intended for one seed.<br>  <br>      * Grow lights. Although many flower seeds germinate in the dark, once seedlings emerge, they'll need plenty of light. Grow lights can ensure your seedlings continued health, particularly if you don't have a south facing window to place them in. They are also essential on dark, cloudy days, and can be used at night.<br>  <br>      * Plant food. There are usually enough nutrients in soil to keep seeds happy, but a few days after they become seedlings, consider adding a bit of fertilizer. While you don't want to overfeed the plant, giving it a little boost can ensure healthy growth.<br>  <br>  Making the move<br>  <br>  Once your seedlings' roots have started to come out of the bottom of the pot or container, it's time to plant them outdoors. They are also ready to be transplanted if allowed 6 to 8 weeks indoors, the typical time frame recommended for indoor sowing. Of course, weather conditions must be right as well. Most flower seedlings shouldn't be taken outdoors until after the last frost. Any earlier, and you run the risk of cold weather killing off your hard work!<br>  <br>  Here are some tips for making the big move:<br>  <br>      * Let flower seedlings acclimate gently to the outdoors. Put them outside on cloudy days or in the shade. After a few days, give them more light and exposure.<br>  <br>      * Plant new growth while skies are overcast or in the late afternoon. Water immediately after transplanting.<br>  <br>      * Provide protection for flower seedlings, such as an empty milk carton, especially in windy areas or if seedlings wilt.

Read the owners manuel, or, if ya ain't got one, it should be on the back of the dishwasher on the wiring diagram.|`|frUYhmuYaa	READ THE NAMEPLATE!|`|ispQWeQmaa	Dishwashers are rated by something called the Energy Factor, which refers to how many full loads of dishes the dishwasher can do using the energy equivalent of 1 kilowatt hour (kwh) of energy. This rating includes both the electricity used within the dishwasher itself, to run the pumps and to heat the water hotter than it went into the dishwasher (if indeed it's programmed to do that) along with the energy used to heat the water. The Energy Factor assumes your hot water is heated with electricity just to make it easier to understand, but of course if you heat your hot water with natural gas you'll use less electricity than the Energy Factor suggests, but more natural gas. Either way it will cost you about the same.<br>  <br>  Standard sized dishwashers are required by law in the US to have an Energy Factor of at least 0.46, which means you can do 0.46 loads per kwh, in other words it takes 2.2 kwh per load. However ENERGY STAR rated standard dishwashers use at least 41% less energy than that, so their energy factor is at least 0.65 (1.53 kwh per load) and can be as high as 1.29 (0.78 kwh per load).<br>  <br>  Compact dishwashers have a higher energy factor (minimum 0.62, minimum ENERGY STAR rated unit 0.88) which is higher because you can wash more loads of a compact for the same energy, since they hold a smaller load. But the highest rating for a compact dishwasher is only 1.39, which means 0.71 kwh per load - not much better than the most efficient standard unit.<br>  <br>  Multiply any of the above kwh per load figures by 215 and you get what the US Department of Energy / EPA assumes is the average number of kilowatt hours per year consumed by a dishwasher with the corresponding energy factor.|`|nKnc90jnaa	Dishwasher -  110 - 120 volt, 60 hertz, properly grounded circuit protected by a minimum 15 amp breaker or fuse ( d/w without temp boost ) to a maximum of 20 amp breaker or fuse ( d/w with temp boost ) #14 gauge house wire minimum for 15 amp protection, #12 gauge is a must for 20 amp protection.

d3bcf10988f72679c3f0ec76ca9003cfaa	It is much easier to use regular lightweight spackle. Bondo is excellent, but if you haven't used it before you can run into problems. Use a putty knife and make sure to fill cracks or blemishes fully. Sanding spackle is much easier, and maintains a good bond with your baseboards. Do you have a stud finder ? From the floor up you have about 1 1/2 inches of wood behind the sheetrock to nail to, and if you can find the wood studs in the wall you can nail the upper portions there. Generally when nailing baseboard you don't have to put any adhesive under the moulding itself. you will have to put a bead of caulking on top where it meets the sheetrock. You do not need to pre drill the baseboard, just be careful getting go close to edges as it may split. Hope this helps a bit !! By the way -- don't worry much about the manufacturer of the caulking -- it is probably from home depot or lowes !!!!|`|t1NTGuIZaa	If the painters dinged it up so easily, the base could be made out of that cheap foam wrapped in a vinyl sticker.

You may still have a warranty on the compressor part, That is what it sounds like it might be.<br>  866-698-2538 Little known secret: They are open on Sunday 9-5.|`|V9HNzXFuaa	If the compressor is running and its not cooling at all, your refrigerant (as you call freon) has leaked out.  Its possible to have it recharged, but depending on the age of the fridge it may not be worth the cost.|`|ispQWeQmaa	First, try pulling the fridge away from the wall and checking that there is no dust build up on the back bottom where the compressor is (although as you say, it is super clean). Also check that you haven't boxed the fridge too tightly into a space where heat can't flow away from it.<br>  <br>  It would not be a thermostat problem if the fridge runs continuously and doesn't cool. If the thermostat were busted and it was running continually, the fridge would be very cold. The cause might be low refrigerant level, poorly functioning compressor, or dusty coils.<br>  <br>  If a simple check for dust or confined space doesn't solve the problem, you should get a service technician to look at the fridge. It might cost you a few bucks but it's a lot cheaper than trying to fix the fridge yourself, breaking it instead, and then having to buy a new one. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if the fridge is over 10 years old, just get a new, ENERGY STAR rated one - you'll save a lot on energy costs, and save on the service call!|`|3dcf409a3a6a5d9a307c95262503adafaa	Your refrigerant (freon) is low so your refrigerator is not cooling.

5jMNBO2naa	The minimum drain pipe size for a clothes washer is 2 inches and the minimum drain pipe size for a kitchen sink is 1 1/2 inches.  You could either upsize the drain pipe for the washer to a 2 inch drain with a 1 1/2 inch vent through the roof that would accomodate both fixtures, or install  separate 1 1/2 inch drain line for the new kitchen sink  with a 1 1/4 vent through the roof.

V9HNzXFuaa	I think your evaporator coil needs cleaned.  It can get  a buildup of mildew on it over time, which will smell bad when the cooling is running because the coil is wet.  When the heat is on, the moisture dries, hence there is no stink coming off of it.  Then when you fire up the AC again, the coil starts collecting condensation and the smell comes back.

BVJBY4eQaa	Using household products, cheap supermarket cleaners and 'old wives' remedies are very short sighted when it comes to cleaning and caring for leather and can become very costly in the long run as problems they generally cause will be costly to put right. (although it does keep people like ourselves busy as we rush round fixing problems caused by using the wrong things!!!)<br>  Firstly check the type of leather you have so that you understand the results that are possible:<br>  <a href="http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/whatkind..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/whatkind...</a><br>  <br>  You need to use a good quality water based foam leather cleaner. (LTT Leather Shampoo) With light coloured leather dye transfer from clothing can be a problem although using a good quality leather protector (LTT Leather Protect) will help inhibit this. <br>  <br>  For dye transfer (which can be a real problem on pale coloured leathers) and ingrained dirt you may need a much stronger cleaner like Strong Cleaner or Maxi Cleaner (this should be used with caution)<br>  <br>  DO NOT use anything containing oils, waxes or silicones. (Most 'conditioners' contain waxes or oils) and furniture polish (pledge) contains silicones which will eventually destroy the finish on the leather. Most car cleaners also contain oils or waxes so should not be used as they leave residues on the surface of the leather which attract more dirt which eventually leads to cracking.<br>  <br>  BABY WIPES are the worst thing you can use as they will destroy the finish on your leather. This has been verified and proved to be the case. They are actually a very strong product and this is why they break down the finish. Leather is not like skin and should not be treated as such.<br>  <br>  Saddle soap should never be usd on upholstery leather or garments it is meant for saddles which are very different from todays finished leathers.<br>  <br>  A lot of leather wipes contain chemicals which will also destroy the finish or leave residues on the leather which will damage it. They are not cheap in the long run as you would need a lot to clean. A bottle of foam cleaner should do your car about 3-4 times.<br>  <br>  Fairy liquid contains more salt these days to get dishes clean and this will break the finish down on your leather. This has been verified by the manufacturers (as with the baby wipes).<br>  <br>  Magic Erasers should not be used unless you are going to renew the finish on you r leather. We have tested these recently and they sand away the top finish on the leather.<br>  <br>  Lux flakes (although they used to be a good thing to use) now contain ingredients that will damage the finish on the leather and cause it to peel off like a skin (we have seen these happen hundreds of times at customers who have been ill advised by shops)<br>  <br>  You should also follow cleaning with a good water based leather protector which will act like a 'scotchgard' and inhibit dirt and stains from being absorbed and make cleaning easier the next time. Conditioners are totally unnecessary and only a product push by manufacturers.<br>  <br>  Dry leather needs rehydrating with water and oils and waxes should not be used as the natural oils do not dry out of leather. Wiping over with a damp cloth regularly will help to do this. <br>  <br>  It is important to maintain a regular cleaning regime cleaning dirt off the surface regularly and inhibiting the absorption of body oils into the leather with a protector is the best way of doing this. The only 'moisturizer' a leather needs is from water.<br>  <br>  The alternative is a brand new product on the market called Lazy Leather. This is the latest technology in cleaning and combines an effective cleaner with a protector. It is quick and easy to use and should be used as a maintenance product once your suite has been cleaned or from new if you have just bought it.<br>  <br>  Using incorrect care products is usually the cause of deterioration in the leather as unfortunately most car care products contain waxes and oils or silicones which do not do the leather any good.<br>  <br>  Further cleaning instructions and a care leaflet are available here:<br>  <a href="http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/freecare..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/freecare...</a>

944iJNAdaa	One method is to rototill ground up crab or shrimp shells into the soil, there's something in the Chiten that makes up these shells that repels or kills nematodes, I'm not sure which.  I first read of this a few years ago.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  To Granny below;<br>  <br>  There are many pest nematode species, with root knot nematodes being probably the worst.  Not every nematode is a beneficial nematodes, and beneficial nematodes generally prey on insects, not other nematodes.  Here's more information:<br>  <a href="http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/nematode.html" rel="nofollow">http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/nematode...</a>|`|4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	Not sure why you would want to?<br>  <br>  Nematodes, commonly referred to as 'beneficial nematodes' or 'predatory nematodes,' are microscopic worms. Beneficial nematodes control insect and grub populations by infecting the host, usually a grub or insect larvae. Nematodes carry bacteria that break down the internal structure of the host (grub or larvae) through enzymes. Death of the host occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Beneficial nematodes enter through the skin or an orifice on the larvae, mature, and lay their eggs. Once nematode eggs hatch, the young nematode larvae feed on the broken down interior of the insect larvae. Beneficial nematodes go through four stages of growth and exit the host body during their third stage of maturation to begin the cycle again.<br>  <br>  Predatory nematodes infect a very wide variety of lawn parasites (over 200 larval insect species) and will kill most of the larval insects invading an organic lawn. As beneficial insect larvae are usually faster moving and more active, they are seldom the victims of nematodes. Earthworms are not parasitized by nematodes. Predatory nematodes occur naturally and are **not considered a threat to humans and pets***<br>  as there is no evidence that they can survive and develop inside such a host.<br>  They can help get rid of grubs<br>  <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/organicdefense" rel="nofollow">http://www.doityourself.com/stry/organic...</a>|`|XTmiI44laa	I believe Marigolds help,try the companion planting site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.no-dig-vegetablegarden.com/companion-planting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.no-dig-vegetablegarden.com/co...</a>
