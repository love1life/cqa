20090202162005AAq7U0g	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What does he think of me?	Sorry in advance for this being so long but I'd really appreciate your help. THANKS!      Theres this guy and I didn't really talk to him until at the beginning of the school year we became lab partners for a project. I got to know him and he seemed nice. I knew I was gonna end up liking him. A little while later, we started to fight about EVERYTHING. We said we hated each other, everything.      So, then I realized I liked him but I didn't want to admit it. (He doesn't have a girlfriend and he hasn't had one recently.) We became partners all the time, not by choice and we fought all the time. But then sometimes he'd be super nice. It was weird. In biology, sometimes we move the desks to watch movies and we'd always fight for the same spot. We got in trouble with the teacher once and we both laughed so hard. I got over him over winter break, but then I started to like him again. He became friends with my friends but not really me. And we still say we hate each other but he starts conversations with me when we're alone. It's weird.      My friends say he doesn't hate me but I don't understand why he'd say it if he didn't mean it. They also say we're like an old married couple, that we're cute and funny when we fight but I don't notice it. One of my friends and my mom thinks he likes me but they really don't know (the friend is in my bio class with me).      So I hate him, everything he does annoys me, but I still like him. He's driving me insane. I just found out we're going to partners again, I think for the sixth time. Does he like me? How can I make him like me? I can't flirt and I'm sorta shy. Not shy as in quiet, shy as in scared or risks. Any advice at all would help.      Thanks again!      Also, on my birthday my friends got the entire biology class to sing to me. It was so awkward. But then, one of my friends was like, "Hey,(his name), want to sing another round with me." And she started singing and we didn't think he'd sing. But he did. It was awkward.

20090202135542AAC9qkR	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What should the title of this paper be?	Hey guys, I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with ideas for the title of this papar...I'd really appreciate all and any ideas you can come up with. It can be whatever you think fits the paper.      Here's the paper:         “I hate winter,” are the three words that I hear most from November to February, since I was born into a summer-loving family. Whether it’s because of the freezing temperatures, piles of snow, or the slick roads, there’s always one bad thing that you can find about the season. But I think there’s something sort of enchanting about winter too. The snow blankets everything in a sparkling sheath of white, making the world seem brand-new.    But, unfortunately, not everyone sees winter the way I do. Most people find the sludgy sleet and ice an annoyance, just another bad thing to add to their day. And after Christmas, people’s bank accounts probably aren’t quite as full as they once were, which doesn’t exactly bring the winter cheer either. For the most part, winter is just an overall depressing time for people.    But it doesn’t have to be.    On my way to the bus stop one frigid January morning, I passed a neighbor’s house and did a double-take. There was a little colony of flowers sprouted in her yard, despite the 8 inches of snow surrounding them. I walked over to take a closer look, and saw that they weren’t really what they seemed to be. Up close, the flowers were withered and brittle, fragile. I was afraid that if I touched them, they’d all snap off their stems.     That day at school, I couldn’t get the flowers off of my mind. I wondered how they could still be upright among all of the snow, in the below-zero weather. My grandmother plants flowers in her garden, and they only last through spring and summer, usually not fall, and definitely not winter. But the other flowers really gave me a feeling of hope and inspiration. They seemed to say, I am stronger than I appear. Those flowers seemed invincible to me.    So, to all the people that find winter just dreadful, just think about this: If those flowers can make it through the winter, you can too.

20090202140013AA6JKAg	Education & Reference;Homework Help	The Great expectation essay - Could you check?	Hi :) Could you look thought my essay and correct my possible mistakes? What do you think about it? Does it makes sense?      "The Great expectation is one of Charles Dickens most popular novels. It tells the story of a young boy called pip. Charles Dickens wrote "Great Expectations" using the technique of telling the story through the main character – Pip. By using the first person Pip tells what is happening to himself throughout the novel. It makes the reader feel sympathy and encourages them to find out what happens next and to read on. This technique also enables the reader to share Pips feelings, and struggles in life Pip is the nickname of main character. It is a shorter form of farther family name (Philip) and his Christian name Pirrip.   The main character described in the novel as a small, intelligent and in my opinion maybe a little bit childish boy because as I mentioned before he calls himself Pip. Dickens creates sympathy for Pip straight away in the beginning chapter story when we find out that he is poor, his parents are dead. That is shown in "as I never saw my father or mother".      From the first chapter we have learned that the story is located in Victorian time and Pip comes form Victorian families. The Victorian time was much different compare to today's world. There was a huge difference between rich and poor. The poor people worked under a inhumane working conditions, they expected to work long hours in dangerous conditions. Personally, I think that Charles Dickens was influenced by Victorian time when he was writing this story.  During the Victorian time it was very difficult to survive and many people were dying due to disease and hunger.       We do not know Pip’s parents because they died, probably soon after his Pip’s birth. He has never saw his father and mother and he lives with his sister and her husband.      The convict appears suddenly and he is very rude and violent. His appearance makes an unexpected start to the story. The man, dressed in a prison uniform with, grabes Pimp and he was shaking him upside down, emptying his pockets. Dickens describes the convict using powerful word which immediately grabs the readers attention. This meeting is kind of dramatic because the convict is scaring Pimp. That is shown in “I’ll cut your throat”, “show me where you live”, “turned me upside-down “. The main character, Pimp sees this meeting with the convict very fearfully and in very horrific way. This is adding excitement to the story and makes it very enjoyable to the reader because the opening chapter of the novel effectively describes the emotions and feelings of the characters in the story. Dickens also use lots of exclamation marks in the text to suggest the harshness of convict and pips anxiety. When the convict appears, Dickens describes him using powerful word which immediately grabs the readers attention and makes the novel appealing for the reader.       The language of the convict is very rude and un educated “little devil”,“you young dog”,“I couldn’t eat ’em” and “what fat cheeks you ha’got”. Pip’s language is more polite and educated which is shown in “O! Don’t cut my throat, sir”, “Pip. sir”. Pip was calling the convict “sir” to show that  he respect him.      Personally I think Dickens was succeed in making the first chapter interesting and exciting for the reader because Dickens skillfully catches the reader's attention and sympathy in the first paragraphs. The opening chapter is imminently engaging reader to read the whole story."

20090202202310AAZQ7Xi	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How should I handle rude 5th and 6th graders with no respect for the leader?	I work in after-school care with kids 3rd grade through 6th, just watching them after school until their parents come pick them up. The kids have always loved me because I'm more of a friend and they can tell me things easily. Well today, I came to work wearing dressier clothing than I usually wear. Two girls, a 5th and a 6th grader started asking me questions. I told them I had a presentation at school before work and the 5th grader started saying my pants didn't match and my top should have been made a different way...etc. etc. OK not trying to brag or anything but I've grown up in the fashion industry and this was a really cute, funky, professional looking outfit and it looked really flattering on me. Many people said I looked good today. Well I just shrugged these girls off and sat with some other kids but I noticed the girls quietly speaking about me to eachother. I couldn't hear exactly what they were saying but I knew it was rude, something about how it made me look fat, it didn't match, etc. They did this for about 10 minutes until I went to them, calmly and collected. I told them that where I was sitting, I could hear them and if they weren't being polite, they needed to keep their comments to themselves. The 5th grader looked really nervous and the 6th grader's jaw dropped to the ground. I walked away and kept my distance the rest of the shift, which wasn't very long. Now, I'm not sure how to act when I see them again. Should I just ignore them and stop "girl talking" and being friendly with them like I usually am? Generally we all sit together and play games and have a good time. I know these girls have disrespectful and rude personalities but it was never towards me, until now. If I make them apologize or have a talk with them, they'll just think I'm stupid like a normal 5th or 6th grade attitude. I'm hurting over this because I think they will grow up to be mean adults, kind of like how you'd view the "popular kids" in junior high. That's exactly how they act and they always have. I'm not sure if it's my place to change their personalities and I don't know if I even could.

I was in the cafeteria and I had my money and the prices gone up and I was confused because I didn't know about this. When she told me, I said "Mother!" to my friend, as in crap, but didn't add the f***er at the end. She said I was using extremely foul language, although I didn't say it loud and it was only to my friend. She then refused to let me buy lunch and later told my friend that I had a $20 so it shouldn't matter how much money lunch costs.       My question is, is it allowed to withhold lunch from children? She has done this to my group of friends many times and seems to have a sort of resentment towards us. My friend, who is an idiot, observed once that "This place looks like a cafeteria," and she kicked him out without letting him buy food and attempted to not let him buy food from the cafeteria anymore. Another friend, she screamed at for doing nothing, and mentioned "grandmother" many times. I just want to know if she is allowed to do this?

The student can be the taxpayer, taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's dependent. It does not matter whether the expenses were paid by cash, check, credit card, or with borrowed funds. The student does not need to be enrolled in a degree program or attend full-time.    Tuition payments for a course of study leading to a post baccalaureate or other graduate degree do not qualify.    Qualified tuition expenses also do not include:    - Tuition paid through the receipt of scholarships or financial aid. (However, student loans or grants to be repaid do qualify.)

I have done a bit but i would really appreciate some advice. Im kind of stuck but the idea is, Charles dies so Fred kills himself. But i dont know what to do next or how to make it really sad.       The Ambassador sat behind his desk in his study. As always on a weekday afternoon, while everyone else belived him to be in an "impotant metting with very impotant people" he was playing Space Invaders on his new computer, the sound down, the door locked and his mind switched off. Charles Maroway, or Charlie as he liked to call himself,had a big, round,face with bright red, chubby cheaks. He was a very kind man who reminds you instantly of Santa Claus, minus the beard. Mr Maroway has been the british ambasador for Switzerland for 16 years and has been the most popular in the Embassy. 10 years previous to being embassador, Charles married Vivian West, the previous Cannadian Prime Minister's daughter, who belived herself to be very important. Vivain was quite thin with pale skin like leather boots, a big nose and thin lips, who gave you an overall impression of a very rude horse. The Maroway's had two children. The oldest, Philip, was very reveared by his mother, he was by far her favourite, so much in fact, that the youngest, Fred , was dispissed by his mother. Philip was very intelligent, winning every award a 12 year old could possibly win. As much as Vivian would agure, Philip was a very rude and aggorant boy. Fred, anxious to be in the same room at the same time as Philip, hated him. A day didnt go bye when Philip didnt rub one of his latest acomplishes in fred's face. "I just won ANOTHER National Science Fair, and what did you get? A lollie-pop and a pat on the head of Father? You know as well as i do he only does that out of pity!" Philip said laughing meanly, after Vivian left the kitchen. Fred tried not to listen as he fought back tears. charles has always favoured Fred, in fact sometimes it seemed like he could'nt really care how many awards Philip won and he really was tired of hearing about it. But Fred had often wondered if it WAS out of pity, if he only ever spoilt Fred because he flet sorry for him, because Philip was so well liked by everyone while Fred went by unotticed.         I would really like it if you could give me some advice on things i should change (not spelling and grammar, ill do that later) Im really, really stuck so all help will be very appreciated!!!!

My political philosophy professor has helped me tremendously and I have a great deal of respect for him.  I smoke and so does he and the last few times I have run into him before class I have either just ran out of cigarettes or left the in the car, etc... and he always lets me bum one off of him.  I felt a little rude for that...      I went to the smoke shop before school today for my own cigarettes and thought that I would replace the pack that has "lent" me.  The cigarettes he smokes are the cheapest floor sweepings ever and you cannot even buy them by the pack, only by the carton - they are still DIRT cheap.  So I just bought the carton and dropped the whole thing in his mail slot outside his office because I am not going to smoke those nasty things anyway.      He sent me an email saying "thank you" but to NOT do that again because he doesn't mind helping his students.  I felt that the mood of the email was that he was insulted or thought it inappropriate to buy a teacher something.  I didn't' mean anything by it and the last thing I would do is insult the man.  I feel like I was rude while my intentions were nothing but good and thought it was no big deal.  Am I worrying too much or do you think he's insulted?

20090202143407AAESH3E	Education & Reference;Teaching	Anyone have a HOT teacher?	I'm 18, in grade 12 at my high school. My Bio teacher also taught me when I was in grade 9. He's 25 and SO hot. I mean girls, if you saw this man... you would love him. He dresses so nice, is perfectly built and has the nicest smile. Anyway, I walked into his class at the start of the second semester and I hadn't seen him since grade 9 cause my school is really big.    So I was late for my class and I knocked on the door and he came out and shut the door. He's like Hey, your a little late. I was like yeah sorry. He's like woah Brooke is that you? Wow you look a lot older. I was like ya its been a while. And he kept smiling at me.    And everyday now he always comes up to my desk and talks to me. Like he's 25 and so HOT and I can't handle being in his class because he's so good looking. Anyone else out there with the same problem?
20090202165044AAB45Gk	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What do you know about these colleges? ?	Reed, Columbia, NYU, Harvard, Stanford, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, UPenn.       Those are the ones I'm looking at right now. I'm a sophomore in high school, and my GPA is 5.0, I think. I took the ACT three years ago, and my composite score was 30. I'm playing tennis this year and probably will continue to do so for the rest of high school. I'm not especially good though. The extent of my service activities comes from clubs like Interact, Mu Alpha Theta, and National Spanish Honors Society. I think I want to do something with writing or international business, but that can change. I really don't think I'll do medicine, though.       I know it's early, and I'm probably coming off as an arrogant little snot, but I'd love to hear your opinions on these colleges, especially if you've applied to them or you attend them or have attended them. Any other advice about anything would be adored and cherished and loved and cared for, I promise. =)       Thank you!

I live in Pennsylvania, and I would really like to go to Temple University in Philidelphia, Penn State University (main campus), University of Texas @ Austin (main campus), or Brown University (Ivy) to major in either Journalism or Athletic Training.    I was just wondering which colleges you think I could qualify for and what I could do more to better my chances of getting in. I am currently at the top 56% of my class, and I have a 3.2 GPA, so I am very close to meeting those requirements. Now I have two and a half more years of high school, to higher grades and do all of the stuff.       Here are my current overall grades for my classes this year:      Desktop Publishing - 96%   Comp. English 10 - 88%   Journalism I - 95%   Physical Education - 95%   Health 10 - 89%   Family and Consumer Science 10 - 86%   Geometry - 85%   Chorus - 98%   Physical Science - 83%   U.S. History II Honors - 80%      Also, I know colleges like their students to be involved in extraciricular activites, and I am involve in a few.....      -I was an Assistant Counselor at a children's summer camp for two years.   -I'm in my church's youth group.   -I'm a journalist for my high school's newspaper.   -I'm hoping to become sports editor of my school's newspaper, next year (so this one doesn't count yet).   -I'm in the SADD Club at my school.   -I'm a manager for my high school's wrestling team.   -I'm going to be joining my high school's tennis team this year.   -I'm finally going to be a Student Intern Athletic Trainer for my school's baseball team.   Now I know that Brown is an Ivy League School and that Penn State and the University of Texas at Austin Main Campuses are really good schools that have a lot of competition to get intp.      Which of the colleges abover do you think I could easily get into?

I was recently diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. It is a circadian disorder that prevents me from getting more than 2 hours of sleep a night. It set in in the beginning of my freshman year and it has had an awful effect on my grades. I used to be an all A student but have been getting B's and mostly C's for my high school career thus far. With a debilitating effect on a sufferer's life function being a known factor of the disorder, do you think colleges would take that into consideration when looking at my grades from freshman and half of sophomore year?   Now that I am on a prescription and receiving light therapy, my grades are returning to normal. I'm just nervous that this has ruined my chances for getting accepted.
