There was this guy ho used to talk to me all the time during marching band but once the season ended he would definitely see me and notice me, he look at me several times, but never say a word to me. I was starting to like him but I figured if he wasn't going to talk to me I wasn't going to bother with him, so I told myself I was over him, but last night I had a dream about him and in it, he told me he liked me and I had that feeling deep in my stomach(the kind when you like someone), and I liked him back. What does this mean? Does this mean I still like him?

20090131171114AAbIEvM	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Reallyyy bad deam... please help?	im 14 years old, im a freshman (girl), i have been goin through a lot lately, with parents and other issues. i am very intereste in philosophy but i think i have foun myself in a "philosophical trap". ummm i kind of depressed right now, i have a lot on my mind. on of my reallyy close friends is suicidal.. and that bothers too. umm i don't have a best friend now. i had a few before but they all leave.. and i feel i don't need one. just close friends is fine for me. well that descibes enough i guess for now but on to the point of this . i had a reallyyy bad bad dream the other day. i told my friend about it, and she told me it is like a horror movie. well on to my dream, it started like:      a bunch of friends and i were in a lake over the summer and we were swimming and having a blast. the group of friends that i was with was rather strange because it was old friends that are no longer friends to me, and reallyyyy close friends. so as we were swimming in the lake one of my friends went missing, we were looking for her and then there was red in the water. then a body floated to the top and she was dead. everyone screamed and ran out of the water and into the woods. and someone else went missing, there was a path of blood and we followed it and saw another friend dead.. and then like one by one everyone kept dissapearing and dying.. one by one. so then it was me and one person (who i consider my closest friend but im not her closest friend.. im 14 she's 15) left we are scared to death, and somewhere we found a sword lying in the grass... the thing that was killing everyone finally came out.. and we killed that "thing" whatever it was.. and you would think problem over right.. wrong. so me and my last friend that isn't dead were walking..we were lost had no idea where we were going. and we ended up on the top of some clift... and inside the canyon.. was a longgg drop and a small lake (the one we were swimming in before) at the bottom.. that just happened to be a redish color. and you could see bodies floating in the lake... my friends that were killed.. and my friend and me saw it.. i started crying.. and backing away from the clift side.. and then i start talking to my friend... saying not living is better then living life without friends... and my friend is like what the eff are you talking about you can't be serious and so on.. and then my friend runs to try and grab me but i started running.. so it's basically a race to the edge of the clift... and i get a foot off of the clif then my friend ended up grabbing my arm just in time before it was too late. and i was crying in her arms on the floor with her and then my friend just gave me a long talk and i think it pretty much ended there.      it was like through out the whole dream.. the friends killed we in the order that they were no longer friends with me.. and when it was over i just woke up crying like ohhh my gosh that was sooo crazyyy. any ideas on it? and help is very much appreciated, thank you
20090131145706AAf1S95	Social Science;Psychology	Is there such a thing as being psychic? Or having a 6th sense or intuition? Or is it Senory integration?	Is there such a thing as being psychic? Or having a 6th sense or intuition? Or is it Senory integration?   Okay, I want your thoughts.      I am 14, and I have a remarkable intuition, and strong senses.      Such as the time I have twice predicted pregnancies long before announcements, and even before they were showing. In one case, I hadn't seen the woman in months, and my little brother mentioned her, and I said, "She's pregnant, isn't she?" "No, I don't think so." for a month I thought so, and then the week before, I was telling everyone I had a strange urge she was pregnant. The night before she announced she was pregnant, I had a dream she was pregnant. (The funny thing is she got pregnant a week after she got married...)      I also have deja vu around 5-6 times a week. It is sometimes classes, conversations, or events that are oddly familiar.      When I was little, maybe 5 years old, my grandpa came to me in a dream. He died in 1986, and I was born in 1994, so there was no chance I ever met him. The dream had remarkable detail, and he was wearing the outfit he wore a lot (I never had seen a photo of it) and I had a conversation with him.      I also have hyperactive senses. I can hear light, and my senses are strong. I have an amazing sense of smell. One time, my mom made a TV dinner, and I hadn't seen it. I was in the other room, and I smelled it as she was eating it. I wasn't facing her, and I said, "Okay mom, you're eating chicken. Oh, and I also smell broccoli, and Potatoes? Wait, you can have potatoes on your diet?" I walked into the room, and she said, "Look at the food in my container." I had guessed every single item by the smell from the other room.       I also hear a lot, I can listen to many conversations and noises at a time. I am constantly saying, "Oh my goodness, I love this song!" in a crowded restaurant, while in a conversation, so people have to change the focus to MAYBE hear it, and I constantly hear both.      I am currently in the process of obtaining Sensory Integration testing (per my mother's request for schooling help), but I was wondering if this can be something more.

Enriquece a quienes la reciben, sin empobrecer a quienes la dan.                No dura más que un instante, pero su recuerdo aveces es eterno.                        Nadie es demasiado rico para prescindir de ella.                        Nadie es demasiado pobre para no merecerla.                      Da felicidad en el hogar y apoyo en el trabajo.                               Es el simbolo de la amistad.                            Una sonrisa da reposo al cansado.                             Anima a los más deprimidos.   No se puede comprar, ni prestar, ni robar,pues es una cosa que no tiene valor, hasta el momento en que se da.   Y si alguna vez se tropieza con alguien que no sabe dar una sonrisa más, se generoso y dale la tuya.   Porque nadie tiene más necesidad de una sonrisa que el que no pueda dársela a los demás.

Hey, i am writing a research paper for my child welfare class and we were asked to pick any topic that we might not know a lot about.  It can be a policy, type of abuse, or anything else to do with child welfare.  Does anyone have good ideas?        I have to talk about it in the past present and future and also on a local, statewide, and national level.      Any suggestions would be really helpful - thanks!

20070323122618AAGP4zL	Social Science;Psychology	Emos; a result of supressed anger?	ok so emo stands for emotional right. and i was wondering how, psychologyically, do people become emo?   is it from childhood experiences or is it just their characteristics? is it genetical?! jk.       and ive got a view point that emo does not only mean cutting wrists and blacking the eyes, and do i have anyone agreeing with me; is this true?    i think emos are just people who can be emotionally connected/attached to anything like music, people (interaction), society (big scale), etc. AND, does the slightest of expressing their 'emo' side through art and/or is seen by how they act towards things. resulting SOMETIMES isolation (in any way mentally or socially or whatever) from a common group of friends. (because theyre such deep, thoughtful, emotional people)      do you guys get that? (i suck at explaining, so any biased remark is welcome, i just wanna know what the world thinks)      thanks!

20090131163723AAoApFh	Social Science;Economics	What is the best way to lift a nation out of a depression?	I know from reading about the Great Depression that protectionism only exacerbates the problem. Deficit spending (WW2), while lifting the nation out of the depression, only increases the national debt to the level where we can only afford to make interest payments without cutting a lot of expensive programs. Any economist who can point the way?
20090131163734AADfMIG	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	My name was Phyllicia Mazen?	Last night I had the most peculiar dream.  I dreamed that I was "royalty".  Not by birth, or anything.  But, in my dream it was like it was a second life--like I have always lived it but not in my waking life.      Anyway, I was dressed in this red dress with gold, purple and green detailing.  I was in matching shoes and such.  My hair was in an up-do.  My mother was my mother, but she wasn't around.  My father was not my father.  I was told that the father I had always known as such was not truly him.  They changed my name from my current name to Phyllicia Mazen.  I remember this distinctly, as I saw it on the paper.      I had a sister in the dream and she was rather bossy.  She was joking during the dream and asked me if I would cook something for breakfast.  I said, "yeah, I love to cook."  She laughed, and said I didn't know how.      At this point it appeared to me that I had lived a different life, and that I had secrets to keep.        I later overheard my grandmother in the dream telling someone that they had to get rid of me.  I was scared, so I went to find someone to help me.  There was a guy in my dream that I had been friends with, but he was of a different house.  So, we were not supposed to be friends.       We ended up going to get someone from his houses help.  It was futuristic at this point, and I was still dressed the same (as was everyone else).  I was the one who drove the car wherever we needed to go.  Oh, and I got the help I needed from my friends house by telling them what my birth name was.        We ended up going away from the area we had been staying at (our original "castles" -- smaller and older than you'd assume).  He apparently had a baby.  I remember being introduced to it.  They didn't have a name and I was to name it.  He ended up being hit by a car (the friend), and I was to take care of the baby.  But, I was distinctly told by the now dead friend that I had to wait 3 ____ and then he would be back.        So...what does this mean?
